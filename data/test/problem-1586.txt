May the next year start as bright for us as the day did for Harry and Draco and may we all have someone to hold our hand.
It took the rest of the day to plant all the new trees and by the time they were done, they both felt like they could fall asleep while standing.
Then he spoke: “Ginny and I broke up.”
Epic tones for Harry’s epic adventures,
“Potter.”
“All good and well, but today he's not putting his hands all over you. So, Ember, you're with me,” the gang's leader decided as the wind picked up.
Potter shot him a sharp look. “Don't call them that! But since you're asking: Ron helps out at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and Hermione is taking care of her parents.” There was something left unsaid between the lines and that something was dangerous, too closely connected to Draco's flight angst, so better not to touch on it.
“But, but when there's a beginning then something has to end before! And you said she will restart
“I don't think so,” was the unperturbed reply. “We will find you a better name in no time. But you may call me Holle today.”
“No, just like an ass,” Harry informed him. Why had he even bothered?
“Idiot.”
gave Harry some uncomfortably indecent ideas that he'd rather not explore, thank you very much. Why was an arsehole's arse suddenly so bloody engaging? Malfoy was still Malfoy after all, firm bum notwithstanding. On the other hand... ass was ass, no matter the gender... yet Harry wasn’t
Every time in the last months when Draco had worked out on the grounds, the hippogriff had followed him around, hovering and seemingly making sure that Draco did nothing illegal.
Harry swept Draco up, peppering his face with kisses so enthusiastically that Draco had to hold the ring box high in the air for it to not be knocked out of his hand. Typical. He was trying to be thoroughly romantic and Harry just– cupped his face with both hands and kissed him. Kissed him like he'd never kissed him before, like Draco was the world. They should've tasted like Christmas dinner and Butterbeer, but to Draco their kiss had the taste of love and incredible joy.
And on the next page was... Draco grinned. Oh yeah, August had been fun. The first time Harry had officially joined a Slytherin get-together – just Harry surrounded by Draco's school friends.
It was starting to go dark when Draco at last had everything together and was ready to head homewards. It was time; his stomach was growling already, in need of some sustenance.
A few bodies over were entangled Fred and George, mouths open and snoring. All along they'd been a double deal. Witnessing them apart after the war had been like meeting them all over again and Harry had realised that he liked them both for different reasons. Fred's impish protectiveness of his friend Seeker had really caused quite the uproar, but in hindsight Harry was thankful. The open cheerfulness of Fred’s had made Harry welcome – be it back in first year at Platform 9¾ or at The Hunt. He was one of the best people Harry knew.
The conversation with the female librarian was short: A local farmer had come by the other day and asked the same questions Draco had. The man had agreed to leave an address for Draco to reach him.
he'd ever imagined was going to happen.
They were closer now and finally Draco could hear them too: noise, terrible, screeching, maddening noise. Rattling, screaming, hooting, yelling, wailing, groaning and grunting from a hundred throats. Followed by alluringly wild melodies and the din of thousands of sweet silver bells. And over all that the
But then he shook his head. No, Potter didn't get to have any snacks either. And if their roles were reversed, Draco just knew that Potter would be already shouting it from the rooftops that Malfoy had vanished. Because that's who the Scarhead was, someone who would put others' needs before his own. Which was exactly the reason Draco had to bring the idiot back: so Draco could make fun of Potter's stupid selflessness.
Wham!
They clinked glasses and chatted about Quidditch and Hogwarts and the happy couple.
Draco suddenly became acutely aware that the look she was giving him was one of wariness. As if, any moment now, he could turn his nose on the library idea just because it was Muggle. He took a deep breath. Maybe she wasn't so far off. If it had been a few months back, he might have. But now, things were different. And a wizarding library sounded like a bloody brilliant idea. Too bad it didn't exist.
Then Harry's face lit up in the way sunlight hits white flower petals – ineffably beautiful, almost too bright to look at.
“Well, silver lining: Now the portrait can accept all their thanks in your stead.” Hermione grinned and Harry shot her a dirty look.
Why was it again that those two were helping with the Hunt research? Sure, they were goody-goodies, but to this extent? It was vital that they were assisting him, their reputation, input and comradeship kept him going. But why, why had they volunteered for this?
The lift had arrived. Draco got on and hummed along the loudspeaker's
“You... want to throw a Galleon in and see if it comes out on this end?”
“Erm, I just wanted to give you back your wand?” Up close, Potter looked taken aback and flustered, weakly offering Draco the wand he now recognised as his own. “But, apology accepted. I guess.”
“Hi there, can you tell me where we are?” Seeker squatted down to talk to the boy, but the kid just bounced in excitement and put all his fingers at once into his mouth. “I guess you're not supposed to talk to strangers. But I just need to know–”
It couldn't possibly be something so frivolous as love? And even if it were, Ronald  and Hermione loved Potter before his disappearance; others too. How could
“Oh, look: pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows!” Pinkish glitter powder rained over the crowd of paparazzi and left them all dazed with far-off, elated expressions on their faces. “Quickly, this way!” George had appeared at their sides, pulling them away now.
Draco, it had just happened. But then it had felt so
Draco however had picked up something odd then: “Kreacher, what did you mean 'your master gone, yet there'?”
“Yeah, I'm back in my life and this is Draco who I told you so much about. We're together now. All is well.” Harry felt his face split into a happy smile. It was true, all was well indeed.
In any case, as mighty as they both were, Life and Death were both bound somehow and for the first time, Harry realised that that was plain to see for everyone who cared to look: In human form, both wore the same type of chains, wrapped around their middles, symbolising their limbo.
Ice cold fear trickled down Seeker's back. He had been feeling increasingly faint since this morning, but he had thought that that had been because of his tries to get attention.
Potter's face darkened. “Yeah, I mean, no, I mean, sort of. It's complicated. But I didn't know who you were then.” His gaze bore into Draco and the latter became once again acutely aware of just
There was a heavy silence as the gang considered this.
Hermione shot her husband a dark look. “Ronald. Did you not promise me you told Draco last month about the traditional Weasley lunch on Boxing Day?”
Hearing a witch talk thusly to a house-elf didn't sit well with Draco at all. Lonely servants. Laughable. But when he contemplated the wrinkled-skinned little fellow, his views wavered as Kreacher's bloodshot eyes had a longing look to them, if only for a moment.
Why had Harry thought it so absolutely necessary to retrieve his issue of
Right, that was it. That was what they had talked about all those months ago. That was why the phrasing had felt familiar.
“Whichever,” she replied curtly, busy with dusting off her Tracht dress.
Queen Harry leant forward, something predatory painting his features. “You think he's
Clearly unfazed, the snake hissed impatiently and started slithering away, yet paused to casually remark:
“You're doing it wrong.”
“Are you sure about this?” Harry hissed, a side glance at the Muggles. “That the Swedish Ministry of Magic is lenient regarding violations of the Statute of Secrecy?”
hadn't pardoned you, he would have already taken measures into his own... talons and
Unfortunately, this had two unpleasant side effects: The first was the replacement of memories of Cedric by memories of Malfoy, laughing and awkwardly swim-dancing with the merpeople. Gosh, hadn't it been the epitome of cuteness to see the stuck-up Slytherin let loose like that? Harry was almost tempted to think of it as, shudder, endearing and this train of thought was simply appalling. Why couldn't he keep this nonsense at bay tonight? He normally managed so well...
“Mr. Malfoy. I'm sure you have a really good reason to barrel into my
Finally, Harry choked out: “I, thank you.”
Tears, more painful than a thousand
Draco and the Weasel shared a confused look.
She bit her lip. “I don't know. Let's go there first and see for ourselves.”
Well, she and The Hunt had stolen Harry alright. He frowned. Something about all this was tingling in the back of his mind. The information was only partly new and yet, somehow, Draco's research cast a new light on the things Harry had learned while riding with The Hunt.
Draco's back hit the wardrobe. “What are you doing?” he whispered.
He was about to Disapparate when his gaze landed on the only quiet corner in the whole bustling street: Ollivanders. Of course, the wand shop had its busiest time right before the start of a new school term.
When Harry had dropped the Resurrection Stone, back during The Battle of Hogwarts, he had thought that he would never find it again. And maybe he wouldn't have, but now that his brain had made the connection, the stone and The Hunt were linked and, as Harry had hoped, there was still some tiny bit of Hunt left in him. If one'd come so close to being a permanent part of The Hunt, something stayed behind, somehow... He had felt (and ignored) it ever since unmounting Lightning at the cliffs. Earlier, when they had entered the Forest, Harry had reached inside himself, found the piece of Hunt magic and followed it to this place. Just like back at Windsor Great Park when he had had to retrace his steps back to The Hunt encampment.
Harry sighed inaudibly and slipped out of the bed, carefully making sure not to wake Draco. Although the blond boy looked healthier and overall better than the last time Harry had seen him, the dark circles under Draco's eyes spoke volumes about the (non-)amount of sleep he'd been getting lately. So maybe it was better, not to disturb him now.
want to hear that name again!” Despite the sharp tone, he came over to envelope Harry and Anne into a bear hug. “Thanks for saving me, you two.” He took the baby. “Glad you found your dragon, Harry.” Turning he bellowed: “Ember, come here, my friend!”
Harry shivered and it wasn't because of the cold seeping into his body from the snow-covered ground. There was something about this... being... something that touched his innermost core in a way he couldn't describe. Only that he knew without asking that she was oh so powerful and old, no ancient, and that he better not anger her. Yet there was also a confusing softness to her that made him feel something akin to hope. She felt like winter and spring – and she was still looking at him.
To no one's surprise, it was Hermione – she and Ron just over for tea – who had pointed out then that probably the reason Kreacher had never followed Draco's orders one hundred percent (e.g. not permanently staying in Hogwarts) was because Harry had always, even when away, been Kreacher's true master. All had nodded to that.
Steam rose from the watch as it dried.
“Just thinking.” She tugged at her lip. “By the way, you were wrong, Ron. We wouldn't have forgotten her.”
“Course you knew, after all, you two,” Harry's eyes went from one to the other, as he put together the puzzle pieces in his mind, “are two sides of the same coin – death and life.”
Nott's face lit up in sincere gratitude as Draco gently shoved Pansy off. “Thanks... Draco, but I'm going to live with Blaise. It's all sorted out already.”
“Okay, okay. Gosh, you're such a spoilsport, Potter. Alright, the rumour goes like this: Normally, when a household's house-elf gets too old, they are beheaded–”
“Right and what opportunist tells his presumed victim about his ploy beforehand, eh?”
Ever since unearthing the way to free Potter, Draco had redoubled his efforts of pinpointing the location of The Hunt. Yet while travelling around and following every tiniest hint, the days stretched into weeks and Draco found himself sans verified Hunt hideout on the last day of July.
are?” Half asked, sitting down next to his girlfriend and taking her hand.
“That guy won't probably even be there anymore,” BraveHeart supplied unhelpfully and added giddily. “But look! Snowdrop and Scoffer are doing loop-the-loops! Amazing!” He promptly attempted a try of his own.
Despite it being months now, he had not given up yet. Yes, it was bothersome and yes, it went slowly, not much novel knowledge dribbling in from the few sources he could find. The important thing however was that there still
Soon the whole hunting party had gathered in a loose circle around a big pile of hay, stacked up under a crude wooden cross jutting crookedly out of the ground. Harry noticed that the set-up was on an unreaped stripe of the field that still displayed traces of left-over crop under the thin layer of fresh snow.
Sighing silently, Draco went to sit in the rarely used armchair in the corner.
Warrington bobbed his head carefully along.
“You really did,” Harry confirmed and kissed Draco on the cheek.
“It's also a wall between us,” Seeker said quietly.
“Not a dream,” Harry confirmed, still puzzled with Malfoy's sudden outburst and his following implications. “But–”
The top of their air-bubble had forcefully hit something solid. Turned out, there was a wall after all.
“It's beautiful, B, thank you.” Seeker put the mask on. It fit well. “I didn't realise you could paint like this. I guess I just assumed your own mask was painted by... someone else.”
“Seriously? Guys, really.” Granger rubbed her temples. “Let's not start fighting again.”
Taken by surprise, BraveHeart hesitated, then pulled the mask off and handed it to Harry. For a moment, he looked small and uncertain, but then he smiled as if a burden had been lifted off his shoulders. “Thank you.”
! I'm sorry for all the petty arguments and the tricks I played on you and, no, let's be honest, I'm
Malfoy snorted. “Now, that's because you are blind as a bat. But – who else would run off to the Quidditch pitch in the middle of the celebrations, other than you? After that
“Well?” Finnigan prodded.
The sooner he got away from this git, the better. Especially with those disturbing ideas circling in his head all the time now, like thinking of Malfoy as... well,
Harry gave up, throwing his hands with the reins up in defeat which caused Lightning to huff disapprovingly. These guys made absolutely no sense and this was giving him headaches. One thing, however, seemed to be essential here: that The Hunt had a higher purpose than he had thought at first and that catching The Beginning would be very, very bad (or good?) and very, very far in the future.
Mabel's face brightened. “Lobster quadrille!” Without asking, she pulled Draco by the hand towards where the crowd was now conglomerating.
“Not too late to go back to bed, Potter. You need the beauty sleep.” Malfoy grinned the tiniest grin.
“Can you not hear me?” He tentatively placed a hand on the man's upper arm and got exactly zero reaction. “Don't you feel this?” He tried to squeeze, but it was as if there were a thin layer of protection between them making it impossible for Seeker to truly connect with the man.
“Not ever! You– Argh!”
The portrait snorted. “Oh, come off it! When have we ever
As Muggles could hardly send Draco an owl, Granger had agreed to hand out the Weasel and her foh-n number for the purpose.
As soon as they were down the passageway, Hermione drew closer to Ron and whispered: “So, is there anything on the paper?”
As his group members discussed last bits of strategy, his mind went back to the day The Hunt had come to this area. He remembered feeling groggy from drinking too much the night before and he had been very grateful to simply lay down and rest while the others had taken care of finding a nice camping place in the middle of an open forest on a wide clearing near Holle's Pond (which had once again travelled on ahead of The Hunt).
His face turned sober. Even when the memories had faded after that, leaving nothing but the reassurance of his friends, Harry had clung to hope. That's why, when, on the cliffs, he had forgotten about Draco, yet remembered about the possibility of being set free by being called one's name, Harry had known instantly that that blond boy must be the right person, and that he should call Harry's name.
Harry swallowed. “Everyone.” After a brief pause he added: “And you?”
Draco agreed with this assessment. “That would be better.”
Draco cursed himself inwardly and quickly cast a warming spell on the underdressed boy, while rushing forward to wrap his own winter cloak around Potter's shoulder.
“And?” Draco had inquired nervously instead of a greeting. He'd been formerly pacing the floor around the kitchen table with a cup of cold tea clutched in his hands.
July had brought new reasons to celebrate and Harry had gotten two birthday parties, so make up for the year he had been with The Hunt. (Although he'd assured everyone that it wasn't necessary because the Fallen Four had thrown him a party last time. Draco had just rolled his eyes at him then and had waved him out of the kitchen. As if Draco would let Harry cheat him out of his right to dot on the birthday boy twice. Huh!)
“It means,” said Half who seemed to have come to terms with whatever had caused his earlier mood-swing, “that we have met before
“Hiya, Dobby,” grinned Weasley and high-fived the elf. Definitely weird alright.
spell to clean all nooks and crannies. He then proceeded to unshrink his luggage and levitated his belongings to wherever he thought they fit best.
The old man looked pleased with himself and offered the wand back to Draco who tentatively took it.
Suddenly all his strength left Draco and he slowly let out a breath, sinking down onto a battered wing chair facing his interlocutor. “You're not familiar with Harry Potter.” This was starting to sound like a conversation between two parrots, always repeating the other's last words.
Half grinned humourlessly. “It's really easy: Don't fall down!” He mounted Gee which had, Harry doubled back, six legs. Okay.
that much power over your thoughts? It's just a word. It could easily mean potato.”
” The cracking voice sounded broken. “Harry!”
“Maybe due to the fact that no upstairs house-elf has shown up while you and I were being down here, calling for them? I gather they stay clear of this place. I know I would. The Janus Thickey ward in St. Mungo's gave me the creeps to be honest. I don't ever want to go back there.”
The little family made its way through the masses and reached Potter who seemed to be busy shaking hands while simultaneously... receiving gifts? Typical. Draco's life was on the brink of doom and Potter celebrated his own greatness.
“People leave stuff for us so we don't harm them,” it was Ember who answered, an unpleasant look of hunger in his eyes that had nothing to do with the hay, “because sometimes we do.”
Harry/Seeker: The way you were mockin’ me... Remembering all the times you fought with me?
Mimbelwimbel
“Stop that, Granger! I know where the library is!”
Potter shrugged. “Hermione burnt me.”
“He is. Good to a fault. That's why he deserves some rescuing himself this time round,” Draco sighed.
Hermione blinked disbelieving at the signed parchment thrust at her by a pouting Parkinson, then she composed herself. After all, they had two boys to rescue(?). “That's right.”
“Oh, the giant squid lives in here. It's mostly harmless, but at times, it gets hangry and starts eating anything within reach. That's why you won't see many fish in the cave, at best some nebby porpoises. Ah and crocodiles, they don't fear anything, haha. But don't worry. I'll protect you.” She winked and Draco recoiled. Ugh.
The Forest again. Of course.
“Already did that. Well, sort of,” Pansy informed her friend and the other witch backed down. Pansy had always been an authority figure.
“It's the master key to Malfoy Manor and its grounds. I'm giving the properties to you as a permanent loan. Don't worry about the peacocks; they flew off while we were in holding. And in case you're wondering: There are no house-elves left. Also, while the garden is a bit overgrown yet rather nice still, the house itself might need a deep scrub for residual dark magic... ”
what to do to get him freed, but I can't bloody find him. And all it would take is calling his name once. That's it! Easy enough one should think, but
“So, you live here
“Everyone remember the rules?” Half took over, eyeing them all sharply. “We hide our flag here; the other team hides its. Whichever team finds the rival contenders' flag first, wins. If you yourself get 'captured', you have to return to Holle's Pond and wait till the end of the game.” He was pacing between them. “That is unless you can find or create a permitted hiding spot – which can be what, Wolfe?”
“Oh gosh, look at the time!” Hermione suddenly squeaked. “Merry Christmas, Draco! See you tomorrow!”
the cinder. There was something about him... but then again...
“Wait!” Queen Harry had made it across the table and was grabbing for them now. “That's dangerous! Draco, don't!”
“April fool!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” First Voice said firmly. “It is not Tillie's dolly, it is Master Malfoy's dolly.”
Harry took a deep breath. “Does it really matter that much to you as what someone is born?”
Draco sighed. He would have to discuss this with Hermione, see what she made of all of this. It would be embarrassing, but he still had to do it.
Harry swallowed. “That's Alice.”
Returning to the task at hand, he had to look through various cupboards before he found the mug he'd been searching for, as all the interior of the cabinets had seemingly doubled. Probably a side effect of all of Harry's things disappearing and then reappearing; after all, Draco had also filled the place, to make it his own.
“Well,” Draco chimed in, “if there's something you excel at, it's surely making a sacrifice for the greater good. I'm glad people finally appreciate that.”
Hermione whipped round at him and stared, wide-eyed. “I don't think I've
Harry scrunched up his nose. Showering had been a good idea though. Draco had been right – Harry had reeked a bit of horse and such. Draco however smelled fantastic, of lemon balm. Inhaling deeply, Harry sighed; it was nice to wear Draco's shirt, his scent. The former huntsman blushed slightly at thinking how the other boy was wearing Harry's shirt at this very moment.
Seeker looked from one to the other. “What's the problem? You can't swim or what?”
“Headmistress McGonagall, what brings you here at this hour?” Malfoy asked, clearly trying to steer the conversation away from the song.
“Whatever,
Oh, by the way, it's my birthday today, so if you feel like it, gift me a comment?
Lacie chuckled. “Because we live on treacle, silly. The Mell is a treacle well. The Upsters send it down through the fireplace.”
That statement made Harry's hair stand on end. The clock-faces. They hadn't been old men at all, they had been– Harry felt sick and looking at Malfoy, he must have figured it out, too, as the pale boy had just grown even paler. They'd better get out of here soon.
“Come back, Scarhead!” Draco cried – and just like that, everything clicked into place. It just felt right.
In any case, Harry tried to subtly wriggle himself free, at least his wand arm, but the old house-elf's grip was vice-like.
Draco had felt like letting go that night.
“What do you mean 'before we died'? I'm not dead!” Harry had got to his feet without even noticing it. BraveHeart's eyes flew from one to the other.
“Only peripherally. Behea–
“One's enough.” Weasley literally beamed now. “My brother Bill. He's currently working a desk job at Gringotts, so if we'd send him an owl now–”
'Tis there I'd sit and cry my fill
“I think you had me for a long time already,” Draco ventured thoughtfully, facing ahead. “You don't have the monopoly on obliviousness.” Picking up Harry's left hand, Draco entwined their fingers. “Do you remember that time at the lake, when we watched the sunrise together?” Harry hummed affirmatively. “That's when I first allowed myself – just for a second – to think that there could be more.”
The crone chuckled. “Yes, today I'm Holle. Holle who brought you a horse.”
Harry's hand shied away. "Why not?"
It all happened very quickly: One second Harry was safely riding in between Malfoy's soft hair, the next second the Gryffindor was hauled through the air in the iron grip of a small fist.
It starts mischievous like the participants of The Hunt, playing and partying.
Draco opened his mouth. This would be a long night. He had had an inkling before, but now it seemed certain that people forgot about Potter almost the second they heard about him. Furthermore, they had trouble keeping the thread of a conversation about The Wild Hunt.
“That's only partly true. Even your lot has rules to follow:
“Howard, come here, good kitty-kitty!” Draco crooned, trying to coax the cat out from under the kitchen counter of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
he protested, but it wasn't heartfelt. He was giddy. Draco was not giving up on him. Everything was going to be okay.
the pond is a bottomless pit! Oh, what else? Just the entrance to the realm of the dead, no biggie. Seeker, really, do you never pay attention when the riders talk?”
“Of course,” the other wizard answered dryly, his lips curling into a half-smile. “Well, now that you apparently have a newly redecorated house I'm sure you'll find a place to hang a portrait or two.” He blinked innocently. “Maybe ask that nice lady back in there for the contact information of the painter?”
Surprisingly, instead of nodding and walking away, Longbottom turned to face his grandmother with a stern expression. “Gran, please stop being rude. We've been over this. Malfoy and I are doing repairs together at Hogwarts. He's a fellow Patcher. He's a good comrade and I would appreciate it, if you would trust my judgement on this matter.”
“I will,” Harry agreed, “and you can come with and apologise to him.”
He heard them call after him (“You can't leave The Hunt!”), but he didn't look back. He was done with them, once and for all.
Seeker slumped down at the bottom of the statue and just sat there, while people came and went, like waves at the shore.
Hermione crossed out a big portion of her text with a forceful line and huffed in annoyance.
Draco squirmed a bit to look at him. “You turned that down! So, you're
Draco's thoughts wandered as he soaked in the sunshine. He had missed walking. Back, after his parents left for France, Draco had used to hike a lot. But these days, he found himself much too busy to engage in simple strolling most of the time.
A thousand times yes!
“You are both going to have some,” the merchieftainess insisted and her knee-weakening gaze pierced Draco. “For your own good. I am older than you, and must know better.”
The nun was a good storyteller. Seeker found himself swooning over the sad love story of Vega and Altair, the tragically separated lovers, and he was just about to name them his favourite, when the woman pointed at another group of stars: “And this is Draco, the dragon constellation. It...”
“Mabel,” Potter continued after a moment, when nobody had answered him, “isn't Méala a word with bad meaning? I think I heard my friend Seamus curse it once when he'd lost a game of Exploding Snap.”
“We'll take the shortcut down that hallway,” she jutted her chin in the indicated direction, “and wait it out in a classroom on the next floor.”
“Oh.” was all Potter said, when he entered the living room currently littered with Christmas wrapping paper and stacked dirty dishes. Draco had been too nervous to do much but pace the floor this last week. He certainly didn't have a mind for cleaning up.
So, he entered Ollivanders and a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop. The narrow store was as austere and dusty as it had been when he'd been eleven.
“Great. Thanks so much,” Draco said politely and tried to free his arm. “We got it from here. Just upwards is not that difficult.”
. Yet his tries fell on deaf ears, so he gave up and joined into the once again cheerful mood.
anything unusual?”
The other half was anxiously scanning the area.
Bollocks!
Draco clapped along before he caught himself. How uncouth.
Risking to get caught himself, Seeker sprinted out from his hiding spot, using the element of surprise to grab the moss person and make a U-turn, before Ember even had time to react.
about the boyfriend bit. Weasley was so not funny.
The owl unfolded her wings and slowly glided over to Harry. He extended his arm and she perched on his wrist.
“That's the idea,” Granger answered. “After all, it wouldn't be the first secret chamber a founder has left in the castle, right
Draco was just about to bite back, when the girl of the group cut in: “Hey, boys, will you stop it? The letter, Draco?”
“Goyle... you know I don't like him much. But he reminds me of Ember – Crabbe – and I've been thinking: Goyle only started drinking because he couldn't deal with his friend's death.” Harry's eyes had narrowed. “And I wasn't all that well either. Neither were you, if I may say so, or anyone, really. Some just hid it better than others.”
The same moment, she found herself colliding once again with Ron's lanky body, crashing them both into the grandfather clock that showed six o'clock precisely. “Ouch!”
“Oh, but it is, it
The actual Un-Sticking Charm.”
AKA The Wild Hunt would visit his barn due to the fact that it had been built on top of an old road. Such buildings were often in danger of being torn down by the riders.
“Croak!” croaked Holle and tilted her small, black head to the side.
“Bad enough to drive you out here anyway.”
“It's not that! They started by themselves. Someone nearby is on their deathbed. We need to get there in time.” Half leapt onto Gee's back.
It had been an awkward and tense conversation that had ended in an agreement to meet for tea.
now?”
“Perchta,” said Half with a shrug.
Most people had reacted as expected to the big news (Draco's father had indeed fainted).
Harry didn't answer. He was too absorbed in the image.
“There you are. Oh, Harry, you look dapper, dear!” Mrs. Weasley got up to hug Harry bone-crushingly tight.
“And with good reason. You have to stop drinking, Greg.” Draco had never used the abbreviation before, but now it felt right, more intimate. He lowered himself next to his friend. “It's killing you.”
Feeling the bed dip, he relaxed in anticipation of being snuggled – instead there was utterly unwelcome tickling!
Harry'd seen it in the scrapbook before and been so utterly proud of Draco for reaching out to his aunt.
“Thank you,” he croaked, “and thank you for,” he made a vague hand gesture, “all this. And... for saving my life. Twice.” The last words were barely a whisper.
“Who would have ever thought that members of Dumbledore's Army and the Inquisitorial Squad would one night work together?” Ron grinned and slapped Warrington on the shoulder. “Weird, eh? DA and IS, united.”
you have a cat,” Potter noted, amused, and ruffled the cat's fur.
“No, I'm good. I...” already have someone? But he didn't say that out loud. He wasn't sure himself where that thought had come from.
“Hey–”
away.
But what if... ruminating, she eyed her golden tea set. What if they
His back hurt and he was stiff all over.  When he rubbed the sleep off his face with ink stained fingers, he could feel the indents left by miscellaneous writing utensils which lay spread across the blank pages of a notebook. Bloody hell, he must have fallen asleep at the desk last night.
“No...” the farmer said and furrowed his brows. “This isn't a joke somehow, is it? Because I swear, if you–”
Seemingly confused about the effect of his simple observation, Ember turned to Harry: “If you're with him then that means you left The Hunt?”
The snickering girl sobered and turned to look at her black horse. “I'm not completely sure, actually. But I have a feeling that, yeah, it feels like in life I might have owned a pet named Binky? I can't really explain it, but when I first met her, the name popped into my head as if it had been waiting for her.” She shrugged helplessly.
He waved his wand and used a
Greengrass flipped her hair impatiently. “Isn't that obvious? We tried for months,
“Well, there's a moving flight of stairs near the Hufflepuff common room that apparently glitches a lot. I was thinking of having a look at it.”
“You're glowing,” said Potter unintelligently and as much as Draco wanted to snap back and say that 'obviously he was glowing', some part of him wished Potter had meant it differently, had said it in a different setting, for a different reason. So he kept quiet and started flicking off the algae from his soaked cloak instead.
“I always had a thing for redheads,” Wolfe remarked, not taking her eyes off Half's face. “Let's go, lover, I want to dance with you!”
Why was it again he felt obliged to get presents for everyone and their cat this year? Oh yeah, remorse and some such... and possibly, we wrinkled his nose,
“You, tosser! Don't scare me like that! It's not funny!”
.” But Lightning, the horse, gleefully ignored his master's wishes and pranced on with The Wild Hunt.
The ingredients were only mildly interesting (tea leaves and then some), but the background information was a jackpot. Draco's eyes bulged.
Draco stood dumbfounded for a moment, staring at the closed door. Did that just really happen? Did Hermione Granger,  Muggle-born extraordinaire, simply walk into his bedroom and order him around? He blinked. And what was that about a hu– The Wild Hunt! Potter! Dammit, he had forgotten about him again!
“Hello, Snowdrop.”
After The Battle of Hogwarts in the summer of this year, things had been chaotic. Draco and his parents had been arrested and charged with various Death Eater related acts. They had been tried in front of the freshly reassembled Wizengamot and would have probably all been sent to Azkaban if Potter himself had not made a surprise appearance and spoken for the defence. He had pointed out Draco's age and reluctance, Lucius' indifference towards the Dark Lord's cause just before the end and Narcissa's lie that had effectively saved Potter's life. Luckily for the Malfoys, his word held a lot of weight within the wizarding community nowadays (and also Lucius' inside information had been highly welcome).
While he enjoyed cold roast and mashed potatoes (Mother Weasley could
Her previously empty basket was full of fruit and other harvest yield, which she handed out generously among the riders (although they noticed she gave more to girls than guys).
“Yeah, if we could just...,” Draco motioned to the side and the ruff-wearing nobleman followed him.
while  brushing his teeth and then snuggled into bed. Right, the mantra: Potter, green eyes, stupid glasses, black bird's nest, fondness of treacle tart.
“Yes, yes,” Seeker snorted, throwing his hands in the air. “But you all also said that you spent your summer mostly at Hoher Meißner and then we went back there, so The Hunt
, was of a fiery colour, contrasting his green eyes.
Narcissa Malfoy stopped singing and softly brushed a last, stray tear from her five-year-old son's resting face. He had finally fallen asleep. She let her gaze wander through the big windows when lightning lit the room for a split-second. It really was a bad thunderstorm tonight.
Merry Christmas everyone!
“Let you out, did they?” Malfoy laughed and Harry, though initially annoyed, joined in momentarily. With that phrasing, he'd had that coming, truly. “But yeah, could be,” Malfoy continued. “How about you just ask Dobby once we're back on the surface.”
Potter may have won the war but he surely hadn't won the dreamless-lottery.
“I did and I'm sorry. I can't apologise enough.”
Harry chuckled. “Funny how
Why though? Not completely sure himself, Seeker turned to rest his cheek on Lightning's soft hair. Just something about the blond boy had shaken him so thoroughly that Seeker simply
Potter, oblivious idiot that he was, had meanwhile picked up the dropped object of offence and handed it to his patching partner. “Here.”
“Not now, there isn't. But there was.” Lacie lazily flapped a hand at the well's wall. “They is out there now, all of them. It has seen them, surely.”
A young merman with sharp teeth clapped his hands twice. “Two lines! Seals to the right,” (“He means ocean-borns.”) “salmons to the left.”
Then BraveHeart was practically screaming: “How exciting!”
It was like a silent agreement between them. While working together they would say whatever they couldn't say to others. Drop all pretence and be miserable, without being scrutinised or criticised or babied or pitied. Just letting it all out. Like talking into a void.
me?!”
Seeker and his team mate made it into the hollow tree by a hair. Squeezed together uncomfortably, they both gasped for air. Meanwhile, Ember unable to 'capture' them as they were in a safe zone swore colourfully and stomped his huge feet.
Malfoy suppressed a yawn. “Because we never actually talk and now's the opportunity. Not that it had any merit for
The moment he was done, the blond boy snapped his mouth shut and glared at the three house-elves who had listened raptly and were now breaking out in loud cheers.
hadn't insisted on docking points for
The big boy's mouth thinned into a tight line. “Yeah, I– okay then.” He swayed, trying to hit the dotted line. Yet he paused and looked at Draco, eyes wide. “You won' leave me again though, will you? You'll come visit? In that, in de-to-c-k-tion ward?”
Harry looked up, confused. “She has a name, her name is Snowdrop. I told you so.”
potter.
So... yeah, that took an awful lot longer than anticipated. And it's definitely no longer weekend. I'm very sorry.
Picking up the discussion, the twin said doubtfully: “If this Patty,” (“Potter.”) “is our friend like you said then why was he with
They had been at it for hours and none of the park visitors got it. Sure, some pointed at Anguis and some even screamed, but no one looked hard enough to understand the motion patterns as means of communication.
His parents greeted him at the door and he was happy to see them. But after that, Christmas dinner turned out less enjoyable than Draco had hoped.

“Does Master Harry wish some breakfast?” Kreacher had appeared at Harry's bedside, although no one had called for him.
The present. Right. Draco blinked away the lump in his throat.
amusing,” Harry remarked and Draco snorted. “But I wouldn't have needed those to find out about your thoughts on my spectacles, did I now?” Pointing at Draco's reading glasses on top of Harry's head, the latter grinned widely. “Like my style, Malfoy?”
“Gross! Potter, at least have a semblance of culture, will you? Use my handkerchief.” Draco passed the other boy a monogrammed piece of white brocade in exchange for the water bottle Potter had offered him.
The snake flicked his tail.
“Yeah?” the redhead ventured helplessly.
Ember grinned. “Just as well as I looked after Dreamer.” He nodded at the horse. “I'll call him Invincible though.”
Harry/Seeker: Time is a valuable thing...watch the count down to the end of the day; the clock ticks life away.
Protesting noises from the other two.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Thanks a bunch. Really, great way of helping, you guys: kidnapping and psychological torture!”
Draco didn't answer. Instead he turned towards the rising sun and watched it climb over the edge of the enchanted mountain top.

“So, what are you doing here, today of all days?” Longbottom inquired, dangling from his arm a red women's handbag out of which peeked a toad.
Draco before?”
“I can't,” Draco croaked, backing away from the handle. “You'll have to do this on your own after all. I – I don't fly anymore.” He curled his hands into fists. He hadn't wanted it to sound so pathetic.
“What? Why?”
As if Draco's little break had been an inspiration, the Weasel followed suit by flopping onto his back with a groan. “I don't think I ever want to read another word in my
Draco blinked unseeing out of the window, his heart racing at the wording. “I didn't know it was yours. When I moved in here I had forgotten you used to live here.”
Smiling softly, Draco revelled in the memory of twelve-year-old Potter being all flustered. True, the song was ghastly, but what fun it had been to see Potter go red like a tomato. “I won't forget that,” Draco vowed to himself.
Affirmative murmur was heard.
Seeker eyed his drink sceptically as everyone grabbed one.
Draco suddenly shuddered. Being here at the park made him feel so much closer to Potter.
Sure enough, out of Holle's Pond rolled a magnificent golden chariot onto the clearing. Seeker gaped. First he thought the vehicle moved on its own but as soon as he had blinked once, he knew better: Harnessed in front of the wagon were two horses, two oxen, two cows, two lynxes and two white cats – in that order – preceded by twenty-four Hunt dogs and a single eagle owl. However they were only there for the time of the fluttering of his eyelids. There and gone in a tick.
Harry lifted his hands before his eyes and turned them over. “I'm not though.”
“As I was saying, there is more than one type of ghost-like afterimages... although my other examples are extremely rare and I must admit my musings about them are mostly based on hear-say. First there is the unlikely event that a
Coffee, really, those uncouth continentals.
“It's still Granger, Draco. I kept my maiden name.” She smiled at Draco who looked scandalised. Kept her maiden name? What kind of atrocity was that now? How had he missed that. Well maybe during that one time when he handed a handkerchief to Aunt Andromeda. Obviously
“Not a joke!” Granger squeaked. “We just assumed. Since that is what happened to our friend... Parfay?” (“Potter.”) “And we thought it might be the same for you.”
They're not weird! All headings are lines of the popular Christmas song Carol of the Bells. Of course, the lines are not in the right order, more like the way they fit with the content of the chapters. As the story is somewhat centred around Christmas, it seemed fitting.

Somehow, looking for Potter, doing research about The Wild Hunt and all things attached to that had taken over his life in a bizarre way.
The address of the farmer they had received from the library lady via foh-n the other day had turned out to be a thatched roofed farmhouse with a narrow courtyard surrounded by fields. There was a Carl vehicle parked next to the building. Definitely Muggle.
. Yeah, Harry could totally see that, with Ember having 'nasty personality' basically written all over him. He just didn't
“You mean the mighty Weasel?” Draco smirked and quickly ducked, for wrapping paper came flying his way, immediately followed by a redhead aiming to tickle.
Ember, feeding a piece of food to Scoffer the man-dog, didn't even look up. “And we don't care what
Also, for this chapter especially, I would like to reiterate the
Potter's grip on Draco's hair tightened and wasn't it just cute that tiny Potty was so very reliant on Draco?
“Forget about whom?” Granger's hand hovered over a new piece of tart.
...and regressing back to sad when it doesn't work.
Harry gagged exaggeratedly. Yet after Alice' recent display of complete whimsicality, he was more inclined to believe that Malfoy hadn't
“You can see me,” Seeker whispered breathlessly. It was impossible. The one person he had wished to meet most in the world had suddenly appeared before his very eyes.
A particularly loud gasp and an unstable sway of Malfoy's hips brought Harry's attention back to his companion in peril. The whole boy was shaking now and by the sound of it, he had real trouble breathing.
Harry nodded, satisfied.
Draco dipped his head at him thankfully. “Alright, again from the top: His name is Harry Potter. He’s 18 years old. He was snatched from the Hogwarts grounds, near the southern walls tonight close to midnight. As to why I can only guess: Because he looked illicitly at The Wild Hunt. It is they who have taken him.”
“Right... Malfoy, why are you here again?” The Weasel's face was scrunched up in thought. It looked right painful. “What were we talking about?”
“She's waiting, too,” Death said and pointed ahead where the trees thinned, allowing the view onto a familiar scene: Holle's Pond glittered in the low autumn sun and The Hunt was scattered all around it, noisy as ever.
“If you wanna help, get some more booze. Theo's cuttin' me off, that ijit.” He wobbled.
“Yes, of course. Thank you again, Draco, a wonderful surprise!”
Draco hummed into the kiss. Always a competition between the two of them. But he didn't mind.
“What what? Swimming is not a necessary skill for a wizard, Potter,” Draco sniffed and was very relieved to change the topic from one humongous embarrassment to a small one (which didn't even count, really, because it was true – who needed to know how to swim, like ever?). “Be grateful I'm such a refined person that I learnt the basics anyway.”
It was as though scales were falling from Draco's eyes. How could he have been so blind. Of course Potter came in here nonchalantly like it was his own bedroom, because
“A place where old and/or crazy house-elves get sent. Or so the saying goes,” Pansy elaborated. “It's real then, the Mell?”
“Fine~” Pansy extended a hand towards her house-mate. “Give me some red ink, a quill and another envelope.”
So there was something to it then.
“Never mind.” Granger waved the redhead's indignation away. “Owlery. Shall we?”
“You too, happy holidays.” Weird. Draco just couldn't bring himself to say it back.
into this five-hour relationship to go all serious on me?”
Harry nodded. It made sense. “Once as a baby when I nearly died and the other time when I
Within seconds, his indifferent mask crashed splintering to the floor, leaving him gaping at no other than Hermione Granger and a grumpy looking Weasel hidden half behind her.
“Good chaps." Cassius grinned at the squabblers. "Besides,” he pointed at the two owls in question, “I think they wouldn't be disinclined to fly together.”
stern look when he rushed in without knocking and found her sitting on her sofa in front of a cosy fire.
Heyheyhey~
The spectacle was grotesque and Harry would have laughed, but his emotions were still raw from the scene he had just witnessed and somewhere inside him, he felt sorry for the bereaved.
Harry hadn't lied: He really didn't care what people would say about this surprising union (especially not the press; he could handle them, maybe give them a nice headline: 'love is love' or something). The ones that actually counted already approved by having supported Draco in his endeavours. (Though it was beyond weird to see Ron and Hermione so cosy with the former Slytherin.)
“All inhabitants inhale merpeople magic with every breath. This place is special to all of us.”
Draco swatted away a precariously wandering hand, yet couldn't suppress a grin. Good gracious, Harry’s perseverance had always been endearing; which was a problem now.  “Would you stop it, you tosser?! You might not have had enough opportunities for this last year, but that doesn't mean–”
The tiny boy glowed with pride at the nickname and puffed out his chest. “Shall we, then?”
Harry watched Draco's Adam's apple bop. “The Fiendfyre.”
“It's not like that or actually... Okay, I admit, I'm confused about him, like, really, really confused. You might not know this, but Ginny and I broke up.” Harry's face grew serious. “At first I was devastated but then I realised that she was right: We make better friends than lovers. We are like pieces of puzzle which, after having been burned and broken, no longer fit.” He rubbed his forehead. “Anyway, she and I are over and ever since, no, maybe even before? God, I don't even know where to start. I'm so unsure. What is it about him?” Harry looked helplessly at his own (slightly distorted) face.
? Very mature, calling me out on that when you’re not better yourself.”
“Because you're not in your right mind.”
“How should we go about this?” Cassius asked and produced some more parchment, ink and quills from his pockets. “Looking up everything about Helga Hufflepuff would take forever. Also...” he fidgeted and then glanced up rather sheepishly, “I'm not grand at, er, research and stuff.”
Tightening his hands in Malfoy's hair, Harry was about to give a sharp reply about how Cedric had been so much
Everyone was gathering now: Wolfe and Half, Ember and Dreamer, Snowdrop and Scoffer, even the horses – Lightning and Gee and Binky and Grapes. All of them, humans and animals, ghosts and whatnots.
Draco jumped up as though stung by a bee. Potter! He had nearly forgotten about Potter! How could Draco have been so careless as to... his eyes snapped to the book and he hoicked it up. Empty pages. Blank! All of them!
“Okay. He's got black hair, green eyes, terrible glasses, yae high. He went to school here. You've known him since he was eleven. Ring a bell?” It was only his frustration that made him talk to a higher-up in such a mannerless manner. That and maybe the relatively friendly relationship he had built with most of the Hogwarts staff over the last few months.
saw that,” Malfoy laughed silently, his shoulders brushing Harry's as he shook. “Wait till it's in the
“They agreed when I told them I would never set foot in the house again anyway and that it was for the whole of the wizarding community and also a good way to do penance.”
Malfoy stilled, a moment of horror on his face before he schooled his features into neutrality and hissed: “Shut up, you idiot. Don't provoke them!”
“We're coming with you,” added Half. Ember nodded in agreement.
One whole year he had been searching. One bloody year.
An eerie hush blanketed the little grange, only interrupted by the screams: one faint wail from inside the house was echoed by a quiet honk of the hellhound pack, each subsequent one feebler than the preceding, until there was nothing but silence.
hissed Draco under his breath, but the damage was done and the merwoman circled back to them.
“HALF! You bloody bastard!” Seeker didn't wait for the addressee to react,  but lunged forward and threw himself at the redhead, starting to pummel him.
Looking over at the desk, Draco decided that he didn't feel like working anymore tonight. He stretched his arms over his head. All this sitting (and Harry) would ruin his back someday.
Wow, what craziness. Harry shook his head hard. He must have heard wrong. “But that means she is
and this means
“We know this might come across a bit ludicrous, but yesterday was May the second,” Granger elaborated. Draco's brows furrowed. Of course he knew what the date implied – anniversary of The Battle of Hogwarts. “We talked about how lucky we are to still be alive and how many times we nearly died already and we thought 'Why wait? Life is bloody short'. So, here we go. Oh, speaking of going, Ron, I think we should head to The Burrow, tell everyone. Draco, do you mind if we reschedule dinner?”
Draco didn't have the heart to tell them that he had actually already made plans to visit his parents in France. He would just have to wing it somehow.
“Gee, Malfoy, stop the gushing, will you? If you keep spouting cheesy love confessions about my supposedly best friend, I'll hurl.” The Weasel made a gagging noise.
“Back here?” Harry was struggling with what to make of this new strangeness while simultaneously trying to keep an eye on Ember descending from Lightning's back with the baby in one arm.
Pushing himself off the floor, Seeker groaned in pain. Not only had sleeping uncomfortably done things to his back but also were the few places Half's punches had hit Seeker giving off dull aches.
“Then I suggest we go to the library?” Ron said.
In his anger, Malfoy had drawn up too close to Harry's face and when the Gryffindor turned his head to look at the other boy, they suddenly found each other nose to nose. An embarrassing silence followed, until Malfoy pulled back with a huff, blushing just as hard as Harry.
Portrait-Harry yawned and blinked.
One would think, with nearly twenty-five, they’d be a bit too old for childish arguments these days. Yet having known each other as long as they did, they’d often lapse back into old habits, teasing and bickering like little kids.
In any case, Harry and Draco had taken to eating at Draco's aunt's house almost as often as at Ron and Hermione's or The Burrow.
A slow smile spread across his face. Potter. Potter was back – and with him all the small and big memories. Their fights and their dancing, their crying and their laughter. All the images, having been ripped, over months, piece by piece from Draco's mind, had come back and now, with his lids closed, he could clearly see Potter's face before his inner eye. It was all there.
“I suppose we'll try to transfigure the table into a broom?” Malfoy rolled up his sleeves. “Better I do it. You're pants at Transfiguration.”
“I mean... have you really thought that through? An ex-Death Eater at your wedding, are you sure?” Draco didn't try to get out of it. In fact he was rather touched and excited, already planning wedding gifts in the back of his mind. But he was also realistic and he didn't want to ruin their day.
“You've really changed.” Longbottom, who had been off to the loo, sat down next to Draco. “The patching, playing Quidditch together, helping to find missing people, giving presents, advocating house-elf rights and now even Mrs. Norris likes you.”
“I guess there never really was in the first place.” A single tear trickled down Pansy's cheek and she quickly wiped it off. “I thought that if I only gave you time, you would come back to me. But you never really were
eat?”
Ada nodded. “Yes, this is where all your dirt is pushed into our lake. But not to worry, little boy,” (“I'm fifteen!”) “your clever magic doers have put a spell on the pipes so that they filter and clean all sewage before it enters here. So it should be clean.” She smirked. “At least the lower part.”
. Okay, so the door chime was carolling. Draco would have thought it cute, if it didn't slaughter the song the way it did: Every two seconds, the door was opened, resulting in another rapid-fired line.
Harry shuddered involuntarily and leant into Draco's touch. “Like the Tale of the Three Brothers?” Holle flapped her wings. “Just how much of it is true?”
“Ugh, no thanks.” Like he would touch
“The picture?” he repeated hopefully.
“Can't,” Malfoy shifted a bit and Harry's stomach swooped awkwardly as the blond wizard's ass ground accidentally into Harry's nether regions, “too knobbly. Now, spread your legs, Potter.” Harry, still preoccupied with the aforementioned feeling, choked and Malfoy sniggered meanly. “Pervert. I meant: Make room, so I can sit
“Yes, he is. But that doesn't change the fact that Malfoy is, too. We will get into trouble, but so will he.” She leant a bit closer towards her adversary and lowered her voice. “Do you know what happens in detention under Umbridge's watch?”
“The best,” said Draco firmly. The two former Slytherins shared a long look and Harry snuck a hand to Draco's back. Seeing Crabbe like this must be so very hard.
Harry leant back. Ah, so that was why. Earlier, in the heat of the moment, he'd simply taken Draco's explanation without questioning it, but later, lying restlessly awake, he's been starting to wonder. Scarhead as a nickname had made sense somehow; the fact that it had worked, if only said with enough conviction. Yet it had also been weird – why would an endearment function as a freeing, proper name? Now, a 'heart's name', that was something else. What had Draco mumbled again, looking so utterly flustered?
“So I heard.” Harry's dry reply sent Wolfe and BraveHeart into a fit of giggles.
To my wonderful beta umbrellaless22 who found time in their super-busy schedule to read this beast of a chapter and give me valuable advice. Your soul is pulchritudinous.
“Alright, we'll tell you what we know. But we'll need a quill, ink and some parchment first. Maybe in one of the classrooms–”
falling down.
Upending his arm-chair and launching over the table, Malfoy had grabbed little Harry. The Slytherin quickly backed away, till he hit the wall behind them.
Illuminated by the dim light of round, greenish lamps hanging on chains from the ceiling and a dying fire under an elaborately carved mantelpiece, Harry made out Malfoy standing at the far right side, giving off an annoyed vibe.
Granger looked up, dismayed. “My condolences.”
Hermione quickly cut in, bless her, “we, that is Ron, Draco and I, have been looking for clues to free you from The Hunt and this was our research headquarters. Also,” and at this she gave Potter such a stern look that Draco could feel him flinch where their legs touched, “Draco is our friend now, so you better treat him nicely.”
“Ah, well, I changed my mind. Turns out she was right in the end, wasn't she? After all, your best friend Pillar was abducted by The Wild Hunt which Grims are connected to and she saw one in your cup, so I can admit that I misjudged her. I will send her a card when we get back.” She whipped her head around and stared at her boyfriend defiantly as if daring him to continue the argument. He however was cleverer than Draco would have given him credit and shut his mouth.
“So your theory is that Draco and Potter somehow got into that alleged hidden room of Helga Hufflepuff's and that for some reason they can't come out?” she picked up the conversation.
And while he did feel somewhat bad for leaving his date alone, he just needed a breather now.
For laying eyes on you
Yet he wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else in the world than right here, next to Draco.
right. Anne here knew who Scoffer was in her heart and she called him by his right name: the name she thought was right for him. Only she alone could do it really. After all, everyone else had forgotten about Scoffer. She was the only one who remembered him in both worlds.”
I'm curious if anyone saw that coming (some were close!) - show of hands?
In the upper corner of that page a quintain was scrawled, some parts underlined:
– Harry, stammering: “I might have, er, called you

should not like chess.” He tilted his head up to look at the version of himself. “How about a game of Exploding Snap instead?”
With one last look at the lovey-dovey couple (ugh), Draco made for the barn once more. One final circumnavigation would do.
The other boy smiled sadly. “My parents.”
“Sorry, yeah. I'm just super uncomfortable with the idea of another version of me.”
Obviously. Bummer that Potter never seemed to think before he spoke. That had its perks at times, but mostly not.
Draco felt relief flooding his body, but he quickly dampened it down. “I didn't ask for your approval, Weasel, but I'll take it into account that you acquiesce,” he sniffed.
Harry was happy to latch onto the not-so-gruesome topic of jam. “It
“Let's go then,” suggested Mabel. As if Draco had another choice.
She looked at Ron who arched an eyebrow, cast a quick glance at the Slytherins and then shrugged miniscule. That meant that he left the decision to her, trusting her to do the right thing. In that moment, Hermione's heart swelled from pride and warmth.
He smiled down at the serpent, feeling suddenly chipper and full of energy. “Just you wait and see, I'll bring him next time, that's a promise.” His grin widened. “Thanks for the talk. You're not a bad listener.”
Yet the prefect only seemed to concentrate harder. “Try freeing us next,” he instructed through gritted teeth, slightly shaking their hands on the mug.
that he needed to be with him, from the bottom of his heart.
She turned while continuing to scurry away, now walking backwards. “Of course we're going with him, right, Seeker?” She didn't wait for a reply. “And in case you were wondering, yes,
“It's a draw! Maybe we can make it a duel next time, at Midnight!” Harry laughed, but something tucked at the back of his mind at these words. Midnight duel, there was something. Something...
Just a few strokes and he had slipped between the bars and busied himself with the opening mechanism.
“Aha, so, gut feeling,” summarised Harry, nodding. “And Gee?” He looked at Half.
It starts mischievous like the participants of The Hunt, playing and partying.
means joy, radiance and is pronounce
Draco skipped stones frustratedly, while Granger had sat down on a piece of grass with a Warming Charm.

Strange.
“And you never would have; only members of The Hunt are even aware. Thusly it will stay forever. My curse is for me alone to know as I have to bear it alone as well. But let's just say that those scorch marks on my boots are not by chance, if you get my drift. I can't really say any more, but both our,” he pointed at Holle and himself in turn, “'restrictions' were put upon us for... misdemeanour... towards the powers that be.”
“Hermione, what is
“That... makes sense,” said Draco slowly.
The storm-grey hippogriff didn't seem convinced, orange eyes burning holes into Draco.
house. It's your bedroom.”
Crabbe wasn't on here. Of course not. How weird to think that he should be. Maybe Harry could ask Draco for a picture of their (newly) mutual friend...? He would have to talk with him about the gang eventually, about Crabbe. Harry sighed. Even with the memories of Crabbe's character in life back, Harry could not resent the bulky boy anymore. After all, Harry had been with Ember and Ember, though dark and eerie at times, had turned out to be a true friend. Harry would not forget that.
“Well, then how about
Potter had been so bland: a poorly dressed, scrawny boy with unkempt, windswept hair who could barely get out a whole sentence. He had been a no-one to Draco and yet even so, Potter's green eyes had captured Draco's interest and without knowing who the other boy was, Draco had decided to keep tabs on him.
should have listened to the Slytherin, he was not about to admit it. Also, somehow, hearing his own voice say things like that about Malfoy bothered him immensely...
“Guess that went south,” Cassius shrugged and grinned. “Nice doggy though, Weasley. Looked a bit like Dash, my neighbour's pup. He is such a nice little dog I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!”
It started with a hum in the air, then suddenly there was a deafening thunderclap and in the distance a cloud appeared over the waters. In it Draco could make out dozens and dozens of people of all ages –  many on horseback, many afoot, some dressed in strange costumes, some almost naked –, accompanied by flocks of dogs, pigs, seafowl and owls. Straining his eyes against the increasing onslaught of snowflakes and hail, Draco saw the leader: a single tall rider on a white horse accompanied by a flying woman.
The sooty babysitter glanced up. “Why... are you asking me?”
Death crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked a bit like a petulant little child while doing so. “You boys think you're so smart and, admittedly, comparatively you are. But do you honestly expect that we'd believe even for a second, Draco would let you come here alone? After everything? I mean, we can't see him, since you cleverly put the Invisibility Cloak on him, but I bet Sleipnir that he's standing right next to you. So, maybe it's time to drop the masquerade.”
“I could use a snack. For a job well done,” Malfoy shrugged and Harry followed suit.
Thankfully, Headmistress McGonagall had found a way to have Harry's painted self permanently under a sleeping spell after Rita Skeeter had tried to pry information from him during the re-opening celebrations. This way, the blabbermouth painting couldn't give away private details to just anyone and only a select few knew the 'password' to wake up Portrait-Harry.
“Maybe it's time to face it, so you can let it go,” Death suggested, not unkind.
“There. Can I have my, er, I mean, Potter, can I have Potter back, please?” Malfoy held out one hand in demand.
“Worse,” nodded Nott solemnly. “Malfoy, you have to talk some sense into him. You're the only one he will listen to at this point.”
The Weasel blinked. “My best friend Poover?”
“I wasn't. But that wasn't what you thought I thought you thought. Really, you have to stop trying to lie to me. I know you inside out.”
“It'll work. Just trust me on this one.”
And then they were dancing in the starlight, tumbling over the benches, giggling and forgetting all sorrow. For a moment they were young and free and endless. Oh, the pure glory to be alive!
Pansy grinned and strangely, so did Granger. The know-it-all winked at her. “Okay, but make it quick, Ron.”
Well, Draco would not look away this time. He couldn't. There was a baby to save.
on Christmas and why would you care what happened to
Harry kissed the corner of Draco's mouth. It was hard to concentrate on anything other than that. “Scarhead is...” Draco shuddered.
Right, they had talked about that before. Seeker, while not being dead, was slowly getting there with the knots of his bracelet turning red, Dreamer's bracelet however was still as pristine white today as it had been the day they had picked her up. That was because their circumstances were different.
Really, that person. Harry rolled his eyes. “Back to square one then. At least we know what doesn't work. That's something.”
“Weird, in the past, a snake would have made me think of Slytherin, now it only reminds me of him... all I do these days is think about him,” the apparition said and Seeker finally shook out of his reverie. Of course the other boy was talking to Anguis.
In front of Seeker's eyes danced little stars of fury. It took all of his self-restraint not to hit the ginger again. He took deep, deliberate breaths, then grunted out: “Explain.”
Pansy couldn't help but snort. “Oh please, Weasel, don't pretend like you can think on your own. We all know Granger does the brainwork in your trio.”
I know heaven doesn't blame me
“The irony,” Harry dead-panned and was pleased when that earned him a chuckle from the other boy. Good. Genuine laughter was what looked best on Malfoy after all.
See you all around the....
, there now was nothing and the words on the front never changed, redly glowing their
“Stop it!
There were more pressing things to discuss though than Holle's fetish for weird names.
“Oh my, had no one told you yet?” Wolfe squealed scandalised. Then she continued, piping down a bit: “It's not as bad as it sounds. See, we all are dead. It's sad, sure. I mean, look at us, all so young and pretty.” (Ember snorted.) “But it's okay. You're among friends. We knew you before, we'll stick together after. We'll take care of you.”
“That's a bit crazy.” Harry had given up on the bread. It felt like he'd sooner break off a tooth than some of the crust.
“Unless she had reasons to. Perchta can be odd at times,” Wolfe mused. “Maybe she thought it funny.”
The first few weeks after Harry had come back had been wild. Still waking up confused sometimes, needing a moment to sort their memories, had been just a small part of it. People had been writing, Floo calling or (if they knew how) dropping by. There had been an endless coming and going. There had been a lot of hugs and tears for Harry and a lot of claps on the back for Draco.
The saved Saviour's eyes locked on Draco's.
Draco swallowed. If Potter hadn't come for him, back in the Room of Requirement, he would have burnt. Like Vincent.
The spirit nodded solemnly.
– how cool is that? Yet it doesn't reveal them now. So?”
“Fuck!” Bloody Hunt magic and Hunt rules and Hunt everything. Seeker was so done with this. He'd been almost content for a while, but now... that boy... enough was enough. “I don't care what you say: I'm going back.”
Coming back from their trip, they had made good on their promise to Myrtle and had had, during ever-falling October rain outside, a surprisingly fun tea party at Hogwarts.
So, if you don't care for stuff like that then thank you for reading Storm Chasers. If you are a bit like me and always curious about what the author's intentions were and such then go ahead.
“I remember this place!” Potter cried and moved excitedly on Draco's head.
For an endless second, the impact of the sudden appearance froze Draco in place, rendering him unable to move, to talk, to blink. All he could do was stare at Harry green-eyes-black-hair-glasses bloody Potter, eye-to-eye. Eternal. Gone.
“And around Dreamer,” Seeker supplied, chuckling. The snow was coming down hard now.
On the next day they would... do nothing. What bliss.
) secondary and tertiary themes.
, can you believe it? Winky. But you're not so far off yourself now are you?” He winked conspicuously at Draco, who felt himself pinking and wished he could hurl hexes at this dimwit. At least it was reassuring that the 'boyfriend' running gag still seemed amusing to the redhead, even after remembering everything.
funny.”
It had been a fun afternoon, with lots of jokes and laughter. It had almost felt like they were back to being innocent children, unburdened by the weight of war.
“What happened then?” Draco's whisper floated like a shout through the trees.
Draco hung his cloak on a clothes hook and headed for the nursery.
Inside was a sort of brick-built hallway. Its walls had a certain curve to them, so that the gallery was most likely making a perfect circle around whatever was hidden behind the inner wall.
get out?
Colourful leaves were falling when the gang spent an enjoyable afternoon in September with an artwork contest, during  which everyone needed to try building something out of nuts.
Ember was in the middle of putting reins on BraveHeart's horse Grapes. He turned around. “You want me to ride with you again?”
“What's going on?” Draco tugged himself free.
“A door or entrance to a staircase. I saw it on the map and then it was gone. When we can find the entry, maybe we can find out what happened to Harry and Malfoy.”
Honestly, it hurt my brain to figure that out and I'm not sure I did it right and if you have a different opinion, I would love to hear your reasoning. I just went like this: Sirius said that Arthur is his second-cousin once removed and Molly his cousin by marriage, whereas Draco is  Sirius' cousin Narcissa's son. After drawing a crude family tree, fourth cousins once removed is what I came up with.
The redhead gaped at him as if Draco had just sprouted wings, and remained like that unblinkingly until his sister came up from behind, throwing an arm around the Weasel's shoulders. “Who is– What do
“Come again?”
It was only when the newly engaged duo had left Draco's kitchen that he started to wonder. Why exactly had he become involved with the Golden Couple?
Draco's fingers drilled holes into Harry's upper arm and Harry suddenly wondered if Draco could even see anything at all. Must be horrifying to have this kind of conversation in absolute darkness. Soothingly, Harry put a hand over Draco's invisible one and cast a nonverbal
Draco stared uncomprehending, but Ron at his side dissolved into a new burst of giggles, making Draco frown. “I don't get it. What's so funny?” How he hated to be outside their little in-jokes sometimes.
Draco would not lose them all though. He had promised himself that he wouldn't. His rituals would carry him through till Yuletide when he would finally get Potter and all the missing memories back.
Something was going on and Draco was speedily getting annoyed with having no idea what.
“And is she...” Thomas hesitated, but Draco understood what he was being asked.
Draco had never actually spoken to Sir Nicholas and thus he knew that he should be polite, but the words simply tumbled out of his mouth. “I need to find the Headless Hunt. Do you know where it is?”
He swallowed, pushing away the uprising memories of the cemetery. He couldn’t afford to drown here. There was something that needed clarifying though.  “Still,” the quiet word hung between them as if he had shouted it, “I'll always rather have you alive and annoying.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Weasley. Merry…” He just couldn’t. “Happy holidays.”
“And you are like my son, our son,” Harry said firmly and gave him an encouraging smile, “which is why I want you to have this.” He held out the Cloak for Teddy to take. “It's a family heirloom.”
Draco wiped discretely a tear from his cheek (which was futile, since he left a streak of lake water on it instead). Everyone in the circle had silently started weeping and for a moment, the water felt boiling hot for the pain of the merpeople.
Harry let himself be tugged down eventually and in the fire's light, he could finally read the writing printed across the masked boy's grey T-shirt:
Draco nodded stiffly. Everyone looked at him expectantly now, so he eyed warily the thing she'd given him.
Shit, shit, shit. Risking a glance over his shoulder, Harry saw that Malfoy was still in hot pursuit.
There was no answer.
He owed Potter. He owed him for so many things.
“But who exactly is–" Harry was cut off.
Draco was stumbling yet again, holding tighter to Harry's side and showing extraordinary amounts of bravery for a Slytherin, because only Harry could see the faint glow leading their way. For Draco it was like walking blind and it said
They were close enough now to make out single riders and Draco started scanning for a tiny bundle.
Meanwhile, Harry's kidnapper turned out to be a house-elf as well. Apparently dressed in nothing but a long, matted wig of ash-blond hair that had luckily tangled in all the right places to hide certain bits of the wrinkly body. Tillie had to be very old.
“Malfoy, meet my grandmother. Gran, this is my former schoolmate, Draco Malfoy.”
So, they sat down, chatted and had biscuits. Even Myrtle joined in, after they had invited her into the conversation, when before she had been sulking in a corner for not having been asked.
They dispersed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry looked up, startled. “You knew?”
It was the saddest and most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen.
“Er, is something the matter?” he asked nervously. “I didn't say anything.”
Hermione blinked once in surprise to Potter's choice of seat, then cleared her throat. “You must understand, after The Wild Hunt took you, we all sort of forgot about you.”
“Seems like they opened the dance floor. I'll see if Angelina wants to boogie!” George was quickly retreating towards the crowd. Over his shoulder he shouted back to them: “Are you coming?”
Death's remark about the scorch marks had reminded Harry of something Ember/Crabbe had said about Berchthold way back:
A small bird bath at the bottom of the monument refilled with water.
He shook his head. Another missing piece.
How lucky that Headmistress McGonagall liked to read and had her own private collection at hand in her chambers.
No one had shown me the way
“Hello, Snowdrop, you're my only real friend here,” Seeker said in a lamenting tone, purposely ignoring the still giggling other players.
“This is our phone. As I explained to you before, it works somewhat like a Floo call: You can talk to someone who is far away. Now, you hold it like so,” she demonstrated putting the thing next to her face and Draco cringed, because if it was like Floo the flames would certainly burn him this way, “one end towards your mouth, one towards your ear. And then you just talk.”
Ron blinked, taken aback. “It is?”
When finally all four of them sat around the table again, steaming beverages in front of each, they picked up the conversation anew.
Somewhen Things... Harry had the strange feeling he should probably tell the others that not only the wreath was glowing for him but also the pond. But there was something else that had caught his interest. “Hold on. Does that mean – do you guys also not remember your life before you came here?”
However: “Not laughing at all. You guys are a perfect match. Seriously, mates, I'm happy for you.” And then there had been lots of hugging.
Put off his stride by the discovery of his dead schoolmates, Draco had lost valuable seconds and now the vanguard had reached him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Still... He was kinda... possessive, wasn't he?” Potter fidgeted and Draco purposefully stayed silent.
called Carl?). Even though the redhead was just as bad as Draco (he'd seen the ginger talk to the my-crow-wife), Granger fondly rolled her eyes at both of them an equal amount of times.
They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the merchieftainess in the middle. Nobody spoke for some minutes.
They both stared at it in surprise and for a long moment that was all that happened. Then the trick stair opened up and swallowed both boys whole, plunging them into the darkness underneath.
“Hilarious.” Pansy rolled her eyes once more, exaggeratedly.
Snowdrop landed back on his shoulder, nibbling lovingly at his left ear, while his unnamed new companion huffed warm air into his right one.
Harry felt a bit sorry for him and a lot of annoyance with himself for even thinking that. “How do you know?” he asked instead, watching with furrowed brows as Malfoy's slender body started to tremble ever so slightly from the effort of keeping himself supported.
Draco was close to bursting into hysterical laughter. What had he expected? He pushed his rising panic down.
Draco's brow furrowed. What
Half didn't blink. “Humour us.”
They stared at each other for a long second, both marvelling about the miracle that brought them back together.
Wolfe snorted. “You
At least the cheering-up had worked.
“Moo-vee? Forget it – you simply thought of her and she materialised? But this is impossible! You're having me on.”
Grinning, Harry picked up a squeaking, caught off-guard Draco and pushed the bedroom door open. “Mhm, are you now? Care to elaborate?”
“I thought you were working.” Harry arched an eyebrow, amusement in his tone, and sipped the hot beverage, sighing contently.
Queen Harry wrinkled his nose. “Pawn to C-3. Oh, but
“Now, about Berchthold's curse, I made the Deathly Hallows to break it. Quite simple, really, all you have to do is–”
“So,” Lacie rounded on Malfoy, “what did it bring for tea?”
missed – and you apparently.”
Seeker nodded.
The castle was full to the brim with people when the four of them stepped into the Entrance Hall. Everyone had come to celebrate the grand re-opening of Hogwarts.
It was an unusually sunny day and Draco, frustrated by the daily dose of non-results, decided to take a walk.
There was a faint grunt and Harry wondered how many more new people he would have to meet today until he could finally get some rest. But still, his curiosity got the best of him and he peeped over his marshmallow-on-stick that Wolfe had just handed him, at the mysterious 'Amber girl' that must have been sleeping behind the horses.
“I'M NOT
“Right, sorry. The thing is, we all recognised you as a Somewhen Thing, as someone we had met before. You were one of us from the moment you stepped into our group and therefore we wanted to spare you heartache. Hunt magic is very peculiar, there are many mysteries about it. One of which is the fact that newbies sometimes arrive with remnants of memories, but they will without a doubt eventually lose them all over time. We just helped to hurry that process along in order to make you forget about wanting to leave, so you wouldn't be disappointed.”
Malfoy grinned. “It's about an annoying guy who always gets himself into trouble.”
. But thanks anyway. I appreciate it,” Draco ended awkwardly, not meeting the ginger's eyes.
Harry snorted. “Thanks ever so much. Now, do you want to explain to me what on earth a Wental Mell is?”
They were almost standing shoulder to shoulder and Draco glanced quickly at Potter's face, before averting his eyes back onto the cloak. “Your things weren't here. Only this fellow. Every personal belonging that indicated your existence had been eradicated. You weren't even mentioned in any of the books about the war.”
No, she could not. Time to divert. “Where's the Old Runes section then?”
Now, during setting-in dusk, Seeker was tired of the pranks. He grumbled under his breath, brushing feathers off his clothes. It had been such a nice game!
“Oh, that's a good name for her,” cooed Wolfe and leant over the baby. “As she will never wake...” Her face fell for a moment. “Well, what about this one then?” She tried to sound cheerful, but everyone heard her swallow. She was gesturing towards the hellhound, lying curled up in a ball at Ember's left knee, eyes on Dreamer.
Looking between the three of them, Harry had the distinct feeling that he was missing something. “What's going on?”
A new dawn had come.
“It will be quick.” Harry dismissed the yelling with a wave of his hand. “They can't hold me this time. I know it. I'll be back in half an hour – with baby Dreamer. That's what we dubbed her.” The coincidence with Dreamer was still weird to him, but then maybe not: After all, Draco had heard about her while hunting Harry... He shook the thought and made for the door.
“Master Malfoy,” whispered Elsie and her huge eyes were turned pleadingly at her sister. “M?”
Harry was more than enough, thank you), but had relented when being faced with two sets of Potter puppy eyes.
The old man gave him a scrutinizing look, his wide, pale eyes unblinking. “How curious.”
, he has to be unlocatable.”
“To help you,” Draco whispered. He felt his chest tightening. What had he done leaving Gregory alone for so long? The boy just wasn't built to take care of himself.
Everyone but Draco.
“That,” Ember remarked, fumbling with his robes, “was
“Divide the group,” he told Half and turned to BraveHeart at his side. “Do you still have the flag?”
“My father was the merchieftain. That is him.” The storyteller nodded at the statue in their backs.
The raven-haired rider frowned and pulled on the reins, making his ghost horse prance in a half circle. It seemed as if he considered coming down and Draco wished desperately he would. Yet a moment later, the huntsman went on, urged on by the gang of Draco's deceased peers.
Really, though, why should he? Draco frowned. It wasn't as if he would particularly miss Potter's annoying presence. Neither would anyone else, now that they didn't remember him anymore. Therefore, no one could blame Draco for not having done anything about it. Seriously, why bother? Let Potter sort this one out himself.
“The infant was attached to its mother when she died. She unknowingly took the baby along when she crossed over. But she didn't take it further, into the next realm. Now this nursling is caught between worlds, sleeping forever. Not dead, but not really alive either, sort of in a coma. It's a real shame.” For once there was no mirth in Half's eyes.
glass. It had since stayed that way, as the window was not a priority.
“Potter!” Draco hissed scandalized and yet couldn't tear his eyes away from the well-toned amount of bare skin on display. “What do you think you're doing here?” And
“Until they found us out.”
I had the lyrics but not the melody
There had been talk about research. Harry's curiosity was too strong to resist a peek, so with a regretful glance at the closed bedroom door, Harry slipped into the library instead.
“Rules are rules, Potter,” Malfoy lectured, only to continue, still awkwardly hanging head-down, “and before I forget it: fifty points from Gryffindor for breaking school regulations and resisting punishment.”
Malfoy huffed. “Spoken like a true hero. You would even help your enemies out of the...” Malfoy’s voice trailed off. He coughed slightly and tensed. The unusual wording caught Harry’s attention and he furrowed his brows. Maybe Malfoy’d thought along the same lines as Harry: about the ever-present sword of Damocles that was Voldemort’s return and also the current toad regime.
“Okay.” Thomas fidgeted. “I guess you can tell me your progress on Saturdays then. Because Patchers' Quidditch is going to be a weekly thing.”
“Right, I was getting there.”
“...sure.” Draco looked helplessly at Granger, half awaiting to hear a 'Gotcha' from either of them, but the girl simply kept on radiating happiness.
An apology was good. It would have to be enough. “Thank you. I think I needed to hear that.”
“Thank you, love. Pawn to D-5.”
Malfoy's spell was reflected by an invisible dome protecting the three house-elves.
“Isn't that just fantastic.” Ron rubbed the shoulder Hermione had just walked into. “Seriously, how does Harry always get into these weird things?”
The more important question now was, how to get him back.
The corners of his eyes were burning. It was bad enough to be stabbed with words like that, but even worse that it was Potter. Draco had thought they would get along now. He had thought they were good. But that Potter still thought of Draco like that... Death Eater... Bloody Merlin, get a grip, Draco, crying won't bloody help.
So Seeker found himself wandering back to the gang's camp fire after having petted Lightning for a bit (though Lightning had seemed to be far more interested in munching on some of the left-over feathers still sticking to Seeker's wardrobe).
“I think it's a great idea,” Cassius said jovially. “Let's do it and while we wait for his reply we can have a look at the Mell's opening. See if we can gain access. It's in the dungeons, near our common room.”
Ronald, balancing a small tray with biscuits and a teapot on one hand, whooshed his wand to float cups to every one of them.
“...you saw that, huh?” Embarrassment twisted Harry's stomach into knots.
There's an actual Berchthold's Day in Switzerland and Liechtenstein on January 2nd.
Harry, sensing the approaching storm, put a hand on Draco's knee, smiling. “I told you they are shit.”
For being so terribly late with this chapter - I'm so sorry!
said you don't want to be her friend, so I can–”
The three boys exchanged silent looks.
Right, so Harry had heard: The big circular, observational window into the lake had been shattered during The Battle of Hogwarts. While immediately fixed in order to not flood the whole castle, the spell that had been used had turned out to have the permanent effect of leak-proof but
Another flashback chapter. Have fun with it~
“What?” Harry watched them irritated as they all burst into another peal of laughter.
There were a lot of 'whats' that Draco could think of in that sentence. Starting from the fact that he didn't like to be ordered around. Mostly though: “How do you know about the old  Black house at Grimmauld Place, Granger?”  And where had he recently heard this name before, Draco wondered.
Between his vibrant and vivid companions, the soot boy was like a cloud of darkness that absorbed the surrounding light. Harry shifted as far away as possible. Ember made him uneasy.
“Let's get this over with,” Draco hissed between grit teeth.
Reading on, he found more trivia.
– and held my hands and held my gaze and said she didn't regret anything and that we would find our Yonder Hill.”
= "Hi, my name is Draco Malfoy. Ah, do you speak English?" (Swedish)
Just then, a white dog, its red ears flapping, slid next to Lightning. Its fur looked fluffy, so Harry moved to touch it.
drawled Malfoy and elongated the syllable so it sounded like 'you are very stupid, you know?'.
Anguis shot forward with the apparent idea of wrapping himself around the blond boy's leg, all while hissing a battle cry.
“Because she did not die unborn?” duh-d Half, hair sticking up in wild angles. “Because she's still alive?”
= "Before you..." (French)
“So, you're saying,” Pansy's voice shook with anger and low fear, “that none of the Hogwarts house-elves can get to that place where our friends are most likely
“I said stop, you plonker!” Draco shoved at Potter's shoulder which finally got him an annoyed grunt.
“I'm the master of Death,” Harry mocked.
“Fuck,” breathed Malfoy softly and stared incredulously at the queen who had fished down the crown from the top of his arm-chair and had draped it on his perfectly styled hair.
“Nuh-uh, if I do all your homework, how will you learn?” Harry wiggled his index finger and then paused, puzzled. Somehow this didn't sound like him all that much, rather as if he had borrowed someone else's words.
They had reached the second floor and upon opening several doors (one of which was a cosy looking bedroom that had, despite the abandonment of the house, a warm, lived-in feeling to it) they had finally found Grimmauld Place' private library. A room which turned out to be big, naturally lit and somewhat friendly, with a round fluffy rug dominating the spacious middle between walls and walls filled with books. To Draco though, it seemed a bit weird that there was basically no dust to be seen anywhere.
"So, how's your family?"
Ron stared at her as if she were a chocolate cake. “Hermione, you are brilliant. Pure and simple.”
That pillock Malfoy blushed and Harry was so done.

impressed). “And where do we find reading material about Helga's Tea Room, oh great wise man?”
“Er...” The Weasel looked helplessly between a fuming Hermione and a dumbfounded Draco. “I thought I did?”
The bookworm turned to her boyfriend. “Really? Do you have a library at The Burrow?”
Draco's head popped up in mid-air. “Okay. But I don't see why
Wolfe turned her head that was mounted with a hilarious hairdo à la Half. “
“I didn't do it for
Draco jumped at the opportunity. “Professor! Good that you're here. Potter is in trouble!” He held his breath.
“Yes, we need to find him. Can you help us? Oh, but his name is Potter.”
Funny how the tables had turned.
The other boy snapped his mouth shut. “As you wish, Potter Perfect.”
dragons.”
in the first place.” He headbutted Harry.  “Also, not a cushion, Potter.”
Aha. Harry's dearest wish was a dragon. Not a nice unicorn maybe or a way back home, nope,  a fire-spewing monster. Awesomesauce.
Softly, snow started falling, sticking to Draco's eyelashes.
Then again, if this was the answer (and Draco nearly stumbled at this thought), did
did, on purpose. Is that enough to be cross with you, you think?” Potter was gaining momentum.
“Yes, but in case all our notes disappear overnight,” (A howl from the ginger.) “Malfoy needs to be able to recall everything we've found out today. Besides, you and I keep forgetting things, so repetition is key in this case, wouldn't you agree?” She gave her boyfriend a stern look.
apologise or what?”
“Better yet if you didn't talk to us,” floated Granger's mumble over to them.
“Ah, yeah, Harry tried that once,” Weasley scratched his nose. “Didn't go so well. He nearly got caught by Snape.”
Harry though had only eyes for one person.
Draco swallowed. He deserved this – and so much more. “I won't come then. I'll stay clear.”
Harry was confused. “Except for, if this were a dream you wouldn't

He sat upright, anger flaring up. “She is nice, okay? Like, really nice! And you, what? Can't even bother to say hello, just because you–”
“No, no,

library. A house just for books,” she added when seeing the puzzled faces of the boys.
And suddenly he was flying. Different arms, a different boy, but the same smell.
“And you just told me, you'd seduced me to curry favour with the public. Draco, really, I never knew you were so insecure.”
“Where are your cronies anyway?”
indeed had it. Yet the quiet voice was drowned out by the atmosphere of the celebrations which lasted well into the early hours of the next day.
He looked up, but it was all dark overhead, except for the tiny twinkling stars of the rhinestones. There was not the faintest glimmer of the trick stair they'd fallen through. Getting up back there would be so fun... not.
Wow, half-time O.O
“What is The B–” Draco started, but Harry cut in: “I'll tell you later.” That would be another
“Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Peeves is not a dead person?” Weasley's eyes were wide as saucers and Draco silently wondered how he himself never knew all that. These were indeed 'eye-openers'.
Harry blinked rapidly. Had he heard that correctly?
“I could do with a late night snack,” announced the Weasel, putting an arm around Granger. Right, Potter had mentioned that they were going out now. Weird.
What have you done with Potter?”
Ron pulled his own coin from his pocket and showed it to her, and really, the message had appeared as it should have.
Draco leant forward and closed the gap between their lips. “And you're sure you're better now?”
“It's not like that!”
The procession started departing again, fast.
The green-eyed boy turned to look at Draco over his shoulder, his face veiled in abysmal sadness. The breeze picked up his fringe and momentarily, a lightning-shaped scar was visible.
Breathing heavily as if he'd just run a marathon, Harry simply lay there, Malfoy half on top of him, and took stock of all his joints. Still in one piece. Thank goodness.
“A potter? In Hogwarts? What would they need a potter for?” disdained Stuck-Up.
“Everyone ready to rumble?” Half's peppy voice was harsh in the suddenly up-picking storm winds.
“Something's wrong with this place.” Malfoy scrunched up his nose in frustration, glaring at his wand as if it was its fault.
A loose, copied book page fell out of the notebook.
It was as if a breeze of silence hit the loud Hunt and even the ignoramuses sensed that something was going on.
Draco shifted a bit further away. “You said you didn't remember us during your time with The Hunt. So
Draco squawked and fished the transgressors hand out from under his shirt.
They did as they were told. One moment, Dreamer in Ember's arms lay cheek to cheek with her living body in her fathers embrace, the next moment, the spirit baby rolled over, put her tiny hand to the real baby's shoulder and – just kept rolling, until the whole Dreamer had vanished inside the other one.
Of course. “And that's why Holle and the moss folk called me 'Master' and she gave me a bloody
"You don't see her?" Wolfe asked from his left.
Draco gulped. Being honest, saying out loud what he really felt... how long had it been? But could he? Could he be open with Potter?
Draco gently brushed a lock from the scarred forehead. “For giving me a chance. For us.”
“What?” Wolfe had just finished lighting a fire and turned to see what Harry was referring to. “Oh, that is Spillalutsche's Stone.”
“Someone with manners and... other skills,” offered the alternative Harry and smirked at Malfoy, who pulled a face and proceeded to watch the autumn leaves fall over the newcomer's shoulder.
As Draco states somewhere there are at least 20+ names for each of the two Hunt leaders. I chose by random or more precisely I chose those names I liked best from the heap.
“–and added a Speed Spell–” Granger developed the thought further.
“Potter? What potter?” The small man blinked owlishly.
Harry had stopped between two broad trees. There, almost hidden under debris, was the source of the faint glow they'd been following.
This song is more a Harry-with-The-Hunt Theme.
Halting in front of the entrance to the common room, Harry finally pushed the thought away. He knew the hidden door to be behind a bare stretch of stone wall in the dungeons, although it had been years since he'd been in this particular corner of Hogwarts. He grinned; back then he had also come here because of Malfoy, even though at that time Harry had been wearing a Goyle-costume.
“No one knows about that but you, me, Ron and Hermione. And we didn't tell anyone.” A breeze ruffled Harry's hair and he shuddered involuntarily as the memory of the Fiendfyre resurfaced.
Harry furrowed his brow. “Write what down exactly?”
? You know what? Forget it. I simply wanted to give this back to you.”
Draco had hoped that with the promising amount of references to The Hunt in several books from the three libraries, they would make fast progress and have Potter home for dinner time. However, the longer the research took the more Draco had realised that it wouldn't be so easy after all. Stories about The Hunt were strewn all over, some in unreadable griffonage, some in foreign languages. He dealt with the French ones and Granger had some ideas about others here and there, but they all stumbled over German texts that were few and far between for the apparent reason that the fable of The Hunt seemed to have been first written down by famous Muggle fairy tale teller Jacob Grimm (a fact that had earnt Draco a suspicious glance from the redhead). Draco's stomach churned at the thought of Potter all alone with blood-thirsty horror characters in a group of ghosts. Nothing to be done now though. Potter would take care of himself somehow. Draco had to believe that and work towards his rescue as fast as possible – even if that meant starting at snail's pace at the moment.
Oh Draco, what did you fantasize about? Wake up, boy, nothing will change.
“Mhm,” Draco hummed, pleased with himself, and inspected the perfect fit. “But you better take that off before we visit my parents tomorrow. That is, if we want a mostly scene-free brunch.”
In the last rays of the day, the dust inside the old barn sparkled like tiny stars as they rushed past stacks of hay and a dirt-stained farm tractor.
“That's right,” Wolfe confirmed, petting the dog of the gang. “So, call this one, too!”
“Thank you,” the Ronald-Weasel said sincerely, taking the wind out of Draco's sails. The redhead gazed tenderly at his wife. “Love can make you do crazy thing, but in the end, love always wins, doesn't it?” Draco's brows furrowed. Something about this sentence... But he had no time to pursue the thought, as the ginger continued: “Speaking of The Burrow – you're still coming for lunch tomorrow, yeah?”
Still deep in thought, Seeker entered a lively park area, following Anguis.
cute. At all.
“That's not a creepy image
of all tables? Ugh.
“What I don't get,” said Cassius, chewing his lower lip, “is how they could be on that amazing map of yours one moment and then not anymore. I mean, that is a real piece of complex magic.” His eyes shone with excitement. “It shows where we are
Blood rushed in Seeker's ears so loudly he felt like he was drowning in the sound.
Well,
Death nodded slowly, clearly overwhelmed.
“I have some biscuits,” Harry quickly cut in and dug in his pockets, “and comfits. Want some? They're teeny though.”
“Except,” sighed Granger, “we're talking about our idiots that never stop fighting.
Pensively, he traced the silvery lines on the back of his hand: with the new meaning of bravery, his Umbridge-caused scars weren't as bad anymore either. Maybe... The Hunt had been good for him, in a way?
The firelight was painting Harry's features in a soft glow and Draco found himself  unexpectedly mesmerised by hearing Harry's low voice reading poetry to him. Wow, that was quite the find. He'd have to remember that for later.
“You tell me. Why did 'Scarhead' work as a name to free me?”
Lacie looked up. “Is Elsie done?”
The only reason the Stone works differently for Harry and Draco in the Forbidden Forest is the fact that Harry is then using his right as master of Death to summon Death. He does so with the help of the Stone, as the Deathly Hallows are still linked to Death somehow.
Harry gave him a stern look. “Draco Malfoy, you sly snake! You will
Life and Death gasped in unison.
“Well, that was something,” Seeker rasped, scratching his neck.
Harry/Seeker:   I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go.
, Parkinson.”
“Did you get them?” the Weasel asked giddily, coming around the table to greet his girlfriend.
It read:
Death cocked his head, looking thoughtful. “No, it was him.
“Thank you, thank you, Draco, thank you! I can't thank you enough!” Anne's father blubbered and gripped Draco's arm tightly. “And thank you all for taking care of her! Oh my little girl, I didn't think I'd see the day...” the rest was unintelligible sobbing.
To studious Mirela_Lupoaica, who felt inspired to be inspiring and did her own research about Holle (and also arranged for me to receive a fanletter! Hi, A.!). She gave me valuable information that I could use in this chaper.
“Wo-how!” Half wolf-whistled at Wolfe. “Yeah! That's my girl!”
Draco ran a hand through his hair. “I'll just have to make him then, right? After all, I'm not chasing storms all around the globe to come up empty-handed. I'll drag him back with me even if he's kicking and screaming. Yeah.”
“Finished off the Dark Lord?” Parrot number three. “No, that can't be right. I was a witness when that happened and it was not this... Puttel... you mentioned.”
Death exchanged a look with Holle on his shoulder. “You're taking that well. Seems like you were able to heal. That is good. You've matured a lot.”
Let me go! Fuck it!” Seeker struggled fruitlessly, tears of outrage over the backstabbing springing to his eyes . “You made me forget about what little I had left of my life! You made me forget about
“And that people will probably give you shit for dating me?”
“Got it?” Potter asked with a slightly arched eyebrow.
, The Wild Hunt. But that hadn't brought anything truly new.
“Let's go then,” Finnigan agreed for all of them.
As if Potter had read Draco's thoughts, he asked: “What is that? The shimmery thing?”
The blond bed head turned around to reveal red-rimmed, wild eyes, staring up at Harry. Draco really looked a bit deranged at that moment.
Hand outstretched to receive the china, Draco froze.
Malfoy made an undignified noise and pulled an exaggerated sulky face, which made Harry smile involuntarily.
here.”
It was a joke of course. Not even worth an answer, really. Yet Malfoy held out his hand for a moment too long and Harry thought 'Whatever' and took it.
Tentatively, the headmistress took the book and, after a silent moment of mutual staring, she opened it and skimmed the index for the right part.
Potter had a quiet laughing fit, shaking all of them, as they were each touching him with some part of their bodies. “It's just hilarious, because, haha, I got you, I got you a Remembrall!”
Draco had been a bit surprised when neither of his parents had tried to make him go with them. His mother had smiled sadly and kissed him on both cheeks. His father had simply patted him on the back. And then they had left.
at all, when he could have easily borrowed one of theirs.
Eyeing the tranquil pond with its midnight blue water, its ever-present soft bell chimes and its gentle Somewhen glow, Seeker couldn't help but be confused. “I don't get it.”
at the obstacle. It was some sort of stone wall. Reluctantly he let his free hand wander over the surface. It felt natural: bumpy and jagged. He pulled his hand back when it made contact with something slimy that turned out to be a sole, resting upside-down on the stone. Disgusting.
(See the end of the chapter for
by Granger (quite handy that Human Presence Revealing Spell, Pansy had to remember that one) that indicated no one but them was in close range. They grouped around a table in a secluded corner near the Invisibility section.
The other man looked distressed, but finally nodded once. “Yeah, okay. It's just– Draco and you were my parents. I always felt that way. Harry,” a single tear slowly slid down Teddy's cheek, “you're like a father to me.”
Harry's eyebrows knitted together. “I was born on a Thursday! ...I think.” He was increasingly annoyed by the renewed delight of his band of comrades.
Mabel gestured at him. “Just go with it. It's what we do when our mood is too sad. We can't have the lake grow much bigger, you see. So we have to distract ourselves when the tribe as whole feels like crying. And mother's stories often make us tear up. But they
He had stood a solid hour in front of the display, driving the shop assistant mental and in the end had picked a pair of old-fashioned round glasses. Potter-style. Not that he liked the unsightly things (or the boy usually wearing them, heaven forbid), but they served as a reminder. Like the badge, the pots, the pottery and Howard.
“I'll talk to him,” Wolfe offered, but before she had gotten out of sight, she turned around again and came back, followed by Ember who was carrying Dreamer in his large arms. Dog Scoffer accompanied the trio, seemingly excited at the sight of Mr. Withane as he yelped loudly when he saw the farmer and tried to jump up at him.
“Speaking of telling: What was that nonsense about calling people by their surname when you're not close enough? Just between us, Crabbe and Goyle are your best friends. Would be majorly weird if that was 'not close enough'.”
“Then we will be on our way. Ladies.” Malfoy walked backwards towards the door.
“He means Helga Hufflepuff, obviously.”
Mabel snorted. “That's all you have to say? 'Oh?'”
It wasn't that he couldn't have used some time abroad. But for Draco, going away at that point in his life would have meant never coming back. In his cell, he had had time enough to think about things in general and he had realised that so far he had always picked the easy way out. Yet this one time he didn't want to be a coward, he wanted to stick it out, get his life together.
“It's a Heal-All Oyster,” Mabel provided. “Just one bite is enough. Maybe it'll even re-size Harry here.”
Imagine a split-screen with one of them on either side.
!), he cleared up the tabletop with one hand. Picking up the small notebook, Draco knit his brows. Had he been writing something last night? He thumped through the pages but there was nothing, just milky white blankness.
“Er, yeah, alright.”
“Then how about another helping of pudding? Who wants some?” Mrs. Weasley was already on her way towards the kitchen and didn't even count the unanimously up-shooting hands. She paused in the doorway. “Would you like some as well?” She smiled at Draco.
have to make small talk now?
Therefore, a plan had to be made!
He rounded at the girl. “Did you know?” She winced and Seeker stared at her and then at the others, disbelievingly. “Did you
Draco felt very much made fun of as his feelings were brutally hurt. He started to sit up. “You know–”
“We better find a crossroads then,” Harry wrapped up the conversation. “See you at The Hunt?”
To Harry this was all weirdness, but everyone else seemed totally fine, so he watched them eat, his eyes gliding over to settle on the leaders of their cortège.
“You treated him like shit. He was constantly hurt!” Harry felt his anger rising like bile. “How about I shut
“They're not here,” voiced Granger what they all saw. “No one's here.”
“You know what really annoys me?” Potter purposefully stepped in the path of Draco hovering a little tree. “The fact that you always rectify your behaviour, always try to explain it all away:
Seeker laughed, infected by the sudden swing to happy mood. “What is all that about?”
A soft breeze carried hot air and laughter up the hill. Seeker felt the world tremble, just a bit.
“Again–"
“Headmistress!” Draco all but yelled. “I saw them with my own two eyes! But that's beside the point. Have you not heard what I just said?
No such luck.
sources, there still
“Give that here. There,” Draco held a page open for Harry to read, “doesn't this just
“I heard,” was all the reply Harry got and somehow this made him angry. He had thought that Malfoy was changing, trying to be more tolerant, but now his reluctance to meet Andromeda irked Harry tremendously.
“That really depends on the point of view.”
Well, fuck his life. Draco blushed crimson.
In The Hunt Harry had learnt to take things a bit easier, but that didn't mean he'd been as confident as he had let on. His nerves had been fluttering like crazy.
Potter's expression softened and Draco wanted nothing more than to run away. He would have, had his legs not decided to turn into jelly. This was embarrassing beyond compare.
“We're here. Just, please don't speak. I'm not in any danger, I think, but you could be, so stay hidden.”
“With pleasure,” she offered and was doubly pleased to hear Weasley's just-started snickering morph into a surprised cough. “No problem at all. It says here
“Draco Malfoy. Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy.” Draco could see himself reflected in the wandmaker's misty eyes. “I didn't expect to encounter you again, after our last meeting.”
Malfoy didn't really get a chance though because Slytherin Harry's fist crashed onto the tabletop and he hissed with an icy voice: “Nobody asked YOUR opinion! You're a filthy, Muggle-loving prat and have no clue how a real wizard should behave.” His ire cooled down as fast as it had erupted and he continued a lot softer: “I'm a superior version of you. The real Harry Potter. As you should be. Tell him, Draco. Tell him, I'm a much better fit for you. ”
Granger unfolded the letter and the owls settled on the well-opening to receive some praise and Owl Treats from Cassius.
“We didn't mean to. It was an accident, really,” Potter cut in. “Hello, up here.”
Draco rolled his eyes. Yes, yes, everyone had heard about the (completely stupid and unnecessary) heroics of Saint Potter during the first task. How very Gryffindor to not make winning the priority. This goody-goody nice guy routine was so...
In the meantime Wolfe and Half were sorting their group into protectors and captors.
“I give you 'talk', you bastard!” Every sentence was accentuated by a hex. “Let's talk about scarred Bill! Or poisoned Ron! Or tortured Hermione! Or – or F-Fred... you, you assh–”
about his trust in Harry that he followed him into a dangerous place, at night, sightless and without the whole puzzle at his disposal yet. Harry wanted to kiss him badly.
“It's no use. This table has some sort of spell-repellent or whatnot on it. Nothing works.” Frustrated, Harry threw his wand onto the tablecloth and growled at it. This was starting to feel like a crazy version of the mad tea party from Alice in Wonderland. At least Alice would have an idea.
it was too late. Huginn-Muninn here, the old softie, even granted you her crown with Somewhen Things and allowed the moss folk to give you hints about your life – to present  you with something worth living for. Worked, too, I'd say: When you came to us you were somewhat broken, but slowly you got better. We saw it every day. Also,” he wiggled his eyebrows, “we had high hopes for our secret weapon: Draco, don't you want to take off that cloak already?”
Draco found himself greeted by a dressed up Mother Weasley who hastily excused herself to look after various foods in the kitchen. That however implied under no circumstances that Draco was left alone – quite the contrary. Within seconds he found himself in the middle of a redheaded bundle, all talking across each other in the generously decorated living room.
Draco had to suppress a sneer – that thing was still alive? But it was very Longbottom. Nice to know some things never changed. Although, sometimes, change was the better way... “Visiting a friend. Greg actually. You?”
says so after everything then
“And you will tell us once I win?”
“Er, so,” Harry shook his head bewildered and tried to pick up the thread of the conversation, “he's a red queen?”
Harry felt warmth bubbling up inside him. This side of Malfoy was so rare. How was it suddenly so cute that Malfoy was looking out for his younger housemates? Harry frowned. Wait, what?
. Was that even imaginable? Yet, here Draco was at the receiving end of the oddest gaze by someone who should know Potter better than most people in this castle.
Greg looked lost. “Maybe you're wrong now?”
He sighed. “Look, Draco, I admit I heartily despised you when we were younger and I can't even pinpoint exactly when that changed, but change it did. Maybe I was a bit slow on the uptake and didn't quite realise at first that it was, you know,
told me to shower.” Completely unfazed, the intruder went to dig through Draco's wardrobe as if... as if it was
Time had really flown by and now, with ninety, Harry could look back on a turbulent life that had, in the end, left him with laughter lines and treasured memories.
Because what would we be without help? Woebegone, that's what. Therefore, upmost thanks to my grand beta
“I've never heard you talk as much as tonight,” he said instead, his voice pressed.
The old woman gave Harry a sharp look. “Feeling brave 'cause your lover holds your hand, eh?”
But he didn't.
“So I thought... maybe it would be nice to... have a place to... deal?”
Mr. Withane swallowed, his eyes fixed to the ruddy-cheeked infant in his arms. “Wake up, Anne.”
Harry cleared his throat. “I'm not sure I understand. See, I seem to have some problems with remembering correctly. Maybe you could help me by telling me where we are, how we got here and how we know each other? Oh, and also, why you want to give me a horse.”
Yeah, so maybe he hadn't been all that keen on revising Charms
Up ahead Draco could now see weedy Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass, arms crossed over her chest. They both looked anxiously at the shut door of Gregory's room.
“In here!” he yelled and within seconds a very upset Hermione appeared in the living room of number 12, Grimmauld Place.
A knock on the door interrupted him mid-sentence. Filius Flitwick popped his head in, dangling a bottle of wine and two long-stemmed glasses in one hand. “Good evening, Minerva! I thought you might be up for a nightcap? Oh! Mr. Malfoy, you're here, too? How lovely! Merry Christmas!”
The chalkboard listed pending tasks from the day before and Harry half-heartedly chose 'debris removal from the lake'. It didn’t matter what, he just needed something to get his mind off his nightmare.
Harry felt peaceful in a way he hadn't for a long time. He let his head drop on Malfoy's shoulder.
“Er, Malfoy, there is no right answer. That's the whole thing. It's a nonsense book.”
“Not your owl, silly, your baby,” she said, pointedly looking over at Ember and the sleeping child.
“Mhm,” hummed his interlocutor. “Much depends on the wand itself. The wand chooses the wizard after all. And it seems that this wand here chose to serve you fully once again after... Piggy... renounced his ownership.” Draco was very confused and very sceptical. It must've shown on his face. “You don't believe me? Well, have you noticed any difference in the performance of your spells after you got your wand back?” Draco slowly shook his head. “See? There you go.”
think about, because, ew, half-breed skin). Their abandoned horse just careered alongside them.
died.” It was a statement, not a question.
Harry was about to change his course when a big index finger pressed against his forehead, keeping him in place. “Ah-ah-ah~ Not so fast. It's too late to correct it. When you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences, Draco.” Queen Harry grinned like a lunatic. “It's H-3, which means... Red Queen to H-3: Off with his head!”
his teapot (pot, Potter, check) from the windowsill to place it on the bedside table. See if a little piece of mind magic would defeat a Malfoy. Ha! He'd show those stupid memories.
“Why is she not a moss person?”
“Any moment now,” he announced, rectifying his crown with perfectly manicured hands.
The list went on and on before Draco's eyelids drooped and he finally fell asleep – thoughts of Potter filling his head.
Suddenly Draco became aware of a low, steady beating of drums, humming around them in the water.
“Alright then. The thing is... Dobby, we seem to have lost Harry and,” Granger hesitated and glanced at the Slytherins, “another student. We can't find them in the castle. Could you maybe go and, erm, fetch them for us? Or at least find out their location, please?”
“Morning, Potter,” spoke a shadowy figure in a familiar drawl.
Instead, a feathered cannonball shot through the open kitchen window and fell into Draco's half-eaten breakfast.
Fuck. Draco really couldn't catch a break here. “Wait! I can explain!”
“Before that – about Potter...” He faltered. Mother Weasley kept smiling at Draco in the way of the oblivious. Draco gave up. “No, thank you. I must be going, I think.”
Two posh-looking envelopes came flying in through the door, landing safely in Draco's outstretched hand. He gave each of them the one with their respective names on it.
Harry felt guilty although he'd really only been gone for twenty minutes tops. Seeing Draco scared like that was unnerving, but also very heart-warming, in a twisted way: When Harry had been a child, there had been times when he'd been gone for hours and no one had asked after him at all. It was nice to have someone who cared. Of course, his friends cared for him, too, but somehow this felt different, safer, warmer.
“Of course I don't mind. But–” Potter got up and Draco lost his nerves, when he saw a hand reaching for him in his peripheral vision.
“Besides,” the redhead chimed in, “maybe for the wedding we can find you someone as well. You should get out there, start dating.” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
Until now.
Wolfe sharply inhaled and Harry followed her gaze back to Berchthold, who slowly raised his hand and pointed at the man.
“With whatever it is that made you come to The Burrow last night,” said Granger and started unlooping her red and gold Gryffindor scarf from around her neck. “None of us can remember clearly, but it must have been something big if you came to
She turned the portrait around so that all of them could see it: It was unmistakably Malfoy, his shoulders, the little curl of hair around his ears, yet the whole person was black, just a silhouette. Only over the chest was a blindingly white lightning bolt criss-crossing from the right shoulder almost down to Malfoy's left hip.
Take care~
did the fighting. It was bloody hero Potter who defeated the Dark Lord while you all just gawked at him. Did it with this very wand.” He held up his magic stick and twirled it around.
Porpoises and crocodiles though? Did they normally live in lakes...?
– they were speeding alongside her, which felt strange given their height difference (Mabel was about seven foot).
When his ride didn't answer, Harry took up the thread. “Still, it's cruel to have them take care of themselves. Being locked away like that. It's not right.”
which Ronald had recommended. It was disconcertingly entertaining to read.
Within all this admittedly insane conversation, this was the part that irked Harry most and he didn't even fully realise that his free hand had fisted Malfoy's cloak as he exclaimed, voice shaking:
“Well~, it was a
“Your idiot?” Harry offered.
“Yeah. I mean: yes!”
for helping me get my ass in gear. Thanks a bunch for the encouragement, it was very salubrious <3
Of course she was right and Seeker himself felt unsure about his next words, but he also thought that he should explain himself: “It's kind of the same thing as with The Beginning. You said it's not The End. Don't get me wrong, I don't want her dead or anything. I just want
Malfoy inhaled sharply. “Potter.”
One very memorable encounter among these had been the return of Kreacher early one January morning, coming back to Grimmauld Place to greet his master(s).
Not over something so stupid.” He was fisting the other boy's shirt now. “Greg, I'm begging you. You're my oldest friend, don't you know that? I can't lose you, too. Please, just... go to St. Mungo's with me. Please.” He faltered.
“He means Somewhen glow; it's around things or people riders have met before their death,” Harry elucidated quietly.
answered Seeker distractedly while watching Draco pulling out a small stick from his pocket. It looked a bit like the one Seeker had found in the back pocket of his own trousers. He had often thought about throwing it out, but it had such a nice length, just right for roasting marshmallows on. So he'd kept it.
The Weasel choked out a sob and sat up so quickly, sand was flying everywhere. “Enough! Hermione seriously, I wanted a day off, remember?”
Malfoy sighed and rubbed his forehead. “The window won't stay see-through, no matter what I try.”
Skidding on the stone tiles of the third floor Charms corridor, he dug his fingertips into a corner to use his momentum to propel himself around it. He was a fast runner, but he had only a slight lead and–
“Yes, I'm not deaf, you
“What's it say?” Hermione leant over his shoulder to have a look.
Weasley had propped himself up on his elbows and was watching Draco with rapt attention now. “So Piggledy fought in the war?”
!” yelped Draco maybe a smidge too loudly.
Draco hesitated for a moment.
They reached the edge of the water where Death and Life waited for them.
“She died in my arms. With her last breath she gave me the return gift for my 'heart', made me promise to take care of them. We had been waiting so long...”
Really now, Potter? This is what you're going with?”
?” Maybe Draco had died without realising?
He felt peaceful.
“You're an idiot.” The insult was spoken very gently. “It doesn't need words for an apology. You saved my life and you saved my freedom and every day you come here and don't treat me like a leper, you save my sanity. Look, Potter, I was angry at you back then. Of course I was. But I was also drowning in my own fear.” He lightly squeezed Harry's fingers. “I don't think I would have survived that night in the hospital wing if you hadn't been there, comforting me.”
“They disappeared.” She pointed at the place their dots had just been.
“The stars...?” Seeker tilted his head upwards, but of course, it was daytime and also the trees hindered his view. When had he last seen the stars though? Sure, during flying there had been sun and moon (and probably stars), but here inside the forest realm? At all times a big snow cloud hovered over the base camp at Holle's Pond, so... Really, it had been forever since Seeker had regarded a unveiled night sky.
Surprised, Harry scrunched up his nose. “Okay, but why did you want to let
the leader and he's her right hand man and which of them is riding in a  wagon if any at all? Moreover, does he hunt her or is she part of The Hunt? And what's with the story where houses built on old roads get trampled but people are safe as long as they stand exactly in the middle of the street? Also, The Hunt brings doom but sometimes it's a good omen? Same as that leader being described as a demon, yet protector of the poor? This all doesn't make sense!”
That surprised his interlocutor. “Yes. But how did you know? You really are more than meets the eye.”
“Hermione!” Ron came slithering into the common room, the Marauder's Map in one hand and Harry's Invisibility Cloak in the other. “Hurry! We need to go, save Harry! Come on!”
Peeling the gang members off, Harry smiled at the warm welcome: “Calm down, will you? I'm fine. Better than fine, actually. I'll tell you everything if you let me breathe. But, just, don't call me Seeker anymore, okay? I'm Harry again. Call me that. Oh and this is–”
Seeker rubbed furiously at his eyes, then sighed deeply.
Harry's move however triggered Malfoy to heartily elbow him. “Not yours either, Potter!”
The other boy cast his eyes down. “I didn't see you before. Believe it or not, the world doesn't revolve around you, oh Saviour.”
When he'd finished putting his stuff away, washing up and changing into his pyjamas, he dropped dead-tired onto the bed, face first.
At the time, fetching the book had seemed to be a good excuse to escape Hermione's iron-first rule of recapping for a few moments.
been doing it wrong (he'd done counterclockwise loops, no wonder it hadn't worked properly), he took in his companion's appearance. Potter looked tired. He always looked tired these days, but today even more so than normally. His skin had an unnaturally dull pallor to it and there were dark circles under his eyes.
Harry beamed. “So~ What are you going to do now that you are free? Holidays in the Caribbean?”
“Yes, sometimes. But then I think that Vincent and the others would want me to be happy, so I try my hardest to be alive – for them.” Longbottom nodded solemnly and Draco forced a smile. “And not everyone who's dead is unhappy. Look at the ghost lot over there.”
old house-elves is the norm. That's what sensible people do.”
, little boy.”
“...really?” Pause. Draco stared back at the ceiling. He needed a moment to stomach that. He had always thought that Harry would be totally temptation-free with a bunch of dead people.
“You do?”
Potter joined in the giggles. “Then the eleventh day must be a holiday?”
Pansy turned vaguely to where she assumed the other girl. “What do you gather it means?”
“No. But thanks for the sentiment. I wouldn't want you to be sent to Azkaban for me.”
, come on!”
“Ah.” Draco could hear the smile even in this one syllable. “I said:,” Harry lifted his head, so they were eye in eye, “'Call my name'. And you did, sort of.”
Ember didn't seem fazed and simply re-positioned baby Dreamer in one massive, sooty arm. “You can't. The Hunt goes forward, never back.”
A cold swirl hit them and Draco shivered. He definitely liked the occasional warm swirl better.
“We'll see about that,” replied Harry darkly and went back to trying to pull his feet out, with just as much success as the first time. He sighed deeply. It was no use.“I suppose we'll call for help then? Probably better together; louder, you know.”
“Okay, okay, but before you go, let's all have a cup of tea together, shall we? After all, today was The Last Ride of the year
“So sorry, Potter, didn't see you there.”
He made a face. “Nothing, I'm afraid.”
“Get there faster,” the Weasel commented and earnt himself a light smack on the shoulder.
Half and Seeker had had several snowball duels by now. Ember and Dreamer were inseparable, always guarded by grumpy Scoffer. Wolfe was singing. BraveHeart was excited. Things had got to a point where they had a normalcy feeling to them for Seeker. He'd even got used to the cold.
“More like:

. And now it's all a scheme?” He tilted his head up, so he could look Draco in the eye. Their faces were so close now, Harry's lips brushed Draco's cheek with his next words. “I get that you're scared,” (“I'm not scared.”) “but aren't you tired of these games? Draco...” A soft kiss landed next to Draco's ear.
Harry didn't exactly

“Also,” Finnigan took the floor, “Ron said you're alright now and if
Eyeing Draco from the side, Harry hesitated for a moment. This was a lot to drop on someone. But Draco was strong. He could take the truth. “Because I left it there, the night I died.” Draco inhaled sharply and Harry felt his heart go out to him. “Tell you while we walk? But you put this on, okay?” Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak around Draco's shoulders and stepped back to look at him. Of course, there  was nothing to look at as Draco had vanished from sight.
. Swim upwards.”
of all places? Don't you consider that I know you all hate me? I just– he... he needs saving! That's what you do, right? So, save him!”
, choked him as he despairingly watched the fading features of the only thing that mattered in the world.
“Seriously? Are there no normal rooms in this castle?” Malfoy grumbled and stepped inside. “Now, left or right?”
“The question remains, why would anyone be abducted from Hogwarts?” cut in the twin, narrowing his eyes. “Is this a joke, Malfoy? Because I swear, if it is–"
“I know you.” It wasn't a question. The owl tipped its head to the other side and kept looking at him, its gaze intense and somewhat expectant. He tentatively lifted a hand and to pet the bird. “I know you.” Just from where, he couldn't say.
Draco swirled around just in time to see a towel clad, still dripping Potter carefully close the door behind himself. With him came a cloud of the scent of Draco's best shampoo into the room.
know?” The betrayal hurt more than any of the punches Half had gotten in. Seeker's heart turned black. “I thought you were my friends,” he said bitterly. “To hell with you all. I'm out of here.”
I remember it as if it had been yesterday...”
After a moment though he let out a long sigh, briefly closed his eyes and offered Draco a hand to help him up. Tentatively, Draco took it and Thomas held on for a moment longer than necessary.
to tell me, would I now?”
Summer was in full swing and the July sun was beating down through the open window when the newly-weds came back from their honeymoon in the Seychelles and showered Draco with souvenirs and stories in his private library. It was a bit of a surprise as it was Tuesday, not Wednesday. Therefore they found Draco dressed rather casual, lying flat on his stomach with the Potter-glasses on top of his head. Embarrassing.
Although it was essentially the same arrangement – food, tree, presents – , Christmas with the Weasleys was so completely different than with his parents that Draco found he could barely compare the two events: Sitting at the cramped table with zero elbowroom, the clatter of dishes and cutlery as well as the loud voices and laughter, were often interrupted by the dreadful singing Christmas cards (
“A round for Malfoy,” Finnigan hollered ignoring Draco's sarcasm and zealous house-elves appeared to top off their beverages.
“How about this,” Half said emphatically, his red hair floating in the wind like a cloud, “we're about to land over there, see? Let's talk this through once we're down, yeah?”
Draco inhaled sharply. The audacity! “That is
“She's Dormarth today,” giggled Wolfe next to him.
and humiliated himself like that to spring Harry free, but also by the fact that the Slytherin had such a pleasant singing voice, despite a shaking slightly in the beginning. Harry'd heard him mock-sing
“This is where they kept the hostages,” Potter illuminated, a puny arm gesturing at the sculpture. “They had tied Ron, Hermione, Cho and Gabrielle to the tail.”
Instead he had a stab at distracting himself by eyeing anything but Malfoy's ass.
“It's because of the connection,” champed Granger, “the most powerful connection.” She shook her head at the forlorn gazes directed at her. “Oh come on, it's so easy. Malfoy, you said it yourself: Parsley had your wand. You both shared a wand, in a manner of speaking. Wand magic connecting you both is the most powerful connection.”
“Why did you do that?” Wolfe screeched, trying unsuccessfully to salvage the garment from the flames. “The nice jumper! Seeker, you idiot!”
“Yeah, well, he's already ruined the mood,” grumbled the Weasel. “Aren't you glad now that you decided not to go with your parents to visit their Australian friends? Who wants Christmas on the beach when they can have Malfoy on a nonsense-spouting spree?”
“Hogwarts. The Forbidden Forest.”
By the time the birds came swooping in, the four teenagers had resigned to a break and were mid-game into a round of Exploding Snap.
That, and the monotonous up-and-down of Malfoy's strides lulled Harry into the sort of cosiness you would normally achieve sitting in front of an open fireplace.
“Yeah, but he got it worse,” Half added solemnly. “After all, if he ever dismounted without Perchta, he would turn to dust when his feet touched the ground. He's cursed in a way, you know.”
And Draco had moved into the gatehouse on the Manor's grounds.
Suddenly two big owls and a tiny one fluttered from the top of the Christmas tree with indignant hoots and shot out the living room door past Draco. The tiny owl messing up several red hairdos in the process. All the raised voices in the room must have woken them.
“Yeah... yeah, alright.”
“Dolly?” asked Echo.
So, that's what they had meant. He literally was unable to leave The Hunt behind, he couldn't even get out of the area.
To their left, the whole wall was plastered with paintings of leporine animals, surrounding a Gobelin with sleeping bunnies on it, right next to an ancient-looking grandfather clock that had partly been built into the wall.
"I was wondering: Why
Harry made a face. Really, that thing was an abomination.
And before either of the addressed could do any more than gape at him, Draco had fled the place of his defeat.
While Harry frowned and started to object, Death beamed: “Yes and such a bright one, picking that up right away. You really have a smart head on your shoulders.”
Walking back into the fog, Seeker knew he was on the right way. Soon, he heard the familiar laughter and the clamour of The Hunt. It was blue hour and the world was tinged in fading residue of daylight, when Seeker finally stepped back onto the clearing at Holle's Pond.
“Maybe a teacher after all?” said Granger uncertainly.
“Was that it? Can I go now?” Draco's hurt shone through his words although he tried his best to hide it. Believe him, my ass.
The skin where Potter had warmly touched Draco's cheek was slowly growing cold again.
“Not an it,” grumbled Malfoy through gritted teeth and halted just below the three creatures on the hilltop, “and I order you to give Potter back to me. Right now.”
He shook his head and Disapparated home. Lots to do still.
Draco saw the same thing. “I don't see anything, Potter. Tea's rotting your brain. Pity.”
Lacie followed nonchalantly. She extended her hand. “Have this, too. For the company; it was fun to have guests.” What she offered was a small silver thimble. “It can buy a moment with this – when there is not so fun guests.” As Malfoy made no move to reach for the gift, Lacie made an impatient gesture. “It will need it. It has baggage. Magic baggage. Like
he snarled.
The hell?
For a while, there was no sound from inside the house and Draco was just about to knock again, when faint footsteps could be heard and the door was unbarred.
A haggard-looking man in his mid-twenties opened the door. With his ruffled clothes, his unkempt dark hair and the purple bags under his eyes, he reminded Draco of Potter right after the war.
(Draco's side note: tree of life symbolism?)
Draco stiffened. All of Thomas' posture screamed antagonism, from his crossed arms to his deadly glare. That was more what Draco had expected.
More silence.
to tell Draco, or anyone for that matter.
For the third time that evening, Hermione's forehead collided with another human being and she stumbled backwards, only held upright by Ron's steadying hand. Unfortunately though, in the progress, the Invisibility Cloak slid half-way off them both and exposed them to:
Harry laughed at Draco's confused face. “It's fine. Call me Seeker, if you like.”
“Oi!” the mocked weasel bristled. “I might not be a stellar book nerd but I had enough experience with investigations of all sorts to be helpful. I have you know, Parkinson, that I can name all locations of all sections in here by heart. Can you say the same for yourself?”
“Any ideas?” The Slytherin's question dragged Harry out of his rabbit hole.
Draco nervously smoothed down his coat. No matter how many times he wore the Muggle clothes Granger had picked out for him for his research outings, he felt colossally underdressed and uncomfortable. Especially those G'n'S that were so tight against his legs; he felt as though he were going naked with the way they snugly sat on his hips. Draco would have almost been tempted to believe these pants were Granger's misguided way of flirting (perish the thought!), had he not seen Weasley wearing a matching pair. They must have been on sale.
leader. Perchta, I mean Holle, is more like his second-in-command most of the time.”
“Yes and no,” disclosed Death. “Yes, Master Harry will only die when he decides so – which was the main reason to make him part of The Hunt as he was... considering.”
Death's laugh rolled like thunder overhead. “Not at all. That came rather unexpected. What we did do though was to make sure Draco had the best chances to succeed. For one, we never
(See the end of the chapter for
'Although', a quiet voice in the back of Draco's mind whispered, 'there is a weirdly perfect Invisibility Cloak hanging in your wardrobe...'
Also, something had been feeling off since yesterday... just... off...
The bushy-haired girl gave her friend a sharp look. “Would you let me finish? I think I got it. With the highest probability I've seen it in
“Oh, stop it already. It's getting ridiculous.” Seeker rubbed the attacked ear and glared at Ember.
When the filthy Quidditch player was almost out of the library, Draco called after him: “Have you eaten?”
Though he should have known better.
“Interesting idea, but why didn't she blind Ferret here then?” The Weasel was already stuffing his face. Draco's stomach growled. They had foregone dinner, so maybe just a tiny piece...
'Good,' Draco thought, 'I like happy ends.' Heaven forbid, he'd ever say that out loud.
Okay then. She nodded once.
“No! Don't leave! I still have to say... Give him back! Please give him back to me!” Draco ran dangerously close at the edge of the cliffs, stumbling at every second step as he almost  hysterically tried to catch up with his rider.
was the one enduring hardship in this new position; when Harry was the one who had to support both their weights like this.
“You.” With that Harry had enough and pounced on Draco like a lion.
Huh, how did the conversation suddenly turn so dark? Seeker suppressed a shudder. Talking about the underworld was one thing, somewhat adventurous, but this?
Harry wiped his eyes. Time to get some patching done.
“That is... really sad. I'm sorry for your loss, truly. But if you don't mind me asking, how do you know it was The Hunt that snatched your daughter's soul?” Draco bit his lip. He was starting to worry that this was another dead end or worse completely unrelated to Potter's case at all.
His current residence wasn't very big, so Draco only needed a few steps into the adjacent kitchenette. He whooshed his wand to get the tea making started and frowned a bit. Who would have thought there would come the day that the heir of the Malfoy name had a home-cooked Weasley meal for breakfast.
Harry's eyes went big. “But that... does that mean that even back then I did, we did... Did we?”
The door opened before they reached it and revealed to Draco's surprise one square-built, angry-faced Millicent Bulstrode, wand at the ready.
Cheerio~
and pointed at the frozen ground. “Those are hoof prints, aren't they?”

The chaos and racket was just too much for Harry's still somewhat hurting head. He wanted to join but at the same time wanted to be somewhere more quiet to clear his thoughts and find out where he was – and maybe more importantly, who.
“You have a lot to make up for, so better be generous,” black-haired Millicent said, shoving a bit too hard at his shoulder.
Ron sheepishly played with the hems of his maroon velvet dress robe. “I just thought, for old times' sake, you know?” He grinned at Harry lopsidedly.
Your friendship is warm like an inglenook. Take my hands across the distance and let's gambol, for Storm Chasers has come to a successful ending.
Neither Draco nor Potter batted an eyelash at that. Rather did they both get into position to repeat the spell as many times as necessary. They were used to it by now. Since Hogwarts was an ancient building and its own magic made the repair process take longer than anticipated, spells on the castle's matter often needed several repeats to stick.
