Harry heard him approach, and before he got there, he talked.

"Just one more secret – he watched them squint before nodding – Kreacher!
– James! – He let out a small sigh of nostalgia, remembering the first time he kissed him, and the first time he made love to him.
"For me, there is no problem, but I will be watching that NO ONE enters his room at night," Draco replied while getting up from the chair with the brunette in his arms, who when he felt the movement only curled up more against the blonde's chest – Good night," he added with annoyance.
Blaise and Theo were baffled, they didn't understand what the hell was going on, but one thing was for sure, they didn't want to have that Draco as an enemy.
Tom nailed his eyes to the boy in front of him.  He smiled to himself seeing the enormous resemblance to his beloved James even though his eyes were green like his. He frowned, he had to correct his sight so that everyone could see that he had the eyes of his real father and not that mudblood Evans.
"It's dangerous to come out his wet, you could get a cold Harry – his voice was more of a soft whisper – why don't you let me help you? –  and saying this he began to slide the towel down his neck by touching with the tip of his fingers the skin of the brunette who shuddered under the touch.
– Good Kreacher, when I call you, we return to Grimmauld Place.
Malfoy looked into his eyes looking for a lie, but when he couldn't find one he smiled weakly and nodded.Harry got lost in his eyes and unconsciously extended his right hand. Malfoy looked at him in amazement but quickly took it before Potter regretted it. When their hands came together, they felt an electrifying sensation pass through their hands.
However, poor Severus was worse off, kneeling on the ground completely sweaty, his wand up and his eyes exorbitant by horror.
Tom raised an eyebrow and looked at him for several minutes without a word.
Harry felt desponded by the pull but upon seeing that it was Draco he showed no resistance and instead let himself be embraced by Draco while feeling the warm hands of the blonde perch on his hips.
"Potter what are you doing here? You should have entered with your classmates to the dining room” she said sternly.
“But...”
"I don't have much free time, so I'll tell you what your missions will be and... – but his son clearing his throat interrupted him and he had to suppress the urge to roll his eyes, "I hope that you all will be
we leave you, I'm sure
Draco saw Harry approach and opened his eyes surprised, but when he felt the warmth of Harry's lips, he closed his eyes and let his hands rest on the brunette's thigh and back. The contact only lasted a few seconds, but when they separated Harry felt embarrassed.
We finally know what the Weasley's were hiding! How could they? And that old coot! Shameful!
"Okay Draco, I’m listening," he said, taking a seat next to him.
– I suggest Mr. Potter, that the content of the box be seen in a more …. Secure place. Please follow me–The goblin walked to the exit leaving Harry standing there anxiously looking at the box in front of him.
and Harry and Draco's relation is progressing *chef kiss*
– All right, follow me Harry.
Draco stood there watching the bathroom door and when he heard the water running, he rushed out of the room.
He got out of bed despairing. He was choosing a change of clean clothes from his trunk when he heard the brunette come out of the shower, he turned quickly and smiled at him, but the smile froze on his lips when he saw him. He was totally wet and all he wore was a small towel strapped to his hips, exposing his flat abdomen and long legs. Malfoy gulped heavily watching Harry dry his hair with another towel leaving it messier than before and that just managed to turn him on more. He lost the battle when he watched Harry blush when he realized he was almost naked in front of him. He sent everything to hell and smiling he seductively got closer to the smaller boy with feline steps.

"Of course not, I would never do something like that," he said with embarrassment, "Ginny's just confused and doesn't know what she wants, but that doesn't mean I'd hurt her. Ginny is like a sister to me; I can't see her as she would like – he ended feeling pitiful.
Draco stopped and he looked at the brunette’s eyes, they were almost black and only a small green circle could be seen.
"I don't think it will be more than what I already feel ... - he felt the brunet tensed and saw him get away from him giving him his back.
"You're right, Prongs, although now I think I'll sympathize with Voldemort if we can bring James back–he laughed” between the two of them they’ll be the end of him, but that would have to be before he crucios both of them for ruffling him up – and he went out laughing out of the kitchen. – Come on Remus, let's go get Harry’s stuff. Well see you in a while, don’t take long.
What the hell does that mean? Harry was in shock, that was impossible. His father was a man, he couldn't carry a child, that was complete madness. Feeling the panic take hold of him he breathed a couple of times to calm down before reading further. Maybe it was all a big joke.
"Not for long, I won't let her keep holding James' last name," he said annoyedly, but then he looked at his son and smiled sideways. He loved revenge – Although it won't be the only change because James will become Mr. Riddle, which reminds me...– he smiled when he saw the boy's horrified look in front of him – that you will become Mr. Harry James Riddle Potter – he finished, looking with amusement at his son.
"See you," Fred and George said at the same time.
"Ha-harry" he took a short breath of air before forcing his barriers, when he did panic started to fill him – Harry! Something is wrong with my son! I must find him, Severus, take me to Black Manor. I know you know its location, I need ….
He nodded at him. He saw him turn around and walk out the door.
Harry opened his eyes getting used to the light of the room and rested his green eyes on some grays staring at him expectantly.
– At first, we didn't know what to believe, but when you arrived, we realized that you were suffering a lot. We know we can't alleviate the pain you feel for Sirius' death, but...
When he returned he saw the blonde reading with a frown, he was so focused on what he read that he did not interrupt him and instead sat leaning on his shoulder to rest, but his eyes closed almost at the same time.
– Nothing Harry, you'd better go to sleep, it's late. Get some rest. - The two said, and they left the room.
He closed his eyes calmly and asked him in a low whisper, almost inaudible:
"Of course, Malfoy – he said with a grimace – besides, maybe things will go well and I decide to stay with them the rest of the Holiday- he said upset and didn’t notice the hurt look on Draco’s face.
"Everybody, take a seat," she said with annoyance after giving a nod to Harry.
"He's just imagining things," Sirius said near Remus, "I don't think they'll do anything to him. Molly loves him as if he were one of her own. In fact, last year we argued because of that; she was taking a lot of attributions that didn’t correspond to her.
When they were all done, Remus who had noticed Draco's looks at his pup and decided to give them a few minutes alone, so he got up and approached Sirius.
Harry could only think of one thing:
OMG guys, already chapter ten! Enjoy!
The exclamations were not left
*Let's get it on plays softly in the background*
the fruit of his love for James.
He smiled with satisfaction.

“Are you sure you can handle it? He asked to be sure.
Harry let himself be guided by his father inside the library and watched him take a seat behind the wooden desk. Not knowing very well what to do while being under the scrutiny of his father, he lowered his gaze while he bit his lip with nervousness and twisted his hands.
Kreacher nodded and Harry set off for Gringotts Bank.
Harry followed them into the house in silence and holding the trunks tightly in his pocket.
"Oh Harry, I don't know if you're too innocent or naive," he said amusingly.
Harry felt that the skin where Draco was playing was burning like fire, but he couldn't react. He saw the blonde's hand come down his chest and let out a gasp when those fingers grazed his nipple, turning into little groans as Draco's hand was felt all over his abdomen.
– It's okay, Harry. Don't worry, my brat of a cousin will still be here," he smiled happily, " for now, go fix your clothes while we take care of notifying Snivellus.
"My dad was very powerful, he wasn't auror for nothing. Besides, can you imagine if you had to go to Gringotts? – he asked with amusement – the poor goblins would surely tremble when they saw The Great Lord Voldemort enter through the bank gates – he laughed at the hilariousness the image produced.
Harry hugged the blonde tightly, he wanted with his soul to believe those words because he never wanted to part with him anymore. Draco came to bring light to his world and without him, he wouldn’t be able to put up with everything without breaking.
Harry looked in the mirror and all he saw was Katie and Angelina's kisses and then something clicked on his head and he paled. Draco couldn't believe that... He never...
That wasn’t a problem for him so with a flick of his wrist wand in hand he annulled it without them noticing.
The twins looked at him with pity, but they knew it was necessary for him to know the truth, he couldn't trust anyone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Merlin was it hot in here? He felt his mouth water, but he couldn’t stop examining the body in front of him, and that shirt that caressed his body in the right places and Fuck! It must be a sin for his pants to be fitted like that! Those black pants were so tight that it molded deliciously to his long legs, and his arms that were crossed in front of his chest seemed to him like the most erotic vision he had ever seen.
"Well, don't get used to this because I won't do it again," he said, "I was also worried that if something happened to you I'd have the first argument with my father because of you, and I want it to be because he calls me "son" and not "Potter"–-he ended, making a pout.
Draco was smiling amused at the Gryffindor's threats if that's what he called a threat.
did not work and after many unsuccessful tries with different spells, he stopped.
“He did what?!” Professor McGonagall and Draco asked at the same time, one with disbelief and the other in anger.
"This time you'll get away with it you insolent brat and you are lucky I don’t crucio you but remember there won’t be a next time. – he said giving him a warning look.
– Very well Mr. Malfoy. Tell Potter I want to see him in three days. Contact Severus when I give him the time and place – he turned to Severus – I want you here early tomorrow Severus. Now out, both of you.
"Can I approach Harry? Just for a moment," he said, preventing his voice from shaking.
So, why don’t we skip this conversation, you give me
"I’ll help you," Draco said without waiting for an answer.
And that was all the great Draco Malfoy could bear. He collapsed on his knees on the ground weeping desolately as he begged.
– We must return Sirius. Harry is alone at Black Mansion and... but this time he was interrupted by Sirius.
Malfoy was surprised when he felt he was being hugged from behind.
Hue hue hue. See you next Chapter.
He wished to have a family but he couldn’t let himself be fooled by Tom and end up dead, after all, he did not know that he had a son and that that son was the same person who wanted to see dead. He was afraid that his desire for power would be stronger than his feelings for his father and for his now "son."

Draco smiled broadly when he realized the reaction he provoked in the brunette and could not prevent a ray of hope from surfacing when he thought that perhaps... just
His thoughts stopped suddenly, and the blood drained from his face. Malfoy had gone up to the room and he had left the letter on top of the bed bureau forgotten.
– Mmmm – he sucked the lobe of your ear before continuing – why don’t you relax first.
Minutes later they both reacted.
and explain to me what is happening?
The atmosphere relaxed and everyone forgot what happened, except Harry who had promised Draco to be very careful and say nothing until he was sure to trust them. He still followed the others and sat in the dining room. Dinner passed quietly without problems and an hour later everyone was chatting while they ate dessert.
Draco composed his expression and followed the Lord with a determined pace, ignoring the worried gaze of his godfather.
– Okay Harry, we believe you. After all, we don't think Malfoy likes to share," they said in unison and let out some giggles when Harry blushed.
"Draco stop or you'll make a hole in the floor," Blaise said for the fifth time.
Hearing his name Sirius rose from a jump, his eyes wide like plates.
- You forget who you're talking to, Potter. – he said smiling with haughtiness – I’m not some weakling, like some others– he said, irking the boy again.
"b-but--but I've always been Evans," he said stuttering.
"Of course not my lord– he paused and mentally took a big breath of air – I understand. Potter is young, powerful, and very handsome, it's normal for you to want him without a scratch. The fun wouldn't be the same if he were hurt—he mentally prepared for an hour of merciless torture, but the result would well be worth it or so he hoped.
When it was all over, he knew that the hardest part of his entire stay in the Burrow was coming: Hermione's interrogation. He let out a tired sigh when she saw the look of her friend telling him clearly that they had to talk, so he prepared himself mentally.
Harry blushed to his ears but still followed his father.
"Shh Harry" they took him by the arm and pulled him into a corner – Ron and Hermione climbed almost after you and have locked themselves in their room, they're talking but they cast a privacy spell and our extendable ears don't go under the door.
He let out a sigh of feigned sadness, though he wanted to breathe fresh air because he was suffocating with that unpleasant smell of betrayal.
"I must assume from your smile that everything went well," he said, entering the house.
He got up willing to call Dobby before time got out of his hands. He felt certain displeasure at not being able to tell his friends anything, but as soon as he had all the information, he would let them know. He shook his head clearing that feeling and called Dobby.
After a heavy silence, everyone took a seat at the table, with Harry next to the twins and Ginny. It was only a few minutes before everyone was engaged in different conversations, but he had a lot to think about and decisions to make. It wasn't until he felt a slight touch on his thigh that he realized the twins were talking to him, but when he was about to ask what was going on, Fred discreetly slipped a small scroll in his pocket and whispered: "before you go." He watched them confused, but they went back to their talk, so he disguised the piece of parchment and bit his tongue for his stupidity in reading "we have to talk, it's urgent."
– Ok your win, let's have dinner then, I'm starving.
"Yes Father, I didn't mean to behave in such a manner" He embraced him tightly, but he knew that if he wanted a hug he had to ask for it. "We're alone, you can hug me please." He asked looking at him with tearful eyes.
"Mine, mine, mine," he repeated as he kissed Harry’s neck ravenously.
– Thank you Dobby, I am also glad to see you. Do you still work in the Hogwarts kitchens?
– Stop Harry. I know that maybe young Malfoy is right, but don’t get your hopes up. I don't want to see you suffer if, in the end, everything turns out to be a trap to get you.
Dobby appeared in front of him, bringing him a tray of hot chocolate and biscuits.
"Geesh, with this kid who can't stand anything," Sirius said when he saw him leave.
Draco had to make use of all his self-control; a false step would cost him not only his life but also his relationship with Harry. He kept his imperturbable mask and his proud bearing but didn’t forget who was in front of him. He knew that the Dark Lord had realized his interest in Harry; after all, It wasn’t as if had done anything to hide it, but he felt worse than when he was under the scrutiny of the old fart, he was almost waiting for permission to breathe. When everything was finished he liberated a mental sigh and he permitted himself to relax a little, but just a bit.
"You have nothing to thank us for, on the contrary, and now go, your prince Charming is waiting for you. And don’t worry about mom, we will tell her that you had to do something urgent with the Dursleys today. – they said winking at him.
– What if I want you to stay with me forever? –  he asks gazing at him.
Harry just nodded, not relying on his voice to express his gratitude, he leaned down slightly and laid his lips on those of a surprised Draco.
"Of course he's innocent, he's not perverted like other people who take advantage of his affection," he replied annoyedly.
"Tell me, do you need anything? – he asked, approaching.
"Yes, I'm yours Draco, only yours," he replied passionately.
After Harry explained why Draco was staying at the Mansion with him, it was their turn to hear the tale of what they had done to prevent Sirius from being locked in the Veil after the curse cast by Bellatrix. He was astonished to learn that neither his godfather nor Remus could die until they put their souls back together or they were destroyed, but above all that their parents' souls could still be alive.
–No, it looks like you were pondering something important. You looked very calm–he replied slowly wishing he wouldn't blush or give himself away.
“Okay Harry, now can you tell us who was that handsome man with you? – George asked raising his brows with insinuation.
"Of course I like to be watched, I'm beautiful after all, but don't worry because I'd never like your cousin," he grinned when he saw Harry's frown – I like green-eyed brunettes. – he winked at him and walked towards the bed.
Draco looked into his eyes and with his handkerchief dried his cheeks.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. LOL
When they arrived at the carriages, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione approached.
– They don't care what happens to me. I'm sure they think I'm going to stay here in the mansion, and that's why I haven't come back. On the contrary, if I return, they will be disappointed to have me at their home again – ended the brunette with indifference.
"Sure," Harry said, smirking with amusement, "See you guys. Take care.”
"And what he wants is?" his voice was shaking, and he felt a knot in his stomach.
– But of course I can! I'm not a Malfoy for nothing! he replied by raising his chin defiantly.
They didn’t have time to place a shield when they realized little Malfoy's intentions and were surrounded by a blue-white light.
– My lord, it's the connection! "He said kneeling next to the Lord – you must break the connection with Potter, the boy's emotions are so strong that he has managed to transmit them to you – he heard the lord gasp and hastened – You must break it now! Before it is impossible to do so.
Voldemort violently shook his wand towards the door sealing it completely before someone dared to interrupt him, he didn’t want any more casualties in his army and least caused by himself.
When they got to the couch they sat together, and Harry leaned on his shoulder.
"Well, but won't you tell us who's the lucky girl or lucky guy?" they said together crossing their arms.
"s-sure" he rose slowly putting on his glasses and he called the elf – Kreacher take us to my uncle’s house but stand in the bushes of the house so no one can see us.
– Harry and I became friends a few days ago and...
Draco knew he was abusing his luck, but he couldn't let the moment go by.
– All right, Harry, we'll take you out the back, so no one sees you and we'll accompany you across the wards to protect you from anything.
"You're Harry Potter, you'll achieve everything you set your mind to," He said, grimacing, but then smiled. “Good luck Harry” He gave him a gentle kiss on his lips despite Black's growl.

They've never seen the blond lose control like that.
Remus paid no attention to them; his gaze was nailed to the top of the stairs. He wanted to go up and see his pup, but he had a task and had to comply with it, after all, it was for the sake of his pup.
When he arrived at the castle instead of entering with the other students, he said goodbye to Luna and lagged behind with the new students. He looked for his head of house with his gaze and when he found her, he ran towards her.
– I don't know who you are, but I won't let you hurt Harry and less of all play with his feelings trying to make him think you're Sirius Black.
"Of course," he replied mockingly, and he smiled when he saw the boy tensed," I understand that you are on different houses and are supposed to be rivals – the boy nodded and blushed slightly – well, then I will let it be in your hands the option of choosing if somebody helps you and who they are; just make sure they are trustworthy. – he said seriously.
– I am sorry godfather, but for nothing in the world will I lose Harry, not even if it is the Dark Lord himself who stands in the way. And now that you know that what I said is true, I'm leaving, Harry is waiting for me. Feel free to be at ease here. Goodbye, godfather.
– Consider yourself warned, young Malfoy. If you dare to hurt my son, I will make you know hell in life – he saw the boy swallow with difficulty and nod – very well, if that was all you may leave," he said, sitting elegantly behind the desk.
– My lord, I heard you were looking for...
"Of course, my lord, but if I may ask, what will I do when he has trusted me and is my friend?"– although his tone of voice was indifferent inside, he was concerned.
“You are our friend.”
Breakfast was quietly spent with unimportant comments, but Harry knew that as soon as breakfast ended, he was going to be bombarded with questions. Since he had never been a patient person, he left that to Hermione, he decided to start himself.
– hissed Voldemort while keeping in the air the letter that had just arrived with an unknown owl.
"Hey little one," he replied, giving him a kiss on his forehead.
Harry gave a sniff and wanted to approach his godfather to defend him but was detained by three voices.
As they left the library, they met Colin, who smiled at Harry with uncertainty.
(See the end of the chapter for
– Well, it's too late. Today one of yours came to get you – he looked at the alarm in his nephew's eyes and he hastened to add – it shouldn't be anything bad because he was one of those that protect you.
“Eh... I” Draco cleared his throat looking at Harry “Can trust them, but you must be tired, go to sleep” he came up and gently kissed his lips. “Until tomorrow.
When they saw him disappear down the stairs, the older men’s gaze rested on the blond boy left in the living room.
"Whenever you want," he said, accommodating the brunette on the bed.
“But what has happened here? " Professor McGonagall asked entering the classroom – "is that Mr. Weasley?! – she asked horrified.
-I know that after everything my father did to you and everything I've done at school to you and your friends, I don't have the right to ask you anything; but I'll still do it because I know you're the only one who can help me. If you want to know how I found you, I'll tell you. I asked my elf to follow you since you left school and that when you were completely alone and out of the protections of that house, she would take me to you-. In his voice there was not a single trace of emotion, it sounded empty, devoid of feelings.
"I'd love for you to stay with me for a few days – the beautiful smile he received in gratitude left butterflies fluttering in his stomach. He let out a sigh, that handsome blond would be his undoing – What do you think if we have dinner y then you go for your things at Malfoy manor while I go pick up my trunk at my uncle’s.
"It wasn't a dream Harry, you won't be alone again– he winced in pain – but if you keep squeezing me that hard, you'll leave me useless very soon.
Draco was planning to follow her but was stopped by a gesture from Voldemort.
After that, he felt more relaxed and set out to read.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors.
"I know, but it's going to have to be at Hogwarts, it's almost time to go.” He looked at the blonde's lips “and now kiss me again because if all goes well, we'll see each other only after supper” - that said, he attacked the blonde's mouth with passion.
He came slowly and crouched down, took Harry's face, and raised it. He felt his heart break when he saw all the pain on Harry's face. He cleaned his cheeks, looked at his sad eyes, and without being able or wanting to avoid it he gently rested his lips on Harry's and then lifted him into his arms. He felt Harry cling to his chest and weep. He sat on the couch and settled the brunette on his legs while still hugging him and stroking his hair.
“Well, then I'll see you in a few weeks. Let's go, Severus.”  He got up and to Harry's shock and surprise, he took him by the arms, lifts him up, and hugged him tightly. “You better take care of yourself or all the
– Come on Remus, why are you taking so long? We have to get there before nightfall, so I don't wake Harry – he spoke impatiently.
But he couldn’t finish speaking because that handsome man was approaching, walking with sensuality and Remus felt a shiver down his spine.
– No Ron, forgive me too. I understand, Malfoy has been a delicate subject for me too but I can't help but put myself in his shoes that's it–" he said, "well leaving that subject aside, it's best to rest. I ate too much, your mother thinks I haven't eaten every holiday and took the opportunity every few minutes to refill my plate, so much food has made me sleepy.
Harry proceeded to throw himself a
He carefully folded the letter before ruining it with his silly tears. He knew he’d do the impossible if he knew there was a way to get his parents and Sirius back. He had tried desperately at the end of the fifth year to know if Sirius could return as a ghost, but no matter how much he did, failure. That only served to assure him that his godfather would never come back. He wiped the tears with his robe's sleeve and made his way to the box. Now more than ever he had to know what was in that box.
Hope you guys enjoyed the chapter. Starting Next week updates will be on Sundays. Read you then. XD
– What?"– he asked incredulously – What do you mean that he is alone at the Mansion? Someone might find him and hurt him – he was panicking and that wouldn't help – Moony fix your stuff right away, we're going back to Grimmauld Place today.
He levitated the box carefully and deposited it on the table.
– Oh! Come on Malfoy– Harry was uncomfortable and didn't know what to do – Stop crying or your eyes are going to turn red and ruin your cute angelic features. - Harry wanted to swallow his words as soon as they came out and he looked at Malfoy flushed. - I didn't want to... I didn't mean...
- See you, tomorrow Potter, - and saying this he took his elf's hand and he disappeared. Harry let go of a long sigh.
"Oh come on Theo, leave Draco alone.” Blaise said, looking at his friend, "the job will be for us, we'll have to stop them from hexing each other and thus prevent Draco from being killed for daring to hurt the Lord's son” He said with a tone of resignation.
"Enough Lads! " exclaimed Minerva “Miss Granger, take Mr. Weasley to the infirmary and when he wakes up tell him that he has detention with me all week ah, and 50 points from Gryffindor" she looked at Malfoy and continued "You are not out the woods Mr. Malfoy, although I thank you for acting on time that was not the way, 15 points less for Slytherin" she turned his worried gaze to Harry "are you well, Mr. Potter? she asks, scrutinizing his face and body.

"Listen Harry" He sighed. "I know you're waiting for family life you never had... that we never
"Draco what the hell is wrong with you," Blaise said, shaking him, "or you control yourself or I'll kill you before the Dark Lord does," he said annoyedly.
But it was interrupted when Potter came out of the portrait followed by the professor. Severus looked at them all and came out. Harry took a few steps to the place where Severus had come out, he had forgotten to ask if he could send an owl to his father when a spell passed him near his head and soundproofed the room.
His aunt stepped aside by leaving the free passage for the young men while not taking her eyes off Draco, which annoyed Harry. They were about to go up the stairs when their Uncle Vernon showed up followed by Dudley. Harry stood up indecisive about going up or waiting for him to see them. Draco seemed to perceive his confusion because he looked up at the very moment his uncle saw them, frowning when he saw Harry and watching Draco's clothes with envy.
"The good thing about this is that if they dare to give you up to Voldemort, you'll be safe," he said.
- I didn't expect you to be able to without difficulty, but I'm just asking you to please listen to me," he said with regret. Harry fixed his eyes on the grays of Malfoy. His gaze was intense, so he turned his gaze away so he could talk.
– Of course not! And you didn't do anything wrong either, but they did. They dared to mess with those they shouldn’t, and I swear to Merlin they will pay for it," he said, dragging the words and imbuing each of them with hatred.
He didn't care about anything, he wanted to do the same damage they were doing to him.
*Fully authorized.*
Harry was surprised that the blonde did not take his letter, but even more so by his words. He didn’t think it was that important for the blonde that Harry trusted him.
AUTHOR: VampirePrincess27
Harry gave out his wand feeling helpless without her, feeling that only lasted a few seconds as it was soon returned to him.
"You see Professor," he said, moving uncomfortably in his chair, "this holiday I have had time to think about prophecy and... after what happened in the ministry...” he lowered his gaze pretending sadness, although he couldn’t help but feel a prick of pain when he remembered Sirius falling through the veil and had to be forced to remember that his godfather was alive and safe. “I think I should take part more actively in this war.”
Harry opened his eyes surprised. His breath jammed when he saw Draco so close.
Draco felt harry settle behind his back and his heart was filled with relief and joy at the same time, feared being rejected a second time. He turned quickly and caught the brunette in his arms, squeezing him tightly as he stroked his back comforting him.
Read you guys next chapter.
When he opened his eyes again, they were in the Mansion. He sighed in frustration and let go violently from his godfather.
– Well, y-you see Draco... I, that is... Well... I don't know if...–He took air and whispered – I don't want to live alone in the mansion – he looked up to Draco and saw that he smiled tenderly —the memory of Sirius' death is still very present and living alone in this huge house would remind me of it all day. I don't think I can take it; his memory would drive me crazy. I'd rather go back to my uncles; it'll only be a few days because last week I'll spend it with the Weasleys.
LOL XD
“Well little Harry how did things go?” they asked together.
– Yes, we'd better get in. Tomorrow we'll see how it all turns out.
Draco and Harry are taking the next step! How brave of you Draco to ask for Tommy's hand in marriage *coughs* I mean, ask for permission to court Harry properly. Good for you ma boy! *dries crocodile tear*
Greetings Guys. I hope you had a wonderful Christmas surrounded by loved ones while making sure to stay safe. Here is another chapter!
He really looked like a kitten.
"You don't understand," he said slowly, "I know something's not right, I feel it. It's like Harry's in a lot of pain and I feel trapped knowing I can't go out looking for him. – he took a sip of the tea before looking at the adults. – I just need to know he is ok so I can breathe a little easier.
He felt a knot form in his throat and tears piling up in his eyes and preventing him from seeing the name of his parents clearly. He blinked a couple of times and looked up at the goblin to immediately directed it to the box. He gave a couple of steps but was interrupted by Griphook.
– My lord, did you need something? In …
Draco waited for him sitting in front of the fire and waving at the others he went to sit next to the blonde, who wasted no time and drew him to his chest in a hug. Harry huddled and yawned tiredly.
– But they look so cute like this, let them sleep, then we can talk.

"Thank you, Dobby," he smiled fondly at the elf.
Harry was caviling about how he would have to behave with the Weasleys at school or whether he should confront them as soon as he saw them. He looked up to see the three people in front of him arguing about how they should proceed and just as he was about to draw their attention a tremor swept through the mansion. In a few seconds, there was a loud noise coming from the corridor and the next second four wands were pointing in that direction.
He frowned. He didn't like the direction things were taking.
"Too easy, all I needed was localization," he said with self-sufficiency. - Severus, cast an anti-apparition spell before they escape, and let’s get in quickly. – When he finished talking, he walked towards the door being followed closely by Severus.
Draco denied with amusement before placing a gentle kiss on the other boy’s cheek and lying next to him luring him to his chest. Harry let out a satisfied sigh and clung to the blonde's shirt.
– Draco! – Harry pounced on the blonde hiding his face against his chest as he held on tightly to his shirt, soaking it with his tears.
"I have to go; I have to settle some issues but... I'll do everything I can to get you to spend Christmas with me". He saw his son's smile of happiness and felt something warm spread over his chest. “Still, I’ll try to come to dinner every night before you return to Hogwarts. By the way, this is for you," he said, spreading a jar with a violet potion, "take it today before bed; it'll hurt a little, but by the time you wake up, you won't need the lenses anymore.
"Very good. Everything went perfectly. I just hope this isn't the calm before the storm."
"Voldemort doesn't seem to like the idea of being a father-in-law," Sirius said, gaining scathing looks from the others.
my hand on my belly and I felt a little accumulation of
When they were left alone, none of them dared to look at each other. Draco was the one who started.
Translator's Notes
They separated and then came the twins and Mr. Wesley.
Harry walked straight up the stairs of the bank with his heart beating furiously on his chest, he felt that this information was important and that it would change his life forever. He walked through the big doors and walked down that white hallway once again with black decorations recalling the first time he had entered his vault. He arrived in seconds at the end of the hall and stopped in front of the elf. He cleared his throat a couple of times until It got his attention.
Harry felt his eyes fill with tears and he hugged Draco tightly by the neck. He felt Draco's arms circle his waist and his warm breathing hit his neck. A delicious scent came from his neck, causing a gasp to escape from his throat.  He felt a desire to test all of Draco's exposed skin but did not dare, although he imagined it would taste exquisite.
Draco reacted by hearing his name in the brunette's voice. He looked at him on the floor and he saw his eyes with tears, so without thinking he knelt at the same time Sirius approached Harry worried about the state he was. But seeing Lucius' perverted son hug him and look at him with distrust his fury returned with force and he said with menace.
Sirius softened his expression at the shock he had caused his godson and smiled warmly.
He walked in followed by the twins and they sealed and soundproofed the door.
After lunch, they headed to the greenhouses with the Hufflepuffs. Although he had to endure the wary and envious glances some sent to him, he enjoyed Draco's company that always attentively solved all his doubts and at the end of class, he gave him a beautiful red rose.
"Ron enough, don't make a fuss", Said Hermione looking at them with disgust.
Severus got up fast and looked at the man kneeling on the floor crying, he didn't know what he could do, he had never seen the Dark Lord cry. That man who looked so pathetic and weak on the ground didn't fit with the Lord he knew. That behavior was typical of Hufflepuff boys or even Gryffindor, in fact, Potter would be so pathetic to cry like that, but not...
When he walked into the room, Malfoy stared at him. He knew he hadn't put on fancy clothes, but he wasn't in a mess either.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. XD
"Well, since we cleared up that part and you've already sent the letters to your father's friends, we should read that book to find out what we're going to face when Professor Lupin looks for you–he saw Harry nod and continued – but what I want to know is if the Muggles you live with won't give you any trouble because you left home.
"You're right my boy, I've loaded you with a lot of work and that's why I'm looking for help for you.” He took a lemon candy and continued. “My old friend Horace Slughorn is about to take the potion master job. I hope to have him here after the Christmas holidays. But there is another issue where I require your opinion” He continued calmly.  “Remus contacted me yesterday and asked me for Harry to spend his first trip to Hogsmeade with him, but I still haven’t made a decision.”
"We knew you'd make it, now you're going to be our little manipulative snake.”
“Good afternoon professor, did you want to see me? – Harry asked.
"Yes, there will be many of us," he let go of his father, and he started counting on his fingers—Remus and Lily will be my uncle and aunt, Sirius is my godfather, Dad, you and Draco!" he said happily.
"I'm just ... will Harry be ok?" he said awkwardly, "- I mean, maybe they are pestering him and … - he stopped, he didn’t know what else to say.
It worked!
"Well, nothing really, right Hermione?" he says looking at her, "just helping Mom with the house and hanging out in the yard.
– Harry, what are you doing awake at this hour, you should be resting.
The worst part was telling them the truth about his real father and explaining to them why he wanted to try to at least be accepted by his father and have a family. That had led them to now as they sat together as they waited for his godfather and Remus to leave the pensieve.
“Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, first years.”
“No one’s really sure.”
On more than one occasion, both Harry and Draco fell asleep together on the floor while playing with Teddy. Then, Kreacher would be the one who get Teddy into his crib. Kreacher was more than capable to also put Harry and Draco on their respective beds, he had done that every time Draco fell asleep on the couch. Draco didn’t complain.
“Okay. Luna told Ginny about your cousin’s wedding. Dad invited her over to talk about all the muggle traditions that she saw. That was fun” -Said Ron.
“I’m sorry, but I need Neville back at home now.”- said his grandmother.
Harry started having nightmares again during the whole Christmas’s break. They never were gone completely, but they were tolerable and less frequent. He was at home in his bed next to Draco, who thankfully was still asleep.
“Maybe I have taught him a couple of things you wouldn’t exactly approve.”
The Weasleys throwed a party for Harry’s birthday. In the afternoon he arrived at the burrow with Draco. It was a nice party, but Harry had to answer many questions about his new job and Draco was still awkward around Harry’s friends. The Weasleys were clearly more accepting of Draco, they trust him in general, but he isn’t exactly a friend of the family yet. They were all trying to give him a chance. Apparently, being a ferret wasn’t enough. It needed more time and Draco was fine with that.
“They won’t know. I can make a potion to help us…clear our minds.”
“That too, but you have to admit you had some skills.”
“We said no explosives.”- said Draco.
“Gregory…Goyle.”
“No…it’s just that…you are too young to get married. And specially an arranged marriage.”
“Viktor Krum? What are you talking about? Hermione loves you. Viktor is our friend.”
“Well, yes. It’s fine by me. For better or worse, you’re still his family and I know he is safe.”- said harry. – “As for going to that party…”
Viktor spent the party playing with Rose. When Ron joined them, the rest of the Weasleys were confused at how comfortable he was with Viktor. Harry would smile at their confusion and Draco looked at him with suspicion.
“Yes, let’s go back to Hogwarts.”
“Don’t get any ideas. According to my father, im just working on my public appearance.”
On Monday he gave five classes. His last class was from 4:30 pm to 6 pm, to the seven years. It was fine. All the kids were paying attention. Harry thought they enjoy it. The kids thanked him for the classes, told him they learned a lot. Harry wanted to believe them. Objectively he knew that the kids did learn something. But maybe they were just being respectful.
Given the drunken state they both were, their fall was inevitable. The floor was nice and comfortable, a bit cold, but the cloak kept them warm. “We need to go. My father won’t like it if I get detention.” Said Draco. They were lying on the floor and apparently unaware of it. Their faces and bodies so close to the other. Draco was looking at Harry’s scar on his forehead, he wanted to touch it. When he moved his hand to do it, the sudden shift was enough to eliminate the distance left between them, and finally, they kissed. Their lips were closed, and it was quick. They both managed to smile before they fell asleep, right there on the floor somewhere at the castle.
safer.”
“Fine, I’ll give you a chance, but I’m not happy about it.” -She said.
“That is just Gryffindor stereotypes, you should know better.”
“Yes, she is.”
“Hermione would never do that.”- said Harry.
“You clearly aren’t very bright. Myrtle wants to cross the Veil.”
Ron enjoyed having the house and the attention of his parents all for himself. Eventually he got tired of it. He asked Hermione to move in, she refused. He started looking for some place to live, and asked her to move in with him there, she refused again. He kept looking for places, with the constant discontentment of his mother. He settled for Grimmauld Place. Harry found out about it when Draco wrote him a letter.
“Well, then get out and get married already so she doesn’t have time to do that.” -said George.
“Look Harry, I would give this paper a 95%, what do you think?” –when Draco turned to look at Harry, he was already asleep.
“Stop trying to make me a decent person, I’m not. What my mother and I did, was out of selfishness. At least she was brave. We are not good people, Potter. Why do you think my father allowed Teddy to come here?” -Asked Malfoy.
. Harry didn’t seem to care. And his lips were soft. And Harry Potter is attracted to men. That kind of information would give a man so much money if used wisely. He would never tell anyone, but he could imagine it. A first page on the Daily Prophet. Witch Weekly giving hope to witches who still love Harry. An entire book about the experience of kissing Harry Potter. Had Harry kissed other men before him? He was getting jealous, now.
“Why is my father out of his house?”
“That’s not really an insult.”- said Draco. - “Besides, I think I would look quite nice as a girl, don’t you think, Harry?”- at this, Harry choked on his tea and spitted some at Draco and Teddy. Draco took a napkin and clean Teddy first and then himself, without looking away from Harry.
“Exactly. They are paying attention to you, Harry. They all notice things. I cannot have students talking about what a Hogwarts’ professor does in close doors. I don’t like gossip about my staff. You have more free range than most, so I need you to be responsible. Next time you go out all night, change your clothes.”
“Am I invisible?” said Teddy “I am also here, I was the one talking with her, don’t blame Harry.”
“I’m going to stop you right there.” Said Ron with his face completely red.
“Harry!”- Said Hagrid as a greeting- “good, you got us a table.”
“What on earth are you doing here?”- asked Harry, trying to control his voice.
Draco gave Harry a sly smile and said good morning. Harry kissed him. Neither of them could think at this point. When Harry pulled away, Draco gasp and his body became rigid. Harry kissed him again, but this time on the cheek. Draco relaxed a little but was still shocked.
“How are you, how is your daughter?” asked Draco.
“It would make no sense! We date and then what? We break up and I mess up the only family I have that’s somehow healthy. I am afraid.”
“I had the chance to meet Remus when he was at Hogwarts, just for a couple times, when I went to check up on Sirius.”-said Andromeda to Draco. Harry already knew this. –“Neither of them allowed me to feel sorry for their situations, they made me laugh whenever they could. But by the time my daughter married him…well, he was a different man.”
“Harry, I think you are drunk.”-Said Hagrid.
“Yes. Do you remember her?”
“Look Teddy, here lies one of the bravest men ever to live.”-said Harry.
“Who do you care for most then, Potter or Teddy?” asked Blaise.
“Killing someone doesn’t make you brave.  Dumbledore knew more about bravery and I am sure he would agree with me on this one.”- Harry let Teddy down. He began to walk around the tomb, touching it and playing.
“You are asking many questions, Harry.”
“I live here now; it’s been about 5 months.” -Said Malfoy, enjoying the exasperation in Harry’s voice.
Harry received many letters from his friends, worried rambles about Malfoy living in his house. Molly Weasley was concerned about Malfoy really taking Grimmauld Place from Harry, on the argument of old family relations. Hermione reassured them that it was not legal in any way.
He could go back to Grimmauld’s Place and tell Harry he changed his mind.
“Draco come look at this, I don’t know if it’s right or wrong. I think this student might have changed the steps.”
“You told him?”- Teddy asked to Draco, feeling betrayed.
“Well, sure.” – said Harry, casually.
Suddenly, Harry was at Hogwarts, teaching a class to the first years, then Voldemort came in and started killing the students. Harry took out his wand, but it was a chocolate wand, he couldn’t move. Once Voldemort had killed every student, he laughed at Harry. Then, all the professors came in, but Voldemort was no longer there. They blamed Harry.
about how Harry looks now. Draco noticed those changes because he was looking for something to make fun of. That’s all.
“I can’t believe they didn’t tell me.”
“Don’t worry, you still have time it’s only 7:00 am.”
“The party started a long ago, you already ate some of my mum’s roast potatoes.
“I suppose you want me to say that I did it out of the goodness of my heart. Why else would you care? What’s done is done.
for this long. That’s nice. But don’t be surprise if one day Draco can’t handle being around you anymore.”
“What? I didn’t know about that. How did your father take the news?”
“That’s because you are still a baby…”
“Professor, where did you came from?” – asked Harry, with his hand on his chest.
“That’s fine. Maybe latter I’ll come back.”
“I am doing well. And you? What were you thinking for more than a month?”
Harry apparate in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. Kreacher and Draco were there, but only Kreacher noticed the arrival of Harry. Harry was sitting in his bed, just looking at the new décor, when he took a nap. He wasn’t exactly tired, but the new mattress was so comfortable he couldn’t help himself.
The parents of the brides were at another table with the rest of the Weasleys and Gabrielle. In the last table the Hogwarts’ professors were sitting with Hermione’s parents, and they were sitting next to Hagrid and Madame Maxime, which made Hermione laugh at how small her parents looked next to them.
“Maybe it would be bad for you to be seen with me so often. It’s bad publicity for you.”
“That’s because he was asleep during your class. You can’t misbehave in your sleep.”
birthday! Happy birthday by the way…what about your family?” asked Ron, since Hermione couldn’t find anything to say.
“Speaking of your admirers, you should come to my house some of these days. My mum has been feeling sad since Ginny move out. You might cheer her up.”-Said Ron. – “She would also like to see your house.”
It was Draco who had to pay for everything because he was the only one with muggle money.
“I’ll think about it. By the way, how’s Myrtle?”
“I would like to, but I have to stay here so I can talk with the Slytherin kids. You know, all those responsibilities of a head of house. Actually, I have to go to my office now. See you around.”
On Thursdays, Teddy only has one class: History of Magic. The ghost Binns was still the professor and he gave his students a surprise quiz the first Thursday after the holidays. Teddy failed. He didn’t cry, but he wanted to.
At the end of march, during James Potter’s birthday, Harry had a nice dream. Not even a little weird, just nice. All his family together and happy. Remus and Tonks playing with Teddy. Draco talking with Harry’s parents. When Harry woke up, he cried. He had to fight the instinct to hide from Draco. Draco hold him for the rest of the night, luckily neither move in their sleep, so they were able to wake in each other’s arms. Something rare considering Draco moves a lot in his sleep, according to Harry.
“I am right here.” Said Neville, who was sitting in front of them.
“Teddy is a toddler now. He’s getting old, I like to worry about him.”
“Did you make treacle tart?”- asked Harry
“It’s a Tuesday. What were you thinking? I don’t even know how to deal with this.”
Harry spent Christmas with the Weasleys. Hermione was already 4 months pregnant and Ron had spent the whole time worrying over Hermione. Everyone but Hermione enjoyed watching Ron freak out like that. Bill eventually felt bad for his brother and he tried to calm him. He told him about Fleur last pregnancies and her current one, and everything was always fine. Hermione heard a couple of inaccurate
Harry stayed there, looking up at Draco. When he realized he was staring he just looked at Teddy.
Harry felt like crying. He was not able to put his thoughts in order, but it wasn’t necessary because Draco opened his eyes.
“Thank you Kreacher.”
“This doesn’t have to change anything between us. Don’t get me wrong, it will be awkward for a few days, but we’ll get over it…I should go. Tell Teddy I had to go see my parents or something.”- so then he left.
“She is not your entertainment, Harry.”- Said Luna, looking at him defiantly.
“What do you mean?”- asked Harry, getting angry. – “You have to be clear, use your words.”
“Good, I created it. I would have been very upset if there was already a spell like that.”
“Nice to meet you, cousin Harry. -She said, shaking his hand- “Who is this?”
“Shut up and get out. Please. I don’t want to talk about this, tomorrow I’ll be fine.”
“Then be more careful next time. You are a professor. you can’t let a student outsmart you like that.”- said Slughorn, scolding him. - “you two kids should go with Hagrid. He was sad about his lady friend. Or should I said his
“I know she didn’t. I meant it as a joke, but I guess it would’ve been better if she were here.”
June was over. Gryffindor won the Quidditch cup and Ravenclaw won the house cup. During the ride back to Kings Cross, more students than the year before came in to talk with Neville and Harry. Both professors didn’t’ get much time for themselves, but Neville did manage to talk about Hannah Abbott and how nice she was with him.
“Her sister Daphne then, you decide.”
It was already dark when they arrived at Hogwarts. McGonagall just patted them on their shoulders and went to her office. Sir Nicholas appeared and seemed to want to talk with Harry, but he didn’t. He just stayed there in the hallway looking at the two professors leave to their rooms. Harry went to Draco’s room so they could keep talking. Harry sat on Draco’s bed and Draco sat on the chair of his desk.
“Thank you, but I will need to make a report…”
“Oh, thanks, you are always so wise.”
“Yes, I am very careless. Clearly, he isn’t alone, he’s with Kreacher…Ronald, talk with your wife. If your mother sees the both of you having trouble she will pry, and it will be worse for you.”
“I kissed Draco Malfoy, on the mouth.”
“I guess im not over it yet. Any of it. I don’t want to think about it.”
Once they arrived at the castle, Harry wanted to go to Gryffindor tower, while Draco said they should go to the dungeons. “Dungeons are scary.” Said Harry. The stairs moving didn’t help. So now they were lost.
“Come on, let’s go eat.”
. They went to the Three Broomsticks. Some students were there, and Harry was sitting nearby.
“Don’t pretend like you weren’t slacking off the entire week.”
If Malfoy gets married, would he invite him to his wedding? Andromeda said they wouldn’t get married right away, but Malfoy is an idiot, so he might as well be already married.
Harry and Draco were furious with Binns. Neville pointed out that they couldn’t fight with a ghost. So they ended up trying to help Teddy study.
“You don’t have to decide now.” - Said McGonagall. - “You can send me a letter before the next school year starts. I’ll go now.” -She stood up and Harry followed her to the door. -“Potter, you will have to get out at some point, you know.”
“I was looking for a toy for Teddy, but I didn’t find it.” Answered Draco.
“Well, it was a long game, I think it was good. Too bad those Gryffindor kids don’t know math.” -Said Malfoy.
, it was cute. I suppose most of the kids are still a bit intimidated by me, so I was thinking, that if I gave them more homework, they would stop thinking of me as
“My name is Luna, I am Harry’s friend. How did you both meet?”
“It is no longer your birthday, it’s past midnight...”
“Well, are you busy?”
The Koldovstoretz players were all seventeen but they all looked so much older and they won with150 points against 60. Their seeker caught the snitch after about one hour. The match was fine, but the interesting part was the inauguration. Fireworks, a demonstration of quidditch on unrooted trees instead of broomsticks, Russian dancing on broomsticks, more fireworks.
Draco spent the morning of his birthday with his family at Malfoy Manor. Andromeda and Teddy were there the entire time. At some point, the Greengrass family arrived. Lucius kept making subtle comments about Andromeda’s half-blood suitor. Narcissa took the positive side, at least he was a wizard.
Since Teddy insisted, they went outside. He was bored and he wanted to play with the peacocks. The maintenance of the entire manor was now Narcissa’s full responsibility, since she was the one with the wand. She had to feed the peacocks and tend to everything inside and out, and though it was an easy thing to with magic, she hated doing it. So she didn’t liked watching his son playing with Teddy and messing up the bushes she had already tended.
“Oh, well…another day, perhaps.”- said Molly. Augusta, Miss Marchbancks and Neville said goodbye to everyone and left. - “Today we celebrate only you, Harry.”
“I think you broke my nose.” -said Draco, looking at his hand and finding blood.
“Can Teddy eat that? I think you used too much oil.” -said Draco.
“It’s fine.”- whispered Harry. He also had his wand ready, hiding it between their stuff.
“Yes. They love him. But they made him think he was better than everyone else. It’s not his fault he believed them. But he decided to change.” – he said, smiling.
“Father, I love Harry…”
“Are you not happy to see me, Ronald?”- asked Viktor. - “I am also here for your wedding. Congratulations, you are both very lucky.”
“Really? What exactly did he tell you?”-asked Harry, repressing a smile.
“Master Potter and his friends, how nice to have you all here. Is there anything you need?”- said Kreacher.
They tell me
On the 10 of February the Hogwarts team played against Beuxbatons and lost. The Hogwarts kids blame it on Professor Potter for not going to the game. He didn’t go to the game because Hermione threw a birthday party for Rose that Sunday. Her daughter’s birthday was on Saturday, but she was working that day. During the party, Hermione and Ron told their family and friends they were expecting another baby. Harry teased them about it saying she got pregnant because she was just so happy about the Durmstrang issue. She didn’t deny it.
“Sorry. What’s going on?”
?”- Said Ron. His face turned from confusion to amusement so quickly it surprised Harry.
Slytherin won with 180 points. After the match they went to Honeyduckes to buy the chocolate. They saw that Neville and Hannah went inside Madam Puddifoot’s tea shop. Harry bough Draco 8 kilograms of chocolate.
“I thought you three were better now…you should try to talk to him. He is still your father.  And you know, he could be in Azkaban…”
“What are you teaching them, them?”- asked Draco, smiling.
“You don’t have to answer.” -said Harry.
“Go then.”- the two men stood up, thank her and went to the door, before Harry could get out, she said: “I am truly sorry, Harry.”
Once Harry goes to Hogwarts, there isn’t much for Draco to do. Even though he loved spending time with Teddy and Andromeda and his friends, he was getting bored. He applied for a job at the ministry, and even though Hermione recommended him, he didn’t get the job. Hermione offered to talk with Shacklebolt, but Draco said it was not worth it. But he really wanted something to do.
When Draco told Kreacher they were also going to redecorate his room, he wept with word of gratitude and mumbles of being unworthy. Draco just made the room bigger, got the boiler out, got him a decent elf-size bed and put in some furniture for Kreacher’s few possessions. Adding to Kreacher’s collection of stuff, Draco gave him the New Guidelines on House-elf Welfare, which were modified by Hermione, and order him to read them.
to McGonagall. She had to give talks during her classes about how inappropriate that behaviour was.
“Really? Even Neville starts at 8:30. Well, any free hour between classes? Or half an hour?”
“If anything, Draco dating Harry would bring your family a better image.” Said Neville.
“Dinner? What time is it? - asked to harry, looking at the window, noticing it was already dark.
Harry spent the night in Draco’s bed, and he was kind enough not to mention the sounds and smells Draco’s stomach produced during the night.
“My parents kept saying that it’s not enough time. For a moment there they forgot that I’m a witch.”
“It’s going great, each time I’m playing more, and they say I’ll be so much better when I’m older. Oliver Wood has come to most of my “important” games. He is really proud.- Said Ginny more relaxed now.
Draco opened the door.
But the Weasley family kept increasing. After Molly’s birthday, Percy told his family he got married. With Oliver Wood. They were all happy but confused. Then mad for not being invited to the weeding.
They both remembered exactly what had happened last night.
“Well, we have been talking about it…”
“Any advice?”
“I’m a little offended she didn’t tell me about this.”
“I guess. It’s easier to talk with him. I can vent, you know
Harry’s cousin had a son at the beginning of March and Dudley named him Adler. His cousin sent him a photo of the baby. Draco was the one that told harry to send him a gift. He also persuaded Harry to visit his cousin. Harry agreed on the condition that Draco should come along. So, after the quidditch game was over, they both went to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezed to look for a gift, and it took both of them longer than necessary to realize there wasn’t anything appropriate in that store for a new born.
?”- Draco asked, raising one eyebrow.
“Why not? Who are they, anyway?”- asked Harry
“Peace disturbers.”
“I don’t think I can help you. Ask Ron.”-said Harry.
“Do you want to ride him?” asked Harry.
“That’s the thing. I don’t know much about this stuff, how do I know if it’s
.”- Said Malfoy. – “but who knows… I don’t have many options, so
“We went to the same school”- said Dudley, looking at Harry.
“You are going mental for that job.” -Said Ron. - “Anyways, I should go with you. I don’t want you walking around all alone at night.”- said Ron.
Malfoy was right about saint Valentine’s day. 23 girls and 6 boys gave Harry some kind of gift. Some of the cholate boxes came with a letter. A few of them were quite inappropriate. Harry had to go with Slughorn to be sure the chocolate didn’t contain any love potion. Of the 29 presents he receive, only 11 had a variation of a love potion. Harry gave two boxes to slug horn for his help.
“I’m going to tell mum about
- “Teddy can be whatever he wants. He looks cute.”-
“That he was an idiot, that’s what I remember and what I liked the most.”- Said Neville smiling. – “His entire face was red, I even felt sorry for him.”
“You sound sad.”- said Teddy, still eating his breakfast.
The End-of-Term Feast was on the 29 of June. The Great Hall was decorated with Ravenclaw colours, who had won the house cup. Harry ate mostly roast-beef, mashed potatoes and ice-cream, although, he definitelyate a bit of
“Stop it. I don’t know if it will work, but I will try to help you. I don’t know when we will meet again, so talk to me.”
“Besides, you can do whatever you want, even if it’s not your birthday. You are Harry Potter.”-Said Draco, making fun of him.
“Apologies, but Kreacher Is happy. A Malfoy, it is certainly an improvement from a Weasley…and Kreacher meant no disrespect by that.”
He wouldn’t accept anyone else, other visitors were asked to go away by Kreacher. One day, Rita Skeeter tried to sneak into Grimmauld Place, but Kreacher just blasted her away. That didn’t stop her from writing a detail article about how Mr. Potter definitely needs a haircut.
“Well, as a Potions Master my schedule is quite full, so we don’t see much of each other during the day” he looked at Harry, who was nodding along. “But the nights are fun.”
“I know, I’m still going.”
Victoire was a flower girl and Teddy was the ring-bearer. When they said their vows, both of them were blushing at first. Until they forgot about all the guests.
“How can you tell?”- asked Angelina
"My father has never been good with evil plans."
“He knew I wasn’t brave enough to kill anyone."
about seeing
“I also have to go anyway, let me go with you,”- said Ron.
Draco could clearly tell that Harry was smiling while he spoke. Draco knew he was not able to pretend to be mad or annoyed. He knew he could be silly around Harry.
By Sunday, Malfoy wrote back:
“I wanted all of you to meet your new Potions professor today, but he must be running late…”- McGonagall was interrupted by the sound of the doors opening, through the middle of the Great Hall the new professor began walking toward the high table. “Sorry I’m late.” He said. It was, you guess it, Draco Malfoy. Harry choked on his drink and Neville gave him a few pats on his back until he composed himself. Draco sat on the empty chair, close to the Slytherin students.
Then, Draco showed Harry a letter he had received from his mother. His parents knew he had been at Malfoy manor, but they were not sure why. She wrote how his father thought Draco had enchanted the house to annoy him.
“Hermione was rude, this isn’t Ron’s fault.” Said Harry.
“You wish.”
“I’ll go get Dudley, you both look after the kids.” Said Mary, who went upstairs to wake up Dudley.
“It’s so funny that you are in love with Potter. All those years at Hogwarts finally make sense.” Said Goyle.
“What? What time is it…? I gotta get back to Hogwarts…
“What is your problem? You need to think how your words sound before you speak.” Draco sneered.
The day before the Quidditch match was Sirius’ birthday. He was trying not to think about him during his classes, but it was no use, he couldn’t concentrate on his students. Since it was a Friday and he had a free hour before lunch, he decided to stay in his office grading some of the theoretical practice tests he had to give the students. But he couldn’t concentrate on that, either. He started feeling that he should have done something to celebrate Sirius birthday, maybe a prank of some sort. But he couldn’t manage that anymore. The best he could hope for was a drink of firewhiskey with Hagrid and Neville at the end of the school day in honour of Sirius.
Harry mentioned that he thought there were only eleven wizarding schools in the world, and that there was only one for the country of the United States of America. “That would be stupid. Go look at a map.” Draco told him.
“I am your friend. As your friend it is my job to tell you are an idiot.” Said Draco. “Talk about your feelings with Hermione. Did you hear that?
Teddy used Draco’s work as study material and not so much as a cheating aid. At least he tried to. It was difficult for him not to share it with his new friends, but he knew that it could cause problems for Draco.
“She put a love potion on them.”- said Harry, smiling at Neville. – “Let’s go with Slughorn, he’ll have an antidote.”
“Yeah, you are right, I was never a good enough wizard to be a real threat. I’m glad I was so useless.”
stuff…and, well, you know that Draco is my friend. And we are close friends…and sometimes men do…they like…they enjoy…Draco, can you please talk with your cousin.” Harry gave up.
“Is andromeda still at you parents’ house?”
a favour? My father can’t leave the house and his wand was broken. We don’t have any servants, no one wants to work for us. We don’t even have house elves anymore. Who do you think is taking care of whatever my father wants? My mother has become his servant. And even as weak and pathetic as he is now, he wants to use me.” – Malfoy said, looking into Harry’s eyes. He was having a difficult time containing himself. He wanted to scream at potter. But he didn’t want to make a scene. Even if there weren’t many people there.
At 6:08 pm he was knocking at Malfoy Manor. The last time he was there, neither he nor his friends had a particularly nice time. But Malfoy had lie for him. They still need to talk about that. Did Malfoy wanted to protect them?
Juniper Dursley’s birthday was on june, and she had asked for Uncle Harry to be at her birthday party. Dudley sent his cousin a letter to Hogwarts. Harry accepted on the condition that Draco and Teddy went with him. By that time, Harry already knew what the final exams for DADA would be like, but Draco was still thinking about his subject. So, bringing Draco with him would mean an excuse to leave earlier.
They were walking to the bus stop to get back home, Draco was carrying Teddy who was sleeping. Both Harry and Draco were wearing the Lion King T-shirts they had bought. Harry was carrying the rest of their stuff, both merchandise and the chocolate eggs.
When they arrived at London, his friends were waiting for them. There was Ron, his parents, Draco and Teddy and even Hermione. Luna and Ginny arrived a little late. There was also Neville’s grandmother, who was accompanied by professor Marchbancks, the old lady who had administer Harry’s O.W.L.s. She was talking with Hermione when Harry got out of the train, and he got to see Ron’s expression of pure boredom. There were a lot of hugs and congratulations. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley invited everyone to the Burrow to celebrate both Harry and Neville.
“Harry, you shouldn’t do it.”-said Neville when he realized what his friend wanted to do.
“Draco wants to be dramatic, apparently.”
Now, the plaques with the heads of the former house elves were a sensitive topic. Harry wanted to take them off, or at least hide them, but Kreacher refused. He said it would be disrespectful. Malfoy also wanted to take them off. He suggested they should put them in their own room, but then that would also be disrespectful, said Kreacher, because it was still hiding them. Another idea was to give the heads a proper burial, with tombs and all, maybe a small mausoleum. Kreacher said they should not be away from the house.
After the first week of classes Teddy could tell that his favourite class was transfigurations. The professor was also sorted into Hufflepuff, so he felt attached to her. For the first week, professor Fawley was his favourite. He didn’t mention it to Harry and Draco.
“Yes, we are both professors there.” answered Harry.
“Finally.” Said Neville, standing up to pat Harry on the back. “I guess I’m going to leave now, let you two lovebirds talk, alone.”
“Yes, he only has Harry’s trust.”-said Hermione smiling.
“Where is Hermione?”
“Sweet like
Harry hasn’t even seen Malfoy since Christmas, maybe he was already so in love with Astoria that he just wanted to spent time with her. Hermione and Molly both said that Astoria was pretty. That’s really all he knows about her. Malfoy would tell him if anything happens with her, they are
, I tried very hard for him to get house arrest instead of Azkaban”- Said Harry. He got involved in the Malfoy trial.
“According to my sources, the kids aren’t afraid of
“For what you’ve said, they were very loving parents for him.”
After the party, back at Hogwarts, Teddy received a letter from Victoire telling him how their parents were now arguing constantly. It was a first for her, seeing them like that. And it was because of her, she said. Then she told him that maybe it would be best if she went to Beuxbatons. It was a great school after all. Teddy told her that it was too soon for her to make a decision. He also wrote a letter to Fleur.
“First of all, your father is quite useless. Second, I was going to invite you both tea and biscuits, but I won’t be nice to some boys that are accusing me of
In January of 2008, Viktor Krum publicly announced that he would no longer play for the Bulgarian National Team until Durmstrang changes its policies and accepted muggle-borns. At first, there was no official announcement from the school, but the students were mad. They didn’t care much about the blood of the wizards anyway, especially after learning all that happen in Britain. Then the Ministry of magic of Bulgaria wrote encouraging letters to Durmstrang to change its policies. They wanted Krum to eventually work for them. Also, all the fans of Viktor sent letters, howlers, and some incendiary devices to the school’s headmaster.
“Well, it’s not like you would tell me.” He said smiling, resigned. “You are smart, after all.”
That year Percy had stayed with Oliver and his family in Scotland. They both sent presents to the Weasleys and to Harry. Percy wrote a letter that said they both would be staying at the Burrow for new year. Luna’s father was trying to convince Charlie to get him some dragon’s tears, although he seemed reluctant to tell him why he needed them.
He didn’t even know why he bother to answer.
Once he was done grading the homework, which was poorly done by most, harry started writing a letter to Hermione. He asked how she was doing and when was she free again. he also mentioned that she should propose to the ministry that they give less points for the written part of the exams, at least for subjects like DADA. Theory wasn’t as important as being able to do it, according to him. Before he was done with the letter, he heard a voice coming from his chimney. It was from Draco, whose face appeared on the fire.
“I don’t need them, but I want them. It’s just a fun bet, I guess.”
“It’s fine”- said Harry, clearly disappointed. – “Where is Andromeda?”
you cook.”
“Have you ever been to West End?”-asked Draco.
When the feast was done, Harry went to Hagrid’s for a drink. Hagrid kept talking about Olympe, how with each letter she became nicer and nicer with him. How he couldn’t wait to see those fancy places she always described to him. He was worried about being out of place around her, but it didn’t matter to Olympe, he said. Harry, to his own surprise, was talking and talking about Malfoy.
“Did you invite him? Does Bill know?”- asked Ron.
Almost all of the Weasleys went to that game. When it was over, some of the students approached Hermione to ask her if she could do something about Durmstrang not admitting muggle-borns. She said she would look into it, but she knew there wasn’t much to do. But she would still try. At least, a letter with the suggestion to embrace new times.
“What does Hermione say?” replied Harry.
“No. I ruined everything. He just walked away.”
“We’ll stay here, Harry.”- said Andromeda.
“I’m not a kid anymore, I can be out my room late if I want to.”
All the rooms now looked alike. Harry still knows which is Sirius’s room, but it didn’t feel as sad anymore. Even the attic felt livelier with all the light.
“Well, that’s correct, I see you still have the gift. But that’s not what I meant…”
Once the four of them arrived, Andromeda excused herself and said she needed to go with Narcissa, and asked Draco if he could take care of Teddy for that night. He said it was fine, but that he was going to take him to Grimmauld Place.
Back at Hogwarts Harry learned that one of his students broke his nose on a “muggle fight” but it was an easy fix. He didn't worry about that. A part of him was disappointed because there were no letters from Malfoy waiting for him. He’s gotten used to them. Harry couldn’t remember if he had ever written first to Malfoy. So, he wrote:
“So, she didn’t predict your death?”- asked Harry.
“I didn’t leave Teddy alone, you should remember he lives with his grandmother and I’m still going to see him…Now we can see him together.”- Draco patted Harry on the shoulder. – “About my old
“I assume he can. It’s meat.” -said Harry, starting to question himself. He was watching Teddy eating his eggs, and Draco trying to clean him.
“This doesn’t look like pudding.”- said Draco, poking it with his fork. – “Can Teddy eat this?”
“Haven’t you asked her already?”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, once he realized Ron wasn’t going to talk.
“He is…not… I don’t know… I haven’t noticed.” -Said Harry.
Hermione was the first to leave. She wanted to sleep early so she could go to work on Sunday. She didn’t have to do it, but Shacklebolt went to work two Sundays a month and she felt she had to help him.
“I don’t know how it can still bother you that we always win. Gryffindors are always on top!”- said Ron.
“They all love him. The kids. He’s patient with all of them. A bit sombre at times, but the kids won’t be intimidated so easily.”- said Harry, smiling. - “You know he hasn’t given any detention yet?”
Two days after the wedding, the event appeared on the Daily Prophet. Rita Skeeter wrote mostly about how weird Luna’s dress was. She also wrote about Harry. She wrote about him: “The boy had the miserable face of a man that has lost the love of his life. But there is a good part of his devastating suffering: we officially know that he is single and available for any special witch out there. So, ladies, you might get a chance to comfort him.” The Weasleys kept making fun of him, even Molly gave him hot chocolate, to soothe him from his
“It is my secret, then. Please don’t tell your mum about my secret.” intervened Teddy.
They had a one-week honeymoon in Australia. Ron was stung by a jellyfish and he swears a shark almost ate him on the beach. Hermione got sunburnt. Still, they both had a great time.
“She had to leave. Something about
Back at Hogwarts, Draco and Harry argued for a week about which of them was the favourite professor. Arguing with Harry about silly stuff was quite fun. Draco knew that the favourite professor of the majority of the kids was Neville. Harry knew this too. Neville was pleasantly surprise when they told him that.
Molly Weasley was a bit angry at both Harry and Draco for not telling her about their “secret” relationship, but everyone else in Harry’s life was fine with it. They just had to ignore all the questions people kept throwing at them.
“You are also my family.”
. Maybe at Honeydukes?”
Both Harry and Dudley looked at each other, Harry trying to ask what he should say and Dudley not knowing what to invent.
On the seven of April, Slytherin played against Ravenclaw and won 160 to 60.  The next day it was Teddy’s birthday. His birthday was on a Sunday and it was celebrated at the Weasley’s. Charlie wasn’t there, but he sent Teddy a fluffy, fire-spitting dragon toy. Of course, it wasn’t real fire, it was not burning wizard’s fire. Teddy also got a couple of teddy bears, three cakes, lots of chocolate and candy, his own copy of the Tales of Beedle the Bard and a muggle Game Boy colour with three games, which was used for most of the day by Arthur Weasley. And despite Draco’s worries, the general consensus was that the game wasn’t bad for Teddy’s eyes.
“I just think that it would not hurt Draco to consider it as a possibility. To actually meet this girl. Astoria is a lovely witch. That’s all this invitation is, for them to talk. The idea is not for them to marry right away, in a few years, once they are friends, they could be good spouses for each other.”  -said Andromeda.
“What? I didn’t notice how long we were talking.”
Harry went with them. There were many kids, but they didn’t seem as excited as Harry’s classmates were. The kids were starting to get the idea of Harry as a teacher. He hasn't taken points away from any house, and he hasn’t given detention yet, much to the concern of other teachers. Apparently, all the kids still behaved better in Harry’s classes. Harry was responsible for the third years. They all wanted Harry to go with them to a certain store, they asked him what they should buy and what did he did at his first visit when he was a third year. He was honest. He spent time with his students, talking nonsense with them.
“They don’t get much time alone, so I don’t want to interrupt…do you want to bet on who’s going to win?”
“You could move to Grimaud Place.”- Said Harry without giving it a second thought. - “With the condition you redecorate it.”
“Yes, I would like to go” -Said harry.
“Sure, how were things with your parents?
“I’m sorry.”
“It’s not hiding. I just don’t want to give an interview to Witch Weekly.” Said Draco.
“Does it still surprise you?”
“Your father is a brilliant man. He found a loophole.” Said Narcissa. “He couldn’t get his wand back, though.”
After the classes were over, the four friends went to Hagrid’s home. Madame Maxime was there. She told them that she was supposed to arrive on Monday and that she was to have a proper welcome at the Great Hall, but she wanted to spend some time with Hagrid. Admitting this the four young men made her blush. Hagrid thought it was cute. They each drank a cup of tea before leaving, with a promise from Madame Maxime to let them borrow Hagrid during the next week. Ron mumbled that he wasn’t going to be there next week, but Draco elbowed him in the ribs to keep him silent. They promised not to tell she was already there.
It took Draco until March of 2005 to make a decent treacle tart, by everyone’s standards. Harry gained a few pounds because of it.
“Blaise, Gregory and Pansy. You won’t get much out of a conversation with them. Maybe only with Blaise, but I don’t want you two talking”
Harry was always amazed at how many things were at this store, apparently, so was Teddy. He quickly changed his attention from his godfather to the chocolate section of the store. Harry saw that Malfoy was smiling.
“We could go to my room upstairs.”- Whispered Malfoy, without looking at Harry.
“No offense, but your father isn’t powerful anymore. No one is scared of him. Even with a wand I’m sure I can take him down.”
“You are no longer a student, there is no need to call me professor.”- Said McGonagall.
“You are kind of my best friend. How sad is that, right?”
“I know, but in my opinion, it seems like both of you are raising Draco. He has learned a lot from you three…How’s he doing at Hogwarts, by the way?”
“Yes. Please. I’d like to keep seeing him.”-Said Harry. It was always good seeing Teddy. He reminds him of the good that’s left in the world, even after all the horrors of war.
They ended up getting a teddy bear from a muggle store. The baby was less than a week old, and his mother Mary Dursley looked completely fine. She was the one who opened the door for Harry and Draco and the two men were confused. They expected her to still be in recovery. Or something like that.
“What was that?”- asked Harry.
“Are you alright?”- asked Harry.
“What?”- asked Ron and Harry, at the same time.
, and continue to act as always around Harry. He definitely could do it. He would be able to look at Harry, make jokes and ask him about his classes without thinking on what he’s missing. He tried to avoid it, but he couldn’t help thinking about their kiss. He had a lot of alcohol last night, so his morning breath was
“Draco, my dear boy. Don’t worry about it. You should not spend your vacations trying to figure out you father’s evil plan. He has none. You should get a new hobby, get distracted…”
family. As I am their only son, I have to keep up the Malfoy name, or something like that.”- said Draco.
“Weasley, do you want to transform me into a ferret? Or make me throw up slugs. I can wear a silly dress for as long as you want, you can hit me on the face…I don’t care. If gaining the trust of every friend of Potter means that my relationship with Teddy will be easier, then I will do it. I don’t want him to grow up listening how bad I am from people that are close to him.”
“He is my boss, Ronald.”- She said, blushing. - “George is also worried, by the way. He thinks It wasn’t a good idea to have left Malfoy alone in your house during Valentine’s day.” – Said Hermione, smiling at Harry
“I was as surprise as you are. Even when Granger started screaming, I didn’t think it would affect me, but it did. It all got too real…the only redeemable action of my life was done out of fear.”
Harry gave his classes as always. He didn’t give them homework that day, but he confiscated 8 copies of the Daily Prophet. Most of the students didn’t care, but he was too tired to ignore the whispers of the ones who did. He didn’t want to explain to them that his relationship with Malfoy existed
They enter the chapel and sat on the last row. There were about 50 people in there and about 10 other arrived after them. Harry recognized aunt Marjorie and Malcolm, a friend of Dudley. He thought maybe some of the people were work “friends” of Vernon. When the ceremony started, he saw Dudley and thought he was bigger. Petunia was smiling and Vernon tried, but it looked like he was in pain. He turned white once he saw Harry. Then he saw the bride. She had a kind face and seemed delicate, almost week. She was happy.
“Percy was actually a good roommate, back in Hogwarts, so I don’t think he would be such a bad husband. Even if Penelope doesn’t agree with that” -Said Oliver, smiling at Percy.
“Yes, shut up… don’t question me. Shut up.” Said Hermione holding Viktor’s hand, between what seemed like contractions.
“Who is that?”- asked Ron, ignoring Hermione for a moment. - “The man talking with Fleur.”
“…No.”- said Dudley more seriously, after looking at Draco’s blushing face.
“I’m sorry, but you snore, man.”
“What? That could’ve been Andromeda not
“I won’t let that happen.” reassured Harry. “Don’t worry. Just think about how great the holidays are going to be with your parents knowing we are a couple.”
By the second week of April Teddy was 11 years old. Everyone was excited about him going to Hogwarts in a few months, even the Malfoys. Every time Teddy had to go with them, it was awkward. But he was used to it. He liked playing with the peacocks and the sweets Narcissa would bring him. Andromeda had to explain to him that the Malfoys didn’t approved of Draco anymore. So, when they arrived at his birthday party at Andromeda’s house no one knew how to react.
can’t.”
“Don’t listen to them, they are freaks.” He picked her up and she hugged him. “You are the smartest person here.” He took her away and she wave goodbye at Teddy and Harry.
Classes started again on the 8 of January. Harry could see a change in some students. Some came back with more energy and just generally happier, but others were gloomy. Those were the kids that had lost someone during the war. Harry saw it with the Weasleys, especially with George. They all tried to ignore it, but every once in a while, they would be looking sad. The Weasleys knew that to honour Fred they had to try to move on. Hermione told Harry that when one of the Weasleys realize they were becoming sad, they would go and try to make someone laugh, mostly George.
“I don’t think you need it…Maybe try to smile at the kids.”
“Give it time.” Teased Ron. “But you know, don’t you dare hurt Harry or else…I do care for you Draco, but I’ll take Harry’s side even if he’s wrong. So be careful.”
“Not really, George says he is in a creative slump and won’t let me help him. But apparently his son is giving him some ideas, so it is just a matter of time.”
“Obviously. Kreacher can prepare you dinner.”
“Yes, but it’s a weird subject.”
“You are so thoughtful… I was thinking you accepted the job because you missed me.”- This was clearly meant as a joke, still, Harry’s words sounded sincere. Harry noticed his own tone. Draco also noticed. Harry noticed that Draco noticed. - “I was kidding, I know I’m not that good of a friend.”
“Fine, let’s go talk to him.”- Said Harry, standing up and putting some money on the table.
“It’s still in the basement.”- Hermione mumble.
“So were you. It doesn’t change a thing. I wanted to kill him.”-Draco interrupted.
I used to believe I knew English. The first try was fun, until I had to read it again.
“You have strong legs. It’s not nice waking up in the middle of the night thinking someone is trying to kill me.”
“Harry James Potter, this is important.”
“I guess. I love Hannah…”
“He did it…” Draco muttered. “My father said he could convince the Ministry to revoke his home arrest.”
“What’s she doing?”- asked Harry.
Harry was driving and Draco was next to him, on the back seats was Ron, still unconscious, Viktor and Hermione. Hermione was telling Harry the directions to the hospital. “Call my parents.” She said as she gave a Motorola flip phone to Draco.
“Funny you chose this room. This used to be the room of the brother of Sirius.”- whispered Harry, afraid to wake up Teddy.
Once the Hallowe’en celebrations were over, Harry went to his room and took his invisibility cloak, hide it in his robes, and went to Hagrid’s home for a drink in honour of his parents. He took the invisibility cloak because of tradition and nostalgia. He knew he didn’t need it. As a professor he was free to roam the castle at whatever hour he deemed convenient.
“What do you mean
During the Sorting Ceremony, every house cheered for every kid. Minerva McGonagall introduced Harry and Neville as the new professors. The students started whispering about it, but soon enough they were back to taking and yelling among themselves. Harry could recognize some of the older kids. He couldn’t remember their names.
“Wait, Teddy, stop it now.” Said Harry, once he realized what his godson was saying.
“I tried to make apple sauce for Teddy once, but Andromeda had to guide me the entire process. Teddy liked it. But I can’t cook, I never had to.”
“Sure.”-Said Harry
At some point during the night, Draco arrived at Andromeda’s home, where Harry was spending the day with Teddy. Andromeda made tea for all of them, and they were talking on the living room, while they let Teddy play around so he could get tired and fall asleep. They talked about Remus.
“Oh, that’s right. You mention it before. Why did you fight with your father?” - asked Harry, remembering how Malfoy mention it when he went to Andromeda’s house.
“He has the right to have a free day per week. At least that’s what Granger wrote.”- Harry smiled at him.
“Do you know your sister and I were on the same year at Hogwarts?”- asked Harry when they were done.
“Draco, please leave us.” -Said Andromeda.
“…I thought he just took another room…”
“She is right, kid. All the students are most definitely going to love you and will learn a lot from your experiences. But I want you to remember to have fun, ok?" -Said Arthur.
“I Hope you figure it out.” -Said Harry.
Teddy brought them back to reality. He wanted to go home because he was already tired. Narcissa suggested they could stay for the night. “But I want my bed at Harry’s home.” Was Teddy response and it was enough of a reason for Narcissa.
It was a photo of Teddy, flying about fifty centimetres off the ground on a toy broomstick. It came with a note that said:
“I didn’t know you like chess.” - said Harry. - “You could’ve just asked him to play, he would’ve been so thrill to beat you.”
“He would care, you don’t know him.” Said Draco.
This relationship was the main topic of conversation for the first two weeks of the school year. The kids were hoping to catch their professors kissing, or something. Some drama. After the students saw that their professors kept interacting as usual, they lost interest.
Hermione was six months pregnant by then, and she was trying to spend more time with her family and friends. She would write letter to the people she couldn’t meet personally. This meant more work for her. She didn’t look tired, so Ron decided not to say anything. In the end she was busier than usual.
“But we are not.”
“Are you sad, Potter?”
They ate Christmas’s diner, mostly turkey and chipolatas, and as pudding a piece of wedding cake. Neville tried to include Malfoy in their conversations every time the rest ignored him, which both Harry and Malfoy appreciated. Andromeda came for Teddy at some point, so he could meet Victoire, he lost interest quickly in the baby and fall asleep. Most people were dancing, even McGonagall was dancing with both Xenophilius and Slughorn.
CH 12
upset. “This is Quidditch history in the making!” he had said. “So is our new daughter” answered Angelina. “She’s already made.” Replied George, which resulted in both his mother and his wife
“She’s saying goodbye to the ghosts of the castle.”
When the feast was over, the professors left, and the prefects took the kids to their dormitories. Draco and McGonagall left together, and Harry followed them.
happy.” – answered Draco.
“Well, at least every Slytherin was a but suspicious. Even professor Snape, I think.” Answered Pansy.
“They also made fun of you, and I didn’t want to tell you that.”- said Teddy to Draco.
On Saturday he went to Hogsmeade with Hagrid and Neville. Harry told them that next Monday he was going to talk to the kids about him and the war, and maybe even the time he spent alone. Start a conversation.
Draco’s relationship with Hagrid was a decent one, but after a couple of drinks they both turned into the best of friends. Drinking friends. The three of them had only a couple of drinks, but what they drank was made for giants. Hagrid’s new friends had warned him that the liquor was too strong for a half-giant. It definitely wasn’t made for humans.
“Not really. We want to talk to you.” Said Harry.
Draco took the paper from Harry and started reading. The information wasn’t wrong, but it was unnecessarily long and confusing. It was written by a Ravenclaw boy who had trouble organizing his thoughts.
“Hello Harry, Happy new year.”
Once they reach the top of the hill, Hermione made sure no muggle was watching and she procured a blanket for them to sit on. There were many young couples and groups of friends, and some small families already sitting on the hill. Some were having picnics, others were reading, most were just talking, and some young couples were being too affectionate for a public place.
They didn’t talk much after that. After drinking their tea, Harry played for a while with Juniper. Luckily, Mary had to go and breast feed Adler, so there weren’t more opportunities for her to ask questions.
“That’s Uncle Draco.” said Harry. The two men looked at each other, smiling slightly.
“That’s fair.”- said Harry.
“Yes, I learned in school, but mostly granny and Draco taught me.” He answered, looking at Harry to see if he was impressed. “School is boring, right?”
“We’ll spend the Holidays together”- said Andromeda- “I’ll talk to the Weasleys about it. And, Harry dear…Teddy won’t forget you; he loves you.”
Harry and Hermione were playing with Teddy. The toddler was mostly showing them all the teddy bears he had. Draco and Ron were playing chess, so they were not paying attention to Teddy, which seemed to upset him.
Teddy started to cry. Harry woke up and sat quickly in the bed, hitting Draco’s face with his own. In the time it took for them to feel pain, Kreacher already was in the room, trying to make Teddy stop crying.
In fact, they had to cancel Hermione’s birthday celebration. They had planned to have a small dinner at the Burrow, but Hermione said she couldn’t make it. She had already helped improve the work condittions of house-elves, and now she was helping Shacklebolt write some new reforms. She was practically sleeping in her office.
Once the sun was down and the city was dark, they took a double-decker bus to get to Grimmauld Place. Hermione said that the floo network or even the underground was more practical, but Draco really liked those buses. No one could argue with that. Draco was already familiar with the city, but he still acted a bit like a tourist. In a way he was. A wizard tourist in muggle London.
Since the first of September was on a Thursday, they got Friday off. When Harry came into the Great Hall for breakfast, there were only a few students, since most of them prefer to sleep late. There were only two professors, Draco and Sybill Trelawney. Professor Trelawney was reading Draco’s hand. Harry approached and sat next to Draco.
“If that fact makes you feel better, then I’m fine with it. But you don’t need to have a nice family to be nice yourself. They don’t have to define who you are.”
Kreacher was outside the room, close to the door listening to the conversation of the professors. He thought that Draco, a
that I’m dark and mysterious.”
about pregnancies, but since Ron was relaxing, she decided to ignore them.
“What is it?” -said Draco as he stood up to came closer to Harry.
“He is really changing. You should talk to him, judge for yourselves.”
“That’s definitely not my fault. Go talk with my parents.”
“Come home with us, I will help you find it…” said Narcissa, but she was interrupted.
“Because now it needs to stay like this for 30 minutes, then I take it out of the heat and wait until it’s cold.”- said the kid. - “So there’s no reason for me to wait here.”
“…Well, it’s getting late. We should go to sleep. Goodnight.”
Harry went back to his chamber at Hogwarts and he realized he had no formal clothes. So, he chose to wear dark jeans and a button up red shirt, he didn’t want the Malfoys to think he wanted to impress them. The thought of him wanting to impress Draco Malfoy
“See you tomorrow, professor Potter.”- said the kid once he leaved the classroom.
“Does Teddy know?” asked Ron, ignoring Harry.
“Hermione is pregnant?”- asked Harry, smiling.
“Isn’t she your landlady? You better not make her mad at you.”- said Harry.
Not only Viktor had done it, but other friends of his, famous quidditch players announced the same. So the school received even more
“Thank you, I’ll go to sleep. If Andromeda comes and sees you watching telly, I’ll say that I had told you not to.”
“Uh, no. sorry, it’s for your brother.” said Harry, a little embarrassed. “
“I can help Teddy become whatever he wants. If he wants to play Quidditch I recommend you take him to see your girlfriend’s games, maybe he will learn something, as long as you don’t teach him.”
“Well, I don’t like to hide.”
“I’m just talking about the brave decision my cousin made. He chose to be a better person, he is still working on it, but I think that in his way, he is making so much progress. He even got married."
Harry, Draco and Neville had one last drink at Hagrid’s home after the Leaving Feast. Hagrid was proud to announce that not a single child was harmed during his classes. Harry said that it was great, the other two men just smiled awkwardly.
And Draco was now looking at both of them. So, none of them were actually watching the sunset.
“He was nervous, but he kept his cool.” said Ron. “Does that mean that you were already a professional when you were 13?” he asked Viktor. “Are you 30 now, right?
“I don’t care about that. Besides, I need to keep an eye on you, since you are now a part of Teddy’s life. There is nothing I could do; you are a part of my life…” -Said Harry.
family would be fine if you go get married with a pureblood wizard?”- asked Seamus.
Harry went back to Hogwarts. It was only 10 pm but he felt exhausted. He didn’t revise his notes for Monday’s classes. He didn’t grade the homework. He just went to sleep.
Having Olympe Maxime watching over his classes turned out to be a new kind of stress for Harry. He was afraid of making a mistake in front of her. He did fine, according to Hagrid, and he wasn’t even being evaluated. Harry also learned that Draco tried to impress her the entire week and Neville gave her little tasks or asked her questions related to his class.
“Of course I want you here, you are my friend and…I suppose this could be fun.”- said Harry. - “Why didn’t you tell me?”
Every night Harry went to Hagrid’s house to drink and talk. His nights consisted of firewhiskey and manly tears. They never drank enough to make them drunk, of course. They were responsible adults. Hagrid talked about Madame Maxime. How they wrote to each other every other day. He was going to spend Christmas with her in France. Harry was happy for him.
“You could sell this in the muggle word. Instant hungover cure.” -said Harry once the burning feeling ended and he started feeling more awaked and filled with energy.
Draco took out his wand and used confundo to the man next to them. Harry noticed it and he did the same for the two men in front of them. The tree men looked at each other and then got out of the bus on the next stop.
“That’s why you are not a Ravenclaw.”- This made Harry laugh, which surprised Malfoy.
“Draco darling, why not?” asked Narcissa.
” she was angry now.
“That was a big part of it, really. I’m glad you are getting to know me.”
“Sure.”
“I don’t know…”
“Are you pretending to be Harry’s friend so that people will treat you better? - asked Ron, looking at Malfoy’s eyes.
“Mom would be so happy.”- Said George.
“Harry teaches Phys Ed. and I teach chemistry.” said Draco, receiving a thankful looked from both cousins.
“How to defend themselves.”
“So much trouble…No! Wait! I’m ready for this, look.” He took out his invisibility cloak and put it around himself, making space for Draco to came in. once the two of them were covered, they started walking towards the castle. Neither of them noticed that the cloak didn’t cover them completely.  If anyone were to look at them, they would see only four foots walking side by side, stumbling.
“Who is Greg?”
Harry focused on changing the subject when she began to thank him, he made everyone talk about Teddy again. He complimented Andromeda, and he mostly tried to ignore Lucius. And he kept following Draco’s discreet directions on how to eat “properly”.
It turned out, to Teddy’s disappointment, that his friend’s mum didn’t know.
“What? You didn’t tell me that.”- said Draco.
“Andromeda said she’s sorry, but she’ll arrive late.”- said Draco to Harry. Harry took Teddy from Draco.
“Happy new year. When did you arrived? Sorry for not welcoming you.”
“I know you are a teacher, but you can’t be a good one if you can’t even teach this boy to be respectful. But what could I expect from you?” continued Vernon, ignoring Teddy.
“What? He wouldn’t do that.”- said Harry, a little offended.
“They are fine. Actually, they might be coming here any moment now. It would be best if you leave.”
“Hermione hates me. I’m useless. She is going to marry Viktor.”
Ron lived with both Harry and Draco for the first week of July and then he decided to move out. He made a tiny apartment in the back of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they had their stockroom. George wanted to charge him rent. He settled on “hiring” Ron to be a night-guard in exchange for rent. So the inventory was now officially Ron’s responsibility.
Draco is smart, really. He knows it’s not exactly healthy to worry about the end of the relationship when it just started. He is afraid of ruining his life. For better or for worse, his life now depended on the people around him. Was that healthy? He wasn’t sure.
“They are fine. They are responsible adults who can talk things out and working together is not going to get in their nice relationship.” Said Neville.
“No, thank you. This is for you.”- Harry gave Kreacher a box of chocolates. - “can you please leave us alone for a moment.”
“You know I’m right, Malfoy.
“Technically, we are first cousins once removed. But yes, I’m uncle Harry.”
The next day they woke up almost at the same time. They stayed like that, just looking at each other. Harry was trying to look at Draco without his glasses, so he was making funny faces. This made Draco smile.
