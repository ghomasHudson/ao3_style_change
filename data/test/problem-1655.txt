Harry had said on the last day Draco had seen him, before sweetly kissing his forehead, then his lips. He supposes he's broken that promise, coming here.
"I said I've got it!" Malfoy protests, but Harry's already batting his hand aside. "Saint Potter strikes again! Got to show me up with a bit of do-goodery, have you?"
"It's not that I don't believe you, you know." Harry's voice grows softer still, and closer. "I understand we were married. I understand it was you who found me after everyone gave me up for dead, and I'm grateful." Draco sees two denim-clad knees as Harry kneels in front of him, but still he won't look up. "But even with everything I saw with Ron and Hermione's help—I just don't feel that way about you." A pause. "I don't hate you, Draco. I want to be friends."
"It's been my dream to lord it over you ever since I met you, so yes," Harry says with another laugh.
"Ah." Harry takes Draco's hand again. "So you agree, you were stupid to go off on your own without waiting for trained officers of the law to lead the charge?" And he grins, the wanker.
"Neither was reading rotting old books by candlelight when you were only eleven, I bet," Harry volleys back, his grin crinkling his eyes dramatically. "We all end up in specs in the end, anyway." He points around the four of them, and he's right—where Harry used to be the only one in glasses, now all four of them have to wear glasses, though Hermione insists hers are only for reading and keeps them anywhere but on her face, which means she perpetually loses them. Draco's were new last year.
Walking brushes the rust from Draco's brain, lets his thoughts connect all the quicker, flowing into each other seamlessly. There are much fewer glances his way in the Auror offices, now that the Aurors have gotten used to their mean-faced new mascot, so Draco sets off around the track, which is to say the floor around the centralized pack of Auror desks.
Draco sighs, too, looking Harry up and down. He looks so fiercely confident—he wouldn't let her. "Of course you'd say that."
"You've been alone," Draco says slowly, as he moves an equally slow hand toward Harry's wand, "for a long time. I've come to take you home."
"I approve this," Potter says, handing the sketch back to Draco. Draco's fingers feel numb as he grasps the parchment. "Unless there are more, er, measurements."
First, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan. Dean and Seamus married during Harry's absence from the world, and Harry seems genuinely happy for them, but when he and Draco move on, he mutters that he must be a rotten friend to have missed that entirely. Next is Cho Chang, on the toned arm of Katie Bell; Harry and Draco are each surprised for very different reasons. ("I thought Katie Bell was single," Draco said afterward, just as Harry said, "I thought Cho was straight!") Draco saves face by complimenting Cho on her midnight blue silk dupioni gown, with sleeves that split in an overlap from the elbow to reach the floor, and a structured, geometric sweetheart neckline he finds quite chic. And then—
"Are you going to throw me off so you can reach the remote, then?" Draco asks. He turns his face just enough to kiss Harry's thumb.
The fridge is open as Draco enters the room, Potter's back to the stairs as he puts his groceries inside. When Potter stands, his ears seem to twitch, and he looks back to find Draco standing awkwardly at the bottom of the stairwell.
Then Harry lets go, everything in his face softening. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Draco. I can't even apologize without scaring someone."
"Don't know what that's supposed to mean," Malfoy says, without turning around. At this distance he's less of a man and more of a white blur, and Harry speeds up to bring him back into focus.
it?" He gets no answer as Pansy heads back to her station, giving the dressform sporting the Minchin job a thoughtful spin.
"You would have wisely stayed the course, because I have excellent taste, which will rub off on you in due time. Then you'll stop wearing stretched out jumpers, and I can know peace."
"Do you?" Draco comes to stand in front of Harry, and Harry bows his head. He slides the headpiece into Harry's thick curls, tucking the ends of the headband behind his ears. It's hard not to run his fingers through those curls.
She pouts, but makes her way back to the other side of the desk. Her halo pixies are back to simple cavorting; Draco must be out of the woods. Pansy gives the second client request a good overview, and nods. "Rachna has space on her plate, and she'll do well with this one." She takes the quill Draco offers her, signing the client request, and it duplicates itself, one copy vanishing to its proper place in filing. Pansy sends the remaining copy beneath Draco's closed door, out to Rachna's inbox at her work station.
The knob turns. Pertinger's head snaps forward, her eyes locked on the door, and as Potter enters, she begins to scream.
. Then, of course, the endless parade of hugs and goodbyes that will have to be repeated for every departure after theirs. All the while, Lily is practically twisting by the door with her need to leave.
Draco groans, sliding down in his seat until his back is flush with the bottom cushion, his knees at awkward angles in front of him. "I should have known better than to ask you."
The next few hours are shockingly fine. For all that he brought the biggest bottle of alcohol in the room, Draco nurses a single glass of it all the while, with the notion that if he does need to make an emergency Apparition to the moon, he'll need his sobriety for it. He mostly lurks near Harry's conversations, contributing little except his presence. Draco doesn't know what to say to any of these people, really, but Harry has become a regular chatterbox anyway. He keeps touching Harry throughout the night, just a hand on his back or fingers sliding across the back of his hand, to remind him he's here.
"Of course you are." Draco glances up and sees Potter hiding a smirk behind his free hand. "Now you are, I mean."
Draco gasps as he pushes himself up on his arms, holding up his wand. He doesn't know why he still has it; Griselda had every opportunity to pull it from his hand when she had him by the throat, and even now, she could disarm him any time she wanted. "
"What do you mean, he hasn't spoken to you? I thought it was you who'd cut him out," Draco says, then registers Weasley's words. "Ah—Potter, is what I said—"
nobody invited her and her pincushion. Besides, they're not listening to us. Look at them." And Draco does.
Draco finds the quietest way to the stairs, and makes his way down the very edges of the steps until he's safely out of earshot. He's got to hurry back to the atelier.
"If you're going to do that, I'm going to do this," Harry says, and before Malfoy can say another word, Harry's pointed his wand at Malfoy's boots and given them real traction, as well as bulking them up with a cushiony lining that ought to protect Malfoy's feet and ankles better.
Past the glut of people around the Floo-enabled fireplace, the crowd thins out into more reasonable knots of Gala guests, holding flutes of Champagne and laughing as servers in crisp white robes flit about with trays of hors d'oeuvres. Other guests bunch up at the round tables, plates heaped with selections of those hors d'oeuvres, swirling massive goblets of red wine as they listen to each other. A good deal of the guests are Ministry employees, or so Harry told him; Draco only recognizes those wearing Malfoy Couture.
has a career, a spouse, and children, and I daresay she carries the heavier load in that family. Because of who she is as a person," he adds, when Harry narrows his eyes. "Nothing to do with Weas—with Ronald, naturally."
they say—no search is launched. When Draco presses that he ruddy well doesn't care about "the panic" if he hasn't got a husband anymore, he's told that putting out a search for Harry Potter could jeopardize his mission, if it's still underway.
the things I let slide because darling, I love you so much, and I know what you're like." Oh, Draco knows better than to trust that syrupy smile, and he's right, because she shakes his chair violently until he finally slides right out, landing on the floor with an undignified sound.
"You liked it! You called it art!" Draco can feel the blood in his face, past the point of mere blotchiness and turning him purple. The humiliation rips through him, transmogrifying into an overwhelming urge to degrade Potter until he feels as terrible as Draco does now. And when Draco pulls that urge back, as he's learned to do so many times in his adult years, it feels like swallowing a knife whole.
"Right, I knew that," Draco huffs, hiding behind an even bigger, sloppier stack. "I appreciate it, Head Auror Potter, but the manor is well-stocked with desks, and my work doesn't demand the sight of you wiggling your wand about in front of me—" He goes beetroot red behind his armful of parchment and he keeps it up like a fence. "I can work alone!"
Malfoy goes pink, cross-eyed with glaring at his own nose all of a sudden, and disappears underwater to resurface a few feet away, swimming doggedly for the center of the pond.
"I was only trying to say," Potter says, once he's swallowed, "that you do good work. Whatever you put me in will be miles better than anything I could choose for myself." He takes another slow bite, eyes firmly averted from Draco's face.
"I'm being honest with him," Ron says, gesturing at Draco. "I'm not going to puff him up with horseshit and see him trying to run into Harry's arms before the time is right. It's a kindness, Hermione."
"I've been busy." Draco fixes his eyes on the back of his mother's head once he's spotted her, and wills her with every ounce of his nonexistent mind power to come and give him some silly task that requires him to be elsewhere.
"Civil of me. Reasonable of me. Hardly generous. Just because I don't call you by your father's name doesn't mean I'm ready to pin awards to your robes." Williamson seems to chuckle at his own little joke.
"I don't know if it's because of something I said, or the pre-Gala workload, or—or working for Harry god damn Potter that set this off," Pansy says, and now the wobble in her voice is back, "but I think we really do need to consider what's best for both you and the atelier. You'll still be an owner, of course, but you need to take some time away, at the very least. Rehabilitate."
"Idiot, am I?" Harry says, and he lets go right when Malfoy's balance is at its worst. "Whoops! Clumsy idiot, that's me." Malfoy shrieks, and Harry catches him by the front of his tailored button-down shirt at the last second before he tumbles end over end down the incline.
The wait is a bit longer than he expected, and by the time Harry returns with something hidden behind his back, Draco's gotten up to inspect the bookshelves without anything else to do.
"I said stop saying words!" Draco gathers up as much of the robe as he can, and lobs it at Potter's head. Most of the robe doesn't make it to its target, but Potter sputters as heaps of fabric slap him in the face. The linen set follows quickly, and it's all Potter can do to catch them while in the process of picking up the masses of outer robe on the floor.
his atelier work plus his secret project, and he really thought he'd succeeded, sleep deprivation aside. (What skilled professional hasn't gone without sleep every so often? It's perfectly normal.) Now he sees he hadn't, not at all, and worse, he doesn't know
"I am not. I'm grumbly." Draco weaves his fingers together across his lap, frowning as he leans against the back of his chair. "What do you want me there for? Don't you want an intimate reconnection with Granger and Weasley?"
But he can't think about any of those things. He can only think of putting his hand on the door to the shack, which doesn't have a door knob so much as a hole to pull it by.
"I just think it would behoove you, as a man in his thirties, to care about food on this level on a regular basis," Draco says as he pours Harry a second glass. He feels warm from the wine and the sun, and from sitting so close to Harry.
Draco mouths Larch's words with a cartoonish sneer and pop of his eyebrows as he collects his bag. Potter had never given him back his research, so he can't even cross reference from memory, and his bag looks deflated and sad without parchment stuffing it to its black leather gills. Larch walks so close at his heels he threatens to step on them as he escorts Draco to the door, and Draco is left to twiddle his thumbs while Larch fails twice to produce the correct key to lock up. When Larch follows him to the lifts he wants to say something cutting about being able to find his own way out, but it's not like Larch doesn't need to go home, too.
why you're changing it. Not because I'm right," she says, with the smile of a spider eyeing a hapless fly.
"No." Malfoy still won't look at Harry. "No, I suppose it's not, but that's true of anybody, isn't it? And yet somehow, telling myself that the great Harry Potter had it worse does not make it any easier to bear."
Following behind Potter, he's astonished to realize the man's grown several inches since they were both 17, which doesn't seem right. Potter towers over everyone in the office as he sweeps through with his hands clasped behind his back, and he only lets Auror Larch know he's leaving. He says nothing to Draco in the lift, but gives tiny polite nods to the Ministry employees entering the lift as he and Draco depart into the lobby.
"How do you know my middle name?" Harry wants to know, pulling out the front of his T-shirt in both hands to inspect it. "And Hermione would threaten to reveal I haven't got an Apparition license, if you're trying to do an impression of her."
Draco takes a seat at the drafting table, tapping the lamp above it into life. The current Potter design, with its glimmering wildlife and sumptuous heavy silk, lies centered on the table's surface. It's absolutely beautiful, still; just as glorious as Draco had said it would be, to himself and to Pansy. He traces bony fingers over its swooping lines, its delicate stippling to represent beading.
"What are you muttering about?" Harry's voice asks, just behind Draco, and Draco just about spits his heart out.
Eleven months. Mrs. Weasley brings him a mountain of cooked food after Ron apparently tells her about Draco's empty kitchen. Draco realizes, after she's left, that she's put away Harry's spices and hung up the pan on the stove.
Draco frowns, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, and he and Hermione snip a few more plants in silence before Ron comes back into the garden with a new basket for them.
"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy." Potter cuts him off as simply as if Draco were a student and he a professor.
"Harry, you look marvelous," Luna says, smiling widely to match the way she spreads her arms. Harry gives her an awkward hug, mainly because of the question of how one
Draco is sincerely flabbergasted, and his wand nearly rolls off his lap as it falls from his fingers. "Blaise, I—" And he understands. "I'm so sorry."
Harry feels his face with the back of his hand; still pretty warm, but he thinks all the most damning signs of his shame have faded. "What are you going to do, break down the door for the pleasure of my company?"
"And yet you showed up anyway," Harry says, smirking at Draco as he passes him by on the steps. He taps his hand to the front door, and it swings open gently. "Not too good for a bit of impurity, are you?"
of it, and it's just about all he can talk about the next time he sees Dr. Fiddlewood. That, and his ongoing attempts to get Harry Potter to rejoin the world of people with friends.
"Like this." Draco mimics Harry's grip on his arms, and makes a face he knows is a ridiculous impression of Harry's intense stare. Then, with a deep voice, he says, "I'm sorry, Draco, for getting handsy with you and then going into hiding over it."
"I can't promise any of that, least of all the extradimensional portals," Draco snorts, giving that thumb a brief kiss. "You shouldn't have married a dark wizard if you wanted to avoid all that."
"A mixup?" Potter leans over, and Draco can't see what he's doing but there's a crinkling sound. "I suppose there's been a run on whole milk, then?" He can hear the smile in Potter's voice, see it for himself when Potter straightens. "I left my phone some odd place, I'm sure, but two percent will do, it's no trouble."
The door is flung open, and Draco finds himself looking down at a very miniature brown-skinned Ron Weasley, staring him down with Hermione Granger's intelligent, calculating eyes. "Weasley residence, what do you ruddy well want?" the child wants to know, before two arms loop about his waist and hoist him off his feet.
But Draco—a man who downplays his own problems but won't let Harry do the same—Draco puts Harry back together and then pulls him into that storm to brave it together. Harry feels as though he breathes new air when he's with Draco, clean and sharp after rain.
"No, it's horrible and unkempt," Draco sniffs, turning his face into the wind to hide the way he's blushing, as well as hoping the wind will cool his hot skin. "I'd die if I had your hair."
Draco pulls a scrap of parchment from his bag, and fusses with the outer pocket until he's extracted a bedraggled self-inking quill to write his address on it. He presses it into her hand, even as she takes a step back. "Owl me," he says, low and urgent, "if they do. Or if they don't, and they—I just need to know if Pertinger's the only one."
. Many things in Draco's life have certainly been malicious, but this? Draco thought he'd been giving Potter a gift.
"What matters more, Potter?" Draco wants to know, taking one bold step toward Potter. Just one, because he's still cautious. "Making sure I feel excluded, putting me in my place? Or solving this case before even more people die?"
"Please ask him to at least owl us, even if it's just a single word on a scrap of parchment," Granger says.
Draco wants to shout, but he can't play coy now. He crosses his arms over his desk, leaning down to rest his pointed chin at their crux.
Then Harry grouses about work; he hates the paperwork, the gladhanding, the oversight. He quietly admits he could use a change from all the literal horrors of the job, too, but it's clear he doesn't want to discuss that further. Instead he complains about Auror Larch always being halfway up his arse, trying to impress him, and Draco does what he thinks is a fabulous impression of Larch's excitable brown-nosing.
Draco wants to draw himself up and tell Blaise he's doing the same, but he doesn't know what to call Harry besides
, he has to remind himself. There's still so much more work to be done, when he looks at it, but there's enough complete to get not only the gist, but a fitting done as well. He just has to hope Pansy won't crucify him for asking for the headpiece on Monday; he hasn't come up with quite the right lie yet to justify its existence.
"Of course." In a life full of doubts, this is one issue where Harry is always sure. "Don't you?" The words come out before he realizes what he's saying. "I mean—"
"Oh, he's not that bad," Draco says, but he knows Blaise is probably right. Harry's spotted him now, making eye contact across the room. "I'm going to go see what Harry's up to."
Potter approaches Draco, giving him a single push that topples him onto the enormous bed. It's embarrassing, really, how gentle a push it took to tip him over; nearly as embarrassing as how much it turned Draco on, if he's honest.
When it's clear Draco is getting nothing else out of Potter, Draco clicks his tongue. "Fine. Here's what you'll wear," he says, quill scratching across the parchment in a hurry. "A Muggle-styled suit. Three pieces. Grey wool herringbone. " The design taking shape beneath his hand looks as lumpen as it is generic, but it's clear Potter only tapped him to be able to say he was wearing Malfoy.
"I don't even know what some of those words are." Potter frowns, his eyes darting to look at Draco's measuring tape with wariness.
"I'm happy to pay you for your time, of course," Potter says, and Draco realizes he's being dismissed. Dismissed
Harry's face splits with a massive grin, and suddenly Draco is being Side Alonged. Draco comes out the other end spluttering, tearing away from Harry to run his hands along his body checking for signs of splinching—Harry hadn't needed to make it so
"There aren't enough chairs out here," Blaise announces as he enters the yard with his cup of coffee, and duplicates the wicker furniture around the unlit fire pit until there's enough seating for all the adults behind him.
Harry's eyes are red-rimmed, and his glasses are smudged from being mashed against Draco's skin, but he's not actively crying, and Draco will take that win. "But I have to."
"No more field trips," Potter says. "The Ministry hired you on as a scholar—a source of information and research at the Auror department's convenience."
Potter frowns, gazing into the center of a yellow flower as if he might find the answer there. "I—I didn't think I'd run into anyone."
"Yes, you keep muttering," Potter chuckles. "I think the inside words are becoming the outside words, Malfoy."
"Bet you can do better than that," Harry offers. He plucks blades of grass from the space between his feet, rolls them between his fingertips until they become green thread. "Get ahead of it."
"Level Two," the lift's smooth voice sings out, and Draco is already slipping through the doors as it lists the associated offices of Magical Law Enforcement. His quick pace is meant to look as though he's walking with purpose, rather than hurried along by his own anxiety; he thinks it might be working. If he's walking too fast to see if anyone's looking at him, that's just a bonus.
The grin that unfurls across her face is one that Draco knows spells chaos. "One more time, Malfoy, I'm hard of hearing in my old age."
Draco should feel relieved. His heart should fold its nervous wings, slide back down his throat and settle back into place. He can finish his pinning and hurry back to the atelier, make his escape before Potter can think twice.
"Well, I did it because I knew I could help and you weren't doing too well, but clearly I made a mistake," Harry says, rolling his eyes as he gets to his feet. "Most people say thanks when they're given help, you know."
"I suppose I could let the old place go on without a razing," Draco says. He sets his organizational spells to continue without his conducting, and turns to Harry with a sober expression. "Do you still have all my work on the spell?"
"Fancy seeing you here," Blaise's voice murmurs into Draco's ear from behind, and Draco nearly jumps out of his skin.
Ron sighs. "I dunno, mate. We were both pretty checked out by the end, I didn't stop to ask if he'd remembered how to be in love with his old school rival yet."
"If that's what you call teasing, you've gotten a lot thinner skinned since we were children," Harry says, as frustrated as he is lost. "What am I even teasing you about?"
"Shut up," Draco snaps, slapping his free arm over his admittedly erect nipples. The Great Hall is set to a temperature more suited to the Ministry peons in their layers of robes, not an aging peacock in what amounts to fishnet and cheesecloth. "I can't believe you didn't tell me you were coming."
—sits highlighted at his drafting table, the lamp always on to remind him of his goal when his body aches from lack of sleep, his eyes sore, his fingers trembling.
"I'm not nervous!" Draco squawks, voice breaking on the last word. Harry breaks out into full-on laughter. "I'm perfectly calm, it's you and your stupid volatile emotions that ought to be nervous!"
Their love is different, that much is true—a tree cut down to its roots by a single, vicious act. After everything, Draco's come to understand his marriage would never reset back to that morning when he last said goodbye to Harry.
Draco holds the organza robe out, the weight of all the golden embroidery giving it a perfect drape even without a body to fill it out. Nausea burns inside him. "You don't have to hide," he says, voice much smaller than intended, "if you don't want to."
"Lord help me. Why don't you pick one, Malfoy? Seems like you know all the pitfalls I can't see in this conversation."
"Wobbly." Draco snorts. His hands open and clench in his lap, and he tucks them under his thighs to still them. "How do you cast a wobbly charm, Potter?"
Draco looks up, startled. His vibrato heart climbs into his throat as he looks into Harry's eyes for the umpteenth time today, and this time they're soft, shining with something unidentifiable that frightens Draco. He doesn't know what Harry means but he knows what he
"No," Draco rasps, breaths shallow. He grips his wand with tight, pale knuckles. "Stay here." And he rises.
"Harry." Draco hesitates, but only for a moment as Harry watches him. Harry's face is so open, trusting. He
Griselda bursts out laughing. "Harry, is it? Are you on a first name basis with the Savior? You, son of Useless Malfoy? Oh, that’s funny." She shakes her head, still chuckling. "Do you think he might come find you? I hope so."
Harry takes one of Draco's hands, his fingers terrible brands against Draco's skin, and puts it on the cover of the album. "I just didn't realize, before now," Harry says, so soft it's almost a whisper, "how serious this is for you, and I should have."
"Just not this particular thing." His smirk grows wider, and it hasn't been so long since Hogwarts that Harry doesn't still want to slap it off his face, at least a bit.
There's a loud crack as one of the straps breaks open, and Pertinger's wand hand rises like the grasping hand of an Inferi, before pointing its phantom wand at Potter. "
Within hasty moments, Draco is shod, cloaked, and armed with his wand, striding through the portal without so much as a message left to anyone who might look for him. The irony is not lost on him, but this is
"I'm rightfully critical, is what I am, and that's why we're business partners," she corrects, holding up one finger.
Heat floods Draco's face as he reads Harry's rather commanding words. He can think of so many replies that would nip this in the bud, such as
Draco hurls his every scrap of relevant parchment onto his desk before going about the task of spreading them out in tactical arrangements. His mind is on fire with it. When the door bangs open behind him, Draco's whole body goes on alert, and he turns around just in time to nearly be trampled by a wave of Aurors in their regulation scarlet robes. He can't see Potter at the head of the pack as the man's already passed him and his cubicle, but Auror Larch bobs at the edge of the stream as it begins to disperse, trying to call out to Potter in the politest way he can without keeping his voice down.
"I haven't been connected to the Floo Network in years," Harry grumbles. "What if someone notices? Someone nosy?"
"No!" Harry protests, and he shoves at Malfoy's shoulder, but given Malfoy's already on the ground, it doesn't do much. "I mean it, I just—didn't tell anyone, given I barely had a chance with Cho."
"I didn't say that." Draco finds the little stairs at the far side of the dais, hurrying down them; he can't quite hop down in a dress and four inch heels.
. He clears his throat. "My apologies, Mr. Potter," he says, which immediately feels wrong in its formality. He should make a pact with himself to never interact with anyone he ever knew before hitting puberty. Correction, before reaching adulthood, period. He turns his attention to his fresh parchment before he can catch sight of Potter's reaction.
"Hullo, darling," Pansy says with a wicked grin as Draco hauls Harry over. That is, Harry is being hauled along until he
He taps his wand back to his satchel, and opens the satchel as a proper bag, though it's been Expanded, of course. "Anyway—" Draco's voice cracks. Maybe he's not meant to speak today. "Anyway! I'm pompous enough to have assumed you would like the new sketch, and I was right, so I'm vindicated in my choice to create a mockup for fitting." He pulls a linen robe from his satchel first, followed by trousers, both the undyed color of oats. And then he pulls silk faille out, and more faille, and more, and more, Potter's eyes widening with each armful of fabric Draco extracts from the satchel.
That doesn't stop Draco from feeling just as strange as he taps the insides of Potter's knees, then again because his thighs are still touching each other despite Potter having obeyed the first set of taps. If he thought Potter ran hot when he was all but hugging him for his chest and waist measurements, it's nothing in comparison to the absolute
It was a bright, dewy morning that dawned across Diagon Alley, spring finally beating back winter's chill. No shops were open yet, but shop owners and clerks alike still darted through jangling doors with steaming cups of coffee and tea, readying their stores for the day's commerce. It was Thaddeus Dendron, the opening attendant at Madam Malkin's who noticed the shambling figure coming up the street, his hand still on the door's handle as he held it partially open.
"You might not be evil as a grown man, but you'll never stop being a git." The barkeep delivers Harry's stew with an unceremonious thunk, and eyes both Harry and Malfoy.
"I think it does make me look good to have you on my arm," Harry snickers, apparently feeling better enough to heckle Draco. Draco pulls away from Harry's grasp so he can slap at Harry's arms with both hands.
"Given I was invited," Draco points out as he chooses a seat in a Chesterfield armchair near the unlit fireplace, draping his cape over its back, "I rather think the implication is fair." Potter's posted himself on a matching Chesterfield sofa, catty-corner to Draco's seat and facing the fireplace. The whole room is kitted out in tufted leather seating, with dark paneled walls that match the walnut side tables. Draco's almost surprised Potter didn't make his dramatic appearance in a quilted Muggle house robe, puffing a pipe.
"I'll just leave, shall I?" Draco says with a scowl, and makes a great show of turning around to do just that.
Harry bursts into surprised laughter, and Draco hazards a glance over his shoulder to see that Harry's laughs are sincere, bending him double in his chair.
"I think you can," Draco says, with no actual clue as to the legalities of giving a Ministry contractor vague medical information.
"She would have liked that, I bet." Harry leans forward, elbows on his knees. "I suppose you know I've finished my Legilimency healing sessions with Hermione."
The house above the basement isn't in much better shape. The air is much more breathable, if nothing else, but the walls and scant furniture bear the marks of a big fight. Chunks taken out of door frames, legs blasted off end tables, holes gouged into walls. Smears of long-dried blood painted over all of it.
"I should leave." Draco begins to rise to his feet to do just that, but Pansy wrenches him back down with a shockingly strong arm.
"Can't tell you what a letdown this is," Harry says, canting his face up to kiss Draco, small and chaste.
Draco spends his earliest hours in the atelier that morning working on the embroidery and beading of the black organza robe, only too happy to finally be able to work on it where work belongs. His other client work for the Gala is finished, which technically includes Harry's previous ensemble, but now he's got to work out what he wants to wear. It'll have to hit that sweet spot between the drama a Gala deserves, and the ease of motion needed to be Harry's on-site emergency tailor. It'll be hard to cross the room quickly to Harry's aid if he's sporting, say, a peacock tail scaled to his human body.
Draco clutches his wand to his chest as he throws himself against the stone floor bodily, rolling away from Harry. "Harry, just listen to me!" he cries, but Harry is all gritted teeth and grabbing fingers. "It wasn't what you thought! I was talking about—"
"Shall I go on?" Malfoy asks, with a nervous smirk that tells Harry he's actually asking, as much as he's trying to be funny.
"No! No, not at all," Harry says with the last of his laughter, before taking a seat at the kitchen table with Granger. "I mean, good that she, er, knows about gay people."
Potter sets the organza aside between them, shifting to stand. "Do you need to go into the studio today?"
Oh, Merlin. Merlin, Circe, Hecate, all of them, because there's no way Draco can say no to any of that. Not to Potter's plaintive face by the light of the office's hearth, and not to his firm insistence that it's important Draco follow him home, capped with the use of his first name. He's hopeless.
"I'm not making you a bloody headpiece for the Gala," Pansy says with a scowl, when she senses Draco coming near with intentions to ask for just that. His boyhood skill at Occlumency has worn off at last, or he's just
"Unbelievable. Absolutely staggering." Draco runs his hand down his face, thumb and forefinger gliding down each side and pulling at the corners of his eyelids. "It will clearly surprise you to learn that I prefer
Harry laughs. It's strange to realize that what he has with Malfoy isn't arguing, it's banter. This is Malfoy being friendly. Harry wonders if Malfoy wasting his time today was less a devious plan and more Malfoy not knowing how else to spend time with another human being.
"We'll get it," Harry tries to reassure him, but he doesn't sound too sure, himself. It's been days, and there've been no breakthroughs on how to manipulate the Trace to transcend its usual surface touch—Harry made mention of getting dinged by the Ministry, just before second year, for a spell cast by Lucius's errant house elf. Working with the Trace as a base spell is working with a flawed foundation, but especially without a wand, Draco can see no other avenue for it.
"Fine! Fine." Malfoy makes a great big show out of crossing his arms, rolling his eyes, and sighing dramatically. "I was hoping for a bit of company. There, are you happy?"
"I've gathered I'm older than I think," Harry says with a shrug. "But by my count, I'm twenty-three."
Instead, he takes a bite. The pasta is creamy, nutty, complex despite its simplicity; the bucatini is cooked perfectly
The taxi comes a touch too soon, leaving Draco scrambling to gather everything necessary while cursing Harry for being a hermit who refuses to reconnect his house to the Floo network. When the driver says Draco's name to confirm the passenger he's picking up, he pronounces it "Drah-co," and Draco is too busy stuffing the items in his arms into his satchel instead, which does
He takes cautious steps deeper into the house. Rather than a kitchen, living room and dining room, there's a single room containing the elements of all three that Draco might call a den. A table by a shabby armchair holds a leatherbound journal; it looks handmade, and like it's seen a fair amount of use. He touches a single, hesitant finger to its edge, and when no curse flies from its cover, he picks it up and lets it fall open to a random page.
"I'm not looking at you like anything," Draco lies with a scoff. "Are you sure you're alright to Apparate us, Harry? We could—"
"When Rose was born, and Hugo, too," Ron continues. "Not that Harry was there in the room when they popped out—"
"Don't butter me up," Draco says, letting his eyes slide closed. "My head's big enough already. Look at my forehead."
This time it's Draco who's silent, working diligently to pin the minute adjustments to the robe that will make its shape sing, harmonizing with the enchanted embroidery.
"Even though I am who I am?" He doesn't mean to be so direct, but all this candidness is infectious. He crosses his arms like Williamson, but where Williamson's rangy muscles make the pose look confident and powerful, Draco knows it just makes him look guarded, which he is.
"Oh, god, no," Harry says with a shudder, and when Malfoy's mouth starts to twist into a sneer—and that would be his expression for being offended, wouldn't it—he adds, "I just would like to come to the pub to have a pint, some grey stew, and, er, some light conversation."
"They told me a few other things, as a matter of fact," Draco continues. His thumb is getting tired, so he switches to his index finger, holding Harry's hand with just one of his own. "They never cut you off."
Weasley nods, apparently agreeing despite himself. "Tell him that, will you, Malfoy? My wife's always right."
Harry's with his people. He's happy, he's safe, he's comfortable. As Harry tells Charlie he feels silly for having been so nervous about coming to the Gala, Draco slips his fingers from Harry's, and lets himself be swallowed up by the crowd.
"Oh, stop it," he huffs, but she starts cackling. "If I'm a muppet, you're a cow, and what a pair we make."
"This feels less like an exchange between business partners and more like being told off by someone's mum," Draco grumbles. Certainly not
"Who needs a duvet when I've got you, eh?" Harry says with a grimace on the fifth night, peeling Draco's arm off his chest. "You'd think it was mid-July with how overheated you've got me."
"It's not as simple as saying all is forgiven," Hermione says, just soft enough for Draco's ears and not for the men bustling in the kitchen. "I was genuinely traumatized, navigating so much bigotry—as a girl, as a Black girl, and then learning at eleven there was yet one more thing people could want to hate me for. To hurt me for."
"Oh, shut up," Harry sighs, and he starts pawing at the wall in an attempt to haul himself up. Malfoy rolls away onto his belly, and then has about as much luck as Harry in getting to his feet. It takes them both a few minutes.
Draco had gotten up into the attic early in the day, coughing into the dust even as he spelled it away from him. Wrought iron garden furniture, coated in flaking white paint that showed the oxidation beneath, was piled in a corner. And Draco does mean
"Let me guess, your father will hear about this?" Harry snickers, pressing a wad of napkins into Malfoy's questing hand.
teasing me," Draco murmurs against the rim of his glass. Harry only knocks his knee against Draco, looking at him so fondly Draco is overwhelmed in an instant.
"I'm not sorry for hitting you with a Patronus for trying it," Harry says, dunking his spoon back down. He doesn't even have to blow on the stew because it's not hot enough.
"Don't you wish!" Malfoy bellows, running into Harry because he's taken a moment to turn his shouting mouth in the barkeep's direction. "Move it, Potter!"
"It's a manor, and we had a few, yes," Draco says, smirking with satisfaction as the sofa is finally fully unearthed, "but I like things organized in my way."
For a moment, Hermione's cool gaze makes Draco think he should have kept his mouth shut, let their strange peace continue unaddressed. Then she reaches for his hand, and Draco lets her take it, unsure but willing to do anything.
"They ought to put a light in that closet," Harry says, thinking absently of his cupboard. Suddenly his exhaustion envelops him, alcohol and a long day of hiking up and down a mountain and an early morning all crashing together to make him long for his bed in his cottage. He opens his mouth to say they ought to get a move on—
Everyone is so happy to see Harry, though, that they keep filling his glass. Wine, lager, Firewhiskey, some vodka from a bottle with Viktor Krum's smarmy face on it, all of it keeps pouring into Harry's glass and then down Harry's throat. He's so happy to see his friends, in turn, that he never says no, just an increasingly slurred "Cheers!" that gets returned by the friend doing the pouring.
Out of the four, Pertinger only tries to curse the Healer, though she doesn't try nearly as hard as she did to curse Potter.
His time with the Auror's offices hasn't even been two weeks yet. His bereavement leave has finished, but just barely. "Yes," he says, a little later than he should. "Under Head Auror Potter, working on the Venari Virtute case."
In all his embarrassment, Draco didn't hear Harry shuffling behind him. A hand, Harry's hand, reaches to turn his face, and Draco only has a moment to realize what's happening, to see Harry's soft gaze meeting his, before he's being kissed.
"Right then," Harry says, "lovely to see you and your family, nutters that you all are. Bye." He pulls Draco tight to his body, and Side-Alongs him back to Grimmauld Place.
The third reason the spell took so long to construct is because it's powerful. As it leaves Draco's wand, it embarks on a trip around every inch of the globe, hunting for Harry's magic, and his alone. It will seek him where the air is thinnest, and where the water is darkest. It will look for him in every crowded city and every lonely plain. Wherever Harry is on this planet, Draco's spell will find him someday, dead or alive. And when it does, it will open a portal—all Draco will have to do is step through.
"He gave me a flower," Draco murmurs, before he remembers that isn't an answer to Dr. Fiddlewood's question.
"Oh, they were, weren't they?" Hermione says, her wistful look a sharp contrast to the way she hacks at the squash vines. "God, do you remember how surprised we were?"
"I don't know what to tell you." Harry's green eyes are stormy with anger as he rises. "I'm trying to do what's kindest, because I've been reassured you deserve it, but maybe you don't." Harry turns to leave.
"No." That makes Pansy pause as she steps in front of the second request, and if he'd thought he'd gotten a sharp look from her before, it's nothing in comparison to now. He can practically feel her eyes slicing him open. "It's a surprise!" He tries to grin, but he can feel the corners of his mouth twitching under her gaze.
"Unless you can break Gamp's Law and conjure your own snobbish cup of tea, this is what I've got to offer you," Harry says, giving the tin another quick nudge. "Take your pick, I said."
"Because I had to attend your funeral!" Hermione bites back. "So if you feel put-upon because one of your best friends wants an explanation for letting her think you were dead—"
Malfoy, of course, comments yet again on how ugly Harry's boots are, and has a particularly dramatic reaction to Harry tucking his cargo pants into his socks to ward against ticks. "Hideous, unacceptable," Malfoy says as he casts his insect repellent charm on Harry. "Undo that at once."
By the time he gets back from the bathroom, bladder empty, trousers on, and hair and robes put into some kind of order, Harry is sitting on the side of the bed, his side of the coverlet also tossed aside to fold the whole thing into a triangle. Draco berates himself for being disappointed to see that Harry was wearing shorts the whole while.
Malfoy glares at Harry, chest heaving. "So what am I supposed to do? Repent all my life, knowing I'll never be forgiven for something I did when I was a boy?"
"It's a robe, obviously," Draco snaps. "And so's this, and in case you're having trouble, these are trousers, to cover your arse in public. Ever heard of them?"
make Mrs. Minchin believe it was her idea all along to agree with whatever you want to put her in. She doesn't know what she should wear—you do."
"No," Harry moans, voice small. He reaches for Draco's hand, and Draco mirrors him, ready to clasp Harry's hand. Instead Harry grabs at the ring, trying to yank it off, and Draco yelps. "It's a glamour charm! Or transfigured! How did you know how to make it look, Malfoy? Been spying on me while I suffer through missing decades of my life?!"
Maybe it's upstairs. He leaves the fetid hidden prison, still stalking as carefully as he can manage toward the door he thinks should lead to the rest of the house. A quick tap of his wand and a whispered
"Malfoy!" Harry fumes, before he realizes he's still holding his briefs, and drops them into the pile of his clothing, kicking his shirt over them.
"Oh, barely!" Draco whips his cloak off in a dramatic twirl, already heading for the closet to hang it up. "It feels like my organs have rearranged. That driver was a menace with the brakes." He scowls as he shuts the closet again. "Stop laughing at me, I'm in distress."
Did he want Malfoy's company? Did he just want to justify being able to spend time with someone who had done so many awful things to him, to his friends?
"I didn't need the master bath, I just needed a bloody toilet and a sink in the same room!" Draco presses a hand to his chest, his heart hammering from the shock of sudden Apparition.
Draco puts his fork down, back straightening. "Is there a grudge that's never healed?" he asks, and he knows Potter knows in turn just which grudge he means.
"And kiss another bug? You're mad," Draco says with a healthy injection of disgust, but he finds himself smiling uncontrollably.
"Right this way," the young man says, pushing floppy brown hair out of his eyes. Draco supposes, as he follows his quick-footed escort, that there'd be no requirement of professionalism in Potter's Auror office. Draco is led to a heavy-looking door, and he notices as the young man—alright, certainly a secretary—knocks three times upon its surface that Potter's name is nowhere to be found on it. A tarnished plaque simply reads HEAD AUROR and no more.
It's that particular detail that finally brings Draco rapidly up to speed with reality. His robes are twisted around his upper body, and his shirt is creased against his skin, but from the waist down all he's got on is his underwear. (Teal, printed with bananas, tight, purchased at a Muggle shop.)
just about as soon as he writes it—but there's no looking back now. He puts it aside, then sets about writing a letter to Harry.
Harry doesn't explicitly put Draco to work as his sous chef, but when Draco hears a bit of banging about in the kitchen, he leaves his work to trot downstairs and get in Harry's way until he's given a task. Pansy's diagnosis of "far gone" doesn't even begin to cover how Draco feels when he's next to Harry in the kitchen, doing something as mundane as peeling potatoes or rinsing scallops. An elated thrill runs through him when Harry puts his hand over Draco's on the knife handle, impatiently guiding him on the proper way to slice a tomato, dice an onion, or smash a clove of garlic open.
Now it's Blaise who sighs. "I just want you to be as interested in our lives as we are in yours, Draco, even when you're being uncharacteristically taciturn about it. I want to feel like we're well and truly friends again. I don't want you to be the charity case we check in on to make sure you haven't died yet."
"Harry's made it clear he won't speak to us anymore," Weasley says, and then, more urgently, "If you can communicate with him, at all—"
"And then covered yourself in sweat, and flour, and," Draco leans in, licking a spot of sauce from Harry's cheek, "all sorts of other ingredients."
He clears his throat. "What you're saying to me isn't a compliment," Draco says, after a strained moment. Potter glares down at his pasta. "You're just insulting yourself, and hiding it in platitudes about my work."
"I thought it represented you well!" Draco says, flushing as he crosses his arms. "You liked it only a moment ago!"
"I need," Draco begins, his voice as tremulous as the walls, "for you to focus on me, Potter. Focus on the—on the sound of my voice." Draco reminds himself that right now his voice is a neutral ground—he himself can't dwell on how much Potter must have hated his voice when they were children.
"I've asked you twice tonight not to tease me, but perhaps tease is too gentle a word. What do you think is a more fitting term? Mock, perhaps? Torment, that's a good one. We've been out of each other's orbits for so long that perhaps you felt you were deprived to teach me a lesson I've already long since learned about bullying."
"Get it together," she snaps. "Whatever little romantic fantasy you've got in your head, wrap it up. We've got a business to run, if you've forgotten."
She shakes her head, and gives the fourth request a flick of her thumb and forefinger. "I want you to stay focused, Draco. Our business is important. All our clients are important. Our employees being paid and able to feed and clothe and house themselves, that's important. Our reputation—of the utmost importance."
"Well, can't say as I'm surprised to see the pair of you," Ron says, with a face that struggles to stay smooth. "I'll, er, I'll put the kettle on."
Harry wraps his arms around his drawn-up legs, tapping his shins as he looks over the field, away from Draco. "But after everything, and then you going all the way to Ron and Hermione, to hear they still want me around even after all this time, it really drives it home that having no one near me doesn't rid me of the power to hurt. It'll always be there." Harry presses a hand to his collarbone. "Waiting."
"Well, given she's the cleverest witch of whatever, I wouldn't put anything past her when it comes to information gathering." Draco picks up one last thing, which he puts into Harry's hands. "Don't forget this."
Harry barks his laughter, giving Draco a little shove. "I take it back! I'm not ever kissing you again. You're a rotten git."
"I—what, so the path to redemption is just to apologize to you for everything I've done?" Malfoy joins him without so much as a sigh of relief, so caught up in his indignation.
at him. He unbuckles his belt and undoes his fly while scolding himself for being such a fucking weirdo, and steps out of his jeans and shoes while imagining what his friends would say if they could see him getting so flustered over Malfoy putting emphasis on the word
"Be careful with yourself," Harry sighs. "Of course I'm a target. I'm the bloody Head Auror. That's not a reason."
"Potter, don't you dare—!" Draco can't even find it in himself to be embarrassed by how his voice cracks. But it's too late, and the distantly familiar yank of being Side Alonged consumes him.
"I'm afraid," Harry croaks. "I'm afraid of what's out there. And the longer I stay in here, the more—the more comfortable I am with that fear." He draws in a shuddering breath, places his other hand palm-up on his thigh. Asking.
Eventually, Harry has to leave his side; the Griselda Yaxley case needs processing. Her wandless, wordless magic is so powerful that she's kept under heavy sedation, tended to hourly by guarded orderlies whose first priority is that she stay unconscious. Nobody is sure what else to do with her; a Dementor-less Azkaban is no more likely to hold her than anywhere else, and Draco doubts even Dementors would phase her. Meanwhile, Venari Virtute itself goes unbroken, barely kept from spreading by the Ministry while its current victims' magic goes on feeding Griselda's.
"Pansy?!" Malfoy says with a hearty guffaw. "She was as much my beard as I was hers. No, Potter, we were not a
"I know," he says, unable to keep the annoyance out of his voice. And because she loves him, she lets him.

Harry bids him farewell by pinning Draco to the wall, kissing him so passionately Draco considers staying the night and doing something about their mutual erections after all.
Draco wants to write down that Harry will be by on Thursday afternoon, but his planner is in his bag, and he's still so used to having to get up and physically grab things if he wants them that he doesn't think to Accio the whole lot. He'll remember, anyway. Friday. No, Thursday.
He thinks of Potter in his dream, beatific and strange. The canola flower on his bedside table, though—that had still been there, the morning after, real and wilting. "He was there," Draco affirms. He's taking in the pattern on the area rug between them now, not for the first time. Peacocks. There are no more peacocks on the manor grounds in 2013.
And in the moon's silvery light, Potter, too, looks soft and open. It makes his dark brown skin a midnight blue, glints off his golden glasses until they look like another star in the darkness, and he looks otherworldly.
"I don't know where Lily is," Rose says, glancing at her mobile. Magical children are apparently no more immune to the siren song of constant communication than Muggle kids, especially teenagers like Rose. When Draco was her age, the high concentration of magic in a place like the Burrow would have blown out a device like that, but advancements in the finally-named field of magitechnology have made it possible for the Burrow to have a television set that only the grandkids and Arthur watch.
"Fair enough." Harry takes a loud slurp of his tea that sets Draco's teeth on edge, and he pushes down the urge to tell Harry it's a cup of Earl Grey, not a trough in a paddock.
He resigns himself to his undersalted rice and dry chicken, and despite himself, lets the daydream machine rev back up. Of course he'd thought that a twenty-something-year-old Harry, with a ridiculous shoulder to waist ratio and a rounded arse that complimented delectable thighs, had been hot. There was no questioning that, especially when Draco had been twenty-something himself. But Draco doesn't recoil from Harry-over-forty—if anything he wants to sink into him, and the warmth he radiates.
Griselda's thick wand goes spinning through the air, clattering against the poured concrete floor on the other side of the room. Draco clutches his wand in one shaking but purposeful fist, having pulled it from his robes as Griselda pulled him up. Griselda watches the wand fly from her hand with wide eyes, but when she turns back to him, her face is twisted with a snarling grin that fills Draco with terror.
before I had to look at you first thing in the bloody morning." Draco throws back the covers to find he's at least still dressed in his disgusting T-shirt, with nothing to cover his arse but a pair of briefs. He apparently hasn't got any dignity left anyway, so he plants his feet on the floor and makes an attempt to stand. He falls right back onto the mattress, his legs infuriatingly shaky.
"I've already had my memory reviewed by Pensieve, sir," Dendron says, a frown flashing across his face before he bows his head as if in apology for the frown.
"You're going to make me look like the Pope," Harry sighs, but he holds out one hand regardless. "I can put these on, you know. I could have put all this on myself. You're a bit tall to be a house elf."
"Don't just come at a man below the belt with sharp objects, Malfoy!" Potter yelps, skipping back a step, but Draco is resolute, falling to his uncushioned knees and gripping the trousers with a firm hand; row or not, these trousers
"Well, it's—" She turns it back over, frowning at the croquis in its fitted little suit. "Darling, it's a bit bare, isn't it?"
. Draco brushes the doorknob with nervous fingertips, waiting for it to burn him, or curse him, but nothing happens, and he shoulders his way inside.
But Harry holds up a hand. "I did lie when I said I didn't need anything, just now, just—what I need isn't your sewing. Not now, anyway." He plucks at his robes, the organza rustling softly. "What I need is
to sift through my clients' private memories for fashion inspiration, even if I were to gain prior consent."
thank you to all my readers and commenters so far! i love all your questions and outbursts and thoughts so far; they've really made this fic all that much more fun to work on, and i hope with each update that you'll like the fic even more.
"Here, in the wilderness, being reminded of those exact stupid, brainwashed choices, yes," Malfoy agrees.
It's past noon by the time they get into the Auror offices, which means the news of the successfully applied tracking spell must have reached the DMLE before Harry could deliver it himself, because they walk in to tumultuous applause. Auror Larch claps so hard he manages to ruffle his own hair, and Williamson beams from the back of the room.
"This feels like something you'd serve to seduce someone," Draco says, tasting the broccolini next. "Not someone you loathe."
"Oh, Malfoy," Hermione chuckles. "I wouldn't ruin the memory by punching you a second time. Don't worry."
The photos had been different than any other papparazzi shot of Harry Potter. Instead of photos taken from a great distance to catch Harry unawares, or shots of Harry's aggravated face taken in close proximity, these photos had been unnervingly intimate. Harry had been laughing, drinking, hugging his friends, kissing someone on the cheek warmly.
"Can I tell you?" Potter says. "Part of the reason I couldn't shout at you properly was because of that stupid pincushion you've got. What is that even supposed to be? It looks like a bloated hamster."
at the first Burrow dinner after Harry's completed Legilimency healing, and although Harry wasn't the only one who didn't have a clue what Ron was talking about, the evening was ruined in seconds. Harry's fear and anger devolved into a crying, shouting meltdown; Draco had to practically throw his husband through the Floo and follow him home.
"You do, though. It's like—I dunno, it's hard to explain. You don't worry at me, even when you're helping me. You don't make me feel like I'm made of glass."
The inside of the shack doesn't match the outside. Inside feels like a real house, with sturdy walls and a hodgepodge of chintzy furniture. Of course there'd be magic in play; no one could survive in what looked like an abandoned fishing hut all this time. There are no stairs, so whatever dimensional charms are in place aren't terribly advanced, but they certainly serve their purpose. It looks a bit like the ground floor of the Burrow in here, Draco realizes.
"S-sure, yeah." Harry is adrift in the waters of this conversation; this Draco Malfoy, penitent and soft, somehow even self-aware, defies everything Harry's learned about him growing up together.
Draco lets himself laugh at that, and for the next few minutes he's just content to listen to Pansy and Blaise banter. And yet—
When the door to Twelve Grimmauld Place opens at Draco's knock, he takes a deep breath, trying to remember how to be boisterous. What had he done last time he'd been here? Kicked the door shut? Except by the time he's remembered that detail, he's already inside, and he hasn't even said hello.
hug two giant stacked eggs. He doesn't look any less happy to see her, though. She judges Hermione to look "Elysian," Draco to look "delightfully harlotous," and Ron—well, she clucks her tongue. "Ron, you must wear couture to a Gala." Ron only laughs.
"Chivalry lives on," Draco says dryly, sliding himself onto the bench one leg at a time. Harry puts a quick kiss to the crown of Draco's head, right above the bald spot he tries to cover with strategic combing. Then he uses Draco's shoulder as leverage to get himself onto the bench, wedging in between his husband and Lily, who's pouring herself pumpkin juice and not speaking to anyone.
kind of malodorous, and anyone who's been lying about in their own sadness should have a shower, anyway. "Is that how else you're helping me, then? Keeping on top of my personal hygiene?"
A breeze runs its spectral hand over the field, ruffling Harry's hair. It's clean, now, looking soft and inviting as it curls around Harry's beautiful face.
Harry arches his brows as he lays a healthy slab of shepherd's pie onto Draco's plate. Draco expects him to wax nostalgic about their rivalry, but there's no misty-eyed recollection happening behind those serious green eyes. Draco swallows, reading everything he needs to in that one look. The train. Draco's every awful word to Harry and both his best friends. The train, again, but different. The cabinet.
." He stalks up to Harry, who's standing now, the hand that was holding the ring now a fist clenched to his chest. "Didn't you see any of that? With Ron, or Hermione? Didn't you see, Harry, how hard I worked to get you back?"
"Why doesn't Hermione come tell me that herself, then? Since it sounds like she's in my house and all." Draco slaps one of his thighs for having the audacity to not let him escape this room. "Go and get her, and then don't come back, how about that?"
"So you two haven't—?" Blaise makes an obscene gesture with both hands, and Draco slaps them down immediately.
"I do request that I be compensated for the labor I have completed thus far, even though it's not to your liking, and will owl an invoice I believe to be fair in price." He never did ask Potter for tea. There's tea at the atelier. He'll get cream on his way back and then he and Pansy both can have cream for their tea.
Suddenly this game is no fun, and Harry is reminded it never should have been. He doesn't want to think about the war. He doesn't want to think about death. He just wanted—
"Never off the robe, but yes," Draco says, leaning back in his seat to steeple his fingers over his lap. "So you like it?"
"Potter." Draco reaches for Potter's wrists. He doesn't dare try to touch Potter's wand yet. Potter flinches when Draco's fingers graze his skin, and he looks up again, his eyes burning into Draco's.
"You don't drink a lot when you're not on holiday, do you?" Malfoy says with a smirk. "My god, Potter, I don't even know how to begin with this—this
"To get to the second floor?" Draco all but squawks, his satchel dropping from suddenly weak fingers. "Are you mad?"
be better." Malfoy disentangles his fingers to scrub one hand through his lank hair. "I'm just—tired."
"I know I need to use my planner," Draco admits, quiet and musing, "but I just cannot be bothered to pick it up half the time, and it seems so tedious."
"I don't know." Draco hadn't noticed the way Potter was comfortably spread out until now, when Potter draws back into himself, tucking all his limbs into each other until he's hugging his knees with his chin between them. "I'm tired of myself. I'm tired of feeling so much."
"Oh, yes they did, and it was sickening! Bad enough, everyone simpering about how famous you were, how powerful you must be, then you had the nerve to hit
"To the end of the Rabid Dog Curse!" Larch shouts, and this time the response is deafening, the charmed windows of the office practically rattling in their frames.
Harry feels sorrier than he has in a long time by the time he and Malfoy reach the bottom of the boot, which they should have never done. The world is spinning with every step, and Malfoy is no help, finally intoxicated enough that any difference in sobriety between him and Harry is negligible.
Potter looks up, his eyes flicking from side to side as though searching the stars for his answer. Draco nearly chuckles at the thought—he'd always heard Potter was rubbish at Divination.
"I can't wait to be horrified by your bedroom," Draco says, and just as he realizes he's said he can't wait to be in Harry's bedroom, a pile of paper that had been neatly cataloging itself by level of importance explodes into a crinkling flurry, like a bird being hit by a Bludger. "Oh, damn it all!"
Potter doesn't say anything in return, but the silence that surrounds them feels companionable rather than cold.
He should go. He should leave. He should thunder down these stairs so Potter knows he might be heard, so he knows Draco isn't listening. More importantly, he should do it so he doesn't stand a chance of actually overhearing anything.
"I don't see how jealousy figures into it," Draco says, letting his hands fall to the bench, "when it has nothing to do with me."
It's a cloudy Tuesday afternoon in early summer, not any day of particular note. Draco is reading a Muggle gardening magazine with a cup of black tea, thinking idly about making mushroom polenta for supper later. And now, there's also a tear in the fabric of Draco's living room, a jagged window looking out over a blustery, rocky landscape with sparse grass and an ocean view.
"Yes." Potter is curt, his shoulders a taut line curving up at their ends. "Just a review, as I said."
tell Harry how annoying it's been to have to tidy the house all by himself so he'd better not leave again. He won't have tea ready, but together they'll have a meal done up in no time. After all, Draco's left the kitchen just the way Harry likes it, with little caches of spices in tactical spots around the stove, his favorite pan ready on his favorite burner.
, forced into taking another step back, but he's grinning before his face vanishes into her mass of hair, hugging her right back. Then Granger holds Harry at arm's length so she can angle her face back and shout, "Ron! Everyone! Harry's here!"
"Well, I didn't just come with food, you know," Molly says, already dabbing at Draco's eyes with a handkerchief pulled from nowhere. He screws his eyes shut and lets her. "I've got a bit of good news, sweetheart."
"Hmph." Draco tucks the signed form and his measuring tape back into his satchel, clicking it shut with more force than necessary before he begins striding out of the room. "Owl me when you're feeling more awake, then."
"So forward," Draco mumbles, his filter absolutely eroded by exhaustion. If Potter has a reaction, Draco doesn't see it past the curtain of silk as he pulls the dark green robe from his bag. He almost doesn't hear Potter's gasp.
"I really am going to destroy that camera when you least expect it," Harry tells him, straightening up with his hands on his hips. Malfoy takes another picture. "Hey!"
"Don't you both work in the Ministry?" Draco says, failing to keep desperation out of his voice. They glance at each other.
"Well," Hermione says, setting her mouth in a flat line, "what if we figure all that out somewhere that
"What's one more day away from the office, really?" Draco murmurs, laying his hands along Harry's muscular thighs.
Draco picks up his satchel, running his fingers over its closures to check it. He doesn't remember where he put down the sketch of what he'd thought was Potter's magnificent Gala look, but he doesn't want to find it. He
"I'm shocked, Potter! Not Parvati Patil? Well, Romilda Vane might still carry a torch for you, though goodness knows she's single for a reason."
"I'd ask you to promise not to get angry, but I don't think I can," Draco says, with a dry chuckle. "This is for Harry Potter, Pansy."
"I'm not a baby, I don't need—" Harry takes a deeper, slower breath, pinching his nose and bumping his glasses out of place. "Sorry. Maybe."
So he chooses to enjoy himself. He chooses to even enjoy Harry's wet salad, because Harry made it for him, and that is enough. Draco gives himself over to stupid chatter, which turns to school nostalgia anyway once Harry asks if he meant it about Longbottom and Blaise. Draco lets the cheap wine make him feel pliant and buzzy, because he thinks about Harry going out of his way to choose a wine that Draco might like and he melts with how horribly in love he is. Oh, he's so far gone.
He realizes, once the manor has emptied, that Pansy and Blaise have left without saying goodbye, and Draco wants to sink into the flagstones outside and become one with the dirt beneath them.
Draco pauses, gripping his wand tighter. It's been a long time since anyone's had anything to say to him about his Death Eater childhood, much less tried to lure him into some kind of a trap. "Come now," he says, as gamely as he can manage, "be sporting about it if you're going to attack me. Let me put a face to the mastermind."
"Stop clucking at me." Draco takes only a short sip before setting the glass aside. He reaches for his bag, and hesitates. "If you hate it, I ask that you simply not tell me."
"Alright, Malfoy, what's your game?" Harry demands as he storms up to Malfoy on the other end of the bar.
Draco knocks on the intricately carved door—absolutely garish, in his opinion, like most old Pureblood decor—and runs his wand over his clothes as he waits, ridding himself of stray lint.
"But yes, I think I do want a child someday." Malfoy brings one hand up to rest his chin on it. "Without all the ugliness of the pressure of continuing the family line. No Pureblood shit."
Draco stands, so abruptly he almost surprises himself. "What I need to do," he says as he tugs the sitting rumples out of his clothes, "is tend to my garden. You may join me quietly or find the door."
"What, my hoodie?" Potter asks, his hands flying to the knotted pulls of the hood. "No—no, of course not."
Draco also doesn't doubt Harry would be a massive target. He sweeps dark hair from Harry's forehead to kiss him there, right on the lightning bolt scar, and gets up to pull his clothes on.
"I should have known!" Harry whirls on him, and Draco staggers back as an enraged Harry looms over him. "I should have
The result is instantaneous, which is good because Harry was honestly ready to keep shouting as long as he had to, regardless of the feelings of other vacationers. Malfoy bursts from a cottage three doors down, looking scandalized and rumpled in an unbuttoned shirt and damp hair. He stalks toward Harry, who strides ahead to meet him with an entirely unbothered energy by contrast.
Their day outside doesn't last too long; Malfoy's stamina is low, and he hadn't eaten a proper breakfast, either. They do make it out to the grasslands, though, and Malfoy snaps several more pictures that just seem to be of Harry looking awkward in the outdoors. "That one was just of my bum," Harry protests, at least once, but Malfoy just laughs devilishly and prances out of reach.
"Well," Harry says with a shrug, "I've been hiking without issue for weeks and you've got a sprained ankle the one time I see you on a mountainside, so who made the right decision here?"
The visit goes on so long that Harry joins Ron in the kitchen to fix dinner, leaving Draco alone with Hermione. It's strange, he thinks, to be so comfortable with the woman he once tormented. Stranger still for her to laugh at his jokes, invite him to her table, let him meet her children. Out of love for Harry, first and foremost he has no doubt, but Hermione has never struck him as the kind of person who sets aside her principles for someone as technically trivial as her childhood friend's boyfriend.
"Not even after Hogwarts?" Draco asks, skipping neatly over mention of the war that replaced Potter's seventh year of schooling. Draco's as well, if he thinks about it long enough—the curriculum was a propagandist joke, meant to enfeeble its students. "Once you were an adult?" Potter's documented fashion choices as an adult prior to his disappearance had remained uninspired, if better fitting than the Muggle dreck of his youth. Honestly, not much different than what Draco's seen him in these past few weeks, when he wasn't wearing robes so plain they looked like Madam Malkin's school uniform stock.
Harry fidgets with his mug. "Well, you invited me over for, er, what'd you call it? Wine and horse divorce?"
"Is he a total nutter now?" Pansy wants to know, swinging her legs arrhythmically off the edge of Draco's desk where she's taken a seat. "Does he have a long, mangy beard? Hair going in all directions?" Her eyebrows bounce. "Did he have a haunted look?"
Alright, there's no way Draco's leaving now, not when there's the possibility there's been a third person in the house all along. Kreacher the house elf died before Potter even went into hiding, decrepit as he was.
Draco knows the emphasis on his name comes from her trying to hammer home that they'll all be on a first name basis going forward, but he can't help getting a chill as he does as he's told and finds a seat by Harry, wedged in the corner of the kitchen.
