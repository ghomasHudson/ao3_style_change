“no Julian, when you’re strong enough we’ll get the soul fragment removed and placed into a protective orb so this man can be treated properly, ok?” Julian smiled at his Daddy “brilliant, lets have lunch. Come join us Severus. With our schools starting up again soon we need to consider some things. Especially if you want to be here for the binding removal”
“Ummm … there weren’t any complications, but I couldn’t heal everything completely. I was monitoring them for a few hours and while they seem stable I was hoping you could look at them to be sure.” Cache said hopefully.
Severus scowled at the display “thank you for bringing him here Percy. Feel free to leave him there on the floor”
“bloody hell … this is strange” he gasped. With shear determination he inched his way downstairs and sat at the book covered table “the book said I’d feel a little sore, but only after three doses” he bit out through pained pants. His body burned all over and he felt weak. The only thing he thought would help would be a nutrition potion so he took the second and third doses early with a pain reliever and relaxed with a transfiguring book for a while to give his body time to recover.
“you bastard-” Sirius screamed as he ran forward and was going to lounge at the wizard with all the strength his weak frail body could muster, but he was grabbed by his shirt collar by someone behind him “LET ME GO! THAT DEATH EATER IS HURTING MY GODSON” Sirius was so blinded by anger and completely unstable that he barely noticed the two witches move out of their hiding spots to stand with Severus. He just kept falling against the man holding him back who was actually Brian.
“yes, quite alright Harry. To clarify you locked Cache’s vault with magic so the wards around the bank inform me when you arrive. It’s different from when you lock something by blood” the goblin explained as sat across from the young wizard “now for obvious reasons I provided no details about the scan results in the letter so we will begin here … have you felt differently since leaving Privet Drive? Be specific”
Harry blushed at the kind tone and slowly reach back under the bed and pulled out the stuffed wolf. While clinging to the wolf as if someone may take it away he stood next to Brian although it was just out of the headmaster’s reach …
“so I can come and go as I please?” when the goblin nodded in affirmative Julian looked at his Dad looking for permission.
“why should I? Thinking of muggle related questions was your idea in the first place” Draco huffed, but raised an eyebrow when he noticed Crabbe and Goyle were gone “good they left”
The Minister sighed, "Ms. Prewett, you are here by arrested for child abuse, conspiring to commit line theft and potioning a ministry agent-" Of course, Molly decided to struggle. She managed to get a nasty curse cast on Arthur before she was restrained by the aurors. After making sure Arthur was cared for, which was easy considering he was already in St, Mungo's, Cornelius turned back to a restrained Molly. "And I'll be adding assault to your list, which, thankfully, gives me jurisdiction instead of Gringotts. I need to charge someone today." He muttered jokingly.
After putting the counter potion on he looked like himself again … just much taller and with awesome eyesight, which brings us to Harry’s plot. Not to mention that he finally saw his green eyes in their real color … as in not gray
“if it makes that big of a difference I can get Sanguini instead ” Cache said cheekily, but quickly raised his hands in a defensive gesture when Severus pointed his wand at him … though the fake blonde couldn’t wipe the amused smile off his face “kidding, kidding! Obviously I got word from Gringotts”
“DON’T FUCK WITH ME SNIVELUS! IT’S HARRY POTTER AD YOU KNOW IT!” Sirius yelled trying to violently fight Brian off for a few more seconds before tiring himself out.
Presents were given one at a time and Harry loved each one. He got several books, rare potion ingredients and several other things. Trocar gave Harry his own daggers with a snake carved into the hilt. No one had a problem with the wizard being able to speak to snakes. Apparently it was more popular than people thought … of course after Voldemort who would admit that they have that talent? Greyback knew two paresltongue speakers who were foreigners so it was out there.
While keeping his movements slow he went to put his cloak away and sat down to continue reading. A clattering made him glance at the kneazles who were eating the chicken “don’t eat too fast. Trust me, you’ll get sick”
“yes, so we have some time to find them, but despite what they did Harry hasn’t given much information on where they live. He only talked about the inside of the house” said Trocar.
Neville came out of the bathroom and started packing too “you ok Harry?” he asked softly so the many other Gryffindors didn’t hear,
Hermione felt all eyes on her and gulped nervously, ''He paid me to, as he put it, 'keep Harry on the right path' along with Ron. We were to talk him into things and out of other things as well as keep an eye on him. My family couldn't afford my school on their own so I thought this was the best way. I was never told about Gringotts' payment plans."
"I figured that might come up so I got in contact with St. Mungo's earlier today. Unfortunately, visiting rights aren't allowed until the investigation is closed. If anything changes they will inform me." Minerva explained.
“sorry! You’re sorry Trocar! Are you saying you would’ve kept your revelation from us?! We all have a life debt with the boy and you would hide him from all of us?!” growled the child like vampire. Harry was about say something in his mentor’s defense before he was hurt, but Armel patted his shoulder comfortingly as he and many others came into the apartment.
Maria took on a look of deep thought “those various mind control charms Harry mentioned were very weak, but that has to be the case because you can shatter a child’s mind if powerful charms and potions are used. Dumbles might have strengthened the charms later on, but that begs to question how powerful these charms on Snape are. If this man is as smart and skilled as you say then he must be under something powerful and has been under a long time to not be able to make any obvious connections even now”
“we grew up with monsters Severus. Don’t think you can destroy Julian’s monsters without letting us look them in the eyes before they realize karma has come for them like our monsters?” Sophia asked. More than anything else she wanted to see the people who hurt Julian years ago.
“sounds like the evidence against Dumbledore is mounting” a goblin commented as he came to collect some mail from an owl.
A smile came to Brian’s lips as he wiped his hands with a napkin “I can’t understand parseltongue, but the bond between familiar and its witch or wizard is so strong that you can understand them no matter the species” he explained and was happy to see the curious look cross his son’s face.
"Ok … should we wait until you move Isaac off your blood before starting?" Draco asked Severus as Harry checked tubes, which started with the flask of bubbling solution of ground toasted kneazle whiskers.
century mindset and connected with the rest of the world then you’ll see a lot more happy tourists. Glad to meet you Tom” the headmaster waved over is shoulder at the stunned pub owner and continued walking down the road to look for a muggle hotel or a spot to sleep.
“Aster is to be his godmother” the healer’s eyes widened in happiness at the surprise and she tearfully signed the spot for the godmother and provided a drop of blood. Brian then thought a moment about who Julian’s godfather should be. He knew many people who could be trusted with the boy’s care should something happen, but there was something about Severus Snape that made him wonder. Brian was always one to trust his instincts and he felt that the potion master would ferociously protect Julian no matter what “and his godfather is, if he has no problem with it, Severus Snape”
“it says …’cute little hatchling’ … ‘slither with me’ … ‘keep your scales shiny’ and ‘my eyes are deadly’ … was I hissing Daddy?” Harry asked, he looked scared. This was something his aunt would freak out about.
As he stabbed the helpless pieces of fruit and devoured them he casually read the charms book to get ready for his tests. Hedwig quickly finished her meal too and fluttered back ready to get rid of this unwanted addition. With all his food eaten Harry cleaned up and went to the living room. He took a little knick knack of a frog fishing off the mantel and sat on the couch.
“part of my experimental potion. I’m studying the effects of pure kneazle whiskers and quartz would boost the effects. Trocar doesn’t want me to start experimenting until I get my healing abilities improved so I haven’t started yet” Cache smiled, but a spark of panic zipped through him as the professor started looking at the potions on the counter … he forgot to put away his disguise potion. Frank noticed even before Trocar and in a casual way started sifting through the very potions Severus was looking at pretending to look for a pain reliever for another werewolf. With some simple slide of hand he hid the potions and successfully irritated the potion master.
“maybe you should” Blaise smirked and nudged Draco teasingly earning a glare, which he ignored as Ginny sat down near them “you knew” he said both amused and accusingly.
The child sleeping in the headmaster’s tree house home slowly began to stir. Vivid green eyes fluttered open and the boy immediately curled up in panic expecting someone to hit him. if he wasn’t tossed into the dark cupboard then that means his uncle wasn’t done yet, but Harry slowly peeked through his fingers after a few seconds of silence …
“But they’re so cute!” Trocar squealed dodging the werewolf getting an eye roll from Harry. This will take a while …
A spark of shame hit Severus and he nodded “I understand why you didn’t bring it up before, but I’m not mad Cache. Just startled and don’t think otherwise. So where is this chamber?” he said, making damn sure to stick to Cache despite the security, as he picked up his potion off the floor. He checked the contents to make sure everything so he was prepared. After all a GHOST went missing that doesn’t happen in good circumstances and he refused to let Harry go without him. Everything was there, but just in case something happened he took out the antidotes for the love potion and put it on his desk for safety. Severus actually only had enough ingredients to brew half of what they needed so Harry had to brew he rest at home, which is why there was a slight difference in the vials used.
“I thought Uncle Severus said I wouldn’t get one” the young confused boy panted as his Dad looked at the letter. Brian’s eyes widened when he saw the letter was addressed to ‘Harry James Potter’ …
… ‘Making your own lab starts out with the obvious fumes from potions that are emitted from every potion. Many potions have toxic fumes. A list of which is on page 43. The fumes can have many strange effects on the mind and can cause breathing problems. Ventilation charms are the best way to combat the fumes in a lab that is in doors.’ …
Poppy paled “dear Merlin! What the bloody hell is going through his head?!” she snapped as she grabbed a bag full things she may need and followed after her panicking apprentice to the floo in the lobby two floors down “how did this happen?”
“do you think he escaped?” Cache asked quietly as he set up the potions in the infirmary to prepare for the girls who will be coming to unknowingly remove a love portion. He saw the look on Dumbledore’s face. There was no doubt in his mind that the bastard bolted, but how far could he get? It worried him to think abut what back up plans Dumbledore had …
The goblin used its magic to remove the spell that blocked Arthur’s memories. What was revealed to him made him feel ill and very happy that Ginny will be staying with her brother. Those memories, after all, showed his wife talking to Dumbledore and, from the way it sounded, selling their daughter as a bride to Harry Potter! Just like in the memory, he felt his temper rise at the prospect of his daughter not being allowed to find her own love in life. He recalled confronting them and Molly, the woman he loved, cast the curse to force him to forget.
Suddenly the wizard froze in mid step as a terrible chill washed over him. It had nothing to do with the warm breeze … no … this was something else entirely. There was something … someone, pulling him. A weak tendril of magic tugged at his own magic … crying for help.
“thank you … you shouldn’t have felt the need to do that” Severus said as he took the bottomless bag.
“that’s all well and good, but I intend to kidnap them if necessary … I’ll show Lucius exactly where my loyalties lie and it is most definitely not with Dumbledore. Now I won’t tell them about Tom until we have all the pieces of his soul, but when I’m sure they’re trustworthy maybe they can be told about Harry Potter. Of course that will only happen if you want it to Julian, ok?” Severus promised and when his godson nodded with that soft smile he went to the floo. This time he wasn’t going to change out of his loose fitting button down shirt and black slacks so the Malfoys will be in for a shock right away.
“I don’t know about that. Keep in mind you still have to deal with Ron” Harry snickered as Severus cringed “wonder if he’ll keep melting cauldrons … I wonder if he was the one who always spiked my cauldron” he pondered and a frown came to his lips “I hope he doesn’t do anything stupid cause Nev is not going to be watching him like he did for me. In fact he seems to be pretty pissed with both Ron and Granger. I wouldn’t cross him”
Both Greg and Vincent pouted, "How were we supposed to know when you guys never let us listen to your conversations?" They both said genuinely hurt by being left out.
One after one people gave it a shot. It turns out the leeches were really pickled Deadly Snare. The spider webs were fibers from deep in the Whomping Willow. The black beetle powder was really dark seashell powder. The lionfish spikes were actually the pointy hairs from an acromantula’s back. The dragon blood was aged sap from the mistletoe plant and finally the mandrake was really shriveled bat wings. Though she got them all wrong at least Hermione is learning something, but she didn’t seem to see it that way and seemed to be sulking …
“you’ll have your masters sooner than you think” Sophia said with a smile as she, Silvia and Severus settled near a bubbling cauldron that basked in the moonlight that poured through the skylights of the twins home. This was a routine for the three potion lovers. They each preferred just sitting back and chatting over a meal or a cauldron. As a first date they tried going to a restaurant, but it was too stuffy so they agreed to just relax at a casual dinner. Severus decided to cook since it was his foolish idea to try a restaurant.
“perfectly, they gave him away without a fight and I just barely avoided hexing them into the next century … he’s my son now and the adoption potion will be ready soon. Gringotts is making the request” said Brian as he sat in the chair to Harry’s bed and gently touched the boy’s hair as he whimpered in his sleep. Harry relaxed into the touch “what color are your eyes little one? I think green”
Despite what Professor Snape thought he really did pay attention in class and actually loved it … or he would if the strangest things didn’t keep happening. Yes, fror a big reason he had a hard time at first, but then he found ways around his … handicap. Every potion would start perfectly, but the second his back is turned away everything goes haywire. It wasn’t until a month ago that he realized someone, he suspected a Slytherin, was tossing random ingredients into his potions during class. Sure it was ruining his grade, but it could kill someone too.
Cache nodded “ok, I’ll work something out with Poppy. She says Sundays can be busy so maybe I can switch out. What should we work on while this is brewing?”
“you heard me Severus, despite his height Cache is only 11 and he made a perfect Skele-gro in front of me. What’s most amazing is that he can hear the phases change. I start teaching him Tuesday at 8:00 and I plan to let each lesson end about 1:00, do you want to meet him? He is a very hard worker and could use a mentor in potions I’m sure” said Poppy’s face in the fire embers.
“my my that was quite entertaining” Dumbledore twitched in annoyance as he turned around to see an aristocratic man with long blonde hair smirking at him with Draco at his side also smirking.
It made him happy that they had gained weight. Now they didn’t look so bad and their fluffy fur hid most of the signs, but they will be big. Both kneazles were close to his knees when standing, which made them far bigger than regular cats and actually their still growing. The both of them were small tigers under the fluffy fur and as they get up to their appropriate weight they will be something to watch out for.
Those voices … Harry felt his insides freeze as he turned around and saw Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy. Behind the blonde Slytherin were two people who were most likely Draco’s parents … Draco’s dangerously calm parents. Despite the tension he couldn’t help but notice that Draco’s eyes were truly gray. Ever since he realized he was colorblind he was curious.
“oh dear, she going to traumatize them” Lucius groaned, but seemed to be a bit pleased with the situation “these books you mentioned need permission in order to be written so I will take care of starting a lawsuit if you both want” Lucius offered.
“cool … it’s timed for the sunset” Cache smiled as he opened the balcony door to feel the warm breeze as he looked up at the starry sky. He looked down at the cobblestone streets below and saw the store windows flick on “awesome, I’ve been wanting to check out those stores”
“Severus!” the potion master finally opened his eyes and looked at Trocar who was cradling Harry in his arms “get your bag out already! He needs help!”
Harry took a second to consider what to say as he took a few bites of his sandwich. He finally swallowed and sighed “both my parents were magical, but they died and my muggle relatives didn’t help me much in telling anything about magic. In fact I had no clue that magic even existed until my invite to school came … you know when I learned I was magical I saw that potions textbook and was so excited. I loved cooking and chemistry so potions was right up my alley. I ran to my first potions class and was ten minutes early, but as I raced into the room my clumsy self stepped in a cauldron and went flying across the room. I cleaned up so my professor never knew, but even still it was never a good student teacher relationship between us. He accused me of cheating many times, ignored the people spiking my cauldron and kicked me out of class once … I started crying in the hallway” Cache said calmly. It felt like it was so long ago.
The apprentice however was unaffected “of course you didn’t” he said through a chuckle which earned him a glare.
“holy shit” one of the older students in the compartment that Draco and Julian were in before jumping out of the window of the moving train exclaimed as he watched the occamy flew off with it’s passengers “who the fuck were those guys?”
“keep your nose on your work and comments to yourself Mary. Yes I won’t be here, but that doesn’t mean I’m not your superior” Poppy glared startling the witch and walked to the lab with Cache “that woman has been jealous since day one. Being good at her job won’t save her if that attitude stays so she needs to knock it off … have you decided on a name Cache?” Poppy asked as Cache began the paperwork the medi-witch in the lab gave him.
“what’s your favorite color?” both the twins asked together after taking turns talking. Brian suddenly felt nervous. He knew the twins weren’t going to let him off the hook dealing with another potion master … even if it wasn’t really his fault since it’s the bank’s protocol. Hell he never even met the person brewing the adoption potion. Either way he will get pranked and if he ever meets this potion master involved with the adoption potion he or she will be grilled on their expertise … this won’t end well …
"You don't get a say in the matter, Ms. Granger. It during the school year and you're underage, which means your representative has an obligation to keep an eye on you. I suggest you don't make this difficult considering the subject you will bring up. Depending on how you want to get through this having a representative at your side can only help. Now inside." Gritmace ordered as he opened a to a private room.
“What kind of side effects should I look out for?” The werewolf asked as he moved over to the dining table in spite of his aching joints wanting him to stop moving entirely.
“why is he following you like a stray mutt anyway?” Severus snarled at the werewolf. Harry didn’t bother answering. What would he say? ‘the werewolf is keeping an eye on you because you were my bastard professor … oh you know you’ve been insulting yourself this entire time right?’ …
In an instant it became clear what Severus destroyed before. Wherever he lived before no longer existed …
The young wizard reached up intending to grab the jar of beetle eyes, possibly to check for freshness, but he didn’t get to the jar. Just before he could grab hold of his target his baggy sleeve got snagged on a sharp edge on the shelf pulling his sleeve all the way down revealing his arm … his heavily scarred arm.
Complete silence hovered in the prison cell as Vernon got his food and lumbered back up the stairs. The tense rigidity of Harry’s muscles didn’t ease up for a second. Not until he heard the sound of the bedroom door shutting did he finally slump onto the floor in exhaustion.
Next challenge … magic without hands. Why not, if you can do magic without a wand why not without hands as well? Worth a shot …
” Snape growled at the mention of Harry’s father stunning the boy speechless. When Harry didn’t say anything further … he was too shocked to … the professor left with his robes billowing dramatically behind him.
Brian raised an eyebrow and decided to interject since his son was not sure how to begin this explanation. That and she did unintentionally insult Julian and he couldn‘t let that slide “Legerdemain uses muggle grading systems to make it easier for the magical people to transition should they need to take a job in muggle world. The letter grade A is the muggle equivalent to UK’s O grade. Both Draco and Julian are my top students. The fact you don’t how all 200 some schools outside the UK grade or even that it has been proven that starting school at five or six is healthy means you don’t know very much abut other schools so is it fair to compare?”
Cache sighed “there is a downside to being home schooled. I have my mentor in healing giving me things to practice, my potions mentor keeps me constantly busy and my mentor in everything else teaches me between those lessons. Of course it doesn’t help that I learned about being a wizard two weeks before being shipped off to a school run by idiots … doesn’t really much time to explore, but it made the decision to switch to homeschooling easy”
Isaac nodded, but then frowned, "What I don't understand is what happened at the end of the day. It seemed like a lot of people were … mad at you?"
Instead of black hair he saw natural looking golden locks … that strangely enough didn’t seem as unruly as it was, but soft and wavy. With this development fueling his excitement he put his glasses aside and picked up the bottle filled with blue. He took a Q-tip and drenched one end. The vial was opened and Harry dipped the wet end in the potion. A single drop fell in each eye … Harry tossed the Q-tip away, put the cork back in the vial and put his glasses back on eagerly waiting for the results. Gray eyes in the mirror should turn blue, but …
As Remus ran off to catch up to the grumpy Auror he kept waiting there was a gentle calming pulse of magic from the statue. Sally Crippens used all the ashes from Harry’s burnt cupboard trunk, which means there’s the ashes of a snapped phoenix feather wand mixed into the statue. It truly was magical …
The icy feeling of panic swept through the boy. Harry looked around at his sleeping roommates before quietly sneaking off to the bathroom. With a few splashes of cold water on his face he calmed down a little and sat down on a closed toilet.
Severus chuckled as he dried his hands with a towel and went over to pick up the sleepy little boy “lets get you to bed then” he said while carrying Julian away with the plush wolf running after them.
The squib opened her mouth to scream, but Armel clapped his hand over her mouth and disappeared with her …
“very funny” Severus scoffed and looked around the place. The old building was massive. Four stories of solid stone, but it looked more modern than Hogwarts. They were in the courtyard, which was encompassed by the building on three sides. There was a large glass dome on top of the building that was a greenhouse and observatory. In the courtyard was the fountain and as you walk to the building you first go under some arches that has a large wall of floos. If you flooed here you’d be greeted by the beautiful courtyard. This was Legerdemain Academy of Sorcery “I’ll go get the Malfoys, don’t let Mickey fall in the water Julian” he warned before heading for the floos.
“ah, good timing then!” Trocar smiled as he shut the door behind him. He carefully took in the scent of old cauldron that Cache was going to wash before putting it away in the brown bottomless bag. The vampire was sure the older scent ingrained in the metal was that of the potions professor who unknowingly condemned Cache. If he can find that person he may be able to discover who his apprentice really was.
Severus snorted “that’s a tricky question to answer. In the UK I became a master at 17, but the standards are vastly different outside the UK so I would not meet the requirement. I’ve gone back to studying in order to get my masters here” he said earning a great deal of respect from the witches who have met too many arrogant fools who wouldn’t go back to studying because of foolish pride “I’m starting my required thesis so hopefully I can complete my master by next year”
“I think that’s very true … that old goat was wrong” Cache muttered as he slowly pulled away from the vampire to start dinner.
Lucius blinked and notice he was too close to the block castle that surrounded his son, which must’ve been the pretend moat “I’m sorry Draco” he said with a smile and took a step back as his wife giggled.
After muttering the unlocking spell a few more times the door swung open. Harry bolted down the stairs as fast and as quietly as he could. All he could hear was his blood pounding in his ears as he frantically unlocked the cupboard. The door to his former bedroom opened and he grabbed his trunk. With shaking hands he pulled out the bottomless bag, clicked the padlock in place effectively locking the trunk back in the cupboard and raced back upstairs.
Sophia paused to refill her tea with hot water “how long have you taught by the way? Are you going to change what you’ve been teaching to reflect this new knowledge?”
“no … I was going to Sev-Professor Snape’s quarters” Draco said before quickly running out the door and trying to out run the other Slytherin, but Blaise was taller and was able to catch up pretty easily.
Percy stepped up “I’m head boy so I have separate living quarters. I will take him there and confine him to that room. Since Ginny is in Slytherin I’ll get Professor Snape as well as Professor McGonagall”
“you’re not going anywhere if you’re sick. What could possibly be that important?” Trocar asked more concerned about the boy’s health … he really did look sick …
Trocar chuckled as he set the staff next to the main sequence and began writing runes “the young Weasley girl was sorted into Slytherin and her older brother, Ron, hurt her for it. On top of that Dumbledore claimed Harry Potter wasn’t at school because he was ill”
A twinge of guilt hit him as he got the potion going “maybe Snape was right … I an a delinquent” he chuckled as Hedwig hooted in an admonishing way “you’re right girl. I had my reasons … but I’ll find a way to replace his ingredients. It’s the least I can do” he got some food, organized all the books and ate in between potion steps taking care not to hurt himself further.
A light blush appeared on Sophia’s cheeks “he is diligent in potions too” both women fell silent as Severus was heard coming back down the stairs and returned to the table “is Julian usually tired around this time? I never saw him so tired when we were here”
Now there wasn’t a damn thing he can do to stop this. Soon people will be begging for reports on Potter’s health. Then St. Mungo’s will want to check on Harry who isn’t even here! Everything will quickly snowball out of control once people start wondering why they aren’t learning anything about their savior’s health. When that suspicion sets in he’s possibly done for.
“sweety I’m a vampire. We rarely sleep so the bed is usually free” Trocar shrugged and stepped on Frank’s foot before he could make a perverted joke involving other uses for a bed.
“yes, I decided to stay in one of the rooms at the same complex as you and Trocar. It seems like the safe house I need. I heard good things about the cell rooms” Frank exclaimed and he took a swig of his drink, which to Harry’s amusement was pumpkin juice.
Neville looked into the blue eyes that he knew were actually green and smiled in pure relief “you are safe … what’s going on?”
“yeah … I should be locked in that cell now and would be if I didn’t find a knack for wandless magic … it’s been over a week I think I’d be pretty weak, but that isn’t the worst … no, not by a long shot … the ministry never came to investigate so I couldn’t go there for help, the squib I mentioned was talking about reporting to a wizard and keeping tabs on me as well as abusing two kneazles” Trocar glanced at the two kneazles sliding across the floor on their dog beds “once they left I escaped. I desperately devoured book after book to learn everything I could, to find a way to escape and take care of myself. I found away around the many problems … those four vials on the table, the gold, blue, red and white are what made it possible for me to leave without being recognized”
(Crookshanks? … but Ms. Figg is not around so how did she get Crookshanks?) Harry thought in shock even though he didn’t show anything on his face. That was the cat Ms. Figg trained to claw certain people on command … it was usually him. He was positive the cat was deranged and being it was Ms. Figg’s meant that there was no kneazle in him. Actually that made him wonder why no one recognized Lyra and Libra who were part of the squib’s advertising. Of course she probably only put them on display a few times then gave up and took pictures of them so she could claim that they died or something before locking them up, but still someone should be able to recognize them …
“yes that’s acceptable” Lucius said, but he tried to not sound so arrogant. The boy was helping even after seeing that disgusting mark on his arm so he deserved some respect. He was also grateful the young man didn’t comment on the twitching in his fingers.
Yeah, something was off. With slow and careful movements he slid off the bed and nearly fell over. The reflexes of a seeker were the only reason he managed to catch the bed before falling to the floor.
“you can’t do that! … can you?” Ron blinked a little stunned. His mother was the one in charge of everything so she wouldn’t allow this, but his father was clueless so he might. There’s no way he could talk to Hermione about finding a way to get back in the deal with the headmaster with a ghost hanging over his shoulder. Actually why wasn’t his mother here? Did his father really not tell her? It seemed unlikely since his father was a pathetic whipped dog. He has always bent over backwards to please their mother even working long hours at work to make more money though he insisted money wasn’t more important than family, but if so he had to tell her before this gets any worse so she could fix this mess. Once she knows his father won’t stand a chance …
“there’s Libra … that’s Lyra and now she won’t let you go ” Cache chuckled as Severus found just the right spot that got the kneazle purring to the point where she placed her paw on his wrist so he couldn’t leave and to complicate matters Libra was laying her head in the man’s lap waiting for a pet. Both of Severus’s hands were busy
“watch it Malfoy. You can’t always have your cronies with you” Ron snarled threateningly though he quickly backed away as Libra stood up and growled protectively.
“not Merlin, his name is Tanzanite and he’s my familiar” Julian pouted at the Malfoys odd reaction ‘
“that would work. It’s not like I can wear jewelry without raising eyebrows and just shrinking means my stuff can be stolen or reported to Dumbledore and I can’t have him wondering where got secure things when I was supposed to be locked up. Ok, once I gain weight I’ll do that … speaking of, lunch time” Harry whipped up a couple toasted sandwiches and had some tea. The two kneazles got a good amount of tasty meat to chow down on.
Harry sighed as he put his shirt on and headed into the kitchen area “yes Neville he’s a vampire and he has become something of an adopted mother to me” he caught the look of astonishment on his friend’s face and ignored the vampire’s pout as he grabbed a pot from the hanging rack “and nothing happened Trocar, this is Neville Longbottom. We ran into each other at St. Mungo’s and he wants to know everything that has happened to me so I started by showing him”
“what in Merlin’s name is a horcrux?” Severus questioned a bit harsher than necessary, but this was Julian they were talking about. He was already feeling protective …
Harry flinched at the sharp tone and chuckled nervously “I didn’t mean you exactly. It’s your eyes. Once I realized I was colorblind I realized your eyes could be a different color”
“lacewing … leeches … snake fangs … porcupine quills …” Severus raised an eyebrow, he deduced that the boy had planned to make a dreamless sleep potion. That was fairly advanced for his age ”wicked! Dragon blood!” the potions master rolled his eyes. Maybe he thought too much of the boy if he gets excited over dragon blood … does the brat even know what’s for?
’ Gloria offered, soon after Brian and Harry were riding on the back of the large intimidating crocodile upstream and enjoying the very different environment Australia has compared to the UK …
"I agree … it will be hard to experiment with school going on, so should Sanguini help keep you relaxed-" Harry shut up the second Severus glared, but he couldn't stop the smile from coming to his lips. He couldn't help but be amused by Severus' embarrassment about the obvious he was so motivated to start testing so quickly. "Ready to go?" Harry asked as the shutters closed assuming it was Trocar, but it wasn't. It was Armel.
“actually I was hoping you’d tell us” Poppy said as she scanned Quirrell again and was pleased to see that his magic has calmed down “you seem better already”
“I’ll be the judge of that” Severus said as he unwrapped the bandage ignoring the werewolf’s antics as he played with the kneazles “it’s healing, but I’ll apply some burn salve … the person you helped better have left big tip” the potion master muttered as he carefully dabbed some salve on seared skin on the boy’s palm as he wrapped the hand in bandages again he noticed Cache had a faraway look in his eyes “are you ok?”
That was the adventurous and laid back kind of person he was, but he was a loved headmaster who was ferocious when it comes to protecting children. He won’t stop when it comes to protecting a cub and right now he was plotting to save little Harry …
“and Ms. Granger, you have a regular cat” Minerva answered bluntly. She didn’t want to embarrass the girl, but she was asking for it. As Hermione turned an ugly shade of red in her shame during the students snickering at her Minerva glanced at Dumbledore hoping he’d control the situation, but the wizard looked like he was frustrated by something. With no help coming from the headmaster she raised her hands for silence “that’s enough! Dinner is over so all first years follow the prefects for your house. They will take you to your dorm where you will be staying for the rest of your time here. Should you need anything please speak to your professor. We are here for you”
“I just helped heal the Minister!” Cache blinked owlishly. Granted it was only a cut and he didn’t trust the ministry, but it was still an oddly full filling experience.
A tense silence lingered as the goblin considered what he was just told “what you described is … unnerving, but it is exactly what would be expected if the concept of horcruxes is involved. Do not worry though for this is a treatable condition. For a soul fragment to be removed a ritual must be preformed. Before that can be done I want to see the size of the soul piece first so we know how many horcruxes there are out there” the goblin said as he grabbed a small round gold statue of a witch who’s lower half was smoke off the shelf behind him all while mentally scolding himself. This scan should’ve been done when Harry first came here, but only the basic medical scans were done. Yes, the abuse was horrendous and they had to focus on getting Harry to a safe place, but the boy survived a killing curse! Who knows what that could do to a person? … this was long overdue …
“I’m sure it won’t be that bad- …” Stephen smiled sheepishly as Brian raised an eyebrow and stared blankly at him “I’ll try to talk to Silvia and Sophia before word gets around” he promised knowing that now they were both involved and the twins will take their wrath out on both of them. Aster is safe since after all no one can blame her for taking care of a child in such bad condition and keeping quiet about it, but they were going to get pranked in some way.
“shh secret, danger” Alice said in a hushed voice before losing all her focus and began mumbling incoherently.
"It's not that bad-" Ron trailed off as he looked around what should have been a crowded Great Hall, but saw next to no one there, "Where is everyone? It's nearly time for breakfast."
Minerva stood at the podium in the Great Hall and looked at the students who were waiting for their lunch, “You all may have noticed that some of your fellow students are missing as well as a few staff members. For most issues, it’s a matter of security that I don’t speak of it, but I can say that due to certain issues I will be taking the headmaster’s place,” Minerva paused to let the rush of whispers settle down before she started again, “and I will be making arrangements to find a new DADA professor. Classes will be canceled tomorrow while a new teacher is found, and you’ll see aurors and Gringotts goblins searching around certain places in the school for a few days. Be polite and do not get in their way. Now, please relax and enjoy your meal.” The Transfiguration professor said and sat down to her own meal. She mentioned the meeting set for after curfew to the others, but didn’t chat as much as she normally would. It felt strange being the only one there that may have a clear mind what with Severus still brewing or helping Cache in someway and Poppy helping the girls recovering from the love potions.
“ok … did the goblins say anything about the directions? Cache said they had blueprints” Severus asked as he looked around the chamber for any way out.
“that much is obvious considering he carries around that muggle music player, but what else?” Blaise urged trying to get his friend to think.
“exercise, law and history?” Cache wondered as the vampire starting moving the furniture around to make a big space.
He quickly opened a cabinet and saw the bottomless bag of money. Why was it so hard to get what he wanted? He has done so much for this world that it only made sense that his name was immortalized. Merlin himself had a castle that still exists today and if someone like the filthy Salazar Slytherin can have a castle why not him too? He deserved that much and he was going to get it as soon as he cleared up this mess. With a determined look on his face he grabbed the bag and flooed to the ministry, but he did consider one issue. Harry Potter was simply lucky, but Cache … that brat saw him with the minister. If the boy put two and two together he may say something. He couldn’t risk that. If he had a chance he had to remove that loose end before it caused problems …
Before Trocar, who was hurt by those words, could say anything Cache whistled detting everyone's attention, "Yeah, hi! Remember me? The assistant for this class who's human and can use magic?" Cache chuckled as several students, the brat included, clammed up when they realized that he wasn't just there for show. "Myself and Frank will be helping out, but in all seriousness we aren't needed. Spells require either an incantation or particular movement or some combination to work, which Trocar knows. Does he really have to display what will happen in order to teach it? I learned just fine just through his descriptions of what will happen."
“this is the guy who insulted me in the bookstore, but how do you know this guy too, Ron?” Hermione asked without taking her eyes off of Cache. She wan’t even aware of Draco glaring at them and Neville watching them calmly.
“I’m Cache Devant Vous and these two are Lyra and Libra. I’m 11, almost 12” the blonde answered simply hoping she’d close her mouth soon before the fly buzzing around the room falls in it- … never mind, it’s too late.
Severus nodded “indeed … I gave Griphook the Gaunt ring and the locket since they were goblin made and heirlooms. They’ll take care of it and I was informed that there was a horcrux protocol in all Gringotts banks so if I suspect that a specific item was used the goblins could enter the vault with the orb and legally take the horcrux for me. A piece of someone’s soul doesn’t belong to anyone even if you own the item the horcrux is stuck to. If the locket was used I suspect the other founder items were used save for the sword of Gryffindor. Griphook is setting up an investigation to see if anything can be found … and now that Hogwarts is out for the summer I have time to handle arrangements so Gringotts is transferring my bank accounts over to Australia”
The woman with the gold streak started speaking “-and I’m Silvia. Aster told us you have some scars that-”
Minerva shook her head in a strange mix of fondness and disappoint “your father was like you … he was never very good at schoolwork” she smiled at Julian ignoring Severus’s attempt to stop her before she shoved her foot deep into her mouth “if you transfer here you could improve greatly. Hogwarts is the top magical school so it will be excellent for you and you couldn’t have been in school long so it will be an easy switch really” she said barely taking note of Severus pressing is face into his palm in exasperation and Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes didn’t help though the potion master wasn’t concerned about him. He wanted to talk to Minerva before she embarrassed herself. Dumbledore can embarrass himself all he wants and Severus wouldn’t help. In fact he’d sit back and watch.
“yes, you are recovering so we’ll do simple things, but the intensity will increase over time. To properly defend yourself you need a strong body and I’ll show you some ways to use knives” said Trocar as he effortlessly moved the couch even when then kneazles hopped on for a ride “this is the best way to start Defense Against the Dark Arts. Then I’ll show you some protective charms … well tell you to be precise. Once you’re turned you lose your magic ”
The white haired healer smiled softly as Harry held onto to Brian’s jacket with his tiny hands. Aster was relieved that the twins were coming. She met with them earlier that week when Harry healed more and described Harry’s scars and eyesight issues … and get more nutrition potions since Brian refuses to leave Harry. Although it really was a good excuse Aster suspected he was a little nervous about being within range of the twins by himself.
"I'm Cache, a staff representative from Hogwarts, Master Gritmace." Cache said with a slight respectful bow as they continued through the halls.
“nice music” Frank Longbottom muttered as Cache tucked him “my son” he said a little more clearly than before as his eyes locked on Neville. A blush crept to Neville’s as he sat down on the chair between his parents. His parents seemed a little more stable than they usually would. It was nice …
Light gray dry tongues flicked out to catch the drops much to Harry’s relief. Two pairs of golden eyes snapped open and eyed him warily “I won’t hurt you” the wizard said softly and slowly backed away making sure they could see his hands at all times. He opened two windows and propped open the backdoor making it clear that he wasn’t stopping them from leaving.
Before anyone could consider where the furious wizard went he reappeared with a pop in the center of the room. Everyone froze when they saw him standing there now covered in cuts, ash and bits of charred debris that were leaving small burns on his skin. Not that he noticed …he just stood there quietly before suddenly passing out.
With a full stomach Harry started the process for making a set of dreamless sleep potions. After that dream from last night he wanted to be ready. He will need his sleep if he’s going to keep it together through the next couple weeks. With that potion going he settled down to continue reading the Transfiguration book going over Animagus …
"It's quite alright, Arthur. I'm interviewing a new professor. You have some business to take care of, yes? Ron will have a pass for whatever classes he misses. You shouldn't wait." Minerva said subtly telling him why a vampire was present and reminding him of the reason for the visit.
Severus snorted knowing he would never get the truth out of the old manipulative fool “no Albus, you either tell me the full truth or I go on with my life and don’t bother using that mark as leverage. I found a way to remove it” he snapped as he rolled up the left sleeve of his white button up sheet revealing the shocking sight of a bare forearm.
It was a beautiful evening. The sun was just starting to go down and the stars just starting to peek out. Brian continued walking through the London streets just content feeling the breeze caress his face.
That means Brian had better be careful and Severus too if they find him. Although the UK potions master has been wanting to meet the Australian potion masters who made the potions for Julian so … lets hope it ends well …
As Cache grabbed the inside door knob Sanguini moved the old bronze plate with the room number aside revealing a rune. Cache felt a tingle across his skin and knew the wards were locked to him. The blonde pulled back just in time to see Sanguini placing his key against the rune. After a couple seconds the vampire put the plate back and handed back the key.
The apprentice winced, "Ok … you both remember the Daily Prophet said Dumbledore suffered a magical blowback, right?" He asked, mainly Hermione and Ron, seriously.
“Severus there’s no time for this! We don’t even know if she has the same spells you had!” Cache snapped in worry as Severus looked tipsy meaning he was suffering from the overdose of calming potions.
Cache shook himself out of his daze and smiled, "Yes, I'm fine. I just remembered something that could be useful for a new project."
“I bet no one thought this loaf of bread would be so satisfying for me” Harry snickered as he made three pieces of buttered toast with fruit and scrambled eggs. This was a chance to finally put weight on. He knew that he was way too skinny, but what can you do under the Dursleys’ brand of tender loving care?
Draco rolled his eyes, "They forgot you had patents through Gringotts for your Colorants potions, which are bought regularly by the ministry. Then there's the patent on your moonlight lamp, which was very popular. Giving away the cure for free would've been fine. By the end of the day we settled on 7 sickles."
This new information was concerning because it meant a murder has been on the loose for ten years and Julian should be warned before news of his former identity becomes public “one last thing. Hagrid … did he say if someone sent him to collect the Potter heir or did he just say he’d protect the child?”
A disturbing thought crossed Severus’s mind as he considered this new information “you mean … an entire war happened because one person didn’t receive treatment … what other cases of this do you know of? You said murder or trauma can break a soul so could it have been completelyunintentional from the beginning?”
A note fluttered out of the building as he rubbed his sore nose and landed in his hand going completely unnoticed by everyone except Harry … and apparently Frank who walked over to the young wizard. The note was opened …
“I don’t know the address since she tried her best to give as little details to Lily as possible, but her married name is Dursley, Petunia Dursley” Remus answered as he mentally pleaded that Harry wasn’t there of all places.
ipod and put the now empty bottomless bag in his pocket with his wand … well, nearly empty bag, it still had the cloak. He spotted the pamphlet he received with the ipod and decided to check out the place after he makes a withdrawal. He did need more muggle things than wizarding items anyway.
“Drop your wand!” Moody froze just after casting a spell the sliced the one werewolf’s arm clean off. The retired auror ignored the screams of the one werewolf as he turned to see Greyback pointing a wand at Remus, who looked furious, but couldn’t do anything to help. Of course, Moody dropped his wand and the other werewolves went to help their friend who was nearly unconscious from blood loss. “Get him inside!” Greyback snapped and stepped aside to let the werewolves pass. “You both caused a huge mess.”
“Ok! Ok!” Harry grabbed his box of potions and ran to the floo with his kneazles, but couldn’t resist saying one last thing “if you married him would you be my landlady?” Harry yelped and just barely managed to duck a hex before flooing away ”too close for comfort” he said as he, Lyra and Libra stepped into St. Mungo’s lobby.
The potion master nodded as he turned to his meal “indeed, please call me Severus. As you have displayed an excellent talent in brewing I would like to teach you. Can you tell me a bit about yourself?”
"There ... is?" Hermione commented strangely stunned for someone who should've been told these things before she came to Hogwarts. Perhaps Dumbledore neglected to tell her some things …
Harry sighed as he remembered finding Dumbledore hanging over the bedridden minister the other day “of course … Dumbledore doesn’t want this to get out and he made it sound I went against my will. I bet they think I’m being controlled somehow so it wouldn’t be safe to just walk up to them … no matter, they won’t find anything. I’m going to Gringotts, see you later” he said. The werewolf found a place to wait and relax as Harry left with Lyra and Libra.
Two, find a non magical way to hide his face so he can get to Gringotts without being recognized … potions might work. Some people can feel a glamour or concealment charm … so it said in the charms book … potions might be what he’s looking for.
One of the vampires, Serenity, seated with her twin sister Dawn just smirked, “Bundles of joy aside, how about you tell us about your changes, Trocar?”
“I’m sorry, but I can’t give out details before a trial. It will be in the paper soon. I must go now, but I’ll see you soon Brian” Brian waved as the minister walked away and soon apparated out off sight.
Severus felt his fist clench. Those people are horrid! “that won’t be happening ever again … Lets start working on something different today”
Albus flounced into Severus’s living quarters “it’s time for all the students to return from break, are you ready my boy? How was your break?” he asked far too cheerfully. He knew Severus had no life beyond Hogwarts and Gringotts, but he liked to ask just to rub it in while sounding kind. The potion master looked a bit tan, but the black robes and scowl were still in place so nothing struck him as odd.
Finally Harry was satisfied and hid the bag in his robes as he entered the Gryffindor common room. For the last day of school they weren’t asked for a password.
“with your support I have no doubt” Severus said as he ruffled the boy’s blonde hair affectionately.
In the end Harry decided to force himself to calm down and continue to shop while trying to ignore the potions professor’s presence … just listen to the music …
That fluttering in his right hand told him that the trace was free and one step remained … the button and tracking charm were held together. When Harry was sure there was enough time he set the button next to him picked up his wand … it was revealed that the tracking charm was successfully moved to a button!
A grin of pure vindictive satisfaction appeared on the goblin’s face “I will inform him just before 9:00 on Tuesday. Now this tracking moving skill seems best done by you with your unique magic so would you be willing, for a fee of course, to help some of our other clients?”
“I thought Uncle Severus said I wouldn’t get one” the young confused boy panted as his Dad looked at the letter. Brian’s eyes widened when he saw the letter was addressed to ‘Harry James Potter’ …
Lucius turned to Razorback and tilted his head in a small bow “may your gold ever grow Ra- Master Razorback” Narcissa and Draco bowed slightly too.
Draco glared at his godfather who was invited for dinner “you knew the second I told you my friend’s name”
Next moving his and Hedwig’s charms, but to what? It would have to be something that can be hidden on their bodies until they didn’t want it. If they were seen by the person who put them on them that will realize something is wrong especially if they don’t feel the tracker when he or she is looking right at Harry!
“WHAT?” Draco snapped and ran over to see this letter faster than his parents “it’s in your old name, but how? … you lived in a cupboard?” Draco looked at his friend feeling a strong urge to hug him and offer comfort so he did. He could tell this affected Julian who hugged back firmly.
Trocar twitched and shot the potion master a sulky glare, “I’ll remember that for when Sanguini knocks you up.” The vampire huffed as he watched the babies latch onto their proper bearers’ nipples for some much needed nourishment. He didn’t see the light blush on Severus’ face, but Harry did.
Percy pouted “I’m only nine. Hogwarts starts at 11. My parents got me a wand early to get used to it, but I can’t really start learning for two years. It’s not fair, I see my brothers learning all sorts of awesome things- … looks like my mom is done. Bye”
“I need to look closer at it, hold him” Trocar set Cache down so Severus could try to support him. The potion wasn’t as strong as a vampire, but he was strong enough to hold up the young wizard’s weight when the wizard was leaning on him as Trocar exposed the runes around the craving “yes! It’s all set for parseltongue , but I think I can get around that” Trocar said as he traced runes over the old runes.
But what would happen if his uncle found even just one of the locks unlocked? A sicken feeling settled in Harry’s stomach as he thought about that. It was obvious … even if Vernon thought it was a mistake on his part it would be used as an excuse to beat the young wizard. So what now? He was so close to a massive amount of knowledge, but no means to safely get to it …
“are you ok?” Draco asked as he gazed into the blue eyes and looked for any sign of a problem. Of course he noted the bloodshot state, but was happy to see they weren’t bleeding like before.
Harry gaped as his vision became better … sharper … clearer … and more colorful? He knew he was colorblind. Reds and greens were his downfall. He got used to relaying on his hearing and smell to know when a potion changes stages. However, Harry never really realized how bad his eyesight was until it was healed! The grays changed completely to show other colors including the counter potion to his new potion … it turned red … not that he knew which was red and which was green yet. It was all gray before …
“well … here we go” he kneeled next to Hedwig’s cage and opened it “I’m sorry girl, but if my Uncle Vernon sees you … I couldn’t forgive myself if something happened to you. Take your cage and fly to the house. The window in the attic is always unlocked so slip in and hide there or leave and hunt until I get there. Just please don’t be seen” Hedwig hooted sadly and gently nipped his hand making it clear that she understood the seriousness of the situation.
It was no surprise that Fred and George stood up first clapping wildly “Finally! It’s about time someone broke the Weasley mold! No worries baby sis, we won’t prank your house!” they yelled in perfect sync.
Wolfs bane was the first to fall into the potion professor’s basket, but before Snape moved on through the shelves something caught his eye between the gaps of the shelves …
“it isn’t?” Harry looked so confused. He has always been called freak, but this man is saying that he isn’t one. What is the truth?
The dazed silver eyed wizard mewled as as fingers were removed from his twitching pucker and something much bigger tapped his pucker, "Yes … I want you, Harry-ahhh!" Draco moaned as Harry's hard cock forced his inner ring of muscles open and pushed deep into him.
When Harry and Severus returned from Hogwarts, Poppy was with them. Most of the creatures stayed out of the way as the healer checked the three patients. Even those who went 'wizard hunting' just went into hiding until Poppy left and Harry got some much needed sleep. Very early the next morning, the creatures convened downstairs as Severus helped Harry check on one of their cutest tiny patients and caught Trocar up on the news ...
Cornelius nodded understanding that this may be a bit awkward considering Remus has never made contact with Sirius since that fateful night and may have believed everything including Sirius’s guilt, but Sirius needed someone to help in his recovery and there was no one else he knew “yes, Remus has agreed to oversee every aspect of your care, which we will be paying seeing that this horrendous oversight was on our part. On the days he will have trouble taking care of you I arranged for a healer to stop by and help. She will also examine you and get you the potions you will need. You are to go to a mind healer starting this week if you want to be fit enough to be allowed near any children” he explained making it clear that Sirius would not see Julian until he was deemed healthy in both body and mind. Of course since he also wants to grow the support for foreign magical places he asked Aster to recommend both a healer and mind healer from St. Pearl in Australia “if you’ll follow me I’ll help you get you the paperwork needed … your wand will be returned after the mind healer says so” he said casually dismissing the Wizengamot members and ordering the aorrs to spread the word through only the ministry about a rat on the loose before guiding the frail wizard and Remus to his office.
The effect was surprising … the scar disappeared! After giving the potion a second to dry he touched the spot where the scar was. He could still feel it, but couldn’t see it. Maybe there’s a limit to the healing effects? This wasn’t a normal scar after all.
Brian smiled at his son before looking at the goblins “will his name change his inheritance from his parents?”
Narcissi looked horrified at the thought “we wouldn’t do that! Even if we weren’t indebted to Harry we wouldn’t. It’s a terrible thing and it goes against the teachings of most dark families”
The potion master simply stepped in front of her blocking her path “I’m afraid this is about Lockhart”
The apprentice hummed in agreement “Dumbledore must’ve been out of his mind when he hired him, but why would Lockhart agree at all when he knows this could lead to people discovering he’s a fake?”
"Was that necessary, Sophia?" Severus commented calmly and went over to kiss the woman wearing only his shirt as Lucius recovered. Silvia came out of their room a second later to see what was going on.
“yes I am … I will overlook this just this once, but I will meet him in three months and if he isn’t showing improvement he won’t see Julian” Brian said seriously
“yes and I am glad he is. This was not a possibility I considered happening” Griphook admitted as they entered the master goblin’s office for privacy.
"Just Isabell. She's playing with your three other munchkins in the front yard. Fran is here too with her mother." Isaac said as he started taking the glass vials, flasks and beakers out of the box and lined the shelves.
Lucius sighed in frustration “Draco give Cache your item … this better work” Cache knew the man wasn’t threatening him. Lucius was worried about Draco. What parent wouldn’t be? Mating curses force people to bond with one person whether they like it or not and make bonding with anyone else very painful as Trocar mentioned during lessons.
The sounds of all the goblins using special spells to blind and deafen the basilisk were all Severus could hear was his heart beating rapidly. He was in a heartbroken daze and it was so bad that he was vaguely aware of the team of goblins transporting the massive serpent away and ghost away. The temptation to seal his eyes shut was so very strong. He just didn’t want to see Harry laying lifeless on the ground …
Frank glanced at Harry as he walked out of Gringotts and saw him talking with some people. The two exotic kneazles could be seen watching the scene from the roof of a shop so with Harry in safe hands … or paws … the werewolf made up his mind. Frank followed Remus away from the wizarding bank and stayed back enough to not be noticed or smelled as they went down the cobblestone streets.
“I need to set up a room for him for when he wakes up” Brian said as he stood up. He gently touched the messy black hair with red streaks on Harry’s making the boy relax slightly instead of flinch like before “I’ll be right back. Call me if he wakes up” he watched the boy for a second before flicking his wand over Harry to get some measurements for clothes the boy will need.
Frank sighed, “Only five vampires were burned. Some werewolves were cut up by the glass, but most of them are alright enough to patrol the area.” He said, but then shifted as if he heard something. In fact, the three dark creatures stiffened as if they heard something and didn’t like it. “I think Mike went into labor … and Jenny.”
“unfortunately yes … my father was forced to protect a book. A diary, it’s in my office” Lucius said.
“indeed” Severus said without betraying any of the fear he felt. The fact the twins seemed completely non judgmental about the disgusting mark helped a great deal. In fact they were just waiting for him to explain “I made a stupid decision out of anger when I was young and joined the Dark Lord … I eventually became a spy in order to try to protect a dear friend who I considered a sister … Julian’s mother to be exact. After her death and the supposed death of the Dark Lord I was sent to Azkaban”
“Yes, but considering how much of a fight Sirius kicked up I’m sure he’ll recover quickly.” Megan said amusedly as she pulled out a cellphone. “Use this. The Minister infirmed me of the lack of knowledge on non magical means of communication in the UK so I’ll make this simple.” She said and showed him a few quick things on the phone and told him a charm to get it to work by voice should he forget how to use it in an emergency. “Ok, call me if you have any questions, understand?” She asked as she reached into her bag and set out a potion and a jar of ointment.
"Extraction?" Dumbledore asked, but no sooner did the word leave his mouth did a group of 11 people floo into the room. "What's going on?!" He gasped feeling his control of the situation fizzle away.
Cache chuckled “to answer your question I’m Poppy’s and Severus Snape’s apprentice. I will be an assistant to both parties and allowed to give or take points” he smile cheekily making the two fools pale slightly.
Vampires and werewolves have very sharp hearing and there’s an added boost with a full moon coming …
“I’m fine, trust me I have looked much worse and it helps that you restocked the potions supply for Sanguini so we are healing faster than normal. As far as this Remus guy goes the possibility is there, but lets focus on the potion master first before we take risks. We need those loyalty removing potions. We’ll deal with this guy when those are done, but I’ll go ahead and see if I can hear what he is up to. I may not have a pack, but as an alpha my scent stronger so it will block yours. Stay downwind and avoid moving too much” Frank left the young wizard there as he went into the bank.
“every time I remove them they start pulsing as if they become unstable without something to hold onto. Yours had a guest and something about that guest changed things, but once I gave it the coin it became stable again … out of curiosity do you hate Harry Potter? You seem to have an issue the two nuts who like throwing his name around, which is understandable, but what about him personally?” Cache asked as they passed a store with a special sale on broomsticks to apparently celebrate Harry Potter’s birthday, which Harry found monumentally disturbing. It seemed like everyone was celebrating with sales or specials on this day. He shivered in fear as he wondered what would happen if Harry Potter ever appeared to shop on this day. He kept imagining a mob swarming him … scary.
It was not what this school was meant to be. Hogwarts was supposed to be safe for everyone. The students should never be afraid, but here they were. Everyone was questioning their safety in the supposedly safest place in the magical realm. It was a line of gossip already extending far beyond the school too. The appearance of Arthur Weasley was proof of that …
“how is it? Seeing better?” Aster asked ignoring the twins’ pouting. Of course it worked since they made the potion!
“sorry, but these kneazles are stubborn. It’s safer to find another place to sit” Cache said amused at his feline friends actions and as far as he was concerned it confirmed what Draco feared. These guys weren’t friends …
“yes, it seems Harry is quite the spoiled prankster like his father and we need to keep some of the muggles near him in line if we want to protect him” Albus said putting a little more emphasis on the word ‘protection’ so Severus would feel obligated to help Lily’s son.
Trocar sighed as he forced the whimpering werewolf down on the couch “Frank did something to his jaw last night. He’s in pain”
“he’s probably only in training. If I recall correctly the ring is more for those allowed to brew in the labs, but that alone is an accomplishment. I wonder what Severus would say? He’s always complaining about everyone’s lack of skill in potions, most of all about Potter’s idiocy” said Lucius as Razorback came towards them “is this true?” he asked the goblin.
The headmaster laughed “excellent … you know, we should set up a spot for him in your room and perhaps a place to perch”
"Your three youngest siblings were brought about when your mother stopped taking the birth control." Harry said bluntly getting a glare from Draco for spilling personal details. "What? He'll hear much worse as his lessons in healing get more advanced."
The women smiled as they saw Julian’s eyes light up with curiosity and set the little boy down on the floor “we’ll show you” they said in perfect sync as they stood up and turned their backs to Severus and Julian. Severus’s eyes widened ever so slightly as the women unbuttoned their shirts and let the fabric fall to expose their upper back and upper arms, but kept the front closed to keep some modesty. What caught the Julian’s attention was the tattoos of the cats, hawks and eyes that seemed to be winking at them. Severus caught that and his eyes seemed to roam the deep chocolaty skin “do you like what you see?” they asked as the tattoos lifted off the skin, became bigger and came alive …
“I don’t know” Harry pouted, he just felt the need to completely change his name, but the four year old didn’t think farther than that.
One healer nodded with a smile, "The fact you remember so much is a great sign and you're healthy enough to go home."
Of course Sasha released them after an hour or so for bathroom needs, but she was pleased to see that they avoided her for the rest of the trip. When the train came to a halt they stayed in their seats and waited for her to pass, which she did with a smug strut. However her very good mood was ruined when she started hearing what everyone was talking about, which was the now very obvious absence of the ‘Boy Who Lived’. With one person saying the word ‘kidnapped’ everything went out of control and unfortunately everyone had their luggage, which included quills, parchment and … that’s right, owls …
“Of course, but how will I contact you?” Remus asked knowing the minister had no intention of letting Sirius leave in his condition and he could leave his friend’s side long.
“yes” Cache said looking the potion master right in the eye. He will take no criticism on his choice of home or his neighbors.
Minerva nodded and since Hagrid wasn’t allowed to do magic because of his expulsion years ago, which shocked Cache who did see the giant use magic before, she cast a quick spell on the three felines. A piece of paper appeared and she read the results aloud “Cache’s familiars are full blooded Persian kneazles, which are very rare” she said curious as to how a young man managed to find two let alone one.
"Hot chocolate." Harry said with a playful smirk as he actually placed his finger on one of the tattooed vines and slid it. The vine actually slid with the finger and Harry continued dragging the vine along his forearm until Draco could see a tiny kettle tied to the other end. The kettle was raised up to the point where the kettle on the other end came up from the darkness and actually grew to a full sized kettle when Harry pulled it out of the tattoo.
“what took you Harry? The train will be here in 10 minutes” snapped Hermione a she held her own trunk.
“considering what happened it’s amazing that I’m alive at all” Cache smiled before being cuddled by two worried kneazles “awww were you guys worried”
Severus’s cheeks flushed lightly in embarrassment as he realized he let himself so consumed by dread that he missed that part of the conversation “no where. Now hurry up”
"Gwandpa! Papa!" Joseph giggled from his spot in Draco's arms when 'Harry Potter',or Armel with the coloring potion giving him green eyes and a lightning bolt scar, and Cache appeared on the screen. Harry was seen talking with the owners and hugging Hermione who was crying happily.
“yes. I’m the headmaster of a school for kids like you. You’ll learn all about magic and how to use it with other kids your age” the headmaster saw excitement in the child’s eyes and chuckled “in one year you start school, but for now drink half this” Brian handed Harry a cup with half of the potion in it “it won’t taste good, but really no medicine does. Just drink fast”
"Any student having issues with money can make a deal with us. We will find low prices on what you need, offer scholarships and find you summer jobs to help. This, by the way, is only the beginning of what Gringotts can offer and it's something you should've discussed with us face to face instead of using that wallet. Speaking of," Gritmace made a 'give me' gesture with his clawed hand. Hermione stiffened, but reluctantly pulled out her wallet and handed it over. "I will have a new wallet made for you after we discuss what should've been discussed in the first place-"
The waiting only lasted a few years when he noticed another entity enter. As he floated over to greet this one with the others something else came in. It was another like them, but there was so much anger and hate that they backed up for a moment. After a second sizing up the tiny angry entity, they rushed forward and the six entities tackled the seventh one. Despite the clear conscious attempts to pull away and assert control, the first six got around him and they were able to stick like usual, but they didn't break away like usual. In fact, they began getting more and more stuck …
The young wizard was surprised that he felt calmer than he has ever been around the intimidating professor and smiled “it’s good to meet you sir, would you care to order something too?”
“are you excited to go with your Daddy to the bank tomorrow?” Sophia asked as her sister applied the salve making each scar disappear.
Tripping over several cat toys right when he walked in didn’t even slow him down “she said she locked them up … where are they?” he shut the door to prevent any cats from getting out and quietly looked around.
Poppy rolled her eyes “I’ll see you Severus” her face left the fire and he potion master pulled his head out. From what he gathered today Cache was badly abused and somehow he got away.
Brian leaned against the counter top and nodded “Stephen is empathic so he can read peoples’ feeling and, to an extent, make people relax. He teaches the M&M class for kids and extra sensory classes. I asked him to talk to Julian and help him gain control”
Quirrell chuckled as he crouched down to the boy’s eye level “I’d be happy to help. What’s their name?” he asked not realizing that Julian was using Voldemort’s interest and distain for one Harry Potter to get closer.
"But we just want him to know we'll pay it back-" Ron slapped his hand over his mouth to shut himself up, but both he and Hermione knew it was too late. What they didn't realize was that Cache knew about their debts already. After all, it was his money.
Finally he was released by the furry fiends and the first thing he did was cast the six layered ventilation charms on the kitchen as the book instructed. That made him feel so much better.
Dumbledore mentally screamed in a rage as all of the thousands of Hogwarts students, and a random jackal, raced into the Great Hall yelling about Harry Potter’s disappearance “SILENCE!” he yelled harsher than usual, but otherwise remained in control. As every student fell silent he prepared his speech “there are several things to discuss right now, but since you all are so worried we will start with the issue of Harry Potter who is safe. In fact he was on the train for a moment and you may see him throughout the year. Harry Potter was secretly adopted and his name was changed. This boy Julian River White is Harry Potter” Dumbledore said and as he saw all the stunned faces he wondered he could use Harry Potter’s fame to coax the boy into his reach. Either way he will get what he wants …
“very well, it’s just a simple spell to reveal if you are” Poppy said, but even though she was being nice Harry could tell that she wasn’t really focusing … did she not think he was a natural healer? It seemed like she was humoring him. She said a long incantation and waved her wand in complex movements over him. He felt a tingling feeling and when it was over the tip of her wand glowed green.
name, date of birth, gender and todays date in these spots” instructed Griphook. Vernon nodded and filled in all the information pausing only for a moment to check the date “now your full name and initials here and relation to the child in these spots. Once you’re done your wife will sign next and initial next to you. If are the maternal relative then ‘maternal’ before your relation”
An awkward silence passed before Hermione spoke, "Is it … are you one of the teachers … I mean the paper said ..." Hermione's voice started shaking so badly that she couldn't say anymore, but Cache seemed to understand.
Then there was that strange Quidditch issue … Ron was rambling about how amazing Quidditch is and Harry decided to be honest … he loved flying, but didn’t care for the game and wanted to quit. Again barely a few minutes passed before he was called to the headmaster’s office. Dumbledore was smiling just saying that he wanted to make sure Harry was adjusting ok. After the quick pleasantries the subject somehow changed to flying and Quidditch where he was informed that if he loved flying he had to stay on the team because he can’t fly around the school or in the muggle world.
Harry opened the sewing kit and poked around the different buttons. Mere seconds later he pulled out a solid black button without any shine. A simple tap of his wand and incantation later he saw the creepy glow on his ankle.
“now this potion is for Harry’s height, stick to on table soon with each meal” said Silvia as she pulled out a set of two vial filled with a purple potion.
“lesson one is never assume removing a wand makes your opponent defenseless especially when they can summon their wand back to their hand” Cache said holding his wand in his hand. In fact since he did the spell so fast and no one saw he drop his wand. All the students watched carefully this time and saw the wand fly back into Cache’s hand.
"Umm … can I … bring Crookshanks?" Hermione asked hoping she could, at least, have something she knew there.
“oh I see- … you what?! are you insane?!” the healer gaped as she stared at the headmaster in complete shock “I will, of course, get answers right Brian?” she said so sweetly that the headmaster knew he’d die a horrible death if he didn’t give a really, really good reason for the child on the brink of death in her guest bed … answers which he didn’t quite have right now …
“What?!” Moody growled. He too started moving as fast as he could towards the complex, but they stopped as a group of werewolves came out of the building with their wands raised.
” Harry winced at the harsh sound of his aunt’s shrill vioce. It wasn’t too shocking really. Ms. Figg hated him for some reason … it was possible that it was for the same reason as Petunia and Vernon, but he wasn’t sure.
Severus however didn’t provide an answer for her and instead focused on the goblin “I have a witness willing press charges in the line theft cases”
“screwed up?” Harry suggested and Severus nodded “yeah and it has to stay a secret until Dumbledore has no authority over me”
"Nice use of the barrier." Cache praised Draco as he stood next to the blushing Malfoy. When he saw Greg and Vincent stand back up he stood between them and Draco along with the kneazles so they couldn't take Draco again. "What's all this about?" He asked seemingly quite calm, but he was ready to fight if needed.
"I remember … the orphanage I grew up in … meeting Dumbledore." Tom looked hurt and tightened his grip on Julian's hand. The blonde with the tiny occamy in his hair never left his side even when he was dressing. It was comforting. "He said I was a wizard like him, but he just left me there with the muggles …" Tom trailed off sadly.
