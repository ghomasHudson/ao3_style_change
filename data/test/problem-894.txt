Theo was fast with his wand, but Draco could still see the evidence of cards that had exploded, littered around the playing area. The boys would grow up together just as Draco and Theo had, but without the stifling stigma of pureblood politics.
Harry talks.
She began to dig through her purchases, separating hers from those of her mother-in-law's. Since she'd been in London today, she'd agreed to grab a few things that Molly needed to finish her holiday preparations.
The pane of glass was cold and frosty in front of him, but still, Draco could see the wisps of smoke as the gate let down its guard for the first arrival. He drew in a breath, and let it go as his father appeared. The entire feeling in the manor changed as its lord and master arrived.
Robes of maroon and shining, brown dragon leather shield belts, that glowed in the dimness of the room, drove back the fear. His wand held aloft as he bent to the floor. "Draco…"
Hermione was seated across the table from Malfoy, and they were bent close, examining their mugs. Harry stared at the two of them and shook his head, wondering why the damned things were so interesting. He should have known she was listening though because she answered his statement as if she had been involved the entire time.
"Don't start with me," Draco hissed.
Harry stood. "I dare because it is my life."
"Something the matter, Rosebud?" Harry asked as he mounded the clay ball and stood.
Hermione closed her eyes. Sparkles washed up over the mug and the midnight blue and white porcelain exploded with stars. They whirled for a moment, settling on Taurus and then it blurred to reveal Scorpius.
Lucius held out a hand and Narcissa, wrapped in a luxurious fur-lined cloak, folded her gloved fingers into his. Lucius drew her near, the snow drifting over the two of them as Lucius bent and slanted his mouth over hers.
Narcissa' face twisted and her eyes clouded for just a moment as she watched Hermione then her emotions fell away, clearing into the closed-off mask she always wore. She focussed on Ron. "I believe you, Mr Weasley," she admitted softly. "I just hope it is in time."
He thought about Malfoy's mug. His son and someone for his own. Harry understood this desire as well, and although he didn't want children of his own, the thought of a lover appealed.
Physical things are lost while emotions are found.
Embarrassed that he'd been caught looking, Scorpius turned and made his way to the Slytherin table. Sitting at the end, where he had a clear view of the Ravenclaw third year girls, he prepared himself a bowl of porridge and tried to put Weasley out of his mind.
He wiped his hands and stood to answer the door, forgetting he was dressed only in his joggers. Harry opened the door and stared at the elegantly dressed, blonde woman with a decorated basket. "Yeah?"
"I'm certain my father is allowing said rowdiness to make certain Scorpius sleeps the sleep of the exhausted tonight." Draco turned to her. "Do you know he got up four times last night just to say goodnight and get a drink of water? Millie was beside herself trying to keep track of him."
"Harry's never been derelict in what he sees as his duties," Hermione snapped and placed a palm to her stomach, her body stiffening and she closed her eyes.
Prompt #5 Naughty or Nice
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, trying to ignore the turning and whirling sensation as he spun through the Floo Network. He finally tumbled out, spitting and coughing ash onto a large stone hearth. He pushed his glasses up onto his forehead and rubbing a hand across his eyes to clear away any remaining soot. Adjusting his metal frames, he blinked and looked up into the surprised expression on Narcissa Malfoy's face.
A young female elf opened the front door for Draco and took his cloak. Inside, somewhere, Scorpius and Theodore were laughing, and he could also hear Theo Senior's loud, deep chuckles, too. It made Draco's heart soar that his son was as happy and at home here as he was at Malfoy Manor.
Scorpius had suffered the brunt of his parent's implosion with better finesse than Draco had, and he'd instigated the matter. Draco cut his eyes at his mother as he accepted the Gunfire cocktail.
The blotch became wings and Harry straightened as the owl homed in on his person. The animal swooped around the house once and came back about before it then landed right on front of him on the veranda railing.
"There's no need for these displays at the breakfast table, Cissa," Lucius snarled. "He's supposed to be a grown man, with a child no less, not a gigolo catting around at the bathhouses."
Narcissa insisted on Harry coming to the manor, to both his and Malfoy's embarrassment. Harry agreed to visit with a blank sample of a place setting once he'd worked up a clay body to her specifications. They had hashed out a date. The Malfoys had finished their shopping leaving Harry quite a bit richer and as well as emptier in his shop.
Fighting with Malfoy had given him a reason to live, even if it was just to prove that he had something to prove. He missed it and when he'd said something of the like to Hermione, she'd looked at him as if he'd lost his mind.
"Send an owl if you wish for me to have a chat with your parents about continuing lessons.
And hit the floor of his bedroom so hard it rattled his teeth. He laid on the floor, panting, sweat-soaked pyjama clinging to his body as he shivered from the nightmare. Knots in his hair rubbed against his scalp, and Draco swore that trees were scratching at the windows. He stared at nothing...
Harry nodded. "That's settled then. There's one last Hogsmeade day before the holidays begin. The Hogwarts Governors and the Hogsmeade Retailers Association agreed to allow this double day as the school will be out Christmas next week. I'll let both children know that they can come to the shop tomorrow."
Andromeda laughed and Harry was hard pressed to see the illness that was taking her from him and Teddy. See the weakness he did, however, in the paleness of her face, her gasping breaths and the traces of silver in her dark brown hair. She finally accepted his assistance, wrapped her hand around his arm, and Harry felt how heavy she leaned on him.
"What have you found, Dragon?" Narcissa inquired and Draco held out the stein to her. The constellation slowly drew itself into being this time. The dragon's eyes were still bright silver as the lines filled in on the night sky background.
Draco scooped up Scorpius and held him close before placing him on the ground once more. He nodded to both Theos and let Scorpius lead him back to the game. Settling on the floor beside Scorpius the group rearranged themselves with the Nott father and son competing against Malfoy father and son.
Draco exited the Floo at The Three Broomsticks and held out a hand to his mother. She stepped gracefully from the hearth and used her wand to remove the soot from their clothing. They had just stepped toward the door when the fire flared again and Hermione Granger stepped out.
Stop that. You sound like Draco."
"Oh, um, thank you, I think," Harry said and sat at the fourth chair at the table next to Malfoy.
He was usually the first one to leave, and rarely stayed long let alone overnight, but then again, Harry Potter wasn't a normal wizard, then again was he?
Malfoy snorted and Harry ignored him.
"My apologies for taking so long in returning."
"I read the old law books, Ron, I just…" Hermione swallowed. "Are you certain I should come?"
He didn't like to think about the things he'd heard but the anecdotes had shaped his life. The looks in his mother's and father's eyes. The expressions on his grandmother's and father's faces. The side eyes of the public and people whom he associated with. He understood, even at the supposedly tender age of fourteen that despite the changes and his privilege, he was considered… unseemly in some parts of society no matter how they acted towards his face and family. Proof of that had been driven home more than once but the most recent just the day before.
"Don't tempt my wife, Draco," Theodore Nott walked into the room. "I might just let her carry out her nefarious plans for you."
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, clinging to him as he was soothed. Fragrant bubbles filled the air and kissed his flesh, cleansing the terror. Lips and nips decorated his nape, and he wrapped the wet strands of Harry's hair in his fingers.
Hermione shook her head even as she knelt in front of the Burrow's fireplace. "Harry's mugs don't travel by themselves." Tossing in a handful of Floo powder, she called out for Hannah Longbottom.
"You don't even know what was going on. It was an innocent pottery class that you interrupted."
Harry fought a grin. Despite her auburn hair, Rose looked just like Hermione at that age, with Ron's blue eyes. "Right. Do I need to go and put the fear of Harry Potter in this person?" He paused. "It is a person, correct, and not a beastie?"
As of late, Draco had acquired one thing, one person, that seemed to be a shining beacon in the seasonal blues. He awaited the return of his lover, one he'd never anticipated considering their past associations. It always surprised him to see the other man on the grounds,  willingly in his home, and most importantly, in his bed. Regardless, of how long his affair had been progressing, Draco did not take their continuation a foregone conclusion. Moments were fleeting and he'd learned that harsh lesson at Father Time's knee.
The comfort had his eyes drifting closed until a chime surged through the manor. Narcissa was already on her feet as Draco shook off the drowsy sensations. He made his way over to the window to stand beside Narcissa. Candles flickered in the room and the one on the window sill outlined a figure.
Hermione stopped searching her bags and looked at Arthur. "Oh, dear. Well, I do hope he begins to feel better. Molly's chicken soup will certainly cure what ails you." She delved back into the bags, now removing individual items as she dropped empty bags on the floor.
"No, the Black Family lives on in Teddy. He will inherit the estate when I pass."
George slapped Harry on the back firmly before holding him at arm's length and looking him over. "You look good, Harry. 'Bout time you came back."
"Oh, wonderful, my dragon! This is what I want. Are there more?"
He turned his wand to the benches, blew off the accumulation, as he thought about what else he needed to do before the business day began. Another wrist flick and the torches were ablaze, offered both light and warmth on an overcast day.
"Hurry," Harry panted.
Malfoy helped his mother into the Floo then followed, his eyes remaining on Harry until they spun away.
"Someone's got to keep an eye on--"
Draco shook his head and turned back to the table where he'd found the mug, but nothing else struck him as their one piece had. Flagging down a sales clerk, he held up the stein.
Harry braced himself, holding onto the underside of Malfoy's hand. His skin was warm and dry, smooth yet firm. He settled the mug on Malfoy's palm and placed the tip of his wand by the base.
Prongs knelt gracefully then looked up at Harry. He reached out and touched the stag between the antlers, revelling in the good feelings Prongs radiated. "Go to Rose, and Scorpius Malfoy, please and give them these messages."
He turned to look for more pieces, releasing the handle when he felt Narcissa' fingers against his own.
He reached forward, and as Narcissa drew closer, she could see Scorpius look up at whatever it was that Potter had said. Just then a young red-haired girl wrapped her arms around Scorpius, her hands sliding along his as he held on to a spinning wad of mud.
In the Black box, Narcissa held on to Andromeda as she floated in a chair, both women dressed in grey robes with black trim. Teddy held his grandmother's hand and waved enthusiastically to her then pointed at the dais. She grinned at him and waved back at the boy.
Narcissa leaned toward him. "Perhaps you should hear him this time, then my darling. I feel he has spoken quite loudly often enough."
"Malfoy."
Red and golden finery decorated the house, and in spite of the chosen colour theme, it was tastefully done. Even he could appreciate the eye with which Astoria welded her talent. That she made the bright colour enjoyable was no small feat, and he didn't expect anything less from Astoria. Theo adored her and indulged her every whim, so he wasn't surprised to see the colour scheme carried on into the house.
"Commence!"
"My mug," Hermione ground out.
Harry's eyes searched the room, trying to catch the familiar gaze that went with the feeling. Steel grey met his look and Harry missed a step. The intensity was still there and it made his throat dry. He watched Malfoy for the entire dance and when it ended, Malfoy was the first one to look away. Harry led Hermione back to their table.
"Thank you, Kreacher."
Hermione blushed. "Well, we are planning on it for next year."
Lucius wrapped his arm around Narcissa as they made their way up the walk and the gates misted closed. Once more the entire the manor changed life, longevity, and magic had returned.
The desire to be in Potter's presence, even when he had been younger, was overwhelming and he didn't think the man knew exactly how exciting it was to be near The- Boy-Who-Lived. Potter was very much a legend and yet as Draco aged, he began to see Potter as a normal wizard. A very humble sort of man despite the inflated press about him.
Despite how tall Malfoy was, he still stood on a small stool, his back to the window. A basted dark green robe was on his wide shoulders, and it cut off at his hips. His long legs were clad in the same dark green as another man checked the break for his trousers.
A gentle squeeze to the firming flesh and an inquiry. "Yes?"
Harry walked down Charing Cross Road, taking in the Christmas decorations and the shopping crowds. He really didn't have time to just stroll through the busy street, but he did. And he knew Andromeda was waiting, but he was reluctant to see her in her current state. She had supported him with every decision he had made after the war, and though she wasn't happy about all of them, she had let him make them on his own. He came to her because she had not demanded his presence, but she had asked for him. And so Harry left his bespelled home as per what he assumed was her last request.
Malfoy walked in front of him and as Harry tread on his heels into the Alley, he inhaled the scent of leather and smoke. It was just as expensive as Harry imagined it would be if he'd ever gotten close enough to scent Malfoy when terror wasn't bleeding from his pores.
"I'm glad for you then. I've had enough strife in my life as it is."
Harry nodded. "It had to be done. And I let you know where I was as soon as I could. Only you, Andromeda and Kingsley knew how to contact me."
With a nod, Kreacher popped away. Harry knew he could have sent an owl, but he also knew that while Kreacher didn't mind working his service at Hogwarts, it was best for him to have contact with his true Master every once in a while.
They stared at one another in silence then Hermione pointed at the mug. "That's mine. Where did you find it?"
"Hermione and Malfoy."
Draco sat up and tossed the half-eaten cookie back on the plate, watching as Narcissa curled her fingernails into Lucius. "There is no display. I came home and was having breakfast."
"Teddy's visiting Molly, as Bill and Fleur and their children have arrived for Christmas at the Burrow. I'm afraid he's got a tiny crush on Victoire. They are so cute at that age." Andromeda waved off her musings. "So, you'll have to wait to see him, Harry," Andromeda spoke once Narcissa had left.
Hermione waddled around the table, utensils floating behind her as she gingerly set the silverware at each place. It was the least thing that Molly would give her to do, even though she had explained numerous times to her mother-in-law that she was only pregnant, not an invalid.
A soft buzzing sound filled the kitchen and Andromeda's eyes went wide. "H-h-harry?"
having a common interest. But perhaps I'm not qualified to say so as I don't have children." Harry offered as they entered the kitchen.
Hannah wasn't expecting all her glassware at once, but he still needed to get a prototype for her soon. Perhaps he would get back to that tonight.
A house-elf appeared and quietly settled tea on an occasional table, eyeing Draco and wringing its hands before silently popping away. Turning, Draco prepared the tea to his satisfaction. To keep the elves as bay, he ate the tiny sandwiches and a few biscuits from the platter and focussed on the window once more with the steaming cup of comfort.
Draco and Scorpius stood, both in resplendent robes with silver trim and focused on the dais below. Draco turned and lifted his head to her before turning to the left.
Malfoy groaned and stretched, and Harry arched an eyebrow when his prick moved again in interest. "Wake up. You can't be here when Scorpius and Rose arrive."
Pushing through the crowd, Harry made his way over to George and laughed out loud as his suit blurred. The colour lightened and became shockingly red as snowman appeared, dancing across George's chest and legs. Harry followed George to the back of the shop and they ducked behind the curtain. The fabric was charmed just right and the noises in the shop fell away as they stood together.
The deep voice was strong and through his hysteria he recognized it.
"No. I won't discuss this with you. In spite of her being my family, she is now a Malfoy. The Malfoys caused you to lose your magic. The Vow you took stole your magic instead of your life."
Sucking in a breath, Harry stared at Rose. "Bloody hell."
Hermione and Malfoy turned glares on Ron, and he crossed his arms over his chest, glowering right back at the two.
"Close your eyes and
Eyes wide, Hermione gestured to the cup. "You paid fifty £ for a used mug? My mug?"
"Harry!"
Nott made kissy noises and Scorpius slammed the door on his laughter.
"You are lecturing me about my own mug when you have violated the Statue?"
"Your child? What was he doing to my Rosie?" Ron shouted. "Harry, why did you let them leave?"
"You did what was needed, Harry. No one could have predicted the laws the Wizengamot would pass down."
Snape shoved Potter aside and sneered down at Draco. "I warned you."
Potter looked up then and pointed. Both children stared out the window, faces pale.
It wasn't needed, though, as Draco knew Harry's body as well as his own. Lips and teeth moved over the skin, while hands dispensed with winter garb. Harry broke his hold on Draco long enough for him to lay them out in front of the hearth.
Harry sighed. "True, but I will prevail."
Harry watched him saunter down the Alley, his hair hanging down in a sheet. Only this time Harry noticed it wasn't quite as straight as he'd seen it every time before. The ends of the long strands curled just below his shoulder blades.
"My so-called magicless circumstances didn't matter, but Andromeda did. Teddy, Scorpius and little Theo. They mattered. You all mattered to me, and I did what I could to make certain you had a chance at a happy life."
"I don't agree with your opinion, Harry, you have Teddy and so that is like having a child."
Hermione bit her lip. "Oh, tell her I don't care, especially since she made it."
"I was going to inquire the same," Malfoy added, cutting across Ron. "Although it's because I am interested in the process myself. Most witches and wizards just magic up what they needed. Potter's crafting is different."
She, too, chose her child as one of the stars in her life, but like Harry, her second desire was the world during spring. It spoke volumes that Narcissa Malfoy was entirely content in her life after all that had happened.
Ron grunted and stormed out of the shop, leaving Hermione, Harry and Malfoy alone in the front room of the shop.
Draco straightened. "My aunt is ill, and doesn't need the attentions of an unruly child disturbing her peace."
Narcissa narrowed her eyes. "There is nothing wrong with my son taking over the family."
Malfoy gave him a lazy look. "Quite possibly, but you have been asking for that all day. Dare I say begging for it for quite some time, even."
Astoria slipped her arm around Theo's waist. "We don't warn the enemy, darling."
He glanced around the room, eyeing the decor. It was posh and masculine, in warm tones of browns and blues, and in spite of the neutral colours, he liked how it looked. Astoria had a way with fabrics that had just appealed and he'd spared no expense when she wanted to redesign his quarters.
"Your father and I missed you at dinner," Narcissa murmured as she took the china from him.
Harry shook his head. "No buts. I can do magic and I don't want you, or anyone else for that matter, angry at Draco. This wasn't his fault."
The fireplace stoked up immediately after their arrival and the warmth began to penetrate through the outside cold that had settled in his bones, no matter how well they had been bundled up. Sighing, he settled into the cushions, just holding on to Harry. He was quite snug under Harry's weight and his groan turned into a moan.
Lucius walked with Scorpius along one of the paths in the snow. He stopped to speak to someone and then pulled Scorpius up into his arms. He held the boy up while a worker allowed his son to place an ornament on the tall tree outside the downstairs' library window.
With a deep breath, Harry stepped into the Floo after calling out Hermione's name. He almost tumbled onto their hearth after the trip but caught himself at the last moment on the fireplace's mantle.
"I don't care. He's very nice to me and a great study partner in Ancient Ruins. I… I like him, Daddy."
His mouth bit at Harry's and Harry answered with teeth in kind. He reached for Harry, grasping both of their cocks together and thrusting, stroking them to a rough and fast finish.
, & #12:
"But," Ron began.
Harry laughed. "All right then. Go on with you and I'll see you this weekend."
"But…"
Ron pointed and Harry glared at him. "Don't start."
He gasped his last breath…
"Oh, Merlin!" Ron moaned in the background.
Draco eyed the young man, noticing his trim form and appreciating it. Dressed in fitted robes that clung to his lean body, the assistant moved competently behind Astoria, anticipating her needs as she checked the decor of his room. The only thing that wasn't neat about the man was his hair. The brown strands made it appear as if he'd just crawled from someone's bed and Draco was none too happy about it as lust curled in his belly. The boy was too young as he couldn't even see a hint of stubble on his youthful face. Pity.
Harry arched a brow. "Really?"
Hary makes his way to Andromeda's home.
He'd never realized that the sleepy village he'd visited during school was more than that. It was a bustling empire just like Diagon Alley, and apparently had a nightlife all of its own. He wondered how much it has cost Potter to close up shop early to handle the matters of the day.
Ron eyed the older woman, reminding himself that the last of her family was dying, and that in spite of everything that had happened, Andromeda deserved peace through her last wishes.
She reached down and touched one of the open wounds on his chest. The point of contact burned like a Cruciatus and Draco screamed, the pain mingling with the awful sounds Moaning Myrtle still made.
"I do hope you are certain, Mr Weasley," a soft, firm voice replied and Ron stiffened. Turning with Hermione still wrapped in his embrace was an exercise in and of itself, but he refused to let the situation upset Hermione, and Merlin knew Narcissa Malfoy's' presence brought comfort to only a select few people in the house.
"Harry." Ron entered the parlour and just eyed him for a moment. "We're in the kitchen."
Draco kissed him. "I'll find the bruise balm."
"Harry…"
"You didn't help matters either."
Harry straightened the mess he'd made as the tiny townspeople waved at him. The village had been one of the very first pottery crafts he'd undertaken, and it had aged well. Hermione had only added to it over the years, and it spread across the entire shelf. He took in the rest of this years' holiday decor, smiling at the candles in the window.
"Good day to you, too, Ronald," Malfoy snarked and Harry turned to stare at him.
"You do, too." Harry bowed his head but didn't answer George's unspoken question. "Andromeda said it was time."
He pulled out another bit of parchment to return Harry Potter's message after he'd finished the one for his father.
Harry sighed. "Time. That was the cost."
Harry knew better than to fuck wizards or even witches for that matter. Most couldn't keep their mouths closed, Muggles weren't any better, but at least they didn't talk to the Daily Prophet reporters. Both he and Ginny had made a point to make certain they had been discreet after they had parted ways but somehow or another the entire group of friends just seemed to be prone to press magnets.
Harry inclined his head. "I'll be there."
"Potter! You can't just dismiss my child!" Draco snarled.
Home to Draco.
"Is that Scorpius?" Draco asked.
Narcissa took a cup from the house elf and settled back into the plush settee. She let out a sigh and closed her eyes, breathing in the fragrance of the oolong tea. Draco watched her for a long moment as she relaxed before the next bout of shopping. He'd always thought her beautiful when he was younger. And he still believed as much now, even though he could see the years beginning to catch up with her at the corners of her eyes and mouth.
Many boxes were empty, still, and some would remain dark until an heir could be appointed. Some of the families she remembered from the history books were long gone; their seats absorbed by the second most branches of other families.  She looked around for the rest of her contemporaries.
"Hermione and I both are large as a house!" Angelina laughed and waddled over to him, embracing him gently. "How are you, Harry?"
"If anything breaks, you buy it," Harry snapped.
"Well, you give her my best, then, eh, Harry?"
"Thank you, Mrs Malfoy," Harry answered.
Potter offered him his bag while they waited. If Draco didn't know better, he'd have wondered at the action. It was positively charming considering the day they had.
Narcissa nodded and turned, walking back to the sick room as Andromeda's voice warbled her name.
He twirled Hermione around the dance floor, listening with half of an ear as she prattled on about whatever cause she had picked up recently.
Even now he could still scent her perfume throughout the manor in her absence. She'd only gone shopping with his father, but the stillness of the grounds unsettled him. Melancholy set in all the faster these days, and he was rarely compelled to leave his home. Almost everything he could desire was in this house, and so he felt no need to venture out into an ever-increasing cold world. Almost.
The clerk eyed the mug for several minutes and Draco narrowed his eyes as he watched the man. "I'm afraid I don't recognize this piece."
Draco stared out the window a moment longer while his mother spoke with the house-elf. Harry kept his eyes on Draco, the snow glistening white on his dark hair. His mahogany Auror robes, dishevelled, dirty, and pocked marked with spell damage, and still, he trod forward.
"Harry's returned," Ron said, his voice soft and he tossed the powder into the flames. "I can't believe he didn't come to us first, though."
Prompts :
"Want something?"
It was almost scandalous the way the three of them appeared everywhere in society together. Sometimes the Weaslette was with them, but most often as of late that had changed and Draco noticed. The press had noticed as well.
Andromeda shrugged and looked over her shoulder at the door. She gazed back at Harry and squeezed his hand. "I don't want to talk about that right now."
The newest book in the murder mystery series her mother read gleamed back at Rose in all its glory. The mind candy read was something her mother only indulged in occasionally and never bought them new, but she'd been eyeing this one for a few weeks. She almost hadn't bought it considering the way her parent's had acted recently, but they were human. And Uncle Harry had put them in their place. A flick of her wand had the book wrapped and nestled in her trunk, the luggage almost fully packed to return home at the end of the week.
"Scorpius informed me that he would like to attempt the lessons, and I have agreed. His grandmother is also in agreement, and I am just waiting on Asteria's reply as she and I share Scorpius over the summer months. I won't allow anything to shorten their time together." Malfoy answered.
Draco took the mug and flipped it over, cursing softly as he recognized the symbol in the pottery. He'd know that shape anywhere and understood his mother's reaction a moment ago. A small lightning bolt was the only thing carved into the bottom of the mug. "Potter."
It didn't help.
Narcissa nodded, though she was paler than normal. "How did a piece of wizard craft make it out of Diagon Alley?"
Lucius opened his mouth to say something and she shook her head. "You repair this, Lucius. I don't care how, but I refuse to go into this holiday with anger in this house. It is tangible, even now, and I won't have it. This will be Scorpius' first Christmas home since Asteria left."
"Draco knows. He helped me make the decision. We did it together, to save us both from being made the Wizengamot and the ICW's scapegoats. I got my freedom, and Draco got to keep Scorpius."
The lawn had been winterized, with little green showing through the blanket of winter, and here and there in the hedges, shaped like fantastic magical creatures, he could see the fairies giving off their lights.The colours gave the evergreen creatures a festive look and Draco could see it matched this year's theme for Christmas.
Still, he looked back and met the stare. He felt the challenge there and he fell into Potter's green gaze. Power washed over him, both magical as well as masculine, and Draco felt like cold water ran through his views. While there was something there, something had always been there between him and Potter, but now more than ever, it was forbidden.
Draco used the servant's entrance to the manor, still lost in his thoughts. He wound his way through the halls, ending in the kitchen, scattering house-elves and chuckling when they regrouped almost immediately. They offered him Christmas cookies and tea if he would just leave them to their preparations.
Draco reached out and his fingers clamped onto the other man's hands. He squeezed and the gesture was returned. Hope sprung forth, warming the chill from his insides. Air-filled his lungs and arms wrapped about him, bracing him against a strong chest, and holding him tightly.
Harry watched her vanish behind the curtain to his private area and then turned back to the other three adults.
My apologies for the delay. I've been very ill, and still am, so fair warning updates will be sporadic, but the story will be finished.
"Well, at least you are honest about it. I know Ron isn't so altruistic." Hermione snapped.
Draco spun around and glared at Harry. The argument was one they'd had before. It wasn't right or fair but life rarely was. "And now?"
Frustrated, Harry ran his hands through his hair and leaned in. Malfoy bent and Harry was on him this time, his mouth biting into Malfoy's.
"You can do it, Harry!" Granger-Weasley called as she floated by and turned her body into a jump.
Astoria sighed. "You didn't have to be such an arse about it either."
Harry stood in the atrium, watching people leave in droves. The lines for the Floo were long, but the eyes were back on him again as he stood behind Neville and Ginny. Malfoy was two lanes over, his mother clinging to his arm, and Harry drew in a breath.
Many things had changed in the wizarding world, and yet, some things remain the same. It was inappropriate, he told himself, to watch after Malfoy, but he couldn't help himself.
Draco shook his head. "He's my son, too, you know, and it's true."
Arching a brow, Harry leaned to look out the window. Children milled about, some in groups and others solitary, but he didn't see anyone, in particular, searching out Rose.
Narcissa gasped as Scorpius looked up into the girl's face, his mouth in a wide grin as he listened to her speak. He nodded and together they bent to the mud as it flared out into a bowl shape. Her gaze flicked to Potter and noted the smirk on his generous mouth as he unfolded his arms and applauded.
"You've much to learn about being tailored, Potter, but allow Marcus and Guillaume to work their magic. I promise you won't be disappointed." Malfoy shook his head and chuckled.
"Who?"
Harry sighed as he moved with her to the table. They sat and Harry ignored the wince of pain that crossed her face. Her breathing was laboured, but she closed her eyes for a moment to steady herself. "I wanted to come and have tea outside of the sickroom." She paused and opened her eyes, just looking at him and smiling. "I'm so glad you are here."
"The rheumatism is worsening, but it seems as if they are making her comfortable." Angelina finished and then looked over his shoulder at George.
Draco nodded his head, feeling sentiment heat his cheeks. "It's not always a given, Mother."
They shared the look for an eternity it seemed. No one spoke and neither he nor Narcissa blinked. Then it was over. As if her decision was made, Narcissa looked away. She reached out and took Andromeda's hand.
Narcissa opened her mouth, and Andromeda could see that something awful was going to fall out those thin lips. She cut it off before it could even be aired. "Do not befoul this room with your nastiness."
"That's done it, I'm leaving."
"Yes, Dragon. I'm here. I've got you."
Narcissa nodded. "Andromeda is resting, but perhaps you'll have tea with me whilst she naps?"
Just when he thought the torment was over, he realized it had only just begun. He had never mastered the Patronus spell, and he was alone. Always alone.
Potter led Draco toward his shop, and Draco waited for his answer while they partook of the Christmasy treats.
"Rosie?" Granger-Weasley inquired.
Drawing his wand, he tapped the access sequence, the feeling of Malfoy's eyes on his back the entire time.
Malfoy stayed for his entire fitting, watching as Harry was measured and questioned. He gave all his opinions on colour and cloth, as well as layers, textures and patterns. Harry ended up with several new pieces being ordered by the time Malfoy was finished.
Hermione drew in a breath, her eyes wide. "Oh, Merlin! Is this what Rosie's been working on?"
Harry lay on top of him, panting in Draco's ear. "Don't ever let me do that again."
Ron scooted back from the table and walked over to stand behind her, his arms wrapping about her and he splayed his hands across her very distended stomach. He rubbed her belly, grinning as he felt the motions of their child within and pressed a soft kiss to the back of her neck. "He'll make it," Ron reiterated.
The rare show of public affection made Draco's heart swell even in his isolation. His parents had been through rough patches in their life, but the ardour for one another never faded. He desired this most fervently.
Draco watched Potter from across the room. His taste in clothing had improved since Hogwarts. He still had that slender, underfed look and yet, someone had swooped in and shown him that more than off-the-rack existed.
Theo sat on the floor, holding his wand aloft as he helped his son and Scorpius play Exploding Snap. Draco watched as the two played a variant of the classical version, and since neither boy was old enough to have a wand, they called out Theo Senior's name to catch their matches. Just as Theo and Draco had done when they were young, only Narcissa had been their partner after Theo's mother had passed away.
Hermione looked back over her shoulder and frowned. "I don't know that we have a few days."
"Master Harry."
His hair, longer than he'd worn it during school, flowed down his back in a sheet of white. The robes he had on, a steely blue-grey, were high necked and fitted and yet, even with the cold beauty of Narcissa Malfoy beside him, Harry thought Malfoy stood out.
"Glad to be useful," Harry deadpanned.
Ron scowled. "No. I actually don't want the git here, but Hermione thinks she has something to prove."
"Aye!"
"Father!" Scorpius shouted and scrambled to his feet, racing around Theo and throwing himself into Draco's arms.
All the trees along the lane were decorated as well, and the cobblestone paths clear of snow except for a few melted puddles here and there. They passed by an outlet of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes and Ronald Weasley stepped out to goggle at his wife as she charged up the street, both Malfoys right behind.
He turned and met Harry's gaze, his long hair shifting across his shoulders. The pale waterfall of hair was straight as a board and Harry had a fierce desire to see it mussed. He could almost scent some masculine hair potion, musk and cashmere, and the urge to run his fingers through the lengths was irresistible.
"Sir, I can't in good conscience sell this mug to you when I don't know where it came from."
"Gentlemen!" she cleared her throat, trying to get their attention before shouting could break out.
"But.."
Pushing through the curtain once more, Harry settled his wares on the counter. "Hermione."
Weaving his way in and out of several more shops, Harry spent his time shopping for his family for Christmas. He'd had no plans to leave his island, but needs must and if Harry had learned anything over the years, it was that one never returned home without gifts.
"Andi," Harry answered and moved forward to help her.
A small creak at the door had both Harry and Draco turned to face the portal. "We've not killed each other, so please join us."
"Harry," Andromeda breathed and Harry spun around to find her standing at the doorjamb, clinging to the wall to steady herself.
"I make it a point to have them at least once a season." Potter tossed his shells into the bin by the cart.
Harry nodded. "I put myself in your capable hands."
"Congratulations then." He ran his wand about the mug a second time and the mug glowed.
"Beautiful."
"What parties? Harry, you've been deprived your heritage, of Sirius' and the Family Black's legacy."
Hermione smiled and waved then exited the shop.
Harry stared back at her, his mouth set in a grim line. "What did you hear?"
Relief filled Harry. "Good to hear."
His spiders, tiny lifelike replicas of Aragog and his children, scared the life from Ron, but they were popular for Halloween. Buckbeak the hippogriff was more form than detail because while Harry worked with his hands, he felt that he just wasn't that good of an artist.
The flickering flames were a holdover from when he and Ron had been with the Aurors those first years after the war. Through the snowfall, he could see the twin flames across the way in Molly and Arthur's windows as well. The rest of the decor was simple and clean, the fairy-lit tree hummed with the sound of the wings from the fairies as they gave their magic to the tree for the season. Everything else was mostly homemade and nature-related, but it suited the people that lived in the house.
"Distracted more this time than usual."
"But you appointed Teddy the Black heir regardless. I understood why then, but I still don't know why you left."
Waterford, Wedgwood and Royal Crown Derby were all bypassed as too modern for her needs. Narcissa wanted something unique and yet ruggedly elegant at the same time and Draco groaned as she dragged him into another store.
"My sons are perfectly well mannered, and I have no idea why you would think otherwise," Astoria teased. She pushed open the door and Draco saw that this room was decorated just like the foyer with the addition of a towering tree. Presents were heaped up under the boughs and the room smelled of cinnamon and nutmeg.
Malfoy sucked in a breath, but Harry ignored him to finish up with Hermione.
He wasn't certain what to do. He'd never minded having two families. It seemed excessive even though he enjoyed everything the holidays entailed. Travel, fun, and gifts. He knew he was… indulged..., that he had many material things that many children didn't, and he also was adored by both sides. Scorpius knew that while he might act as if it didn't matter, he knew it did. Because despite all the good, there was a downside. He'd heard the stories from not only his mother but from his father as well. The tales listened to on the sly and hidden in dark corners after the grown-ups had thought he'd gone to bed.
He was shoved out of the kitchens and into the dining room, arms full of treats, tea and his mind still on Harry.
Rose rolled her eyes. "I think I know when I am being followed, Uncle Harry."
"Merlin, George. I think your fashion sense gets worse the older you get," Harry chuckled as he was embraced by George. George's guffaws echoed in his ear and warmed Harry to the core.
Harry entered the kitchen and found Narcissa speaking with an elf he recognized. He grinned, and when Narcissa finished giving the elf instructions, he stepped forward. "Hello, Millie."
"But, I need you to listen to me, Andromeda. I need you to
“Don’t worry about it,” he said quickly. “Harry, don’t-” But Harry was already striding over to Draco’s desk, and a predatory stillness went through him as he read the letter. Draco sighed.
Draco woke up by himself, for once. He groaned softly; his head was still throbbing, albeit less so than yesterday. Draco dropped his head back onto his pillow, scrubbing at his eyes with a tired hand, and making a little noise of dismay when he saw there was still gold eyeliner on his face.
The two Slytherins started walking out of the dining hall.
“Oh.” Draco hesitated for a moment, wondering whether to keep up the lie to her as well, before sighing. Daphne’s much better at reading him for lies that Harry is, might as well tell her. It’s not like it’s an easy connection to make for anyone but Draco.
“Well done! Thank you for the demonstration.” said the teacher warmly, and a few people clapped. Harry smiled self-consciously and sat back down quickly next to Draco, who had a slightly wistful look on his face.
He could hear someone screaming, as if from far away. Someone saying his name. But his ears were buzzing and his vision was blurring and he found that he couldn’t breath and the feeling of ice changed to a burning sensation, needles were stabbing him and pain was erupting in every cell of his body and then everything went black and Harry knew nothing more.
“It’s due in two days, Harry.” sniggered Draco. Harry rolled his eyes.
“But what?”
Harry turns his head to look at him, and Draco glances over, meeting his eyes.
Draco was still in a sort of happy daze, coasting on a high. Because Harry Potter liked him, was his goddamned boyfriend. It was surreal. And amazing. And Draco was the happiest he’d ever been.
“Well legally I have to, you never took your test.” pointed out Draco with a smirk. Harry chuckled but gripped Draco’s hand firmly, their fingers curling around each other. Draco exhaled before turning on the spot and Apparating, dragging Harry with him into the compressive tunnel, the darkness, the uncomfortable sensations, until they rematerialized in the Great Hall at Hogwarts.
“Weasley wants me to help him think of a Valentine’s day gift for Hermione,” Draco said, sniggering. Harry laughed, but stopped when a more sobering thought struck him- What were they going to do for Valentine’s day? Merlin, it was like Christmas gifts all over again.
Draco gazed out of the window. Catching sight of his reflection, he sighed. In many ways he still looked the same brash, bold boy- blond hair, though he had foregone the gel- pale and aloof. But he knew he’s changed from those days. The most obvious change lay on his arm. His Dark Mark. Or what remained of it.
“I think that the second law is the most important,” announced Hermione, her arms crossed and a firm set to her jaw, obviously not expecting anyone to contradict her. Harry
Draco stared at him. "Voldemort's curse affected you. But you could have arranged an heir like we did for the Malfoy line."
"Better all around if it appeared that I had caved to their wishes. The offenders of the war appeared to be cobbled and the man that had defeated the worst dark lord in an age was 'controlled' as well."
"Do you think he will come?" Hermione asked as she stared out the window. The frost ran from her exhaled question, then spiderwebbed again at the cold coming in through the glass.
"I never asked him to take the vow!" Draco shouted. "The Wizengamot gave him a choice and that was his sacrifice!
He glanced around as they walked and shoved his hands into the pockets of his cloak. Hogwarts was a shadowy background as the snow fell around them. Thank Merlin for the magic that kept them warm and dry as they walked through town. Hogsmeade itself was still alive and open for business. People were still shopping, again despite the weather, and they hurried to and fro along the streets. The music from the two pubs boiled out into the street adding to the ambience of the season. The torches lining the walkway were snapping and hissing as they illuminated the path and pushed back the grey skies filled with flurries.
"I know! You left us though!" Draco turned away. "You left Scorpius."
Narcissa inclined her head and turned to the window, waiting with him in solidarity. He watched her watch the horizon and wondered idly how many hours she had spent like this when he was younger.
"It's wrong, though, Harry." Andromeda was getting agitated now, and Harry could see the strain it was putting on her as she tried to reason out what she had just seen, and what she had been told.
Malfoy stepped closer to Harry and Harry straightened, watching Malfoy as he leaned in. As he spoke Harry could smell the tea they drank and almost missed Malfoy's answer.
The large paned front shop window was decorated for the holiday and through the glass, she could see Potter standing over something. His arms were crossed across his chest and he was nodded at something.
Harry smiled at her. "I'm not saying."
Draco sighed, squeezing Harry's fingers. "I do, but I don't like it."
Ron scowled at Malfoy and settled down beside Hermione. "I do agree with Harry. He doesn't have children and therefore doesn't know all that's involved. He doesn't see Teddy all the time, and though while involved in Teddy's, and Rose's life, he could be considered the 'fun' uncle. It's entirely different when you are singly responsible for one person's entire life."
Narcissa cleared her throat as Granger-Weasley stepped closer to Draco, a menacing look on her face, and her fists clenched at her sides.
Hermione glared at Ron and Harry took a step back. Malfoy moved closer to him as well and Harry noticed the mug in his hand. Hermione's voice cut off any questions he was going to ask.
"He'll be here."
Something told him he would make it to even if he dawdled just now. Diagon Alley wasn't too far, and the people that would help him travel the rest of the way needed compensation. Harry always liked to settle his debts.
Harry ran a finger up the inside of the mug, flared the top out into a wide drinking lip and sat back, studying the shape of the stein. It wasn't tall enough he decided and crushed the incomplete cup back into a ball.
"Are you going to stand in the way all morning?"
Hermione dropped the skeins of yarn she'd purchased and shook her head. "So bloody scatterbrained," she muttered. "Harry put a locator on all his gift work."  Closing her eyes she laid her wand flat out on her palm and focussed on the mug. "
"Wizengamot!"
Draco Apparated to the outskirts of the Nott Estate in Salisbury. Snow dusted the grounds, but the wind was harsh and strong, blowing the snow into small hilly mounds.  Draco could smell in the breeze that more snow was on its way, and he drew his cloak about him as he started toward the manor. He walked up the short country lane and passed through the gates onto the grounds.
Hermione put her hands on her hips. "Liberated? Is there a Muggle in London I need to Obliviate? What did you do, Malfoy?"
"Together even?!?!" Hermione asked. "I can't believe this!"
The reassurances bled through the remainder of the night's horror and Draco came alive under Harry's administrations. He pulled away only to turn and meld himself to Harry's front.
Flinging out one hand, Hermione offered Arthur a slip of paper. "These are Molly's purchases. Will you take them while I look for my mug? I think I lost it somewhere. Although I was certain I stuck it in one of these bags when I finished my tea this morning."
"Daddy!"
Their clothing dropped to the floor with a plop and the heavy thud of Harry's boots came next. A hissed spell and he was manhandled into the stall.  Hot water washed over him and Draco gasped, even as Harry's hands slid over his slick skin.
Harry closed his eyes, holding Scorpius to him for several minutes before he carried Scorpius across the room and smiled. "Hello, Draco."
Though phrased as a question, Harry was certain that Narcissa expected his presence regardless. He knew it for certain when she turned on her heel and left him alone in the great room. Heart pounding, Harry followed her into the kitchen.
Narcissa sat on his sofa, one of the throw pillows that Hermione had given him to use resting on her lap and a grin on her face. Her fingers traced the scrolling letters idly as she waited.
With one more nod, Ron ushered her into the flames. The spin through the grates nauseated her, but her stomach settled as soon as Ron steadied her on the floor of the Atrium.
"I've got you," the voice murmured and a press of lips to his temple grounded Draco as much as the voice did.
"Malfoy."
"You got something for me?" Harry asked and held out his palm to the bird. The owl hopped closer and deposited the missive into Harry's hand.
Ron snorted. "I know, I just wasn't entirely ready for this to happen. Thought I had more time to prepare you. Just follow mine and Bill's lead."
Arthur blinked and shook his head. "Well, I certainly wasn't prepared for that news." He swallowed and turned to Molly. She reached out and took his hand, nodding at him. Taking a deep breath, he put down his knife and drew his wand.
Hermione rolled her eyes and stepped away when the song ended. She bowed and took his arm again when another song started. "You're being watched."
Smoke trailed out of her wand, a picture trying to form. The ghost mug appeared and coordinates spilt out. Her home in Ottery St.Catchpole, The Underground in London, Diagon Alley and Knightsbridge. The image wavered for several minutes, forming one of the entrances to Harrod's and then the coordinates jumped again.
"Come here you," Harry answered.
They started a maker's contract once she had decided on the type of dinnerware she was looking for and even the colour scheme, but until she had chosen a finished design, he couldn't even begin. He also told her to think about what it was that she wished for and she could return.
Harry watched the owl fly away, his heart pounding nearly out of his chest as his answer winged its way to Britain.
His eyes roamed over Malfoy and before he could say anything else, Malfoy's mouth was on his. He groaned, eyes still wide as he stared into Malfoy's silver gaze. He wrapped his hands in Malfoy's lapels and Apparated them to his flat.
Narcissa shops while Draco ruminates.
"Fifteen minutes, boys," Astoria warned. "Then we'll have tea as we are still waiting for one more guest."
Tom nodded and opened the door, leading Harry along the cobblestone path to the brick entrance. He tapped his wand on the bricks and stepped back, allowing Harry to venture onto the Alley.
Harry stepped aside and waved his hand for Malfoy to precede him. "Enjoy your day, Malfoy."
The scent of both the chestnuts and the mead wrapped around him and Draco nodded, watching the woman start her process again.
"More time than you've been alive," Narcissa whispered. "They always return, darling dragon, even when our esteem is low." She turned to him, her blue eyes full of motherly love, affection, and worry as well.  "Especially the ones we love."
However, the shame and the self-loathing was missing. It didn't feel like a conquest or as if he'd finally checked off a milestone. Instead, he felt content with his actions with a lingering desire to do it again if it was offered. The only remorseful thing though was that he had to leave the warmth of Harry's arms and bed. And wasn't that just a wonder?
"It's been too long," Draco whispered, his hands clutching the fabric of Harry's shirt. He forced his hands to relax, to stroke Harry's back, as Harry laughed in his arms.
"What are you doing out of bed?" Harry asked and found that Narcissa had spoken the same inquiry at the exact same time.
Potter stood over him, a snarl on his thin lips. "You deserve this." He lifted his wand once more and Draco knew it was the end.
Always perfectly coiffed and made-up, Asteria had been jealous of Narcissa until she'd taken the young witch under her wing. Guilt stabbed through Draco for a quick second at his treatment of Asteria because she had befriended his mother when most of the other ladies in their circle deferred to her status. When Asteria had left him, he'd deserved it, but his mother hadn't earned the loss of her friend.
Harry blinked as Rose continued.
"I happen to think Mr Potter looks very striking," Narcissa answered and both Draco and his father lowered the rag to stare at her. "They even managed to shoot the Girl Weasley's good side."
"And you, yours, Potter."
Ron blew out a breath and glanced down at Hermione. "He'd better make it."
"Enough to tell you that you shouldn't use Severus' spells until you are certain that there isn't a countercurse." Narcissa snapped. "How dare you!"
Welcome to Bowland Fells, Mr Potter," Narcissa drawled as Harry came to his feet.
"Sorry," He looked back down at her and grinned. "I have no idea what you mean."
Her blue eyes still betrayed her every emotion even if her face had been trained to hide them. Perhaps she could see it now after everything that had happened because it was so close to her end, but that was neither here nor there. She wanted this matter settled peacefully, correctly.
He nodded at Malfoy and the acknowledgement was returned. Malfoy arched a brow and Harry inclined his head, both of them sharing the glances until they reached the Floo hearths at the same time.
Harry took the cup and settled in a chair watching Malfoy surreptitiously as the tailors finished his robes.
"Yes," Ron answered as he shoved in another bite of porridge. "Might take him a few days but he will come."
Harry swallowed. "It is, and I thank you, Tom. She's fought long and hard."
Hermione took a deep breath, resting one hand on Ron's leg before speaking. "Rosie indicated that she would like to have the lessons as well. She was most interested in making certain Scorpius could attend, too."
Harry turned to Malfoy. "Ready?"
Hermione snorted inelegantly. "There's no need to be rude."
He set to with his chosen clay, one he'd never used before but liked the look of with its light grey tones with shades of blue. He mixed up a fresh batch of clay body adding darker hues of midnight and indigo, before placing a large ball of clay onto his wheel.
It surprised him that Potter had agreed to the walk despite the weather. Draco himself had always felt it was rude to just Apparate into someone's home or place of business and the shop was apparently both for Potter.
He continued after turning from Ron to look at both Malfoy and Hermione. "I may not be a parent, but I know what I would want from my child in this situation; their enrichment and happiness. This world is different from the one we grew up in, and if we don't want to repeat the mistakes of our parents, then we'd all best be a little more tolerant. Many things could have been different back then if we had."
"That..." Andromeda shook her head, then jumped when the door to the kitchen opened. Narcissa stood in the doorway a look of shock on her face.
It wasn't until Harry bellied up to the bar that the old barman noticed him. With an almost toothless grin, Tom barked out a laugh. "Lad! What brings you to this side of town? You need into the Alley?"
"We?"
Draco arched a brow at him. "I thought that was my job."
They stepped out on to the Alley and Harry side-eyed Malfoy. "Did you have fun?"
Hermione took a deep breath. "They'll all be there tonight, correct? Everyone in our bloc is abdicating and the new heirs are taking over for Harry."
Unrolling the parchment, Harry read the note and got an answer to his question.
"Do I want to know what you just ordered for me?" Harry inquired as he was prodded up on a stool.
"Millie will, Master Harry Potter, sir." Millie nodded. "I brings tea and biscuits now. You wish more food, Master Harry Potter?"
It wasn't until Draco picked up an oddly shaped earthenware stein that Narcissa found what she had been looking for. The mug was sensually curved at the top and the handle. The night sky colour of the mug had a depth to it that reminded Draco of late-night Astronomy Class.
And of course the simple fact that Malfoy was willingly telling them this was just… bloody insane.
“That may be a setback, true enough.” acknowledged McGonagall diplomatically, and she peered over her glasses at Draco. Her gaze is very motherly, but also very stern, noted Draco randomly. “But I do suggest that while at Beauxbatons you consider taking the Healer program. At least then you could perhaps gain some experience in a field, and decide if you like it. And I believe you would, at least, be better suited to the Healer career than the teaching one.”
“Headmistress,” piped Parvati, “So if we go on the trip we won’t be able to return for Christmas break?”
“It’s kind of true,” said Draco matter-of-factly, walking forward and turning into the corridor that would take them to the common room, not the Headmistress’s office. He heard Harry’s footsteps behind him.
“Mother. For the last time. Stop packing my things, I’m not going!” Draco Malfoy looked apprehensively at his mother, who was elegantly bustling around, packing his school trunk.
“Almost.” he said wryly. “I might come back later this week.” Draco nodded again.
It’s wonderfully quiet in the common room, and Harry slumped onto a sofa, Hermione next to him.
And Pansy, with her confident, brash, uncaring way of life. She was quite cunning, and always would happily join Draco in nagging this person or that. She was also the one he had been closest too, and confided in the most. She had understood his problems, understood him. She still did, and Draco was oddly comforted by that.
“McGonagall convinced me to take the Healer program. Daphne is too,” said Draco, now lying on his back. His blond hair was shining faintly.
“Huh. Interesting.” Draco let out a breath. “I guess I’ll go join her and the thestrals, then.”
Harry walked up to the castle with Daphne, the two of them trailing behind the other four as they tramped up the hill. After the snowball fight had ended, they’d all realized they were freezing and made the wise decision to go inside.
“Me?” repeated Draco, too surprised to add an insult. “Why?”
The knot of Healers, plus Madam Pomfrey, McGonagall, and Hermione, rejoined Ron and Draco at Harry’s bedside.
“How did I forget about that?” exclaimed Harry. “We have more fucking tests. Always the tests. The OWL testing was bad enough.”
After classes, Draco sat in his dorm, working on a particularly tricky Charms essay that was due in a few day’s time. His desk was by the window, which was nice, as it allowed a lot of light to stream in over where he was working. Harry was still out, and it was mid afternoon. The room was slightly stuffy, so Draco had the window cracked to air it out, even though it was so chilly outside now, it being early January.
“Shall we?” said Harry, and Draco huffed out a breath, watching it steam in the cold air. His hand was warm and familiar in Harry’s.
“Night, Draco.”
“Splendid job, boys.” commented Professor Athme as she passed by. “When you’ve finished, get a phial of the potion for each of you and bring it up to the front for grading.”
“This looks bloody weird.” muttered the blond, and Harry smirked. It’s not so odd for him; he knew this is kind of what you see if you use Muggle night vision goggles. Both boys then cast a standard Quidditch spell that protected their eyes from the wind.
And today… today he had to tell Potter where he’d been going, and why, mostly because they’d made an agreement but also because Draco wanted to ease the debt that he felt to Potter from last night. If not for his unexpected arrival, it would have taken far longer and been much more difficult to return to the castle after his damn ankle had busted when he’d fallen in the dark. Draco sighed at the memory. He was loath to admit it, but being carried by Potter hadn’t been...horrible. He’d felt safe. Draco cringed and faceplanted in his pillow. This was just getting sad.
“Yes, all sixth and seventh years are free to go to any nearby village on weekends, there are only about three. It is quite fun, though, you must join us sometime.” he responded.
All through the rest of dinner, Harry pondered Draco’s tattoo absentmindedly. He remembered when he’d first seen it, it had taken his breath away. He’d been so glad that Draco had liked it. And the fact that it was based on Fawkes was, in Harry’s opinion, something really special.
“Wasn’t time,” he said, sounding equal parts confused and amused. Draco clenched his jaw, suddenly aware that everyone in the Hospital Wing was watching them and maybe this was not the place for an argument.
“The floor is cold, Potter. Your plebian feet might be used to it but mine are certainly not.”
Four weeks fly by, and the weather is bitterly cold. Draco’s spending all of his time with Harry, Daphne, Camille, Simon, and Amelie, and loving every second of it.
“Sounds like her.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Draco flapped a hand. “I’ve been playing this game every Christmas since I was about eight. You won’t get it out of me.” Camille wrinkled her nose, before conceding defeat and changing the subject.
“Not a chance, Malfoy!” came Harry’s reply, and Draco rolled his eyes quickly before flying for the Snitch again.
“Shut up, Potty.” Harry grinned.
“Ready?” Simon asked, and Draco blinked.
“At your...home,” broached Hermione, her tone a bit softer now. “Why did you try to protect Harry? You knew it was him.” Malfoy let out a brittle sigh and when he lifted his head again, his eyes are haunted. Harry fought the urge to look away and relive the memories flooding his own head at the mention of that day when Hermione was tortured, and Dobby died.
“I can’t believe we’re going to France in a few hours,” he commented absentmindedly, brushing his hair out of his eyes. Harry glanced at him quickly before returning his attention to the potion.
“I’m sorry.” he murmured to her.
“You must tell us all about it,” exclaimed Hermione. She held up a napkin-wrapped package that Harry had not noticed previously. “We stopped by the Great Hall to get food so we could all go to the common room.”
The next morning they were spooning again, when Harry’s wand-alarm rang for fifteen minutes before classes started. Harry sat up, reluctant to leave the warmth of the blankets and Draco, but it wasn’t like time would wait for them.
“..Harry?”
With that McGonagall began to lead them to their new common room, but Draco trailed along behind everyone else, his mind racing with a new hope. If he could get a spot on that exchange trip… he wouldn’t have to spend as much time be goggled at and whispered about. He could live some semblance of a normal life for three whole months. In France, nonetheless.
Twenty minutes later, Harry and his friends were in a carriage, going to one of the nearby Wizarding villages. The chatter inside the small carriage was loud and excited, and that mood was starting to infect Harry as well. He didn’t want to dance, but it could still be a fun time.
A feeling of exhilaration tingled through him, and he grinned, doing a loop as he tracked the little golden ball. Harry flew up beside him, shoving him aside with a smirk.
After Draco’s trial over the summer, he had never thanked Potter for speaking for him and his mother. He supposed he should, since it was likely because he spoke that his mother only got off with a year of house arrest and Draco had gotten a summer of probation, not counting his time at Hogwarts.
“More like you wanted a chance to show off,” Blaise said dryly.
“Merry Christmas to you, too. And thanks for the Healing book and food,” Draco replied. She’d gotten him a book on Healing spells and procedures from other countries, which had been really interesting to flip through. There had been lots of remedies he’d never heard of, and part of him was itching to try brewing them or casting them.
“It’s cold outside,” protested Draco weakly.
“Don’t be sorry. It was nice.” reassured Harry, and Draco smiled, some relief woven throughout his expression, before kissing Harry again.
“Whatever,” muttered Draco, standing up, still with a pink tinge in his cheeks, and Harry tugged him down onto the chair so he was basically in Harry’s lap. “Potter!” Harry laughed.
“You’ll get it, Draco. It takes time.” Harry said, obviously knowing what Draco was frustrated at. Draco huffed but didn’t say anything. He was angry with himself for having such a hard time with the Patronus Charm, especially since their mid-year exams were in a week and he knew for a fact that Patronuses were on there.
“You sure you don’t want company?”
“Oh shut up, Harry.” Draco muttered, and Harry laughed.
It was hard to try to change how he thought about this, though. To not call people weak for showing emotions and vulnerabilities. For trusting.
“You passed out, though.” Hermione said with amusement, and Draco ignored her. He got out of the hospital bed and walked over to Harry, who stood up to meet him with a small smile.
“So how’d it go?” he asked, and Draco smiled, his face still more peaceful-looking than Harry had ever seen him.
Not knowing where else Malfoy would be, Harry resumes his wandering, trailing his hand along the stone wall, his fingers tracing every dip and imperfection. Some time later (Harry had foregone wearing Fabian Prewett’s gold watch that night, as he preferred to not know the time) Harry strolls into the courtyard and sits on the bench near the quietly babbling fountain, facing the memorial monument. Even in the shadowy lighting from the crescent moon half-covered by wispy clouds, Harry could still make out a few names.
When they entered, Harry noticed Daphne smirking at them, and when he glanced at Draco the blond was scowling at her. Harry smiled at this.
“No.”
“Always.”
“Right,” replied Harry woozily, and they finally left and strolled down to the dining hall. The whole way there, the only thing on Harry’s mind was Draco, and how soon he could kiss him again. It was driving him wild.
Draco let out another broken, quiet laugh, and drew his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them.
“Whatever. Draco’s just jealous I’ll be prettier than him at the ball.” Harry proclaimed, and the two girls sniggered while Draco raised his eyebrows.
“I forgot about that.” Harry said. Daphne snickered.
“...now we will debate. Your topic is which of Healow’s laws is most important and why! Groups of five, students! I will come around and divide you up.” Professor Flitwick hopped down from his stack of books and moved among the desks. Harry could track him by his white hair, which is all he could see of the professor as he walked to and fro across the room. “Granger, Potter, Weasley, Zabini, Malfoy!” he announced loudly when he reached them. Ron sighed and muttered something under his breath, and Harry nudged him as the two Slytherin’s make their way over to the Gryffindors. Malfoy perched on an empty desk next to Harry, and Zabini stood next to him.
“Weirdly enough, yes. I mean, he’s Malfoy, but it’s nice talking to someone who’s...” she struggled for the right word.
He still needed to ask Draco about the contents of that book they were supposed to read. Hopefully nothing too complicated.
“Sometimes I need to get away. From everyone. It’s like-it’s like a floodgate bursts inside my head, and everything comes… comes back…” his voice trailed off and he turned his head away again. Harry feels a surge of empathy for Draco, because he knew the exact feelings that the blond was trying to describe.
“Er, yeah. How many programs do they offer here?” asked Harry.
“No, I see what you mean. I like it.” Harry lay back in the grass, and Draco almost had to force his eyes away from Harry. “Is this where you come when you leave?”
“Are we dating?” asked Harry suddenly. Draco blinked.
“Well,” said Draco, biting into his roll. “I got Blaise another glass sculpture, you know he has that collection.” Daphne nodded, her eyes wide and expectant, and Draco exchanged an amused glance with Harry. “And I got Camille that sweater she was going on about, Simon some broom wax and one of those poem books he likes, I got Pansy a fancy bracelet. A scarf and a box of chocolates for my mother, a pair of Keeper’s gloves for Weasley, a book on Arithmancy and a distiller for Hermione.” Draco went on, finishing his bread. He left out Daphne’s and Harry’s, obviously.
Hermione had told him and Ron about her time with Malfoy and Daphne in the library, about how she had explained astronauts and airplanes to him. She’d had to backtrack and actually explain them to Ron, who demanded to know, before he muttered that Malfoy was turning into his dad. Harry had chuckled, knowing Arthur Weasley would’ve been just as enthusiastic as Hermione had described Malfoy to be, although Ron’s dad already knew about airplanes and probably astronauts as well.
Draco snickered. “That’s almost worse than my story.” The pair talk for a little while longer over breakfast, before leaving when people begin to enter in full force.
“Draco speaks French,” announced Camille from next to him, as she spooned some sort of soup into her bowl.
“Fine,” he hissed, and settled into bed, shutting his eyes. He heard Harry do the same across the room. For once Draco’s head cleared of worries, and he focused on the sounds of the rain beating on the roof, finally letting the noise lull him into sleep.
“I was talking to myself, if you must know.” retorted the blond, but his voice was a bit high, as Harry noticed it always was when Draco was embarrassed. Harry looked at him curiously before turning back around. Draco had done this a few times before, speaking in French in a quiet voice when he thought Harry couldn’t hear him. It was curious. Maybe it was worth learning French, thought Harry, just to know what Draco said to himself that he apparently didn’t want Harry to hear.
Andromeda watched her sister return to the room and she fought a grin at the sight of Narcissa's stiff posture when she settled in the chair beside Andromeda's bed. She had forgotten how easy it was to read her sister when she was distraught, and Cissa was most certain in distress at being the last one of the Blacks. She was the baby of the family, had been indulged on many levels, and yet after all that had happened, Andromeda could still see the little blonde child Narcissa had been before society life had made her cold and distant.
Written for 25 days of Draco and Harry 2020 for the Slythindor100 community on DW. I know it's after Christmas, but I'm intent on finishing this.
"Finish the rustic ornamentation in this room and Draco's study. Match it to Lucius, only in blue. And I want Scorpius' room done in a winter Toyland motif. Make it fun and bright, and be certain to charm the decorations safe."
"You aren't leaving," Andromeda wheezed. "I'm doing better, really."
Draco hummed and looked away from her all-too knowing gaze. The silence folded around them once more but it was infused with fondness and sympathy that embraced him warmly.
"Draco." Harry leaned in and captured Draco's mouth.
Malfoy hummed. "All right." He held out his palm to Harry.
Harry nodded. "All three. Hermione, Astoria, and Narcissa all sacrificed for me. I couldn't stay away any longer."
It was nice to just talk with Scorpius yesterday. She hadn't lied to her parents that he was different. She did like him. Scorpius was smart and funny, he had a dry sense of humour and was a bit sarcastic like she was. Plus it didn't hurt that he was pretty like his father. He acted differently when they were together than when he was with Nott or even when her crazy cousin Teddy was about. She needed to have a word with him about Scorpius. She was surprised he'd accepted her invitation to meet for breakfast this morning.
"I don't want to take you away from the shop. You are extremely busy."
Draco stiffened. "No."
Harry reached between them, cradling his cock and slowly stroking.
Prompts:
Draco stopped eating long enough to swallow and looked at Lucius. He straightened in his chair and nodded. "Yes. These cookies have eggs, flour, and milk in them, among other ingredients, Father. All valid components in a complete breakfast."
Checking his watch, Harry hurried down the street, making a beeline for the Leaky Cauldron. The pub was crammed with witches and wizards, drinking warm mugs to combat the cold. He entered and stood in the darkened foyer, just taking in the scenery. It had been some time since he'd graced Tom's pub with his presence, and just as Dumbledore's spell promised, not one person noticed him standing there in plain sight.
Harry watched Narcissa move closer to Andromeda, and turned his head to give them a measure of privacy when she stopped and rested her hand on her sister's cheek. He watched surreptitiously as Andromeda smiled at Narcissa. They had a whispered conversation together with Andromeda nodding at Narcissa several times. Andromeda returned the pat to Narcissa's cheek, and Narcissa turned to give him a once-over before she completely left the room.
Harry nodded and then showed her the Nutcracker. "I'm not letting you keep this yet, but you always ask for one.  I need to know what colours you
Chaos reigned as Harry and Draco stood staring at one another. It wasn't until Astoria and Theo both took a child, and with the promise of ice cream, managed to leave Harry and Draco alone.
"Potter," Malfoy called.
"A Muggle at a Wizard wedding. It figures it would involve the Weasleys and Potter."
The platinum locks just begged to be mussed and Harry had the urge to reach out and see if it was as soft as it looked.
Draco hummed and slowed his hips, arching hard into Harry. "Wait," he breathed. "Wait for me."
Draco spoke first, shattering the comfortable silence. "You look like hell," he murmured and Harry smirked at him.
Harry snorted. "I am well aware of that fact, and both Narcissa and Andromeda made it painfully clear that my reasons were full of shite."
Andromeda snorted and looked at her sister. "I think you'll find that Harry will surprise you."
Narcissa and Lucius stared at Draco as he walked away.
The tailor grinned and nodded. "We can provide anything you like, Mr Potter."
His mother had already cut a swath through Diagon Alley and found nothing that struck her fancy. A decision to change the dinnerware for her annual Christmas Soiree had brought them to the largest store in London. Draco was certain the world would end if she didn't find anything here to her liking.
"Goodbye, Dragon."
Prompt #4
Narcissa nodded. "I shall inquire about his day. I'm feeling the urge to visit Hogsmeade."
Huffing, Granger-Weasley nodded. "Let's go then. Harry's shop isn't far from here." She stomped past and Narcissa smirked as she dragged Draco along with her. His arm was tugged away from her fingers as he stumbled to keep up with her.
He was just as indulged as Draco, the first most bright spot in her life had been, but somehow, he was also a more sombre child. Narcissa was certain this was due to Asteria. Before she departed from the Wiltshire estate, Scorpius' mother had taught her son well, and while he had always been a pampered little lord, Asteria had made certain that he wasn't spoiled. He was budding into a handsome, intelligent, with a sharp, dry sense of humour young man. A healthy bit of trenchancy, like most teenagers, but entirely well-mannered. And she wasn't biased. At. All.
They turned to him as a collective, agog expressions on everyone's faces.
He sank a little further into despair and tried to claw his way out. He rubbed the scar's thin line, the hurt blossoming on his skin and his mind succumbed to the Night Mare despite the agony. The descent reminding him he was alone. Of his past and his failures. Lessons from the Dark Lord. A Cruciatus for his lack of progress. Doubling down the fact that Potter, that Harry had been more of a wizard than he ever would be to have the gonads to use Dark Magic inside of Hogwarts. That sacred space of Dumbledore's domain, and his Golden Child that, no matter how hard anyone tried… Would. Not. Die.
Harry writhed under the attention, crossing his ankles over Draco's hips as Draco thrust forward. He stilled, closing his eyes and allowing both of them to adjust before moving slow and easy. Back and forth, they moved as one, the firelight throwing their shadows upon the wall.
"I'm glad to hear it," Harry answered. "You'll give Astoria and Scorpius my greetings."
"Draco!" Narcissa's voice was barely elevated but it resounded in the room.
"What's happening?" Hermione asked, her hand making nervous circles on her stomach.
Draco held the mug to his chest. "London and I liberated it fair and square from the sales clerk."
Hands roamed over clothing, loosening buttons and threading through the fabric to get at one another's skin.
"I don't think it's much of anything, Ron, other than two
Dropping the towel to the floor after running it over his skin, Harry dressed in a pair of joggers and padded back downstairs. Mind still on Draco, he sat at his wheel and he reached for a clay body. With a flick of his wand, he called up some music and then started spinning. His fingers delved into the mud and he got lost in the clay.
Draco shrugged and placed the plate on the table. "Where is Mother this morning?"
Prompts #9
"It is convenient that I can think of many uses for you, Potter."
Lucius waved his wand and rounds of snow jumped up from the ground, stacking themselves in a pyramid while Scorpius cheered. In a moment, there was a flurry of activity as the snowballs started flying, a miniature war raged across the pristine snow between two house elves and her son.
"Regardless." Astoria waved at Draco and moved to stand next to him, watching Scorpius with Lucius as he played outside. "Your father has no qualms with Scorpius' play."
The little tinkling bell caused the men working on Malfoy to look up. Malfoy stared at him, and Harry stared right back.
is not the Black heir, and you can't think that Lucius would approve the suppression of his his heir for love or money. Besides, I would not betray Harry's sacrifice after what your son did to him."
, #10:
"I'm afraid she popped over to the Lovegoods. Xenophilius was feeling under the weather and she took him some tea and soup."
"You don't trust yourself," Draco murmured. "But I believe you can do this. Now, start again. March your feet."
Draco took a step away, let go of Harry, and slid gracefully backwards from him. "And glide to me. Like swimming."
Potter shook his head as the witch handed Draco his bag and mead. "Thanks, Rhiamon. I'll have your new cauldron ready by the end of the week." He tossed the witch a couple of Galleons.
Harry meets with Draco
Kreacher sneered. "Kreacher is not an owl, but Kreacher does as bid." He vanished with a pop and returned almost immediately.
Draco stiffened and moved away from her. "It is not my fault, and I would like you to leave this subject matter where it belongs." He gave her a look, and Astoria arched a brow at him. "In the past."
"Wait until I say," Draco uttered and nipped Harry's earlobe.
have as I have lost track." He ran a hand over the back of his head. "Also, you have to act surprised as it's supposed to be a secret."
Draco stared at Potter. "For?"
Harry shook his head, even though he felt a naughty thrill shiver through him at the thought of overriding Narcissa's tea desires. "I'm certain whatever Narcissa ordered will be fine."
Harry whispered and their skates hit the floor with a thud. "Thank Merlin! I think I broke something."
Swallowing the knot in his throat, Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could still feel the bird watching him and with a sigh, he turned and walked into the house. Taking a quill from off his desk, he turned the note over and gave his response.
Andromeda closed her eyes, knowing that even though this battle might have been won, the war was far from over.
Malfoy followed him as he stepped through the back door and into the entrance area of Diagon Alley.
His fingers prodded the scar, and Draco hissed. He looked at his fingers and blood appeared. He tried to will it away and closed his eyes against the sight and the pain. Then he embraced it. Pain was real. It showed you that you were alive, and Draco dug his fingers into his chest, screaming at the intensity.
"You know you could go ask him to dance."
Scorpius glared at him. "Fine, I'll go without you then." He stomped toward the door of their dorm room
Kreacher made a face at Harry. "Yes, Master Harry. Is your business finished?"
Astoria closed her eyes. "Do not shout at me, Draco. I know you didn't make the decision, but you of all people should have known the old magics would allow nothing less."
Andromeda looked at her and shook her head. "As much as Teddy adores Draco, I am afraid that I can't."
His father joined Snape and both shook their heads.
Harry held up a hand. "Actually I do. Mind, that is. This is the children's time away from both the school and their parents. They don't need either one of you standing guard. If you can't trust me to keep peace in my own shop, then I'll cancel the lessons altogether."
Harry followed Tom through the back of the pub and into the snug just before the entrance to Diagon Alley. ALone, Harry held up his bags and TOm's gnarled hand waved a crooked wand over the purchases.
"How could you?" She whispered, staring at Harry. "He was... you were ..."
"Mother was very upset when she wrote. I apologize for her forwardness," Draco offered, and Harry shook his head.
"Thank you, Harry, and Cheers!" Rhiamon replied and started another batch of nuts for the people next in line.
"I can still do magic, and only a select few people know this."
"Andromeda sent word that we are to plan your reintroduction into society, Harry, and prepare for the transition of titles when she passes. Kingsley has made plans to announce you as Regent for the Family Black tomorrow."
Harry snorted and raised enough to look down at Draco. "Ron can bite my arse."
Narciss and Lucius were on good but slightly stilted terms with Asteria, but it pained them to watch Draco toss what had been a decent match away. Lucius never begrudged Draco anything, but Narcissa knew his tolerance for Draco's antics and attitude was wearing thin.
Draco had seen him fly in all types of conditions and yet when Granger-Weasley had suggested this as a couples evening out together, he was leery. When she compared it to the Muggle version of flying, Harry agreed wholeheartedly.
"I hope you are correct," she murmured as she watched them play.
Narcissa' gaze snapped to Andromeda's face, and she tried to ignore the shock and pity of what Narcissa saw in them. Firming her mouth, she forced Narcissa to face the past. "She is labouring under her condition, made all the more difficult due to our family's actions. You will not cause another tragedy to befall this holiday."
Draco chuckled. "You told them."
"It was too much," Draco said, resigned to the ever losing argument with Harry that it had been his choice to sacrifice his life for everyone else's freedom.
As he sipped, he recalled other seasons at the manor, happy times and sad times. Memories that swam with emotion both cheerful and desolate. Heartbeat speeding, he reminisced about laughter with his friends, those present and some only memories. His father's firm but guiding hand and being coddled ever so lovingly in the lightly scented embrace of his mother.
"You made it," Astoria called to him, and Draco looked up to see her standing at the top of the staircase.
Exhausted and breathless, Draco clung to Harry even as Harry held tightly to him. More murmured spells dried them and Draco was ensconced in Harry's warmth once more as the taste of Dreamless Sleep slid across his tongue. The scent of fresh linens penetrated his conscious, and twining their fingers, Draco snuggled into Harry's arms and sighed.
Harry turned and walked back to his shop, thinking on how much of his backlist he would get to today. He opened the door to his shop and flicked his wand at the kiln, then began adding to the Christmas display in the front window.
Leaning against him more heavily, she smirked. "I can always use a porter when I go shopping."
"But I don't understand. Why? Why was it announced that you were magicless?"
Draco shook his head and drank deeply from the mulled wine. The cinnamon and alcohol mixed with the raw honey smelled wonderful. The entire drink was soothing and helped to calm him. Theo's cooler head had prevailed when all Draco had wanted was to rail against the injustices.
Inside the chamber, Hermione could see black and grey robed members settling in their seating area. Kingsley smiled at her as Ron and Hermione passed through the door. Bill stepped forward offering his hand to aid Hermione as she and Ron entered the cordoned off area.
Across the room, Hermione saw Astoria and Theodore Nott enter their box, little Theo with them, all three dressed similarly with a cinnabar strip for their Family. Astoria lifted her hand and gave a slight wave. She inclined her head, and Hermione followed the signal to the Malfoy box.
Harry reached back to the shelf and withdrew two mugs, and an unfired Nutcracker. "I'll be right back."
Harry smiled. "I know."
Rose shook her head. "No, it's a person and I am certain I can handle them myself; however, could you help out with my dad?"
Hermione smiled up at him and squeezed his palm.
Astoria placed her hand on Draco's shoulder. "You didn't stop him either."
And yet here he stands, and Potter is even
“You are both losers. Can we get back to the flowers Draco didn’t hate now?” Pansy might be a good friend who doesn’t force Draco to talk about his feelings when he honestly isn’t ready for that, but that doesn’t mean she won’t press every tiny detail that doesn’t concern their fight out of him. If mushy memories of flowers are all she is going to get, she wants that — in full.
“We saw enough fighting, don’t you think?” Draco tries again, desperation growing with every second that Potter looks at him with doubt in his eyes.
“What do you need to —” Draco doesn’t let him finish the sentence, he knows what to do now.
Draco, very subtly, moves closer to watch his reaction. He isn’t disappointed: Potter realises that yes, biscuits fresh out of the oven are too hot and no, it’s not socially accepted to spit them back out and you have to live in that misery, hell dancing on your tongue and a thousand cackling devils flicking their whips. Once Potter got over
Well, this is embarrassing. Harry walks backwards and hopes Draco left the door open, because his brain is still baffled at his disappearance and, frankly, Harry isn’t quite certain for how long he walked before he realised, or into which side of the corridor Draco slipped away.
That’s it, that's as much invasion of privacy as Draco can take thrust upon him without warning.
like the sort to go
? Draco didn’t even use lemon juice, how could Harry need to adjust that one? Perhaps that is the problem, perhaps he should have used it. Blaise didn’t say anything of the sort, but Draco did stray pretty far from his recipe. Well, Draco decides that if Harry wants to add lemon juice to his food, that isn’t his problem. Harry isn’t a master chef either, he doesn’t get to decide how things have to taste. Just to be petty, Draco takes a bit of his own food, untouched since the moment he set it on the table, eyes locked on Harry’s.
). Point is, he missed these idiots and staging a fake marriage is the best idea Harry ever had.
“Keep your voice down, my head hurts.” Draco wonders if Potter has anything against the impending headache, a potion or even just something to cool the swelling. Draco feels like an Erumpent stomped on him and really, that isn’t an experience he needed in his life.
“Okay, come on, we’ll sort this out.” Then Harry pulls Draco up — when had he fallen to the floor? — and the situation doesn’t look too bleak anymore.
“I have every idea what it feels like to be shunned, I’ll have you know.” Draco hears and hates how cold his voice has gotten, his own way of stealing the sun, but there is very little he can do about that. It’s a sensitive topic, one Potter needs to understand quickly Draco isn’t prepared to be indulgent and forgiving on. “You might remember that people weren’t the kindest to Ex Death Eaters during the trials, that they wanted to see us all dead, souls given to the Dementors as a last meal. I know exactly what I’m talking about.”
, who is practically infamous for needing only five minutes to convince Draco to spit out whatever it is others have been pestering him about for hours. Okay, that’s not true — Theo does need longer than that, and he picks his battles wisely, but it’s still rather more impressive than Millicent, who simply resorts to throwing things at Draco. It never got him to talk, but in recent years, that has become more of an excuse to be rude, anyway.
Draco sinks against the cool wall, rests his aching head against it and thinks that it’s not as comfortable as Potter, not in a long shot, but that it will have to do. At least until Draco can open his eyes again and hunt the bastard down. He stays there, the cool seeping into his brain and settling over his skin, everything slowing down as he waits for Potter to return.
The dwarfs are gathered in what might be a living room but really doesn’t need a proper name right now, standing in a circle around something laying on the floor. Draco, because he is curious and rude, shoves everyone aside to better see.
It’s slimy and gross and invasive, moving around in his mouth like a slug, wresting for space and pushing in deeper and Potter is everywhere, his hands crushing Draco’s waist and teeth at his lips and it hurts, everything hurts, and Draco doesn’t want this at all, he wants Potter to — Draco pushes before he can reason with his instincts, can find a way to endure and pray it’s over soon. Everything in him screams that it’s too much, too close and Potter doesn’t stop and Draco cannot breathe — so Draco pushes him away, with all the terrified force he can muster.
The lone good news is that Granger doesn’t bite his head off the moment he is close enough for it to be possible. Draco clings to that, convinces himself it means he has her blessing and not that she waits for Weasley, as the harmed party, to do the honours.
Harry could theoretically steal Dean away from where he is sitting pressed next to Seamus, and nudge him to go talk to Draco. Only that it probably wouldn’t do them any good, because Dean can be painfully shy when meeting new people — and as already established, this counts as meeting Draco anew — and the last thing Harry needs right now is
Draco opens to him, surrenders all that he is to Potter’s prodding tongue and his questing hands. They are good hands, Potter’s, and Draco melts into them, held up by nothing but Potter’s desire, by his hands hands running over his ribs and gripping his arse, his tongue licking into Draco’s mouth, seeking the taste of himself, the proof of ownership, of possession. Because Draco is his, wholly and completely.
that Malfoy would give all his attention and time to something else and then come back and not be as irked by the disgusting slime as he should be. All the pains and efforts Harry went to, inviting the house full of people and pausing the movie specifically for him — and Malfoy can’t even be bothered to fake a little conviction when he attempts to throw them out? No insults, only a pathetic whiff of derision — Malfoy surely could to better than this.
He doesn’t think he wants to know. Ignorance is bliss, that is what they say, and Harry might have always thought that saying a bit lacking and oversimplified (what you don’t know can still make your life miserable, wars have a way of driving that point home) but here he is inclined to agree with it.
to tell her this. It seems this is a conversation for him to have with Potter, not his friends. He appreciates what Granger is doing, that she looks out for Potter, resolved not to let him get hurt, but he doesn’t want to talk her before he talked to Potter. The best Draco can offer is silence, letting her study him and see what she will, draw her own conclusions.
what Draco expected. Is this a good sign? Weasley is fond of chess, is he not?
“Of course not, I'm just saying that things are more complicated than your conclusions allow.” Finally, Ron shows signs of life behind the placid smiling. Good, it was unnerving. Harry immediately feels better for seeing it. “You said you asked for his consent, tried your best to make sure he was comfortable? That’s all anyone can do, Harry. It’s not your fault that Malfoy lied to you.”
Malfoy
“Rest assured mother, we shall soon restore it to its former glory.” His mother smiles at him, and though it is a brittle thing, Draco is glad to see it.
, fought for and rescued and condensed to the essentials.
“No, you don’t actually. Hufflepuffs are great people, I
It’s a lie. Draco is pretty sure he’d want Potter in his life any way he can get him, even if it’s painful and self-destructive. Which—just for the record—it wasn’t. Being Potter’s friend was wonderful and guaranteed to only get better, once Potter acknowledged that they were, indeed, friends. Draco would take Potter in all his broken pieces and he wouldn’t mind if he cut himself on them and yes, he is aware that is a problem and probably not healthy and very much against the Slytherin code of self-preservation, but what good is life without love?
Malfoy flails a little as Harry pulls his hands back abruptly, but he is surprisingly strong and doesn’t immediately fall onto his arse (pity, Harry could have teased him forever over that) latching on to Harry of his own accord. Which is unexpected, even considering the deathly threat of the dangerous ferret. Then Malfoy seems to remember himself and he gingerly climbs down, setting his feet back on the floor as if waiting for it to snap at him. Of course that doesn’t happen, not to precious pure-blood feet.
“This is not—what are you doing?” Draco forgets what he wanted to say, starring in horror at Weasley and Granger, who wasted no time finding the nearest tree to lean against, pressing awfully close against each other.
(He might have thought about this kind of a lot, badgered Ron into explaining the intricacies of pure-blood flower language—different from

any rescuing, far from a knight in shining armour.
Right, Pansy is still clutching the squirming ferret. Draco supposes he can forgive Weasley for being stunned by that, she is a fearsome thing to behold even when she is not actively trying to stop humanity's cruelty, and Weasley likely never saw her so much as glance at an animal. Those self-righteous Gryffindors can be wonderfully prejudiced; they don’t even notice. Weasley, in his impeccable timing, arrived to see Pansy at her brightest, most willing to behead someone to get her point across.
). If his friends weren't just waiting for Draco to back out and tease him about it, he would have been gone before he set two feet into the room. Instead, Draco sits at the table, glares at the rose petal swimming in his champagne (an accident? Surely, it cannot be a sign of affection, not something this impractical and aesthetically unappealing) and waits for Potter to dish out what he prepared.
“How do you know my name?” Potter asks, producing a heavy iron pan out of nowhere and holding it high, a threat to push Draco towards answers more to his liking.
“I’m not judging. I’m telling you the truth you refuse to see.” If Draco were judging, Potter would know.
reluctant. Marrying Potter isn’t exactly a burden—good for the tarnished reputation—and almost feasible, if it weren’t for that tiny, mortifying crush Draco used to have on the git.
That is the other thing, Seamus can’t be trusted with new people either. He is loud and boisterous, intimidatingly determined to make friends — he would scare Draco away and Harry would never see him again.
What matters is Potter laying next to him, laughing in the warm light and curling into Draco, his body warm and hands brave as they wander over Draco, seeking for purchase and clinging tight once they found it, wrapped around Draco’s waist and wound in his hair.
They can still share silence, barely a bit more strained than they would have been before. They sit on the couch together, and Draco is lost in his plans (which they also argue about, just as they always have) or with his nose stuck in a book, comfortable enough with Harry’s presence to relax next to him, and even lean into him, at times.
They were attacked the moment they landed, Harry prepared and Draco distracted. If Draco had paid attention, if had he

There is no name for what lurks, for there is none one who survived what they witnessed.
Sometimes, he wonders if it would be different if he didn’t have a prophecy pushing him on paths he had no time to question, but, in the end, Harry doesn’t think it would have made much of a difference. His fights might have looked different, other foes to beat, but even in an ideal world where his parents never died, Harry is confident he would have found trouble to get into (only aided by the fact that his parents, too, were fighters — looked at like that, there was never anything else Harry could have been, continuing a proud tradition).

He would even be more than content to do that — he always loved the thrill of the chase, golden Snatches or snobbish pricks — if it weren’t for Grimmauld. Grimmauld, who apparently still judges Harry unworthy of living inside it’s walls. Seriously, if this house doesn’t end its tantrum soon, Harry is going to call an exorcist or something.

Faced with Ron's blue eyes piercing through him, it seems a lot easier to let him think Harry is finally cracked and doesn’t remember where the doors in his house are than reveal that and he and Malfoy didn’t get over their
Initially, Harry was relieved to read that, glad that he was right about one thing and that they could talk about it, and Draco could explain what is still very much an absurd idea to Harry, but that hope was disappointed a few words later. Draco is even more confused than Harry as to what exactly that means for him.
“Wait, further?” Draco feels slightly bad for breaking their moment—a moment of affection that did not want to be broken, unlike the one between Granger and himself—but the words are out before he can stop them.
Then Potter blushes and Draco thanks Mary for refusing to supply him with a carnivorous plant, because he doesn’t want to miss this sight for anything on earth.
What he didn’t understand, wishes sometimes he never figured out, is that his mother saw her own future in Walburga’s fate. In her aunt, his mother had a barely living vision of who she could one day become, twisted by the loss of her family and mind shattered by the pain until nothing remained but blind hatred. She must have found a sombre comfort in being there for Walburga, in proving that things might be a little better if only she has someone generous and kind left to keep her company.
room.” Pretty convincing point, right? Not for Draco though. No, for Draco things don’t necessarily need to make sense if they are suitably dramatic to make up for the lack of logic.
B) Granger might not be able to talk. She is a horse, after all, and though Potter played fast and loose with the rules of reality, this doesn’t seem to be one of the exceptions. Well, except for her wings, but Draco is pretty sure they belong with the movie.

“Okay, so, that was ugly. And then Potter threw you out?” Pansy asks, breaking the silence that settled in after Draco told her about the fight. Well, a heavily edited version of it; Draco doesn’t tell her how this could have been avoided if he had kept his mouth shut and born it, if he had just kept on doing what he had perfected over the months. He didn’t tell her that it’s his fault, that he is still broken.
Kissing Potter is odd. It’s not what Draco was led to believe, rather more awkward than anything else. Potter’s lips are chapped under his, warm and impassive and they both just … stand there. Draco because he doesn't know what the next step is and Potter presumably because he is still in shock at Draco’s show of initiative. Well, whatever it is, it’s quite passable. He should be more relieved, perhaps, that this isn’t half as bad as he feared it would be, but Draco is more disappointed than relieved. At least, he
It doesn’t.
Draco would like to think that he is capable of learning from past mistakes. For example, should there be another uprising of questionable morals and dark magic, promising a new world order with only the most loyal of followers in comfortable positions, well, Draco would

“As you will,” Potter says, and then something knocks into Draco and smashes him against a wall. Draco is out immediately.
Draco doesn’t feel much surer that Harry won’t wake up in a year and decide that there is something missing, but he doesn’t feel like arguing about it anymore, not when he could easily fall asleep right where he is. Harry might not stay forever, but he is here now, his heartbeat steady and strong, his hands gentle along the knobs of Draco’s spine — what good does worrying about the future do?
“Yes, I wouldn’t die for the world, Potter, only for you.” Potter is more important than the world, but he thankfully doesn’t say that. He has done a good job of keeping this moment light, of not letting Potter know there were worlds building and dying within him, that one wrong word could have pushed him into eternal misery—he has no intention on ruining that with leaning too far into the other direction.
, as if that should mean anything to Draco).
Right, they will start on the living room next. That is fine. It’s good, even. Draco is sorely missing some bookshelves.
It also, and this is the most important part, has one of its ugly paws clenched around Potter.
Draco isn’t shocked awake, doesn’t jump up and demands Harry take it back, that they are still Potter and Malfoy and Harry should probably go back to his own bed now, anyway.
It’s must be a side effect from the stress, worry wearing her thin so that it doesn’t take much to crack her up, making her react more violently in both directions, good and bad. She could have just as easily burst into tears, Draco supposes. He is glad it’s laughter instead. (Weasley would have never forgiven him if he made Granger cry.)
, the answer
“What?” Harry asks, somewhat dumbfounded, and Malfoy predictably doesn’t answer. “Malfoy, what are you talking about?”
He thinks of Potter breaking his nose and making it worse in the name of healing him, of the way Draco couldn’t even be angry with him.

"No. Get out of my shop." Potter pushes up the goggles to better glare at him, destroying the wide-eyed deer look but not making him any less handsome, though more familiar. This is the Potter Draco remembers, angry and scowling at him, rude, a colossal arse who thinks himself so much better than anyone else. That helps with Draco’s rampant drooling over the man, a little bit.
as in a shared room and — more importantly — bed. Before Potter could have a meltdown over that Draco had long since handled the situation and redirected the man, but since then Potter had watched on in creepily silent murderous rage. Very distracting, but Draco refuses to be intimidated. Grimmauld is his house now, as it always should have been, and Potter better recognise his reign is over.
“Right.” Potter nods, like he might finally see reason and name the poor thing something permanent. “See, that is one more reason

“There is absolutely no reason to worry, I never expected to marry for love. No grand hopes disappointed here.” That’s a lie, but unless his mother read his diary — which Draco suspects but could never confirm; it seems like a grave breach in ethics and privacy, but his mother also always
helpful that is, Harry only realises once he stands inside the closest bakery, staring at the sheer endless options of all kinds of things Harry couldn’t name if there was a gun to his head, the baker not even bothering to hide their impatience and the line grumbling behind him. Something nice, Draco said, and Harry thinks bitterly that he couldn’t have been more vague if he tried. Why bother saying anything at all if what you do say is — oh!
“I thought I made you up, that you couldn’t possibly be real,” Potter whispers, like it’s a confession.

he said.
“I’m not — yes, yes there was! Why didn’t you tell me you invited her?” That is the crux of it, what bothers Harry the most. He thinks he could have dealt with Parkinson just fine, had he only known she would be here. He could have prepared to be smirked at and treated with appalling condescension, could perhaps even have made his peace with the flirting he will be subjected to, but Harry never got the chance. Because Draco didn't think it necessary to tell him.

. He much preferred playing with Blaise, both of them loose on the rules of the game but very invested in the welfare of their little figurines, swearing eternal war over one hurt pawn, let alone an impeached queen. Draco sighs; he should have asked Blaise.
“He was very rude about it,” Draco says, because he doesn’t want to think about the pain he caused Potter. “He said some very nasty things and I…”
Instead he focuses on the touches that actually were, the pushing and shoving and jostling, the glares impressive enough to rival literal knives. That one extraordinary time Potter took Draco’s hand to save him.
(Probably.)
Finally, Draco thinks them safe. For now, at least. They’ll have to find a more permanent solution later. It will be fine. If Draco knows anything, it’s gossip; he can deal with this.
Well,
“I —” Draco can’t. Resolving that he is freed from his family responsibility of being imperious and unmoved is all well and good, fantastic, but it doesn't erase the instincts instilled into him, doesn't make his first reaction any more favourable.
(Don’t tell anyone
Whatever it is he has to say, Draco will need something to hold on to, something for moral support and to do with his hands while Potter tests his nerves. Something already in the room because Draco can’t leave unless he wants to prompt Potter to vomit his thoughts out in the first words he can think of, something inconspicuous and solid and — his eyes land on the fruit basket sitting on the coffee table. Specifically on the apples, shiny and green, sitting next to various other fruits. Perfect.
fighting for true love and Theo can smell lies you haven’t even told yet—Draco says no, tells him his feelings are neither that strong, nor is it this time sensitive.
It would be simple to say something, to ask Draco to sit down for an hour or two and very calmly, very rationally, talk about what exactly happened between them, how Draco feels about it. Simple, yes, but not easy. And, even in all its glorious simplicity, it could destroy the last thing remaining to them. What if Harry asking scares Draco off? Harry would be left here, without Draco, and none of the answers. Losing Draco again is not a risk Harry is willing to take.
“Why did I have to hear from
I don’t know how this happened.
Draco makes a conscious effort to soften himself, his voice and his attitude, to move past the wrongs done against him. This is the point he wanted to make, and he can’t afford to be abrasive with it.
Even more interesting than how Draco got here, is why he would want to be here in the first place. He didn’t look like he would want to come out from behind Parkinson any time soon.
Put like that, Draco thinks it can’t be too hard. It might be fun even —
“Harry,” Draco makes sure that his voice is serious, grave, and Harry immediately stops laughing, looking up at him with his impossibly green eyes. It’s a good thing Draco has Capt'n to worry about, or he would have gotten lost in those eyes. “Are you laying on Capt'n?”

, and he was too scared to ask his friends, but some of the things Parkinson talked of must have been true. Things concerning Ron, specifically, like the claim that he acted as mediator between Parkinson and Hermione. That, too, Harry can believe all too easily. He just doesn’t see why Hermione would ever want to talk to Parkinson after a fight bad enough Ron needed to stop it.
would be disappointed.
another sitting room (to be personalised later, maybe he’ll pick up a hobby that needs extra dedication of space). But what else is Draco supposed to do — give Potter anything he wants and prove himself a weak push-over?
They both lay there, huddled into their respective blankets, Harry’s fingers half-tangled in Malfoy’s hair and half stroking his face, gazing into each others eyes without either of them saying a word. It’s not an uncomfortable silence, not as such. It’s not even awkward, doesn’t make Harry itch to move and press an answer out of Malfoy like he would have bet it would, had he been asked prior to this weird night, where nothing seems to be as it should. The silence feels almost pleasant, something gently building between them, taking all the time in the world as they just … lay there.
“Fine, keep your rat’s nest,” Draco says, putting all his effort in sound calm and reassuring. He still doesn’t do calm and reassuring very well, not even when determined to be respectful. Perhaps he should practice that? Potter seems to need a lot of it.

manners.
Potter, who likely will be asleep, too. (Draco doesn’t think about that, doesn’t think about what he will do when he finds him, how he might frantically shake at him to try and wake him, a quest doomed to fail but what else is there?)
“It’s Capt'n.” Draco says, because the silence is getting a little too comfortable, and Draco could stay like this for far longer than he dares to admit, even to himself.
“None,” he says, which kind of shuts the conversation down. Bad etiquette, that. Someone should have taught Potter better manners. A quick glance up confirms that he is smiling, though, which is a good sign. Draco will take all the good signs and hoard them for bad days.
“I’m pretty sure that it was
“What, Harry Potter has nothing to say? I didn’t think the day would come.” Draco tries for teasing, increasingly uncomfortable on this strange lake. This cannot be how the movie goes, is it?
He remembers Potter’s surprise at seeing Draco, remembers how he didn’t trust Draco to be real, that he would be here to do what he asked and save him.
Draco doesn’t know what this is, if there is danger lurking where he can’t see, but he is awfully sure he is a fox, too. He already did one weird movie (two, if you count the dwarfs)—does he really have to do another one? No, absolutely not, Draco refuses.
Then Harry sinks down on one knee, and all the answers and comments Draco might have had go flying out of his mind.
Starting the coffee doesn’t usually take all that long. Harry stretched out the process as much as possible, but in the end they sit civilised at the table, politely passing the jam and croissants, shuffling aside the milk a bit to see each other better and trying to get comfortable in the chairs that refuse to accommodate for the presence of feet or cross-legged sitting.
“Why, Mr. Malfoy, how very forward of you.” Potter smirks down on him, his hands settling on Draco’s shoulders as he gets comfortable. A normal person, a
The bell jingles merrily to announce Draco’s entry, making Potter look up from his work.
Draco doesn’t know to behave towards Potter, after their unconventional bonding moment a few days back. He never thought he would be the one to keep Potter from breaking apart at the seams, not when their childhood had been devoted to finding ever new ways of making the other explode and laugh at the ensuing confetti. But standing there, watching the first sign that Potter isn’t as unaffected by this whole ordeal as assumed, that he
“I know what you mean,” Draco says, even though the words feel ridiculously small against the ferocity of his yearning, the deep understanding of seeing it reflected in Potter. “I feel the same, every time I look at the stars.”
“Are you alright, darling?” Pansy asks, her voice drawing him out of his grim thoughts and back into her garden, to the sun shining onto his face and the tea still steaming. She looks at him with concern, forehead wrinkled and head cocked to the side like a bird as she tries to figure out what is wrong with him. Draco wishes he could tell her, wishes he knew the right answer, the right words.

have a ring. Malfoy, who doesn’t know that, freezes, brain racing for something to say to this grabby man, grinning in delight as he thinks himself victorious.
And Potter. Draco has been very patient with Potter. Pansy has a few choice words to say about that, but Draco is content not examining this behavioural quirk of his too closely. (They both know what it means, no need to spell it out.)

the hero here, after all, and that probably applies to Potter’s friends as much as Potter himself. He makes a half-hearted effort to give Granger a scowling look—Granger, in turn, lays her ears back against her head and looks demure; Draco thinks they performed that well—and Draco lifts Weasley up by one of his horns, pulling him out of the water like a hairy fish.
Well, can’t be helped now. Draco offered a finger out of his bubble of safety and Harry grabbed his whole hand and pulled him down. There is no escape.
Maybe that’s best, maybe this is Harry’s silence to break. He is the one who created it, after all, even though he seems less affected by what he revealed than Draco feels. This isn't Draco’s place to say something, to impose even more where he doesn’t belong. (One might point out that this is still
Harry chances a glance up at Narcissa to get a gauge at how gruesome his death will be. That turns out to be a mistake.

He doesn’t find anything, the wood entirely useless—there! Something glinting, right at Draco’s feet. The dragon makes a sound like a sneeze, but hotter, scorching, and Draco doesn’t look at what that means, reaching down for the glint and praying that it isn’t useless, holding up an arm as though would do anything for his protection.
“No, I rather think that is exactly the point.” Draco smirks, tries his best to make it look welcoming, seductive — just like he practised.
The concept, that is — not the physical act of awkwardly watching as his mother takes apart his husband (the best outcome for Draco, by far), or as they bond over brandishing about embarrassing stories Draco did his best to forget. Considering the recent developments, Draco thought the possibility of introducing his husband and parents was finally gone. His marriage is over in all but name, his mother didn’t seem to care before, and his father might not have been aware in the first place — as far as Draco was concerned, his chances to see Harry sweat under his mother’s judgement were a thing of the past.
manage something that resembles normalcy, true, but that is more thanks to their friends unceremoniously kicking them out of where they had been hiding in their guest rooms and couches. Harry is convinced it was Parkinson's idea, Draco likes to blame Hermione, which means it probably was Ron. Not that it matters; it worked out fine, and everyone is happy with how things are.

It is not Pansy who stands in the doorway, looking extremely unimpressed with both Draco's crisis and the mix-up. Draco should have recognised it at the voice; it didn't sound anything like Pansy.
Then suddenly, like a flood, he can breathe again, not a trace of hair in his mouth and Potter still safely held in his arms. Huh, Draco honestly didn’t think there was a way to have both; he was prepared to die for his foolish adoration of Potter.
The importance of Draco’s being undisturbed is utterly lost on Potter, of course. The only time he so much as moved to say something, was when one of the men wanted to know where
On the bright side, this means Draco will be the one to introduce Potter to the wicked pleasures of the flesh, drag their Golden Boy into frivolity and sin. To say that Draco isn’t beyond thrilled at the prospect would be a poor lie.
“What do you think you are doing?” Harry sounds the closest to panic that Draco has ever heard him, holding Draco at arm’s length and staring at him, eyes wild. That is not what Draco wanted to happen — did he do it wrong?
They have been getting along alright, fulfilling their sacred married duties without fights and murder threats and giving Grimmauld absolutely nothing to frown upon. They settled into something scarily domestic, sharing spaces more and more instead of just existing in them side by side. Granted, it was Ginny who pointed that out, dropping by to prove her infuriating theory of Harry’s alleged crush on Malfoy (talking to Hermione about not sharing her impressions of Harry’s love life with his ex turned out to be useless, Hermione refuses to see the problem and Ginny keeps on knowing too much) so nothing she said can truly be trusted, but it’s unsettling all the same.

When Potter said that he had the perfect idea for how to spend the rest of their evening, Draco didn’t expect a ballroom. He didn’t expect the clothes either, well tailored from fine fabric, sitting on Draco comfortable like a second skin. This a few leagues more fancy than Draco would have thought Potter to enjoy.

The world is quiet as Draco hides, the earth holding its breath, the dark soothing around him, hugging him like a cloak, whispering reassurances.
Secretly, I expected the end to be … grander. Explosions, fighting tooth and nail, throwing our love around until we had none left, ensuring our mutual destruction.
Draco hadn't even considered that. He only brought the necessities with him when he moved, clothes and books mostly, some of the furniture his mother insisted he take, a few portraits that would have been mortally offended had denied them the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Draco didn’t bring anything … nice, nothing comforting or sentimental, nothing that doesn't serve a purpose.
, just a different kind of hurt) were it not for the thunder, growling low in the distance. Thunder isn’t sadness, isn’t the petty act of covering the sun in clouds. It’s anger, volatile and reaching, loud and intense.
Ron specifically begun with old family recipes, learning them over many days spent in the kitchen with Molly, cooking together through the grief and loss the war brought upon them. Ron gradually tested his own recipes, exploiting Harry and Hermione as his personal guinea pigs and forcing them to smile at even the most vile concoctions lest they want to destroy his fledging hopes, using their feedback to adjust and perfect every dish before presenting it Saturday Family Dinner.
“How long have you hated my touch?” Harry forces himself to look Draco in the eyes, because that, too, is something he
in the endless possibilities of magic, two men cannot have children, wizards or not. But then, why was Malfoy allowed to marry him at all, if there can be no heir? Or is Harry supposed to graciously smile and pretend nothing is the matter as Malfoy takes a lover to sire a little army of blond children to run around here, raise them as his own and to uphold the family name in grace and dignity? Well, it
Draco frowns, wishes he could look away from Potter and all the things he's not doing, but Potter's eyes hold him as surely as they always have, even as it feels unfamiliar. In fact, Draco wants to leave, wants to stand up and go and never know of this Potter, hiding here behind anonymity and apathy.
Granger nods, too, grim and satisfied with her work. Then, she lets Draco go and steps back out of his space. Granger turns around, either consciously turning her back on him to rub in that Draco is no one to be feared, or simply because that way she moves faster and is thus sooner reunited with Pansy. Whichever might be the case, it was a mistake on her part.
Malfoy stops and glances up from where he was inspecting the ward — looking for a way to break it, Harry hopes, he really doesn’t want to be stuck here — to favour him with a look that implies that Harry is the biggest idiot on the planet for having to ask. Is that supposed to answer the question? Or is Malfoy just going to ignore him, apart from the occasional derisive sneer? Harry might put up with that where only himself is concerned, but this is about his friends, and Harry won’t stand for Parkinson doing — whatever it is she plans on doing. She was far too excited at the prospect for it to have been something positive.
“Right, of course, love.” Draco internally melts at the endearment, collapsing into Harry’s arms with a mortifying sound Harry better pretend not to have heard.
“I don’t hate you either, Harry.” Draco says the words like they are a secret, meant only for him, and Harry’s brain stutters to a halt. Harry, Draco called him by his first name. Harry completely understands the urge to smile like a besotted idiot now. He gets it and it's dark and it doesn't matter anyway, and so Harry smiles.
“Fine, don’t trust me then.” Potter sounds like a petulant brat; Draco doesn’t feel bad anymore. “But you agreed to at least try, so unless you want to prove me right about Slytherins all being lying, twisting snakes …”
is what Harry should tell him. Of course, the moment Harry composed himself enough for that realisation, Draco rudely steals his space.
“It looks like it would perform significantly worse when yelled at, which is inevitable if you expect me to handle an oven.” There is a reason Draco isn’t welcome in a kitchen (it’s his fondness of light arson and his propensity to loudly swear; don’t tell his mother, her heart couldn’t take it).
“You mean it wasn’t you who invited the hundred reporters you steered me into?” Potter asks, half a lazy smile on his well-kissed lips. Draco is almost sure he means for it to be a joke.

Thankfully Draco’s room isn’t as large for two adults running to escape the silence as it was for a small boy, imagining it to be the whole world, and they soon reach the bookshelves. Or is this a bad thing? Draco isn’t sure anymore, but there is no way back. He made more than sure of that.

likes to write about.
“If I get sick, it’s your fault,” Draco says, but Potter doesn’t wait for the whole sentence before he takes Draco’s hand and moves them, humming off key as he twirls them through the rain, splattering warm and heavy onto their skin, the scent of rain already settling in the air, right next to Potter’s laugh. The world spins around them but Potter holds him close and secure, making Draco laugh as they, too, spin. Draco thinks that perhaps, if Potter keeps this up, they don’t need caged Muggle stars to stand amongst their glittering light.
“Over-dramatic.” Theo says it like it’s a
“I will say this once, and only once, Malfoy; you hurt Harry. We don't know what you did or why, but you hurt him badly. He is willing to overlook that and take you back with no regard to himself, which is stupid and generous, and you better be sure before you answer him. He deserves better than being the punching bag for your games. When he inevitably asks you if there is any chance that you can move on and ignore what happened, you will apologise. Regardless of your answer, you will apologise for hurting him. And if you decide something and then later on change your mind for some inane reason, I will make certain that you can never answer a question again. Is that clear?”
Draco watches somewhat detached as Pansy starts lecturing Blaise about charm (as if he needs any help in that department) and how, if anyone,
Potter laughs as he catches him, hands on Draco’s waist. He is beautiful up close, loose from orgasm and aimlessly happy, floating in bliss.
“He can’t talk, it’s the movie,” a yellow fish helpfully explains. Granger? Probably, Draco doesn’t think Potter would speak to him through a different form when he refuses to use his body for it. “It’s a curse that can only be lifted with the kiss of true love. Thus this scene, to tempt you into kissing him.”
“Would you be willing to sign that you said that?” Potter challenges, quill and parchment appearing in the air like they were summoned. They probably were; Potter thinks he’s funny. It’s a terrible joke, but Draco laughs anyway, lifts Potter on their next turn and makes him squeal.
Potter
Potter looks at his books, gives it a few cursory shakes, and turns his frown up at Draco. He reached all the wrong conclusions from his stumbling tests; Draco should have expected that.
(He also—he couldn’t help but notice—is a strutting mountain of muscle, wearing ineffective armour and a skirt so short it might just as well not be there. Draco feels ridiculous, off-balance in this body that isn’t his, but he assumes Potter did this on purpose, to match the hero from this movie. He only hopes Potter will appreciate the efforts it takes Draco not to fall.)
“What about now, can we go out now?” Even Draco is annoyed by his incessant asking, but he firmly believes that Potter needs fresh air. They spent the entire day inside, cooped up in Potter’s affront of a kitchen—seriously, Draco will have to sneak his friends in here when Potter is playing games with Longbottom and they need to do some serious work—and Draco has forgotten what life without a headache of bad air and sadness feels like.
“Come on, Malfoy, that was a foul!” Potter shoves his shoulder into him, not looking to see Draco almost fall from the unexpected contact, far too focused on watching the game. A game Draco himself remains inexplicably uninterested in.
of the dishwasher and the wrong place Potter forced it into. Potter snorts but refrains from commenting. (Which is rather telling in itself; Potter got better at judgemental silences since they left Hogwarts.)
What Harry truly needs, since Plan A failed, is an ally. He has plenty of people to choose from, so that should be easy, but Harry has an inkling that it won’t be. After all, would he need this elaborate planning if it were easy?
The Prophet comes with a supplement celebrating our wedding anniversary. I bin it and leave for work without Draco. He will complain, but the other option is telling him I don’t want our marriage to be just a political alliance anymore.
Ron Weasley rises from the chair in his office at his full name being used, and runs out the door without his robes on, which isn’t really unusual. Ron isn’t one for uniform codes. It’s a miracle every button on his wine-red waistcoat is done up.
Harry is never quiet when they fuck. He begs, cries, urges Draco on, teases him. He gives as good as he gets, which is just his nature, really. Draco wouldn’t ask him not to. Would never want him to be any different.
Harry is sober. He’s rarely sober when he shows up at Draco’s. He’s carrying a cotton tote bag when he steps out of the Floo, eyes bright and smile arresting.
Draco squeezes Potter’s neck rhythmically, squeezing tight and letting go, and doing it again, watching for Potter’s reactions as he continues to suck on Draco’s fingers. Draco lets go when Potter pulls his head back and says, “Fuck, Malfoy. So good.”
Draco can’t help but smile. He shakes his head no, then.
Draco’s only rule is no repeats. He knows himself. The way he loves patterns, spirals too easy to fall into, desire paths that have been travelled so heavily and so often they’ll never grow grass again, rabbit holes in which either
Which he resolves quickly by wrapping his hand around Potter’s cock, making him raise his hips up in unconscious response. “Relax,” he says. “You want this, Potter. You came to my house, at this hour, for me to make you feel good. Let me.”
Potter hadn’t suddenly become kind or any nonsense like that. He scowls at Draco all day long, a sad little frown on his handsome face — there so often it almost looks like it belongs. But Draco sees him, like this, when they’re not at work. Draco knows that at night, Harry Potter replaces that frown with a shy smile and hungry eyes.
Potter really isn’t good at this. At pretending.
“Cl— clos—uh—closer,” he tries again.
“Get. Him. Out.” The room rattles with the force of his shouting.
Potter gasps for air when Draco’s hand wraps around his curls, now so much longer than they were a year ago but just as soft. “Malfoy, please,” he says, pulling his mouth off Draco’s cock and lapping at the head.
It was the persistent horror of knowing you don’t believe in what you’re doing and knowing you’re damned if you do it and damned if you don’t. Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, Draco would lie in his bed at night — his own at home, his own in the dorms, Pansy’s in the girls’ dorms when it got bad, and he would say it to himself, hoping it would become true, “I am dying.”
“Darling—“
tell. I could tell before we were together. Even before that first kiss at Teddy’s tenth birthday party — after which I (shamefully) ran and disappeared for a whole week. I can always tell with him.
And Draco smiles at him properly then and says, “Actually, no. Let’s do it again.”
“I like everything you do to me,” Potter replies in that way that is so quintessentially him — both honest and disarming, all at the same time, and Draco’s pulse quickens.
That’s when the most surprising thing happens. Potter launches himself at Draco, grabbing the back of Draco’s neck with a wide cold hand that makes Draco shiver, and makes to pull Draco down into a kiss.
cw: dark-ish Harry, arson, implied murder
No one likes his burning as much as he does.
I simply nod at him, all excitement and fear.
Free. The word rings in Draco’s ears as the smoke rises above Grimmauld Place.
It smells like St. Mungo’s when he wakes up thinking “I am dying.” Very faintly, he hears the same voice he always hears in his dreams. Maybe
Draco does it on Harry’s arms and then on his thighs.
He pushes himself off the pillow slightly and his hand pulls Harry’s green robes closer until their lips meet, clumsily and hard — Harry not expecting it, Draco waning from the efforts of pulling Harry closer, but Draco will die knowing he’s kissed Harry. And if there’s no later, at least he’s done it. At least Harry
Potter enjoys rummaging through the little trunk at the bottom of Draco’s bed, full of toys, rope and leather. Draco lets him.
Potter doesn’t need to be told twice, he gets on his knees and waits, looking up at Draco. Then he says, “Can I see you? All of you?” and Draco realises Potter has never seen him fully naked, despite Draco having his way with him twice now.
Draco does go all soft and apologetic. He doesn’t have to (again, it’s not my fault I don’t know shit, but it’s definitely not his either — in fact, he’s the reason I know as much as I do). I appreciate it nonetheless. I round the table to put the empty plates and mugs in the sink and stop to kiss the top of his head.
He looks at me and I realise: I loved him then. All the way back at the trials — I just didn’t know it.
Draco realises his plan to focus on something else and not come has backfired spectacularly as Potter positions himself with his face down on the sofa cushions and his perky bum up in the air, for Draco’s taking.
“I thought I’d find you here.”
The peonies had only just started to wilt the day Harry doesn’t come home.
Mavis tries to smile, but it comes out all wrong, all teeth and panic. “Auror Weasley wants a word with you, actually,” she says. Behind her, the bullpen is noisier than ever. She doesn’t remember anything like this, ever, even during the war.
So Draco had decided early on, he would never fuck the same mouth, never suck the same cock, never shag the same arse.
He doesn’t know why it’s like that but when he sinks down on Potter’s cock, Potter’s eyes locked on his, he knows that this is about to be the most intense shag of his life.
When the news of the Potter divorce hit the papers, Draco waits at the café in York, staring at the tiles. He knows it’s foolish to consider Harry will even remember they used to come here.
There is no plant today, which Mary only slightly scolded him for. Draco promised to buy twice the amount of flowers tomorrow when he brought her tea, which she begrudgingly agreed would be acceptable. She did understand that Draco had a different gift for Potter today.
It’s too late for that now. Whatever they worked their way into, the fragile peace they build, Draco shattered it all quite effectively. It wouldn’t have been all that bad, had he not gone back and tried in vain to fix it. Draco should have accepted Harry’s apology, should have felt awful and torn up about it and he could have dedicated his life to never letting it happen again, to never let Harry look like he did in that moment.
Draco Malfoy

Draco wishes there was. He didn’t even wish for it this much when it was him in Potter’s position, hurt and done and tired.
He fought Voldemort, and he fought himself, and he fought when he didn’t know what else to do.
with that? It’s just a name, nothing to get excited about.
“I would appreciate your opinion on the couch I picked for the living room. I have concerns about your menagerie of friends fitting.” Draco tries hard to give the offer as unstudied an air as possible, to pretend his heart isn’t shaking in his chest at the possibility of Harry exploiting this, demanding more than Draco can give at the moment and crowing in victory when he takes it from him anyway.
“You are kidding.” Draco is proud to report that he doesn’t choke on his words this time, delivering them in perfect tonelessness.
to brush his hair back or straighten his clothes (or put on some new ones, these are wrinkled and loose as if he slept in them), which only serves to make his appearance more intriguing.
drawers for things to go into! He can just place all the big bowls with the glasses, where there was space aplenty. Draco lets out a triumphant shout as they fit, no problem. He places the biggest bowl and even the second biggest and fine, the third is a bit much but that’s alright. Draco fills the rest of the space with smaller bowls, does some shuffling and rearranging and shifting between the two drawers, but eventually fits them all, the most beautiful patchwork anyone has ever seen. Draco is quite proud.
“I thought you were the reasonable one, Granger. Surely you suspected it would require highly invasive measure to drag Potter back to the light. Isn’t that why you wanted
“Yeah, it is.” Draco replied. He smiled as he read the plaque on the fountain. “Didn’t you have something to do with Nicholas Flamel in first year?”
When he awoke, Draco was no longer laying with him, and Harry raised himself up, yawning, looking around for him. And there he was, sitting in the armchair with a look Harry would have called fond on anyone else, but on Draco you could never be too sure.
“Harry.” said Draco, sitting next to him. “You know I don’t like him at all. I like you.”
Under interrogation they discovered that he’d used a little known curse that none of them except McGonagall had ever heard of. According to her it had been used during the first war, and it was a spell that would burn you up, slowly, with immense pain, from the inside out. Draco had thrown up when he’d heard her say that.
Draco opened his eyes blearily and immediately shut them at the bright light streaming in from the windows. Where was he? He propped himself up onto his elbows and lifted his head but- bloody hell, his head hurt. He groaned and lay back down.
“He looked like he needed a friend.”
He was glad to return to Hogwarts, to see his friends again, but… things would be different here. They were different here. He was the Death Eater, Harry was the Chosen One. When people found out about their relationship… it wouldn’t stop him from dating Harry, but it would make things difficult. For both of them. For Harry.
Draco only came out of his funk when he bumped into something. Something… warm? No, someone. “Sorry.” he said, his mind still on Beauxbatons and escaping to France. He looked up to see Potter.
To be fair, she had lied to him. And forced him to do something he’d adamantly refused to do. He was definitely allowed to yell at her. Draco intended to ignore her today, because even if she was right and some small something had lifted off his shoulders, like he’d done something right for once, he’d embarrassed himself like never before. Which might not be her fault but it was her fault he was there in the first place. Daphne’s fault that Draco had seen Potter and Weasley and Granger and Potter with bright eyes and nice skin and wonderfully muscled arms and-
Draco couldn’t look away from him, but his frantic heartbeat steadied at the other boy’s words. Not a bad person. We’ve forgiven you. Maybe it’s the fact that he called Draco by his first name, or he had told Draco the words that he so desperately had needed and really meant them, but Draco decided to trust him at this moment. To trust Harry. His friend.
“Done?” said Harry, coming up to stand next to Draco. He had a school owl of his own perched on his forearm, a dark-feathered, yellow-eyed bird that hooted disdainfully at Draco. With sudden flaps the owl flew off, the white envelope clutched in its beak.
Draco barged past him. “Wow, this is nice.” he commented as he claimed the left bed. Harry rolled his eyes and set his trunk down at the end of the other bed.
“Yeah, alright.” responded Harry, and the two walked up to the Defense class that they shared, along with Potions.
But he did. Had. Does. And that knowledge is just...infinitely precious to Harry. Wondrous. Amazing.
“Yeah, we were in the same dorm at Beauxbatons.” Harry said.
Harry grinned. “It was fun,” he said, entirely too proud of himself.
“Don’t worry about it,” murmured Draco quietly, squeezing Harry’s hand reassuringly.
“I studied with her today. Daphne and the other girls from my dorm,” responded Hermione conversationally. “She said something about Malfoy being missing all day.”
Draco nodded, stepping back to give Harry some space. “No problem. Will you be alright to Floo?” Harry was dimly aware of McGonagall and a few other teachers standing around them. He imagined being swallowed by that green light and he mutely shook his head.
“Sorry.” he said sheepishly.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco snapped, and Harry chuckled. They resumed walking to Potions, walking near a Ravenclaw boy who was pale and drawn and gave Draco a hateful glare, which Draco ignored pointedly. The blond took it a step further and grabbed Harry’s tie, pulling him in for a long, slow, burning kiss that made the hateful-looking boy cough in
“How is he?”
“No, it’s still the weekend.” Draco replied. “Common room?”
Draco sighed and began to eat, pausing briefly when Dean Thomas sat next to him.
“Got yourself a girlfriend, Malfoy? Surprised you found a girl to take a Death Eater.” Finnegan stood up from a knot of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff boys on the sofa, though Draco didn’t see Potter or Weasley. Thomas grabbed Finnegan’s sleeve.
Suddenly a hand grabbed him and unceremoniously dragged him onto the train, shutting the door behind him. Harry sagged against the door as Hermione let go of his arm. Harry sighed and let his breathing slow down.
“Why?” she responded softly.
“Weren’t you just telling me about your superior shopping skills? Besides, would you rather do it now, or after dinner when it’s freezing and dark?” cajoled Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes, brushing his blond hair out of his eyes.
“You said Lovegood did it?” Draco inquired, and Harry smiled. One, at the memory of Luna, and getting the tattoo, and two, because Harry had an idea of why Draco was so fascinated by the tattoo.
“Yeah. In our dorm last night she seemed ok.”
Healer Program, and practicing his French, which his mother had made him learn when he was little.
“Please don’t force me to learn French, Draco.” he quipped. Draco laughed.
“Why was it open in the first place?” asked Draco, taking off his shoes.
They went down to breakfast, sitting down with Daphne (sitting cozily next to Simon), Camille (wearing the new sweater Draco had gotten her with a smug expression on her face), and Amelie (waggling her eyebrows at Draco and Harry suggestively). Draco sighed and rolled his eyes at Amelie, snagging a flaky croissant from the middle of the table.
It was just so ironic, so weird, and Harry had chuckled under his breath when he’d seen it. It was the last thing he’d expected Malfoy to be reading.
“Shut the fuck up,” Draco hissed, his eyes darting around. “Do you want everyone to know? It’s none of your business. Any of you.” Daphne opened her mouth to talk, then closed it and looked at Pansy. Blaise appeared confused, and Draco remembered he didn’t know.
“Come on,” he said, grasping Draco’s hand and tugging him up. Draco rolled his eyes but allowed himself to be led from the room, inwardly berating the stubbornness of Gryffindors. Particularly this Gryffindor. His boyfriend. Draco marveled at that statement, even now. It felt so foreign when it rolled off his tongue, but oddly familiar at the same time. It did have the added bonus of seeing Harry smile whenever he said it, so that was something.
“You know, you’re not so bad. For a Gryffindor.” Daphne announced as she changed her eyebrows back.
“But he’s alright, of course. I saw him just now. Thanks to you, I suppose.” she said flatly.
“When will details for those meetings be posted, Headmistress?” asked Hermione.
“Oh-yeah.” Harry joined him and they said goodbye to Hermione and Ron before walking out of the Great Hall and into the relatively empty hallways.
Draco rolled his eyes at that last comment. “We’ll see.” They reach the revolving griffin staircase and pinned on the wall next to it, just as promised, is the list. Daphne took out a quill and they wrote their names in the first two spots.
“What?” Draco blinked and looked at Harry, who was smiling softly.
He looked still kind of surprised, but not disgusted or hateful like those two people Harry and Draco had encountered in the hallways. When he met Harry’s eyes he coughed awkwardly.
“Alright.”
“It’s dumb. Who uses a plant as a password?”
“Where’d you disappear to?” asked Blaise curiously, and Draco shrugged.
“Are you interested in that?”
“Don’t remind me. At least you don’t have to shop for the whole Weasley family.” Harry grumbled. “Plus Hermione, Andromeda, and Teddy, Camille and Amelie.” Harry finally picked out a thick volume and put it in his bag. “Plus,” he continued, “a very fancy blond Slytherin who has expensive tastes.”
“Draco!” said Pansy in delight as he sat down next to her that evening in the common room, Blaise next to her. “You’re back!”
“What’s wrong?” he repeated. “I- I’m Draco fucking Malfoy, I’m an ex-Death Eater. You’re Harry Potter, the Savior of the Wizarding World-”
This school year had been unlike any other, with good reason. There was an elegant stone memorial that adorned the courtyard now, across from the fountain. On it, the names of the fallen were etched forever in the rock. Not just those of the second war, but of everyone who’d perished because of Voldemort since the beginning. Every time he passed by, Harry let his hand drift out and run over the letters that made his parent’s names, then the others.
Once they were ensconced in the common room and everyone had a sandwich in hand, Hermione began firing off questions while Ron watched, content to let her do the talking but obviously curious as well.
“Just because all Gryffindors are notoriously stubborn doesn’t mean you have to be.” replied Draco snidely. “I’m fine. Go back to sleep, we have to go out to the village today, remember?”
“Well, I couldn’t think of anything to get you for Christmas. But there’s a meteor shower tonight, and I thought you might like to watch it with me?” said Harry, and Draco noted some uncertainty in his voice. He looked so earnest.
“A round of Firewhisky, please.” said Simon, propping his elbows on the bar. Harry snorted. He didn’t have much experience with Firewhisky, all he remembered about it was that it burned going down. But hey, what the hell. It’s one time.
“No, mine is from my dad. It’s a long story, but it’s been around forever and it’s always worked.” explained Harry, thinking of the Deathly Hallows. His cloak was the only one left, really, and the only one that he wanted.
“Nah.” Draco smirked. “You’ve carried me, I think you can handle some sandwiches.” Harry rolled his eyes and they kept walking in comfortable silence. Draco was sorely tempted to start a conversation, if only to distract himself from panicking over… his situation.
“What happened, Seamus?” Harry asked again. The other boy won’t meet Harry’s eyes but stared at his shoes. Harry let out a breath and turned his attention to Dean.
“I don’t need help from Potter!”
The three ascend the staircase and with a sigh, Harry entered the Great Hall. The stone room is brightly lit, the floating candles clustering together overhead of the seated students. It’s just as he remembered.
“Vanilla, treacle tart, and Quidditch equipment.” he answered quickly. “You?” Daphne gave him a look of curiosity.
through the throngs of people towards the door.
“Hey- thanks for going to get the Headmistress.”
“Yeah, let’s go. I’ve had enough shopping for five years.” complained Harry, and Draco smirked as they stepped out into the cold, both of them shivering involuntarily as the change in temperature hit them.
“No one, actually,” said Draco, and Harry laughed.
“Oh, we forgot to practice today.” Harry exclaimed quickly, rushing to change the subject. “Patronuses,” he added at Draco’s quizzical glance. Draco shrugged.
He was awoken by a violent sneeze from Harry the next morning, and blearily pushed himself into a sitting position.
“Shove off, Draco.” replied Harry, knocking his shoulder into Draco’s. “But hey- really. You did good.”
“Oh, is that why you left the ball?” she said, and Harry nodded, and she squealed.
The window was open, and Harry could hear the faint sounds of a baby gurgling. The brisk wind rustled through the yellow grasses behind the house. Harry glanced over at Draco.
“Well that’s good,” answered Ron in a tone of convincing sincerity. “Have you heard from Madam Maxime?” Hagrid blushed.
Draco knew he could’ve done more, should’ve done more, even if it had been at the expense of his parents, his own life. Potter would have died to save everyone, he willingly walked to his own death, for fuck’s sake. But Draco, Draco was a coward. He’d knowingly let Death Eaters into the school, orchestrated the death of Dumbledore, tortured people at the Dark Lord’s command…
“Fine, fine.”
“How was that healing test you had today?” asked Harry. Draco stood up to greet him, pleased that Harry had remembered.
But by the time they reached the front doors of the castle, Draco’s fear and shock had morphed into anger. Who had tried to kill him? He knew why, because he was Draco Malfoy, but what scum had tried to kill him? And tried to kill him in that way, too. Some coward who couldn’t even try to kill him face to face. Pathetic.
“You can fly with me a bit if you like,” offered Ron, and Hermione blushed a little.
“Can we not talk about this right now?” said Draco quietly. He sounded tired.
“Maybe a little bit,” admitted Harry. Draco grabbed his hand and Harry let Draco tug him away from their Beauxbatons dorm and down the hall, where they would go to breakfast before departing for Hogwarts.
First he went down to the dining hall, where Draco grabbed a pot of tea and Harry’s favorite breakfast- toast with marmalade and scrambled eggs- before dropping them off back with Harry.
“I’ll meet you there in a few minutes, I have to go meet one of my professors first.” explained Draco. He’d asked to meet with his Healing Magic professor, because he was starting to get an idea for Harry’s christmas present but wanted to ask his teacher about one aspect of it.
“Oui, c'est nous.” he replied, and Pansy raised her eyebrows while Blaise snickered.
“Good morning,” he said, poker-faced, and Draco smirked as he sat up.
“Bugger off, Potter,” snapped Draco, and Harry chuckled again. “If you go get me coffee,” he added, “I’ll let you kiss me as long as you want later.” Harry sent him a grin, and Draco had to resist the urge to jump on him and just snog already.
“Yeah,” Draco replied, and they started up the cobblestone walkway to the front door. Harry knocked. A few seconds later the door flew opened and Andromeda was there in front of them.
“They should have dinner ready by now,” said Hermione, carefully marking her book and stowing it in her bag. She stood and so did Ron, and Draco tried subtly to follow them out.
“Not bloody likely!” he replied in an angry whisper. “You planned this, didn’t you, you twat? I told you to drop it. Why can’t you just respect my choices?” He saw Granger watching them, and her expression faded to one of distaste when her eyes met Draco’s.
“Go for it, mate.” Ron grinned. “We’ll miss you, though.” Hermione nodded agreement.
“Did I hear my name?” Camille butted in, and Draco smiled at her.
shadowing Simon, as he was funny and seemed like a nice guy so far. It was also a great bonus that he would be with Daphne.
Twenty minutes later, they were lying on the blanket together, after their kissing session. Draco was tucked up against Harry, Harry’s arm curling around him, their legs tangling together some. The meteor shower was petering out above them, and they watched it in a comfortable silence.
“It’s not a bother. I’d love to, it’s rather fun to do.” Draco got the sense she was sincere, so he accepted gratefully.
Harry blinked. “I know he does.” he replied simply.
“Ask Hermione, I’m busy.” Draco said, pulling out a book.
“Of course I remember it. That was when everything started. And- alright. Truce.”
Daphne stepped daintily into the sooty fireplace and took a handful of powder. “Beauxbatons,” she said confidently, throwing the powder down, and there was a flare of green flames and she was gone. Harry’s heart jumped to his throat.
“What did you do?” asked Harry curiously, before Draco stuck his whole arm inside of the bag. “Oh, Undetectable Extension Charm?”
“You sound like Hermione,” Draco snorted. “It’ll be fun. And people will treat us normally. I won’t have to deal with people attacking me, you won’t have to deal with adoring fans and the autograph-hopeful.” Harry made a noise of agreement. “Why don’t you give out autographs?” mused Draco, spinning a ladle between his fingers.
“No, I don’t want to make a big deal out of this. If we go to McGonagall that won’t fix anything. You know that.” Draco argued. But Harry was scrutinizing him.
When he’d seen how worried Pansy and Daphne had been, he’d forgiven them and apologized himself for treating them the way he did, and they’d accepted his apology. Draco was glad for that, because he’d missed the two of them, and he had felt bad about cold-shouldering them.
Over the next few days, Harry relaxed back into the familiar Hogwarts schedule and surroundings. With the exception of his, Hermione’s, and Ron’s secret guard schedule around Draco. So far it had been going smoothly; no one had done anything worse than glare or mutter under their breath at Draco, and Draco didn’t seem to mind that, as the blond would just stare them down until they looked away. Harry had been on the receiving end of those glares in the past and would have pitied anyone who got one, except now they did kind of deserve it.
“...had a ball two days ago, like the Yule Ball except more fancy.” Draco read aloud as he scribbled with a quill, Harry next to him. “Nothing more has happened with the Animagus Club, it’s turned out to be a bit of a laugh, all we do is read about the process. What else?” Draco added, looking at Harry. They were trying to think of things to write about that didn’t have to do with them starting to date.
“Ha ha.”
“That’s really interesting- but I hope no one has lice,” Amelie quipped, and they laughed.
“You’ll be fine. I’ll even be nice and let you use mine.” Draco stared him down before whipping out his wand and Accio’ing the hair products from under Harry’s bed, making a
“You didn’t exactly protest though, did you?” he said dryly, fiddling with the doorknob. He stepped inside, and Harry followed him. Really, he’d only come so they could snog in private.
As he left the dorm, he stopped and went over to his bed again. Pale orange sheets. Draco shuddered. Not even silk sheets! It was some plebian cotton monstrosity. In the Slytherin common room, things had been much more adequate. He pulled out his wand, which Potter had sent back to him this summer. Another thing to thank him for, probably, thought Draco.
“Bit tetchy, Draco?” he teased, his green eyes sparkling. Draco narrowed his eyes, crossing his arms with a huff and blowing a strand of blond hair out of his eyes.
“Yeah.” he responded, and swept aside his hair to show them the scar. So much for being anonymous, he thought to himself as they exclaimed and began asking questions. He answered as much as he could, and to his surprise the conversation eventually moved onto classes and the school’s customs. Draco elbowed him.
“We’re back,” Draco repeated.
“You aren’t horrible either, for a Slytherin.” Harry replied, restoring his own eyebrows. They return to their seats and Harry sat down back next to Hermione.
“I told you one time, and now you bring it up all the time,” he huffed.
“Alright,” he agreed casually, but planned to show up prepared. Draco Malfoy does not have things sprung on him.
“What was that, though?” asked Harry curiously. “What’s the name for a winged horse?”
“Why didn’t you just go grab him some from the infirmary?” asked Daphne curiously, staring at Draco. Harry watched him too; if he was honest he’d forgotten that was an option, but it was technically the more rational one.
“I’ll be fine. Go and rest.”
It had been… weird, thought Harry. They’d been pressed up against one another, and his face had been right in front of Malfoy’s, close enough to have counted the individual blond eyelashes that framed Malfoy’s grey eyes. For a long moment they’d just looked at each other, both too stunned to think straight, but then the other boy’s eyes had widened and he’d shoved Harry off of him. Harry didn’t know why he was seeing that as a bad thing-it’s not like he wanted to be laying on Malfoy. But some obscure part of his brain had complained when Malfoy had unceremoniously pushed Harry away. Probably just because landing on the floor was more painful than landing on someone else, Harry thought, adjusting his glasses.
Draco’s gaze dropped to Harry’s lips, pink and full and slightly parted. Draco was looking at Harry, and Harry was looking back, and there was that intense look again in his eyes, and Draco’s brain was full of the desire to lean forward and kiss him…
“Yeah,” he said unenthusiastically, writing it down. Harry was tracing lines on Draco’s back as he wrote the letter, but he paused.
They broke apart, and Draco flushed more when he noticed that somehow he’d made his way to Harry’s lap, and Harry’s hands were fitted around his waist.
“Like what?”
Hogwarts. Even though the school held such bad memories for him, a part of him would always feel at home there. After all, he had spent the majority of his time there for seven years, and whether he liked it or not it was an important part of his childhood. He couldn’t see much of the castle from here, just the towers jutting into the inky sky and the small sparkles of light through far-away windows.
“Can I help you?” he said, and the girl flushed from embarrassment.
“Damn, they talk a lot.” he said, but his tone was fond. Harry found a window seat overlooking the gardens and sat in it, and Draco huffed.
“Class 4, sit down.” Harry said firmly, but no one listened, or no one could hear him. He exchanged an amused look with Amelie, who strode to the front of the room. Harry followed, and leaned against the teacher’s desk, flipping through the lesson plan. Teaching them about other countries. Interesting.
Once Draco and Harry left the common room, Draco let Harry lead the way to the kitchens, as he had never been there before. Draco was in a bit of a daze. What he’d shared… what Harry had shared as well, it had impacted Draco greatly. He felt as if there was a huge weight that had lifted from his chest, a weight that had slowly been crushing him. He’d confided in Harry, and been comforted by him as well. Within the embrace of the other boy Draco had felt calm, safe.
“Hi Draco. Interesting lesson, yeah?”
“It was an Abraxan,” explained Draco, lowering his wand. “Remember, they pulled Beauxbatons carriage when they came to Hogwarts in fourth year?”
Later that afternoon, Harry returned to the castle to have his career meeting with Headmistress McGonagall. He stopped in front of the griffin staircase, and while he waited for it to go all the way to the top he perused the trip sign up list. Harry had signed up yesterday, before he and Ron had joined Hermione in the library, but the list was full now. Malfoy, Daphne, Padma, Parvati, Hannah, Susan, Sue Li, Dean, Micheal Corner, Ernie Macmillan, and Harry. It’ll be different, three months without Ron and Hermione, Harry thought. But interesting as well. And it’ll be bloody wonderful to have some small semblance of anonymity.
But when he had seen Malfoy by the carriages, and when he bumped into him, Malfoy hadn’t been insulting or rude or sneering. He’d just been quiet, and kind of indifferent. And whenever he met Malfoy’s gaze, he hadn’t sensed any hostility.
“Just like Ron,” he said, shaking his head, and Draco laughed as he ate another sweet.
He liked Draco. Once that fell into place, everything else did too.
“Yes, I’m sure.” said Draco firmly.
“What about you, Harry?”
“Of course I did.” said Draco pompously. “I always do.” Harry laughed and they headed back up to the school for lunch.
“It’s a smartphone. Powered by batteries and electricity, though I power mine with magic when I need it. Muggles use them to talk to each other and lots of other things.” A smartphone. Interesting. I suppose they have to invent things like this, thought Draco, since they don’t have Floo Powder or owl post like wizards do. Granger tapped and tapped,
is loyalty, even if everyone is awfully quick to dismiss it as malice and schemes.
What a mess.
“Sure, I promise to take you to the lights.” Draco watches Potter’s eyes light up in excitement, pan forgotten and slipping onto the ground. “You need to untie me, though.”
“Family is more than blood. I know that because I do have one, I
That couch, though, that is where he draws the line. Faded paisley and the corners ferret-bitten, it truly is a hideous thing. It also, more importantly is the first victory won over Grimmauld (and in his marriage, when Draco claimed to have vanished it and Harry didn’t bust the obvious lie lest Draco vanished it just to prove that he can) and it’s so perfectly offending that Sirius would be proud.
“It’s fine, you take the bed, I’m sure I’ll find somewhere else to sleep!” Malfoy even
Perhaps that isn’t too much better, just a different prejudice.
“But I so enjoyed looking at you, are you sure you can’t be persuaded to put this dance to a hold?” Draco leans close, brushing the words directly into Potter’s ear as he whispers: “I would like more time to express my appreciation.”
He covers it up with more moving, stretches and wiggles and grimaces at the cloying mess in his pants.
Potter doesn't
“I apologise, you are totally not pouting. Was there anything more you wanted to say?” Draco drawls, far too amused by Harry’s mind going haywire. Harry glares at him.
