. He wanted Draco to come because Harry's cock felt good in him. He wanted to be the reason Draco got hard, and the reason Draco came. He wanted to be fantastically, ridiculously good at this.
Draco layered on spells in an order he claimed was critical to success. Soon Harry was re-learning cock sucking.
"I think you have better hearing," Harry rushed back in, not wanting to lose his train of thought, "and I think I have maybe faster reflexes. You followed my lead really well when we hit a crisis, and you're good with magical objects, too. So, er, what I am trying to say is, er…"
When Harry had chosen a direction, Malfoy tipped his head opposite. "Now, kissing is all about sensation, texture. I want to explore you. Explore me back. All right?"
"Yeah," Malfoy conceded, looking down. "My parents thought we would look too self-serving or something if we said that after you all escaped, the three of us got put in our own dungeon." His voice was quiet now. He sounded embarrassed. "Or maybe they just thought that part was too embarrassing to share. It was in the legal briefs, just, no one ever said anything about it out loud, in public." He still wasn't looking up from the floor.
In Harry’s blue and green spare room, Draco dropped his modest overnight bag on the wide, squashy bed. He turned toward the American-style quilts on the walls, the framed crayon art signed “Teddy,” the enormous bay window overlooking only moonless night.

“Mother finally admitted she is leaving the country,” Draco told Harry that evening as soon as he returned from an unusually lengthy ward installation in Rhosneigr.
Could his grandfather be a good role model? Maybe he should speak to his Grandfather Abraxas’ portrait.
McGonagall looked uncertain, but Draco jumped right in. "Oh yes, I quite agree! That's perfect. Here. I'll make you some sort of offer, you take the ring and accept the offer, all right?"
"Yes," Draco finally hissed, and his eyes opened. "Can't hold back any longer…." Viscous white come started to spurt from Draco's cock, and he moaned softly as he came. "Oh!" he said, "Oh, oh! Oh!"

As he’d confidently assumed, there she was. About to request lunch, Draco paused and looked at Vissy: obedient, loyal, efficient. “Potter,” he asked in a hushed, distressed tone. “How did that bastard not only get past my previous wards, but past both Vissy

“If you don’t quit,” Harry said, cheeks now red, eyes turned up to the ceiling, “then I really will need to take revenge, because you’ll have bollocksed up my work schedule. I have five days for our project, and no more. Now shoo! Potions!”
“Well,” Harry said, putting his wine glass down and clasping his hands together. “They didn’t teach us anything about it at Hogwarts, for starters. I had to learn about it at the Academy.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“I’d be open to that,” Draco finally said, giving Harry a crooked smile. It was starting to snow. “But first I require a double firewhiskey, neat.”
“It’s been a really long day, just like you said. I’m so tired of being serious! And I think we’ve said enough somber, soul-searching stuff for a while. So let’s do something fun, now, and eat some junk food!”
“Uh, yes?” Neville rolled over and put his own feet on the floor. Then he shifted toward the head of his bed, putting a bit of space between himself and Harry. “But, er, isn’t that what teenagers
"Holy fuck," Harry moaned, and - squirming slightly inside Hole's body to stimulate his dick as well as the electric and suddenly adored skin around his arsehole, he came harder than he'd ever come with either Mouth or Hole alone.
“No,” she agreed. “Monday to Sunday, as my own mother liked to say, he was himself. And Lucius put himself above everyone. Well, for as long as he could.”
“The thing with Ron is, yes, he might be an arse at first. But he values my friendship as much as I value his. And I have an ace.” Harry gave a silly, exaggerated wink. “Hermione.”
But now he had a good forty-five minutes before he would have cause to so much as check a clock, and he knew just how he wanted to spend it. He spelled barriers between his experiments and the rest of the kitchen, to prevent contamination via dust or anything else, and headed for his bedroom. Once there, he looked down at his clean, neatly made bed and frowned. He only had two sets of sheets. These, and the filthy ones he’d stripped off this morning. Smiling at his ingenuity, he grabbed an old, soft blanket from the top shelf of his cupboard and spelled it to adhere tightly to the top of his other bedclothes. There. Even if he made a mess, he could just wash his extra blanket, not everything. He stripped to the skin, pulled out lube and a middling width dildo and lay down to wallow in his imagination once more.
Mouth did so and Harry whistled in appreciation. The front of the gown was opaque, but the entire back was transparent, and Mouth's luscious round arse was easily seen through the one shimmery layer of pale blue. Harry reached out to test the fabric, for if it was smooth he was definitely keeping this thing, and that fabric parted under his hand. There was no seam up the back of the dress. And so while Mouth's tits were fully on display from the front, her arse was not only visible through the fabric, but Harry wouldn't even have to throw fabric up over his whore's head to fuck her, were she wearing this thing. He could simply move the two sides apart, part her cheeks and slip his dick into her waiting body.
Harry rolled onto his back and looked at the ceiling. Under his back, the train rushed toward Milan. It felt completely unlike the Hogwarts Express, but it still felt like a train. He couldn't quite pinpoint why, though.
They nodded at him, so Draco put his shoulders back and spoke to the air between them. “I thought I should switch over to taking correspondence classes, and not return to Hogwarts.”
Draco didn’t know the time and didn’t care. “No, please don’t disturb us unless the Manor… catches fire.”
pregnant. Also, she shows all signs of having a normal menstrual cycle. I assume you don't want her bleeding all over your house for two or three days every month?"
“Yes,” his mother said, slightly fast. “We will spend several days in Morocco — it will be so lovely to catch up with Cellenina, to meet her husband and children — then we’ll head south to Timbuktu. Dizon tells me wizards have been living there for over four thousand years! I’m eager to see the museums and there is a restaurant he wants to take me to. But, Dizon says while we are in Mali we also must visit Djenne. The Monday market there is not to be missed. Silks and wax prints and musical instruments and beautiful toys for his grandchildren.”
Harry felt his face heat and tried to discreetly look away from Narcissa, whose smirk he did not quite manage to miss.

of him underneath Potter. Really. The man was truly just so masculine that Draco could imagine him impregnating multiple women at once. He really was so powerful Draco could easily picture him as Minister for Magic in his twenties. He really was so moral he wouldn’t just gleefully fuck the gift of a whore, but would have to be convinced the other person honestly wanted him. No wonder Draco’s fantasies were getting more and more far-fetched.
Afelgate reluctantly pulled away from Mouth's wet breasts with his mouth, but one of his hands remained, caressing slowly.
“Hannah has really pretty hair,” Neville said, sounding hopeful. “So you think she’s actually available?” He smiled at Harry. Then he looked a bit upset. “What if she thinks I’m a loser for being a virgin?”
“We’re really drunk,” Harry declared, feeling remarkably insightful, intelligent. “We should nap. It’ll make sense sober.”
. A fairly terrifying prospect, as far as Draco was concerned. So Draco had been working on a version that not only wasn’t addictive, not only contained none of the most common allergens, but wasn’t dream
Hermione looked furious. Parvati looked concerned. Seamus looked confused. Poor Neville looked so lost and dazed he might’ve had a stroke.
Draco turned to Harry. “I shall need to pack at Hogwarts as well. Perhaps I will see you before I withdraw from classes and leave campus.”
"I want to talk," Harry said, barely thinking, "about the way you're sucking my cock." He reached for his waistband to get his Muggle clothing out of the way, searching Malfoy's face for an answer. Malfoy nodded slowly, looking almost like he was in a trance, and he slid out of his captain's chair onto the tiny sliver of floor between them. Harry's rushed his cock out of his clothes, not caring about the metal teeth of the zipper.
“Better get washing,” Harry ordered as Draco eased them gently out of the sky. “I won, and I can hardly wait to fuck you.”

, like Lucius, like my father, have made it abundantly clear throughout my life: they find witches to be inferior. Because we take them inside ourselves, willing or no, and they feel superior because they,” she flushed and looked down. “Forgive my blunt words,” she said.
“Yes?” said the new, young King. He sounded preoccupied, and Draco chanced a glance up from his feet to see.
“That, er, makes sense.” Harry said. He gently stroked down Draco’s back. “I’ve come to like Narcissa a lot.”
"Jesus," he said quietly, and — as Draco eased himself off Harry's cock and moved to rest next to him — Harry ran his fingers through the enthusiastic mess Draco had left on his belly. Harry moved his left arm, encouraging Draco to cuddle close next to him, and Draco ran his fingers through his own come as well. Silent, the two lay close, looking down at their bodies. Covered with sweat and come, wrapped together, they looked like a couple.
McGonagall stood. "He is here. Let us hurry. I have Gryffindor's sword." She lifted it, and at her nod, Harry put the ring on a table she'd apparently set aside for this purpose. She raised it higher, looked Harry in the eye, and slammed it down on the ring. The ringing noise echoed through her office, hurting Harry's ears. He grinned tentatively at Draco, until…
“I want to have sex,” he said upwards, still looking at the ceiling. “With you. Tonight would be good, if, I mean, if that’s something you also want.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“You do want me,” Potter murmured at him, somehow audible over the thumping backbeat. He was blatantly running a hand up and down Draco’s length now.
The quality of Harry’s life improved when he realized he could get by fine on his few, consensually obtained, memories of Malfoy. His Gryffindor friends were still nominally interested in setting him up with young men they knew outside Hogwarts, but when Harry stopped actively encouraging them, most of these plans withered on the vine.
“Do you think so?” Narcissa asked, perhaps too honestly. “I know you are young, but perhaps you have been in the professional world – or simply been a woman in the world long enough to know – men frequently believe they have the right to do such things to women, and frankly, they often turn out to be correct.”
Harry listened, fascinated and thrilled. The sense of release he felt as Draco detailed every apology — offered and accepted — was beyond welcome.
"Glad you woke up," Harry said, and it was not long afterwards that they found themselves climbing out of the Mediterranean approximately an hour before dawn on a deserted beach. Magic made quick work of drying them off, and when they realized they had quite a few hours until their Muggle train left, magic made quick work of finding a tiny wizarding inn where they could stash their increasingly heavy (or so it felt) luggage, get some food, and learn about fun things to do from sunrise until evening, when their train left the station. They could even Floo from the inn to the station, though they were warned sternly not to be seen by Muggles and sadly told that no, the Inn's ancient, wheezing Floo couldn't get them even to Milan, let alone London.
It had nothing at all to do with the way his heart was pounding harder than the Hogwarts Express, the way his robes suddenly weighed six hundred pounds, or the way his entire upper body was – if he was lucky – at least a whole degree away from spontaneously combusting.
Draco would have scoffed and assured anyone else that jokes weren't necessary, but Harry appeared close to drooling.
“Look who I found!” Mother interrupted, appearing in the doorway with Harry, who looked a bit stunned.
And if that didn’t make sense right now it would make sense later. As long as he didn’t ever have to explain it to anyone other than himself.
on Harry’s face, too, because he quickly slid into words of placation, supplication, then something close to desperation.
The fucking continued to be spectacular, which he’d not only expected, he’d demanded. If Draco didn’t deliver multiple, spectacular orgasms, it was over and they both knew it. Harry knew that ultimatum also applied to him.
Basically, Draco was remarkably uncomfortable, but he wanted — so much — to get used to this. To Harry. To being… Harry’s.
“I’m a bit behind on schoolwork this week.” He could almost feel that crown on his head, erasing the glint in his eye and the curl of his lip.
Draco has to force himself not to stroke his cock while he watches Weasley fuck the chit’s mouth. He isn’t fond of ginger pubes, but cocks are always a joy. The larger and firmer the erection, the more Draco wishes to share the joy. But he won’t insult his Captain. The man works hard for him, and he deserves to fuck a pretty mouth without the distraction of his Lord’s exquisite cock on display. The one and only time Draco had indulged in a wank during Weasley’s private inspection, Weasley had tried to suck Draco’s dick himself. That is simply unacceptable.
“I’m eager to accept your many lewd invitations,” Harry said over his shoulder. “Promise. Starting sometime tomorrow. Tonight, let me care for you.”
Harry cocked his head. “The external warding is perfect even if the warding is incomplete,” he said after a difficult pause. “I think, for such a moment as this, we should both go to the ministry. But if you want, I can return and watch over the house while you deal with the Aurors?”
.” He turned to discern her expression. She had abandoned the pretense of calm. He watched her smoothing circles into her temples. He grimaced. He hated upsetting his mother.
"No… no unusual lumps," he sort of whispered loudly, and the words appeared on his parchment. "Young women tend to have a lot of lumpy masses in their breasts," he said, explaining to Harry now, "but nothing here feels like cancer. It's all exactly what I would expect from a…" he gulped slightly. "Seventeen year old female."

Draco was pretty sure this was an awful idea, but he had written the list for a reason, hadn’t he? Except, on the way to the dungeon, he thought they could take a shortcut through a narrow stone passageway and who knew how pleasant it was to press your bare arse against cool stone walls while Harry Potter tried to learn how to suck cock? He knew. That’s who.

Relaxing under Draco’s forceful pressure, Harry made a questioning noise. Draco tried again. “The effect was originally discovered by Lord Rayleigh at Saint Paul's Cathedral, in London. But it can happen anywhere on earth. It works for both sound waves and magic.”
"Did you just offer to suck my…" said dick was almost fully erect, apparently eager to say 'yes' if Harry's mouth found itself incapable.
"But I assure you, Harry, I am. When I… hurt my arm, I started a process that no one can stop, not me, nor St. Mungo's, nor Severus. Although Professor Snape has come closer than anyone else. He's been brewing a potion for me that has kept the death confined to my arm alone. So far. But Harry, you need to know that I won't last through this upcoming calendar year."
Draco said nothing, so Narcissa took a forkful of wilted spinach with slivered almonds. Draco ripped off a bit of his roll and popped it in his mouth.
“What can I say,” Draco said, still stroking himself – with two hands now. “Your arse is tight and hot, you like my cock, and I can’t possibly be accused of getting you pregnant. This school is full of bitches whose list of assets can hardly touch yours. While I’m stuck in school for an extra year, my dick still works despite having to postpone marriage to whatever little blonde pureblooded twat Mother manages to snooker into taking my disgraced last name.”

“From that first night when you invited me to your home, through just recently, when my mother confided in you instead of me, you’ve been... amazing. Open, giving, honest. You’ve never let anything get in the way of your happiness. I, on the other hand….”
, Cissy? The boy is five weeks old and can't even stand without assistance. How could he need shoes?"
Harry twisted his hands together briefly, then dropped them in his lap. “Fine. I’ve got no idea. I just know what I feel.”
“After that we plan to spend a few days at Loango National Park in Western Gabon, even though it is almost entirely Muggle. Can you imagine?”
“Well, a good deal of it,” Mother said. “Africa is large, with tremendously varied geography. Dizon is quite proud to be African.”
"Well," Afelgate said, looking unhappy, "it doesn't have to be me in future. This is simple medimagic in theory. I suppose if someone in the house managed to contract something truly nasty…."
"That sucks," Harry said, trying to sound sympathetic. But he couldn't think of a single other thing to say.
“And I want you to know, as much as I enjoy this,” he started to pull his cock back, “it isn’t why I wanted Bergum to hire you.” Now he slid his cock back into Draco’s mouth, stopping just before the entrance to Draco’s throat. Prevented from speaking, Draco raised an eyebrow in question.
"Of course you do! Who wouldn't want them both? But I am sure that after a few days, or possibly a few weeks?" She looked Harry in the eyes and he thought he understood her now. "You'll be more able to tell us, at your leisure you understand, which of them you intend to keep for the full ten years."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"All right," Harry said simply, and looked at the Merchieftainess, who nodded, a huge grin on her face. "
"Yes, Harry." He stopped to pull his sleeve over his deformed hand. "I have finally obtained a memory that I think will be absolutely instrumental in the retrieval of a horcrux. Won't you sit down, and I'll explain?"
“It isn’t necessary,” Harry said, confusion on his face, “but watching this is probably super boring. I won’t be able to talk to you at all.”
"What do I owe you?" Harry's voice sounded as tight and uncomfortable as his trousers were beginning to feel. He hadn't been so uneasy, or so aroused, in longer than he could remember. Not that he was able to ponder timelines calmly at the moment.
The hug was very brief. Draco scarcely had time to figure out whether he should properly wrap his arms around Harry before the other man jumped away, bent his head once, almost like a little bow, and then spun off into thin air. His pop of Apparition was one of the quietest Draco had ever observed. Auror training, Draco supposed. Or maybe it just meant Harry wasn’t the least bit upset.

“Is teasing unkind?” Harry mused, smile beautiful and evil. Draco nodded and Harry laughed: low and warm.
"Well, he's a good man. He's a good auror, too. He even goes out drinking with us sometimes, tells us stories about shit that's gone down. Stuff he and the others have done."
Draco sighed. “You have a point.” He tried to think of how else to respond, but Harry made a small noise, as though he wanted to continue talking, so Draco waited.
“Just four?” Malfoy said, calm as a fucking cucumber. “And me with my… restless sleeping. I’d better masturbate, so I can fall asleep quickly.”
. He felt his guts twist and sicken, he felt his heart pound and leap toward her. He felt his hands tighten and strain behind his back.
“I’ve no interest in finding new space for my business, but we have options. For myself, I can continue to live here with you, date Harry, and see how that goes. Or, I could speak to Harry about moving in with him. It is… early for that. But in two or three months, I suspect it won’t be.
“I’ll prove it!” Draco yelped. He reached across the kitchen table, grabbed Harry’s collar, and hauled him in for a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss.
“Yes, that’s her word, Draco, but she was right and you know it. You just said the same thing yourself in different words!”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry's brain tried to explode. He fought not to shiver visibly. Malfoy would surely see it from that distance.
“I just, there was a time when I assumed that liking guys meant I had to be into anal,” Harry said. He eyes were unfocused now, like he was looking past Draco and through the blankets. “So I bought some lube and tried to like fingering myself.”
“The ketchup’s for Kreacher, actually,” Harry said. “He still likes to check in on the house when things are quiet at Hogwarts.”
“No,” Mother sighed. “Which means I am not sure how you came to feel differently. You rather worshipped him as a child.”
Some Auror did it instead. “Can’t tell you if she’s here, Rosscot, but if she is, she’ll be listening to every word you say. So,
“Well,” Draco said, determined. He stood and looked out Harry’s kitchen window at the gently sloping lawn, the enormous trees off in the distance. “Then I shall endeavor not to be, either.”
The line of bullshit he was spinning for Draco wasn’t complete bollocks. The likelihood anyone would look for them all the way out here was nearly nil. But, were Harry (and Robards) wrong about that, their ejaculate in the soil would make finding them frighteningly easy.
Harry sighed. Being an auror was very different from what he had expected. Perhaps if he, Neville, and Ron hadn't been allowed to fast track through so much of the training programme…. And yet, he wondered how he would have fared with the full Academy experience after all. At night, when they went out drinking, he heard things from his auror partner, Newland, and Ron's as well, that made the pre-War training programme sound a thousand times more boring and restrictive than even the worst year spent at Hogwarts.
So what if Harry wasn’t prepared to move any further into a romance with him? Draco understood. He was a convicted Death Eater, Mother was both homophobic and a terrible meddler, and — mundane but relevant — Draco worked ludicrously erratic hours running his mail order potions business nearly single-handed. He was hardly a catch.
“Butch is brilliant! I’ve had him almost two years. He’s ridiculously handsome, white and grey with piercing eyes. Really tall, too. He loves running with me every morning. Ginny took him in for me while we’re out here.” Harry laughed. “She tried to take him when we broke up, but I won that fight. He likes me more.”
The next time it happened, it was to Draco. “Where is that catalog I was reading a few hours ago?” he wondered aloud one evening.
Harry wanted them to hang out with his friends. (Draco was horrified at first. He saw Weasley all the time at work, but this was different!) But things changed after he apologized to Weasley and Granger, because Granger awkwardly apologized right back for that slap. Of course Draco refused to accept her apology because “you know I deserved that one, straight out.” Well, after all of that, spending time with Harry’s friends wasn’t actually that difficult anymore.
Harry stood quickly, leaning his back against the shower wall. Draco pressed forward and kissed him, then together they slid his cock back into Harry’s ready, tender hole. Pushing Harry up against the wall, Draco fucked him, nice and slow, alternating kisses with nips and grunts.
“What else then, Harry?” Draco said, still faking confidence. Truth be told, Harry’s words, his attention, were making this increasingly easy.
When he’d heard Pansy’s shoes click off up the corridor, Draco took Harry Potter by the hand and dragged him down the wrong way, toward the dead end where people rarely went.
"Yeah?" Harry said, wanting to know what Draco meant. It was always good when misery had some company.
“People believe all sorts of crazy shit,” Harry said. “From something you said earlier it sounds like Dean thinks Ginny and I had sex, even though we didn’t. And Dean and Ginny are

So Malfoy prepared him carefully. One finger, two, then three. They kissed and Harry squirmed and begged for more. Malfoy explained that hands and knees would probably be the most comfortable position but Harry was adamant. They would fuck face to face, just like the first time. So Malfoy lined up his cockhead and began to press into Harry, who winced and panted and grimaced and then, finally, nodded.
Muttering Latin under his breath, Scrivener began painting Malfoy's skin. He encouraged Harry to jump in with advice.
“You’re loud and you writhe and you squeeze my dick. You aren’t remotely scared to fuck my mouth deep and hard. You come like a river in flood. I definitely want sex. But that’s not everything I want.”
“Cursed Wards, Best Solutions,” Harry said. “I need to study it before I tackle a bizarre job I committed to for next week. Cover’s brown.”
“You brought it up once,” Harry agreed, wrapping his arms around Draco’s wet torso. “And while I don’t think I ever said anything negative about the idea, I can’t remember ever saying anything particularly encouraging, either. I sort of… figured that out today, when we were in the courtroom together.”

My wife, the Lady Narcissa, is already with child so my lands will have an heir to serve you and your line as a Lord is meant to serve his King. Draco Abraxas, however, is intended to serve my King on any level you wish, no matter how personal. Draco has trained under a talented Potions Master. He is fluent in French, German and Latin. His ability for Charms is impressive. He has a lovely singing voice, and plays beautifully both the viola and the harpsichord.

Harry trailed off and sighed again, enjoying the way Draco caressed his balls and varied the suction on his cock. “This is the very, very best part of my fortnight.” He took Draco’s head in his hands and finally began to fuck Draco’s face, driving in until his wild black pubic hair forced Draco’s eyes closed, then pulling out again.
Mother was fascinated by Draco’s newest adult/Muggle experience: the dry cleaner. Auror Maisuradze had convinced him to try it, he explained to Mother, who hung on his every word, her chicken and vegetables steaming merrily away, ignored under her fork. Natia’s mother was Muggleborn, and — according to Mrs Maisuradze — if you couldn’t get a stain out with the first two spells, you stopped trying and took the garment to a dry cleaner, before you ruined it. He’d spilled mustard on his best trousers in the Ministry cafeteria a few days before, and Natia was kind enough to recommend (and explain) a dry cleaner. Mother found the entire story fascinating, so Draco dragged it out as long as possible.
Malfoy leaned on hand on his desk. "We can't have light or loud noises in here right now." His voice was calm and confident. "I'm supposedly in bed with an upset stomach. Mother's already checked on me once, and she thinks I'm asleep. She won't bother me again unless she thinks I've woken up.
“I can think of a few ways to release tension,” Draco snickered; staring at his boyfriend’s arse as Harry bent to fill the bath.
Draco simply nods. His sincerity and qualifications are easy enough to prove, and he needs this job.
in that quaint little Inn with Harry Potter… well. He would obviously be a sight more passionate than that earnest, simpering war hero. Draco might technically still be a virgin, but he was nonetheless certain that he was simply one hot man from being the most fantastic lover imaginable. He contemplated taking his lube and dildo out from their hiding place under his pillow, but decided that could wait until he was fully hard. It took some work to get all the privacy enchantments off them both, and he didn’t feel like dealing with that right now.
"Er," Harry faltered. What had seemed so obvious when he was having sex suddenly seemed embarrassing and wrong. And yet… it wasn't exactly an avenue he wanted to cut off forever. "Sure. What bloke doesn't enjoy fucking a nice tight hole, right?" He grimaced. That was asinine, and now Malfoy would know he was a real queer; not just willing to accept blow jobs from willing boys. Malfoy didn't smirk at him though. Instead he looked a bit downcast.
As she looked at the ring he and Draco had brought all the way from Hogwarts, Harry saw the other ring on her finger. She was lovely and the two moonstones looked beautiful underwater, but Harry wanted to get the hell out of here, and soon. The atmosphere was nerve-wracking. He didn't like the looks the guards were giving each other, or the way two of them were blocking the doorway.
Narcissa dismissed this with a wave of one hand. “You’re a mother,” she said. “You never once violated Dora’s privacy in order to keep her safe? Never read her diary? Never did a blood spell to track her location? Never researched a friend’s father to make sure he wasn’t a pervert before your precious baby slept at someone else’s house?”
“That’s some sort of… contest?” Draco said. He cocked his head and Harry was seized with a desire to kiss his neck.
“I ask,” Draco said, and swallowed once, “because it is starting to feel very one-sided to me, and this, er, concerns me. As it were. I mean, yes. It concerns me.”
He’d been avoiding his Pensieve. He’d vowed not to view stolen memories. Hermione’s innocent words about “manners and honesty” had filled Harry with guilt. He’d shown Malfoy not a lick of either by thieving access to his nudity, memories of his body.

Nodding as though he agreed with Harry, as though he understood Harry, as though he was calm and collected about Harry standing in his kitchen – inviting him to visit
“For you to gently shoo me off,” Draco admitted. “I’m not an easy man for you to integrate into your life.” He was about to enumerate the thoughts he’d catalogued a moment before, but before he could, Harry laughed and kissed him again. “Easy is overrated,” he said, and he smiled.
“Shall we cut them in half and share both?” Harry said. Draco put the plates on the table and watched Harry use his wand to carefully split both muffins.
"Bitches always look better full of cock, little girl," the healer said, his voice dripping with superiority, and then he began to come inside her, making bellowing noises and quite putting Harry off his rhythm.
“Right,” Harry said. “But you know Neville, that might actually be the solution to your problem right there.”
He had Draco’s permission, he told himself. Therefore he wasn’t doing anything wrong by watching memories of them in bed together.
Finally, though, while Draco had ceased to pay attention to her, Granger had found the magic words that would usher him in and her out of Minister Potter’s large, handsome, deeply private office.

Now emotionally exhausted, fighting back tears, and despite the early hour, Draco fell asleep again. It was the easiest way to stop thinking about so many horrible possibilities.
Draco took a deep breath and stopped to look into Harry’s eyes, though he feared he would see pity. Instead, Harry looked… worried? Draco patted his face with the tissue, taking a deep breath and working to collect himself.
Draco found himself staring at his door for the umpteenth time, doing nothing of value, because he was so distracted.
“You’re right,” Draco frowned. “I should have been more conscious of their needs. Vissy,” he leaned forward, “how did you feel when you woke yesterday morning?”

“It’s purely about manners and honesty,” Hermione continued calmly. “If you don’t lead anyone on, it’s perfectly acceptable to go on various dates while you look for someone who appeals on multiple levels.”
“Keys and wards, both,” Draco answered, not sure what Harry meant. “It’s what the landlord recommends,” Draco mumbled, embarrassed. He stared at the scuffed floor of the creaky, old lift. No one else he knew used keys for manual, metal locks on their flat. Everyone else he still knew in London lived in a place that came with its own integrated warding, and when you rented a place you just added a few wards of your own, to personalize the feel, and perhaps fill in any cracks. Draco’s flat was too cheap, though, and his landlord nowhere near skilled enough.
“Well, circumcised or no, you’re more than large enough,” Draco says with approval as he strokes Anthony’s penis. It feels good in his hand. “What do you think of the uniform?” He doesn’t bother looking at Goldstein’s face. His dick is far prettier.
“I’ve excellent hearing,” Harry said, chagrin on his face. “Look, why don’t we just… tumble into bed,” Harry tried. “Get nerves outta the way. We can revisit upgrading your wards later.”
“Her invitation to visit Landers remains,” Draco said, leaning back into Harry’s wet embrace. His shoulder was a sturdy and comfortable shelf for the back of Draco’s head. His hand rested gentle and stable on Draco’s thigh. “I checked with Landers myself.”
Malfoy hummed an appreciative 'yes.' He slid a hand into the hair at the base of Harry's neck. "First, Potter, you should tip your head a little."
Andromeda’s smile suddenly shattered into a thousand jagged pieces. For one heartbreaking moment her face was wracked with pain. Her shoulders bent, and Draco saw the tears that threatened to fall.
The healer pulled multiple vials from a hidden robe pocket, and, casting swiftly, he magically extracted multiple substances from the slaves into the vials. The vials hung in the air and the healer cast spells at each of them. More words appeared on the two parchments, and Harry tried to read them, but it was all mumbo-jumbo to him. he turned to the healer with a question on his face.
"I'z will make sures Dudders learns this magic if he's does not already know it, Master Harry," Kreacher said. He looked quite pleased.
When Ginny then asked if he would father her and Luna’s kids, Harry hardly had to think. “I’m in!” he said. The three started house hunting together.

Draco put his wand down on the bedside table and walked the few steps to his quietly pouting lover. "I promise you are going to like this. I made a special trip to Whisper Alley today, and I bought some… things."
Anyway, if it’s weird to see me Boxing Day I understand. But I have a house-elf, so maybe you could come for dinner or tea or something? Christmas Eve is better for me. You can leave Draco home if that helps.
Harry kissed Malfoy's mouth again, amazed at the bizarre turn his life had taken and utterly unwilling to think about it right now.
“You belong to me, now,” Potter states with satisfaction, and then the room disappears into nothing as Potter
Grinding his arse into Harry’s erection, Draco milked the last drops of come from his cock as best he could while clothed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Young Master Black?” he inquired. Draco realized he might have found an ally to get him in and out of here without having to talk to Harry at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Shocked, Harry and Malfoy both twisted toward the Sorting Hat, which contorted itself into a painful-looking shape before once again opening to speak. "Your fault!" it yelped, and McGonagall tutted at it.
"What would that entail?" Harry said, finally sitting down. Grinning. "Would it humiliate them?" He grinned wider, to show the healer that he should please find a way to say yes, the exam would be humiliating.
Draco gave little thought to where he was going. He primarily knew he had to get away from his mother. So he was slightly surprised to find himself at Harry’s fence, being thoroughly checked out by Harry’s own Living Wards.
“If you let me stay,” Malfoy tried, “I won’t refuse you anything, not straightaway. We can… discuss it. I’ll consider anything.”
He wasn’t hungry, but the muffins looked sweet and fruity and delicious and he rather wanted that blueberry one, despite his earlier toast and egg. Not to mention, they were a gift. From
“I was wondering if you would consider moving into the Manor with me,” Draco finished. He exhaled then, quiet but obvious, and looked at the ceiling.
Draco’s mother didn’t cry long. Draco still had to spell his shoulder dry. Eventually she magicked her face free of puffiness and tears, looking anywhere but at Harry.

With permission from the Merchieftainess, that night they left their tent right where it was, and they slept at the edge of the village. In the morning they would hurry back to Hogwarts for more supplies, to seek advice, and to hopefully obtain a nice piece of jewellery.
For the life of him, he couldn’t imagine what he could possibly write to Blaise. It wasn’t as though he was going to chattily, charmingly relate the date he’d just turned away at his front door. Like Blaise would even believe him! And setting that aside, he hardly wanted to share this… development. He had no idea what it meant, where it was going, or what Harry really wanted. If Harry was looking for a hidden bit of arse on the side, Draco was hardly going to brag about being the one Harry thought he could dupe into that role.
(Saturday night, as a special Pride celebration for just the two of them, Harry had agreed they could try something new in bed. But that wasn’t for anyone else to know about. Still, Draco kept remembering their plans at odd moments and smiling.)
When Harry woke, his little fire had burned down low, and he watched dancing shapes on the walls for a moment, before casting a gentle cleansing spell on Draco’s flaccid cock.
“I can’t decide between Margate and Brighton, Draco. Why are you all the way over there? I need your help.”
"Of course those weren't my real reasons, you old cow! I can't believe you fell for all my bullshit! Everyone knows how I feel about that horrid little bastard!"
“I’m definitely willing to do anal,” Malfoy said quickly. “I wouldn’t be here otherwise. You were…” he winced again. “clear.”
The next thing he knew, he'd started tugging on Harry, pulling him to turn over, to lie on top of Draco, to rub his cock against Draco's cock - still trapped inside his fancy, silky shorts.
Draco swallowed several sentences about how Harry had obviously been dressed and ready to grasp the Portkey for a long time before he actually had. Harry was here. That was what mattered.
"My life is no longer of very much importance." Harry's felt his eyes prick painfully with tears, his mouth fill with denials. He remained silent out of respect, but he wished he could convince the headmaster how wrong he was.
“Really?” Harry said, playing along. “Those are terribly rare! Hardly anyone knows how to do those properly.”
Leaning carelessly, comfortably against his inner doorway, Harry ticked answers off with his fingers. “It’s 8 at night, you slept almost four hours, and you don’t need to make anything up to me. You clearly needed a nap, so think of the… accommodations as my present to you.
Overwhelmed and embarrassed, Harry surrendered to his own subconscious, and knocked on Draco’s door.
“Harry?” Draco tried, wincing at the nerves that made his voice break. Why wouldn’t Harry sit down and say something already? Draco was getting desperate to know what Harry thought about his apologies, his attempts to start making things right. He did not require approval, but he did want it.
“It’s disgusting in here, I know,” Harry frowned. “But it’s why I can Apparate in here?” He scratched uncertainly at his hair. “No one ever uses it? Come on.” He pushed the door open. “Let’s get some crisps and stuff.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry illuminated the hole in the wards, now enlarged to a stretchy, elasticized rip. Narcissa’s aggressor had entered via the attic, where house elves spent little time.
"Still," Draco said slowly, "I think we can go faster than we were yesterday." He swallowed, and Harry watched his Adam's apple bob.
Afelgate clearly loved tutoring Harry, and he launched into another explanation. "The virgins thing is because you're a national hero, and it is assumed that you deserve virgins. That's just ancient ideas, ancient understandings of what men prefer. We can easily make sure that a girl isn't already pregnant with another man's child before allowing her into your bed, though. Even you can do that. It's just a simple version of a revealing spell.
“I am in charge. I won’t push a bride on him. Love matters in marriage. His father’s rules no longer apply. He should seek happiness. And that dating literally
Kreacher nodded and held his wrinkled little hands out toward the slaves. A tape measure appeared and danced around first Parkinson, then Malfoy. It vanished, then Kreacher bowed and vanished as well.
Harry brushed snow from Draco’s hair and took his arm. “Let’s get out of this weather,” he said, then
"Riddle, of course, wanted only your father's money, influence, power and loyalty. Riddle was the most selfish creature ever born. He had no interest in your father's love, and in the bedroom he never gave a thing, only took. But by then your stupid, shame-filled father was so desperate for anything that he took what Voldemort gave him and then did his dirty bidding."
“I will not marry a woman, Mother. I will not put aside my entire self. I may sire heirs someday, but not upon a wife. And if the husband I eventually choose fought for the other side, you will endure even that. Am I clear?”
It was even weirder when Head Auror Bergum stopped by his desk on his way out the door, roughly patted his shoulder, and said something about what a good job he’d been doing lately. “Potter speaks very highly of you,” he said, and Draco nodded once, feeling his face flame. Then Bergum
“Then please, go fuck your way through my harem, enjoy the whore I’ve had tucked into your bed, and leave Potter here with me to enjoy his reward. I will see you at breakfast tomorrow, and I expect you to have a very large smile on your face.”
The house-elves at her favorite restaurant always knew just how to treat Mother like their most valuable customer, and it wasn’t long before they were seated at a very private table overlooking a tiny fountain. A talking frog took their lunch order and vanished, and Draco saw Mother almost imperceptibly deflate.
A terrible, amazing thought entered Harry's mind. Draco had an arsehole. He wanted to fuck it. It was probably tight and hot, and it was hidden between Malfoy's long elegant legs, inside the curves of Malfoy's tight, round, high arsecheeks. Which apparently some covert piece of Harry's brain had been noticing for a while.
“Harry,” Draco tried again. He wrung his hands, then forced them into his pockets. He was going to face this like an adult. “Does this relationship feel one-sided to you?”
“That’s… microscopic,” Harry said. He’d chased hours before discerning the perforation in Draco’s wards.
Draco put his hands on his hips and looked Potter in the eye. “I understand that you’re much too much of a goody two-shoes to call someone a
"Nah," he said. "Not yet. Not till I understand!" His own voice was bizarrely cheerful and as he pondered this additional detail he lost his balance and fell fully onto Malfoy.
He put his head on the table. If anyone knows how unfair, how judgmental, how reactionary the wizarding world is, it’s Harry. He’s been judging the Malfoys unfairly. Draco deserves a chance to prove himself.
“Coffee?” Draco murmured from the doorway. He leaned against Harry’s wall: rumpled, shoeless and squinting. His mussed hair emphasized that his pajama top was buttoned askew.
"If it came to that, Harry, I don't believe young Mr. Malfoy would kill me. But I would let it come down to the wire, shall we say, in order to give him the opportunity to save his own soul. Voldemort will kill him - and his mother as well - if he fails. Now that we have this memory, I think we may be able to bring him to our side. I've had no hope of that, until now.
She looked at him sideways but chose not to engage any further. It was rare that Draco fell behind on schoolwork, but not unheard of. Draco was grateful for the reprieve from her probing, and even more grateful for the brill prevarication he’d thrown out on the fly. It gave him the perfect excuse to retire to his bed and seal himself inside his curtains, under cover of a good bit of spellwork. Once they got back to Slytherin he made quick work of getting his teeth brushed and his pyjamas on, then kissed Pansy goodnight on the top of her silky brown head, nodded to Theo and Blaise, and shut himself up inside his curtains with his Transfigurations books and a large blank roll of parchment.
Draco shook his head. “No, he was… uh, supportive. And, but… you asked me out in front of Weasley. And Robbe. And you let my neighbor, Franklin, see you as we got into the lift.”

“You’re talking to a bloke who didn’t know how to slice his own damn tomato,” Draco pointed out, and ate another tidy bite.
Harry sat on the wide stone windowsill and looked out. He could see two people flying toward the Quidditch pitch. One streamed a pennant of red hair.
Gulping, Harry reached over with his left hand and tried to find Draco's… his mind skittered away from the word like a cockroach away from light.
"With a proposal, an offer of some sort," Harry jumped in. "I've been holding that thing in my pocket for hours and it had no effect on Snape. I think I have to do more than take the ring from another's hand. I think we have to recreate the original mess as well as possible."
“Was dinner edible?” Draco asked after Mother left. She would expect them to join her, but they could take a few minutes alone. “I could hardly taste it, I was so distracted.”
“Tonight is for comfort. Relaxing. A hot bath, a full glass of wine. You and your Mum have been through quite a lot. You won. Now it’s time to release some tension.”
Draco ran his fingers through his hair and then marveled at his own lack of control. He had not allowed Harry to see him so disheveled since the night he'd spent vomiting up his fears.
“I mustn’t speak while you’re masturbating,” Harry’d warned, blushing but stern. “You can say anything, unless you make it clear I’m in the room.” He’d swallowed, closed his eyes in a long blink before continuing. “Or touching you.”
“You are so fucking cute,” Harry said, as though it was an answer. “You don’t like being vulnerable, do you?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“I, er, okay,” Draco finally said. “Uh, I mean, I am completely freaked out and surprised, but you make good, uh, points? About other people and about, uh, yourself? So, yeah. Okay.”
But Mouth had pulled a silken nightie out of her trunk, and that was a simple thing for her to slip on over her head.
Much as he genuinely did like her, Harry wasn’t going to mind Narcissa being away all that much, either.
The elder failed to hide her wince. "Yes, of course you could. But we are grateful that you've chosen not to."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Malfoy paused and stared into space, his face a complete blank. When he spoke again his voice was small. He sounded eleven again. "It is almost winter break. When I go home for Yule I could search for it but…." Malfoy suddenly drew himself up, garnered from somewhere a look of tenuous authority, nervous dignity. "Headmaster. Can I speak to you alone?"
Malfoy's hand and cock on Harry's cock was like nothing he'd ever imagined. Malfoy's hand was firm and strong, but Malfoy's cock was silken and hard against his own. Two cocks meant twice as much pre-come. And all the while their tongues danced and teased and tasted. It wasn't long before Harry found himself panting quietly "gonna come, please don't stop, gonna come…."
Harry looked murderous. “After the horrible things you’ve done to me? Where the fuck have you been for the entirety of this relationship?”
"This should not be a surprise," Severus had mused. Then he stood up and began to move around the room. "I should really have seen this coming. And I don't begrudge you this, Draco, certainly not. He's not the oddest choice at all," Severus had snarked before Draco could respond. Draco wondered if Severus had guessed correctly. He had.
“Please,” Draco managed, and he thought he could not possibly have been heard, but Potter nonetheless was pulling his trousers and pants down, bending him over, putting Draco’s hands on the enormous mirror, and sliding his cock into his already prepared arsehole in one, slick, fast shove.

They were powerless in the throes of this mutual fit of laughter when McGonagall found them. Harry saw her feet and tried to regain control. Malfoy succeeded first but not by much. Smiling, tired, they both clambered back up onto opposite benches at the Ravenclaw table and apologized to the headmistress.
Harry walked toward his lover's voice. "Tiger, I'm hungry," he whined. "I had a really rotten day and I want to eat and rest. Where's my dinner?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry wrapped his right hand around his own leaking, throbbing need, and then he turned within the nest of Draco's body and leaned his head sideways on Draco's shoulder. "I know you want to watch, but I really want to kiss you. Can I just warn you when I'm about to come?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“I could have… should’ve been more forceful. More honest. More insistent that Mother accept my sexuality.”
“I have your Living Wards to thank for that,” Draco said dryly. “I couldn’t possibly keep her from the property without them.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“I’d like very much for us to be ‘boyfriends’,” Draco said. “Though it feels a bit odd to use that word. We’re no longer boys.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"There are potential solutions to the problem of the ending of your line. I've been thinking about it myself, since I realized I wasn't going to be able to find it within myself to marry a woman. There's adoption, surrogacy-"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry let Draco enjoy the scratching for a good five minutes before he cleared his throat. “Er, so, I was wondering if you’d be willing to go out with me later. On a date. In public.”
Uncomfortable with the silence, Harry broke it. “It can’t be about casting spells. You’re ace in all our classes. I think you’re going to beat Hermione’s marks in Transfiguration.”
“We’re certain it was him,” Neville explained, “because aside from an imprint he left along the edges of the breach he created in your attic, all the remaining house wards were purely Malfoy. And very old.”
Then he walked over and reached out with his right hand. Neville raised his own right, as if to shake, but Harry shook his head, smiling his amusement, and reached for Neville’s left. Then, he didn’t let go.
Harry’s known Draco since they were eleven. For years, one of the first words he would use to describe Draco would be “elegant.” From Hogwarts, Harry had seen elegance in Draco’s flight, his walk, his hands, the flow of his clothes and the turn of his phrase. But he’d also seen arrogance, bigotry, bullying.
“We have chosen a sentence. You are hereby – ” he pauses to bang an enormous gavel, but Draco does not flinch, or even blink – “sentenced to serve as the Golden and Exalted Savior’s catamite!”
"Well," Afelgate said, reaching for her breasts, caressing them eagerly, one in each hand now, "your tits are spectacular." He was significantly taller than Mouth, and he looked down past her face at her breasts. "But I might actually prefer your arse. Won't you lean down here on the table and let me get a good look at it?"
"We need to get moving," Harry sighed. "We won't both fit in that shower. I can drive for a bit while you get cleaned up if you'll take over for me as soon as you can? I really want to get this stupid mission over with."
“I don’t think I understand,” Harry said, but Draco thought he saw in the sadness in Harry’s eyes; Harry actually understood better than he liked.
“Yeah, I think we should. Let’s be all mature and whatnot,” Draco said with a self-deprecating smile. Let’s… define the relationship.”
“You didn’t have to do all this for me, for a… deception,” Neville said as he removed the cap from his cider bottle and tasted it. A smile skittered across his face.
“Second of all, I forgave you for that a long time ago. You saved my life, Potter, don’t you remember? And I was, that day in the bathroom….”
Most important of all, though, was that since Neville was himself a war hero, he didn’t look at Harry with starry eyes. He never asked Harry questions about the war. And never once gushed out a teary ‘thank you.’
“Which is a good thing,” he said as he stood. He was back in control and felt perfectly steady. “Because you are clearly, still, a catastrophe-in-waiting, not to mention a nasty snake. You’ve shown me today you are selfish, lustful, and probably a bad father. Your sheer lack of scruples disgust me. I hope your poor wife deserves you. I am quite sure Scorpius does not. I know that I no longer do.”
The department had emptied out, as it generally did this late of a Friday. Nonetheless Draco remained at his desk, wanting to complete absolutely everything he could before he left for the weekend. Even still, he had very little left to do.
"Oh," Merchieftainess Murcus said, looking honestly miserable. "What horrible news. He made overtures to us after he became headmaster of the school. He took the trouble to come down here, told us the whole story of the war, informed us of Headmaster Dumbledore's death, warned us against Voldemort's armies and helped us protect ourselves should the war come underwater. He was a very fine man. A very good wizard."
“Then, I’ll levitate us, and cast a slow spinning charm. The first one to come does the dishes while the other man fucks him.”
Harry found that while she might just, he could not. Speaking was out of the question. The miserable heat spread to his collarbone and below. Thank Merlin for the high neck on formal robes.
“Yeah!” Harry agreed, taking chicken and potatoes. “He misses us in class, but he’s excited about several first years who love the animals he’s teaching, and McGonagall told him he’s doing a great job.”
“So,” Draco said, falsely bright. “We’ve had enough stress for today. I shall sleep at Harry’s. It will give you an opportunity to consider your feelings; perhaps make a decision without me about, making you feel pressured.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Well," Harry said, and gave Draco a crooked smile. "I guess it depends how you want to define 'wrong.' I've saved a lot of lives, but my supervisor tells me that I could have saved pretty much every one of those lives without simultaneously ruining evidence, giving away stealth operations, breaking laws, knocking over colleagues, and risking my own skin. It seems like I'm forever on probation. Always getting yelled at. Forever on the verge of getting demoted somehow.
Instead, Draco tried hard to rescue Harry from himself, but all he managed was a tiny, broken, squeaking noise which did not deserve to live.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Kreacher!" he called, and Kreacher appeared from around the corner. His eyes got enormous, but he said nothing.
Taking note of everyone's position, Harry let go of Draco's hand, nodded at him, and moved a few feet closer to the door.
Harry’s wank bank was set for the rest of his life. He would never need to jerk off outside his Pensieve again.
She sighed and sipped her own tea. “I’m sorry,” she said eventually. “I’m out of practice with Slytherin and House of Black… methods. Nonetheless, I am your aunt, I am your ally, and I want to hear everything.”
and coming as fast as he could. But he took a moment to imagine touching Malfoy's shoulder-length hair. Immediately, he felt his dick begin to harden and his face begin to flush -- first with excitement, then with embarrassment. He wished he still had the paper on his lap. That was all Tory papers were good for, really. Hiding perverted erections.
There was just one thing left in Draco’s brain, and it fell out of his mouth without consideration. “Of course you’re a top. You’re Harry Potter. How could you not be a top?”
. Harry had decided to try it all out very slowly. So far he hadn't even tried one new option each day, and this is what his slaves defaulted to wearing otherwise.
It was a matter of little difficulty to find the public Floo they had used some days before when they had arrived, but as they stood in line to use it, Harry couldn't help but feel the two of them had unfinished business they should talk over before they headed back to Hogwarts.
if he was to employ a worthy tutor in any of the more obscure classes he wanted to continue with, like Runes and Alchemy.
Harry poured the noodles into a big metal colander. Water splashed through, into the sink. Draco stared like it was magic.
“Vissy?” Narcissa called, and the house-elf appeared with a full tea tray. She put it between them all, on a small table; bowed and vanished.

Draco finally fits himself over the erection he’d painstakingly chosen for his evening’s pleasure. “You may touch my cock,” he says, after he’s adjusted. Harry takes Draco in hand and strokes in time with Draco’s rhythm. “Caress my arse,” Draco orders, and Harry obeys. “Move in time with me,” Draco pants as he speeds up. Harry begins to push his cock into Draco as Draco pushes his arse down around Harry. “You… may… kiss… me….” Draco manages, leaning forward, and Harry kisses him.
They ignored each other all the way to Lecce, mostly by trading off "eating" in the café-bar. They spoke only of logistics as they collected their luggage, took a taxi to a tiny, half-deserted hotel on the shore, and disillusioned themselves and all their stuff when they'd finally managed to feel alone.

“I’m a perfectly regular wizard,” Draco said, calmly, though he was annoyed. “But it’s not that simple. It’s called sexism, Mother, and it’s not only straight men who have built this sexist world.”
“Waterproof lube?” Draco said, because whatever Harry said, this felt like it was about to become anal sex, and he was… not opposed.
Draco inhaled, working to stay calm. Mother’s progress was so fast, he feared getting whiplash. “Mother,” he said. “Thank you.”
“Better,” Harry said, then went back to trailing fingertips along the smooth, warm skin of his new prize.

Harry glowed at him. Glowed! Draco stared dumbly back for a moment before breaking eye contact. This was shaping up to be the oddest day Draco had experienced in... years, probably.
“That is good,” Harry agreed. “But you shouldn’t be here, either.” He checked his watch. “It’s too late to get a hotel. Stay at mine tonight.”
“I think it’s time we,” Draco said, but Harry wrapped a hand around Draco’s erection and Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head.
So it went. Harry continued to lie carefully, casually, (not frequently!) about Draco’s “sleep talk;” Draco seemed increasingly convinced. Harry mentioned it in the shower, over squares of toast, as they walked each other to class.
From the sitting room, if one didn’t wish to enter the kitchen, one had three whole doors to choose from: the bathroom, the bedroom, and the tall cupboard where he hung his only coat. The bathroom was also accessible from the bedroom, which Draco still thought was rather a clever use of such a small space.
"Wow," one of his slaves said quietly, and Harry just lay limply in Hole's arms, feeling them both stroke him gently. The gems chimed their way into Hole's hourglass and Harry opened an eye. Five gems he had promised for an orgasm, and five gems had found their happy way into the bottom of Hole's hourglass. But being rimmed, might just, as it turned out, be the best way to come in the entire universe. "Eight gems for licking my arsehole until I come," Harry said weakly, and the gems obeyed his command.
"Why should I give you the other ring at all?" King Greynrushes said. "My wife likes it." He turned to look at the mermaids. "Don't you?"
“As my Lord wishes,” Goldstein says, a bit breathlessly, and he strides off toward the boy’s section of Draco’s harem, looking at Draco once, over his shoulder.
“Perhaps with more time on your hands,” McGonagall said, “you’d like something to soak that up, give you less time to chew on this.”

She: the foul mouth, the obsequious attitude for Malfoy that morphed into contempt for all others, the willingness to throw Harry - and the whole world - to the wolves.
“I… no.” Draco said. “I think the opposite. Would you require large quantities of these bodily fluids?”
"I'll help," Flitwick said, and threw a soot removal spell at Harry over his shoulder as he opened the door. "You're wanted immediately in the headmistress' office!"
Draco had blanched. He felt it happen. He knew well that when a man as pale as he reacts that way, he appears to have become suddenly ill. Most alarming. Apparently, Severus had never seen Draco blanch, and he'd immediately grabbed the whiskey glass from Draco's hand and conjured a cold, wet flannel for Draco's forehead.
“Men such as they, believe women weaker.” She took up a teacup and drank, clearly taking comfort in the familiar.

Most Aurors read people well, but Harry was the best. And he clearly should have been paying more attention, because Draco was wound like an overburdened spring.
“You mean it?” Harry said. When Draco nodded shyly he stopped talking and starting taking charge. He kissed Draco, caressed one of Draco’s arse cheeks, lifted Draco’s left leg to pull it around his waist, and pushed the dildo back in once. He watched Draco’s jaw go slack and eyes unfocus. Then he pulled the dildo out, took his own cock in hand, whispered a protection spell Draco had read about, and began to rub the hard tip of  his dick into the sensitive rim of Draco’s arsehole.
Draco merely emitted that weird squawk noise again, and waved one hand, as though the motion communicated something.
"I see the thoughts blooming poisonously in your mind. With knowledge of your soul and heart only, Draco,
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
At one point he muttered an excuse and hurried to the water closet, only to return to a room that glowed with so many golden threads of magic criss-crossing from ceiling to floor and wall to wall that he wasn’t sure he could safely reenter.
"Harry, for the past two months I have been trying to live my life without stepping blindly into traffic or accidentally Floo-ing myself off to Liberia. All I can think about is you, and us, and what could have been. What I hope I haven't lost all chances of having."
At that, Draco gave Harry a smile and sat in the navigator's seat. "Happy to," he said simply, and helped Harry see that they were a few feet off track and it was getting worse.
Over and over they played this “game” with Teddy’s gummy, damp stuffed rabbit. Dozens of times Teddy chewed it, threw it, then giggled as Draco floated it back to him through the air.
"At least, not both of them at once. The pallets should be clean, on the floor, and only just large enough. Oh, and they should be able to see one another, but set up the magic to not only shackle them into bed, but prevent masturbation. And silence the area as well. I won't have them chatting together at night while I sleep." Dudders nodded and popped into thin air. Harry didn't notice.
Draco blinked. He looked at Harry. Harry squeezed his hand, but stayed quiet. Draco paused, but Mother merely waited, gazing peaceably out the window.
“Our door’s the experiment,” Harry said, sighing. “I have to learn how to do this! Also, er, I need to warn you.” He fidgeted with a teaspoon Bippy had left behind, looking at it instead of Draco’s face. “Once I finish, there’s a chance I’ll need to redo our Living Wards.” Harry blushed.

Hermione was skeptical. Ron was downright upset. Neville was confused, while Luna was just… missing. George raised an eyebrow and walked away. Molly seemed to think he couldn’t tell she was being condescending. Arthur wanted to change the subject. Ginny couldn’t stop laughing at him long enough to give an opinion.
Certainly, he could buckle down, and only study hard until N.E.W.T.s were over. But he didn’t want to. School was not merely for learning skills and achieving high marks. School was for networking. Making connections. Impressing the right people. Finding the right wife.
"I'm so fucking sorry." Harry said, astonished that he'd never really said any such thing until he was balls deep into the other boy.
"Certainly, Kreacher can," the elderly house elf said, and he narrowed his eyes briefly and tipped his head very slightly to the left.
"Harry Potter is exactly the right choice for you. For a whole annoying multitude of reasons." Severus had suddenly twisted where he stood and gave Draco a careful evaluation. "Unless he doesn't return your feelings. In which case I shall disembowel him." Draco shook his head, trying not to look miserable.
On Saturday, Draco hid inside his bed curtains all day. He did homework, ate food he’d managed to hoard under stasis charms, napped on and off, and successfully avoided everyone. Eventually though, it was well after midnight and he felt grotty and restless. Surely Potter had been asleep for a long time by now? He snuck off to the Prefect’s Bath in a dressing gown.
“You got under my skin,” Harry said, staring into Draco’s eyes. “You were constantly on my mind. No, I didn’t like you back then, but I didn’t even know I was bisexual back then. I was a stupid kid and I didn’t understand… like… anything. I like to think I’m a lot smarter now.” He smiled warmly at Draco, who couldn’t think of a blessed thing to say in response except —
Harry's abs were not visible - at least when Harry was in this relaxed half-sitting position - but Draco could find them under the skin.
“Right,” Draco said, by now rather desperate to make this anguished mess of ‘conversation’ end, “so, er, I’ll see you at work on Monday, obviously….”
Harry rolled onto his back just so Draco would crouch over him. Reaching up, Harry stroked Draco’s messy locks from his eyes.
"Me?" Harry said, his blood pressure rising enjoyably as he warmed to an old, familiar task. "I had nothing to do with you being in on this bullshit and you fucking well know it! It's your precious, coddling, arsehole, head-of-house Snape who called the both of us to solve his pathetic little problem! It sure as fuck wasn't me! I wouldn't call for your help with anything!"
Potter sighs happily, so Draco takes Potter’s cock well into his mouth, getting the man as wet as possible. Then, with his left hand wrapped firmly around the lower half of Potter’s erection, he jerks Potter off and sucks hard on the rest, enjoying the slightly bitter precome that begins to drip from the end of Potter’s dick. “Hmmmm,” he hums loudly, and Potter moans in pleasured surprise.

“The enemy is ensnared.” Draco arced his wand in an enormous gesture and the entire display glowed purple before vanishing. “We can go home.”
So, his house arrest complete, his new, perfectly decent (if unattractive) Ukrainian wand obtained (at newly challenging cost), and every potential potions apprenticeship apparently closed to him, Draco had begun to look for work. Two things soon became clear. One, the Ministry was his only real option. No private employer would hire someone Marked. No matter it was faded to a thin grey shadow. Not even for “back of house” jobs where the public wouldn’t have to see or interact with him. Two, while the Ministry might have this “initiative” that was supposed to smooth the way for young “offenders” like Draco to get a job, every department head nonetheless had a “not in my backyard” approach. Every interview led, not to a second interview in that department, but to a job listing for some
Harry stood silently for a moment, his hand suddenly heavy on Draco's shoulder. "Then I have an idea," he finally said.
Once he was ready for bed, and sealed up within it, it took him all of thirteen minutes to complete the second half of his Muggle Studies assignment. He even did a thorough outline of his next Charms essay while he was at it, and read ahead two chapters in his Potions textbook for good measure. But when he was done, it was still only eight forty five in the evening, and he grinned as he hid his books away. The promise of a powerful orgasm was a strong motivator. He was done for the night
Draco crawled up Harry and pulled him into his arms. Harry simply molded into Draco's embrace and sighed with happiness.

"Anything," Malfoy whispered, and Harry put his lips on Malfoy's neck and -licking and biting -- rubbed against Malfoy's crotch with his own until he was hard as a rock, and then until Malfoy came decisively and loudly, his legs snaked tightly around Harry's arse. Then he kept rubbing until his own orgasm exploded through him, a bullet train rushing through his spine and belly, right through his balls and entire dick.
why I’m willing to give you a chance,” Weasley continued. “Because your apology was decent enough, but I can tell you actually meant it. That’s the part that really matters.”
Draco was almost dismayed to learn that whilst naked, Harry had not only a cock, but kisses, hands, words, teeth and … a whole body, really. With lots of warm skin, strong muscles, big hands and loud appreciation for Draco’s beauty, tightness, heat and pretty mouth. Thus making naked Harry a great deal more sexually satisfying than a mere dildo.
Andromeda nodded, then scooped macaroni and cheese onto each of the four, square melamine plates she’d had Harry take from the cupboard. Harry could no longer see Thomas the Tank Engine smiling up cheekily from them. “Get the peaches, please,” she told him. Frustrated, Harry obeyed.
Then he found the spot he was looking for, under Draco's balls. He pushed a wet finger there, and Draco sighed happily. Encouraged, Harry circled it and kissed Draco's mouth. He realized he could probably kiss Draco a lot and still push a wet finger in, so he tried it, and it worked perfectly. They kissed and touched, getting hard again, dripping some pre-come on each other, and at Draco's request, Harry pushed a second finger in, and then a third.
“The better you do at this,” Granger said pointedly as she pushed him toward the door, “the less time you’ll spend cooling your heels in this anteroom on Monday.”
"Can you empty my bladder for me? My erection is kind of getting in the way, and I don't really feel like getting out of bed right now."
“There you are!” she called up, hours later. “I was not aware you still enjoyed your treehouse, darling. Dybbin nearly ironed his ears when he could not tell me your location.”
must listen. Put this nonsense aside. Marry, beget an heir. The line must continue. A son is your greatest responsibility.”
"You're incorrigible," Draco said, but he leaned in to steal a kiss, and Harry gave it to him enthusiastically, not caring who might see.
“It’s just that… I see you looking at me all the time. I don’t know what it means and I feel sort of stupid.” Harry looked back at the floor. “You are so beautiful, you make me stupid.”
Harry wanted them to spend time with Draco’s Aunt Andromeda, and the orphan she was raising: Draco’s newest cousin, Harry’s little godson. They ate dinner there. They even tried watching Teddy together once, but Draco was so terrified of taking full responsibility for a baby (even temporarily) that Harry never suggested it again. Thank Merlin.
Draco raises his head and looks at the Captain of his Guard. The new uniforms are exactly as Draco had ordered. Intimidating, masculine, and (dare he say it) sexy. “Turn around, Weasley,” Draco says in his most indolent voice. That one particularly annoys the Captain of his Guard.
“Bippy! Damn, that fucker really struck a blow,” Draco growled. Bippy appeared and Draco didn’t bother asking after her health. “Bippy, fetch medical attention. For yourselves.”
"Basically, Mr Potter, what that says is that they are both in very fine health. For a more thorough examination, however," Afelgate said, now looking slightly embarrassed, "I'll need to put down my wand and use my hands."
“Bippy even brought food through, and it was fine.” Harry’s face opened into a huge grin. “It’s good, Draco. Everything worked just like the spellbooks laid out. I did it all right the first time. We can live in both houses now.”

“It must have been Muggles, though, right? Because if it were witches or wizards you probably wouldn’t have been able to keep it out of the paper? That’s what Parvati thinks, and it makes sense.”
They would be in Lecce fairly soon, and then he and Malfoy would have to sneak their bizarre little craft into the Mediterranean and spend a few days together trying to figure out what to expect from King Greynrushes and how to get him to do what they wanted. All alone in a tiny little submarine with nothing to distract them from one another.
Malfoy sounded slightly unsure. "I… there are a few things it might be. I'm not willing to do this alone. I want help."
“Imagine instead, Grandfather insisted you marry some woman. Imagine Grandfather subjected you to dangerous spells, untested potions, so you might be able to respond to her sexually.”
A Wensleydale and a Stilton. Boxes of flavoured crackers. Marinated artichoke hearts in a glass jar. Three kinds of olives: one black, two green. Cashews. Pistachios. Prawn crisps. Bags of cheddar popcorn. Doritos. Hummus. Four kinds of packaged biscuits. Jaffa cakes.

Harry nodded. “Or even just recording us talking, choosing what to do next. That would be kind of boring to watch.”
“Let’s spend some time,” Malfoy said, ignoring Harry’s face. “We could stay up late, talk, see what develops. I know what you wanted, before. I’d be up for something more mutual this time, as long as it wasn’t, y’know, fucking.” He blushed deeply, in spite of himself.
“So that’s everything,” Draco finished. “Mother is still homophobic, I’m still her devoted son.” He slugged back the last of his whiskey. “To a point.”
No matter how big or small the penis in question, Draco was nowhere near ready to have anyone actually ejaculate in his mouth — or the reverse, frankly — not even Harry. Which, thankfully, Harry accepted with grace and kisses and no reproof. Instead, Harry wanted to press Draco down into the bed again, this time with their lubed-up cocks rubbing against one another, and their stomachs, and their balls…. Draco made a huge, embarrassing mess all over Harry when he came.

He levitated his recordings into the air. There was last night’s sex, and last night’s sleep-talk — if he’d even said anything in his sleep last night. He’d rushed Harry away before he thought to ask.

Harry gently put his hand on Draco's shoulder and nowhere else. It was a small touch, yet it filled Draco's entire body with warmth, and he stiffened throughout in response. The touch both began an erection and made him uncomfortable, but he refused to ask Harry to let go. As comforting as the warmth was, it was also arousing. Yet despite his growing erection, Draco refused to give into his urge to ask Harry to leave.
He was on his side, relaxing on the bed, his mouth inches from Harry's upper thigh. He put his hand just above Harry's knee and exhaled gently against Harry's skin. "I'm not ready to take these underclothes off yet, Harry, but if it isn't too much to ask, I want to watch you come."
“Senegal?” Harry asked quietly, still holding Draco in his arms. Draco nodded. “It was a great avoidance tactic,” Draco said. “Senegalese who want to emigrate to Europe all go to France, for legal and linguistic reasons. I was never going to find a life partner there.”
"She failed too many N.E.W.T.s and returned to try again," the elder explained. "She thought the Carrows would be lenient. They were, we weren't."

), and blearily pulled on a dressing gown before opening the window. It waited patiently while Harry fumbled the rolled letter off its leg. It didn’t nip Harry’s fingers or beg for a snack.
Draco tipped his head and stared. “It’s… unusual,” he finally said. “You’re the first person I’ve met who does that. Who doesn’t live in my building, I mean.”
"Or the part," Malfoy added, "where they pulled a star auror out of the field to shut up some suits of armour." He turned and grinned nervously at Harry, but Harry couldn't help but scowl.
Draco suddenly needed to sit down, so he reached up to his shoulder and took Harry's hand in his own. Then he led them both the few steps back to the table where the food had all gone quite cold. He sat, still holding Harry's hand, and smoothed his robes over his thighs. "Please, explain."
“We should take this conversation elsewhere,” Draco said, and he rose – feeling as though he’d replaced his spine with an iron rod. He felt as stiff and hot as if he were ill with fever. His blood raced hard through his veins. He couldn’t think clearly.
“I think so,” he whispered, and pulled his hands from Draco’s hair. From the kind of gentle scratching Narcissa had lulled Draco to sleep with when he was small, Harry switched to petting Draco’s face, then chest. He kissed Draco’s forehead. He whispered something sweet.
He paused. “I can take your shoes off? I’ll put the socks inside, so they don’t get lost in my mess.”
As the door slipped shut silently, Draco felt himself blush again. Harry had heard! He’d nearly admitted—! But Harry didn’t look alarmed at all.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Nothing by halves, eh Potter? Yes. Look, we’ve both been awful. I think we’ve both managed to make up for a lot of it, though. Quite a bit of back and forth directly between us over the years, yes? Not to mention all the other… shite.” He shuffled his feet as Harry stared.
"Nah," Harry said recklessly. "That'd be better than your smelly socks!" Then, to show that he was a good sport, he tried to turn himself around, instead of just expecting Malfoy to do it.
Draco took another sudden step backwards, smacking his arse against the worktop. He ran his hands through his hair. He decided to say yes.
“I do not know why you are so damn amused,” Draco sniffed, but he knew his little smile would give him away.
The next prisoner was a dumpy girl with spots and thick, curly blonde hair. Harry stared at her face for a few moments before realizing she had been on the inquisitorial squad with Pansy. Except… wasn't she a sixth year then? "Isn't she a year too old?" he asked the elder.
“Clever drawing,” Draco said, amused. “But with the blackguard in Azkaban, what is my need for such expensive, aggressive wards? I’ve heard they can be pugnacious, that they can attack invited guests. Even harm servants.”
Draco breathed in deep, through his nose: slow, slow, slower, until his quivery lungs felt they could burst. Then he held it until he felt capable of speech again.
Today, he had some optimism for yet another go at a new, considerably safer, version of Dreamless Sleep. The original potion had its place, but could only be used sparingly. As Muggles had discovered, people actually needed to dream. Without dreams, a person would quickly become quite mentally disturbed. They could even react by
Mostly ignoring Parkinson's still slightly puggish face as she ranted under her silencing charm, Harry drew all five fingertips around Parkinson's now thoroughly upright, crinkly nipple. It stood taller than his own, and was rosy where his own were brown. He drew his fingertips down Parkinson's side, from her breast, around to where her arms - pulled around her back with restraints, curved away. Then, watching her shiver with some sort of discomfort (ticklish?), he scratched down her soft skin, not stopping till he hit the loincloth, which was Gryffindor crimson with a bit of gold trim.
“You spoke for him at trial, Harry,” Andromeda said, finally looking uncertain. “And his mother. My sister. I thought that meant something.”
“Well,” Narcissa looked unsure. “I knew little about it. I never went through! But it was a literal doorway in Cellenina’s house. If she wanted to visit her grandparents, she could open the door at the end of the hallway where her bedroom was, walk through, and, apparently, she would be magically transported from that hallway, here in Wiltshire, to her grandparents' home, who lived somewhere in Wales.”
Slowly, Draco’s face flushed a dull red. “I’m terribly sorry,” he apologized. “That was rude of me.”
“No,” he said, and caressed Harry’s cheek. “You know what? No! I’m not. I love you, Harry Potter. You make me incredibly happy, and I love you.”

“Um,” Draco said, flushing brighter, “what d’you mean by sex? Are you a top? Do you need, uh, that? M’not... experienced.”
It seemed to take ages, but after all three Swiss bankers had carefully sifted through all Andromeda’s papers, they seemed satisfied.
love to get on our knees and service you, or better, on our backs--" She winked as she spoke and Harry's face started to melt from the heat of his blush.

Harry looked Draco up and down once again, nice and slow, and catalogued everything he saw. “You’re worried,” he said bluntly, “I only want your arse, want
Eventually Harry tore half his concentration away from the slick perfection of Draco’s body. Draco wasn’t checking those spells at all. He was pretending well, but it was an act.
“Much better,” Draco agreed, and he bent to accept the press of Potter’s erection in the crack of his arse. Potter pushed into Draco’s offering, curling his hands around to stroke Draco’s own cock through the tight, white trousers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Snape!" The Merchieftainess said, alarmed. "The foolish boy you spoke of was Severus Snape? He has died?"
Now Draco had left it too long, and hurriedly, he unspelled the enchantments that hide his lube and dildo. He opened his legs, slid a lubricated finger into his arse and sank back into his fantasy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“It’s the way I checked the house, looking for that microscopic perforation. I always check that way. I purify as I go. It slows me down, but it prepares the wards for updating. Then even if the customer hires someone else, their wards have been cleansed.”
Swaying, Harry sauntered into the tent, flirting deliberately to tease Draco. Once inside, he took a deep breath, worked to blank his mind. When that didn’t work, he regretfully spelled his cock flaccid.
"Not to mention my idiotic Slytherin protégé'! If anyone deserves to clean up my messes it's those two arseholes! Not that Potter has a chance in Hades. I'm sure Draco sees him for the complete deadweight he always is, and is cursing my name for having saddled him with such an incompetent and self-important whiner!"
"Headmistress," he began. He sounded tentative, but she put the sword down and nodded at him with encouragement. "Ideally, Harry's mother would accept this ring now. Correct?"
“Of course,” Potter says, and then magic pulls Draco upwards by the chains on his wrists, drags a table over to him, closer and closer until he is shoved up against it. Then two hands smooth over his back and the chains attach themselves to the table’s far corners. Magic shackles Draco down, his weight now resting on the table. The hands raise his shabby prison robes to expose his naked, virginal arse. Saved, apparently unintentionally, for Harry Potter’s victorious dick.
He finally said something after the waiter took their orders. Beef for Harry, chicken for Draco because it was rude to order the most expensive thing on the menu, even if Harry had.
When Draco started to fuck him, all Harry could do was gasp and beg for more. Thankfully, Draco no longer wanted Harry to keep quiet.

Malfoy gave a mild whimper. Harry thought it made him sound like he was too sated to properly express uncertainty or embarrassment. Harry burned with embarrassment enough for the both of them, though, so that was sorted.
Having grown up mostly in Guyana and Belarus, Michael knew nothing about Harry. When he found out, weeks after the
“And on Mum’s side, well, I guess it was just me and…” Draco paused, unsure how to refer to his dead cousin in front of her mother.

Panicking, Draco hardly noticed the silence between them. He had to say something. He had to figure out what Harry actually wanted, the real reason he had shown up at Draco’s door with tea and muffins.
"Hell yeah," Mouth said, and hurried into the position he'd requested. Then she looked at him over her shoulder, her braid gone loose enough that her hair half covered one eye. "Like this, Sir?"
“With the Aurors on the criminal case, Potter convinced me to accept Living Wards, and I’m quite pleased. Had you known our fencing was not perfectly square? And worse, was slightly damaged?”
Draco licked his hand, trying to coat it with saliva, but it dried not long after he’d pumped the King’s foreskin up and back a few times. Draco worried about having to pull his hand and mouth away over and over, but the King waved the wand he held in the hand not caressing Draco’s hair, and painted Draco’s hand with a pleasant smelling, viscous goo.
Lavender, however, sitting next to Hermione, summed up everyone’s feelings on the matter. Sitting up and looking Harry right in the eye, Lavender cleared her throat, waited for everyone’s attention, then spoke. “What. The. Fuck.”
The elder smiled indulgently, now that she saw Harry was interested in two of the gifts the Wizengamot had chosen to offer him. "Really Mr. Potter, you don't need to ask permission all the time."
“No, my Lord,” Longbottom says, and he bites his lip in distress. “I haven’t had an orgasm in thirty-three days.”
It was enough to make a man pull out a mangled, ancient, hand-me-down copy of the employee manual, and find the section where it unambiguously stated:

Feeling slightly wary, as it didn't look as though he'd be getting his way tonight, Harry stepped into their bedroom. Inside he found lit candles, unknown vials on the bedside table, and Draco, starkers and very hard.
"Don't be sad, Malfoy. You're so fucking pretty, I couldn't help myself. Please, take that off and lie down with me? After I've come once I can probably slow myself down a little, but shit… right now I'm so hot for you it's a wonder I haven't already shot my load!"
“I’ve thought about this a lot over the last couple of days,” Harry said, his scone crumbling as he picked out the raisins. “I don’t know who I might want to see, but I think I’d like to go out with a bloke.” He nudged Neville’s shoulder and smiled at the floor. “A tall one.”
Malfoy had an erection. It felt like a chunk of burning steel: huge, obvious, unavoidable. "Whoa," Harry said, thoroughly distracted. Harry found cocks pretty fascinating, but he had essentially no experience with any other than his own. He'd looked, of course. He knew all the Gryffindor boys had. But to touch, to feel…. Experimentally, he rubbed his own crotch into Malfoy's. He'd never imagined rubbing cocks with anyone before. Honestly, he'd never thought about sex much at all before. When he'd thought about girls, his imaginings had never gone beyond kissing them. He'd assumed other, sexier fantasy would come later, when he wasn't so busy.
Harry only fucked Draco three nights a week, which left lots of time. That Tuesday, he sat down alone in his room with a pot of tea and started to plan. Though he felt bad snooping, he nonetheless began by taking notes on Draco’s diary. After a few pages, he noticed a pattern.
"But what we just did? Fuck, that's the best bit! This whole adventure, really, it's been more good than bad. And the parts I couldn't handle? You were great. We made a good team."
“Wanting to conquer the world, I bet,” Grandfather rumbled. “Handsome, intelligent grandson of mine.”
“Yes, Minister,” Draco said, and he faked a tiny sigh. “This isn’t how I wanted our first date to go at all.”
Draco, deathly pale, nonetheless pulled himself up tall. “We’re through!” he declared, imperious. “I can’t believe you would treat me so badly.”
"Want to fuck you," he said helplessly. "Fuck your mouth," he lied, and sighed at that, because holy fuck, that sounded really fantastic too. He tried to go with it. "Want to fuck your pretty mouth, into your throat, so tight. Wet. Want to grab your head and fuck your mouth really hard."
“There is so much you just said, and I have so much I need to say in response. I’m probably going to fuck this up a little, so, er, please let me get it all out before you ask me anything?”
“It’s a lovely day, if nippy,” Aunt Andromeda agreed. “Button your coats, layer on a warming charm… you’ll be fine. Come back if you need anything.” She bent to pull Teddy from his chair. Then she straightened her spine and gave Draco a piercing look. “I am glad you had the courage to break the ice between us today,” she said. “Come for tea tomorrow?”
"I mean, I haven't done anything all that adventurous to them yet," Harry said, feeling slightly defensive. He was about to explain himself further, but Afelgate interrupted.
“First they wouldn’t let you back to Hogwarts, so you did correspondence courses. Then you couldn’t get a job, so you created a business out of thin air. Your father went to prison, so you helped your mother divorce him. Divorcing Lucius was supposed to strip Narcissa of her wealth and her place in this house, but you prevented that.

“Tuesday evening, after dinner, you were on the Floo to Blaise, I think. Narcissa told me she wants to head back to Johannesburg.”
Harry Potter insisted upon walking Draco back to the entrance to Slytherin after their second fuck. He insisted upon kissing Draco goodbye. He insisted upon doing so in a tender and affectionate manner.
to you, so I'm just going to stay hard as long as I can and tell you how hot you are, and how pretty your hair is, and how good your arse feels, and how fucking fantastic it feels to have you wrapping your arse around my cock, and please, Draco, please come. I want to watch you come?"
be a competition. I know you and Teddy are not close blood relatives, but I do not mean to imply you are not his family as much as I. My point is more that blood ties are important to some. My sister and her son are in that number, and that is why they have returned to my life. Narcissa and I….”
“No,” Draco said, confused. “If I didn’t follow watching you the first few times, I obviously need something else. Put your hand on mine?”
They were the last ones to leave the classroom, and Malfoy was blocking the door. “Excuse me,” Harry said, trying hard to be polite, despite everything. But Malfoy didn’t move.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and took a deep breath. “I’ve been drawn to you since we were boys,” he told Draco. “I talked about you all the time, back at school. I drove Hermione and Ron mad with it. Draco this, Draco that. Draco, Draco, Draco.”
“I would rather,” Harry hissed, “vomit up slugs.” Then Harry flourished his wand in Malfoy’s face. Malfoy flinched but Harry had only gathered his books, papers and quill. They followed obediently as Harry stalked away.
Mother merely nodded. Draco’s relief only surprised him slightly. He hated more explicit descriptions of the incident. Bad enough it had happened, even while neither of them were home.

“You are very attractive, so you have that in your favour, but to obtain and keep this position you will need to have a large repertoire of cocksucking techniques, you will need to be extremely orally talented, and you will need to be available to my cock twenty-four hours a day.”
Harry managed to generally explain Fusion Doorways to Draco and Narcissa, but not before dinner ended.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco said. He couldn’t help but laugh a little. “That was desire. I do that all the time with you!”
Traveling to Azkaban was a long, tiring process. First, they Apparated to the Muggle airport at Wick, in Orkney, of all places. The wizard who met them sneered, but steered them to a restricted Floo, which brought them, “one at a time only, sir,” to the ruined chapel on Eynhallow. Mother arrived right behind him.
“I want to feel you fuck me again in a moment,” he says into his Guard’s strong, muscular chest. “I’m really looking forward to having you come inside me.”
If he let himself, he would laugh and ruin the ritual, so he stayed all tendencies toward cynicism and irony, and reveled in feeling his own hand rubbing against his clothed erection, and – far better – feeling Harry’s strong body and hard cock, pressing in behind him.
Harry smiled at Dudders and waved him off before speaking to Afelgate. "Thank you, Dudders. It's fine," he said, and reassured, Dudders closed the door behind him, leaving Harry alone with a glowing, earnest, uncertain Healer.
Or what if, as Draco had worried on the walk home, Harry’s goal was simply a free fuck: a chance to get whatever he wanted without having to invest any real energy, any honest care?
“Did I not tell you?” Narcissa said calmly, but without quite meeting Draco’s eye. “I am finally returning to Johannesburg. I leave the day after tomorrow. Dizon kindly arranged for my transportation. It is an unpleasant trip by Floo or Portkey, much too far.”

“Let’s find out,” King Harry said, and Draco took the hint and wrapped one hand around the King’s shaft, wrapped the other around the King’s balls, and took the already exposed head of the King’s uncircumcised cock into his wet mouth. The taste was clean skin, a hint of sweat, a touch of bitterness in the precome already beading at the tip. He started with a firm suck, listening for the other man’s reaction, which was immediate and vocal, if not loud.

Completely taken aback, Harry knew his shock was written all over his face. He had no idea what to say. Luckily, Draco had some ideas.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
After a few days of friendly proximity, Harry had anticipated a spark. Perhaps even a zing up his spine, or a curl of pleasure in his belly. He’d not felt anything like that when he’d
"What can I do for you, Healer?" Harry asked. He'd been thinking seriously about fucking Mouth and then taking a nap. He'd discovered that sleeping from around 4 or 5am until 10 or so in the morning, and then napping every day after lunch, was a very pleasant way to live. Feeling sour, he did not offer the Healer a chair, and Afelgate did not try to sit in one.
“Halfway to Switzerland. I feel bad making him rush off, you know, but the truth is, I did need this errand done, and having Teddy about was honestly keeping me from it. So it’s a help to me, even if it wasn’t as urgent as I implied.”
. Nonetheless, at the same time, on those nights when his whole world was crumbling, Draco would have given nearly anything for a co-conspirator he could trust with his life.
"I need," Malfoy said, sounding helpless. "Er, you…. Get off?" Then he closed his eyes and made a pathetic whimpering sound of deep embarrassment. He sounded positively agonized, but all Harry could discern from own his state of alcohol-induced stupidity was that he didn't understand what was going on.
“You were utterly incensed at her not twenty minutes ago,” Harry said, confused. “I know she’s your mum, but is your fury usually that… transitory?”

“That was just what your Lord required of you,” Draco says, so sated he could barely speak. “You will warm my bed tonight, and tomorrow, you may collect your reward in the harem, as your comrades did tonight.” He smiles and strokes his Guard’s cheek.
“If you think about them in a practical sort of way, yes,” Draco said. He felt his cheeks warm. This was not a sexy way to talk right before sex.
Draco gentled back to consciousness. What marvelous sleep. He didn’t even want a stretch. But, needing his wand for

Feeling like a fool, Draco did, and he walked a few steps behind Harry all the way to a disused classroom on the next floor. He didn’t like following, but it was far easier than attempting to use words.
“I know all of that got in the way, and I know you couldn’t help any of that. But I am asking you, right now: are you going to let things you
She sighed. "The complication in this case, arises, obviously, as Lily Potter is no longer alive to formally accept the ring. In addition, we do not know its exact location, only that it almost certainly still remains within the Black Lake." The headmistress took a fortifying breath, and seemed about to continue, but now the Hat took back the floor.
"So, go back to your annoying little Gryffindor, with my blessing. Just don't expect me to admit that in front of him. He's still an obnoxious prat. A spoiled twerp like you is perfect for him."
Malfoy jerked his head up in shock. “Really?” he whispered, then seemed to think better of awaiting Harry’s answer. He yanked his robes off to reveal nothing but loose, silky pants that went from his waist to just above the knee. He sat on Harry’s bed, yanked off both shoes and then both socks, stuffing the second into the first. Then, blushing to his ears, he yanked off his pants and lay down.

“Nope,” Harry agreed. “I just meditated and exercised. But we don’t expect anything until tomorrow night at the earliest. We started early purely to be cautious.”
“Harry!” Draco stepped further into the space, wondering what to do, when an ancient house-elf appeared in the doorway and widened his eyes.
“Lavender and Seamus think that’s why you broke up with Ginny, too. I don’t, though, I want you to know that.”
“No, er, I mean… yeah…” Harry said and he looked shifty, but Draco allowed him to wipe a gentle finger across Draco’s lip.
Harry smiled solemnly at Draco, who allowed himself a moment of pride. It had taken him a few years to be able to say that word at all, and he knew it would take a few more to say it without a stutter.
Malfoy’s owl was handsome and large. A strong flyer, he hovered at Harry’s window for a long moment while Harry woke up, figured out what noise woke him so damn early (
Draco didn’t know why Harry would care, but — fresh from trying to be entertaining in his letter to Blaise — it was easy enough to tell a story or two about Millicent, about Queenie, even about Greg and Greg’s Mum.
This Dudders was able to accomplish with a finger snap, and Harry looked closely at his work. "I like it," he said authoritatively. "Now I want all the extra studs gone, just smooth leather left behind. Very plain."

“Of course,” Harry agreed. “You've waited this long, after all. But perhaps you’ve waited long enough?”
Worried — Harry rushed through the Floo. “Are you ill? How’s Teddy? What’s wrong?” he asked, panicked.
Harry’d assumed the 8th year common room was a neutral zone. So he was shocked when Draco yanked him up for a lengthy, heated, knee-weakening, public snog.
might do to ‘loosen a sleeper’s tongue,’ however honest the spell might force a sleeper to be; Harry had no choice but to believe that Draco’s actions spoke far, far louder than his words. Especially when those words were spoken only under a spell, while asleep.
He’d just had some of the best sex of his life, and the man who’d made that possible was still just resting there, smug and smiling and far too aware of Draco’s problems.
“So I wonder if this belief: women are weaker because they allow men inside their bodies, connects to the belief that a man who allows a man inside, is weak.
“Sure,” Harry said calmly. “Did you want to record us fucking? That’d be fun. We should make copies. We’ll each want one.”
What if Harry was seeking some sort of twisted revenge? Trick Draco into something that he thought was real, then pull the carpet out from under him? Laughing all the way?
“I know you two want a bit of a snog.” Andromeda winked. “But you’ll have privacy after dinner. After Teddy goes to bed. Set the table, please? I’ll meet the floo.”
It was true Harry could’ve left the room, but Draco wanted him to stay. It was true Draco could have masturbated nude, but he wanted to wait to show Harry his cock. He wanted to see Harry’s at the same time. He wanted to watch Harry’s face.
“Well,” Draco says, his voice iced over with disdain. “Clearly you need a better solution. I forbid you to orgasm this month, as well, but from here you need to head over to the Apothecary. Professor Snape may have something that will help you grow. Frankly, there are larger dicks in town, Longbottom, and if you wish to serve in my Elite Guard – let alone have the slightest chance at serving my cock – you are going to have to grow your dick a good bit larger.”

“I meant the way you swayed your arse back and forth against my cock,” Harry murmured. Draco’s swallow was visible from across the table.
McGonagall had tried to forbid eighth years from socializing in House common rooms. This, however, had proven impossible to enforce. If an eighth year “former” Hufflepuff was dating a seventh year current Hufflepuff, could staff really stop them cuddling on a Hufflepuff couch? Thus, eighth years had ignored this ruling from day one, and it was very easy for Harry and Draco to avoid one another.
Harry slid further into Malfoy, who grabbed him from underneath with everything he had. He felt Malfoy's arms around his back and shoulders, Malfoy's legs around his waist, Malfoy's muscles clenching around his cock. Harry moaned into Malfoy's ear and then, feeling inspired, licked it teasingly.
“Have I something on my face?” he blundered out, and blushed hot enough that he felt it down to his nipples.
His own eyes closed, Harry tried to enjoy Malfoy’s awkward kisses. He reached for Malfoy’s cock and Malfoy responded. Kisses changed: hesitant to eager. Harry rubbed Malfoy’s cock with his own, and as their foreskins caught at one another and Malfoy rolled on top of him, kisses went from eager to deep.

But Harry smiled, lowered his shoulders a bit, breathed out slow. Draco found himself doing the same.
“Vissy,” Draco mumbled. His most responsible house-elf appeared at his elbow, and he tried to stay his blurring vision enough to look her in the eye. “Eastern fencing damaged,” he managed. “Fix it.”
Narcissa sighed. “I am sure you are right. I miss him so when he’s away, but he is quite the wrong age to be permanently under my roof. I know you will take good care of him. And this way he can develop a relationship with little Edward.”
Sliding his cock deep into Harry’s body, he reached for Harry’s cock and watched Harry’s eyes flutter shut.
“I’m too intimidated,” Draco murmured, staring at the array of food. “I always just volunteer to keep Teddy out of her way while she cooks.”
Harry straightened his neck and angled around to make better eye contact. “It never occurred to me I was meant to relay that. She lives where you work! Eats lunch with you! She could have told you any time Wednesday, Thursday or today.”
"I think, my dear Harry, that a nap is in order. Then we should heat up all those noodles and eat them. But I know one thing for certain."
“Both houses have advantages,” Harry said, nodding. “A pro/con list might help us choose. One way or the other, though, let’s live together. We’ll figure out the best place.”
“Really?” Harry sounded sincere for a heartstopping second, then batted his eyes so hard Draco couldn’t help but giggle.

Occupied, but not deterred. Invasive thoughts kept seeping in. Harry had to force himself not to bother every customer about a potential passway between properties. He expected, if he could master the technique, it would be a huge seller. But as he didn’t have the slightest idea how one was accomplished, it was much too early.
With that, Severus had turned away from Draco. He returned to the window and seemed to look down on the street below. He silently waved his wand toward the front door and appeared to expect Draco to simply walk out without another word.
He was so adorable that Harry could only glance toward him, lest he do something embarrassing. He sent his guest a large, fragrant mug of coffee. Then, swallowing his discomfort, he sat to explain all that had happened to Malfoy Manor’s wards in the night while they’d safely slept.
Harry sat at Draco's table and pushed his soup bowl away. He took a breath and opened his mouth, but then he appeared to change his mind and gestured generously for Draco to continue.
Draco took another step into the room. Now he stood in front of Harry's desk, but his hands were at his sides. Harry stole a look at them and found himself surprised when Draco continued to speak.
They tripped up the stairs together, Harry pulling Draco by the hand. Harry’s bedroom was dark, but there were so many candles and Harry lit them with one wave of his wand, and it was fine that all Draco could really see was Harry. And then Harry’s large bed.
“That good?” Harry asked. He sounded more confident already and Draco almost chastised him for teasing. Then Harry slid his finger in another couple of inches and Draco lost his train of thought. He melted back into the mattress and bent his legs more tightly.
After a moment of staring, Harry grinned broadly at Draco. “Please excuse my tented robes,” he laughed. “Byproduct of some of these spells.”
“It may be news to you,” Harry said quietly, nuzzling Draco’s ear with his nose, “that I’ve had a more than a few chances to tell the world to take that very leap.”
"Don't let this happen to you, Draco. Love who you love, openly, happily. Don't let shame warp your heart and damage your soul. If it is Harry Potter you love, and he loves you in return, then who better to turn the world's opinion around? They won't deny him anything, not even you."
Harry returned his hand to Malfoy 's warm, firm buttock. He squeezed and felt the muscles tense. "Have you ever had a cock up your arse?"
Malfoy's eyes widened comically, and Harry giggled. Draco giggled back. "That sounded really off," Malfoy said, "but Merlin, yes. I want that. I want that a
McGonagall's surprise was overshadowed by Harry's enormous grin. "With pleasure, Draco!" he called out enthusiastically, and took the ring from Draco's outstretched hand as Draco moved to hand it over. Harry slipped the ring onto his own pinky as far down as it would go, which was right above the knuckle. It glowed intensely in the light from the window, filling Harry's eyes with it; and then a new voice joined them in their expectant waiting.
Draco felt even more defensive. He had to force himself not to release all his pent-up, jangled feelings at Harry. Still, his voice rose as he responded. “Why are you so angry at me? She is my aunt! She’s been really nice! She trusted me with the baby!
By the time they'd gone through the entire trunk, it was time for dinner, and Harry's cock and balls ached.
“What do you think you heard? Scratch my back while I’m still soapy. You know, when I was supposedly talking in my sleep.”

Dudders looked up at Harry, distressed. It was his responsibility to announce the guest, but Afelgate had beaten him to it.
Afelgate waved a wand and Mouth went completely limp, barely moving at all as Afelgate brought the rest of the stones from her body and vanished them.
“I’m too drunk to understand,” Harry frowned. They’d been doing marvelously just minutes ago. Loss suffused him. He thought he might cry.
Potter ran a hand through his hair (which didn’t seem to change it much) and smiled apologetically. “I understand,” he said, and Draco wondered if he even could. “It’s only, I still get all this obnoxious attention on Diagon and stuff. I don’t want to have to deal with other people while I’m trying to be on a date with you. Y’know?”
Horrified, Harry found himself standing in front of the Headmaster and his Pensieve. Dumbledore gave Harry a kindly look, but said nothing. Harry could think of nothing.
"It is extremely old," the Merchieftainess agreed. "I hope a copy will be adequate to get you where you need to go."
On Tuesday night a few hours after dinner, Potter found Draco leaving the library, pulled him behind a tapestry in a nearly deserted hallway, and snogged him. Draco put Potter’s hands on his arse and ran away after he came. Luckily for Potter, Draco orgasmed second.
Suddenly Draco couldn't find a way to raise his voice above a whisper. "How can you trust me like that?"
Then Harry stared as Draco grabbed the cheddar popcorn bag, poured little candied chocolates into his mouth, and captured three large chocolate biscuits into one hand. He devoured it all, seemingly too fast to taste. It was disturbing and fascinating, at the same time. Harry’d never expected to see Draco Malfoy indulge gluttonous appetites – frankly, to see him eat and drink like a pig.
“I’m not sure this is adequate,” Draco says, disapprovingly. He holds Longbottom’s ordinary sized erection in his hand. “I told you not to orgasm at all this month, to see if that could make it bigger. Did you disobey me?”
Harry rushed back to the library and began checking out books. This time, under a far narrower focus.
Harry inhaled, and Draco waited for him to argue with Draco’s assumption that Harry would miss him solely for sex. But Harry didn’t speak, so Draco stayed silent.
sex slaves. Who were obviously, objectively hot. Even to ugly little middle aged healers. And they were both Harry's to fuck as he wished. "Brilliant," he thought, and grinned.
“Besides,” Draco said, kissing Harry again, this time going for that sensitive spot under Harry’s ear, “you really do turn me on with that professional tone and speaking style.”
Draco nodded, distracted. He imagined delicately confronting Mother: holding Harry’s hand, perhaps kissing Harry’s cheek when Harry arrived….
And since then? In the time they had spent together, how had Malfoy behaved? He had shown Harry how to split the chocolate, Harry recalled, without a snide comment or a word about the Weasleys. Even though Harry had left himself wide open for snark when he'd mentioned he only knew how to divide the bar into a lot of pieces. He'd complimented Harry to the Merchieftainess. He'd given Harry the opportunity to shine there. He'd helped Harry hear Snape's venom and then -- frankly -- apologized for it. Even though he held no responsibility for it.
Harry looked at Malfoy with dismay. What was he supposed to do now? He didn’t want to fuck this sad clown. He sat on his desk, feet on his chair, and looked at this silent, humbled Malfoy.
Draco couldn’t see anything other than Mother, white walls, uncomfortable wooden chairs, and swirling pearlescent spells, hiding them from the rest of the room.
Malfoy grimaced, but nonetheless seemed to decide he should accept this as the compliment Harry intended, as he stepped out of his pyjama bottoms and stood nude and looking slightly unsure in front of Harry.
Draco was still so discombobulated by this whole… situation that although he knew he should finally, verbally, try to offer to bottom; he ended up mumbling a salad of useless words instead.
"I have spent most of this school year, or so it feels," Draco said, looking at his feet, "working myself to the bone to get excellent marks, and getting rejected over and over again for every position, internship, apprenticeship, training programme, job and post-Hogwarts course of study I could dredge up even the remotest information about or interest in. No one wants
“You and Harry seem very happy,” Mother offered. “I noticed on Monday, those flowers he brought you.”
No, Harry heard the elegant chimes of his laughter accompany Teddy’s adorable, high-pitched giggle. Then chairs were pulled and Andromeda called to him. “Harry, it’s fine if you want those crackers. Join us?”
thought that. "I've waited long enough; and I can't stop now, or I might lose momentum. I'm so hard for you Harry, I ache with desire. So I want to push myself. I want to try to get past this barrier. Tonight."
He read for a few minutes, until he was confident that no one was going to bother him. Then he took the Glamour off the parchment and checked his nearly completed essay, making small corrections here and there, and then quickly writing a final summarizing paragraph. He spelled the ink neat and dry and rolled the parchment back up, stowing it away safely it at the foot of his bed with his books. Then he lay down, got his head comfortable on the pillow, and reached into his pyjama bottoms to stroke his cock.

Harry threw open his pantry and gestured proudly. “What looks good, Draco? Be honest. I want to know what you like!”

There were people with musical instruments, just sitting on their blankets and making quiet music. The closest one was pretty good with a guitar, and her girlfriend had a nice singing voice.

"In order for that Hogwarts boy to move on to the next world, the ring he threw into your lake must be found and destroyed. We are hopeful that you can assist us in obtaining it, as what is left of him is wreaking terrible havoc on the school."
