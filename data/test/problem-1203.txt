"Never, ever insult or hurt a sub, ever. Or you'll have me to answer to. Got it?" The Gryffindor makes a choking sound, which Macmillan apparently takes as confirmation, because he drops him and scowls as he and his friends scurries off. The fire elf turns to me, eyes melting from anger into sympathy. He doesn't touch me, and I'm glad. I don't think I could handle a dom touching me right now; I'd probably end up falling at his feet. "Are you alright?" I nod, not looking up, in case he's my mate, but he doesn't like that. "Look at me, Draco." My head lifts up of its own accord, and I make eye contact with the Hufflepuff. I breathe a sigh of relief; he's not my mate. He searches my eyes, for what I don't know, but apparently whatever he finds is satisfactory, as he nods. "I have a right mind to rip their heads off. If you had been my mate... fuck, I don't know what I'd do. Is your mate in the castle?" I shake my head no, even though they probably are. "You want to head back to your common room?" I nod, hoping to Salazar that he'll take me. "Come on, then. I'm sure you don't want to be alone after that."
"Are you alright chick?" she asks gently, wiping away tears. You nod.
"Well, we're nearly here. You should get your robes on." Getting out of the train is hell. There are people everywhere, rushing to the carriages, trying to get one with their friends. I feel myself getting anxious again.
When I wake up, I do so with a manic grin on my face. I just had my first mate dream. Re and Siri told me about them, and I had been so excited for my first one. It was all I could have, well, dreamed. I can't wait for my next one. No, I can't wait to find my mate, for real. They must be nearby, if I'm having mate dreams. They're initially triggered by close proximity, so hopefully they'll be at Hogwarts. Even knowing nothing about them, I already feel stronger about them than I have ever felt about anyone or anything. I know that once we meet, they will be my world.
"Mate!" The word slips out of my mouth before I can stop it, something inside me needing to feel the shape of it on my lips.
"Sorry to wake you up, Dray, but we need to go to breakfast." I nod, too out of sorts to answer verbally, and begin to get up and ready. When we get to the hall, the professors are already starting to give out timetables. As with last night, I wait for Blaise's permission before sitting and eating. The unwelcome thought pops into my head that I can't wait to find my mate so they can do this for me, then I remember that they would probably reject me before they had the chance.
"Ah, yes. I encountered that problem. Well, at least you know. I was worried you both would deny it, and we would be in a right mess."
"You think they're on the train?" I shrug.
You're right, I realise, and immediately I struggle to tug off my cloak in the constrictions of his arms. He looks at me curiously as I do, but doesn't protest. Eventually I rid myself of it, and place it around his shoulders. It leaves me kind of bare, but you can't really see with him holding me like this, so I don't mind. He beams as the realisation of why I did that dawns on him, all teeth, all joy, all affection, and for the thousandth time today I feel my heart flutter.
"Yeah. Sounded like it came from the other end of the carriage. Think they're a threat?"
"Yeah. I mean, I am."
"Of course, mate mine. So good, so perfect, such a good sub for me. So beautiful, smell so good. Can I groom you, my love?" His head snaps up, eyes wide in disbelief, lips slightly parted, hope etched into every inch of his face.
I have to, Eli. Our mate might be there, remember?
"I'm so lucky," he whispers, and I feel a sudden rush of disbelief. I am mated to the most perfect person in the world, and he considers himself lucky to be with me. He doesn't even know what luck is. "You're so beautiful, my Draco." I have to close my eyes as happiness overwhelms me to stop myself from welling up. "Talk to me, my love. I want to hear your voice."
But I don't. I don't, because suddenly his arms are around me, and I'm grounded again. I didn't realise I had sunk to the floor, or that my knees were tucked under my chin, or that my cheeks were wet and throat was sore. I didn't realise my mate was talking to me. And suddenly the fear comes back, because my mate was speaking and I wasn't listening, but then I hear what he's saying and it goes away again.
"When you flew away, did you intend to stay out all day?"
As soon as they break for lunch, I turn to Blaise.
"Draco-" don't tell her! "-refuses to acknowledge that we're submissive." Stop talking! Mother pulls away, frowning.
"Begging already? Oh, Little Veela, we're not even-" But it's cut off by a growl, louder than any I've ever heard before, one that sends waves of shivers throughout my whole aching body. Neither the chimaera nor I have time to react before the chimaera is thrown off me, landing with a thump and a crack on the forest floor a few metres away. I quickly scramble to sit up and back so far against the tree in surprised it doesn't swallow me. My body burns where the chimaera scratched and bit me, and I can barely stop myself from screaming at every movement. I slap a hand over my mouth, trying to muffle my sobs. Forget me, please forget me. Sounds of growls and whimpers and hisses reach my ears, and, to my surprise, it sounds like the chimaera's losing. What could possibly be stronger than a chimaera? How will I deal with something that wants to hurt me that is stronger than a chimaera? Because of course it wants to hurt me, eat me, feed me to its young. Why else would it save me from the chimaera, if not to claim me for itself? With the hand not muffling my sobs, I try to wipe the blood from my eyes, and slowly blink them open. Fighting the chimaera, and without doubt winning, is the biggest wolf I have ever seen. And then, all of a sudden you come rushing back into my head, and it's like I can breathe again.
"Yes." I feel part of me die.
"Harry! Where have you been?"
"I've told you, I forgive you." Nothing. "Draco, look at me." Because if he looks at me, he'll understand. If he looks at me, he'll know he's my mate. And I'm his. "Look at me and tell me I'm lying. Draco, please, I'm asking you to look at me." And finally, finally, he does.
When I wake up, the first thing I notice is that my mate-pains are worse, and the second is that you are sad. Almost unbearably so. What's wrong, Alex? You don't say anything, just whimper, and I can tell I'm not going to get a response out of you. The third is that I feel... different. Even more submissive than normal. Like being around my mate, even in a dream, has enhanced my already timid and obedient nature.
"Draco?" I murmur, trying not to wake him if he isn't actually awake. But he is, and his eyes slowly blink open, examining his surroundings before finally landing on mine. I think I stop breathing for a second. His eyes are grey and blue and confused and glossy and breath-taking. I didn't quite realise how close I was to him when he was asleep, but now I do. I notice every fibre of my being that barely brushes up against him. I want to pull him against me, be even closer, make him okay. My mate. He breaks eye contact before I can get my breath back, and must realise how little I'm wearing because he immediately squeezes his eyes shut and blushes furiously and he looks so... innocent, adorable, that I might combust. A chuckle leaves my mouth because I can't believe I just called Draco Malfoy adorable. But he is, he so is. My submissive. His blush deepens, and immediately I want to touch it, to feel his smooth skin warm under mine, so I do, bringing a hand up to cup his cheek as delicately as possible. As he did when he was asleep, he leans into me, and my incredulous laugh dies off because he's awake. He's awake and conscious and is trying to get near. My mate wants to be near me. It's so different from how he acted before, in the mate dreams and in his dorm, and I wonder what changed, before I realise of course he's changed, he almost died, and he needs comfort whether he knows it or not. And then- my mate almost died. My mate almost died, and I only just got here in time, he was hurt because he was running away from me, and what kind of dominant am I if I let my mate get hurt that badly?
Um, no, no, it's okay. I shake my head, to try and clear it, but it simply makes it ache more.
I know! That's my-
"Oh, Draco. I would never. Never. We are meant to be together. I was made for you, to be yours. I'm yours, Draco." No, that's not right. I'm his.
I've barely left the dorm in two weeks, only for about four hours a day for classes, and even then I kept my head down and didn't speak. The couple of times that I found myself alone in the corridors, some idiot seventh years always found me. The first time they broke my arm, the second I'm pretty sure I fractured a rib, but I've become good at the episkey charm since the dark lord lived in my house, and managed fixed it before Blaise found out. Merlin knows what he would do. And you're constantly... sad, I don't know.
"It's fine, I understand. If you don't mind me asking, why do you two live together now?" Sirius blushed. I never thought I'd see him do that.
"What's wrong?" That's when you force your way to the front, pushing me back. You pull away from the kind elf, and press the heels of your hands against your eyes.
I can't breathe. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I can't do this, I can't be here. Everything is spinning, I feel like I'm about to pass out. Alex, can you take over? I can't, I can't do this, please...
"Hey, hey, look at me, I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. You're not getting rid of me anytime soon, Draco. Look at me, beautiful." I start breathing again, focusing just on that word. Beautiful, my mate thinks I'm beautiful. "There you go, so good for me. Fuck, you scared me then."
"Please, don't look at it, I forgot, I'm sorry, I'll make it better, I just need time-" For a moment I'm confused, then I realise he's referring to the nest. It must be like... I don't know. I guess I'll never know. Because a nest is who a submissive is, it shows who they are, what they like, who they love. A nest reveals more about a sub than almost anything, and having someone as important as a mate see one that is unfinished must be mortifying.
"Don't patronise me."
"No, I'm not fucking with you! Just... who are you, and what the fuck is going on?"
Creature seminar from Harry's POV... in which he may or may not realise what Draco is.
I'm aware of that, but I didn't know at the time. If I had, I would never have done it, you know that. But there's nothing I can do to change the past.
He takes another step towards me, and I flinch reflexively again, so much I almost fall over. All I want is to scramble behind my bed and hide, but I can't, I can't.
"I hope you find your mate soon." So do I.
Okay. Okay. That's true. Okay. I can do this. Can you, uh, tell them though? I don't think I can.
I shouldn't have said that. Merlin knows if I inflate your ego any more your head will explode.
Okay, so what exactly is a mate? I feel your emotions change, and it's a weird experience. I can tell they're yours, but in response, mine try to change too. And I feel happier than I've felt in a long time.
"The least I could do. I'll see you soon, Draco." He leaves, and I scurry back into my dorm. I curl up in my make-shift nest, trying to imagine it's adequate. Trying to picture my mate curled up with me, his arms around me and my head on his chest.
"Um, we were just... just wondering... why do you have wings?" Blaise chuckles.
I feel you getting sad, more than sad, at the thought of being rejected.
"Okay, I can do that." I grin.
"Promise?"
"Unless he's a sub."
You're walking away. Why are you walking away? Our mate is behind you, Harry, you're walking the wrong-
"Everything alright?"
What does he look like? You're silent for a while, trying to remember. I realise that whilst the dreams restrict me from finding out too much about my mate, they simply make you forget. And you feel upset about that.
"Never ever. I can't stand the thought of you suffering, 'Lexie, net alone because of me-" I pause here because a growl rumbles it's way up my throat.
"Eager, much?" I growl at him, half playfully, half not.
Bull. I don't need to talk to this supposed Uncle who I've never met. Father already trained me, and it's not going to prove I'm a sub because I'm not-
What?
Quickly, so he doesn't focus on it too much, I take off his trousers, then shed his cloak from around my shoulders. I step into the now almost-full bath, reaching out a hand to him, we he takes blushing, and steps after me. I sit down, pulling him into my lap. He presses his face into my chest, and I can feel the heat of his blush. I start cleaning him, wiping away the dirt and blood clinging to his skin. I do so as slowly as possible, savouring the feeling of my mate in my lap and his skin under mine. I wash his hair and wings too, threading my fingers through soft tufts and feathers, massaging soap suds into his scalp and wing bones and savouring the quiet whines and - Merlin help me - moans he makes as I do. I regretfully finish eventually, spinning him around on my lap so he's facing me. I stroke his cheek gently where the scar is. I hope it won't remain, but know it likely will. He doesn't know that though, and leans into the touch, closing his eyes. I take the opportunity to let my eyes wonder his body. And fuck, if I thought he was beautiful before, it was nothing compared to how he looks dripping wet and almost naked above me, skin and hair so clean they're practically sparkling, face nuzzling into my palm. It takes a few seconds for Draco to realise I've finished, and when he does he blinks his eyes open, smiling shyly at me. I feel the affection like a physical ache in my chest.
"Don't be."
Back to Hogwarts, but properly this time.
You don't need to tell me twice. I'm off, even faster than before, so fast my muscles are aching and my lungs are quivering. I push the pain aside, focusing on nothing but mate, mate, my mate screamed, my mate is in pain, I need to find my mate. I pick up his scent, coming to a halt. I look around, searching the trees for a glimpse of his sunlight hair or slate grey wings. Instead, I'm left with an empty clearing and a few shed feathers. I rush over to them, and notice with a sudden jolt to my stomach that they're matted with blood. No. No. And then another scream echoes through the trees and I'm running towards it before I can feel the strange mix of relief and dread - because my mate is alive, but alive and in pain.
Part way through the meal, I overhear a conversation amongst a few firsties further down the table.
"But- but... you hated me." A slight pause. Long enough that the tendrils I'd dread begin to wind their way back around my heart, but are banished as soon as he speaks.
"I'm scared," you say, voice small, ducking your head.
"Didn't you see them in the entrance hall? They were so big!"
"I thought it was a soulmate situation? Besides, I was talking about Malfoy."
No, no, not rejected. Never. Eli loves me.
"Sh, calm down, it's okay, I've got you. I'm guessing that the dream won't let you say." I shake my head, glad he understands. "That's fine, I'm not mad at you. You're so good, I'm so proud of you for trying." His words make me feel boneless, and I sag against him. Praise coming out of his mouth sounds like a siren's song. I want to hear it forever. "Whatever you were going to say, just know I could never hate you."
"Th-thank you."
"Eli, Eli, Eli, Eli, Eli-"
"My wolf? What do you mean in my head?"
"Malfoy's acting weird," Ron mutters. "Don't you think?"
"Then what do I do?"
Trained?
"I'm glad," I murmur into his ear. 'Lexie whines. I don't stop. I comb through feathers with my fingers, untangling and smoothing when they're messy, removing the dead ones, massaging the muscles underneath them. It takes a while, although dreams contort the time, but it never gets boring or monotonous. The whole time I'm marvelling at how lucky I am that I am able to do this with someone I love so much. And someone who, I think, I hope, loves me too.
Eventually we reach the school. Blaise and I land in front of the grand wooden door to the entrance hall, and we walk in, making our way passed the first years heading to the small chamber McGonagall gave us our speech as firsties, where Flitwick now would, having taken McGonagall's place as deputy head when she became Headmistress. They gape at us, and I'm confused to why, before I remember our wings are still on display. I look to Blaise for guidance subconsciously, but he just winks at them, and continues walking into the Great Hall. When the doors swing open, eyes lock on us, and I keep my head ducked down. Blaise takes my arm, which is a good thing; I would probably collapse due to my quivering legs; and leads me to the Slytherin table where our friends sit.
"Okay," I say, cutting off his probably chaotic inner monologue. "That's more than okay, my love. Whatever you need." But he's still tense, and then I realise- "You have my permission to speak throughout this whole conversation, is that okay?" At that, he finally relaxes, nodding, and breathes out deeply. "Good boy, you're so good for me." He chirps, the sound filling me with inexplicable joy, and nuzzles against my hand cupping his cheek. A rush of your emotion suddenly reaches me, so strong that combined with mine it nearly overwhelms me, and I have to talk to distract myself before... I don't know. Before something. "Now, what was your question?"
"No!" No, no, no, no. I can't see Potter. I can't, I can't do it. I won't. "Please, no."
"Why did you?" I almost don't want to know. But I have to.
You're too busy mauling the rabbit to death to notice where we are, but once you've finished eating, your thoughts turn to shit shit shit...
"Of course, Pup. We were happy to."
"My name's Alex, I'm Draco's Veela. It's nice to meet you." You sound shy.
"There are dryads in the forest?"
I heard.
"You're not looking?"
It's probably nothing. I doubt two whole years could be being punished before classes even start. Once the rest of the school has left the hall, McGonagall stands up.
"Perfect. He's caring, and protective - in the best way - and his arms wrapped around me perfectly, and he called me beautiful, and when he wanted me to look at him he kissed my eyes so I would open them, and he's warm, and he called me 'Lexie, and I love him, I really really love him."
"Are you going down to the forest?" a voice asks, and I turn to see Romilda Vane. "Mind if I join you?" Of course, she's a dryad. She get's energy from the forest too, and I doubt any of her friends would want to go with her. Neville looks to me, and I nod.
No, of course I don't, but-
"Y-yeah, it's just... all the people..."
As we enter the common room, Blaise and Neville jump up, and my friends' heads snap round to look at us.
"It's no problem." Soon afterwards, you let me take control back.
"Ah, boys, take a seat," McGonagall says when we enter. Turns out we're the last ones there, bar Zabini.
I'm ignoring you. I shift my stance so it's predatory and attempt a growl. It's slightly feeble.
"I- I need to ask. Please."
"You're welcome. Bastards deserved it, and more. Hurting a sub like that..." his eyes grow angry again, a fire beginning to burn in them.
You sniff the air, and pretty immediately catch the scent of rabbit, bolting in the direction of it. I relax, letting you do your thing and simply watching as trees fly past and birds caw overhead. As you hunt, I let my thoughts stray to my mate. My mate, my sub, my whole heart. I didn't know it was possible to miss someone you've never met, but I do, dear Merlin I do. I miss him more than I need to breathe. And it's because of how much I miss him I don't realise how far in we are until it's too late.
I can send a letter with Bernie, my owl. After... after Hedwig, Ron and Hermione got me a new one. They made it clear they knew he could never replace Hedwig, but they thought I should have one, in case I needed to contact someone.
"Yeah. They're mostly hamadryades, though, so I can't see myself being best friends with them."
I'll meet my Veela half, my brother, my best friend, for the first time. I'll have the body I was born to have, with wings and talons and scent glands. I'll have power; as a dominant, I'll finally feel in control, strong. But, most of all, best of all, I'll find my mate.
It hurts you. Fuck, it hurts me, to know that my mate, my dominant, hates me. Everything in me wants me to turn around, make it right. But I can't be rejected, I can't. And the only way to avoid that is to fly away.
"I don't know. I couldn't talk in it, or see them properly." In fact, all I really learnt about my mate is how well I fit into their arms.
"Feel good?"
"Wasn't paying attention. What is he?"
I didn't realise how many times it was possible to fall in love with someone.
"So do I." It feels awkward, having to go up to people just to look them in the eyes and walk away, but the other wolves don't seem to feel it. Apparently, to them, it's obvious what I'm doing. So I spend almost two hours meeting the submissive, unmated males, trying to find mine. But the thing is, I know, somewhere, deep down, that I'm not going to find my mate here. Maybe its the scent, or lack of, I suppose; or maybe because I already feel disappointed. And I know that around my mate, I could never feel anything negative. So really, I know he's not here. But I still look. In fact, I draw it out as long as possible, because I don't want to face the knowledge that finding my mate, the one thing I want to do more than anything else, will take even longer, be even harder. But eventually, I do face this fact, thank the alpha and Luna and head back to the castle. Because really, it doesn't matter how long or hard it is. As long as I do find my mate, whatever hardships I go through to get there will all be worth it.
"Oh, um, why are you sorry?"
I thought I just told you to shut up.
"You too."
And then the pain comes.
Sorry, sorry, I just, please, please, I need him. I need my mate. Draco, please!
"That's so great, Alex! He sounds perfect for you." I blush. "I bet Draco's really happy too." That makes me frown. Because you're not. I realise I've been blocking you out, and when I stop your thoughts rush in like water through a hole in a dam.
If I don't, they'll reject me. The thought quietens you.
What?
"How dare you?" I echo, the words coming out growling, and I stand, too tense to remain seated. "Are you insinuating that I would abuse my power as a dominant? That I would take advantage of a submissive? How dare you! I would never do such a thing!" I can't even think of what to say to convey to him how insulting that was. Instead, I bare my teeth at him, and growl even louder than I did when he called me 'mate'. But Neville whimpers, and I stop myself, realising I probably just scared every sub on the train. "Sorry Nev. Whatever. I need a walk." I leave the compartment, but pace around just outside.
"Yeah, I get you, but... I'm not sure if that's a good idea. He's pretty scared of everyone at the moment, especially doms, and considering your history..."
"I..."
"We'll talk later?" she says.
"Yes." My voice is small.
Flew towards forest. Go there. You nod, resolute, and I'm glad you're finally listening to me. You run from the room, almost slamming headfirst into your elf friend and his Veela mate. You growl, reflexively, making the elf whimper. Don't scare sub.
you say.
"Not so tough now, are you, you Death Eater piece of shit!" I wince, and you practically whither.
"Oh, Draco. I would never. Never." I want so badly to get this through to him. "We are meant to be together. I was made for you, to be yours." He smiles, shyly and small, but I would do anything to see that smile forever. "I'm yours, Draco." But then he frowns.
"Y-yeah. I'm okay, I guess. I just... what's Father going to say?" At this, Mother wraps me in a hug.
"Mate." I spin, and finally, finally, lay eyes on my mate. He's tall - so tall - and strong and toned, so much that his body is almost scary, but his face is so happy; he's beaming, showing fangs that could rip me in half but all I can think of them doing is marking me all over, and his eyes - a thousand different greens - are wide and shine with pure joy. Because of me. My body feels like it's being pulled towards him, so I run to him and practically collapse at his feet, looking up at him through my eyelashes in the most submissive manner I can manage. I want so desperately for him to like me. "Look at you," he says, voice growling and deep and I want to wrap it around me like a blanket. He crouches down, and cups my cheek with his palm. I whine, leaning into his touch. His hand is rough and warm and I never want him to stop touching me. "My mate, my sub. What is your name, my love?"
"What about your family?"
"I need to give Draco the food I caught, it's why I was in the forest in the first place. I'll meet you up there." He gives Neville another forehead kiss. "Look after my mate, yeah Potter?"
"I can imagine. I miss my mate and I haven't even met him."
"Mhmm. So good."
- and tosses his head backwards, gesturing for you to get on. You scramble to your feet, and climb onto his back, wrapping your arms around his neck and breathing in his scent.
"Shut your mouth! You deserve to pay for what you and your family did!" I try to apologise, before realising he told me to be quiet. When he realises I'm not going to say anything, he punches me, and pain blossoms across my face. I rear back, trying to occupy as little space as possible, and involuntarily let out a loud whimper.
"You wanna wait it out? We can fly to the castle after all the carriages have gone. Give us a chance to stretch our wings, yeah?" That's actually a great idea. I nod.
"Thanks. Are you, um, heading back up to the castle?"
I trail my eyes to his chest - shut up, Eli -
I turn around to face my mother, who notices the smile on my face and seems to relax.
So what creature was he?
If I don't get good grades I won't get a job. How will I provide for our mate then? You groan, but agree, so I get changed and head down to the common room to get started on a transfiguration essay. After thirty minutes or so, Hermione comes down and after telling her about your mate dream, we start working on the essay together. I know I say it a lot, but thank Merlin for Hermione. Half my essay would be wrong if she hadn't helped. By the time lunch roles around, I'm starving and the mate pains have got worse even since this morning. It's still not sharp pains yet; some people go years without their mate and have to cope; but every breath I take makes my chest ache.
This feels, very literally, like I have burst into flames. As if my blood has turned to lava flowing through my veins, melting my skin like candle wax. Every breath I take feels as though I'm inhaling acid which is corroding my lungs until there is a gaping hole in the centre of my chest. This feels like a hundred scalding hot knives are being thoroughly acquainted with my back, slicing through the skin so much there won't be any left.
"You can't stop smiling. What else is there to be smiling about when you just wake up?"
"I thought we'd give you the rest of the day to get situated, and then begin tomorrow. But Harry, this is going to be hard work. We have to cram eighteen year's worth of learning into just over a month."
At that point, Ron walks in with Ginny.
Stop. It's not your fault, it's a side effect of the dreams. That's what's making you forget, not you.
Yes please, Alex. I feel you recede into the back of our mind, and I fall off Eli's back in a heap when I get control back, forgetting I would have to grip. Eli barks and I might be delusional, but it kind of sounds like my name. Then his front paws are either side of my shoulders and his back paws by my waist, and his massive form is on top of me, his muzzle rubbing against my cheek, neck, and shoulder. I hear a snap, then more, and realise that he's shifting. On top of me. And all of a sudden my mate, my naked mate, is pressing my form into the ground, face buried into my scent gland as he inhales deeply. Suddenly, my fear is nothing. Everything is nothing, except for him. He is my new everything.
"Which direction did he go?" The Veela asks.
"Sure, sorry." He seems to realise how on edge I am. In the back of my mind, I'm thankful. "We'll be here." In case the worse happens, are the silent words. In case you're rejected. I don't reply. I go in.
She sniffles. "I'd like that."
I physically feel you relax when Draco stops bleeding, and you practically melt into the back of our brain, letting me take control as your body shifts into mine, the smoothest shift we've ever gone through. I'm naked, with nothing to change into, but I genuinely couldn't care less. Now that my mate isn't in mortal peril, I can appreciate how truly beautiful he is. Everything about him is soft and delicate and pale. His skin is smooth like silk and pale like porcelain. His eyelids are long and blonde and fan out across his sharp cheekbones, one of which is red with blood and will probably be scared forever. I frown, if only because I can only imagine the upset it will cause him, before gently wiping the blood away. In his sleep, his face turns towards my palm, and I feel a rush of affection so strong it would probably take me off my feet if I wasn't already lying down. He murmurs something to quiet for me to catch, and his lips curve gently up into a smile. That's another thing about him- his smile. It's something I've rarely seen. I've seen him smirk, sure, plenty of times, but smiling is rare, and laughing even more so. But that means I get to be the only person to make him happy, to see his smile, hear his laugh. And that is the greatest privilege I could ever ask for. Aside from that, his smile is truly beautiful. His lips are thicker than they were before his inheritance (shut up, Eli, I did not spend my time staring at his mouth, thank you), and are light pink and smooth and I can't help but wonder if they feel as soft as they look.
"Hi, Romilda. How are you?"
"Obviously I don't know! Could you just explain to me who you are, what you mean by my wolf, and why you just told me you were in my head?"
"Teaching this piece of shit a lesson that he should've learnt a long time ago."
"Oh, chick." Mother hugs you again, even tighter than before.
"Don't patronise me." It's Potter's voice, but it's so not. This Potter's, werewolf Potter's, voice is deep and sultry. Rough and commanding, but also calming.
More importantly, I've had seven more mate dreams, during which my mate seemed equally as reluctant to interact with me as before. And every morning, I've woken up in more and more pain. However, this morning you appear to be deliriously happy.
I roll my eyes, but I know you're right. Fine, you can have control.
"Say it again."
Sleep, yes, that's good. Sleep brings mate dreams. Go to sleep, Draco.
"Sorry it's kind of heavy, and that you might have to go a long way." He chirps. "One is for Remus Lupin, and the other for Hermione Granger." He chirps again, and I open the window and watch him fly away. I've never understood how owls always seem to know where they're going, but I don't question it. If I questioned everything I didn't understand about the Wizarding world I would never escape Hermione's explanations. I lie down, seeing nothing better to do than sleep whilst I wait for their replies.
"Why?"
His hands are on my chest, then my shoulders.
Harry gets his inheritance!
"Well, like I said in my letter, I went to live with Re and Siri for the rest of the summer and they trained me. I'm pretty confident now, but I have a couple more things to learn. Maybe you could help me research in the library?" Hermione smiles wider than I've ever seen.
"Please."
A boy in our year. We've never got on, and like Ron said, he's kind of cocky.
"You never know who your mate is until you meet them, you know this. And besides, it's very unlikely for a male submissive to be mated with a female dominant." Submissive? Is she calling me a sub?
- shut up, Eli.
"I guess you could call it that." Ron sits next to Hermione, wrapping an arm around her. That will take some time to get used to. I notice them look at Neville strangely, as if trying to figure out what's different. He laughs.
"I d-deserved it." He growls, and I can't help but flinch.
"I don't want to talk about this anymore." Neville frowns, but says nothing.
"Harry!" I turn, to see Neville and... Zabini?
You nod towards the forest behind you, signalling your intentions, and take off. The six of us get back at around eleven, and I immediately go to bed. Not because I'm tired, but because I'm excited for my next mate dream.
He doesn't know we want to protect him. But we're dom, he's sub, of course we do. That's how it works. He doesn't know that. He's confused.
"Where did you guys go?"
We head up the stairs to the dorms, and almost immediately chatter begins in the room behind us. I want to turn back and hurt them all, but I keep going. Towards my mate, my Draco, who will not reject me. Whose scent is getting stronger, so strong it's becoming harder to restrain you from taking control and marking him here and now.
I jump.
"I don't hate you." I want to say it a million times. However many times it takes to sink in. Because I cannot have my mate thinking I hate him.
"No, no, not your fault, stop it." I feel a flood of warmth and affection for him, not just from me but from you as well, and my mouth stretches into a grin. And then I realise-
"Thank you, Mr Longbottom." I sit next to Morag MacDougal, a submissive Draconi from Ravenclaw that I don't think I've ever interacted with. She looks me in the eyes, and quickly looks away again when she realises I'm not her mate. Neville sits on the other side of me, saving the empty chair next to him for Blaise. He comes in shortly after, and I meet his eyes, silently asking if Draco's okay.
Harry helps me out of the bath, grabbing my towel from the rack without even looking. I don't stop to wonder how he knew which was mine. He wraps it around me, then reaches for a random one for himself.
"Look at me, my love." I withdraw from his chest, but can't bring myself to meet his eyes. It feels too much like disrespect. He places a hand under my chin, tilting my head up, but I shut my eyes. I can't be rude, especially not to him, my mate, my dominant. But then, to my shock, I feel the gentle graze of lips against my closed eyelids, making me gasp. "Open your eyes, darling. I want you to look at me." I do so, the command overriding any unspoken rule, and let my blue-grey eyes meet his sparkling green ones. "You are so beautiful, 'Lexie," he says, cupping my cheek again, making my whole body sway towards him. "Look at you, my beautiful mate, my sub."
"Thanks, Harry."
"You okay?"
Okay, okay, I understand. They're family, and that's important. I'm sorry. I realise the silence has grown thick. I wonder if my uncle is having the same conversation with his Veela. I try to work up the courage to break that silence. Somehow, when I do, the sound is more awkward than the quiet.
Exactly, and, like Zabini said, the best way to do that is to leave him alone. I would probably just scare him more. "Alright. You know him better than me, I guess. I respect that. But if anything happens, I'll be damned if you stop me again."
"You did, longer than submissives normally do, but not enough to..."
"I'm Michael. This is Emma, my mate." Family.
"Definitely. There are at least four others already on the train."
"He's your wolf side, right? I think you wrote about him in your first letter. Can we meet him?"
"I missed you, love."
I didn't realise you didn't know what grooming was when you did it in the woods. I forgot that sort of stuff doesn't come naturally to you like it does to me, and of course Re wouldn't have taught you about Veela customs. But I know that to groom one's submissive Veela is a big step. And this is different than before because he wasn't awake then, and it was just to clean him. But for a Veela, being groomed is practically a rite of passage. A ritual between mates. It shows the dominant cares enough for the submissive to take the lengthy time, great care, and patience it requires to groom properly. Some consider it almost akin to mating. In any case, I know how much it means to my 'Lexie, and even though it won't make any real difference to Draco's waking body, it will make 'Lexie happy. And that's all I ever want to do. I start running hands through his wings, and he immediately starts keening.
No, I think I get it... Keep talking. But I thought werewolves were like Lupin. He doesn't have someone living in his head, and he was bitten. I don't remember being bitten.
"What?" What could possibly hurt when I'm with him, when everything is light and wonderful? I feel his hand go back to my cheek, running a finger in three lines across it.
C/W: mild panic
Mother is silent for a moment, before saying, slightly quieter than before, "Well, come in, make yourselves at home. I'll get my... Draco." They enter the house, and soon enough I hear my mother's footsteps outside my door. "Draco, honey? Your uncle's here." I take a deep breath. Right. Okay. Let's go.
This is Harry's POV, so the italics is his werewolf, Eli, speaking, and the 'you' character is Eli. Also, even though this is set after the war, neither Sirius or Remus died. Fred isn't really present in this story, so we can assume he's alive too. Hope you enjoy!
I watch out of your unseeing eyes as Harry frowns softly, raising a hand to stroke your face gently, lovingly.
"Alex."
"I'm sorry nephew. Shouldn't have taken this long to find you." The door flies open, and Uncle Michael - no, his Veela - rushes in, wings spread. I will realise later it's because he sensed his mate's raging emotions through their bond. I see his eyes soften and body relax, wings lowering so I can see Mum standing behind him. Neither of them speak, just come and join us. I realise all of a sudden that I am a little bit more whole than I was this morning, and immediately after why; my family is a little bit more whole too. Aunt Emma said I would start lessons tomorrow, but she was wrong. The first of my lessons is this: to a Veela, family is first.
"Fine," he murmurs.
Makes sense. I look up at Remus' house and find it's astonishingly normal. A small cottage in a cul-de-sac, painted a light blue colour, with a small front garden. It's nice.
"No, I've already forgotten. I'll only look properly when you're finished, okay?" He breathes a sigh of relief. "There you go, you're so good for me, Draco." He keens, subconsciously rubbing his cheek across my scent gland. Pre-marking me. I practically melt. But then I remember- "This wasn't what was wrong in the common room. What happened then?" He stops abruptly, lifting his head so I can see his widened eyes as he remembers.
Sorry, sorry. It's my fault, I know it's my fault, I'm sorry, Draco, sorry, sorry. I try to be quiet, I try not to let you hear me, I don't like it when you're unhappy, especially because of me, but we have the same brain and I can't help that my thoughts are too loud because I need him!
"Blaise is just coming, Professor."
"We're Veela." One of them; the girl who knew who I was, who is probably a pureblood; gapes, whilst the others look confused.
First day of lessons, and a seminar about everything creature inheritance!
"Draco was... misguided. His father didn't allow consideration of this option, so Draco didn't believe it to be a possibility," you say, and the others glance at each other, confused.
They look like an angel's wings, but grey, each huge feather a different shade to make a collage of all the colours of grey, a monotone rainbow. They point downwards and are actually on the smaller side for Royal Veela, both typically submissive traits, but I assume this is for the same reason as my deceiving appearance. I run a hand through the feathers. They're silky smooth, almost as if I was running a hand through cream, but I know that at the slightest threat they'll turn knife sharp.
Before long, the train starts moving, and Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Crabbe and Goyle find their way to my compartment. You lock eyes with Blaise, and realise immediately that, fuck, fuck, fuck, he's a Veela too. I knew that, he had told me that. How could I have forgotten? He's not my mate, but dominant, and unmated. And he scents so much stronger than Uncle Michael because of it.
"Thank Merlin, I can't be without you, it was driving me crazy not knowing if you were okay, what you were doing. Eli was driving me insane, he would not stop yelling at me to turn around, I... Fuck, Draco, I..." He pauses, taking deep breaths, assumedly of my scent. I feel as he relaxes, arms loosening slightly around me, head falling against my shoulder, muscles relaxing against my body. As he holds me, I rest the side of my head against his chest, and slowly blink my eyes open - eyes I didn't even realise I had closed - and gape. Because every other dream we have had was simply focused on each other, standing in nothing but a white landscape. But now it's home. Not home at Malfoy Manor, not home in the Slytherin dorms, not any home I've ever known. In fact, I don't understand how I know this is home, but I do know that it is. We stand in a bedroom, or at least, a room with a bed in it. Or, rather, a nest. All the breath I have exits my lungs and I am left empty, because this is it. This nest is it. The perfect nest. I didn't have a vision in mind before now, I didn't know what I wanted my nest to be like, except for a vague impression of better, but now I know that this is it. This is a nest I would be proud to present to my mate, to nurse my chicks in. Harry must realise I'm distracted, or maybe he can tell the change in my mood from my scent, because he takes his head out of my shoulder with a confused look on his face, and follows my gaze to the nest.
Yeah?
"I thought... I smell my mate, he's in here, but... I don't know where." Zabini and Nev are grinning, and I growl at them, loudly. "This isn't funny! Where is my mate?"
You're mad, and not at me, even if you pretend to be. You're mad we have to leave Draco and my 'Lexie, like I am. You bring the collar of Draco's cloak up to your face and inhale his scent until you're calm enough to keep going. I revel in the scent of my mate, but still. It's not enough. You keep walking until you reach the common room. The portrait lady asks for the password, and you snap at her until she lets you in, grumbling about how rude you were. You don't care.
"Exactly. Would that be okay?"
"Oh, sorry. They're dryads that inhabit oak and poplar trees, and can only exist within the trees. They can't come out, like us."
"Potter!" I stop, turning around to find him behind me. I nod at him, a sign of respect, and he does the same. "If you're going to find Draco, don't."
"Draco?"
"Emphasis on the past tense. I only did because I was young and stupid and I didn't understand the pressure placed on you. But I understand now. I only wish I had then, and maybe I could have helped..."
"We assumed you had found him after we couldn't find either of you, but fuck guys, you could've put us out of our misery," Blaise continues for him. A rush of guilt floods through me. They were worried, and it was my fault. Misery, Blaise said, I hurt them and it was my fault. They'll hate me now, and I'll deserve it. Harry will hate me because I was careless and selfish and a bad, bad sub. Bad.
I can't help but gasp. He is... gorgeous doesn't even begin to describe my mate. I haven't seen him up close, not since... Merlin, not since before the battle, when we were imprisoned at the manor. I never realised how stunning he was. And maybe it's the inheritance or the mate attraction, but fucking hell, now he's even more so. He's the most beautiful creature I've ever seen. He sits in the perfect submissive position, kneeling, hands tucked over his lap, head bowed so layers of silky white-blonde hair fall over delicate, porcelain features. His wings are folded gently behind him, and I had seen them before, in the hall, but not up close. They're a pearly grey, each feather long and soft and practically begging my hands to run through them. My mate.
Tomorrow.
I expect my mother to agree with me - how could she not? - but she sighs, looking upset.
"Whoever you end up with is lucky too. You're really great, Gin. I'm sorry this couldn't work."
Oh. Of course, I'm such an idiot, Merlin, if that had been me I would have made that mistake, he would have hated me forever, what an idiot!
"It's completely unpredictable, especially for other people. Only you can know your true nature," Neville explains.
"Of course. You're my best friend, Draco. I care about you."
Ours. I like the sound of that. Will they be like us? Another werewolf?
"I guess? I can't give him control without shifting, so maybe the train isn't the best place to do that. I'll probably let him out to go for a run around the Forbidden Forest tonight, so maybe then?"
"What's going on?" It's Zabini.
I love my mate. I love him - because he is a him, that much is obvious from the mate dream - more than I thought was possible at all, let alone at this stage. I haven't even met him, I haven't marked him or seen his face or heard his voice. Merlin, I don't even know his name. But my sub is my whole world. He's just so good. When he thought he went wrong in the mate dream; told me to do something that I can't even remember now; he completely broke down. He wants to please me so much. He wants to be good for me, my good sub, my mate. I love him. I love him so much I could scream. I wish I could stay in the dream forever, stay with him forever, but we both have to wake up eventually.
"What do you mean? I am a dom, of course I am!"
"I love how you say my name, mate mine. When we meet in person, I'll make sure it's the only name on your tongue."
I head out of the cottage and towards the woods behind it, where I sit against a tree and try to calm my breathing. I've come out here frequently over the past month. Sometimes I just need to be by myself, surrounded only by trees and silence. Where there's nothing to remind me of just how many people died because I couldn't save them in time. I take a deep breath, allowing the cool, forest air to enter my lungs, and finally relax.
Why do you sound happy?
What... what is happening?
"Then that's the opposite of selfish, my love. You were doing what you thought I wanted, and you didn't mean to hurt anyone. That's selfless, Draco."
"Veela? What's that?"
"I went through my own inheritance. I'm a nature elf."
Eventually, after what seems like an eternity, my head clears up and the pain begins to ebb away until I'm left with a strange feeling. Almost like when you know you're not alone. Plus, the fact I feel like I've gone through some kind of exponential growth-spurt, and my body feels heavier...
I know it can't be, but it feels like he's there as soon as I close my eyes. The mate dream is different now that we've met, and don't have to hide anything. It's more real. It's Harry. I visibly see him breathe a sigh of relief when he sees me, and I find myself in his arms before I can even figure out which way's up and which is down.
"Haha, funny, Harry. Who is it actually?" Ron says sarcastically. I growl silently, and you echo the sound out loud. All sound leaves the room as people turn to stare. I don't care, and neither do you.
"Not if you feel like you can't. I can just tell you what she says, I'm sure she'll understand. Listen, Dray, I should get going, I've left Neville with Potter, but-"
"Sorry, but no, you don't. No one deserves to be bullied, especially subs." I nod, but I don't believe him. I don't want to object, though; what if bringing up my Death Eater status reminds him of how awful I was, and he gets angry and hurts me? There's very few people in the halls, and I'm glad. I couldn't deal with the stares right now. And I don't want what happened in the library to happen again, ever.
"Well, then. As creatures, the rules will be slightly different for you this year. Firstly, as I know some of you have already taken advantage of, the Forbidden Forest is no longer forbidden. I will, however, urge you to enter with caution. Don't go believing your inheritances make you invincible. They don't. There's plenty a danger in those trees.
"Harry! Tell me everything that happened!" Hermione exclaims. I laugh, rolling my eyes.
"Draco, guess what!" He's obviously over the moon, and I don't want to ruin that, so I don't tell him about my escapade to the library. I let him gush about his newly found mate - Neville Longbottom, of all people - and give me what he caught on his hunt, then go on to talk about how McGonagall wants to talk to all of us with creature inheritances.
I quickly strip off, not wanting to tear my clothes, and allow you to take control, feeling the shift begin. It doesn't hurt nearly as much as my inheritance, but the process of my bones breaking and refusing, my skin stretching and sprouting fur is still pretty painful. Being co-conscious is still strange, even though we've done it so many times since my inheritance. You plod up to my friends, who look terrified (I don't blame them, you're fucking huge, even Re's wolf submitted to you when you first met), before your tongue lolls out and run in circles around them. Hermione bursts out laughing, obviously not expecting you to be such a complete goofball.
"Sounds good. Thank you for helping."
"Thank you," I say quietly. He nods, running a hand through my hair. "What-what is your name?" He looks happy, and I realise it's because I noticed he wasn't Blaise.
"And I, yours, mate," my mate says, and whilst I can't hear their voice, I can hear their words, and they are everything. I am pulled into consciousness by Blaise, who I growl at for doing so. He chuckles at me.
You get more and more frantic the closer we get to the dungeons, and it's all I can do not to snap at Nev and Zabini to hurry the fuck up, for crying out loud! Finally, finally, we arrive at the entrance to the Slytherin dorm. And suddenly, all the scents around me seem to fade away until they're focused on one, specific scent. I know that scent, I know that I do, I would recognise it anywhere. It's sweet and warm and fresh and so, so submissive. My mate. Mate, mate, mate, mate, mate, mate!
"Um. Harry."
"It's great to see you, too. And you, Lupin."
"Why?" What have I done? What can I do to make it better?
Okay, okay, fair enough. Why do you sound... irritable? You feel kind of annoyed, too. What's going on? You sigh.
When they get closer, I can actually distinguish Potter's scent. I recognise it distinctly from somewhere, but I don't know where. It smells strong, powerful, a bit musky. There's something piney there, salty, ashy. He smells good. And a bit like wet dog, but what else can you expect from a werewolf? And then there's the scent of dominance, layered over everything like fog. It's stronger than I've smelt on anyone, and the closer it gets the more submissive I feel, until they're practically outside the door and I'm shaking, eyes squeezed shut, whimpering softly, but for some inexplicable reason I'm praying for him to just open the door and hold me and tell me how good I am.
You suddenly stand up straighter and your ears perk up. There's something here. You scan our surroundings, and I think we realise at the same time that we're surrounded. By wolves, all of them dominant, even though only a few even come close to your size. Most of them are like us, inherited wolves who have transformed into true wolves, but there are some who are in human form, who I assume to be bitten wolves, untransformed as it's not the full moon. You crouch into a respectful position, ducking your head and flattening your ears, letting out a whimper. The biggest wolf, who is almost as big as you, who you inform me is the alpha of the pack, steps forward, growling. The wolf gives control to the human, and it shocks me how huge he is. He must be over 6'7", and his whole body is covered in muscles, and scars.
"Do... do I have to come?" I really don't feel like leaving my 'nest' right now. I especially don't feel like leaving it to be in a room surrounded by dominants I don't know.
"Are you trying to tell me that Malfoy is secretly timid and pathetic?" I can't help but growl at that, and see Neville flinch beside me. I put a hand on his shoulder, which he leans into, and scowl at Ron as you rant angrily in my head. "I mean, not that subs are pathetic, just, well, look at him." He nods his head towards where Malfoy stands, practically cowering and hiding behind Zabini.
"It's okay, it's okay, Draco." I gently take his hands from his face and want to die at the fear I see there. "You're allowed to speak. You don't need to ask." But at that he somehow grows even more scared and starts shaking his head vigorously, eyes pleading with me. "Hey, hey, what's going on in there, darling? What are you thinking about so hard?"
"Nothing! Well, I mean, not nothing, but, just, uh, talking, getting to know each other, and, yeah. I'll be shutting up now."
I can move. It's like you've given me control, but you're not here. I realise I'm not in your body - because I'm shorter and more delicate and more Veela - I'm in my own. I'm in a mate dream. Immediately I look around for him, searching the empty space, until I hear a voice from behind me.
"I mean, I feel essentially like myself, like I know I haven't changed, but I feel bolder, more assertive. Like I've grown up really rapidly. And then there's Eli." You perk up at your name, alert.
"People in the castle. Don't want people, just you." He beams, and so do you, and so would I if I had control because I can't get over how gorgeous my mate is when he smiles. I want to keep him smiling forever. Our mate is happy. It is good.
My 'Lexie is already there by the time I fall into the dream. He's facing away from me, and I take the time to admire him. After the first mate dream I had, which was only a matter of days ago but feels like years, the dream made me forget what he looked like. But now, seeing him again, I can't imagine how anything could have rid him from my mind. He looks a lot like Draco - it's obvious they're the same person - but more delicate, more soft, more... Veela. He's beautiful, more so than anyone has the right to be, so much it quite literally takes my breath away and I have to remind myself to inhale.
"Who? I'll kill them, Draco, I'm serious, just tell me who and I'll find them and make sure they never make you-" he looks so angry. I don't want him angry, I want him happy. I press my forehead against his, effectively distracting him, without considering the consequences. My eyes are so close to his now. I can see every speckle of colour in them. They're green, sure, but a thousand different greens, darker on the outside, almost black, through every shade to the lightest green around the pupils, which have blown wide. His eyes sparkle with emotion, with strength. The way he looks at me makes me want to melt into this moment and become so intrinsically part of it that I stay here forever and time never passes. The hand on my cheek starts tracing my face, the shape of my cheeks and jaw and brow and lips. Without my consent, my tongue darts out to taste his skin. He groans lowly, and the sound makes me keen, going limp against him, my head falling against his shoulder. "Does it hurt?" I frown, then realise he can't see my face, so I speak instead.
"What?" Theo asks. Right, their hearing isn't as good.
"I'll talk to you soon, yeah? Maybe we can go down to the forest together."
"Cal!" A submissive female runs up to us and throws her arms around the alpha, who hugs her back tightly.
I hear you whimper in my head. I realised pretty quickly that you don't like being yelled at.
"Hi, Nev. Zabini. What are..." my question tapers off as they get closer. I realise how close they're standing, and that one of Zabini's wings is shielding Neville's back, feathers soft on the side facing him and sharp on the other. And their scents, although unchanged, are mingled together so much I can't distinguish them. Add to the fact that I've never seen Neville smile so widely and Zabini is scowling at me when he didn't this morning. They're mates. "Congratulations," I say, and Neville's smile impossibly widens, a blush blooming on his cheeks.
That is Harry Potter! We're enemies, he hates me!
"There's a chance he won't, but you have to tread lightly. You can't just go in there and expect everything to be perfect."
"No. Don't even say that." Just the thought of him... him leaving me switches every part of my body off, as if it's shutting down in protest. All my muscles relax at once and I melt against the nest and my mate, all thoughts leave my head, and my heart starts beating slower. I don't know which one he notices, but he does, and cups my face in his hands, and speaks with a tremor in his voice.
"Are you alright?"
The next day, I wake up bombarded with 'happy birthday's from Ron. I go on to explain my inheritance, at least what I know about it, and he's really supportive, unsurprisingly, which boosts my confidence a bit. We head downstairs and tell the rest of the family, minus Ginny, who's been doing work experience at the ministry all summer, so isn't here. The Weasleys are wonderful about my inheritance, hugging and congratulating me. It strikes me for the hundredth time in my life how glad I am to have found them.
"I thought you said you would definitely be a dom?" Goyle. He definitely sounds more judgemental, and Blaise growls.
"Bye, Neville. Thank you for being so nice to me. You didn't have to do that. I know I... didn't exactly make your life easy before... everything."
"Why?"
You nod rapidly, and Harry gently puts you down and shifts. It looks painful, but he - they? - doesn't even flinch, and all of a sudden my mate (my mate! I still can't believe it) is replaced with his wolf, even bigger now he's so close. Eli would be intimidating if it wasn't for the huge pink tongue flopping out of a wolfish grin. On your knees, you duck your head submissively, blinking up at him - up, at a wolf! - through your lashes, before he's practically barrelling into you, nuzzling his massive head into your neck. You wrap your arms around him, squeezing tightly, threading your fingers through his fur. He purrs, and you shiver at the sound. Eventually, he huffs, removing himself from your embrace -
"Just... don't rush in all excited like you want to. Careful, quiet, and calm, okay?"
"Wait, Harry, just... Be careful. You know how he is, he... he's terrified."
But I remember Blaise talking about him before. He said he wouldn't hurt us, he doesn't hate you.
"And when they are, it means... everything. It means devotion. Taking that much time and effort and... well you know. I never thought anyone would care about me enough to do that. It matters, Harry."
"Sorry. I... please, don't bring Potter. Or anyone. I can't stomach seeing a dom other than Blaise, in case he's not my mate. I was trained badly, so it's just a bit much..." The kind elf's gaze softens.
"We would love to have you, pup." The joy that fills me is one of the many ways I know that this, the three of us, are family. Are pack. "We were actually going to invite you anyway." I grin at them, pulling them into a three-way hug.
I hadn't noticed until you pointed it out, but I do. The more I focus on it, the more it starts to burn.
"Of course."
"Harry, look at me," the dryad says from behind you, her voice meek. You turn, and sooth your features so as to not scare her. She's not who you're mad at, and you don't want to upset a submissive. "You found your mate? That's great, congratulations."
"No way, they look so old! They're probably seventh years!" I giggle at that.
I follow my mother into my en-suite bathroom and gape at the full body mirror. At first, I'm thrilled. This is me; this feels like me, this feels right. But then... this can't be right. Father told me that dominants grow after their inheritance, get taller, more muscled. They become harder, stronger. Handsome. I'm not handsome. I'm... pretty. You seem giddy.
"Oh, Draco. It's going to be okay. I'll protect you, I won't let anyone hurt you or talk shit about you, and if they do I'll give them scars that'll never fade. And you are not pathetic. You're so good, such a good sub, look at you." I can't help but chirp happily at his words. "There you go, see? It's going to be okay." I don't quite believe him, but I nod, if only to make him happy. "Want to come down for lunch?" No, absolutely not, I think, shaking my head vigorously. Too many people, too many who know. "Okay, I'll grab something for you."
"Well that's kind of complicated. There are three kinds," Blaise starts.
"I love it. Can we go in?"
"I'm okay. Groggy, and I ache a bit. Did... did I pass out?"
Damn right I do. I didn't realise it would be so painful so quickly, though. The aching isn't much, that being said, it's more than bearable, it just surprised me.
Hurriedly, I untie the letter from Bernie's leg, my heart beating fast. I realise I'm actually nervous to know what Lupin wrote. What he thinks of me.
"It's okay, Draco." No, no, no. It's most certainly not okay. "I won't hurt you, I won't." The tone in his voice is forceful, the words almost a growl. He's angry, Merlin, I made him angry. "Are you okay?" I don't reply. "Talk to me, Draco."
"Shift," he says, his voice harsh and gruff. You give me control, but I remain in the position you were in. "Who are you?"
"You're grinning, Potter. Quite maniacally, I might add."
"I'm good, I'm good?" He says between chirps. I realise this is probably the first time he's gotten praise like this from anyone. From what I gather from Draco, their home life wasn't great and they were under a lot of pressure. They were also so convinced we wouldn't accept them, and I can't imagine the inner turmoil that must've brought. They had Zabini, sure, but I never noticed him praising them exactly. And even if he did, he would be praising Draco, not Alex. Alex had never had this from anyone, and even if he somehow had, it wouldn't have been from his mate. From me. And with 'Lexie and Draco being more submissive than most, they would crave praise more than anyone.
"You said we could meet Eli!" I roll my eyes. Right, I forgot about that.
"He doesn't want to, but I'm starting to think maybe he needs to. I don't know."
He holds a hand out to me, and I take it to clamber into the nest after him. He pulls me against him so my chest is pressed against his and our faces are so close our noses brush against each other and his breath ghosts my lips. He's right. The nest is perfect. It holds both of us perfectly and it smells like me and Harry and something that's a mix between us, as well as something else, something subtler, and I realise it's an echo of our friends' scents: Blaise and Neville and something that must be Weasley and Granger and Harry's other Gryffindors, and I don't even mind that there are scents I don't recognise because I know it is making my mate happy. Harry tugs on something behind him, and pulls the subsequently freed blanket over us, before wrapping his arm back around my waist, and bringing his other one up to cup my face, rubbing a thumb across my cheek.
I've been staying with the Weasley's since the Battle. I didn't want to impose, but they insisted. It's only for the summer, anyway, as I'm going back to Hogwarts to finish my NEWTs. Kingsley told me I didn't have to, that after the war I could become an Auror straight away. I obviously have the skill and character. But I don't want preferential treatment, I don't want to be a celebrity, I don't want to be praised for what I did. It's not something to celebrate. It's something to mourn.
"We barely did. It - it was hard. But you do what you have to." I nod, having found a newfound respect.
"No!"
The doorbell rings. It's my uncle. I hear my mother answer the door through my open window, and hear their conversation with my advanced Veela hearing.
"Talk to me, love, let me in. What's going on?"
I am not submissive! Your whimpering fills my head at my outburst, but I refuse to take it back. I have been training as a dominant Veela my entire life. Every male Malfoy has been dominant for as long as anyone can remember. Longer. If I was a submissive... I would be a disgrace. Your whimpering grows louder.
"This is why you seemed distant in the dreams; because you thought I would reject you?" He nods, slowly, blinking up at me through his thick lashes and he is the most beautiful and adorable thing in the world. "But you didn't know who I was," I continue. "How could you have known?"
I pick up the pace, howling again, but am cut off by a scream that makes my heart stop.
"You're adorable," Blaise says, pressing his lips to Neville's forehead.
"I'm going to go let Eli run around, he's getting antsy from sitting around all morning." Everyone nods, but I catch Neville's eye and it's obvious from the look he gives me that he knows what I'm doing. I ignore him, and set off. I'm only part way down the corridor when I hear Zabini call my name.
The first two weeks of school go by in a blur. Lessons have become almost ridiculously hard (transfiguration with the new teacher, Professor Byrd; herbology with Sprout; charms with Flitwick; potions with Slughorn; and defence with the new Professor Trengove). The new teachers are pretty good; although Byrd doesn't measure up to McGonagall and gives obscene amounts of work, Trengove is one of the best defence teachers we've had. Not as good as Re, obviously, but better than anyone else.
"Is it a big deal?" He doesn't know. Of course he doesn't, oh Merlin I must look like such a mess, he must think I'm absolutely insane-
"I know you wanted to be a dom, Draco, but really it's-"
"All's forgiven. And not just by me." And he's gone. I want to meet the boy he was talking about.
"Why?"
No, Eli. He's scared of us, not in general.
"Well, I had my first mate dream last night, but it didn't really reveal anything, but then I was in the forest, to re-energise and everything, and Blaise flew above me, he was hunting I think, but then he kind of stopped when he saw me, or scented me I guess, and he flew down and... and... I found my mate, Harry!"
"Do you think he's at Hogwarts?"
You think I hadn't noticed? Whatever, it's fine. I don't think we're anywhere near the acromantula lair, and there's nothing else in here that's much more dangerous than a werewolf. If we encounter centaurs, that might be a problem, but otherwise...
"Right, right." I catch Ginny's eye. Part of me feels guilty, having lead her on for the majority of the past couple of years, and now not being able to follow through. I open my mouth to apologise, but she shakes her head.
"Are you hungry? It's time for breakfast."
"Of course! When I got your letter, I... well, it's about time I got to meet my nephew and his mother." There's something deeper there, but I can't work out what.
"See you at Christmas. We'll miss you, pup," Re says.
"I missed you, too. You shouldn't hunt for so long." He gives a noncommittal chuckle and pulls away from her.
"It's okay, really. Seriously, I... you can call me that. I mean, if you wanted." His eyes light up.
Will you stop with this bull! There's nothing else I can be apart from a dom, I've told you this!
"Draco, stop. I know what you're doing, and you can do it in the morning. Well, you can do it after class. Nevertheless, you can do it tomorrow. Now, you can sleep." I whine. There's no time! I have a week to make a nest as perfect as my mate, a task that can't even be accomplished in a lifetime. Sleep is not a priority.
What about Re and Siri, and my father's old pack? Besides, I don't want to live in the Hogwarts grounds.
"I told you what to do."
"I'm good. Thanks, Romilda."
"Are you scared of me?"
Shut up! And inexplicably, you do. I know my mother doesn't believe me, but that's fine. She just doesn't understand. She will, eventually.
"Are you okay, Harry?" Hermione asks.
"Draco, it... it's perfect." He sounds so grateful, like I've already made it for him, and my heart fills. He smiles at me, and for the first time as he does my eyes are drawn to his own rather than his lips. Because his eyes are shining, practically luminous.
"Later, Zabini." Harry carries me up the stairs. Merlin, I must look so pathetic, but I can't help but melt into his embrace. He shuts the door behind us, and finally, blissfully, we are alone. I breathe.
Because of who I am. And I know that's not your fault, but it doesn't change anything. And I don't want to talk about this anymore. As much as it hurts you, it does me. I yearn for my mate, more and more each day. The thought of going without them forever hurts me more than words can say. But I just can't bare the possibility of being rejected. It's better this way.
I can't, Eli. It wouldn't help him. He's got Zabini, see? He won't be hurt here.
I took every single precaution I could to prepare for my inheritance, and it rather abruptly becomes apparent that there is no precaution I could have taken that would have prepared me for this.
And even though that's all you say, I know exactly what you mean. No, he can't have someone else's towel. No, because it will smell like someone else. No, because he will smell like someone else. I do the first thing I think of - fall against him before he has the chance to wrap the towel around himself, forcing him to drop it and catch me. His arms around me feel like home.
"Missed you. You left." I don't mean to, but I growl. 'Lexie whimpers and flinches, but his scent doesn't change; he's not scared. Good. I would die if he was scared of me.
"I missed you, mate mine," I murmur against the skin of his neck, where I will place my mark when we mate. I inhale the scent of him; of sugar and pine and citrus. "My mate, my 'Lexie."
"Draco won't be joining us. I will relay any important information to him later." McGonagall doesn't look happy, but wisely doesn't say anything.
At the thought of my mate, I start calming down. Maybe you're right. I'll get a mate who can protect me and look after me, like you say. Maybe that is what I want. The thought fills me with unexpected warmth. Maybe it will be okay.
Back to Hogwarts!
"Yeah. Just finished hunting. Met the wolf pack in the forest too. And I'm not even going to ask what you two were doing."
"What... what if he thinks he can get into a fight and gets hurt? What if he's mean to a sub who talks to him?" I feel you starting to cry, and so does Mother when she notices you shaking in her arms and your tears on her shoulder.
"Do you think she'll be at Hogwarts?" Even though I'm eighteen, and should be finishing up my last year now, McGonagall, who has taken over as headmistress, is allowing my year to re-do our seventh year, after it was... disrupted.
I shake my head to clear it again. If I dwell on it too much, I'm back there. I don't want to be dead again.
Almost immediately, I fall into a dreamless sleep, and the only thing I can sense is my own longing. Eventually, another figure appears, and I can tell instantly it's my mate. I still can't tell anything about them appearance wise, and my voice is muted when I try to speak to them, but I can scent them. And Merlin, I have never smelt anything better in my life. It's the perfect mixture of crispness and sweetness, like fresh air but also like home. It has a layer of the typically submissive scent layered over it; like milk chocolate and crackling fires. There's a number of scents I can't place, but they smell simply undeniably amazing. And, Merlin, I want to scent that forever. I hold my hand out to them, gesturing for them to join me. They seem hesitant; a stark contrast to the first dream. I take a step forward, and they take one back. I frown.
"Oh."
You exclaim, trapping the rabbit beneath your paws and looking up, becoming aware of our surroundings for the first time, and as you do, I do as well. It's dark, darker than it should be on the edge, the trees so close together that the leaves block out most of the sunlight. The sounds are different too; instead of birds chirping, an eerie silence hangs in the air, occasionally interrupted by a howl or the clacking of hooves. We're definitely not on the edge anymore. A jolt of fear burst through me as I remember what's in these woods and the damage they can do. Merlin, I almost got eaten by acromantulas in second year, and trampled to death by centaurs in fifth, and mauled by a werewolf in... I am a werewolf, for fuck's sake! I don't have to be scared of anything in these woods if I am the scariest thing in them! I need to pull myself together.
He probably will, Alex. I'm so sorry. But he'll hate me, and if he finds me he'll reject me. I feel your understanding, and the intense sorrow that comes with it. Now you're even worse than before, and I feel even worse for having upset you. But it's the truth, and it's time you accepted it. Eventually Macmillan and I reach the entrance to the common room.
Eventually, we keep moving towards the castle, still so close it's hard to tell where I stop and he begins.
"What about here?" he traces the wound on my chest, making me slightly breathless as I feel his hands brushing against my bare skin. I shake my head because any pain I might have felt is replaced with his skin, my mate's skin, on mine. "Or, here?" His hand goes to my shoulder, drawing patterns over the teeth marks. I mumble a no. "Or... here?" His hand runs from my shoulder through my feathers, and oh Merlin, that feels like all good things ever. A moan escapes my lips, and I feel his body go rigid against me. The hand still on my cheek moves to my chin, lifting my face to his. His eyes are filled with something I can't quite decipher. "Oh, mate mine. The things you do to me..." And then his mouth is on mine, and you are screaming in my head, and his lips are soft and slightly chapped and warm and his hand threaded in my feathers moves to grip my hips and everything, everything, is better than it's ever been, and if this moment ever ends I'll just die. Because my mate is kissing me. My mate loves me. And Merlin, I love him.
"N-no, I was going to come back."
"So you understand why I have to find him."
"Hey guys," I say. I remain standing, looking to Neville as a form of respect that I wouldn't normally offer, but I would like us to remain friends. If we do, I could end up becoming much closer to him. He nods, and I smile, sitting next to him.
"If you don't sleep, you'll have to face Harry looking like you haven't," Neville says, and it's obvious he's a sub too; he might as well have known the exact inner workings of my mind because that was probably the only thing he could have said to get me into that bed.
"In that case, I wish you luck. You are free to hunt with us at any time, if you wish. If you change your mind, let me know." I nod.
"No, don't apologise. It was my fault, I was careless. I'm sorry. Are you okay?"
I'm the only one who goes up when they ask for werewolves, and it puts me on edge. I don't like being paraded in front of everyone, and I especially don't like that they would do this to subs, who would probably be scared out of their minds. They point out my distinguishing features, although it's mostly in how I behave rather than my appearance. The woman then asks me in a hushed voice whether I trust my wolf enough to turn here.
"A nest?"
"Why?" Blaise asks.
"I know. I... Hermione told me about how you would have a mate now, who likely isn't me, and... well, yeah, I know."
"It's the best feeling in the world." I nod. Okay. It'll be okay.
His hands are on my chest.
"I'm an oreiade, like my mum. I have a pine tree."
"Sure, sorry. We'll be here." And the door opens. I hear Potter's intake of breath as he takes me in. I don't look up though, I can't look at him.
"I-I think so?" He starts caressing my hip with his thumb, and something inside me snaps. Or, rather, something inside you. Because all of a sudden I'm pushed straight to the back of our mind and watching as you fall into my skin. You're grinning, almost maniacally, before practically collapsing against him, my mate - our mate - right, our mate, burying your face into his strong chest, wrapping your legs around his waist and arms around his neck.
Yes, there is. I made a mistake the day I listened to you. I should never have allowed my submissiveness to grow. And now look at me. I'm pathetic.
Okay. After much longer than I expected, especially travelling at this speed, we reach the edge of the forest. I must have flown for longer than I expected.
"It's not about your family name, you know this, Draco. It's about which role your natural nature would complement-"
"He will say nothing. I love that man to bits, but what he expected of you wasn't right. He doesn't need to hear of this, and if he does, I will talk to him. I won't let him hurt you, my chick, my Draco."
Anyway, you and the pack hunters head out. The hunters are mostly inherited wolves, as we can transform at will and it's much easier to hunt in wolf form, but there are a few bitten wolves, which is kind of surprising. They must be pretty vicious to be accepted as a hunter in human form. But I guess there are people like Fenrir Greyback who are completely savage, wolf form or no. One of the betas seems to catch a scent, and takes of northwards, so the rest of the pack follow.
"Would you expect anything else from Hermione?" She huffs.
"I could never hate you, mate." His words are full of sorrow. "You are mine. I could never hate you, why... Tell me why you think that."
"Thank you, mate," I whisper, not wanting to make him mad by speaking out of turn, but also not wanting to seem ungrateful. The hand at my cheek moves to the nape of my neck, whilst the other wraps around my waist to pull me against him. He buries his face into the crook of my neck, where my scent glands are, and inhales deeply, taking in my scent. The way his nose brushes against such a sensitive spot almost makes me moan, and to stop myself I return the favour and push my face against his own scent gland. But it has the reverse affect as a moan falls out of my mouth at his scent. He smells like home. I can feel his breath on my neck and the warmth of his skin through my clothes. Without my consent, my body moves so I'm on his lap, curled into his chest which rumbles in content. He wraps his arms tight around me, rubbing his cheek over mine to get his scent on me and vice versa. Because even though it won't permeate through to the waking world, I will be his if only for a few moments. And he will be mine.
Our mate will hate us, Alex. Look at me! I can't even stand up to eleven-year-olds. And that is when I realise that I'm right. My mate will despise me; I'm pathetic. Who would want someone who can't even look at children without whimpering by their side? Not just someone; Draco fucking Malfoy. Everyone probably hates me anyway, and anyone who didn't out of some sort of respect for me will now that I'm a sub. As soon as my mate realises who I am, they will reject me. I don't want to be rejected, but I know that I will be, unless I never meet my mate. I swear to myself, even if you hate me for it, I will do everything I can to avoid finding them.
I know. I do know that. But... that doesn't stop me from feeling that way. I just wish I wasn't a sub. I wish I wasn't such a sub.
"Alright. Do you mind apparating? You can do so with me as you don't know where we're going," Remus says. I don't like apparating, but I suppose I have no choice.
"Really? You're not mad?"
"So am I." She seems to restrain herself, but eventually fails and hugs me, tight. I figure I owe it to her to hug her back, even though it goes against my instinct and makes you mad.
"So what's it like being a werewolf?" We continue our conversation until we reach the Gryffindor common room. It's not quite early enough to go to bed, so we collapse into chairs by the fireplace. "Have you met your mate yet?" she asks.
"Shit, sorry Nev. I'm just jumpy. You alright?"
"But-"
What can we do?
"I understand. Thank you for trusting me." He nods and heads into the den. I take that as a signal to follow.
- yeah, whatever. Anyway, he doesn't sound as enthusiastic as 'Mione. But still, I choose to ignore it.
"This is why you seemed distant in the dreams, because you thought I would reject you?" I nod, somewhat shyly. "But you didn't know who I was. How could you have known?"
"Everyone knows."
"I worried Blaise and the others, made them feel bad. It was stupid and selfish and I'm really really sorry." I frown. It wasn't selfish, it was fear and sadness. Those are different things.
"Ew, doesn't that mean you're, like, gay?" I hear the rumble of a growl start in Blaise's chest.
"You only have to do it every few months or so-"
"Draco?" Mate. I open my eyes, blinking at the light. It's bright at first, but I realise it's actually getting dark. It was just after breakfast when- when I fell asleep. We must have been out here all day. Because we are still out here - a quick look around shows we're still outside the chimaera's den. The chimaera who lies a few metres away, head a few inches away from its body. And Harry. Harry, not the scrawny teenage boy-who-lived, but Harry the werewolf, Harry the dominant, Harry my mate. He lies next to me, so close I can feel his body heat. So close that it's not until I lower my eyes to avoid his own staring into mine that I realise he is naked. I blush madly, squeezing my eyes shut again, but the shape of him is imprinted on the backs of my eyelids - his smooth tan skin and muscles and hips and legs and - no, stop it, Draco. He chuckles lightly, not meanly, and the sound is so sweet I want to hear it over and over and over until I die. He brings a hand to my cheek, rubbing a thumb across my blush, and I can't help but lean into it. He stops chuckling abruptly. "My mate, my Draco," he says solemnly. And I realise, even if you were somehow miraculously right, even if he doesn't hate me, I still ran from him. I still disrespected him, my dominant, my mate.
"And did you know it would worry them?"
"Begging already?" a voice says, and I emerge into a clearing to see a filthy chimaera pinning my mate to the floor, both of them covered in blood. A growl sounds, and I barely register that it came from me, before I'm pouncing on the chimaera, tearing it off my poor, gorgeous, wounded mate. And all I want to do is make it suffer. Make it know pain a thousand times worse than what it taught my mate. My claws and teeth are ripping through its skin, and every so often its own claws graze mine, but I barely notice the pain, instead focusing on making the scum beneath me pay for even thinking about what is mine. A deep scratch across its belly finally draws an agonised howl from the chimaera, and even though I could never make it suffer enough, I let myself kill it. I tear into it's neck, completely severing its lion head from its body, drenching myself and the ground in its blood. It smells like victory. Like justice. I finally stop to breathe, and realise you've been trying to get my attention.
"Draco?" I realise it's my mother's voice, and I'm drawn to it more than I usually am. It makes me feel warm and safe.
"Oh," he gasps. "That's it, huh?" It makes me inexplicably happy that he knows that this is our nest. And it makes him happy too, based on the grin that splits his face open as he looks back at me. "You're going to make that for me?" I nod, because I am, I really am, and I won't stop until I do. The look in his eyes, the sweet tint to his scent, says love love love. I can tell that even though I haven't made it yet, it's future existence means the world to him. He takes both of my hands in his, and walking backwards, leads me to the nest. "May I?" And of course he may, he can do whatever he wants, because the nest is for him, for us. But I can't say that. I don't think I can say anything right now. I nod.
"Well, if you don't fuck off, I'll shove that lesson so far up your arse you'll taste it."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Didn't want to. Wouldn't have. Harry made me." He whines again, nuzzling deeper into my neck. I refrain from purring. Wolves don't purr, thank you very much. "Hey, it's okay, it's alright, love. This means you get to make me a nest, right?" I physically feel his mood lift astronomically.
And I fall asleep. I realise almost immediately I'm in a mate dream, if only for the scent that ebbs through the air. I can't deny that my mate smells amazing. I can't place all of it, but there's cinnamon and broom polish, layered with the typically dominant earthy scent, stronger even than Blaise's. It's all I can do not to run to them, but I can't. I can't. My mate retains the same shadowy appearance they have in my previous dreams, but this time I can tell their build. And, as expected, he's a male. Of course he is, like my mother said, it's unlikely for a male submissive to be mated with a female dominant. And, to be honest, that's not what I wanted. But being gay will just be another thing to be ridiculed over. He takes a step towards me and I take one back, because if I go to him I will just fall further. And if I do that, it will hurt even more when he rejects me.
"Oh. I can't feel it." I'm glad. I never want him to feel pain.
"Really? How can you tell?"
"Hi, sweetheart. How are you feeling?" She leans forward to stroke my hair, and a contented twitter flies out of my mouth. It takes me a second to realise that I made the sound. I blush, and instead of leaning into her hand like I want to, I bat her away.
A howl sounds from somewhere far away, and I remember the kind of things in this forest, things I had forgotten in my misery. Werewolves, centaurs, and, apparently, chimaeras. The one in front of me must see the fear in my eyes, or maybe in how my body tenses and shakes, as it chuckles lowly again.
"Not in the slightest. Now, I think we need to clean up. Lead the way?" Draco nods, and I put him down, but keep my hand in his. I can't bare to stop touching him. Even the thought of it is agonising. He shows me to the dorm's en-suite, and I shut and lock the door behind us so there's no interruptions. The bathroom is much bigger than our one up in Gryffindor, but my eyes are instantly drawn to the bath, which looks like a slightly smaller version of the one in the prefects' bathroom. I silently lead my mate to the edge of the bath and turn the water on, then turn back to Draco. It hits me again just how stunning he is; platinum hair slightly messy from lying outside, porcelain skin dirty and flushed, head ducked and eyes fixed on the floor. His clothes - not that he's wearing much, only slacks - are especially worse for wear, ripped and stained with mud and blood. "You okay?" I murmur, not wanting to disrupt the comfortable quiet. He nods, eyes flicking up to meet mine. I slowly move my hands across pale, scarred skin, until they rest on his hips, keeping my eyes on his. He flushes red, not meeting my eyes, so I press my lips to the scar on his shoulder, inhaling his scent as I do. You whine in my head. "So pretty," I murmur against his skin. "Such a good boy for me." I feel him shiver against me as he falls into my embrace. I move my hands in between us to the buttons of his trousers. "Can I take these off?" He stiffens, only slightly, like he's trying not to, but enough that I notice. "There's a reason I ask, Draco. I care about what you want, so tell me. I won't if you don't want me to." He remains still and quiet, before I add, "Talk to me, mate mine."
"Stop, please, please!"
Being part of a pack, even for a few hours, is one of the best things ever. Especially for me, when my only family is the Dursleys. Needless to say, we didn't exactly have the close-knit pack dynamic. I did have Ron and Hermione, but it's not exactly the same. We were - are - as close as friends could be, but friends aren't pack-mates, and wolves are close in a way that humans with their societal rules and social roles can never be. I know you like being in a pack too, even more than me. I'm used to just acting like a human - I'm the human part of us after all - but you're designed to function best in a pack. It would go against your nature if we were alone. It's why Rogues have such a bad reputation; their wolves go crazy after too long without a pack. The Hogwarts pack is as welcoming as they could be. We could never be fully accepted; we don't have a status or a developed mind-link. I didn't even know what a mind-link was until I questioned how the pack could hunt so well together during the hunt without being able to communicate. Turns out they can communicate; the mind-link allows wolves in the same pack to convey basic ideas and emotions to each other. They can't properly talk, but it gets the point across. Of course, I'm still technically a Rogue, and can't have that.
Back to Hogwarts, Harry edition
"You weren't there, you were with Draco," I supply. "They told us after lunch, she wants to talk to us now."
"That's what my Veela keeps saying." She chuckles.
"You wanted to talk?" she says. Even though I know that this situation isn't my fault, I find myself feeling guilty.
"You okay?" Blaise asks.
I know, I just... didn't expect this from Blaise.
That's ridiculous... But then you start moving. Where are you going?
The man goes on to point out details, first in my appearance: I'm shorter, my facial features are more delicate, I have less muscle mass, etc: and then things like my stature and posture and how I'm ducking my head. He goes on to compare me to Blaise, who in comparison probably looks like the most dominant Veela ever. Eventually, after what seems like years, they allow us to sit back down. The seminar continues, but I don't listen, instead listening to the word 'sub' echo around in my head and desperately avoiding eye contact with everyone. Because now they know, and there is no going back.
"Zabini."
"Thank you so much for helping me," I say.
"Thank you, that means a lot." A growl echoes through the train, obviously infuriated, but probably on the other end of the train. You shiver, ducking your head and wrapping your arms around your stomach, whimpering loudly. Blaise growls lowly, letting it rumble in his chest, and his wings start visibly straining against his robes.
I haven't seen Potter since my trial, over four months ago now and before either of us got our inheritances. But I can tell, even before he enters the room, that he's different. He's dominant, I knew that; I could've guessed even if I didn't. But he's really dominant. He makes Blaise look like a kitten. I can tell just from their scents; Potter's overwhelms Blaise and Neville's almost entirely, and it's overpowering. As soon as I smell it I'm on my knees, head bowed, waiting, without a thought. A low whine echoes throughout the room and I realise I made it. You are a mess. You're squealing so loud it's giving me a headache, just at his faint scent. He's not even close enough to hear yet, probably not even in the common room, and you're quivering in the back of my mind, whimpering. What's wrong with you? You don't respond. Are you okay? The only recognition I get is your excited giggle. Okay...
Then why the fuck aren't you turning around?
"Good dream?" Yes, I think, it was a great dream, and then scorn myself for doing so. I had sworn last night that I would not allow myself to go to my mate, would not allow myself to get any closer to them. If I fell for them, it would only make avoiding them so much harder.
I need him, I need him, I need him. I need him so much it hurts. Draco, please, please, I can't do this, I need him.
As soon as I walk into the living room, I suddenly feel like I'm wading through mud; every one of my movements takes effort. My uncle sits on the sofa, his mate tucked into his side, and it astonishes me how much he resembles my father. His platinum blonde hair is cut short, likely the only difference, and his bone structure is refined and pointed. He is tall, even sitting, and muscled. But he does not seem sharp and cold like my father, instead, he has a warm, calm air about him. He smiles at me, and I feel myself smile back. There's something in me drawing me to him, and I realise it's you.
C/W: mild homophobia
Right. I gulp. Okay. Like that's not terrifying.
Calm down, Eli. He doesn't know. "Sorry. Just... don't call me that."
"Do you have any questions?"
"Let's go up to the castle. We don't have to see anyone if you don't want to. I just want to clean up and relax somewhere comfy, okay?" You nod, still in awe he called you treasure. "There you go, good boy." You immediately start chirping happily, nuzzling into him as he stands up with you in his arms. "You want to ride on Eli's back? It's a long walk."
"That I'm beautiful." He chuckles.
I wake up with the word 'mate' on my tongue and you practically bouncing around my mind, ecstatic. Did you see that too? I couldn't sense you.
Shut up, you tosser, don't go and get cocky.
"Will do. See you around." I let go of his hand, and head back to the hall for lunch. Zabini comes back about half an hour later, grabs some food and leaves again, probably so Draco doesn't have to come into the hall again. After lunch, the speakers say everyone with inheritances can leave, they don't need any examples for the next part of the talk and we know all the information, but tell us to go to McGonagall's office after dinner. I decide to go back to my dorm and take a nap. I'm pretty tired, and who knows, maybe I'll have another mate dream. Turns out, I was right.
"It's nice to meet you. I'm Draco."
"I'm so sorry, my darling." Sorry? I open my eyes again, keeping them on his face. He looks sincere, and, in fact, sorry. Sad. No, he can't be sad, mate can't be sad, make him happy again. I raise a hand to his face, smoothing out the crease between his brows and running a thumb over his lips to pull them into a smile. I immediately worry I've gone too far - I did it without thinking, I just wanted him to be happy again - but his face splits into a real smile, a smile that makes every single thing in the world okay. Because surely in a world with that smile no bad things can ever exist. "I'm so glad you're okay. I don't know what I would have done if..." and he gets sad again, and all the bad things come back. "I'm sorry."
"Catching up on work. Can't believe Byrd set us such a hard essay second week back, Merlin."
"Woah, congrats, man," says the ginger one I don't like -
I don't know, but please, don't. They already know I'm a sub, please. You sigh.
"It's nice to meet you too. I'm Michael, and this is my mate, Emma."
"No worries. I knew you wouldn't have wanted to hurt them, however dumb they were being."
I finish the letter, pleased with his response, both that it wasn't his fault that I didn't know and that he is willing to train me. However, I do wonder why my mother never told him about the bite. It is weird, as he said...
Inside is a lot bigger than the outside; must be a charm. We enter into a spacious living room, with stylish but comfortable-looking furniture.
"I am, yes," Blaise replies.
"What happened? Where's Draco?" the Veela says, and he sounds worried. Why is he concerned about my mate? My mate, not his, mine to worry about, mine to protect, mine, mine!
You grumble something about how you would if I would just shut up, but obediently tug your clothes off and shut your eyes.
But all that does is remind me I'm a submissive.
"Fine, fine. I can do this. He won't reject me, he won't." I don't know who I'm trying to convince.
"Nice of you to join us, Mr Zabini." He shoots a grin at her, unperturbed by her comment, and sits down next to his mate, scooting the chair closer to wrap an arm around his waist. "Do you happen to know where Mr Malfoy is?"
"What type are you?"
"What do you... Draco?" Oh, Merlin. I can't believe... Draco is my mate. Of course he is, how could I be so stupid, I feel so protective over him and you are obsessed with him, and he's just as submissive as my mate is, and... and no wonder he would act like that! Draco thinks everyone hates him, he's probably terrified I would reject him, whoever I was, net alone me, he probably thinks I hate him! But it's Draco. Not the Draco I knew, not the one who teased me and picked on my friends, but the Draco who saved my life at Malfoy Manor, who would give his life for his mother's, the Draco who went up scared and shy to stand as a submissive Veela in front of the school. Draco with his porcelain skin and sunshine hair. Draco who sat at my feet in my dreams, who collapsed into my arms, who smells like home. Draco my submissive. Draco my mate.
"Sure. The more the merrier." And so we all head off together. We won't all fit under my invisibility cloak, so I bring the Marauders' Map and we sneak through the school. Once we get there, Vane and Neville head off together into the centre of the forest. Ready to show them, Eli?
Eli, calm down. Look, Zabini will protect him, and no one's going to hurt him. If I go up now, it will just make everyone confused and he'll probably be made fun of for needing my help. There's nothing we can do, so just calm down, okay? You growl, but acknowledge I'm right, and begin to calm down.
"Eli," I murmur, letting my appreciation show through the name.
"My fault. I shouldn't have flown away."
You whimper.
"I don't want you to be alone." I don't like making him upset, and I want to obey him. But being here, surrounded by people staring at me and mumbling about me is stifling. I can't stand being here a moment longer.
Here's a truth; my mate's eyes are grey. I never knew how much could be encompassed in one tiny, insignificant word. Because grey is not just grey, it is a swirling, moving colour, like storm clouds shifting. It is swimming with confusion, with fear, with dread, but with the possibility of joy, of love. It is not even just grey, it is white and black and blue. Grey is the colour of my mate's eyes. Grey will never just be grey ever again. I thought I knew Draco was my mate. But now, at this moment, I have never been more certain of anything. It is that certainty that takes my breath away.
"Okay, fine. Let's go down to the forest. You guys coming?" I say to Ron, Neville and Ginny.
I didn't really feel the need to.
"Draco?"
"Let's go back to the common room." She nods, and we set off. Hermione grins excitedly when she sees me enter the room. I frown, confused.
"Sorry," you say.
"Alex?" I whip my head round, thoughts of rejection out of my mind. There is an dominant here, how could I forget? Immediately I scramble to his feet. He's not my mate, but respect is for all. "What's going on? Is Draco okay?" I nod, not wanting to speak without his permission. If I make him angry, he might tell my mate, my Eli, I'm bad. And then Blaise's mate, the nature elf, is kneeling beside me, and Blaise is gone, as well as the others in the dorm.
"I'll see you at Christmas, then."
"I know you might not want to hear this, but it was most likely Dumbledore. He spent a lot of time with them... near the end, and has a history of keeping things from certain people. I'm sure he meant well, but it was most likely him." I nod grimly. The more I learnt about Dumbledore after his death, the more I realised how manipulative he was in life, and how much he kept from me.
I can tell; you look like an idiot. You immediately pull away from her, huffing at me, and Hermione giggles.
Eventually I can't take it anymore and I need to get out. Not just of my 'nest', but of the dorm. It's suddenly become stifling in here. I find myself in the library. There are a couple of people clearing up, but it's mostly empty. I keep my head down, so focused on not drawing attention to myself that I don't even notice I have until shadows are cast over the table. I look up, careful not to make eye contact, and recognise three seventh year Gryffindors. I don't say anything, letting them speak first as a sign of respect they probably won't even recognise.
"Thank you." You hide a wince at how gravelly your voice is.
"Thank you, Alpha." He nods.
"They're not necessarily a she Dray." I frown. Of course, she'll be female.
And it does hurt. It's always there, at the back of my mind. A dull ache that has definitely got worse since my inheritance, but so slowly I hadn't noticed it until now. I do want my mate. I really, really do. But I can't have them, and it breaks my heart. You whine, but don't comment. I stumble up the stairs to the dormitories, and by the time I fall (rather ungracefully) into my bed, tears are falling down my cheeks and choked sobs are working their way out of my mouth. I clutch my pillow to my face, and I inexplicably wish it smelled like my mate. I try to breathe, but the air feels like it's cut off from my lungs, which are burning. I know I'm panicking, but I can't stop, because the word sub is echoing around my head again, and everyone knows. And based off the firsties' reactions, it won't be taken well. I'll be pushed around and called names, and everyone will hate me, including my mate. Fuck, when they find out who I am...
"Draco." It's his dominant voice. And I don't know what to do because I can't say no, I can't, he'll hate me. But I can't see Potter, because he'll hurt me and I can't be hurt anymore.
"What do you mean?" I probably sound more panicked than I should. I find I don't particularly care.
"Eli." His voice is practically a whine as he falls limping against me, practically melting into me until I don't know where I stop and my mate begins. He starts chirping as I start grooming my fingers through the feathers at the base of his wings and rubbing them down the space of back between them. He's mumbling something, over and over, and I realise it's my name.
"Do we know any other Potters?"
"So most Slytherins are probably going to have inheritances then."
After the hunt, we head back to the den, and I have to address the main reason for me coming down tonight- I want to ask about my mate. They could be in this pack, but I would never know if I only met the hunters, who are all dominant. You almost push me to the front, eager to see if our mate is here. Alpha Cal notices I've transformed and does the same.
When I do, it's to my whole body aching. I must have slept weirdly or something...
"Harry?" The voice and scent of your friend with the red hair. The rude, stupid one who called us mate on the train and said we would hurt a submissive - our mate, I realise now, and I hate him even more. Kill him, quickly, and we can go.
Being co-conscious is strange. I can see and feel and hear everything, but I can't control my body. You stretch out my- your? Our?
"Harry?" I turn to see Romilda Vane. I haven't paid that much attention to her if I'm being honest, but as another forest dweller, there's a possibility for us to be good friends. Besides, she's a sub, and doesn't have any dominant friends. She's probably looking for someone to look out for her. She really is pretty, especially after her inheritance. Her naturally clear skin is now a bright-forest green, bringing out her wide chocolate eyes. Her hair, which used to be curly and black, is now dark brown ringlets that fall down to her hips. Her ears, like Neville's, are delicately pointed, and her frame is delicate and curvy. She's certainly pretty, but not my type. Not my mate.
"Hey, sh, sh, you're alright, Draco. Hey, look at me." I take my head out of his shoulder and realise I'm crying - again, Merlin, I'm pathetic - and I can't make out his face through the tears. "Oh, love." He gently wipes away my tears from my cheeks, so softly it melt my heart. "Why are you crying, darling?" I can't speak in front of everyone, I can't, I've already been bad, what if I say something wrong, something that makes someone angry, or embarrass Harry; I'm already sobbing in front of everyone, and, and, Merlin, I can't- "Hey, stop." My thoughts grind to a haunt. "That's it, breathe. There you go, you're so good for me, thank you." But I'm not good, I'm not. "Let's go up to your dorm, yeah?" I nod.
"B-but I..." I stop myself, scared that if I remind him what I did he'll realise how bad it really was and be angry.
"There's nothing wrong with being a male submissive," he says, practically growling. The firsties look sceptical, but I can tell they're scared of Blaise.
"You're so good for me, 'Lexie, mate mine. So good, such a perfect sub, good boy." At the praise he quite literally collapses against me, half falling, half jumping into my arms. I almost fall over, and have to lower us to the ground.
"Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy."
"Ugh," Zabini groans, "don't remind me. Still haven't even started that."
"As you all know, this is a pivotal time in your lives. Not only are we all in recovery from the events of last year, but you will be taking your N.E.W.T.s, as well as turning eighteen. In fact some of you already have, hence this talk. As many of you know, with your birthdays, there is the possibility of receiving an inheritance. Normally, we teach seventh years about creature inheritances in a new class dedicated to teaching you both about what to expect should you receive one and how to act around your classmates who may if you don't. However, due to the addition of the eighth years this year, a change in this system is required.
Harry's first day back at the castle.
"I'm going to practice my stances," I say, beginning to leave the room. "I want to see how naturally it comes now that I've actually had my inheritance!"
"Wonderful," the man says. "What are your names?"
"Why did you?" He sounds sad, so sad, and I hate that I made him, my mate, my dominant, sound like that.
"I am, yes."
"I'll miss you too." I wave goodbye, heading to the train. I find a compartment where Hermione and Neville already sit. Apparently I'm not the only one who went through an inheritance; as soon as I get close to the compartment I can scent it. He's some kind of elf, I think, probably a nature one, knowing Neville. And submissive, interesting. He's guarded as I walk in, but relaxes when he sees it's me. Nature elves and werewolves who decide to live outside wizarding society tend to inhabit similar places, meaning although they can get along, there can be friction between the two species. Of course, the opposite can occur, and werewolves and nature elves can become close and work in harmony. It's similar with all forest dwellers. I make eye contact with him before anything else, just in case, but as expected, he's not my mate. I sigh, and you whine quietly in my head.
So what's this whole dominant and submissive thing?
Yes. I do know what that means. I'm just not trying hard enough.
Her name's Hermione. She's one of my best friends, and probably the smartest person you'll ever meet. She'll have already done her research about everything, you don't have to worry about her doing anything out of line.
