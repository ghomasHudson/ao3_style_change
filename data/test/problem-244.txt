I don’t see Hermione or Ron either, though even if I did I wouldn’t approach them. I’m friends with them, but I’m not close enough with them to embarrass myself in front of them like this.
“Um, because I wanted to?” He started pacing the floors and muttering under his breath.
“I’m trying out. I’ve always loved playing quidditch, and I’d like to be on the team. What about you?”
“Well,” Luna paused. “I wanted to ask you if you’d like to be my date to the Yule Ball.”
Draco worked on the potion himself, and when the professor asked where his partner had gone, he just said that, “Harry hadn’t been feeling too well and went to see Madame Pomphrey.”
Everyone followed him out of the tent and Ginny saw something in the sky that only made the terror she felt grow. A glowing green and white snake with a skull. The dark mark. The mark of death eaters, of you know who. They were here. She started running as fast as she could away from the murderous sign. She heard screams and saw fires start. She screamed when she saw one start only a couple feet away from her. She sprinted into the forest near the Quidditch site. She curled herself up into a ball under a tree and whimpered. Why do the bad things always happen when I’m happy? She waited for awhile before she heard leaves rustling. Ginny pulled out her wand and stood up. She didn’t know many offensive spells but there was always obscuro which would create a blindfold over her attackers eyes or expelliarmus which would cause the attackers wand to fly out of their hand. As soon as the stranger was in eyesight Ginny pulled out her wand.
Despite being heavily exhausting, Ginny had a hard time falling asleep. Maybe it was everything she had realized or maybe she was worried, but either way Ginny had a hard and restless night.
“I-I’m sorry, but- but, this is hilarious,” Ginny said as she laughed.
Seamus laughed loudly and the Gryffindors glared.
“You think she’s pretty?” Ginny asked bluntly. The thought made her feel oddly jealous.
Those few simple words are what brought me here. It’s loud and dark but also bright? Which is confusing but true. I’m a bit overwhelmed, since Harry decided it would be a good idea to bring me here and then leave me alone.
Ugh, did I really just say that? Way to be lame Ginny. Ginny was afraid that Luna would think she was lame or weird after saying that but fortunately Luna smiled, said,
On the second day, more students entered than before. First, was Dariah, a Gryffindor prefect. Most Gryffindor’s let out a cheer as she walked up to the goblet and put her name in. Expecting the fire, Dariah jumped back as soon as she dropped her parchment. Blue flames rose up, then back down, as she walked away confidently. The Great Hall cheered as Dariah smiled. One girl asked,
Just the sight of Luna made her head swim and her stomach flutter. What was it about this girl that makes me so nervous? Normally Ginny was headstrong and confident, she rarely backed down from a fight. Everyone knew that, but being around Luna made her trip over her words and butterflies fill her stomach. Nervous, but exited butterflies.
“Um…”
---------------
“But mum!”, she had cried. “It’s not fair! Ron gets to go- and so does Harry!”
Harry nodded.
Ginny wondered if Luna knew that the forbidden forest was, well, forbidden. Judging by the tone of voice she used when talking about it she either (a, didn’t care, or (b, didn’t know.
Ginny arrived in the library and found a table to sit at. She fiddled with her nails as she waited for Luna. When will she be here? Is she ditching me? Maybe standing me up? No, you can’t be stood up if you aren’t going on a date. Right?
“You just go up to him and say ‘Potter, I’m in love with,’ what is it? Oh yeah. ‘I’m in love with your ridiculously green eyes and your adorable face. So let’s date.’ Got it?”
Ginny left class. She wasn’t sure how she felt about Professor Moody- he had used illegal curses. She felt a little bad for the girl, too.
She went back to the bleachers and plopped down next to Luna.
Yes, I’m aware this was very stupid.
She groaned and clutched her head.
“We... can’t find them,” her mum admitted.
“So you aren’t pulling a joke on me?”
I’ll be updating every Monday from now on! Enjoy!
Today she had Herbology with Hufflepuff, then Charms with Ravenclaw, then she had lunch. After lunch was Care of Magical creatures with Slytherin, and her last class was History of Magic with... Ravenclaw again.
“I think it will make for a very interesting year,” replied Luna. “Do you want to visit the thestrals with me? The babies have just grown their wings.”
He looked so exited. Ginny smiled.
“Yeah?”
She sealed her letter to Mum and gave it to her family’s owl. She watched as it flew away.
Luna simply said, “that’s ok,” and pulled Ginny outside. She led her to the forbidden forest and through the trees. Once they were in a clearing, Luna stopped.
“No… I came to see if you wanted to play a practice round with me or something,” Ginny said. Harry looked at her confused, then annoyed.
What if I make a fool of myself? Ginny hoped all would be ok. She tried to think of calming thoughts. Luna seems understanding, I doubt she’ll be mad if I don’t make my way around so well. Plus we haven’t even turned in our permission slips yet. We probably won’t go to hogsmead for another two weeks anyways. It will be fine.
A “study” date with Luna.
Ginny jumped out of the portrait hole and snuck out to the astronomy tower. It had been 7:40 when she’d left the common room. She waited for a little bit while trying to stay quiet. She didn’t want any teachers to catch her sneaking out past curfew.
“I have flashbacks. Of being controlled by the diary. It happens when I come into close contact with another and sometimes gets triggered randomly. That’s what happened yesterday, that’s why I ran off. I’m really, really sorry,” Ginny lied.
The students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang had been standing in the middle of the Great Hall awkwardly for awhile now and Ginny was wondering where they would be staying. Dumbledore must have been thinking along those lines as well because he started talking.
“You can sit here, if you want.”
“Well hello Ginny. What year are you in? This is my fourth,” Luna asked.
“Not just any dragon, that’s a Hungarian Horntail. They’re supposed to be one of the most dangerous dragon species, if not the most dangerous. I hope Harry can manage it.”
“Yeah they are,” she said, after she saw Luna’s look of anticipation. She realized she had been silent for a while.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny watched a nervous looking Harry walk into the audience view. She heard a few cheers but mostly boos from the other houses. The minister flicked his wand and the large covering was taken away. Underneath was a dragon.
“Erm, hello,” before he went to hang out with Ron.
Why is this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this?
“This is the Goblet of Fire. Each student that is of age that wishes to participate will wright their name on a piece of paper. They will then drop their name into the fire. In exactly one week the goblet will spit out the contestant it deems worthy for the Tournament. Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be using the Goblet as well. And that brings me to my final announcement. Let us welcome Beauxbatons school of Magic!”
Luna grabbed her hand and placed it on something. It felt like skin. “Here. You can pet them, if you want. They might look dangerous, but they are really very sweet. There have been very few Thestral attacks, don’t worry.” Ginny moved her hand to pet the thestral’s head. It was squishy and weird. She wasn’t sure if she liked it or not but said,
Ginny learns of the Triwizard Tournament.
Ginny had seen that lion’s head before. And that voice… it was so familiar.
“That was some dedication to quidditch. When I play will you come watch me?”
Ginny stood in the library, looking at Luna.
—————
“Erm, of course not. This time it also includes your love life.”
“Hey, Harry? I just wanted to wish you good-,” Harry was standing in the tent kissing Draco Malfoy. “What is going on?” Harry awkwardly pushed Malfoy away.
“Yeah. So are you and Malfoy… dating?”
He’d actually apologized to them a couple weeks ago, which was unexpected to everyone. For once, Draco had friends outside of his small Slytherin friend group.
“How about we meet at the Three Broomsticks?” Luna suggested.
“Why are you here? Want to know why I put my name in the Goblet of Fire do you?” Harry asked. His words were laced with venom and came out with more sass than she’d expected.
“Okay…”
“Shut up.”
It’s his laser gun, and he shoots me.
I’ll be updating on Tuesdays and Thursdays from now on!
However, these were all terribly awkward subjects that Ginny had no idea how to start talking about. For what was probably only a couple of seconds but felt like hours they both just stared at each other. Neither knew what to say.
“Yeah… he’s not as bad as everyone thinks though. He’s actually really great. He also feels really bad about everything he’s said to you guys. He also doesn’t believe in blood purism, by the way. It’s just his parents. He wants to make a formal apology to you and your family but we decided to wait until I came clean about the relationship. Oh and I guess this is my coming out to you as bi? I’ve been so worried about telling everybody about Draco, I guess I forgot to be worried about telling people I like guys along with girls.”
“That I like her,'' Ginny said quickly.
“Come with me Ginny, you have a sickness. It needs to be cured,” her mum said in a haunting tone.
You are formally invited to an exclusive party tomorrow night at 8:00.
He looked scared. Ginny felt her heart drop. If her dad was scared, it must be serious. George started to ask why but her dad cut him off.
“We’ve been friends for a couple months, we’ve been dating for about a month and a half, I’m planning on telling Ron and Hermione after our two month anniversary, I haven’t decided whether or not to tell your family yet, absolutely not. As for your last question; I just do. Obviously you can’t fully understand it because you weren’t there when he talked to me but I could just tell what he was saying was true. He’s not his family. He’s different. We have what, three years of childhood stupidity behind us? It’s not like he’s a death eater or anything. Sure, his dad might be but he’s not. And he doesn’t want to be. Like I said, he’s not a blood purist. He doesn’t support everything his family has done. I know this sounds so cliche but it’s true; he’s changed.”
Talking with Harry was nice. Ginny was relieved that she had finally done it. Having someone to talk to who also related to what you were experiencing was really nice and really helpful. Harry seemed to really understand it, and for that she was grateful.
“You can keep it, it looks better on you anyway,” Ginny said.
“Okay. I trust you, and I’ll try to trust Malfoy. Thanks for telling me. Now, I actually have something I need to tell you.”
Should this be my last letter?
“Yes. I actually do like you, is that so hard to believe?”
“Um... ok,” Ginny said. She was confused. Luna pulled out a book with a brilliantly illustrated cover. Then she opened it up and started reading.
“See you then!” Luna called out after her.
Now it was Harry’s turn to blush.
“Now, for the last demonstration. Avada Kedavra!” The spider quivered for a moment before completely falling limp. It was dead. “Class dismissed.”
They searched the forest for the others as everyone explained what had happened.
Remember to RSVP.
“The Goblet of Fire will shoot out the name of whoever it has chosen. If you are chosen, you can not back out. Entering your name means you completely understand the dangers of these trials and that you are prepared to compete. If I call your name you will walk over to where I am standing. Your Headmaster will take you aside and explain everything to you. Now then, let’s begin.” The Goblet let out a sudden roar and a great burst of fire. A small slip of paper burst from the fire and fell idly into the headmaster’s hand. “Our first tribute is Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons Academy!”
There was only one contestHe looked a lot happier than Crum had. Professor Dumbledore was just about to tell everyone off to bed when the ant left, and the Goblet had just spit out another name.
“Ok. Thank you,” Ginny said quietly. Luna smiled.
“It’s too bad we didn’t get to buy a thing though. I wanted to try one of those enchanted honeysickles,” Ginny said. Luna grinned mischievously and reached into her pocket. She pulled out a small bag. “What’s that?” Ginny asked. Luna untied the strings and reached in. To Ginny’s surprise she pulled out an assortment of treats.
Ginny got her wand out and used a hair dying spell she had heard her roommates use a few times. She hadn’t learned it properly and relied on her memory to cast the charm. She could only manage a few streaks, but it didn’t look so bad. She braided the light blue streaks into a half braid along the side of her head. It was very loose and carefree but somehow seemed to fit Luna.
“I have not! Well… okay, I have. But that’s none of your business.”
It had been a couple weeks since Luna and Ginny became official. They hadn’t told anybody yet, mostly because they didn’t really know anybody. Luna was seen as a freak by most people and Ginny was mostly ignored.
“Are you serious? Or are you joking?” the admirer asked. They sounded worried and hopeful in a too-good-to-be-true sort of way,
In her worries about trying out for Quidditch she had almost forgotten about the Quidditch World Cup. And they were bringing Harry! Ginny had long since gotten over her pathetic schoolgirl crush. Thinking back on it made her blush in embarrassing, but Harry was a nice person to talk to. She hoped they could be friends, and that maybe she could mean more to him than just
“Yeah,” Luna agreed. “Time flies.” They packed up the rest of the sweets in Luna’s bag and stood up.
“I guess I’m just used to everyone crowing me and asking if I’m ok. Yelling that I’m fine is just an instinct now.”
“Yeah. I wanted to talk to you, actually that’s why I came here in the first place,” Ginny said hesitantly. He looked so happy and she didn’t want to spoil the mood.
“Woah! Slow down!” Ginny said with a laugh. Luna ignored her and continued to run through the store until they tripped and knocked down a display case. Ginny was blushing furiously after landing right on top of Luna. She could smell her breath they were so close. Luckily their moment was interrupted by the lady working the store.
/\/\/\/\/\
Ginny blushed in embarrassment. She took a few steps closer to Luna. Luna walked towards her until they were so close Ginny could feel luna’s breath on her.
“Erm, sorry I’m late Professor. I had to stay a bit later at my last class.”
“Pansy, I am hurt,” I gasp in mock offense.
“The puffapod can cause dizziness when it blooms. Trolls are allergic to it too.”
“Wow,” Ginny said, looking up at the sky. “I can’t believe how long we’ve been here.”
“They’re really good.” Ginny took a sip and silently agreed. It was warm and delicious. It reminded her of home, but in a good way.
“I’m not telling anyone.”
When they got back to the castle Ginny parted ways with luna and sat down at the Gryffindor table while Luna sat at the Ravenclaw one. Dinner was a blur and all Ginny could think about was Luna.
Ginny smiled.
One: she had a crush on Luna Lovegood. It wasn’t debatable. Ginny was one that liked to find out facts. She always had a way of sorting information through her brain. All of the symptoms added up. The sweaty palms, fluttery stomach, her head spinning. Everything pointed to having a crush. Not to mention the mental image of her kissing Luna that constantly played on repeat in her mind. It somehow felt wrong... but also very right. There was her mother’s voice in her head, “it’s a sickness. Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to be cured.” But also Luna’s. Soft and understanding and nonjudgmental.
“Wait... aren’t you supposed to be at the Ravenclaw table? Isn’t that a rule?” Asked Ginny.
“Oh.” The admirer's voice had that familiar tone again… what was it? Suddenly it hit her. Luna. It was Luna’s voice.
“From Durmstrang, we have Viktor Crum!”
Chapter Six
Pansy and I are moping together in my room once again. Tomorrow is Saturday and the holiday I’ve been dreading.
“That is correct. Five points to Gryffindor. The puffapod has a rather particular way of blooming. Does anyone know how?” When nobody raised their hand Professor Sprout continued. “When the Puffapod comes in contact with a solid surface, it will immediately sprout. Now, as for you homework...”
“So?”, the girl asked.
“Where’s Ron and Harry? And Hermione?” Ginny asked. She hoped they were ok.
“Wow,” Ginny said in awe as she gazed at the shrieking shack. It was very tall and rickety and almost looked as though it would topple at any moment. There were many oddly shaped windows and one of them was cracked. It was a sight for sore eyes, if she was being honest. A howl came from the shack.
Unfortunately the year had been terrible. Teasing, name calling, bullying, you name it. It seemed like everyone hated Ginny. But at least she had gotten to go.
It’s the quidditch World Cup! But are things all that they seem?
The Goblet of Fire has chosen it's contestants.
“Hmm, it is? I can’t remember it ever being said, I suppose I’ll just have to wait and see if I get in trouble,” said Luna as she slid into the seat next to Ginny. “By the way, I’ll have to talk to some of the students from Durmstrang. Their heads are just full of wrackspurts, I’ll have to ask how they found them.”
“That is also correct. Five points to Gryffindor for the first person who answered and five points to Ravenclaw for the second.” He paused. “Does anyone know the third Unforgivable Curse?”
“It did!”
“It’s no problem at all,” and then she walked away.
“Are you trying out? Or do you just like watching them?”
“Do you think I could, I could maybe... erm, try out for the Quidditch team this year?”
“Out! All of you!” The lady ordered. Her finger was pointing at the door. Ginny and Luna looked at each other and started laughing uncontrollably. The lady glared and muttered something about ‘back in my day...’. Ginny and Luna ran out the door and laid down on the grass. They were still laughing and people were giving them strange looks as they passed.
Harry looked at the ground.
“But Ginny, I have one condition. If you get a bad enough injury that I have to be owled you have to quit the team, if you even make the team,” lectured her mum.
“Sure. I’ll be your date,” Potter says.
“Yes, that is correct,” Professor Moody said with a creepy smile. “Anyone else?”
“What did you say?”
Eventually, Professor Sprout led her students into the Great Hall. Professor Dumbledore was waiting in the Great hall and standing next to the Goblet of Fire. Almost all the students had arrived and the seats were packed. Ginny sat down at the Gryffindor Table. Luna plopped down in the seat beside her.
Of rejection and denial
“My hair! I hate you sometimes you know.”
All in all, Ginny was pretty proud of how well Harry had done
(See the end of the chapter for
[][][][][][][][][]
Once again I’m writing to you
Ginny finally recovered from her laughing fit and looked him straight in the eye.
“Yeah.”
“Laser tag. I’m taking Ron with me to laser tag. I think everyone is a bit stressed from school and exams coming up after the holidays so I figured going to something like this will be fun. All of you are invited of course.”
Where could he have gone?
“Ginny, we talked about this last year. Quidditch is dangerous, I don’t want you to get hurt.”
“Thank you, thank you, thank you! You won’t regret it, I should start practicing right away and-”
Finally Harry spoke, “I’m sorry. Uh- let’s just not speak of this ever again, okay?”
I was still very confused though. So I just wandered around, trying my best not to get shot but also not shooting anybody because I’m still not sure how this thing works.
The first younger student to try, was a sixth year Ravenclaw student named Wayne Johnson. He simply walked up to the goblet, clutching his paper, and tried to drop it in. However, once he was within three feet of the goblet, he was sprung backwards into the air. Wayne landed with a thump, and then, embarrassed, walked quickly out of the great hall. Everyone had been watching, and everyone started laughing when the poor boy fell. Ginny felt a bit bad for him, as he walked away, blushing furiously.
“Yeah, her veela powers will give her a leg up if she competes, it's definitely not fair!”
It was such a comfortable bed. So soft and pillowy. It was a lot nicer of a bed than the one she had at home.
After lots of searching, they finally found the trio and everything was sorted out. Apparently they also started chasing after Ginny, but Hermione and Ron realized Harry was missing so they left to go look for him. They did find him but were unable to find everyone else so they ran out into the woods so they could get away from the fires. Ginny’s mum and dad said that it was okay and that they were just glad that everyone was safe but she could see the look of worry plastered across their face. They were scared.
My train of thought is interrupted by Potter.
The admirer sounded disappointed and sad. Ginny felt sort of bad for the secret admirer. Besides, if the admirer told anyone then she’d know who the admirer was. It was a secret for a secret. She’d also kept the secret inside for so long that telling someone would be a relief. But then again her crush wasn’t exactly straight. It’d be better to keep it a secret.
“Yeah you git, your making my ears bleed,” agreed another.
“It’s ok, I’ve dropped my books loads of times, I’m sure one more drop won’t hurt,” Luna said calmly.
Draco felt a blush creep up onto his neck and face. Now he knew that one of his biggest fears was true. He had a crush on Harry. And based on Professor Whitlock’s teachings, a rather strong one at that.
“Very well. The other curse is the imperious curse. It controls the mind of the thing you cast it on. Allow me to demonstrate.” Professor Moody pulled out a jar. Inside was a common looking spider. He let it out and it scampered across the table for a bit.
Ginny sighed. She wanted- needed -someone to talk to about all this. She wondered if maybe Harry could relate.
“Okay,” Harry agreed. “Could you give us a minute? We were kind of in the middle of something here.”
“Dear Luna,
“But mum! That was, it was years ago! Plus Fred and George are in the team. I won’t get hurt, promise!” She argued.
“Hey!” Ginny called out. Harry turned his head to look at her.
Ginny tucked the letters in her bag and walked up all the stairs to her dorm.
“Hullo everyone! You all can call me Hagrid, ther’ll be no need for Professor in my class,” Hagrid said cheerily.
“Yes,” Luna said sadly. Noticing Ginny’s curiosity Luna explained further, “my mum dies when I was eight. She was a bit crazy and she loved to experiment with magic. One day her experimenting went wrong and,” Luna gestured with her hands. “I saw her die,” she said quietly.
The once teeny tiny spiders that were crawling about were now huge. The screaming intensified and Ginny laughed when she saw Ron put his feet on the chair.
“Eh. He’s pretty oblivious to everything, I doubt he’s caught on.”
Ginny thrust out her hand and grabbed the portkey. She shut her eyes tight and felt a strange sucking feeling in her stomach. Her head hurt painfully and she felt like she was going to be sick. It was over in less than a couple of seconds and Ginny opened her eyes. She felt a tiny bit a relief when she saw that her siblings were just as flustered as she was. Ginny followed her family to a tent, when she looked inside she saw just how big it really was. There were multiple rooms and carpeting. It looked like a small house.
“Sure.”
“We’re not at Hogwarts Percy, or did you forget? You prefect badge and head boy status mean nothing here at the burrow!”
The professors eyes twinkled and he looked over to Professor Flitwick, who was wheeling along a cart. There was a sheet on top of the cart and it looked to be covering something quite bulky. Dumbledore pulled off the sheet and revealed a golden trophy. It glittered and shined. It was a marvelous sight.
What was that?
Luna met up with Ginny and they walked outside. There were large bleachers set up for everyone to sit on and three very big tents set up in front. There was also a smaller tent that Harry and the other contestants were walking into. Ginny walked into the smaller tent so she could wish him good luck.
“Hello Ginny,” Luna said with a cruel sneer that was completely unlike her nature.
Ginny goes to hogsmead with Luna.
“No,” and strutted away. Along with Dariah, three other gryffindors, two hufflepuffs, one Ravenclaw, and a Slytherin all put their names in that day. There were also 15 students from the other schools.
Luna frowned.
The next student to enter was a Slytherin girl by the name of Judy. Judy walked up nervously and then dropped her name in. A great flame of blue fire rose up into the air when the parchment was dropped. Judy sprang back and let out a shriek. The entire Great hall -Ginny included- joined in uproarious laughter as the now blushing Judy scampered away. Judy, Wayne, and three other students were the only ones to (try to) enter .
“What could you possibly know about my love life?” Pansy asks. She drapes herself across the bed across from me.
“…happy?”
“Oh it isn’t? Do tell who the secret love of your life is. You just have fallen pretty hard if you refuse to tell even me, your best friend, who it is.”
“It’s a lovely surprise. Now pass me a chocolate frog!”
“Ron and Harry weren’t abducted by-
“Potter, now is not the time for jokes! Who put you up to this? It was Weaslette, right? Aren’t you guys a couple?”
When Ginny arrived she saw Fred and George standing by the Goblet of fire, holding glass vials full of a liquid.
A great cheer broke out across the great hall. Ginny even  heard a few people yell, “GO HOGWARTS!”
“Dear Ginny,
Finally, after five days of anticipation and slacking off, the day was here. Today was the day that the winners would be announced, and the whole school was going to find out who had been chosen. Ginny personally hoped it was someone from gryffindor, because of house pride and all that, but honestly she just didn't want a Slytherin representing the school. That’s what she thought as she rose out of bed to go to her Herbology class. She was supposed to wait there until it was time to join the rest of the school to find out who the winners were.
“Um… sorry. The reason why I asked you here is because I have to ask you something.”
I wish I could tell you
Harry comes over to me and I thank him.
“Hey mum?” Ginny asked cautiously.
“What is it?”
It was the day of the first task and also the day Ginny would be coming out to Harry. They were both, to say the least, nervous.
I get to Harry. I kind of gesture to the person who was about to shoot me and Harry pulls out his own laser gun and gets into a weird laser battle with my attacker.
“Oh, I’m Luna Lovegood. Who are you?”
—————————————————————————
Thankfully the year before had been pretty calm. Sure, Sirius black the killer had been on the loose but he hadn’t caused much harm. Plus, she had overheard Ron and Harry talking about Sirius Black during the summer and judging from the tone of voice they were using, Ron and Harry had gone after and even met the killer. If Ron could survive it, so could she.
“What do you think about the Triwizard Tournament? It sounds pretty dangerous but if I was old enough I’d enter,” asked Ginny.
“I think you may have used a bit too much cologne, it reeks of you in here.”
“Of course.”
“Well, I actually had something I was wanting to ask you.”
Ginny send some letters... and receives a mysterious love note in return.
“Hi Ginny!” Hermione said brightly as she followed Ron and Harry.
“So what did you want to talk to me about?” Harry asked after class.
That was another thing, Draco had started to hang out with Weasley and Granger. He wasn’t nearly as comfortable around them as he was with Harry, but he didn’t feel too awkward spending time with them as long as Harry was there.
Pretty soon after that, a strange girl came to her seat. She said something but Ginny wasn’t paying attention to her words. Ginny was transfixed by her beauty. The girl had long blond hair and huge triangle shaped glasses covering her eyes. They were silver, with specks of grey and blue. Ginny was sure she had never seen prettier eyes.
“Erm, Luna? What is a thestral?”
“I’m taking you to play laser tag.”
“Come on, I want to show you my dorm,” Luna said as she yanked Ginny up a winding staircase. Her dorm also had a mysterious air to it. It was one of five so apparently she only had to share with one person. There were two beds, one was decorated with stars and other decorations. She other wasn't bare, but looked rather plain in comparison. The dorm was so- so Luna. It was perfect.
The spider twitched in agony before falling limp.
“Yes, that was me.”
Draco noticed he was nervous too. He wasn’t shaking like Draco, but instead shifting his weight between each side, which Draco had noticed was something Harry often did while nervous.
Honestly they suck
It still felt weird to think about.
“This whole thing? Did you really think I had a crush on you? After all this time? I had a crush on you when I was like ten, I’m thirteen now. That crush is long gone. Also, was that your idea of a nice resection? ‘I don’t mean to hurt your feelings but I wouldn’t date you if my life depended on it.’ You should be pretty glad that I actually wanted to play quidditch with you today and I wasn’t asking you out,” Ginny explained. Harry looked at her for a few moments before realizing what she had just said.
There was a cauldron filled with potion at the front of the room. When Draco got closer to it, the smell seemed to intensify.
It really had been the perfect day.
“You are welcome.”
The other brother chipped in with a “yeah, blame those filthy death eaters.” Mum sent him a glare.
“You do.”
“Ron’s sister”. She ran upstairs and sat on her bed. Maybe the summer could be better after all.
One had light brown skin and short brown hair. Her name was... Addison Levi.
Luna laughed and sat up so she could look at Ginny.
Ginny decided that she needed to talk to Harry Potter. She didn’t know why, but he seemed to be the only person she could talk to. She had a feeling that he’d either understand or have advice. She also felt that he probably wanted to talk somebody about the Triwizard Tournament. It had been a couple days since he’d been chosen and it was now common news that Ron -her own brother- had stopped talking to the golden boy himself. Nobody knew why, and rumors were spreading like wildfire. Ginny was ashamed of her brother, and felt bad for Harry. So she decided to talk to him.
Nobody said anything. The cruciatus and the killing curse were the most well known of the three curses.
“Wait, the carriages aren’t pulled by anything. I thought they were magicked to fly by themselves.”
Then I see something- someone- out of the corner of my eye. It’s Harry!
Draco dramatically collapsed onto Pansy’s lap.
So she decided to go to the library and work on her homework. Besides, who needs friends anyway?
“We both have people we want to impress, right? Or at least we both have people we want to be our Valentine.” She sees my frown. “Oh don’t even try to deny it. I think the entire school is aware that you have a giant crush on somebody. Even bloody Potter probably knows.”
“The Unforgivables are a set of three curses. These three curses are technically illegal to use. Can anyone name an Unforgivable Curse?”
She had started rambling. Rambling! Ginny Weasley didn’t ramble! Or stutter! Or feel like butterflies were flying in her stomach whenever she talked to people or start feeling nervous. Well, she guessed she’d established that Luna made her do lots of things she didn’t normally do. But despite all of the nerves and stuttering, all Ginny wanted to do was spend time with Luna. “Oh no, Luna... she probably thinks I’m crazy or stupid or both,” thought Ginny. She looked up at Luna, expecting to see that she was weirded out or maybe that she pitied Ginny. But instead she saw a smile.
“Here,” she said and handed Luna the mirror. “I know it’s not as fancy or advanced or as pretty as yours but do you like it?”
Professor Moody gave her a scary look. “Ah, so you’d rather I stop hurting the spider?”
But just know, please know
“Have you seen Harry? Neville told me you were off looking for him,” Hermione said.
It was a spell she had been working on for awhile. It was similar to the bat bogey hex however with this one instead of bogeys turning into bats, spiders simply crawled out your nose. Sure enough, the girls started screaming and flailing about.
“Thank you. For bringing me there today, I loved it, I really did.” Luna’s cheeks turned a faint pink and she smiled shyly.
At the beginning of the year Professor Whitlock (the new potion’s professor for eight year) assigned everyone seats. They’d matched partners according to skill level, pairing students that needed a bit more help with students that didn’t need as much help, so the more talented partner could help the one that needed it.
“...we were running out of the tent when we saw the..” he dropped his voice lower, as thought it was a bad word, “...dark mark...” his voice returned to its normal, quiet, tone, “then you started running and we tried to chase after you but then somebody shot out fire and we were separated. Then we realized that Ron, Harry, and Hermione were gone too. I guess we got separated from them during the time when we chased after you. Ginny felt guilty. It was her fault everyone had gotten separated! Apparently her brother could sense her guilt because he said “now Ginny, don’t blame yourself!”
“Wow. I didn’t know you were such a good artist!”  Luna blushed.
/\/\/\/\/\/\
That morning she got a letter from the family owl.
“I’d like to talk to you after the contest if that’s okay. I suppose I’m okay with you and Malfoy but I won’t lie, I am confused. You and him don’t make sense in my mind but if you're happy…”
Im updating a little early, since I have school tomorrow and wouldn’t have time to post until later. Tell me what you think!
A whole bunch of girls were whispering about Fleur. Ginny barely noticed, as she was too busy staring at the veela. She was transfixed by the other girl’s beauty. Fleur’s movement’s were graceful and gorgeous. It wasn’t until Fleur had completely left the room that Ginny broke out of her trance. She glanced at Luna who also looked as though she had just woken up. No, it couldn’t be. Luna wasn’t… no. She wasn’t. I’d never be that lucky.
The school cheered loudly and a few boys even whistled. Fleur ran up to her Headmaster, smiling, and they left the hall. Ginny had cheered quite loudly for Fleur as well but now that she had left, the trance like feeling was gone. She looked over at Luna, who had that sleepy smile plastered on her face. The same smile she had at the beginning of the week.
Harry was waiting nervously for Draco to arrive. He had invited the blond to the room of requirement and was planning to ask him out. He hadn’t prepared anything big or special since he wasn’t really planning on Draco saying yes. He had, however, bought a necklace with a green emerald in the center, in case Draco said yes.
Ginny ushered Harry to the Astronomy tower. It was the most private place she could think of, and it held good memories. It seemed like the best place to (a) talk to Harry about Malfoy and (b) come out to him and tell him about Luna.
It’s not like I’ve got a chance
For the record, I think lasers are extremely dangerous.
Harry stumbled into the dragon’s inclosure. Ginny couldn’t quite make out what he was doing, since he was so far away. Then, something came whizzing through the air and Harry was flying. It was his broom! He flew in circles, faster and faster until the dragon was dizzy. He quickly snatched the egg and flew up high enough that the dragon couldn’t reach him.
What?! Ginny’s hand’s clenched. Where were they?
Now this is a topic I can talk about. I smirk.
Ginny blushed and picked up the books Luna had dropped when they bumped together.
“Announcement in the Great Hall! Announcement in the Great Hall! Come to the Great Hall quickly! McGonnagall said so and she’s pretty scary when she’s mad so you BETTER COME QUICK!”
She couldn’t remember it ever being said but it seemed like the sort of thing you just knew.
Time: tomorrow, Wednesday at 8:00 pm.
“Oh, sorry,” Ginny said.
After I found him I kind of muttered something along the lines of, “can we talk?” But he didn’t hear me so he kind of assumed I was about to make fun of him. And then I just kind of yelled, “can we talk?” Really loudly. And then he was like, “okay.”
Professor Moody let the spider crawl around on her face for a couple more seconds before making it drop to the floor. He had it float to his desk and dropped his hold on the spider. The girl whimpered before running out of the room. Ginny wondered if maybe she should run too, but decided against it.
“Don’t play dumb with me. I see the way you look at me in the halls, how you blush when I talk. Your sick! You have to be cured!”
Okay, deep breaths, she told herself. She took a deep breath and let it out. In, and out. In, and out. It’ll be okay.
“I just thought you should know that I believe you didn’t put your name in the Goblet of Fire and also if you ever need to talk I’m here.”
“Ah, just to find Harry. I need to talk to him.”
Chapter four
“Thank you,” Luna whispered. She grabbed her wand and said, “I've been working on some charms that can dye hair and make flowers, do you mind if I use one on you?”
Ginny sat down across from Luna. “So, why’d you ask me to come here?”
“Help me! Get them off! Get them off!” Ginny smirked.
I sighed. “No, I haven’t. I want to, but I’m not sure how they’d react. They’ve never been homophobic but you never know. You’re the first person I’ve told other than Luna.”
“He doesn’t look so happy, I hope he’s okay,” pointed out Luna. She’d just confirmed Ginny’s suspicions.
“Oh um, sure.” Ginny cleared her voice and tried to clear her head. “I’d love a copy. Do you want to sit with me?” Ginny crossed her fingers and hoped she said yes. There was something about this girl. She was beautiful of course but also seemed like a good person. A kindred spirit, you could say. She wanted to get to know this strange, beautiful, girl.
“You don’t have to do that,” urged Luna. She was hugging the coat tight though and Ginny could see she needed it.
“Thank you,” Luna said as she sat down in the empty seat. Luna pulled out a hair clip and used it to secure a few strands of hair.
She folded up the letter and sent it away.
My school is out for winter break so I’ll try to write more. Maybe 2 chapters a week again? I’ll try.
She first looked in the library, where she saw neville. She quickly scanned the room and then started to scurry off
Ginny cleared her voice. She knew all three but was only knowledgeable about one.
While Blaise still didn’t trust the Gryffindors, Pansy had joined Draco in becoming friends with them. Actually, Pansy and Weasley had unexpectedly become pretty good friends. And Draco seemed to get along fairly well with Granger.
“What’s hilarious?” Harry asked. Ginny didn’t even hear him, she was laughing so hard. “What’s hilarious?” He demanded again.
“I’m Ginny. Ginny Weasley.” So this was Luna Lovegood. She couldn’t remember seeing her around but she had overheard the cruel whispers of loony Lovegood. She searched Luna’s face for signs of worry or hurt but all she found was happiness. Did the cruel whispers not affect her?
“No, they are pulled by thestrals. You can only see the thestrals if you’ve witnessed a death though, so it’s not surprising you can’t see them,” Luna explained.
It is most definitely not a foolproof plan.
“Anyway, right now we need to finish the Amortentia.”
“Is that Victor Crum?”
“Was it hard?”
“You!” mimicked the other.
“Yeah. That sounds perfect.”
“N-no!” Ginny protested. She begged to stay at Hogwarts as her mum dragged her away. All of the students faces were blurring around her and a sea of voices chanted,
“Do not! Now let me go fix my hair so I can finally ask Harry out!”
“There,” Luna said suddenly. She handed Ginny a mirror. “Do you like it?” Ginny looked into the mirror. Her hair was a light pink that looked even better than her natural red. It worked for her. There were also dark and pastel blue flowers braided into a crown on top of her head. She loved it.
I blush a bit, embarrassed.
“I knew you would.”
And three: Luna must never, ever know. It would mess everything up. Luna would feel awkward and Ginny would feel awkward. Luna would probably think she was disgusting and awful. She’d probably lose her friendship. Luna would stop talking to her or worse... Luna would tell people and she would be a laughing stock. Just one more thing to add to her ruined reputation.
“Hmm, how about we go to Honeydukes, then Zonko’s and after that we can go to the shrieking shack,” Ginny offered. Anything was fine with her though.
It quivered for a bit before a girl yelled, “Please! Stop that! It’s hurting the poor spider!”
Ginny smirked. “Good luck Harry!”
“Now that everyone is here, I will start teaching you about this plant. Does anyone know what it is?”
Luna laughed. It was a sweet sounding laugh. Loud and quick. Kind of like the tinkling of bells.
Now he and Harry didn’t just spend time together during Potion’s. Sometimes they had mini Quidditch matches against each other. And sometimes he’d eat with Harry and his Golden Trio.
“Well then tell him!”
Luna sprang off the windowsill and looked at Ginny, straight in the eyes.
Harry had just shrugged awkwardly and agreed. Nobody seemed to notice how uncomfortable Harry felt- everyone except Ginny. She went to bed that night thinking about Quidditch and friends. She dreamt about going to the Quidditch World Cup. She dreamt that one of the Quidditch players asked her to compete with them and that Ginny helped them to win the World Cup. It was a fabulous dream.
Probably a mix of both.
She was wearing a rose gold dress with a silver tiara and rose gold gloves. The dress had a turtleneck and was sleeveless. It stopped at Luna’s knees. She looked beautiful.
That was, until a rather pretty, blond, fourth year walked into the owlery.
“I doubt anyone will pay much attention to us. Personally, I don’t care who knows. I’m out to my dad and he doesn’t care. But I know that you aren’t out. As long as we don’t do anything really romantic nobody will notice.”
“Professor Flitwick told everyone today that today is the first day for Hogsmead! I’m pretty sure that the third years meet up with their head of house to go over the rules at... oh yeah, 2:00,” Luna said excitedly. “I’m a fourth year so I don’t have to do the permission stuff but we can meet up somewhere if you’d like.” Her silver eyes were shining.
“It’s ok,” Luna reassured.
Ginny found an owl by her window when she got back to her dorm. It was one she’d seen only once before, the owl that had brought her the love letter. She’d nearly forgotten about it after everything that had happened. Sure enough, the owl was holding a letter. She opened the parchment and read the contents.
“I’m not over-dramatic.”
Ginny has a bad dream, and Luna takes her on a “date”
“I told you I’d come. Should I sit down?”
Ginny hopped through the fat lady’s portrait into the hall. She winced when her bag of books slammed against her leg. Normally she didn’t carry so many books but she was going on a study date with Luna and wasn’t sure what they were going to do exactly...
Luna blushed profusely.
“It’s… complicated. I'll tell you eventually. Don’t worry about it, it’s not dangerous or anything. Just… complicated.”
“Today is the day of the first task. Each of our contestants will have to retrieve a golden egg. It holds a clue to the second task. Each of our judges will score the other contestants. The first to complete the task is none other than Harry Potter!”
“Yeah. I’ve had a crush on you for a while too, yknow. We can meet for the Valentines dance at 8?”
She frowned and felt a bit disappointed.
“Harry, we need to talk.”
They sat and drank their butterbeers until Luna spoke up.
Luna hopped onto her bed and motioned for Ginny to sit next to her.
On the first day of her week of classes, she bumped into Luna in the halls. Literally.
The two spent the rest of the afternoon laying on the grass, laughing and talking. It was a great way to spend time.
“We have to pick Harry up from the Dursley’s today so you can’t practice but we are going to the Quidditch World Cup so I suppose you can watch the players and take notes.”
“Well then,” the secret admirer said as they took off their mask and revealed a tumble of blonde hair. “I like you too.”
Ginny thought calming thoughts until she finally went to sleep.
“What are you doing here?” The blond asked.
“I can’t wait for the tryouts.”
Ginny knew it was Fred and Percy, arguing as usual. She heard a loud sigh as she walked down the stairs and took a seat at the dinner table. Dinner that night was a loud mix of complimenting the food and talking about how exited everyone was for the Quidditch World Cup.
The answer to these questions is probably not.
“You!” One of the twins said as he pointed towards the other.
“You may begin making your potions,” Professor Whitlock announced.
Love, Ginny Weasley.”
“Dad! We found her!” Fred or George yelled. We? Soon her dad came running towards her. Accompanying him was the other twin, Mum, and Percy.
“Yeah?”
“Course not,” Ginny replied. She felt a faint blush reach her cheeks so she focused all her attention on the headmaster.
“Ginny. What should she know?” The admirer asked slowly.
“Hey!”
Luna woke up. She was sweating and her heart raced. She quietly walked to the bathroom and doused her face in cold water. She locked the door and looked at herself in the mirror. She could still hear the voices chanting in her head.
Pansy smirked.
What if she wasn’t Luna? And, what if she was Luna and this was all a joke?
“I think it’s cute that you sent a letter to your mum. I’m sure she’ll be happy,” Luna said.
“No,” Luna started to say. Her heart dropped and she felt a wave of disappointment crash over her.
“Actually… I kind of do… I’m dating Luna.”
“Yes, he is but I suppose the Goblet made an exception for the Golden Boy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
She clutched the sides of her head as though it would stop the voices. As soon as she realized what she was doing though, she dropped her hands from embarrassment. It was a good thing she was one of the only ones there, she didn’t want to cause a scene.
Draco finally came. He was a couple minutes late.
“You have a sickness. You have a sickness.”
Again, kudos and comments are highly appreciated! (Even the ones begging me to update)
Draco’s Eighth Year at Hogwarts seemed to be his happiest year yet.
“Hey Harry?”
Here’s an extra chapter, enjoy!

(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah it was awesome!”
“What starts with E, ends with E, and only has one letter in it?” the painting asked.
“Yeah I did.”
“Yeah…”
Ginny shakily raised her hand.
“What are you talking about? What did I do?” Harry asked as he looked at her. He was obviously confused.
Ginny looked at her in disbelief. Did she really not think badly of her? So far it felt like all she had done was make a fool of herself in front of Luna and somehow, somehow she didn’t care.
“Me too,” Luna whispered back.
“Ok, I won’t tell anyone on one condition.”
“S-sorry,” Ginny stammered.
“What is it? Did I do something? I’m sorry if I did.” No! It’s not your fault. I’ve got to get out of here.
Luna looked at her in confusion. “You can’t what?”
“Calm down, I’m teasing. It would be terrific though if you could wear it. That lion head was awesome.”
Eventually I see Ron and Hermione, both cornering somebody. I pay no attention to them.
She was having a hard time deciding whether she loved being with Luna or hated being with her. She always got so, so- so nervous around Luna but she was so beautiful and mysterious. She was so calm and kind, and seemed so understanding. Ginny longed to get to know her- to spend time with her. Luna made her feel a way nobody else did.
To which Dariah responded with a,
“So where do you want to go next?” She asked.
“Anything for my over-dramatic boyfriend.”
“Ok?”
“Care of magical creatures is my favorite. We could always study that.”
He motioned to Professor Flitwick, who had left to get something else and had now returned. Professor Flitwick pulled the sheet off the mysterious something and the students gasped in awe. It was a giant goblet, with blue fames leaping out of it. It looked to be made of a particularly strong stone and was faded with age. It was magnificent.
Sure, Harry was still ridiculously perfect and annoying, but he wasn’t too bad. They’d sort of become… friends.
“Oh! I’m sorry, I thought you were mad at me. That’s why I was avoiding you today. If you ever need to step out and calm down then it’s ok. I’ll understand.” Luna sounded a bit guilty but also relieved.
Dear Ginny,
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy, Hermione, Ron, Harry, Blaise, Luna, Ginny, and I had all become friends. It was something I’d never expected but I was happy it had happened nonetheless. I also was on fairly good terms with Neville, though he hadn’t come back to Hogwarts for Eighth Year so we weren’t really friends.
“Oh, can you see them?” Asked Ginny.
Now it’s Pansy’s turn to blush.
“What are you talking about?!” Ginny cried.
“I know perfectly well what you said, what I want to know is why,”
“Hmm, I used that too. Have you used the spell before?”
Draco froze. Could he… no. I didn’t use cologne though.
-Ginny
“After class, we need to talk,” Draco said.
“Your a monster!” Luna yelled. “You have a sickness!”
Ugh. Ginny liked most of her classes but Professor Binns made everything so boring. Herbology with Professor Sprout wasn’t too bad though.
“No, of course not.” I got down on one knee and held out the necklace box. “Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you do me the honor of being my Prom date?”
“I didn’t steal, I paid for them while you were in the loo,” said Luna. “I wanted it to be a surprise,” she added quietly.
“Nasum aranearum,” Ginny whispered with a flick of her wand.
And you’re all I think of
Morning came and Ginny was freaking out. All of her anxieties seemed to be dancing in the front of her brain.
It turned out that learning about flobberworms was dreadfully boring. Ginny had hoped to learn about something more interesting, like the hippogriff Ron got to learn about the year before! She guessed that after the Malfoy disaster last year, Hagrid was going to teach about less dangerous creatures. One perk about Magical Creatures was that they weren’t assigned much homework, so that was nice.
Chapter two
Ginny sighed. The girl had a large stack of magazines tucked under her arm. Ginny knew most people wouldn’t be so kind and buy them. She hoped that at least the girl wouldn’t be made fun of but Ginny knew she would probably get teased and, speaking from experience, Ginny didn’t want the girl to get teased.
Thanks for the people who left kudos on my story! I’ll be posting the next six chapters today, as promised.
BlueBelle
“Draco, it’s times like these where I wonder why I became friends with you. And what are you going on about with all this ‘true love’ stuff? It’s not the love of my life or anything, it’s just a crush. Save the dramatics for your own love life.”
“W-what are you doing?” Ginny asked.
You’d think that after dating since fifth year, Harry would know enough about me to know that this is not a good idea.
“Draco,” Pansy began. “He likes you. He like-likes you. And he must like you a lot for your smell to be in his Amortentia potion.”
I try to call out to him but before I can, I see somebody pointing their laser thing at me.
The girl nodded. “Yes. Please.”
Ginny heard thumping on the stairs and someone yell, “No running in the halls!”
My writing ability isn’t great
Draco walked into class and surveyed the potions room. He didn’t see Harry anywhere, not that he was looking for him. No, he was just surveying the room for fun, not looking for Harry at all. It was just a coincidence he noticed Harry wasn’t at Potion’s class. He certainly didn’t care where Harry was, he certainly didn’t care about Harry in general and he definitely didn’t have a crush on him.
()()()
“That explains a lot,” she whispered to herself. “I have a few more questions about Malfoy, but before we talk more about that I have something to tell you,” Ginny said, this time talking to Harry. She took a deep breath. “I’m also bisexual. I didn’t know that you could be attracted to multiple genders, let alone that there was a label for it. But I’m fairly sure this is what I am. I like both guys and girls, and I don’t really have a preference.”
Oh dear god.
“Thank you,” she said shyly. “Most people are scared of thestrals but I think they’re quite nice. Sometimes I find them in the forbidden forest, they always come up to me and I’ve never gotten attacked. I find them to be peaceful creatures.”
Draco wondered how his train of thought had managed to think about the topic of his absolutely nonexistent crush on Harry.
“Anytime,” Ginny replied. They walked back up to the castle and parted ways. Harry rushed off and said he had to go to the library. When she asked why, he said something about studying with Hermione. He looked oddly eager to study, though.
It turned out that Luna’s book was filled with lots of interesting magical creatures. It talked about unicorns and hippogriffs and so many other creatures. Eventually they got to the topic of thestrals.
Draco
Everyone cheered. A group of people went to calm the dragon while the minister ushered Harry to fly down. He was mostly unhurt, other than some scratches. Nonetheless, he was still taken to the medical tent while the other contestants fought their dragons. The next was Fleur, and then Cedric, and then Krum. At the end of the contest, Krum and Harry were tied for first, though Karkaroff had scored Harry pretty unfairly.
“Really?”
“Your here! I mean, I knew you’d come but I was a little worried you’d bail,” Luna rambled, blushing slightly. Why the heck is she blushing? Ginny let out a small laugh.
Her mum started to speak again and she frowned. Is it another condition? she wondered.
The only one to hold class as usual was Professor Snape. The teacher was a disfavorite among most, other than the Slytherins he so greatly favorited and also, Luna Lovegood. It was during potions that the twins finally decided to make their debut. Someone's voice (probably Lee’s) cried out through the halls, announcing the news. Everyone rushed out of class to watch, and for once the teachers didn’t stop them.
“Yes?”
“Yes Ginny?” Asked her mum with a sigh.
“Now the flobberworm has some interesting properties...”
(See the end of the chapter for
Chapter 17
Ginny paused, should she tell her mum about the letter? Maybe her mum could ask her brothers? It probably couldn’t hurt. She crumbled up the letter and threw it away. She decided to start over.
“It worked!”
“No.”
“Ok... do you want to go do something? We could go hang out in the common room or somewhere else if you want,” Ginny suggested.
I hear Pansy sigh. She is also moping about. Apparently she’s been crushing on somebody in Hufflepuff, but nobody knows who.
The students nodded.
Ginny had thought her mum was being irrational. She still thought her mum had been being irrational. Frankly, she was worried her mum wouldn’t let them go back to Hogwarts after what happened at the Quidditch World Cup but thankfully it seemed that although what had happened was scary- it didn’t need to interfere with their education. Thank goodness, she thought.
Thank you all for the kudos! I’ve started three Drarry works so if you ship it (like me) then check those out! Don’t worry, this is still my top priority but sometimes I need a break, ya know? Anyways, the next update will be on Monday. Enjoy!
“Oh, I-I’m sorry. L-let me help y-you,” Ginny stuttered.
“I’m in my third.” Ginny couldn’t believe she wasn’t already leaving. Her first year mistakes had branded her as the girl who opened the chamber of secrets. Most people tried to avoid her when they found out who she was. But hey, maybe this year could be different. Maybe some of them had forgotten about the chamber of secrets, or at least didn’t care so much.
“I can’t believe they even let her enter!” whispered one girl.
“Okay. Thanks for telling me. I’ve got to go now, but just know I’m always here to talk, okay?”
“I agree, he doesn’t look so good. He’s a pro quidditch player though, so I thought he’d be used to the attention.”
I’d like to say two things.
Draco blushed.
An unexpected visitor arrives in the owlery.
“Luna?” It would be too good to be true. It couldn’t be Luna. But… what if it was?
How her hair fell gracefully off her head, how her eyes seemed to sparkle when she smiled. Oh, and her smile. It was like sparkling diamonds, she looked so happy. It was an emotion Ginny didn’t see that much.
“So beautiful.”
(See the end of the chapter for
She shuddered, worried that her dream would become a reality. But when she looked into Luna’s eyes, she saw kindness and understanding. Ginny grabbed the other girls hand and they walked out of the pub.
Okay, here it goes. I can do it, I can do it.
“Yes?”
Draco nodded.
“Really?” Luna asked softly.
“Ok,” Ginny agreed.
“I don’t know.”
“You really do like me? This isn’t some sort of cruel joke?”
You have a sickness, you have a sickness. She screamed in her head for it to stop. The voices felt as though they were getting louder, though Ginny knew it was all in her head. She quickly threw open the toilet seat and vomited. She sat there, on the floor for a while. She felt a bit better and the voices were gone, but she had a raging headache. Eventually she crawled back to her bed and tried to fall asleep.
It sounded oddly familiar. Ginny got out of the corner.
Ginny held her breath and waited for an answer. She hoped with all she had her mum would agree to let her.
Dumbledore paused until the cheers subsided, and then continued, “Now, you are all wondering how the student will be chosen, yes?”
If it all fails I can at least pretend it was a dare.
Ginny stopped herself. She was rambling again. So much for not making a fool out of myself. Ugh, what was it about this girl? She makes me feel so nervous, but I love spending time with her. It’s like the nervous-y feeling aren’t pleasant but I’m willing to overlook them for... what? Luna? I’m willing to overlook bad feelings for a girl I’ve only known for a week? Ginny asked herself that but she already knew the answer. It was yes. She was always willing to drop everything for just seeing Luna. Maybe she couldn’t admit it to herself yet, but it was true. Whether she liked it or not.
He hadn’t wanted to come back, but he felt like he owed it to his mother. She had always wanted him to get a proper education. Plus, he knew she was worried for him. The only good thing that had come from him coming back for his eight year was his new friendship with Harry. Spending time with Harry helped him in more ways than one. Draco had learned that Harry also had recurring guilt after the war, and the two of them were slowly recovering together. Of course, Draco wished for more than friendship with Harry. Pansy and Blaise- the only other two returning eight years other than Theo Nott -loved to tease him about it. During a game of unbreakable truth or dare, Draco had agreed to ask Harry out to the Wizard Proml, a decision he greatly regretted. Draco didn’t want to ruin his friendship with Harry, but going to the ball with him did sound nice. If he refused then Draco would simply tell him it was a dare and hopefully no bad feelings would remain. He was going to say no, Draco was sure of that. The Golden Boy was straight and didn’t he have a girlfriend? Even if he wasn't straight, or he didn't have a girlfriend, he’d never go out with a guy like me.
She didn’t wait to see if it worked for her to yell another spell, “obscuro!”
Professor Whitlock’s voice interrupted his thoughts.
Hermione’s cheerful manner did little to mask the disappointment blooming in Ginny’s chest.
All throughout the week, seventh years were going up to the goblet of fire and putting their name in. A few underage students tried as well, but… failed.
Chapter Seven
Oh! I know this one. Ginny raised her hand.
One boy raised his hand.
“Harry… I didn’t use cologne today…”
After an awkward pause of silence, Professor Moody decided to explain what they were himself.
Now I’m making my way around the room, trying to find Harry.
After around and hour (but seemed like five) she managed to find the great hall and ate lunch. She was sitting at the Gryffindor table, surrounded by other Gryffindors but feeling quite lonely, when Luna walked in. Ginny stood up and ran over to Luna.
Ginny didn’t necessarily mind the letters, but they were odd. The idea that Fred and George had written them seemed pretty dubious now that she’d received another. Maybe she could meet the secret admirer? She wanted to know who it was pretty badly and she also wanted to tell the admirer she had feelings for someone else.
“Yes.”
TW: internalized homophobia
“Maybe sometime you can take me to see them,” Ginny said quickly and instantly regretted saying it.
“Five points off Gryffindor. Take a seat, Mr. Harry.”
“Wait what? I’m not Luna. I mean, who’s luna? Definitely not me. Nope, not luna over here. You know, i should probably just go…”  The secret admirer- who ginny suspected was luna -turned to leave.
Chapter 16
Okay, first things first, she thought. First is what I’ll wear. It said to wear something nice, as though I was going to the Yule Ball.
It didn’t just smell like Harry, though. It also smelled like the Slytherin common room and just seemed comforting.
Ginny immediately wrote back.
Ginny explored the tent (if you could call it that) and found a kitchen. Harry, Ron, Hermione and the twins were standing there. They all waited until her parents told everyone the game was starting. Ginny followed everyone (it seemed like she was doing this a lot) to where the Quidditch game was happening. The game was wonderful. The crowds were cheering and the snacks were great. Ginny cheered for her team and felt pure happiness. Today has been perfect. Once it was halftime the family made there way back to the tent. Everyone was running around and talking excitedly about the game.
Dear Ginny,
Luna started weaving her wand through Ginny’s hair and whispered various charms. They sat in a comfortable silence for a while as Luna worked her magic. It was very calming and sweet.
It was very early when Ginny woke up. Well, she didn’t really wake up per-se, she just got tired of laying in bed and decided that 5 am was an appropriate time to get up. She hadn’t gotten much rest after the nightmare. She drifted in and out of sleep for hours before she decided to ditch the idea of sleep altogether. Her headache was still painful and she felt awful but she managed to get dressed and walk down to the great hall. It was a Sunday so she didn’t have classes. Thank goodness. She piled some eggs onto her plate and ate sleepily. There were only a few other students eating, since it was so early. There were two girls sitting at the Ravenclaw table. They looked to be first years and to be friends. There was one boy sitting alone at the Hufflepuff table. He looked older. Probably fifth or sixth. She surveyed the Slytherin table and to her surprise she saw Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t eating, just sitting there, looking anxious. She felt a but of pity before remembering all the times he had called her family blood traitors and she couldn’t forget how awful he was to Hermione. She quickly looked away. Ginny seemed to be the only one sitting at the Gryffindor table. Huh. Ginny sighed. She knew what she had to do. Confront Luna and apologize for the day before. Hopefully Luna wouldn’t be mad. That was the main concern. But the dream kept playing in her head. She could still head her mother’s voice.
The only good thing that came from the boy trying (but failing) to put his name in the goblet was that the rest of the students had found a newfound confidence, and a few more students entered.
“Oh um… i don’t know why. Anyway, why did you want to see me in person?” the secret admirer asked, changing the subject.
She hoped the week would go by quickly and that she wouldn’t be assigned too much homework.
Alas, we are both destined to spend Valentine’s Day alone and single. It is the saddest of fates, something I never dreamed of, something that would bring shame to my family, something that-
The next day during Potion’s Harry was late again. When he arrived Professor Whitlock gave him a detention and he sat down.
Ginny hurried to the greenhouse, where Professor Sprout was getting ready to teach them about a pink plant with pink pods held in the leaves.
“Yes, it’s beautiful, thank you. Let me just secure it with a hair tie.” Luna got up and wrapped her hair in a small rubber band she grabbed from her drawer. “This looks great. What spell did you use?” Luna asked.
Ginny waited there, in the owlery, for a long time. She didn’t know what she was waiting for exactly, it just felt nice to be there, surrounded by things that wouldn’t, and couldn’t judge you.
Chapter One
“Good,” he replied, clearly grateful. “Now let’s play some quidditch.” Ginny accioed her broom and they started flying. It was fun, she felt free. Harry pulled out a snitch and let it loose. They spent hours trying to find it. Harry won when he grabbed the snitch and nearly fell off his broom.
The entire great hall burst into loud laughter. Unlike the others who had been laughed at, Fred and George didn’t seem embarrassed at all. Instead they joined in the laughter until Professor McGonagall grabbed them by the shoulder and dragged them away, muttering about “such hooligans!” and whatnot.
There was just one more thing that Ginny had to do, and that was talk to Harry.
“Ginny?” Professor Sprout asked.
I panic. I don’t know what to say. So I say something quite stupid.
Theme: there isn’t one, but dress nicely. Dress as though you are going to the Yule Ball.
Ugh, just ignore my awful rhymes
“Bi?” Ginny had only ever heard of gay and lesbian. She’d never even heard of bi before.
Well, shoot.
Ginny and Luna hung out in the forest for a couple hours before heading back to hogwarts. They mostly walked in silence, until they got to the great hall.
All day long she was antsy. She could hardly pay attention to her classes. More than once she was told to pay attention by her teachers. It was utterly exhausting.
Setting: the astronomy tower.
“Are you sure?” Asked Luna hesitantly.
She was sorry. But also a bit proud she managed to hex her older brother.
The doors to the Great Hall swung open and rows upon rows of teenage students come walking in. They were all wearing blue uniforms and looked very graceful and intelligent. There was one girl specifically, that Ginny couldn’t take her eyes off. She was tall and blond and had the most marvelous blue eyes. Ginny felt as though she could stare at her forever. Suddenly one of the students at the table started talking.
Ginny sat down in her seat. When the chocolate trolley came along she politely refused. It wasn’t that she didn’t like candy, she just didn’t have any spare money to buy it with.
“Arania exumai,” and the rest of the spiders were gone. Ginny saw Dumbledore let out a small chuckle and then talk once more.
The girl looked at her happily. “That sounds great!” The blond slid into the seat next to her. Well, she didn’t really slide. Her movement was more like she was gliding or floating above the air. The girl reminded her of water spirt. Like the kind she had seen in books.
I take out my own laser thing but realize I have no idea how to work it. So that won’t work.
“I know. It’s just part of my charm.” Pansy leaves and I’m left all alone.
“What are you laughing at?” He demanded.
“Um, yeah, we played some quidditch before he rushed off. He told me he had to study with you in the library.”
“I wonder what the first task will be,” she whispered.
They had argued for weeks before her Dad had finally stepped in and convinced her mum to allow her to go. Her mum hadn’t let her play Quidditch that year but Ginny figured it was better to just be happy she could return to Hogwarts.
She looked at her mum’s face and saw confusion mixed with slight annoyance. Oh no.
“I know you are all upset over the lack of quidditch this year but I believe this is for the best. Students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons may leave, your headmasters will explain the rest. As for my students, you may go back to your dorms.” Ginny linked hands with Luna and they walked out of the Great Hall.
I edited this chapter a lot before posting and I’m still not totally confident in it. Tell me what you think!
“Yeah, when we first hung out at the library I thought the same thing.” Luna looked relieved.
To Ginny’s delight, breakfast was, in fact, still happening. She loaded her plate with eggs and sausages and sat down. Pretty soon her owl came swooping in and dropped a letter, along with the Daily Prophet, onto her lap. The letter was from her mum.
“As many of you have probably noticed, there is a potion at the front of the room. You’ve also probably experienced some sort of odd smell coming from the potion. I don’t know what it smells like to you, but it’s probably something that you love. The potion at the front of the room is Amortentia, the most powerful love potion in the wizarding world.”
“So why’d you want to talk?”
“Easy, an envelope,” Luna answered as they ducked through the painting. “The painting will only ask a Ravenclaw the riddle. Answer it correctly or with a good answer and it will open,” she explained. Ginny nodded. Her eyes opened wide as she looked at the Ravenclaw common room. It had grey walls and blue curtains draping the three large windows. There was a table in the middle with an unfinished puzzle. There was a dark blue rug laying under the table. There were a few couches scattered about and also some rather large pillows. It had a very blissful and mysterious vibe, not at all what Ginny had expected it to be like.
She felt as though she had been friends with her for years, instead of hours.
“Dinner!” Called her mum.
It was an odd combination, but one that worked nonetheless.

Chapter eight
“It’s ok. I figured as much. May I ask who it is? I won’t tell anyone or make fun of you, I’m just curious.”
He was right about that, Ginny had never heard of this ‘Triwizard Tournament’.
“Of course,” Luna replied.
She immediately regretted saying it. A million scenarios started playing through her mind. Almost all of them being bad. But what her secret admirer did next was surprising.
“No. You're straight. You’re  Harry bloody Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World. You’re the Boy Who Lived.”
Chapter three
(See the end of the chapter for
Help.
“Well, kind of. I think we should help each other create these really cool Valentine’s Day ask-outs. But first we have to tell each other who we are each crushing on.”
“I’m glad she won,” said Luna. “Are you? There’s a whole group of girls who keep making fun of her behind her back, just because she’s pretty.”
Potter raised his eyebrows at me.
“I’m just sending a letter to my mum. Normally she checks in with me after the first week of school and I just decided to send a return letter so she doesn’t, you know, worry about me or anything. Or worry about my brothers or-“
“Take action? Do you mean ask out our crushes? Cause that’s never happening.”
Just then, Harry barged into the classroom.
“Did you see her?”
Throughout the week, classes were all but cancelled, as almost nobody could focus, and almost all the teachers gave up on teaching class. Even Professor McGonagall didn’t hold proper classes, and instead assigned everybody a short essay at the start of the week, and let students work on it as classwork.
It was... a love poem? And unsigned? It must be a prank. Probably Fred and George wanting to get a good laugh. But... it’s too pretty to be the work of Fred and George. Sure, the poem didn’t stick to a rhyming pattern and it certainly wasn’t perfect. But it was close to the heart. It was sweet. But then who could have sent it?
“Luna! You can’t steal from Honeydukes,” chastised Ginny.
Harry
“Harry Potter! Isn’t he too young?”
Gossiping voices filled the Great Hall. “Do you wanna get out of here?” asked Luna.
Dear Ginny,
“Y- you,” she weazed through laughter. She was laughing so hard tears were streaming down her face.
“That is correct! Five points to Hufflepuff. Does anyone know what the puffapod does?”
“Wow, do I get to ask you a bunch of questions now?”
Ok. I’ll be there. I’m going to wear a mask though, since I don’t want you to hate me. Just forget I ever sent the letters. It was stupid of me to do, anyway. Just forget them.
On the third day, more and more students entered. Nine Gryffindors, seven ravenclaws, four hufflepuffs, and two slytherins. Among those were twenty students from both Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Cedric Diggory entered that day. He was from Hufflepuff. Ginny remembered him since almost all the girls were fawning over him. He entered it confidently, but not in a cocky way. When his name dropped into the fire, over half the great hall erupted into a cheer.
I sigh. “Fine.”
“We have to go look for them!”
Chapter Twelve
Thestrals seem to be important to her, what if I’m being too personal? Will she get mad? Ugh, WHY AM I SO NERVOUS? Ginny screamed out her thoughts. Her stomach was doing that weird butterfly-fluttery thing again and her hands were cold and clammy. Thankfully Luna didn’t seem mad at all.
But all she got in response was a quick,
“Another one of the curses is the cruciatus curse. It… tortures… the person you cast it on.”
He shook his head a little bit, as though he was clearing his mind of pointless thoughts. However, his mind still seemed to be focusing on Harry.
By the end of the day, she was less worried and more excited. Many of her fears seemed silly in retrospect. Now she was just ready to get it over with. She also needed to get herself ready for the date.
Voices clambered on top of each other, cheering for the plays they loved and complaining about the other team. It was great. Suddenly her dad came running in.
A few girls laughed and one whispered, “Loony loony Lovegood.” This sent the kids sitting next to them into another burst of giggles.
“It’s a date.”
“Oh um, it was a spell I’d heard my roommates say before. I’m not really sure what it’s called but the incantation is crinus muto, i think.”
“That’s what we were doing Ginny. We were looking for you and the rest when we found you,” explained Percy. “You’re right though, we should get back to looking.”
So… I’m back! Surprise everyone! Guess who’s got the motivation to write? Me. Though it seems as soon as I have motivation to write I don’t have it to draw and vise verse… oh well. Anyway I’ve been on a sort of writing spree for the past few days, let’s hope it holds up. There’s like a 50/50 chance that I finish this fic, so… yeah.
“…what? What to you mean, you don’t know?
During that detention they’d decided upon a truce. Originally it had been just that, a truce. But once the two had stopped constantly arguing with each other they found that they enjoyed the other’s company.
“Let’s just move on,” Draco felt himself saying. “Today we’re brewing Amortentia.”
“Nice, congratulations on coming out. But what are your questions?”
Harry laughed. “This was fun, you know?”
Chapter eighteen
“Draco, are you writing ridiculously dramatic stories about your love life in your diary again?”
Chapter ten
Harry Potter walked the halls of Hogwarts. What was once his home, now felt like a painful memory. It was October, and therefore, almost Halloween. Every year, Professor Dumbledore had gone all out for halloween. Spiderwebs and enchanted ghosts would line the walls. Floating pumpkins and other spooky things would decorate the school. Harry used to love these things, but now they simply reminded him of the two things he hated most; death and war.
We walked over to a more secluded spot under a tree. Now I’m standing here awkwardly trying to figure out how I’m going to ask out my nemesis. I’m staring at my feet which Father says isn’t good manners but now feels like a time where I am allowed to forget about manners and—
“That’s not all though, there is also money that you will be rewarded if you win.” Dumbledore looked across the students.
(See the end of the chapter for
She smiled as Ginny handed some of the books back to her. How was she managing to stay so calm? She began to panic a bit on the inside.
Hey! I’ve finished the first 12 chapters for this fic, and there should be around 30 in all. I’ll be posting the first five today, and if they get some attention I’ll post the rest very soon. If not, I’ll be posting one chapter every day until I’ve caught up with what I’ve written so far. Reviews and kudos are suuuper appreciated! Especially reviews like “when are you updating!?” Or “update already!” Since those are super motivational. Eventually I’ll start updating weekly, but for now, enjoy!
“Do not!”
“Rumor has it the shack is haunted,” Luna said. “Do you think so?”
The Durmstrang students also came walking through the Great Hall. Ginny didn’t take much notice of the students. They were all wearing brown uniforms and marched in an order. However, many girls were gushing over one of the boys.
“If you don’t take action about your crush you will drive yourself mad liking them until they reject you or date you. And you wouldn’t want to spend anymore depressing Valentine’s Days with me would you?” Pansy continued.

“Okay. I’m also always here to talk. See you around.”
“No time for questions, we’ve got to go, right now!”
First, the pair went to Honeydukes. The shop was beautiful. There were rows upon rows of different sweets. There were normal ones, like Drooble’s Best Blowing Bubble Gum, and licorice sticks, but also weird ones like Cockroach Clusters and Fly Honey. Yuck. Who would eat those? Luna grabbed her hand once more and they ran through the store. Ginny tried not to blush from the warmth of Luna’s palm.
Will you ever respond?
—————————————————
“Okay, thank you for the congratulations. Congrats to you as well. As for my questions: number one: how long have you guys been friends. Number two: how long have you been dating? Number three: are you planning on telling your friends and my family? If so, when? Number four: is Malfoy going to tell his family and if so, when? Number five: how can you be sure that he can be trusted?”
“Before I forget to ask, what’s your name?”
()()()
“I’m glad you like it,” she said.
Professor Whitlock frowned.
Luckily Dumbledore started talking again, “Thank you Beauxbatons for that marvelous introduction. I trust that Madame Maxime has explained it to you?”
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe, getting outed to the whole school and my family, my crush finding out I like him, said crush’s friends finding out I like him, becoming the laughing stalk of Hogwarts, and everyone hating me much more than they already do. It just seems to me that maybe this could be a big deal?”

Your secret admirer.
“In this class I will prepare you for the world. The first things we will learn about are the Unforgivable curses, otherwise known as the Unforgivables. Now, the Ministry says you shouldn’t know about them but I disagree. Does anyone here know what the Unforgivables are?”
Dear Ginny,
“I know, they’re beautiful.”
I will be attending your exclusive party tomorrow night. If I do not show up, know that something made it impossible for me to come. I am looking forward to it.
Ginny walked slowly to her next class and worked on her Puffapod essay. She was in no hurry to get to History of Magic. She could probably skip class and Professor Binns wouldn’t notice. Sure, she would get in trouble with Professor McGonnagall but... no. She wanted to make friends this year, and losing the house points wouldn’t help.
Why? Why does it have to be me?
What do you do in a situation like this?
I haven’t gotten in any trouble. I don’t think that Ron or Harry has either. The quidditch tryout dates haven’t been announced yet but I will make sure to tell you when I find out! Your gift hasn’t came but I did receive a-
Draco looked up to see Harry blushing furiously.
--------
This isn't really a chapter and more of a scene. Sorry about how short it is! The next chapter will be longer, I promise.
“I’m not really sure,” Ginny responded. It was true, she wasn’t sure, as she had never been to Hogsmead before.
Love, Luna Lovegood.”
But I’m not really sure why
Her Hogwarts room felt more like home than her other room did anyway. She went down to eat some sort of breakfast. She wasn’t sure if breakfast was still an option at 10:30 but... she was starving.
Another person that everyone was expecting to enter was Viktor Crum. He was a professional quidditch player, and also a Durmstrang student. There was a large group of students- boys and girls alike- that followed Crum around like his own personal paparazzi. Ginny was also very intrigued by Crum, he was a successful quidditch player, and very good. And although he was a seeker, and Ginny’s dream was to be a chaser, she looked up to him in a strange way.
Ginny woke up late. Really late. It was already ten AM by the time she was awake! She had panicked for a moment but then remembered that it was Saturday and laid back down in the bed.
“Do too!”
Like how I love
“Ron and I are going to meet my parents and stay with them for a bit. Then we’re going to stay at the burrow.”
Kudos + reviews are appreciated! So are comments that say “when is another chapter?” Or “my grandma can write chapters faster than you so upload already” because they give me motivation
Who designed the dorm placements anyway? Slytherin is all the way in the dungeons. Gryffindor is all the way at the top of a tower.
“Well, we could go to Honeydukes Sweet Shop, which sells candies. Or we could go to Zonko’s.
Chapter Fourteen
The minister of magic soon came out from the winner’s tent.
Ginny’s day felt like a blur. She spent the entire class either daydreaming about Luna, doodling, or just outright not paying attention. She scarcely understood what her professor’s were going on about. All she knew was she had gotten an E on her Herbology essay, an O on her astronomy paper, and As for everything else. She wasn’t surprised. She knew she wasn’t an amazing student, not bad, but she was certainly no Hermione Granger. She went to her common room and had barely walked through the door before Seamus came bounding through the picture frame yelling,
The attacker tried to shoot Harry but Harry dodges the attack. Harry shoots but misses. Attacker tries to shoot again and misses, and almost hits me. Harry shoots the attacker but misses by quite a bit. While the attacker is distracted by Harry’s misfire, Harry shoots the attacker in the chest.
“Wonderful. Now, let us introduce Durmstrang!”
“I’ve got to get to classes now, we can talk later?” Asked Ginny.
“To some, Amortentia will smell like something you either love or reminds you of love. For instance, if your parents work as gardeners you may smell plants. For others it will smell like someone you love. Most of the time you won’t smell a simple crush, but you may smell the person you like if it’s a particularly strong crush. To be honest, I’m not sure exactly how it works. I’ve been rambling. Basically, it smells like something or someone you love. Today, you will be brewing Amortentia. You will have two days, today and tomorrow to brew this potion. Know that it is absolutely prohibited to pocket any of this potion and even more forbidden to use it on another student.”
Ginny gritted her teeth and sighed. This was the part she didn’t want to do.
Ginny sprinted down the Hogwarts halls. Her heart was racing, her head was pounding. A few times prefects told her to stop but she ignored them. Finally she had to stop running. She looked down and started panting. She realized she was gasping for air. Ginny clutch her side and tried to breathe. As soon as the pain stopped and she could breathe again, Ginny collapsed on the ground. She made sure the passage was isolated before she burst into tears.
Ginny wondered if she should try to send a letter to the secret admirer but then decided against it. The owl would probably get lost and then she would have no owl until she could find him.
Dumbledore continued, “Every 100 years, three schools are chosen to partake in this tournament. Each school will choose a student and those three students will compete in three magical trials. There is a point system to each trial. Whoever has the most points in the end will be winner of the Triwizard Tournament, which is a great honor. The prize is also quite grand.”
“Well… rumor has it you’ve been crushing on someone in Hufflepuff.”
“What?”
Ginny woke up and scurried off to her classes. She and Luna didn’t have any together since, she had found out, Luna was a fourth year.
“What?”
Hi! Very very sorry this chapter is late. I will be only posting on Mondays again because writing is hard. I don't know if I have it in me to update twice a week anymore. Anyway, hope you like this chapter, reviews are appreciated, and I'll post again on Monday!
I look at her dubiously.
“Oh… the love potion?”
“Hi Luna,” Ginny said hesitantly. She walked forwards and waved. She watched as Luna extended a hand. Ginny grabbed it, as if to shake hands but Luna thrust her towards the ground. Suddenly all the students were in the library watching them.
After the dinner she made her way to her dorm and collapsed in bed. She feel asleep thinking of Luna.
“Can I do yours? I’ve learned a few beauty spells though they aren’t as advanced as yours,” Ginny asked.
Her own room at home was very bland. There was a bed in the corner. Next to the bed was a dresser with some pictures. She had a few Quidditch posters hanging on her wallls but not much.
I’d give up everything to be the reason you smile
Chapter eleven
A great cry rang out across the great hall. Many students were grumbling- Ginny included. No Quidditch! What?! It was the only thing I was looking forward too... oh well.
After a couple hours her parents yelled up to her room that they were leaving to get Harry and Hermione. Ginny yelled back goodbye and waited for them to return. After about an hour she heard the door open and she stumbled down the stairs.
She was getting ready to head back to the common room after waiting for her secret admirer to come when she heard footsteps. She darted into a corner and prayed nobody say her.
Draco sat down at the table he was assigned too. He was seated right next to Harry.
“Yeah. Yeah, I do.”
“He has to fight a dragon?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny made her way to the Great Hall and her eyes immediately fell to Professor Dumbledore, who was standing at his podium in the front of the room. Her beckoned for them to all sit down and waited for a couple minutes before everyone had arrived.
“Um, I was wondering… if… you’d like to be my date? This is kind of extremely embarrassing but I’ve had a crush on you for a while and Pansy kind of forced me to tell you and,”
“But how?”
Ginny wished she could just fly away from her troubles. It must be so nice, to be an owl. At any moment, if things get to much for you or you just want to leave, you can fly away. It must be marvelous.
Ginny shot her a grateful smile.
“Actually, in order to make sure that doesn’t happen, Dumbledore will be putting a potion in our food that makes unwanted attraction to magical creatures go away. It’s a really complicated potion and most schools don’t do it but you know Dumbledore, he’s always got to go all out,” explained a different student.
“Coming!” A chorus of voices responded.
Halfway up the stairs, Ginny changed her mind and went to the owlery. She found some parchment and a quill and started to write her letter.
Then, Professor Moody cast, “Crucio!”
Valentine's Day is this Saturday. Oh well. Valentine’s Day has never been my favorite holiday. All it does is remind me that I have no partner and that the one person I’m in love with hates me. So that’s great.
Saying so would be a lie
“So Draco, I’ve been thinking.”
“Well, that would explain it. My hair is wonderful, thank you.”
Sincerely,
“Oh Potter, yes. A million times yes.”
“I do not sound like that!”
At lunch she worked on her Herbology essay. Then it was time for Care of Magical Creatures with Hagrid. She walked to his hut and pulled out her book. It was a nasty looking book. It was covered in matted fur and looked to have fangs clasping the side. She wondered how she was expected to open the darn thing. Hagrid was waiting by his hut for everyone to arrive.
“Erm… yes. I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t tell anyone though. We’d rather keep it a secret for as long as possible.” Harry glanced at Malfoy nervously.
“Well you were being controlled by” Mum had dropped her voice into a whisper “you know who’s diary.”
“Ok, thanks again Mum!”
“Yes, it was!” She said through tears.
“Come along Ginny, you need to be cured.”
Ginny’s heart sank. She would never get a yes when Mum was in a bad mood. But she had already started the conversation so she didn’t really have a choice but ask...
You have a sickness. It needs to be cured.
I miss you so much dear! I do hope that things at Hogwarts are going well. Have you gotten into any danger yet? I hope the answer is no. By the way, have you made any friends yet? If not, I’m sure that being on the quidditch team will help. When are tryouts? I’d like to know so I can owl you some sort of good luck present. I’ve got so many questions for you. Like, how are Ron and Harry? Are they staying out of trouble? Are you staying out trouble? I hope so. Be safe!
She crawled into her bed and pulled over the soft, breezy, blanket. It was enchanted to keep her cool in the summer and warm in the winter. All the blankets were.
Love,
“What? It’s true. She’s gonna have to find out sometime,” he said.
“And lastly, from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Cedric Diggory!” the Headmaster boomed. Ginny and Luna cheered with the rest of the school as smiling Cedric made his way to Professor Dumbledore. Goblet of Fire produced a fourth name. The Headmaster read it aloud,
“Of course. But aren’t you afraid of people knowing that we’re together?”
“I just wanted you to know that I’m not upset about what you said yesterday. If anything, I guess I’m happy.”
“Now that we have everyone here, I’d like to make an announcement. I’m sure some of you have heard of the Triwizard Tournament, but most of you have not.”
“Sure,” Ginny responded. Luna walked up to the counter and ordered the drinks. She came back holding two butterbeers.
Ginny shuddered as she thought about the cruel nicknames that could follow her coming out. From a wide range of slurs to made up nicknames, the teasing would be unbearable. She sighed and crawled out from under her bed.
“On the count of three we all touch the portkey, okay?” Said Dad.
Ginny had gotten closer with Harry though. They’d played a few quidditch practice games together during the past couple of weeks. She’d found out that Harry was pretty enjoyable to be around. The second time they’d hung out together she asked him why he lied.
“I know, but what do I do?”
Ginny smiled. She was glad her mum was supporting quidditch. She would have to find out when tryouts were soon so she could send an owl back to her mum. Suddenly another owl came swooping onto the table and dropped a letter in her lap.
Fleur Delacour, the part veela, also entered on the third day. Ginny felt the same veela pull she had felt days before when Fleur entered the room. When Fleur entered her name, the reaction was the opposite of Diggory’s. Almost all the boys started cheering and almost none of the girls did.
“Ok,” she whispered. She looked into Luna’s eyes. They were so beautiful. She looked at her face and tried to memorize every bit of it. She wanted luna’s face to be etched into her mind. First, her eyes. They were big and beautiful. Then, her lips. They were a light pink. They looked so soft. Her cheeks, they were light red. Ginny realized that Luna had been blushing and awkwardly took a few steps backward. She didn’t want to make Luna uncomfortable. Even if she had been the one to close the gap between them... She noticed that Luna was blushing an even deeper red.
Ginny let the words sink in. A crush on him? What? She’d had a fan crush on him during her first year and some of her second but she’d gotten over that ages ago. Suddenly the only thing she felt was appropriate to do was laugh. She did, for a while. Harry simply looked at her incredulously.
“Of course. I’ve got tons at home.” Ginny didn’t have tons at home but she liked seeing her jacket on Luna. She also didn’t get cold easily. After more arguing, they parted ways and Ginny went back to her dorm. She walked to her room smiling dreamily.
“T-that was hilarious!” Ginny wheezed. Luna nodded.
Pansy sighs again, though this time it’s a bit less of a depressed sigh and more of a ‘I’m so done with this’ sigh.
Harry came over to the table he and Draco shared.
“So you know how Valentine's Day is coming up, right?”
“So… I guess… Do you want to be my boyfriend?” Harry asked.
Luna thrust her lips onto Ginny’s and they kissed. It was awkward and weird and neither of them knew how to kiss, but it felt right. It just did. Ginny pulled away first.
“Harry Potter,” he said. “Harry Potter please come here now.” His voice was stern and worried. Ginny saw Harry walk quickly to the Headmaster. They walked off, leaving the rest of the student body to whisper and gossip.
“Oh guess what?” Luna asked. She looked exited and as if she had just remembered something happy.
“Now now, calm down. Finite incantem,” cast a prefect.
Pansy pauses.
“I just wanted to tell you that there is someone else I like. I’m sorry. I just figured you’d want to know. I also think the letters you sent were beautiful, but I just can’t return the feelings,” Ginny tried to let the secret admirer down gently. She didn’t know if it had worked though.
“Yeah… will you… be my date?”
“Erm, now that you’re here, what would y-you like to work on? We could do charms, or- or potions. Although I suck at potions. Maybe we could study, um transfiguration. Or um, maybe care of magical creatures?” Ginny sighed internally.
After the First Task was over there was a small party in the Common Room. Harry opened the egg and it let out a blood curdling shriek. Needless to say Harry did not open it up again after that. Ron and Harry seemed to make up during the party, so everything seemed to be going well.
All alone with my messed up hair.
“Aguamenti.” The jar the spider had once been in was now filled with water. “Perhaps we should let the spider go back to its home. Imperio.”
In charms they learned the cheering charm. They weren’t allowed to practice it in class though. Charms homework was to write a page on how the cheering charm was invented.
Luna blushed.
“Yeah I think it is!”
I wrote this poem
Say all the things I want say
“I wasn’t abducted!”
“It’s gonna be amazing Harry. Just Bloody Brilliant!” Ron said excitedly.

The rest of the night went well. They ate and talked and laughed. It was the perfect evening. Once Ginny was back in her dorm, all of her worries felt ridiculous. She told herself she wouldn’t worry about those things anymore, they weren’t practical fears. But she knew that the next time something like this happened, she would worry. It was exhausting sometimes.
“Everyone, make yourself at home,” Mum said.
She just wanted the fluttery feeling in her stomach to disappear. She wished with all her heart she could just be... normal. No Tom Riddle or the diary. No fluttery feelings or unwanted attraction. She couldn’t be... gay.
“Where are you going?” Neville asked.
Two: she wasn’t straight, but she also wasn’t... gay. She didn’t think she was ready for a specific label yet but one couldn’t like girls and also be straight now, could they?
Ginny decided to drop it. Hopefully he’d tell her eventually. She wasn’t going to press for more details. Besides, she was busy with her own business. She had decided to tell Harry about her relationship with Luna.
The room seemed to reek of him. It smelled like the quidditch pitch and broom polish. But it was mixed with a familiar… Harry-like scent. This was fairly odd, especially considering Harry wasn’t even in the same room as him.
So I could
Draco looked over to see Harry blushing even more.
“Sounds good to me,” agreed Luna. She held out her hand to Ginny. For a brief moment, she had flashback of her dream, Luna holding on her hand, saying she was sick.
You can imagine my panic when I saw somebody get shot.
She walked back to her dorm and sat down in the common room. She saw her brother and his friends all huddled up on a couch. They were saying something to Harry and he kept arguing that he was fine. She sighed. She wished she could have a friendship like that. Someone who cared about her, and asked her how she was doing. Someone to meet up with after classes and someone she could pass notes. But, she didn’t.
Viktor Crum finally entered his name on the fifth, and decidedly last, day. He walked soberly up to the goblet, barely clutching his paper, as though he almost wanted it to fall. He didn’t look at the audience, nor did he look happy. He looked as though he would like to be anywhere than where he was now. He dropped his paper in gingerly, ignoring the loud cheers from the audience behind him. Ginny cheered as well, as she looked up to Crum. He walked out of the Great hall afterwards, and acted as though nothing had happened.
Draco felt his cheeks heat up.
“Fashionably late,” he said when I pointed it out. I don’t know about that but he sure was in fashion. His outfit hugged his body perfectly, and he looked great. “So Potter, what did you call me here for? What problem do you need me to solve this time?”
Nobody raised their hand. A few people looked frightened. Ginny did know what they were, since she’d overheard her father talk about them a few times. She also knew that they were very, very, dangerous and not something to joke about.
Ginny walked out of class, now with her first assignment of the year. She had to write an essay on the properties of a puffapod. Great, she thought sarcastically.
She felt bad for lying but Luna could never know the truth. She also felt a little bit proud of coming up with the lie. This could guarantee that Luna wouldn’t get so close anymore and it would be easier to hide her crush.
“Erm, yeah, sorry,” Ginny said with a nervous laugh.
“Wait- don’t leave. If you are Luna, then… then know… that- that I… um,” Ginny started to say.
She attached the parchment to the owl and sent it off. A while later she got a reply.
Neither of the two spoke for a couple seconds. The silence was extremely awkward.
When Ginny woke up, she was surprised to realize she felt well rested. There had been absolutely no nightmares the night before and she felt sort of peaceful. She quickly realized that she had to get to her classes, so got ready and sprinted down to the breakfast hall. Once again she cursed the founders for building the Gryffindor room so far away from everything! By the time she got to the great hall, students were already scrambling about, trying to get to classes. She sighed, grabbed a piece of toast, and ran off to her first class.
It was almost like the founders knew there would be a Slytherin/Gryffindor rivalry so they made sure the dorm rooms were as far away as possible.
Most were chattering excitedly, some were already declaring how they would win.
“No! Also, her name is Ginny and we broke up at the beginning of the school year. We didn’t tell people though, since we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.”
I glare at him.
Ginny felt a moment of clarity where not everything but many things did make sense.
Chapter nine
He’s won!
The girl looked around the train. “I would sit with you but I should try to sell, the rest of these quibblers,” she said with a sigh. God, even her sighs seem graceful, Ginny swooned.
Your pretty smile
“Well you like him back don’t you?”
Dear mum,
“Yes.” A figure came into view. The person was wearing a large lion’s  head on their face. “I came in costume, I don’t want you to know who I am.”
