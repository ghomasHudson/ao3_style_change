Harry buried himself in work, spending longer hours at the office every week. The first time Kingsley caught him sleeping at his desk, he scolded him, the second time he threatened him with a disciplinary hearing. This one he said wouldn’t be a farce like the last one when the article about Draco had been in the Prophet.. The third time Kingsley suspended him, threatening to fire him if he so much as showed his face at the ministry within the next four weeks.
The lengthening shadows were shrouding the rose Harry had given him in darkness. The petals were now the colour of blood, twisting the symbol of hope and love into something darker, something dangerous. It loomed there over his bed, the long fingers of the shadow it was casting creeping towards him threateningly across the bedding.
“But…?” Draco prompted. Harry appeared to feel like he’d already said too much and quickly changed the subject.
He shivered as he recollected their encounter in his office. Harry had been so full of need that he couldn’t concentrate on his work, and when Ron had said he’d go out to lunch to meet Hermione it had taken him all of five minutes to come to a decision and send his note. He’d half expected Draco to resist but instead he had taken charge for the first time, letting Harry forget the dynamics of their relationship and for once being able to pretend he wasn’t doing something wrong. If he had asked him then, Harry would have let Draco fuck him. Right there, bent over his own desk like some wanton whore.
“I was just wondering…” he gasped as Harry nibbled at his earlobe, “because I was thinking of taking a flat in London, Wiltshire is too far away.”
Draco felt himself drawn to the writing desk. He made his way towards it, taking care not to step on any of the discarded paper. A single sheet of paper and a quill lay abandoned on the small desk. Only hesitating for a moment, Draco reached out and took the paper. It was a letter, addressed to him. Taking into account the untidy scrawl and the many scratched out words, it had been written by Harry. Feeling slightly guilty, Draco began to read.
Potter’s eyes blazed with a fury Draco hadn’t expected. Taunting Potter had always been a game to him. If he hadn’t known better, he would have thought that Potter was ready to kill him.
He can’t take it any more. None of it. The terror that comes at night, the jibes that he pretends don’t hurt and most of all, the one person he craves to be with but can never have. Defeated Draco sinks to the floor by the window, pressing his cheek to the cold glass, feeling just as lifeless. If only he could stop feeling this way, could stop being this pathetic empty shell of human being, driven by a craving that can never be sated. If only Draco could stop yearning for what he can’t have. His mind comprehends the facts and tries to make it easier for him to move on, but his traitorous little heart betrays him at every turn.
The noise repeated itself. Cursing, Draco let the owl flutter inside that had been jumping up and down on the windowsill outside. He carefully detached the letter it was carrying from its leg and gave it an owl treat for not injuring his hand further. The handwriting on the envelope didn’t look familiar. Draco cast a magical signature detection spell and was less than pleased with the result; Harry Potter was the author of the letter.
“I’m so sorry, Draco. I think the diary was the means the siren used to draw you in, in the first place. When I asked you about the diary earlier you couldn’t answer me, I think you’re still under its thrall.”
“Yes, I think so, at least to one of them.” Harry took a deep breath before continuing, “I want to know why,” he swallowed before going on, “I want to know why I don’t remember anything.”
“Pretty much, I guess. We haven’t really talked about it, but when Ginny gets back from training camp she’ll move in with me.” To Draco’s ears it sounded like Harry wasn’t convinced this was a good thing, so he felt compelled to follow up by stating the obvious.
fly closer again and Draco can feel Harry’s finger brushing across his arsehole. Nothing can be as bad as this, as being trapped in this false reality with a Harry that seems to have no problems with consent issues. Draco has no choice but to put himself at the small man’s mercy.
“I’ll pick you up at eight at your place tomorrow night then, if that meets with your approval?” Harry said, neither of them able to entirely tear themselves away.
“Will you shut up,” Potter interrupted him. Draco found he was too gobsmacked to be able to offer a witty reply. “Shit, I think they followed me.”
“Take it and get out, get out now before I forget myself!” He almost shouted, forcing the by now slightly crumpled scroll into Potter’s hand. Carefully levitating the fallen scrolls back onto their shelves he ignored the pleading look on Potter’s face and when he was done he stalked off into the dark.
“I’m sorry Mr Potter, as much as I would like to continue this, I have other obligations at this point.”
For the first time since he could remember, Draco stumbled and almost fell as he exited the floo, barely catching himself in time. He’d known Harry and Ginevra were an item who in the wizarding world hadn’t? But to see it so plainly in front of him shouldn’t have been such a surprise, nor should it have hurt as much as it did. Despite the evidence to the contrary, Draco had assumed that he was as much the centre of Potter’s world as Potter was of his.
Harry’s skin was covered in cold sweat and the sheets clung to it. Every time he turned over they didn’t slide but stick to him, entangling his limbs, like his fears had suddenly crawled into his bed and decided to become overly handsy.
Hermione describes how everyone had watched but nobody had done anything and how some people even smiled as if they enjoyed what happened.
Sophia didn’t seem too pleased when Harry called for her. She had been out hunting and delivering a letter was probably the last thing she wanted to do. The letter Harry was sending had been written months ago, when he had first started to doubt whether the Auror corps was the right place for him. All that was left to do was for him to date and sign it and that was but the work of a moment.
When she heard his name, Ginevra spun around and shot an angry glare at Draco, as if he didn’t deserve to be there. He supposed he didn’t really. When she noticed his attire, the sneer on her face became disdainful. Draco would have given every Knut in his impounded vault to be anywhere else.
“Potter, Harry, would you continue reading to me please?” He said, hoping Harry understood it as the peace offering it was.
Pansy deposited him on a stretcher and then just stood there, silently staring down at him. After what felt like an eternity, she lifted one of her perfectly manicured fingernails that – as close as they were to Draco’s face – had something claw-like about them and pointed at Draco’s headdress.
He is not alone on these stairs. There are humanoid shapes walking down and past him, Draco is the only one heading up. These shapes seem like the outlines of human beings, they have no features to identify them, but their general shape is male. Draco looks at them as they pass him and decides the look a little bit like him. Each shape looks as if it has been cut into this reality through a stencil. The stars and nebulae that swirl in them make them seem like gateways to another universe.
“That’s not what we’re talking about here, Harry. It takes more than just liking people who are a bit loony. You only kept me around, because you felt pity for me and because you thought I needed protection. Maybe I did, but that doesn’t mean that other people don’t need your consideration and protection also.”
“Oh, that’s cheating. The great Harry Potter has to resolve to blackmail and sleights of hand to get someone of distinction to take his arm. Maybe you should have stayed with the Aurors instead of going into curse-breaking, oh mighty hero,” Draco said, laughter bubbling just below the surface.
One of the reasons he found this place so attractive was that the chance of wizards showing up and haunting him here were close to nil, because the effort it took to fly all the way up here had been immense, even for him.
Trying not show how nervous he was, Draco sped up his steps and hurried home now and again casting furtive glances over his shoulder trying to make out whether the stranger was following.
Draco had ordered the house elves to take care of the rose garden he had planted, because nothing in the world would make him enter it again. The one time he had tried, such intense emotions and memories had flooded his mind as he smelt the roses and lavender, that he had fallen to pieces. He had fled inside, locking himself in his room and drawing the curtains to shut out light and scent, vowing to never set foot into the garden again.
“Oh Draco, what happened? I’m sorry I stayed away for a whole month. Blaise and Millie were supposed to look in on you.”
“Yes, and don’t think I’m not aware that I still haven’t heard a single word of apology from you about what you said to Draco.”
Harry’s hand had landed on Draco’s while he spoke, they became aware of it at the same time and Harry pulled it away as if he had been burnt.
Outside the wind picked up, causing the curtains to thrash around. Draco could hear the first splatter of raindrops against the wide open windows as he hid his face in his hands, ashamed of having broken his promise to Harry. A few years ago he’d never have thought he’d be even more lost without him.
“You are telling me that you are striking out against the Dark Lord AND Albus Dumbledore at the same time while raising the Boy-Who-Lived as your son? That's... positively Slytherin.” All three of the adults laughed at the house joke, then Severus finished his drink and stood.
“I… went to school with Mr. Lupin when we were children. We didn’t get along. It’s hard to change opinions about someone when you have had them for a long time.
“There is a compulsion spell on it. You WILL write in it if you touch it. Thus the spelled gloves. And it's spelled so that you will share all your secrets.” Severus blinked, grateful for his friend's quick thinking and diligence. The information regarding Horcruxes was swirling around his head, and he came to a sudden realization that left him cold to his very soul.
Slowly, Harry picked up the books and colored pencils, and moved over to the couch. He climbed up and opened the first book. He recognized some of the words, but there were a lot that he couldn't even sound out. But the pictures, they were vivid and beautiful. Still chewing on his lower lip, Harry took a black colored pencil out of the box and opened the journal to the first blank page.
Severus went over to the Floo and called to the Malfoy’s. Stepping through, he was very quickly presented with his glowing son.
“I know Narcissa told you about Merlin, and Arthur, and how Arthur was taken to Avalon and would return when his kingdom needed him most.” Harry watched Severus intently. Severus sighed. He knew that he was putting a heavy load on his son, but he also knew that he would be there to help.
“But… my aunt and uncle and cousin were family too, and they never wanted me…” Harry whispered quietly. “And… they did bad things.” Narcissa blinked back the tears that welled in her eyes at how small and scared Harry felt.
“Severus. Lucius.” Both men turned to see Remus walk out of the ballroom. “Narcissa sent a Patronus, said that you needed help tracking Harry.” Severus felt hope fill him, and at that same time resentment for needed Remus for anything.
Albus had his harmless old man face on when Severus came to the office after the dinner hour, which immediately put Severus on guard. Albus always did that when he told Severus something that was going to make him mad.
“Yeah. Too bad. Want me to call the Aurors?” Lucius looked at Remus in surprise. Remus had an inscrutable look on his face.
Blaise had traveled over the world with his mother and her assorted husbands. According to Blaise, she got married all the time. None of her husbands were interested in getting to know Blaise, so Blaise wasn't interested in getting to know them. He was more interested in people's secrets. Blaise always wanted to be in the center of knowledge, and he had a nose for secrets. He started to ask Harry questions, but Draco distracted him every time he started to ask something by asking about one of Blaise's stepfathers.
“Father said that you followed the bad man who killed my mom and dad, but that you stopped because you wanted to protect my family. Cousin Narcissa said that we are family. Does that mean that you will protect me too?” Narcissa looked incredibly sad, and Lucius could see tears glimmering in her eyes. Lucius looked uncomfortable and shamefaced, but he nodded.
As soon as the classroom was clear, Severus made his way back to his chambers. He quietly opened the door, and was surprised to see that Harry was asleep on the couch. The book that he had given to Harry with animals from around the world was open on the couch next to him, and the journal was next to his head. Severus sighed, and smiled. He was happy to see that Harry was relaxed enough to be able to fall asleep so easily.
In addition, I wish to say that I haven't seen/paid much attention to the Newt Scamander movies or stories. So if there are some differences within my mythology, I hope you don't mind.
Severus explains everything to Lucius and Narcissa, and makes the tough choice to loop in their new ally.
“I've never seen them do that before! They don't usually react to people at all! That's so cool!” Harry smiled shyly.
Shortly after they sat down, Lucius came into the room and sat at the head of the table. Draco had continued to chatter at an animatedly listening Harry, who was nodding and adding little comments with a gleam in his eyes. When Lucius sat down at the table, Harry began to draw into himself. Plates of food appeared in front of them, and the Malfoys began to eat. Narcissa noticed that Harry waited until they had started before he started eating himself. After a few minutes of them eating, Lucius spoke.
“Harry, do you think that we could try a little right now?” Harry set his fork down and nodded, excited. He loved magic. Severus held his hand up, palm up, and Harry's fork raised a couple of inches off the table.
“Absolutely.” Severus placed his hand on Harry's shoulder so that Harry could continue to stroke his new toy, and realized that Harry wouldn't pick out other toys for himself. He thought that they were only getting the one. He realized that he would get the chance to get all the things that he had wanted as a kid at one point in time, and began to head towards the books to start. He wanted to get books that Harry could read on his own, but also books that they could read together.
“She says that she is ready to come out and meet us!” Harry pulled the basket a little closer to himself, which pulled it enough away from the chair that both Severus and Remus could watch. There was another noise, and a crack appeared at the top of the egg. Moments later, a large piece of shell was pushed up from the inside of the egg, and Remus and Severus watched in awe as a tiny feathered serpent, slightly glowing, poked it’s head out of the hole.
“Severus, would you be so kind as to explain what in Salazar's name is going on?” Severus wiped tears of mirth from his eyes and sighed, catching his breath.
“A little, but not too bad.” Severus inhaled carefully, and made sure that he locked his temper away. Harry was so hypersensitive, and he didn’t want Harry to think that he was angry at anything that he did. He remembered when he had been a young man, and any impression that someone was angry or upset made him believe that the emotions were directed at him.
“She says it’s much colder out here than it was in her shell, and wants to know if she can wrap around me for warmth. She also asked if I was her Master.” Harry looked up at his father. “I didn’t know what to tell her, so I said that I needed to ask you. That was why I brought her here.” Severus nodded. Severus turned to Remus. He needed to get him out of here before Harry and he discussed anything further.
Severus went back to the couch where Harry was surrounded by all of his new things. He kept reaching out and touching things, as if he couldn't believe that they were there and his.
“That explains… the pack bond.” Lupin said quietly. Severus rolled his eyes. Of course, he thought. That explained why Lupin was so adamant that he spend more time around Harry. He can’t help it. Severus sighed then glared at Remus.
“Keep a civil tongue in your head, Rowle, or you will lose it. That's my son.” Severus said quietly. He had learned long ago that if he spoke quietly, it made people listen harder and for some reason made them much more afraid of him.
“Shadow, I am well aware of how smart you are and therefore that you understand everything that I am saying to you. You are here as a companion to my son, Harry. He's not been well taken care of, much like yourself. That room...” and he turned and pointed to the door of his lab. “That is my lab. I frequently work in there with things that will doubtlessly make you very ill and possibly kill you, so I would stay away from that room. You are more than welcome to wander the grounds, but please look out for Harry. That's the most important thing.”
“Harry, my name is Madam Pomfrey, and this is Professor Severus Snape. We have been very worried about you. How are you feeling?” The woman in the grey dress sounded very nice, like some of his teachers from primary school, and he was hoping that maybe his prayers and wishes had been answered. When he was first supposed to start school, his aunt and uncle hadn't wanted to let him go. But Dudley's teacher had heard him talking about his cousin and had sent round a truancy officer to let the Dursley's know that all children had to go to school. So Harry got hours away from the Dursley's, and was happy to go to school. Maybe that was what had happened again.
“Looks like someone needs a baaath.” Severus said. Harry giggled, and Severus stood up, still holding Harry in his arms. “We will be back.”
“If you gentlemen can reign it in for a moment, I think I found what we all have been looking for.” Narcissa placed the book on Lucius’s desk and opened it to the page with the prophecy. All of the men came to look as she stepped back.
“Oh, Morgana, what happened to you, little one?” Madam Pomfrey had dealt with child abuse before, as the mediwitch for such a large institution, but it broke her heart every time. She ran her wand over the child and began to diagnose the injuries to Minerva and Severus. “Orbital fracture, left side. Multiple broken ribs, broken left arm. One of the ribs has punctured his spleen… Oh, I want to strangle the person that did this!” Poppy's eyes welled up with tears at the amount of pain that the little boy had to be in. Then her eyes hardened and she turned to Severus and Minerva. "You are dealing with this, yes?" It was so rare for the gentle mediwitch to lose her temper, so seeing her ferocity just meant that Severus had another ally in his pocket.
“Listen to me, wolf. I understand that you have a pack bond with my son, and that you were friends with his parents. I will let you spend more time around him than just lessons after the New Year. But you WILL be taking Wolfsbane potion every month, and stay in a place that I deem safe away from Harry on the nights of the full moon. And if I get so much as an inkling that you might be in danger of infecting him…” Remus interrupted him.
“Remus, I have some important brewing tasks, and I was hoping that Harry could stay with you for a couple of hours before our Christmas Eve dinner.” Remus could have sworn that Severus was fidgeting. “Perhaps you could illuminate him about some of the more interesting features of his new friend.” Remus smiled gently, not wanting to show his elation at being able to spend time around Harry.
“It’s okay now. You are safe, so it’s all okay. Next time you feel like you have to do something, wake me. I won’t stop you if you feel that it is important, and will make sure that you are safe on your adventures.” Harry nodded against his father’s chest. Remus felt like he was intruding on a private family moment.
“Minerva, please calm down. I am sure that it wasn’t that bad. Corporal punishment is, while not our way, very common in the Muggle world…” Albus didn’t get the chance to finish what he was saying before Severus interrupted him harshly.
“Well, Harry, you are welcome to choose. You can call me Dad, or Father, or if you are uncomfortable with either of those things, you may call me Severus.” Harry had relaxed a little bit more, and leaned his head against Severus's shoulder. He thought about it for a moment. He didn't want to call Severus by his name, because Severus was his father now. Calling him Dad seemed... irreverent, somehow. Severus, from what he had seen, seemed to be the kind of person who liked formal things, kind of like Aunt Petunia when company was coming over.
“How about we go home for dinner, and you can tell me more?: Harry nodded, and turned and give Draco a hug, much to the surprise of everyone in the room.
He was still trying to process what he saw. He knew, intellectually, that Severus had told him about Harry. The Promised King, the parseltongue, the wand less magic. But seeing Harry standing there, power emanating from him in waves, with the shadow of a crown hovering over his head and a grown man’s voice coming from him… That was way more than Severus had told him. He’s gotten the impression, although they had not shown it, that Severus and Lucius were surprised as well.
Rowle made his way down the terrace steps and into the gardens that surrounded Malfoy Manor, keeping a tight grip on the little boy that was his ticket to power and respect. He could hear the start of the chaos he had left behind him, and one of the other brats crying out for Harry. He ducked into the garden, letting the hedge hide him and the squirming child from the manor. He leaned down and whispered next to the boy’s head.
“Thank you love.” She whispered against his skin. She knew that he had given her space to work through her temper at it's worst, and kept everyone else distracted. She also knew that he had seen the cold glint in her eyes. She and Lucius may have turned over a new cheek when it came to the struggle between Harry and the Dark Lord, but nothing was going to stop Narcissa from enacting retribution on the Muggles that dared put a finger on her family.
The morning after Severus visited Malfoy Manor was exciting and frustrating for the Malfoy family. Lucius and Narcissa had told Draco during breakfast that his godfather had adopted a son, and that from then on the young man would be considered family. Draco's immediate reaction was to throw both an impressive temper tantrum and all his breakfast dishes that he would not be the center of attention for his godfather any longer. Draco had been banished to his room, and Lucius had retreated to his study. Narcissa went to her lounge to start putting together a lesson plan to teach Harry about the Wizarding World, and for Severus to learn about raising a young man.
Narcissa lifted the edge of her skirt and inspected the tear. She sighed, knowing that the elves would be able to repair it as if it had never happened, but she would know. Lucius swirled his Firewhiskey in his glass, thinking about the possible repercussions of his friend's actions.
Severus and Harry made their way out of the bustling castle and to the front gates. Once they were outside the gates, Severus looked down at Harry.
“Harry?” Harry looked back towards his father, awed. He was going to get one of THESE toys? “Is there something in particular that appeals to you?” Harry looked around the store for a moment, unsure of where to start when he noticed a table next to the one with animal figurines on it. This one held tiny dragons, about the size of his hand. Harry moved towards the table in fascination. He had never seen dragons before.
“You don’t like Remus, but you want me to spend time with him?” Harry asked. Severus sighed. Harry being so intuitive about people’s emotions was sometimes hard to explain.
“Well, as the Headmaster neglected to follow up with him prior to the end of October, I am unsure of the more distant past. But they almost killed him just prior to my arrival. If you want the gory details, ask Madam Pomfrey.” Severus swept his robe around him and walked around Remus, making his way quickly down the hallway until he heard his voice called quietly.
Narcissa went straight to the library. Something about the way that they had described Harry, with the crown, and the words, was tickling her memory. Narcissa loved reading, and had always been fascinated by the origin of magic. She went through the history books, looking for the one that had the prophecy about Arthur returning. She finally found what she was looking for, and as she pulled it out she realized that it wasn’t a published book. It had been a journal, written by Helena Ravenclaw, telling about the origin of magic. The passage that Narcissa was looking for was close to the back of the journal.
“And I think that I should bring Remus up to speed. With everything. Having a Griffyndor in my corner will make dealing with Albus easier. Especially when given all the details, Remus will be firmly in Harry’s corner.” Severus didn’t want to share Harry with the werewolf, didn’t want him anywhere near Harry, but he had studied them extensively after his brush with a death as a teenager and knew that Remus’s pack mentality would be another layer of protection on Harry.
“This place, it’s very special. It’s very special to everyone, because everyone thinks of the Founders of this school as very important people. But it’s extra special to you. Why don’t you show me how to open the door, and I will tell you more inside.” Harry nodded again, and then put his hand on the image of the crown hovering over Avalon, confirming Severus’s suspicions. Harry was the Promised King.
“Harry, I am going to use my wand to scan you. You won't feel anything, but it will tell me if anything else needs to be healed. Are you okay with this? I am going to do something similar when I scan your eyes.” Because of his experiences, Poppy wanted Harry to feel a little more control about what was going on. Harry nodded at her, and Poppy waved her wand and cast the diagnostic charms. Harry giggled.
“There once was a unicorn who lived in a m-mighty forest...” Harry only stumbled over his words once, and Narcissa was unable to determine if this was due to ability or nerves. Once Harry had completed his reading, Narcissa had him write out the page. Since Harry wasn't used to quills and ink, Narcissa showed him how to load the ink onto the quill. His handwriting was fairly messy, but she knew that would improve over time. Once Harry was done with the writing, Narcissa started asking Harry some easy math problems.
Dinner, as always at the Malfoy household, was lovely and delicious. Once dessert had been finished, the boys went to play in Draco’s room while Narcissa maneuvered them into pajamas and getting relaxed. She finally gave up, and informed the boys that it was okay for them to stay up but that they weren’t allowed to leave Draco’s rooms. She left the giggling boys and went back down to where Lucius and Severus were enjoying a scotch together in Lucius’s study.
Severus was so lost in his thoughts that he almost ran into Remus Lupin, who appeared to be heading down the hall to the Headmaster’s office.
To everyone who has read, liked, bookmarked, or commented: Thank you so much for your patience. I know that I haven't updated for a long time, and although the depression was part of it, the other was because this was a very emotional chapter for me. It hits very close to home, and I hope that the emotion reflects in the writing. I cried, a couple of times, while writing it. I only wish that every abused child was as lucky to have a loving forever family the way that my Harry does.
“Harry, what’s wrong? I noticed that you seem to not want to play with the other kids recently. Is everything okay?” Harry looked down at his feet.
The man who grabbed him started running at one point, and Harry watched the garden pass around them, until the man ran head first into an invisible wall and fell back onto the ground, taking Harry with him. He swore, and shoved Harry off him. He pulled his wand out and waved it, muttering under his breath. Harry scooted slowly on his bottom away from the man, hoping that he would be out of reach. The man stopped trying to do whatever magic that he had been attempting and started swearing again.
“The stairs to my right lead up to the Headmaster’s Chambers. It is not time for you to meet him. The stairs on my left lead down to the Founder’s Chambers, which has been waiting for you. Please feel free to explore. Your young familiar will let you know when it’s time for you to return to your bed.” The gargoyle gestured to his left, and Harry moved to the side and saw a staircase covered with dust. Shadow bolted down the stairs, and Harry followed him more slowly. As soon as he stepped on the stairs, torches along the wall sprang to life. Harry wasn’t surprised, as the dungeons did the same thing. They lit as he went down the stairs, and went out as he had passed. Harry counted the stairs as he went down, wanting to remember all the details just like the Malfoys had taught him.
There was indeed outdoor gear in Harry's new clothing, including a hat that covered Harry's scar. With both of them ready to go out into the mid-October wind, they made their way through the castle.
“I think that's perfect.” Severus went back to reading until he was sure that Harry was sleeping. He marked a page back, just to make sure that Harry didn't miss too much of the story, and placed the book on top of the bookshelf. He turned the light off and left the room, closing the door save for a few inches in case Shadow wanted to wander.  He made his way over to the Floo and threw in some powder.
“Welcome, my son, to Diagon Alley.” Harry's eyes were wide with wonder, and Severus was glad that he had taken the time to allow Harry to experience the opening of the portal. Harry had almost no experience with magic, and Severus wanted him to get used to it as quickly as possible.  The two of them walked past Slug and Jiggers, where the students got most of their school potion supplies. Harry made a face at the smell coming from the open door, but his head kept turning back and forth looking at the shop full of owls and the bookstore with books flying around the front windows. He also seemed captured by the posters in between the shops. They moved on their own!
Knowing that Albus wanted Remus to get close to Harry, she let Remus look at the medical file that she had started for Harry even though he wasn’t a student. It cataloged the injuries that Harry had when Severus had brought him to the Infirmary the first night, as well as the severe vision problems and occasional recurrent nightmares. She was also quite irate at the headmaster that he had not checked on Harry previously, as there were scars to prove that the abuse that Harry had suffered had not been a one-time occurrence.
“Your thoughts, my love?” Narcissa turned her gaze to Lucius, weighing his history and everything that they had been through in the last war before answering.
“I guess it’s time to start introducing Harry to other people then…” Severus muttered. Since he had said all that he needed to say, he excused himself. He was ready to sleep, and get ready for Harry's first Yule holiday.
Harry woke up the next morning, confused about where he was. At least, he thought it was morning. It was very dark in the room, but he was warm and the blankets were soft. After a moment, he remembered the events of the previous night. He smiled to himself, and looked up at the ceiling. He wished that he could see what was glowing up there, but even blurry it was pretty. Harry snapped his fingers to turn the light on, then did it again a couple of times to turn the lights off and on again just because he could,  and then slid out from the covers. He pulled them back up, making the bed neatly the way that he had learned at Aunt Petunia's house before walking across the room and peering around the door into the living room area.
“Harry, this is Mr. Remus Lupin, the man I told you was friends with your parents. He’s going to be teaching you some things in the upcoming weeks.” Remus nodded at Harry, who blinked at him.
“Yes, that was Draco. I realize that it was a bad first impression, but I think that you will be a good influence on him. His name means 'Dragon' in Latin, in case you were interested.” Harry's eyes flickered with interest, as Severus knew that they would. Severus wasn't going to force them together, but he was not above using whatever Slytherin means necessary to at least getting them to know each other.
“Are you an elf-lady?” Severus's eyes flickered closed then back open, and his hand came up to cover the smile that he couldn't hold back.  Narcissa burst into delighted laughter. Harry thought that her laugh sounded like bells.
A hissing filled the area, and it took Severus, Lucius, and Remus only a moment to figure out that the hissing was coming from Harry. Rowle didn’t for several minutes, and looked quickly at the ground around him while trying to keep the men in his sights.
“Ladies, if you will excuse me, I have to go relay this situation to the Headmaster.” Minerva looked up at him. “Don’t think for a single second, laddie, that I am going to let you go up there alone. I am going as well. “Minerva’s accent was showing, and she began to make her way towards the door of the infirmary. Severus turned back to Madam Pomfrey.
“Harry, are you okay?” Severus asked. Harry didn’t respond, and a moment later would have fallen to the ground had Severus not caught him.
Vincent and Greg weren't really interested in talking at all. They stood next to each other on one side of the corner and watched Theo, Draco, Blaise, and Harry talk and didn't add anything to the conversation. Pansy sat on a chair by herself and didn't talk either once she had realized that Harry had all of Draco's attention.
“Severus, I don't know how else to say this, but your son... Sev, he's so powerful! To be able to do wandless magic, at his age! He's not even reached his first magical growth spurt! He's... he's so special.” Lucius looked shaken, and in awe.
“The man you are talking about… the bully. I thought he was my friend. I was wrong. I made a mistake. And I have been sorry about it for so long. I don’t know how to make it up to your father, or make him forgive me.” Harry nodded.
“I know, Ari. I am sorry, I don't know why I get so angry. Maybe when Harry comes to hang out, I won't get so angry all the time. “ The house elf nodded, and began to clean things up. Draco left go to find his mom and tell her his great plan.
“It's hard. Makes my head feel funny.” Severus smiled at his talented son and let the fork sink back down.
Merlin was the first wizard in the world, and the most powerful in history. He had one student, Morgana Le Fay, and the love of his life, Nimue. They were the first witches in recorded history. Merlin used his magic to help Kings and Queens and common men around the world. The most famous of these was King Arthur, the King of Brittania and the Celts. Arthur was the most honorable man in the world, but he was betrayed by his wife Guinevere and his best friend Lancelot when the two of them fell in love. Arthur sank into depression and despair, and lost sight of the fact that one of his knights, Mordred, was plotting against him.
“Would you like to sit down Harry?” Harry moved over to one of the chairs and hopped up, still studying Remus. Remus sat down in the chair opposite of Harry and let him look.
“Harry is extra special! All the figurines love him! And he likes dragons as much as I do!” Severus and Narcissa smiled at the boys. Severus noticed that Harry looked nervous, as if he was waiting to get in trouble, so Severus made sure to crouch down next to him and pick up one of the figurines.
“Severus, I have done all I can. The bones might take some more time to completely heal, but they are set. I've also healed all the contusions and the concussion.  It might be a good time to wake him, before he wakes on his own. Merlin knows that being here is going to be surprise enough. ” Severus nodded, and Madam Pomfrey waved her wand in Harry’s direction. Harry began to stir, and Severus and Pomfrey moved closer to the bed.
“F... Father?” Severus paused at the door to the room, his chest tightening at hearing his title for the first time. He blinked a couple of times to make sure that there were no tears in his eyes before turning around.
The Malfoy family had always home schooled their children until they attended secondary school. Draco was familiar with the room, and had brought Harry here. There were now two desks instead of one, and bookshelves lined the room with the exception of the front where a chalkboard covered the entire wall. The boys were seated and waiting for Narcissa while Draco regaled Harry with his adventures in the stables and the creatures that lived there.
He knew that he only had a split second. As all of the heads turned to the opposite side of the room, Rowle darted into the corner and wrapped an arm around Harry's waist, his other hand covering his mouth as he picked up the small boy and ran out one of the terrace doors of the ballroom. He knew he only had minutes before he was noticed as being gone.
Severus saw what was about to happen. He didn't say anything to draw attention to what was transpiring, but turned Harry so that they could both watch the drama as it unfolded.
“For your information, he's adopted.” Rowle stared at Snape for a few more moments, and then turned and walked away into the crowd. Severus watched him go.
Severus came back down to Lucius’s study, using his wand to dry his clothing. Bathing two boys hyper on chocolate had been an experience. He couldn’t say if it had been good, as he had been soaked by the time they were clean, but there had been laughter from both boys that was so innocent that he couldn’t hold back his own smiles. He was even smiling a little when he entered the study. Lucius was reading over the book that Narcissa had brought them earlier.
“Before the Dark Lord fell, he gave me an object that he said was of grave importance. Once I knew what it was, I kept it locked in a magically sealed safe. I believe that it may provide the answers we need.” Lucius went to his bookshelf and pulled out a stack of books, placing them on the edge of his desk. He waved his wand, and a safe appeared on the back wall. A few moments later, and the safe was open. Lucius pulled on a pair of black leather gloves and reached in, pulling out a leather bound journal. It was small and unassuming, but Severus could feel the malevolence emanating off it. It felt... it felt like he was in the presence of the Dark Lord again.
“I am sorry Father, but Shadow was telling me to go with him, and I was told by…” Harry was speaking English again, but paused for a moment and looked at the floor. “I was told that I should trust my instincts, and I felt like it was important that I go with Shadow. And I talked to a gargoyle statue, and a friend who needed me. Well, I think it is. I was worried about leaving the chambers, but I can show you where I went if you want?” Harry held up the basket in his hands. The egg in the basket rocked back and forth, and Remus and Severus could both see a glow from inside shift as the inhabitant of the shell moved. Both Severus and Remus jumped slightly as Harry hissed again, this time directed at the egg.
“And Arthure shall resorte as lord and sovereyne out of fayrye and regne in Breteyne. The serpente and wolfe shall heed his call, and the power of fayrye and magicke will be his to commande. He will banishe the Shadowed Pathe, and his regne will heralde a thousande years of peace.” She read aloud. Narcissa then gave a very uncharacteristic whistle. “Well, that explains a great deal.” Narcissa marked the page with a satin ribbon and went to find her husband and Severus. She had almost reached the study where she assumed they were when she could hear yelling. She could tell that it was coming from Severus, and thought that the other person sounded like Remus Lupin.
“You have to get over your issue with Remus Lupin.” Severus’s good mood dissipated like one of the bubbles from the boy’s bath. He sneered.
“We would be honored and happy to help, Severus, with anything that you and your son need. I am excited to meet him. I am sure that he and Draco will be fast friends, once they meet properly.” She thought for a moment. “With what that poor child went through, I am sure that he is small for his age?” She waited for Severus to nod. “Would you be opposed to some of Draco's clothing? A great deal of it is new and has never been worn, and it will give you and your son time to bond before having to go out in public to go clothing shopping.” Severus smiled and nodded. He knew that Narcissa would never give him anything that wasn't of the highest quality. Narcissa nodded and smiled in return. “Rose, please attend.”
“Vanish what is in your cauldron. Class is dismissed, you have two minutes to gather your things and get out of my classroom.” The students immediately began cleaning up, occasionally glancing in his direction. None of them had ever experienced Professor Snape dismissing class early, but they were going to take it as a win.
“Thank you both. I will bring Harry by at the end of the week to meet you properly. Please let Draco know ahead of time. I would hate to have to distance myself from him because of enmity between the two.” Narcissa and Lucius nodded, and Severus took a handful of Floo powder from the crystal bowl on the mantle.  A moment later, he was gone.
“Can... can I have the blanket back. The one that I had when you found me?” Severus blinked in surprise. That was not what he was expecting.
By the time Harry and Severus were ready to leave, they had more toys, puzzles, games, and books than Harry had ever seen in his life. Everything was placed into bags and shrank down small enough to fit in Severus's pockets. Included in this was a large stuff dragon who's colors matched the tiny figurine who had chosen Harry as his owner. Severus was getting ready to take them back to Hogwarts when something occurred to him. He knew what he was about to do was probably going to make a great deal more work for him, but he also knew that it would help Harry a great deal. He paused for a moment, causing Harry to stop and look up at him.
“Harry, good morning. Please come out. You don't have to be afraid.” Harry swallowed and slowly made his way to the table. He stood next to Severus until Severus pulled a chair out and gestured towards it, indicating for Harry to sit. “Harry, I wanted to talk to you about a couple of things before I go to teach classes for the day.” Harry nodded, not sure if a response was expected or wanted.  He didn't want to make Severus regret taking him in.
“He also managed to make Draco grow a second head.” Lucius nodded and made the same noise, so Narcissa gave up talking to him and went to go refine her lesson plan for the boys.
“If you are going to review history, do not portray Muggles or muggle born as inferior. Both Harry and I are half blood, and I would rather not have to deal with mistaken Pure blood supremacy notions. And I will instruct him in Potions, period. “ Narcissa nodded. She had expected nothing less. Severus bid her farewell, and returned to Hogwarts. Narcissa made her way to the schoolroom.
I cannot tell you how amazing all of the wonderful comments and encouragements have been! Thank you all!
Remus sighed into his tea. He had at one time believed that Albus was the shining example of all things good, but now that he was older and more aware of the world was sure that Albus kept his own agenda. What it was, he had no idea. But he also knew, because of his heightened senses, that Albus had not been completely honest with him. And he didn’t know what to do about it.
“Harry, it's very late. There are many things that we will need to talk about, but we can do it in the morning. You should try to sleep. “ Harry slipped under the blanket and sheet, marveling at how soft the sheet was and how thick and warm the comforter was. Severus watched Harry for a moment. “Can you snap your fingers, Harry?” Severus made sure that Harry could snap his fingers to turn the light off and on, and then turned to leave the room.
As soon as Severus realized that the table was a distraction, he ignored it and started shoving through people to try to get to the terrace. He had hoped that when he got there he would at least get a glimpse of Rowle or Harry. He pushed down his panic, and started moving down the stairs, straining to listen for any sound of struggling or movement from the garden. He couldn’t hear anything because the garden was lit, and Lucius’s stupid fucking white peacocks were screaming and walking around. Severus was half a step from setting them on fire when Lucius came running out.
“I have already brought the situation to the attention of Minerva and Poppy. They were both so furious with Albus that I am sure they will side with me in regards to Harry just to spite him. Minerva actually performed our adoption ritual. Albus will have no more control or influence over my son than the Dark Lord.”
“Ah, Severus, glad you are back. And how is young Harry this evening? Everything resolved? Surely a simple disagreement with his cousin? I noticed that that he seemed fine again not long after you left.”  Albus was reading through notes on his desk, and didn’t notice that Minerva was in the room until she stomped over to his desk and slammed her hand down sharply.
“I heard you muttering in your sleep as I was coming downstairs, I didn’t mean to startle you,” she said as he puts his wand down and drags a hand tiredly through his hair.
“Okay, sure,” Malfoy says as he looks over the movie case. Handing it back to Harry, he turns towards where the couch used to be and stops short.
Between giggles, Harry manages to understand that he has a tile glued to the bottom of his jeans. Malfoy’s eyes glint with a look Harry has seen before, as his smirk settles on his face, Harry makes a decision since he can’t get Hermione’s words out of his head.
Harry feels a jolt of warmth at the glimpse of pure, open happiness on Malfoy’s face. All too soon the moment passes and Malfoy’s stoic mask slides back into place.
“Yes, well, that was not a planned friendship. Ginny forced me to go to the party after you two broke up and Pansy sort of forced me to accept her apology, and I’m not sure exactly how it happened after that but here we are.”
Rifling through his tapes, Harry grins as he pulls one out, “this is one of my absolute favorites. I think you will like it better than the last one too.”
“You’ve been harping on me to talk to someone all year and now that I finally have, you warn me to be careful?” Lowering his voice some since they are in the library studying, Harry continues, “we’ve all changed. I thought you realized that. Hell, you’ve become friends with Pansy of all people.”
After a few moments of silence, Harry offers, “I’ve set up a television and VCR in the library. Want to go watch a movie?”
“Of course I don’t, this is my house,” Harry quips with a lopsided grin, “I get to sleep where I want.” He tries to use humor to stop himself from admitting he sleeps better down here, uncomfortable couch or no.
Harry watches Malfoy’s reaction to the movie more than he actually watches the movie himself. He only realizes it is over when Malfoy looks over at him and sputters, “what the hell was that?”
With that said, he gets up from the couch and goes to the kitchen to start breakfast as Hermoine sets about making tea.
It’s been two weeks since the end of school. Harry notified Kingsley that he was turning down the Auror position the day after they returned from school. It took him three more days to tell Ron. He and Hermione had gone to visit the Weasley family and he told everyone at once. Ron did not take the news well at all, refusing to even tell Harry, and by extension Hermione since she supported his decision, goodbye when they left.
He looks up at Harry with a slightly lost expression. After a few seconds, he blinks the look away and continues, “right now the plan is to pass my NEWTs, then I will figure it out.”
Looking close to tears, Hermione finally comes out with what truly seems to bother her about the situation, “Harry, I just wish you felt like you could talk to me about it all. We experienced most of it together, didn’t we?”
Waking up slowly, Harry feels more rested than he has in a long time. Stretching out the crick in his neck, he realizes he is still in the Astronomy tower. Looking across from him, he notices Malfoy staring at him curiously.
After Harry gets the movie ready, he sits down on one side of the couch. Malfoy follows and sits on the other side. Turning to look at him, Harry explains, “okay, this is a bit of a weird movie, but it’s one of my favorites. The Fifth Element is great and everyone must experience it.”
Hermione opens her mouth to respond but Harry cuts her off, “I know, you’re going to say ‘that’s what friends are for.’ And I love you for it, really I do. You are like my sister and I know I can come to you with anything. When I try to talk to you about it, I dunno, the words just get stuck. With Malfoy they just come blurting out.”
After finding his favorite tea, Harry sets about boiling the water and letting the pot steep while Hermione pulls out creamer and honey for her and sugar for Harry.
“None of us are blameless in any of this Malfoy. We have all done horrible things for the cause we thought was right. It’s not your fault that you were raised with the pure blood ideation,” struggling not to yawn, Harry stretches from his uncomfortable position as he continues, “the moment you started thinking for yourself, you questioned all of it. That shows you are able to learn from your mistakes. You started earning my trust the night you started telling me about your nightmares. I think I might even call you a friend.”
With a shake of his head, Malfoy queries, “how can you trust me that much after everything I’ve done?”
I know the ending is a bit rushed, I was working on a deadline and my procrastination won out a bit but I will be reworking the ending eventually and editing this, I hope you still enjoyed it though!!
Neither were ready to face him yet since he still didn’t seem to understand their reasons. Harry knew Ron was going to take him not going into Auror training even worse than he did school. Putting that off for as long as possible seemed like a good idea.
“I definitely have the room, and it’s not like I really want to stay here by myself right now. You are doing me a favor as much as I am you.”
“If you didn’t like that movie then come look at the others,” Harry says as he moves to one of the bookshelves he had cleared off.
Before long, the train pulls into Kings Cross Station. Mrs. Weasley is there to pick up Ginny while trying to convince Harry and Hermione to stay with them for a few weeks. They both make their excuses. Ron still hadn’t spoken to either of them since he’d said some pretty harsh words about them ‘abandoning’ him to go back to school.
Moving away slightly, Harry turns around and looks at Malfoy, waiting to see what he is going to say.
Laughing at his shenanigans, Hermione shoves his shoulder, “you’ve studied for all of these. Only two more and then we are set free.”
Rubbing his eyes, he fixes his glasses and looks up at her, “how do you know all of this? You knew before even I did and it’s my life.”
Harry wakes up first the last morning of their exams. He takes a moment to really look at Malfoy. The other boy is so relaxed in his sleep, one arm tossed above his head. His usually immaculate hair in disarray.
Clearing his throat, Harry begins, “with everything we’ve talked about, plans after school were never mentioned. Now that the last day is here, I just wondered, what are you going to do?”
After levitating their luggage to the landing, Harry heads towards the kitchen, “cup of tea and then we can figure out which room you want to take?”
Thinking back to when they met on the train their first year, Harry extends his hand to Malfoy. “You aren’t the kid whose friendship I rejected in first year because you were a prejudiced bully. So, can we try being friends now that we are both different from the boys who first met?”
They quickly finish stowing away the rest of the pillows and set their tea things to the side and soon they are heading towards the Great Hall. They go their separate ways at the entryway. Noticing Hermione sitting at the end of the Gryffindor table by herself, Harry hurries over to her.
Raising a questioning brow at the piles throughout the room, Hermione queries, “I take it you were working all night?”
It takes Harry a week before he is tired of transfiguring the couch in the library and after he spent so much time renovating the master bedroom, he decides to just move the television and VCR into his room. Malfoy doesn’t put up as much of a fuss as Harry expects. The weeks stretch on with the same routine. Harry works on parts of the house, Malfoy comes over at night to watch movies, they wake up wrapped around each other in the morning.
He hears the chair scraping against the floor as Malfoy sits down at the table, “trying to distance myself.”
When Gene Wilder and the monster sing and dance, Malfoy starts to laugh. “What the hell even is this, Potter?”
He lets in a familiar eagle owl and gets an impatient peck to the hand when he just stands there and stares at the bird for a few moments too long. Harry takes the letter he offers and reads
“Oh well,” Harry begins, he rubs the back of his head sheepishly. A small blush creeps over his cheeks as he continues, “Hermione is sick of me griping about my back. Since you won’t just admit you are going to fall asleep here, I figured I could transfigure the couch into a bed. I made it big enough that we will have plenty of room to share.”
After saying their goodbyes, Harry can’t help but look around for the familiar blonde hair as he and Hermione make their way to the apparation point. Finally catching a glimpse, he feels the squeeze of being side along apparated and the train station dissolves into black for a few moments before the front door of Grimmauld Place materializes in front of them.
Quickly finding some scrap paper, Harry scrawls a short note along with his floo address. Leaving the mess of sandpaper and tools, he heads downstairs to make some tea. The flames in the kitchen fire turn green a few minutes later and Malfoy steps out of the grate.
“You have been there through pretty much everything with me. That’s why I don’t want to bother you with anymore. You’ve already had enough horrors in your life because of me and you don’t need me adding to it.”
Malfoy never mentions anything about it. While awake he always seems to stay as far from Harry as possible but their bodies gravitate towards each other in their sleep
“Thanks again for letting me stay here with you,” Hermione says as she lifts Crookshanks’ cage while Harry unlocks the door and drags their trunks through.
“I don’t think something scary would help either of our nightmares,” Malfoy states matter-of-factly.
Looking around, Harry realizes the ‘project’ of renovating this house was going to take even more than he thought. He had forgotten exactly how depressing the house was.
“Alright, Harry. I will drop it. But one final piece of advice, I see the way you look at him when you think no one is looking. Be careful, please, because I don’t know if he will ever feel the same way about you that you do about him.”
Harry has ripped Grimmauld Place apart with the rest of his free time. Turning in dark artifacts he found to the Ministry, letting Kreacher pick through some things he wanted to keep, throwing out a heap more things that were just grotesque and bad taste. Harry sleeps worse than ever before. Hermione tries to help, researching ways to keep the nightmares at bay.
As Harry settles back in the bed, he tosses a blanket to Malfoy. The animated movie starts but he barely even stays awake long enough for the muses to finish their opening song.
After clearing her throat, Hermione sits up taller and claps her hands together, “alright, ready for our last exams today?”
“What changed? Hermione, the war changed everything! I have seen enough death and darkness to last any normal person a lifetime. I don’t want it anymore.”
As if sensing Harry’s scrutiny, Malfoy starts to wake up. Pulling his gaze away as the other boy stretches, Harry turns his gaze to the familiar trees. Hoping the blush burning on his face isn’t noticeable.
“I don’t really want to think about all of this right now. Thanks for the advice, Hermione, but I’m going to go work on the bathroom some more until Malfoy gets here.”
Harry had never admitted that to anyone. It felt really good to say it out loud. Malfoy clearing his throat brings Harry out of his musings. Looking towards the other boy, he realizes Malfoy must have said something a few times before he finally caught Harry’s attention. An embarrassed blush tints Harry’s cheeks as he mumbles an apology.
As Harry sands down the floor of what will eventually be his permanent bedroom, he hears a peck at the window. With a quick glance to the clock he notices it is after midnight and wonders who is sending an owl this late.
“Malfoy, we could have hexed each other multiple times throughout the last few months. I’m pretty sure you would have already tried to kill me if that was your intention.”
“Then transfigure the couch or something, Harry. You are a wizard, you know,” with an exasperated sigh, Hermione turns around and looks at him, “you work yourself to the bone during the day and then catch a few hours sleep on one of the most uncomfortable creations in this world. Quit punishing your body so much and figure something out.”
Chest heaving after his small outburst, Harry tries to calm down and explain, “I thought being an Auror was what I was supposed to do. It just made sense, didn’t it? The saviour of the wizarding world becoming a peace officer for it once he came of age. I wanted it so bad, I never thought there would be a time I didn’t want it. But, Hermione, I don’t. The thought makes me panic.”
Harry pauses as he lets Hermione’s words sink in. Heaving a large sigh, he throws his arms around his best friend, “thank you,” he whispers, as he squeezes her tight. He hopes she understands everything he can’t say. Thank you for always being there, no matter what. Thank you for keeping me alive when I would have died a thousand times over. Thank you for supporting even though you don’t always understand. And most importantly, thank you for being the best friend I could ever ask for.
“Harry you were spending too much energy on trying to be what everyone else wanted. I didn’t know for sure until you just confirmed it, but I have suspected for a while now.”
Before she could say anything about him walking in with Malfoy for yet another morning, Harry cuts her off by quickly blurting out, “I don’t want to be an Auror.”
Malfoy had been intrigued when Harry explained what they were during one of their meetups at school.
“I said, we should probably get going so that we aren’t late. You know how Hermione worries if you miss breakfast,” Malfoy repeats.
“Why do you always have to say things like this, Hermione? I am still coming to terms with the fact that I might have feelings for Malfoy. That most of the reason Ginny and I didn’t work out is probably because I am gay.”
Malfoy finds Harry a few hours later in the bathroom off the master bedroom, laying tile the muggle way. Harry stands up and he notices has bits of plaster in his hair and a line of caulk across his cheek. Turning around to find a towel to wipe his face with, Malfoy starts hooting with laughter.
He is nowhere to be found in any of the train compartments. Harry checked, twice. Sitting down across from Hermione, he lays his head back, wishing he didn’t know what those few weeks of decent sleep felt like. His head was pounding, his eyes burned. He had almost forgotten what a night of no sleep felt like. Knowing the months would stretch out endlessly like this, Harry started making plans to work on Grimmauld Place that would hopefully leave him so exhausted his mind would have no choice but to let him sleep without nightmares.
“You and everyone else. Just because they offered me a position before I even came back to finish school doesn’t mean it’s what I want my career to be. I’ve had enough of fighting and taking down the bad guys.”
Dreamless sleep potion is addictive and quits working the more you take it. Harry hates the stuff. The potion makes him feel even less in control than the nightmares did. After one dose he refuses to take it again, no matter how bad the dreams get.
Harry watches as Malfoy looks back and forth between his hand and his face a few times, a plethora of emotions flashing across his features. Finally coming to a decision, it seems, he sits up from his slouched position, “I don’t have much of a choice now, do I? You know more of my secrets than anyone ever really has,” Malfoy assents as he shakes Harry’s hand, a small smile appearing momentarily.
“Oh, Harry, you would be surprised how many people would be willing to support you in following your dreams. Wherever that takes you.”
Scrubbing his hands through his hair, Harry continues, “I know you worry, that’s what you’re best at besides research and mastering new spells, but there is nothing to worry about. We have actually become friends.”
“Hermione, there really isn’t much else to tell you. He sleeps as little as I do. We meet up and talk most nights when we can’t stay in our common rooms anymore. It’s better than just wandering the castle like I used to, isn’t it?”
Reaching out to take the cup Malfoy offers him, Harry sighs at the first sip. Strong like Winky always makes, and sweetened a tad, just how he liked it. With a small pang, he realized there will only be one more morning like this. Today was the last day of their exams, all of the eighth year students who opted to not participate in the end of term festivities would be leaving the castle tomorrow to head back home. Harry would be going back to Grimmauld Place while Malfoy would presumably be going back to the manor.
Kreacher stocked the kitchen in anticipation of Harry returning to the house. They found a common ground the summer after the war. Harry didn’t ask much of him, but Kreacher kept the house as best he could and made sure the kitchen was always full.
Harry turns around and sees his derisive sneer as Malfoy continues, “I wouldn’t be a true Malfoy if I didn’t at least try to convince myself that I don’t need anyone.”
This time, Hermione’s eyes bug out of her head a little bit. Harry sees her struggle to pull herself back together. After a few moments she manages to calmly state, “Harry you’ve said you wanted to be an Auror since fifth year, what changed?”
“Harry, it will be ok. I’m sure all you have to do is write to Kingsley. Let him know you are declining the position. Even if he doesn’t understand, he probably won’t ask you to explain,” Hermione tries to reassure him.
Harry wakes up in a flash, sitting up and immediately pointing his wand towards the noise he heard. Hermione lets out a squeak as she raises her hands to show she is unarmed.
Hermione decides to take the room across from Harry’s when they head upstairs. After he helps her move a few things around, he leaves her to finish unpacking and heads to his room. Unpacking does little to calm the restlessness that settles inside him. Harry gets tired of pacing his room and sets off back downstairs. Even though it is late, he doesn’t see the point in waiting until morning to start working on the library...
“Hermione, I’ve offered him one of the bedrooms. He always says he isn’t planning on staying and refuses. I’m not just going to leave him to sleep on the couch by himself.”
With a laugh Harry replies, “you would be surprised how uncomfortable some of the furniture is in this house.”
Malfoy doesn’t show up that night in the Astronomy Tower. Harry waits until the sun has risen and unless he hurries to pack his things immediately he is going to miss the train.
While enjoying their drinks, Harry explains his plans for the house to Hermione. Starting with the library and then a bedroom. Updating the kitchen a little was going to have to be a priority as well.
“You like comedies so I thought I would show you another of my favorite movies. You might not understand all the humor in it but I really wanted to watch it tonight.”
Surging forward the few steps, Harry closes the distance between the two of them. With a handful of Malfoy’s hair, he crashes their lips together. Unsure which one of them moans at the contact, Harry deepens the kiss.
“You passed out. Just the stress of the situation, I think. He didn’t hurt you, did he?” Severus asked, continuing to rub circles on Harry’s back soothingly. Draco moved up and was cuddling with Harry. Harry began to fiddle with the edge of his pajama top.
“There was one other thing that I wanted you to know. The headmaster doesn’t know that you have been taking lessons with the Malfoys, and thinks that you don’t know anything about the Wizarding world. I wanted him to think this, because I wanted him to leave you alone. I am going to tell Mr. Lupin that you have been taking lessons, but I would very much appreciate if you would not tell him who you have been taking lessons with. And nothing about the wandless magic. Not until I tell you.” Harry could tell that this was important to his father, and he never wanted to disappoint him.
Harry let Shadow jump out of his lap, stood up and looked in the mirror. While his hair was still obviously curly, it no longer stuck up in all directions. Harry looked up at his father and nodded. He had family!
Harry looked around the room as the lights came on at the room that his new father said was his. His life was changing so fast that he didn't know what to do or think. Severus set Harry down on the floor and pulled the blanket and sheet down so Harry could get into the bed. He gestured towards the bed, and Harry climbed up.
Thank you everyone for all of the wonderful comments. Quick update this week, unexpected urge to write took me over. Should be able to get another update next week sometime. Enjoy your Thanksgiving fellow Americans!
“Sir, I don't know if you are going to want that cat. He's not a kitten anymore, and he's about 3/4ths Kneazle. He's been returned a number of times. Poor thing, just a little over a year old.” Severus narrowed his eyes at the young snip of a boy who dared try to tell him what he wanted.
“I know that I was worried about you, but I want to say that I am proud of you for following your instincts. It’s important to hone that skill, and I know it’s hard to recognize. In time, you will also know when to discuss these instincts and when to keep them to yourself.” Harry smiled a small smile and nodded, then led Severus out of their rooms and towards the chamber that he had found the Occamy in. As they got closer to Dumbledore’s rooms Severus grew worried, but Harry noticed and took one of Severus’s hands in his.
“Alright, Harry. Would you like to try something right now?” Harry looked up and then smiled and nodded. “Lucius pointed at the salt shaker in the middle of the table. “We are going to try to move the salt shaker. In any direction. I want you to think about your magic. Feel it through your body, in your blood. It's almost like a buzzing under your skin. Now try to push it out, and push the shaker.” Lucius wasn't expecting anything, but he wanted Harry to get an idea of what his magic felt like.
Draco was beside himself, and was perched on a chair on the other side of the bed with his knees pulled up to his chest and his eyes puffy from crying. He had been so worried about Harry, and when Harry was brought back unconscious in Severus’s arms he had thought he was dead. His mother had held him as he wept, and Lucius had tried to calm him as best he could and explained that Harry hadn’t been hurt, but had only passed out once he knew he was safe. Draco refused to leave Harry’s side, and all of the adults were sure that the minute they were left alone Draco would climb into bed with him.
“Welcome to being a parent, Severus. They will drive you crazy, and make your hair turn grey, but it’s worth it. Well, maybe your hair.” She smirked, and ran a hand over her perfect platinum locks. Lucius smirked with her, and Severus rolled his eyes at their joined vanity.
“Harry, I would be honored to teach you to help protect our family. We will have to wait until you have a wand, and I am sure that your father will be teaching you things as well. Until then, I would be more than happy to teach you how to deal with people and recognize when they are trying to manipulate you. We will help you protect your father. ” Without even trying and without either of them knowing it, Harry had appealed to Lucius's greatest weakness and had earned his loyalty.
Draco cracked an eye open, immediately shutting it again as he found himself caught by the sun. “Potter, why are you in my house?”
“Are you aware I don’t speak eye anatomy?” He didn’t say it meanly, it was just a stated fact, like a secret shared between only them, this small admittance of ignorance.
Draco inhaled his laugh so quickly that it came out as a snort, which, of course, Harry had fun mimicking for the five minutes it took to walk back to Draco's. By the time they got to the door they were both in stitches, having to catch their breath before saying their goodbyes.
Harry admitted his success with the kettle with some joviality. His eyes lighting up as he watched Draco eye his mug very carefully before shrugging and leaning over to steal Harry’s half full mug left over from dinner.
Draco left Harry draped over the chesterfield as he went to retrieve the pizza from a, now very wet, delivery boy, apologising profusely up until he shut the door.
He could see Luna's shoes from where he was lying against the table. They were small and brown, Mary Janes, he thought they were called. He couldn't really care less. Especially as they'd been offset with some garish striped tights in some shade of traffic-cone orange.
“Shacklebolt might relegate you to the archives, or actually make you do your backlog of paperwork.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Your broom.” He shook a tree branch above his head and watched in delight as Harry picked needles from his mane of hair.
“I see you’re back to bullying my husband.” Hermione appeared from behind a paper bag full of vegetables. She turned to Ron. “What’s he done this time?”
“Uh, no.” Ron jerked his wand in an arc and Harry watched the dishes position themselves neatly in the drying rack before remembering he needed to breathe out. It seemed all the breath had been taken from him the moment Ron had said the word a
Amusement danced in Harry’s eyes as Draco shifted his weight onto his elbows, interlacing his delicate fingers before resting his chin neatly between his knuckles.
“Everyone knows sticking charms are tricky. Sometimes magic just won’t budge without Muggle equipment. It’s what we used to use before wands, you know.”
Draco told Harry as much in bed that morning. Calling him unconventional just made Harry laugh as he’d pressed his stomach into Draco’s, forehead resting neatly between the crook of his neck and his shoulder.
The place was already swarming and Draco delicately put his hand on Harry’s arm. “Please be careful. Ron said Hermione’s looking into it.”
Narcissa fixed him with a pointed glare before shifting her paper in her lap, eventually deciding to flick through it, and Draco watched as it once more obscured her face. The way Narcissa sat, her ankles so obviously crossed at the balls, her back ridgid, The Prophet may as well have been an expensive pair of sunglasses.
“I don’t know.” Draco did look genuinely confused as he eyed his belongings that had been packed away into the large desk.
She was working as Shacklebolt's secretary part time "just until the business gets off the ground". Surprisingly, Draco learned, the business venture was in fact, carpentry. "I know," Luna shook her head as she meandered through mostly deserted hallways, Draco trailing behind her like a dejected puppy, "everyone seems to think I should be off travelling the world, or planting flowers or something but I just don't see it."
He grabbed the sides, the feel of the cold wood between his fingers grounding. “What the hell have they done with my research?”
Not halfway through the second cigarette he started shivering. Smoke curled around his nostrils like dragons breath and it was only halfway between him trying to wrap his left hand around the tiny orange ember of fire that he realised he didn't actually have to stand outside in the draughty doorway of The Blind Phoenix.
“You read anything in A History Of Magic? And remembered it? I refuse to believe that.” Draco rolled his eyes, starting to crank the box, slow and methodical. A deathly hush fell over them. “I don’t know why I was expecting music notes. It’s worse without.”
"Morning, Potter." Draco mumbled, deciding it was probably best to hide his blush in the bed sheets if the man ever bloody woke.
She sat near the front of the congregation, her hair more white than blonde now, although still long and fine as it had been years ago.
“This is the most unorthodox position you could have put yourself in.” Harry said. From his vantage point, Draco was as fuzzy as he had been every time Harry had to remove his glasses, all soft and sweet, like a rippling puddle or a streetlight after you try to focus on it for too long.
And Harry had laughed. A decisive snort that dissolved into a smattering of underhanded giggles. Inappropriate, when he looked back on it, the way it had all started, haltingly, over an over abundance of alcohol and gallows humour.
Draco thought about this for a moment, the tip of his wand tapping against his chin. “I concede.” With that he dumped himself at Harry’s feet, legs crossed.
He immediately reached for his gloves. “There has to be fingerprints or…” whatever he was doing, he wasn’t talking to Harry anymore.
“Hermione told me I might have to wait because of, well, everything. But I think I’ve waited long enough. I know it’s terrible etiquette to do this while you’re eating but I’m just really nervous and I hate keeping secrets from you even though it’s not really a secret anymore.” He laughed.
He plumped for running his fingers over the raised surface of the spines as he put it all together: the first letters of the last names screaming at him to understand, although by his smile, he felt like he already did.
There was no mess. No reams of parchment, no glass phials, and no eye. It was almost as if the place had been ransacked in reverse. “Shit, fuck, I’m going to be-” Draco rotated slowly, trying not to tap; on his leg, or the tables or the wobbling shelves at the back of the room.
"And I am?" Harry's eyebrows disappeared into his hair as he watched Draco frantically search the room for his clothes without moving from the bed.
"Marrying me what the-" Draco cut himself off as he spied the clothes he'd kicked off earlier in the night. Apart from them being all over his room, a lone shoe sat snuggled in the corner. A lone shoe with a big, purple stain on the upper part of his shoe.
“Shut up I wasn’t finished on my soap box.” Draco pulled his hands over his face in order to stifle his giggles.
Draco thought of answering truthfully for all of three seconds before reverting back to a sneer. “Even I didn't think you were that dense. You see that branch you were so lovingly gazing at earlier, the one on the floor. Well, it’s come from this tree, you see, so putting two and two together you’d see I’m-”
Draco hadn’t made up his mind on what to think about Harry’s newfound love for meticulous timekeeping.
“My world has always been very black and white.” Harry said after a moment of silence. “There are good people and there are bad people.”
“What things?” Harry asked. He rubbed his head before taking a seat opposite Draco. “I won’t grass if that’s what you’re thinking. Robards is an arsehole.”
"At least it can't get any worse." Draco whispered to himself as he vanished the soot and righted the floo powder. He decided to re-tie his shoe the Muggle way, whether it was to avoid looking his father in the eye or to piss him off, he hadn't quite decided yet.
“Pureblood genes.” Ron shrugged, his button down heaving along with his chest, “It’s just something that gets passed down through the family and you assume everyone else just knows about it. It honestly didn’t twig until tonight that you might be looking for a sticking charm solution. Anyway, it’s not really a
It had started as expected, with Hermione pulling Harry into the kitchen by the sleeve of his jumper to demand what was going on. “As an adult I thought I was above punching people but right now I feel like I’m not.”
He screwed up his nose, not wanting to think about Robards at all, let alone while he was sneaking around the underbelly of the only wizarding government building in London. To take his mind off what they were doing - which he still felt uneasy about, regardless of how legal it would have been if he’d taken his superiors up on their offer - he talked. A lot.
Draco whipped around with the ferocity of a viper. “No. You’re a witness.” It took him another five seconds to say “I bet it was Robards.”
Draco turned back around as if she’d physically taken hold of his shirt and pulled him. “So, what’s all this about?” She nodded to the door Harry had left through, a delicate eyebrow arching upwards.
“And have you? Perfected it I mean- OW!” Harry yanked his arm away from Draco’s long fingers, as a long red mark started to appear.
A silence had fallen until Harry asked what Draco was looking at. He was confused for a split second before he realised his eyes had drifted, fixing on a non-specific point in the sky.
“They’ve taken me off the case. I didn’t promise to fix your stupid eyes and they took me off the bloody case.” He said as calmly as he could, his voice barely shaking.
Purple drapes hung just inside the second door, trying - and failing spectacularly - to give some modicum of privacy. Draco almost snorted. The Phoenix was known for a lot of things but it was definitely not their privacy.
managed to sound haughty and annoyed, his crisp, clipped accent causing them both to dissolve into more, quiet giggles.
Harry’s eyes shone with wonderment, as if it was the first time he was seeing snow and not the hundreth.
He shrugged it off when his alarm clock didn’t ring; it’d been broken for so long it was just part of the decor now.
He brought his hand up to his forehead self-consciously and Draco reached out, just shy of touching his knuckles. Slowly, Harry entwined his fingers with Draco’s.
were bitter, coated in the same self-hatred Harry sometimes saw in himself - when he looked in the mirror and something wasn’t quite
Draco’s eyes shone at this, although he fought tooth and nail with his burgeoning smile - choosing instead to take a couch cushion from its space between the back of the sofa and his ribs and hurl it at Harry’s head.
- that he made the decision to wait it out, settling his back against the curve of the tree, feeling the rough edges of the bark digging into his shirt. His warming charm was bad, dipping in and out, but it was more than nothing, a cocoon against the cool breeze.
In the same instance, the eyeball thudded against the tank, hard enough to break the glass. Solution spilled and Draco grabbed his wand, managing to throw up a shield as glass pieces flung themselves outward, embedding themselves in neat diagonal rows in the wall behind him.
"Bastard." Draco whispered, Narcissa pulled the newspaper down from her eyes, raising an arched brow in Draco's direction.
“Okay.” He said to fill the silence, looking anywhere but Harry’s face. In those moments leading up to what he could have said it was as if time stood still, even the ticking clock held it’s breath.
“An idiot.” Harry said softly into the night, staring up at Draco as he gesticulated at the air, long limbs swaying in graceful arcs as he talked, ignoring Harry’s lopsided grin completely.
Draco still can't quite place it - cedar and cinnamon with undertones of... something - maybe broom polish. His toes are visible from the bottom of the blanket. Harry's so much shorter than he is, it's so obviously a perfect size for him. He resolves to find a place that supplies knitting needles, and some wool.
He thought he’d done a rather remarkable job of schooling his face into something that resembled outrage at being interrupted while pretending to read.
“Wait, so he’s only had one disaster today?” Hermione decided she could corner him about getting a filing tray some other time. “He’s drinking, we have to do something before he makes a complete fool of himself.”
“I used the massive book on the desk for reference. I’m really sorry Draco. I didn’t mean to tell you this late but I was thinking about-”
“Surprise!” The living room floo spat out green flames as Draco landed neatly on the carpet, brushing his immaculate robes for invisible dust as he did so. “Mon Chou, I’m home.” The name calling had been intentionally sarcastic at first, a nod to Harry’s Cabbage-Patch bedhead, but, as these things do, it had stuck. “Where are you?”
And with that Draco was swept up into Harry's arms, in an embrace that he couldn't describe if he tried. All he knew was he didnt want to let go.
Pansy drank her wine in long gulps, making a face every time, her dark red lips bunching together in the worst way.
He looks at his hands before he has chance to register his face. They fly over the keys, barely touching them as the melody wafts around the dancers. Harry's eyes are immediately drawn to his fingers, long and graceful. They're adorned with sparkling silver, the rings catching in the florescents every time he twists his hands. Harry finds himself weaving his way through the dancers, just to get a closer look.
“It tastes like shit. My head hurts.” He said offhandedly, as if he’d just noticed, as if it hadn’t been pulsing slowly behind his temples since late afternoon, although, it was easing.
, he thought ruefully but Harry had chosen to stay the night. Again. To be there when he woke in the morning. He wasn’t sure when that had become a regular occurrence but Draco wasn’t going to complain, in fact, he’d make the most of it and he’d told Harry as much.
He wasn’t sure what he was defending - looking at Harry laugh, the crinkles he got around his eyes, the dimple that popped deeply from his left cheek, he didn’t care.
A light appeared from Harry’s own outstretched wand, bathing his face in a clear pearlescent glow. His eyes were clouded with sleep and his hair mussed up on one side. He grimaced as he watched Draco take in his new, clearer appearance.
“There’s a knob on the side.” Harry nodded to his left. Draco grimaced on impulse but it was more because it was Harry who had noticed something he hadn’t. In his office, nonetheless.
“Both. Where’d you get that?” Harry pointed to the chicken bits scattered across Ron’s dish. They were certainly not on the menu from what Harry had seen.
“Because I can teach you if you want.” He backtracked immediately. “Or I could put you through to someone to help you learn.”
The word test subject was used a lot, Shacklebolt waving his arms around like an energetic turnstile.
“Those are for the guests.” Harry protested weakly, voice barely a whisper as the tick fabric settled over his back.
Before either of his parents could argue for or against, Draco rushed to the wine cellar on his own accord.
He knew he could let go, but he just wanted to feel the warmth of Harry’s arms, the repeated rise and fall of his chest. The reminder they were alive and that everything might really be okay, despite his pesky need for stronger reading glasses.
"Not again?" A rich, deep chuckle sounded from across the room. "So, Lark Finchham wasn't lying. then?"
Taking a long drink, Harry’s vision blurred more than usual before slamming back into focus like a snapped elastic band.
It was turmoil, everything turned on its head. He respected his father but now that he was in jail Draco had time to re-evaluate that he might have been wrong, as least some of the time. Government conspiracy though, he didn’t have the energy. He had NEWT’s to study for.
"So," Draco unpopped the cork of what was now his wine. He listened as it made a satisfying whistling noise, the trapped air finally set free. "you're free to criticise... after my fourth glass." He kept his eyes locked on his father's as he poured himself a generous amount of wine.
Technically, Draco should have been in bed by now, he’d finished cashing sales and pottering around in the semi-functional on-site kitchen - which was really just a back room with a slightly broken kettle.
Harry thought for a moment that Draco would pull back, especially when the rain started to fall, soft and steady. His glasses were wet with rainwater and Draco’s blonde hair was darkening.
Draco wasn’t a lab technician but he wasn’t an idiot either. If he got his possessions down to fingerprint analysis he could get results within the hour—if he promised Pansy he’d come over later for some cream scones and pink wine.
He also thought some other things but they were definitely more down to his lack of a sex life and absolutely nothing to do with the hint of clavicle under Draco’s shirt.
While Harry went to the bathroom Draco took stock of the living room. A photo of him was perched on the corner of the bookcase. He was laughing about something over wine at the pub with Pansy. He left the sofa, walking over to see it better.
It'd been Granger's innovation, if he remembered correctly, God knows Potter hadn't developed any of his grandfather's talent for hair potions. However, the way Luna wore the spell was unique.
“If I had jurisdiction to fire you I would have you out on your ear.” Draco rolled his eyes. “I bet he’s tampered with the evidence, tried to make me look incompetent or some such, all because I said I wouldn’t work on your stupid eyes. I’m not an optometrist. I’m studying the eye, nothing else.”
Harry coloured at this, smiling sheepishly. “She dropped off some sort of cake. I don’t know what it is but I found it in the fireplace with a note.”
Released from his parents hold unexpectedly, he'd spiralled. Quite dramatically, too, if he might add. His mother had begged for him to come with them, of course, as soon as his father came out of Azkaban. He'd stoutly refused the offer. Even a portkey to France would be too much time trapped in a small space with Lucius these days.
Although he would never say it to her face, he could understand why his father had wanted to marry her.
Draco shut his eyes, trying to refocus the wavering images he'd managed to dredge up from last night... and if the hair was anything to go by..
He held onto Harry as tightly as he dared as Harry turned them both around once before setting Draco back onto the wood beneath his feet.
“She’s going in a Muggle car! They have something called a chauffeur!” Arthur talked nineteen to the dozen as he ducked under the awning of a new café en route to the town hall that had been dutifully cleared of Muggles - although it needn’t had been; the snow had settled overnight.
He craned his neck, looking back at the photograph of his husband and his friends, Hermione’s head thrown back in unashamed laughter.
Draco settled his head back on the sofa. “Can I continue my monologuing, now that you know there’s food on the way?”
“I’m sorry Potter, but upon finding my desk looking like a jack-in-a-box my first inclination is not to wind it up.” He sniffed. Clowns were not his strong suit. “They’re creepy.”
The mint green double doors were supposed to be inviting but they reminded Harry of a hospital. They opened and he gawked a little at the blonde head that emerged, sweat made the platinum go a dishwater colour but Harry could tell it was him. He didn’t leave the place, or it felt like it. Maybe they were experimenting on him. It sure looked like it, the man drawn and haggard from wherever he had been, or maybe from wherever he was going. He wouldn’t ask.
Draco resolved that he definitely wouldn’t be building anything for anyone, especially Harry Potter.
Draco had mumbled something back to him, indignation cutting below the halfhearted note in his voice as he tried to seek out Harry’s warmth while simultaneously not moving more than three inches. He didn’t really know whether Harry was talking about his book obsession or their relationship when he’d called Draco unconventional. He wasn’t about to ask now, not this far into… whatever
Pansy always had an absolute need to wind him up, but she was doing him a favour when she could be drinking her tea in the staff “kitchen”; read: cupboard and not wasting pairs of rubber gloves like they grew on trees. Draco took the bait.
“No way, I’m done with all that. You’re an adult and you have a bunch of money, even if you choose to live in that torn up apartment you can’t hide from your privilege so use it. I know you have in the past. You still do.”
Draco rolled his eyes but decided to keep his thoughts to himself. Instead he shuffled further from the tree trunk. “Lie down.”
“His filing system? No, no, that is his filing system. Merlin knows how he can find anything in that mess but-”
“You don’t know anything about my paperwork load, that’s private information of the Auror Department.”
“He should be alright for a certain length of time - don’t ask me how long he’s got its specific to the castor/castee - but since he slipped in the shower this morning and managed to completely destroy his filing system-”
Draco took another sip of his drink (the vodka had been replaced with something a lot more fruity and a lot more alcoholic over the course of the hour), forcing himself to behave as not-Harry bent towards him.
He tried to tune out the sound of merriment floating down from the castle, the scent of cooked food following closely behind; chicken and scotched eggs and pastry.
"I'm saddened you don't get the Prophet delivered any more Draco. I hear page three is... interesting."
“You talk too much. Ask too many questions.” Draco was sounding it out slowly, as if he was reading from a baby book.
“So, all I’m saying is they could be a little more respectful in regards to such an ancient language.” Hermione looked up expectantly.
Draco smiled lopsidedly, trying for a smirk that he didn’t have the energy to conjure this late in the day.
“It’s cold.” Draco cast a heating charm on the tepid liquid before giving his own mug of tea a chance.
“He’s having charm troubles.” Harry hadn’t noticed the point when Ron had gotten himself a drink but now that he had it he was definitely chuckling into his butterbeer.
“Since you’ve had such a terrible week I’m going to leave you in here,” he glanced around to make sure the bedroom was tidy enough for Harry not to make a fool of himself if he disappeared. “I’ll assume you’re okay to put yourself to bed while I make your tea.”
“That he was right, essentially.” Her eyes were steely as she levelled her chin towards Draco, who was trying his best not to smirk. “Don’t. Say. A. Word.”
It wasn’t the most flattering position, being splayed out on his stomach with a blue alcohol soaked cloth in one hand and a bright yellow glue scraper in another.
“Now you’re being overdramatic. Just pretend you don’t know for Christ’s sake.” Hermione put her hand to her forehead for a second.
The light flared so abruptly that Harry recoiled, banging his head on one of the pipes to the sink as he went.
He touched his hair gingerly before zeroing in on Harry's dresser. "Is that a... Chudley Cannons scarf? That's it. Crush on you well and truly finished."
It snowed the night before the wedding, fat white flakes skimming the windows to settle on already heavily laden windowsills across the country. But Harry wasn’t bitter, not at all, in fact, they’d gotten a floo call about it a month before - the venue manager asking if they’d like a
’ was definitely lying.” Harry was sat on the toilet lid as Draco sponged his dress shirt quite vigorously with a wet cloth.
Ron really lost it then and everyone else in the room had to wait patiently for him to stop gasping.
The silhouette was dark amongst the branches, looking too short to reach for the lower branches to help Draco from his seat in the higher up boughs. He would have mistaken him for a forth year if not for the obviously tousled curls.
“Just because it moves doesn’t mean it’s still alive - if it ever was to begin with. Mad Eye is dead and, with all intents and purposes, so is that thing.” He told himself as he picked the glove from the floor, dropping it into the bin as he left. He bit the inside of his cheek as he listened to the slow rattle of the eye slamming back and forth against the lock on the box.
Draco rolled his eyes skyward. She was so passive aggressive sometimes. “Would you like me to make you some tea, Pansy?”
“Head Auror Robards, then.” He focused on the eye, noting specifics before grabbing his wand. He watched Robards flinch and felt a tendril of guilt leap from his stomach. “You didn’t answer my question. What are you doing in the Department of Mysteries? Are you lost?”
Harry had been talking since they’d swung out of the Atrium doors, half the Ministry flooing to their respective homes or the pub.
His leg was slung over the side of the sofa as Draco slid in between Harry’s limbs, moving his eyelids with gentle thumb pads.
Silvery wisps of hair collected around Draco’s face. He was so used to being taller than Harry that the disadvantage he was suddenly at made him blush.
He supposed some clubs used a modified fidellius charm, but they were reserved for the elite, so he wouldn't know anything about that. He supposed his parents might. He instantly wrinkled his nose at the idea of Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy sharing a bottle of Odgen's finest and complaining about the poor service despite having the best seat in the house.
"Harry? No- I started smoking." As if to prove it, Draco pulled the wand from his teeth, holding it aloft between his forefingers.
wouldn’t keep tripping over it - But, evidently, it didn’t work.” He briefly removed his hands from his face to gesture the still stuck shoes.
He looked up, eyes skimming past the windows of the upper levels of the Ministry where people were scurrying about like moths in a tank. His eyes rested on the top floor: Level One; the offices of the Minister. He watched Kingsley swoop around the room as an unidentifiable man stood, statuesque at the door, refusing to move into the light. No matter how much Harry squinted, he couldn’t make out who it was—until, of course, Draco Malfoy apparated into the Atrium with a loud pop.
Draco sighed, but made little more complaint as he folded over Harry’s shirt fabric until he got enough to work on.
Harry turned around too quickly, almost knocking himself out on a cupboard. “You think? Everything you ever do is illegal.”
He lowered the shield and whisked away the broken glass. The eye was surprisingly unharmed. When he turned back around, Draco was faced with an empty room. Robards had left. The door, however, was swinging on it’s latch.
The tree had grown since his antics in 5th year and he had found, quite by accident, that he could no longer jump to the floor.
Harry was almost bouncing on the balls of his feet as Draco struggled into a shirt, his arms flailing slightly.
By the time they got to the Portkey Harry had eaten half a cucumber sandwich and a fifth of a chocolate frog.
“...because of all your privately funded orphanages I know.” Harry rolled his eyes but he smiled a little, pushing his glasses up his nose. “And before you say anything I know it was you because your fathers an arsehole and he’s the only one who lives anywhere near you who has a rivalling amount of money. I don’t want you to think I was snooping that one time I brought you Chinese food.”
He stared at Harry’s palm again and he almost asked Harry why his lifeline had a scar cutting through it but quickly thought better of it. Skeletons, he thought, should stay in closets. For now, at least.
“I mean, it’s only us with these useless signs. And the drop boxes… I’d understand if they decided to update the equipment but I’m not allowed so much as a ballpoint pen!”
Draco had tried slipping into the pub via the side entrance, expecting to sneak up behind Harry so that he could be seated before the man even knew he was there. No such luck.
Harry’s breath was shallower as he let Draco guide his hand. “See that the North Star is to the left? Well… if you look to the right that’s Leo.”
He snarled the words polite society as if they’d personally wronged him, although with some of Ron’s family - not including his parents - it wouldn’t be that far from the truth. As quickly as the anger had come, it dissipated. The hard lines of his face smoothed back into something that resembled Ron, a look that embodied him so perfectly that there was no singular way to describe it.
Pansy and Ginny sat together while Luna moved to the back, trailing something long and pink in her wake.
"Maybe if I looked more like sodding Harry Potter the general public would like me better." He mumbled, slipping, quite literally into a bar stool. He was about to put his fingers up to request a drink when he felt someone shift into the seat beside him.
“Great, you can just tell him I flooded the kitchen instead.” Harry was too tired to do much but let his head drop back against the pillow as Draco stroked his forehead.
Harry shifted to lean back against the tree, sinking down into the mushy earth. “What’s the closest star to a Harry star?”
He decided not to point out the very obvious signs of Harry’s presence - in the shop and his upstairs flat.
The response was so snarky that Draco heard Pansy in his head “You’re even starting to sound like him.”
Ron narrowed his eyes and Harry was startingly reminded of Hermione. Since when did Ron become the sensible one! God!
“He’s got his wand on him, I don’t want to be hit with any angry spells, which we will be if we just try to drag him away.”
"Oh for Sala-" Draco caught himself. No-one spoke to him outside of Potter's stupid charity fundraisers and speeches, he might as well bandy the bloke's name around for some purpose. "Yes, I did."
“Well, you don’t, so, either tell me what you’re doing in my space or leave. Shut the door behind you.”
. It’s why he didn’t go near the washing machine unless there was a dire circumstance. He looked down at the table, trying his best to glare a hole through it while thinking about Harry’s odd socks.
"Oh for Merlin's sake." Harry bundled Draco, all long, dangling limbs and unusually hard stomach over his shoulder. "You'd better keep your appendages inside the damn car." Harry whispered softly as he apparated them back to England, accompanied to the never-ending tune of carnival music in Harry's head.
"I'd better be going anyway-" Draco was about to ask for the man-who-certainly-was-not-Potter's age, but before he could he was cut off by his voice - clearly he hadn't finished his little goodbye speech "-I'd better be getting back to the Mrs."
But then Harry is by his side again, grasping his gloved hand and thrusting both of their hands deep into his coat pocket.
It was infuriating how the man smiled with such ease. No one smiled like that after the war, not even Potter, regardless of his blase attitude. Draco bit his tongue instead, just for something to do. He'd been doing it a lot lately.
Harry had ended up on the sofa again. This time lying down. Draco was kneeling over him, all talk of numbing and slight twitchiness.
“You’re one to talk about convention.” Harry had moved to prop himself up on an elbow, shifting in such a way that Draco groaned where the mattress dipped.
But now, like this, he looked forward to it all, the good and the bad. Most of all he looked forward to Draco being happy. He looked forward to being alive to see it happen.
Harry put his head in his hands, slumping into a rounded armchair that was tucked beside the window to Draco’s left. “This is my fault isn’t it?”
Draco's hands are delicate, pearlescent. Harry just wants to hold them to his chest, kiss his fingertips... try to breathe some life into the marble beauty beneath him.
Harry crossed the room so he could lean his head on Draco’s shoulder, kissing his neck intermittently. “I mean it. You look good in everything. Including-” He’d started popping the buttons of Draco’s suit jacket before Draco yelped.
“Two days.” Harry sighed miserably. “I don’t know why he puts up with it all; I spelled his grey robes pink the day he was due to Portkey there.”
“Hey! Ow.” Harry shook his head so his curls fell back over Draco’s fingers. “What are you doing anyway? You’re not a healer.”
“Your issue is with your macula… or fovea I haven’t figured out which yet since they’re so close together— look up?”
“Really, mate? You couldn’t have walked the two feet in front of you to get the chips?” Ron shook his head, his stubble almost glowing under the low lights.
“Yes, that’s precisely it.” Draco blinked up at him sleepily as Harry moved none-too-gracefully towards the table so he was bent over him. “Although I’d rather eat at the table.”
The wine cellar was cool and dry, and quiet. His head was pounding. Draco knew he would never get used to the dry heat of Brittany the way Narcissa had. For all her faults, his mother always looked immaculate, even now, with the greying streaks slicing through her blonde hair - it only served to make her look like a fractured mirror when she moved, beautiful and strange.
“I was gone for five days and you’ve managed to destroy most of downstairs.” It wasn’t a question, Draco’s lips quirked in the approximation of a smile as Harry tried to pretend he was busy fixing the sink.
He flooed okay. If you'd classify okay as getting chimney soot all over the knotted wooden floor and then knocking half of the floo powder into the knolls for good measure. And that was when he noticed Mr. Malfoy strolling through the hallway.
“Nonsense, you’d be serenading Mrs. Black.” Harry found it much more satisfying insulting Walburga when she couldn’t see him - and right now he didn’t want
“They’re different shades.” Hermione looked at Harry, horrified that she knew such a thing. While they were on a first name basis now, they were still by no means on friendly terms.
Draco stared longingly at the shelves lined with single malt whisky and rich red wine. "Vodka. Please."
"You've also got a stupid name, for the record." God, Draco needed to learn to shut up. "I also don't plan on marrying you."
“The more you talk the more you sound like a dictionary.” Harry levitated a plate of chips over from where they sat at the end of the bar under a hand drawn sign labelled:
“Well,” Draco pointed north to a cluster of stars. “That’s my namesake, Draco. See the way it dips down then up before ending in the tail. And that one-” he moved his finger so he was circling the zodiac. “In between the crab and the maiden is Leo, the lion.” He grinned, obviously impressed with himself. “Too bad there isn’t a constellation called Harry.”
Ron nodded, confused but supportive. But it was Draco who asked, “can you speak Mermish?” The tension was thick enough to put a knife through.
Draco groaned, throwing his hands up in defeat, wrapping his legs around the trunk momentarily before grabbing back onto the trunk. His blush was travelling down his neck, he could feel it heating his cheeks and nose, all too aware of the light shining between him and his nemesis.
“And the bookshelf?” He asked, almost in disbelief that he wasn’t about to be at the very least lightly scolded for such a mishap. Even if it wasn’t really a
Harry looked at him. Not through him, like he’d previously thought, but at him. He almost stopped breathing.
Draco ignored the thumping in his heart as he thought about the little ring box tucked at the back of his bedside cabinet, concentrating instead on the sizzling egg in the frying pan.
He thought he saw Hermione but when he looked back up there was just Draco, standing on the pavement - alone.
“I I also didn’t move your bookshelves. I knocked your bookshelves over.” He finally admitted, his hand jerking once, before deciding letting Draco play with it was more calming than running it anxiously through the tight ringlets of black hair at the nape of his neck.
Harry loved everything about his new life. He had a pet that followed him around and he swore sometimes acted like it understood him. He was constantly learning new things about magic and the world he now lived in, and no one hit him or yelled at him. He once accidentally broke a vase at the Malfoy’s house when he and Draco was playing, and Draco was very concerned when Harry had cowered against the wall and was sure that he was going to get in trouble. Narcissa had come and had a house elf fix the vase with magic, then had pulled Harry into her lap and explained that no one here would ever yell at him unless it was to warn him that he was about to do something dangerous, and that NO ONE would ever hit him again if she had anything to do about it. Draco had held Harry’s hand and agreed, although he did say that he might yell if he got excited or punch him in the shoulder, but that he would never hurt his best friend. Then they had hot chocolate, which made Harry feel much better.
“Minerva!” He called. A moment later, Minerva's head poked into the office.  Her normally tidy hair was mussed, and there was a spot of something that he suspected was leech juice on her cheek.
“Of course.” Severus took the tapestry to the wall opposite from the door and put it up on the wall with a sticking charm. Shadow chose that moment to saunter into the room, inspecting everything with little chirps of what sounded like approval. He jumped onto Harry's best and walked towards where Harry and Severus were standing on the other side. He didn't realize that he was being stalked by the tiny dragon figurine, who had abandoned it's ribbon for something more interesting.
Severus couldn't hold back a smirk at the cat's reaction to being attacked by a tiny, animated toy. Harry, on the other hand, burst into delighted laughter, and his childlike glee prompted Severus to let a larger, more open smile to grace his face. While Shadow and his attacker explored each other, Severus watched Harry, who's laughter was trailing into giggles.
Severus’s eyes opened, but he remained motionless, registering the room around him and trying to figure out why he was awake. He slowly sat up and looked around the room, not finding anything that would have wake him and not hearing any noises. Concerned about Harry having a nightmare, he got up and went to check Harry’s bed. His eyes widened when he got to Harry’s room and saw that it was empty, bedding rumpled and Shadow nowhere to be seen.
“I’ll leave immediately.” He knew that it would postpone his dinner, but it also meant that he wouldn’t have to spend it surrounded by the inane chatter of staff and students, and could order food in his quarters and eat in privacy. As he Flooed back to his own quarters, he let the nasty thoughts about James Potter and Sirius Black fade from his mind, and let the happy memories of his friendship with Lily come back to the forefront of his mind. There wasn't anything that he wouldn't do for the only child of his lost friend.
“It’s too late. You are a bad man, and you follow a bad man, and I won’t let you hurt my father, or Lucius, or Remus.” Rowle let go of Harry so he could swipe at one of the snakes with his knife, and pull out his wand with the other. Harry stepped away from him and turned to face him. Rowle looked him in the eyes for the first time, and saw ancient eyes in a little boy face. He felt a sharp pain in his leg, and looked to see that the black viper had reared up and bit him on the calf. He dropped his wand and pulled the black snake off his leg, only to have one of the grey and black vipers bite him on the hand. Rowle dropped to his knees as pain shot through his leg and arm. Harry watched emotionless, and Severus came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. Lucius came up to stand beside Severus, and Remus did the same on the other side.
“Then you will go.” Severus was very pleased that just in the past few months Harry had worked through his fears about being struck. They continued on their way to dinner, and once there Severus informed Lucius and Narcissa that he and Harry would be more than happy to attend the Winter holiday party. Draco was overjoyed, and started talking about all the people that he was going to introduce Harry to. Lucius and Severus exchanged looks indicating that they were going to have to have a conversation before the party.
By the time Severus was done explaining, he was almost hoarse. Remus was sitting again, his elbows perched on the arms of the chair and his clasped hands in front of his mouth. He seemed deep in thought. After an indeterminate length of time, Remus finally spoke.
Severus felt his stomach drop at the thought of letting the monster that almost ate him while he was a student anywhere near his son. He focused on keeping his occlumency shields in place and his mask over his expression, so the only outward sign from him was a sneer.
“Alright, Severus, what else? What other surprises does young Harry have for us?” Narcissa said as she served herself a serving of scotch. Severus sighed.
“Remus, thank you for your help. You are more than welcome to return to your bed. It’s VERY late.” Remus understood that Severus was trying to get rid of him, and accepted that Severus was still keeping him at a distance from Harry for the moment. He knew that building trust was going to take time, especially with Severus. Remus excused himself and left, repressing the urge to linger and listen to what Severus and Harry were discussing. If he was going to make Severus trust him, he was going to have to act like he could be trusted.
“Yeah, that would be very helpful. I am going to take Severus and Harry back to the Manor, make sure Narcissa and Draco know they are okay. I will meet you at the gates once I take down the wards.” Remus nodded, and Lucius went to help Severus up and take him back to the manor. Remus watched the serpents move back towards the hedge.
“Please, don't be upset. Draco is rather spoiled by his parents, and he has to learn that not everyone is going to give him whatever he wants. It will be good for him.” Harry nodded and chewed on his lower lip. He hoped that the little boy wasn't as mean as Dudley. Severus moved closer to Harry and put his arm around the young boy. “Time for bed, Harry.”
“That’s fine. I was just wanting to play a game, and we needed 4 people. We can play tomorrow.” Theo and Blaise started to describe the game that they wanted to play, which had a floating ball and sounded complicated. Harry said so, and Draco told him that it made more sense when you were playing.
“His thought is that Lupin was close to Harry’s parents, and the connection will be good for Harry. And with Lupin sequestered on the full moon and the werewolf under the influence of the Wolfsbane Potion…” Severus’s analytical mind kicked into high gear when he mentioned the potion. The Wolfsbane potion was poisonous, with large amounts of aconite that was made safe for the werewolf to drink by the properties of the other ingredients. Could the same thing be possible with the part of the Dark Lord’s soul that was attached to Harry? He realized that he may have taken the right tone with Lupin by not being overly antagonistic.
The rest of the week went smoothly, with all the midterm testing the children kept mostly out of trouble. That was until Thursday evening, when the peace that had mostly become normal for the Snape family was broken spectacularly.
Harry woke up, but this morning he remembered everything that had happened the past two days. He was at a place called Hogwarts, and he had a new father, and his own room, and he never had to see Dudley or his aunt and uncle ever again. Harry jumped out of bed, then turned and carefully made his bed. Once it was all neat, he went to the doorway of his room.
There was a knock on his door. Surprised, Remus set his tea down and went to open the door. He was even more surprised to find Severus standing there with a serious, but not malicious look on his face.
It wasn't very long before the first guests arrived. A beautiful woman with dark skin came it, shortly followed by a little boy around Draco and Harry's age. Draco immediately pulled the little boy over to the corner that had been assigned to the children, while Severus, Lucius, and Narcissa greeted Lady Zabini. Shortly thereafter, Theodore Nott and his father Cornelius came in. Once again, Draco came over, politely address the elder Nott, and then lead Theodore over to where the children were gathering. This became a pattern as the Parkinsons,  Greenglass, Goyle, and Crabbe families came in. The children were all gathered in their corner, and the adults mingled throughout the rest of the ballroom. More adults came in, including many of the Dark Lord's followers and high up Ministry donors and officials.
“That’s very smart and fair, Father. Can I bring Shadow and Nala?” Severus raised an eyebrow. Harry pointed at the Occamy.
Harry was sitting on the couch waiting for his check up. He looked cleaner than the last time she saw him and was wearing clothing that actually fit him. Poppy noticed that his eyes were red, as if he had been crying, but he looked a great deal better overall. Poppy's eyes welled up as she saw how well Severus was taking care of his new son. But she shook the tears from her eyes and got down to business.
“Hey, let's go set your things up in your room.” Harry and Severus gathered up the bags and took them into Harry's room. The books and games went onto the bookshelves, and most of the toys that Severus picked out went into a chest at the end of Harry's bed. The dragon figurine went on Harry's bedside table, and the large stuffed dragon went onto Harry's bed.
“It was an accident, Uncle Vernon, I swear!” Harry’s uncle wasn’t interested in his excuses, and slammed his fist into the side of Harry’s head. Harry whimpered again, and realized that he was losing control of his bladder after holding it from so long. It only took a moment for Vernon to realize what was going on, and his face got even redder as it contorted in fury.
“You are at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Harry’s eyes grew wide and he started to shake his head back and forth in denial of what he heard.
Minutes later, hissing came from the ground to the left of the group. From under one of the hedges came an all-black viper, followed by 6 smaller grey and black vipers. They quickly moved towards Harry and Rowle. Rowle tried to back away from the advancing snakes, but ended up backed against the wards with nowhere to go. He realized then that the hissing was coming from Harry.
“I won't get in trouble for asking questions?” Harry asked, just as quietly as his first response. Lucius and Narcissa both smiled.
Severus picked Harry up and started walking towards Magical Menagerie. Moments later, they stepping into a dimly lit shop filled with the sounds and smells of assorted animals. The shop boy behind the counter smiled at the two of them.
“Severus Tobias Snape, do you swear on your blood and your magic to take Harry James Potter as your son? To protect and guide him in the ways of magic and life?” Severus stood tall to his impressive height.
“Why was he returned?” Severus replied, barely containing his sneer.  The young man realized that he had said the wrong thing, changed his approach in hopes that he could make the sale.
“Your mother and I lived a couple of houses away from each other as children. The rest of your mother's family didn't have magic, but your mother did. We met one day at a park, and I saw her perform accidental magic. Since my mother was a witch, I already knew about magic. I told your mother, and we became friends very quickly. It gave her someone to hang out with that wasn't your aunt, since they didn't get a long, and it gave me someone to spend time with away from my Muggle father, who was not a nice person. A lot like your Uncle Vernon, actually.” Harry completely understood, and scooted a little closer to his father. He liked feeling like Severus understood.
“The first thing that I am going to do is make sure that you are not alone all day. Tippy!” There was a pop, which made Harry jump in surprise, and a small creature about the same size as Harry appeared and promptly bowed to the two of them.
“I apologize for the lateness of the hour, but may I come through? I wish to discuss something with you both.” Narcissa and Lucius looked at each other and shared a silent conversation, wondering what was so important that Severus would want to talk face to face. They both nodded, and a moment later Severus stepped through. He wandlessly spelled the lingering ash from his robes and took a seat on the wing backed chair next to the hearth. Narcissa and Lucius took seats side by side on the adjoining love-seat.
The next few weeks fell into a pattern that was very satisfying for all involved. Harry went to the Malfoy’s house each weekday morning, on his own now, and continued his lessons and playing with Draco while Severus taught his Potion’s lessons. Part of each afternoon was dedicated to learning wandless magic with Lucius, who started Harry with meditation to help him concentrate and focus on his magic.
Severus took Harry home and offered him dessert. He liked that they had developed a tradition of talking about serious topics at the table together. Harry had just started eating his chocolate ice cream when Severus cleared his throat.
Severus remembered what his first winter holiday with the Malfoy family was like, and knew that Harry could very easily become overwhelmed. He made sure to check in with Harry regularly. But while Severus had been a rather severe and rather antisocial youth, Harry was quite empathetic and enjoyed being social. There were moments where Harry's eyes would go wide with wonder, and he genuinely seemed to enjoy the holiday games that Draco and Narcissa were teaching him and he loved helping with all the decorating and rituals. There was one thing that Severus needed to talk to Harry about, and it was fast approaching.
“We don't know. No one knows for sure if Arthur or Merlin will come back. All we have are stories. We also don't know if anyone will wield Excalibur again.” Harry nodded, and then turned to Draco. Draco thought for a moment.
“Harry, I need to bring something to your attention.” Harry, being the observant child that he was, noticed immediately Severus’s tone of voice and put his spoon down. His stomach was in knots all of a sudden. Was Severus going to tell him that he wasn’t able to keep him? That he was going to have to leave? He remembered some of his lessons with Narcissa about not jumping to conclusions and how sometimes things weren’t what they seemed, and focused on his father.
“Father, can I have him?” Harry's eyes were pleading, and his other hand stroked the back of the tiny dragon. A quiet rumble came from the dragon on Harry's palm, and Severus realized that it was purring. Severus blinked a couple of times in surprise. The animals and other animated figures in the shop were charmed to act like they would in real life, but they didn't have their own personalities. Most of the dragon figurines were standoffish and ferocious, and this one was curled up on his son's hand like a cat who had claimed his owner.
“Harry, I have something for you. It was given to me many years ago... by your mother. It's not really my style, but I thought you might like to put it up in here. Would you like to see it.” Harry sat up and dropped the ribbon he had been playing with the figurine with. The tiny dragon pounced on the ribbon and rolled, much the same way a crocodile would, catching the ribbon with teeth and claws, wrapping itself up and wiggling to try to get out once it realized that it was tangled. Harry absentmindedly untangled the figurine while watching Severus. Severus unrolled the tapestry, which was about as long as he was tall and about as wide as his arms would spread.
Thank you everyone who has left such wonderful messages. It's assisting with keeping me inspired and motivated to keep writing. I have plans, sooo many plans. I hope that everyone is enjoying, and please keep reading!
Severus gave a curt nod once he had Remus’s agreements, and then quickly left. He knew he was going to have to get used to being around the werewolf for testing, and because he was spending time with Harry, and because of the headmaster, but that didn’t mean that he had to like it. He felt a wave of exhaustion from holding up his occlumency for so long. He walked into his quarters, nodded at Tippy, and made his way to his bed.
What none of them noticed was the older man who maneuvered so that he could watch the small group. After about half an hour, the man noticed that Snape's new adopted son brushed his hair out of his face and noticed something on his forehead. His eyes grew big as he realized that Severus Snape had adopted the Dark Lord's greatest foe.
“Your... what? How do you not have a son last week, and have a son now?!? Uncle Sev, what is going on?!?” Draco stomped towards the couch and Harry, who scrambled back and away from him.
“Blow,” Severus ordered. Harry blew his nose, and Severus could see that he swallowed down the rest of his tears. Harry smiled weakly at Draco.
“Harry, I have a couple of questions before I am okay answering your new friend’s questions.” Severus sighed, then leaned up and put his elbows on his knees so his face was closer to Harry and the tiny serpent that was now curled around Harry’s forearm.
Severus and Harry walked into a store called JJ Jackstraps Famous Fun Factory. Harry had never seen so many toys, and he had certainly never been to a toy store in person. He had seen Dudley's toys, but they were mostly video games and toys related to those games. But this place... this place had to be the most magical place that he had ever seen!
“A pet already, Severus? I am impressed.” Narcissa moved further into the room and held her hand out for Shadow to sniff. He did, and then gently licked one of her fingers before going back to purring. Narcissa smiled at the cat, then turned her attention to Harry. He was tiny for his age, even smaller than Draco who was rather petite. And so shy. Narcissa knew that if Harry and Draco became friends that Draco would be the one who took the lead.
What worried him was Harry, and how he would react to what happened. Given the kind of unbelievable power that was flowing through him, it was possible that he wouldn’t remember anything about Rowle’s death. But it was also possible that he remembered everything, and he didn’t know how someone as young as Harry would deal with having caused someone’s death. Remus worried over it for a while as he finished his tea and then crawled into bed. He didn’t know how he was going to convince Severus to let him spend more time around Harry. Maybe he should reach out to Hogwarts and see if there was a teaching position available.
Severus noted that while Harry had an obviously hungry look on his face, he didn't pick up a fork and start eating. Making a mental note on the list of things to work with Harry on, he remarked “Please, Harry, eat. You don't have to wait for me to say it's okay.” Harry picked up his fork and began to eat slowly, making sure that he was being neat.
“Yes, sometimes people make mistakes. Sometimes the mistakes are bigger, sometimes smaller, but it’s important to learn from our mistakes. I learned that bullying is never okay.” Harry nodded again, then a different look came into his eyes. He seemed to have figured out whatever it was about Remus that he wanted to.
Despite his outward reaction to Albus’ request for him to check on Harry, Severus desperately wanted to protect on the child of his best friend. Unbeknownst to Albus or James Potter, Severus and Lily had mended fences and had quietly been in communication up until she had been killed. Severus hadn’t been willing to put her in danger, and after she had been killed he felt the same way about her son which was the only reason that he had accepted Albus sending Harry to live with Pentunia. Seeing him now, sleeping out in the October cold, bruised and covered in urine, he felt an anger that he didn’t think was possible. He knew that he had to remove the child from here immediately for his own safety.
“Master Snape!” Tippy called him quietly from the door of Harry's room. Severus ran to the door, worried that Harry was hurt. Severus looked around the room, but didn't see him. He looked back at Tippy, who gestured towards the wardrobe. As Severus moved closer towards the wardrobe, he heard a muffled sob coming from inside. Severus's heart broke, hearing Harry cry like that. But this time, he knew he could help.
“Draco, send Ari if you or Harry need anything! I'll send Rose when lunch is ready!” Draco and Harry were already out the door. Severus sat down on the abandoned couch with a sigh. Narcissa sat beside him. “Severus, how are you doing?” Severus looked at her, then shook his head. Severus described how Harry had been adjusting, the flinching and being afraid of having things taken away from him. Narcissa was patting his hand as he moved on to talking about how worried he was for the future and making sure that Harry was safe.
“Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon said that they died in a car crash, and that my dad was useless and a freak and didn't work.” Severus sighed deeply to control his anger, and he noticed that Harry tensed.
Albus looked up from his seat at Severus’ arrival. “Ah, there you are, my lad. I have a small favor to ask of you. It seems that young Harry might be in some sort of distress. I informed Petunia when she took Harry that she wouldn’t be bothered by anyone from our world, but we should check on Harry just to confirm that nothing untoward is happening. Since you are familiar with the Muggle world, I thought it would be best for you to investigate. Subtly, of course.”
“Oof! Who is that! Whatever student is there better drop the spell immediately, or I shall have to take points! You know spells aren’t allowed in the corridors!” Minerva McGonagall wasn’t going to mince words with rule breakers. Severus sighed, and then grinned to himself. Having Minerva in his corner when dealing with the Headmaster would make keeping Harry with him much easier.  He quickly dropped the charm.
“I take it the house elves have been sharing the Christmas chocolate already?” Draco nodded. Harry, always more sedate than Draco, went to Severus, who pulled him up onto his lap. He looked shyly at Remus.
“Master Harry, Tippy will be taking the dishes to the kitchen to be cleaned.” Tippy stepped around Harry and gathered the dishes together. “Tippy will be back around lunch time with more food.” She popped out of the room with the dirty dishes, and Harry looked around the room, lost for a moment in being alone and not being afraid for the first time. He chewed on his lower lip, trying to get up the courage to do one of the things that Sev... no, his Father had suggested.
“It tickles!” Poppy blinked and glanced at Severus. Diagnostic spells were the gentlest of all charms, just by their nature, and Harry should not have been able to feel them at all. Severus was beginning to think that he was going to have to start training Harry to control his magic sooner rather than later.
“I know, Harry. He’s trapped here, he’s not going to be able to take you anywhere.” Hearing that, Rowle sneered.
“Severus! Thank you for indulging me! How is young Harry adapting to being surrounded by magic? Lemon drop?” Severus reinforced his mental shields and shook his head in the negative.
Severus explained to Remus that part of taking care of Harry was letting Severus research more in depth the Wolfsbane Potion that he would be making. This meant that Severus would be checking in with Remus before and after the full moon, and possibly making adjustments. Remus was skeptical, but willing to do anything for Harry. Remus found that Harry seemed to be the pivot point of their tentative peace. That, and how royally pissed at Albus they both were. Remus was aghast at how Albus was willing to manipulate and sacrifice Harry, and Remus assured Severus that any loyalty that he had for Albus Dumbledore had been quickly transferred to Harry once he had a better idea of what was going on.
After his bath, Harry got dressed in some very nice fitting clothes. The black pants and green sweater were very soft. It was the best bath ever, in Harry's opinion.  Severus and Harry went back to the table to get Harry some breakfast.
“Father, what am I going to be learning at Draco's house tomorrow?” Severus set the book on the bookshelf.
“Harry, didn't you understand when I was talking about the house elves? They clean the rooms and the dishes and do the laundry. You aren't going to have to clean. I was you to learn how to play, and to draw, and figure out how to be a little boy.” Harry stopped eating and started chewing on his lower lip again.
“Good, good. I have come up with a marvelous idea to help him adjust to living in the wizarding world again. I am going to bring Remus Lupin to the school as a teaching assistant. To Professor Binns, as a matter of fact, in hopes of assisting him to move on. Remus was a close friend to the Potters, and I am sure they would want him in their son’s life. I am sure that the connection to his parents will help Harry heal. And Remus can teach him all about the magical world.”
The book hit the opposite wall, and bounced back to run into a lamp and knock it to the floor with a crash. It bounced off the couch and headed towards Harry. Harry ducked and screamed, grabbed his blanket off the couch, and ran.
“Do you remember how I told you that your parents died protecting you, and that they were very brave?” Harry nodded. Severus sighed again. This wasn't a conversation he thought that he would have to have so soon. “They... they were killed by a man. A very evil man. And the story about that evil man is very complicated. But that man was very powerful, and very charismatic...” Harry gave him a questioning look. Severus tried to think of an easier way to explain the Dark Lord to a 6 year old. “The man was very good at talking to people and getting them to believe what he said, even when what he said was very bad or lies. For a while, Lucius believed the things that man said. But that man started hurting people, and Lucius knew that following the man would put his family in danger. So he stopped following the bad man, but some of the things that Lucius believes are still true. I wouldn't say that he doesn't like you, I would say that he is... worried about protecting his family.”
“Severus? I was wondering when we would hear from you. Draco was quite overwrought when he came back from your quarters, but he wouldn't say why. I didn't think that he was that upset over a kitten that he found in the gardens.” Lucius stepped into the room, closely followed by Narcissa. They both looked impeccable, as they always did.
Without a second thought, Severus Disapparated back to Hogwarts, not realizing that Harry had woken at all.
“I will make sure that we get it in the morning.” Harry smiled shakily and laid down, snapping his fingers to turn the lamp off. Severus closed the door most of the way, but left it open enough to let a small amount of light into Harry's room and so that he could hear if Harry needed him.
Harry was writhing around on the center of the bed. His face was red and he was shrieking almost without stopping for breath. Severus moved to the side of the bed to comfort and sooth Harry back into sleep when he noticed something. The scar on Harry's head was angry, red, and gaping as if it was a fresh wound. Severus hesitated to touch Harry, not sure what effect it would have on Harry. He wasn't sure what he was witnessing, but he was more convinced now that the Dark Lord wasn't gone than ever before.
“I got him, Lily. He's my boy now, and I am going to make sure he's okay. Your sister... I don't know how she could do that, but she will never hurt him again. I swear it.”
“Lucius, Draco, please say hello to Cousin Harry. Severus, you know of course.” Lucius stood up and walked towards Harry. Harry shrank towards Narcissa, cautious of him even though he was married to Narcissa.
“Oh, love. The way your cousin acted, and his friends… that was never your fault. They were bullies, and being mean made them feel stronger. Draco, Blaise, and Theo just want to be friends with you, they don’t want to bully you.” Harry’s eyes filled with tears.
“Thank you, so much.” He looked at it, and realized that it had been both cleaned and mended. Severus smiled back.
As the two of them sat down and started eating, Severus asked Harry if he had any questions about the things that he had seen around the wizarding world so far. Harry asked a couple of questions regarding the moving pictures and posters, and if he would be able to see Severus making potions at some point. Severus offered to make something the following morning that Harry could watch, which made Harry smile and chew his food happily. They continued to eat, and after a few minutes Harry spoke up again.
The first thing that Severus did once he was sure that Harry was asleep was to call Poppy and make sure that the blanket that Harry had when he was found was safe. He imparted the importance to Poppy, and she reassured him that she would make sure that it was delivered to his quarters. The second thing he did was Floo call Malfoy Manor.
“Moving slow won’t spare you having to go outside, you little shite!” Vernon cuffed Harry on the side of his head again, and then grabbed him by the hair. “I’m sick of your stink. Petunia will have to deal with your mess.” Despite the pain in his side and his head, Harry kept a tight hold on his blanket. Since he was going to have to sleep outside, he didn’t want to drop it and not have any covering. Even if the blanket smelled like urine, it was better than nothing. Pulling Harry by his hair, Vernon dragged the limp boy to the back door, opened it, and tossed Harry into the back yard. “We will see how we are feeling tomorrow, if we let you come back in.” He shut the door and threw the lock. Heaven forbid the nasty little thing try to creep back in while they were sleeping. Petunia, sensitive to the cleanliness of her house, had already dealt with the mess in the hallway; one might never have known anything happened.
“These are yours. The journal is for drawing in, or writing down your feelings. The colored pencils can be used to color whatever you like. I prefer to use watercolor paints, but those are a little bit harder to work with.” Harry took the book and pencils reverently, as they were the first things that he had ever had that were just his. “These books have pictures of animals and places around the Wizarding World. I thought they would keep you occupied until I get back.”
“Minerva, I have an urgent situation with Harry. Can you come through and watch my second years while I investigate. You are more than welcome to dismiss them if need be.” Minerva's head came into view.
Severus looked at the clock on the mantle. He knew it was time to head to lessons, but he didn't want to. He walked over to the bookshelves that lined the living room and pulled out three books. They were a little advanced for a 6 year old, but they had lots of pictures of animals and places around the world, and he hoped that they would keep Harry occupied for the afternoon. He grabbed a journal with blank pages and a box of colored pencils that he had received as a gift but never used. He brought them over to the table and set them in front of Harry with a pencil sharpener. Harry blinked at them and then up at Severus.
“Your father had a large inheritance from his family and didn't need to work, but he did. He was an Auror, which is kind of like a Muggle police officer. Your mother was very smart, and was going to be a teacher, but she decided when you came along to be a stay at home mom until you got a little older.” Harry blinked back tears, already loving them and wishing that he could have met them.
“Last, did you speak with Madam Pomfrey?” Remus sighed and went back over to his chair. He sat, and conjured a chair similar for Severus to sit in. He gestured towards it while he picked up his tea.
Severus was just getting ready to go to bed himself when he heard a cry from the other room, and as he made his way to Harry's room it grew into a shriek. Severus started running to get to Harry. He had suspected that Harry was going to have nightmares, but what he saw...
“I understand why you might want to bring her with you. Let me check with Lucius and Narcissa, and see if they are okay with her coming. I know Draco would love to meet her.” Severus stood up. “Thank you Remus. For keeping him.” Remus blinked. There hadn’t been a trace of sarcasm in his comment. Or mocking. Or… anything. Just gratitude.
“I recognize that look. It was the same look that Narcissa and I had when we realized that the Dark Lord was a threat to Draco. That is what happens when you feel protective for your child. And we will figure out what we need to do to protect Harry. I do believe that part of why he is so powerful has to do with the connection to the Dark Lord. And there may be other things that crop up, just so you are forewarned.” Severus nodded.
“I did! Did you have a good day?” Harry nodded. Severus smiled. “Since it is the beginning of the winter holidays, how would you feel about possibly staying the night here with Draco? Should his parents say it is okay?” Harry grinned and ran back towards Draco, whispering in his ear. Draco immediately stopped jumping around to listen to Harry, and then ran up to his mother.
“Yes, Harry?” Harry hadn't laid down yet, and was fidgeting and tracing the patterns on his new blanket.
“That was what he said. “I, Harry, the Promised King, do judge you, Rowle, as following the Shadowed Path.” Both Severus and Lucius nodded. That sight was burned into their memories. Narcissa excused herself, leaving Severus and Lucius to their own devices.
“Quite. I was hoping that you would be up to having us for introductions and lunch.” Narcissa smiled, delighted that her introductions would not be further postponed.
Severus opened the door of the carrier, and the cat stepped out and stretched. He was thin and lanky, showing that he had a lot of growing to do by the size of his paws and ears. He mewled at Severus and touched his hand with a soft paw before jumping off the table and exploring the room with his tail like a flag over his back.
“Do you hate my father?” Remus blinked in surprise. He briefly wondered if Severus had to field the unexpected questions all the time.
Lucius chose a deep green dress robe with subtle embroidery. Severus decided that it was close enough to black, and didn't put up a fuss. Lucius was dressed in a deep grey dress robe that matched his eyes, and knew that it would compliment whatever Narcissa wore. Somehow, they always seemed to match each other. Narcissa shortly brought the boys down, and Severus noticed that while Draco, Narcissa and Lucius all matched in various shades of grey, Harry was dressed in green robes that matches well with Severus. Severus smiled at Harry, who was swishing his robes back and forth and not paying attention. Lucius and Narcissa smiled down at him as well, and Draco reached out and took his hand as they made their way to the grand ballroom.
“Are you ready, Harry?” Harry nodded, excited and scared at witnessing magic for the first time. Minerva moved up so that she was standing next to Severus, forming a triangle between the three of them. She pulled her wand out of her sleeve, and started the ritual with a wave.
“I can help teach you how to ride, and you can come over and eat candies and pastries and hot chocolate and spend the night and we can play all the games, and I can introduce you to Theo and Pansy and Blaise and Crabbe and Goyle and we can have camp outs in the garden and we can see if anything else reacts like the little toys. Do you have any other surprises?” Harry just followed, wide-eyed, and occasionally looked back at his father in wonder. Did Draco ever breathe?
“The headmaster, who you have not met, has decided that you need a connection to your parents. One of your parent’s closest friends, Remus Lupin, has come to be a teaching assistant to one of the other professors. The headmaster would like you to spend one day a week with Mr. Lupin learning more about the Wizarding World from his point of view and to learn more about your parents. Do you think that you would be okay with that?” Harry blinked at Severus a couple of times, registering the look on Severus’s face and how tense he was while he was talking about this.
The days flew by quickly, and the day of the gala arrived The house elves were making sure that all of the final decorations were in place and everything that was needed for the feast was prepared, and Narcissa took on the task of making sure that the boys were dressed and looking their best. Severus allowed Lucius to assist with making sure that he was dressed well, as he decided against wearing his usual black dress robes.
“Harry was severely abused by his relatives, and tends to be very timid around new people. I will discuss with him when he would like to meet you, since the Headmaster has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t have a choice in the matter.” Lupin grew pale for a moment when Severus said that Harry had been abused, then hot color began to flood his cheeks.
“Malfoy Manor.” Draco said, a hiccup in his voice. The fire turned green, and he stepped through and disappeared. Harry felt bad. Even though the little boy had sounded like Dudley, he didn't mean to make him cry.
“Well, Harry, I am happy to tell you that are just fine, no lingering injuries. Are you ready to have your eyes checked?” Harry nodded again. Poppy ran her wand around his head, and then in front of his eyes.  “Follow the bouncing light, Harry.” A shining ball of blue light appeared and began to dance around the room. Harry followed the light with his eyes. A couple of moments later, glowing writing appeared in front of Poppy, and Severus leaned over to read what it said.
“Draco!” Severus's sharp tone of voice immediately made Draco stop in his tracks and turn to his godfather. “You will immediately return home. I will be speaking with your parents about Harry shortly, and it will be up to them to tell you, if they wish.” Draco was so confused. Severus had NEVER spoken to him like this. Draco always got to come first with his Uncle Sev, and he didn't know what to do. Blinking back tears, he turned back towards the fireplace and grabbed a handful of Floo powder from the side table next to the fireplace.
“Are you KIDDING me, Mr. Montague!! After 6 FULL years in my class, you cannot manage to keep your cauldron from boiling over? Have your eyes fallen out of your head, that you would miss the color change happening less than a foot from your face? LEAVE! Get out of my classroom, and 20 points from Gryffindor!” The focus of his wrath blinked at him for less than a moment before quickly gathering his things and fleeing the classroom. Severus Vanished the cauldron and looked around the room. “Does anyone else want to do something foolish with their potions today?” The entirety of the class shook their heads in the negative and focused their attention on their work.
“Harry, would it be okay if I called for help? I am afraid that I am at a bit of a loss with what to do.” Harry chewed on his lower lip, but nodded.
“So mote it be, by the Ancient Laws. Alligatus Magicae!” The gold and silver light swirled together faster and faster until, in a flash of bright light, they disappeared. Minerva blew out a deep breath. She had been around children for almost her entire life, and she had never seen such strong magic in such a small child.
“Of course! We would be delighted! Can we plan for around one?” Severus nodded, and bid Narcissa good evening. Severus sat back on one of the wing back chairs and called for Tippy to bring him a glass of his favorite wine. It had been a long day, and now that Harry was starting to get a little comfortable Severus was starting to worry. He was worrying about everything. The Dark Lord returning, Harry and Draco's impending introductions, Harry's recovery from his trauma.  Severus was starting to realized that part of being a parent was going to be worrying to the point of exhaustion.
By the time he emerged from the Potions lab, it had been several hours. Draco and Harry were playing in the playroom, and Severus went there to gather Harry. He reassured Draco that they would be back in a couple hours for dinner for Christmas Eve dinner, and Severus and Harry flooed back to Hogwarts. Knowing that it would be an easy way for Remus to spend time with Harry, Severus sat Harry down. Harry’s Occamy friend and Shadow came out and sat on the floor next to them.
“This is your other family, the Potters. This is James Potter's family.” He showed Harry that he was also at the bottom of this family tree. He showed Harry the pictures of his mother and father, and Harry stared without blinking, drinking in the first sight of the parents who he had never met.
Lucius and Narcissa sent Draco off to make his plans for his adventures with Harry after the Snape family left. Narcissa looked at her husband.
Severus moved around to the back of the house silently, using long honed skills as a spy. He peered in the back window and watched the family eating dinner for a moment, tilting his head back and forth as he processed what he was watching. The horse-faced woman he remembered as a teen was obviously Petunia, and she now had a pinched look to her face that did not improve her appearance. Sitting across from her was a grossly overweight man with a large mustache, obviously her husband. Sitting in between them was an equally overweight child, about 6 years old, with pale blond hair and a nasty expression on his face as he demanded that his mum put more food on his plate. Severus narrowed his eyes at the scene. Where was Harry?
“Thank you for listening.” Narcissa pursed her lips for just a moment before making a quick decision.
“Shows what you know. This is my ticket out of here.” Rowle pulled a knife from somewhere and held it against Harry’s throat. All three men stopped in their tracks. Severus could see the tear tracks on Harry’s face, and how Rowle was holding him by his hair, and the knife at Harry’s throat, and felt a rage like he had never felt before. He had been angry at the Dark Lord when he killed Lily, but it was matched measure for measure with pain and sorrow. There was no pain and sorrow here, only rage for the monster who put their hands on his son.
“I… I don’t want to say something and make them not like me anymore. Like my cousin at my uncle’s, and his friends. They didn’t like me. And they were mean to me. I thought it might have been my fault, and I didn’t want the same thing to happen here.” Narcissa knelt down and gathered Harry into a hug.
“He's fine. He's just startled, one of my books got a little excited.” Looking at Minerva, Severus figured out that he might have an idea of a way to give Harry a safe place as well as a place where Severus could find him. But he wanted to work on it a little bit first.
Maybe it was good that Harry was going to be taken care of by Uncle Severus. Uncle Severus was the smartest and scariest Slytherin other than his father. He would make sure that no one was mean to Harry, and that no one scared him. Maybe...
“Tippy, would you please start putting the quarters back together?” Tippy nodded  and started repairing items and putting them back in their spaces. Severus went to the Floo and threw some powder in the fireplace.
The two of them were looking at the other families in the book when the fire in the fireplace turned bright green and a small, blond haired boy came running through.
“The gargoyle said that it wasn’t time for me to meet Dumbledore yet, so I think we are going to be fine. We are almost there.” Severus gave Harry a weak smile as Harry led Severus to the gargoyle at the bottom of Dumbledore’s tower.
Narcissa swept in, looking perfect as always. Since they had all been taking their lessons seriously (and Lucius and Severus had them ingrained) everyone stood when she came in the room, but she quickly waved them off. She walked over to Lucius and pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek.
The creature was like nothing that Harry had ever seen before. It had large, bright blue eyes and enormous ears that wiggled independently of each other.  It's loose skin and long, pointed nose kind of liked like an old man, and it appeared to be wearing a tea towel, wrapped around itself like a dress.
“Congratulations, Severus. It's a boy.” Severus scowled at her, and Minerva suppressed a chuckle. “I will leave you to get better acquainted.” She slipped her wand back up her sleeve and made her way out of the infirmary. Severus looked towards Poppy.
“Um, excuse me,” He asked the black haired man, as he was closest. “How does everyone know my name?” Severus looked at Poppy, who shrugged and gave him a look  that indicated that she was going to let him explain.
