“And if not, Snape would have kicked me out. There probably would’ve been more “Harry Potter is the Dark Lord reborn”-theories that weren’t in
Harry didn’t see Draco on the way from the castle to the gates either. They did pass Hagrid, who was managing the thestrals and helping the younger students with their luggage. Harry, Ron and Hermione had been by his hut for tea the day before and had said their goodbyes then, so they only waved to him before they climbed into their own carriage.
“He can’t want revenge, Harry saved his life. And I don’t think Malfoy was all that fond of Voldemort…”
Anyway, it wasn't worth talking about. Potter didn't matter. What were the chances even that Draco would ever run into him again? He had his life carefully structured by now so that he hardly ever needed to pass into magic London. He moved on. He went to work. He bought groceries and went drinking at muggle pubs with his muggle colleagues. Irie never brought up the incident with the Dark Mark again - she was a good person in that sense. He was sure she would have been a Slytherin if she had gone to Hogwarts.
to do, you’re apologizing and begging for their approval and trying to be one of them. And I’m not. I can’t go around hating myself for it just because they tell me to, but I also can’t defend myself if you’re right there next to me condemning everything we did. They don’t like me. I’m not
“Your sleeves,” he said, gesturing to Draco as he repeated the words with less certainty this time, as if he had just realized that Draco might be showing off the mark on purpose.
“This one,” she said. “Malfoy had that theory that Azkaban was actually affecting all of Britain because the evil had
"He's a fucking peacock, Harry. He probably spent that half year getting over his pride enough to actually talk to you. Don't waste your energy on him. You don't owe him anything and you went to see him anyway. We've done more than enough for that little shit already."
It was another thing he hadn't thought about in months, had actually totally forgotten until seeing Malfoy's face had triggered the memory. Ron looked surprised.
His eyes were puffed from sleep and his hair was an impossible mess. The rough upholstery had left a pattern on his cheek and even though the cheap T-shirt hadn’t creased like Draco’s shirt had, it had slid up pretty far to reveal the dark skin of Potter’s abdomen. On top of that, his socks didn’t match. Draco was pretty sure one of them had snitches on it. Potter looked in every way like someone who had been out of bed all night, slept on a couch somewhere he wasn’t supposed to
"There you go again," Malfoy sighed with exasperation. "Being perfectly humble. Bragging a little bit doesn't
They ended up in Ginny’s room, where Luna claimed the record player and refused to give it up for the rest of the night. They passed bottles of ginger and strawberry mead around. There wasn’t a lot of room for dancing, but that only meant the party felt bigger than it actually was. Hermione had brought some of her parent’s old records with her and Luna quickly abandoned all wizards’ music for muggle music from the 70’s and 80’s. She traced the lightning bolt over David Bowie’s face with her fingers and grinned at Harry. It was hard to tell if she was drunk or not, but she had claimed one of the bottles for herself and was gingerly sipping it while she watched them, bobbing her head to the music. The rest of them were slowly but steadily getting pissed. At one point Ginny and Hermione collapsed on the bed laughing hysterically, and no one could figure out what the joke was, since they didn’t have the breath to explain. Ron pulled Hermione back to her feet and they were dancing again. Ginny grabbed Harry’s hand, still grinning. He was vaguely aware that he was probably a terrible dancer, but Neville was too and it couldn’t have mattered less.
They don’t need to talk. At this point, there is nothing to say. Potter has his girlfriend and his mission, he doesn’t want revenge and Draco isn’t asking for forgiveness. Potter doesn’t want him here, nobody wants him here, but that’s how it has to be. It’s temporary. And if Potter would just leave him alone, they should be able to manage fine. Instead he is here again, in Draco’s space, with his stupid hair and his stupid face and his stupid muggle clothes.
“I know,” Draco says lightly, as if it makes no difference to him whether Harry wants to kiss him or not.
He unhooked the end of the rope that closed it off, then fastened it behind him. The library at Hogwarts held one of the most extensive collections of magical texts in all of Britain, so of course there were quite a few books there that weren’t fit for children, and the restricted section was pretty big.
“I can tell. And if you want my advice, I think you should talk to him. People don’t do that nearly as much as they should, and it almost always helps.”
“I’ll see you after the holidays,” said Potter when they stood inside the Entrance Hall, just before they split up.
Potter nodded as well. He looked away. Draco crossed his arms. The silence stretched out between them. Draco searched his mind for something to say, but he couldn’t even think of any snide remarks that might have made it feel like a normal interaction between him and Potter.
At first all Harry feels is shame. He can’t look at Ron or Hermione or any of the other Gryffindors for the entire next day – no one notices, he’s been angry all year anyway. He can’t stop looking for Draco either, whenever they’re in the same room – in class or in the great hall – he can’t seem to relax until he has spotted him. Draco catches him looking a couple of times and smirks.
Three weeks passed and Draco’s status in Slytherin didn’t improve. Zabini acted like he was air and made a point of not looking at him when they passed each other in the hallways. He ate his meals with Tracey Davis and Millicent Bulstrode when Pansy sat with them, or with Theodore Nott when she didn’t. But he had never really liked Pansy’s friends and he had a hard time keeping up a conversation with Nott, so after a while he just spent most of his time on his own. He became a regular in the library, where his solitude was less noticeable. He wrote two more letters to his mother, but didn’t send them.
“Look, I get that you hate me, alright?” he says, voice pulled tight as a wire. “You have made that abundantly clear, and I’m not asking you to change that. You have every reason to hate me. I’m just saying that I can’t do this with you, and you pretending that you
He passed her the newspaper, ignoring the stares he knew he was getting from every Slytherin at the table.
Draco grinned and Potter’s face split into a smile that sent a jolt through him. He had almost forgotten that they could be like this around each other – relaxed, easy, just talking. It felt like one of their flying trips, except with the exhilaration of flight replaced by the calm and warmth of the room that was turning golden as the sun sank and more light filtered through the window. He could see the shadows of the mullions drawing dark patterns across Potter’s skin. He looked so relaxed as he stood there in his crumpled shirt, watching Draco. He didn’t look like Harry Potter, saviour of the world, he just looked like a boy with a nice smile and terribly messy hair, and Draco thought how nice it would be if it could always be like that.
They walked down the path where the thestrals pulled the carriages to the school on the first day after the summer holidays. Draco thought he had understood where the Gryffindors wanted them to meet, but no one was waiting for them. He looked back towards the castle.
He didn’t say anything. She wiped at the tears, not looking at him, her mouth stretched in an apologetic grin.
“It’s not like I don’t like him,” he said. “I mean, I don’t but... It was mostly that I didn’t trust him, you know? I just didn’t get why you wanted to bring him along, that’s all, it seemed bloody suspicious to me. But if you like him, that’s… you’re my best mate, Harry, it’s not like I won’t give him a chance.”
He was less annoyed by the insult than he thought he would have been, but there seemed to be surprisingly little spite in the statement. Besides, much as he hated admitting that there was anything Malfoy was better at than him, it was probably true.
Potter was scowling at him. Behind him, Draco could make out Granger watching them. He couldn't imagine she would approve of Potter accosting him like this and he really wished she had done a better job of holding him back.
“Potter, you will be brewing your skelegro-potion again, so you can set up your cauldron anywhere you like. Everything you’ll need is already on the table. Malfoy, if you’ll come with me.”
He turned to Hermione: “It’s not like you weren’t pissed when you found out I’d been flying with him – I was just talking to him then, I didn’t even like him, and you said he was emotionally amputated, that he wasn’t worth forgiving-“
“I am. I really want to, I just can’t decide where to go. It’s a bit difficult, since I can’t really put down Hogwarts as previous education on my application, and I’ll have to translate the grades too. It’ll probably be hard to make it fit with further wizarding education as well.“
It was a strange thing to hear him say. Because the tone was so familiar, so similar to the endless, pampered whining Harry had had to endure when they were at Hogwarts together, except it was ironic and self-deprecating and almost… well, it was kind of funny.
In the evening he received a letter from his mother in which she asked him to come home for the funeral.
At first, he'd moved in with Pansy at Parkinson Park. Of course, that hadn't been a permanent solution, but she'd been glad to have him, and talking to her had been a bit easier than talking to his mother. And at some point during that time, the idea had taken shape. The perfect solution.
“Okay. We can talk about it later, if you want to. But just don’t let this mess you up by not talking. I grew up with muggles too and so did lots of others, so it’s not like no one will understand, you know, if you’re confused.”
even talked about it, so how the hell was I supposed to know what was going on in your head? You never said anything, you never said you wanted it to be any different!“
! We were surviving. You said that, remember? And we had to be there for each other because no one else would. Our parents wouldn’t, the teachers wouldn’t, the Dark Lord wouldn’t and neither would Potter’s people. And I know we didn’t think it was going to be like this, but wasn’t that the whole fucking point, that even if the others couldn’t, the rest of Slytherin, you and I would still have each other’s backs?”
“I told you to shut your mouth. You have no idea what went on in Slytherin last year,” she said, standing up.
When it was fifteen minutes past the time he had asked him to come, Draco started to think that he probably hadn’t seen the message. He decided to give him at least an hour to notice it.
I honestly can't believe we've finally reached the end. I've spent so long writing this and it's been great, and it's kind of surreal to finally be done with it. Thanks for reading, and especially thanks to those of you that left comments, I swear I would never have finished this thing without you.
They met again on Monday, and Draco supposed one could say that it went better. He succeeded in creating the misty shield several times, and it did become thicker and more solid. He could sustain it for longer too, but it still did not become corporeal. So they met again later in the week. And again in the weekend, but he seemed to have stagnated.
“Okay?” she said, in a tone of voice that suggested, that she didn’t consider that a very good reason for them to speak to each other.
Harry forced a laugh. It was odd how two years ago he would still have interpreted the sarcasm as spiteful and the words as an insult. He reached his hand out again, just the back of his fingers brushing Malfoy’s knuckles, and this time he didn’t pull his hand away.
A couple of drunk muggles passed Draco on the opposite side of the street. He hunched up his shoulders and walked a little faster.
And they can’t stay there forever, so eventually Draco takes another step back, and Harry takes a deep breath and heads for the door.
“Still, if the room of requirement hadn’t burned down, I would’ve thought you’d rediscovered Harry’s book of wonder from sixth year.”
He hadn’t actually planned on casting his own patronus. He hadn’t thought Malfoy would be interested, it wasn’t like he needed proof that Harry could do it, but of course now it seemed obvious that he would expect a demonstration. Not that that was a problem, of course. It just wasn’t always easy to be mentally prepared for Malfoy. He oscillated between brooding bitterness and aloof indifference, and then suddenly this nice, normal bloke would emerge and make jokes and drawl sarcastic compliments, that were still compliments, and basically asking Harry to show off. It was confusing to say the least.
"Sure," said Malfoy carefully. "Anyway, I don't think I would be very welcome… you know, considering the role I played. I doubt anyone would be very happy to see me there."
,” he interrupted her. “As long as we don’t try to move anyone, they don’t alert the aurors, that’s the only reason we can do this. We don’t know what will happen if we start
The names of the dead prisoners were made public shortly after. Draco felt he had known it for a while; he wasn’t surprised. That didn’t change the way the floor seemed to fall away under him when he read it. Knowing didn’t mean it didn’t feel like being stabbed repeatedly in the chest.
That spin on the story had definitely been the worst part of it. And Harry hated that it didn't come easier to feel sorry for her, he knew first-hand how awful it was to have everyone believe things about you that weren't true, but he was still… maybe he was still a bit angry with her. Not because she had found someone else - Harry wasn't in love with her anymore and he knew it had to happen eventually -  but because he’d had to find out about it through Witch Weekly just like the rest of the Wizarding World. He’d been completely unprepared when the first reporters came for him. Of course, she’d written him immediately after it came out, and it wasn't like she’d intended for everyone to know yet but… It wasn't like he had any right to be angry. He was just being petty about it.
was on the wrong side during… the war. I didn’t expect any help from you when I went to trial. You didn’t owe me anything.” Malfoy stopped to clear his throat. “And I realized I have never properly thanked you for that.”
“Who are you? How did you get this number?” Harry snapped, too sharply, but his nerves didn't know what to do with the information, whether that made the situation better or worse, whether he would still need to run upstairs to wake up Ron and Hermione the second he hung up.
His audience dissolved and walked away as if nothing had happened. He watched them leave, but too many people blocked his view for him to be able to tell what was going on around Potter. He stood up and found his wand. He mumbled a cleaning charm to get the mud out of his hair and face.
I’ll come back. So maybe if she doesn’t feel like she has to wait for me, it’ll hurt less if I don’t.”
"Left," Potter said, but he grabbed Draco's outstretched hand anyway and Draco hoisted him to his feet, stumbling a little at the weight. And Potter swayed as he got to his feet, nearly crashing into him. Draco let go of Potter's hand as soon as he was upright, tried to back away, but Potter grabbed his arm again, clutching it tightly and Draco's heart threw itself into a fit.
Harry darted a glance at him, forgetting for a moment that he was trying to pretend this wasn't happening.
This was different from the careful kiss Draco had brushed over his lips the day before. Potter was kissing him, and his breath was fire in Draco’s mouth, his lips nipped at Draco’s, there was the foreign push of his tongue, and Draco kissed him back. Their fingers were still oddly intertwined and every nerve in Draco’s body hummed.
They finished their breakfast and managed to keep up a bit of conversation, though it mainly consisted of people asking to be passed the jam or the juice or the toast with perhaps too many pleases and thank yous. There were no other outbursts from the Slytherins. When the Gryffindors were done eating, they excused themselves, and just as he stood up, Harry leaned in close to Draco and whispered:
But of course Potter would assume it was something important when Draco had sent a bloody patronus to get him like this was the Order of the Phoenix. Or maybe he had come because he felt bad about what had happened in the dungeon the other day - Draco had just assumed that it was all good, it had seemed like they were on the same page about it when they split up. But of course he could have read that wrong –
“You were the one defending him the last time we talked about this,” Harry snapped. “You brought up the Wizengamot-decision, you seemed all for forgiving him back then.”
“It is,” she said, reopening her magazine and flipping back to her article. “I can’t believe it’s actually working out for you. I honestly never thought Potter was that dense.”
Malfoy ate quickly and as far as Harry could tell from across the Great Hall, he wasn’t talking to anyone. But he didn’t leave until Pansy Parkinson and Tracey Davis stood up first, and then he followed them out. He was about to point this out to the others when he caught Hermione looking at him disapprovingly.
“The duel wasn’t over. I could still fight, so she shouldn’t have assumed it was - and you should probably make a note of that before you try to use
“Weasley didn’t sound like she was too fond of that idea. It’s only a matter of time before the Gryffindor flock mentality kicks in and Potter goes back to hating you.”
“I thought about it. I don’t really like the idea that it knocks you out completely for seven hours, or how long it is. What if something happens and you don’t wake up?”
“I actually have no idea where to start,” said Draco, taking one of the chairs across from her. “Harry says you’ve been up here a lot. Where should I start?”
He waited for Granger to announce that she wouldn’t be coming with them – that was the only explanation he could think of for her odd timing. But she didn’t say anything and so they all agreed that four days was long enough, and they would be leaving then.
He'd moved out of the Manor a little over half a year ago. The trials had ended another half year before that. His father had been sentenced to life in Azkaban, while he and his mother had only been given mild sentences. There had been a huge fine to pay as reparations, certain restrictions on their personal freedom, but they'd been allowed to return to Malfoy Manor, no longer under house-arrest.
“That’s where Harry and Ron and I have talked about going too. We’ve sort of been looking for a flat, and if we split the rent it might be feasible.”
"You have got to start living a more interesting life, Potter. The poor reporters are practically starving. Maybe I should leak your address after all. You know, just to spice things up."
“I thought we weren’t going to do this anymore,” Malfoy says coolly. “You were very determined when you left last night. Did you change your mind?”
The room was empty. The furniture was still there, looking sad and abandoned, but everything else had been tidied up, all the maps and notes and mess. He suspected it was Weasley, or maybe Longbottom who had carefully removed and destroyed all evidence of their mission. The books were gone too. Draco had forgotten all about them, so despite the favouritism of Madam Pince, Hermione Granger had apparently proven herself to be the most conscientious of the two of them and had actually managed to remember something like library fines even in the wake of being nearly burned to death.
She lifted her head with a start, her eyes slow and confused before they settled on him. She stood up quickly, gathering her robes around her against the cold.
“Because of your girlfriend?” Draco asks, because of course there are a thousand reasons, but that one is the simplest.
He didn’t recognize the neat handwriting and it seemed such an odd message to receive from anyone at Hogwarts, let alone Draco Malfoy, that it actually took him a few seconds to figure out whose initials they were.
Granger raised her wand – Draco recognized the movement of the spell, he had seen it too often by now, but had never expected it from her. He stared, too stunned to move. Then she pronounced the first syllable and he lunged for her.
“Good, then I will leave both of you to your work. My office is just down the hall if you need me, and I will be back in an hour and a half when your detention is over. And just so we’re clear about this – I do not want to come back and find my classroom to be a smoking ruin. I have put up detection spells, and if either of you tries to cast any spells at all I will know it immediately.”
The patronuses were still solid and shone brightly. They were a barrier between them and the dementors, but the patronus charm was not a perfect shield. Draco could feel the cold tendrils of the darkness boring into his mind, his sanity creaking like a frozen lake in winter.
Harry nodded. He pushed back his chair and squeezed his way out, opting for jostling the stranger next to him rather than squashing himself against Malfoy.
“I know. And I think half these books have just been copying from each other, I keep reading the same sentences. And the other half are just making stuff up, it’s ridiculous.”
He had tried talking to his mother about it, about what had happened during the war and the trials and the time he'd spent at Hogwarts. And then he had stopped trying, because he couldn't stand how she kept promising that things would be fine, that everything would be back to normal soon enough, like it was somehow possible, somehow
He sounded certain, but it was hard to believe him. Standing inside Azkaban, it still felt inescapable. It was still a fortress; the walls were just as thick, the bars just as real. But the dementors were gone and the darkness of the place was a sane one. The dementors were gone and the awareness of the cruelty of what the place had been was like a steady beat through Harry’s brain.
“Trained aurors who have been stationed at Azkaban for weeks with guard duty, probably not enough sleep, dementors sucking at the edges of their magic and constantly sustaining patronus charms. We’ll be fine.”
He hadn't known Chris was on this shift too. All those precious hours of sleep had been for nothing; the day would end in homicide after all.
She turned away from him again as if the conversation was over. He didn’t leave. Pansy had never figured out how to stay quiet, especially when she was angry.
Malfoy raised his wand again, furrowing his brow in concentration. Harry watched him shift the grip on the wand. His lips moved, like he was murmuring something, but Harry couldn’t hear what it was. Then he took a deep breath.
Then Pansy put the wand away, and Ginny turned away from her, pushing back a lock of her sweaty hair and the moment had passed.
“I'm sorry about your beer,” he said, gesturing to one of the pints on the table. “I think it might have gotten warm by now.”
Draco blinked. He saw the dark figure of Blaise standing by his bed looking down at him. He had pulled back the draperies around the bed. Draco could make out Nott behind him. They both looked worried. The mad bird in Draco’s chest was flinging itself against his ribs. His body still didn’t feel entirely under his control when he tried to sit up again, this time with more success. He had no idea what his face looked like, but hoped that the darkness hid at least some of the terror he was feeling.
Harry glanced at Malfoy but not a muscle moved on his face. Across from him, Neville had shrunk into his chair and was concentrating hard on picking the stuffing out of a hole in the upholstery. Ron was staring at Ginny and Pansy, Hermione looked like she wanted badly to be somewhere else and Luna like she already was.
“Nothing,” he said quickly. “That’s what the message said, didn’t it? That it wasn’t anything important, it was just… it’s not like I had something I needed to tell you.”
The fire was a chimera, a phoenix, a dragon; predatory muscles of white-tinged flame that moved beneath its shoulder blades as it turned its massive head to look at him. There was only the one creature, and it was still leashed by Granger’s wand. Her face was wet with sweat.
“Like I said, I needed to talk to you and you wouldn’t let me. If I’d just walked up to you in The Great Hall, your private army would have lynched me.”
, he didn’t say. His voice hadn’t sounded right. He was walking next to Harry and for a brief moment, he felt the warm brush of Harry’s hand against his own. He didn’t say anything. They reached the next staircase.
“We’ll be fine,” said Malfoy with a shrug. “It doesn’t matter if we’re overheard. What we want to avoid is people from school finding out about this meeting, as that would be rather embarrassing for both of us, wouldn’t it? And in that respect this place is a much better option than The Three Broomsticks.”
. That those names meant nothing to them, that the fact that Harry and Malfoy were in Gryffindor and Slytherin gave them no clue that it was very unlikely they had been friends. That they had no idea what Hogwarts was, what it
“Your mom has been sending me letters, you know. Ever since we came back after Christmas. She asks me how you’re doing, if you’re okay, because you won’t talk to her.”
Malfoy was an entirely different issue. A whole area of issues that was taking up more and more space in Harry’s brain.
shouldn’t be first on the list. He wasn’t going to tell Malfoy that. He didn’t care what Malfoy did. But if he apologized one more time – well, there were limits to how long he would sit there and keep saying “it’s fine”.
Malfoy raises his eyebrows and his expression is still more disbelief than anger, even if his voice is scathing:
“Yeah. When Dumbledore’s Army was established we met here and we were overheard. People hide their faces, so we don’t know who’s listening.”
But Draco’s expression was vacant, he lowered his wand as if he had suddenly forgotten the use of it, and gazed up at the dementors, his breath forming white clouds in the freezing air. In the back of his mind, Harry could hear his mother screaming.
“It wasn’t about that last year either, it was for fighting the Carrow’s and hiding from the snitches in Slytherin.”
“Your arrogant arsehole thing – you can’t honestly think you’ve got any reason to act like you’re better than the rest of us anymore.”
During lunch, Potter – Harry – had caught Draco’s eye across the Hall and jerked his head in a quick nod before he turned away, which Draco took to mean that his friends had not been too suspicious of his nightly disappearance, and that it was still a secret. Which was, of course, a good thing.
He wondered what Ron and Hermione were doing. It was getting late. He should probably have told them where he was going. He had been such an arse. He took a long swig of his beer and tried to push the thought from his mind. He wished they were drinking something harder. He had managed to get out of Grimmauld Place alright. He could do with getting out of his head too.
“Well that’s the only other option, and awful as his parents may be, he is still a child in all of this.”
It felt very strange to climb through the portrait hole to the common room. He felt sure that everyone would be able to tell just by looking at him exactly what had happened. He was very aware of his face. And his mouth. But no one seemed to notice him at all.
He flicked his wand and his trunk landed neatly next to theirs when he joined them. He draped an arm over Harry’s shoulders, sagging heavily against him.
And when there finally was a pause, Harry thought Malfoy might be about to say something or ask him something that would require thinking on Harry’s part, so he suggested that they went back. He wasn’t sure how much time had passed in the dungeon, only that they probably ought to leave soon. It still felt cowardly to have said it, but Malfoy just nodded.
The pub was a small, unassuming place, but nicer than the one he had met Draco at last time. There was football playing on screens behind the bar, a couple of men watching it intently and quiet chatter around the room. Harry looked around for Malfoy's blonde hair and spotted him in a corner where two tables had been pushed together and a group of young people were squashed closely around them. Malfoy had his back to the door, but Harry had spent so much time following Draco around Hogwarts, he could pick the back of his head out of a line up. Harry headed towards them and the girl across from Draco seemed to notice. She perked up in her seat and said something to Draco, who turned around.
“Yeah, I heard you. Azkaban. I don’t even know what to do with that. I feel like an idiot for getting mad at you about New Years, but you should have told me. I can’t believe you told fucking Potter and not me.”
Potter looked disoriented for a second, and Draco could feel it too: the ground shifting beneath them, because they both remembered yesterday. Things were different now. This wouldn’t be a fight.
“She’s probably just disappointed that that book she picked up didn’t turn out to be a help with you-know-what after all,” he told him one evening they were on their way down to the Great Hall.
He knew what Malfoy was like – he was condescending, self-absorbed, arrogant and cruel. Self-pitying too – Malfoy was excellent at feeling sorry for himself, it was just ridiculous that Harry had started feeling sorry for him too. Because he had. And he had allowed some part of himself to want to see him, had allowed himself to like him. He would have liked to pretend that he hadn’t, that he hadn’t been worried when he was absent and relieved when he came back, but here he was, feeling disappointed and betrayed. And he felt like an idiot for ever believing in any of it.
“I know, Malfoy,” she said facing the still unmoving wizard. “I was there too. You’re sure it has to be that spell?”
“I know it’s too late to try to change anything," said Malfoy quickly. "That’s not what I’m doing. I just wanted to see you and say thank you."
It had been a year and a half since the end of the war and nearly a year since Harry, Ron and Hermione had moved into Grimmauld Place together. It still surprised Harry whenever someone mentioned it, that it had been a whole year now. It really didn’t feel like that long. He still felt like they ought to be at Hogwarts. He still had dreams, occasionally, about being behind on homework or late to class. It felt like he had stumbled into some adult life he never really expected to have.
He turned his gaze to the floor when they passed them, but he thought he could feel McGonagall’s eyes boring into him.
Draco glanced over at him. His head hung limply forward. His sweater was too big and kind of lumpy, managing to swallow the shape of his shoulders, even though Potter wasn't exactly scrawny anymore. Draco tried not to look at Potter's neck, that small stretch of smooth, brown skin exposed between Potter's hair and his collar. He tried not to think about what it might be like to touch him there, to run his fingers through his thick, black hair. It didn't go very well.
Harry didn't say anything. He supposed it was meant to be a jab at him, but it was sort of true. Historically he hadn't been very good at keeping out of the media's searchlight, though it wasn't for lack of trying. They had probably just been lucky. Lucky that it had been a quiet break up, that neither of them had found other people in the time after, that they had enough friends in common that they had still been seen together fairly often. That last part had been a bit weird too of course. Thankfully, their friends had known how to keep their mouths shut about it, but when all his friends were Ginny's friends too it was hard to really talk to any of them about it. And he couldn't talk to Ron either, obviously, and Hermione would probably feel awkward about it too, so he just didn't bring it up.
A second crash and the light in the tower dimmed as if the power had been cut. The glow condensed around the thin wire of the patronus chain, and then it snapped just as Draco’s patronus had in the pit. Harry threw himself at the railing, looking up in time to see red light flashing from the topmost gallery. A girl cried out, the words lost as her voice echoed down the tower. Harry thought it might have been Ginny.
His speech was getting more and more stilted, going from regular posh to something that sounded actually prewritten and rehearsed.
Madam Pomfrey’s face grew vacant. For a moment, she stood very still. Then she blinked slowly and looked around, as if she had just woken up in an unfamiliar place.
“Right,” said Malfoy’s voice. It sounded weird, not like Harry remembered it at all. “Of course, you were expecting a call from Mr Weasley,” he continued. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t take up any more of your time, then. I'll try again some other time-“
And Ron didn’t hate the aurors. He took to it well. People liked him, both the instructors and the other trainees. And he was good at it. Better than Harry. Which was a good thing, Harry reminded himself. Harry had always known Ron was brilliant, but it was nice that other people were starting to realize it too. That Ron was starting to believe it.
They split up. Draco led the way along the gallery followed by Harry, Granger, Lovegood and Longbottom, as they headed for the cells.
you Slytherin? The hat doesn’t give suggestions, it just places you in the house that best fits your abilities.”
Harry looked back towards the bar. It wasn't fifty feet behind them. Malfoy followed his glance and looked sheepish for a moment.
He wanted to ask Malfoy about being a Death Eater. And about Hogwarts last year. He wanted to ask if he felt bad about having used the cruciatus curse in class, and if he had used it outside of class too. He wanted to ask why he didn’t care when Bellatrix tortured Hermione – or if he had cared. Mostly he wanted to hear him say that he was sorry for all of it and that he regretted everything, which was why he didn’t ask:  he knew that wasn’t the answer he would get. Hermione had to be right. If Malfoy had still had a conscience, how would he even be able to stand? How could he look at anyone without crumbling from shame? How could he have made himself come back to Hogwarts?
“Do you really think that is the only reason I might want to speak with you privately? That I would never call a student to my office simply because they were my student? You’re here because all of your teachers are concerned about you. And not just about your academic performance, but about your wellbeing.”
Ginny lowered her wand. She was sweating and out of breath. Ron was bleeding from where a severing charm or something like it had brushed his cheek. Harry’s heart was pounding hard, his fingers felt strange and numb. He watched Neville step over the fallen auror at his feet to kneel down by Luna.
“Gods, I’ve been slaving on my essay for Alchemy, I haven’t even looked at the assignments for today,” Blaise said. “Have any of you read it?”
“I’m just trying to figure out if I should have seen this coming,” she said eventually. “I know Potter is a bit thick sometimes, but does he really not realise you’re just using him?”
"Merlin's saggy teats," Draco swore, gasping for air. "Are you absolutely mad, Potter? If you're too drunk to stand then you're too drunk to apparate! You could have
He went in and closed the door behind him. Pansy was sitting on her bed, she had probably been talking to Daphne before he came.
Draco looked towards the wall where the molten remainders of the chains glowed dimly red. He stood up. His balance was terrible and he swayed dangerously as he staggered to where Harry was leaning over Granger.
“I’m not-“ Granger began, but Harry cut her off, clearly not interested in her amateur mind penetration.
“I expected as much, but I still want you to consider it. If it’s a no for now, I must ask you to talk to me instead. Things cannot continue the way they have so far.”
He put down the note and took a closer look at the book. It was a thin, cheaply bound volume. There was no title or author printed on the cover, which was probably why it had been misplaced. He turned to the title page. He didn’t recognize the name of the author, but the title, printed in spindly letters above it, was enough to send a rush of excitement through him:
“You knew it was coming. What did you think Blaise was going to do? Just continue to be pals with you after being publicly called a Death Eater? People might interpret what he did as him defending you, and you know he doesn’t want that. He’s playing politics, and being friends with you doesn’t benefit him in the least.”
“That’s nonsense, darling. You deserve all the kindness you are given. It’s not your job to reject the people who want to forgive you.”
“Granger,” he interrupted her. “Look, I’m- I’m very sorry for the way I’ve treated you over the years.”
His pulse was hammering. He had been feeling dazed and half sleep ever since he came back, but he didn’t anymore. His thoughts were crystal clear.
Harry had been called in as a witness for the trials of both Malfoy and his mother. He had told the Wizengamot how she lied for him when Voldemort thought he had killed him. He had also mentioned how Draco had lowered his wand in the Astronomy Tower, before Snape killed Dumbledore, and had been surprised he even remembered. His statements hadn’t seemed to matter much though. The heaviest argument had been how young Malfoy was when he took the mark, that he was underage when he committed most of his crimes, and that he had been pressured by his family into joining the Dark Lord. It had been almost even how many had voted for and how many against pardoning him. He remembered how long it took to count the raised hands. Malfoy had been three votes from a life sentence to Azkaban. Not that he had seemed to care; the boy at the hearing had been almost unrecognizable to Harry. His skin had been dull, almost grey, his eyes sunken in their hollows and the cheekbones jutting out like they were about to cut through the skin. It had reminded Harry of how Sirius looked when they first met. His hair had been matted and dirty, far from the smooth silk Harry remembered, and all the arrogance and confidence that usually emanated from him had disappeared. Before them had sat a frail teenage boy with slack mouth and dead, unseeing eyes. His voice was monotone when he was questioned, and Harry would have thought he was completely indifferent towards his sentence if it hadn’t been for the way he winced whenever the dementors were mentioned, more a physical than a conscious reaction to the word.
He would never understand how someone who knew about magic could be excited about pens. He had never minded using quills at Hogwarts. He couldn't imagine writing a transfiguration paper with a regular ballpoint.
As if to underline his words, the wind hammered another loud round of raindrops against the windows. Harry was trying to think of something to say that wasn’t a string of curses, but having a civil conversation with Malfoy was quite possibly the most frustrating thing he had ever done. He had agreed to meet him only because the invitation had seemed like a big concession on Malfoy’s part and he thought he ought to be cooperative in return, at least to some extent. And then, Malfoy had been an arsehole when they talked in the owlery, but he had also seemed honest. Something about that talk, or fight or whatever it was, had felt like – not a solution, but it felt like
“Don’t act like you haven’t given me reason to!” said Potter, stepping towards him. “You’re the one who’s acting suspicious, suddenly not talking to your friends and skulking around outside Gryffindor tower in the middle of the night.”
A second fist caught him in the stomach and he doubled over. He inhaled sharply. He gasped and grabbed and managed to yank at Potter’s knee and push him backwards with his shoulder. Potter lost his balance and fell hard on his back, dragging Draco down with him. He landed on top of Potter, and they rolled on the floor, trying to keep the other down, to land a punch, while their legs got tangled in their robes.
Ron went completely red – it was incredible how touchy he still was about that considering how long he and Hermione had been together by now.
Dean turned to look at Seamus, who was already in the bed and was grinning rather smugly at them. Dean threw his pillow at him.
“Yes, I can see that. What an honour it is to have you join us, I haven’t seen you in quite a while. But perhaps you consider the subject of Transfiguration to be beneath you?”
A second passed and then another, and then there was a static crackling from the little plastic speaker.
It was rare that all of their little group gathered at once, but a steady stream of information passed between them. They filtered in and out of the secret room at different times. For all of them it had once been routine practice to keep most of their activities secret, to stay under the radar of teachers and remain inconspicuous to other students. It was easy to fall back into old habits. Once, Draco came up there and found a stack of old newspaper articles that had appeared next to his and Granger’s books and notes, and Pansy hadn’t even mentioned it to him.
“I was under my invisibility cloak. Dumbledore paralysed me, I couldn’t do anything, but…” Potter trails off.
They took off from the top of the metal stairs on the outer wall of Azkaban, through icy pinpricks of rain. Harry flew at the back of their formation, watching the backs of his friends, of Neville, who shared Draco’s broom this time, Ron who was holding Hermione tightly in place in front of him, Luna with her arms wrapped around Ginny’s waist, her white hair billowing behind her. Ahead of them, the dark line of the shore was coming closer. When he glanced back over his shoulder, he saw the first light of dawn spilling over the horizon and the still visible shape of Azkaban silhouetted against it.
Little remembered bits of conversation were clicking into place in the back of Harry’s mind. Small things were making sense, most of them drowned out by the noise in his head as a major part of his world view was trying to shift, cranked by the cynicism that was Hermione’s unconcerned voice.
They walked across the grounds towards the gate; down the gravel path the same way they had four days earlier. Neville looked back towards the castle.
She stopped and finally managed to lift her eyes to his face. He was grimacing around another half-sentence stuck in his throat.
“What are we going to do about the aurors?” Draco asked, gesturing to the four unconscious people on the floor.
“Is that an invisibility cloak?” asked Pansy, pointing Draco’s attention to the piece of cloth folded in Granger’s arms.
to get it open. It was dark inside. Potter muttered a spell and flames seized the wicks of the half burned candles in the candleholders on the walls and in the chandelier hanging from the ceiling.
The light from Lovegood’s hare reflected a bright sheen in the whites of his eyes. His voice was all business, but Draco remembered third year and he thought that Harry had to be just as scared of this place as he was.
. In twenty years I’m still going to be that pureblood bitch to all of them. So if you think you’re not abandoning me by pretending you’re not just as much of a Slytherin as I am, you’re lying to yourself. And you
They walked to the castle, all of them casting worried glances at Hermione, whose troubled breathing was only getting worse. Now and then a small whimper escaped her, and Ron held on to her a little tighter.
Harry followed Malfoy inside. They split up and went to sit down at their own house tables. Ron and Hermione had saved him a seat. He sat and loaded up his plate.
She had flipped open the book while Granger spoke and was already immersed in it. A tiny smile played around the corners of her mouth.
"Uh, yeah, it's… yeah. I mean we're still friends," he added. "So I don't… I don't mind. Is all. That's what I meant."
There was a loud crash, Potter jumped back, so startled Draco thought he might have had a minor heart attack. He stared at the cauldron where it had fallen over the edge of the table, the potion that had spilled everywhere and the purple fumes rising from the sizzling liquid. Then he raised his eyes from the mess, slowly, and looked at Draco. Draco stared back at him, a smirk creeping over his lips.
Slughorn put a hand on Draco’s shoulder and it was probably supposed to demonstrate to his mother how
When Cho kisses him, Harry has a note from Draco burning in his pocket, and that night he doesn’t go.
Ginny Weasley stood frozen in the doorway, staring at Draco and Pansy. Then she turned her eyes to Potter, who stood by the window looking incredibly uncomfortable. Granger and Ronald Weasley had arrived right before Ginny. They had looked just as confused as her, but not half as angry.
“No,” Harry repeats, “it wasn’t about that. I thought… I was pretty sure you had taken the mark, and I did want to know, but that wasn’t why I… It wasn’t about that, alright?”
Malfoy stepped away from Harry, out of reach, and a jolt of panic shot through him. He didn’t want to leave. Leaving felt very final all of a sudden, as if what had happened might be something that was confined to this room and would vanish as soon as they closed the door behind them.
He had told Malfoy that he would try to convince them to come back, but he would just have to explain it to him later. Make him understand that he couldn’t. It shouldn’t even matter if he understood – he didn’t owe Malfoy anything.
Ron didn’t say anything; he just walked out the door without looking at Harry at all. Neville and Luna followed him, and Malfoy stood up to leave as well.
Sleep still feels unattainably far away even after Malfoy has come down and gone back up, and Harry lies awake, eyes open, looking at the dark ceiling, debating whether or not he should go.
He sounded spiteful and hated himself for it. It was such a kind gesture. He knew that was how Potter meant it – platonically. An offer of comfort. Why the hell did he feel the need to mock it?
They had known each other too long for Ron to be fazed by Harry's anger. Harry took a step back down the stairs. He leaned against the wall.
And in the end he had decided to go anyway, because he was an idiot and despite everything he wanted to see Potter.
should stop talking like you were just innocent bystanders - you were all helping them, you were turning us in.”
“Could be anyone,” she said. “I’ve no idea how this contraption works. Your voice doesn’t sound like you at all. How does it know those numbers are you?”
They all turned as one to look at Harry Potter. He was standing on the edge of the group flanked by the two Weasleys, who were still grinning, and Granger, who had her arms folded across her chest and an inscrutable expression on her face. Most of the laughter died out, and Macmillan looked uncertain.
Except it isn’t at all, they’re much older now, he should be mature about this, he ought to be able to leave it alone.
“Hey!” she called and they stopped, turning to look at her. “Harry, how do you feel about doing a couple of group duels?”
He hadn't quite believed it when he’d first heard that the tube system was muggle made. Of course, it had seemed too great a feat of magic to simply abandon, but still… He had asked around about accidents before heading down there, made sure that it was safe, but it had been hard to get used to. He still wasn't entirely comfortable riding it yet, despite using it almost daily at this point, but if you didn't think too hard about it, it did sort of feel like magic. And if you did think about it, he supposed it was just plain impressive.
“We can’t. We talked about this, we can’t apparate into Azkaban, so we have to go to the coast, and he’s the only one who’s been there,” said Hermione.
The cold gnawed at Draco’s flesh, there were drops of water in the air that stung his face like needles. He didn’t remember how long the boat ride had been from the mainland to the prison. It had seemed endless, but he was starting to fear that they might have gone too far, that they might have missed it. How close did they have to be before it became visible? He wasn’t sure about that either. He glanced back at the dark shapes of the others flying behind him. They might have to turn around and start over from the house on the coast. Fly out again and hope they had better luck. If he had been alone, he would have turned back already, now he didn’t dare tell them. It was too early for failure. He tightened his grip on his broom. They were wasting time. They could spend the whole night flying back and forth and still not find it. And even if they did find it, how likely was it even that their plan would work out? There were so many ifs and maybes.
Weasley nodded. Something about the exchange felt familiar to Draco, though at first he couldn’t figure out why. Then he realized that they reminded him of the aurors at Azkaban. The way Longbottom reflexively cast the protection spells, the way Ginevra checked with him, not because she doubted his judgement, but because that was their routine. They had all aged so much in the last year.
Mrs Weasley leads Draco to the attic, the only available space in the Burrow at this point. Harry has helped clear some stuff out of the way, helped her make up an old bed, set up a lamp and a dresser, so it’s sort of like a room. He doesn’t go up there with them when Draco arrives. As soon as they have passed the first landing he has no chance of hearing what they might say, but he has already made up his mind that he will not hesitate to kill Malfoy if he shows even the slightest sign of ingratitude.
Ginny was out of breath and off-balance, but they had all seen Pansy’s first spell miss; they had all seen Ginny cast the shield in time for the second one.
“Relax, Potter. We’re drunk, you were messing with my hair, I was just going along with it. It’s just for fun, I’ve been making out with Pansy at parties for years, it doesn’t mean shit.”
"You're sure your name is Harry," Irie asked with a grin. "You're not secretly called some posh name like… I don't know, Harrington or something?"
“Yes,” he said, catching himself quickly. “I read through it, though to be honest I’m not sure how much of it I understood. Maybe I should have reread it, but I was pretty exhausted so I went back to the dorms.”
sort of magic that I couldn’t do twice as well?” he continued as he tucked his wand away in a pocket
There was a moment of hesitation where he thought it probably hadn’t worked, but then the patronus vanished and it was too late to regret the message.
And this was the prison of Azkaban: an enormous, open space between the three outer walls of the tower. An external gallery ran along the walls with cell doors on the right, an iron railing on the left. The galleries below were visible, each forming a band of dim light until some way down, where the lowest stories were swallowed by darkness, making the drop seem endless. And there were dementors. In his mind he had imagined them swarming all over the place, but they were only shadows passing on the galleries below, or they were movements in the deep pit, rising from or descending into the darkness. He dragged his eyes away. He stared at the floor under his feet, at the hem of his mother’s robes. It had not been necessary to tell them not to look into the cells. He didn’t want to see what was in there. He didn’t want to know what happened to people when they were put in a place like this.
“Sure, I’m not doing much this week anyway." Or any other week, for that matter. He definitely didn't have a "busy schedule". So whatever, if Malfoy wanted to see him, he could do that. "Thursday?” he said.
There were nods and shrugs all around. He wasn’t surprised; he hadn’t expected Blaise to keep quiet about his nightmares.
They both nodded. Slughorn left, and Harry began reading through the instructions. He could hear Malfoy taking out ink and parchment, opening the boxes, the clink of glass when he looked through their contents. Harry tried to ignore it. It was a difficult potion. He had gotten it almost perfect before Malfoy spilled it all on the floor, but he had to concentrate if he wanted to do it again. For a while they worked in silence, but then he heard Malfoy pushing out his chair. He pretended not to notice. He heard him walk across the room and stop by Harry’s desk. Harry didn’t look up.
if it gets close enough to me to change shape. If we’re not taken by surprise, then it should be fine.”
A few months after that, Harry watches paralyzed and hidden under the invisibility cloak when Dumbledore offers to hide Draco from Voldemort, and there is not any part of him that doesn’t wish for Malfoy to accept.
came away completely shaken,” she said. “And that’s not because you’re morally superior to her, but it could be because you’re much younger. You haven’t had as much time to learn to ignore it. That’s why we believed what you told us, but McGonagall didn’t.”
“And you know, sometimes forgiveness isn’t good,” she said and the last bit of patience had left her voice. “I don’t think you’re stuck up or self-righteous, or whatever else people have said about you. A lot of the time your judgment is right and I know you’re a good person, but you have no
His father looked at him, or looked over him or through him. Draco felt sick. Narcissa let go of his hand to kneel in front of the corpse of a man. When she spoke her voice was soft and soothing. She told him that she and Draco had been pardoned. That they still had the manor and most of their assets, and everything was all right. It smelled terrible in the cell. There was a drain in the floor.
He did end up attending the rest of his classes that day, though when they were over, he couldn’t remember what any of them had been about.
They were all staring at him, except for Pansy who was looking away and probably either choking herself not to laugh or just rolling her eyes painfully hard at his stupidity.
“I’m not,” she said firmly, then added more quietly: “And we shouldn’t be talking about this here, so save it for later. Harry will you pass me the orange juice?”
At four they were in a circle on the floor, too tired to move. Their voices were low, the conversation slow and drowsy. Luna had her head in Ginny’s lap and Ginny was braiding her hair. Ron had his arms around Hermione; Seamus slumped against Dean, his head resting on his shoulder. Neville had his back against Ginny’s bed and was fighting hard to keep his eyes open. It was still completely dark outside. They could see the light from the room reflected in the black glass. When they spoke it was with frayed, hazy voices.
"All our assets are still frozen,” he said. “My father was involved in a lot of things, not all of them quite legal. It's taking them a while to sort out how much of our fortune they still think belongs to us.” He laughed a small, mirthless laugh. “Or I guess how much they can get away with taking. So I needed to find something… affordable."
They mounted their brooms. Draco kicked off and was the first one in the air, the others took a little longer before their passengers were settled and they followed. Draco flew ahead, leading them as close to the small house as he dared. Then he turned and they left the mainland, flying straight out over the ocean.
He fiddled with the cuffs of his jacket. He couldn’t even remember why he owned tailored funeral robes. When had he had them made? Had he thought about whose death they would be for?
He turned away, walked to the side of the room and sat down on the edge of a table. He rubbed his face in his hands, pressing his fingers hard against his eyes. Shapes in odd colours danced on the inside of his eyelids.
Because she isn’t. Not technically. Even if today made it feel like perhaps she still was, or a promise that she would be again. When the war is over. If they both make it.
“And obviously I shouldn’t have to say this, but we’re not using any spells that might cause any actual damage. We don’t want to have to explain any injuries to Madam Pomfrey. I know it’s less realistic, but that’s how it has to be,” she said.
A charred log snapped in the fireplace, sparks flying up from the embers, and they both started. Harry realized how loud they had been. The common room was dark and quiet around them.
He turned down the stairs and Draco followed. Granger stopped behind him and looked back at the other two.
Draco glanced into the the dark opening. He couldn’t see far down it anymore, but when it had been illuminated by Harry’s patronus, it had looked like it stretched far longer than it ought to, far beyond the extent of the outer walls of Azkaban.
“Yes,” she said and he stood up. “But you can come back here whenever you want to, if you ever want to talk to me again. I still think you might benefit from the therapy. Please tell me if you change your mind about it. And if you have trouble sleeping, you can always go see Madam Pomfrey.”
Draco doesn’t remember making the decision to kiss him. There’s a glip of terror in his chest when their lips meet and for a second Harry remains frozen. But then his lips move, he kisses him back. His hand buries itself in Draco’s hair, pulling him closer. He finally releases Draco’s arm to reach for his hip instead. Draco takes a step back and Harry follows, the back of Draco’s knees hit the bed and he falls onto the mattress, and Harry follows. He climbs over him, holding himself above Draco, supporting his weight with one hand, while the other runs up Draco’s side as he keeps kissing him, and Draco is clinging to him, desperately wanting him closer. Ragged breaths escape between them, the bed creaks with every movement, springs screaming when Harry shifts his weight to kiss Draco’s neck, his collarbone, and Draco drags him back to his mouth so he can kiss him again, and he keeps running his fingers through that thick mess of hair, again and again. He’s out of breath and half hard, he isn’t sure when that happened. He presses his face into Harry’s neck, breathing heavily, and then he feels Harry’s fingers at his waist, warm hands brushing his skin as Harry pushes his shirt up.
There was another sound. It could have been someone moving about up in the guards’ room. It could have been the wind outside. It could have been a door opening or someone coming down the stairs after them. Draco gripped his wand tighter.
a possibility, Harry,” she said, eyeing him before he could speak. “But no matter what his intentions are, I think we can agree that Azkaban is something we should do something about. We’ll have to do some research, check up on some of the things he said and find out the best course of action, which might be not to go there at all. And if we do have to and we still don’t trust him, then we just won’t take him with us. It’s not like he’ll be able to secretly turn the plans into something else if we’re all working together.”
Malfoy doesn’t die. Harry doesn’t go see him. It’s not the sort of thing you can apologize for. He dreams about it quite a lot, though.
“It’s not about that, it’s – I’ve been thinking about it all the time since I came back. It’s not evil in a conscious way, but it’s still evil and I think it makes our whole world darker. It makes people darker, not just the ones who go there or go near it, but everyone. I think it
Granger stood up and when he turned his eyes away from Potter to look at her instead, he no longer cared about Potter’s conscience or his neck or his hands, about the shape of his jaw or the white of the scar against his dark skin.
“Fine,” said Malfoy, cutting him off. “Fine. I kissed you because I was completely out of it after the boggart. I know it was stupid, but it really got to me. And then I suppose I was confused about the hand-holding, which isn’t to say I’m blaming you or anything. But you wouldn’t let me leave, for fucks sake - if I had just left like I wanted to, it wouldn’t have happened.”
“We could call it something else, and maybe it could be more like a duelling club. I know we can’t use the room of requirement anymore, but it wouldn’t have to be a secret, so maybe we could talk to professor Jenkins or professor McGonagall about it.”
They worked for a while in silence and when the clock neared nine, Draco started packing up his stuff. Nott looked up.
The paper is red soaked through already, so he takes it off and throws it in the bin by the door. Draco gets off the table and crosses over to him.
“Who is she?” he croaked looking up at the aurors who were watching him with more impatience than pity.
Heating beans in a tent hadn't felt much like cooking, and that was what they had mostly resorted to when they were searching for horcruxes, which was the last time he had cooked anything.
“Draco, look at me, did they get you?” Harry tried again, but Draco didn’t answer him and so there was nothing for Harry to do but walk with him, his familiar patronus to his right on the other side of Hermione, Draco and the strange patronus to his left.
She licked her chapped lips and mumbled something else, but he couldn’t make out the words. He could hardly make out her face anymore either and he realized how dark it had gotten around them, that the light was the flickering yellow of oil lamps not the steady silver of the patronus. He turned, and saw the backs of his mother and the auror far ahead. They hadn’t noticed he had stopped. He felt the unnatural cold biting into his flesh.
"I'm buying a drink," he said, mimicking Draco's cool tone so perfectly, Draco ought to receive an Order of Merlin for not punching him in the face.
Potter straightened up and Draco started and quickly looked away. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter lean back and rest his head against the door behind them. He had his eyes closed and Draco could see his Adam's apple move when he swallowed.
“But now it’s associated with the fact that my father was a Death Eater, which I want them to forget about as soon as possible. So I don’t use it anymore.”
He was looking earnestly at Draco. He hadn’t asked mockingly, like Blaise had, but with something like genuine interest.
“It could have been a natural occurrence. A place that made people evil, not a place made evil by people. But it looks like this was always the intention. It was made to be a prison. Makes you feel sort of hopeless, doesn’t it?”
“He had it tough last year,” interrupted Pansy. “I remember him, he- not that that excuses anything. But it’s good if Blaise can talk to him. They need to realize we’re not fighting anymore.”
Still, Ron has made it, Hermione has made it, and despite his guilt about pulling them into this, he is so grateful that they’re coming with him. They settle in at the Burrow, Harry in Ron’s room, Hermione in Ginny’s.
She pulled open the bag she had slung over her shoulder and handed out gloves for flying to Neville, Luna and Hermione. She and Ron were already wearing theirs and Harry had brought his own as well. Ron looked around.
“I thought maybe… you know, just speaking of Ginny, I thought we might start up Dumbledore’s Army again?”
Harry ascended the stairs and made his way back to Gryffindor tower. It was a long walk from the dungeons and since the corridors were mostly empty this time of night, it gave him some time to think.
"Is that real?" she pointed at him, her voice rising, he finally got enough control of his body to yank his sleeve down. "Is that fucking real? Why are they letting you work here?"
He picked up his glass, drained the last of his beer and stood up before Harry could ask what that was supposed to mean.
it says that as far as she can tell the number of dementors has increased since wizards started putting prisoners in the tower.”
you, Potter! I thought you had figured that out, but apparently I was giving you more credit for your intellect than you deserve. And I know how very inconvenient it is, which is why I tried to tell you that we should just ignore it.”
He was standing too close. Draco would have stepped back if Potter hadn’t been holding on to his arm so tightly, actually pulling him towards him, as if he was afraid Draco would apparate away.
Harry didn’t know it was possible to be angry with someone for so long, but his anger seethed in him the entire Saturday following the night in the astronomy tower. All it took was the sight of Malfoy or the slightest reminder of that night for it to roar back to life. Because there had been a pact, they had had an agreement and Harry had been fulfilling his end of it, not even realizing that Malfoy wasn’t and wouldn’t follow through on his. What was it even he had promised? That he would stop being a bastard? Harry couldn’t believe he had ever thought Malfoy was capable of that.
And then Granger’s otter twisted slightly and Draco flinched and Granger gasped as they all saw it at the same time when the light flickered over the face of the dead wizard and caught in his eyes – because they were eyes, not empty sockets as they had seemed at first, only they were mirror-black and had looked like empty holes until the moment they reflected the light. Now they did see the eyes, the face of the corpse looked a lot less skeletal. He looked a lot less dead.
"I don't know," he said. "I just don't know what he wanted from me. His mum already thanked me for being at the trials, so I don't know why he was bringing that up again."
“Okay, good. Obviously if you do see Malfoy trying to feed poison to first years you should tell us, just don’t spend all your time stalking him on the Marauder’s Map or anything.”
And then he plunged ahead into the bodies of the dementors, herding his patronus forward. Draco snatched up Granger’s wand and followed.
Harry felt nervous hope stirring in his chest – they couldn’t be sure yet, he told himself, they couldn’t be sure what was happening or why, but still-
Harry paced the living room as he wondered how long it would take the owl to make it to Malfoy's place.
He looked into the cells on the way up. It didn’t matter now. He knew what was in them. Some prisoners were chained to the wall, though he couldn’t see any reason for it. Some were drooling and rocking themselves back and forth, but most didn’t move at all. He thought at some point that he wanted to stop looking, but then it seemed he couldn’t. And they walked forever. He had no idea how far up they were when they passed her. A young woman, who moved closer to the bars when they neared her cell. There was something odd and disjointed about her movements. Her features seemed elongated and inhuman, but she was looking right at Draco, and her eyes weren’t dead. She could have been his age, hardly much older.
“Well, I’m going to go find Tracey. And I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I absolutely agree with Granger. You should leave Potter alone.”
“Right, so sometimes I’ve been walking around the corridors at night. Apparently Potter was doing the same thing and I’ve run into him a couple of times.”
“When did I say that? You met with Harry Potter, most famous wizard in Britain, your childhood crush and your self-proclaimed nemesis, in what universe would I not want to know how it went?"
“Alright, well, the others are already there, I stayed behind to wait for you. I’ll side-along you and we’ll get started.”
"It's for his own good! You know he needs to get over Adrian. And Draco is kind of his type, right?"
Harry looked away, down towards the lake where some frustrated Hufflepuff-kid was trying to teach his classmates how to play football. He hadn’t told Ron and Hermione much about Malfoy’s trial.
She didn’t wait for an answer, but walked quickly to the steps to the girl’s dormitories and disappeared upstairs without looking back at him. Harry didn’t move. He sat motionless in his chair and stared into the embers, as the guilt he had been supressing the whole day came back ten times stronger. He shouldn’t have defended Malfoy. He didn’t even want to defend him; Hermione was probably right about him. But that was exactly why she wasn’t supposed to have found out. It should have been secret until Harry had had time to figure it out on his own.
It was past midnight when Draco slid silently out of bed. He got dressed but didn’t put on his shoes until he was out of the dormitory and had pushed the door closed behind him. Pansy was already waiting for him in the common room. She stood up when she saw him
"You know, honestly, if you aren't going the auror-way, I'm surprised you haven't taken the same route Weasley did," said Malfoy. "Try to go pro. You were quite good."
“I uh… I was looking for you,” said Pansy. “I thought you might be up here and… well, I didn’t think anyone… that he would be here. Too.”
. There had been some unpleasant encounters during his first days in the muggle world with store assistants who had kept repeating to him that his stupid, tight and uncomfortable trousers were
Draco looked around the faces in the room. They were all watching him impatiently. They did not seem inclined to let him leave.
Harry doesn’t tell him that he should, just like he hasn’t told Ron or Hermione or Ginny. There is a point where you can’t run anymore, or at least where you have to stop telling other people to if you can’t stand the thought of doing it yourself.
Harry stared at him. The boy was ginger and freckled enough to pass for a Weasley. His name might have been John or Josh. Malfoy was staring at him like a deer caught in headlights.
“That sounds… right,” she said, pulling the book towards her. “But for that to work – there are hundreds of prisoners in Azkaban. It would be impossible to cast enough patronuses to shield all of them.”
He turned around, picked Harry's jacket off the coat rack and then stopped, just for a second, hand hovering before him.
“Maybe…” said Dean and turned his attention to the front of the classroom, where professor Binns had just drifted through the wall.
The way her voice dropped on that last word that sent a cold, trickling shiver down Draco’s spine. No one would say it like that unless they had been attacked by a dementor and knew exactly what it felt like; knew that
She put it back on the table. The pages she had opened to showed an illustration of two beautifully calligraphed runes with no explanation except for a small notation next to them labelling them
“Are you sure we don’t need to talk this through? You looked horrified for a moment, I’m sorry I didn’t realize this was a big thing, but...”
“No. Sometimes I just can’t believe the shit Potter has gotten all of you into. I assume it was his idea?”
Draco rolled up his sleeves. He usually never did, never wore short sleeves on anything, and kept his arms covered at all times. But it was awfully hot in there, and he was at work, he was wearing his apron and he was invisible. Irie had seen the mark before anyway. She'd told him it was a cool tattoo.
“Right,” said Potter. “Right, so I know how it feels. I know it’s not exactly the same, or I guess it’s not the same at all but… I know he leaves deep marks. I never even thought about what I might want to do with my life if I actually survived. If I managed to kill him. I still don’t know. I never liked that I was supposed to be some sort of hero, but it’s weird to not… Everything’s weird now.”
"I mean,” Malfoy persisted, “one would expect some of the muggleborn to have brought them along, right? Honestly, I never want to use a quill again. Did you know the ink dries almost immediately after you've written something?"
Actually, Draco had meant to ask her about them. As far as he knew, Granger had taken just about every boring subject available at Hogwarts, and he would have thought her unable to stay away from something as dry as ancient runes. He was also a bit surprised to hear her admit so blankly that there was something she didn’t know.
to write about that he didn’t have to worry too much about gossip about him, but he would still prefer to avoid even the risk of a Skeeter-like article with a headline involving “the snake and the lion” or some other ridiculous thing like that.
There was an edge to Malfoy’s voice. Harry glanced over at him, but he was looking straight ahead and his face didn’t give anything away.
Malfoy raised his glass and Harry mimicked him half-heartedly. He figured it was safe to drink when he had seen Aberforth pour it, but it smelled stronger than any alcohol he had tried before so he only dared a small sip. It was awful, sharp and bitter and burning, it was like having his taste buds wrenched apart and he swallowed so quickly he had to suppress a cough, though when he was done choking on it, the whisky did leave a pleasant burning sensation spreading down his throat.
“I’m good with strange things, you know,” she said with a gentle smile that made him think suddenly that she might already know.
Harry teaches Dumbledore’s Army and Draco joins the inquisitorial squad. It probably should have ended then but it doesn’t. Draco wears the shiny silver
He sounded almost sympathetic. Harry pulled his knees up to his chest, pressing the receiver close to his ear. No one was going to think that. Especially if people knew that Malfoy was… The details of last night's conversation were pretty hazy, but Malfoy had seemed to think people knew. He had assumed Harry knew. Harry's head was starting to hurt again.
Back at the table, Malfoy and Mark were still missing. Harry took his jacket from where he had hung it on the back of his chair. Irie looked up at him.
Draco could feel his heart like a heavy fist knocking against his ribs, his stomach a tightly wound knot.
He raised his wand and began casting spells, going through a long series of revealing and disarming charms, half of which Draco had never heard before. The other auror, Jansson, had her wand trained on them as well, but didn’t cast any spells. He assumed she was just standing by as extra security if they were to try anything even without their wands, but then he felt the clammy sensation of another mind brushing against his own. He started. The feeling was gone before he managed to put up any occlumency barriers. He scowled at her and there was the tiniest notion of a smile on her face. Belby finished up his incantations and asked them to follow him.
He lingered behind while Granger went up to Madam Pince, but when he came out of the library, she was waiting for him in the corridor.
He didn't mean to sound petulant - they had had a good time, if the others wanted to go to a pub, of course they should. Pansy rolled her at eyes at him.
He convinces himself that it’s over, but two days later he’s in a bathroom stall with his hand curled in Draco’s silky, blond hair. And the day after that, Draco whispers in his ear again.
Then he left her office and was carried down the spiralling staircase. He touched the bruise on his chin. He had healed it so it wasn’t visible, but it was still sore. He couldn’t even recall everything he had said to Potter, but he knew it had been bad. He should have just walked away, not made him hit him, but there had been nothing but bitterness in him. If Potter had just waited one more day before approaching him, it would have been different. It seemed tragically ironic that he had pushed him away just before finding out exactly how much he was going to need him.
for this. Once, the whole purpose of befriending Harry had been to get the people in this room to give him the attention they were giving him now, to regain their admiration, to prove that they had all been wrong to count him out. It felt good, only not as good as he had thought it would. It wasn’t great, it wasn’t a sweeping sense of redemption, because their approval was no longer the thing he wanted most in the world. They weren’t his friends. Pansy was his friend and so was Harry. And they had already forgiven him.
Sometimes Longbottom would stop to glance nervously back towards the top of the tower. They probably wouldn’t even hear it if there was a duel up there, but maybe he was hoping to notice light from the spells if something went wrong. Granger would check her watch every time she moved forward to draw the next rune. Draco didn’t know if she was actually keeping track of time or just making sure she didn’t accidentally look into one of the cells. Draco didn’t have any trouble with that – his eyes were constantly and inevitably drawn to the pit. It was the sort of darkness that sucked at your gaze, complete and impenetrable. It wasn’t like looking into a dark room, it was like having a blind spot in the middle of your vision and it was impossible not to try to stare through it.
“Because you’re the only one who would have thought of it, and your head’s been full of N.E.W.T’s,” said Ron.
the bottom, because the dark down there was moving too. Waving. Breathing. A cold chill ran down his spine. There were thousands.
Harry apparated into a deserted, grey street. It was early afternoon, but the light made it seem like evening already, the skies were heavy with rain and the days had already become so much shorter since summer. Worn down brick buildings with curtained windows stared down at him from either side of the road. Harry fished the note out of his pocket and checked the address again. It was the right place he had apparated to, but maybe he had written it down wrong… He scanned the numbers on the houses, then headed towards number 10. If this wasn't the right place, he would just go home, take it as a sign from the universe that this was a bad idea.
When the Dark Lord’s snake ate the muggle studies professor it had been almost like self-hypnotism. He had not been present at all. He remembered seeing it and sometimes he dreamt about it, but he could not remember being scared or feeling anything at all while it happened. Even if he had thrown up in the bathroom afterwards. So that was what he did now. He didn’t want to talk about what had happened during the holidays, he didn’t want to care, and here was Potter caring way too much and wanting him to care as well, so he switched off the part of himself that could. It was the dignified alternative to storming out of the room and slamming the door behind him.
Draco watched her wand slide out of her sleeve and into her hand. That was bad, if she wore a forearm holster she probably knew how to duel – she might even have been in Potter’s secret fan club last year.
Harry nodded, then left the pub and made his way back up to the castle under the looming, grey skies that promised more rain to come. As he crossed over the grounds from the gates to the main entrance, he decided that the meeting, in retrospect, hadn’t been all that terrible.
“Well you see, that’s how it works with fights. Before the fight people get along and afterwards they don’t,” he explained.
Draco had claimed the armchair by the fireplace in the elegant Slytherin common room and was flipping through the
Draco let go of his arm and Potter made it about two wobbly steps before he tripped over the curb and Draco grabbed him again.
He reached his building, dragged himself up the stairs, switched on the light and dropped his keys on his desk. He was already halfway to the bathroom when the phone rang.
Then he noticed the light ahead of them. It spilled down the top of the stairs, not the flickering, orange light from the torches, but the silver glow of patronuses. None of them said anything, but they sped up.
"How do you know I don't? I have colleagues, and… oh, fuck it," Malfoy cut himself off, the nonchalance of his tone falling away. "I'm allowed to do magic, but it's being monitored, so I've been trying to minimize it. The Ministry likes to use the statute of secrecy as an excuse to harass me."
“I’m the one who brought it up in the first place,” he said. “And I haven’t really been doing my part of the heroics these last few years. It would look pretty bad if I tried to pull out, wouldn’t it? I can’t imagine the Weasleys letting me get away with that.”
Draco didn’t want to repeat his mistake from before the holidays and try to get a hold of Potter when he was with his friends. At least after the episode in the astronomy tower, Draco hadn’t been in the wrong, no matter how angry Potter had been. This time he didn’t think Potter would tell his friends to leave them alone if Draco approached them. He probably wouldn’t even interfere if they tried to curse him. And when once it had seemed that he couldn’t even walk down a corridor without running into Potter, he now never saw him on his own. He was always surrounded by a group of friends or flanked by Granger and at least one Weasley. Draco managed to slip him a note during one of their potions lessons, but Potter incinerated it on his desk without even looking in Draco’s direction. There was no chance he could make him listen, not even for long enough to attempt an apology. He waited anxiously for his chance but it didn’t come, and the sense of urgency that had resided in him ever since he left McGonagall’s office did not help his patience. So he decided to do something stupid.
“Honestly, I miss you being captain, Harry. It’s too weird with Ginny – I can’t take orders from my little sister.”
“Oh nothing, just having a friendly conversation with Potter in front of half the students in our year,” he said, not even trying to suppress his smirk.
"Right, you'll just hang around here until they show up and then politely explain the situation?” Malfoy said scathingly. “I'm sure that's exactly how you want to spend your afternoon."
“So maybe the dementors and the tower are the same sort of thing,” she said. “And so the dementors have reach as well. Then, even if a patronus keeps them from feeding on one person, they would still be able to feed on other people who are far away. And the way it goes cold around them could mean that they’re able to suck something out of the air too, maybe magic or something else that’s left behind by people, and that’s why they feel so
“You called her a mudblood. Remember how you said you didn’t use that word anymore? Must have slipped your mind. But I suppose some things are hard to unlearn.”
Over a deserted stretch of the East coast of Great Britain, seagulls circled like flecks of ash against the white and colourless December sky. A small house was cowering on top of the dunes, balancing precariously on the edge of a hill that was slowly being eaten away by the sea below. Draco and his mother were making their way towards it. Their black cloaks whipped around them as if the wind was trying to hold on to them and drag them away from the shore.
The second time it happens is in the quidditch changing rooms. Harry has been out flying and when he comes back, Draco is there getting changed, about to go out. For a couple of seconds, it’s quiet and awkward, the two of them staring at each other, alone together for the first time since the incident. And then Draco starts saying shit. And Harry pushes him up against the lockers, and maybe he hadn’t meant to kiss him, but he does. Draco tries to lean forward, but every time Harry slams him back against the lockers, and he likes the noise and he likes how it feels like a fight. Then Draco reaches for his trousers again and puts a hand on Harry’s chest, and Harry lets himself be pushed gently back so Draco has enough space to get to his knees.
“I just wanted them to find out the right way. And I wanted… I liked that it could be easy between us.”
“Fine,” she said and turned to leave. Granger didn’t say anything until she was gone, then she pointed to an open door a bit further down the hall.
“If you don’t get back to Gryffindor soon you will have singlehandedly exposed this little endeavour of ours less than four days after its outset.”
“Which part? The one where you drunk-apparated me halfway across London without my consent? Or the bit where you nearly threw up on my dragon-leather shoes?"
When he reached the pub, the soft drizzle had turned into heavy rain. Harry ducked inside and slammed the door behind him. He tried to shake the rain out of his robes and unwrapped the scarf from his head, which had kept his hair mostly dry. The pub was almost empty and of course Malfoy wasn’t there. Harry could hear the rain hammering down on the roof and ricocheting from the windows when caught by a particularly strong gust of wind – trying to get back to the others at The Three Broomsticks would be ridiculous. He would just have to stay until the rain stopped and hope that Malfoy had only gotten cold feet or regretted his invitation and not bothered to tell Harry, and that this wasn’t some stupid trick meant to get him in trouble, like the things he had pulled when they were younger. Feeling both irritated and immensely stupid, Harry went up to the counter to order a butterbeer.
Part of him even wished Potter had stayed with the Weasley girl. Then Draco would probably have followed Pansy's advice and actually made an effort to move on. Instead he had seen that magazine article, had realized that Potter wasn't going straight down the road to contented, Weasley-esque domesticity, and the stupid idea of Potter, heartbroken and adrift, had spread in his mind like a plague. The idea that maybe he could see him again, maybe he could show that he was different now, that he had grown up at least a little bit, that he had left the Manor and then… then nothing. He knew Pansy considered him completely delusional when it came to Potter, but it had been a very long time since he had managed, even in the privacy of his own mind, to take it beyond anything other than chilly forgiveness. A slightly better ending. Turned out even that had been too far-fetched.
“No, people who have been confunded have a hard time keeping track of time and will often have difficulties with complex conversations,” said Hermione, reflexively quoting one of their charms books.
Harry finished cleaning up the spilled juice and pushed the soggy napkins together in an orange lump on the table. He ate the rest of his breakfast as fast as he could and finished before any of his friends. His heart was still thrumming when he left the Great Hall.
Harry had always wondered at how different the process of moving into Hogwarts at the beginning of a school year was from moving everyone out at the end of one. There was a certain order and ceremony to returning to Hogwarts after the holidays, as everyone slipped into the order of years and houses, prefects and professors, but when summer approached, each day of good weather seemed like a reminder that school rules would soon be suspended, that they were approaching two months of freedom and no homework. There was a very persistent, school wide agreement among the students that you couldn’t get detentions when the O.W.L’s and N.E.W.T’s were over – Harry had never heard any of the teachers confirm it, but that didn’t seem to matter. As soon as the fifth and seventh years had sat their exams, respect for school rules was replaced by a rapidly spreading restlessness, a giddy longing for summer, which peaked in the last week of school in the form of late night common room parties, skipping classes for impromptu quidditch matches and a broad variety of Weasley-inspired shenanigans. The professors still detracted house points, but otherwise didn’t do much to rein it in. The end of school chaos had long ago become a tradition that no one bothered trying to contain.
“It doesn’t sound very likely that he’s plotting something against Harry either. The war probably took its toll on him too, it makes sense if he acts a bit different this year.”
!” Harry cried, and the red light caught the auror in the chest and threw him back against the wall.
rang out in the corridor, they stabbed through Draco and he ignored it perfectly as he kept on walking – which meant he was yanked backwards when Pansy stopped and was only inches from crashing into Blaise as he spun round, his wand already out and aimed at the girl’s back.
“You’re being cynical for the sake of being cynical. Why can’t you believe that I’m actually trying to do something good? Why is that so hard to imagine?”
Lupin is the last one still awake in the evening when Harry finally heads upstairs. He can hear him in the kitchen. There’s a sound of cabinets opening, the clink of glass.
“Would you calm down?” he asked. “If I had known you treasured your personal space that much I wouldn’t have invaded, but that’s no need to get bloody violent.”
But there was nothing about Azkaban. The front page was mostly taken up by an article dedicated to the Gringotts tax conflict that had filled the news for the past week. Draco scanned the smaller headlines of other articles, and there was still nothing.
Harry strode briskly across the front yard of Grimmauld Place and into the street. He had forgotten to grab his scarf and the air was cold around his neck. He was being stupid, he knew that. He just didn't care very much right then. In the time since he had quit the aurors, memories of Sirius popped into Harry's mind more and more often. How everyone had been telling him to stay inside, stay hidden, not to be stupid. Grimmauld Place wasn't the same oppressive, musty monument to old pureblood traditions that it had been back when the Order used it, and besides, Harry was free to leave the house whenever he wanted, but there were days he spent pacing the old hallways, feeling like he was going crazy with doing nothing, where he couldn't help but think that this must have been how Sirius had felt in the last months he was alive. The house was huge, but it still made him feel trapped. And sometimes, like today, that feeling only got worse because Ron and Hermione were in there with him, with their concern and all the subjects they carefully avoided right until they didn't.
It was a thin excuse, especially since Draco hoped desperately he would be able to stay mostly out of any fights, but he was curious. They turned to watch the duels going on around them, the loud cracks of magic and flashes of light seeming closer now that they weren’t duelling themselves anymore.
”I know, but we’re not that old either. You said your mother was with you in Azkaban. She saw how horrible it was, she saw all the same things you did, but does she want to destroy it?”
Harry watches paralyzed and hidden under the invisibility cloak when Dumbledore offers to hide Draco from Voldemort, and there isn’t any part of him that doesn’t wish for Malfoy to accept.
He could hear him breathing. There was something strangely intimate about it. When he spoke again, his voice sounded even more strained.
It was so light and thin, so smooth it felt watery in a way that reminded him of the invisibility cloak. It was hard for his eyes to focus. It took him a second to realize that Malfoy was looking weirdly at him. The apology was ready on his lips immediately:
But they still end up in the Hog’s Head and they all expect him to be something that he isn’t – it was all just dumb luck, it was help from the right people at the right time. Cho is looking at him the whole time and all he can think about is how Cedric died anyway.
“Sometimes people go to Azkaban without a trial,” said Malfoy. “It has happened, especially during the wars.”
When he came back, Draco and Mark were gone and Harry felt his stomach drop inexplicably. The rest of the group were still at the table, louder now, and Harry considered leaving then. But his coat was still on the back of his chair, he would have to go and get it, and then he would have to make up some kind of excuse for why he was leaving that wasn't just "Malfoy isn't here anymore."
something. Potter hadn't actually wanted to kiss him. Because Potter still hated him. And Potter wasn't gay. Draco knew that. He knew
“We just thought we’d try sitting over here today,” she said. “You know, everyone has been switching around a lot at the house tables this year so…”
Most of his friends from Hogwarts had found out he had some kind of muggle job, but Pansy was the only one who knew what he actually did. She had been laughing herself into hysterics thinking about him saying "good morning" and "how may I help you?" to perfect strangers all day, and he had fed her with stories of his misery, but he never told her about this: that when he went into the tiny closet they called the back room and put on his stupid, green apron, he became invisible. When he went back out there and stood behind the counter, he wasn't Draco Malfoy to anyone. None of them knew of his father or his family, they didn't know about the war or about Voldemort. Even if they came in every single day, most of them wouldn't even remember his face. He was Draco to his coworkers, and to everyone else he was just the bloke at Starbucks who handed them their coffee. And it was such a relief every single time.
Draco watched the Gryffindor table from across the Great Hall. Pansy was talking to him, but he was only half listening. Potter, the Weasleys and Dean Thomas got up from their seats and left, presumably for quidditch practice. They were really playing an older team this year, strong players too, but it would be hard on Gryffindor when all of them graduated this summer. Potter looked tense, but then he always did these days. Draco glanced back to the table, and his eyes met Granger’s. She was staring right at him. He quickly turned his attention back to Pansy, nodding as if he had any idea what she was going on about, But Granger had definitely seen him looking.
And a second later he didn’t care anymore – he caught Harry grinning excitedly at them as if he had already won and Draco felt a rush of adrenaline like the one that would hit him during quidditch matches when he knew both of them had spotted the snitch. He raised his wand, unable to keep a smile off his own face.
trying to off you, I imagine peace and quiet has left you bored half to death. What have you even been doing since you left the aurors?"
Since then he’s been moved from safehouse to safehouse, and he has been wondering about Potter. Of course he has. He’s been trying to piece together what his plan is from the fragments of conversation he’s overheard, but no one talks much when he’s around.
“That’s not true, though,” Harry says quietly, and then presses on when Draco opens his mouth to protest: “It isn’t! I’m not saying everything would have been different if I’d known, alright? I don’t know that it would. Like I said, things were a mess back then, and honestly, they still are. But it wasn’t nothing to me. And I… I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t figure it out.”
He wasn't looking at Harry though. He had his eyes trained on his beer as he picked at the label, meticulously peeling it off.
Blaise’s wrist twitched and a sharp, blue light whipped out at the girl. Her wand snapped into place.
“Did it – did it work?” asked Granger, forever the practical one; she wouldn’t pretend to be more worried than necessary.
“That’s good. Now, your throat should be completely healed. You might feel a bit sore right after eating, but you should have no trouble breathing or speaking. If you do, come see me again immediately.”
“I didn’t tell anyone. I was just testing to see if I was right, and I wasn’t. It’s not like it was anything important, I would’ve told you if I thought it mattered.”
“I remember that, because I was looking right at him,” she said. “I asked him to help me, in between the curses. And he just stood there, completely unaffected.”
"That's really a phrase reserved for smokers," Draco said, content that he at least sounded more in control of his tongue than Potter did. "You're not going to vomit on me, are you?"
She skimmed the last few lines of the letter she was holding, then put it away in a drawer. Draco glanced around the office - it was lined with bookcases and well furnished, but not exactly lavish or elegant in the way the Slytherin common room was. He was sure there had to be quite a few powerful and valuable magical artefacts in there, but apart from the sorting hat lying on its shelf and Godric Gryffindor’s sword in its glass case, most of them must have been put away in the many cupboards and cabinets. He wondered how much the current headmistress had changed it. It didn’t seem like the sort of room Albus Dumbledore could have inhabited, but it made perfect sense that professor McGonagall’s office would be practical rather than impressive.
house. There was no way he was turning around to go back there, so he just kept walking. He felt drained, exhausted. The cold had seeped into his bones and he just wanted to curl up in his bed and sleep forever. He was pretty sure he was sober by now. That didn't make any of it feel more real.
The boggart appeared to hesitate, to linger for a moment, before its shape collapsed and dissolved into something like smoke or thick mist. It retreated into the darkness of the wardrobe, and Potter slammed the door shut.
He gestured vaguely. He hated this. He hated realizing that there were lasting influences from being raised by the Dursleys that he still hadn’t managed to shed. Whenever he thought he must have escaped, little things would show up and betray him. They would be habits or aspects of what he considered knowledge that it had never occurred to him to question or trace to their source. Like how when they were younger he used to stow away food from the feast, until Hermione caught him at it and forced him to explain why. Or like this moment when once again her keen eyes were trained on him and he had to fight his sudden, violent distaste for Dean and Seamus because the
And then Ron pulls him aside with a self-satisfied grin to give him his gift in private. Harry unwraps the book and it’s like a punch to the gut – it takes him a second to get himself under control enough to realize that of course this isn’t some sick joke, and for a moment he just stares stupidly at the title:
He waited until the lesson was almost over. His own potion was looking perfect, and more importantly, Potter looked like he was satisfied with his result as well. There was only about ten minutes left until they would be asked to turn their potions in and clean up when Draco left his station and sauntered over to the Gryffindor half of the classroom. He could pretend he was just on his way to get a glass vial for his potion, but it wasn’t really important. It wasn’t like he wanted to get away with it.
“Are you serious?” he said. “You have been bothering everyone for years! You insult Ron’s family all the time and you wrote that stupid song about him when he became Gryffindor keeper-“
"Oh, shut up," Draco snapped. "Anyway, Potter, these are my colleagues, who I am sure would eventually introduce themselves if we waited long enough, but how about we just get it over with now?"
He didn’t bother knocking. He knew she was waiting for him anyway. She stood by one of the windows with her arms crossed and her gaze turned to the landscape outside.
“I did,” he said. “Turns out the potion works really well for me, knocks me out completely for 8 hours and leaves me well-rested the next morning. It just has the unfortunate side effect of giving me very vivid dreams.”
He stood by the railing and was looking down to the floor below. Harry went over to look with him. He could see billowing fog and dementors down there and it took him a second to realize what Draco meant. There were still dementors down there, but now there were also spaces where they weren’t; holes in the mass of bodies. They hadn’t been there when they came down.
“You grew up with muggles,” he said. “Right. I forgot. They don’t like that sort of thing, is that what it is? Very uptight about it? Honestly, I always thought it was just a myth, like the one that they heal people by sewing up their wounds with string…”
“Don’t worry, nobody will find out,” said Ron. “And besides, it was about time someone beat him up. Just putting that out there.”
He still wasn't looking at her. He kept his eyes on his hands as he buttoned up his coat, but he could feel her looking at him, could feel the disapproving frown like a tremor in the air between them.
Draco didn’t tell either of them about his father. He ought to have told Pansy, but he couldn’t stand the thought of that conversation. He didn’t want to tell anyone.
They left Azkaban. Their wands were returned to them back at the small house by the coast. They apparated to St. Mungo’s, but there is no treatment for dementor exposure except chocolate and rest, and after being told this several times by a healer, Narcissa took Draco with her back to the manor.
“What? Don’t look at me like I don’t understand things when I am the only person here who’s being sensible!”
"No," he said. "Of course not. That is literally the only thing I've told the reporters. I don't know why they don't print it, they're usually so eager to publish any dumb thing I say."
“I know everyone feels unsafe with Slytherins out after dark,” he drawled, “but I just had detention with the headmistress and I am headed back to the dungeon right now, so you don’t have to worry. I do appreciate that you’re taking time to patrol the hallways, though. We all feel much safer knowing you’re watching over us at night.”
He had thought the stack of books she had gathered was pretty big, but if that was everything relevant she had been able to find in the whole library, it wasn’t a lot. She might have searched too narrowly and he was about to tell her that, when she pushed a piece of parchment across the table towards him.
"Maybe they decided against it when they realized there wouldn't be room for half the heroic shit we've done. Most of these guys are at least four times our age, and they’ve got nothing on us. After this year, I think my real résumé is starting to look more impressive than Lockhart’s fake one."
“She’s excellent. She’s really at ease with it. I think it might be from the DA, her running it last year and all that.”
“He had an invisibility cloak? All this time? And then that map…” He looked at Pansy. “You see how everything is starting to make sense?”
On the days before Christmas it was mostly Weasley relatives who filled the house. Bill and Fleur came home, and Charlie and Percy as well. They visited graves on Christmas day, when the distant relatives had left and Andromeda had arrived with Teddy. That day was heavy, but afterwards everyone seemed to breathe easier.
But a day passes and then another, and Draco doesn’t come storming back down the stairs to demand a nicer living space or complain about the lack of luxury. They hardly see him at all. He stays in his attic room almost all the time. Harry isn’t planning on talking to him, he hardly looks at him either, though he feels Draco's eyes on him like a cold prickling every time they happen to be in the same room.
“You’ve been telling me I was wrong about him for years. Every time I thought he was up to something
So what if he does? If, when he lowers his wand, he has another second before the rest of the Death Eaters burst through the doors, and he makes the right choice?
, and some people can get away with that, fucking Potter senior got up to all sorts of shit when he was in school, but he got to grow up to be a man and a hero, and maybe you’ll get to do that too, but I’ll be
They apparated as close to the school as they could, then walked up the path the rest of the way to the gate. Between the columns, two people were waiting for them. One was holding a lantern that illuminated his mountainous size. The man looked wild and uncultured, like he was only partly human and not far from reverting back to some wild animal state. Draco wasn’t a child anymore, but the groundskeeper still made him uncomfortable. He looked down at them when they approached, the light catching in the black eyes hidden in the wild thicket of hair. Next to him was Draco’s head of house, Professor Slughorn, who looked very cultured and very tiny next to the half-giant.
It was an eternity before she turned to look at him. His chest felt cramped. Words stuck in his throat but he held her gaze and hoped she knew him well enough to read the
He fought hard to suppress his smile at that and for a second it looked like she was about to laugh about it too, but then she got control of herself.
There were fewer insults thrown at him and no hexes at all – he knew they had not stopped out of pity but because they were satisfied. No one cared much exactly what had happened to him. The important part was that he had been pacified. And Draco didn’t mind being left alone. It allowed him to sleepwalk.
“First off,” continued Granger. “I think we should discuss the option of a political solution to this. If there is any possibility at all of getting legislation passed to remove the dementors, then that’s definitely better than turning this into some dangerous, illegal mission. We have to at least consider the option that we don’t have to do this all by ourselves.”
There was a worn plastic entryphone by the door, peeling labels with the names of the people living there next to the doorbell. And there at the bottom was one that said "Malfoy". Harry stared at it. He had begun to hope that he had made a mistake, that he could just go home to the warmth of Grimmauld Place and feel that at least he had made an effort. But this was apparently it. He hesitated, finger hovering over the button, then took a deep breath and pressed it down.
“I’m very sorry about this, Granger,” he said. “Potter. Weasley. You are very welcome at our table.”
“Nah, I just wanted to fry some eggs, I haven’t had time to make proper breakfast in a while. There’s tea as well.”
It was like a punch in the stomach. Harry glanced at Malfoy, expecting to see his own disappointment mirrored in his face, but instead Malfoy was smiling. A wry, bitterly amused smile, like this was exactly what he had expected.
return my books on time, too. I’ve never damaged a book either and I’ve used the library more than anyone else.”
“I know, but it looks like it might rain soon. We could circle back over Hogsmeade and walk up to the castle that way? Maybe speed up a bit?”
“It’s just nice to know that you do have friends. Honestly, I’ve been thinking about what you said about allies in Slytherin. It’s been bothering me. I wouldn’t know what to do with someone who doesn’t have any real friends. I’d probably have to believe everything Hermione says about you, so it’s nice when you act like a person.”
The part of himself that could objectively monitor his actions was disgusted with this development. The imaginary version of Pansy that lived in his head was gagging. He was very aware of how pathetic this all was.
“Manners, Potter. You are our saviour after all, you could at least try to act like you weren’t raised in a barn, so as not to embarrass the rest of us.”
“And I’m saving you from starvation, that’s my hard-earned salary you’re putting on your toast there,” said Ron, with a grin snatching the jam out of Harry’s reach.
“All the Slytherins were cowards.” Ginny said. “If you had just fought back with the rest of us, or at least showed some defiance, fucking anything, instead of just sucking up to get phony praise and special treatment, then-“
“A war,” he said. “Something like a war, it was all in his memories. And the dementors are feeding on him. He’s the source.”
Harry looked away from him and avoiding Neville’s gaze too, as he was pretty sure he was looking at him just as reproachfully. It was strange that it felt like Malfoy was the only one in the room who wasn’t against him.
Half an hour later he watched his owl soar soundlessly out of one of the owlery windows. The sky was black and starless, and he quickly lost sight of her in the dark.
"This way, then," Malfoy said sharply, and was suddenly striding away from Harry, the sharp clack of his shoes heading back the way they had come.
“So… last year we defeated Voldemort, and we thought that was the end of the war - no, it was the end, but now there’s something else out there, and I think we have to stop it, because no one else is going to try this time. It’s not a dark wizard. It’s something the Ministry is responsible for. That’s why Malfoy is here. He asked me to help him with this, and I said I would.”
“That’s a nice thought, but coming from someone who lived his whole life according to a prophecy and some silly, old man pulling the strings, it sounds a bit hollow, doesn’t it? You waltz around with all your morals and heroic deeds and you might have saved everyone, but you were pushed in that direction. When we were 14, you didn’t make the decision to defy the Dark Lord, even if you think you did. You were Dumbledore’s puppet, and you had all those order members pointing you in that direction, telling you that was the right thing to do, and you believed them, because that’s what kids do: They believe the things adults tell them.”
He closed his eyes for a second. Alright. He had been here before. He could do this. Slowly, he pushed himself upright and swung his feet onto the floor. He swallowed hard, waited for the pounding in his head to subside. Then he pulled the drawer in his bedside table open. He should really clean it out, it was full of all sorts of detritus he had no idea where had even come from - there were a couple of official-looking letters, broken quills and dried out ink-wells, a pair of socks for some reason, and in between all the mess, a handful of phials, each about the size of his finger. All of them unsealed and empty with only a hint of purple residue left clinging to the inside of the glass. Harry swore under his breath. He fumbled around in there for a second before he gave up and pulled the whole drawer out, dumping its contents on the floor. There was a heavy clonk as the ceremonial silver pocket watch from the Ministry hit the floor. The empty phials clattered out as well, and a single, still-full one rolled over the floor. Harry snatched it up before it could disappear under the bed. He peeled off the seal and emptied the potion into his mouth, swallowed and then leaned forward on his knees and waited. There was a pleasant, burning sensation in his throat. It tingled along the back of his neck, over his scalp. Slowly, the fog over his mind lifted. His headache settled down. His nausea melted away. His stomach growled. He hadn't even noticed how hungry he was. And thirsty too. Hangover potions didn't fix the dehydration. His neck still ached from how he'd been sleeping on it funny, but there wasn't much he could do about that. He got up, pulled some fairly clean-looking clothes from the pile on the floor and headed for the bathroom.
He stopped the pounding immediately. Pansy stood in the doorway, watching him with her arms crossed in front of her.
”Oh, we should have bought something for Professor McGonagall!” said Hermione when she saw it. ”Why didn’t we think of that?”
“Nott?” he asked, without looking up from the letter in his hands. “Do you remember the name of that sixth year who says he can smuggle anything in?”
“Do you want to see if I can cast the spell here because it’s dark and eerie? You do realize my common room is in the dungeons, right?”
“Alright,” said Hermione before the two of them could start fighting again. “It’ll just be Malfoy, then.”
As soon as they left, Maya covered her face with her hands and her shoulders were shaking with laughter.
He felt compelled to go get his broom and take off immediately. Maybe if he had been in Gryffindor, that was what he would have done. Instead, he made his way to the secret room.
Draco exhaled a sigh of relief. He sat down on the edge of a table and forced himself to relax his shoulders. He tried to think of the next thing to say – to seal the exchange before Potter took back his words, or just something to move them on, so they could put this whole embarrassing mess behind them. He could feel his heart pounding. He was glad they didn’t have an audience. Usually, that was what he wanted when he conversed with Potter, but this felt important in its own right. Potter still had his bag slung over his shoulder, but he looked like he had forgotten that he had been about to leave.
He turned around and left while Harry stood there for a moment, looking after him. He watched him go and felt at the same time immensely frustrated and also inexplicably disappointed.
arrived the following morning and suddenly no one cared much about something as silly as school gossip and unexpected displays of inter house unity, because plastered across the front page were the news that the prison of Azkaban had been infiltrated and all the dementors destroyed.
“No, I just bought it for you. You said it yourself that you didn’t know me and that lots of things have changed. Well, I can’t say I know you very well either.”
Malfoy shrugged. It was pouring down now. Apparently the spell didn’t protect their shoes or the hems of their robes from getting soaked by the tiny rivers and muddy deltas forming in the gravel that splashed around them as they walked. He heard Malfoy laughing softly.
He looked out the window again just as the train started to pull out of the station. The platform was a sea of faces and waving hands. In fact, he hadn’t even opened most of the letters she had sent him. He hadn’t wanted to deal with the world, and that had meant Pansy too.
