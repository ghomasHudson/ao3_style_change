“Yeah, I was a bit too late with picking one, but, between you and me,” Harry plucked up some of his Gryffindor courage and leaned in a bit closer. “I was almost sorted into Slytherin,” he whispered before leaning back.
“Well it took a lot of convincing but I managed to get your mystery date to
Malfoy looked at Harry in a complete loss of words. “I said all of that and that’s what you took away from it? You are unbelievable Potter.”
The first shadow chuckled. “Oh you will.”
try to be back as soon as possible! I hope you've been enjoying the story uptill now because trust me it's only gonna get juicier from here ;) (at least I hope you'll like what I'm working on as much as I like working on it)
Blaise shrugged. “You don’t, but look around, do you see many other options?”
“So,” Harry started, as the waltz progressed. “what should I call you?”
“Just let me help you Draco”
“How can I move on when I’m going to have this thing to constantly remind me” Draco exclaims
“I don’t know Potter,” Draco says. “How do we change that”
Narcissa chuckles. “It’s okay to cry darling”
Ginny shakes her head. “If i were more careful-”
He leaps into Harry's arms and Harry catches him
Worry
“Looks great guys, thank you” Harry smiles
“Gather your things Mr Malfoy, you are discharged” the healer says before leaving the room as Harry yells “Cowards!”
Narcissa and Pansy stare down at him. “Answer the man” Narcissa says curious at how long this has been going on, and she can see right through Draco if he lies
“That’s not true Miss Parkinson,” Lucius narrows his eyes. “They are my family, i would never do that and that’s not what i think”
The healer’s ramble snaps to a stop as she tries to stutter out apologies to Potter who says something however Draco’s breathing hitches and his surroundings sound far away and like he’s drowning underwater.
Fury flares through Narcissa but looking at her son's broken form, she takes a deep breath. ‘I have to be here for Draco’ she thinks to herself. Narcissa places a hand on Draco’s cheek and raises his head back up to look at her. “This,” she starts. “Is not your fault”
All three are positive
Thank you all for the comments, kudos, and everything. Please be careful of triggers, this story has triggering content
“Oh, nothing, nothing interesting”
“Malfoy, it’s me” he hears Potters voice call out to him
They sprint towards each other, meeting at the middle of the stage and Draco flies into spinning hug as Harry grasps him and spins him around
But Harry is determined. “Yes you made mistakes, we all do, we’re all human after all, but what counts and matters is that we learn from them, that we don’t make the same mistakes again,” he says. “In Malfoy manor, you learned from your mistake and chose not to reveal that it was me they snatched, and you’re still learning from them, for example by trying to get on with Hermione and Ron, by getting on with me, trying to be the best person you can be”
Dr Jones shuts the door behind her and gestures for Harry to take a seat. "So how have you been doing?"
“That’s not something about yourself”
“At least tell me you’re going to look after it”
"That is terrible," Dr Jones states with a deep frown. "Well I'm willing to talk to my colleagues and if none is willing, I'll take him on"
“Got it,” Draco says before turning around to face Hermione, who’s next to him, and Ron and Harry who are at the table playing chess. “Thank you for allowing me to stay here, i...er, i appreciate it” he says loud enough for them all to hear
“Does it actually help?”
“I’m alright mother, Potter is being very nice to me”
Harry glares at Ron. “It’s fine, it’s my turn to make it, and I don't need anyone's help,” he says before looking at Draco. “Go rest”
“Wow,” Harry deadpans. “You’ve really hurt my feeling there” he sarcastically says with a chuckle
“Yes of course darling”
“Why?”
Before Draco can retort, Ron’s and Hermione’s soft chuckles fill the room. “What?” Harry stares between them
It's captivating
Draco crosses his arms and looks away with a pout. “Then you’re the most...the most…annoying person i’ve ever met”
“I don’t want this monster inside of me, yes i’m sure”
“You are officially around one month into your pregnancy, the first trimester,” the doctor says. “You hear that sound?” the doctor asks with a small smile. The sound of a rapid beat fills the room. “That’s your baby’s heartbeat”
“Because,” Harry starts. “I know you, and I know you’re strong enough to get through this, and you’re not alone in this,” he says, watching as Draco’s features turn to doubt. “Come on, dinner must be getting cold”
“Oh,” Draco says, suddenly remembering something. “Guess who i saw in the supermarket today”
Once the shuffling stops and Draco says “I’m done, you can turn around now”, Harry slowly turns back around to face Draco sending him a small tight smile before it falters slightly. “You know, we should appeal against this, this is not fair and--”
“Anyway, i’ll leave for you to get dressed” Harry says before leaving the room and shutting the door behind him
“How can i know you’re not going to just laugh at me, or mock me”
Pansy blinks. “Wait,” she holds a hand up. “Are you telling me he…”
“I didn’t mean to--”
Draco looks at Harry carefully. "Do you need space? Should i leave?"
“At the front desk, make an appointment for an ultrasound next month”
Draco scoffs. “Er yes you do, i’ll even buy a recorder and record you for next time”
Harry jumps to a stand. “He’s not a death eater”
They haven't had the best start
“Mine are, it depends on what you talk about really”
“--No buts,” Harry cuts him off. Staring deeply into those stormy grey eyes Harry firmly says “It is not your fault”
Draco gets packing and once he’s done, he apparates with Potter to his house
Narcissa wipes Draco’s tears. “Now now,” she says. “Let’s not cry right now”
"Draco Malfoy? From your school years?"
'Did she run away? Did she run away, i don't know'
“Good luck!” Pansy calls out
Harry crosses his arms. “Well, if you don’t want my help, then i’ll just go then shall i”
Draco lowers his gaze. "I'm sorry"
“A small one but--”
Draco coughs. “Er right, sorry mother,” he says, bowing his head. “It’s great to see you”
Narcissa nods. “Okay fine, but if something happens…”
“I understand Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says. “But there will be three of us and we will look after him, we won’t allow him to harm himself, and part of recovery is also having alone time and being with friends”
“With who?”
Dr Jones uncrosses her legs and leans forward. "Did anything else happen that you want to talk about?"
Pansy sends him a look. “Ha ha i know that”
Draco shits his eyes not to look into Potter’s eyes, but tries to take deep breaths. Heart calming down, Draco takes a final deep breath before opening his eyes, jolting back when he sees Potter’s face so close to his.
“Mr Malfoy,” a doctor comes to where he’s eating some bread with soup in a room. “The results came back that you’re pregnant, are you aware of this?”
“Oi,” Weasley stands but is pulled back by Granger. “Don’t talk to her like that, just because you gained weight--”
“You know,” she says. “What the dark lord did…”
Ron frowns with a thoughtful hum. "I don't know man. And don't worry, therapists have a legal obligation to keep things confidential. I'll talk to my therapist who's a witch about you needing one and I'll see what they say--only if you're actually up to seeing one and won't chicken out last minute"
The next day Draco wakes up with a soft sigh. He flutters his eyes open to see beams of sunlight shining through the sides of the curtains. He turns around to see Harry still sleeping, his features soft and relaxed, unlike the usual tenseness that is around Harry. Soft snores escaping Harry's mouth fill the otherwise quiet room. Draco smiles staring at how relaxed Harry is, how soft and calm he is.
Harry sighs. "I don't know? All of the above I guess"
Draco's laugh dies down and he frowns. "Granger and Potter said once that it would be best and that they actually help," Draco says. "Though I really don't want to talk about my issues with strangers"
Draco shoves a spoonful of cereal in his mouth to avoid replying however Ron is not finished.
“Okay, well you are free to go home”
Draco beams. “I know right”
“Everything okay?” his mother questions
Dr Jones leans back and crosses her legs. "I'm all ears"
They apparate to an alleyway near the hospital and make their way.
Draco has enough of Weasley's stare and rolls his eyes turning to him. "What are you staring at?"
“Forget the lunch,” Harry says. “What’s on your mind?”
He wraps a bandage around his arm, wincing at the stinging which flares over his arm. Once done, Draco grabs his things and makes his way to the front door. On the way, Draco slowly stops in his tracks when he spots the Hogwarts letter still on the table. He still has to write back on whether he’s going back or not. Hell, he still has to make his mind up.
Narcissa sends him a smile. “I am,” she says, pulling him into a hug. “Thank you, Draco”
Draco groans leaning back as the healer walks towards them. “Ah, I see you’ve awakened Draco”
Hermione sighs. “I was just thinking and wondering, but it’s nothing”
The man fans his face with his hands. “Sorry, it’s just you’re amazing, you defeated you know who”
The clinic building is tall and intimidating, Draco feels like an ant compared to it. Walking inside, Draco walks up to reception and applies to wait for a slot to open up today.
"Yeah" Ron moves his gaze to the TV to which Draco is grateful as the air becomes tense and he can't keep the eye contact up.
Arriving at the muggle pharmacy after driving like a mad man, Draco grabs three pregnancy tests and ignores the strange look from the cashier, before driving back home and racing to the bathroom and doing the pregnancy tests
Potter turns his head to him and those fierce green eyes look at him dead in the eye. “Who did it?”
“But clearly trying to forget is not helping if you have constant nightmares--i can tell as you have dark circles under your eyes. I talk about my nightmares and it helps”
Hermione chuckles as Ron says “Yeah you do mate”
Pansy shrugs.
Entering a small coffee shop, he sighs taking in the warm heat flushing across his cold face. Making his way to the line, he spots Potter sitting at a table all by himself. Draco hums at the sight of Potter's wild mop of hair and bright green eyes focused on a book.
As Harry pulls him close, Draco feels his breath leave him as he stares into those stormy eyes.
“And what now,” Pansy says. “Just because Draco is pregnant with the dark lord's baby you want something to do with him--”
Harry smiles. “So,” he starts. “Tell me something."
“Right, and how long have you been self-harming?”
“--I’m not keeping it” Draco cuts her off
Draco sighs, dropping the letter onto the table. Glancing at the time, his eyes widen. “Shit,” he curses. “I’m going to be late”
“Well then why is your stomach--” Weasley starts
“I love you, my little dragon”
was there… ,” Harry wandered off, the sentence he had started, fading away.
“Oh, well it’s convenient for a few reasons, while we’re under attack especially: firstly injured patients can rest here while having lesser risk of getting attacked by the opposite party, secondly,” she said as a Blaise-like grin formed on her face. “sometimes we hide here, making it seem like the Amortentia is deserted. Greedy people or even people that had already been wanting to attack us come here expecting an easy cash grab,” she
This was when Harry was reminded of the deal he’d made with Blaise: he would leave the ship today, and exchange the seas for the land once again. Somehow something that he’d been so sure of just two weeks ago now seemed a bit hollow. The people of the Amortentia had treated him almost like an equal, not like someone that needed to be chased down or trapped and that was strange to say the least, yet, he knew that he wasn’t and never would be a
“If you wanted hospitality, you shouldn’t have come to pirates.” Harry immediately recognised the accent of the voice to be Eduardo’s. And he turned out to be right because Eduardo was standing right behind them.
“So, anyway Blaise was standing there literally holding a candle, the hot wax dripping on his fingers, and I kid you not, he passed the burning candle to Neville as if it was a bomb, and Neville gave the candle to Eduardo, and so a chain reaction suddenly formed, everyone passing the damn candle to each other, until Loony eventually caught it and calmly walked to the main deck to throw it in the sea while her hands were burning. She had burns for weeks after that.”
“Hi Urium and hi Kiran!”
was the Captain and only stopped when Harry and he were mere centimeters apart. “Come,” Blaise said. “I believe it’s time you and the Captain have a
“What if I can’t think of anything?” Harry whispered.
After another three hours of practising Luna called it a day and told him to head to bed in that mysterious airy voice of hers. “It really is a matter of
Somehow Zabini’s grin grew. “Oh,” he said. “but it very much is, you see, my friend, the one who wanted me to ask you, doesn’t quite admit it, but we all know that they’re actually very excited. I just wanted to check, for them of course, if you’ve already got everything in order.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry smiled broadly and took his hand into his, pulling the man towards the middle of the dance floor, and let his grin grow even wider at the slight red blush on the pale cheeks of the stranger.
“But you aren’t here, you’re just in my head, hardly counts as m-meeting,” Harry gritted out, the pain threatening to take over completely. As confused as he was, Harry did realise that the man hadn’t been here. Right?
“I can do it!” another voice answered, as a red haired man covered in freckles came running towards Blaise and Harry. From the corner of his eye Harry could see Luna’s smile grow wider, as if she’d accomplished something.
“What you experienced,” a voice said, the crew splitting like the red sea to let the person who had spoken through. “was very much a near death experience.” Harry had expected that it had been the Captain speaking, but instead it was Blaise, his voice serious and dangerous in a way that Harry hadn’t heard from him before. “And contrary to popular belief: we
For the second time that night he felt the Captain’s eyes on him, but this time they felt different: somehow even more intense as a question seemed to be buried deep within that gaze, inspecting Harry much like Pansy would.
Eduardo smiled at Harry. “Oh yeah, we met.” He turned back towards Ron, the smile fading from his lips, his features now serious. “I heard your conversation. I could give him a job in the kitchen.”
was the infirmary.
Draco he was-”
Until…
longer but that would mean that it was too much hehe (it would've become like 5k words if not more). Anyways thank you for reading and I'll catch ya next time ;)
Harry nodded and followed Eduardo to the kitchen, but not before he had been forced into promising Pansy that he would stop by the infirmary later.
Harry smiled against Malfoy’s lips. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”
from jumping him.
In fact Harry was in so much awe that he spoke. “The stars truly are beautiful aren’t they?”
The man that had emerged from the fire suddenly spoke, distracting Harry from the scream. “So, it seems that you are here. Finally.”
Sometimes he even felt his scars, almost as if they were alive: whenever he used his powers the scars would light up and slightly rise on his skin, and other times when he felt emotions very intensely the scars would slightly glow, creating an almost ethereal shimmer. Lily had always said that that was when he looked the most alive.
Luna winked at Harry. "Don't mind him Em, he's just a bit stressed right now," she added before leaving him behind and helping others to prepare for the storm to come.
As Harry looked at the Captain for a second he saw that a frown had formed on his face, creasing his eyebrows. The Captain gave no further reply though, and as their conversation died down the first light of day started showing.
Harry told the lightning.
"Captain!" the dark boy yelled, his gaze still pinned to Harry. "You might wanna see this!"
“I don’t want the wizarding world to know, they’ll probably find out it’s the dark lords and I can't have that. Besides, I don’t plan on keeping it after the birth,” Draco says much to Narcissa’s surprise. “I plan on giving it up for adoption”
The air grows thicker and an looming silence glooms over them.
“It’s going fine” Harry and Hermione say at the same time Ron says “He’s a prat”
“Is that why you live in the muggle world?”
Hermione sits down besides Ron after putting the rest of the shopping away. "But if you feel like you're a danger to yourself if you're left alone or won't be safe then we can change our plans," she says. "We don't want any harm to come to you"
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sighs. "I can't promise something like that Potter"
Thank you so much for all the comments, they make my day
Draco nods. “Right”
The healer starts asking a bunch of questions with a small patient smile and Draco answers
“He’s been through a lot, just cut him some slack”
Hermione nods. “Even you”
Potter blinks. “Are you pregnant, Mrs Malfoy?” he asks bluntly
Harry jolts and races after him. “Wait!” he yells across the corridor.
“I can’t be pregnant,” he states out loud to himself. “I haven’t had sex in over a year” he furrows his eyebrows until a memory flashes through him and stops him dead in his tracks.
“And you don’t want to have any contact? None at all?” Potter questions
Before Draco can reply, Narcissa appears from behind him saying “Hello Mr Potter, what a pleasure to meet you”
“I’m going to get rid of it” Draco picks the knife up and continues to cut the meat
“Draco...are you okay?” he hears Harry’s concerned voice question
Draco starts the day by making a huge breakfast, his stomach growling and rumbling as the smell of pancakes fills the air. He plops a few stacks of pancakes on his plate and drowns them in maple syrup before placing a few strawberries over it. Rubbing his hands together, his mouth salivating at the sight of the pancakes, Draco cuts into the stack and takes a huge bite, practically moaning at the taste which overcomes his mouth.
Draco smiles slightly. “That’s true,” he says. “But i wasn’t safe there, people kept attacking me and no one wanted to hire a death eater, and surely at Hogwarts, it will be the same”
“Yeah, let’s go” Draco grabs his bag and makes his way out the door.
Before Harry could start an argument with Ron about it, Draco cuts in saying “Whatever happened, i’m thankful and im your debt for allowing me to stay”
Draco and Hermione look at Harry with worried eyes. “Yeah,” Hermione says. “Please be honest with us, we just want the best for you”
Draco gives a single nod to each of them before making his way to the bedroom and flopping onto the bed with a deep sigh, allowing his consciousness to drift away.
“Like I said Potter,” Draco starts glaring into those green eyes. “I live in the muggle world”
“No, i understand why you did that, if i were in your shoes i don’t know what i’d do either, or if i’d get to that point, but i probably couldn’t considering all the people who died for me in the war, i can’t let them down or have their deaths be in vain by giving up”
Potter nods with a tight smile. “Anyway, i should get going. My offer still stands about whether you want to go baby shopping with me and Ginny…”
Draco shakes his head. “It’s with him…” he whispers
Ron scoffs which makes Draco glare at him
Draco flinches at the cold liquid being rubbed on his stomach but settles down once the doctor puts the ultrasound scanner on the lower part of his belly.
Harry looks at Draco. “We’ll be there in a minute”
Draco sighs in relief when Potter leans back, away from being so close to his face. He glances around to find that Rita Skeeter is not in the room. “Where is she?” he bites his lip so hard blood comes out
He sits up and jolts at the sight of some blue eyes staring at him from the other sofa. "Weasley, were you watching me sleep?" Draco scrunches his face
Harry gulps under her hard gaze, but answers honestly. “I will hope one day we will be”
The next day, while Draco is at the table staring at a blank piece of paper. He bites his lip remembering what his mother told him yesterday.
Draco chuckles. “The telly”
Narcissa takes a deep breath. “Darling i only want what’s best for you, i hate to admit it...but i’m scared, i can’t lose you” she says sincerely
He then makes his way to the kitchen to eat something before work. Putting his work clothes on, he notices in the mirror that his stomach is sticking out a bit. Biting his lip, he squints his eyes shut to try and drown away the feeling of disgust which fills him from his stomach.
Draco grasps his stomach and drops to the floor leaning over the toilet and vomiting. Draco wipes away tears forming in his eyes, as he stands wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and making his way to where the pregnancy tests lay
Draco stares at her and sees she’s genuine. “I would like that too” he says
Draco walks out of the bedroom to find Harry, Ron and Hermione huddled in a small circle talking in hushed whispers. He stares at them when they all jump and whirl around to him.
Hermione sends Ron a small smile. “Ron is right, though it is easier said than done”
“What about my stomach?” Draco whirls around and stomps towards them
Harry sits besides Draco on the bed, making Draco huff and slide further away from Harry. Trying not to lose his temper Harry takes a deep breath through his nose and out through his mouth. “We want to help, talking helps you know, just tell me what’s wrong”
Ginny sends him a single nod, and without another word Draco leaves
Potter's forest-green eyes look up to him. “Hi Malfoy,” he says before narrowing his eyes. “Don’t you know you should ask before sitting at someone's table”
“Well, I can't keep living here that’s for sure since Skeeter now knows where I live,” he says. “Maybe I’ll move back in with mother at the manor, but she’s so overbearing and makes me constantly think about the baby when i just want to forget this thing exists”
Pansy stares at him with a tight smile. “I understand,” she says. “But, what are you going to do about you know what”
“I’m good” Draco shakes his head
“Yes you were, you just said I'm running away from my problems."
“Why? It wasn’t your fault” Harry says
Harry full on laughs and Draco stares at him, his face warming up as a soft pink blush flushes on his cheeks. Draco notices for the first time the small freckles dotted around Harry’s dark skin and his green eyes full of life have different shades of green.
Harry tries to resist sighing but fails as he sighs deeply as the stranger gushes before him
“But this is also your child darling, who’s to say it will be like the dark lord”
“--Can we please stop talking about this, i just want to forget for now” Draco cuts her off
“Okay,” Harry says, grabbing Draco’s chips and pouring them onto his own plate. “But don’t complain that you’re hungry later on”
Narcissa slaps his shoulder. “Hey it’s true,” she says. “And when you’re a father, you’ll know what I mean."
Harry huffs. “They don’t want to look over a death eater”
Or is it going to burn out before it even starts
It’s three o’clock in the morning
The razor glares at him
Draco blinks. “Huh?”
“Probably, but it may be a good chance to get on with your life”
“--So allowing Snape to kill Dumbledore was just a ‘mistake’ then” Draco cuts him off
The mop of dark curly hair turns around to reveal Harry Potter making Draco's mouth drop but quickly turns back into a sneer. “Well well well, if it isn’t saint Potter”
Making his way to the dining table with Potter, Draco sits and starts to eat his food along with Harry, Chatting every so often about random things which soon turn to hushed bickering before starting a new subject and repeating the cycle. Once done, Draco goes to wash the dishes and Harry follows.
A flash of a fiery flame flares across Draco’s stomach and up to his chest. Anger burning through him. “Why?” he looks up now in despair, a pit forming in his stomach. “Why did this have to happen, why? It was bad enough the dark lord…” he trails off unable to say the words. “But now, this?”
It’s not until loud ringing slices through the silence, startling both Draco and Narcissa out of their thoughts. Like a baby deer, Draco stumbles to a stand, and with the help of his mother, he stands and makes his way to the bedroom where his phone lays.
“Harry!” Hermione greets as Harry and Draco apparate into the living room
Once he arrives his boss exclaims “Finally!”
Draco opens his eyes. “How?”
“So what Hermione, I love food,” Ron says. “Anyway, are you two up to it? I’m thinking of watching ‘Anastasia’, it seems really interesting”
“Was it about me?” Draco dares to ask
“I do not snore” Harry insists
A hard blush creeps upon Harry’s cheeks. “Wait, no--I mean, let me make sure you get home safely”
“I know so,” Narcissa says. “Anyway, shall we watch a movie on the welly?”
Walking to it with a yawn, he scans the letter for any tricks or booby traps. Seeing that there’s none, he grabs the letter and strokes the owl's soft feathers, eyes widening when he sees the Hogwarts crest on the top. Rapidly reading through the letter as the owl flies away, he blinks and blinks again when he sees the words written upon it.
“Maybe I like torturing you,” Harry murmured before he could stop himself. Draco was right. He needed to stop wavering.
Ron leaned back on his chair. “Yeah, if you add it against your four loses last month, you might be a knut or two ahead.”
“I won’t be back,” said Welly, and disapparated.
Potter’s eyes, which had so far been interested, slammed into fury in an instant. “I told you,” he began.
“Don’t want to hear what?” Harry challenged. He’d been ready to leave a moment ago, but now Draco’s tone had touched a nerve, and he was back at Hogwarts, furious and wanting to make Draco
“What is it?” Harry asked, wary.
Malfoy leaned in, tilting his head up to meet Harry. There wasn’t time for hesitation, but that’s exactly what they did. Their lips brushed over each others’ like they weren’t sure how to proceed. It was slow and chaste and agonizing. Harry slipped off the bed until he was on his knees with Malfoy, both clutching each other and forgetting how to kiss at all.
“I have to go,” said Draco, who really did need to get out of there.
Potter seemed to remember the rose in his hand and looked down at it as though seeing it for the first time.
Malfoy had whipped the mud out of the girl’s hands, and put it near his face. “Num, num, num,” he said happily. “Some of your best work yet, Victoire! Let’s see if you can make it just as good gluten-free.”
“Nothing,” Harry said, straightening up. Draco’s eyes followed him. “I’m not going to thank you for showing basic decency, if that’s what you’re thinking,” he said, harsher than intended.
“Potter,” said Draco, coming into the entrance hall.
It happened exactly like that.
. Harry had panicked when Malfoy had been captured and stunned the man standing behind Malfoy when Harry had finally found them. Unfortunately the man had Polyjuiced them both, and Harry had learned that the hard way when he raced towards who he thought was Malfoy and took his face in his hands.
Harry knew Ron and Pansy’s property eventually hit a woods and shallow creek if you walked far enough. They could take the hedged path so no one would see them go. Ron and Pansy were drunkenly dancing their hearts out on the dance floor even though speeches were only just finished and the sun had barely set. Harry could see what would happen now: they’d spar, heal each other, maybe kiss in the gathering dusk until Harry couldn’t breathe for how impossibly relieved he was that Malfoy was here and in his arms. They’d miss dancing and dessert, but Harry wouldn’t miss a thing.
“Why don’t you have some nai wong bao?” Goyle suggested, placing a bun on his son’s plate.
“And you mustn’t forget to water the plants, Potter,” Malfoy was saying. “I know they’re spelled to get water themselves, but I find they need a little extra care, don’t you? Especially Sierra, she’s not meant for this horrible English climate.”
Harry Potter gazed across the moors, the dying landscape that surrounded Malfoy Manor. The view never failed to make him question his choices, what he was doing there. It wasn’t the bustle and energy of London, nor the mountains and forests surrounding Hogsmeade. It wasn’t the thrill of Quidditch or the sureness of Ginny’s lips on his. Malfoy Manor – like its inhabitants – was its own.
“I don’t deserve another person,” Potter said, low. “You can’t just offer yourself as a
Still angry, Harry exhaled in a rush and turned back to the track again – it was good to keep walking for a bit after a run anyway.
“Stop that, it’s not – Draco – it’s not that funny,” said Harry, trying desperately to fight his own laughter bubbling up in his chest.
Draco stopped at the foot of one of the two main staircases. “As charming as ever, I see. Did you come here just to antagonize me?”
“No, you just happen to run into the man who’s been obsessed with you for years in a gay bar and it’s totally innocent,” said Blaise.
“I said I’d do training for a few months in Stockholm,” Malfoy returned tonelessly. “You’ll be given a temporary partner here to continue with our open cases. But obviously,” said Malfoy, some nastiness working its way into his voice the way it always did when he thought he was being rejected, “I can obviously only accept Shacklebolt’s offer for myself. You of course can go up to his office, refuse his deal, and request to work with anyone but me.”
Draco Malfoy had been a mistake. Obviously. But things were not all right between Harry and Ginny, even if Draco had been removed from the equation.
Malfoy took a glance around the living room. Harry had insisted Malfoy decorate since he couldn’t care less about what his living space looked like so long as Malfoy was in it. Malfoy had the exact taste Harry assumed a rich pure-brat would, but Malfoy’d still asked Harry things like “The indigo accent pillows or plum?” or “Would you rather have sex on this sectional couch or a chaise lounge by the window?” so Harry felt like it was his too. They had elegant dark wood furniture, but the coffee and dining tables had a visible grain and a live edge, so it gave it just a hint of a rustic feel. It was fancy and cozy all at once.
“Draco, I–”
“Malfoy, thank God, I was–”
“Well, I don’t have time,” Malfoy said. “My portkey leaves in an hour.” At Harry’s shocked expression he added, “Come home and help me pack?”
Their affair had continued much the same way it had before – right down to the hideously awkward breakfasts with Lucius and Narcissa – except.
Shacklebolt’s hand stilled on the documents in front of him. Harry smiled.
Everyone knew where Harry Potter lived; half the time there was press camped out across the street, and unfortunately today was no different.
. That’s not how–”
“My goodness!” Lucius exclaimed loudly. “Someone must exit the dining room and retrieve a towel!” He fled the room, his wand abandoned next to his toast.
Draco was ready to move past it too, though he’d had very different ideas of what that looked like. The first time he’d kissed Harry, the kiss had gone on entirely too long before Harry had broken away and explained in great detail about how utterly heterosexual he was while Draco went steadily pink and tried to pretend like Harry wasn’t speaking.
Afterwards, they got dressed in comfortable silence, shooting each other the occasional grin. Draco had objected to the getting dressed part at all, but Harry didn’t want to give Lucius a heart attack by finding them like that in the library. Heart attacks were too fast for how Harry planned on killing him.
“There’s nothing you don’t deserve,” Draco told him.
“Hey,” said Malfoy, suddenly gentle and in his ear. “I’m right here. I’m all right. We’re both all right.”
“How long have you been waiting for me?” Harry asked, slowing to a light jog as he approached.
“It’s not working with Ginny,” Harry said, refusing to look up. The tea leaves looked back:
“Kiss me again,” Draco whispered, angling their faces together.
Potter watched him for a moment like he hadn’t even heard Draco speak. After a moment, he turned away, but his lips moved as he did so, and his words were lost in the downpour.
Ron nodded, but didn’t say anything for a while. Eventually he nudged Harry’s arm across the table.
Malfoy’s eyes lit up. “True,” he said slowly.
“I don’t know how you do it,” Harry told him honestly.
“Harry,” Malfoy began.
Harry stiffened. “I’ve already told you that you don’t get a say in my private life,” he growled as politely as he could.
“They don’t like being set free,” Draco continued. “And besides, where would it go? Should I offer it a living wage instead? Room and board in exchange for housework? Four weeks vacation? This isn’t the Ministry.”
Work kept him busy during the week, and Saturdays remained pub night with the Gryffindors. He and Ginny had cooled off a week or two later and had a more reasonable breakup the second time. At Harry’s insistence, Ginny even said she’d continue to live there, and promptly took the big bedroom on the third floor that Harry knew Ron had been thinking of for a nursery in a few years.
Harry was breathing hard, and he was still on edge. Still not right. He clenched his teeth and closed his eyes tight.
And that was just it. He wanted to go, maybe take his mind off things. He and Ginny had been a lot better lately; they’d grown closer since (the Veela nightmare year) since everything. She’d asked him to come. Harry’d even made sure Dawlish had taken his on-call weekend. Even Dean chatted with him now and then when Malfoy was around to take some of the edge off. They were all fine. Ginny and Dean were getting married. Harry wanted to go. Harry
Some time later – he was never sure how long – another figure stumbled out into the courtyard with him. Draco was too startled to move as Potter wheeled around and saw him.
“Well, that might be news to Potter,” Malfoy said, shooting Harry a stern look, “but I do happen to remember that.”
“You … would resign?” Shacklebolt asked. It was as close to uncertain as Harry had ever seen him.
After they won Aurors of the Year for a sixth time, Shaklebolt sent Malfoy away.
“Oh, for –” Draco let out a frustrated breath. “Come here, Welly.”
“Thanks, Lucius,” Harry said, lifting his cup.
“I want to do this right,” Harry said into the kiss. Draco’s eyes widened. “I want to be with you. I just need something from you. Tell me you want this.”
“It bothers you,” said Draco.
They Apparated to their flat. Harry sat on the bed in a state of numb shock which Malfoy hurried around the room, throwing things into a trunk and explaining the situation in a little more detail. Harry didn’t catch it all, but he heard enough – three or four months, special clearance, secure location, limited contact, no visits. And he was leaving in ten minutes.
A timid house elf opened the door when Harry knocked. He almost left right then. Who where the Malfoys to keep an elf when they had treated their last one so terribly? He hadn’t come here with anger, but he felt it now all right.
Except Hermione was excelling at work, Dean was going to be a father any day now, George’s shop had gone from booming to exploding, Hogwarts was years in the past, and Ron was actually mature enough to handle the occasional shock. Harry was a grown-ass adult, and he could date whoever he pleased. Why the hell not?
“Malfoy,” Harry said again. “Come here.”
“Like you were any different,” Draco shot back. “I thought you liked having your dirty little secret.” He still hadn’t moved away.
Harry sent his cot crashing into the back of the tent, which had clearly been reinforced by magic. The cot crumpled like the cheap tin it was with a satisfying sound. Shacklebolt had just left, and the medic who’d just been coming through the flap to check on them beat a hasty retreat.
He knew Malfoy always lashed out disproportionately when he was angry or hurt, but Harry hadn’t thought he’d have that thrown in his face after all this time.
“Yeah,” Harry said, barely believing this was happening.
Ron looked back. “That’s lucky. That means both of you probably messed up,” he said. Hermione choked into her tea.
“I know.”
After an agonizing pause, Potter reached forward and took the offered rose. Cameras flashed.
Harry had just failed to do anything with the piece of mud and leaf cake that Bill and Fleur’s daughter had just offered him at Ron and Pansy’s wedding. Where the child had found mud in the shining sea of pristine white tents and crystal accents in Ron and Pansy’s backyard was anyone’s guess, but Harry took it. When saying thank you wasn’t enough for the girl’s expectant eyes, Harry handed it back to her. The girl looked crushed.
Draco had only gone to the Hogwarts reunion for the Lost Class – those who weren’t able to graduate because of the war – because his mother insisted enough time had passed for the Malfoys to begin making their way into society again. Obviously Lucius would remain at home, but Draco reluctantly took his mother’s arm and allowed her to apparate them to Hogsmeade.
Harry sighed. “I think I might get a point for distracting the kidnapper with gay feelings,” he said.
“Meant anything?” Draco bit out. “Like what? Something so precious that it warrants walking out for no reason every few months?”
“It’s a man,” Harry told them, looking up at last.
Potter didn’t kill him, but his eyes turned wary in an instant. Still, Draco wasn’t missing the opportunity to help Potter, a crazy life debt that could not be repaid by a near-drowning conversation, but Draco was still going to try.
Potter’s anger had subsided, but Draco couldn’t quite discern the expression on Potter’s face now. Maybe because he couldn’t quite meet Potter’s eyes.
“I didn’t want to, he forced me, i was too pathetically scared to fight back, so i let him”
“Draco,” Narcissa softly says. “Please, I just want to help, I want the best for you,” she says before looking at Harry. “I’m sure Mr Potter does as well”
Draco stares right back at Ron. "They're out early," he comments to which Ron nods. "So it's just you and me"
'If she ran away, if she ran away come back home'
“Savior complex, survivors guilt” Draco states
Harry stares at him. “Is it really that bad, or are you being over dramatic as always”
Harry turns to him. “That’s your problem Malfoy, you don’t face your problems, you run away from them, you must face them”
“There’s no one else” Draco sobs
Draco furrows his eyebrows. “Hello?” he questions, wondering if the line went down
'If you're scared...'
“How did you find it, i thought i lost it…” he trails off
“But what about me?”
As a final resort, he casts a pregnancy test spell and it comes up as positive
Harry and Draco walk down the street in comfortable silence.
“It's not that i don’t like it, it’s that I’m not welcome or wanted”
As he fumbles to click the piece together, Draco bites his lip until the pendant is clipped around his neck. He fumbles with the pendant, trailing his hands over the outlines of the M. “Thank you” he smiles
Pulling his shirt down he sighs making his way to the kitchen and preparing some toast with jam. A knock at his door startles him and he opens it to reveal his mother. “What are you doing here?” Draco questions
The healer walks away and Pansy turns to Draco. “Since sixth year?!” she exclaims, her voice laced with pain. “How could I not have noticed”
“Whatever Potter” Draco says but his heart starts to pound harder in his chest, nerves filling his stomach
“I’m fine”
“And what was he doing there?”
Narcissa holds Draco’s shoulders tighter and looks at him straight in the eyes, moving her head to force her son to look at her back in the eyes. Draco’s eyes are watery with tears and distant. “Draco, look at me,” she says firmly. “Everything will be alright, take deep breaths for me”
This is it
Narcissa takes Draco’s face into her hands, cupping his cheeks. “Because,” she starts. “You’re strong and i know you can get through this”
As Draco lays down, he lifts his shirt up to reveal his swollen stomach and the doctor places the gel on it. Draco refuses to look at the screen where the image of his baby lays, but Narcissa is wide eyes staring at the monitor taking in the image
“Huh?”
As they turn the corner and enter the room, Draco buries his head in his hands with a loud groan. “Great, now they know I'm pregnant”
“What’s wrong Draco?” Narcissa looks at her son carefully
“I’m meant to be on my period, but it hasn't come yet, but menstruation never made me vomit before…” he trails off to himself starting to feel a bit of dysphoria
"Help!" she screeches to the healers.
Draco sighs. “Nothing,” he says. “Anyway, what can i get you?”
“What?!” Pansy exclaims
Draco wakes up in a cold sweat to a cold empty bed. He frowns at the loss of warmth but of course he should've expected it as he was sleeping alone on the new sofa bed. It's comfortable but he misses the warmth and comfort of another person besides him, though he would never admit it.
A thought crosses his mind which makes him stop in his tracks
Ron sits down at the table and steals a chip off Harry’s plate who exclaims an “Oi” before shoving Ron who chuckles. “So,” Ron says, glancing between Harry and Draco. “What have you two got planned for the rest of the day?”
Draco scoffs. “And how much convincing did it take”
He glides across the warm lit stage and into Harry's arms
Draco bites his lip. “Is that so”
"Sometimes talking with strangers is better than talking with people close to you," Ron shrugs. "For me it is anyway"
“Good”
Before they could continue, a voice calling out “Draco Malfoy” makes them cut their conversation short as Draco is called for the abortion.
Draco tilts his head as a sudden thought hits him. “And are you two,” he points to Ron and Hermione. “Sleeping in the same room, wait are you two together?”
Thank you for all the comments and kudos, they made my day. Also please beware of triggers
Draco narrows his eyes, it’s not until a thought rings in his head that his heart starts to pound in his chest. “Did mother speak to you?!”
The healer nods and notes it down. “Well, I’m sure you’re aware that you’ll have to be watched over for a while”
Hermione frowns. "Oh dear, I forgot about that, Ron and I were planning on doing out for lunch"
Draco gracefully sits and takes a sip of his hot chocolate. “What’re you reading?” he turns his head around to see the words upside down
“What about them?”
Narcissa squeals holding them up and barging through to the inside of the flat. She plops them on top of the table and turns to Draco with a huge beaming smile. “So,” she starts, gripping Draco’s shoulder. “I went shopping and I just couldn’t help myself”
Draco makes his way to get a tissue to wipe the blood that is on the floor, but as he bends down, he starts to feel airy and lightheaded. He sits on the floor for a moment, before kneeling before the small puddle of blood and wiping it away with the wet tissues.
Harry shakes his head. “You’re not a bother”
Harry shrugs. “I mean i’d have to talk to them first but i’m sure once they find out what happened they wouldn’t mind”
Draco rolls his eyes at Ron's bluntness
“Well,” Draco says. “I’m going to go pack i guess”
As Harry stands and makes his way to the door, Draco looks towards him from where he’s still sitting on the bed. “Thank you, Harry” Draco says sincerely
Draco frowns. “Look, I appreciate the offer but I know i won’t be welcome there, and i won’t stay where i’m not welcome”
Harry shrugs again. "It is what it is"
The doctor grabs the gel. “This will be cold” she says
Draco nods taking the tissue and shoving it into his pocket
“What do you want?” he says over the phone
His dirty hands touching him
Harry coughs. “Hermione can you show Draco to our room”
“Yes you were, you blanket hog”
He places a hand over his mouth to muffle the silent sobs. Tears streaming down his face.
Draco wakes up and suddenly a wave of rapid thoughts crashes over him. As soon as he’s conscious it seems like anxiety and thoughts never seem to leave. Draco quietly slides off the bed, careful not to wake Potter up. He gets changed and leaves a note on his side of the bed saying that he’s going to visit his mother.
“So do you if you get those nightmares” Draco bites back
The next day Harry and Draco both wake up to commotion and noise coming from outside their room.
Hermione looks at Draco who’s staring at Harry with a small soft smile. She tries to hide her knowing smile but fails as Ron questions her. She shakes her head saying “It’s nothing” before looking at Draco. “So Malfoy, how do you feel about that?” she asks
Desire
Pansy furrows her eyebrows. “What, it can’t be that bad”
“Ron” Granger glares
“This isn’t fair mother, why did Potter and Weasley have to lose their baby and why did i have to fall pregnant and be stuck with this monster growing inside me”
He stops in his tracks at the sight of an unfamiliar black owl sitting on the bars of the balcony outside with a letter in its beak.
“You don’t have to thank me for being a decent human being”
"There's a quote from a Muggle about that, 'if you're going through hell, keep going' " Dr Jones smiles slightly before adding. "Besides, why would you stop in hell"
"If you're sure?"
Draco jolts awake as a crash echoes across the flat. Fumbling for his wand, heart pounding, he throws the blanket off him and tiptoes towards the door of his room and slowly but carefully opens it, peeking his head through
“Thanks” Potter and Weasley say
“Alohomora” she conjures before her eyes blow wide in horror at the scene in front of her
Ron scoffs but nods. “Yeah”
Draco rises to a stand. “I’m going to get dressed” he makes his way to Potter's room where his clothes are hanging in a wardrobe. He shuts the door behind him once he’s in the room and puts on some red jeans with a white button up shirt before making his way to the mirror and staring at his reflection. Draco states at his small baby bump which sticks out slightly, he sighs deeply before shaking his head.
Noticing Draco shifting in his seat and fiddling with his hands, Pansy coughs and tries to think of something different to talk about. “How are you even here? Aren’t you meant to be in Azkaban” she questions before narrowing her eyes. “How did you even know we’re here?” she asks
Harry turns to see Draco hunched over himself with his arms covering his face, before Draco turns back also looking at him longingly
Ginny laughs a soft laugh despite everything. “And how’s that going?”
“What, fame too much for you?” Draco sasses
“I’m on my way right now” she then hangs up
"Merlin why?" Harry clenches his fist staring at nothing. Blinking back tears that threaten to fall, Harry jumps to a stand and bites his lip while pacing around the room. "I mean, is it too much to ask for something great"
"What?"
Sitting down, Draco serves himself the food and waits for everyone to be dished up before eating his food. The air is looming over them. Once done, Draco offers to wash the dishes but Hermione says it’s her turn and that it will be his turn next time.
Potter tilts his head, trying to piece everything together and once he’s pieced it together Potter snaps his head straight and stares at Draco with his mouth open in shock. “Wait a second, are you saying you were…” he trails off
Narcissa focuses on Draco, checking his pulse once again
Draco melts into his mother's arms, feeling safe and protected from the world. Draco feels tears swell up in his eyes. He coughs to hide a sniffle and wipes his tears behind her back right in time before she pulls back and looks at him square in the eyes.
Having enough of the stare, Draco turns to stare back at her, making flinch and move her gaze but Draco doesn’t stop there. “Is there anything i can help you with Granger” he questions
Draco stands with a roll of his eyes. “Hey Potter,” he gestures to the armchair. “Can I sit here?”
Ron moves his gaze to Draco and his features soften slightly. "We won't make fun of you, your life's a mess but so is ours, we all have our own trauma and it's not a joke"
Harry rolls his eyes. “Don’t let it get to your head”
"Which is why you don't want to live in it anymore huh?" Harry says distantly
“I can take care of myself Potter”
“Darling,” Narcissa says firmly. “It is not your fault,” she states. “If anything it’s my fault, i shouldn’t have allowed the dark lord into the house” she feels tears welling up in her eyes at the thought of what her baby went through because of her
“Nothing just wondering”
“Clearly” Draco says
Ron wraps an arm protectively around Hermione and stares Draco down. “Just leave it Malfoy, she doesn’t want to ask you anything”
“I don’t know”
Draco bites his lip, pouring milk into a bowl and then some corn flakes. "Unfortunately"
Watching the interaction from the sofa, Hermione and Ron share a look before smiling slightly as Harry and Draco leave the house still bickering. Ron shakes his head while Hermione sighs and goes back to rest her head on Ron’s shoulder.
“Yeah, let’s”
Potter doesn’t need to notice Draco fidgeting in his seat nor the air becoming tense as he just smiles. “Aren’t you excited for the baby?”
Narcissa smiles pulling Draco into a tight hug. “I’m so happy for you”
Dirty hands touching him
Draco stares between Harry and everyone else. “I don’t know, this seems like a family affair”
“Whatever,” Draco sighs. “Now that everyone found out, i have to constantly be on edge and worried that about my safety”
As he’s nearly finished with his shopping, he grabs some milk but as he’s about to grab it, someone bumps into him making the milk slip out of his hand and fall to the floor.
Draco bites his lip. "Im sorry it happened"
“Stupid baby,” he grumbles glaring at his stomach and the baby bump which is showing. “I hate you, you know,” he slaps his stomach as if it would somehow make it disappear. “I hate you”
Harry wakes up the next day with a pounding headache as the doorbell rings. He sits up and frowns when he finds the bed besides him empty. ‘Huh, I wonder where Draco is’ he thinks to himself. With a sigh, he slides his legs off the bed and stretches with a huge loud yawn. Glancing out the window, he watches as a bird lands on it’s nest with a worm in its mouth and feeds it to its children. Harry squints his eyes shut as loads of rapid thoughts run through his mind about Ginny and the baby
“Mr. Malfoy, do you have business with the Boy who Lived–”
He and Malfoy both woke up in the Auror’s makeshift camp in Scotland near where the kidnappers were suspected to be. Harry woke on a cold cot with Malfoy groggily coming to on the second cot in the burlap tent. Turns out the man had planned to let Harry take him back to their headquarters “Which is why we work as a team, Mr Potter,” Shacklebolt had reminded him.
“It’s been over four months since you saw him, Harry,” Hermione reminded him gently.
Harry came around the desk and jumped up to sit where Draco’s book had been a minute ago. “Yeah,” he said casually, “I want to know if this has meant anything to you.”
Potter’s blinking face appeared as the door opened. He was wearing a Muggle t-shirt and soft-looking jeans. Draco hadn’t thought about it a week ago at Hogwarts, but Harry Potter’s face in the faint sunlight of the morning was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. Blaise was right: Draco had been obsessed for years. But that didn’t mean he knew Potter, or
Harry ate the bacon, watched Draco, and thought,
A cold wave of dread filled Harry’s mind. Malfoy almost never called him that. Aside from a handful of times in bed, the last time he’d heard his given name from Malfoy was when his Aunt Petunia died last year, and Malfoy thought Harry was feeling something that required delicacy.
“Draco, can you tell us why–”
, that’s probably how he messed things up in the first place.”
“Who are they talking about, Daddy?” Rahim asked, turning to Crabbe.
“Don’t even think about it, Potter,” Blaise said with a smile in his voice.
Draco in the meantime whipped off a black slipper. Harry held his breath.
But now there was no Malfoy here to save Harry from Rahim, or possibly vice versa. Malfoy had been reassigned for a few months – it was supposed to be three, but Malfoy’s last letter said it could be up to six now – and now Harry was supposed to say it out loud.
Harry’s breathing went desperately shallow. “Yeah?” he asked, biting off a moan as Malfoy’s lips made their way across Harry’s jaw to his neck.
Harry stood, walked around the table and knelt next to Draco. He touched the other man’s hair briefly, and Draco looked up.
“I won’t. I’ll tell her today.”
“Take care of yourself, Potter,” Malfoy said with a small smile. It sounded like goodbye.
Rahim’s eyes lit up. “Uncle Draco!” The little boy whipped around to Harry. The two of them weren’t on bad terms, but they generally accepted that they had little in common and didn’t talk much. But Rahim seemed to have forgotten their understanding because he jumped off Crabbe and ran to Harry’s side to clutch his faded wool jumper. “Is he coming?”
Harry stayed on the floor a while. It was nice here. The floor never left him for Sweden. And it’s not like he’d be able to return to their bed without Malfoy. Harry took one look around; it was clear that he would have to move.
There was a time that Harry never thought he’d ever have this, never have Malfoy staring into his eyes, their hands clasped tight. He never thought he’d be sitting on
Never taking his eyes off Harry, Malfoy smiled. “You know, I think I can be persuaded to finish up my getting kidnapped paperwork at home,” he said, and pressed a light kiss on Harry’s lower lip.
Fleur, always loyally French, wasn’t close enough to have caught the actual words Malfoy had said, but she seemed to catch his meaning, and her head snapped their way from across the main pavilion. Malfoy waved at her, and when the girl – Victoire – giggled and ran off at the challenge, she gave a small smile in return.
This time the kisses weren’t stolen, the touches weren’t forbidden.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, low.
Because a year it had been.
“Sir,” said Malfoy. “I think I speak for both of us when I say we don’t want to leave.”
Harry would die for Rahim, but he still froze with alarm. Children just seemed like creatures he wasn’t supposed to interact with. Die for, sure. Blow bubbles with, or colour with, or play toy Quidditch with, or
“Listen,” Harry began, “my friends are waiting at my place…”
Grimmauld Place was a place of many comings and goings, party central on weekends, and residence of up to six witches and wizards at any given time. Harry and Ginny had a bedroom on the fourth floor. Ron and Hermione on the third. Harry had knocked a massive skylight into his room so it felt like being in the great hall at Hogwarts.
“Draco,” Harry said, low. Draco hadn’t given him much. Nothing, really. But Harry had come to be brave. “I’m sorry I left. I’m sorry because it was rude and you deserved an explanation, but I’m mostly sorry because I’ve missed you so much.”
“Ron, that’s no way to–”
All too soon, Potter pulled away, but his smile lingered. “Do you want to come inside for some tea?” Potter asked.
Harry met Draco’s anxious eyes. “You could try,” he said.
Malfoy quickly crossed the small distance in the tent and put his hands in Harry’s hair as though to pet it in a soothing way. Instead his hand got stuck in the tangles and he looked down at Harry in betrayal as though Malfoy didn’t know perfectly well what Harry’s hair was like.
The water turned off before Harry could come out of his thoughts. Draco’s eyes narrowed as he came back into the room, dripping water on the hardwood.
“You’re right,” Draco said abruptly, even though that’s not quite what he’d intended to say at all. “I do owe you. You didn’t have to help me. And I would do anything to repay what you’ve given me.”
“Of course not, Harry,” she said gently, putting down her chopsticks, “no one thinks that–”
The wards surrounding the Manor only allowed outgoing apparation and apparation within the building itself, so Harry appeared at the road and glanced around to see if any Muggles had been passing by. He needn’t have bothered. The closest village was thirty kilometres, and Muggles weren’t overly enchanted by the view of the near-barren landscape.
Blaise took that moment to arrive, arms encircling Draco and lips planting a kiss on Draco’s neck.
“You were in danger,” Harry told Malfoy, who would understand.
. Harry was going.
Potter did, but he pulled back almost immediately after, stepping back and untangling himself from Draco.
Harry looked up. “What?”
Harry glared at his dim sum.
? Not so much.
“And you think I can help you with that…” said Potter slowly. “Being happy, I mean.”
“Some of us think that,” Pansy put in.
. And what's worse than that?”
The book slammed shut. Draco stood, furious. “This,” he said, “
When Potter did, it was only to lean his forehead against Draco’s. Their breaths came out together. Somehow Potter’s fists had Draco’s robes, and Draco had his hands in Potter’s soaking hair.
Shacklebolt cleared his throat. “Unfortunately you’re my best Aurors,” he said, composing himself. “And I’m under pressure to separate you. It’s above my head. With your arrest records and awards, the Minister wants you to train others. Not new recruits like the disaster with your last trainee,” he added, “but seasoned Aurors who can still use professional development.”
Now things had to change again.
That made Draco pause momentarily, but his eyes narrowed even further. “Stop it.”
Harry felt the ghost of a smile cross his lips. “Yeah, I kind of was,” he admitted.
Harry ran his hands up Draco’s arms. Draco was standing almost between Harry’s legs now. Harry could feel him trembling.
“No,” said Draco, taking another breath. Just this once. Just this once don’t be a coward. “I came here to tell you that I want to be anyway.”
Even Harry joined in the laughter.
Draco, who never took anything the right way, blinked once in disbelief. “Are you s–” He looked outraged. “Fine,
– and Harry had been so thrown by the sincerity in Malfoy’s smile that he couldn’t help as his lips parted, partly in surprise, but mostly in awe. He smiled helplessly back. They stood there a moment. They didn’t kiss, but it had stuck in Harry’s mind, and, bless him, Zabini had somehow been there to capture the moment. Harry never got tired of looking at it even after seven years.
They hadn’t won every year since that first time. Once or twice they had been beaten legitimately. There was that year they got zero points each on a case, which hadn’t happened since
?” Malfoy had squeaked.
Harry ignored the faint sounds of explosions coming from George Weasley’s room, and padded into the kitchen to make tea. Ron was playing some kind of card game with Neville and Seamus at the long oak table. He saw the look on Harry’s face and threw down his cards.
“What am I to you?” Harry asked.
“Thank you, Mr Malfoy,” said Shacklebolt, the poor bastard, “now if we can–”
Ron looked at him sharply. “Well you have to tell her soon,” he said. “Even if she weren’t my sister, you still can’t go back and forth in your mind forever.”
A week of agonizing later, and Harry had turned up on the steps of Malfoy Manor. Lucius Malfoy looked terrified, and Draco’s eyes went so wide they looked like they were going to fall out of his head.
Draco nodded.
“Are you staying after all?” he asked. His voice betrayed no sign that Harry’s answer mattered to him, as always.
“Sir, what Potter no doubt means is that, while crazy, his heart of gold was in the right place,” Malfoy said. “And anyway, who’s to say I wasn’t kidnapped as part of my plan? It could have been part of my plan. I would have pretended to fall in love with my assailants, and then, on our Linen anniversary, I would have revealed myself and our dastardly plan to take them down. They would have been foiled by
“Not for a while,” Harry told Rahim, whose face fell like the time Ron sat on his toy broom.
Apparently there was enough of Harry’s hair to comb through after all, because Malfoy’s fingers were moving at the base of Harry’s neck. “It’s okay now,” Malfoy said.
“Oh my God, Zabini,” Draco snapped, not sure what Blaise was trying to do.
Well, Harry wasn’t delicate, and he certainly wasn’t about to hear whatever hideous news Malfoy clearly had being treated like a delicate flower.
Harry shook his head. “Listen, Draco–”
Harry smiled. “Maybe–”
Rahim Croyle, Crabbe and Goyle’s three-year-old chose that moment to take an interest in the conversation. “Who are you talking about?” he asked, pausing from brushing Crabbe’s hair with chopsticks.
An awkward silence had filled the kitchen, though it seemed more because everyone was waiting for Harry to act than because anyone was bothered by this news.
relationship with the kidnappers, whatever the hell that means.”
“Don’t want to hear your meandering bullshit.” Draco yanked a navy set of robes over his head. “You do this every time. Either go or stay, but stop torturing everyone with your endless qualms.”
Malfoy didn’t even pretend to be surprised by the interruption. He only slowed, shoulders sagging as though relieved Harry had stopped him.
Seamus cackled and pulled the tiny pile of knuts into his hand. “Two weeks in a row, Weasley,” he said.
“Nothing,” he said.
Harry grinned. “Maybe,” he agreed.
Potter, who never did a single thing Draco wanted, did not. “I just meant–”
“I said don’t I deserve anything else?” Potter said, not looking like he was really asking. Draco watched him a moment more and Potter’s eyes fell. “Don’t I deserve something I want?”
Somehow, the insult made Harry feel a bit calmer. He met Malfoy’s eyes one more time before he pushed out of the office. When Malfoy found him an hour later, Harry was running the track in the new training wing (now with fireproof mats).
“People break up, Harry,” he said simply.
The walk back to the disapparation zones outside the gates was long and colder than he’d ever felt. Although even days after, he could still feel the heat of Potter’s lips on his.
“I’m a trained professional,” Harry pointed out.
“You messed it up, didn’t you,” said Ron.
Harry leaned back in his chair, relaxed now that there were no tiny humans about. “I didn’t need classes to know how to fight,” he said.
Malfoy’d had an explanation for it once.
Crabbe shot Harry an apologetic look, which annoyed Harry. It wasn’t like Malfoy was
“You’re being ridiculous,” said Harry. “Why are you being ridiculous?”
“But actually,” said Malfoy, examining his nails, “I also seem to remember that my work here is done of my own free will, which I can revoke at any time.”
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” asked Potter.
Malfoy had a small curl to his mouth as though he might say something sarcastic, but his eyes were gentle, and Harry knew he wouldn’t just then. He was waiting for Harry to be all right too.
Draco could only freeze as Potter pressed the softest kiss to his lips. His eyes closed, but he could
Harry pulled back, not a lot, just far enough to look at Malfoy, to marvel in the fact that he was still here, in his arms, in front of him, looking only at Harry.
“You’re all right,” Harry said into Malfoy’s neck.
“I wasn’t thinking that,” Draco said slowly.
“It’s terrible they couldn’t give me a little more notice,” Malfoy continued, smelling a cotton shirt and making a face, “but you’ll give Flint my apologies this weekend at Quidditch, won’t you? He’ll have kittens if we cancel again, but maybe you can talk Ron or Ginny into going. Maybe in disguise, you know how Flint feels about anyone who ever played with Oliver Wood. I was also thinking that you should lend him our extra–”
Never one to outright admit when he was at fault, Malfoy looked down for a moment, then back up at Harry. “Am I?” he asked, softer this time.
It took four months before he apparated to Malfoy Manor again.
“I’ll show you forbidden,” Harry started. Malfoy grabbed his arm in a death grip.
reason for Nigel to be looking for him let alone a good one.
Harry had asked Neville the question but Pansy answered for him, her voice cold. “Four days.”
Harry arched his eyebrows in confusion. “Why track him? What’s the use?”
Eduardo's smile grew wider. "Thought so."
”Don’t know how much value you would attach to a pirate’s word, but you have my word that you can get off at the next stop,” the man said, the grin still plastered on his face.
Harry quickly did what Eduardo had asked of him and set up the last few things on the table, including an extra plate and chair for himself.
know though: it all happened because of his stupid scars.
“Really?” ‘Dorian’ asked, seeming genuinely curious and maybe a tiny bit skeptical.
Before Harry could tell him that that wasn't reassuring in the slightest, Blaise had already turned and left, walking decidedly towards the helm of the Amortentia.
The sunlight.
Harry forced his breathing to slow down, taking long breaths and letting them out again, just like Lily had taught him. Slowly something else began to dawn on him.
“Don’t what?! Don’t what Potter?!” He spit Harry’s last name out as if it was a filth that the world needed to get rid of. Harry slightly shrunk in on himself at the sound.
Venom laced the captain's voice when he spoke again, pointing a dagger, Harry hadn't even seen him pull out. "Who are you and what are you doing here?!"
Ron was fully dressed and as Harry looked around he saw that most other people had left the sleeping quarters already. Ron probably noticed Harry looking around because he scratched the back of his neck and said, “Yeah, we let you sleep in a bit, you seemed to need it.”
“Who will be happy to-” Harry couldn’t even finish his sentence or his scar started
After a while of staring she lifted her gaze up to Harry’s forehead and folded a few of his locks between her fingers, revealing his other lightning themed scar: a bolt carved into his skin, luckily without the purplish colour that his other scars had.
one of the (probably) few who

not all Slytherins are bad per say, you know. As long as Harry’s not stuck with
! About time!” He turned to Harry, completely not bothering with the spoon that was still drifting in the soup. “Common now Harry, this is your first ‘land in sight’ moment, you’ve got to experience it in full!”
Harry caught a glimpse of Ron uncomfortably sitting next to a tired Lavender as he chased Dorian down the halls, going left and right and left again, until suddenly, they were in the Sixth-floor boy’s bathroom. Harry stood by the door, not letting his presence be known as Dorian went to stand in front of one of the cracked mirrors and ripped off his mask in one angry gesture, he exhaustedly rubbed his hands over his face as his mask fell to the floor. A faint curse fell from the stranger’s lips, and with the hands covering the face, Harry
Harry never left the quarterdeck where they’d been practising, instead he sat down on the wooden floor boards and stared at the dark but calm ocean. The stars were out and bright again, endless and shimmering in their beauty as the waves peacefully crashed against the Amortentia.
A storm was on its way.
Pansy inspected his scars with a glaring intensity. “They seem to be… ” She trailed off trying to think of the right word to use. “ … alive,” she eventually settled on, seemingly confused and in awe at the same time.
smiled at Luna, it wasn’t at all like the shark grin he'd given Harry on more than one occasion. "Good thank you," Blaise said before turning back to face Harry, the toothy grin immediately back on his face. "Don't worry Potter, you're going to learn how to fight properly in no-time." And with that Blaise turned and left, leaving Harry with Luna together on the quarterdeck.
cuss words!”
“What about him?” Harry asked, indicating the blonde haired Captain, he had barely been in any of Ron’s funny adventure stories. The captain was currently standing next to Blaise, his hair shining in the sunlight and a frown gracing his features.
, flowing over the map slowly, like a snake making its way across various countries and seas.
Harry was just about to answer when he suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder.
The Captain opened the door a bit wider. "Right, come in I suppose."
Harry couldn’t help but snicker at Ron’s unfortunate practically ancient robes, earning him a desperate glare from Ron. “I’m sorry Ron, but look at it this way, no matter how ghastly your date’s dress may look, you'll always outshine her and hopefully it will comfort her to know that she could never go more wrong in her outfit than you already have.”
we’re talking about here!”
Harry arched one brow, confused as to why she was going there, the kitchen definitely didn’t secretly include the infirmary, that Harry could be sure of.
“Call me whatever you want,” the stranger said, his tone still soft, shy almost. The man was seemingly more comfortable hiding behind his mask.
Her eyes were alight as she spoke, shining a bright grey. "Of course I can train Em!"
a mystery to everyone and so are you.”
It was almost as if the pirates themselves had accepted Harry to be part of the crew already, seemingly not even remembering that Harry had made a deal with Blaise to get off at the next harbour, coincidentally the harbour of Valencia.
"Mind control," Draco said resolutely.
Pansy and Blaise moved aside and sat down at the table begrudgingly as Neville stepped into the room. “Hi Eduardo! Hi Harry!”
Harry’s lips lifted upwards the tiniest bit as he kept looking at the sky. “Can’t sleep either?”
Before Harry had time to answer, Luna answered for him, returning to Harry's side. "Oh him? That's just Em, he's with me."
"Nice try." Blaise grinned. "Loony! Can you teach Potter to fight?!" He rolled his eyes at Harry's apparent frown. "Listen lightning boy, you might be able to control the merits of storm, but you can't always use it, it's too noticeable. If we're ever attacked while you're…" Blaise paused to make some wild hand gestures at Harry, his blade swinging from his fingertips. " …present, you will need to use sword fighting first before your thunder, we can't have news spreading that you're here."
“I don’t see how that’s any of your business Zabini,” Harry said, sighing and beginning to slightly regret his decision of saying yes.
“Listen here Weasel--”
Harry told the lightning.
Dorian pulled away way too soon.
Nigel grinned widely, his teeth showing in the process. “I’ll go tell him then,” he said as he started running back towards the dungeons, his feet hitting the  floor hard.
that, ultimately, she had said yes.
like they knew something he didn’t.
. “Oh yes, I do.” And then he stepped aside to reveal…
When the sun started rising it was the most breathtaking thing Harry had ever seen, it was painstakingly slow, but
Malfoy rolling his eyes. “Good.”
Harry turned towards him, not trusting Blaise to make just small talk with him. Blaise wasn’t the small talky sort of person.
Ron immediately looked pained. “Bloody hell Harry, what am I going to do? I look like my great aunt Tessie!” He sniffed his robes briefly. “And I smell like her too!”
“You-I-I heard- ,” Harry panted out, his voice so raw that he couldn’t quite seem to grasp it.
“Harry! You’re awake! The Captain will be so excited to hear this!” Neville’s voice was filled to the brim with utter excitement.
“Always.” The voice of the man was, again, recognisable, but it was soft and careful in a way that Harry hadn’t heard before.
One of its bolts reached for Harry, stopping at his fingertips as if saying,
As soon as Zabini was done talking he was dragged away by a rather angry Malfoy.
turn towards his barrel, and in the dark he could see her gentle smile.
Harry gave a short nod, already knowing that he wasn’t going to be able to use the bed very often.
Tonight seemed to be another sleepless night for Harry, or rather, a morning, it had to be around five am already and the sun would soon start to rise. Suddenly convinced that he truly wasn’t going to get a wink of sleep for the rest of the night Harry stood up on impuls, determined to witness the sunrise. Technically the sun would probably not rise for another thirty minutes or so, but still it wasn’t like Harry had anything better to do than watch the sky right now, it wasn’t like he could sleep or something.
“Malfoy, don’t.”
“Later,” Dorian said, laughter in his eyes. “First let’s talk about your mask, Slytherin huh?”
Of course he’d managed that of all things.
Luna might've carried a shit ton of swords and knives, but her airy attitude and kind mannerisms didn't allow Harry to make the proper connection between the two seemingly opposite sides of her character.
Ron smiled. “Okay Harry, come along, we have a whole ship to show you.”
“Hey Eduardo!” both of the people who had entered, yelled happily.
their masks at the ready.
And that Harry did.
“But then what would Potter do?” Pansy asked, a cynical glint to her eyes.
Harry felt his eyes widen. “By who? You know who attacked me?”
Pansy was frowning. “You don’t remember? Draco brought you here. He was all panicked, said you were attacked by-” She cut herself off, seemingly slightly struck.
They stopped at a small wooden door, a door that Harry had walked past before, but never had paid much head to. The door had a square of orange stained glass above, letting Harry see the mere shadows of what was lurking behind.
“I mean yes, it does make one wonder,” Dorian sounded interested but somewhere in his voice was another emotion audible: sadness maybe?
One thing he
Yet, Pansy didn’t seem the slightest bit surprised as she huffed. “Positive. I should know, I’m the person who has had to tend to you.”
Harry nodded and followed the Captain inside his quarters, shutting the door behind him with a distinctive click.
Harry pulled away and frowned. “A mumbling nuisance? Really?”
to come to me, the bloody
When Harry did realize this though, he knew that he was probably in deep shit, yet again.
And as the man set his final step back into the flames, letting the fire swallow him whole, an entirely different fire enveloped Harry.
Suddenly a pale finger moved to set aside the barrel and all Harry could do was sit there, frozen, exposed. He now had a full view of the woman in front of him: blonde hair shimmering in the dim light, her eyes shining in a curious silvery grey, her smile broad and her clothes circling in loose ruffles around her.
, he told the lightning. Harry didn’t know if he’d be fine, he wasn’t sure of anything right now, but he
Harry couldn’t move, his body refused to, he was frozen to the spot, too scared to move a single muscle.
: all consideration gone, replaced by a cold stare, the distant look was a look Harry knew all too well on the Captain’s face. Harry hadn’t even realised that the hard look had been off his face for a while now until it was suddenly back up.
Far away a scream could be heard, it was a voice that Harry recognised vaguely, but not enough to name it. The tone was desperate, yet even though Harry had heard plenty of desperate, devastated tones he hadn’t heard one quite like this before. The voice screamed a name. A name that seemed to be so familiar to Harry that the edges of his mind were trying to grasp it.
Harry frowned, a bit of uncomfortable anger coiling in his belly, Pansy seemed way too indifferent to killing. “That seems unfair, shouldn’t you just face them and fight?!”
“Yeah,” Harry muttered, a slight sense of regret overtaking him.
Harry’s spirits were crushed as Cho Chang told him that she already had been asked for the Yule ball
“Interesting,” she said, before dropping his hair back down, covering the bolt shaped scar and scanning his body once again. “Yes,” she eventually said. “you definitely need to eat and sleep more.”
Until…
Blaise chuckled. “Yes Potter, we’re pirates,” he said, still grinning. Blaise pointed at something above the main mast “Can’t you see the flag?”
“Goodbye my boy, we’re letting you go,” he said while hugging Harry with all of his force.
“You can come out you know,” she said, her voice airy and light. “There’s no need to be afraid.” She didn’t look at him, keeping her focus on the rope.
He didn’t want to relive those memories in his sleep, so, his body wouldn’t let him. Not letting the dreams in sadly also meant entirely locking sleep out, and thus resulted in Harry not sleeping at all, sometimes for days even weeks on end until his body couldn’t take a single second more of it and simply collapsed.
of all people.”
The door of the kitchen opened with a creak, followed up by Ron’s excited voice “Smells good Ed!” Eduardo winked at Ron and Ron turned to Harry. “Oi mate how’s working in the kitchen so far? Hot innit?”
“Do I have to?” Harry asked, seemingly unimpressed.
Next to Blaise the Captain stood who first shared a knowing glance with Luna and then gave Harry a short nod. Ron gave Harry a short hug, Neville simply smiled and waved goodbye, Pansy nodded at him just like Draco had done and Eduardo, seemingly on impulse wrapped him in an even longer hug than Luna had.
Harry let go of Dorian in surprise as he looked at everyone around him bursting into laughter and excited dances. He let out a loud, surprised laugh, breathing in the exhilarated atmosphere in the room, next to him he caught Dorian’s grey eyes looking at him in wonder as if in awe because of Harry’s
Harry’s anger slightly subdued as he looked at the desk, instead confusion taking over. “I see a desk?”
Harry felt his frown grow more concerned, thinking back to the other people who he had seen killing so casually. Was this their mindset? Harry didn’t want it. He didn’t want any of it.
“Harry! Mate!” Ron called out from where he was standing. Harry grinned at him and walked over, trying to push all unease about the Captain aside.
“Nothing, i just want some privacy”
“Nothing much, Potter was being a prick as usual”
“Anyway,” Weasley says. “What are you both doing here?”
Through a watery smile, Narcissa helps Draco onto his feet and yanks him into a tight hug. Being swayed side to side, Draco squints his eyes shut grasping onto his mother as if it’s the last thing he’ll do. With a tight nod to himself Darco wipes his tears and pulls away from his mother.
Draco makes his way to the kitchens, but with each step getting heavier and head starting to feel light, Draco’s vision starts to blur before black overcomes him and he falls to the ground with a hard thump
Draco rolls his eyes. “I mean for eighth year”
“It is early for you to make any definite decisions but--” Narcissa starts
Draco sighs. “I have something to tell you, but it shouldn’t be over the phone”
“I could but I probably shouldn’t” Harry says
“With what?”
Draco narrows his eyes. “That’s not what you were going to ask”
The doctor sends him a tight smile. “Well we want to do an ultrasound to make sure everything is okay with the baby”
"That you won't leave me too"
“I’m good” Draco says distantly
Draco huffs. “Are you going to make me say it again”
He opens the tap for the bath and allows it to run
Potter chuckles. “It’s a book about parenting”
Losing his patience, Ron opens his mouth to say “What happened though? What do you mean you lost the baby?”
Harry smiled happily. “I’m glad you think so, and I hope in time you will consider them your friends too.”
After Harry appeared slightly more sorted, Keith asked, “Is that enough for today, Harry, or would you like to do some more work?  We have enough time for another memory, I believe.”
The party spent the rest of the evening enjoying excellent food, delicious elf-wine, and fluid, friendly conversation.  After Harry and Draco had thanked their hosts, bid them farewell, and apparated back at 12 Grimmauld Place, they pronounced the visit pleasant and successful.
“Yes, I’m sure we can come to an agreement, Draco,” Astoria said, sounding a bit sad.  “We were always civil with each other. I can’t imagine that will change now.”
Harry gave this question some thought before responding.  “I guess I could tell him that I really enjoy his company, and that I’d like him to stay at my place indefinitely,” Harry said.
“Yes,” Harry replied between mouthfuls of delicious pub style chicken curry.  “I read the materials and found the information on Experiential Trauma Therapy especially interesting.  Of all the approaches, that sounded the most promising to me.  But I was wondering how the procedures might be adjusted for a client who’s a wizard.”
Since Lucius began serving his sentence in Azkaban, Draco had noticed himself entertaining new thoughts and behaving a bit differently.  These were small changes, likely unnoticeable to people who didn’t know Draco well.  One example was that he was no longer unkind to the house elves in Malfoy Manor.  Initially he had stopped sneering and cursing at them in frustration.  Eventually he got into the habit of nodding at the house elf who served him meals and on one occasion he even muttered “Thank you” when the magical creature poured him a second cup of coffee.  The house-elf was naturally astonished and replied, “It is Roody’s duty and pleasure to serve Master Draco.”
Draco spent the rest of the afternoon playing with Scorpius and talking to him about all kinds of magical creatures—dragons, centaurs, erumpents, phoenixes, and many more.  Scorpius was fascinated by all kinds of magical beasts and already knew a great deal about them.  Draco could imagine Scorpius someday teaching the Care of Magical Creatures course at Hogwarts.  After a few hours Draco kissed his son goodbye.  He then talked briefly to Astoria about formalizing their divorce agreement, bade her farewell, and disapparated.
Hermione chimed in then.  “Excellent,” she said. “Now that decision is made, let’s figure out the details.”
“Of course not,” she said with a sly grin. “Besides Potter would probably faint if you did thank him.”
Draco was stunned, but also intrigued. “Is it helping?” he asked.
Although Harry’s relationship with Draco Malfoy had improved considerably since the end of the Second Wizarding War, no one would describe the two men as friends.  They continued to circle around each other cautiously.  While both men recognized that they were no longer bitter rivals, neither Harry nor Draco felt ready to relax his guard in the other’s presence.  It was as though each was expecting the other to shoot off a stinging hex at any moment.  They continued to address each other as “Potter” and “Malfoy,” the use of surnames not only being familiar and safe, but also reflecting the brittle nature of their relationship.
Harry chuckles. “You’re the most dramatic person i know”
Narcissa nods before watching as they take Draco away. “Why Draco why” she sobs to herself as he’s taken away by healers
“I'm going to get changed, leave or turn around”
Harry huffs while Draco narrows his eyes at them. Ron and Hermione share a look and continue to chuckle.
Potter lowers his head forcing Draco to look at him. “Everything will be alright, take deep breaths”
The not wanting to wear tops
“How do you know?” he questions
Comments give me life ;)
‘Beautiful’ is the thought that goes through Draco’s mind before he could stop it, and as soon as he thinks about it, his face scrunches. ‘What on earth am I thinking, Potter is NOT beautiful. Beautifully annoying maybe’
Draco wipes his tears with a sniffle. “Okay” he whispers.
“No, it’s not whatever,” she says. “You must believe in yourself”
“Why do you even work? You have money” Pansy questions
Harry looks at him carefully. "Will you be okay by yourself?"
In the end, they do bleed the same, they may not bleed the same colour but they still bleed
Before Draco could think twice, the door slams open with a loud bang as it hits the wall.
Draco pours the pasta into the boiling water. “What do you want to know?”
Draco nods. “Are you going to give me another lecture on why I should keep it”
"No you prat," Ron rolls his eyes. "You don't have to pretend to be okay, you're clearly not and I don't really care but I'm sure it would make Harry feel better if you didn't try to hide it"
Draco lowers his gaze in thought. “I’ll think about it”
“Fine”
“Right,” Hermione coughs. “You’ll be sharing with Harry since we only have two bedrooms” she states not asking whether it’s okay or not.
“It’s not yours either,” Harry firmly says. “If it’s anyone's it’s Voldemorts”
Draco flinches back at the bluntness and shakes his head. "I don't want you to stop doing what you want or change your plans because of me"
Draco shakes his head, trying to deny it. “No, the muggle tests are wrong,” he says. “They’re wrong” he repeats
Draco sighs
Draco glides across the room with a graceful spin before he and Harry turn to each other grasping their chest with the beat
“Not”
Ron nods. "You're my sister and best mate, I'll do anything for you both"
“It just occurred to me, I've been living in the muggle world too long,” Draco says. “Why don’t and didn’t we use transfiguration to transfigure something into a bed”
Slamming a fist on the table, Draco shakes his head. “No,” he says. “I’m not telling him, if mother wants to tell him, she can tell him herself”
Harry places a hand onto Dracos waist, gracefully gliding across the stage as the music plays softly with them
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry furrows his eyebrows and slides his legs off the bed as the door barges open and Ginny stomps inside before stopping in her tracks at the sight of Harry and Draco in bed. She shakes her head slightly and turns to Harry who jumps to a stand and races towards her when he spots tears forming in her eyes.
Harry is about to open his mouth to reply, but Ron beats him to it.
Draco stares at Potter, his eyes are full of concern and worry. Draco lowers his gaze unable to keep contact with those fierce eyes. He takes a deep breath and shuts his eyes. “I--I was…” he trails off biting his lip, unable to say the words. “I can’t do this.” He turns around and apparates to his flat unaware that Potter grabbed his wrist at the same time he apparated and is now standing with Draco in his apartment
“Yes”
“I won’t”
Draco squints his eyes further shut, however stays quiet and doesn’t respond as the healer continues to ramble on about him. It’s not until he hears a cough that he snaps his eyes open to see Potter standing at the door with a deep frown upon his face.
The hints were all there
Draco glances out to the balcony to see that the usual owl is on the bars of the balcony, the owl has been coming and going every day, waiting for Draco to give him his answer. Draco holds the piece of paper to his chest and squints his eyes shut.
Draco smirks and nods. "Sure sure"
“No,” Harry says. “I mean you must be careful when you go to Hogwarts, we won’t always be there to look out for you, so…” he trails off with a sigh. “Just be careful”
“What did you get up to today then?” Harry questions
“Where were you?” Harry questions
“--No, no talking,” Draco cuts him off. “Just leave things alone”
Draco shakes his head. “No, i just want to forget”
Draco scoffs, tempted to tell Potter what really happened to be able to prove him wrong. Instead, he says “Well, it’s not like I can change things now, so i’m going to have to deal with it”
“What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” Draco starts. “Well first, i was forced to do something i never wanted to do and now i’m stuck with the consequences, and i have a monster’s baby growing inside me and everyone keeps saying i’m being a horrible person for not wanting to be reminded of what happened” he exclaims, voice breaking and breath hitching slightly.
Positive
“Why didn’t you ever tell me?” Pansy questions distantly
Draco stares at Ron in wonder and with his eyebrows furrowed. "You'd do that for me?"
Harry sighs. “We ALL went through traumatic events, some different, some similar, however, we’ve all got each other, and we’re not alone,” he says then looks at Draco. “Even you Draco”
Draco opens his mouth to reply but shakes his head. He takes a deep breath. “The dark lord” he whispers
Harry sighs. “No, i’m not okay”
“I can feel you staring” Harry’s mumbling startles Draco out of his thoughts
“Because,” Harry starts. “I know that you don’t have a lot of support in your life right now, and you’re going through a rough time”
When he hears a door open, Harry looks up and spots his therapist smiling at him and waving him over. Harry rises to a stand and says his hellos while commenting on her new hair cut which has been cut just above the shoulders.
He shakily moves the razer to his other hand and does the same to his left wrist. His vision goes blurry before he sees all black
Harry hesitantly brings a hand up watching as Draco flinches but allows him to gently wipe away the tears streaming down his face. Harry sighs. “You didn’t deserve what happened to you, as much as you were a git, you don’t deserve that, and i’m sorry that happened to you”
“Did you mean what you said?” Draco breaks the silence
“We may not have had the best relationship or past, but I don't hate you anymore”
Right on cue, a knock at the door startles Draco out of his thoughts.
Draco opens the door to see Harry pointing his wand and sigh in relief. Draco huffs. “So what, now i can’t even go to the toilet without someone constantly being at my ass”
'If you play, i bleed the same'
Draco holds his head high. “I refuse to hide anymore like a coward, i know how to defend myself”
“No,” Draco holds his stomach with a wince. “I can’t”
Draco flutters his eyes open hissing in pain as a pain flares through his arm. Glancing around through blurry eyes, he sees that he’s in the bathroom. Sitting up against the wall, he holds a hand tightly over the open wounds across his arm with a groan. “I fainted...again,” he says to himself with a roll of the eyes. “Great” he mutters
Draco frowns at being reminded of the situation at hand, that he’s going to be a father no matter how much he hates it and tries to avoid it. “Right…” he trails off
“Honestly i was going to skip lunch, even though i’m hungry, i just feel sick to my stomach”
Harry, Ron and Draco watch as Hermione’s stern face softens as she rubs a hand over her face with a sigh. “Fine, whatever, only if Harry and Malfoy want to watch it though”
Harry nods silently but then shakes his head slightly at the fact she’s behind the door and can’t see him. “Yeah, i’ll be right there” he says
Harry hums. “Maybe find another place”
Once he’s finished peeling a mango and cutting it, he joins Pansy to watch TV in the sitting room. And that’s how they spend the rest of the day until it started to become dark and Pansy had to go home, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts
“Ginny is pregnant” Potter declares proudly with a smile
As the gentle music fills the room, Draco allows the music to overcome him as he swiftly spins to the side before diving to the ground when the beat drops
“Hello?” Pansy says over the line
“I didn’t make anyone spill their milk” Potter exclaims making a few people stare at him
Draco tries to take a deep breath but it cuts off short each time. He shakes his head in despair. “I can’t,” he croaks out. “I can’t”
“Go away!” he exclaims
“I promise not to laugh or anything”
Harry stares at him. “If i have to be honest, then so do you”
Draco shakes his head. “It’s not your fault mother”
Narcissa furrows her eyebrows. “They already discharged you Draco? But they said they were going to watch over you”
On the way back to the flat, Harry and Draco walk in a comfortable silence
She apparates to St. Mungos, heart pounding against her chest.
“She left, I kicked her out.” Potter reassures
“I don’t care about that, at least not anymore”
“Potter!” Draco hisses. “Just leave it” he says as he gets off the bed
Narcissa winces. “Not that i don’t trust them, but what if you need magical needs”
Draco holds onto his mother, holding on for dear life as tears start to fill his eyes. “I love you too mother”
Draco sighs, resting his head against the wall, looking up to the ceiling. “Great, just great” he mutters. “Now everyone is going to know what happened” he squints his eyes shut with a grimace
“Draco!” Pansy exclaims. “I’m worried now”
“Dinner is ready” Hermione says through the door
Draco gracefully runs away from Harry and jumps high as he sprints across the stage
“Hey Malfoy, ready to go?” Hermione smiles.
'If you ran away, if you ran away, come back home'
Pansy kneels before him and holds his shoulders. “Are you okay?”
Hermione leans into his touch with a soft quiet sigh as she looks at him with a smile before looking down at Harry. “How did your appointment go Harry?”
There
“No,” Potter says. “You’re not a death eater, you had no choice. And we may not have had the best past, but I plan on changing that, i don’t want to be enemies with you anymore Malfoy”
“I am not” Harry states
“Yeah, i’m fine” Harry brushes it off
“We?”
“Huh?” Harry says not hearing what she said. “What did you say?”
Doubt
Dr Jones blinks before her eyes turn sympathetic. "I'm sorry to hear that Harry"
Once they reach the hospital, Draco does some tests and answers some more questions, and the results come back that he fainted because he didn’t eat anything today.
Draco stares at her. “Why are you telling this?”
Once he’s done Draco bangs the floor with his fist and exclaims “I hate this”
After a bit of silence, Draco rolls his eyes. “What do you want Pansy”
“Yes,” Draco says. “I can't keep looking at this child and remembering what the dark lord did, not only to me but to everyone. If I weren't a coward, I would abort this thing, but what if this child ends up being like him”
Harry narrows his eyes. “Right…” he trails off as Draco turns his head sideways and refuses to look at him. “Are you going to eat the burger or not”
"Look, I don't mind you anymore," Ron states. "And I wouldn't like for something to happen to you no matter how much you piss me off sometimes"
Draco shakes his head. “I can’t,” he holds onto Pansy for dear life, as if that if he lets go he’ll sink into the ground. “I can’t do this”
Pansy sends her a look. “Mrs Malfoy, please calm down”
Ron kisses Hermione’s cheek and wraps an arm around her shoulder. “It went really well mate”
Draco holds a hand out to Harry. “It’s okay, calm down”
Draco walks to the mirror and takes his pajama shirt off. Staring at his swollen growing stomach, he sighs rubbing a hand over it, thoughts whirling through his mind. He forces his eyes away and walks towards the wardrobe and pulls out some warm fluffy jumpers. Putting on a red one, he puts on some dark denim blue jeans and looks at himself over in the mirror.
