“Erm, yeah actually,” Harry started, feeling slightly stupid, while producing the box. “I found this box and I think a Curse-Breaker should have a look at it, just to be on the safe side. So I thought I’d take it here.”
Being with Malfoy had felt familiar in a way that Harry had never anticipated and Harry realised he’d rather enjoy seeing Malfoy like that again.
So instead Harry just put the stopper back on the phial of Dittany and packed it in his pocket again.
Harry looked in its direction, where he could just make out Zabini’s, or rather Francois’, slim form leaning against a tree. Zabini had told Harry they would meet in full Glamour, like always. If someone found them like that, they would obviously be in trouble, but if they found Harry and Zabini in their normal appearances, they would most definitely be in more trouble.
After the trials they hadn’t allowed him his wand back, stating it would be returned to him after exactly
And at some point - he couldn’t even tell exactly when - Harry just drifted off to sleep again, his fingers still interlaced with Malfoy’s.
Draco smiled and he knew it was entirely too bright. “Okay,” adding, “as long as you actually go home now, to-, you know, sleep in the meantime.” Draco found he actually meant that. Harry, still in his rumpled Auror uniform, most definitely looked like he could use a good night’s sleep.
Draco spotted Potter almost the exact same moment he came in. Potter was in the club all right, facing the bar again. There was a pint of beer in front of him and he was apparently talking to the man to his right: a slender young man with somewhat dry looking auburn hair and a nose that was slightly too broad to be attractive.
Harry just scooted a bit closer to Draco on the sofa that they had somehow ended up on once more. “For what it’s worth: I don’t think you deserved it and you certainly didn’t deserve
“But especially well with Harry, of course.” Nott taunted, “Your dear Harry. How was it: finally kissing him after all this time of wanting to?” Nott’s tone was plain villainous now.
Well, it sort of felt like he was. “No, but sometimes injuries are so complex that I’m the only-” Draco stopped short. Saying what he was about to would sound too much like vanity and he tried not to go there, anymore. Astoria, for one, had hated it if he did.
When Draco came back that evening he felt slightly better. Dinner had been good and being with Astoria again had been even better. They had talked like they used to and Draco had felt completely at ease again, just like when they had still been a couple.
“Tu es revenu pour moi.” Draco knew exactly how his voice sounded in low curls of French and he definitely remembered how Potter had reacted to the language on Monday, hoping it would get his attention.
Harry focussed on Draco again. “So, how are you feeling?” He heard his voice sound soft, as if he was afraid to startle Draco back into his dreams again.
“I’d rather not, if it’s all the same to you,” Draco deadpanned, the words out before he could reign them in. “Let’s pretend I didn’t just say that. And yes, that would be Penelope.”
It was a dance they’d performed before, multiple times, and really this wasn’t the worst of it. Smith had started the school year hexing Draco whenever he’d had the chance and although Draco had consequently learnt to cast protective spells with an ease that left the other students sorely lacking, he wasn’t entirely sure he hadn’t deserved the hexes, the occasional curse.
“Did you see Draco outside? He was in here, but he went out before you, you know?” Harry smiled. He didn’t think he would ever get used to Luna’s uncanny ability to observe things no one else saw, or, granted, sometimes things no one else could actually see.
But now it was Friday and when Draco walked past the Ministry canteen to get to Training, Potter just made it out of there. It had been like that three Fridays in as many weeks. Like clockwork.
where I’ve been.” His voice was cold. “You know exactly-.” He also sounded extremely tired, his voice cracking a little at the end and Harry only now noticed he was very pale, swaying a bit.
Right. So now he didn’t just like his Auror partner a bit too much, but he’d also, at the very least, hinted at it to said partner.
When Harry woke up to sunlight seeping through the curtains, the night seemed far off, but he knew it had happened: the nightmare, the screaming, Malfoy’s unexpectedly comforting presence. Harry turned to find the other end of the bed now conspicuously empty, though, Malfoy apparently having retreated to his own makeshift mattress some time during the night. He was still sleeping.
“I know,” Harry said, lightly kissing Draco’s neck now, “So it makes perfect sense to take a shower together. Saves us time.”
might not like it. Draco’s smile was much too wide, when he realised. “No, that’s fine,” Draco answered next, having toned down his initial enthusiasm enough to sound almost bored. “Let’s make it Wednesday, however. That would suit me better.”
And suddenly Harry decided he’d had enough. He swallowed the rest of his beer down in one and made it to the dance floor without a second thought. The way he bumped into the man behind Malfoy was probably a bit too much, but Harry found he didn’t care. This week Malfoy was his responsibility and he’d be damned if Malfoy was going to pull anyone now. That just wouldn’t do. He was practically in custody for fuck’s sake.
Draco’s lunch break on Wednesday had been utterly boring: he’d known he liked having lunch with Harry, he just hadn’t realised how much.
“Yeah okay, see you tomorrow,” Harry finally managed, before getting out of Malfoy’s office and back to the Ministry canteen.
It was like that was all David had wanted to hear before giving in to the pain that must have been there since the projectile had hit him and Harry suddenly found himself on his knees in front of the boy, trying to keep him upright. “David, do you happen to know who the Cartel’s leader is? Or-, or anything else that could be of help to us?”
On the weekend Harry hadn’t been to the gay club Blaise had recommended, instead he had spent his weekend as he usually had for the past six months: doing up the rooms of Grimmauld Place that he and Ginny hadn’t come around to redecorating over the past years yet. The only other place he’d been had been the Burrow for Sunday lunch.
They were both more than a little drunk when they tumbled out of Harry’s Floo. Malfoy was so unstable that he almost launched himself into a chair and Harry grabbed on, glad to have a way of steadying himself a bit in the process too.
“How did you-?” Zabini started to ask Harry, then obviously changed his mind. “No, not important. I’m glad Corentin’s here. If there is anyone who can find the counter-curse to this, it’s him.”
Harry registered, however, that Malfoy had apparently Floo-ed in, because he came in through the door. They could Apparate straight into their suite, but, this being a mostly Muggle hotel, there was no Floo in here: the only Floo in the hotel being in a separate room that could be opened by the right spell. Malfoy usually preferred Apparating, but he had evidently used the Floo room now.
Now it was Draco who pulled him in, their kiss tender at first, but very soon starting to get needy, almost desperate, like it could never, ever be quite enough.
“Mr Malfoy actually was obliviated,” Harry told him, just a slight bit of victory hiding in his voice. “The Healer at St Mungo’s was absolutely clear on that. I even have a written statement.” He waved the piece of parchment at Terry, slightly more of the victory creeping in.
Malfoy smiled a little. “I mean exactly like by a Fidelius Charm. I’m its Keeper and as you remember I’ve told you where we were going just before we got there.”
Harry was openly laughing. “It’s not the spell, you pillock. It’s the caster, as you well know.” His eyes were on Draco now, soft with laughter. “You even have paint on your face. If you go on like this you’ll be just as blue as your walls by the time we’re done.” Draco knew he should have felt offended, but there was a remarkably gentle quality to Harry’s words, that rendered Draco completely incapable of any such thing.
“I’m supposed to tell you to have lunch and then have a look at the assignment you’ll be working on as of next week,” the efficient looking wizard said, dropping a file on their desk. “Have fun.” And with a smile that said their case would probably be as much fun as watching a blade of grass grow, the wizard left them to it.
And most importantly of all he told Blaise about how Draco had suddenly left. Too late for Harry to catch up.
The surprise on Zabini’s face grew into something like amusement. “Did you now? Really?” It came with a smile that was so Slytherin it made Harry uncomfortable. It was like Zabini knew something Harry wasn’t privy to, but that Harry should have known all the same. “But yes, Claude. He’s helped him in more ways than one.”
Harry just nodded now, still watching Draco intently. Then he suddenly moved closer and for one breathtaking moment Draco thought Harry was going to touch his face. He didn’t though, touching Draco’s shoulder instead. It was light and fleeting, but it left Draco’s skin tingling violently all the same, even through the layers of clothing.
Draco unfurled them, apparently instinctively knowing how to, carefully releasing Harry - who was still unconscious - to the medical staff. When they took Harry away to be treated, he followed without thinking.
He shouldn’t have been worried about being seen though, because everybody’s attention was on Malfoy, who, Harry knew, was teaching their first years now.
Bacon – okay, not as good as his own had been, but close – eggs, toast and even a tiny bowl of jam. Harry ate it all, quickly washing it down with a healthy amount of tea. Then he made for the Floo.
This shield was why Harry wasn’t too bothered by Nott pointing his wand again, until Nott changed direction at the last moment and pointed it at Draco.
“Well …, I might actually have hers. If she hasn’t changed it, that is.” Draco sounded even more quiet now and Harry could only watch him in utter surprise, so Draco apparently felt obliged to explain. “I got myself cursed about six or seven years ago, badly enough to have to seek medical attention. She eventually treated me.”
Penelope watched him with a small, but approving smile. “Yes, they are. So, what do we do about them?”
“It basically is what it says, though,” Malfoy continued. “It’s a way to project a whole constellation around you. As you probably know the Blacks have always been rather preoccupied with stars and constellations. But as I said before: it’s best if I just show you.”
“Ah, there you are Mr Potter,” an elderly witch greeted him as he walked to her desk just in front of the space that was going to be his office for the foreseeable future. “I’m Agatha McKendrick,” she introduced herself, “and I’m your secretary.”
It left Harry a bit unsettled, but not in a bad way per se. Perhaps they really would be able to be professional about this.
Draco had assumed Potter would have been glad to be rid of him by now. He’d thought Potter would come to his senses, finish his pint and do whatever he’d been planning to do in the first place: when Draco hadn’t shown up yet, when Potter’d been talking to that other man.
Harry only realised he’d been transfixed on Draco, just lying there, when he heard the sound of one Apparition, then two: the attackers were leaving, so he dropped his Disillusionment Charm, immediately casting an
Zabini had asked Harry to meet him at ten, so that’s when Harry Apparated to the coordinates he’d been given.
“Thinking, Potter?” Draco’s voice was so close that Harry could actually feel his breath hot against his ear. Apparently he had sneaked up behind Harry after putting their orders in. “You know your Auror mode is not allowed in here. No thinking tonight.” Harry could hear the smile to Draco’s voice, warm and genuine. He turned towards it without thinking, like a sunflower to the sun, finding Draco’s lips again, his whole world zooming in to just this.
Draco did feel the eyes on him, though. Ministry employees staring at him in what would undoubtedly be varying degrees of repulsion.
So Draco decided to cover his losses, getting up again quickly, which was when Potter noticed him. “You’re here already.” Potter’s voice sounded bright. Okay, so perhaps he hadn’t forgotten.
“Sleep well?” Potter came in, actually sounding rather cheery levitating a large tray behind him. “I didn’t know how you’d be feeling, so I decided we could have breakfast here.”
“Yeah, I know. I’m not completely stupid. I just-, well, before I saw you in that club, I would never have thought you’d be gay.”
“Yes. So now you’ve seen my whole fantastic, but still empty flat, can I have my locket back, please?” Draco, much to his own satisfaction, had successfully reverted back to his usual, arrogant drawl.
Not that there had been that much to ignore, really. Draco had been rather successful at evading people over the years.
Malfoy seemed to know exactly how his Muggle phone worked and he explained elaborately. Harry knew he wouldn’t remember half of it, but it was nice all the same. While he was explaining Malfoy’s eyes lit up, pure liquid silver, and his enthusiasm, especially for something so completely Muggle, held a surprising attraction all its own.
Draco had thought it would be awkward, working alongside someone who would probably not be too happy about having to babysit a Junior on this really simple case - well that, plus the trust issues his past usually elicited - but it hadn’t been.
Draco nodded very slowly. He had wanted this to happen, had hoped it would, but now it did happen he found he had started to doubt himself. He was tired and hadn’t eaten for a while, what if this wasn’t real?
Today was Thursday and the rest of the week had passed much like Monday: they’d gone into training in the mornings, spent their afternoons on the very boring house they were working on and in the evenings they’d eaten and talked together. Like friends.
That was when Harry effectively stopped Draco’s ramblings with a kiss that was filled with emotion and absolutely searing in its intensity. He only let go for a very brief moment, getting rid of all Draco’s worries in one sentence. “Draco, it’s absolutely perfect.” And his gaze was so warm, looking at Draco as if
“Go after him!” Zabini’s voice was really quiet, but insistent. “I’m not going anywhere,” He made a small attempt at a smile. “Get the fucking bastard!”
It was one thing to kiss and do what they’d just done, but it was a wholly different thing if it meant they actually were-. Draco knew how Harry didn’t like being dragged into anything without having a say in it, not since the war anyway. And Draco understood.
And she was a marvel to work with too: clever enough, but also having an acute sense of human decency, something Terry quite obviously lacked.
be professional about this, there won’t be a problem.” Harry was rather acutely aware of the fact that her emphasis on ‘both’ was most probably not meant to doubt Malfoy. “Besides I hear he is a very accomplished Curse-Breaker. You really
Draco hadn’t wanted to talk about this mess he’d made, not even to Blaise, who had known better than to press.
So Draco just gave Potter a smile that probably was every bit as sensuous and sultry as he’d intended it to be, leaving Potter’s gaze somewhere between heated and, well, slightly insecure perhaps.
Like always after he’d had a nightmare: Harry’d fallen asleep with his back to Malfoy, but sometime throughout the night he’d apparently turned, ending up facing Malfoy who was still fast asleep, if his soft, even breathing was anything to go by.
So he got up - carefully, trying not to wake Harry up yet - after which he made his way straight to the bathroom, having established that last night’s exertions had left him utterly naked, meaning there was no need to get undressed anymore.
After the most ill-advised kiss he’d ever shared, Draco’d just wanted to get out of the club to give them both some space, an opportunity to leave each other alone, breathe a bit. It could have resulted in them still having a good time later tonight – just not together – but of course Potter would have to go and ruin that particular plan by coming after him, almost looking like he cared.
Draco’s fingers felt slightly cold when they curled into the hair at the nape of Harry’s neck, but Harry let himself be pulled in willingly, finding that Draco’s lips were warm and inviting.
“And that also means I will no longer need to pry upon your hospitality,” Draco continued, while pulling back the sheets, clenching his jaw. Every movement hurt, but he couldn’t show, not here.
“No.” There was absolutely no hesitation to Harry’s answer. “All of the others there will be couples. I’d just feel, well,
Malfoy gave him an odd look, surprise mixed with something else. Then he smiled a little. “Well, I don’t know how much of a recommendation that actually is, but,” Malfoy paused a beat. “Thank you.” It rolled off his tongue unfamiliarly, but Harry was surprised by how much he liked it anyway.
Harry had noted it was odd that Malfoy lived in a Muggle flat, but he hadn’t given it any further thought. Perhaps he should have.
Mabel smiled at him overly brightly, probably flattered that the great Harry Potter remembered who she was.
So Draco just clenched his jaw and bit back a retort, at the same time that Harry got up from his chair, all strength and confidence, gazing at Smith in a way that clearly didn’t bode well. Draco couldn’t look away from him, feeling Harry’s magic almost tangibly curl around him, pinning him in place. It was electrifying and Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen anything or anyone this attractive any time before. Harry was absolutely gorgeous.
Harry and Zabini just looked at each other for one moment and they both knew what they were going to say, although they also both knew the risk: the Cartel could be testing their allegiance here.
Harry opened the parchment that came with it and discovered the cube was some sort of imprisonment ward the Unspeakables had been working on. When activated by the accompanying enchantment, it would be set to Malfoy’s signature, not letting him pass outside of its boundaries, while allowing everybody else to go wherever they pleased. Only when Harry would perform a long series of counter-spells would Malfoy be able to move anywhere else.
Draco’s eyes flew open, because that obviously was how this damned curse worked. “Harry, I-, You didn’t want to-.” He was panting.
It had taken a full week, but today Draco and Harry had finally been discharged from hospital. Draco had offered to go to his own flat, to give Harry some space. They’d been together in their room at St Mungo’s for the entire week and Draco could imagine that Harry would probably want to be on his own for a while.
Harry turned. Zabini had rolled off him, but he wasn’t moving and Harry, to his horror, realised Zabini had been hit.
Harry seemed to give the question considerable, deliberate thought. “I’ll just have tea, if that’s all right. I think having alcohol now-, well, it’s probably not a good idea,” he said eventually. Harry didn’t elaborate and Draco didn’t ask, not wanting to know if Harry would still be going anywhere else this evening.
Harry just looked him up and down again, like he couldn’t actually believe Draco was still there. Well, that made two of them.
Harry and Mathew Dean, the Senior Auror on their case, had spent the afternoon securing the house, which had largely meant making sure there actually was no one else in there – there wasn’t – and identifying objects that could be dangerous, so the Curse-Breakers could deal with those later. In short: for the Aurors this case was bound to be even more uneventful than for the Curse-Breakers.
the rules before you can break them,” Draco mused. “But at least you can be trusted to make the right decisions, following the rules or not. That should probably count for something.” He knew he wasn’t just talking about Potter anymore and for a moment he felt more vulnerable than he’d let himself feel for a long time.
Yesterday evening Draco hadn’t been to his usual club, nor anywhere else for that matter. He’d mostly spent his Saturday evening home alone: just having seen Blaise for a very short while.
So now he was back in his flat and although he disliked the silence that meant he was here on his own, he felt more hopeful than he had for some time now.
Draco looked at him in utter confusion, stilling his movements while standing on one leg, because he’d been trying to get into his impossibly tight jeans. He didn’t say anything.
, of course Harry would be on a first-name basis with the Minister of Magic himself. "Tomorrow around seven I’ll pick you up for dinner, though. Nothing too fancy and definitely Muggle. That okay?” Harry continued.
“Draco doesn’t think so. They bought his story and let him go.” Harry heard the doubt edging his words regardless.
Draco had expected Harry to leave after he’d had his tea, but Harry didn’t. And it wasn’t awkward, either. They just started talking about Draco’s flat, the books they were reading, Quidditch, and all of a sudden a whole hour had passed.
“And you hadn’t been back to the UK before the Ministry Ball?” Harry guessed and he heard he sounded slightly incredulous.
That was when Harry came in. He was in his Auror uniform, looking slightly unkempt: stubble on his cheeks and his hair the disaster that it had always been.
Zabini took in the situation in one annoyingly slow glance around the room. “I’m Draco’s handler,” Zabini answered a question Harry hadn’t asked, “He usually works with me when he’s on a case.”
“Well, I-, I just wanted to know what it meant. What I experience when I’m with you. I-It-,” Harry inadequately replied.
Potter seemingly thought so too: “So he will be okay?” he asked. The Healer didn’t say anything else, but Draco thought she must have nodded, because Potter just said: “Good.”
Hermione regarded him for a moment, then said: “Well, I can see how it could have been rather much. You know, just before starting your new job.”
Draco shook his head, still hoping he made the right choice. “No, this isn’t Leo, it’s Canis Major,” Draco paused, just a beat, continuing: “And that,” Draco pointed out, “is Sirius. It’s brightest star.”
“You had this made?” Harry asked, his voice so thick with emotion it actually sounded like he had difficulty saying anything at all. Draco just couldn’t make out whether he was extremely happy or tremendously angry.
“Much.” Harry knew Draco’s answer probably was as meaningless as it was short, but Zabini obviously knew better than to question it.
“Well, yes,” Harry just shrugged, trying to seem disinterested, while feeling his annoyance at Malfoy just
Malfoy was wearing a cologne that smelled just as expensive as his clothes looked. It was surprisingly nice.
Draco knew for a fact that Harry wasn’t dating Luna. He’d actually asked and Harry had snorted a surprised laugh and told him that: no, he certainly wasn’t interested in Luna in that way. She was just a really good friend.
He obviously wasn’t the only one to have noticed, though. A lot of people were actually staring at Malfoy and Astoria, at the way their bodies seemed to fit and move together with a grace that left most people utterly lacking. Even Zabini and Ginny seemed to have slowed down a bit to be able to see.
Which was completely ridiculous of course. He’d never been apprehensive about going there - apart perhaps from the very first time he’d tried going to a Muggle club on his own - quite the contrary really: it had always been his way of letting go, of blowing off steam, of being close to someone without his heart on the line. Well, that plus the other obvious benefits, of course. It suited him just fine.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said and he really, really meant it, feeling he wanted to comfort Draco, but also quite sure he wouldn’t be permitted to. “So you erm-, you don’t really like me very much just now?” Harry asked, feeling guilty - because of the letter he’d stupidly missed – and quite at a loss as to what to do next, where this was going.
But nothing could have been further from the truth, Hermione and Harry kept engaging him, conversation between the three of them flowing much more easily than Draco could ever have imagined.
He was almost glad when the pain in his back returned, so he wasn’t able to concentrate on anything else much for the time being.
“Well, okay,” Draco said. “I should be able to come over for a short while,” he added, giving himself some leeway, because he wasn’t ready to promise he’d be there all night: he wasn’t going to make a promise he might not be able to keep.
Harry nodded again, slightly stung. “Of course I do.” As if just Covert Ops agents would know how to use a Glamour.
“This will hurt,” Harry said. Draco nodded, visibly bracing himself. When Harry put the essence on his wound, Draco just clenched his jaws, starting to relax again some moments later.
“To grade essays,” Draco felt the need to clarify. Harry kept silent though, watching him expectantly. “And yes, okay,” Draco reluctantly conceded. There really wasn’t anything else for it. “But
“I hope you’re not freaking out in there.” Draco’s tone was light, but he also watched Harry carefully, his grey eyes intent. And close, very close, and very beautiful. Yes, definitely that too.
“Problem solved.” Harry now directed himself towards the head in the Floo. “You can come and install that kitchen tomorrow.”
“Yeah,” Harry acknowledged, “he asks me whether you could perhaps come into work for a few hours tonight. Apparently someone couldn’t come to work tonight because they had a sick child and Zabini had to send another colleague home because he was having an actual fever. You’d just have to work for two hours: twelve to two. He says he’s got everything covered from two on.” Harry watched Malfoy. “Do you want to fill in?” It was a genuine question. If Malfoy actually wanted to do this, Harry wasn’t going to stand in his way.
“Draco, I’m not going anywhere.” Harry’s voice rang out in the large space just as clearly as Draco’s had.
Draco only watched him for a beat longer, apparently making up his mind, before he visibly came to a conclusion. The result wasn’t soft or gentle: Draco’s kiss was hard, demanding and so, so needy and Harry reciprocated in kind, pulling Draco in by the waist while he was at it.
Draco shrugged. “Someone else would probably have been able to do something about it and otherwise I would have been called in at some point anyway.”
“Protection,” Zabini whispered under his breath, “Normally labs like this one are layered in protective spells to keep anyone who enters from inhaling fumes, as it could be dangerous, especially when you are brewing experimental potions.”
Well, tomorrow would undoubtedly be difficult: him being around all those people who would not be particularly glad he’d be there, but Draco imagined he could always tell Harry he was tired and leave early. It probably wouldn’t be too far from the truth anyway.
Penelope looked up from their work on the last statuette. The house had been deemed safe by Mathew and Harry just half an hour ago and Draco and Penelope had only just proceeded taking down the wards around the statuettes again. They’d almost finished.
That mystery solved itself, though. “He used to bring us food if he could, when I was at the Manor.” Luna, of course, had been a
Harry smiled at him, the sort of genuine smile he usually reserved for his friends. He really didn’t want to go into that now, though. “I’m not in that much of a hurry today.”
“Because I’m fine and because I presume you in fact have a life to go back to, you know, instead of nursing me.” Draco sounded very much like himself now, but somehow the way he looked seemed to contradict that, his posture tired, impassive, as if he’d had just enough energy to sound as arrogant as ever, but couldn’t quite get himself to look it too.
And Harry thought Draco understood by the way his hand slowly unclenched Harry’s T-shirt and ended up on Harry’s hip, their kiss now lacking all previous urgency,  turning deep, slow, sweet and utterly divine instead.
Draco turned and made a beeline to the bar, deciding this probably was as good a day as any to get absolutely sloshed. He asked for another Firewhiskey.
Harry watched him for a short while before answering, his eyes inquisitive and still just as green as Draco remembered them. “No, it’s not that anymore. But I just thought-, well, we’d started on your flat and I thought it would be nice to help you finish it. You know, so you can settle in here again, feel at home.” He kept staring at Draco, like he wanted to find answers to a question he hadn’t asked.
Malfoy gave him a swift once over and for some reason Harry thought he wasn’t going to answer. Until he did, anyway: “Yes, sometimes. Not at this particular moment, though, in case you’re wondering.” There was that playful tone again, and for some reason Harry noticed he’d been waiting for it, wanting it to reappear, but not thinking it actually would anymore. It made the sting of disappointment Harry felt at Malfoy’s words, at their implication, bearable. Because there actually
Then he Apparated out, leaving Harry completely at a loss. Was Harry supposed to be offended? Because he realised he actually felt a bit offended, but he also knew - or hoped perhaps -
“Well, Potter, here we are again,” Malfoy said, voice low. Malfoy’d probably already been somewhere else this evening, because Harry could easily smell the alcohol on his breath.  Plus Malfoy was late of course. “So, how do you want to play it tonight?” Malfoy asked, seductive purr in place. He was close, effectively pinning Harry against the wall behind him. “Dance? Or shall we skip that altogether?”
going to be sticking around for breakfast.” Harry said when Draco slowly started to feel more like his, still very tired, self again. Harry didn’t sound put off, though, and when Draco looked up at him he was smiling a little. It was slightly hesitant, as if he wasn’t sure how Draco would take his words.
She gave him a slightly surprised look, then seemed to recognise him as the one who had brought David in and smiled. “Still weak, but out of stasis and recovering,” adding apologetically: “and I’m afraid that’s all I’m at liberty to tell you.” Harry felt she probably meant she hadn’t been at liberty to tell him even that much.
Hermione smiled a slightly mischievous smile, though: “But he’s also managed to make himself into a celebrity of some sort in the process. On the continent he seems to be just as well known for his lifestyle as for his charity work. He’s even made it into
He hadn’t had too much time left – the questions having taken up a rather large portion of his lesson - so he’d just given the students a simple first exercise, but it had been worth it. It had been so nice to be in front of a class again, teaching Defence like he’d been born to do so.
Potter made remarkably quick work of it, gazing back at Draco again when he had finished, his eyes lingering on where Draco’s shirt was still open.
The question, open and genuine, left Draco a bit off-kilter. Somehow he hadn’t expected it, having thought Harry would certainly not want to be with him again this evening, even though yesterday had been marvellous. “No. No, I don’t.” Draco’d been able to swallow his ‘of course I don’t’ only just in time.
“We were in the shop and I don’t know what exactly it was that he was working on, but it went off and-.” George still sounded quite put together, but it was clear that he was really worried all the same. Well, it looked like he had every right to be.
The floor wasn’t very crowded just now, the music just having changed to something slightly more upbeat. Harry saw Malfoy bowing as he said something to Astoria, perhaps asking her a question. She answered him and he smiled a little, warm and genuine.
Because he was in bed with a man, his body all long, lean lines. And Harry smiled, recollecting everything they’d done in this very room just hours before, things he certainly couldn’t have done with a woman.
“I think we’ve actually done rather well so far,” Harry answered. “We haven’t even hexed each other yet.” He smiled and it came out absolutely genuine.
At first Harry had worried about that part a bit, because they would have to produce these ingredients at some point for his character to be believable, but some of these things were actually very, very difficult to get a hold of, even for the Auror Department, because, well, they
Draco hadn’t seen Potter again this week. He usually got into Training early on Tuesday mornings, so he could check the essays he hadn’t come around to grading throughout the rest of the week. But he hadn’t seen Potter then and he hadn’t seen Potter
“Malfoy.” Potter’s voice sounded shocked, if anything, and Draco couldn’t help but look at him, desperately trying not to flinch at the pain.
Harry felt the urge to sit a bit closer to Draco still and, although Draco had obviously decided the window was infinitely more interesting to watch than Harry, Harry moved closer anyway.
Harry seemed to ponder his answer for a moment, then said: “I just got off work. The perk of being Head Auror: you know, having regular working hours, well, mostly at least.”
It was only then, when they’d put some distance between them, that Harry realised just how hungry he was.
When Harry told Malfoy, he was ready for whatever Malfoy would throw at him, but Malfoy just shrugged. “At least they won’t make me come into the Ministry with you.”
They’d had lunch and moved to the sofa in one of Harry’s drawing rooms, where they’d started going over everything that had happened at the house. Then, for some reason, the topic had miraculously changed to Draco’s Patronus, which had led to Draco truthfully telling Harry he still really resented the form it had taken.
Because it was now that Harry fully realised that he really didn’t want Draco to leave, at least not completely, not without knowing he’d see him again.
live in a Muggle area and I’m connected. And so are Ron and Hermione and they’ve just recently bought a house in my neighbourhood, too.”
Draco was right, of course: they wouldn’t be able to just walk out yet, for again there were footsteps outside of the office they were in. Harry didn’t say anything, just signalling Draco to stand to one side of the door, while he himself stood to the other.
“Don’t talk.” Harry’s voice came out remarkably softly. He had registered that Draco using his last name had actually hurt, but this was not the time to go into that. “I’ll take you to the British Room,” Harry just said.
When his class finally arrived, it was with the insistent chatter that groups of trainees usually seemed to move around with.
That was when Malfoy actually did smile, just short of a smirk: “Well, if you keep frying bacon like that, I might just do it again.” Then a short silence and when Malfoy started to talk again, it was about something else entirely, as if he was afraid amusement wasn’t quite allowed: “So, you’re off work? Or do you work a late shift today?”
Harry kneeled next to where Draco was lying. What had the stupid fucker been thinking, shoving Harry out of the way, taking a curse that hadn’t even been meant for him.
When Harry touched his wings, it was like a bolt of lightning striking, Draco’s whole body flaming up. His breathing suffered, becoming fast and uncontrollable. He let out a groan that was quite involuntary.
actually how he felt. It really was nice to cook for someone. Even if that someone was Malfoy, apparently. “You can set the table, though.”
“And they must employ an excellent curse breaker,” Harry suddenly realised, “because they apparently broke through all my Auror strength wards.”
“So, do you have plans for dinner? Or do you have to work tonight?” Harry asked next and his voice had a tinge of shyness to it that Draco wished he hadn’t heard.
Draco looked behind him. His wings were definitely there: all feathery and white and - okay, he was going to admit it - rather majestic.
He found he couldn’t care less, though. Playing chess with Draco was nice, easy fun, even if the twat won all the time. Well,
Blaise just looked at him in surprise for a moment, obviously not quite sure what to make of this, whether Draco was being serious. Well, Draco was. Dead serious. And Blaise realised soon enough, cracking up with laughter. Draco had never seen him laugh uncontrollably before, but this seemingly was what had done it. "Apparently
Harry didn’t get a chance to think about it for a very long time, though, because it was only slightly later that the owl arrived.
The question took Draco by surprise, although it really shouldn’t have and he eyed the counter quickly. Luckily it wasn’t too far off.
Draco wanted to protest, to tell Harry he could make it home himself in a bit, but his muscles felt so heavy and words never formed.
The only reason they didn’t get cursed straight away was that there actually was a doorway. The guards had to get in by ones or twos at most, which made it possible for Harry and Draco to deal with them.
“And Harry was there when you finally managed to cast your insect-y Patronus?” Blaise asked smiling. He looked like he would start laughing again, if Draco gave him but the least bit incentive.
Draco leans forward to kiss his cheek, both to console him and to atone again for the wrecked dinner. “Let’s go home, Harry. Please?”
“One of the stone circles up on the moor. I’d like to go on a clear night, but I know that would be difficult since the Apparition Point is down in the closest Muggle village. A daytime trip, if we can’t manage it in the dark.”
He walks Harry to the door again. As they stand in the dim vestibule, Harry can tell that Malfoy wants to say something, and whatever it is isn’t easy for him to put into words. He waits with a hand on the doorknob after putting his trainers back on.
At last, they fly through the open window of the girls’ dormitory. Malfoy doesn’t stop at the top of the staircase. He guides his broom back to the common room and lands near the fireplace. As soon as he dismounts, Malfoy takes both brooms, setting them on the floor. Then he starts pulling off the outer layers of Harry’s clothes. They’re still damp, despite the Drying Charms.
Harry catches Draco’s hand to wrap his own around it. “I’m sorry. I should have said you could tell them.” He glances at Naia before telling Jerome, “I, er, strongly disagreed with certain policies and initiatives of the department. And I couldn’t stay there in good conscience, knowing that I wasn’t going to be able to change any minds on the matter.”
Traipsing around in the dark over the rough terrain—still wet from rain earlier in the day—had left him sore and exhausted, though, and Harry would be happy to stay close to the camp today.
Draco places a gentle hand on Naia’s shoulder, both to reassure her and to guide her through the crowd of Saturday shoppers filling Knockturn Alley. She insisted on walking home with Draco after her tutoring session, telling her mother that she wanted to carry the bag of bakery goods that Susannah insists on giving him each week. Draco saw through the ploy immediately. Ever since Naia received her Hogwarts letter, he’s had to insist that she refrain from peppering him with questions about the school during her lessons. It was only a matter of time before she worked out a way to get answers. She’s one of the cleverest children Draco’s ever known, after all.
“Would you like to help Greg again?” Luna asks. “Draco’s not overly fond of carpentry, since Greg won’t let him use magic.”
“I’m not terribly fond of hypothermia, thank you.” Draco looks around, checking to make sure no one’s watching them, then slips his arm around Harry’s waist. “Are you enjoying your beach day? I’d propose getting ice cream, but I think something warm might be a wiser choice.”
“If you’re not coming, I think I’ll fly. Sorry, girl,” I said. She had perked up hopefully at the sound of her name.
Harry grins at the anecdote and launches into a story about Teddy trying to persuade Andromeda to give him a pet Niffler for Christmas one year by saying that it would earn its keep by finding stray Knuts in the house and garden. Draco is happy to have a topic of conversation that Harry enjoys, and he asks more questions about Teddy and Andromeda. Harry sees them every weekend, Draco learns, usually at their cottage in Cornwall, but occasionally in London for an outing. He also tells Draco, as if he feels the need for full disclosure on the subject, that he pays for Teddy’s tuition at his primary school. Draco shrugs off this piece of information and reassures Harry that he would never resent the children who are receiving a better education than the ones in Knockturn Alley. He’s genuinely glad that Teddy is well and thriving.
Harry keeps his hand pressed into Malfoy’s side, wondering how the fuck he’s ever going to forget the feel of the warm, silken skin under his palm. He’ll have to take up Seamus’ offer to get him royally pissed this weekend. He’s going to drink until he erases the memory of this entire experience. Including (and especially) the fact that he now knows what Draco Malfoy’s nipples look like.
The walk back to the gardens seems shorter. Crickets hum around them, and Harry is delighted to spot glow worms shining in the tall grass. He catches Draco’s sleeve to stop him halfway back to the house. They extinguish their wands and count the tiny, green lights around them.
Malfoy volunteers to do the washing up then read to Teddy when he’s done. Harry, not wanting to be outdone, asks Andromeda if there’s anything he can do around the house while Teddy’s having his afternoon quiet time.
“Yeah,” Potter says. “It’s coming together pretty quickly. They think they’ll be able to open in September. Hermione’s already talking about finding a building and advertising for teachers.”
“The Outer Hebrides. Even Hogsmeade is a couple of jumps by Apparition. So… if you were interested in helping, it would mean coming along with me. Ernie would like everything sorted so he knows what might be worth selling and what can just be Vanished. He said he’d hate to get rid of something that might be valuable or have some kind of historical significance.”
Harry stands and places his empty glass in the sink. He tries not to flinch when the Fanged Geraniums twitch in their pots. “I’ll be off then,” he says. “Thanks for the water.”
He’s suddenly very tired, even though it’s not yet nine. Maybe it was the shot of adrenaline when he looked up in the loft, or maybe the long days he’s been putting in have finally caught up with him. It’s tempting to let himself fall back and lie on the bed, but that might look like he’s claiming it for himself.
Five days ago, they spent another rainy Saturday in the tent playing games and listening to records on Draco’s old phonograph. Pansy and Luna were all smiles, of course, while they shared cushions and mugs of tea. Greg had settled back into his usual unruffled self.
When he turns towards the door, Harry sees that it’s perfectly intact. The wardrobe, however, has its doors blown off at the hinges. They’re on the floor, barely visible beneath a pile of…
Despite his wariness, Malfoy claims the task of pruning the long yew hedge that runs along one side of the garden, leaving Harry with the task of weeding beneath it. After raking out the layer of dead leaves that blew under the hedge during the winter, Harry gets down on his hands and knees to start pulling out the weeds that have sprouted there.
He never opens it while Harry’s in the room, nor can Harry catch him off guard when he comes upstairs. Harry doesn’t dare try opening the wardrobe himself—the man is studying curse breaking, after all, which means he probably knows a dozen ways to give anyone trying to undo the locking charm a nasty surprise.
“Oh, yes. Draco, Pansy, Greg, and I are quite inseparable these days,” Luna says with a beatific smile for the two across the table.
Whatever Harry wants to talk about must be urgent if it can’t wait until Draco comes home from work tonight, he thinks, but it must also be something they can discuss quickly.
Draco tucks the Dickens book back into place on the shelf. He doesn’t want to leave either, even though there’s no conceivable reason for him to linger now that he has his book. He wants to ask Potter about that day in the Auror department, but he’s afraid that Potter will deny helping him.
“That’s really none of your business,” Potter snapped. He leaned back on his arms and looked up at the ceiling. “And I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”
need to move to the bed. Very soon. He manages to convey this to Draco somehow, with a few words between kisses and by pushing his hips away. Instead of looking smug, as Harry expects, Draco is bright-eyed and breathless. He looks so much younger, Harry thinks. More alive.
He slips down the hall towards the bedroom before Draco can reply. Mother leads him to the sofa and gently nudges him downward with a hand on his shoulder.
Potter looks torn. His notebook is halfway back to his pocket and his head is turning towards the door when he stops himself. He steps further into the shop with a resolute expression.
But it’s only when Pansy slides her hand around Draco’s waist and rests her head on his shoulder that Harry understands what’s happening.
“Yes?” Draco asks. He feels like he’s standing in the first warm gust of a storm, tasting the electricity in the air.
“No, I don’t think anyone should forgive me—unless they want to. I apologised at my trial for the things I did, and I meant it. I truly meant it, Potter. Do you think it’s really too much to ask that
“What about everyone else who lives in Knockturn? They deserve to be safe, too. I hope you believe that.”
He Apparated us to a tiny crescent of beach between the waves and a small cliff. The smell of the briny water filled my nose immediately. A few yards in front of us, the ruffled edge of the sea slid over the pebbly shore, and far across the wide stretch of grey-blue water, the horizon was already darkening into night.
“It wasn’t that kind of letter,” Harry lamented. “Just a few lines, very business-like. Do you think I should go?”
“I can’t take that! Just keep it away from me,” he says. His voice sounds like someone else’s, someone a bit mad.
Draco follows the unexpected command and rolls over onto his stomach, drawing his arms up to rest his head on them. He hears Harry sigh, almost reverently. Gentle fingertips rest on the back of his shoulder.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Malfoy mutters as he fumbles with the buttons on Harry’s coat. He’s breathing hard—harder than someone who’s standing still should be.
“It seems healthy.” Potter leaned closer to look at the foal. “A filly! You can come a bit closer, if you like. I’m going to move her over so her mum can see her and clean her up a bit.”
,” Draco whispers fervently. “I can’t believe you did this. How did you manage it without me knowing?”
“No, I mean that they should forgive me when and if they’re ready to. I have no right to demand or expect that from them. Forgiveness is
Draco thinks. He doesn’t bother asking Potter what he would wish for; it would probably be something idiotic, like the Chudley Cannons winning the Quidditch championships or festive tea towels for the Hogwarts house elves.
Draco returns to the sitting room, taking his mother’s hand when he sits beside her again. He apologises for taking so long. She smiles knowingly.
Just then, Ron’s Jack Russell terrier Patronus appears right over Teddy’s head and dashes towards Harry. Ron’s voice bursts from the ghostly dog’s mouth as soon as it spots its target.
“You already thanked me, and so did your mum,” Harry says quietly. “I don’t want you to keep inviting me because you think you owe it to me, or something. I’d rather just… start with a clean slate, if that’s possible.”
He walks faster than necessary toward Knockturn Alley, hoping to burn off some of the adrenaline that’s making him feel like he wants to crawl out of his skin. The shops and parks are still decorated for Christmas, and Draco’s been taking walks almost every evening for the past month to enjoy the lights and colourful window displays. They’re nothing like the subdued and tasteful Yule decorations at the Manor.
“It’s called dancing, Greg,” Pansy says, with a laugh that’s tinged with bitterness. “Well, Luna’s style of dancing, anyway.”
As they’re leaving, Andromeda takes Draco’s hand in both of hers when he offers it to her to shake. It’s soft and warm, and his eyes begin to sting as he looks into her face and sees an echo of his mother in her blue eyes and the shape of her nose. He hopes his whispered words of thanks are enough to convey his gratitude.
“And that’s not what you want?” Harry asks. What he really wants to know is which of those things Draco objects to most. Marriage? Children?
Draco and Harry agree, and they split up again, lists in hand. Harry wanders downstream, vaguely looking for something “sweet as sun-warmed mallow,” but ends up spending most of the time enjoying the gurgle and sparkle of the stream beside him. He’s sorely tempted to try to fold his parchment into a boat and race it down the hill.
“I’d like to find another student or two, if you know anyone looking for a tutor. There must be children who are too old for the new school who’d like to have some lessons.”
“Hello, Harry. Greg found this little fellow in the garden. It looks like an animal tried to catch him, probably a badger or a crow, poor thing.” Luna reaches into the basket and strokes the snake’s head with a gentle index finger. “I’m going to see what I can do for him.”
Wharton lingers in the doorway while Draco’s lost in thought, then steps into the room on the pretext of examining the spines of the inventory ledgers. There’s a shiny patch on the front of his robes, Draco notices, where he folds his arms over his round stomach.
It was well into November by then, and there’d been several light coatings of snow already. I’d cajoled Potter into loaning me some warmer clothes, but I knew the weather would only get harsher when winter truly arrived. My feet crunched over the frozen grass as I walked over the hills, keeping a fast pace to stay warm. The regular meals and exercise in the past few weeks had improved my health and stamina greatly.
“Oh, I see,” he said, eyes widening with understanding. “I guess I wasn’t worried about keeping things as they were, since I had to change so much to convert it to a house.”
“I think I bought too many rolls,” he says in a conspiratorial voice. “Better hurry before the others come back outside.”
“Probably. They aren’t difficult to learn. That was the first thing Bill taught me. Well, the second thing, actually, after
And then Potter and his partner stride past him, and Draco feels rather let down that today’s encounter is to be so brief. A glancing blow to Draco’s heart instead of the emotionally-charged collision that he’s come to expect.
turned into every day. Their rendezvous are longer and in places where there’s a greater risk of discovery. Draco has to admit that Potter is a dab hand at Silencing and Concealment Charms, but things seem to be escalating to the point where the removal of clothing is imminent and Draco would rather not be caught in the library stacks with his trousers around his ankles.
“But it’s been a couple months now. And it’s been years since the war ended. I wish they could just—”
“No, it’s fine. I didn’t have any plans for the evening,” Draco assures him. He’s relieved that Harry doesn’t try to shake his hand again. Draco might’ve been just exasperated enough to try to hug him if he had.
There’s no point dwelling on it right now, Draco tells himself as he rises from the chair. Best to get on with his morning and stay focused on the positive parts of his life: Harry, of course; the kids he tutors on weekends; even his job, which has provided a meagre yet honest living—not an easy thing to come by for someone with a criminal record.
I stomped away and shut myself in the bathroom again until I heard him go up to the loft. When I returned to the table, I couldn’t think of anything else to draw. The parchment vanished with an angry flick of my wand.
Apparently Malfoy keeps a supply of candles. And a small candelabra to put them in. The light cocoons them in the alcove, leaving the rest of the flat in shadows.
“Hello there, Orestes. I hope you’ve been staying out of trouble.” Malfoy scratches the owl’s head for a minute, then attaches the letter to its leg. “Take that to Mother, please. I’m sure she’s eager to hear from me.”
“It’s nothing so grave. You needn’t look like you’re prepared to break into Gringotts again for me.”
“I enjoyed talking with you,” Draco says with a smile. He needs to make sure that Potter knows that he’s okay. That things between them, which are still undefined and probably confusing to Potter, are okay, too.
He stands up and resists the temptation to kick sand on her legs. They’re very nice legs, Harry has to admit. She’s a beautiful witch. But that’s a fact that Harry’s brain can acknowledge without it stirring up any
“None taken,” Harry replies. “I know it’s not what people expected me to do, but I’m okay with that.”
Dozens and dozens of loo rolls. A few of them have rolled away from the wardrobe and across the room, like sheep that wandered away from the flock.
Watching Malfoy drum his long, agile fingers on the upholstered arms of his chair, Harry suddenly remembers something else they share.
“Here,” Harry says, kneeling in front of Draco. He holds a glass vial near Draco’s face. “This will help.”
Harry’s body floods with heat. It seems to lift him, like a slow wave, and makes him roll over to face Draco. Their knees knock together and their arms fumble beneath the duvet, until they come to rest across each others’ waists.
I started spending more time walking around the city and poking into different shops when I did the weekly shopping. Knowing that Potter always gave me more money than was needed for food, I started bringing home other things: cheap paperback books, jigsaw puzzles, a deck of Muggle playing cards. Potter didn’t do more than raise his eyebrows at my purchases. He must have decided it was a small price to pay to keep me out of his way.
“Yeah, well, telling them that Death came by and confirmed that I was really his Master and that there wasn’t anything I could do about it definitely didn’t help.” Harry leaned back against the pillows, pulling me against his chest and waiting to speak until I’d settled beside him. “They wanted me to see a Mind Healer. Or an Unspeakable, which would have been even worse. Can you imagine if the Ministry found out I have this much magic?”
“Well, it wasn’t the time to do it, was it? I couldn’t very well march over to you in the Great Hall and announce it,” Draco says, struggling to stay calm. “Could you please sit back down?”
Draco makes a disgusted sound. “If you think I’m going to drink the dreadful swill that Americans call tea, out of a paper cup no less, you are gravely mistaken. But you may buy me some hot cocoa, before we go home.”
“Just thinking about Erwina’s house. I wonder if anyone’s used it this summer. The beach is probably as lovely as this one.”
Harry closes his eyes and tries to swallow the flutter of panic in his throat. He’s going to have to be more careful now when he leaves his flat. Maybe leaving his invisibility cloak in London was a bad idea after all. Maybe he should have asked the estate agent when he looked at this place if there were any British tenants here. It was stupid of him to not to think of it.
Harry isn’t trollied, but he’s definitely good and tipsy when they leave the hotel bar. His tolerance has taken a nosedive, he realises, since Seamus and Dean moved to Dublin a few years ago and pub nights became much more sedate. And infrequent. Harry’s pretty sure he wouldn’t have hesitated to Apparate home after three pints once upon a time, and now he’s gripping Draco’s arm like he’s going to tumble down the short set of stairs from the door to the car park.
That’s all that Malfoy needs to hear to kiss him again. And it’s a good one this time, sending a thrill through Harry that makes his toes curl into the carpet. Malfoy’s still gripping his arms, and Harry isn’t sure what to do with his own hands. He tries putting one on Malfoy’s waist. The warmth that bleeds through the fabric from Malfoy’s body is almost as exhilarating as the press of his mouth, which is now fully engaged with Harry’s.
I stayed on the moor until the sun was low over the horizon and the air was cooling. I’d have to face him eventually, I reckoned. Sore from lying on the ground, I got to my feet and plodded back to the house.
February is even colder than January in New York, and most frigid days are deceptively sunny. Everyone’s in an even greater hurry than usual to get to their destinations, so bundled up that only their eyes are visible. Harry ventures out only when he needs to. The biting air and the light reflecting off cars and glass buildings during the short days make the city feel sharper and more unwelcoming than ever.
“Look, mate,” Ron said, “you know we want you to be happy, but there are other fish in the barrel, as the old saying goes.” Hermione snorted. “Maybe it’s time to find someone who’s more interested. And less Malfoyish. Malfoy-y. Whatever.”
“I don’t mind eating with you. You make all my favourite dishes,” Harry says lightly. “And you keep inviting me, so why shouldn’t I eat with you?”
“When can you come and meet him, Draco? Do you tutor your students on Saturdays, or can you come along with Harry next weekend?”
It’s a stag, silhouetted against the pale fog. Harry watches, breathlessly, as it walks along the ridge, it’s curved antlers swaying slightly with each step.
“And you ended up with the cloak,” I said, trying to keep my tone neutral despite my skepticism. “So, the wand and the stone are out there somewhere? Do you know who has them?”
by Ernie’s discomfort as much as he’s pained by the reminder of his past. No matter who he is now and how much his beliefs have changed in the past ten years, Harry has the sense that Draco’s still struggling to forgive himself.
Potter doesn’t look angry now. In fact, he seems just as surprised as Draco. He’s wearing his Auror uniform today, which indicates that he’s here on Ministry business and not to purchase Potions ingredients—which would be absurd, as Potter is as likely to brew his own potions as he is to grow wings. Draco grips the doorframe and tries to recover his powers of speech.
“This is not how I thought the truce would end,” Hermione says, tilting her head against Ron’s shoulder with a disappointed sigh.
“I hoped she might, once she met you. I’ve been talking you up for months now, you know,” Harry says with a wink. “I was only afraid that I’d raised her expectations too high.”
I so badly wanted to tilt forwards and press my lips to his. His hair hung in damp tendrils around his face; I could almost imagine how it would feel tangled in my hand as I held his mouth against mine.
“I’m sure it would still be fun,” Harry replies sincerely. The others look skeptical, but they don’t interrupt the list-making with objections.
“We need to make these sorts of decisions together, all right?” Draco says. “No carrying me off somewhere just because someone sends an angry letter. I won’t fall apart when people say mean things to me, whether they’re true or not.”
“No, I’m sure she didn’t make that Horcrux. Merlin knows how she acquired it, but I could tell right away that it’s very old. Probably centuries old.”
Harry watches, enraptured, as he listens to Draco’s rich, tenor voice over the crackle of the bonfire. The light of the flames illuminates his sapling-slender form and turns his hair golden beneath his crown of oak leaves. There’s something about the graceful tilt of his neck as he sings, the expressive way he uses his hands, that makes the breath catch in Harry’s chest.
“I’ve been in this room for, let me see, fifteen years. I had a room in a different building before that, above a bookshop, but the owner sold it to retire. Moved to Cornwall, I believe. I was there for almost ten years, since the time I lost my wife.”
“But why all this?” Harry asks, gesturing at the platters and bowls in front of him. “There are simpler things to cook, especially if it’s just for yourself.”
“Everything,” Draco says, taking Harry’s hand. “Leaving the stability of my current life, the inevitable row with my parents, making Scorpius go back and forth between two households, the publicity and nasty speculation that always come with a divorce. And, of course, the uncertainty of… something new that may or may not succeed, if we were to try it. As I said, a bit of a coward,” he adds with a short, rueful laugh.
“That’s lovely of you to offer, but I’m afraid I can’t accept,” Draco says, running his hand down the front of Harry’s jumper to rest over his heart.
“No,” Draco says firmly. “I’m not worried about the shop. I’ve never seen anything there that concerned me. And I’d know, since I handle the books. I’m worried about Knockturn in general, and how much people’s lives and livelihoods are being affected by all of this. They’re barely getting by as it is, Harry. They work so hard. The Ministry shouldn’t make things worse for them.”
“You know I will,” Harry answers. “I’m not even going to attempt anything until I can mull it over for a while, make sure I’m going about it as safely as possible. I can always consult with Bill if I’m not one-hundred percent confident about what to do.”
Draco tilts his head to rest his cheek against Scorpius’ flaxen hair. Harry knows this is no small thing he’s asking. As far as he remembers, Draco’s never been away from his son for more than a day.
He scribbles a reply at the bottom of Draco’s letter and sends the owl back out into the dreary October afternoon. While his tea steeps, Harry leans against the window frame and looks out over his sad excuse for a garden. Maybe next spring will finally be the year that he does something with it. He thinks of Draco and Astoria’s garden, which can be seen from the windows of Draco’s study, with its elegant stone planters that overflow with cascades of flowers in the summer and the wrought iron table and chairs—a perfect place for tea. Harry huffs a laugh under his breath. He should start with pulling out all the weeds before he makes any grandiose plans.
“We’ll see,” one of the Auror growls. When Draco opens his eyes, they’re walking out the door. “Stay right here,” the tall one says over his shoulder, then slams the door behind him.
“Oh, no. Of course not. Everything she cooks is amazing.” Harry picks up the ribbon and pulls it between his fingers to smooth out the wrinkles. “I asked her to invite you.”
Careful not to get trod on, I hopped toward the middle of the group. Thankfully, the Thestrals didn’t seem perturbed by my presence among their slender legs. The rooks, however, were still seeking me. One landed beside the herd and screeched in triumph when it saw me.
“I think you should have this,” he said holding it out to me. “Molly Weasley sends me one every year, but I have more than I need. They’re really warm.”
Spending the short hours of daylight in a house with few windows was even more monotonous than stomping or flying around Potter’s little piece of Yorkshire, I soon found.
I drew back. My stomach went as cold as if I’d drunk ice water. “Help each other out,” I repeated, “since already I live with you and we might both be... interested?”
“A week, which will work out nicely. He told me about the new flat, and you won’t want a guest underfoot when you have packing to do.”
Harry doesn’t reply right away. He’s seen firsthand the effects of the war on the people around him. Of course it left a mark on the people they fought against too, even people like Narcissa Malfoy, who were complicit, but didn’t carry out the atrocities that were demanded of Voldemort’s followers. Not too long ago, Harry would have been angry at the thought that anyone on
My hands were still on his shoulders, so there was no way for him to stop me from taking a bit of his hair between my fingers and giving it a sharp pull. I leaped up before he could tighten his grip on me.
He curled over until his head was back against my shoulder, weeping, gasping for air between sobs. I tilted my head against his and dragged my arm over my chest to push my fingers into his hair, just as I had when he’d woken from a nightmare. As he shuddered, I tried to make sense of his words, tried to piece back together the events of the afternoon.
“No, from my friends, mostly. They all went back to Hogwarts or into some kind of training programme, but I wasn’t ready yet.” Harry sighs. “I still feel like I’m a mess, to be honest.”
“Yeah, well my feet took it pretty personally,” Harry grumbles. “We went down to the river later to put our feet in, and cold water does not feel good after that particular hex, let me tell you.”
They’re standing in the queue at a coffee shop near King’s Cross while they wait for the arrival of Andromeda Tonks. Draco’s aunt. The guardian of Harry’s godson. And, if the rest of the Black family is any indication, a formidable witch who isn’t to be trifled with.
A week later, Harry tries to rush past the door of 2C on his way out to the cinema, but the aroma of meat and potatoes and herbs catches him like a net. Makes treads of the heavy boots that he bought to keep his feet dry catch on the carpet of the hallway.
After they finish eating, Harry insists on taking off their shoes and crossing the sand to the water. What’s the point of coming all this way and not standing in the sea? Harry asks. They stand side by side, watching the light glint off the water. He knows they’re facing south—the sun is in front of them—but Harry can’t help imagining that he’s looking across the sea to England, an unfathomable distance away. A place he’ll be tomorrow.
Harry would rather Apparate back to London and risk vomiting after the third or fourth jump than talk right now. He follows Draco inside anyway, wincing at the light when Draco turns on a lamp. They hang up their coats and each take an armchair by the unlit fireplace.
is what he’s been holding in all week, the emotions that he didn’t want Harry to see. Harry never doubted that they were there—Draco’s unhappiness was obvious—but he never expected Draco to break down like this, to cling to Harry like they’re never going to see each other again. Desperate to reassure him, Harry shushes him until he knows Draco’s listening.
Draco shakes his head. “Harry quitting is not something I’d feel comfortable taking responsibility for. It’s not a choice I wanted him to have to make. But congratulations to both of you. That’s lovely news.”
Harry shrugs. “Oh, I wasn’t really… I was just passing the time while I waited.” He sets the book on top of the stack of battered paperbacks next to bed. “I’m not much of a reader, actually.”
. It still hardly seems real, no matter how many times Draco has repeated it to himself in the three weeks since Harry showed up here, agitated but determined, after his release from St Mungo’s.
“You’re not under arrest. We just want to ask you a few questions,” the shorter one says, attempting to sound casual.
Parkinson looks genuinely touched. The wry expression that she wore when addressing Harry falls away and she unwinds her arm from Luna’s to wrap it around her waist instead. “Thank you. You’re too sweet, really. Who knows if my little scribblings will ever see the light of day? Mother is determined to marry me off and Father has about as much appreciation for literature as a walnut, so don’t wager a single Knut on my publishing a novel just yet.”
“It’s okay.” Draco braces his hand on the bed and leans down gingerly to kiss Harry’s forehead. He hears Mrs Weasley click her tongue in disapproval, but he’s confident that she won’t say anything in the Healer’s presence. He lets his fingertips graze Harry’s cheek as before he steps away from the bed.
Three goddamn days Harry’s been waiting to hear from Draco. He ignores the pile of post that accumulated while he was gone and doesn’t set foot in his workshop. When the Floo flares, he crouches down in front of the fireplace and tells Hermione or Ron or Molly that he’s just tired from a long week and a strange bed, and he’s taking some time off.
He only waits long enough for Potter to reply, then moves briskly toward the tills, gripping the book tightly to keep his hands from shaking. He doesn’t look back before he steps back into the cold night, but Draco can feel Potter’s eyes watching.
“Look, would you like to eat here instead of carrying that all the way back up to your flat?” Malfoy asks briskly. “We don’t have to attempt a conversation, if that would make things awkward.”
“Thank you for giving me one, too. I understand why none of you wanted me here at first. I didn’t exactly take the high road myself when we were at school.”
stands in the doorway, his face shifting from irritation to blank shock to fury while Harry stares, dumbfounded. He scrambles to his feet.
“Has he, er, lived here a long time?” Harry asks, hoping that his identity won’t be of interest to someone who left England a long time ago.
It’s a cold evening, but not unbearable for their short walk. Harry looks around at the bare trees and the dull, frozen surface of the reservoir and imagines what it would be like to walk here on a summer night. Would there be families having picnics on the grass? Couples strolling the paths with ice cream cones? Do the lights of the buildings that encircle the park reflect off the water at night?
After Harry washes Malfoy’s dishes (carefully—they’re heavy and likely expensive) and returns them in a plastic bag hung on Malfoy’s doorknob, he doesn’t expect to see him again.
Harry shook it and thought ruefully of his rescue fantasy. Of course the real situation would be disappointing in comparison.
“Iss tradition, you tosser.” Potter laughs and pokes Draco’s shin with his stockinged foot. “What are you gonna wish for? You’re already rich. And pretty,” he adds with another laugh.
“I know you are,” Draco says, squeezing Harry’s knee. “But you’re only one Auror. Nothing’s going to change unless the entire department changes its attitude about Knockturn. I’m not saying they shouldn’t arrest anyone—there are certainly things that the Ministry should put a stop to. Raiding tattoo shops isn’t going to make the Alley safer, though.”
Harry remembers to pull up his hood this time, and he and Draco follow Mary out into the wet night. They crunch down the gravel walk by the light of their wands. They’ll have to wait until morning to get a better look at their surroundings—the only thing to see now is the tall wet grass being whipped by the wind, which carries the tang of the sea.
“No, and I have no intention of opening someone’s private letters,” Draco frowns. “I meant that I’d be relieved if you found something harmless inside, rather than something that might blow us halfway to Glasgow.”
, don’t let Pansy hear you say that,” Draco warns. “If there’s one thing I know about women—and I freely admit that I don’t know much—it’s that pointing out that they’re angry
in the garden. By unspoken agreement, they’re both being painfully polite to each other, which apparently is better than risking another antagonistic encounter that turns into… something else. It’s awkward and surreal, and it’s no wonder that Andromeda has picked up on it.
Just moments after he said it, he darted forward as the foal slid out onto the ground. He made sure its airways were clear and gently pressed his hands over its sides, beneath the wet folds of its tiny wings. He grinned over at me.
“Oh, Merlin, Harry, did you?” Draco asks, impressed and a little shocked. He remembers Harry’s outspokenness at school, of course, but he assumed that age had tempered his impetuosity. And he’s told Draco how hard it was for him to fit into the Auror Department after his prominent role in the war and the accolades that were heaped upon him.
And now, this—Draco’s befriending a skittish cat with a focus and patience that would shock Harry if he hadn’t seen him with Scorpius.
“Yes, I’m here,” Harry answers, moving quickly to kneel in front of the fireplace. “Is everything okay?”
Draco imagines having conversations with them sometimes: a friendly argument about which teams will make it to the Quidditch finals, or a shared anecdote with Mr Weasley about those red beams of light at the supermarket tills that read the price of each item. He wonders what it would be like to slip smoothly into that part of Harry’s life, to be greeted with approving smiles and given his own place beside Harry at their Sunday meals.
that something’s going to happen to my mother in Azkaban, that I’m going to get a letter one day, telling me…”
“Can’t you do something? You have Shacklebolt’s ear and he did win reelection on an anti-corruption platform. I doubt anyone would retaliate against you.”
Draco twists to look over at Harry. “If you don’t mind my asking, what on earth possessed you to take a job like that? You don’t seem the type to sit behind a desk all day. No offence.”
“I need to study, Potter. My aunt knows that I have to stay on top of the coursework for my curse breaking apprenticeship. Not all of us are
He slumped forward a bit as he calmed down. To compensate for the extra distance and keep rubbing his back, I slid closer. The heat of him and the faint smell of sweat pressed at my senses in the darkness.
“Markus was a fool,” Wharton tells him. “A few Galleons to the right people would have kept the Ministry out of his shop. Now the landlord’ll evict him for sure, for the trouble he got himself into. Been there for over ten years and did good business, too.”
“No, no, it was fine,” Malfoy says, looking confused for a moment. Then he seems to understand why Harry’s apologising. “If I was distracted during the meal, it was only because I was wondering whether to broach the subject of… seeing you last night. I wasn’t bothered by the restaurant at all.”
Just as he’s about to knock again, Luna’s hare Patronus comes bounding into the garden to inform him that they’re gathered on the other side of the house. Harry heads through the gate and hears Luna’s distinctive laughter before he turns the last corner. Goyle is working in the vegetable garden again, while the other three are clustered further away from the house in a small clearing surrounded on three sides by trees.
“I’m not sure, to be honest. I enjoy tutoring and I believe it’s going well, but I think the credit should go to my students’ enthusiasm more than my teaching skills.” Draco looks away from Potter and adds, “As for a career, I’m afraid that’s not possible. My criminal record would prevent me from being hired by any school.”
He flinched away from the touch, like a startled animal. I wondered how long it had been since someone touched him, deliberately or not. Whether he moved away from surprise or repulsion, he didn’t say anything about it, instead carrying the food to the cupboards. The gifts he took upstairs without opening them.
“I think I might like to be some kind of bird,” he said quietly. “I’ve always loved flying on a broom. It must be fun to glide around up there.”
it is, Potter.” Malfoy looks back down at the book with a smirk and pretends to read it for a moment. “And informative. Apparently, being centuries old provides time for a great deal of
“I should have brought it up months ago,” Harry begins after he clears the table and leads the way to the sitting room. “I wasn’t sure if I should say anything at all, but with everything that happened yesterday…”
Harry does know. He remembers the red neon sign at the restaurant, as well as the flashing blue lights of the police cars… and the white glare of headlights in his eyes when he crosses the street.
consists of one person, and one person only. It isn’t unheard of for Harry to drop by after work without sending an owl first, and if Draco can’t offer him much in the way of refreshments, at least he can entertain him in a tidy space.
“It must be a difficult day for you,” Potter said later. “I didn’t mean to make it about me. And you’re right—whatever I’ve been through in the past few years doesn’t compare.”
Harry was happy to accept his invitation to play chess, not only because he was bored, but because he understood Malfoy’s need for company this evening. It’s a difficult holiday for almost everyone, laced with grief and studded with reminders of the people who are missing from the muted celebrations.
One of the mares had separated herself from the rest of the herd a short distance away, near a small cluster of saplings. She was restless, turning her head to look at her flanks and lifting her legs against her round belly. Potter and I found a place to stand a few yards away.
Slouching with exhaustion, Draco turns head, freeing it from Harry’s calloused hands. He can feel Harry watching him, and for the first time in months, he doesn’t like it. He doesn’t like seeing himself through Harry’s eyes, now that he knows what Draco did to himself in Azkaban. The Healer’s words come back to him, telling him they wouldn’t let him dodge his punishment, and Draco winces when he thinks of what Harry said moments ago.
“Mrs Allendale, I’d bet. She’s a nosy one.” Draco gives Harry a serious look. “We’d best be careful if we don’t want people to find out. Before we’re ready, I mean. My neighbours will be the least of our worries if that happens.”
But that would probably alarm them. He’s either going to have to work this out on his own (which seems unlikely) or just try not to think about it so much (not likely at all).
Harry wraps his arms around himself and shivers. It’s so quiet that his own breathing sounds loud in his ears—even the birds have gone silent—and he remains there, lost in thought, until he hears his name called.
“Can I get you a drink to warm you up, Andi?” Harry asks, ignoring the startled expression that Draco knows he must be wearing at the prospect of being left to fend for himself.
Bitter weather arrived with the new year. Storms rolled across Yorkshire from the North Sea, blanketing the hills in snow. My daily walks became shorter and my flight time longer, since my oily feathers kept me warmer and dryer than any coat or Warming Charm could. From above, I followed hare tracks in the snow and dropped pebbles onto the frozen edges of the stream.
“Beans on toast, at my flat? I have cheese to put on top, and I still have some of the cake that Molly sent over a couple of days ago. I’d like to show you my place,” Harry says earnestly, “since you’ve had me over here so many times.”
holes in Harry’s joggers. Then Malfoy pretended to be offended that Harry was upset about it, because he was
Draco recalls his mother’s words with vague disgust. Of all the ways he thought that their bond would be revealed to Harry, a dangerous curse was not one of them. It’s certainly not the means he would have chosen, no matter how much he dreaded having to tell Harry himself one day. Maybe Draco shouldn’t be surprised that their unlikely pairing, their acrimonious and complicated history, would require something absurdly dramatic to reach its culmination.
“Any kind. Art, history, science. There’s a large art museum on the other side of the park with lots of famous paintings.”
There’s a small stack of cat food tins—in an assortment of flavours, judging by the different colour labels—on the cooker the next morning when Harry brings a freshly de-cursed music box to the kitchen for Draco to examine. He must have ducked into a shop in Portree to buy them when he and Harry split up before dinner to search for souvenirs and restaurants, respectively. The thought of Draco carrying around magically-shrunken tins of cat food in his cloak pocket for the entire evening makes Harry smile to himself.
They shook hands at the front door, as usual, and Draco solemnly expressed his gratitude for Harry’s assistance one more time.
Harry doesn’t reply. He’s staring at Draco as if seeing him for the first time, even after Draco steps back holds the door open. Harry finally takes the cue to come inside and breaks their eye contact with an uncomfortable shrug. He takes the wooden chair without being asked. Draco shuts the door and sits across from him on the bed, their knees only a few feet apart.
They carefully make their way back down the ridge. The fog seems thicker than ever and Harry can see tiny droplets of water in Greg’s dark hair. He thinks of the stag that’s somewhere nearby, its rough coat dripping as it picks its way through the grass and gorse. He still wishes he could have caught up with it. Could have let himself imagine, just for a moment…
“I never got to make a lot of choices about my life before the war ended,” Potter begins, leaning against the wall. “I hated that so much, even when things weren’t terrible or people were just trying to protect me. I told myself after the battle that I would make my own decisions about how to live my life. And if they’re bad ones, at least they’ll be mine, and I’ll deal with the consequences and try to fix things. I know I’ve made mistakes—really awful ones, usually when I was scared or under pressure—but I believe my instincts are good most of the time, so I think I can trust myself to make the right choices.”
Two single beds are tucked into the corners opposite the doorway where Harry’s standing. The ceiling slopes down over both of them, leaving barely enough headroom to sit up in bed. There’s a window between them, now covered by heavy, blue curtains that match the hydrangeas of the wallpaper. The only other furniture in the room is a low chest of drawers beneath the window and a wardrobe beside the door.
“It’s no trouble,” he answered. He met my eyes steadily for a few long seconds before pulling his hand away and turning off the lamp.
“Not since school. There were a couple blokes in the Slytherin dorms that I could trust to keep quiet. Seventh year was an absolute shitshow.” He hums a bitter little laugh. “Any port in a storm, you know. Something to take our minds off the awfulness of everything else.”
“Fine. Make a list and I’ll go.” I stepped closer and held out my hand for the dog, and she immediately turned her intelligent eyes my way. A sudden thought occurred to me. “Potter, you’re sure she isn’t another Animagus, aren’t you?”
“Stars don’t bite,” Potter says, waving his bottle at the window and chuckling at his nonsensical observation. “C’mon, tell me what you’d wish for if you saw a shooting star. What d’you want most?”
After a moment of consideration and fiddling with the bit of spare willow branch that he found by the arbour, Goyle mumbles, “Kites?”
over himself.  He feels the charm settle over him, a slight change in the air pressure in his ears, then follows Draco outside.
When the last dry plate has been returned to the cupboard and they’re standing in the light of Harry’s wand, Malfoy goes silent for a moment. He doesn’t usher Harry towards the door, as he usually does. Instead, he reaches up to tuck his fringe behind his ear and, haltingly, offers Harry tea.
I listened to him murmur soothing words to Zoë, and I wished very much that I was, in fact, heartless.
.” My head spun with the memory of Harry’s words while he and the Dark Lord circled each other in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. “Because the wand was loyal to you. Because you took my wand from me after I disarmed Dumbldore.”
Naia shifts closer to Draco and nods. Draco watches Harry stonily. Susannah’s sharp eyes are on him and Draco knows it won’t take much for her to make the connection. He silently wills Harry to take his bread and go.
At first, Harry is confused by what he sees. The rolling moorland that stretched out around them a little while ago seems to end a short distance away now. He realises that what he assumed were distant clouds are actually a heavy bank of fog, drifting noticeably closer even as they watch.
“I already wished you happy birthday today, when we had the cake!” Harry protests. He holds up his glass with a sigh. “Fine. Many happy returns of the day and may you live to celebrate one-hundred more birthdays. How’s that?”
“Yes,” I growled. “I was going to become a fucking carrion crow and literally live like an animal, rather than spend one more day in the magical world. I told you what it was like, trying to survive there. Did you really think I was going to take your money and run back at the first opportunity? And since when are you so eager for me to stay, Potter? Don’t you want your blissful, noble solitude back?”
Cleaned up and famished, Harry joins the others in the welcome shade of the arbour. The basket with the snake has been moved to the ground and covered with a thin cloth, presumably for the patient’s convalescence. And Pansy’s comfort.
Harry doesn’t see him again until lunchtime. Malfoy returns to the kitchen with nothing worse than a brief scowl when Harry looks up at him. He suspects that Andromeda had a talk with her nephew while Harry was chasing Teddy around the garden. He rather hopes Malfoy got a dressing down, though he knows Andromeda only needs a stern look and a few disappointed words to get her point across effectively. Malfoy will think twice before getting on Harry’s case again, he hopes.
“La, la, la! Cauldron full of hot, strong curse breakin’ man!” Ron sang loudly. “I am not participating in this conversation. La, la, la!”
that Ginevra plays Quidditch. Ronald is an Auror, of course. The surviving twin still runs his wildly-successful joke shop in Diagon. And judging from the brief conversation he overheard at Harry’s flat, Mr Weasley hasn’t lost his fascination with Muggle things.
, Harry thinks as he slips into bed later. This time, he’s asleep almost as soon as his head touches the pillow.
Harry’s faintly horrified to hear a man who must be close to eighty speak like that. Then what Carl (or maybe it’s Curt) just said sinks in.
Harry heads straight for the camp clearing this time when he arrives at Luna’s, a pair of new work gloves and a tin of homemade biscuits tucked under his arm. He’s the last to arrive again and the day’s work seems already well underway, making him wonder if the Slytherins are coming over after breakfast, despite Luna’s vague description of their gathering time as “around midday.” It’s an unpleasant reminder that he’s still something of an interloper at this weekly gathering, but that’s vastly outweighed by the anticipation of spending another day outside.
“Yeah, that’s how I felt, too,” Harry murmurs, looking into Draco’s eyes. “I didn’t understand how magic could do something like that. Well, I still can’t wrap my head around it, but that doesn’t matter. I’m just glad it didn’t take one day longer for us.”
It’s one thing to anticipate running into Potter in Knockturn Alley or Muggle London again. Draco’s been watching for him everywhere he goes for the past month, no matter how unlikely the place. He almost plowed into a woman in Sainsbury’s with his trolley because he was scanning the faces in the queues instead of watching where he was going.
Astoria agreed to it and made arrangements for Scorpius to go to his grandparents’ house when she has something scheduled for her photography business. Draco only requires that he can return home every three or four days to spend time with his wife and son. He’ll arrange the Portkeys for himself. Enclosed with Draco’s letter is a separate list of his standard services and rates to forward to Ernie, so that an agreement can be drawn up in advance.
To help me fall asleep, I tried my usual trick of envisioning the constellations as they would appear above me. Tonight, imagining the vast dome of the sky sent a soft pang of wonder through me. Six months ago when I used this technique, I’d felt so small and alone in the world, with no one to care for me and no place to settle, like a stray bit of parchment in the wind.
Draco knows he shouldn’t start a row with Potter, but he’s fed up with the sanctimonious and uninformed opinions about Knockturn Alley that the powerful people in the wizarding world cling to.
I almost argued that I’d be safe from those things in the upper branches of a tree, but I decided that if Potter was really offering me shelter, I’d be a fool to turn it down.
He pulls Draco toward him until their mouths are only an inch apart. There’s no challenge in Harry’s eyes this time, only hope and affection. He hesitates, as if to ask whether Draco’s ready to leap with him into the unknown, to take a chance on a kind of happiness that’s
“I think that would be fine, as long as you don’t go too high above the trees. But do watch out for the nest of Glumbumbles. It’s in a big, rotted oak tree in the southwest corner of the meadow.”
“Oh.” Potter released the word with a heavy gust of breath that seemed to leave him deflated. “I… I didn’t know.”
Harry wraps a hand around the back of Draco’s neck and kisses him deeply. The thrill of it roars through Draco, warm and electric. With a soft sound of pleasure, he tilts his head to meet Harry’s lips at a new angle, nudging them open with his own. It’s been so long since Draco kissed someone like this, but he barely has to think about how to slide his tongue against Harry’s, when to pull back enough to nip at his bottom lip, when to take a breath so he can dive back in. Maybe it’s because he’s not a nervous, fumbling teenager anymore, but Draco would rather believe that it’s because it’s
“Tea,” Draco answered, brushing his fingertips over Harry’s waist. “There’s a nice bakery down the street. We could go right now, if you like.”
When Harry had opened the door and finally saw Ron and  Hermione again, there just seemed nothing to say at first, so, instead, he took turns hugging them tight for a moment. It was so good to have them back in the country again, safe and sound.
Draco had turned his head a little, in the bed next to his was Harry. He was asleep. “Thank you,” he said, quietly, not wanting to wake Harry up. “Did you tell anyone? That we’re-?”
Malfoy was close now, but if he saw Harry watching him, he didn’t show it, just briefly nodding in Harry’s general direction. “Potter.” He’d used Harry’s last name, but it seemed devoid of any emotion: no taunt, no jab, just an acknowledgement of Harry being there, nothing more. And it took Harry by surprise.
And then he hadn’t even started thinking about all of the other things he hadn’t gotten right over time. And, even worse, all of the things he had and still regretted so much he could never make them right again.
He had moved closer and Draco apparently didn’t have to be told twice, because he Apparated them both to his suite without answering.
So, as far as Harry was concerned, the whole thing had been over when Draco’d left for Hogwarts. They’d had their fun, Harry had known for sure that he was bi and that, to him, had been the end to the benefits part.
“You were angry with me,” Harry recollected and he knew his voice sounded slightly sulky, as if Malfoy had been to blame, as if Harry himself hadn’t cocked up first. Harry felt Malfoy shrug, but he didn’t say anything.
The soft smile Malfoy gave her, was so unexpected that Harry would probably remember it forever. “Of course not,” Malfoy just said. And Harry realised that must have been why he had been casting
But it wasn’t Hermione, who now stepped out of his fireplace, sweeping the soot off of his otherwise pristine clothes.
“This was actually rather good,” Malfoy eventually admitted. He’d polished off his baguette completely by now. Harry smiled at him, somehow glad Malfoy had liked it.
Harry watched him too, obviously thinking along the same lines: his eyes glued to Draco’s wings in absolute awe. “Do you have any idea how you look? How stunning you are?”
When Draco went to the canteen the next day he’d shoved all sorts of second and third, even fourth thoughts aside. He’d promised to come, so he would.
Harry had been right about wanting to teach when he’d agreed to take on this job. Yesterday afternoon he’d taught his first class – the group of first years - and he had taken to it like a fish to water.
“I will submit my memory, of course,” Draco said and underneath his usual arrogance Harry could hear tiredness, resignation.
The alleyway they’d Apparated into after dinner was dark and secluded and Draco had been momentarily thrown off balance by the Side-Along. Which, of course, had been the only reason that Harry had pulled him in, their hips flush together.
Zulbia appeared to consist of threads of fried up dough soaked in a very, very sweet sirup that completely satisfied Harry’s taste for sugar. It was entirely nice, as was the company. The family - parents, four children now the fifth was at Cambridge - was warm and loving and Harry definitely understood why Malfoy would be living here, in this flat, with these incredibly hospitable people. It felt like a real home.
“Well, they aren’t.” Malfoy basically was still glaring, but some of the wariness had dissipated. “They just happened to have a room available when I needed one.”
Draco saw how Harry recognised his present the moment its paper wrapping fell away. “Draco, is this-?” He didn’t finish the question, turning the ebony box he held in his hands only to realise that it wasn’t the same: this one having a beautifully crafted, silver H inlayed in the dark wood.
. Now he hadn’t seen Harry for less than 48 hours and it already felt like he was missing something.
“I stuck around for almost two weeks, camping in the woods nearby, but I didn’t find a way in. I did see you go in and out, though,” he told Zabini who looked over at Harry briefly and Harry, like Zabini by the looks of it, realised this could mean Zabini had actually been working in, or close to, the Cartel’s headquarters all along.
The table had apparently been available indeed, because Abbott had taken them there. It was rather inconspicuous, tucked into a nook completely at the shadowy back of the establishment. “I prefer to sit here if possible,” Harry explained. “I don’t really fancy being gawked at.” He grinned. “I hope you don’t mind?”
After both Harry and Draco had put up a second round of the strongest Wards they could think of, just for good measure, they’d both dropped onto their beds fully clothed save their shoes.
over both Harry and himself and it was so strong even Harry was impressed, the rock bouncing back off without as much as a chance of harming them.
Or perhaps she had just vigorously shaken her head and Potter had said ‘good’ to that, Draco’s mind grimly provided.
And Harry saw it: the moment Draco’s mask clicked back into place, hiding everything that was worth anything to Harry.
“Yes, we just talked. I wasn’t allowed to bring him anything, of course.” Harry knew that, as it was part of the rather harsh regime in Azkaban: few people were allowed to visit and no one was allowed to take anything to the prisoners there, not even cake on their birthday, but what concerned Harry more was that Luna had apparently
But, annoying or not, Harry definitely needed to focus his attention on Malfoy, though. That was his job after all.
Draco started to close the door. He’d never had much of a sense of self-preservation when it came to Harry, but this apparently was where it kicked in all the same. Harry was faster, though, putting his foot in the door. Bloody Auror reflexes.
“Hey, you’re here already,” Ginny came in, not addressing either of them in particular, followed by Neville and Luna a few seconds later. Ginny turned immediately, aiming her next words at Neville. “You know it’s your turn to buy the next round. You were gone so early last week, that you didn’t get to buy a round all evening. So, your turn.” Ginny was smiling rather sweetly, but Neville wasn’t fooled and made it to the bar, immediately buying them their first round.
“Malfoy, are you alright?” Potter had that gaze again, the one where he looked at Draco so intently it almost hurt.
“You didn’t bring the cube. You know, the one that is supposed to keep me in,” Draco mentioned once they were done eating. He sounded slightly astonished, as if he’d just realised it wasn’t there and it surprised him.
It took Draco some time to ponder what struck him most about that sentence, finally deciding on the ‘we’ part. Potter seemed quite serious about that, though, because the tray held two plates, one of which he gave to Draco.
“Ah, yes, that. After everything that happened,” Malfoy said quietly, waving his hand in an elegant gesture, probably meaning the war, the battle, the trails, all of those things. “I actually prefer to be around Muggles nowadays.” He was watching his glass intently. “Nicer, less of a hassle.” His voice had dropped to an almost inaudible whisper now, his words seemingly like an afterthought, like something he might not really have wanted to say out loud.
Harry had stayed the night. After their talk about Friday and The Leaky they’d talked some more. It had been easy and about nothing in particular, until it had stopped, their banter somehow replaced by an urge to touch that was too strong to ignore. So they hadn’t, ending up in bed like the night before. And Harry had stayed.
Draco looked back at Harry, a question in his eyes. Harry just nodded. “You take it,” he whispered. He wasn’t going to put Draco in the most obvious position to get hit by the small army of guards that were most likely headed their way. Draco would probably be safer in the air.
“See, Draco, your Chosen One doesn’t even want to be rescued,” Nott sneered, while Draco just gave Harry a furtive glance that Harry would have known anywhere, because it was the sort of glance he’d been used to in school: it meant something along the lines of ‘Don’t be an idiot, Potter’.
Right. That was exactly what Harry didn’t like about this whole thing: everybody assuming things they couldn’t know anything about, just because of Malfoy’s past. It seemed unfair in its partiality and Harry had never taken well to that sort of thing, not even in relation to Malfoy, it seemed.
Because, whereas Draco had seen all of the other Aurors come by his office in Curse-Breaking to seek his professional advice on some dark object or another, Harry had never done so. Not even once in all of the four years Draco had worked at the Ministry now.
“Yes, I suppose it was. At least I haven’t been hexed,” Malfoy smirked, but it was clearly not meant maliciously, more of an attempt at relieving the tension that was undoubtedly there. “And Blaise is always nice company.”
When Draco looked into Harry eyes, however, he just saw curiosity there and Draco decided Harry had made his rather uncharacteristic attempt at diplomacy, because he hadn’t wanted Draco to feel insulted.
Malfoy didn’t say anything for a beat, then concluded. “So it’s about your partner. Is it something you can share?” He didn’t add ‘with me’, but Harry heard it all the same.
Furthermore, Wood was back now. And he clearly liked Potter. And by the looks of it Potter liked him, too. Which was fine: they were fitting in a way that Draco and Potter never would be. Potter and Wood had known, and liked, each other for years, sharing the same friends. Which meant that for them everything would be so much easier. They would be happy.
And that was the thing really: Draco made Harry happy, exceedingly so. It was strange perhaps, unexpected certainly, but there it was: Draco had somehow proved to be the missing piece of his puzzle.
“Is it?” Harry’s voice sounded slightly strangled and Draco knew that probably meant something, but he felt so warm and safe now that he really didn’t want to move or say anything else. So he sort of nodded without moving his head too much, humming affirmatively.
“So Potter visited you? That doesn’t seem like such a bad thing. It’s about time you started seeing people again and he’s really quite decent. You could do much worse,” Blaise eventually said.
Draco couldn’t help but smile a little at this unexpected change of subject. He didn’t really know how Potter’s mind worked and he didn’t think he ever would, or wanted to. He really didn’t want to.
Harry couldn’t help but smile back. “Oh, give it here,“ he said mock-fighting Malfoy for his espresso and taking a sip without thinking. It really didn’t taste anything like coffee.
“Of course you’ll have to stay in hospital for a while to recuperate, but you’re going to make a full recovery.” Draco had addressed Weasley in his professional voice, still bracing himself, though. He had done a good job of healing him, but he knew Weasley had never liked him. That was bound not to have changed all of a sudden.
“She still isn’t. Her portrait is a right pain in the arse. We actually had to cover it up to silence her,” Harry replied. “But the house definitely needs some work. I would like to do it up a bit, at least the main rooms. I imagine I’ll have time for that. When I’m in Auror training I’ll at least have my weekends off.”
“Here you are. Your schedule,” Agatha said briskly and Harry knew exactly what would be on the parchment she’d put on his desk. He’d actually asked for it himself.
Okay, it hadn’t been first thing, more like fifth thing, but come Monday lunchtime Harry decided to pay a visit to Curse-Breaking, making his way to Malfoy’s office there easily, because he knew exactly where it was. It was the fortunate side effect of him having successfully evaded it for so long.
“Like when I’m with-, when I see-.” Normally Draco would certainly have been annoyed with the man for not even being able to finish a simple sentence, but now Harry was so close – when had that actually happened? – and he was watching him so intently that Draco really couldn’t see anything else than the mesmerising green of Harry’s eyes.
Draco looked around. There really wasn’t anything else that he needed, nothing else to add before this flat could become his home.
Harry reached out to Draco, wanting him close, but Draco didn’t let him, stopping him as he said: “Yes, Potter, I get it.” Draco’s face was even, completely indifferent as was his tone.
It had been so long, because even though Draco and Astoria had had an open marriage (they’d both had different needs, so to speak), it had been years since he’d last pulled someone.
The wards, however dark, were of the sort that the owner would be able to pass without having to take them down, just like the wards on a house really, so whatever had been in the middle most probably wasn’t there anymore. All evidence Draco and Penelope had found had consistently been pointing to that.
about those evenings, shooting through his mind - but Blaise didn’t do any of that. Instead the three of them just talked, thankfully not touching on anything that really mattered.
Harry hadn’t noticed a spell had grazed his hip, until he saw Draco watching it. Something had cut Draco’s arm, causing his right sleeve to hang in loose threads, the blood underneath dry already.
Work on the flat had proceeded quite a lot since Harry had decided to start helping Draco again. The larger pieces of furniture were mostly in place, the walls had obviously been painted, the kitchen had been fitted, of course, and today the bathroom had been redone.
“Well,” there was the faintest level of doubt to Zabini’s voice, that was rather unlike him, “I think I can probably get us in, but there’s always a chance I’ll set something off, you know. It’s worth a try, though.”
“So you don’t know who’s been teaching Curse-Breaking for the past seven months?” Blaise was not just wearing a smirk anymore: it had now transformed into a decidedly
Draco swallowed, hard. “Yes, it-. It reminds me of my mother.” He heard his voice break a little, couldn’t help it. And all of a sudden Harry was close, watching him.
Then he kneeled on the bed, just one knee on the mattress, and bent down to kiss his boyfriend, softly, on the cheek, stubble against his lips. Harry turned to meet his lips almost instantly.
It probably was why he actually answered honestly: “Neither, but I thought I might get some takeaway.”
Ron had been discharged from St Mungo’s yesterday morning so they didn’t meet each other there anymore, but Harry had asked him to go shopping for things for his flat anyway, which had resulted in them buying paint: a beautiful soft grey for his living room and a relaxing dark blue for his bedroom. And furthermore they’d been looking at furniture again, and at kitchens, wizarding ones.
“Oh, no need to worry, Draco. The powder is quite harmless in itself. Its effects will wear off within half an hour,” Nott added, after having studied Draco’s face for a moment. “And I have to admit that even though Potter wasn’t meant to snog
At first Harry didn’t really believe it when he thought he heard the sobs lessen. But then they slowly subsided altogether and when Harry looked at Draco’s face he looked straight into the silver of his eyes.
Granger nodded along with her husband: “Thank you.” Her voice sounded sincere, which was somewhat less surprising: she had already been quite decent to him when they’d both taken their eighth year at Hogwarts. She’d been one of the few who had been.
Zabini shook his head. “Not necessarily. The sort of potions and pills the Cartel manufacture usually take a long time. Some would have to be brewing for several days or even longer, constantly giving off smoke in the process. We should be careful, though,” Zabini watched Harry pointedly here, “I heard the Cartel don’t usually brew at night, but we can’t take anything for granted.”
Luna shook her head. “No, I just made sure you were given a bed in the same room. I imagine people have guessed, though. The way you came in today was-. Well, it was quite something. People in the reception area must have seen what you are. And I suppose the rest is obvious. You had a really hard time letting Harry go.” She smiled her soft, ethereal smile. “Veela are quite protective.”
“Come, let’s dance.” Ginny’s voice startled Harry out of his gaze. She was leaning over his shoulder from behind and talking in Harry’s ear to make sure he’d hear her over the music. He gave her a short nod and made his way out of the booth. Harry wasn’t great at dancing, but a club was hardly the Yule Ball, now was it? Here you just had to be able to sort of shift your weight from one leg to the other and
And Harry didn’t know why he did it – perhaps it was the quiet of the night or the realisation that he wasn’t entirely alone in this or just that he wasn’t fully awake yet - but before he knew he’d done it, he had taken Malfoy’s hand, interlacing their fingers.
“Thank you for dinner. It was really good,” was the only thing he said, hoping Harry would know how much he meant it. Then he Apparated out.
But now it was over, whatever it was he and Astoria’d had was over, and he found himself staring at Harry again, knowing it was stupid, knowing there was nothing between them. Harry didn’t want anything with Draco, didn’t even like him anymore.
Draco only realised how hungry he was, when he finally took his first comforting bite of curry and rice.
Harry had to admit he felt rather relieved and he told himself that was because he would finally be able to do something real tonight, something that could actually make a difference in this whole Cartel case.
It had been his first assignment for the Ministry and Draco had kept the spoon ever since. No one had actually wanted it back anyway.
Harry shrugged. Okay, so Malfoy didn’t really seem to understand why Harry was here, bringing him lunch. Which wasn’t all too strange, because honestly, Harry had some difficulties coming up with a reason too. “I just supposed you might like a baguette and since you probably wouldn’t have time to go to the canteen and I was heading there anyway, well …,” he inadequately started to explain.
“Are you going to have lunch again with, erm-, your mother? Today?” Harry asked, feeling he should say something now he’d opened his eyes. It would be awkward to just keep silently staring and although Harry didn’t remember who exactly Draco had said he’d have lunch with last Sunday, he thought it would be a nicely neutral subject.
him, that he could take care of himself. “You should just look the part when you’re with me and get on with your other job when you’re not.”
“You do?” Harry hadn’t known that. He’d just known he himself had avoided having anything to do with Malfoy since the prat had started working as a Curse-Breaker for the Ministry some four years ago, after apparently having enjoyed an astoundingly successful career at Gringotts.
fast, though. That, together with his rather perfect aim, had always made him good at duelling. Which was something this fucker was definitely going to find out.
Oh well, on second thought, Draco didn’t think any amount of alcohol could be quite enough to make this awkward situation any more bearable.
“See anything you like?” This time Draco’s words did come out, although they might not have been too easy to discern.
Harry had always known that Malfoy had a French sounding name, but he hadn’t known the prat actually spoke the language, fluently apparently. At least enough so to engage in conversation and have people hanging on his every word.
Draco wasn’t surprised that the news that he wasn’t allowed to carry a wand hadn’t reached Potter, however. Naturally it hadn’t. Why would Potter even care?
“But that’s exactly the point, isn’t it?” Harry reacted, more heatedly that he had wanted to. “If Malfoy hadn’t been an Ex Death Eater we wouldn’t even have been here. We’d have questioned him, asked him to come to St Mungo’s to see whether he’d actually been obliviated and that would have been that. We just would have told him to come to hospital again once Hermione’d be back. We wouldn’t even have
Here Malfoy was silent for a beat. He swallowed, then started to talk again: “I know it‘s probably not standard procedure, but I’d like to go to Diagon today if that’s at all possible. There’s something I’d like to look for at Flourish and Blotts. And I would also like to go home, just to get some clothes and toiletries.” Malfoy sounded as arrogant as ever, but there seemed to be a question to his words, just a hint, and he certainly wasn’t
Harry had dreamt the potions thieves had struck again, but this time they’d come while Malfoy was in the shop, doing his job. They’d entered silently like ghosts, so fast that Malfoy hadn’t had much of a chance of defending himself.
Malfoy watched him as if it took him some time to process. Then he smiled languidly and kicked the door to the suite closed behind him, steadying himself on the wall at the same time. “I really don’t care where you sleep, Potter.”
Mathew was about to cast at Draco again and the only thing Draco knew was that that couldn’t happen. It. Just. Couldn’t.
“Malfoy, are you asleep?” Potter’s question was soft, not as impatient or annoyed as Draco would have expected it to be. It was the reason Draco opened his eyes: he would have wanted to be asleep, though, or even better still, unconscious, anything not to have witnessed his stupidly nearly fainting into Potter’s arms. He really could have gone his whole fucking life without ever experiencing
Draco realised his mistake as he was saying it: Harry’s look of utter disgust an unmistakable signal and somewhere a part of him wanted to explain, to tell Harry that he wasn’t particularly sure his father should get out, either – he had been avoiding visiting his father for a reason – but that, well, it seemed to be really important to his mother and Lucius still
And Draco answered him honestly, because, well, it had been such a long time since anyone had looked at him like that, like they really wanted to know.
Harry had expected Draco to agree with him easily, but Draco seemed lost in thought. “Your words still carry a lot of weight in the wizarding world and, well, I can imagine him trying. Five years is a long time to be in there,” Draco eventually said.
“I didn’t realise it was this late already” Harry said. “I’m sorry.” He sounded completely genuine. “I hadn’t expected it to be only me, though. For this house-warming dinner, I mean. And it’s just before ten, so I thought I might just, you know, still catch dessert or something.”
Blaise was early today, but then again: Blaise pretty much came whenever he pleased. Draco knew Blaise wouldn’t comment on anything though, probably noticing the signs of Draco’s weakness – there was very little that Blaise didn’t see - but refraining from saying anything about it, sparing both Draco’s and his own feelings.
“No. no, it isn’t.” Malfoy looked both tired and like he was bracing himself all of a sudden. “Well, I’d better go up to my office. Get the last spells on that cabinet to yield.”
Hermione had been friends with Blaise for a good few years now. They’d started as Unspeakables at roughly the same time and had gotten along surprisingly well almost straight away. From then on a tentative friendship had formed and at some point Blaise had just been added to the irregular mix of Harry’s friends that showed up on their Friday evening get-togethers at the Leaky Cauldron.
“Because-. Well, it obviously was a mistake.” Draco’s voice sounded cold again, but there was a whisper of a question to his tone that Harry held on to.
It was a good thing they had shoved the new furniture away from the walls, because even though the spells for painting were not supposed to leave any mess whatsoever, they did tend to misfire with unpractised casting.
That wasn’t what came next, however. “Draco means dragon, doesn’t it?” Harry stated, amusement more apparent now.
They were sitting opposite each other in the easy chairs that Zabini’s office seemingly harboured. Malfoy was close enough for Harry to see the stormy grey of his eyes.
It was true and Ron knew enough of the workings of the Auror Department not to even ask why Harry apparently had to come into work on a Saturday.
“So, how are you and Malfoy doing?” Harry didn’t like the malicious undertone of Terry’s voice one bit. Well, Harry had decided he really didn’t like the whole of Terry all that much, come to think of it.
Plus dancing with Ginny always felt kind of familiar: he didn’t have to prove anything to her. They knew each other far too well for that. Their relationship had ended with the War, really, but their familiarity hadn’t. They still worked well together, which meant Harry felt quite at ease standing on the crowded dancefloor with her now, doing his one leg to another thing.
All of that didn’t matter now, though. It had been a markedly busy week, with a group of potions smugglers from Europe also infiltrating the UK market - almost untraceably so - like ghosts. It was maddening.
It seemed to be a genuine question and Draco couldn’t help but be a bit surprised. Of course he didn’t mind: he really didn’t appreciate people gawking either, although when they looked at him it was for an entirely different reason.
“No, I-, I rather hoped we could, you know, do it again?” Harry’s own voice wasn’t just tinged with hope now, it was positively swimming in it.
The man took them to an office space at the back of the club – it was probably his, since he obviously kept some of his clothes there – and he proceeded to give Harry a T-shirt.
While Malfoy took to staring at the road again, Harry stared at him, thinking about how this evening had probably turned out to be the strangest one in a very long time: he was sitting next to Malfoy in what he could only describe as companionable silence. It was unsettling and quite comforting at the same time.
.” Draco hadn’t wanted the despair to seep through his every word, but it had anyway. He was so done with not having something as basic as a kitchen.
So Draco let himself fall onto the mattress. For a brief moment he vaguely thought about asking Harry one important question: would he like to stay, with Draco, just for now, just for tonight, just for old time’s sake? But it was no use, for as soon as Draco’s head hit the bed he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
Zabini nodded again, obviously thinking. “You will need these,” he then said, producing two thin bracelets made out of braided leather.
When he rounded the corner and saw their spot, Draco saw him straight away, though. Harry was there alright. And so were Granger and Weasley.
“Thank you.” This was the second time this week that Harry was startled out of his thoughts by Blaise Zabini and he rather sullenly noted he shouldn’t let it become a habit.
Draco tried to say as much, but for some reason the words just didn’t make it out and he ended up having to lean heavily on Potter just to get back to bed.
“No, I’m still sure I don’t remember.” Malfoy sounded slightly more like his arrogant self again when he answered Terry. “As a matter of fact I-, I don’t remember anything about coming here.” He looked straight at Harry and it was as if he was willing Harry to believe him, to find the truth in his eyes without actually having to ask.
Harry watched it, then thought of something: “Does that mean someone is in there, brewing?” he asked Zabini, indicating the smoke.
“Are you actually all right? Perhaps you’re not accustomed to the concept of praise?” Malfoy now added. It came out the drawl Harry was used to, but it also sounded amused, as if Malfoy couldn’t quite help himself.
“So, some of these bruises were in places where you could actually see them?” Harry heard the Auror in him ask next.
“Well, it’s most likely they won’t develop any further. We think you’ve completed the transition by now, so you probably won’t develop full-grown wings,” Luna seemed to regret that. “But after your birthday we will know for sure. They might still change,” she sounded much more cheerful at that prospect. “The humps will almost certainly recede again, though, so you won’t have them all the time. They’ll just be there when a Veela would have used its wings. So when you’re angry, provoked, protective.”
The man had obviously seen him looking, for he started to explain: “I’ve been working this case undercover, so it probably won’t come as a surprise to you that I’m wearing a Glamour. For all intents and purposes you’re going to know me as Francois.”
When they had walked for some time, Zabini guiding them to a deserted alleyway, Harry slowed down, looking at Zabini ever so briefly. Zabini just nodded.
“Well, I’ve only redone the main rooms and it took quite some time, but I like it like this,” Harry knew he sounded more genuine than he had wanted to. Malfoy was not a friend - he was a witness, or a suspect, or whatever he was at this point - but not a friend.
After he’d been given the assignment Harry had had the afternoon and the early evening to pack and say his goodbyes to some friends. Then he’d had to leave, so now here he was. He hadn’t really been thinking about where Malfoy would be staying, but the building Harry was currently facing definitely looked like the sort of hotel the git would be staying at: it was old, conveniently smack in the city centre - just off the largest market square in Brussels - and undoubtedly extremely posh.
Harry was going to be okay. The elegant lines of Draco’s diagnostics showed beyond the shadow of a doubt that Harry was going to be okay.
“Yes, of course I could.” He tried to sneer, but he realised he was slurring. The two didn’t go well together.
Harry cupped his jaw, drawing Draco in for a sweet, lazy kiss that lasted much longer than he had anticipated.
“Yes,”’ Malfoy conceded, “but this one is particularly nasty. It doesn’t just crush anyone who gets in, but it actively entices people to enter. There’s a whole fuckload of spells and curses on it to make it work.”
Potter didn’t comment on it, though. “It won’t hurt as much this time.” he said as he sat down on the bed again, phial in hand.
“Potter?” There was genuine astonishment to his tone. “How did you even-?” Draco stopped himself short, because it was a stupid question. He had wanted to ask how Potter had gotten hold of his address, but Potter was in fact the head of his department: of course he would have access to that sort of information.
On impulse he stepped back, not wanting Draco to enter, holding him back and by doing so simultaneously taking himself out of the room again too.
“They’re coming! The Aurors have breached ..,” the wizard, seemingly running to warn Nott, didn’t even get a chance to actually finish his sentence, before he was effectively shoved out of the way by a spell.
They didn’t watch each other for long, though, only taking a short moment before giving in to the invisible force that seemed to pull them together once more: all warm hands, hot skin and hungry touches. And it was so utterly glorious that it stopped all conscious thought, reducing Draco’s world to just intense sensations and sheer need.
“What did you tell her about me? You know, the girl next to you at dinner?” It was the first thing Harry asked Malfoy after they had started walking back to their Apparition point.
“So, officially you’re going to be assigned to protect someone from threats he’s been receiving. That will give you enough of an opportunity to also inconspicuously investigate the Dragon Cartel.”
Hermione seemed to ponder that for a while, then went on:  “But there were some wizards there, though. I definitely saw Blaise Zabini and I even think I might have seen Draco Malfoy.”
Harry smiled. “And I’m really glad to see you too.” He didn’t sit up and his voice was a little hoarse, but he looked so much better already.
When everything had become solid again, Harry looked around to find he was in a small office in what seemed to be an otherwise deserted building. There was a table and two chairs and not much else: his agent still noticeably missing too.
And now it was Monday and Draco had been so relieved to see Harry again that he hadn’t been able to think about how he should navigate this whole thing or what it could mean. He’d just immediately felt settled and grounded in a way he hadn’t experienced all weekend. Not since he’d left Harry’s on Saturday.
“Hey, Harry,” she just said and he must have looked surprised, because she smiled and started to explain: “I promised Hermione I’d call in on you and this just seemed like the right time. Do you mind if I come through?”
!” Draco’s voice wasn’t loud exactly – one could never be too careful in their common room, even if it
Luna watched him with a surprised frown. “Harry, it was just after the war. You were so busy doing other things.” And Harry knew she was right. He had been busy helping to chase down any remaining Death Eaters at the time, in the meantime trying to figure out how to manage his personal life, when everything he thought he had with Ginny had come crashing down.
When Draco’d woken up the next day, it had been later than usual. He had gotten home from work sometime after one in the morning, which had been a ridiculous time even for him, and then he’d been so tired he’d just fallen into bed immediately, waking up with a slight headache and still tired somehow. Feeling sad.
He was glad now that Hermione had directed her question at Draco immediately. Draco, however, clearly hadn’t expected it yet, flinching a bit. “Well, apparently. I obviously don’t remember.” He sounded arrogant, indifferent, but Harry now thought he could hear the uncertainty underneath.
“Not that again.” Draco’s voice was just utterly tired now. “I don’t need your help, Potter.” The words were there, but his voice lacked conviction as if he couldn’t bring himself to fight anymore.
“No, I-.” Well, he didn’t have to tell Harry about his rather spoilt childhood. “Back in France Astoria always used to cook.” And because he knew how that sounded: “She liked it. She preferred me not to interfere.”
Draco had to remind himself firmly that they were friends now, at least more or less, so that would explain why Harry was being nice. And besides Harry was
And Draco wanted to say something cutting, something along the lines of wishing Blaise good luck with that, because no one here tonight would actually join such a party. Well, except for Harry of course.
“And you? Are you going to be paired with someone else?” Draco asked Penelope, because to him it somehow felt like she was saying goodbye all of a sudden.
, just to see seconds pass into minutes when he heard something outside the cottage. He felt himself tense, all his muscles ready to do whatever they had to, if this was an unwelcome intruder again and he only relaxed when the familiar figure of Blaise Zabini, finally,
“So, in a minute you will be asked to step into the next room. Your mission is simple: extract the witness,” the witch instructed. “Are you ready?”
Harry regarded him, looking like he wanted to say something one moment, but obviously deciding against it the next.
As opposed to Malfoy of course. Whose family had very much been on the wrong side of the war: Malfoy had only escaped imprisonment, because of the testimony Harry had given on his and his mother’s behalf.
“Of course you did.” Draco said it still whispering, managing to sound rather disdainful, while simultaneously shooting Harry an amused smirk. “Let’s just say, you’re not supposed to be able to push it off. That is, if you’re not
Malfoy didn’t say anything straight away, though, only looking a bit confused for a moment and then he smiled, just slightly, as if he’d just been able to reign it in before it would have become a real smile. “Yes, so it seems,“ he answered, flatly, still with that half-smile on his lips. “I was invited to a gala ball that would have been very unwise for me not to attend,” he then elaborated as if that explained everything.
The wards curled around the cube in a beautifully thin web that Malfoy lazily cast at again, making the silvery blue lines turn into intertwined lines of gold, red and a deep dark blue. And then Malfoy just started taking them apart, slowly, carefully, one by one, patiently talking his students through every step.
Zabini didn’t even nod, just cast a diagnostic spell by way of an answer. There were wards, but they were considerably less than there had been on the outer layer and Harry recognised most of them as the sort of basic wards even he had been taught to dismantle. Zabini started on them straight away.
“I thought as much.” Malfoy sounded infuriatingly smug - Harry could make out that much - but there seemed to be something else underneath, something Harry couldn’t quite put a finger on.
Draco and Harry both looked around the room, filing it to memory for future reference. Then went on.
“You trusted him,” Draco simply answered and his voice sounded soft. He knew about trust and where it could lead and although he didn’t know whether he could ever quite forgive himself for all the trust he’d put in the wrong people when he was younger, he found he didn’t have any difficulty making allowances for Penelope.
Draco only managed a warm smile against Harry’s lips, before they were kissing again, soft but insistent, breakfast all but forgotten.
“No,” Harry’s voice cracked a little, while he kept watching Draco, apparently unable not to. “I-, this isn’t my bed,” he added rather lamely. “It’s a spare bedroom.”
His Auror reflexes kicked in straight away. “Francois,” he heard the urgency to his own voice, “I think we’ve got company.” Zabini didn’t really watch the corner where Harry had just spotted the suspicious person, instead just inconspicuously sweeping the room as he put on his cloak.
Draco had dressed with care, eventually settling on a black pair of trousers that did his backside real favours and a fitted shirt in a beautiful, slate grey of which he left the top two buttons teasingly undone.
“I think I know what the spell is doing to Draco.” Draco. Why did this Healer call him Draco? What had earned him the right to call Draco by his first name? “The spell obviously makes him dream and if my readings are correct they aren’t pleasant dreams. I presume we’re dealing with some sort of nightmare spell that was designed for torture. Whoever attacked you must have wanted to extract information.”
Harry smiled at him softly. “So should you.” Draco got up, even though he felt warm and content and not particularly inclined to go anywhere. “And Draco, I’m glad you came over tonight,” Harry added and his voice sounded so genuine that Draco had trouble getting it out of his head.
Here he glanced at Draco who gave him a smile. “They did say they were easing us in, so the assignments are probably going to get more demanding.”
It was an astoundingly simple question, but Draco didn’t think the answer could ever be easy. “No, not really. But my mother … . I don’t know how she’ll take it. It-. I just don’t know,” he answered honestly.
And now he had to come up with another plan, although he really had no idea at all what that could be.
From there on in the odds were looking up, because even though the Cartel still definitely had more people fighting, the Aurors and Ministry hit-wizards that Zabini had brought in were even more definitely better at it.
Harry felt the moment Draco gave in: returning the kiss, his lips soft and insistent against Harry’s own. Harry threaded his hands into Draco’s hair so hard it must hurt, but he couldn’t really care: Draco needed to be closer. So his other arm snaked around Draco’s waist and he felt Draco’s hand on his hip, his other one on the nape of Harry’s neck, while Draco deepened their kiss almost desperately.
“Ready to go to mine? I’m not connected to the Floo network.” Malfoy said it a bit apologetically, his voice sounding slightly tense. He was holding out his arm for Harry to be Side-Alonged.
“You’ve been bleeding again,” the concern in his voice was definitely audible, but he really couldn’t be bothered.
quite hungry,” he said, making no attempt to move, just gently pushing a stray strand of hair out of Draco’s face.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. “Of course, it’s your birthday. Your thirtiest no less,” he said, gently kissing Harry again. And again, just for good measure. “So I thought I’d make you breakfast.”
Malfoy looked like he was worried and the first conscious thought Harry had, was that he’d actually never seen that particular look on Malfoy’s face before.
Harry didn’t answer the question - although Draco thought he saw him flush a bit - instead saying: “Just go to sleep.”
And of course Draco had confronted him, granted: after a few encouraging glasses of Firewhiskey and he’d found out that to Harry it had never been serious,
And this Sunday evening was no exception, because here Draco was - sitting, quietly reading – when he heard his doorbell, because his flat, being in a mainly Muggle neighbourhood, did actually have a doorbell. Draco got up straight away, hoping … .
Then he heard the sound of a door being opened and retreating footsteps. Draco supposed the Healer must have left and by the sound of it Potter had left with her.
Potter smiled at him. “Okay.” So he did, he came in, immediately eyeing the magnificent effects the Constellation Box had had on the living room, while Draco belatedly realised he hadn’t ended the spell yet.
Malfoy considered him for a moment, apparently not entirely sure how Harry had meant this question. “Yes, actually,” he then answered, “As I obviously
Guilt wormed its way into Harry’s consciousness together with the realisation and now it proved to be very easy to look away from Draco’s chest all of a sudden.
That was when Malfoy groaned, though, and Harry, panic rising, registered it was too late to bolt, because Malfoy had also opened his eyes.
But it hadn’t been. On Sunday Draco hadn’t seen Harry, but come Monday Draco’d had to work the day shift again and Harry had visited Ron.
Harry decided it must be the first – or at least he hoped it was - so he sat himself down in the hallway, his back to Draco’s door. There still seemed to be no movement, no sound in the flat. Perhaps Blaise was wrong and Draco wasn’t even home.
To Harry’s slight surprise, the film had really been quite entertaining and it was only when it had ended that Harry watched Draco again.
Harry couldn’t help but smile a little. “Yes, they do. Just so you know, we’re not all completely useless because we’re not in Covert Ops.”
When they got back to their booth Harry shot a quick glance at where he had seen Malfoy earlier. He found he couldn’t quite resist.
Harry shoved Draco out of the way seemingly without a second thought, deflecting the curse the witness cast and casting his signature
“But you were seen,” Harry’s partner Terry now piped up, “The perpetrator nearly ran you over and according to our witness you actually looked him in the eye. Still sure you don’t remember?” Terry’s tone was decidedly unpleasant, insinuating something that Harry was not quite ready to believe yet.
Saturday night at the club was one thing. The rest of the week was another. It was as it had been for years now.
“I really do hope our assignments will get better over time,” Harry complained, when the Ministry Wards around the premises had been put up and they were finally leaving the scene for the day. “Now I just seem to be guarding a house that no one actually wants to enter to begin with.”
“Of course,” Harry simply answered. “Mr Mauvay showed me a few very interesting specimen the other day.
“And you’re going to live at Grimmauld Place, the old Black house.” Draco continued, when Harry didn’t seem inclined to fill the silence, knowing it was what Harry intended to do. Harry had told him how his godfather Sirius Black had bequeathed the house to him. “It didn’t seem like a particularly cheery place last time I was there, but that might also have had quite a lot to do with my Great-Aunt Walburga. I don’t remember her being particularly cheery either,” Draco added, aiming for a light tone.
Malfoy had found and bought the book he had wanted quickly, almost before anyone, except for the wizard at the till obviously, could have noticed. Then he cast a quick
The way out was not as smooth as it could have been. Harry found he was slightly less stable than he’d thought he’s be and, well, not bumping into people didn’t really seem to be an option. In his defence: it
He really hadn’t thought about it yet, hadn’t had time to think about anything other than work much over the past week. “Not really, but I suppose I need to do something about my flat.” He could hear the tiredness lacing his words. He didn’t actually mind picking things for his flat, not really, but this week had been difficult, draining, and he felt like just sitting down and reading a book more than anything else.
“Well, obviously.” It was clear Malfoy would gladly have done an eyeroll here, but Harry realised Malfoys probably didn’t do eyerolls. Too busy being posh. Malfoy apparently did deem fit to elaborate, though: “I was told you would start your other job this morning and that you should be available for that throughout the daytime, mostly. In the evenings you should be free to be my bodyguard, so as to not arouse suspicion.”
So Harry aimed for a detached, objective tone when he continued: “We need to talk about where we’re going to sleep. I’m afraid we’ll have to be in one room for the night.”
Potter set to undo the buttons of Draco’s shirt, fumbling a bit as he did so: they were small and many.
“Where did you find it?” Malfoy was indicating the box, his voice sounding somewhat urgent all of a sudden.
Draco had really taken his sweet time in the bathroom, but when he came out he was completely dressed, in clothes that were quite clearly not pre trials - the materials rather course and his jeans not even close to form-fitting - but still he managed to look undeniably good, attractive. It probably didn’t help that his shirt hadn’t been buttoned up yet, hanging open and showing the creamy expanse that was his skin. It was very hard to miss.
“You mean, go on a date?” Draco asked, quite sure, on some level, that putting it like that would mean that Harry would back out. Which would conveniently clarify things in a heartbeat.
They didn’t have to wait long, because the next moment the door was forcefully opened and three men came in, their wands at the ready.
Eventually he had to, though. He had to work the afternoon shift after all, so he towelled himself off, slinging the towel on his hips afterwards.
Just the blond boy Draco had seen the first time he had joined everyone at The Leaky, hadn’t shown up anymore after they’d shared their news. Harry hadn’t seemed to mind though, saying that if someone couldn’t accept them being together, they hadn’t been real friends to begin with.
Harry smiled at Draco and Draco just needed a moment to savour this, the ease with which they interacted now. Out of everything he hadn’t expected to happen this year, this had probably been the most surprising: the fact that he was on more than good terms with Harry Potter of all people, that they seemed to get along in a way he hadn’t at all thought possible, their amicability almost shocking in its simplicity.
When Harry didn’t answer, Blaise just smiled. “Oh, more than once. Very interesting.” Harry could only think of how, if Blaise would have chosen to become an Auror, he would have made an extraordinarily terrifying interrogator. “You have to understand Draco won’t tell me anything really, so I have to ask you,” Blaise clarified, followed by his next question: “So anything else to tell? Does he stay the night?”
And so were Harry and Draco, resuming their fighting dance, battling back to back or side by side as if they’d never done it any other way.
“I would have pegged you for a tea drinker,” Harry remarked. He’d just been looking for something to say, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t true.
“Well, erm, Janet McClery isn’t here yet. We were in Curse-Breaking before the break and she hasn’t come back. She couldn’t take down the curse we were supposed to erm, break yet, and she was detained.” The girl had been gazing down while she was talking, but now she looked up for a moment before gazing straight back down again. “I thought she would have been back by now, but she isn’t and-.”
Granger and Mrs Weasley look unhappy—the latter is flushed pink with outrage—but they return to their seats without another word.
They go around the table until no one has any more ideas. When Parkinson reads the list back, it now includes building a bridge over the stream (Luna, with a nod to Malfoy’s stonework skills), fireworks (Malfoy), putting on some kind of musical or theatrical performance (Parkinson), and an expedition to look for a secret colony of fairies, complete with maps and magical compasses and spy glasses (Luna, of course).
I huffed in disbelief. “You turned down the most prestigious award in magical Britain for a herd of Thestrals? Only you, Potter.”
“I gathered, thank you. It looks delicious. I might need to ask for a spoon, I think,” Draco replies.
Draco hears, “Ignored several regulations” and “Head Auror” and “If Auror Potter hadn’t firecalled…”
, followed by the crash of something hard falling. Harry hits his head on the ceiling and fumbles his wand.
“This isn’t far from one,” Harry remarks, looking around the spacious nursery. He doesn’t even see a cot in here, which means this room is just for playing in. Before they bought their cottage in Ottery St Catchpole, Ron and Hermione had Rose’s cot wedged into a corner of their bedroom and all her toys fit into one basket in the sitting room.
“Just some extra food and supplies,” Harry says, nudging the box into the corner. “I didn’t want to use up the things that you bought for yourself and Teddy.”
“Why wasn’t it pleasant to come home? Because of where you lived?” Potter asked. He had settled in the armchair, waiting for the kettle to boil.
“Yeah, fine. Do you know a place?” He sighed when I shook my head. “All right, I’ll find someplace away from any towns after lunch. Just pop in and out quickly to scout it out. Will that do?” he asked me, as if I were demanding that he help with some unpleasant chore, rather than proposing a nice outing to the seaside.
“There’s another one in the cupboard to the left of the sink,” Xeno says, then sings out, “Mind the geraniums!” just before he disappears back into the other room.
Now, with Potter sulking behind me, I began to consider what my life would be like in another year or five or ten. He was my only companion, the only person in the world who cared if I lived or died. And yet he was so determined to stay cut off from other human contact.
“The Oak King reaches the peak of his power at Midsummer, then the balance begins to tip in favour of the Holly King, who’s at
Andromeda’s feeling better by dinner time, so Malfoy takes the opportunity to study upstairs all evening. Harry resists the temptation to interrupt him. Malfoy did spend all day helping take care of Teddy, after all, and Harry was grateful for the company. He chuckles as he stirs the pot of pasta on the hob, thinking how inconcievable spending hours in Malfoy’s presence without bickering was just two weeks ago. At the very least, they’ve finally figured out how to get along.
,” Draco suggested. “I would really like to get to the bottom of this so that I can breed her. One clutch of hatchlings will be a significant boost to my finances. I don’t enjoy talking about this, Potter, but the war reparations that my family paid left us with almost nothing. It’s enough to provide for my mother in her small house in France. I, however, depend on my own work to support myself. I’m not asking for your sympathy, of course, but I’m sure you can understand the urgency of the situation.”
Jerome gently leads Draco into a wooden chair with a floury hand on his arm, then goes out to the front room. The front door of the bakery slams, then Draco hears the sharply-spoken incantation of a Locking Charm.
The alarm in Greg’s voice causes everyone to turn toward him immediately. He raises his arm to point in the direction they came.
“Too hot in the sun,” Draco says, rolling his eyes at Harry, who responds by sticking out his tongue. “Not all of us have been sitting in a tent for the past two hours.”
Astoria digs into her beach bag for her wand. She casts a sun protection charm over herself, then stretches out on the blanket, laying her hat beside her.
“But it would be pointless to wish for that,” Draco continues, “because you can’t have happiness by wishing for it. It’s not a thing that can be conjured out of thin air, is it?”
“Close them,” Malfoy orders, looking up as far as he can to make sure Harry’s doing it. “And just… do what I tell you to without opening them. Keep holding me with this arm for a minute.”
Later that week, Draco finds the letter from Andromeda that Harry left scattered on his coffee table. When Harry arrives from the kitchen with two mugs of tea, he’s looking at the snaps of Teddy that she tucked into the envelope.
Draco raises his eyebrows at her astuteness. He hadn’t thought to wonder what brought the Aurors storming into Knockturn in the first place. Harry might know, though he may not have connected the dots, so to speak. It’s reassuring to hear that this crackdown won’t last forever.
Harry took the stairs two at a time and rapped on Draco’s door, almost bouncing on the balls of his feet in anticipation. Draco opened the door, then froze at the sight of Harry. His eyes had drifted down to Harry’s T-shirt.
“Let me take you out for dinner, then. Please? It’s the least I can do, since you fed me two weeks in a row. Do you like Italian food? There’s a restaurant a couple blocks away that’s nice.”
Harry’s proud that he’s keeping up with the rest of the group better than he did on their first hike. Spending every Saturday outside instead of on his sofa has given him more energy than he’s had since he left Auror training. It’s a cloudy day, pleasantly warm but not too hot for a long walk. The high moors are vast and wild, but there’s something distracting Harry from the scenery.
He looks down at the half-empty bowl with a jolt. The shepherd’s pie is good. More than good, if Harry’s honest. There’s just the slightest hint of nutmeg in the lamb, and the potatoes are thick and buttery.
He sets the glass on the floor and leans out over the windowsill. The sky is bright, but hazy, promising a warm day. The summer sun will make his room stifling in a few more weeks, but for now it’s still comfortable. Draco can enjoy his evenings at home rather than wandering about in Muggle London until it’s cool enough to sleep. A smile tugs at his lips. He doesn’t often spend the evenings alone anymore.
An unexpected surge of pride warms the inside of Harry’s chest. He catches Malfoy watching him with raised eyebrows and returns the look confidently. Now that he seems to have won the approval—albeit muted—of two out of three Slytherins, he doesn’t feel quite so on the back foot. Harry works his way to the bottom of his bowl of soup, believing that he’s ready for anything they can throw his way.
Harry knows better than to do that, but he’s secretly pleased that Draco’s concerned about him. He pretends to give in reluctantly, just so he can see Draco’s face relax into relief. He’s rewarded with a gentle cuff on the shoulder as they walk outside to Apparate back to Loch nam Madadh. Harry thinks he manages to hide the thrill that runs down his spine at the touch.
Draco frowns at Harry. “I don’t want to go unannounced, that’s all. It’s not widely known that we work together, and it would undoubtedly seem strange to her if I were to come along without an explanation.”
“Did you use Sticking Charms for the house, hmm? Did you just slap slates onto the roof with a few waggles of your fingers? Is the loft held up with Levitating Charms?”
Harry’s not reassured. “I’d like to go through myself, if you don’t mind, just to be sure. Some curses are tuned to exclude family members, so there’s a possibility that Draco or I could trip something that you didn’t.”
It seemed like he was gone forever, but it couldn’t have been more than an hour. By the time he returned, I was beginning to feel truly miserable.
On his twenty-second birthday, Harry woke up on his sofa and rushed to the Floo to call Hermione before she left for work. He was flooded with relief when he heard footsteps approaching the fireplace. Ron’s face appeared in the flames—and immediately twisted into anger when he saw Harry.
Harry feels his hackles rise. Malfoy may have been a bit rude to Cal when he moved in, but having spent some time with him these past few weeks, Harry doubts that Malfoy did anything terrible enough to be so condemned.
“What way? Like you were offering some kind of business arrangement?” I asked. I walked past him towards the kitchen to get a glass of water; lying in the sun had left me parched.
He can’t keep hiding here in Luna’s front garden, that’s for certain. He’s already been here for at least ten minutes. There’ll be time to sort himself out later, when he’s alone and sober in the privacy of his own home.
“I think Erwina would be satisfied. Other than the dagger, her collection is intact and finally safe. I hope Ernie keeps the unicorn,” Harry adds with a laugh.
“Of course I did. The mark matches exactly, in appearance and location, and the charm confirmed that it’s authentic,” Healer Pearson says sternly. “And I’m going to tell you both, right now, that anyone who harasses or intimidates Mr—”
Draco shakes his head, unconvinced but too wise to contradict his boss aloud. He returns to the post with feigned urgency, hoping to end this dispiriting conversation. Luckily, the bell on the shop door jingles and Wharton leaves to attend the customer.
“I’d like to, but I don’t know if my luck would be any better now than it was last autumn. I saw some signs for a school in York that has art classes—painting, drawing, those sorts of things. I think I’d enjoy that. I don’t know anything about Muggle education, but maybe there are some lectures I could attend, too, to keep me busy. I’ve always liked learning new things.”
, Harry does think so, now that Malfoy’s drawn his attention to it. The bloke on the cover has the same pale colouring as him, with a lithe physique beneath the torn robes sliding off his shoulders. And he seems all too happy to surrender himself to the dashing pirate-wizard who’s lowering him down onto the beach of a desert island. In fact, the blond character is wearing a haughty expression that wouldn’t look at all out of place on Malfoy’s face.
“You know, when I first learnt about soulmates, I wasn’t happy about it at all,” Harry says when they reach a quieter block. “I had very little control of my life when I was a teenager and I hated the idea of yet another choice being taken away from me.”
“I don’t know! It’s not like I keep track.” When Ginny looks at him sternly—something Harry’s certain she unconsciously picked up from Molly—he throws up his hands in frustration. “All right, it was last autumn. That bloke from Denmark that was consulting for the DMLE. Hermione set us up.”
“I saw the front door being boarded up as I was walking by. What in Merlin’s name was going on in a tattoo shop, of all places? Was it a front for something else?” Draco asks.
Draco stands and slips his arms into the sleeves of his jacket. He steps closer to Potter and holds out his hand.
“Don’t look so worried, Potter. I’m not going to jump you,” Malfoy snickers. “I just thought we could have a drink to celebrate my birthday.”
“Two minutes,” Harry says, happy to change the subject before Draco can ask him about Ernie again. He reaches for the jacket draped over the back of a chair. It’s not the warmest one he owns, but he doesn’t expect to spend much time outside while he’s in Scotland, and he packed a couple of jumpers to wear as well.
“I know it isn’t and that’s why I’m tutoring. Naia is a brilliant child—she just about devours any material I give her—and it makes me ill to think that she’ll never have the opportunities that more fortunate children have. She reminds me of Granger, if I’m honest.”
There was no Ministry seal on the outside of the letter, nor did Draco see the red band of the Ministry’s official post owls on its leg. This must be a private letter from the Minister.
“God, anything, Draco,” Harry says. He closes his eyes with a soft intake of breath as Draco runs his fingertips down his chest and over the tense muscles of his stomach. “Can you touch me?”
It was evening when I woke fully, still exhausted but clear-headed enough to register the sounds of Zoë moving nearby and the taste of the potions clinging to my tongue. Potter helped me drink some water and asked me how I felt.
“Draco sent me an owl,” Harry said, knowing it was best to get to the point quickly when he was dragging Hermione away from her studying.
“Yours?” she asks. When Draco nods, she pulls him into a tight hug. “Go, Draco. Use our Floo in the storeroom. I’ll tell Naia.”
“I might just keep you,” Harry says, changing his tone from playful to serious, “now that you found your way here. I know when I’ve found something special. Something rare.”
“I would really like to be with Teddy during lockdown,” Harry says quietly, after she leaves the room.
Harry sets the small mantel clock on his workbench with a satisfied sigh and tilts his head from side to side to stretch the tension out of his neck. It was a tricky Furnunculous Curse, hidden underneath multiple Concealment Charms. Not for the first time, he wonders what the hell inspires people to curse anything, much less something as mundane as a clock. Sometimes while he’s working, he likes to invent lurid tales of bitter feuds between family members over a prized object, cursed gifts sent by jealous rivals, or discontented servants seeking revenge.
“If you don’t mind my asking, Draco, is everything okay? With him?” Susannah asks gently, settling back on her stool behind the counter. “Getting to know one’s soulmate is a joyous time, but I’ve noticed that you haven’t seemed as happy lately.”
“Mmm, better,” Harry murmurs, when they’re face to face, lying on their sides. He feels the heat of the Firewhisky radiating out from his stomach, through his limbs. Malfoy’s face is swimming in front of him, so Harry reaches up to press a finger to the corner of Malfoy’s mouth to help him find his target.
The Minister, to his credit, was eager to hear more about Harry’s impressions of Knockturn Alley, as well as his opinion about the recent Auror operations there. Draco listens with more than a little awe as Harry summarises his conversation. It doesn’t sound like he was anything less than brutally frank with the most powerful politician in magical Britain. It took nerve, even if Shacklebolt is an old friend. Freed from the constraints of his job, Harry must have decided he had nothing to lose.
had a field day over Lucius’ conviction and the seizure of Malfoy Manor as a crime scene. The smug articles couldn’t have made it easier for Draco or his mother. Harry eagerly turns the conversation elsewhere.
He slips off the window seat and skirts around the edge of the room to the stairs. The sounds of the party fade as he climbs the spiraling steps, and Draco unexpectedly finds the silence oppressive. For a moment, he’s tempted to go back and hover out of sight near the bottom of the stairs, just so he can hear the countdown to the end of this
Despite losing everything after the war, I had soldiered on, fueled by a few small embers of youthful optimism. I’d believed that it was possible to make amends for the things I had done; I’d thought that I could claw my way back into respectability. At eighteen, the path immediately before me had looked bleak, but surely it would grow easier in time, wouldn’t it?
He doubts Malfoy would let him return the favour by sharing Chinese food or curry in Harry’s flat. But there may be something else he can offer Malfoy instead of a meal.
“I don’t suppose you have any Pepper-Up?” I asked, trying to find a comfortable position in the armchair. My back and neck were beginning to ache and my head throbbed.
“What, by pretending to talk to my snake and then inventing reasons why she was refusing to eat? How could that possibly be construed as
“I just wanted to explain why…” Potter pauses to step closer, only an arm’s length away from Draco, then takes a deep breath. “I would wish to be happy, too, if I could. But I think it means something different for me and I wanted to explain.”
As Harry’s trying desperately to convince himself that this isn’t any worse than the crush he’s already harbouring, Draco opens the door behind him.
“Mmm,” Andromeda hums in agreement. “So your job at the potions supply shop is going well, Harry tells me. And you plan to stay there?”
When the fire is ready, Harry levitates a pan above the glowing logs and fries the sausages. The smell makes his mouth water. Greg is drawn back to the fire and chats with Harry about the Quidditch League standings while he cooks. Luna and Pansy take charge of setting out the rest of the food, occasionally calling questions to Harry across the grass.
Harry stands and nudges Draco towards the kitchen with a hand on the small of his back. “I have more. Don’t worry about it. Come on.”
“It’s all right, Harry. I didn’t expect anyone to warm to the idea of my being your soulmate right away. There’s a lot” —Draco’s voice breaks slightly— “a lot of things in my past that can’t be overlooked or forgotten.
“How can it already be full?” Harry cries, gesturing towards the piles covering half of Malfoy’s bed.
Harry felt like he was already halfway out of the scene, like an actor stepping off stage through a gap in the curtains.
In fact, no one else is here. Harry and Malfoy are the only eighth years staying at Hogwarts for the Christmas holidays. Other than the pop and crackle of the fire beside them, the room is eerily quiet. Harry’s glad to engage in a bit of banter with Malfoy after three nearly-wordless chess games.
Just as Harry is beginning to think about the cosy common room and a hot cuppa, a dark tentacle shoots from the dark water directly in front of them, lashing at the air. Malfoy shouts and hauls the handle of his broom to his chest to fly upward. Before Harry can do the same, two more tentacles emerge, curling towards him.
He realised that Draco was watching him expectantly and he couldn’t put off the reason for his visit much longer.
While Draco hangs up his coat, Harry takes the bread to the kitchen and is absent for a couple of minutes. Instead of returning with the pot of tea that Draco assumed he was making, he comes back to the sitting room empty-handed. He sits beside Draco on the sofa, angling towards him so that their knees brush together. Draco readies himself for something more serious than their usual after-work chat.
As if Harry felt the need to make sure Draco understood that they weren’t going to pick out china patterns or—
I knew he wasn’t trying to take advantage of me or coerce me into repaying him for his kindness—Potter simply didn’t have it in him to do that to anyone, even me. Yet the offer still burned like a Stinging Hex. As I lay in the prickling grass, the reason why began to present itself in my mind, like a new leaf unfurling.
After shaking the Healer’s hand, Draco summons the courage to acknowledge Harry’s friends. Mrs Weasley looks away, but Granger nods. Draco reads sympathy in her expression, which surprises him. He hopes it’s because she empathises with having one’s soulmate cursed—Weasley is an Auror, too, Draco knows—and not because she expects that Harry will reject him shortly.
“I do appreciate it, truly, and I think it’s a good plan. I think the families here will be receptive to the idea, especially if they can be involved in establishing the school. Will you tell them that?”
“Who knows?” Luna says, strolling over to join the conversation. “Ley lines shift, clan borders change. It’s been thousands of years and the people who used the stones didn’t leave written records. We can still use our imaginations to envision what it must have looked like when they were standing. I’m sure they were magnificent.”
Every couple of minutes, a few travellers emerge from the doorway to be greeted by friends and family before exiting towards Diagon. After the third or fourth time this happens, Harry begins to feel anxious. What if Draco missed the Portkey? What if he changed his mind about coming back to England?
He hears Malfoy set his teacup on the windowsill, then feels tentative fingertips brush his forearm.
“Yeah. Is two o’clock good for you? The museum should be a little emptier at that time of day, after all the school groups leave.”
I heard the peevishness in my voice, but Potter pulled his hand out of mine before I could speak again, and more patiently this time.
Harry slid the diced cucumbers and cherry tomatoes into the wooden salad bowl. His face felt as hot as Ron’s sauce. It was very unfair that having a pash on someone at the age of 22 was as humiliating as when he was 14.
When everything’s planted and watered, Greg takes charge of putting things away and Harry goes up to the house to give his hands and face a proper cleaning with soap and water. There’s no sign of Xeno today, but Luna mentioned that it’s not unusual for him to go to
“It’s not so bad once you get used to it,” he said. When he got close enough, he splashed me. “See? Feels nice! You should come in.”
“Healer Malfoy, you’re required in room two,” usually that was where the talking stopped, but the witch apparently wasn’t ready yet. “It’s Mr Potter.”
“Yet another Unspeakable deigning to have lunch with the rest of us here,” Draco said, trying for humorous, no real sting to his words. The sting with regard to Hermione Granger had left him a long time ago anyway.
“Why didn’t you just use my Floo?” Harry felt extremely angry and judging by the way his voice sounded that was unquestionably clear.
That was when Potter decided to touch him, his hand squeezing Draco’s upper arm and then just staying there. Draco could feel the warmth travelling through his whole body. “But you
They both knew why Malfoy had added that last sentence and Harry pondered the uncomfortable silence that followed, eventually asking: “Why didn’t you just ask me? Whether you could be here in time to tutor her?”
While Draco had been thinking, he’d apparently been walking too, because now he found himself outside of the castle. It was the evening to a sweltering day and the heat still lingered, making him roll up the sleeves of his shirt and robes, not ready to shed them yet. He strolled to the lakeside, to the spot where for months he’d met Harry to practice his Patronus - and some Patronus it had turned out to be – and where he hoped to see Harry again today.
That was when he looked up and saw Malfoy. “Get your arse up here,” he mouthed, apparently losing his focus enough for the mixed drink to fall out of the air. It didn’t fall far, though, because Malfoy whipped out his wand and caught it with a neat spell while walking to the bar, all elegance, ease and confidence. Harry found he had a hard time looking away.
“Yeah, because he-. He doesn’t answer my owls, or his front door, or anything. It’s like he’s disappeared from the face of the earth completely. He didn’t even come into work this week,” Harry rambled.
Nott was older now than when Harry had known him at Hogwarts, of course, but he still had the same weedy build and rather inconspicuous features.
And Harry still didn’t have a clue. So he tried to find support with Hermione, who was sitting next to Blaise. “Oh, of course,” was infuriatingly the only thing she said, though - not specifically to Harry - like the answer had just popped into her head.
The green of his eyes was so overwhelmingly bright that Draco felt completely powerless to say ‘no’, so he didn’t say a thing.
“I’m coming,” Penelope told Mathew, then hesitated and Draco thought she might not trust him to be able to do this, but then she continued: “Draco, I know you could easily take down the rest of those wards by yourself, but I still think it’d be safer to wait until I return or until another Curse-Breaker gets assigned to this case. That’s standard protocol after all.”
Besides one-night stands were exactly that for a reason: they normally weren’t repeated, it was how they worked. Harry couldn’t say he was particularly happy with that in this case, though: it felt like they’d just gotten started, like there was a whole world to explore. A world he surprisingly found he would quite like to explore with Draco Malfoy of all people.
The kitchen Draco had eventually ordered was dark grey with beautiful brushed oak details and all the appliances he could possibly need. Besides they had found the perfect dinner table: brushed oak again with rather elegant chairs to match. They’d arranged to have the furniture arrive later that week and the kitchen would be installed in about a month.
That was the moment Draco chose to wake up this morning, however, and as soon as he’d opened his eyes, looking around slightly bewildered at first, he extricated his legs from Harry’s and sat up. “I-, I didn’t realise it was this late already. I should leave.” He sounded largely in control, but didn’t quite look it yet: still completely naked, his hair a mess.
They drew him in, coming even closer and Draco didn’t register who made the first move, but all of a sudden their lips brushed. It was tentative, searching, but the touch of their lips made something both hot and light ripple its way all through Draco’s body. And suddenly all he could think was ‘more’.
It was about an hour after Harry had also dozed off that the sound of Draco’s phone woke him up. There was a text message from Hermione stating that she and Ron had reached the hotel where they would be staying the night.
“Nothing. I made a mistake,” he eventually managed to answer, his voice still sounding quite collected. He really needed to get away.
“Really?” Terry looked at Harry as if he had just suggested for them both to have a baby together. “Harry, you know what he is.
Draco made it out of the breakroom in a few long strides. So the spell Harry’d been hit with didn’t seem too bad, but if it had been modified it could still be quite harmful, could have all sorts of side effects.
There was nothing tender to the kiss that followed. It was hard and urgent and needy, all pent-up wanting apparently finding its way out.
It left Draco worried, because Hermione and Harry had obviously been friends for close to forever, which meant he really had no place being here. So – with no way of getting out of this one undetected - Draco sat back, completely resigned to being left out of the conversation altogether.
After which he made short work of cutting the tomatoes in annoyingly thin slices by casting just one well-performed spell.
Work hadn’t been so bad today: Terry had called in sick – Harry didn’t want to think too hard about why that could be – and Harry had been paired with Lisa Turpin, who had been called in to replace Terry for a few days.
Potter was talking to Ginny Weasley and, although Draco knew they had divorced about two years ago, seeing them together still caused something very unwelcome to stir inside Draco.
“Well, if you’re interested, I might know just the place,” Blaise now chipped in. “It’s a gay club that I’ve been to a few times,” Harry was about to say something, but Blaise effectively cut him short, “No, Potter, I’m not gay, but I’ve been to this club with some friends.” That actually shut Harry right up. “And it’s Muggle, so you could, you know, try things without your head being plastered all over
It didn’t take him long to find the man. Vulnerable without his wand he was running through the fields surrounding the house.
