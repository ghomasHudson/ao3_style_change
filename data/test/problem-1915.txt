Harry moved closer, “Scared, Draco?” And he sucked at that spot on his neck, right over his pulse point.
He laughed soundlessly, shaking.
The grenadine grew sickly sweet in his mouth. He ordered a shot of Jameson and loved the burn, like punishment, like cauterization, like a flaming brand of his sins and the way to forget them.
He laughed, bitter, “I know what parts of you want,” and he reached forward as if to run his hand along Potter’s length, stopping less than two centimetres away, “I’m not so sure about the rest of you.”
“But Draco, darling - maybe you can - oh, I don’t believe I’m saying this - but maybe you can be happy, with him. Really, truly happy.”
He wondered if he cared.
“Do you - ah - think we should - Christ, alright, find the lube - get a cat?”
“Yes. Merlin knows why. Do you think this afternoon will go better if I start throwing things?”
He opened his mouth, licked delicately around the head, sucked, just a little, and pulled off.
He frowned, “Yeah?”
“Harry -”
He laughed, then bent over and kissed that spot under Draco’s ear.
“Well,” she stood up, “I’m going to bed. You alright on the couch?”
“Are you going to let me up?”
So he spent a lot of time tearing down flocked wallpaper, and sanding down floors, and repainting windows at Grimmauld Place. And he Leviosa’d stones and Reparo’d stained glass at Hogwarts. He babysat Teddy and hoped he could - hoped that he might matter.
“You know,” Ron pondered in his slow, deliberate way, "There are different kinds of meant to be, I think.”
They laughed, so alike in the way they sounded, the way they looked. Red hair and freckles and too much fun like the bubbles in champagne.
He laughed like choking.
“Just like always.”
He cleared his throat - Scorpius blinked up at him, and Al just glanced over as if he’d known Harry was there all along.
“Potter,” Draco held out his hand for a paper cup.
“Er, well, I’m on a gap year, I guess.”
She was just worried about him. It was still - the war was still so close.
Years of wearing either Dudley’s hand me downs or flowing school robes had made him… unaccustomed to clothes which fit properly. And maybe it was just him, but it seemed a bit unnecessary that his jeans hug his bum (and such) with this level of, er, snugness.
Ha, Draco thought. Not as tough as you pretend.
A double measure, when Harry was married, and another when he saw James’s birth announcement in the prophet.
“I have no doubt,” and he smiled at her, hopelessly transparent in his affection, “But you saw it, Harry, before we did, that we were meant to - to end up here.
“You needn’t act so shocked. Our lives would have been - well, quite different, had I made different choices.”
“Didn’t take you for a prude, Malfoy,” she teased.
Draco gave him a little pat on the back, just shy of too rough.
Harry leaned over and kissed her smooth forehead, and pulled the covers up to her chin.
Draco laughed.
Draco was sat at the desk in his suite of rooms - where he usually went through all personal post before beginning his day. He took these extra moments to lounge around in his favorite French terry dressing gown, the smell of verbena and juniper bubbles flowing in from the en suite bath, a cup of espresso steaming within reach.
She giggled a bit more, but then her face turned serious, and she looked down.
But having kids wasn’t enough. Not to save a marriage that, perhaps, never should have happened in the first place.
“See, he’s getting it now,” Ron mock-whispered.
Harry opened his mouth, and then -
Fred.
It was an easy decision, and he finally got to see, got to feel -
He gestured up at the impressive building.
“So what’d you think?” Draco’s voice was calm, almost bored, as he rolled off and stared at the ceiling, still panting, “Is the great Harry Potter a bottom after all?”
And that was just the way it was.
“God, I could do this forever.”
That was just the way it was.
When he kissed him, they clicked right into place - Draco’s smirking lips tilting, covering his, and it was like dancing, and chasing the snitch, and laughing in lamplight, and drinking hot cinnamon liqueur; it was bath oil and champagne; it was being so terribly young, and growing so beautifully old.
“So tell me about yourself, Harry.”
Malfoy brushed past him, towards the wall between the muggle world and the wizarding, and Harry watched his back, not for the first time, and he almost tore the robes between his shaking hands.
She laughed.
There were a few moments of silence.
Al snorted again, louder, “Also true.”
And glasses.
He had to go.
“What?”
“Come on.”
“What is it with you Gryffindors? Bumbling along into danger -”
He crossed his arms over his scarred chest, holding himself back. Hiding his scars, his mark. Harry clenched his fists, teeth nearly cracking as he ground them with the pressure of his tight jaw.
“I have no intention of hurting him again. Ever again.”
Fuck you, Potter. He dunked his head under the water, and if there were any tears they washed away, down into the drain.
“I’d give it a go,” and he threw in another wink. He really was relentless.
He felt sweat gather, prickling all over his body. He couldn’t bring himself to answer; he mumbled, staring at the floor.
Harry, fuck, and the sounds he made in the alley and
And now he had his own home, and life was moving forward, and he imagined Molly and Arthur in this space, the first people who fed him, still the first adults who cared. The grandparents of his children. His family.
Back home, he sent off an owl to Parkinson - Zabini - and he packed a case. Lily insisted on supervising, which resulted in her rejecting almost every article of clothing as, “just too uncool, Dad,” and he resigned himself to spending a few hours updating his entire wardrobe.
“Given the state of this room,” she walked further in, lifting her robes to avoid shards of pottery, “I think you need it, even if you don’t want it.”
When you rock and roll with me"
“Alright, alright. I just thought…”
They dodged through city traffic and pulled up in front of a cozy looking pub. Aengus flipped his light off.
“Fine. Know that you have the option.”
“Not now, you lunatic. But - in a year. A year and one day. When you’ve... stayed with me. Ask me then.”
“Ask me again.”
Draco relaxed back, that secret smile pulling at his lips, and slanted his eyes over, “But did you know about Luna?”
If he let his vision relax - if he let himself see details like abstract snatches of bad dreams, he could almost pretend that the dark hair under his fingers was blacker, messier, softer. He pulled on Thom’s scalp when he got too close.
“Even though a bunch of stuff is here, now.”
“Mum,” he slumped, covered his eyes, tried not to cry, “I just need to be angry, alright?”
Harry was always watching Draco walk away.
“Makes sense.”
Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head, breath heavy, and he clawed at Harry’s arms, almost drawing blood - his whole body tensed up, and Harry pulled out and wrapped his hand around both of them and fuck, he’d never get over the feeling of coming with Harry at the same time.
Ron offered his hand for Harry to shake, then pulled him into a hug, pounding his back.
“Shit, sorry.”
Harry had to reach him, had to stop him this time, and he grabbed his arm -
She gave him a long, considering look, and then left. Even though he’d sent her away, he felt that old pain - no one ever fucking stayed.
“Oh yes?” Draco gasped as Harry rocked up against him, laughing.
“You still owe me, though.”
"Un jour ou l'autre on sera tous papa
Draco sipped at his coffee, then stirred in a little cream. Less, now, than he used to add.
Draco rolled his eyes, put upon, “If I must.”
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets.
Draco chuckled low and dirty, “Well, you are a fucking natural.”
He kept waiting for Ron to hate him.
His voice was calm, but cold.
Harry felt his face grow hot. Draco smirked.
And Astoria, so much stronger than he was, sat him down and said, firmly, lovingly, “It’s time.”
“Merlin, you just had to be hung, didn’t you,” he muttered entirely to himself, “How the fuck are you fitting in those jeans?”
Draco’s eyes were so soft, the grey as misty and ephemeral as Irish rain.
Scorpius nodded.
“Your turn to beg, Potter.”
“Honestly, what good would it have done?”
Harry’s voice was almost too quiet to hear over the pulsing music of the club.
He handed over the bottle of whiskey.
“Ha!” Harry was startled into a sudden laugh, “What?”
“Are you trying to be nice?”
“I should have known, as your mother. We never spoke of our,” she cleared her throat, “Our inner workings. I trusted that, as the head of the family, you could choose the right path. And I did not question, out of my own cowardice, I suppose, why you came back.”
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
Harry reached behind him, kept Draco buried deep, cried, came, and whispered back, flat, “Love you too, you tosser.”
“Really?”
Six in the morning, and the sun was on its way to rising. Draco’s head was still a bit thick from last night - a group of American girls had bought him a couple of shots of Jameson before they figured out that he would definitely not be going home with any of them.
Fuck fuck fuck, how he wanted. And it looked like Potter wanted, too. It was too much, and he had to have it.
They both looked up to the veiled portrait, as if it could blow open and unleash…
Oh. Most of the people on the dance floor were men.
The sound of feathers rustling, the lingering smell of hash.
He really hoped, in that moment, that Malfoy was not standing at the window and watching his childhood nemesis running hell for leather away from - apparently quite angry - ornamental birds.
Draco leaned in, just those last few inches, and breathed hotly against Harry’s jeans.
Harry looked at his chest. Really looked.
“Everything alright, sure, now he asks...” he kept mumbling as he came back into the room and put his hands on his hips, “Well.”
“So,” lick, “Not,” nibble, “Brothers.”
“God, I love you, Pans. Tell me again why I didn’t marry you?”
That was when they started drinking tequila.
Oh, well, it would keep him awake through his shift in the morning.
Playlist track: "Like a River Runs" by Bleachers and Sia.
“Hmm,” Draco turned his eyes away, but left his leg where it was, “This coffee is shit, Potter.”
"Give me peace of mind at last
For me"
A growl at the back of her throat, “Harry Potter. He is the stupidest person I have ever met. He is an utter disgrace to any sense of style, gentility, or culture. Sometimes I think I hate him more than I hated my bloody useless Death Eater father.”
“I mean, ‘Mione and me, we didn’t exactly get on right away.”
“Feel free to get it yourself,” he frowned, looking down into his cup, “What’s wrong with it?”
He growled low in his throat, closing his eyes against - against Potter, and his heat, and everything he’d ever wanted. And then he felt strong hands on his hips, and Potter pulled him tight against that unbelievably hard cock.
He picked up his glass again, slumping back into the tufted leather of his chair.
And he paused.
Draco was suddenly all business, as if this were a lunch with clients, and not drinking cold coffee with the walking human disaster he used to fuck in dark alleys.
How could he tell her that this was - that he itched to get as far away from all of them as possible? He loved them all, but... She wanted to keep everyone right around her, to keep them safe.
He wanted to sweat it all out, all the alcohol and all the pain, and then he wanted to drink it up again and vomit it up at sunrise.
With you in my arms."
“Could you take me to a train station?”
Or too long. Either one, really.
Of course.
He turned to walk away again, then shouted back over his shoulder.
“You have a tell. You know, when you’re lying.”
“Probably because I am such an unremitting cunt.”
"You only know what I want you to
“Maybe you want to see it better, hmm? Where to aim.”
He had no idea. He felt in his pocket for muggle money and yes, of course, Hermione had snuck in a piece of notebook paper with a list of murals.
She studied the chaos in the room, all the fractured heirlooms now worthless.
“I love you too, you abject disaster. Now shut up and grab me some champagne.”
“We gave those years to them, I think. For them.”
“Glad you came, mate.”
“Look, it doesn’t matter -”
And now he had.
He couldn’t stay here.
“Draco, I -” he wove his fingers through Draco’s golden hair, shaking.
“And it’s your father that tears up and smiles like a lunatic when he catches us kissing.”
A pause - Longbottom was really good at this authority thing, letting the silence stretch ominously.
And, as much as he hid from it, raged against it silently, locked it up in a dark cupboard with the spiders and the broken toy figures and mouldy crumbs - he knew exactly when wanting him shamed and bloody and broken revealed itself as wanting to hold him and never let go.
Back in the kitchen, he slid into one of the hard-backed chairs worn into a golden sheen by use. So many dinners at this table.
How he’d dreamt of lazy mornings, drinking the dregs of canned cider, burying his face in the soft hair along Draco’s neck, kissing him between cigarettes. Planning a life, a little bit.
Such a simple thing by which to save the world.
“Draco --
After, Harry was solicitous, kissing over his stomach, smoothing his tongue against his roughened entrance, wiping him clean.
“I guess you did fuck me on the bench.”
Greg met a French-speaking muggle woman in his cookery classes. He wrote to tell Draco, stunned, that he thought he loved her.
And now, at 37, he was still very much alive - his blood pumped through him, and his brain was sparking in manic fury and discontent, and his skin felt like ice. He had a job, a respectable one, and he had a smooth face which no one could read. He had an ex-wife and a child an aging mother. He was mostly sober. He played music at an acceptable volume.
“I’m always right,” Scorp raised his eyebrows at Al in the mirror.
He said it in such a disinterested tone, as if it could not have mattered less. But Harry knew him - knew the tells, the tiny movements, and Draco had always lied in the same way - with a twitch at the corner of his right eye.
“Go on, Scorp,” this from Longbottom, who sounded altogether too forgiving.
My hands shaking with regret
He looked very uncertain as to his welcome - which he should have - and placed the biscuit tray on the range.
Which, well, he wasn’t. But Narcissa was.
“Oh,” Al looked down down again, frowning, “Right.”
“Harry…”
“Harry…”
“You handled that well, Malfoy,” she plopped herself down in the chair across from him, “Thanks. I didn’t want to come out, given…” She gestured at her lack of appropriate attire.
“Fuck, this is good,” he relaxed back onto silken skin, made slippery with bath oil.
“Mean what, Potter?”
“So you - you’re trying to tell me -” he could barely put the words together. How -
He felt a tear gather in the corner of his eye. As it fell, she brushed it away with the tissue-paper tenderness of her lined fingers.
He felt a laugh bubbling up, watching Harry look around like a first year at Hogwarts and Pansy glaring at him like she was five seconds from throttling him and hiding the evidence.
“Ah,” Draco held out his hand, waving it a bit, and Harry handed over the coffee before realising what he was doing, “Al. Yeah. What’d he do?”
“Green, huh?”
“No?”
Ron and Hermione had, of course, showed up to see him off. Hermione had prepared his suitcase with an extension charm, and Ron had given him some dubious advice about picking up American women (“One hint of your accent and they’ll be lining up, you’ll see”) despite never, in fact, having met one. Ginny had talked about coming to wave him off, too, but she’d been asked to try out for the Harpies, and anyway…
“Now be a love,” his voice caught, “And bring me my fucking champagne.”
Harry lifted and settled Draco on top of him, sliding his legs open and grasping him with the strong muscles of his thighs.
It wasn’t great money but for now it was enough. And Colin had just started him on other tasks - he had some ideas about events and publicity - and most of all he felt useful, which was an entirely new sensation.
“Taking my time.”
Her voice was business-like, detached, “Are you going to owl him?”
“Thank you for the gift of my life,” he tongued at the slit, held the base of Harry’s cock in a firm grip, and winked, “Now pull my hair and fuck my face, will you?”
Harry nuzzled his face into Draco’s hand, nodding and closing his eyes, and he slid his pants to the floor. He licked Draco, root to tip, and Draco groaned, pushing his prick into Harry’s watering mouth.
They looked so little. So very serious.
And then Potter stopped, stood still, and those dark eyes flashed, once, and then shied away.
He lit the next cigarette with the burning butt of the last.
He could actually sound quite stern. He did kill that horrible snake, after all.
And there he was, in another tight t-shirt - green this time, Jesus fuck, like every dark fantasy he’d ever had staring up at the curtains of his Hogwarts bed - and a pair of dark wash jeans that did absolutely nothing to hide -
He knew, somehow. But he wanted Harry to say it, wanted him to confess.
Draco’s hands shook, just a little, as they broke the seal.
He was broken.
It all went too fast and not fast enough. Thom used a lot of lube, and he slipped in and out of Draco’s body, and he kept trying to cradle Draco’s face in some misplaced nod to tenderness. Draco shoved his hand in the direction of his cock, and he gripped it softly.
Lunch was extraordinarily uneventful.
“Alright.”
His voice was chilly, but his chest and face turned a splotchy pink.
“Yes, well,” he took another swallow, “We all have our vices, don’t we?”
He dropped to his knees. Music pumped, rhythmic and toneless, and the graffiti glittered on the walls, and he rubbed his face against the twitching mass of Harry’s prick.
Not for us to know about our own.
He walked over, dripping, and when he stood next to Draco, Draco ran his hand over the cut, muttered something in Latin, and he was healed.
Draco raised his left eyebrow and looked down - the barista was maybe three inches shorter - and said, very quietly, “I’m you in about twenty years. A little advice,” he sat, picked up the espresso with his long, nimble fingers, “Don’t bite off more than you can chew. This one -” he nodded to Harry, “- is hard to swallow.”
“No, Potter. I doubt even you have the galleons,” he jerked his head up, “It’s upstairs.”
To live the life that I have made in song
“For letting me borrow him for a while.”
“Yeah,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, an old habit. He heard Draco’s breath catch, and saw him clench his jaw and look away.
And he needed a drink, he thought, suddenly, if he was going to get through this.
“And he is very clearly, in his idiotic, artless, Gryffindor way, madly in love with you.”
Something about that twisted in him like a basilisk in the pipes.
“Shut up, Draco.”
“And I - Draco, this was just supposed to be - I was always meant to go home.”
Harry ran.
He nearly dropped the glass, a bit of whiskey sloshing over the edge.
“No, you fucker, you’re going to come like this, right here, where anybody could see, and I’m not going to do anything but ride you and kiss your stupid mouth and tell you what a filthy bastard you are, how much you want it, how much you’re gagging for it -”
He looked over at Harry, who seemed uncomfortable, biting his lip.
He stuffed his mouth with another biscuit.
“Yes, love.”
He looked up into grey eyes just a few inches higher than his own.
Inside the pub, Harry noticed a shift, something different to the Leaky or the Three Broomsticks. It felt - there was a warmth, maybe. It was almost the way Hogwarts felt, as if magic were tingling along his skin - but these were just muggles, and this was just a muggle pub. But, he could hardly describe it, the place seemed… old. Like the earth was singing up to him.
Draco took on that pink tinge again.
It had taken him a while to get used to living without magic. Oh, he could still do it - his wand, so memorably returned, was tucked under the mattress - but he just… he didn’t see the point, really. He’d wanted to live a different sort of life. A muggle life.
It turned out that a holiday was the first thing - doubtless one amongst a long list of reparations that Harry would happily pay as long as he was asked - that Draco wanted.
His voice was detached, but there was something, some insecurity he couldn’t hide.
They sat quietly, the fire sparking, and it should have been uncomfortable, all the history between them, but it just felt so good - at least to Harry. Here, with Draco, in his new flat, the smell of coffee and smoke, and he was exactly where he wanted to be.
A dizzy flash of shame, remorse, and he crushed the cigarette, “That’s not what I meant, Draco.”
Draco leaned back, body relaxed now, but truly snakelike, with a promise of violence. He smiled a creamy smile.
“Oh, sure.”
He was technically correct, of course. Not that Draco would admit that.
His breath was soft on Harry’s ear, and then he bit the tender skin of his earlobe and sucked.
It had made sense, at the time. Maybe - maybe they were both too broken.
And I would be your slave"
“What really fucked you up was your muggle family. They taught you how to be afraid, all the time. How to hate yourself. And that hate is eating you up. You need to be the hero, need people to worship you, so that -”
And Harry made this little sound.
“What -”
“I do know. Praise the Goddess for giving him to us,” and then her voice was stern, commanding, “But now, now that you are no longer married, now that your son is in school - now I’ll speak freely, and tell you…”
He smirked at himself, walking along, thinking about those first moments when he could just be. Be Draco, not Malfoy, and gay as a fucking maypole. It was absolutely terrifying. He’d gone a bit mad with it.
“Er, well, it’s… very nice.”
Harry was in extreme danger of falling over.
“Jesus, why are you so rough…”
“Since you’ll be there,” she got a bit of a gleam in her eye - the one that always heralded ‘research,’ “You might as well see some of the murals. There are wizarding ones, you know.”
Al had been right.
“Let the line die with me. Here lies Draco Lucius Malfoy,” he gestured broadly, “Good fucking riddance.”
I can’t live without him.
Draco certainly knew how to make an entrance.
He turned his head, looked at Harry, mouth mocking but eyes soft.
But this - his idea to follow Malfoy yet again - was completely, definitely, and staggeringly terrible.
“You’re bleeding, Potter.”
“Why do you make me feel this way?”
Hermione adjusted the collar of his shirt - newly bought and actually his size.
“On and up?”
So he leaned forward and bit Potter’s hot neck, hard, and Potter groaned, some animalistic thing he’d never imagined but suddenly couldn’t live without, and Potter was unzipping his jeans, and he quickly unzipped Potter’s, and they were both bare in the damp-cool night, and Draco took them both in one hand -
“You should - you should owl him.”
“Do you know what I discovered when I was dragged to the headmaster’s office at 10:00 last night?” Draco smiled like a shark, all sharp angles and teeth. Like he was about to go for the jugular and enjoy the hell out of it.
Harry held out the customary glass of water.
He couldn’t help but remember that boy in the bathroom. Draco sat, hunched over himself with his elbows on his knees, those long legs folded up, and he held the still-burning butt of a cigarette. A bottle of Bushmills sat next to him, not quite half gone. And he looked the same, to him - all the years were meaningless, the laugh lines, the hair lightened by age - he was his Draco, the person he knew, down in his soul, he needed more than he needed air.
The door opened. Jamie wandered in, eyes on his - oh Merlin, who decided that the wizarding world needed its own versions of iPods, and why had he let George buy them for all the kids? He was banging his head, some third year amalgamation of Sirius and Charlie. He threw himself - upside-down, of course - on a chair, and kept rocking out.
“Yes, thanks.”

Adults should always step in. We deserve a better world, and we have an obligation to make that world for our children. And that's the way it is.
They were all so tired.
Many of the summer exchange students had already gone home - back to their boyfriends and girlfriends, their normal lives, where they’d give smiling kisses and lie a little and never really tell the truth about what they’d done. The city wasn’t empty, but there was a feeling of waiting. An idleness.
"My hand won't hold you down, no more
Muggles. They usually thought it was cool, and for a few moments he allowed himself to believe them.
He’d dropped Lily off with Molly and Arthur last night - her grandparents were always so pleased to take her, and despite recent events, Molly had gathered him up in a big hug. Maybe she saw on his face the deep discomfort that he felt, there in the house where they had always welcomed him - he didn’t understand how she could still, somehow, care for him.
“I don’t like boys, darlin’, but you just looked so sad.”
He looked down at Harry, and for just a moment the facade cracked, and Harry could see the long shadows of his worst mistake.
It was nice running into you (literally, I suppose) yesterday, though it wasn’t exactly something I’d planned out. I don’t know if you heard, but I’m -”
Like it was the first morning of the rest of their lives.
And then he saw him.
“No, I know it sounds mental, but Hermione’s right,” great, Ron, too, “It took longer for me to figure it out - right about the time of the trials, for me - but I thought…”
“I’ll pay you back. Whatever - however long - d’you want a holiday? Expensive gifts? Sexual slavery? The entire wardrobe? Or I can get you that cat -”
“Your wandless magic is really impressive.”
“Dad,
She trailed off, put a hand over his.
Draco had needed a few hours away from the club - he hoped that Chambers wouldn’t now remind him of looking up at Potter from the cold concrete of the toilet floors. So he came here, to Art’s, Wednesday night with the band and the kids who seemed so much younger than he felt. A palate cleanser, like parsley sorbet between rich courses of duck fat and cream.
(See the end of the chapter for
He took a moment, just three second with his eyes closed, to revel in the scent, and remember.
And if Draco went back to the manor, alone, and imagined all of his clothes lined up next to Harry’s - their books on the same open shelves - their toothbrushes aligned, his on the right, Harry’s on the left -
It looked cozy - though a bit nicer than he was used to - and he shrugged as if to say, what the hell. I’ve got the galleons. And it’s probably cheaper than playing blackjack in Las Vegas.
“God, I love that,” he reached down and wrapped his hand around the base of his cock, “I wanna be the first and the la-”
“It does seem that our children… get on.”
Draco longed for that, another dam breaking.
They stood like that, just a foot apart - neither of them had moved back - and Harry felt like he had lost the plot, and Malfoy smelled just the same, just the same, and he remembered the stone wall next to the River Lee. Cork at sunrise, and cigarettes laced with hash, and the most beautiful and most fucked up time in his entire life.
“Give him some space, ‘Mione. Our Harry knows what he’s doing.”
“I rather think I should be telling you to leave me alone. I don’t remember inviting you here.”
His head shot up, and she continued.
“I’m not angry at you, alright? I know that you - you and he -” she blew out a breath. His cheeks tingled where she touched them.
As the one down in mine"
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart
“Well, I’m trying to buy a flat…”
His voice came out ugly, “This wasn’t supposed to be forever, you know.”
Harry laughed, and he blushed, shaking his head.
“I’m not in the mood for company, Mother.”
“Well, that’s obvious.”
“Gin and I are getting a divorce.”
"When the world falls apart
He rolled off the couch in shock and hit the floor with his face. And, er, other things.
“Jesus, Draco, look at this place.”
“You are really weird, Potter.”
So, yeah, 37 years old, three children, an almost ex-wife, about to be homeless - because he didn’t want to keep imposing on Gin, who was already too good to him - and he could just give himself a smack because it wasn’t men he wanted, not men he threw over Ginny for. Not the cute barista, who practically screamed power bottom; not Justin at work, who’d tried it on once and kindly laughed off Harry’s rebuff; not any of the fantastically attractive Quidditch players he’d met through Gin. No.
“I’m off home, now, my Caer is like to toss me out if I don’t get there in time for my tea. Should I drop you at the airport?”
And he’d never been to Cork, after all.
“I know, I’ll be in Belfast for about two hours and a half, then I’ll get the next portkey on.”
“You sure you want that?”
Oh. Malfoy’s wand.
“Oh, right, and Albus Severus is such a winner -”
All of those dreams broken. And he had worked towards that end. At one time, he had wanted them dead.
It’s not as if they hadn’t spent any time together since he and Ginny had decided to divorce. Of course, Ron and Hermione had been told right away. And they were good to him, even though - even though they knew the reasons why. But he felt a tightness in his stomach, here in this warm place where he and Gin had shared meals so many times, and he hardly knew what to do with himself.
He turned away, and then just kind of... stopped.
He wanted to hurt Draco right back, slicing him open. Draco just laughed.
“I know, it’s too nice, I didn’t really need to -”
The cupboard. The mouldy ends of loaves of bread that his muggle family tossed in the bin, and that he fished out when they were all asleep. The way they didn’t hit him - not really, Harry said, just once in a while when he was really out line - so it couldn’t have been that bad, and why was he upset, now, when he’d never have to go back, when so many other people had it so much worse? He hadn’t starved, Harry insisted, he’d just - been hungry. And the cupboard was - the family blood, his mother’s blood, it did protect him, even if - And Dudley wasn’t a bad bloke, really, he’d even called him up when the war was over, and wasn’t it funny that he’d felt a little sick just hearing his voice?
Draco came with a cry.
He smelled something rotting. The scars on his chest almost burned.
“Ginny,” he shouted, then more quietly but still fucking angry, “It was from Ginny, alright?”
“Oh.”
“Hi,” his voice was soft, hoping they could start again - at least, start today again.
“‘Cause we got caught?” That from Scorpius, Slytherin through and through.
“I do, you know,” he started speaking to Harry’s zipper, but looked up and met his too-green eyes, “Owe you.”
“Right.”
Had he ever been that unbearably cute?
His hand sped up, and gods, this was better than thinking about -
“You said you loved me, you son of a bitch, and I fucking believed you,” he was all-white now, ghostly, “And I had never -” he shook his head, yelled,  “Fuck! You’re just like everybody else. A user.
“Astoria was a wonderful wife. She has been a good mother to Scorpius. She’s beautiful, entertaining, and my mother cares for her.”
The air started to vibrate, objects levitating without him even casting. It had been like this, the first time, with Harry gone - his magic boiled over, violent and destructive. A noiseless wind blew everything - art, objets, all his carefully maintained financial files - into a whirling tornado of pain made manifest.
Harry shot him a grin - Draco crinkled up his lips and sipped at his coffee.
“I didn’t -”
The flat was small - barely three rooms, just a living space with a tiny kitchenette, a bedroom with a crowded bathroom, the shower cubicle about the size of a postage stamp - and it was a bit dingey, with some crumbling plaster, the walls thin enough to let in the sound of someone playing music next door - and as soon as Harry stepped in, he started sniffling.
He looked at his hands.
Hermione wiped her lips, “Hmm?”
“For fuck’s sake,” the look on Malfoy’s face was almost, almost fond, but as usual entirely unimpressed, “Just apparate to Hogsmeade in an hour or so, walk up to the castle, deliver the robes, and enjoy the applause of your devoted fans.”
“Draco, I do.”
“Yes, well,” she took a big gulp of the whiskey then stuck her tongue out and coughed, “Nasty. Look. As much as I don’t want a permanent Potter accessory in our glorious Slytherin family,” he laughed, “When he looks at you… It’s all on his face, alright? Everything. So bloody uncouth.”
“I think not.”
She looked around at the mess again.
Where he was promptly set upon by peacocks.
He read it over, once more, and sealed it to be sent in the morning. As he lay in bed, the words echoed, over and over, so endless that he heard them in his sleep -
“Yeah,” he smirked down at him from his not quite two inch advantage, “I owe you one.”
Draco’s eyes widened.
Draco finally laughed, a real one, though understated.
“I’ll have to check my schedule.”
He heard Pansy take a deep breath.
The door slid open, and they walked through a lobby with marble floors, a large floral arrangement sitting on a cherrywood table, an elaborate but modern chandelier, two lifts.
Draco stared, running his eyes from the top of his head to his knees.
Harry, when pressed, would admit with a sheepish half-tilt of his lips that Albus Severus was his favorite child. Al was quiet, a dreamer, and he looked like his dad with the unexpected sarcasm to match, and Harry might have felt just a little bit guilty about the name (but it was too late, now).
“What am I going to do with you, Lil-bear?”
“Please what, Potter?”
Lily had needed no convincing to visit her brothers at Hogwarts.
Usually, that feeling edged out of his consciousness as he went through his routine. He was here, in Cork, working hard, partying harder, getting the bare minimum of sleep necessary, consuming ridiculous amounts of caffeine and nicotine. Life was rough and dirty and really quite good, as long as he had accepted that it was bad, deliciously. That the only person he was harming was himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
He grinded his teeth and considered telling her where, exactly, her so-called straight husband had on many memorable occasions put his mouth.
The shirt wasn’t much better. He could see, as he stared in the mirror, the muscles he’d put on while rebuilding Hogwarts. He wasn’t - it wasn’t obscene, or anything, but he was a lot more fit than he had been after so many years with the Dursleys, or after camping in the woods and eating whatever scraps they had left.
“And he’s also very easy to love,” it came out in a rush, “I understand -”
Harry sipped cold champagne, nose tickling from the bubbles, and he clenched.
“I know.”
He yawned, “What, Gin?”
Hermione crossed to the range and peered at him, trying to guess how many biscuits her husband had eaten, “And if you wake up with a sore stomach in the night, you’d better leave me out of that, too.”
“I don’t think you are. I think you liked doing this to me, Potter,” he spat his name, then smirked, “I think you want me on my knees for you.”

It did feel different now. Now that he knew which stones he’d had to lift, which windows he’d had to repair. He knew the building in such an intimate way, right down to its foundations, and he could still sense where all of that blood had gone, deep into rock, like a sacrifice to the innocence they hoped they’d get back.
Loving him in the little, quiet ways, in the ways that meant forever, that meant growing old, getting a cat, brewing the coffee, the things he hungered for and ran from and Draco, Draco, this man -
They moved against each other, trying not to draw attention, trying desperately not to laugh, and Harry came so hard that his vision blacked out around the edges.
“So what house did Al get?”
"The book of love is long and boring
They smoked for a while, silent.
“It’s your handiwork, after all.”
“Go on, Potter. You going to curse me? Hit me?”
“Shut up,” his face was tight, “Just -”
You can call it
The door opened behind him. Harry kept his eyes closed. He heard the door swing shut again, and then he heard it lock.
He could admit to himself that even now, making Harry uncomfortable was too fun to resist.
“Do you love him?”
“Might I assume that a similar issue is the cause for your impending divorce?”
Draco pulled his hip, tilting it with unerring precision, still knowing all the secrets spots, and Harry did take his hand off the window and held him, wrapped his arm back, fingers scraping the back of Draco’s scalp, and he came in such agony all over the window, and Draco cried, brokenly, “Harry.”
Cork was different, in some ways, and so similar in others. College kids still crowded into every pub, huddling on the pavement in the December chill, smoking and laughing and making spectacles of themselves, and when they drove past them in the back of a black cab, Draco looked out and grimaced, “Were we ever that young?”
He looked down at her hand, which she then took back, grimacing.
“You must be joking.”
The wander had done him good.
“Yeah, well, I have been waiting for -”
Ron was saving up galleons, working at the joke shop, to buy Hermione a ring, and Hermione knew about it, because of course she did, but she kept it to herself. Because she wanted to let him have the experience, Gin said, of asking for love and getting a resounding and unreserved yes.
He’d had enough of silence.
Frowning at her, he watched her face. She looked conflicted and not a little pissed off.
Show me all you are
In the morning - after three more rounds, and he’d had to tap out after the second, sore and stretched and dripping but fucking reborn - they checked out of the hotel with all of Harry’s belongings.
He stepped a little closer, put his hands on either side of Potter, leaning in without touching. The stone was cold and rough, but the heat coming off of Potter was scorching.
“But Dad - you did all sorts of dangerous things when you were at Hogwarts! And Mr. Potter -”
“Are you going somewhere?”
Harry watched him go.
He crossed the river, took a turn - entirely on some unknown instinct - and found himself in front of a large, Victorian building. The Metropole Hotel.
And a bold world
“Ow, you fucker,” Harry muttered, then licked around Draco’s rim in a spiraling curl.
“But if you come back, it’ll be you begging,” the lock clicked open, and Malfoy turned back and fucking winked, “And I won’t stop.”
You can go your own way
“Sit down and don’t bother,” she perched on the chair opposite, “I’ve known about that muggle whiskey for quite some time.”
“No,” he tried to hold on to himself, “Not at all, never.”
He pulled him close and bit his neck and held him as he nearly fell apart.
“Look, I didn’t want to say anything, not until…”
She leaned on him, her small body tucked perfectly under his chin.
Harry bought the flat - and all the furniture in it, even, it turned out, the green linens - because how could he not?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, sir. But, Mr. Malfoy, if you want to speak to my mum, she’s probably already here,” he gestured towards Longbottom, who’d had his face in his hands since Al appeared, “In the headmaster’s quarters.”
“Come on.”
“I want you to fuck me.”
Harry looked down. The blue and white china had indeed cut him, and he was bleeding - more than a little.
“Which you did, successfully.”
Okay, time to move on.
Harry sat down next to him - moving, just in time, a razor-sharp piece of splintered glass stuck in the carpet (which he thought that maybe Pansy’d left there, just for him) - and fiddled with the cigarette. He opened his mouth, and nothing came out. He coughed, tried again.
“Let’s ask Pants to find us a flat. Together. Alright?”
He felt his shoulders tense up around his ears, and his arm burned, “I still did what I did,” a deep breath, “And with Harry -”
He heard footsteps behind him, and a strong breeze carried a familiar scent - bergamot, oakmoss, labdanum. Fresh and earthy and distinctly Potter, like wind over a Quidditch pitch, sweet vermouth, and the rot-rich floor of the Forbidden Forest.
“I won’t. Ever.”
“Goodbye, Potter.”
Draco snorted, “Why did I ever bother with you?”
Before he sank into sleep, he remembered flashes of golden hair and pale skin, and he was too tired to question the soft smile that he pressed into the mattress.
He was breathing hard and his vision was red around the edges, afternoon light flaring in the corners of his eyes, and Harry’s cock was thick under him, and he was smiling and smiling, and he hated him, he hated him so much, and he grabbed his horrible hair in two fists and touched their lips together, finally, and devoured him.
Only darkness every day
“Draco,” her eyes were soft around the edges, “You gave me a grandchild. You’ve raised him very well - better than we did, you. Astoria as your wife, or not, you’ve made our family proud.”
Ron put his arm around Hermione, and she relaxed into it.
But picking up Malfoy’s wand - here, in a dim bedroom that belonged to a dead man who might have cared for him - that made him feel alive.
“Very well, thanks,” he cleared his throat, awkward, because somehow he still felt outclassed by midget Malfoys, “What’re you listening to?”
He’d never expected to be in the headmaster’s office again.
He had no right. Not when it was Draco who was -
Draco cleared his throat a bit.
“Good,” he sat back, straightened his hair, and grinned, “So?”
“Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Would you care to tell me why I’ve been called here at 10:00 at night?”
Harry shrugged.
He nearly fell on his face trying to pull down the too-tight jeans, but when he wrapped his hand around his swollen, neglected prick, it took two swift pulls before he came, shuddering, imagining Malfoy’s filthy red mouth.
“And I was stupid to believe you could have ever loved me. After all - look at me,” Draco rolled up his sleeve, baring the mark, newer scars from - oh, God, Draco, when did you - where he had tried to cut it out, “Look at this,” he opened his hands, indicating the damage to his study.
It wouldn’t be weird, would it? He was nineteen, and he’d been pretty preoccupied with fighting evil for basically his whole life, so it would make sense, wouldn’t it, for him to go to a nightclub. And he did know where a nightclub was, after all - and the fact that he knew about that because he’d seen Malfoy go in was just a coincidence.
Get back up.
“But I do find myself -”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please, I -”
“Understood.”
Harry sat.
To Potter. And his small copy, forgotten robes and all. And to the tired look on Ginevra’s face.
Playlist track: "Paper Bag" by Fiona Apple.
Potter looked up, hope and fear battling on his face. Draco took a few steps closer to him.
A flash of movement behind him.
As he unfolded his blankets that night and stretched out on the couch - squished and prodded and jumped on by every Weasley-Potter - he thought that he should be… something else. More sad. More angry, at least at himself. But he pulled the hand-crocheted afghan tightly around him, and he closed his eyes, and all he could think about was ice, and juniper, and velvet, and the smell of smoke.
But he did look.
It was nice.
“Aughh, my eyes!”
His whole body was screaming at him, saying yes, yes -
He had never been happier.
And that was the goddamned question wasn’t it, and there wasn’t really a good answer, and he started to feel angry.
“Draco,” a bit of reproval, “Not because of the end of your marriage. But because you felt you had to enter into it at all.”
“‘Cause you saw it from the outside. And that’s a good story, that kind of meant to be, but that’s not what it feels like from the inside.”
“Yeah. So I had to apparate up to Hogsmeade, walk to the castle.”
Pulled out and let him go.
But today, as he made his way towards Chambers’ dim doorway, he felt that thing, following him. Something that should have been buried.
“Yes, Scorpius,” and his lips, despite his exasperated tone, wobbled for just a moment, “It’s alright.”
“Because it’s us, Harry. This is -” his silvery eyes were guarded but endless like the moon, “It’s just - us.
Draco slipped in a third finger, pressing down, and circled the base of Harry’s cock and held tight.
Potter rubbed the back of his neck, and why he thought that was hot, he did not know.
And now, I'm giving up on
The barista was rather cute.
“Mum, can you believe we’re at Hogwarts?”
“I think I may have a few ideas of how to pay you back.”
“And you don’t deserve nice, hmm?”
“Is there something…”
“God, that was incredible.”
“Right,” with a smirk, “Of course.”
He nestled himself between Draco’s legs, Draco’s firm cock pressed up against his arse.
He paused at the door.
Gin, just as pretty as ever but twice as worn out, strapped Lily into her seatbelt. She looked at Harry - with a, that’s your kid, you numpty, glare - and he got the message. Grabbing the robes, he slid out of the car and handed over the keys.
“Well, you did save the world and all.”
“Oh my fucking God,” Potter froze, then shook out a desperate, “Draco.”
“Well…” a broken moan, “It might have something to do with you. Maybe.”
“So.”
“Come to gloat?”
He should have this back, Harry thought. I might as well...
“Oh my God.”
With the movement over him, in him, and the hollow physical pleasure, and the smell of Thom’s cheap cologne, Draco let his mind wander. Float. He let himself be lost in this, another man’s body, the mechanics of fucking, a numbness.
And little Hya Zabini dug in the gardens with Scorpius, getting dirty and laughing and trailing mud all through the manor -
Draco stood, stripping off his robe and hanging it behind the bathroom door. He slid into the tub - built to be large enough for two, though he’d never shared it with anyone. Bubbles reached all the way to his chin. He closed his eyes.
In this other world, they were noticed.
They got the bridal suite at the Metropole hotel.
Ginny glanced over her shoulder.
“Come ‘ere.”
He’d been lucky, actually. In that first week - living off the small purse of galleons he’d managed to grab before leaving the manor - he wasn’t sure how he would survive. But he had ended up going out, night after night, and he usually ended up at Chambers when the pubs closed and the nightclubs opened.
Harry opened the gate, gave a little bow, smiled crookedly. It should not have been cute.
It was like a dream - a nightmare. Draco unbuttoned the top button of his shirt, and then kept going. Inches of creamy skin were revealed. Harry’s mouth was dry. Draco’s long fingers finished with the last button, then pushed the shirt aside.
His first gay bar.
She looked rather fierce for a moment, and he looked like a dressed-down schoolboy. And then Hermione cracked, laughing, and kissed him on his crumby mouth.
“Draco, please -”
“He came back strong, you know. He took control of the manor, the family fortune, and he helped us - all of the Slytherins, who I’m sure you wouldn’t spit on if we were on fire…”
“Mm. The agent’s inside.”
Astoria had joined him - and his mother, cool as ever - for a restorative cup of tea before she apparated to her London flat. She’d moved the last of her belongings in January, but she had tried to spend as much time with Scorpius as possible before he went off to school.
“You don’t get to know that, Potter,” his chest pressed against Harry’s back, arm coming round, hand cradling his cock, firm and inexorable, “I don’t belong to you, not anymore. You’re going to stand there and wonder and doubt and think about all the other men who might have -”
He almost sounded… hopeful. But still so fragile.
Draco smiled against his mouth.
And it was 5:00 in the morning, and he’d only gotten four hours of sleep, and he was full of shame, and even so he was going to get two cups of coffee and meet Draco in the silvery light of sunrise.
“Harry,” he stuck out his hand, and they shook.
And instructions for dancing
They nodded, stood, heads bowed.
Gin was on assignment, somewhere - writing an article on the new experimental training routine of some team in Wales, maybe. He’d been a house Dad for the weekend - fine by him, more time to spend with Lil before…
Until he saw the announcement in the paper. The divorce. A little picture of Malfoy looking cold and remote and severe.
She thwapped his knee with the back of her hand, her diamond ring digging into him.
It had been a very long time since that happened.
Of course, that’s when the train started to move.
And maybe - maybe for some reason he didn't want to touch him. Not right now.
What?
Something that should have been buried, indeed.
"I had a lover
The path is
“No, actually. Not this time. He was open and just - he was just calm.”
They stepped into the lift, and Draco scanned his thumb again, a light popping on for the top floor.
Harry hadn’t known that they’d been kept in holding cells for almost an entire month. Not until he saw Draco’s skin, pale as ice and more translucent, and could almost count each bone in his delicate hands.
He flattened the back of his hair, feeling it spring right back up when he put his hand down.
He picked up the bottle, drank for three precise seconds, and offered it to Harry, who shook his head. He wiped his lips with the back of his hand, marked with Harry’s blood.
Harry trailed after Pansy like a lost puppy, and Draco heard that intimidating clacking as they went down the stairs. He ran his fingers along the double sink - she really had picked the perfect place for him, and he hoped Harry would take it - and stared into the mirror.
“Fuck.”
I’m going to go somewhere. Where no one knows me. Where I can be a kid, for once in my miserable life.
His eyes widened, “Thanks. Er, me too.”
Al spoke up.
“Harry!”
She looked at him. He felt rather like some sort of insect under a scorching magnifying glass.
Harry exhaled. It sounded - pained, and so fucking good, and Draco laughed low in his ear, and Harry dropped his head to the crook of Draco’s neck, wild hair along the side of his face.
Across from the lift, on the other side of the open room, was a wrought iron spiral staircase. Harry walked over to run his hand along the cool marble of the island, and Draco heard a very distinctive sound -
Draco, waiting for him - God, he could get used to that - was washed out, almost white in the faint strains of sunlight, and yet another beautiful thing he thought he’d never get to see. Get to have.
“Hmm?”
For a moment, he’d worried. And then the group of girls broke out into giggles, and the petite redhead yelled out, “You should meet my brother!” And all was well.
And every little part of him, the broken bits, the whole bits - every breath which reminded him of cigarettes at midnight - every time his mother looked at him with a vague, muted disappointment - every time he saw green eyes in the newspaper - every morning when he didn’t wake up in that shitty flat with Cathal and the parakeets upstairs and the old record player and the LPs which skipped -
“Night,” her eyes were already closing, interrupted only by a quiet hiccup or two.
He was raving.
“What do you want?”
And right before the doors opened, he smoothed his face out in that remote Malfoy stare, all traces of nervousness gone.
“Potter,” he muttered, still not opening his eyes, “Why are you talking?”
“Potter,” Pansy barked out, “Let’s talk price. Leave Draco up here to drool over the wardrobe.”
Aengus laughed and tossed back half a pint at once.
Yes, those were some of his sweetest, most delicious memories.
“I thought it was actually for Draco,” she mumbled, “Finally getting him out of that drafty old -”
“Argghh,” Draco grumbled, “Okay, tell me what it is, then shut your fucking gob.”
Harry laughed, “Surely she wasn’t in lingerie in front of Al and Scorp.”
“Just like always.”
Malfoy scoffed. He was unbelievably good at scoffing.
He landed with a stumble in the wizarding reception room of Belfast International Airport.
His son was a good kid. And he had a Potter’s friendship without even really trying. Just by being himself.
It was his flat, after all - his own space, the first home that was truly his, and his alone.
He passed a cigarette over to Harry - who nearly missed him, in the click and whoosh of the lighter, saying,
“Us. Maybe.”
And the way they’d done the shopping together, arguing over what biscuits to buy -
Pansy visited often. She still hated Harry. But she’d go all soft and tender at the pure, unreserved contentment on Draco’s face when Harry kissed him.
He paused, buttoning his Burberry coat.
He didn’t deserve her.
“Hullo, Mr. Potter,” he held out his hand, earbud still in, “How do you do?”
And he didn’t really - he didn’t want to look at why, but having them both in the same room was -
Ginny huffed a laugh.
That was a Ming vase he’d just shattered against the wood-paneled wall of his study. All the Reparos in the world wouldn’t put it back together properly.
Shacking up is all you want to do
“Plus,” Al propped himself up, raising an eyebrow, looking more like Scorp’s father than his own, “I thought the Malfoys were all about incest.”
He leaned over to Draco, his back to Pansy.
Something in Harry’s jeans twitched.
They stayed up all night, snatches of sleep caught here and there, and they greeted the dawn together like it was the first time.
“Yeah, but you also set those birds on me.”
Draco laughed as he let Scorpius’s owl fall into his lap.
And I wanna get up
Harry had a fourth drink. Draco took another shot.
“Oh,” then silence. Another chime, and a light flashing above the lift.
“Do you need me to come through?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, right.”
“You were right after all, Father. So fucking weak.”
Playlist track: "When I Fall in Love" by Nat King Cole, and "The Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth" by David Bowie and Bing Crosby.
To Scorpius, he thought, warmth blooming in his chest - the only thing he’d ever done right.
“Dad!”
It wasn’t anything like the life he’d imagined for himself. And so what, if he really wanted - if he wanted to have -
It was a Malfoy crisis.
God, his hair was probably a mess. Harry stood up straight and caught his reflection in a shop window.
He had to make the hurt go away.
“Let’s not pretend,” she reached out her hand again, got his fingers to uncurl, “We did that for too long.”
“No argument from me.”
Draco breached him, skilled, and found his prostate with a quick twist, rubbing with no mercy.
Draco holding his face, whispering, “You’re so fucking beautiful,” and Harry knowing, for once, that it was true -
I've held this dream for such a long long time
“It’s alright, Harry. We did ask you over.”
Harry’s head lifted - it was like he was mesmerized, Merlin, this place was perfect - and he spotted Pansy.
Back in their own flat, Harry and Draco were snuggled up under their green duvet with silver stitching, totally nude, as always. Draco’s head was tucked up under Harry’s chin, and Harry kissed his platinum hair.
Harry set a punishing pace, tilting his hips up and stroking incessantly against Draco’s prostate, grabbing his cock with his come- and lube-drenched fingers, jerking him fast and rough.
“Fine,” Draco removed his hands from his pockets, standing up straight, “I’ll make it easy for you.”
Playlist track: "I'd Love to Change the World" by Jetta, Matstubs. "I'd love to change the world/But I don't know what to do."
“If you still want me to - ah, please, right there - to fuck you…”
A dim and long-buried truth began to emerge before him.
He looked at himself in the mirror, large and sparkling. Catalogued every fine line, the hairs turning silver, signs of maturity hard won since that summer in Cork.
He leaned back into Harry’s muscled arm, flicked his cigarette into the water. He put his hand on Harry’s thigh.
He was, of course, in the middle of the press of bodies, and he shone brighter than anyone there. If the other dancers were like ballet, he was like flying. The soft fall of his hair was disheveled - Harry had never seen it like this, because his hair had always been so meticulously gelled - and brushing over his eyes. His long limbs wrapped around the neck of a shorter brunet in front of him - muscled arms twined around him, from behind, as another man grinded against his back. And he was breathing, heavy, the way Harry had started to breathe - Harry’s exhale was his inhale, and Harry wanted to feel that breath on the soft skin below his jaw, and exchange something with him, blows, barbs, something more, something he had never let himself think about.
If you should ever feel so broken that you can't go on
“You should call me Harry,” he sat on the bench, the hood of his jacket warm around the dark bruise on his neck that he hadn’t, for some reason, wanted to heal.
“Just remembering that last time in the bath, when you -”
He fell onto Harry, smearing come over both of them.
Harry walked further into the room, avoiding shards of glass and wood and pottery. He stopped, far enough away from Draco to be able to draw his own wand if it were necessary.
But here, in front of a roaring fire, nestled into deep cushions, a view over the city, croissants in the pantry and warm drinks whenever he wanted them -
“Did you think that going into the forest might be dangerous? And that it is, for that reason, forbidden?”
He’d retired to his father’s - his, for these sixteen years - study. The black curtains over Lucius’s portrait were spelled shut, as usual, and his crystal snifter was waiting to be filled from a decanter of firewhiskey.
“Uneventful? You?”
“How - how is Ginevra?”
He looked at the carpet, glass and burn marks, and he thought about how he had been so scared, back in the coffee shop, to open his mouth. How he hadn’t, then. He remembered watching Draco’s back as he walked away, and the sound of his strangled voice, that last day in the flat. He breathed in -
Later, privately, he’d shouted at Kingsley, demanding an explanation. Kingsley replied, “We’re doing our best, Harry. And frankly, I'm surprised to hear that you care.”
“Oi, unbruised, if you please.”
Part of a pure-blood education was learning about and developing respect for their cultural holy days. His mother had always taken him out at winter solstice to light a candle against the dark; his father helped him pour mead for the Aos Si on Samhain. It was what it meant to be a wizard - tradition, the old ways, the power of the land - and it was what he was told he was fighting for when he took the mark.
The air in the flat was thick with smoke and sweat and buried rage. Draco stood, went to the window, opened it.
Cleaned, dried, groomed, and calmed, he sat at his desk. He picked up his favorite quill. And he scrawled out a reply that he already regretted.
Fine.”
He still barely looked up, desperate to reach the train in time, but he was hit by a familiar smell and by the softness of an expensive cloak. Juniper, sandalwood, vanilla, a thick-napped velvet.
“I am sorry.”
I am in control, here.
Maybe he was worried that if he opened his mouth it would all - it would be real. He’d start talking and tell Draco everything - from how badly he wanted him, right now against the glass window, to what he’d had for breakfast that morning; from the way he’d looked at Ginny and wished she were pale and blonde and mean to what he’d been imagining when he wanked in the shower last night, clenching his mouth shut so he wouldn’t make a sound. Everything.
“We live in better times, you know?”
Draco whirled, and his voice was so familiar - it was the voice he’d used to torment, to bully.
“He got Slytherin, didn’t he?”
“Love me forever, ‘course.”
Draco dropped his forehead to the back of his neck and breathed, frustrated, pained, “Why do I let you -”
Harry kissed back like he always did - rough but tender, and breaking.
He made his babbity rabbity face, nose all scrunched up, and sang until Lily was almost crying with laughter.
They all seemed so painfully young.
A long pause, in which he could practically taste Draco’s customary morning irritation.
“Mm.”
“Well,” Scorp put the snitch down, “It’s all a bit…”
Pans sent him the Prophet, sometimes, for the financial section. He started thinking about Gringotts, the way it was antiquated and mismanaged, and what he would do if he had the family money, a little more leverage. The muggle world, with its credit cards and ATMs and all that technology, was so much more efficient.
How could he have forgotten, for even one second, what that voice could do to him? He felt his cock, filling, thick and heavy against his pyjamas.
“Only you.”
Smooth, slender, understated, elegant.
Harry’s hand was beginning to shake, he was holding his wand so hard.
They dried off, thoroughly taking advantage of the fluffy towels, and fell back onto the bed. Draco reached for Harry’s - achingly hard - cock, but he slapped the hand away.
Albus moved into Jamie’s old room.
You want more and you want it fast."
“This is a weird conversation to have with the woman who bore your children.”
“That maybe wasn’t the best idea…”
“Er, what?”
Fifteen minutes later and he’d acquired some sort of blue concoction which tasted like coconut and orange. He tried to take small sips, pacing himself, and then he noticed -
Draco shuddered dramatically.
It wasn’t a sexuality crisis.
And he was rock fucking hard.
Harry kissed his ear, “Good.”
Playlist track: "Creep" by Radiohead.
“Let me,” he grabbed Draco, a little too rough, and ran his hands under his shirt, along the taut muscles of his abdomen.
“Oh, I dunno,” he nudged Draco’s shoulder, “I may need to try it a few more times. Just to be sure.”
He left him in that bathroom - ran away, panicked, terrified of his own capacity for violence and the sudden knowledge, the true root of him, the explanation, the reason he kept going, day after day, Draco, hated, beloved, beautiful as he was baptized by his own blood. It was a hideous kind of love, nothing warm or soft about it - it wasn’t like the love he had for Ginny, who was sweet and kind and a little acerbic and a lot stubborn, a girl who loved him back, who made him feel good about himself, and who felt like family already.
“I think it’s time to tell the kids.”
And there was Al, also listening to music - one earbud in and the other trailing off…
The person he’d injured, terribly. More than once.
“Should we get a cat, do you think?”
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Draco looked up to the ceiling, then sighed.
“Which one?” At Draco’s confused look, he clarified, “Jamie is a menace to your face. Al’s a menace behind your back.”
And it was too early, and he was too young, but he thought - he thought it would be nice, someday, to have kids who looked like him, like his dad. Like his own mum.
He stroked, slowly, pressure just a hair too light, and watched the mingled frustration and pleasure shifting on Draco’s face.
Because he had been shamed, bloody, broken, sliced to ribbons by Harry’s wand, and all he’d thought was no, no, please -
He shook his head and flushed.
And, it turned out, most of his preconceived notions about Snape were wrong.
Harry had never been so certain and so terrified at the same time.
Scorp licked a hot line over the love bite, “I plan on being a gentleman of leisure.”
“More or less.”
“Harry, come on…”
The band started up in earnest, and by now all of the students had memorized the set, all the words of the songs, and the room was filled with the not altogether in tune shout-singing of drunken voices. Britt started in on a bottle of Bulmers pear cider, and Draco leaned back against the bar and just - watched.
“Hi, gorgeous,” a voice from behind him. He reached his arm back and wound his fingers through coarse hair. He felt solid, warm, good to lean on, but his scent wasn’t quite right.
Draco turned, staring back out into the street. And then without deigning to look over his shoulder, he spoke, quietly, the last words that Harry would get from him for seventeen years.
Playlist tracks: "Rebel Rebel" by David Bowie (Reality version) and "Papaoutai" by Stromae.
“How lucky for them,” and he finally broke eye contact, “And you’re not that old.”
He slumped. Oh well.
Or full fucking color.
He laughed, “Of course. Didn’t want to deal with me herself.”
It was an uncomfortable thing to acknowledge that someone could hate you, and you could hate them, and it didn’t really matter at all. Snape was a hero, Harry was an idiot, and the world kept turning.
There was a bit of space between them, here at this table in this muggle cafe, and Harry didn’t know what to do with his words, because that bit of space was 17 years worth of regrets. Good things, too, like kids, and hard work, and family, but…
“Oh, yes,” he pretended that he had forgotten, that her words were a revelation, “I suppose you must be right.”
Draco scoffed.
He stood, too quick for Harry to catch the movement, and walked to unlock the door.
“And now I’ve done that, so I don’t have to do it again for a while.”
Harry barked a laugh.
Everything's waiting for you
Die a little bit.
“Please, Draco -”
“Ohhh -”
He was 37.
“And I may have an unopened Owl. From them.”
“But then you tripped, coming back down the stairs to the dungeons, and fell out from under the cloak,” another nod, “And you were found out by your head of house.”
Harry fell on top of him, breathed a sigh of relief, “Thank Merlin.”
He’d noticed very little, stumbling to the cafe, and noticed nothing at all after seeing Malfoy’s shining blonde hair. But now he took stock of the city, just on the edge of wakefulness. The air was fresh, with a hint of damp, like a cool bath on a hot day. It felt like a city that came alive at night - he noticed pub crammed up next to pub, boxes of red flowers lining gold-painted windows. White and purple weeds bloomed between the grey stones of a low wall, a river running through, down past a hill and deeper into the city.
Seven years as best friends - sneaking around as so much more for two of those, and kissing in secret corridors, and laughing into their pillows, trying to keep quiet, trying to spend every possible moment together - they were... inevitable.
When Draco and his mum were placed on probation - put on house arrest for a year, fines levied for the rebuilding of Hogwarts - they just breathed out. No real sign of relief, or joy. Harry supposed it would be hard to be happy when your father, your husband, had been sentenced to fifty years imprisonment. He wondered if Lucius could survive it.
“You do, don’t you? Like what you see.”
The person he would love until he closed his eyes, one last time, and woke in a white-washed Kings Cross and finally boarded the train that had been waiting for him since he was 17 years old.
He picked up the glass, settled into a wingback chair in front of the fire.
Even if you won't"
“David Bowie, of course.”
But Draco -
Which led him to today, standing here in front of one of the more modern wizarding developments, waiting, as always, for Harry.
“Ugh, well, if he wakes up in the night he’s all yours, Ronald.”
Draco’s voice was like gravel. He stubbed out the cigarette. Cleared his throat.
Draco trailed off, and behind his still perfect pale skin and his shining fall of hair and his undoubtedly expensive muggle suit, he looked quietly miserable.
All of our stories have what ifs. We cannot go through life without them - without the paths we didn’t take, without the paths our parents and lovers and friends took. We’re strung out on a line, decision after decision tumbling down our lives, triggering the next, the next. We have all of the control and none. Harry and Draco - this has been their story, their choices, their consequences, unalterable as it was told. Lived. But -
“Harry Potter,” he gripped his wrists, leaned down to place lingering kisses on the stretch of neck he always kept bruised and that Harry never healed, “Are you listening to me?”
“Fuck, Pans…”
You love bands when they're playing hard
Scorpius looked to his right, just moving his eyes.
He remembered the night that they’d both tried to fit in his tiny shower cubicle. How it was fun, and silly, and kind of sexy, until it wasn’t anymore - Harry breathing too hard, showing the whites of his eyes like a spooked horse, freezing cold and sweating buckets. Wrapping him up in blankets, holding him, as he spoke in a toneless voice.
Harry relaxed his legs further, pressing up against Draco - and Draco’s breath caught, but he didn’t pull away.
He licked foam from his lips, the hint of grey whiskers catching drops of beer.
And this house just ain't no home
“Look, I don’t want to say all this in an owl. And I know I don’t deserve any of your time, after… everything. But I’d really like to see you. Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
He was so handsome.
“Come on,” he pushed Thom off, “I want you to fuck me in a proper bed.”
“Ginevra didn’t get to pick names?”
He had more patience, now, and took lots of time, until Draco was drenched, his cock full, heavy between his legs, brushing against the bed. And he was gorgeous, and Harry loved him so much, and how had he ever thought he could live without this, and he breathed so hot against his tender skin, and in typical Harry style blurted out -
“I don’t need all this.”
“Just like always.”
He felt Pans tense next to him. She glared at Potter, then kissed Draco on the head as she picked up her jacket, stood, and muttered, “Do you want me to stay?”
I think he’s my best friend at Hogwarts so far, though I have to meet more people, and Hya is my other best friend but honestly, she’s such a girl sometimes. Holding my hand because of grindylows…
“We have children.”
“Nev was there.”
“It’s not the whole building, surely,” he looked intimidated.
“What are you doing?”
He’d done all the things you’re supposed to do, you know, when you’re facing down a lack of passion with your wife and considering that you might really, truly, after all that bother, be attracted to men. He knew he’d enjoyed the hell out of every fucking second with...
He gripped her hand.
Draco sat on their one chair, his whole body still but tense. Anticipatory.
“And who are you?”
Scorpius nudged Albus, who slumped and muttered, “No, headmaster.”
“We can’t help that our parents are… complicated. I mean, I had to come to terms with the fact that my dad is, you know,” in air quotes, “Harry Potter, a long time ago. And you -”
This is how it could have been different.
Walking Draco back from work in the afternoon sunshine, when he got promoted and grinned to split his face -
“Oh, right. Draco.”
“I read about the potion, sir, and me and Scorp thought we could make it.”
She kept talking, fast.
Their eyes were locked. Potter tilted his head, a gesture, come here. Draco smirked, trying to find some sense of control, and shook his head, and crooked one finger.
He took a drag from his cigarette, whirled drunkenly, glared with swollen eyes at his father’s curtained portrait.
He pushed through more muscled bodies and ran to the toilets, blessedly empty. He leaned over the sink and breathed, breathed, tried to screw up his eyes against what he had already seen.
And then he felt filthier.
He poured lube on his fingers, a whole mess of it, and wrapped both hands around Harry’s nearly painfully hard cock. Three quick pulls, and then he stopped, running his left hand down, one finger resting against his arsehole.
Draco stared and made no move to take it.
Harry had never been good with words. He tried to put it in his eyes - I know, I know that you wanted to escape, I know that this isn’t the life you wanted, I know you didn’t understand what it would all mean.
The next day, he enrolled in business classes at the university.
And then, that next July, Father died.
Almost finished, then. The fire, constantly lit, snapped and popped behind him as he tried to pour a measure in his snifter - and then dumped out the whole thing.
“Fuck, I love you -”
“I was thinking it would be nice if we, you know, stayed over at the hotel. Got room service. Had a bath.”
Scorp held on, just a bit too tight, “I just - I’m not ready, you know? For things to change.”
Laughing, he pulled away, leaning down to whisper, “I don’t like girls, sorry.”
“Who sent the owl?”
“Really really,” he put his arm around her and squeezed, “You’ll always be my little girl, and I’ll always be your dad.”
Silence. He was trembling - from anger, from shame, from gratitude to his best friend for caring so much.
She raised an eyebrow - something he’d seen Malfoy do a million times. It must have been genetic. Her face was thin, more fine lines than before, but she had maintained some of her steely beauty.
“Jesus fuck,” Harry pulled away for a breath, panting.
Hard, lean muscle skimmed and slipped, hands dipping into the backs of trousers. Tousled hair brushed against arched necks as bodies were embraced from behind. All that glitter - eyes lined with kohl seemed to speak promises, intent. Some of what he saw could be called dancing, and it was - it was almost carefully coordinated, like the ballet, like war, and it was filthy like fucking, and Harry cursed as his jeans felt tighter.
Harry leaned in, mouth close to his ear, whispering, “I know every fucking thing about you, Malfoy.”
“I was thinking - I wanted to -”
“Well?”
His voice was small, “I’m scared, Pans.”
“So, tonight? We can stay in?”
“That would explain the pain, then.”
She backed up and held him by the shoulders, looking torn between hugging him again or shaking the hell out of him. Both of which he needed, it felt like. She straightened up, cleared her throat, and pasted on the smile that had made her one of the most successful estate agents in England.
“I suppose it is sufficient.”
Scorp’s frown softened, “Yeah.”
He couldn’t be sure, but he thought that Narcissa Malfoy was trying not to laugh at him.
“Good.”
Nobody here can do it for me
When he got back home - to the home that Gin was keeping, and he couldn’t call his, anymore - Ginny gave him a quiet, reproving look, and then fed him the dinner that she’d put under a stasis charm.
He thought back to a night in early July, when they’d danced straight through to sunrise, talking utter nonsense, laughing, sitting on the front stoop and chain smoking. It had been a beautiful night, and he’d felt purged, like every drop of sweat was an asperges, the salt-slick wiping away his sins. They’d talked about a lot of things, and without really thinking about it, Harry slurred out,
She ran a hand through his hair, gentle, and then ruffled it up.
She carefully pleated the edges of her damask robes.
Could he really - was he acting like this just because of one dance?
“Don’t say it, not until you… You know what, fine. Now,” he could hear the predatory smile, God he loved her, “Let’s talk.”
“Er.”
Draco hovered over Harry’s lips, just a breath away, and before he kissed him, he whispered,
He grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him out the front door, through a knot of smokers, and across the street, up the stairs of the courthouse. They ducked behind a stone pillar, and he pushed Harry right up against it.
Harry apparated to his hotel room with a violent crack.
“You going to share, or what?”
He’d stopped breathing, that must have been it - that was why he was so dizzy, and why he gasped out, “Fuck, Malfoy.”
It's just that I've been losing so long"
A few curious glances were thrown his way, but he ducked his head before anyone could point and stare (“That’s Harry Potter!”) and, for lack of anything else to do, ran out to catch a black cab.
Loving his kids was easy.
“Thanks.”
He turned, setting down his glass again, and climbed on top of Draco, water sloshing over to the floor. He ran his hand over his neck, over the firm planes of Draco’s chest, his tight pink nipples, down over his stomach, gripping onto his cock.
She looked at him, perplexed, “Blonde?”
“I -” oh. Oh.
The American girl, Britt, held up another red white and blue shot. They cheered - a muddled “Slainte!” - and tossed them back. Liam rolled his eyes and set up the next round.
He was in their tiny kitchenette, fully nude, staring at the remains of Harry’s box of sugar - holes chewed straight through, and granules loose on the counter.
“Draco -”
“I’m up, I’m up,” he mumbled into the floor, not actually getting up.
Oh, great. His favorite part. Wizarding literature really was… something. But apparently no one could sing the cackling stump’s song as well as he.
“Did you mean it?”
“Sure,” Harry looked up at Ron, who rolled his eyes from behind Hermione’s head.
And that was good. More than good.
And another part of him, which he was resolutely ignoring, wondered if he wasn’t just excited to spend any time with Harry at all.
He stepped away, economical and meticulous in all of his movements.
It was late autumn, the sun still misty over the rooftops below his flat, brief fragments of light refracted by the large, charmed windows, giving his living space a rainbow sheen. Harry stumbled down the stairs, lit the fire - even though the flat was temperature-controlled with a complex weaving of warming and cooling charms, he liked to keep it just shy of too cold. He had so many fond memories of the fire burning in the Gryffindor common room, and he didn’t see why he should deny himself, as an adult, the cozy atmosphere of crackling logs and pine-scented smoke.
Please say yes.
He thought about home, Ron and ‘Mione and, oh God, Ginny - what would they think, if they knew that the most pleasurable moment of his 19 years was clutching at Draco in the dark, giving in? He tried to imagine kissing Ginny, winding his fingers through her flame-bright hair - he felt an echo of love, like a sepia-toned photograph. Something precious but aged, like a snapshot in a family scrapbook.
He took a deep breath.
He stayed kneeling.
He took one last look at his best friends in the entire world, and maybe he should have felt a bit sad. But when he felt that hook, deep in him, of the portkey, he thought, thank fuck.
Draco’s mind started filling in the gaps, to his everlasting horror. Neville, who looked like he wished the floor would swallow him up. Ginevra, in a negligee, freckles on shocking display. And Luna, apparently, his charmingly mad cousin, who was in their...
He turned, just once, as he went into the bar.
“Excuse me -” Harry nearly spat.
“I suppose I’m making up for lost time, myself,” a wry smile, “As you might have noticed.”
“Yeah,” his voice was high, too loud, and Harry thrust in with one smooth slide, “Oh, please -”
“Al, we’ve got lunch going in here -”
“A bath,” he picked his head up and raised his eyebrows, “Are you trying to tell me something?”
He snorted, “Alright. So…”
He had no real right to think that, but as he observed clumsy flirtation and excessive drinking and a bit of groping in dark corners he wondered if any of these kids knew, had even the slightest perception of how the world had almost ended. He figured that they all had their own stories - heartbreak, boyfriends and girlfriends back home that they pretended they weren’t cheating on, parents who maybe didn’t love them enough, papers to write and promises to keep. But how many of them could have possibly known that, if not for one stupid orphaned boy with cheap glasses and a huge fucking prick, it turned out, they’d be slaves to the darkest wizard of all time. They’d be chattel. They’d be nothing.
He met his eyes and just… stared.
“Yeah.”
Go your own way
“Draco, hi, I, er,” he tried to stand up but was penned in.
Anytime she goes away"
“After all that, I… You made me…”
“Save yourself a walk tomorrow.”
“Come on, can’t quit now!”
“You know I love my son. I would never change that.”
Har had found him, after all.
They did lines in the toilets - Thom rubbed up against him, “I could have you right now, God, you’re beautiful.”
“Better times, hmm?” He sucked on Al’s neck, leaving a deep purple bruise (not knowing, thank God, that that was his father’s signature move).
Maybe tonight, when the bar closed down at midnight, maybe he’d take that nameless guitarist and -
“Think of the way you shoved into me, splitting me open with your massive cock, making me beg?”
Harry when he slid home for the first time and the way he looked
"Hunger hurts
After, when the boys took Lil down to skip stones on the lake, he and Gin sat there, shell shocked.
“Well stop.”
He started preparing a second cup of espresso. Because, well, it seemed like a better idea than staring at the lift like a nutter.
Ron and Hermione’s was exactly as he would have imagined if he had tried to picture it when they left school. Organized, beautiful, comfortable, and warm.
Like that was going to work. Draco had practically invented that particular pout.
It was stupid and wrong and truly poor planning. But to them, from the inside, it just felt like -
Once we've both said our goodbyes
He twitched under the duvet, his mind half in sleep and half in all the things he’d been turning over like a stone, rubbing and rubbing ‘til all the rough edges were worn smooth. Al and Jamie at school, so no plan yet on how to divide the time; Lily happiest staying with her mum, for now; and all the hours he’d be on his own, truly alone in a way he’d never been.
“I dunno. I’m supposed to go back to the airport.”
Harry felt a hot flash of - yeah, it was jealousy. And anger, that someone else, some woman, had touched him.
"I woke up thinking you were still here
“You really are an idiot,” her voice was fond, and what on earth did he do to deserve her kindness?
He smoked his last pack of cigarettes, ashing right over the grinning faces of people he didn’t, it turned out, know very well at all.
No chance of the kind of love that holds you down.
They hadn’t told their children.
Maybe he’d never left there. Maybe he carried that putrid decay in him. Maybe it came from him, rot arising from his very flesh.
I don’t know how to -
“You can do anything you want, Draco. Anything.”
The Slytherin dorms are really cool, you were right. Some of the other first years were scared because a grindylow swam up to the window and pulled horrible faces but of course I wasn’t, Dad. Even if Auntie Pants’ daughter says I grabbed her hand. Which I didn’t. Because Hyacinthe is a liar, and not very cunning really
He snorted, “Merlin knows that’s true.”
“Are you?” His words as violent as the crack of a bullwhip, and then fragile, “Will you be coming back?”
“Are we?” Gin looked around, pretending shock.
“Night night, Daddy.”
“No?” He looked away, slumping, “You have - there are reasons why you might.”
“Well, I never -” his voice came to an abrupt stop as Harry mouthed at the tender skin of his inner thighs.
He paced in front of the gate - warded with elaborate and efficient spells, polished to a black gleam. The building rose high above him, so unlike traditional wizarding architecture; it appealed to him even as it was foreign and new. Clean lines, steel and glass and concrete, mixed with powerful magic. He’d no idea if Harry would like it, and a little mean part of him felt pretty damned good about possibly wasting his time.
He slid down Al’s body, hands on his zip, and smirked, “Well, obviously.”
“No,” Harry wiped at his eyes, and Draco rolled his own, but with a tiny smile tucked in the corner of his mouth, “It’s perfect.”
The door to the toilets slammed closed.
Creamy, too-sweet coffee in hand, he fell back into the deep plush of the velvet settee. He propped his feet up, right over the left, and looked out over London.
“We can do what we want. They - they at least felt like - they couldn’t,” he pulled, gently, on Scorp’s feet, and Scorp slid up to sit in his lap.
"Yeah."
“Take your own clothes off, will you?”
Harry nearly choked on his own beer.
Draco looked down at the cup in his hands, as if only now noticing it, and frowned.
Now, without his son, without his wife, it was just Draco and his mother and a few house-elves.
“Ugh!”
It was new, and it was strange, and it was perfect. Draco was gentle with him - not tentative, no, but - almost reverent. Harry felt him slip in another finger, and the stretch was so good, because it was Draco stretching him, Draco’s long fingers, his smell everywhere, his face so serene and predatory and that twitch in his eye that showed he was nervous. He looked dangerous, like something untamed, and he held Harry in his hand like a bird he could crush, and when he found Harry’s prostate it was like coming home.
I know everything you don't want me to."
And Draco walked Harry into the forest and kissed him in the dark and it was terrifying and desperate and still so, so sweet.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry laughed a little, awkward.
He rose, ran his fingers through Scorp’s hair, brought their faces close together.
“And I had to gather it at night, ‘cause it only blooms on the full moon.”
“Come on, wanna come when you’re in me.”
Like his whole heart shot forth from his fucking cock. Like he’d stay there, in him, forever, if asked.
“I always -” she was staring into the fire, and he tried to reach her with his words like a little boy grabbing for his mum’s hand, “I thought you were disappointed in me. For the divorce.”
“Oh really?”
He was 37. Fuck. He was 37.
“Just like always.”
“I’m sorry,” he felt a pressure behind his eyes, “I wish - I wish I were different.”
All he got back from Draco’s eyes was a flicker - and it could have been understanding, but it also could have been anger, or resentment, or shame. He still made no move to take the wand, so Harry placed it next to the decanter.
Lily, their third (and rather more cunning) Slytherin, decorated her room in bright green, mirrors everywhere and silvery curtains around her bed, and got on fabulously with Draco - who had way too much fun spoiling her rotten - and was often planning world domination.
It was a miracle that he’d found Malfoy at all.
Rather a lot, he imagined.
He went to the windows, staring out over London, and hoped. It was so quiet. Then a low voice, closer than he expected, almost in his ear.
“Yeah, Dad,” Lily took a deep breath and then hiccupped and fell dramatically back onto the bed, “Oh, no!”
“Malfoy,” he imitated the regal - if exhausted - tone.
And that Christmas Eve - the first one they shared as a family, when things were still a little new and a little wobbly but so, so good - Nev and Gin and Luna came over to help them trim the gigantic and mostly tasteful (but rather ostentatious) tree and it was - it was just right.
“Your ex-wife is a polyamorous nymphomaniac.”
“Just. Thank you.”
Scorpius and Albus were thrilled to be roommates, naturally, and they were two peas in a pod - getting into trouble every once in a while, but also earning high marks and being, in general, great kids. It all went very well until that summer before their seventh year, when Harry’d walked into their room, and -
Too many years ago, now, he and Harry had crowded around his tiny sink, brushing their teeth, worn out but keyed up as 19 year old kids usually are. They’d been out all night, and Draco was about five minutes away from being late to work, and he nudged Harry with little energy and said, “Why the fuck are you still up, you’ve got nowhere to be, go the fuck back to sleep.”
“You -” Al lifted his head.
Draco raised his eyebrows straight to his hairline.
“Of course. So we’re not at school. So what? We’ll still…”
So that was a yes on the begging.
Now, in the dazzling sunshine, he just breathed in Harry’s smell and Harry’s smile and Harry’s taste, and it was as fresh and ripe as golden apples from the tree.
“I give in,” Al said, getting ready for bed (once their totally mortifying fathers had left), wrapping an arm around Scorp as they brushed their teeth. “Our dads are terminally weird. You were right.”
He made an extravagant gesture in his chest region. And a bit of a disgusted face.
Harry sat at a small table under the picture window at the front of the cafe. He had a huge mug of coffee - a latte with too much milk and too much caramel sauce, which made it perfect - and across from him he’d set up Draco’s double espresso with a small pot of cream, both under a stasis charm.
Show up. Follow someone else’s plan.
“Draco fucking Malfoy,” he paused - Draco had almost laughed, “I have loved you every single day of my life. I will go on loving you until death takes me a second time.
They shared one of those looks that only long-time partners can share. Ron tilted his head, and Hermione spoke first.
“Hmm.”
“What?” Harry didn’t think of himself as much of a squawker, but that had not been a dignified noise. Hugo giggled.
Albus spat, smiled, kissed his neck, and slapped his arse.
Draco was often incoherent after his morning shift, and they usually spent afternoons lazing about in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.
And a few lines, nothing too soft or romantic but still sweet like the first ice creams of summer, about how she hoped he was having a good time, and that she missed him.
He couldn’t have that, here.
“And I would again, if I had to,” she smirked.
She picked up Hugo, tucking a few curls behind his ears, and then leaned over to kiss Harry’s cheek.
“Oh, Harry,” she tried to cover her eyes, but kept gawking at him. She was laughing pretty hard now.
As they try to change their worlds
Champagne ordered and delivered - and Draco did do very well, though he did shout into the phone, a bit - Harry ran a steaming hot bath.
“I’m honestly grateful, sort of,” he ran his hands up Scorp’s shins, fiddling with the seams on his jeans.
“Yes, well,” she leaned her shoulder against his, “You always did have terrible taste.”
“Alright. Headmaster, what consequences do you recommend?”
“Scorp…”
“Are there, er, bedrooms?”
That was the path they had taken, and they did their best.
Harry missed, fiercely, the days when he could have all of Draco, when he didn’t put on his masks. But losing that closeness, that vulnerability, was his own damned fault.
“Fine,” he heard the rustling of fabric, the sound of a zipper, and Draco entered him with a heartbroken noise, like he was dying.
Of all the stupid -
He tossed his keys down, pulled off his shirt, exposing the long, spidery scars and his fading Dark Mark.
She tip-toed her way into the room on scandalously high heels and stared down at him, stern but not cruel.
He didn’t know what else to do. So he started to walk away.
Pansy was inside, “setting the mood,” as she called it - usually lighting some candles and baking biscuits so the cinnamon sugar smell filled the space, and casting cleaning charms on every surface.
He saw an engagement announcement in the paper. A picture, green eyes, a yellow dress.
He clenched, relaxed, “Draco -”
Meeting all his friends, these new muggle people who adored him -
“Merlin knows how.”
And Draco bent him over the sink, their flushed, damp faces panting in the mirror, Harry’s scar as red as blood, Draco’s black mark visible as he held himself against the wall, and it must have been close to the way that dragons make love, high up in the air, with sparks and shards of lightning.
Loving him in that way he told himself is only possible when you’re young. When your heart is still fresh enough to break.
“Why are you getting a divorce?” he shot back, fast. A little too loud. And he made the toad face again.
Draco did move into the flat that Pansy’d really picked for him, and yes, he did need all that room in the wardrobe, thank you very much, Potter. He whispered sweet nothings to the espresso machine (and occasionally to Harry, though there was usually profanity involved. And nudity.)
“What you -” he blushed, “What you said. About…”
“Come home with me.”
Her eyes were kind, meeting his, like she knew exactly how he felt.
Oh it kills"
“Draco, what -”
Draco’s profile looked uncertain - angry, and flushing pink, and maybe really rather offended.
“Thanks, Mrs. Malfoy.”
A bitter laugh. He pulled away, voice turning clinical.
He’d been lonely for so much of his life.
Through the closet and into the bathroom, they admired the deep soaking tub, the frankly obscenely massive shower, the double sink, the black and white tile, the gold fixtures. It was absolutely perfect.
“I’m a monogamous nymphomaniac. For you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, well,” he wiped blood on his shirt and felt around for his pack, “I’m a Malfoy. We do everything well.”
He looked - well, he looked good. And uncomfortable.
He became aware of the fact that his mouth was hanging open, probably very unattractively. He closed it with an audible clack of his teeth.
These days, these days
He snorted, and ran his hand down Harry’s neck, and -
He shrugged, embarrassed.
And then he thought he might choke on the off-time thumping of his heart as Potter did.
“Are you ever going to get to the fucking?”
And giggled.
“You’re still getting the coffee,” Draco mumbled as he drifted off towards sleep.
“I’m sure Al just loved having his famous dad appear at the sorting feast.”
Draco pulled Harry’s hips up further, leaned forward, pressed in. And it hurt, God how it hurt, but it seemed like the real hurt was somewhere else, in him, because after about five seconds he felt full and fantastic and fucking cared for and cradled and - and -
He’d got it, and he was still miserable.
He had moments like this. When he felt like he was being followed. As if his past were a person, chasing him.

He rubbed the back of his neck, grimacing.
“Me neither. I mean, I wasn’t when I saw that you and Astoria -”
“Love you too.”
“I’ve never done anything.”
He was too young, far too young, but -
But he couldn’t, he was noisy, he’d break from the kiss to beg him to touch him, for fucks sake, and Draco whispered in his ear,
It was a terrible end, he thought, to the rivalry that lived in him, innate.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just get out.”
“And you can come stay whenever you like, you know?”
He was shaking. Harry held him and kissed his ear and he might have been sorry for making such an awful mess of things but fuck, that had been absolutely incredible, and it was true that for those few blinding seconds he’d never loved anything the way he loved Draco.
“Bring Lily for lunch, alright? And we’ll - we’ll just do it.”
With all of the furnishings in place, he hadn’t needed to make a lot of purchases, but the first - and most expensive - houseware he’d bought was a top of the line espresso machine. As he handed over his Gringotts charge card, he’d ignored the fact that he, himself, wasn’t that invested in high-quality espresso. It just -
“Well,” still prickly, but running his hands gently over Harry’s arse, “What else do you do in a bath? It’s just a… common association.”
“You - sweet Morgana fuck - you try staying still, when -”
“So you decided to go into the Forbidden Forest under an invisibility cloak. And the ‘we’ means you and Albus, I presume?”
Fiendfyre, cigarettes, records skipping as they reached their end.
In their first year at Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall - who was so often exasperated and busy and run off her feet by her rebellious Gryffindor charges - watched Harry Potter. She saw how he was too thin, how he stuffed himself in the great hall, hunched over his plate, protecting it - how he flinched too easily and too often. She took her concerns to Dumbledore, who attempted, in his usual enigmatic way, to brush her off. And she stood her ground.
“A - your arsehole, so perfect, Draco, I swear to God - cat?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He laughed, damn him.
Draco’s voice was stilted, uncomfortable, and perfectly pitched to sound polite, if insincere. Harry squinted at him.
“And I love you, you queer lunatic,” she sniffled, then shot out, “Now bugger off, I want to get one more shag in.”
No matter what Malfoy had said, he did get rather too much attention at Hogwarts.
And attached to Scorpius Malfoy. Okay then.
Harry sucked hard - he smelled so good, how was he always so perfect - then laved him with gentle swipes of his tongue when Draco dug his heels under his shoulder blades.
Pulsed in him. Gave himself over. Gripped him in a just-fucked embrace.
Harry leaned up against the brick building around the corner from where he’d watched Malfoy duck into a closed club. His heart was racing and his hands were sweaty. He rubbed his dry eyes, still sandy from the few snatches of sleep he caught on the train.
A quick kiss, familiar, on her freckled cheek. And then they had that quick moment which probably happened to a lot of couples on their way to a divorce but not used to it yet - oh, shit.
“You. I’m asking you.”
“Oh?” She pulled her hand back, not unkindly, and blushed a pale pink, “I suppose he would be.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” Draco took a swallow of whiskey, “Get up.”
What the fuck.
We should talk.”
Harry froze, too. He thought back - back to when they started talking about baby names. He’d cared too much - he maybe always felt that Harry was a stupid name, too plain, just, not enough of a link to all of the people who’d gone before him. So for his kids, he thought he’d give them that gift. The gift of legacy. People who would have loved them so much.
And at every milestone he’d had a glass. That night, the betrothal. The bonding ceremony, elegant and sophisticated and passionless. An extra shot before he made love to her, and another glass when she fell pregnant.
Harry stared at his case and remembered Ginny, her fierce smile on the pitch, the way he’d kissed her, her smell of strawberries and cream and broom polish - the way she looked like her mum.
Oh, fuck.
Draco never knew he’d be so grateful for the opportunity to clean up other people’s messes.
“It’s great!”
“Hermione.”
Love you Dad
It had been like this for two weeks, now. Both of them, dancing around it, and it was too soon and too fast, but it seemed like a universal truth, like there was nothing other than this, this fact, the way they felt about each other.
They were quiet for a moment, the ticking of their kitchen clock - a twin of Molly’s, with hands for them and the kids and Teddy - the only sound in the room.
She looked up at him, narrowed her eyes.
“You wanna get out of here?”
“Tell us how you really feel.”
Harry breathed out a bit of a laugh, then wrapped his fingers around his mug. He stared into the milky-sweet brew, not really knowing what to say - even though he felt he had so much to say, had been holding onto it for years.
“Have you really been thinking that I didn’t love you, you monumental arse?”
“So Ginevra, hmm?”
“I never would have guessed.”
“I wanted to make a potion,” he managed the well-bred Malfoy tone, but his face was pure Black - stubborn, mutinous, with a hint of self-righteousness.
“Well some might suggest that we’re… brothers.”
He shook his head, eyes clearing, finally wrenching his gaze away and towards the flat.
“I like it.”
Scorpius hugged him back, “Yeah, Dad. Love you.”
“Everything alright in there?” He sat on the edge of the bed.
That was the sound Harry made. The heartbreak sound - the voice of everything, shattered. And the sound echoed in his chest, two pains perfectly in tune, this moment on the bench, on Lughnasa, the first harvest before the end of summer.
Harry slapped his arm, “I’m telling you… I want to do something nice. For you.”
“Do shut up, Harry,” he stepped into the tub, pure, milky skin sliding under the water, “And come here.”
He was relieved. He grieved against his will. He was, almost immediately, very wealthy indeed.
He drank half his cocktail at once.
He didn’t expect to speak, but the words came out, and he couldn’t get them back in.
Harry looked - he looked almost as if he were drugged, or drunk as fuck, because he was breathing hard and his eyes were hazy and it seemed like he could pass out at any moment. Draco frowned.
“Well, not that this hasn’t been -” he laughed, half a breath, and ran a perfectly manicured hand through his still platinum hair - “Merlin, yes, this has been awful, good luck with the robes, Potter.”
He dropped the cigarette and ground it into ash on the scarred carpet. And then he met Harry’s eyes - and his grey irises, dark as slate, were colder than they had ever been.
Harry didn’t realize he was smiling until Draco spotted him and pinned him with a look of utter contempt.
“Pansy hates you.”
Scorp blushed, that Malfoy skin showing every emotion, much to his eternal frustration.
Al grabbed his hand, twined their fingers together, “We’re what?”
Harry waved a hand, careless, “They’ll sort themselves out.”
“He loves you. He watches you like he’s never seen anything more -” she shrugged, uncomfortable, “Anything more beautiful. Precious. And you are, Draco,” he looked at his lap, avoiding her kindness, “Don’t forget that, please.
“Be happy. Just be happy. Whatever that means.”
Luxury really was - it wasn’t what he’d been used to. When he’d first seen the heaps of gold in his family’s vault - and then the larger amount in the Black vaults - he’d felt… not excited, not really. It had almost felt like shame. How could he justify it, being wealthy, when he’d survived perfectly well on table scraps, on a lumpy pallet in a cupboard? He wanted more than that, of course, but wealth…. He didn’t feel like he deserved it.
“Should I get you out of them?”
“What?”
“That too.”
“Pans…”
“I missed the train.”
Playlist track: "when the party's over" by Billie Eilish
Ha. He was a muggle. He didn’t know…
Harry laughed, a little bitter, “Yeah?”
“Harder, fuck.”
“Harry Potter,” he shut his eyes, “Could never love me.”
“Please tell me I’m not drinking someone else’s espresso.”
Harry dropped his hand.
But at least he’d had this. This one night.
Harry grit his teeth, “Well -”
The words held more - more conversations they’d need to have, more years to come but in a different pattern, more truths she wasn’t old enough for, yet.
He couldn’t say anything, words and doubts and shame stuck in his chest. She patted his cheek and let him go.
And that time they fucked in the hotel when Harry ordered champagne and
“Like that matters, he’s clearly been influenced by his parents. And let me tell you, his parents…”
“Around the triwizard tournament. Fourth year.”
“But I was willing to try. With you. I thought -”
“You get what you were looking for?”
A spliff and its thick smoke, the way the night blurred around the edges, the way it was impossibly sharp when he wrapped his lips around Draco for the first time, and how Draco fucked his face and he choked and it was exactly right, exactly what he -
Harry wrapped his arm around, taking up Draco’s cock, moving with just the right amount of pressure.
“Ahh, Merlin - what the fuck, Harry -” Draco reached round and held Harry’s hair, “Are you absolutely mad?”
“Potter,” his voice was quiet and still, like the near-scalding surface of the bathwater, “Don’t make promises you can’t keep. Alright?”
Wetness gathered in his eyes, his nose stuffed up, and maybe this is what he’d been scared of, in the coffee shop, and in the flat, and each day that he’d made himself survive, numb, without Draco.
First, Al blushed and tried to push him away. Then Jamie, always in on any action, gave Harry a very conspicuous thumbs up (and a not so friendly laugh). And then everyone at Gryffindor table stood up to watch him, and so did the teachers - including Nev, the recently appointed headmaster - and it was awful.
A bit of complaining, then, about Molly, who was pestering them all about grandchildren, how soon, her hopes for many. Harry had laughed at that bit, and started thinking -
In theory.
A scar, reddened in the heat of the club, and green eyes like apples, and glasses digging into him, and fuck, that mouth, the way it hated him sometimes, and the way he plowed into it -
He nearly whispered, “What, mum?”
“Harry, I have to tell you -”
Harry was late.
“Yeah. Father’s always been open about what he - what happened. Back then.”
“Welcome, Mr. Potter.”
“I’m assuming this is a Potter-shaped breakdown.”
He took a step towards Harry, bristling, and the flat felt like that moment before a lightning strike, ozone and electricity.
Harry pulled out the watch that Molly had given him. He had half an hour before his next portkey.
“What? You - what? How -” and then oh, right, “You’re at Hogwarts.”
He dropped the letter to his desk and shot back his espresso.
“Potter,” the voice was arctic, “Why, exactly, is this... child... calling you ‘lover’?”
“Well, we took the cloak, so nothing could see us.”
A knock at the door. He looked up, a little fuzzy, hot tears in his eyes, and -
And the portraits.
“God, your face.”
“Fuck, fucking Potter,” he picked up something else - a sterling silver candlestick - and threw it, relishing in the clang, “Why did I - how could he - fuck!”
He was fifteen minutes early, which was unusual, but he was also more nervous than he had ever been. The coffee probably wouldn’t help that, but it was an effective prop - see, nothing to watch here, nothing out of the ordinary, just a bloke nearing 40 in the midst of a sexuality crisis (for the second time), quietly drinking coffee and pretending he’s not about to -
He turned around, fast enough to make him dizzy, and reached for his wand.
Without thinking about it, he stood, imagined his destination, and apparated to Malfoy Manor.
“Yeah, well,” Harry cut him off, “I’ve got things - Kingsley wants me for Auror training.”
“You’re going to be alright, Harry. So is Ginny,” Hugo squirmed, and she looked like she might turn away, but then she placed a firm hand on his shoulder, “You did the right thing, after all.”
“Dad,” she whined at his tight hug, elbowing him, “Ugh, don’t be soppy.”
Adderall, the poor college student’s cocaine.
“You thought I’d be alright stumbling along? Marrying Gin? Having three children? When I’m meant to...” he trailed off, shoulders tense.
He looked so well-fucked that Draco wondered just how quickly he could get hard again - and wondered what he’d look like when - if -
Harry, when he said I love you and and
So now, after putting the castle back together, after going through the trials and finishing one last year of school - after fixing up Grimmauld for Andie and Teddy, and after a few sweet kisses with Gin (no real promises exchanged), Harry thought -
“God, I want that.”
It was Harry’s turn to curl up on himself, forearms on knees. He felt the space between them, the space where Draco wasn’t touching him, like an endless chasm.
“So your mum and dad got divorced, right, and your mum is shacked up with Nev and Luna, who is my cousin, sort of.”
When Draco had decided to run the hell away from everything - from the stupid things he’d done, from his mother who always judged him despite her own unforgivable mistakes, from the burden and deep shame of visiting Father in Azkaban, the horrible wrecked manor and the curses he dodged in Diagon Alley - he hadn’t realized that his new life would involve… vermin.
He finally spoke.
Lily, upon hearing the news, got stuck on one crucial detail - “So what you’re saying is that I’m going to have two bedrooms, right?” - and kept quietly whispering to herself, “Two rooms. Two whole rooms…”
Harry was - he would have to admit that he was struggling. He wasn’t really sure who he was supposed to be, anymore. All of the good things about him were tainted by the knowledge that he had been brought up to die. Did he really - could he really say that he existed at all? That he was a real person, with valid desires, worth something more than a pawn in someone else’s plan, destined to be sacrificed?
“True,” he reached down, pulled Scorp more tightly around him, Scorp’s thighs gripping his hips.
Well, he had plenty of time to figure out what he wanted. After a bit of a world tour, and time on his own.
He had no room, anymore, for hate. At least not for muggles, these wonderful, short-lived people he had come to love with all of his heart.
“With Gabbi - and Teddy, who’s your father’s godson.”
“I have no illusions that Harry wasn’t the arsehole in that situation.”
He wrapped his small hand around Harry’s larger, holding it the way he’d done as a little boy.
“Nice, Pans.”
“God,” he put his legs down, interlaced his fingers with hers, closed his eyes, “I wish I didn’t.”
“Nev, Luna’s still natterning on about humdingers or something, could you please come back to bed and shut her up for a while?”
His suitcase was shrunken in his pocket. His agenda was already tossed aside, at least until he could arrange a new portkey. He had stout in his belly. He had no one to answer to, and no where, really, to be.
“Draco, I’m - I’m going home.”
Well, she was right about that.
He dropped his head to Draco’s neck. Tried not to laugh. Started smiling against his skin.
“Even though, in every other way, I wish I had stayed. Because Draco, God, I love you.”
Harry, bless him, actually took the biscuits out of the oven. Pansy hugged Draco very tightly indeed, and whispered a simple but eloquent, “What the fuck?”
He felt this moment - another ending. Maybe the real end, finally.
“For Merlin’s sake, Al.”
If only he could be destroyed so easily. But he just kept on fucking living.
“You just want to order people around.”
“Your mother firecalled.”
His sleepy brain paused, processed, caught up. And he laughed.
“Or you could do something else.”
He was going to kill her.
She reached for his pack of cigarettes, tapped one out and lit it with a snap of her fingers, her own favorite wandless spell.
“Oh, I know that look.”
"Tell me why
“Oh no you fucking don’t,” Draco slammed his hand back over Harry’s, pressing him back against the window, “You’re going to come like this, untouched, just a hole for me to -”
“Eager for the bath, hmm?”
Pulling off, Draco whimpered - and Harry moved his mouth, down, and lifted Draco’s legs over his shoulders.
Playlist track: "World Falls Apart" by Dash Berlin, Jonathan Mendelsohn, Jorn Van Deynhoven.
“Auror training.”
He looked up through the blonde fringe of his eyelashes, then tossed back his platinum hair. Harry flushed.
“I suppose I should be gratified that it’s you having a meltdown in the toilet this time, Potter.”
“Wanted to see? See how low we’ve fallen?”
Playlist track: "Love Ridden" by Fiona Apple.
“I’m here,” and he dropped to his knees like a dramatic madman, the remains of the Ming vase cutting into his skin, “To beg.”
“That’s the thing, Gin,” and that pressure pushed harder, like every part of him was going to break, “I don’t know if I know how.”
“Neville -” Draco blinked in surprise as Albus used Longbottom’s first name, a shocking breach of decorum.
He thought Draco would be comfortable, here.
Draco in the glow of streetlights as they stumbled up the hill - Draco, as he pushed him against a stone wall and thrust their hips together - Draco, and the way he took off his clothes, practiced and perfect and unaccountably nervous -
“Er, yes.”
"And these children that you spit on
“Oh.”
And on that Friday night, when he danced with this man - so stunning, so damaged, just as hungry and broken as he was - Draco leaned over and said -
Is when I fall in love with you."
“I can’t wait to have you in me, splitting me open, fuck, I’m going to ride you until you can’t remember your name, ‘til the only thing you can remember is -”
Draco smiled at him, a secret smile, “I suppose,” and he kissed him.
“I have no opinion on cat.”
“I guess -” she looked sad, just a little, and then relieved, like everything finally clicked into place, “I guess we haven’t really been married for a long time.”
It was the barista, of course. He was leaning one hip against the wall, zipper at Harry’s eye level when he picked his head up off the table. Harry stared up at him - a cheeky grin at the corner of his thin lips, all his body language saying, “take me home, will you?”
Harry
“I didn’t lie.”
“This is who we are.”
He froze. Stared.
Harry’s mouth dropped open, “No.”
“Er,” he walked to the panel, pushed what he hoped was the proper button, “Hi.”
“What, love?”
Midnight in Cork, in the summertime, getting down to the last three cigarettes in the pack, good craic with the DJ between sets, passing a joint around, and if Harry seemed - if he felt just slightly different - they were just drunk and high and dehydrated and -
Both boys were still competitive, facing off on the quidditch pitch, and they hurled insults, and banged about - but after a vicious snowball fight in third year they dropped to the ground, exhausted, and broke out into giggles. Draco held out his hand, smiling. Harry took it.
“Er, Parkinson?”
“Mmhmm,” then he heard a smirk in her voice, “He a good fuck?”
“If Astoria has one flaw, at least from my perspective, it is that she is a woman.”
“Back here!” Ron called from the kitchen.
Or she would have poisoned the biscuits. Which didn’t sound like the worst course of action, at the moment.
The timer on the oven dinged. Harry jumped.
No one can lift the damn thing
Harry stood in the doorway, absolutely awkward and out of place, but he - he didn’t notice the mess, any of it, and didn’t even glance at Pansy or her French lace stockings with frilly suspenders - he was just staring at Draco with such naked intensity that - fuck, maybe she was right.
“Malfoy?”
The portkey started to glow.
Long, thin scars traveled from the dip of his right hip to the inner edge of his left clavicle. They’d long since healed, but Harry could tell that the scars would never go away. Draco would bear Harry’s mark as long as he bore the other on his arm.
“Thank you,” Harry’s face looking down at him was so beautiful, so serious… “Thank you for coming back for me.”
She just wanted a family with Harry. And he’d wanted one with her.
“And are you supposed to be giving your soon to be ex-wife dating advice?”
And then his eyes widened as he took in Harry’s fitted shirt, trousers with the top button already undone.
“What do you want, Potter?”
I love it when you read to me
Please, please, Draco. Just forget about him. Forget.
“Leave them,” he said, commanding, when Thom tried to remove his glasses.
Harry lifted his own hand, twined it with Draco’s right, slick with lube and precome, and he was deadly serious.
His face was vicious. Fuck, this hurt.
“It’s almost funny, your selfishness. Your willingness to curse others - including Ginevra, by the way - with misery. All because poor little Potter never got a proper hug.”
“Fuck, Draco -”
Playlist track: "Ain't No Sunshine" by Bill Withers.
“I told you,” Draco nudged Harry, after Jamie’s music had been muted, “Living in luxury is the only way to live.”
“I’m pleased,” he gave her a soft smile, “Really.”
He stubbed out his cigarette, waited five seconds, lit another.
And all of that had sounded really, really good.
“Do you think we want you to be equally at risk?” He almost yelled.
He knelt, unbuttoning Draco’s jeans, inching the zipper down, dragging his fingers over his wiry thighs. He rubbed his face along Draco’s prick - already very interested, fuck yes - and breathed in his scent.
So he’d known about Potter’s invisibility cloak, then.
The letter from Gin was still crumpled up under their bed, less than a week after he’d gotten it, but Harry didn’t need to read it again to remember -
“And I love you too, you horrible motherfucker.”
She took a sip.
“I -” fuck, he looked shattered.
“Oh, yes,” he kissed the top of her head, “I suppose you must be right.”
Setting fire to our insides for fun
But, at the moment, as he stared into the back seat of his magically upgraded VW Golf GTI and saw Al’s Hogwarts robes, he thought, fuck, that kid’s just as oblivious as I am.
The words burst forth. It was easy. He’d been holding on for so long.
Nobody needed to know.
The club was busy for a Wednesday. He’d wasted no time getting to the centre of the dance floor, and he let his body move, almost mindlessly, to the bass which seemed to echo in his chest. He felt eyes on him from every direction, and he let himself experience fear and rage against it, reveling in the danger of possibilities. A pain he could control. A pain he inflicted on himself.
She was still Harry’s little girl.
But great mother goddess above, now that he could live a life of luxury, he would do it to the hilt.
Long, silken hair, silvery against green sheets. The face he always made, right before he opened his eyes, like he could murder Harry for waking him up. The stretch of pale skin, and the obscene sounds he made as he smelled that first cup of coffee. Starting in on the crossword and tossing it aside and reaching down, down, under the covers, and wrapping his hand around -
It was romantic. He tried not to imagine himself spread out on the soft velvet of the couch, firelight warming his naked skin, and failed.
“Scorpius,” Scorp sat up, Al gazing at him and grabbing his hand, “I don’t want that to change, either.”
“Really?” His eyes were wide.
“Just fucking touch me.”
He was energetic, cheerful - now that Colin had him doing more work around the club, bookkeeping and advertising and any odds and ends he was up for, he’d started coming home with a little more excitement. He liked his work, and he was good at it, and he was getting recognized, which Harry had realised, at some point, was new for him.
“Mmm.”
But it was going to change, of course it was, because he wouldn’t always be here to read “Babbity Rabbity” to Lil, and Gin wouldn’t be at the new flat to make sure Al and Jamie brushed their hair.
It was golden like Tokay, and bitter like anise, and he kept kissing Harry, pulling out these little ugly sounds - and it was so fucking incredible, and he wondered, deleriously, why he hadn’t been doing this his whole damned life.
He was cursed, that must have been it, to deal with idiot Gryffindors for the rest of his life.
Harry nodded his goodbye, watching Scorpius walk away with a bag full of books and a head full of music and he thought about another boy, and what his life should have been, and wouldn’t it have been better, you know, if he’d shaken his stupid hand.
Shot number four. Britt gasped at the toxic combination, then reached up and pulled him into a sloppy kiss.
He scrunched up his face, “I’m a little old for that, Malfoy. Half those kids don’t know who I am.”
“What d’you mean?”
He rolled his tense shoulders.
“‘Course he will.”
“It was - perfectly acceptable when you used my given name,” he waved his hand, “Feel free to do so.”
“Eh,” he breathed out, smoke curling through the air, “Yeah. But that wasn’t rebellion. Just the thing you do.”
And his voice was cool and so fucking calm when he said, “Oh?”
Harry sat back onto the bed, looked at his hands.
Harry took another drag.
“‘Course, Lil.”
He shut his mouth and looked a bit like he’d swallowed a toad. It was a terrible face, and it made something in Harry’s chest melt.
“Have you ever - I mean has anyone else -”
“Ah well, you don’t need to play coy with me, but I’ll leave you your secrets,” and he winked, “But there’s something in you, Har, that’s calling out - for your other half, or for adventure, or maybe just to forget.”
“What are you doing, Potter?”
“Of course,” he mumbled, but he was distracted by some kind of crashing noise coming from the back of the house.
“Yes. You will owl me.”
“And James, your brother, is living in sin -”
You can’t make someone into your happily ever after. Even if you love them - simply, quietly, completely. A part of you will always know.
(See the end of the chapter for
They’d invited him over, yesterday, as they’d waved the kids off. He’d agreed, missing them terribly, but then…
“And my wand never felt the same, after,” he waved his hand around, “Whatever.”
“I think you’ll find that it’s your father that talks dirty to the espresso machine.”
He was looking at me, i was looking at you
“It does make fantastic coffee.”
He picked up one of Hugo’s crayons - green, with paper peeling away - and clutched it in his fingers.
“The way - the way you are together. That thing you have, where you love each other even when you annoy the sh-,” he looked down at Hugo, wide eyes staring back, “When you argue. It’s always been - you’re meant to be. And I wanted that.”
“What?”
Harry frowned.
Ron’s face was honest and open, as it always had been. Harry took a breath and kept going.
Liam at the bar was making some layered concoction of grenadine, blue curacao, and goldschlager, and he could feel the alcohol starting to course through him, and he felt at his back pocket for his crumpled pack of Marlboro lights. Wednesday night, trad about to start, and he hoped he’d be just drunk enough to shake off the memories of last night.
Just him. Just Harry.
“Harry,
And you
For a moment, his mind was entirely blank. And then he remembered the wand in his hand.
It was cold in the manor, too cold, and he remembered what it was like, back then, when the snake was in every corner, gnawed and regurgitated human bones stacked in the cellar, his father pitiful and cowed, hair turned to straw. The constant, unending fear permeating the air like a foul perfume.
“I’m sure you would. But trust me,” he met the barista’s eyes, “He’s not worth it.”
“Don’t know really,” he slipped in two fingers, thrusting back and forth, “Both, probably. God, you’re beautiful.”
His voice was too loud, rough. Harry had meant - he didn’t know what he'd meant. Here, in Cork? In what seemed to be a gay bar? In the toilets, with him?
And Harry pressed in.
A head with messy black hair appeared - and another flashback, that totally mortifying snowball fight - and he saw glittering green eyes which did not, at all, convey remorse. He balled up the cloak in his hands and fidgeted.
Just sex, then.
“You said it yourself, mate,” Ron shrugged again, frowned, “I know you really do love her. Goddess knows you’re a great dad. I thought it would be enough, even if…”
He started writing to Pansy again, and Blaise, and Greg. Pans was always complaining about Blaise; Blaise was always raving about Pans. It came as no surprise, whatsoever, to get a gushing - and far too detailed - review of Blaise’s performance in bed. And when Greg decided to get the hell out of England, where people spat on him in the street, Draco gave him some advice on how to manage his money, and it was like - like the old days, but so much better.
“‘Course.”
Prude, ha.
Harry flushed, scalding and sick.
She looked up at him from her perch on the end of the bed. He had a feeling that the question wasn’t exactly what - she wanted to ask something else.
And he had never, not for one moment - not when she kissed him before he left for work, not when they placed Jamie in his bassinet, not when they celebrated Christmas with all the Weasleys, not even when he watched her fly with her red hair burning up the blue sky - felt that way about Ginny.
Rainy days and it was “Bring Me the Disco King” and he thought about taking a knife to the inside of his arm. When the flat was freezing with cold in a wet way which felt like falling into the sea, he played “My Death,” which was Jacques Brel, but Bowie lived and died it. And “The Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud” was what he played when he first took another man into himself and wanted to scream out to his father and his past and those bitter green eyes.
Everybody loved the silencing charms that summer.
“Inscrutable?”
“Take one hand off the glass. Pull your trousers down,” Harry moved at once, “Slowly, Potter.”
“Fuck, Harry.”
“What do you mean?”
“Sure,” he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small plastic bag, “You want?”
The flavor - peat, smoke, herbs - was full of intensity, at first, because as he sipped it his mind was taken over by that night. Harry’s smell, Harry’s taste. Records playing. A soft rain. But as the years progressed, the whiskey started to taste like his life, now, with all the bitterness and numbness. He measured out his life in glasses of whiskey, and Harry’s life, too, and by now the flavor was dry as ash.
He felt a laugh at the back of his throat and pushed his glasses back up his nose, shrugging in Ron’s direction. Ron, of course, shrugged back and picked up the last biscuit from the tea tray.
Harry tried not to think about that at all.
And then he caught Harry’s eyes, and grinned.
Something he had felt when he had stared at Malfoy’s dot on the Marauder’s Map, something that had made him throw the map down and shove his hand under the covers and bite his own left knuckles and -
“I loved you when our lives were horrible and bitter and violent, and I loved you when they were beautiful and messy and wild. And God, I’m so proud of you for the life you’ve made now.
“Go on, my shift’s about over. How’d you feel about a pint?”
“I think perhaps I should take my leave,” he stood quickly, needing to be anywhere but here, with Longbottom - who truly appeared like he wished Nagini had gotten him instead - and his ex-lover’s ex-wife in her scandalous bedwear.
Harry walked around in a daze, after that kiss, and Draco rolled his eyes at him, terribly pleased and trying to hide it, and he instructed Harry, “Get it together, Potter, and book us a hotel somewhere.”
“Just the thing you do,” Draco’s mouth dropped open, “Sure.”
His heart seemed to stop, and he growled, “You think so?”
“Harry,” he was smiling and smiling.
Draco leaned forward, Harry curled around him, holding on too tightly, both leaving bruises. Harry’s prick was swollen, rubbing against Draco’s stomach, and Draco was just thrusting home, over and over, and he kissed him like it was air and they were drowning, and -
Draco stopped off for a coffee with too much cream - the only form of calories he could consume this early - and noticed a bit of movement behind him, the feeling of interested eyes on the back of his neck. He gave a saucy smile to his favorite barista and turned - but he just saw the door to the cafe swing shut.
“Oh sure, you’re thinking, a year off, that’ll do the job,” and Aengus took a healthy swallow of stout, “But I’ll bet you have a plan for this year. Everything decided. Your planes, your hostels, down to when you’ll wash your pants, am I right?”
When Harry and Draco thought about this undiscovered path, they couldn’t be sure, really, if they would have run away - if they would have shared that tiny apartment in Cork, or had a scalding hot bath in a fancy hotel, or fucked with such frenzy against the wall of a nightclub. Draco wondered if he would have learned the value of plain, hard work, scrubbing floors and counting the till. And Harry thought that maybe he wouldn’t have his three children - four, now, counting Scorpius - whom he loved so completely. Both of them longed so hungrily for a better past, a history which didn’t hurt so damned much, and Draco dreamed about a life without the mark on his arm and the heavy press of his father’s hand; Harry craved parents who cared.
The driver leaned his head out of the window and gave Harry a penetrating stare.
And he let Scorpius play with the hunting crups and nurse the runt of the litter by hand -
“I should have been braver, Draco. So you will have to do better than I did.”
Draco moaned, clutching at Harry’s hair, “Absolutely - ah, fuck - glad you agree.”
The air was entirely still. A heavy bass thrummed around them. The lights flickered, graffiti shining on the walls.
Silently.
Not the last.
Was it really enough? Enough to make a life out of?
Whisper you're the one to fix it too
He’d just unlocked the door to his hotel room. Draco stepped in, took one look around, and whirled on Harry.
“No, I, er. I ordered it. For you.”
Harry wiped his hands, already sweating, on his trousers, as he stepped through the door. Long, crammed bookshelves lined the hall, and on the opposite wall were family portraits and candid snapshots - Rosie as a baby, and then flying her first training broom (and falling off). Molly and Arthur captured in a rare moment of romance, kissing in the back garden of the Burrow. Hugo on chubby legs chasing Crookshanks, who seemed to be practically immortal. Harry and Ginny and their kids. George, Angelina.
But somehow, that wasn’t what he was in the mood for tonight.
“Go on.”
Draco was so beautiful when he was accidentally unattractive.
“Did you,” he spread out his hands, “I don’t know, think about telling me?”
Parkinson, whom he’d spotted having too many cocktails with Blaise Zabini, and the few words he’d overheard the last time he was in the Three Broomsticks.
“Anyway,” he dragged his hands down Al’s back, cupping his arse, “Sometimes I think our dads just, like, rained down weirdness on everyone. They are terminally weird.”
He wanted - he wanted to memorize all of him, all of this skin like new ivory, all his little sounds and sighs. He licked the juncture between his legs, sucking on the soft skin, the fine seam between his bollocks; he swallowed around his prick, rapidly filling, taking him in as far as he could. Weeks and weeks of this - he knew Draco’s body, knew that he could fit him down the back of his throat, nose pressed into curled golden hair.
“Fuck!”
“Oh, Harry.”
“I loved you when you ate too many sweets in the great hall when no one else was looking. I loved you when you took off your shirt and showed me your scars, the scars I made, and I loved you when I made them.
Though knowing the nonsense that Scorpius could get up to, he probably should have.
He felt the autumn chill against his palms.
She laughed.
“And you’re fucking gorgeous.”
“Why did you?” Harry’s voice was suddenly just as hard, like ice. He had to know if there was any -
“And we’re -”
Hermione’s voice was quiet, “You wanted a home.”
“What’s really bothering you?”
Fuck.
Malfoy scoffed.
Held him.
“Boys,” Longbottom’s reprove was quiet, “We had to dangerous things, back then, so you wouldn’t have to.”
And on many of those days, he didn’t think about Harry, really.
“Father wouldn’t -”
He fiddled with the short stem of his glass, knowing that something unpleasant was coming, as it usually did.
They were friends. It was - it was good.
Harry studied her face, a face he truly loved, a face he had seen in happiness and in sorrow. More freckles, and the gentle lines of laughing, and that worry line, right between her eyebrows, which he thought was new.
“No?”
They were perfectly in tune, knowing each movement of their bodies, knowing the ways they fit. He held onto the thick muscles of Harry’s arse - fuck, he was hot - and rubbed his full cock along Harry’s, just cheap fabric and sweat between them.
“I don’t know. I don’t know if it would do any good, now.”
“Potter,” Malfoy rolled his eyes and sighed, “Is there a reason that you are holding a set of first year’s robes?”
The sound of the record player, skipping, and an old LP, David Bowie’s “Low.”
“I’m not sorry,” a bit of a sneer.
“So go on, use Ginevra up until she hates you, just like your fucking muggle relatives did. Just don’t ever, ever come crawling back to me to make you feel better about your miserable life.”
“Still gagging for it, aren’t you, Potter?” He slicked his fingers, ran them down the tender skin, held them, still, over his rim, “Tell me, how often did you close your eyes, fucking your perfect wife, and think of me?”
“Fuck.”
“No?”
“Horrid nickname, I don’t know why -”
“Well,” he lingered on the word, drawing it out, “I needed to get an ingredient from the Forbidden Forest.”
“Hmm.”
Draco wound his hands through Harry’s hair and pulled, tilting his face up.
“Malfoy’s don’t divorce.”
“Good job. But - I hope you don’t mind me saying so - you look like a man needs a new start in life. To do something a little unexpected.”
It was still early, barely anyone passing him on the pavement. He stuck his hands in his pockets and felt his shrunken suitcase, and realized that if he didn’t want to sleep rough - in an unfamiliar city, no less - he’d have to find someplace to stay.
Dark - nearly black - hardwood floors stretched out in a large room that was floor to ceiling windows, looking out over the London skyline. The space was completely open, with a large kitchen in a minimalist style taking up the left side. An island, ice-white marble with sleek black cabinets, had room for four barstools.
“You -” Draco’s eyes were wide, “What am I… Potter, this is… Oh honestly,” then he rolled his eyes, “Curse me, or don’t. Just figure out what to do with your wand.”
One horrible conversation done with, he thought.
Music slammed into him with an almost physical force. It was dark, that darkness pierced by flashes of colored lights reflecting on shimmering bodies coated in soft glitter. The dance floor was packed, people writhing against each other, and it was three deep at the bar.
Both boys did look chastened - but Draco had a sense that this wouldn’t be the last late night firecall in their seven years of schooling.
“Oh,” Draco turned pink, then made a haughty face, “As you should.”
He looked around the flat, taking in all the details - the patch of damp plaster in the corner that never seemed to dry, the pokey little bathroom with the cracked mirror, the kitchenette stocked with his favorite tea. The record player, the stack of LPs. The blue cotton sheets, serviceable, almost soft enough. The little tin of pomade, down to the last few drops.
If your world falls apart
Playlist track: "I Would Be Your Slave" by David Bowie.
Bowie’s “Rock 'n' Roll With Me” came on. One more shove from behind, and Draco’s thigh was between Harry’s legs, and Harry’s head fell back against the brick, and somehow all of that emptiness, all of the horror, all of the burdens, all of the dead - they were nothing. It was just a mizzling rain and golden light and the muscle of Draco’s thigh and the realization that yes, this. This man. This place.
“That’s brilliant! But - unopened? Why?”
“Why now?”
He barely looked at the wall - the gateway to the platform - because all he could think about was the softness of his wife’s, his soon to be ex-wife’s, cheek, and how that softness stopped being enough, somehow, and how was this going to work, and what would the kids do, and fuck, he probably totally missed the train. And he kept running through the wall, right into the back of another parent.
“You’ve had this room the whole time?”
It was by its very nature a magical time, one of those in-between times, the wheel of the year turning, the first harvest, the invitation. And he’d been sitting there, smoking as usual, with Harry there next to him, and the river running, and he’d been thinking about the lessons he’d been taught, and Harry put his arm around him, a bit.
“Just scan in, you’re still keyed in to the wards.”
“No?” he started laughing, acidic, eating away at the unnaturally stagnant air of the study.
A year and a day later, Draco packed his case, turned off the lights in his apartment, left the keys with Cathal.
“Yeah, even if.”
Harry grabbed his hips and flipped them over, shoving Draco’s knees up, pushing against him, “So what?”
“I -”
He was going to throttle Albus.
And packed with books.
“Well,” he looked down, “What I think -” he paused, just a moment too long.
Harry stood, picked up his case, crossed to the door, and closed his eyes in shame when he heard a broken voice behind him.
Ginny was still in the fireplace, cripes, sounding rather too amused.
Disappointed. She always looked disappointed in him.
“Fuck off.”
Was. Er. Whatever.
“While I do not doubt that all of your family is as much of a disaster as you are,” he came over, pulled out a barstool, perched on it ram-rod straight, “I am referring, of course, to your Slytherin progeny.”
He nearly groaned in frustration, setting his glass down on a small table.
Harry was gone. An irrefutable fact. A truth.
“Naughty,” Draco shifted behind him, picking up the glasses of chilled champagne he’d placed on the sink, “Here, lo-,” he cleared his throat, “Harry.”
“I loved you when you made that paper crane, you remember, that stupid bird, and sent it flying to me in third year. I loved you when I was running and hunting and I saw you in my horrible visions, torturing other death eaters, with fear and horror on your face.
“Do you wanna have kids, d’you think?”
They're quite aware of what they're goin' through"
Oh, I believe love will follow you"
“Little help here, Potter.”
Draco pulled back. As delicious as that sounded, it suddenly didn’t seem like it was enough.
He looked up at Ron, still tall even sitting at the table. There was a roughness to his voice, but also an understanding. And it was difficult, jumping right into this conversation, but they had been friends for so long that it flowed out of him.
“I will never chase after you. I will never seek you out. If you want my time, you will work for it.”
He lowered the zip, pushed the jeans down, glad he’d adequately conveyed to Harry that pants were a waste of time. He smelled so good, like dancing, like flying, like something both ancient and brand new.
“I think I remember that you stood up to the Dark Lord.”
“I’ll tell you what. You think about that. What you want.”
He wished he could hold on to her, on to this dream of what his life should have been.
“Don’t I know it.”
“Please, Draco, I’ll do anything, whatever you want, God, I’ve missed you, fuck -”
“Come on, Dad,” he pulled him around, so gentle, “Time for lunch.”
He clenched his hands, his teeth, leaned his head back against the pillar.
“Maybe you lied like that to make me feel better, I don’t know, or because you felt sorry for me. But,” his voice was so small, “It was a really fucking shitty thing to do.”
He pulled the lapels of his jacket up around his ears and began the walk down into the city centre. His flat was up the hill above the university, and it was a nice twenty minutes or so to his job.
And Harry fucking Potter ducked around the corner.
“Yes. You always preferred to keep me your dirty little secret.”
(Oh, and I’ve gotten an owl from Albus in which he emphatically expresses to me that your son is magic’s gift to wizardkind. You should probably get coffee with me if only to prepare for future playdates.)”
Miles away, up in Brú na Bóinne, a man both young and old fished in the river - a basket of glimmering trout next to him, Caer waiting at home, pressing golden and silver apples into cider, as she had done for thousands of years.
“What are you laughing about, Potter?”
He took a deep breath before opening the door to the bar - Malfoy’s bar.
“Sure you’ll never find that with a plan. You just need to go.”
Draco crossed his left leg over his right, angling towards Harry.
"When I give my heart it will be completely
Malfoy stood there, calm, leaning against the wall. Hands in his pockets. No wand.
You had a way so familiar i could not recognize
A squeak and widened eyes from Longbottom. Interesting.
“Oi!” Harry walked around him to the couch, and Draco swiveled on his barstool.
Scorpius fiddled with the sleeves of his robes. He muttered something inaudible.
“You should know, I’m saying this entirely against my better judgment.”
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Draco squinted up at him, his refined features going all pointy, like they had been when he was a little boy.
“What?” Harry blinked.
Make me everything you want
"But nothin' is better sometimes
He couldn’t really be angry. Not at them, at least.
“Oh my God, Al, really,” he made his scandalized face, then smiled, kissed him, “You’re awful.”
Draco rolled his eyes, took a sip, looked away.
Harry paused, fingers sifting through silky strands of hair, “What?”
Ron turned round, sat, and waited. Harry shrugged and looked away.
“More.”
“Well, we were friends, Ronald.”
It would have to be good enough.
“Oh,” Draco pinked up around the edges, “Thanks.”
“I was wrong,” Harry let his legs widen, his knee just a centimetre closer, and felt Draco radiating heat, anger, and deep hurt. Hurt that he had caused.
Draco was that moment in the Wizard of Oz, you know, when she steps out into a new world of too-saturated pigments, the miasma of flowers and red glitter and golden bricks. When Harry had watched that film through the crack in his cupboard door, he’d almost been sick from the transition - black and white was so much closer to his life, the way it had always been, and little Harry had wondered in that moment if he would ever truly see in color.
“Gin -”
“Bit of a tour, then?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He had learned not to be nasty, at least out loud. But here in his home, with his father snoring away behind black curtains, he felt a twisted satisfaction that he had been correct, after all.
But as he took in the huge walk-in wardrobe, he remembered why she was such a good friend.
“‘S’all right,” he took a big pull on his bottle, “Reckon you have a right to be, every once in a while.”
“Harry had some!”
In the hotel room, Draco fell back onto the plush mattress, feet still on the floor, closing his eyes and stretching. Harry stood between his legs, pulled off his jumper.
“So pushy.”
He did wonder, as he ripped off his clothes and gasped his way into the hot water, why he felt the way he did, all light and fluttery, when the bloke he was so busy fucking told him to shut up.
“Of course you did. You left.”
“Doesn’t do a lot of good, now.”
He laughed, still bitter in the deepest parts of him, “Why? Why thank you?”
Making his way towards the staircase, he heard Pansy’s voice - the dangerous voice. He froze.
“I was so wrong, to leave you.”
But there, in the beautiful apartment secured by the galleons which were his parents' and Sirius's legacy - there, wrapped up in a new kind of forever, Draco resting in Harry’s arms, finally uninjured - they loved each other with all of that history and the sorrow and the ecstasy borne of choices they’d had to make. They were happy, finally, and they didn’t take it for granted.
“Indeed.”
Harry knew there was no safe. So he’d find a new kind of danger, just in being by himself. No one to answer to. No closeness, no responsibilities.
“Oh you are thick.”
“And what was your role in these... unseemly proceedings?”
Exactly how he liked to wake up. Christ.
He licked his lips, feeling gold leaf under his tongue, and he thought about tight jeans and a thick cock and the look on his face, pained and desperate and hungry, and the way his mouth watered, and the brief moment when he’d considered unzipping those trousers, and -
“Sugar does not belong in coffee,” despite the complaints, he drained his drink, “I take two shots of espresso, Potter -” he grimaced and corrected himself as Harry nudged his leg, “Harry. With cream. Get it right tomorrow.”
“Beg!” he lit another cigarette - God, how could he still smoke like this - and offered one to Harry, “Sweet Merlin’s knickers, what the fuck.”
He had to go. That’s what he told himself, anyway.
Every single cell in his body longed, desperately.
Let's just let it go
A trad band in the corner was tuning up their instruments. Aengus ordered a couple of pints of Guinness, and Harry watched as the bartender poured them, slow and careful.
“You bastard, you fucking -” Draco’s movements stuttered, shuddering, and he came with this sound like - like -
Just like her mum. Harry remembered the first time he’d made her laugh so hard that she’d gotten the hiccups, and kept hiccupping for hours.
“Sorry, you’re not exactly my type,” he’d shouted in an upturned ear.
“Alright?”
Unchained, Draco held out his arm for his mother to lean on. They left the courtroom, slow and steady and somehow unobtrusive, and that made Harry’s stomach twist as if he were going to vomit.
Draco. Ireland. Yes, Blaise, really. Cork.
“Yes, well… Your owl was - unexpected,” he took another sip, then set the cup down, “And irritatingly vague.”
He kept it there for some time.
He was offering - Harry didn’t really know. He didn’t know what to hope for. Except - he’d never felt like this, like everything inside of him was balanced on the edge of a cliff, like he was in that farmhouse, careening in a tornado towards unknown ground. He’d faced too many horrors, but they’d always been something that other people chose, other people forced on him. And he’d done what he was supposed to do, what he was raised for, and he was glad of it, but this -
“Hey, Thom,” Draco smiled without warmth, “Mine?”
“Mm?” Draco hummed, eyes closed.
He sent him to his end. Together they created their beginnings.
It made sense, right? To have it. For guests, and such.
“What you asked me, in Cork. Ask me again.”
Kingsley - “We’re doing the best that we can, Harry,” - and maybe, maybe he should help. He should, because that was what he was good at, wasn’t it?
Harry had the sudden and utterly mortifying urge to laugh.
“Oh holy fuck, Harry -”
Maybe, if he was lucky, it hadn’t been the biggest mistake of his life. Maybe he’d get to keep the memory.
“Worried? Harry, I’ve been going spare. Not,” he must have made a horrible grimace, “Because of us, but yeah, because of the kids. But… you should have seen Al, last night. He was -”
He sort of wanted to laugh.
He’d had so few moments to notice beauty. Everything was still, crystallized in the hour before waking. The grass of the quad was perfectly manicured, soft and trimmed and so green.
“Well, then. Not like I did it for you, but,” she gave him a dirty look, and then a fond one, “Anyway. That’s not why I firecalled.”
That was… not how he intended to start. Draco’s mouth gaped open.
Draco had a visceral flash of a long-blurred memory - detention in the forest, and the dark figure, and silvery blood spilled on rotting leaves.
9:30 and the sun was just beginning to set. Art’s was packed with American exchange students, and Draco was going shot for shot with a short, curvaceous girl with a Long Island accent. She was covered with tattoos, and he’d pretended not to be bothered when she reached out and touched his mark.
“Hi, love,” he brushed a kiss on Harry’s cheek, which burned like a brand, “How was your -”
“So?” It was almost a growl.
And they loved their children as they should have been loved.
He leered, “Might have something to do with the way I -”
“You!” she barked and jabbed at his chest, “Testicles!”
Harry still looked… uncomfortable.
Harry spread out, legs open, nudging his knee against Draco’s foot, “That’s my ex-wife you’re talking about.”
And lubing up his fingers, pushing them in to impossibly tight heat, watching Draco throw his head back onto his lumpy pillows, finding that spot that made him shiver and cry out and clutch at his hand and demand in that Malfoy tone, “Get in me, Merlin fuck, Harry, just -”
Harry didn’t know if he wanted to laugh or cry, and did some weird combination of both, which earned him a very strange look from Scorpius. Not dissimilar from the toad look - but more like it had been Harry eating the toad, and Scorp was just too polite to mention it.
Malfoy had looked - ill.
She met his eyes.
Harry latched onto his collarbone and groaned and shook, and Draco followed him over, pushing into that rough hand twice more before he came.
When he ran away from everything - from England, from his family, from green eyes and guilt and casual schoolboy violence - he ran far. He got his first shitty apartment in Cork, Ireland, and he tried to live on the razor edge of a knife, in the dangerous dance of his own self-destruction. He had a dodgy upstairs neighbor, Cathal, and windows which didn’t shut all the way, and the water wasn’t ever quite warm enough, but it was - it was his.
“What, Potter?”
Another lonely day
It was a good dinner. It tasted like dust.
Quite a bit of text scribbled out there. Draco felt his shoulders inching towards his ears. He closed his eyes, breathed out, and skipped down to what was legible.
“Impressed?”
“Mmm…” Scorpius stretched out, quiet for a moment.
“Ex-wife -”
He lit up a cigarette, took a shot straight from the bottle.
“As you have cause to know.”
“You sure?” Harry walked close to Draco on the pavement, stumbling only a little.
And Scorpius was pink and blonde and chubby and so fucking cheerful and oh, how he loved him -
“And you will, I’m getting you a good deal, by the way. But you know exactly what I mean.”
Draco walked over to the bed, kneeling on the edge, swinging one leg over to straddle him. He grabbed both of his hands and pinned them over his head, then twisted his hips, grinding down.
“Not that I’m complaining,” he ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, a disaster as always, “But what was that?”
He smiled across the table at her, and she smiled back.
James plastered his room with posters of musicians and athletes, muggle and magical, and Harry and Draco switched on the built-in silencing charms after the first night of too-loud rapping at arse o’clock on a Tuesday.
“Marry me.”
“Yeah.”
Draco caught his reflection in the mirror, with the blurred images of dark hair and glasses behind him, and he thought, fuck, I had Harry Potter, here against the sinks, and he had me on my knees for him, and he went home to Ginevra and respectability and he was so far away - away from -
“I just wanted to say… I don’t want you to think I hate you, or anything,” her lips puckered like she was sucking a lemon.
“You shall not. I am highly proficient at the telephone.”
“Okay,” he put his head in his hands, then looked up at her, “I love you, you know.”
Blood. Tradition. Faith.
She rolled her eyes in that very distinctive Pansy moue of distaste and then continued in her descent down the staircase.
Oof, Harry, steady on.
The reaction was fast and unmistakable. Draco’s face went white, and his hands clutched his cup. He didn’t move.
Draco was maybe a little lonely, but he didn’t bring people home, anymore.
“Well, with a name like Scorpius -”
“Well, I guess we should have seen that coming,” Draco tried not to laugh as Harry, bright red, flopped onto their pillow-top mattress and groaned into his hands.
Nothing could ever excuse that pain, nothing could justify it, and there was no “but” at the end of that sentence. They had been children and they had been wronged. They were the amalgamation, the culmination of all of those things, the hurtful things; could there ever be any justification? Any prize which made that all worth it?
“I just - I got an owl, and it made me - I feel a bit homesick, and -”
“Er.”
“I know you’re not happy with me, mum.”
“Thanks, ‘Mione.”
Draco got very still.
Draco appeared unmoved - clothes perfect and the Malfoy mask in place.
Playlist track: "Changes" by David Bowie.
“Oh yes. Everybody’s a little bit queer, it turns out. Who would have guessed?”
Longbottom colored. Utter silence in the room, other than a disgusted grumble from Sev’s portrait and the sound of a fine mist falling over the many plants.
Harry wished he had already shrunken his case.
“Alright,” he looked at Draco’s profile as he stared into the fire, an uneven flush on his cheeks, “I love you very much, you know.”
“We’re still young. Young enough.”
“Potter.”
“I’ll have to check my schedule.”
He laughed and let go - her elbows were actually quite sharp - holding his hands up in a gesture of defeat.
He didn’t know what to do with himself, palms sweating, feet icy.
“You always make me feel so much better about myself.”
“What are you thinking about?”
“Fuck no,” he leaned back against the stoop, looking up at the fading darkness, “What would I have to pass on? No.”
“Beg. I’m here to -”
“I heard that, Ronald.”
"When you rock and roll with me
He closed his eyes against the bitterness of Draco’s voice.
“I would be more than delighted to kill him for you,” she did not sound like she was joking, “And I represent some great properties, you know - places to hide the body.”
I made it! Of course, I wasn’t really worried, family tradition and all that.
He rubbed the back of his neck. God, this was all so awkward. Ginny must have seen the tension, and her next comment was either friendly or a vicious barb.
"Walk into a smoke filled room
Could he really think that Al didn’t - that he would ever let him go?
Something that screamed, yes, I have killed. And I would do it again.
He made something of himself, not as a Malfoy, but as him - Draco. He caught, every once in a while, a strange, solemn look on Mother’s face, and he figured he had better start planning for an heir of his own.
“You what?”
“Draco, he left his wife. And if he’s finally admitted - not before time, the halfwit - that he wants to make his life with you in it, and you…”
“Teenagers are lovely, aren’t they?” Ginny’s voice was as dry as the antarctic. Harry laughed through his nose.
He should have known.
And it was.
“It suits you more than it does me, really. But I like it,” quietly, “Just the way I like y-”
“Name’s Aengus, by the way. And you?”
He pulled on a pair of jeans, a fresh shirt, a hooded jacket, and stopped by the cafe he’d seen on his first morning here. He wandered up the hill to the University College Cork campus, smelling the river, watching blackbirds take flight.
Al snorted and muttered, “So dramatic, really, I bet you got that from gran ‘Cissa -”
Harry turned away, and after all, that’s what Ginny had said he always did. He jogged back into the station with the robes clutched tightly in his right hand, dodging commuters who looked at him with all of the grumpiness of Londoners without their second cups of tea.
“I noticed Malfoy at the platform.”
“Or a closet, for that matter.”
And Potter wrapped his firm fingers around them, clasping his hand with Draco’s -
“You are the biggest idiot in the world,” Draco looked pretty offended, then froze, “I’m going to look in the bathroom!”
“Harry,” Harry’s breath stuttered, “You don’t have to live in a cupboard for the rest of your life.”
“Oh really?” he laughed, mean, “That’s funny, considering that you’ve told me that you -”
Go your own way"
“Yeah,” she took a deep breath, squared her shoulders.
“Er,” Draco blushed a little and thunked his head back on the edge of the tub, “I think we’d better wait a minute.”
And yes, that was Ginny snickering in the fire.
It was wet. How nice.
Aengus tipped his head and smiled.
Draco didn’t look into the flat, at first, but watched the shock and wonder cross Harry’s face. He had forgotten - in all the publicity, in Harry’s popularity, in his heroics and all of that fabulous nonsense, it was easy to ignore the facts of Harry’s childhood. The ways he was already screwed up, long before -
Harry’s mouth was dry.
“Really,” his teenage drawl tried to make an appearance.
“It was the bath, obviously.”
The owl had arrived first thing, Harry barely out of bed, still in soft flannel pyjama bottoms and a threadbare t-shirt. Four words from Draco - and they sounded anything but cheerful, but Harry let himself, in this sleepy first hour of waking, imagine his smile. He wrote back immediately, his answer guaranteed before he’d put quill to parchment - “Come over.”
“Ah,” Narcissa nodded towards the back of the hall, “Draco’s just down there. In the study.”
That beats, that beats like a rolling drum"
“Oh, Harry, you will be careful, won’t you?”
He stayed up all night, playing records, lying in bed, sleepless. Dirty.
“So,” he nudged him with his elbow, “Cat.”
Serons-nous détestables ?
Not that she’d admit that, mind.
Draco stood, all elegance and remove. It was happening too fast.
Shame came in the wake of remembered pleasure.
You can read me anything"
And it was Harry who said it, and Draco growled again like a bear in a trap, bit that place on Harry’s neck which never had time, now, to heal, and Harry pulsed and poured out what felt like a lifetime of come, holding onto Draco like a vise.
He rolled over on the lumpy couch. He had decided to wait, just a few more weeks, before moving into the new flat. It was maybe 7:00 in the morning, and he’d felt the fatigue of too many heavy days, so he’d tucked himself in as soon as Lily’s light had gone off last night.
“Look,” she stared up at him, suddenly fierce and a bit defensive, “I know I said I’d be in Scotland -” oh yeah, that was it, “With the National team, and, well, I was, but I had an extra night, and, er, I actually slept over with Neville, and...”
He looked at Britt’s sweet, round face, and imagined it lifeless and grey. Fuck.
“Love me forever, ‘course.” A classic routine, the answers long ago memorized.
“So… you okay with fucking your brother?”
This chapter means a whole hell of a lot to me. To put it bluntly, I was abused and neglected as a child, and my life has been colored by those experiences. I often think about who I might have been without that abuse - what other choices I might have made. I sought security, safety, and a gentle love above all else, and I neglected so many other parts of myself. Now, close to Draco and Harry's ages in this story, I'm figuring out that my trauma is not the only thing which defines me. That I am worthy of so much love.
“What do you think you’re doing, Potter?
This was entirely his choice.
In this other world, Harry got adopted by the Weasleys, and Draco's mum was brave, confronted by the reality of her husband’s monstrosity, and she was the first Black to file for divorce. Harry grew up with Charlie as a big brother - Charlie, the dragon tamer with the tattoos and the leather jacket and the boyfriend - and Harry learned how not to be afraid of that secret within him. Draco still lit candles at Solstice, still had pride in wizarding traditions, but it was a pride made richer by the kindness of Andie, and a relationship with cousin Dora. Narcissa, still upright and regal, unclenched, proved that she was eager to love him and make amends for all she had done to harm him, now that they both were free.
And there on the bottom of the stack, an owl in terribly familiar writing.
Her jaw dropped.
“Potter,
The way I'm drinkin' you down
He could hardly bear to look at her.
“And I have three amazing children - and you have Scorpius,” Draco nodded, with a fleeting smile, “So I can’t regret that, even though -”
“Not really,” but even as he said it, he felt the first hit of nicotine to his system. Another thing he could get used to, and fast.
When he left the Granger-Weasley’s that night, he was tipsy, wrung out, and lighter than he had been in years.
His voice was soft and miserable.
But most of all, that first year was marked by an almost orgiastic adherence to a sepulchral warning - “don’t wanna stay alive/When you’re 25.”
Another choice, another cliff, another house plummeting to the ground.
Draco was due back from work any second; Harry was staring at his packed suitcase.
“You know what, Potter? I always thought that between the two of us, I was the coward. But guess I was wrong.”
Draco looked up, slammed the bottle down, and then seemed to fold in on himself.
Truth be told, he had in his life possessed many terrible ideas. Rejecting Snape’s help (however begrudgingly given) with Occlumency ranked high as one of his worst, given that it ended with the death of one of the only people who ever loved him.
His hand was speeding up.
And if he saw Malfoy, that would be… good. He shook his head. Fine. It would be fine.
“Fuck, Ron. I’ve been so stupid.”
Back at the flat - as they cleaned themselves up, went back for drinks, for more dancing - a mouse skittered over parchment, crumpled up and shoved under the bed. A bit of writing flashed in the shift of light - “Dear Harry,” it said, and there might have been other words, letters like W, maybe, or G - but the rest was hidden in shadow and ash.
Americans.
His godfather stared down at him, eyebrow lifted, a hint of a smirk warming his sallow face.
“Yes, yes, alright, very nice, shut up.”
As she left - muttering with artistic profanity all the things she wanted to do with Potter’s intimate parts - Harry kept looking at him, and looking, and Draco - he was a mess, the burning butt of a cigarette in hand, and whiskey in his bloodstream, and he loved him, painfully, without doubt, and it was the absolute fucking worst, and -
“You know,” he was running his fingers over the light down of Draco’s arm, “I still technically have a hotel room.”
“About you? I guessed in third year.”
He felt Draco’s hand, running down his ribcage, over the side of his abdomen, over his hip. The hand exerted delicate force, tilting his hips up and back. His skin prickled into gooseflesh, hot and freezing at the same time.
“Alright,” his voice low, quiet, and he leaned over, nudging Draco’s knees up, kissing him soft and sweet.
He stretched out and breathed in and let himself drift -
“He,” Draco took a sip, moaned, “Merlin, this is good. He convinced my son to go wandering the Forbidden Forest, at night, for potions ingredients.”
He swung himself up and over, straddling Harry, thighs holding him tight; Harry’s hands slid up his legs, cupping his arse and pulling him closer, letting one hand wander to the centre of his back.
They hadn’t been close for a long time. They lived their lives in parallel, each going to work, caring for the kids, doing their assigned tasks, and it was almost as if nothing had really changed. They had love for each other, lots of love, just - they were already separate.
Astoria was a lovely woman, with a truly stunning laugh like sex on concrete, and she and mother spent hours together, very happily, and it wasn’t her fault, not really, that he couldn’t -
“No,” he shook, “Never.”
After, once he’d come spectacularly and returned the favor with all the enthusiasm of their 18 years, they lay in bed, lazy, fingers trailing over exposed skin.
Because it’s Malfoy, a hidden part of him whispered. It’s always been like this.
He watched Draco’s back, the slender lines of the coat, the perfectly hemmed trousers, the impeccable posture, the long fall of shining hair.
Secrets.
He looked over at the guitar player, who flushed under his hot gaze, and he let himself remember the night when he first discovered this bar - another Wednesday - and the way those calloused fingers scraped the soft skin of his hips, the way his hot mouth opened and enveloped Draco, the way his voice grew rough as he sang “Fisherman’s Blues.”
The driver kept up a running commentary in an almost impenetrable accent. Harry let his voice wash over him, staring out the window as the shipyards went by. He remembered something from a muggle history class - the shipyards had been bombed in the second world war. What the muggles hadn’t known was that Grindlewald played a part in those bombings, magic kicking up shrapnel of steel and coal.
“Just do it for me, please, Pans.”
Never tell me no
“Malfoy.”
Al looked down at Scorp’s blonde head, resting on his chest.
“Touch me, Draco,” his voice was too tender. Draco hated it.
This was a terrible idea.
“Good,” she began to walk towards his right, where he could just make out the ruins of a pretty blue and cream room, a lone chaise longue untouched by decay, “Do not make me regret sharing what little hospitality we have left to offer.”
“Harry, have you,” he was quiet, and blushed a light pink, “Have you really never done that before?”
“Kiss me.”
“Mm,” he propped his chin on Draco’s chest but looked away, “Just… in the mood, I guess. For that.”
And Draco was so angry. He took Harry into him, both of them still wet, and it was rough and so, so good.
If I could
“I’ll apparate home, yeah?”
"Oh show
Turning his back was one of the hardest things he’d ever done. He started to walk down the stairs, back to the club, back to find a stranger who didn’t - who didn’t make him feel -
The first bit of magic he’d seen him do all summer.
Get a grip, Harry.
And then Harry was thinking about Draco, who he’d seen every day in eighth year. Draco, who - after that one meeting at the manor - totally ignored him, and withdrew from everyone else. Draco, who he couldn’t call Malfoy anymore, not even in his head.
Get it together, Harry. Stop. Just -
“Draco!” a strident, terrified voice from behind him. He turned, saw Pansy’s face, and everything froze in the air until he fell, and it all crashed to the ground with him.
Yeah, I have a job, he thought. He imagined his father’s pinched face behind the bars of Azkaban. That’s right, father. I’m a fucking cleaner.
Oh, gods.
He folded in on himself, knees propped up, head dropped, the bottle dangling from his hand, “What are you doing here?”
The walk to Draco’s flat went quickly - the addy coursing through his system like lightning.
Yes, he had lived a rough life for several years. Yes, he could do it, and he did it well.
“Mother -”
Draco wrinkled his nose, one of those hidden smiles at the corner of his mouth. And he closed his eyes and sighed.
“It’s been fun, Potter.”
He felt shame rush up the skin of his neck.
Playlist track: "The Book of Love" by Peter Gabriel.
He’d been so fucking stupid.
“You’re rubbish at sneaking around without your cloak.”
Did you know that HARRY POTTER’s son is in my year? He’s got Slytherin too. And he’s got the bed next to mine, and I think he’s the smartest in our year (other than me) because he had SO MANY BOOKS IN HIS TRUNK Dad, really.
Narcissa popped over with some (uncomfortable) regularity for a glass of whiskey or a pot of tea and Harry had always been anxious until she grabbed him by the face and whispered, Draco out of the room, “You finally got it right. Thank you for loving him back.”
Baby, I'd give you my world
He picked his head up and kissed Draco, right at the corner of his mouth where he kept his secret smiles.
His vision went all wibbly around the edges.
The words seemed to settle into him, a solid mass of self-hatred and longing and fear. But he had to try - he kept talking.
“Of course not.”
“You were about to sing the stump song!”
I don't think I'll risk another
“No.”
“No,” Malfoy's face was ugly, almost too broken to behold, and Harry couldn’t smile anymore, “I just -”
“Thought you could have it with Ginny, you mean.”
“Something like that.”
“Well you should bloody well do it.”
“No,” he felt an hysterical laugh at the back of his throat, totally undignified, “I don’t suppose you would have.”
Hermione arranged the portkeys - travel across the Atlantic took more than one. London to Belfast (“Because you might as well see a bit more of the British Isles, Harry”), then to Reykjavik, then Newfoundland, then New York City, where Kingsley’d arranged a bed sit for a couple weeks. And then a road trip. See the Grand Canyon. Throw down some galleons in the magic quarter of Las Vegas. Meet a movie star. Drink Mai Thais in San Francisco.
Life is fucking short, he thought.
He laughed, rolled on top of Scorp, kissed his neck.
“And my cousin. Ugh,” Draco wrinkled his nose, took a sip of coffee, “Let’s move on, shall we?”
So he came home. Back to the manor, which he had renovated and repaired. Back to bitching with Pansy over tea, and glasses of scotch with Blaise, and Greg owling him chocolates. Investing in his friends, his Slytherin family whom everyone still hated. Designing and perfecting the charms for magi-muggle charge cards at Gringotts. Making more money. Grinding, even now.
“Our kids are such a mess, aren’t they?” She shook her head, then grinned, “Nothing like we were, of course.”
Harry Potter had always wanted Draco Malfoy.
“I don’t know why you followed me here, Potter. Maybe you’re having some sort of post-war crisis - frankly, I don’t particularly care.
“Spread your legs,” Harry complied quickly, “Well done.”
How he’d woken up, every morning for almost 17 years, expecting to see Draco. Putting a record on. Mixing up instant coffee. Dancing naked in front of the mirror.
Harry pulled up his pyjamas, wincing, then reached out -
How many people died because of immutable hatred?
“No, Malfoy. I’m here to -” and he pulled Draco’s wand from his pocket, “I just - you should have this back.”
Harry shivered, whimpered, “Almost every -”
“I mean you got basically a million NEWTS. Oh, Christ -” Scorp’s broom-calloused hand moved around him.
He’d wandered for a quite a while after stepping off the train, and found himself ducking into a small cafe, desperate for coffee. It never occurred to him that he’d be able to find Malfoy on the very first morning of the very first day - it was as if the universe decided to give him what he had wanted, but without any adequate preparation. He wondered if his life was just destined to be him, Harry freaking Potter, bumbling along and finding trouble at the most inopportune of moments.
And the bloke in front of him was attractive enough, but he couldn’t help compare - his hair was too tidy, his leer too obvious, and whatever he was grinding up against Draco’s leg was… unsatisfactory.
“Harry,” Draco reached down, stilled his hands, “I can’t. Not yet. Not after -” his face was pinched but shaded with pleasure, and insecure.
Jamie, forced to turn his music off - some Belgian rapper, it turned out, and a big thanks to Gabbi Goyle for that - and properly listen, gave an epic shrug which seemed to indicate, “Nothing to do with me,” and, “Is there a reason you’re interrupting my day with this?”
He shook his head, reluctant but certain.
“Al and Scorp, they’re so…” he trailed off, then said, mournful, almost under his breath, “We could have had years.”
And then he heard the door opening again. Hermione swept in from the front hall, dumping her robes on a kitchen chair. Hugo lifted his arms for a hug, and she started to hug him back - and then saw icing sugar all over his face.
“Neville Longbottom, slaying snakes and swimming in fanny.”
He was.
The fireplace was shouting at him.
“Yeah, Dad,” he and his blonde shadow finally detached, “See you later.”
“Give it up, she’ll always know everything.”
“Shut up, Harry.”
Draco moaned, high and long, and breathed out, shaking, “You know you love it.”
“Did you.”
“Ginevra…”
Hermione reached out and grabbed his hand, fast and tight.
He looked up at her, fast. There was a little meanness around the fine lines of her eyes, but mostly he saw an undeserved tenderness.
“This summer… I’ve figured you out, Potter. Why you’ve always been like this, so fucking selfish,” he leaned his head against the peeling paint of the window, “And I don’t think that it was the war that fucked you up at all. I think you got off on it - I think you enjoyed telling yourself that you were brave. That you were the hero of the story,” he laughed with the jarring friction of broken glass.
They undressed each other, slow and careful like they both might break, and maybe Harry’d gotten a little softer (but just a little) and he could practically count the ribs on Draco’s torso (he still forgot to eat, sometimes, and Harry would have to fix that) but fuck, it was still them. Still so rough and tender and perfect, the way they fit, and they slipped into the tub, Draco resting in Harry’s arms, and it was overwhelming, and Harry got the giggles.
Harry looked at the train. Looked at the robes. Looked up at Malfoy.
He was too damned old to feel like this. Like something in him was shattering. Like he couldn’t breathe.
“I told you,” he dropped his body, his cock brushing up against Draco’s, and they both moaned, “I’ve never done anything.”
“Mm.”
Harry opened his eyes, head still against stone, looking at him under his thick black lashes.
“I knew about Gin and Nev.”
She laughed, derisive.
And that happened again - Al, born a little early and still small, and Lily, the perfect package, seven pounds and bright red fluff. He loved all three of his children so much that it filled the dead parts of him. They almost filled the portions of his heart that could never be satisfied with Ginny.
