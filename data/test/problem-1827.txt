“As it is,” he continued, “the fate of my people is at stake, and the only other necromancer in the land is still in training. She’s a promising young Elf, but since she is still a child, she doesn’t have the knowledge or experience necessary to find what is killing my people. You, on the other hand, do. So.” He leaned back in his chair and pressed his steepled fingertips to his pointy chin. “The privy council will be meeting tomorrow morning. I trust you will behave better then.”
Draco walked away in a daze. What was he supposed to do now? He had no idea where Harry lived. He supposed he could go to Pansy and ask to borrow her owl – but no, her owl had passed away last Christmas. He couldn’t send a Patronus – no matter how hard he’d tried, he could never get so much as a wisp of white smoke. He couldn’t just show up at the Ministry and demand to see Harry Potter – could he? He picked up his pace, turning towards a quiet alleyway to Disapparate in. To the Ministry it was.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Charlie, I forgot to ask, how’s your partner? Oh, that’s right, you don’t have one.”
Draco nodded. He knew that feeling intimately. Knew it in his bones. The dread he woke up with each morning, the fear that the Mark would flare up, the certainty that any day now, someone or something would come for them, make them fight for their lives again. But each day went much like the last, and nothing was coming.
Harry was on his feet, pulling Draco into his arms before he could think twice about it. Draco collapsed against him, still in his chair, his face buried against Harry’s stomach as he wept. Harry held him, rubbing his back and murmuring softly, “It’s okay, I got you, I’m here.”
“Ngh, you’re cold,” he mumbled into the pillow. Draco chuckled and nuzzled in closer, wrapping his arms around Harry and burying his face in the crook of his neck, even when Harry squirmed, complaining about his cold nose. Harry turned in his arms to face him, hooking one leg around Draco’s him as he lay nose to nose with him. “How was South Africa?” he asked, voice still thick with sleep. Draco shrugged, kissed him on the forehead instead of answering.
Harry glanced up, one eyebrow raised. “Oh really?” he asked, his voice rough and husky from arousal sending shivers down Draco’s spine. “What do you want, then?”
Draco set down his cup on the desk and pinched the bridge of his nose, his frown deepening. “Ah yes, Auror Potter,” he sighed. “Here we go.”
. The last time he had watched it, he told Harry he would never find true love and proceeded to sign them up for dating apps. The problem was that they went to a boarding school that only let the older students go to the neighbouring village when they had football matches.
“Yes, sir, I did,” he replied, his tone matching Robards’. Harry was slightly taller than Robards, who was in contrast stout and barrel-chested, a man of war during a time of peace. Robards looked at Harry as if he wasn’t sure whether to be disappointed or impressed.
Harry was quiet that week. He spent more time on the Quidditch pitch training than usual, would have his head buried in his text books whenever Draco saw him in the common room, and was always leaving the Great Hall when Draco came down for meals. After building such a tentative camaraderie that first month and a half, Draco became increasingly suspicious that Potter was up to something, and he was determined to figure out what. In the back of his mind, he couldn’t help but remember hearing that noise the night he had produced a Patronus, couldn’t shake the thought that maybe, just maybe, Potter had seen. His stomach twisted into a Gordian knot at the thought, and after that, he started avoiding Potter too.
Potter let out a watery laugh. “Go on, then. I don’t think I’ve ever heard you apologise about anything before.”
“-tells me that he, at least, has either come to forgive you or is using his heart rather than his head.”
“Oh,” Harry whispered. “Erm. Well. Long story short, we realised we loved each other, but we weren’t
“What do you suggest?” Draco asked. He scowled and poked at his paneer tikka masala with his fork. “We can’t fight everyone who sends me a death threat. I know, I dealt with this shit after my trial for almost a year.”
Harry ran into his friends in the hallway. When they demanded to know where he had gone, he just shrugged and said he wanted to check out the first floor. Hermione rolled her eyes at him as if he had done something incredibly stupid.
house… But even after, every time I went outside, I would break out into a cold sweat. I was an absolute mess.” He chuckled to himself and looked down at his hands. Harry frowned.
Draco closed his eyes, the memory of that night washing over him. His father, stinking of Firewhiskey, raging about losing a bet, had stormed out of their tent, murder in his eyes. Draco had hidden in his bed, hoping his father would come back and sleep it off. But then there were the screams, the jeers, the curses. He had stumbled out of their tent into chaos, had watched in horror as the bodies of the Muggle groundskeeper’s family were lifted into the air like limp ragdolls and paraded around the campsite like trophies of war. That night would haunt Draco the rest of his life. That night, he began to doubt.
Harry thanked him and, with one final indecipherable glance at Draco, moved away to look around the small space. Father Nicola raised an eyebrow at Draco, who blushed.
Teddy swallowed hard, his prominent Adam’s apple bobbing. His hair turned bubble gum pink, even the pale downy moustache forming on his upper lip. Draco narrowed his eyes – when Teddy hit puberty, his ability to change his hair had started to be affected by his emotions, flaring into all sorts of colours just as unpredictably as his teenage moods. Draco knew what pink meant, though. Teddy was embarrassed about something.
Draco looked up with a small frown. Harry’s smile was encouraging, kind even. “Go on, then,” he said, gesturing at Draco. “What happens?”
But Potter was not ready to walk with Death. And maybe that, above all, was what Draco put his faith in – that Potter would fight to the end, would conquer Death if he had to if it meant saving the people he loved. And when, in that final duel, Potter emerged victorious, holding the Elder Wand aloft, Draco fell to his knees and wept. “He’s okay,” he sobbed, unheeded, as the crowd surged to carry their saviour away. “He made it. He’s okay.”
Draco gave his testimony as calmly and in as neutral a voice as he could, just as Harry had told him. “Any emotion they will use against you,” he had warned as he straightened the collar of Draco’s dress shirt and smoothed out the shoulders. “Just give the facts, nothing more.”
Potter shook his head with a bemused smile, his green eyes twinkling behind his glasses. Draco’s gut tightened in that all-too familiar way it always did when he saw Potter. The wave of guilt and shame, however, was new. The last time they had seen each other was at Draco’s trial… when Potter had given him back his wand.
“Go to sleep,” he murmured, pressing a kiss to his white blonde hair. “I’ll be here when you wake up, I promise.”
“Your spells indicated that no one’s here. So did the team that did a sweep before we got here. There’s no point going room to room, if you ask me.”
“I’m not a ghost in the traditional sense. I don’t come from this world at all. I come from a parallel world, one where my family still lives in this manor, where there is magic and prophecies and all the rest. In that world, my world, some people are born with magic, and some are not. My family is what we call a Pureblood family, because every one of us was born a witch or wizard. But more and more often, a witch or wizard is born into a non-magical or Muggle family, or they’re half-blood, or so on. When you’re eleven, if you have magic, you’re sent off to school – here, most of us go to Hogwarts – where we learn magic and potions and all the rest. That’s where I met Harry, after our brief introduction getting our uniforms. That’s where everything started to go wrong.
Harry sat up, Draco’s hand falling away from his chest as he cradled Draco’s jaw. Without a word, he leaned in and kissed him sweetly, deeply. They moved slow, everything that could not be said pouring into each touch, each breath shared. Later, as they lay tangled on the floor, rocking against each other, steady like the tide, glorifying in the slide of skin against skin, Draco realised in a moment of pleasure that nothing came more naturally to him than loving Harry Potter. And that was quite alright by him.
Harry opened his eyes. Malfoy was still watching him, his grey eyes almost soft. He had let go of the railing, the tension running through him at the sight of Harry gone.
Harry sighed. He rubbed the heel of his palm into his eye, dislodging his glasses slightly. “Honestly,” he mumbled, “not right now. I get it, he’s sorry, but – I’ll talk to him later, alright? Good night, Hermione.”
“Firstly,” she began, “I would like to raise the fact that you continually referred to me by a slur and verbally abused me – all three of us, really – for six years.”
Draco scowled and threw a Chocolate Frog package at Harry’s head. Harry ducked and laughed, the sound so carefree that it startled a laugh out of Draco as well.
They both had a good laugh at this. After Harry turned off the lights and they settled down to sleep, he heard Draco murmur, “It’s not a terrible idea, being married to you.”
“Godson,” Harry clarified. “I have him whenever Andromeda needs a break, which just so happened to be this weekend.”
“I don’t know,” she admitted after a long silence. “Or, rather, I should say, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with you.”
Draco looked him straight in the eye. His gaze pinned Harry in his chair, like a snake getting ready to strike. Harry had to remind himself to breathe.
“Boring. Frustrating.” He added the tomatoes and tomato paste, stirring them into the vegetables until it began to form a thick sauce. The water began to boil, so he added the pasta. “It’s difficult, trying to do work without the lab. All I can do is theoretical planning. I’ve written something like fifty drafts of various grant proposals I haven’t even gotten approval for. I can’t wait for this case to be over so I can go back to work. So I can – ” but he bit back his words. He exhaled through his nose, then tasted the sauce.
“Maybe later,” Harry replied. Draco snorted with laughter. Harry smiled lazily. “And maybe then, you could call me
“Makes sense.” She brushed a bit of ash off of her scarlet robes and pushed her horn-rimmed glasses up her nose – Harry knew full well that they were just for show, which made no sense to him. “Down to business, then?”
“What – that’ s – I’m not – Draco’s the one,” Parkinson spluttered, pointing an accusatory finger at Draco. Ron looked over at Draco in false bemusement.
Hogwarts had been closed the previous year for renovations, the first time it had been closed in centuries, since the Black Death outbreak in 1348. This meant, of course, that there was an awkward bureaucratic shuffling around to be done. Ultimately, it was decided that the students would be organised according to year of study rather than house. The first and second years were put in the Hufflepuff dormitories, the third and fourth years in the Slytherin dormitories, fifth and sixth in Ravenclaw, and the seventh and eighth years in Gryffindor. Draco suspected some favouritism was at play. At the same time, it was probably for the best – the dungeons brought back memories, and memories kept him up at night. So he grudgingly settled into Gryffindor tower, even if it meant sleeping in the same dormitory as the Chosen One.
The minute the green flames died away, taking Kellen and Auror Tsai with them, Harry poured the contents of the vial into the Pensieve. He took a deep breath, his thoughts racing. What could Malfoy want him to see? After one more steadying breath, he lowered his face to the rippling water.
“Why’d you want to know about Ginny?” Harry asked. He bent his head to rest his cheek against his knees, turning his face towards Draco to look at him more fully. There was that blush again, and this time Harry saw it creep up from under Draco’s starched collar. Draco shrugged.
Dawkins turned on his heel as he and Harry stared at Ivanovich who continued in his heavily-accented growl, “I would never do business with a Malfoy, not after what that bastard Lucius did to me!” He spat on the ground. “That bastard sold me out after the Dark Lord was defeated the first time. I swore on that day I would never do business with a Malfoy again, ever! If I had known
Draco nodded. He gave Harry’s knee a small squeeze. “It took years,” he continued softly. “I really did find myself in my work, but I guess… Pansy made me realise today that maybe I got lost in my work a bit as well. I pushed you away because I was so afraid that I would lose everything I built towards. I thought I was going to lose myself again. But maybe… I already have.” Draco sighed. None of what he wanted to say was coming out the way he wanted. “What I’m trying to say is… I do love you. I just don’t know how.”
“Sure, you weren’t Finnegan blowing up half the things you owned, but Potter, how many times did you almost die?”
Malfoy’s eyes widened, and a greyish tint came into the pallor of his cheeks. He swayed a little as he stood. Harry frowned, half-expecting Malfoy to either vomit or swoon, or both. Malfoy seemed to guess his thoughts and waved him off, instead pulling out a chair and sitting down shakily across from him. “Who?” he finally managed to ask. Harry sighed.
“Harry! Malfoy,” she added, nodding politely at Draco. “Sorry, I didn’t see you there, I was… I have this essay due tomorrow morning and I just… How are you?”
Harry watched, stunned, as Dumbledore made his way from behind his desk. He patted Harry’s shoulder as he passed with a gentle smile, but otherwise he left without a word, the door to his office snicking closed behind him. Draco bit his lip as he held Harry’s wrist, not looking up into his confused face as he whispered, “Dumbledore’s right. I have to do this.”
Myrtle didn’t move at first. Harry took a step forward, looking up at her with his earnest green eyes. “Give us a minute, alright? I won’t hurt him, we just need to talk.”
“Ah, yes, she is….” Draco seemed unsure what the correct response was and landed on, “…she is a child.”
“How are you doing? Really?” he asked, voice low and soft, coaxing. Draco bit his lip. He was not going to fall apart in front of Potter, his arch nemesis, his rival. But was he, now? No, Draco thought, as he stared down at his hands twisting in his lap. Potter had ceased to be his enemy a long time ago. The minute he had lowered his wand from Dumbledore’s chest, the minute he had begun to doubt, the minute he had been forced to torture people he didn’t even know, Draco had stopped seeing Potter as someone to antagonise and hate. What was less clear was how Draco felt about him now.
Then there was the sound of the door to the flat opening and the thunder of Auror feet on the stairs. Harry jumped to his feet. Malfoy pulled his knees into his chest and returned to staring at the wall. The team crowded back into the empty room, Ivanovich bound and stumbling between them. Auror Dawkins bounced on the balls of his feet, his ruddy face beaming with victory.
Fire roared in the grate behind them. Draco froze and Harry immediately turned, keeping Draco behind him and levelling his wand at the intruder. He sighed in relief when he saw Ron, and dropped his wand back into the pocket of his robes.
Harry’s expression softened. “I know you’re lying,” he pointed out, tapping one finger against Draco’s jaw. “I can feel it.”
“Good morning,” he said. Malfoy only frowned. “There’s not much of a sunrise at this hour,” Harry explained, gesturing at the darkness outside the window, “so I thought I’d take a leaf from your book and read by the fire.” When Malfoy still didn’t move, Harry’s smile fell. He searched Malfoy’s face with worried green eyes wide behind his glasses. “Is that alright?” he asked. “I can go sit on the windowsill if it makes you more comfortable.”
Parkinson and Crabbe strode in. They both shot a glare over at Harry who pointedly ignored them. Draco looked up at them and gave them a tight smile. He set his phone down but didn’t turn to face them. Harry smirked behind his book.
“We may not know exactly what you’re feeling,” Harry said, picking his words with care, “but whatever you’re feeling is valid, and we support you, no matter what.”
It was a chaste kiss, but Harry wanted more. He tried to part Draco’s lips with his own, moving to angle his head to deepen the kiss, but Draco pulled away with a smirk. He settled back in his chair, taking a sip of his whiskey, revelling in the bewildered look on Harry’s face.
Ron slouched off to his desk. Harry sighed. He knew that he had not heard the end of it, and that by this evening, he would have Ron
Draco gasped softly. Since their talk the night after the hearing, they hadn’t said anything about love, tip-toeing around their feelings in favour of focusing on returning their lives to normal. But now the words were out, and Draco searched Harry’s face, his eyes wide. “Do you mean that?” he asked, his voice quiet and small.
century poet in another life, insisted that he confront Potter about it tomorrow morning over coffee.
“I mean, after the war,” Harry said. Draco groaned and rolled off Harry, landing with a huff on his back next to him. “What? Something must have happened. You work in a Muggle coffee shop. You share a flat, even though you and I both know – ”
Harry pushed the door open fully, revealing Draco standing just behind him, his sweaty hand still clutching Harry’s. Dumbledore, to his credit, did not look that surprised to see Draco. Instead, he gestured for the two of them to come in and take a seat.
“What are yours like?” Potter asked, his voice low and gentle just like it had been when he convinced Draco to come back to Hogwarts. Had he known, then, that they would be here together, unable to sleep but with nowhere else to go? Was that why he had asked, knowing Weasley was staying behind to help his family and that the only other person he knew returning was Granger, so deep in her studies that no one saw her except at mealtimes? Had he asked Draco because he wanted a familiar face, someone else to confide in, someone else who knew what it was like to be afraid of their own mind?
The woman raised a thin eyebrow. Harry ran a hand through his wild curls as he gave her a sheepish smile.
Malfoy nodded, not looking convinced. “Right,” he mumbled, holding the pyjamas close to his chest. He stared at them as he said, very slowly, “Could you, maybe, if it’s not too much trouble… Could you stay in my room tonight? Not – not in my bed, obviously,” he added, blushing. Harry fought back the laughter bubbling his throat at the sight of Malfoy flustered. “I just – it’s stupid, never mind.”
Hogwarts was more than just a castle. Built by warlocks outcast by human society, it was a safe haven for the magic increasingly forced out of the bounds of “civilisation” in the name of “progress.” As such, it was sovereign, under the protection of the Elven kingdom of Avalon but not subject to its laws. Magic users of every kind, from the green witch to the more academic sorcerers, gathered there, teaching and living within its stone walls and wild grounds. The nearby village traded with travelling merchants and Elven folk alike and tended to favour gold and copper coins for currency so as to not offend those with sensitivities to silver like the inscrutable Fae. The forest on the borders of the castle grounds were tended by a kindly half-giant who ran a rescue for magical creatures harmed by errant knights – dragons with torn wings that had been hunted out of their homes, unicorns whose horns had been poached for sport, griffins still bearing bald spots from where chains had held them down while paraded around in circuses for a hay-penny.
“That’s what I said,” Draco piped up. Hermione only glared at him. Harry, on the other hand, shuffled closer to brush his shoulder against Draco’s, a wordless ‘thank you’. Draco reached over and held Harry’s hand, giving it a small squeeze.
Draco wiped at his streaming eyes as he tried to get a hold of himself, shaking his head at Harry who was still clutching his ribs. “For fuck’s sake, Harry,” he wheezed, “why are you like this?”
Ron crossed his arms over his chest as he scowled at Harry. Harry set his jaw and refused to look away. They sat like that in tense silence for a long minute. Then, finally, Ron conceded defeat. His shoulders slumped and his scowl relaxed into a frown.
“I wanted to thank you,” he said slowly, his gaze focused on the dirt beneath his feet. “For speaking at my trial.”
“Nine and a half,” Harry corrected. Malfoy raised an eyebrow. Harry could feel his cheeks burning, and he turned around, bending down to open the cupboard and hide his face as he picked out the tea and cups. He decided to give Malfoy the cup covered in flowers. When he stood up and turned to face him again, Harry was surprised to find Malfoy quickly looking away and pretending to be very interested in a framed picture of Ron and Hermione on his desk. Harry shook his head and set the tea things on his desk. “So, not rivals,” Harry said, breaking the awkward silence. “Tell me, then. What have you been up to? And be honest, don’t give me that ‘this and that’ again,” he added quickly when Malfoy opened his mouth. “If you want to chat, you need to do better than that.”
“Potter, I’m suspending you for the rest of the week,” Robards said, his voice dangerously quiet. “Take some time to cool your head, think about what I’ve said. Then, next week, I expect you to return with a professional attitude befitting your position, do you understand?”
“Well, technically,” Draco said, unfreezing and stepping forward to rest his hand on Harry’s other shoulder, “I’m your cousin once-removed on your mother’s side.” Harry frowned at Draco.
Going into the Pensieve always reminded Harry of diving into a lake, only to open your eyes underwater and see the hidden world beneath the surface. The grey swirling mist that first surrounded him faded and began to coalesce into marble floors and a vaulted ceiling. He was at Malfoy Manor, and there was blood on the floor. A lone figure stood in the middle of the room, dressed all in black, his hair like moonlight in the shadows. His head was bowed, and his whole body trembled like a leaf. Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
Draco nodded once, his shoulders relaxing a fraction. Without another word, they wove their way through the crowd to the lifts to descent to the court rooms.
“You sure? Is the blue okay? I almost went with green, but I thought that wouldn’t work with the robes, and then I thought maybe white would be more traditional…”
Fifteen minutes later, Hermione made her way out of the fireplace and into the kitchen, cradling a massive tome around the swell of her pregnant belly. She slammed the book down on the kitchen table where the three of them sat, Harry and Draco on one side and Ginny on the other, staring at the ring on her finger with glazed eyes. Hermione huffed in exasperation.
Kellen gave him a sympathetic look over her horn-rimmed glasses. “Of course, sir. Send Humphries if you need anything.”
Draco shifted to face Harry better. He reached out and put his hand on Harry’s knee, but unlike Harry, he kept his hand there. He took a deep breath to steady himself.
While Malfoy began pulling clothes out of the dresser and adjoining closet and placing them neatly into a vintage leather suitcase, Harry examined the stack of books on the nightstand. Many had spines so cracked it was hard to make out their titles, and others were thick with sticky notes and bookmarks. It was an odd mix – classic literature with gold-leaf embossing, Muggle history books, and –
They were silent for a long while as they stared after her. Harry picked up her ring and held it cradled in his palm. Draco couldn’t bear to see the tears welling up in his sweet green eyes, so he turned to Hermione instead.
. I’m supposed to be protecting him, not bloody falling for him.” He groaned, his head falling onto his knees. “I’m so fucking screwed,” he groaned.
“So what if he’s a pouf?” Malfoy asked, and Harry was surprised to hear that he was being sincere. He heard a couple of loud groans from the other boys.
Harry sat up, cradling the book in his hands. “It’s okay,” he said. “It’s not something I exactly tell everyone.”
“It’s a haunted house, Ron, of course there are going to be spiders,” she said with exasperation. Ron stopped dead in his tracks while Hermione and the other boy, Harry, continued on. His face had gone white as a sheet.
Draco stopped talking to him. He didn’t come down in the mornings, leaving Harry with a cold cup of tea and a book that didn’t belong to him. He avoided Harry’s questioning eyes at meals, took to sitting next to Daphne Greengrass during lessons, and constantly had the curtains on his four-poster drawn. Harry felt like his foot had fallen through the trick stair in one of the secret passageways, unable to escape while Draco got further and further away. By the end of a week of this, Harry had enough.
In the end, they were both too broken, then, to stay together. Harry had tried, but Draco pushed him away, until their only interactions were longing glances unseen by the other, shoulders brushing in the corridors, murmured apologies over small accidents that meant more than they were. It was better that way, Draco had convinced himself. When the exams were over, Draco applied to be a Healer’s apprentice, and Harry stayed at Hogwarts to teach at McGonagall’s behest.
“Yes, well, I imagine living at the school does mean you are in close quarters with each other,” Narcissa said slowly.
Harry thought they might notice how the sheet over the couch had been stuck into the cushions after all the time Harry spent lounging on it with Draco, or the way there was a path to the hall where the dust lay less heavily on the ground. Everyone was too busy, though, admiring the peeling wallpaper, the moth-eaten velvet curtains, the threadbare Oriental rugs, the large stash of cider, vodka and juice they had brought. Harry caught a flicker of white in the corner of his eye and turned – but the hall was dark, and Draco was nowhere to be found.
“Christ on a bike, you scared me!” He stood, still massaging his chest. Draco didn’t look the least bit apologetic. In fact, in his pressed charcoal-grey trousers with matching blazer over a black turtleneck, he looked the definition of posh. As they set off with the rest of the students, lingering a little behind the group, Draco easily fell into stride next to Harry with a smirk.
“Because I think I’m falling in love with you,” Harry whispered. Draco opened his eyes and turned his head to look at him in slight surprise. Harry worried that maybe he’d said the wrong thing, that maybe it was too soon – but then Draco’s smile broadened into a grin.
That next year, as he tried to play the part of the dutiful son, as he watched people plead for mercy in front of him, as he snuck food down to a starving girl with a benevolent smile, he thought about who he could possibly believe in.
So, one Floo trip to Hogsmeade and one Apparation later, when Harry and Draco found themselves outside the gates to Malfoy Manor, Harry still wasn’t entirely convinced that he was not going to get cursed for dating Narcissa Malfoy’s son.
“There was a year,” he said, his voice quiet, “when things got really out of hand. I was still living at the Manor, Father had just been released, and… I don’t remember a lot, I was drunk most of the time. I would go out, not come home for days, take a shower and repeat. I don’t know how he found out, not that I was trying to hide it, but – one day I came home, and my parents sat me down, told me that they had arranged for me to marry Astoria Greengrass, and I had to clean up or leave.”
Draco shook his head. He tossed his apple in the air, caught it with one hand and took a bite. Pansy rolled her head to the side, lips pursed as she looked her best friend up and down.
He felt Draco kiss the curve of his neck in turn. “I like you, too, Scarhead,” he mumbled against Harry’s skin.
“One day,” he whispered against Harry’s shoulder as he gave Harry a small squeeze. “But I’m too tired now.” Harry chuckled again.
Draco opened one eye, then the other. When it did not seem like his mother was immediately going to hit him, he relaxed his death grip on Harry’s hand a little. Some of the colour had returned to Narcissa’s face, but from the way the muscle in her jaw was working, Harry guessed that there was a lot she was holding back.
When they came up for air, it was to wolf whistles and cheers. Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s shoulder with a breathless laugh. Draco looked up, and there was Pansy and Blaise, cheering them on with cheeky grins. Next to them was Hermione, her belly swollen with her first child, Ron beside her with his arm around her shoulders. She gave Draco a thumbs up.
When Draco stepped out of the fireplace in the Great Hall, which had been temporarily set up to Floo students in and out for the holidays, Harry was there. He grinned as Harry all but jumped into his arms, and even though they got a few odd looks from the other students, Draco found he didn’t care. He buried his face in Harry’s curls and breathed in the smell of him, of cedar and black pepper.
? Yeah, thought I’d give it a go,” he added at Hermione’s raised eyebrows. Ron had started to disengage from the conversation, his eyes glazing over – books had never been his cup of tea, and he had certainly never heard of
Harry’s eyes searched his face. “Have you?” he asked. Draco thought about it. His hand, almost on its own, reached up to brush his fingertips along the line of one of Harry’s cheek bones, the stubbled sweep of his jaw. Harry blinked at him slowly, leaning almost imperceptibly into the touch. The loose grip he had on Draco’s wrist tightened ever so slightly.
Draco rubbed his face with his hands with a sigh. “It’s more complicated than you think, Pans,” he said in a low voice. “I… I lose myself when I’m with him. And I can’t do that again, Pansy, I just can’t.”
Draco bit his lip as a fountain of emotions bubbled up in his throat. He swallowed and set his takeaway on the coffee table so that he could mirror Harry’s crossed arms. “You said it yourself,” he argued, his voice thick, “This isn’t living, the way we’re carrying on. It would be better for the both of us if I just… disappear.”
Kellen hesitated. She tucked a stray hair back into her sleek bun. “I’m really supposed to bring it back once we’re done. It’s on loan from the Department of Mysteries. But I guess I could say you wanted to go over the memory again, so we’re not really done with it – that is what you’re using it for, right?” she added, raising an eyebrow at him. Harry nodded fervently, his grip tightening on the vial in his pocket. She sighed. “Alright then. I’ll let them know we’ll return it in the morning, and if they say anything about it, I’m blaming you, since you’re my supervisor on this. Goodnight, sir.”
Draco inched forward, his gaze flickering between Harry’s eyes and his slightly parted lips. Harry wondered distantly if he could feel how sweaty his hands were around Draco’s.
Hermione shook her head. “Well, I have to admit, I’m not entirely pleased about it,” she said carefully. “Don’t give me that look, Harry, you know I have every reason to be unhappy. Need I remind you that his aunt carved the word ‘Mudblood’ into my arm? Or that he tormented us for six years while we were at school?”
Harry scoffed and rocked back on his heels. He stuffed his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket. He raked his eyes up and down Malfoy’s form, or what he could see of it from the waist up. His hair was brushed back off his forehead, a faint blush lingered on his high cheekbones, his black apron was covered in coffee grounds, and the sleeves of his cotton button down were rolled up to the elbows. Harry frowned.
“Oh, Malfoy was really paranoid about the Floos,” he said, setting a cup of coffee in front of her on the kitchen table. “So I closed that one off for the time being.”
Harry pushed himself to his feet. “I’ll tell you later,” he said. “Come on, we should head back. People will be wondering where we are, and Dumbledore will be wanting his office back.”
Christian Bell, a stout blond boy from the year below them, punched Draco lightly in the arm with a grin. Harry noticed Draco stifling a flinch. He’d have to talk to the rest of them about being careful with physical contact around Draco, he thought with an inward sigh.
“Do you want this?” Harry murmured, his lips brushing the sensitive spot just below Draco’s ear. Draco’s knees shook as he nodded, unable to form words. “Because if you don’t, we don’t have to – ”
“You know exactly what I’m talking about!” Draco shouted. “Your little dare! What, you want to have a laugh, take the piss with your friends about it later? Is that all this was?”
“There’s a spell,” Ginny interrupted, her voice quiet but clear. “But there’s only one person I can think of who would know it.”
“Dobby, prepare a chamber for Sir Potter. He is to stay on as a counsellor while I investigate the situation further. Then call a meeting of my privy council for tomorrow morning. And all of you,” he turned to the guards, “none of the information you have heard leaves this room, do you understand?”
“I’m not going to let him hurt you,” Harry said firmly. Draco looked up with a hiccough, the skin around his eyes red and puffy from tears.
“So it’s a ‘him’? Not surprising, most of them were.” Malfoy passed a hand over his face. The shadows under his eyes that had seemed to lighten the day before were once again as dark as fresh bruises. “How did he die? Was it – was it
“Anyways,” he drawled, “she asked if there was anyone I was interested in, so of course I told her about you…”
“Oh, yeah. Actually, he was over this weekend. And, er, he met the guy I’m dating,” he said quickly. Ron’s jaw dropped.
“So, logically, you only came when your life was in danger,” Harry said teasingly. Draco wrinkled his nose at him.
Draco rolled his eyes and chuckled. Harry’s shoulders relaxed. Draco wanted to ask him more about his life with the Dursleys, find out exactly what those monsters did to the Golden Boy, but he held off. He’d pried enough. He searched Harry’s face, lingering on the pale bolt of lightening on his forehead, on the dark stubble that shadowed his strong jaw, the quirk of his lips. Harry noticed and cocked his head to one side.
“No,” Harry laughed. “You’re doing better. You’re becoming a better Draco. That’s all I could ask for. No more apologies, okay?” He leaned in and gave Draco a quick peck on the lips, drawing back only to rest his forehead against Draco’s. “Just be here with me, okay?”
After Kellen’s testimony, the judge, a portly woman with thick black hair and a stern face lined with wrinkles, called Draco to the witness box. A wave of hushed whispers ripped through the court room as he went. George followed Draco’s movements, a nasty curl to his lips. Harry’s heart broke in two. He dug his nails into his palms, desperate to feel anything but this.
“Ron told me what happened and, oh, Harry, I’m so sorry, he shouldn’t have reacted like that. I gave him a piece of my mind, let me tell you, and he’s very apologetic about it now. He says he was so caught up in the moment that he didn’t realise the consequences of his actions which is just so typical of him. Anyway, apparently after you left he got told off by Robards as well, he wasn’t suspended though which surprised me because you were clearly the victim in this case, you really shouldn’t have been suspended whatsoever, and if you want me to try and challenge it I can.”
“Oh, but I do,” Sirius said coolly, grey eyes cutting into Vernon like silver blades. A wild whip of a man, Sirius had the poise of nobility and the look of a rogue with his thick black hair loose about his handsome face and his hand on the hilt of the dagger sheathed in his belt. “His father’s blood runs in his veins, and only another warlock can train him to be what he was always meant to be. You would do well to surrender him to my care. Besides,” he added with a sinister leer, “if what I’ve seen so far is testament to the way you have been treating him these last few years, you should consider yourself lucky that I don’t demand further penance from you.”
Harry nodded. He dug a nail under the bottle’s label, succeeded in prying off a corner of it. “Yeah, I made Junior Auror last month,” he said. The smile he forced didn’t last long. Especially not after Malfoy asked him how that was going. “Great,” he mumbled. “Fantastic. Spectacular.” He took another swig and set the beer down on the small table near Malfoy. Passing this close, he could smell Malfoy’s cologne, mint and citrus mixed with vanilla. Harry swallowed hard and leaned away, back to his side of the balcony.
Hermione shook her head at Ron’s grumpy brooding. “I think it’s safe to say that we were wrong, Ronald,” she said, nudging him with her shoulder. “You can relax now.”
Draco bit his lip and gave his one-shouldered shrug. “Whiskey makes me sleepy,” he said, not looking at Harry. Something in the fidgety way Draco’s fingers played with the hem of his jumper made Harry suspect Draco wasn’t being completely honest. “Goodnight, Harry.”
The crowd burst into hushed exclamations and disapproving whispers. George spat at Malfoy, a globule of phlegm flying through the air. The judge banged her gavel, calling for order. Harry caught Draco’s eye and held it imploringly, sympathetically, desperately.
“I am, I am,” said Draco. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, with a sigh. “It’ll be good for you to get out of your aunt and uncle’s house, and I won’t have to worry so much about you showing up with bruises. No, this is good, really good. I’m happy for you.”
“My team is my family,” Harry spat at Parkinson. “And unlike you, they’re not a bunch of bigots.” He could already hear the rumble of footsteps coming up the steps behind them, and he grinned, his eyes steely as he stared Parkinson down. “I’m sure they won’t mind getting their hands dirty to show you some manners.”
Harry chuckled and got out of his chair so that Draco could slide in. He gave Draco a quick kiss on the top of his head before making his way over and dropping into the empty chair next to Ron.
Draco turned his head to watch Harry’s reaction. Harry blinked a few times, frowned, seemed to review all of his memories of Teddy in his head, and nodded to himself, his chin digging slightly into Draco’s shoulder. “Okay,” he said. “Yeah. So, what’s the problem? You know we would be fine with that, so there’s got to be something else. Am I right?”
Draco shrugged, not looking at Harry. He dabbed a bit of cologne on and turned one last time for the mirror, who sighed and told him, “You look perfect, dear.”
“In my defence, you were being the asshole, being all touchy feely,” Draco argued half-heartedly. Harry looked down at him.
To Harry’s surprise, Draco answered him by leaning forward and kissing him, hard. Harry let out a small undignified noise, but quickly turned the situation to his advantage. He moved to grip Draco’s hips, pulling himself right into the circle of Draco’s legs as he deepened the kiss. Draco gasped into his mouth as their hips came together, his hands tangling themselves in Harry’s thick, coarse hair. It was everything he wanted and more. He wrapped his legs around Harry’s low back, holding him there. Harry pushed a hand up Draco’s chest, his touch searing Draco’s skin through the dress shirt. Draco pulled away with a sharp intake of breath as his fingers brushed up against a nipple. Harry raised his eyebrows with a smirk.
The ghost of a grin spread across Draco’s lips. “Huh. I almost forgot about that. You are right, you can be an absolute nightmare when you want to be.”
Luna laughed. “No,” she said confidently. “I think they’re beyond that now.” She pointed out towards the balcony across the gradually emptying room – people had started to head home hours ago. But through the gauzy curtain, Ginny could just make out two men, one short and one tall, their shoulders brushing as they talked. She opened her mouth, only to close it again.
“… but only for one drink. Then I have to get back. I’ve had a long shift and tomorrow’s my only day off this week. I plan on sleeping through most of it. So, when is this reunion?”
Hermione thanked Harry for the tea he set in front of her. He sat down across from her at the kitchen table, waiting for her to speak first. He was glad Ron wasn’t with her. He was even more glad that Draco was still at work, his first since the trial. He had told Harry he’d probably be working late dealing with the backup of paperwork, and that he wanted to swing by his flat to grab a few things. He’d be by for dinner around 7pm, when they were meant to go over the plans for the funeral that Saturday. Harry knew Draco probably wouldn’t mind Hermione. Still, he didn’t want to risk them running into each other.
“Before we open these,” Narcissa said, even as Draco began to pluck at the bow on his box. “I just want to say… You know why I’m upset, don’t you, Draco?”
“That would be great, actually,” he replied, relieved. She pulled him into a quick hug before pointing the way to their balcony. He thanked her, and she patted him on the cheek with a smile.
Potter’s smile fell just a little, a strange look in his eye as he ducked his head, looking down the path. “Oh, er, no, she, er… she’s at the Burrow for, er… for a bit.” He tried to fold in on himself, as if in doing so he could fold himself out of existence. But he had grown out of the small, slight boy he had been in school, had become a man with broad shoulders and a big laugh and bright eyes, unmistakeable. Draco’s bit his lip, his chest suddenly too tight. He reached out before he could stop himself, his hand sliding up Harry’s arm to squeeze his shoulder. Harry blinked and looked up, hope mixing with surprise as his smile returned. Draco smiled back.
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again. Draco smirked, triumphant. Harry scrubbed his face, pushing his glasses up into his curls. Finally, he let his hands fall. He couldn’t quite make out Draco’s expression without his glasses, but he did see a faint blush of pink in his pale cheeks.
But Harry was too fast for him. He snatched the toast right off Draco’s plate, but not before Draco smacked his hand and sent the toast flying down the table, knocking into Neville’s pumpkin juice. They both froze, staring like deer in the headlights at Neville. For his part, Neville only sighed and hung his head. Then he waved his wand and the juice went back into its glass. He gave them both a beleaguered look, but instead of sobering them, Draco and Harry broke down into giggles.
Harry cradled Draco’s jaw with one hand, wrapping his other arm around Draco’s waist. “You okay?” he asked in a hushed voice. “Be honest.”
“Of course, I just… Does this mean he’s the new head of Slytherin house?” he asked. She nodded stiffly. Harry shook his head. “Well, I can’t wait for the Gryffindor team to beat Slytherin to the House Cup this year, then. It’ll be just like old times, right, Minerva?” He raised a cheeky eyebrow, and McGonagall rolled her eyes with a smile.
“It says it is an unbreakable bond between two people,” she said slowly. Draco muttered, “Obviously,” under his breath. Harry kicked him under the table and Draco grimaced, dropping his hands into his lap. Hermione sucked her teeth before continuing with careful precision, “It also says that this bond exists from birth, but that the only way for it to become active is for the two people to, well, kiss. From then on, the bond only gets stronger. That’s why the Wizengamot passed the law in 1453 to allow for marriages to be annulled if one of the spouses discovers their soulmate outside of the marriage.”
Harry stood at the end of the table, looking into the booth. He held a bottle of beer loosely in one hand. His smile was wide and his green eyes flashed behind his glasses. His hair, a little shorter than it was ten years ago, was still a tangled mess. Draco hated that he knew what it was like to run his hands through that hair, what sound he could coax from Harry if he pulled at it just a bit. He looked him up and down, taking in the leather jacket on his arm, the pale blue shirt with the first two buttons undone, the charcoal grey trousers that fit him so well. Draco wondered if he still wore the same sneakers. Pansy looked from Draco to Harry and back, an evil smile at the corner of her mouth.
It was on one of these miserable days when Draco found himself on the familiar path to the church, his eyes and cheeks puffy and red from tears and the bitter wind. The next service wasn’t until the evening, and the church was almost entirely empty, save for the priest cleaning the altar and an elderly lady tottering down the aisle to the door.
“This is the same cat who left a dead mouse in one of my exes Valentino shoes,” he said, half to himself. Harry snorted.
“Do you mean that?” Draco asked, leaning forward slightly so that their faces were inches apart. He smelled like petrichor, wet clothes and Firewhiskey. Harry breathed him in, filling his lungs with
It had been five years since the war. He had a job, a place to call his own just outside the city, a cat named Scorpius who brought him dead moths as trophies. Every so often a partner would try to open him up, take a look inside – relationships are about give and take, Draco, one had shouted at him, and you never give, Draco, never! Draco didn’t shed so much as a tear. He simply sipped his espresso as the other man stormed out of his life, never to be seen again.
“Only if I can repay the favour,” Harry replied, his voice rumbling in his chest. Draco grinned, a wicked gleam in his eye.
He didn’t know what made him do it then. He opened the door a bit wider and let Potter in without a word. The other man was wary and cautious as he entered Draco’s home. It was six months since the trials, since his father was sent to prison and the Manor taken from his family. He knew Potter was the reason he wasn’t in Azkaban with his father, the reason that he was here in their family’s London townhouse with his mother rather than rotting in a jail cell for attempted murder and war crimes. Maybe that was why he led Potter down the narrow hallway to the kitchen. Maybe it was because he wanted to ask Potter why that he gestured for the other man to sit at the breakfast table nestled against the bay windows overlooking the garden, where the first signs of spring were peeking out amongst the frost. Maybe, he thought, as he waved his wand – the wand Potter had returned to him after he was released – to put the kettle on the stove, he just wanted to talk to someone.
“Well,” Harry said, wrapping his arm around Draco and relaxing against him, “at least it can’t get any worse than that, right?” Draco rolled his eyes and pulled him in closer.
“And you say I’m eloquent.” He smiled when Draco scowled at him but relented and said, “That wasn’t until recently. Well, a couple years, really.” Draco’s eyebrows shot up, and he quickly added, “I never thought I’d act on it! I just… thought about you a lot. Especially when Ginny and I started having problems.” He grew quiet for a moment, dropping his gaze down to his plate. Then he said, quietly, “Although, maybe, it’s always been there, and I just didn’t want to admit it to myself. And now… it would be easier if it was just a crush, you know? I thought, maybe, if I kissed you, I would get it out of my system – selfish, I know, but it’d gotten to the point where it’s been keeping me up at night and then you were looking at me like that and I just…broke.”
Harry nodded. “He’s in the living room,” he squeaked. Molly took a deep breath, her hands on her hips as the pots began stirring themselves behind her.
Draco inclined his head, but still didn’t look up. His fingertips traced along the serpentine form of a dragon eating its own tail engraved on the cover of the watch. When he remained silent, Lucius continued in a tone of forced cheerfulness, “We thought that perhaps it was time you settled down and find a wife.”
“No,” he said. A sardonic smile twisted Draco’s face. “I just told him I was getting drinks with someone. Honestly, I think he was just glad I was getting out of the house, so I let him come to his own conclusions.”
“It’s okay,” Draco murmured, rubbing soothing circles into his back. “It’s okay. They caught him.” But Draco’s voice broke, and his own breaths shuddered in his chest against Harry’s cheek. Draco buried his face in Harry’s curls, his tears warm against his scalp. They shook as they held each other as reality washed over them like the tide. Draco could bury his parents, and the man Harry had thought of as a brother for seventeen years was responsible.
“I cast a Warming Charm on it,” he added as Malfoy took the towel from him with a quiet, “thank you.” “Do you want anything to drink? I could make some tea, or would you like something stronger?”
Draco, Harry was relieved to admit, was on his best behaviour when they did finally manage to get coffee with Ron and Hermione. September was almost over, but the weather held out, and it was an unusually warm and sunny day as the four of them sat at an outdoor café. When Harry started getting twitchy about how many people were around, milling about them and passing behind their table, Draco reached over and put his hand on his knee, rubbing small circles with his thumb. Draco made sure to ask all about Hermione’s work with the Wizengamot, and their preparations for baby. He smiled, was polite, charming even. Ron, who looked like he had a broomstick up his bum the entire time, even began to relax a bit by the end. When Draco excused himself to go to the loo, Hermione let out a drawn out breath.
For their next ‘date’, Harry met Draco at his townhouse for tea. The place technically belonged to the Malfoy family, Draco explained once, but since Narcissa spent most of her time in France, Draco had co-opted it as his own. “Her only stipulation was that I not change any of the décor,” he said with a sad shake of his head. Which explained why Harry felt himself transported into the Victorian era as he toed off his trainers in the entryway. The walls were covered in a richly painted wallpaper, and as Draco led Harry back towards the kitchen, he caught a glimpse of a well-lit sitting room fit to be in a museum and a dark dining room, the polished surface an oak dining table winking at him through the shadows.
’ before he let himself make any noise. He put the kettle on to boil, set a few pinches of chamomile and lavender in a tea strainer and set it over his favourite cup before curling up in the bay window overlooking the back garden to wait. A mixture of pre-dawn light and the glow from the streetlamps out front gave a strange hazy look to the garden, like looking at an old photograph. He hadn’t smoked in years, but he suddenly had the itch, the need for a cigarette. “Stupid,” he muttered to himself, holding his knees to his chest. He knew better now.
Harry, finally getting a hold of his giggles and wiping away the tears gathering at the corners of his eyes, let out a long sigh and considered the elf with a smile. “Don’t imagine you have a lot of people laughing at you all that often,” he hazarded to guess. Draco let out a snort and looked away.
“Did you guys see that?” he gasped. But Ron and Hermione had uncovered a piano and were playing around on the yellowed keys. Hermione plucked out bits of
Harry straightened up. He crossed his arms over his broad chest as he appraised Draco, his lips thin. He nodded curtly. “Right,” he said. “I see. You’re happy, are you?”
Harry beamed. “Remind me to thank Pansy the next time I see her,” he said. Before Draco could tell him to not bother, that Pansy didn’t need any more ego-stroking, Harry had pulled him in for a kiss. It didn’t take long for the kiss to grow hungrier, more passionate, for Harry to crawl into Draco’s lap and tangling his own hands in Draco’s hair. Draco’s world was filled with him, cedar and black pepper, and all he could do was pull Harry in for more.
Harry, turning, noticed him standing there and seized his chance. He wiggled his way free of the tight clump of students to stumble out in front of Draco, whose look of wonderment was quickly wiped away into his neutral mask. Harry, however, refused to be daunted by it.
Malfoy snorted. Harry grinned. He glanced over at Malfoy – he had never been this close to the other man without punching him, or without a Stinging Hex distorting his vision. There was a delicateness to his features, sharp angles only softened by the curve of his pale lips, the brush of his dark blonde eyelashes, the gold glimmer here and there of stubble. Something stirred in Harry’s gut, and for the first time in a long time, it wasn’t panic. Malfoy noticed him looking and met his gaze with a curious smile. Harry blushed and looked away.
The room burst into chaos – elves jumping to their feet, blustering and denying all charges, each trying to be heard over the clamour of the others. Lord Rookwood stayed rooted to the spot, staring at his hands folded on the table. Baron LeStrange also said nothing, but unlike Lord Rookwood he leaned back in his chair, appraising the young king with an unreadable look in his cold black eyes. Harry glanced over at Draco. Their eyes met, just for a moment. Harry sucked in a breath as a shock went through him, like a spark flying from flint as it’s struck. Draco only smirked and turned back to the outraged elves.
“No, I promised I wouldn’t blame you if it did. It’s different, see?” Harry pointed out. He leaned back in his chair, stretching out his legs under the table. His boots nudged something – he suspected Malfoy’s foot – but he didn’t pull back. Malfoy shook his head, that faint blush blooming again over his cheekbones. “How have you been, Malfoy?” Harry asked finally. Malfoy shrugged and looked away.
“Ex-Death Eater,” Harry corrected him, almost automatically. Zacharias was not the only one to look surprised at Harry’s defence – Ernie and Neville both frowned at him as if he had just said the sky was green and grass was blue. Harry shrugged and did his best to ignore the uncomfortable tightness in his gut. “What?” he demanded. “He’s here, just like the rest of us. Give him some credit.”
The attendant led him from the antechamber down a lofty hallway to a set of great oak doors guarded by knights in the forest green garb of the Royal Guard. The attendant waved his hand, and the knights opened the doors, revealing the throne room in all its glory – sweeping pillars and buttresses that disappeared into vaulted ceilings enchanted so that stars winked down at Harry from inky skies, distant galaxies wheeling overhead; banners whose subjects frolicked with bearded unicorns on fields of finely woven wildflowers; black stone floors with a white marble inset that depicted the royal insignia, a crowned winged serpent ouroboros –
“Why do you think anything is going on?” Harry retorted, crossing his arms defensively. Draco almost rolled his eyes. Harry was a terrible liar. Even now, his blush was creeping up his neck, darkening his brown skin. His gaze remained level, but there was a nervous tightness at the corners of his eyes and the edges of his mouth. Ginny looked thunderous.
“What’s all this?” Draco asked. He set his robed down on a spare bit of counter not covered in discarded spices and utensils before pulling Harry in for a quick kiss.
Draco looked up when Harry came into his office carrying two bags of takeaway, which he proceeded to drop unceremoniously on Draco’s desk, right on top of his paperwork. Draco scowled. His report was going to smell like masala later. Harry frowned, and asked, pointing at the large tome open in front of Draco, “Isn’t that Hermione’s book on Bonding spells? I thought you gave that back. She’s on maternity leave now, you know, she won’t be happy if you don’t get that back to the library on time.”
Harry groaned and shoved his glasses into his hair so he could rub at his eyes. “But how can I apologise if I don’t know what I’m apologising for?” he demanded in an undertone once he repositioned his glasses. Hermione set her quill down and shook her head with pursed lips.
They had agreed when they adopted James that Draco could operate his potions consultancy from home, so long as Harry came home on weekends during termtime. And while he missed his husband, Draco had to admit, it was better than trying to raise a family at Hogwarts. They had entertained the idea the first few years of Harry’s tenure, when Teddy was still small, Draco was finishing his apprenticeship with Professor Williams, and they were recently married – but the number of times Teddy would wander off into the castle made them realise that it was a terrible idea to bring toddlers to Hogwarts. So they found this cottage, a Grade II listed building covered in wisteria deep in the Cotswolds. Draco began to build his client base, and Harry came home as often as he could. After a couple years, they adopted James, then Albus, then Lily. But of course, Teddy would always be their first born of sorts. Teddy, who was fifteen and watching his adopted father slice up tomatoes for the salad with a worried frown on his young, acne-spotted face.
Harry blinked. “Oh. Erm.” He pushed his glasses up with a slight frown. “It wasn’t working out,” he said, picking his words with care. “She and I just… weren’t compatible. She wanted more than I could give her, I guess. That, and she had started to see Luna behind my back, and when it all came down to it, cards on the table, we realised we loved the idea of us together more than we loved each other.” He let out a long, ragged breath. He was still holding Draco’s hand. Absent-mindedly, his thumb rubbed the side of Draco’s wrist, back and forth, back and forth.
Harry stepped back, letting go of Draco’s wrist. But Draco pulled him back with a hand on the nape of his neck. Harry, confused, frowned at him.
Harry shrugged. He held his hand out for his receipt. “He picked it, not me. If it ends badly, as I’m sure it will, I promise I won’t blame it on you.”
“Oh?” Draco asked, a punched-out gasp. The air was suddenly too close, too cold, his lungs unable to draw in a full breath.
“It is a hamlet, your Highness,” said Lord Rookwood, his words lilting with his heavy Elvish accent. “No more than… four, five homesteads?”
“I want to help you,” he said at last, “because I’ve realised that I care about you, Draco. I don’t expect you to feel the same, obviously. I mean,” he let out a hollow laugh as he looked away, back over the grounds towards the dying light, “how could you, after everything? But I thought you should know, seeing as everything is about to go to hell in a handbasket.” He looked down and kicked the toe of his shoe against the wall. “You can go ahead and laugh now,” he said, his brown cheeks blushing red.
Harry felt like Draco had kicked the wind out of him. Draco’s eyes fluttered open, and the look he gave him only made Harry’s knees shake. Weary and hopeless, the storm in Draco’s eyes threatened to wash him away. Then Harry’s stupid Gryffindor self-preservation kicked in. He set his jaw and raised his chin as he took hold of Draco’s other arm. Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“What gave you that impression?” he asked. He tried to keep his voice as nonchalant as possible, even as his heart raced against his ribcage.
Malfoy sighed. He pushed himself up into a seated position on the edge of his bed, his elbows against his knees. He stared at his hands for a moment, as if gauging how much to tell Harry.
“I’m sorry,” he said softly. “I shouldn’t have come. It was late, and I’ve been such a mess, I’m sorry.”
Draco strode over to him with a beaming smile. “That’s great!” he said, his outstretched hand wavering over Harry’s upper arm. But if Hallowe’en was when Draco was the most solid, Beltane was when he was the most incorporeal. His hand fell back to his side, the smile no longer reaching his eyes. “Which one did you get into, Edinburgh or London?”
“A strange concept, but it’s true,” Draco interjected, his lips quirking into a teasing smile. Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco, reeling, sat back in his chair as he let Pansy’s words sink in. “Wait, you said they were both in love with someone else? Who’s Har – I mean, Potter with?” He hoped she would chalk his slip up to the alcohol, but the way her eyes narrowed told him otherwise. His stomach sank, even as a small piece of him waited with bated breath for her reply. Not that he expected Harry to go and proclaim his love for him to the world – it had been years. Not just since
Malfoy pressed his lips together, his smile growing small as he shrugged and looked away. “Ah, well, that’s a long story.” He sighed, shifting so that he once again had his back against the wall. “As I said earlier, I had a client who ordered a specific potion – I can’t tell you what, client-Potion Master confidentiality – but it required powdered Erumpent horn. Now, I tried to substitute it for something else, but I couldn’t get it to work, so I began to scour the markets for powdered Erumpent horn. Nothing.” He stretched his legs out in front of him with a slight scowl. Harry thought that would be the end of it, but after a deep breath, Malfoy launched into a fast-paced story that, if his arms weren’t bound, Harry was sure would have included elaborate gesticulations.
“But you have to focus on yourself first,” Harry murmured. Teddy nodded. Harry rubbed his godson’s back, his hand brushing the knobs of the boy’s spine, the sharp juts of his shoulder blades.
“Boys!” Hermione heaved herself to her feet, bracing her weight against the table. Ron reflexively reached out to support her, but she waved him away. “You both are being ridiculous. Now please stop shouting.” She rolled her shoulders back and levelled her glare first at Harry, then at Ron. “How about this, then – Harry, you bring Malfoy along to coffee next chance you get, and we’ll get to know this new Malfoy, all right?”
Ron scowled but relented with another ‘humph.’ When he bent down to try to get Rose to eat another bite of mushy peas, Hermione caught Harry’s eye and gave him an apologetic smile. “Sorry about him,” she mouthed. Harry smiled back and shrugged to say, “It’s Ron, it’s fine.” She nodded with a sigh, but just then Rose spat up all her mushy peas, and she had to whisk her toddler away to clean her up.
“Fair enough,” Harry said, “but I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t hesitate to jinx Malfoy, whereas with you and me he didn’t have a choice, he had to be civil.”
“I refuse to ruin another pair of trousers,” he said when Harry frowned at him. Harry’s pupils were blown wide with lust, his hair even more of a mess than usual, and Draco couldn’t look away from the erection straining the front of Harry’s jeans. He knew exactly what it felt like, what it tasted like, and gods he wanted it in him as soon as possible. “Bedroom,” he said. “Now.”
“That was different. They made that choice for me,” said Draco. “And besides, in this case, you have something I could never have – you are the bloody Chosen One, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, Saint fucking Potter.” He smiled crookedly at Harry’s little huff of annoyance at his accolades. “Yes, what they did was shitty, but you have a chance here to make some real change.”
“We’re wizards, you gorgeous dolt.” He pulled out his wand from his pocket and cast a Warming charm around them, enclosing them in a bubble of warmth.
There were other scars. Scars from potions exploding and spells backfiring. Scars from fist fights and from duels. Scars he could hide and scars he could not. Then there were the ones inside of him, all those from lessons he was forced to learn. Those were the easiest to cover up, the hardest to acknowledge.
The kettle whistled. He poured the hot water into the cup and was about to sit back in his spot when the door opened. Startled, he spilled some of the hot water, barely avoiding getting any on his nice bathrobe.
Harry glanced at him. Draco had grown impossibly pale, as if he was turning into a ghost before Harry’s very eyes. Harry worried his lip and rubbed Draco’s hand with his thumb. Draco closed his eyes at the touch. His shoulders rose and fell as he took a deep breath. Harry wanted to tell him that it was going to be alright, but just as he opened his mouth to speak, Dumbledore turned back to them and returned to his chair behind his desk. If he noticed their joined hands, he didn’t say a word.
Pansy smirked. She curled her legs under herself, content to watch the show. A flustered Draco was far more interesting than the Dostoevsky she was working her way through. The potted plant on their fireplace had begun to levitate shakily as Draco turned on his heel for another lap, and the empty cups on the coffee table were starting to lift up into the air.
“Well, at least we’ve told them. Have you told your friends?” Harry asked pointedly. Draco frowned. “Oh come on, after all that earlier and you haven’t told your friends?” Harry threw up his hands as Draco looked away. “Merlin’s tits, Draco! Seriously?”
Draco pulled a face. “Daphne? I thought she was engaged to that French duke,” he spluttered. Harry could see him trying to regain a foothold in the situation, the crease between his brows deepening with his frown.
“I don’t want my family’s money, alright?” Draco snapped. He covered his face with his arm, sighing irritably. “I- I couldn’t get a job after I finished my Potion’s Master certification, no one would hire me because they couldn’t be seen taking in fucking ex-Death Eaters, and…” He lowered his arm. Harry had turned on his side, watching him with wide eyes – he wasn’t wearing his glasses, and gods he looked so much younger without them. Draco looked away. He bit his lip, even as the words he never wanted to say began to fill his mouth.
“You can’t be serious,” he said with his old drawl. Harry, who was helping the other teachers decorate the Great Hall with tinsel and evergreen branches, frowned at Draco where he sat perched on top of one of the dining tables.
Harry scoffed. “Because you’re gorgeous,” he said, like it was obvious. “I think you made a mistake taking the Mark, and you did some horrible things when you were a kid.” Draco knew this was all true but couldn’t see where Harry was going with it. “But like I said, we get to be ourselves now. And I want to get to know you, and I want you to get to know me, and I really, really want to kiss you.”
“What are you reading?” he asked. Draco moved to hide the book, but Harry was faster. He snatched it from him with his Seeker-reflexes, his expression teasing and curious as he flipped it over to read the spine. “
Draco sighed. “Just business,” he told the empty room. He reached out for his evening glass of wine and downed the rest of the dregs. He stood and walked over to the sink, placing his empty glass in the basin. He would wash it later. For now, he was tired and confused. Tomorrow, he would see Potter to discuss the case, and what will be, will be. With this Zen outlook, he started to get ready for bed.
“I care about you,” Harry told him, pressing another quick kiss to the top of his head. “That’s all that matters in my book. All I need is to know that you care about me too.”
“Okay,” Harry said, grinning back at Draco. “I’ll come back soon. Hallowe’en, you said?” Draco nodded as Harry backed away towards the door, not wanting to look away just yet. “I’ll be here. I promise.”
“There better not be any spiders,” he grumbled, wiping the snot away with the back of his hand. Hermione, the girl, rolled her eyes, her bushy hair bouncing as she looked over her shoulder at him.
He didn’t finish his warning in time. Harry swallowed him down before pulling off and sitting back on his heels. Only then did Draco notice him palming the bulge in his own trousers. Draco, caught in the afterglow, moved as if his limbs were caught in syrup, almost drunkenly. He sat up and undid the fastenings on Harry’s trousers even as he kissed Harry messily on the mouth, tasting himself on Harry’s tongue. His hand dove in and pulled Harry’s cock out, stroking it hard and fast until Harry came, moaning into Draco’s open mouth.
“Looks like I’m good at sucking cock after all,” he said, half to himself. Harry, still shaking from his post-orgasm high, laughed.
The train doors closed. Harry sat down by the window, and watched the countryside pass him by. In the distance, he could just make out the dark ruins out in the valley, but within seconds, it was gone.
“How are you holding up?” she asked. She searched Harry’s face, her hands clutching the cup in front of her.
“I forgive you. If I’ve realised anything over the past few months of living with you, it’s that you’re growing. You’re becoming a better person than you were. And I like who you are becoming.”
Sirius led him into the wilderness, a fortnight’s journey from the bustling city Harry had known all his life, to a town by a wide, dark lake nestled in the foothills of great green mountains. A castle stood on an outcropping by the lake, its tall towers and glittering lights a beacon of hope to the weary travellers. Sirius pointed at it as they stood at the edge of the lake, staring across the water at the castle.
“I am the king, you know,” Draco sneered, looking up darkly. “I should be the one calling the shots.”
Harry slipped his hand into Draco’s as he saw the shine of tears in Draco’s eyes. Draco bit his lip, looking down at the gift in his hands, and gave Harry’s hand an acknowledging squeeze. After a long pause, he whispered, “Thank you, Mother, for clarifying that.” Narcissa smiled tenderly at her son.
“Explain,” he demanded. Pansy lifted one shoulder in a shrug. She pulled her wand out and levitated a small, almost identical velvet bag out of the empty vase on the mantle piece that she had always said was purely ‘decorative’ and forbade Draco from putting flowers in it. Now he knew why.
Immediately, the darkness in Dumbledore’s lined and wrinkled face disappeared, replaced with his benign smile.
Harry chuckled darkly as his fingers left Draco. A crackle of energy grazed Draco’s back as Harry wordlessly summoned something. Draco turned his head to look back at him. Harry saw him looking and grinned, all teeth and feral eyes. He stroked his cock slowly as he tore open the condom packet with his teeth. Draco whimpered, almost coming just at that.
“And whose fault is that?” Draco sneered. Lucius glared at him, but Draco pressed on, his newfound confidence overruling any sense of filial piety. “Besides, I’m seeing someone. We’ve moved in together. His name is ­– ”
“No, we understand,” said Hermione. Both of their faces had grown pale and serious, snapping to attention immediately. “We’ll keep the channel open and send Kellen through as soon as possible. Is there anything we can do to help?”
Malfoy stood, his shoulders hunched and shaking, bracing himself against one of the porcelain sinks. He could just make out Myrtle’s spectral form as she tried to reach out a consoling hand. He hadn’t realised how thin Malfoy had gotten – from where he stood, he could see how his usually well-tailored clothes were baggy and ill-fitting, the belt cinched tight around his narrow hips, his shirt hanging off his shoulders. His sobs racked his body violently, threatening to tear him apart. Harry bit his lip. His rage gone, he could only stand there, uncertain and ashamed. This was not what he had expected to find.
Harry had to remind himself to shut his gaping mouth. Malfoy straightened up, pushing his hair back with a sweep of his hand, a faint blush in his fair cheeks. “What I mean is,” he continued, “if there is a perfect bodyguard, it’s the Saviour of the Wizarding World.”
There was no way it would last. Wrapped up in their bubble, knowing no one else could understand what they had been through better than each other, they were happy. Their friends didn’t fully get it, but generally opted to look on in bemusement. Ron insisted he’d ‘jinx the ferret’ if Draco tried anything funny, and Pansy promised Harry that if he hurt Draco, she’d hurt him more. Since she’d been waving a particularly sharp knife as she chopped up vegetables for their dinner, Harry took her very seriously. But at least from their friends they knew it came from a place of love.
“Yes, exactly. That was it. Nothing else.” He smoothed the front of his button down, and Harry noticed Malfoy bite down on his lip, pulling it into his mouth, as if he was holding back his words.
“I hadn’t told anyone else besides… well, you. It is not exactly something that we talk about, and… you saw how well my friends think of… people like us.”
“What don’t you want him to know?” Harry probed cautiously. Malfoy let out a mirthless laugh. He looked up at Harry, his grey eyes expressionless.
“Your cousin and his friends,” Draco echoed, unconvinced. “They, what, tried to teach you how to dance or something?”
Harry and Draco exchanged a glance. “Because I’m dating Harry Potter?” Draco said tentatively. Narcissa rolled her eyes.
Draco didn’t know what he should have done when the war ended. After he was exonerated, thanks to Harry’s testimony. After his father went to Azkaban and never came back, his proud head hung low. After he found an apprenticeship at Gringotts, where no one asked too many questions, and moved to London to escape the silent haunting of the Manor, where he couldn’t sleep without seeing the bodies, the blood, without hearing that high, cold laugh. Should he have reached out to Harry? Asked him over for tea like they were old friends? Would he have asked after Harry’s fiancée, feigned a smile at the ring on his finger? More likely he would have broken down, knowing for certain that he had lost everything after all.
Ron waved him off. “I owe you one anyway,” he pointed out. When Harry looked confused, he clarified, “From putting up with me and Lavender back in sixth year. I can see now that was an unholy nightmare for everyone.”
Draco tried to school his features to hide the disappointment on his face. Not that Potter was looking at him, but just in case. He nodded, and mumbled, “Yeah, right, you’re right.” Without another word, they walked back together towards Gryffindor Tower. And if their shoulders brushed from time to time, if their fingers reached but never touched, no one would know.
“My apologies, it’s been a long day. Who are you?” he asked, as politely as he could. The woman’s lips twitched, just a hint of a smile.
“How many people do you think they told?” he asked softly. Harry bit his lip. He sat down with a sigh next to Draco.
“You don’t seem very excited about the party,” Draco pointed out in his old drawl as he perched on the windowsill next to Potter. The other boy jumped, but relaxed when he saw Draco, giving him a quiet smile before turning back to the window.
Draco didn’t say a word. Instead, he pulled Harry against him, leaning back against the armrest and letting Harry snuggle up against his chest with his feet tucked up on the cushions. He held Harry there with one arm, his other hand running through Harry’s curls as he peppered kisses on the top of his head, his forehead, his nose. Harry took off his glasses so that they didn’t dig into Draco’s chest, and Draco took them from him, put them carefully on the end table next to the sofa. For a long time, they were quiet, just holding each other. Draco breathed in the smell of Harry’s damp hair and warm spiced cologne, his exhale ruffling Harry’s hair. Harry absentmindedly played with the tie of Draco’s bathrobe.
Parkinson seemed to realise too late that he had bitten off more than he could chew. He looked at something over Harry’s shoulder and blanched. From behind him, Harry could sense several of his teammates at his back.
“Straight people,” he grumbled under his breath. Harry’s eyebrows shot up. Draco, noticing, winked at him and added with a crooked smile, “Present company excluded.”
“What do you mean, you remembered? How is that possible?” Draco asked, half under his breath, as if asking the universe rather than Harry. Harry bit his lip as he tried to think of a way to prove what he had seen. Then, he straightened up and said,
“Well, because….” Lucius cleared his throat and sat up straighter in his chair, his hands coming to rest in his lap. “Your mother and I have been talking. Your freelance work has been incredibly successful, and you’ve made quite a name for yourself. Your potion designs for the medical field are particularly noteworthy.”
Draco blinked. In that moment, the comfortable confidence was gone, a mirage blinking out of existence, and there was the little boy Draco had met all those years ago in Madam Malkin’s, small and thin with his owlish green eyes wide behind his broken glasses. He looked up at Draco, and there he was, too, the sure-footed eleven-year-old who had thought he knew how the world worked. He felt them both reach through time and space to grasp each other’s offered hands at last – starting over.
When they reached the stone gargoyle guarding Dumbledore’s office, Draco was surprised how easily Harry gave the password. He raised his eyebrows at the smaller boy, who shrugged.
Dawkins shook himself. Suddenly unable to meet Harry’s gaze, he turned and began waving at the officers guarding the prisoner. “Right, right. You lot know the drill, let’s get this man back to the department.”
Harry shook his head with a gentle smile. He fished out the charmed cuffs from the pocket of his cloak, but before he put them on Malfoy’s bony wrists, he paused, a strange light in his green eyes. “Would you?” he asked. “Try to overpower me, that is. Make a run for it.”
Harry reached up now. Draco pulled back a centimetre, an instinctive flinch, but relaxed as Harry’s hand came up, his thumb pressing gently into the space between his eyebrows, smoothing away the crease. Absentmindedly, his fingertips traced the contour of Draco’s temple, the sharp line of his cheekbones, the soft curve of his lips. Draco gasped, but didn’t pull away. Harry’s heart jumped into his throat and it was all he could do to breathe normally, especially when Draco looked at him with those wide grey eyes. Harry, emboldened only by the fact that Draco hadn’t yet pushed him away, cradled Draco’s jaw. He searched the other man’s face for any sign that he might hit him. All he found was that indecipherable look.
Charlie laughed good-naturedly. “And proud of it,” he said. “I’ve gotten enough to deal with rescuing dragons to settle down.”
He looked up then. Draco had never used his name before. Even he looked surprised at himself. Harry’s mouth instinctively twitched into a smile, but it died on his lips as he found his voice.
They laughed. Harry pulled back, but not before giving Draco a quick kiss on the forehead. “Okay then,” he murmured. “One step at a time.”
At this, Harry snorted and shook his head. “Wish I could have been there to see it,” he mumbled. He turned to face Draco, one leg propped up on the couch. “Why are you here? Really?”
Harry took hold of Draco’s hands where they rested in the other boy’s lap. Draco bowed his head, his whole body shaking as his tears fell on their joined hands.
Draco rolled his eyes again. In doing so, he could have sworn he saw Potter blush. Something about that made his stomach twist. He cleared his throat and said, “You didn’t have to, you know, defend me and my mother. Not after everything.”
Draco opened and closed his mouth. His heart came to a full stop for a moment before restarting at a sprint. For once, Logic had nothing to say.
“Because when you do it, you’re a bloody menace, but when Hermione does it, she’s a professional. There’s a difference,” he replied. Draco glared at him. Harry rolled his eyes and gave him a quick peck on the cheek as an apology. Draco ducked his head against Harry’s shoulder so that Hermione didn’t have to see him blushing. Hermione, meanwhile, watched their little interaction with a sceptical look, her lips pursed.
, he scrawled, trying to fit the words into the small bit of free space left. Hermione read this and frowned. She crossed her arms over her chest, her fingers tapping against her upper arm as she thought.
Draco finally broke away. He leaned his forehead against Harry’s as they both caught their breath. Draco looked up at him through his lashes, his grey eyes twinkling as he grinned. They didn’t know which one started giggling first, but once they started it was almost impossible to stop. Harry buried his face against Draco’s shoulder to smother his gasps of laughter while Draco rubbed his back with one hand, his own laughs bubbling out of him in surprised hiccups.
Harry nodded. He watched the man leave, weaving his way through the crowded café. There was a small twinge of regret in his gut – Harry had to admit, the man looked good in those tight trousers, and Hermione had been so keen for this date to go well. In the end, however, they simply had nothing to talk about. Harry shook his head and reached for his drink, only to remember that his cup was empty.
“Oh.” Harry was glad it was dark so Draco couldn’t seem him blush. Based on Draco’s smug smirk, however, he saw it anyway. But then Draco was pushing up the hem of Harry’s jumper, and Harry was pulling it off, tossing it next to his glasses and Draco’s wand on the bench. Then he was unbuttoning Draco’s shirt with fumbling fingers, and Draco, grinning and trying not to laugh, was helping him. Then, it didn’t matter if Harry was blushing, because Draco was blushing, too, and it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
“You planned this, didn’t you?” Draco seethed. “You never really wanted to be my friend, you just want to keep an eye on me, to spy on me!”
Harry shuffled his feet as he gestured behind him. “Are we bringing Malfoy in as well? Because if we are, I don’t think an
“We will make it look like you succeeded in killing me that night,” Dumbledore continued, as easily as if they were discussing the weather. “You will escape with the other Death Eaters and become a double agent for the Order. Everything you hear, every plan and every word, you will report back to us. It is crucial that you not be caught. Do you understand?”
“Hmm. Noted,” Draco said with a grin. But all too soon, his grin faded, and the worried crease formed once again between his eyebrows. “So, are you going to tell me why the living room looks like you dropped a Muggle bomb in it?”
“You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to,” Harry murmured, his earnest eyes warm like summer. But Draco shook his head and forced a smile.
Ginny stood. They all looked up at her apprehensively. “Well then,” she said, her voice forcibly placid. “I won’t be needing this anymore.” Without another word, she pulled off her engagement ring and set it on the table. Then she turned and, tossing a pinch of Floo powder into the grate, disappeared into the green flames.
Harry inevitably gave in and let Draco haul him the last few feet to the bedroom. He took a moment to look around – “Nice room,” he said, and Draco shrugged, more intent on pulling him towards the queen-sized bed in the middle of the room. The room was spacious enough, with tall ceilings and large windows that overlooked the narrow back garden, nothing like the Manor’s grounds but enough. But Draco hadn’t bothered to decorate it much, so the room had a strangely empty feel to it, like a hotel. Not that he was thinking about décor much at the moment.
Father Nicola laughed. “I used to be,” he replied. “Now, I am just Nicola. Please, take your time, explore the church. There’s not much to see, but what is mine is yours.”
“I tried,” he said, voice so quiet Harry had to strain to make out the words, “years ago, to get rid of the Mark. At least, that’s what I told myself, at the time. Mother found me, the last time.” He pointed at one scar that, unlike the rest, ran vertically along the curve of the snake, almost hidden by the writhing serpent. There, the skin was raised, puckered pink against black and white. He let out a hollow laugh. “She heard me fall over and when she knocked and I didn’t answer, she burst into the bathroom where I was, a bloody mess on the floor. When I came to, hours later, all bandaged up and bundled away in my room, she slapped me and called me a drama queen.” He ran his finger up and down the scar with a watery smile on his trembling lips. “I hadn’t known my father had just done the same thing in Azkaban. Except he did the job properly. She had only told me that he had died, she hadn’t said anything about….” He wiped at his nose with the back of his hand, tried to rub away the tears slipping down his cheeks. “Gods, I was so stupid,” he muttered thickly, trying to smile. “I don’t know why I’m telling you this, it’s not the time nor the place, the first time you see me with my shirt off and I’m blubbering like a baby.”
Malfoy began to help himself to toast and jam as conversation resumed around him. Harry caught McGonagall’s eye. She nodded pointedly at Malfoy with a raised eyebrow. Harry huffed but leaned forward to get Malfoy’s attention.
Hermione and Ron were relieved to see him. Harry tried to ask how they were, how little Rosie was, but they blustered through it. “We’re just so glad you’re okay!” Hermione gushed. “When we got your letter, we were so worried, you’ve never done anything like this before – ”
Draco sat down in a pew at the back, tucked himself against the cold stone wall, wishing it could swallow him up. If he disappeared, maybe the task would go unfinished, maybe his family would be spared. But he knew that, if anything, the task would go to another, and his family would be punished all the same. He sighed and watched the priest smooth out the runner on the altar, rearrange a bouquet in a vase, polish the candlesticks with a cloth.
to know – fine, Draco, I waive my grievances towards you.” She drew something in the air and added, “I bless this relationship, as strange as it may be. Now, please, never tell me about your sex lives, ever.”
Draco pushed Harry away. Harry stumbled backwards, startled. “So what’s this, then?” Draco demanded, anger flaring hot in his chest. “Just some last-ditch hook up before you go running back to her?”
“He trusts me with some things. Not everything.” Harry grew quiet. He remembered the way Dumbledore had brought him along to convince Slughorn to come to Hogwarts, how he had been glorified bait for Dumbledore to use as he wished. He had promised Harry he would let him in, would teach him how to defeat Voldemort. But something told him that Dumbledore was never going to tell him everything he was planning – it was the same voice in his head that had pointed out Dumbledore’s wariness around him last year, the same voice that insisted in the dark late at night that he was alone, utterly alone, and that things were better that way. If he was alone, no one else could get hurt.
“I didn’t get a good look at him,” he admitted. “He – He was wearing a cloak and his hood was up, and he wore a mask that covered his face. But yes, I think it was a man. He – He turned his wand on me, and I – I Disapparated.” The biscuit dropped from his hand as Malfoy covered his face, a sob torn from his chest. “God, I’m such a fucking coward, I didn’t even try to save my own parents!”
Harry and Malfoy both started. Harry cleared his throat while Malfoy refreshed his monitor and mumbled out something that sounded like, “what can I get you?” Harry ordered his cappuccino and a macchiato for his date. Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
“No, no, God, no, it’s because Harry is like my brother and I just don’t want to hear about my brother having sex, alright? Christ on a bike, I’m just going to go. Oh look, I think Ron just got home, I’ll talk to you later, alright? Unless – Harry, do you want to talk to Ron?”
“I’m sorry for missing tea yesterday. Mother Floo’d and – Father has been really sick recently – had, had been – you see, he….” Malfoy trailed off. Harry saw his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed, hard. Malfoy closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. “Father passed away. Yesterday morning. Pneumonia. They could have treated it if he were anywhere but Azkaban.”
Then Harry was pulling him in for a kiss, and Draco was tangling his fingers in Harry’s hair, their heart beats colliding against each other. Later, Harry would see Draco’s toothbrush next to his, and the next morning he would find Draco’s extensive mug collection in his cupboards, and he would know. This was the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. And when Draco came down, with his bedhead and pillow marks still on his cheek, Harry would smile and wrap his arms around him as Draco made his morning coffee. He never wanted to let go.
Kellen raised her perfectly manicured eyebrows, shooting a mirth-filled glance over at Harry, who ignored her as he set the French press on the kitchen table with an extra mug. “Inconvenient?” she asked innocently. “How do you mean?”
So when he saw Malfoy run out of the Great Hall, he made his excuses to Katie Bell, finally back from St. Mungo’s, and hurried off to follow him. This was it, he thought, his heart pounding in his chest, anger thrumming in his bloodstream. He was going to confront him, once and for all. When he lost sight of Malfoy, he pulled out the Marauder’s Map, and found his little dot hiding out in one of the boy’s bathrooms, of all places, right next to Moaning Myrtle. He set off, planning his speech, his list of charges and accusations, his fists clenched, his book bag bouncing against his hip as he ran. This was it.
“Merlin, Hermione, let the man speak!” Ron interjected at last with a laugh. He wiggled his finger free from Rose’s clutches so he could rest his hand on Hermione’s shoulder, a silent reminder for her to breathe. He turned back to Harry with a grin. “We haven’t seen a lot of other adults recently. Well, other adults who aren’t parents as well. We just started Rose at the new wizarding preschool, so you can imagine.”
“Draco Malfoy is in my kitchen,” he mumbled to himself. He made his way through the kitchen and rummaged in the pantry for some bread and cheese. Draco held his cup to his chest with both hands, watching Ron as he cut himself a couple thick slices of bread and cheddar, wary and waiting for the inevitable. Finally, Ron sat himself down at the kitchen table and took a bite of his snack. Mouth full, he asked, “So it’s true, then? You’re soulmates.”
“Just twenty, not twenty hundred, you git,” Draco snapped. Harry stifled a snort, and Draco’s eyes narrowed. “For your information, I am two hundred and twenty-seven, which is regarded as a perfectly respectable age among my people, and it’s not like I’ve been living within the confines of these walls all that time, I will have you know I go outside…sometimes.”
Harry smirked. He rubbed the back of Draco’s neck, pushing his fingers through the short blond hair. “Hey. Don’t let them upset you this much.” When Draco raised an eyebrow at him, Harry gave him a crooked smile. “You use more contractions when you’re upset.”
“Right, him. You told him that, and I quote, ‘if you want a job done, you do it yourself, and you do it as quickly and thoroughly as possible.’ Now, we can’t let Sir…”
“I’m sure she would,” Malfoy replied with a smirk. “I imagine it’s bigger than the entire Weasley house.”
Malfoy choked on his tea. Harry laughed as Malfoy tried to mop up his mess while trying to keep a straight face. Malfoy shook his head, chuckling to himself. “What about you, Potter?” he asked after he managed to straighten himself up and Harry had gotten out his giggles. “Can’t imagine dating as a professor is particularly easy, given the small dating pool, even if you are the Chosen One.”
Draco only believed him a few nights later when he himself woke to Harry’s screams. He rushed over to Harry’s bed, and found himself in almost the exact same position. He didn’t hesitate, though. He gripped Harry’s shoulders, calling his name until Harry woke up with a gasp. It took a moment for recognition to dawn in Harry’s eyes, and he sat up, Draco’s hands still on his shoulders.
“Don’t like her as much as you want to,” Harry finished for him. Teddy nodded, his hazel eyes wide. Harry gave him a sad smile. “I get it, I really do. I dated someone before Draco – ”
“We can’t keep going like this,” Harry said as they sat across from each other, backs against opposite armrests, legs tangled together while they balanced takeaway curry on their laps. “If this keeps up, neither of us will be able to leave the flat, and that’s not living, that’s house arrest.”
“Harry.” Draco’s hand came up to cradle Harry’s jaw, to bring them eye to eye. Harry’s pupils were blown so wide they swallowed almost all trace of green, like a new moon on a starry night. “I already said yes.”
Harry blushed. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “I was just….” He looked up at Draco, whose expression had gone cold and blank. Harry swallowed. “I’m sorry,” he repeated. “I overstepped.”
“I didn’t even know they were together,” Draco murmured. Harry and Hermione both let out soft, weak little chuckles.
Pansy’s expression softened. She stepped in front of him, planting her small hands on his narrow shoulders. “Draco,” she said, “I’ve seen you grow up these last few years. I don’t think you can lose who you are again. You’ve fought too hard to find yourself in the first place. You’re not eighteen anymore. You are Draco fucking Malfoy, and nothing and no one is going to change that, not even Saint Potter. You hear me?”
Draco stood frozen in the doorway. He swore under his breath. With Potter looking like that, there was no way he was focusing on the case today. Potter must have heard him. He looked up from the papers in his hand and grinned at Draco. Draco tried to pull his usual sneer, but it came off as more of a half-hearted smile as he forced his shaky legs to walk him over to the chair opposite Potter’s desk. He sat without a word and reached for the steaming coffee waiting for him.
Draco searched Harry’s face for any hint of deception. Finding none, the fight seemed to leave him all at once. He slumped forward, his head bowed as he stared at their joined hands. “All right,” he said quietly. “I’m a dead man anyway.”
“God, I love you,” Harry sighed. They both froze as they simultaneously realised what he said. Draco pulled back to look at him. Harry swallowed. “Er, I mean…”
, the notes slightly out of key. Harry turned back towards the doorway, his green eyes narrowing. Without another word, he walked out into the hallway.
“You know,” Ron said, rubbing at his nose, “Ginny’s not up there bawling her eyes out over this.” He pointed up at the ceiling where indeed no sound could be heard besides the ghoul in the attic. “She’s having lunch with Hermione in our house right now while we’re talking. She knew you two would be dropping by, and yeah, she’s pretty cut up about the whole thing, but I’ll be honest with you, she’s relieved too. They both knew they were struggling, but they’re both too bloody stubborn to do anything about it. I think they thought that getting married would save their relationship, that it was the only way to fix things. This just gave them the universe’s blessing to finally end it.” He rolled forward, setting the chair back onto all four legs as he braced his arms on the table. “Listen. What I’m trying to say is – it’s okay. It’ll take some time for people to get used to the idea, that’s all. “
Harry slapped Draco’s shoulder with a teasing scowl. Draco yelped but conceded. “Right, sorry. But… are you sure?”
Ron threw his hands in the air with a strangled noise of protest. Hermione shook her head, a small, pitying smile on her lips.
He had given up, then. That is, until a man came to his aunt and uncle’s house, claiming to be his godfather.
“Why did you want me to see those?” Harry asked. He crossed his arms across his chest, searching the other man’s face. Draco gave him his one-shoulder shrug.
Pansy hugged him tight when he reached them. “I’m so glad you came!” she squealed. Draco smiled and hugged her back before pulling himself away to say hello to Blaise.
The door to his bedroom opened and there was Draco, wearing Harry’s bathrobe. His pale blonde hair was rumpled from sleep and there were pillow marks on his cheeks. He leaned against the doorframe, blinking blearily at Harry, who smiled up at him.
Draco looked his boyfriend up and down, frowning with confused concern. “Why are you so… bubbly?” he asked. Harry laughed. Now Draco was really concerned.
“You see this? I am savouring my breakfast, not inhaling it like some animal. Just because I haven’t eaten my toast yet doesn’t mean I’m not going to.”
Draco nodded slowly, looking up at Harry with an incredulous smile. “I’m not dead,” he said. Harry shook his head with a silly grin plastered on his face.
“Always so elegant,” he sneered, but there was no malice in his voice. He even let go of Harry’s hand in order to pass him a serviette, muttering, “Honestly, you’d think you were raised by animals.” Harry grinned and shook his head as he took the serviette from Draco. He wiped his mouth, nonetheless.
Silence fell between them. The house creaked and groaned around them, old bones settling deeper into the earth. Draco looked close to tears. Harry’s chest rose and fell with each sharp breath. Then Draco got to his feet.
No matter how many years he spent on the force or the number of crime scenes he visited, he never got used to the sight. It didn’t help that the scene was splattered in blood, or that Harry knew the victims, but it especially didn’t help that Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were dead, in their own home.
“Alright,” Harry said in an attempt to assuage the distressed elf. “Alright. I had to ask. Now, I just have one more question, then I’ll let you go.”
“Run,” Draco hissed through his teeth. Harry looked from him to the group and back, his brow furrowed.
“Not like this, mate,” said Ron simply. He held the door open for his friend, concerned confusion in the twist of his mouth as he looked at Harry hesitating on the driveway. “I don’t know what it is, but it’s like you’re missing something. I think you’ve been gone too long.”
Harry looked up from his ministrations with a small frown. His eyes were lust-blown, almost entirely swallowed by black pupil. His glasses were smudged and sat a bit crooked on his nose. “Then why did you stay away for so long?” he asked.
Harry looked up in surprise. He pushed up his glasses, a nervous habit Draco had noticed over the past week. “Why do you ask?”
Harry stood, pulling Draco with him towards the bed, helping him out of his still wet clothes along the way until he was only wearing his pants. They tumbled onto the bed, tangled together, all kisses and searching hands. Draco sucked a love bite into the curve of Harry’s neck, and Harry threw his head back to give him better access, all the while grinding up against the other man, desperate for friction. Several more love bites later, Harry pulled Draco back up for a deep kiss, if only so that he could flip them over and pin the other man beneath him. He pulled away. Draco looked wrecked, his pupils blown wide, his hair a mess, his cheeks flushed and his lips bruised. They both tried to catch their breaths as they stared at each other, waiting for the other to move.
“To be fair, I was spying on you at the time,” Harry pointed out. “And besides, I think I did more damage later that year.” He brushed Draco’s collarbone through his button-down, the scars hidden by ink, fabric and a very ugly pillow. Draco tried to shrug and smile it away, but his lips trembled and he clutched the pillow tighter.
“Why not?” Harry asked, jaw set but voice soft. “Why can’t you give this – give us, one more try? We can make it work, do long-distance if you want.”
Harry scoffed. “Fuck that,” he said, eloquent as ever. “Listen, let’s try my idea first, and if it doesn’t work, we’ll both run away to Iceland.”
Draco came up behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, pressing himself flush up against him as he leaned forward, nuzzling into the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry shivered despite the stifling warmth of the kitchen.
“I could work in a different part of the Ministry,” Harry mused. “But the idea of getting stuck behind a desk for the rest of my life is…not great. To be completely honest, what I would really like to do is teach.”
“I didn’t say anything about you calling me anything,” he replied, choosing his words with care. Harry’s eyes widened as this sunk in.
“Think about it,” Draco replied. “We apologised to each other, Granger should get the chance to do the same.”
“I’m not crying, you’re crying,” Draco mumbled. He wiped the offending tears from his eyes with his palms, looked away with a ragged sigh.
Draco had been to Harry’s place before. He knew to take his shoes off in the entryway so as not to dirty the polished hardwood floors. He knew that Harry had painted the walls by hand and that the toilet on the ground floor screamed when it flushed – Bill Weasley had apparently offered to clear out the curse that was stuck in the pipe, but Draco knew Harry kept it because it scared his guests and made him laugh. He knew where each picture hung up on the walls was taken and with whom, because Harry had told him each and every story. He knew these things, not because he spent much time in Harry’s house, but because he remembered everything Harry had ever told him, and the house was just as much made of Harry as it was of brick and mortar.
Harry sighed and set his toast down. “Well, it’s like I said the first night,” he reminded Neville. “The war’s over. And the only way we recover from it is we forgive each other and move on. Draco’s paid his price. No use asking him to continue paying for his mistakes, or the mistakes of his parents.” He pushed his plate away with a shrug. “Besides, once you get past the prickly outside bit, he’s not bad, actually.”
Something in Draco’s expression flickered and died, growing distant and closed off. He didn’t look up from the watch as he asked archly, “Why is that, Father?”
Draco’s stomach dropped even as his heart raced, as if he had taken a nose-dive on his broom. “And,” he cleared his throat, “will you tell them….”
Harry scanned the room assignments, his duffel bag at his feet. “Potter, Potter, Potter,” he mumbled under his breath as he went down the list. Then his mouth dropped.
“Oh.” Draco took a step forward, his gaze still fixed on Harry, afraid that if he looked away, the dream would end. “And why do you want to do that?”
Harry closed his mouth, but his mind still spun. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, gay? The strangeness of the situation crashed into him as he stared at Malfoy. He blinked as a thought crossed his mind.
Harry looked at her beseechingly, but she only gave him a sympathetic smile in return. “I’ll leave the book with you for now, but I will need it back soon, I’m on maternity leave in two weeks and I need to have it back to the Ministry Library by then. Call me any time. Harry. Malfoy.” She inclined her head towards Draco before she, too, grabbed a fistful of Floo powder and stepped through the green flames back into her and Ron’s cottage.
Draco pursed his lips and nodded. It had been a week since that day in Harry’s kitchen, a week of processing and tip-toing around while their new reality sank in. “Your mother wasn’t convinced,” he said conversationally. “Apparently your wife’s eyewitness testimony to the Soul Bond spell wasn’t enough, so we’ve been running the gambit of Mrs. Weasley’s practical tests.” He grimaced, remembering how only an hour earlier, Mrs. Weasley had locked him in the toilet while Harry hid somewhere in the house, the idea being that soulmates always find each other no matter what. It took three tries before Mrs. Weasley was satisfied that Draco wasn’t just getting lucky. “She’s currently testing the theory that we can feel each other’s pain.”
“Nope,” Harry replied triumphantly. “Although, to be quite honest,” he added, turning his head to press his lips against the shelf of Draco’s ear, “I quite liked it.”
“That’s okay, it’s just the fireplace, there isn’t a fire in it, it’s okay. Harry, focus on my voice, alright?” He waited for Harry to nod, for his eyes to open again, their green depths swallowed by black pupils. Draco bit his lip. He reached out and took Harry’s hands in his, gripping them tight. Harry froze for a moment. Then, as Draco began to stroke the back of his hands with his thumbs, he saw Harry’s shoulders relax, his eyelids lower. “One more thing, okay?” Draco said gently. “What can you taste? Just one thing.”
Luna answered ‘truth’, which made Padma roll her eyes. Evidently she had been hoping for a ‘dare’, if only to show how the game was played. She asked Luna an easy question – ‘have you ever been caught sleepwalking?’ – to which Luna smiled dreamily and replied, ‘not yet.’ Then it was Luna’s turn, and the game rolled on. Draco didn’t pay much attention. A younger him would have loved to get the dirt on some of his classmates, the perfect material to tease and bully them with. Now, he couldn’t care less. He kept looking over at Potter, who was staring at a fixed spot next to his foot, a shadow haunting his expression. Then, Hannah Abbott called on Potter.
Harry pressed a palm against the cold stone behind him. “Stone,” he said, his heart rate beginning to slow. “Sheets.” He moved his hand from the wall to the sheets as if to check that they were real. “Pyjamas.” He plucked at his pyjama bottoms. Then, he reached out to touch the headboard. “Wood.”
“I told you. It is not a total disaster. We get on just fine,” he heard Malfoy reply. It sounded like he was holding back a laugh, but not the kind that Harry was used to hearing from him. He sounded earnest. “I barely see him, really. He’s always out practicing or with Weasely.”
Harry sighed, scratching at his scalp. “You know I can’t tell you that,” he said with a resigned smile. “I can’t really tell you much at all, really, other than I’m, you know, happy and healthy and sane.”
Draco’s eyes filled with tears. “How can I possibly prove that?” he asked, his voice choked. Harry shook his head and got to his feet, pacing up and down the drawing room. None of it made any sense and yet – it all felt like he had heard it before, as if it was a lullaby he could only remember the melody of. A dull ache began to build in his forehead, right where his scar split across the brown skin like white lightning. He rubbed at it, trying to push away the pain, but it only got worse.
The king opened his mouth, closed it, then sputtered, “The border between Avalon and Ængla has not changed since the Great War!”
Harry led him to the kitchen and gestured for him to sit down as he put the kettle on for tea. Malfoy sat at the edge of his chair, his back ramrod straight as he craned his neck to take in his surroundings. Harry had to stifle a chuckle at Malfoy’s expression. This was a victim, a potential witness – this was all part of the case, he couldn’t lose sight of that. Not even when he was making Draco Malfoy tea in his kitchen.
“I… well… hm.” Hermione stood up, her book forgotten on the chair. Her lips were pressed into a thin line as she looked from Harry, red-faced and confused, to Draco, who swallowed hard and looked everywhere but at her. “I hate to say it, Harry,” she said at last. “But you have to be kidding. Draco Malfoy? Of all people?” She gestured at him as if he weren’t standing in front of her. Draco blushed furiously and opened his mouth to protest, to defend himself, only to realise that he agreed with her. He pulled himself away from Harry. Harry only looked more confused, his brow furrowing as he tried again to reach for Draco. But Draco shook his head.
. Even as his heart gave a little jump and skip of hope, he shot it down. He forced himself to put the phone down on the table, to let go. He leaned back in his chair and ran a long-fingered hand through his silvery hair as he thought.
“So teach,” said Draco, pressing a kiss to Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sure you’d be wonderful, and everyone at Hogwarts would love to have you.”
“Well, he’s delightful,” said Kellen. Her gaze met Harry’s, and they both immediately burst out laughing.
Harry’s brow furrowed as he moved to put his phone back in the pocket of his leather jacket. “God, I wish,” he said, the words out before he realized what he said. His eyes widened. “I mean, what? No, that was Malfoy. He’s helping me on a case.”
After they showered and dressed, they only had fifteen minutes to get to the dining hall and grab something to eat. The hall was practically empty by the time they got there, so they relaxed a bit, and went about grabbing pieces of toast and fruit to take back to the room. It being the last Sunday before term, most of the students were either having a lie in or were else playing out on the grounds where snow had settled in a thin layer on the grass. Needless to say, they didn’t run into too many people in the halls on their way back. Harry, in either a moment of insanity or bravery, bumped up against Draco and slipped his hand into Draco’s. Draco froze and made to pull his hand back. But Harry held firm. He looked up at Draco, his jaw set.
“Yeah, probably,” Draco admitted. He rubbed Harry’s back. “But I’m legally allowed a break, so you’ve got, oh,” he cast a quick
Harry laughed. “I promise not to say a word about it,” he replied, leaning in to give him a quick kiss on the corner of his mouth. Draco heaved a sigh of relief.
“Oh?” Malfoy raised an eyebrow, eyes narrowed as he tried to figure out if Harry was being serious or not. His finger traced a small circle on the paper as he asked, “What could you possibly want to know?”
Malfoy shook his head, his lips pressed into a thin line, and waved Harry away. Harry frowned. He knew better, however, than to try and bother him any further. Something about Malfoy’s furrowed brow kept him in the room, though, instead of going to find Ron or spending his one day off in weeks somewhere else. He grabbed a book from his shelves and flopped onto his bed to read. But with Malfoy pacing in the corner of his eye, he couldn’t get past the first few sentences.
“You forget, Potter,” Draco pointed out, taking hold of Harry’s hands in his, “I’ve been here before.”
Malfoy chuckled. “Not that it’s any of your business,” he said, “but the Ministry hasn't quite gotten around to making it legal for ... people like me to get married.”
There was a loud crack, and Robards’ office window shattered. Harry squeezed his eyes shut. He was definitely going to get fired.
“Are you alright?” he asked. Draco took a ragged breath, tried to force a smile over his rattled nerves.
works upstairs, Long can date women half his age who are barely legal and bring them to the office parties without so much as a reprimand, but I mention I have a boyfriend and you give me a
“Mr. Potter,” boomed a voice just behind Harry. He jumped and sat up, turning towards the voice. His stomach dropped.
Practice had run late into the night that Saturday. Harry, exhausted from training, was looking forward to taking a shower in the ensuite before collapsing into bed. As he reached the door to his and Malfoy’s room, however, he froze. From the sound of posh accents and clipped laughter, Malfoy had friends over. Friends like him, rich snobs who would trip Harry as he passed them in the halls and shout insults at him in the dining hall. Harry pressed himself up against the wall in the hallway, listening intently.
“You never saw them together,” Harry pointed out, a ghost of a smile at the corners of his mouth. “When they saw each other in the Shrieking Shack back in third year, it was like – like they were finally whole again.” His voice trailed off, his eyes growing distant again, retreating back into his thoughts. Hermione nodded.
“I really know how to choose them, don’t I?” he asked his cat. Scorpius looked up from his breakfast to blink his green and amber eyes at him, as if to say, ‘Obviously’. A large fluffy brown tabby that Draco suspected was part Maine Coon, part Kneazle, Scorpius never warmed up to any of Draco’s partners. He once joked to Pansy that Scorpius had better taste in men than he did. Pansy had only shaken her head pityingly. She had her own theories as to why Draco’s partners never lasted long, and it had nothing to do with his judgemental cat.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, his voice rough from suppressed desire. Just the sound made Draco want to weep in frustration.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s shoulder through his shirt. “Love you too, you git,” he murmured, just to see Harry smile.
Draco found him sitting cross-legged in the middle of the living room, at the epicentre of what looked like a small nuclear explosion. Picture frames lay snapped on the floor, the sofa had been blasted into the wall, and every shelf in the bookcase had snapped, spilling books everywhere. Harry stared into the empty fireplace, his face blank as he turned his wand over and over in his hands. Draco set his messenger bag down as quietly as he could and approached Harry the way one would a wounded lion.
“Wonder what his name is,” Harry murmured, now carefully investigating the bald patches on the owl’s body and the feathers missing from the tail. The owl gave another hoot, disgruntled at Harry’s poking and prodding. “I’m sorry,” he told the owl, “I just want to have a good look at you. Someone’s not been treating you right. Looks like you’ve been pecked by some other bird half to death, haven’t you? Poor thing. No wonder it doesn’t want to go back.”
“What are you so surprised about?” he asked, a cold edge to his voice. “That there’s such a thing as an amicable break up, or that I’m gay?”
Harry’s laugh startled him. He looked over with a scowl, but Harry’s face was so gentle, his crooked smile so comforting, that Draco couldn’t help but smile back.
The first week of October came with a sudden chill. The sun slowly began to rise later and later. Then, one day, Malfoy came down for his early morning tea, and Harry was sat on his sofa. Malfoy froze, brow furrowed as he looked from Harry to the two cups of tea on the table and back again. Harry smiled crookedly up at him and set his book down in his lap.
“You sure about that?” Draco asked, one eyebrow raised in challenge. Robards did not reply. He shot Draco a dirty look, then turned on his heel and stormed off towards his own table. All four of them watched him retreat like an enraged bull in black military dress, before letting out a collective sigh of relief.
When they went through, dusting the ash from their clothes as they stepped into Malfoy’s flat, Harry explained, “We have to be in and out, so just grab what you need.” He looked around, his wand at the ready. The officer guarding the flat nodded at him from his post beside the fireplace, and Harry nodded back.
But Harry turned and vaulted through the open window. The minute his feet touched the ground, he took off running, Draco’s voice calling his name echoing in his ears. He didn’t look back.
Malfoy nodded slowly. “Sure,” he said. “You’ve already saved the wizarding world once, we shouldn’t expect you to keep saving it just to pay the bills.”
Harry chuckled. “I like the way you beg. But unfortunately,” he pressed a kiss against the love bite blooming on Draco’s shoulder, “I need you to get up so I can take my trousers off.”
“And who do you think attacked Draco when he was sixteen? When, mind you, he was still at Hogwarts, and recently marked as a Death Eater?”
“Bloody hell, Draco,” he said, voice just above a whisper. “And I thought I used to be on your bad side.”
“No,” Draco interrupted, shaking his head. “No. Your place. Besides,” he added with a rueful smile, his lips and chin still covered in blood, “all my stuff is there.”
Draco came just in time to hear Blaise swear and toss a velvet bag of coins at Pansy through the fireplace. She caught it with ease, grinning ear to ear. “Thanks, babe!” she purred.
“Are you really fine with it?” Draco asked. “All of it? After everything I’ve put you and your family through? With Harry not marrying your sister? With him being with me? All of it?”
“I think you’re lying,” Harry said huskily. He brought his hands onto Draco’s thighs, giving them a gentle squeeze through the thin fabric of his trousers. Draco reminded himself to breathe. Harry’s hands rubbed up and down his thighs, his thumbs dragging deliciously along his inseam. His gaze flickered between Draco’s grey eyes to his pink lips as he licked his own lips. “I think you do like what you see. Quite a bit, if I’m not mistaken.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. He pressed a finger to his lips, shaking his head. Harry found himself lost for words, drowning in a wave of emotions he couldn’t process fast enough – relief, anger, confusion, fear. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm – bony, but there, real and warm in his grip.
and stood, one hand fluttering to her belly. “You two talk it over. Harry, you know what you have to do now.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m here, aren’t I? Besides, you try to put a five-year-old to bed while getting ready for a da- for drinks.”
Potter stared at him as if he had turned himself into a teacup. “Yes, I did,” he said in the same tone he would use to explain a rather simple truth to a rather simple child. “Your mother saved my life. She knew I was alive, but she lied to Voldemort so that she could get back to the castle and find you.”
Draco spluttered and scoffed, his face aflame. “I’m sure I have no idea what you mean!” he stammered. Ron’s shit-eating grin split across his face.
Harry fell to his knees in the empty room. He called Draco’s name, over and over again, until it became a lament, a prayer, a whisper. There was no one there to hear him. He buried his face in his hands, rocked back on his heels, and wept.
“I don’t understand,” Draco said, his voice choked. “I thought… I thought you actually liked me. But I must have been wrong.”
Harry shrugged, resting his chin against Draco’s shoulder. “Don’t want to talk about it,” he mumbled. “How was yours? Figured out the solution for that potion thing?”
Harry lowered the phone, shaking his head with a smile. The sun hung low in the sky in the late summer evening as he sat at a circular table in the beer garden of a pub overlooking the Thames. Ron and Hermione had gone to the bar to order the next round of drinks. Neville, who was visiting London before going back up to Hogwarts for the start of term, was deep in conversation with Ginny about her upcoming wedding. She had her arm on the back of her fiancée’s, Luna’s, chair, absent-mindedly playing with her long blonde hair. Luna, meanwhile, looked over at Harry, cocking her head as she considered him.
“I want it gone,” Draco mumbled. Harry let go of his arm in order to turn Draco’s face towards him. He gave Draco a smile so soft and tender, it made his heart swell and tear all at once. Then Harry leaned forward and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips before drawing back, his thumb wiping away the tear tracks on Draco’s cheek.
“I know it’s my turn, you knob.” Draco let out a long breath as he leaned heavily on his forearms, staring at the board with distant eyes. “I – I wouldn’t want to intrude, and I’m sure the Weasleys wouldn’t want me there, after everything my family and I have done.”
Malfoy gave the cat a curt bow, his frown like an apostrophe in the curl of his lips. “I am… confused,” he said at last. “Humphries… is a cat? A Kneazle?”
“Don’t worry, Potter,” he said as he picked up his phone and made for the door, “I know you prefer the athletic type.” He looked over his shoulder and, seeing Harry once again slack mouthed in shock, grinned like a satisfied cat and winked at him.
get into for selling it, you know? So he scrapped it. Says he’s been working on something recently, but won’t say what. You know, I haven’t really seen much of him recently, but Fred Junior’s apparently quite the handful so I imagine he and Angelina have had their plates full with that.”
was the one who got us into this situation, not you! What the hell do you mean, you wanted to give me the option? What option? I chose
Potter considered him with a sad and thoughtful look. He seemed to think over his response as he poured the tea for both of them, adding far too much milk for himself. “People keep asking me that,” he said, in that same soft and low voice. “For everyone else, I don’t have an answer, because I have no idea what they’ve been through. I’m eighteen, I’m not a prophet or a messiah, I’m just… Harry.” He gave a ghost of a chuckle at his words, as if startled by a memory. “But for you…I think maybe I know a little bit about what you’re going through.” He looked up at Draco, his hands gripping the cup of tea that surely was too hot to hold. “You and I… we need to learn who we want to be, not who we’re expected to be. I’m going back to Hogwarts this fall, finish my last year, get my NEWTs, spend some time figuring out what I actually like besides fighting dark wizards. What do you want to do?”
And yet, here he was, standing with his front paws on Harry’s lap, shoving his face into Harry’s as Harry pet him, looking more than a little taken aback. Scorpius’s purrs were deafening. Harry looked up at Draco who still stood frozen in the doorway, holding the tea tray in absolute consternation. He shrugged.
Draco looked up from the book he was pretending to read when he heard the knock on the door. He frowned. Had Pansy forgotten something? She had been by earlier that night, commiserating with Draco over a bottle of wine older than both of them combined. It had been a week since the fiasco at Potter’s, and while he had insisted to Pansy that he was
“Does it still hurt?” he asked in a soft tone. Harry shook his head again with a half-hearted smile.
Draco nodded. Harry’s heart beat beneath his palm, and he knew he was telling the truth. He could see the scars on the back of the other man’s hand –
Harry nodded. “Sometimes I wake up from a nightmare and can’t remember where I am,” he said. “It takes me ages to calm down again. Do you get those?”
They both jumped when something vibrated beneath them. Draco wiggled his hand between them and pulled out Harry’s phone, which lit up with a series of texts from Ron. Harry swore. He’d forgotten about Ron. He tried to snatch the phone from Draco but he just held it out of his reach as he read Ron’s texts out loud.
“There’s a difference?” Harry asked, his voice muffled against the woollen fabric of Draco’s dress robes. Draco shrugged. He stepped out of the embrace, one hand coming to intwine with Harry’s as he pulled them back towards their seats, smiling the entire time. Harry grinned back. He knew what everyone would say behind their backs, what they were already whispering across the atrium, but he didn’t care. Later, he would frame the frontpage photo of him and Draco kissing in all their finery and hang it over the mantle piece in their – yes,
Kevin shrugged, not awake enough to care. “If we do, I’m screwed,” he replied. “I haven’t written anything.”
Draco wanted to yell, to scream, that of course it would come up, that Ginny had probably already told her family everything. He wouldn’t be surprised to go back to his flat and find a Howler from Mrs. Weasley burning a hole through his floor. Instead, he murmured, “Alright.”
“Oh, no, he’s still a git,” Harry reassured her. Draco scowled and kicked him in the leg. “Ow! Merlin, it was a joke,” Harry hissed at him.
“It’s fine, really. Nothing I haven’t heard before,” he said, his voice just above a whisper. He heard the rustle of bedsheets and looked up in time to meet Malfoy’s gaze over the wall as the other boy sat up in bed.
“I’m sorry I haven’t told them about you,” Harry said, reaching out and giving Draco’s hand a squeeze. “If you want, we can Floo Ron and Hermione together this evening. And if that goes well, would you at least consider coming to the Burrow on Christmas?”
Harry woke up with a start. He sat up, drenched in cold sweat, and looked wildly around the room, one hand already reaching for his wand on the bedside table.
“Sweetheart, have you met us?” Draco asked with a soft smile. “If anyone understands complicated, it’s us.”
Harry let out the breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. He let go of one of Draco’s hands only to bring it up to Draco’s face, wiping away the tears with his thumb. Draco leaned into the touch. Here, he didn’t have to pretend, didn’t have to hide. When Harry pulled him to his feet, he did so shakily, as if he wasn’t sure his legs could take his weight. Harry watched him warily as he picked up his discarded wand. Maybe it was the way Draco swayed as he stood that made Harry lace his fingers with his, made him give his hand a squeeze as he led Draco out of the bathroom and into the deserted hallway. Classes would be ending soon. They would have to move fast if they didn’t want to be seen.
“Of course something like this would happen to you all,” she said, lowering herself carefully into a chair. The book slumped open, its spine bending back on itself, a gasp of dust expelling from the pages. “I have good news and bad news.” She looked up, levelling her gaze at each of them in turn. “The good news is that I’ve been doing some research on Bonding spells and curses for a case, so I do have some information on soulmates here.” She tapped the page in front of her, which was covered in dense text and elaborate diagrams. “The bad news is that there isn’t very much on soulmates because they’re so rare.”
Malfoy chuckled. “Yes, Potter,” he said with a tired smile, taking a sip of his tea. “Not much for witty repartee are you?”
“Okay,” Harry said at last. “That’s okay. We don’t need to. Maybe one day we can try, but if you don’t want to, we don’t have to. I’m willing to explore as much as you want to explore, and if kissing and touching are all you want to do, then that is all we will do. If you want to try more, we can. But we don’t have to. Okay?”
Harry ran a hand through his hair, turning the mess of curls into a veritable rat’s nest. He needed to get it cut, but it was always such a hassle. Finally, he said, “I actually haven’t really dated anyone since I took this post. I saw a few people after Ginny, but then I was an Auror and life was… hectic, to say the least. So, I guess, how did you put it, I’m more queer in theory than in practice.”
But Draco had already turned away. He forced himself not to run up the stairs to the boy’s dormitories, not to slam the door like a petulant five-year-old. No one else was up there yet, but he still clambered into his four poster and drew the curtains tight around the bed, casting a hurried
Malfoy waved him off. “I know you’re an Auror,” he said, as if revealing a dramatic secret. “It’s in the job description to keep an eye on ex-dark wizards.”
Draco, meanwhile, was still processing the news. Harry watched him as he sat beside him, placing mugs of tea in front of them. Under the table, Harry reached over and gave Draco’s knee a squeeze. Draco blinked, as if taking in his surroundings for the first time.
“For the last time,” Harry snapped, anger rising in his chest, “I didn’t know you worked there! And you were the one who talked to me after! And you said yes! You picked the time, the place, everything! You could have said no – so why didn’t you?”
They stared at each other for too long, drinking in each other like men dying of thirst. Malfoy lifted his chin. Still proud, even after all these years.
“You’re right,” he said. “I was a coward. I was everything you accuse me of being and more. I was pretentious, stuck up, and self-centred. And I can honestly say that if I was still all those things, Harry would not only remind me every day – ”
ran, the death threats stopped. Not all at once, but gradually they became more half-hearted and less explicit until the last one showed up attached to a scraggly looking little owl on Draco’s doormat. All it read was – ‘I’ll kill you if you hurt him.’ Draco scoffed.
“I didn’t even want to be here in the first place,” Draco grumbled petulantly as he got to his feet, dusting the ash from his knees. “I’ll be in your office, then.”
So Draco got up and stripped down to his pants as Harry watched, a disbelieving grin on his face as he watched like a starving man at a feast. A serpent wound its way up his right leg, its fangs digging into the top of his thigh. He turned, his cheeks pink, as Harry stared, then suck in a gasp.
“I didn’t know you were gay, Parkinson,” Ron said, raising his voice to carry down the hall. A few more students poked their heads out of their doors to see what all the commotion was about. Parkinson went from white to scarlet.
It was over before Harry could process what happened. Draco pulled back, already trying to move out of Harry’s arms, already stammering, “I shouldn’t have done that, Merlin, I must be going mental – ” But Harry didn’t give him a chance to finish. He pulled Draco in for another kiss and didn’t let go.
“Oh, I’m sorry, your Highness, by all means, call away,” Harry retorted. “I’m not the one who’s been lounging about a palace for the past twenty hundred years.”
“Later,” Blaise continued, his soft voice pulling Draco from his memories, “my cousin came back, looking like he’d run through Hell. My aunt was so relieved to see him that she didn’t ask where he’d been. I think she was afraid he’d say he’d been with the others, causing trouble. I haven’t heard from them since.”
“Oh, you know,” he said smoothly, “a little bit of this, a bit of that.” He took another sip of his coffee. Harry stifled the urge to roll his eyes. “Just got back from France,” he continued as an afterthought. “Mother sends her regards.”
As he turned to go, Harry stopped him with an outstretched hand. He’d meant to go for Malfoy’s elbow. Instead, his hand caught Malfoy’s hip, fingers pressing just above the waistline of his trousers. Malfoy’s cheeks burned red. Harry tried to ignore the way his stomach flipped over itself at the dark look in those grey eyes.
“Time – Time moves differently for my people,” the king murmured. He continued to stare at the map in a daze. “So – so what you’re saying is – what has changed, then? I have had no reports except those from the towns and villages on this map, as far as – as far as I am aware.”
“Like that, do you?” he murmured. Draco nodded, biting his bruised and sore lips to hold back a moan as Harry’s warm fingertips traced the outline of his nipple. Harry trailed sloppy kisses along Draco’s jaw and down his neck, mouthing at the skin as his fingers worked to unbutton Draco’s shirt. Draco leaned his head back, exposing his neck, his grip on Harry’s hair tightening as he let himself enjoy the pleasure of the moment. Merlin, if his family saw him now… best not to think of that as Harry sucked a hickey above his collarbone. Harry pushed Draco’s shirt off his shoulders and it cascaded to the floor, forgotten. When Harry’s fingers returned to their ministrations to Draco’s nipples, Draco let out a slew of swears and curses, his voice high-pitched and breathy. His hips bucked up against Harry’s. They both moaned as they ground together, Harry resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder, trying to catch his breath.
Father Nicola laughed. Draco could hear him grinning as he said, “Before you ask, no, I haven’t met him. I don’t think he would mind, but my family would be scandalised if their disgraceful Squib son met the great Nicholas. We do exchange Christmas cards, though. He’s the only one who knows where I am, and he’s happy to keep it that way.”
“Blaise of House Zabini told me,” Draco cut him off. An elf, who must have come in after Draco and thus went unnoticed by Harry, emerged from the shadows behind one of the guards. His skin was a rich, dark chestnut, and he held himself proudly, a noble born and bred. Lord Rookwood balked, his eyes bulging out of his skull. “He is one of my most trusted informants,” Draco continued. “I had him ride to Kirkton yesterday – it’s not far, less than an hour by horseback. He spoke to the constabulary there, and they had a lot to tell him.” He raised a thin eyebrow. Lord Rookwood’s skin took on a greenish hue. “So tell me. Why are my advisors lying to me while my people are dying?”
There it was again, at the end of the hall – a flash of white. Harry followed it, past portraits of regal men and women with cold grey eyes, down towards the main entryway. There was the front door, paint peeling and cracked. Across from it, a grand staircase with gilded balustrades, the steps lined with red velvet carpet, faded now and worn bald down the middle. Harry’s eye caught a flurry of movement at the top of the stairs, and this time, the white flash had a form – a young man, tall and pale. He didn’t think. He ran up the steps.
“Fine by me,” Draco said curtly, all the time never taking his eyes off of Parkinson. Parkinson started to back away towards his group, who appeared to be growing more confused and uncomfortable under the weight of the onlookers’ gazes.
“The straws don’t lie.” Harry was obviously trying to keep a straight face. He was right, though. There was his straw next to Draco’s, a perfect match. Draco tossed his into the fire and strode off towards the dormitory tower.
“You should at least have mentioned it in the report card – oh, he’s five years old, likes custard creams, is allergic to cats and
Draco stared at the phone in his hand. He swallowed hard. Luna’s distant voice played over and over in his head –
“Never knew what to say,” he mumbled. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry scoff and shake his head.
“I like Tolkien,” he said. He forced the suitcase closed, then pulled a small hold-all out from under the bed and went to retrieve his toiletries. Harry shook his head. He didn’t know what made him do it, but he took all three books, shrunk them, and shoved them into his jean pockets, only to find that it made his jeans look suspiciously bulky. He frowned and tossed them into the hold-all instead. Maybe Malfoy wouldn’t notice.
And gods above, if Draco’s heart didn’t melt at the glowing radiance of Harry’s grin, then he was a Flobberworm.
“Oh, I’ll show you how much I liked it,” Draco assured him, his eyes glinting mischievously. But then he sobered up, and took the hand holding his chin in his. “There’s one other thing,” he said, “we should probably talk about.” He stretched out his left arm, revealing the Dark Mark staining the skin of his forearm. Harry looked away, trying to swallow past the lump forming in his throat at the sight. Draco sighed. “I knew it,” he said under his breath. “You still can’t stand that part of me, can you? Even after all this time.”
Harry shook his head, his eyes wild, his grip tightening, holding Draco close. “No,” he assured him, “no, I promise, I just want you. Only you. Please, just listen to me.”
“It’s accurate,” Draco mumbled, fixing his gaze stubbornly on Harry’s collarbone. Harry rolled his eyes.
“I love you, too.” Draco leaned in and gave him one last kiss. “Few hours, okay? I’ll even stop by my flat and raid Pansy’s liquor supply, I know she’s been holding out on me and she has back to back shifts at St. Mungo’s so she’ll never know.”
“No,” Harry protested, but his voice was disbelieving, broken, all the anger washing out of him as he sat back down heavily in his chair. He held Draco’s hand in both of his, searching Draco’s pale face for an answer, any answer. “Please, you don’t have to go through with it, we can find another way.”
Distantly from the first-floor toilet, he heard Draco shout back, “No one is on time to a gala, babe, calm down.”
Draco took a long, deep breath, his hands twisting as they hung between his knees. “So,” he said, his voice so quiet that Harry had to strain to hear it, “on the seventh of August, a Tuesday, I went up to my room and… I ended it.” He bowed his head. His shoulders shook as he tried to breathe deeply, evenly. Harry wanted to reach out, to put his hand on Draco’s shoulder, but it was useless. So he sat, and he waited, and he listened.
“One of these days,” Draco murmured into the shell of his ear, “I will get you back for leaving me alone in that weasel den for the better part of an hour.” Harry trembled as Draco nipped his ear. He didn’t think he would mind whatever Draco had planned for his revenge.
“I was just wondering if… you know, you could stay in my room again tonight? I know, it’s stupid, I just… I keep seeing his mask, and my parents….” He bit his lip again to hold back the words. Harry’s chest squeezed tight around his heart, his expression softening.
Parkinson scoffed. “What’s gotten into you, Draco? Why are you defending this pouf? He’s just a f*****.”
Then he pushed it back over to Hermione with a pointed look. She read his note, her mouth dropping into an ‘oh’. She picked her quill up.
Harry pulled out his phone. Parkinson raised an eyebrow and opened his mouth to say something. Harry, however, was already dialling.
“Come in,” he called. When he looked up from his notes, there was Malfoy, leaning against the doorframe. Harry was surprised to find that the self-satisfied smirk was gone. He couldn’t quite figure out Malfoy’s expression – if he didn’t know better, he would’ve said it was longing. But no, that couldn’t be it.
Malfoy jumped. “W-water’s fine,” he stuttered. Harry nodded and filled a glass from the tap before sitting down opposite Malfoy at the long kitchen table, placing the glass in front of the other man. Malfoy drank greedily. Harry frowned as he took a closer look at him. Malfoy’s clothes were clean enough – simple grey button-down and black trousers – but they were wrinkled and rumpled. He was thin, his cheekbones sharp, and dark shadows bloomed under his eyes. His hair was not styled, and to Harry’s surprise there was a gentle wave to the white-blonde locks. Malfoy set the empty glass down and met Harry’s inquisitive gaze, his eyes hollow.
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose with a smirk. “Sure,” he said, drawing out the syllable as he relaxed back into his chair. He shook his head with a chuckle. “You are full of surprises, Draco.”
“Yes,” Draco said without hesitation. Harry set his glasses back in place, throwing Draco’s face into high relief. His jaw was still set in a defensive line, but his eyes had softened as they searched Harry’s face. Harry sighed.
Harry looked down at his hand, at the forked heart and life lines on his palm. He traced the shape of them with his fingertip, trying to remember Luna’s words from that night. “Your lives were connected,” he said at last. “Our lives. Maybe that’s why you’re here. There’s no Draco Malfoy here, in this world, besides you. Maybe this is the universe’s way of reconnecting us.” He glanced at Draco through his thick black lashes, his heart pounding at his sternum as he tried to gauge Draco’s reaction. Draco opened his mouth, closed it again. Harry continued tentatively. “People become ghosts when they have unfinished business, right? Well, maybe the unfinished business is something to do with us, with your Harry and me. Maybe something you always wanted to tell him, but never could. Something you always felt but could never do anything about.”
“Well,” Potter continued, jabbing his pen at his note, “I bet they’re getting them from this market for cheap. How else would they be able to produce so much of the potion without a large stock of the stuff? And they couldn’t replace it with anything because you said it was one of the few ingredients they couldn’t swap out, right? So….”
“Really, that made the list?” Harry deadpanned. Ron glared at him, and he sighed. “No, I know all that. But he’s apologised a million times over for what happened, and for Merlin’s sake, we were kids! And he served his time….”
“Apologies.” Draco knelt down beside Harry. Looking Teddy dead in the eye, he said slowly, “I’m your cousin once-removed on your mother’s side, which means my mother is your grandmother’s sister and your mother is my cousin which means – ”
Draco blushed. “Er…well, there was one about five years ago, we had been dating a while, and she, er, did technically meet him.”
Potter jogged up to him. His hair was wind-tousled, his golden cheeks pink from the cold but not nearly as ruddy as Draco’s, and he was wearing an awful large hoodie and baggy grey joggers. Draco tried not to appear as out of breath and sweaty as he knew he was. Potter grinned at him, green eyes twinkling behind his glasses, which did nothing to help Draco’s racing heartbeat.
“Fine.” Harry couldn’t help the way his lips were already twisting into a smile, even as he tried to fight it, digging his teeth into his bottom lip. “I didn’t promise anything anyway.”
It was a little while, however, before he heard the squeak of bedsprings and the rustle of bedsheets. Harry stared at the wall as he laid on his side, trying to get his racing heart to settle down. Never let it be said that Malfoy wasn’t full of surprises.
“In my room at Hogwarts. With you.” Harry looked up at Draco through his thick lashes with a ghost of a smile. Draco smiled back, pressing their joined hands against his cheek.
