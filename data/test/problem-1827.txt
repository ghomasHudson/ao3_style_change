‘You’re nice to me.’
with one of the very people he’d held captive in his dungeon. Even as she watched, Luna turned to look up at him and say something and she watched the way, for the tiniest of moments, her words seemed to crack the cold expression he wore. His lips twitched and there was no mistaking the fondness in his look when he glanced down to meet her gaze.
‘You have no idea what you’re talking about,’ Draco informed Ron with ice in his voice and turned his attention to Hermione telling her in a short-clipped tone how Pomfrey had taught him exercises to strengthen his muscles after he’d practically wasted away after Azkaban.
Harry wouldn’t lie to him. He couldn’t. That didn’t mean he wanted one of the first things he said when Draco finally woke to be that Astoria was coming back.
‘Salazar, yes.’
‘How long before I never have to take it?’
‘Do you ever get the feeling Luna is the scariest person we know?’
‘I didn’t,’ he admitted.
‘Are you under some kind of spell?’ Weasley demanded.
It was bad enough some of those changes had made their way to Kingsley’s office, although not so bad that the interim Minister seemed to have considered them worthwhile. He supposed it was good that something positive could come of all those years of forced lessons in Ministry politics from his father. He’d also never be telling his father that some of the training he’d received proved useful in making positive changes at the Ministry. Merlin knew his father didn’t need the ego boost or the belief that in doing so Draco was restoring the Malfoy name.
And they wouldn’t. Draco had no idea what he was dealing with specifically but he knew enough to recognise the type of ward and unless they were going to let Marcus Gustafsson (the only Ministry curse breaker who might have enough knowledge about Dark Arts) out of Azkaban, then Draco was still their best chance of safely bringing the ward down. He didn’t say that part out loud, though, no need to remind them all just yet that a good chunk of his summer before seventh year had been spent hiding in his room or the Manor library learning everything he could from those horrible Dark texts to please the Dark Lord or, more accurately, to survive him.
‘That’s barbaric!’ Hermione gasped. ‘He could have died.’
‘Of course, we have,’ Hermione snapped, although she gave an apologetic guilty smile immediately after as though she hadn’t meant to snap.
Draco appreciated that Harry still tried to pay attention when he went on a rant about Potions or something he discovered in one of the books he’d rescued from Grimmauld Place. ‘Magically speaking, we aren’t two people anymore.’
Ron’s eyebrows shot up at his vehemence and Harry sighed, shoulders slumping as he scrubbed both hands over his face – something that would have been awkward before and involved moving or smudging his glasses.
Granger’s sniffles were subsiding into hiccups as she focused watery eyes on Harry.
Harry tried to smile at him, but it was more of a grimace. ‘Okay?’
‘You have no idea what you’re talking about, Weasley,’ Draco returned mildly, refusing to rise to the bait.
Ron flushed red and shifted uncomfortably, eventually blurting out a curious, ‘How’d you mean?’
‘I’ve been having an affair with Draco.’ It’s easier just to say it, lay it out there and wait for her to explode.
Trying to find a balance between Dumbledore bashing and Harry working through his trauma is tricky. I feel like I should point out the bashing is temporary (where Harry is concerned) although it's going to be a while before he works through his feelings.
Weasley turned red but it seemed he was determined not to let his temper get the best of him (such a pity) because he took another deep breath (that had Draco thinking he’d perhaps sought out a mind healer while in Australia) and said, ‘Would you just shut up and listen?’
Harry spun lies and painted a picture of the events on the rooftop. He told the truth about Draco’s actions, lied about how long it took. Took some of the events of the original moment and laced them together with what he wanted them to know.
Harry dramatically dropped his head onto Draco’s shoulder and attempted to give him puppy dog eyes. The effect was quite ruined when he grinned and gave a soft laugh. ‘Draco, sitting in the middle of a pile of gold and shiny jewels is your idea of fun.’
‘Never call me “Mister Malfoy” again, Felicia,’ Draco said, scrutinising the girl. ‘You’re muggleborn.’ It wasn’t a question, but Felicia nodded in response all the same, nerves heightened because even young as she was – even Slytherin as she was – she’d just admitted to being muggleborn to an ex-Death Eater.
Harry expected that after three days of uncertain conditions, living on edge with the threat of who knew what sort of curses and spells left behind, Charlie, Marigold and Winthrop were ready to be free of the Carrow property. Harry might not have had much to do with the Carrows personally, but he’d heard enough stories from Neville and the others living under their regime to know that they were the kind who followed Voldemort for the freedom to torture and cause pain. He didn’t imagine anything they’d left lying around on their property was safe to touch or explore and while he was sure Charlie and Marigold were capable, their training wasn’t exactly in line with Winthrop’s auror training or even Bill’s curse breaking.
‘What the fuck was that?’ he demanded, poking a tentative finger at the glass to test its durability. The thing – whatever it was – whacked up against the glass again.
‘Easy for you to say, you’re having sex.’
‘I really feel you should be giving Harry that look,’ Draco returned, quite offended. When had he ever done anything stupid and life endangering?
Harry rolled his eyes. ‘Really? “Painted in blood: Death Eater performs Dark Arts on Wizarding Saviour”.’
Harry’s mouth dropped open and he stared at Ron for a long minute, struggling to process the enormity of the words Ron had just laid on him. Finally, he managed to shake his head and snap his jaw closed. His first reflex was to call Ron an idiot – because he honestly didn’t see that happening – but Ron looked nervous and upset and he was genuinely worried about this and so Harry wouldn’t take it lightly. He didn’t think it was likely his friends would break up but that wasn’t to say he hadn’t worried a little about the same thing when he first started suspecting their romantic feelings for each other.
Narcissa had done what she could, enlisting Snape under the power of an Unbreakable Vow (and Merlin even Bellatrix had helped her with that – crazy insane Bellatrix had helped protect her nephew). In the end, when she’d finally seen a chance for it to all end, Narcissa had lied directly to Voldemort to save her son (and saved Harry and possibly the entire world – wizarding and muggle – in the process).
Obviously sensing that they might finally be getting somewhere, Draco had kicked off his shoes and shuffled across the short space between them to press into Harry’s side. He took Harry’s face in both hands, cupping his cheeks tenderly and forced him to look at him.
Ginny shrugged. ‘You didn’t want to talk about it and I certainly wasn’t going to bring it up. I just assumed you’d talk when you were ready. Or maybe get over it.’
Draco grinned, unrepentant. ‘That was great.’
‘I think you have to,’ Hermione responded. ‘I can’t die for you, Harry, I won’t. All those people who believe in you, they don’t know you’ve got no idea what you’re really doing, and I can’t be a part of that. I can’t go on letting them think there’s some big plan when really it’s just the three of us in this terrible tent trying to survive on nuts and berries and horrible mushrooms.’ She looked at Harry, her gaze pitying. ‘I can’t see this war ending, Harry, not the way we want it to, not the way Dumbledore planned for. I’m going with Ron and then I’m going to find my parents. I’m not going to die for this stupid war, Harry, I’m just not.’
Given the only person Ron knew Harry had been close enough to have sex with was his sister, Harry was immediately wary of answering. His silence forced Ron to look at him and he must have read the expression on Harry’s face – sheer horror at how the conversation could go – because Ron coughed and rubbed his hands nervously against the leg of his trousers.
Winthrop at least had the curtesy to offer him an apologetic grimace as she held the restraints out to him. With a deep sigh he took the restraints she held out and snapped them onto his own wrists. The runes on the manacles glowed faintly, he wouldn’t be able to move more than a few feet from whichever of them they were tied to until they took them off him. They didn’t hurt, not really, but the pull on his magic was uncomfortable.
Apparently, the castle felt calmer, content. One of the oldest house elves had been overheard speaking with McGonagall about the feel of the castle being much as it was meant to when originally built.
Harry made an annoyed sound that tickled the sensitive slope of Draco’s neck and he shivered at the pleasant sensation. Harry’s hand slipped under his jumper and started to stroke the bare skin of his stomach. If not for the nature of their conversation, it might have started a soft heat that got his blood flowing south.
The last smile, the last exchange, the last moment where he could have stopped it, where he could have said something, opened the parcel and used what was inside because then he would have Sirius and there’d be no Death Chamber, no cut off laugh and Bellatrix’s cackle. There’d never be –
With an exaggerated sigh, Draco did as requested and shuffled across the bed. He hissed reproachfully when a cold foot slipped between his own but the arm across his hips mollified him somewhat as did the warm puff of breath against the side of his neck, a chin resting on his shoulder.
‘This is a fucking terrible idea,’ Draco said, for what may have been the hundredth time.
‘Come on, I’ll buy you some proper tea in Hogsmeade.’
‘That’s good, though,’ Hermione pointed out. ‘That it’s a Slytherin, I mean. We need more positive Slytherin’s in the public eye.’
At this Draco finally turned to look at her and grinned. ‘I’m his greatest obsession, Pansy, surely you knew that?’
When the post arrived, it was with a pleasant surprise for Draco in the form of a care package from his mother carried by his eagle owl and a less pleasant surprise in the form of a letter with the Ministry seal on it. This one was delivered by a friendly, if old, barn owl who didn’t seem impressed by the long journey and seemed quite content to take a rest on his shoulder before making the trip up to the owlery or back to the Ministry.
The old Draco would have liked that, would have used it to his advantage. He would have seen a way to manipulate the students much like his father had always manipulated the people who owed him favours or had things he wanted. The old Draco would have seen that fear and seen all the ways it could bring him money, power and glory.
Ginny had been warned gently by Molly (not that she’d needed the warning) whereas Percy had arched a brow and simply said, ‘Harry, I’ve seen the visitor logs for Azkaban – I think I’d gotten that one worked out.’
He accepted them now, saw them as his own reminder of what he was capable of. There were some mornings Draco would wake to find Harry staring at them, fingers tracing the barely visible white lines across his chest with a dark brooding look. Draco had learned lots of fun ways to make Harry forget on those mornings. He couldn’t make Harry forgive himself, not fully, not always, but he could show him again and again that he’d already been forgiven.
He suspected it was the sudden lurching fear that his inability to give Hermione the answers she desperately wanted would somehow damage his relationship with Harry.
Harry sniggered, even Granger looked amused, although she was trying to hide it.
‘Another student,’ corrected Joseph, ‘so I can properly assess your skills.’ He looked around at the class. ‘Any volunteers?’
Draco couldn’t help but laugh at Harry’s affronted tone. He liked that Harry hadn’t had time for all that, though. He’d slept with exactly one person before Draco and that meant Draco got to teach him a lot of things about sex – most of them really. His one attempt with Ginny had (they’d both freely admitted) been a bit of a letdown. It was nice being able to rub it in Ginny’s face that Harry was now rather good in bed and that it had nothing to do with Ginny.
But Draco was distracted talking about potions ingredients and Harry had no qualms interacting with kids, so he turned away from Draco and wandered over to the next stall. The kids watched his approach with wide eyes, tracking his movement until they were gaping up at him from beneath the table on which their dad, Harry could now see, was trying to sell custom-made wooden cutting boards.
Her parting words were, ‘You’re an idiot,’ but she didn’t fight him. Which he appreciated. He did not appreciate the way the world tried to slip out from under him when he turned around again. He must have lost some time because he blinked and Fleur was there. Bill had come with her.
Harry pulled a face but didn’t ask why, instead he said, ‘We both need new kit. I swear Pomfrey fed us a growth potion.’
Draco made a disgusted sound in agreement, but Harry snorted a laugh. ‘Leave them alone.’
Ginny seemed to understand this too, because she grabbed Hermione by the arms and frog-marched her out of the sitting room, scolding, ‘Don’t ruin a beautiful thing with too much research.’
But Draco didn’t end up dead and his timing was perfect. Harry left a gap in the wards for him and it really was a simple matter of strolling into the castle concealed beneath Harry’s extremely powerful cloak. It was astonishingly easy to slip into the circle of runes and magic pressed tightly to Harry’s back.
Draco nodded, sitting up and untangling himself from Harry.
Draco hummed noncommittally. ‘I don’t know. I don’t know of anyone else who might know enough about the way the Mark functions to use it this way. Voldemort wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to have that sort of power over his followers.’
Luna. She was standing back, long blond hair hanging loose over her shoulder, with her wand tucked behind her ear and her usual strange style – today she appeared to be wearing her old radish earrings – but what brought Hermione up short was the man standing beside her. The much taller figure wasn’t her father – it was Draco Malfoy.
‘Are you saying I look awful?’ Draco asked with a tired smile.
‘Small wedding, just family,’ Harry answered easily. ‘We decided on four kids.’
‘No,’ Harry agreed. ‘Let’s not.’
‘I don’t think I realised that,’ he admitted.
Draco’s initial detection charm faded as it reached the end of the corridor and he and Harry started cautiously forward, Harry dropping Draco’s hand finally so they could give the spells revealed their full attention. They both paused in front of the first portrait, a cheery looking nursemaid with a toddler on her knee. Her smile looked strangely brittle as Draco cast a fresh detection spell over her.
‘So no, I don’t think he’ll forgive Weasley as easily this time because he doesn’t have to worry about being alone. He’s never going to be alone again and now he knows that, now he can see it every day in all the stupid little ways I show him I love him and you two stand by him, he can afford to take the time to process how Weasley hurt him, he can take the time to learn to trust him again. If he even deserves it.’
What did Granger know about proper traditions and magic when hers was a shallow corruption of everything Draco had ever been taught? Of the things he knew to be true?
‘I really think I do.’
‘You what?’ Ron repeated. ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’
‘Only that it’s a
She thought she saw occasionally in the way Malfoy looked at Harry that there was more there and that was part of the reason he was trying so hard. She thought she could see it at times when he talked with Ginny or she found him in the library tutoring the first years in Potions, but she didn’t see the changes the way Luna talked about them, she didn’t see the broken man they’d described surviving Azkaban and the horror that the Ministry was putting him through in guise of his probation and war reparations.
‘Harry,’ she said his name again in a daze and he laughed.
Harry got a good look at Draco’s naked back, took a moment to admire the snitch as it fluttered across his pale skin. He did not admire the way it zipped around the burn flowing down Draco’s right shoulder blade. Harry reached out to touch the edge of it as he steered him toward the bathroom and gave an annoyed sigh when the snitch jumped ship and darted up his hand to take refuge at his elbow. It was both the most annoying and coolest thing Harry had seen a magical tattoo do, but it wasn’t something to worry about – or think on – now. Harry continued to manhandle Draco into the bathroom, helped him strip out of his smouldering clothes and shoved him into the shower.
Draco relaxed, tension draining from his body and he slumped back into the warm cacoon of his bed covers. ‘You couldn’t have waited until morning?’ he asked testily, although there wasn’t much anger in his tone.
The Dark Arts had a place in magic and the wizarding world, Voldemort and, for that matter, Grindelwald before him, had twisted and broken those spells – the art itself – into something almost unrecognisable. The ward created to recognise the Dark Mark was a poorly corrupted version of a Dark blood ward, one Draco suspected had existed in its pure – uncorrupted – form around the Manor before Voldemort soaked the place in blood and ruin.
But he wasn’t okay with this. He wasn’t okay knowing that the Ministry he worked for, the one that was supposed to be better, had let Draco get so badly hurt and then simply sent him on his way.
‘Mate, what the fuck?’
When Harry walked into that Potions lesson, she was ecstatic to see him – it had been months and he hadn’t been at the Burrow when they’d returned and left again – but he hadn’t even seemed to be aware that she and Ron were there, his attention focused on Malfoy and the way Slughorn was being rude to him. He’d walked right up to the table Malfoy was sat at in front of them and slipped easily onto the empty stool.
‘Really?’ Hermione had that tone in her voice that suggested she was about to pull out parchment and take notes. ‘What do you mean? Were you aware of Voldemort? Can you feel Draco?’
She didn’t understand that he wasn’t.
‘You still own the house in Godric’s Hollow?’ Granger said with surprise, although Draco didn’t know why she was surprised. Harry was the last living Potter, who else was going to sell off the property?
‘I didn’t want anyone to know,’ Draco explained. ‘I played it up so that you’d all think I was faking.’ He shrugged. ‘Nobody needed to know how bad it really was. I’m not sure it would have mattered if they did.’
Draco motioned more forcefully through the glass and Harry got to his feet so that he could go and have a look through the grimy window. And promptly leapt back, startled, when something smacked against the windows.
Ginny was much the same, although when she thought they were being idiots, or she wanted attention, she was perfectly willing to both call them on it and demand the attention she desired. Pansy never bothered to call them on it. She was very upfront about her need for attention in her letters and on the few times they’d caught up in person. In fact, the last time she’d written she’d declared she needed to talk with Harry about something muggle and he could bloody well leave Draco behind so she could get her answers without distraction.
Harry nodded and at last lifted his head off his arms and pushed himself back from the bed. just enough that he could sit up straight but not far enough that he lost the contact with Draco’s flushed skin. ‘I’m tired of watching him get hurt.’
‘You’ll have some pins and needles in your fingers for a day or two,’ she told him, ‘but there’ll be no lasting damage to the nerves or muscles.’
can show me.’ He stood up, shoved the box aside, and moved to Harry’s side, wrapping an arm around his waist and drawing him close. ‘There’s nothing more we can do here today,’ Draco assured him. ‘So take me to dinner.’
‘What else would we do with them?’ Draco asked, not understanding.
‘What if I’d known?’ Harry mused, smiling at Draco and eliciting a snort from Ginny who was familiar with their game of what-if.
In spite of, or maybe even because of, Ginny’s rage, Harry is calm. He’s getting these thoughts and feelings off his chest. ‘It’s not a joke, Ginny. I didn’t plan for things to happen like this, I honestly thought we’d find a way through this but things with Draco, Ginny they’re good and they could be so much better. I thought I loved you when we got married, I thought I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you, but now, when I think about the future, when I think about what I want it’s not you, it’s Draco and I think I’m finally starting to understand that maybe it’s always been this way.
Ron deflated like an old balloon, shoulders dropping, colour draining back out of his face and he said, ‘Oh.’
‘You know old Blind-Benny has a foot fetish, yes?’
Harry’s expression softened. ‘It’s been a long time, Hermione.’
Hermione shook her head, nonplussed. ‘Why on earth have you seen those?’
And he was Draco now, even in her head. He was smart and knowledgeable, and he was trying and despite her desire to keep hating him, despite her desire to see him as the boy he was and the horrible kid he’d been, despite wanting to hold his past against him, the changes she saw in him were genuine and she possibly hated that even more.
‘Oh, Harry,’ Hermione whispered, horrified. She might not like Draco but at least Harry could see she understood how incredibly wrong it was that the Ministry could just use Draco that way. Hermione would never want anyone to be used in such a way. Harry knew without asking that if she understood the kind of things that happened to prisoners in Azkaban, the things he had been fighting so hard to stop while she’d been away, that she’d be properly outraged.
The Dursleys had just been glad he wasn’t underfoot as they prepared to uproot their lives and the Order, who should have been closely watching for his comings and goings (because there shouldn’t have been any) missed it entirely because as far as they could tell, Harry never left. How could he? He was underage, still subject to the trace, and was perfectly aware of the dangers. Slipping out from the careful watch of the Order was a stupid risky move and, although he was prone to those, he’d made a much more concerted effort since the death of Albus Dumbledore to not put others (or himself) at risk.
Looking back at it, Harry could laugh. He could find amusement in the way Arthur had dropped a corner of the paper to look at him, eyebrows raised and looking as though he must have misheard. He could see the fun in the way Molly had frozen, half into her chair, with a look of complete astonishment on her face.
That first night, when Harry had returned from his outing with Weasley, Draco had simply crawled into bed with Harry, the two of them hiding away from the world while Harry talked about his conversation with the Weasel – Harry had even managed to be amused by Weasley’s assumption that it was Pansy he’d been seeing. The fact the revelation about their relationship had gone pretty much exactly as they’d all been expecting, likely made the situation easier to deal with and they’d gone to sleep that night knowing it would be rough but fully expecting that, while he probably wouldn’t accept Draco, he’d come to see that he made Harry happy.
Draco didn’t imagine their detour to the kitchens with Granger meant he’d be getting that shower with Harry any time soon. He supposed he could always leave Harry to deal with Granger, but he didn’t think Harry would let him just leave and he certainly didn’t think Granger would let him slip away without some sort of explanation for what she’d seen.
While he moved on to deal with the third Death Eater, Harry used a combination of charm-speaking and sonorous to lull the remaining muggles into a trance which would make it easier for the aurors to interview them and for the obliviators to eventually do their jobs. Once they’d all been cleared of spells and curses by healers, of course. But making them pliant and susceptible would make healing them easier. He’d seen it before, how muggles would become agitated and terrified when healers tried to help them because all they’d known of magic until help arrived was pain and fear.
Despite the way she’d charged into his quiet space in the back of the library and warded the area so heavily he felt a bit like a prisoner being prepped for interrogation (he almost expected her to bring out some veritaserum or cast a dubiously legal
Harry glared at him while Granger sputtered.
And yet he was standing knee deep in snow on the property line in the back field of farmland the Ministry had seized months ago from the Carrows after their capture. He and a few others were watching as Draco worked with Bill and four Ministry curse breakers to tear down the wards preventing anyone from entering the property.
sixth year?’
‘I should be cataloguing all this as I go.’ He pulled a face. ‘Draco and I are going to have to come back over the summer to do it before we can consolidate all our vaults.’ He pulled another face.
‘I could feel that it was gone but it was a good feeling, a relief honestly, like there was a pressure lifted and everything I feel is stronger, deeper – like there are more colours in the world. My tie to Draco doesn’t feel like that hole got filled up or take that feeling away. It’s not like I just traded a piece of one soul for another, Draco and I sort of reach for each other?’ He glanced at Draco who nodded. ‘Yeah, we reach out for each other, we don’t have bits of each other buried within us.’
But he wasn’t going to think about that, all it did was make him mad at Draco, mad at the Ministry, and the tiny first year did not need to be even more twitchy than she was. Struggling with an obvious bout of nerves, eyes darting from Draco to Harry and over to Hermione and Ron before they slipped once more back to Draco, it was a moment before she managed to speak again.
‘You were the first wizard my age I’d met, the first properly magical person. We could have spent the whole day with you showing me Diagon Alley.’
He might be Draco Malfoy, Death Eater, but he was also Draco Malfoy, survivor. He’d survived the war, survived Azkaban, survived beatings and breakdowns and the slow and steady erosion of his own self, first under Voldemort’s orders and then in the actions and hunger of the dementors of Azkaban. He’d taken those broken shattered pieces and he’d built something stronger. He’d built them into someone he could be proud of. Someone, Luna could call a friend.
apology enough under those circumstances.
‘Of course, I’m mad,’ she replied, matter of fact. ‘You lied to me – to us – for months.’
Granger’s hands came up to cover her face and it took them both a moment to realise it was in an attempt to smother giggles. That was a failure. Her whole body was shaking. Although the slightly hysterical sound suggested this wasn’t a healthy laugh.
He watched the whole thing, strangely detached. He heard Pomfrey behind him scuttling away to meet the girls in the Hospital Wing, but he didn’t really understand what was happening until Ginny’s hand dropped softly on his shoulder and she asked him if he needed her to get him out too.
‘’Arry?’
Harry hit him again with another hex but this time he was close enough that people noticed he was there. Noticed and looked to him, eager to see what he would do. None of them could possibly have failed to notice how friendly he’d been with Draco since his return, but he could read on their faces how they expected this to go. They thought he’d see the Ravenclaw hunched over in pain, staring down a Death Eater and let the scene speak for itself. He could see the eagerness in the way they were waiting for his reaction.
He’d told Harry this – all of it. He’d shared every secret he had, every hope and doubt and fear and triumph just as he shared each piece of his soul and his magic and Harry had done the same. He’d shared a lot of it with Luna too, some with his mother – things he should have shared a long time ago. Maybe if he had, things would have turned out differently. He and Harry joked about what-ifs and how things could have been but none of it really mattered because he was Draco Malfoy, he’d chosen to become a Death Eater, taken the Mark willingly and done horrible things he would have nightmares about for the rest of his life.
‘We wouldn’t be able to run classes at all,’ Hermione realised with horror.
Just in case he was starting to feel like the day might not be so bad if everyone was treating him with decency, Ginny caught his eye and flipped him off. He narrowed his eyes at her and mouthed, ‘Why are you even here?’
‘Does thinking it would hurt more make it easier to accept?’ Draco questioned. One of his hands was under his pillow but the other was resting on the mattress between them. Draco reached out with that hand to trail soft patterns on the bare skin of Harry’s arm.
‘Oh.’ Harry reached across the table again to take his friend’s hand. ‘I’m so sorry, Hermione.’
‘I got my first hand job that night,’ Draco told her, eyes distant as he thought back to a time when life had been easy and he hadn’t yet been forced to understand.
‘About what?’ Harry asked, not looking up from where he was adding something to Hermione’s list.
He could pretend to hunt down horcruxes that no longer existed while Voldemort sought out a wand he would never possess, and they waited for a sword to be passed along.
‘I thought if I reached out, I could pull on this connection between us,’ Draco explained. ‘I thought I could use some of your power as you suggested after the blood curse, but I think I’m always using your power. I think you’ve been using mine too.’ Draco held up their connected hands and studied them with wonder – if a little alarm.
‘She tried to hand you over to Voldemort,’ Ron needlessly pointed out.
Hermione flailed a bit at that, how was she supposed to tell him he would always be enough? What was she supposed to say to convince him that had never been their problem when they were on such rocky ground?
Harry grinned. The mood so different from how it had been after she’d first sat down that he had no trouble telling her, ‘I don’t think I want to admit how many nights I stayed up watching his dot on the Marauder’s Map.’
Well, Draco was having none of that. ‘List of courses that need to be run, number of new teachers we’ll need, and I’ll send off a couple of owls to anyone I know who has money to spend.’
‘I wouldn’t try to get closer and I wouldn’t move anything,’ Draco advised and was it just him or had his voice sounded a little rough? He coughed suddenly and felt the (by now) familiar feeling of blood filling his mouth. He wanted to roll his eyes. He couldn’t even feel what was causing that and that should have been alarming.
Draco snorted in amusement. ‘I’m surprised they’re running them now.’
Probably not the time to say, ‘I’m going to make an excellent curse breaker,’ but he said it anyway, tone smug.
‘You’re being an idiot,’ Robards informed him tersely.
Harry turned to look at him. ‘What?’
‘Muggles,’ Pansy answered when he asked. ‘I got a flat in Muggle London and I’ve been working at a bar.’
‘I’m sorry.’
‘Nothing really, Astoria interrupted us – thank Merlin – and then somehow we were talking about my future career and whether I actually wanted to be a curse breaker which – why have you never asked me if it’s what I really want to do?’
‘We don’t really sleep anymore,’ Harry had offered, by way of explanation, though he’d suspected his tired eyes and grumpy expression said as much.
He chanced a glance at his friends and saw Hermione’s eyebrows shoot up as she frowned at him. ‘What sort of services?’
Startled, Draco said, ‘What? There was no photo of me licking Harry.’ He couldn’t say when he would even have licked Harry’s neck in public. There’d been a few times he’d brought the runes to life on Harry’s skin, but he didn’t remember any public licking. That was a bit mortifying.
Harry glared. ‘You were here too,’ he hissed. ‘You should be getting the same treatment!’
He supposed, actually, that was pretty typical of their interactions on a whole. Drawn to each other even when dripping insults and firing hexes. Harry didn’t see why that should have changed just because they’d added deliciously satisfying sex to the equation.
Harry didn’t even hesitate, he dropped his head back against Hermione’s bed with a groan and answered, ‘Twelve very very long hours in London – muggle and wizarding – over the summer.’
Unrepentant, Draco grinned. ‘Well, it’s true.’
But he’d let it get in the way of
‘Draco?’ Harry was back to sounding alarmed.
They hadn’t breached far enough across the boundary yet to know if the shared protection would keep Harry safe but reinforcing the magics in it couldn’t hurt. Hopefully once they got far enough across, Draco would be able to detect the ward keyed to Dark Marks, at the very least, then he and Harry could travel easily through the fields toward the dragon and Charlie. If not, they’d be moving just as slowly as the others, trying to clear spells and curses as they went.
‘Of course, it does,’ Granger snapped.
Harry had soaked in almost a year’s worth of auror training in just a handful of months, after all. It was something to consider when they were writing their proposal for McGonagall, the different ways people could learn –
It was just his luck that the first to reach him was an auror he didn’t recognise. Of course, that didn’t mean they didn’t recognise him. Draco wasn’t sure there was a witch or wizard living in Britain that wouldn’t recognise him thanks to the
Draco smirked. And then he was gone.
‘I never said I was nice.’
become the leading source of accurate news, can they?’
Because, before they reached that point, they had to deal with the rest. They made plans. Plans and contingencies and more plans. They plotted and lied and stole away for quiet moments. They planned some more. Honestly, Harry was about ready to pull his hair out by the end and more often than not, when they were together, planning slipped their minds and they took solace in each other.
In defence against the December chill, Luna snuggled up against Draco’s other side, wrapping her arms around his arm and pressing her cheek against his bicep and trapping Harry’s arm between them. ‘You do love curse breaking, Draco.’
A soft warmth spread up and down his right leg and Madam Pomfrey made a satisfied sound before she brandished a hand at the two Gryffindors and Luna, making them scramble to get out of her way as she moved around the bed to get to his left shoulder. Luna reached out and took his right hand in her own, letting him squeeze it as Madam Pomfrey set about inspecting the glass in his shoulder.
Harry assumed Bill was at home in a similar position to Draco, curled with Fleur on the sofa as he went through the other book Draco had retrieved from Gringotts – this one from the Malfoy vault. Both of them working non-stop for days to try and find the spells needed to bring down the wards before the Ministry’s weeklong deadline. None of them fancied trying to empty nearby towns just to cobble together a controlled break but so far Draco had only managed to identify one more of the curses and without that last one, there was a very real chance that a controlled break with seven or more curse breakers would be their only option.
And Charlie had been left floundering, wondering what had just happened until Bill had cracked up laughing, too amused to properly explain he’d just given their mother hope he wasn’t going to spend the rest of his life obsessing and loving nothing but his dragons.
While digging through Bella’s vault had not been fun it had been somewhat informative. Beneath the gold and many (many) knockoffs, Draco found a number of books on the Dark Arts that he and Harry set aside to be transferred to the Potter vault where Harry had stashed a lot of the books he’d emptied out of Grimmauld Place when he’d learned the wards would need to be rebuilt.
Just as Draco was preparing to stand, spinning around in his crouch to keep his eye on the fight still happening behind him, Winthrop grabbed him and shoved him sideways. He hit the road with a grunt of annoyance, glaring at her as she stood over him. Her stance was protective, shield held firmly in place. He didn’t know why she was protecting him all of a sudden. It wasn’t like he’d needed the help. Or that she’d ever put on such a display of protecting him before.
‘No she’s not,’ Harry spoke without hesitation, sure in his words. Because there was simply no way Astoria would be returning to Hogwarts. How would she even manage it?
While Draco was handing over the appropriate number of coins, Harry found himself asking the stallholder, ‘Do you plan to send you kids to Hogwarts?’
Ginny snorted. ‘Can I have a broom for Christmas.’
They’d had fights before, he and Ron, of course they had. There’d been petty squabbles and stupid fights over little things that you couldn’t help but have when you shared a dorm and classes with someone and saw them almost every second of the day. But there’d been just three major fights between them and they’d all been, Harry could understand that now, because of the same thing. It was only now, on the other side of the war, with his found family and the understanding that there were plenty of people who loved him, that he could see that those big fights had never really been about him.
In retrospect, seeing a mind healer was probably something Harry should have been doing since First Year. He couldn’t give Draco and Luna all the credit for this new confident and centred version of himself, seeing a mind healer for the better part of the last year had certainly done wonders for him.
‘Cutting curse,’ Granger confirmed, like she hadn’t already been the one to tell Pomfrey when they brought him in what he’d been hit with. And he still couldn’t believe she and Weasley had bothered to help him up here at all, let alone stuck around.
Draco supposed that was fair, if they had to acknowledge all of his regrets they’d be stood in that field until Christmas. ‘I take it you heard about the bathmat.’
His cell had a window. He thought, rather mockingly, this made him one of the lucky ones. It wasn’t much of a window and it certainly didn’t make him lucky. If he lay flat on the freezing stone floor and hugged his body against the back wall of his cell, he could peer out the foot long, three-inch-high gap in the stonework and glimpse the sea. Even that tiny window had two narrow steel rods through it and his view of the sea did little but remind him that he was nothing. That there was nothing to see and no way of escape from this hell.
An awkward silence fell over the table and Draco became very aware of how much attention was focused on their little corner of the Slytherin table. It was why he affected a perfectly casual air when he broke the silence with a question for Luna, though not about her holiday plans even though that’s what they’d been discussing before they’d been interrupted.
Harry hoped Draco wouldn’t take her anger personally, she kept darting looks at the dragon as though it could die any moment if she dared to take her eyes of it for too long.
He didn’t open either at the table. He tucked the Ministry missive into the pocket of his robes and the letter and sweets from his mother into his bag. He was just finishing off his tea when a third owl arrived, this one dropped its letter on his head to flop down into his lap. He threw an annoyed glare up at the owl (likely hired from an Owl Post Office) and then glanced down to look at the letter. There was no formal address on the front of the envelope, just his first name, but Draco would recognise that untidy scrawl anywhere.
curse hadn’t exactly left him in the peak of health and following it up with a three month stay in Azkaban hardly made for a safe and healing environment.
She’d absolutely turn it around again until they were talking about his bond and he was having none of that.
jeans and a deep blue t-shirt. His Dark Mark was openly displayed on his arm contributing to the wide birth everyone on the platform gave once they realised who he was. Not that there was any mistaking him, his features were all Malfoy, even if he didn’t look as gaunt and hollow as he had when she’d last seen him in the final battle. And he’d done something to his hair, though she couldn’t think what.
She startled him in return with her own soft, ‘Good morning, Draco.’
She didn’t have time to be amused or horrified that she’d interrupted something.
‘I’m not in that one,’ Draco complained. ‘I thought the point of this whole thing was how we’d always end up together.’
‘No!’
Draco hesitates and Harry can see it, so he says what he knows needs to be said. ‘You can be honest.’
With a grimace, Draco tuned back into the conversation with Longbottom in time to see the man looking nervous but resolute as he slipped out the door. ‘Shower?’ he asked Harry.
This time Draco rolled his eyes. ‘I don’t need to be in his head, it’s written all over his face.’
‘We didn’t know,’ Hermione murmured, sounding contrite for her thirteen-year-old self’s scathing scepticism.
Draco wouldn’t leave Harry. Not like Weasley always did.
He had no idea where they were, couldn’t even narrow down the part of the country just by glancing around and there was hardly any time to stop and ask someone. He had no idea what exactly they’d interrupted, either. Some sort of winter festival perhaps? He could see, over the heads of the fleeing crowd, at least four figures stood in front of the empty stage. Figures dressed in robes and masks, firing spells into the backs of the fleeing muggles. That was all he needed to know. All Harry needed to know, as well.
‘You don’t ever have to worry about that again,’ Draco murmured to him, squeezing his hand and bringing it to his mouth to brush a kiss across Harry’s knuckles. His right hand, where he bore the scars of Umbridge and her hatred. He wanted to give Harry a solid reminder that he was there and unlike all those summers and all those months spent isolated, Draco would never let Harry go back to that place, that feeling.
Draco took in the words, waiting for them to make some kind of sense and then realised that he could picture it perfectly. Pansy was the girl who offered to hand Harry over to Voldemort, she’d have just as tough a time in the wizarding world as he did. Well, perhaps not as tough, but he’d been locked up in Azkaban almost immediately after the war, he hadn’t been around for the aftermath.
Ginny grinned. ‘Hit him with another tongue-tying jinx the moment he opened his mouth after dinner yesterday. He started in on some really awful things about you while the rest of us were still worrying you were being summoned into a trap and about to die.’ The words were said lightly but there was real concern beneath them, and Draco reached out to squeeze Ginny’s hand.
heard it than she did about the sudden attack by Death Eaters in a muggle village. Not that she wasn’t bothered by
But that didn’t mean he didn’t regret all the lost chances for he and Draco to get to know one another earlier. All the lost chances they’d had to potentially change the animosity between them. Would Narcissa have changed sides earlier? Would Lucius have stood by his son? Would Draco have spent the year camping with them while they hunted for horcruxes?
Ron didn’t get it. He didn’t get what was so funny. He didn’t get why they were laughing and he definitely didn’t get why Malfoy was here.
It was probably a good thing they were about to have this out because Draco didn’t think he could keep distracting her for much longer without her recognising what he was doing and calling him on it. She was brilliant, after all, and though he could keep up with her intelligence, he could not – would not – try and out stubborn a Gryffindor. It never ended well for him.
He wasn’t about to say that to Ron just yet (though he made a note to bring it up later, preferably with Hermione so she could handle it) so he just shrugged and just answered Ron’s question. ‘Because he likes them.’
They’d have missed some (probably more than some in the chaos) muggles who had run before he and Harry arrived but no one at the Ministry could argue they hadn’t done their best, that they hadn’t done exactly as they’d been trained to in a situation risking the Statute of Secrecy.
‘Good,’ Mustafa replied, Draco heard him address the final pair of curse breakers as he and Harry started out of the Hall. ‘Wen, Gareth, take the greenhouses, the grounds. Sweep all the courtyards and the external walls of the castle.’
‘I don’t know,’ Draco growled.
Harry dove back onto the bed and wriggled up under the covers to press icy skin against Draco’s warm side. Draco yelped and tried to shove him away but it was as though Harry had grown extra limbs as he tangled around him and refused to let go.
Chris didn’t move immediately, eyeing Harry warily for a moment before he realised Harry wasn’t about to move and tried to slide sideways away from him. Harry made sure he locked eyes with him as he edged away before he turned his attention to Slughorn who looked confused and off balance.
‘I want to go home, Papa,’ his daughter murmured.
Like Astoria’s return.
There were times when he remembered a boy who had all the wrong choices forced on him and then had his hopes and second chances yanked away by people who were supposed to be good and if Harry was a little broken, if he was a little distant and cold then that was expected because he’d been forced to do a lot of bad things in the war and Ginny and the kids were maybe his only bright spot but sometimes it just felt so
‘You’re stupidly pretty,’ Harry corrected, not even caring how goofy and lovesick he sounded. Although, ‘I think I’m really fucking tired, Draco.’
‘How would you know?’ Harry demanded, hotly. ‘You were gone for months.’
‘It all helps,’ Draco replied honestly. ‘The running, the potions. You.’
Draco shrugged, squeezing her fingers. ‘It didn’t matter to him. It didn’t matter to anybody. Fuck, Pansy, I was just a kid and I was a puppet. Voldemort and Dumbledore pulling my strings in their little power play.’
Ron didn’t say anything more about the number of vaults Harry had, instead he started asking questions about the things Harry was finding. Harry didn’t mind, it was an amusing way to pass the time while he searched, coming up with more and more ridiculous stories behind the things he was finding.
‘I don’t know,’ Charlie answered honestly.
‘You can’t kill him,’ Harry murmured but it lacked any real conviction because Ron’s words and actions had hurt and Harry wasn’t feeling especially charitable right now, not with how those words and the feelings they’d spawned in Harry seemed to have triggered a never-ending storm of nightmares.
He felt Harry shrug against him. ‘I don’t know, probably. I didn’t really remember them at first, I still don’t really remember them, I was just really grateful Ron was away and I had my room to myself. I’d remember flashes, glimpses really, but that was about it. When you got out and we started seeing more of each other, that’s when I realised, I’d been dreaming about you. I think they started as nightmares but honestly, there were probably some sex ones in there too.’
Harry rolled his eyes. ‘Git.’ He tugged on Draco’s hand to get him moving again.
then who was he to argue? Anything that gave Draco some hope of a respectable future was worth grabbing with both hands. Under other circumstances, Harry had no trouble believing Draco would enjoy being a curse breaker. He liked unravelling spells and curses, he liked getting to play with them and learn about them as he tried to counter them. He’d been planning to do the work clearing out the Manor even before Narcissa’s request had garnered Ministry aid.
What it boiled down to, though, was that she worked him hard, taught him a lot and that by the time he’d stepped through the floo back into McGonagall’s empty office, made for his (Draco’s) room, tripped over Draco’s bloody kneazle, showered, dressed and made for Potions at a dead run, he was too tired to even attempt to keep his temper (which it turned out Smith had not as thoroughly tempered as he’d thought) in check when he arrived in the dungeons to find Draco being verbally abused by a seventh year Ravenclaw while everyone else (even Ron and Hermione) stood watching without trying to step in.
‘But you’re Draco Malfoy and he’s Harry Potter and whatever this thing is between you, I think it’s been brewing since the day you met on the train and there is no way I’m going to get in the way of that. He nearly killed you. You were a Death Eater. There’s seven years of bad blood between you but he looks at you like you’re his whole world and he has no idea how he got so lucky and, ugh, the way you look at him.’ She’d shuddered theatrically. ‘You two are going to kill each other before the year is out or you’re going to be disgustingly happy for the rest of your lives. Either way, if Voldemort himself couldn’t come between you, I don’t think any of us are going to manage to talk some sense into him. Or you.’
And if Ron took extra care dressing that evening for dinner then Hermione never noticed – mostly because he thought she was putting a little extra effort into her appearance too.
‘Yes, sir.’
At least, he hoped she was beginning to understand. She’d been good about being friendly with him over the weeks since Harry had returned to Hogwarts and shown they were friends. She’d given him the benefit of the doubt on multiple occasions and gone so far as to defend him at least twice, but that, he’d always known, came from her desire to see people treated fairly. It came from a desire to see the war put behind them and those who needed to be punished, done so in a manner that fit their crimes. As far as she was concerned, he had served his time and his punishment was fair. She’d hadn’t liked him, hadn’t shown treated him with anything that could be called genuine friendship, but she was respectful, and she had treated him as any other person – when she wasn’t doggedly demanding he explain why he was using dangerous and illegal magic.
Pansy reached across the table and took one of his hands in her own. ‘You were only sixteen.’
After the first war, when Voldemort was little more than a bodiless spirit living off rats, the Dark Mark had faded from the arms of his followers, enough so that people like his father had been able to lie and pay to keep out of Azkaban. Voldemort hadn’t liked that, had made a point of favouring those who had gone to Azkaban rather than renounce him. As punishment he’d made changes to the spells on his Mark. The one Draco had on his arm would never fade. He would forever bear the mark of his terrible choices.
And then he’d laughed and joked with Malfoy with an ease that twisted something up inside Hermione. The way he smiled so easily at Malfoy, as though there was no bad history between them, as though they hadn’t been on different sides in the war made her sick.
‘Oh, I’m bemoaning the fact I missed your sexuality crisis.’
was right.
Draco’s eyes widen and he immediately denies the request. ‘Are you insane? She’ll kill me.’
‘Merlin, woman, I’m not the only one who left it until the last minute,’ Ron said, defensively breaking Harry’s concentration from wondering if there were ways to give Hermione permission to read the books – assuming that was something Harry wanted. ‘I don’t see you badgering Harry,’ he went on forcing Harry to acknowledge the argument brewing between his friends.
Harry smiled. A proper smile that made Robards glare at him for being too damn cheerful. While the changes being made wouldn’t keep Draco completely out of harm’s way, they were a start, a sign that Robards (and Winthrop at the very least) saw Draco as more than just a nasty Death Eater tool to be used. A sign that if two people who’d never known Draco as anything other than a Death Eater (and Winthrop had never seen evidence of how crap a Death Eater he made) then the wizarding world at large might someday see it too.
Green light slammed into white feathers and Hedwig was falling from the sky, a scream choking in Harry’s throat as he desperately tried to survive –
‘Don’t call him that,’ Harry snapped but he couldn’t keep up with the hate that Ron was throwing at him. He couldn’t understand how the friend he loved so fiercely could believe the words he was saying. That he could even say them in the first place.
Harry shook his head ruefully. ‘We can work on it.’
But Harry just cried. He was safe, he knew that. He knew where he was, wrapped in Draco’s arms in the bed they shared at Malfoy Manor. They’d been home three days. Three days of nightmares and broken sleep and Draco’s nerves starting to fray because he wasn’t getting any more sleep than Harry was, but he still managed to hold Harry, to comfort him and all Harry wanted to do was burrow into that warmth, that comfort and love, and hide away from the world because it was safe there in Draco’s arms where the world couldn’t touch him.
‘Oh, yeah, it’s Gemma Farley,’ Ginny explained.
‘You’re going with him.’
‘No,’ Malfoy answered flatly. He exchanged a look with Harry and then they both started laughing.
‘Did you know that’s what he was doing?’ Granger demanded. ‘Did you even check the meaning of the runes?’ Her tone told them both how very much she doubted that. As Harry’s friend, she knew for a fact he didn’t know anything about runes.
terribly sweet, and I do think she’s pretty.’ He paused for another moment before he added quietly, ‘Last year I had to torture her for the Carrows.’
Harry’s voice was just as thick with embarrassment as Draco’s had been with affection when he looked over at the women on the sofa. ‘Sirius couldn’t bring himself to throw them away,’ he explained. To Draco he said, ‘Pansy told me about them when I was trying to think of what to get you. I just had to ask Walburga.’
Harry nodded. ‘Yeah, okay, and most of those are held on the first couple of floors. Not much foot traffic to notice someone turned this corridor into a fucking sex trap.’
‘Where’re they sending you?’ Weasley demanded.
It wasn’t a lie, but it wasn’t the whole truth either. He didn’t owe her more than that though. Maybe one day he’d tell her in detail, it wouldn’t be there at the Hog’s Head though.
That first step into the house might very well have killed him. It might have killed Harry, if not for the blood runes still smeared on his neck.
Harry had once tried to explain to him why he didn’t much care what his hair looked like or what clothes he was wearing. Draco couldn’t remember now exactly how the conversation had started or how it had turned into an argument, but it had ended with Draco spending an absolute fortune on clothing and accessories in muggle London and Harry having an entire new Slytherin approved wardrobe. Draco had one too because his commitment to fashion coupled with his commitment to sticking it to his pureblood father had sort of spiralled out of control.
It was the confrontation the next morning that none of them had been expecting.
Sure enough, Weasley broke from his stupor and started marching across the Hall toward Harry at the Slytherin table.
Pansy had snorted. Sprawled out on the rug in front of the fire and making silly faces at Teddy, she’d taken the news with great amusement. ‘This does not surprise me. At all,’ she’d said. ‘The way you two were pining over each other all through school – I’m honestly surprised this didn’t happen sooner.’
‘Where should we start?’ he wondered, a little overwhelmed by the work they had ahead of them and wishing he was settling in for some ordinary Ancient Runes homework instead. Salazar, he’d almost prefer to be back at the house of Raymond Groener (Death Eater #3 from the Christmas attack), and he had honestly thought he and Harry were never getting out of there before they had to leave for Hogwarts. The place had been filthy, covered in dust and spilled potion ingredients and everything the aurors had tried to touch had been cursed and spelled to snap or bite or, in one memorable moment, burn those who touched them.
They’d all read the letter Charlie had sent Ginny, the one that suggested Ron could do with a long cooling off period and some time to sort himself out. They’d all read what Charlie wanted them to know about Ron’s visits to a mind healer and how he was taking the time to talk with Charlie about his homophobic comments – how Charlie could acknowledge that Ron didn’t seem to believe the vitriol he’d spewed at Harry but once he’d started, he hadn’t known how to stop, wanting them to hurt as he hurt. They’d all guessed that, but it didn’t make it better.
And thinking about what he and Draco got up to was making his pants uncomfortably tight and would not at all make the impending conversation with Ron any less awkward. If he had to keep this conversation about that time with Ginny without making things awkward then Harry was going to be in for some conversational mine fields. He did want to be honest with Ron, honest and encouraging, without tipping too heavily into the fact that he and Ginny may as well have been drunk for all the thought and love that went into their first time.
‘We just want you to be happy, dear, and if that happiness is another boy, we’re going to support you just the same.’
‘No,’ Draco said, ‘McGonagall.’ He considered Harry’s question. ‘I love Luna, obviously. What’s not to love?’ He considered that. ‘Honestly, don’t have any idea what I did to deserve her but I’m not about to let her go.’
Draco grinned and nudged Harry’s thigh with a knee. ‘Do you think it’ll kill you?’ he asked, gleefully.
If he got to her in time, she might live, if not, there would be one less witch tormenting muggles in the world.
‘What good would that do?’ Draco had demanded, twisting his body on the sofa so he could look at Harry. ‘You need sleep too!’
She smiled at him, a genuine smile that reached her eyes and said, ‘Oh, I had the biggest crush on you.’
‘I need you to stand here, close your eyes and listen.’
Granger looked devastated, as if he’d just slapped her rather than drop a few truths that he didn’t understand how she could have overlooked. As though none of the things he’d brought up were things she’d considered when making her decisions, even though Harry was looking distinctly uncomfortable next to him which suggested these were things he’d considered. How could he not? He might not like his muggle relatives, but the Order had chosen to hide them, not erase their memories. Hiding them kept them safe, no matter how undeserving. Wiping their memories would have made them ripe for Voldemort’s taking and as much as Harry hated his relatives, he wouldn’t have stood by and let them get hurt.
‘What is it?’ he asked once they’d all joined him in the small mudroom off the kitchen and were looking down at the metal box installed where Draco thought there’d once been a muggle clothes washing contraption.
His mother was similarly enamoured by her gift. She smiled at them after unwrapping it and Draco found himself holding onto that moment, locking it away in his mind to remember for all his years to come. This moment was the first proper family moment they’d had in
dinner together, especially not when they hadn’t seen each other in two weeks. Harry spent lunch at the Gryffindor table, shooting looks across the Great Hall at Draco more often than he probably should have but not nearly often enough to draw attention. It paid to have weird and creepy stalkerish tendencies. Apparently.
‘It kind of looked that way, mate,’ Ron added when Harry waited a bit too long to explain more. He might not have had any idea what was going on, but it seemed four months in Hermione’s company had mellowed Ron a bit because he wasn’t angry or snarling rude things about Draco. Yet. He seemed to understand Harry would not be receptive to them just now. That didn’t mean Harry wasn’t expecting more sharp words and angry comments later.
‘Merlin, no.’
‘Ron realising we’re married.’
Longbottom pulled a face. ‘I think I’ll let you be the one to tell Ron, thanks.’
‘I’ll have it redone,’ he told her, looking up. It seemed to take a lot of effort, that movement, the motion sluggish, and he became aware of how heavy his limbs were feeling. He knew Pomfrey hadn’t given him any potions to sleep just yet and it took him longer than it should have – a symptom of its own – to recognise that his body was free of the adrenalin that had kept him up and going and now he was quite likely about to pass out. He squeezed Luna’s hand tightly in alarm.
‘We’re going to fix it,’ Draco told him.
Draco’s grin didn’t falter. ‘I was,’ he acknowledged. His smile dropped when he thought about her question though. ‘He was at the Ministry meeting with the Minister and the head auror and he overheard a couple of aurors talking about beating me up, about giving me what I deserved.’
She’d always done the same for Draco.
‘Did you know that the other houses were given a sexual education seminar in third year hosted by the prefects?’
‘I can’t,’ the junior auror denied – making him all the more the fool for not realising it wasn’t a request and that he should absolutely be taking the cuffs of the apparent Death Eater because, in case he hadn’t noticed, the three that had been arrested on scene had already been transported and didn’t he think it odd that Draco hadn’t?
It was about Ron. It had always been about Ron. Hermione had told him that once – Merlin, Voldemort’s locket horcrux had shown him that once – but Ron’s own insecurities were standing in his own way and there wasn’t anything that Harry could do about that. There wasn’t anything he was willing to do about that. Ron needed to learn his own worth and although Harry had thought this was behind them, that this kind of feeling of inadequacy was in the past, it was obviously still a big part of Ron and one that needed to be addressed before Ron could have the kind of easy confidence that he envied in Harry.
Possibly because, although he was making a point to put up with Draco because Harry (and Hermione, Ginny, Luna and freaking Neville) were friendly with him, it was very obvious that Ron still didn’t like Draco and he was avoiding spending time with him when he could. Which was likely the only reason he’d not realised there was something going on because they’d had a bloody awkward conversation that might have led somewhere if Harry hadn’t been called away by the aurors just moments after Ron worked up the nerve to ask something that had been on his mind but had seemingly been forgotten in the weeks since.
‘I think I’ll eat with you at the Slytherin table.’
‘I – yeah,’ Harry stammered, clearly having no idea what to say.
‘Well
Trying to out stubborn Draco was no easy feat, but Harry was determined this time. He
It was Ginny who answered, voice rueful. ‘Because he didn’t know it wasn’t normal in the beginning. He didn’t realise it was something he should talk about. And then he realised that even if he did talk about it, nothing would come of it. How many times did he talk about wishing he could stay at Hogwarts for the summer? Or how excited he was to think he might be going to live with Sirius?’
Silence hung heavy in the air once he’d stopped speaking. Both Hermione and Ginny were deep in thought, processing everything he’d just told them. Hermione had tears in her eyes and Ginny had gone pale beneath her freckles.
Trigger warning for attempted rape, PTSD, vague thoughts of suicide and imprisonment.
Upset as she was with Draco, Hermione was in a rage at Weasley when she finally shook off her tears and stood to intervene before Harry killed Weasley and it was all just very loud and chaotic with a lot of words being shouted over the top of others and Draco was going to be late to meet with McGonagall if he stuck around much longer.
Harry smiled, releasing Draco’s left hand to take his right for a second coat, waiting patiently while Draco, despite his annoyance manoeuvred around a bit to give Harry his hand. ‘I always listen to you,’ Harry assured him and then with a cheeky grin he added, ‘I just don’t always understand what you’re saying.’
didn’t like the man Harry loved.
Harry didn’t need Ron and although he wasn’t quite ready to
‘You,’ Draco corrected.
That was not something Harry wanted to imagine, frankly. Hermione would absolutely tear him a new one if she learned there were muggleborns out there who hadn’t come to Hogwarts and even more that hadn’t even known they could and that he’d just not bothered to tell her. Never mind the remaining Death Eaters, Hermione would definitely kill him.
‘You’re joking, right? This is some sort of sick joke because what the actual fuck Harry?’
Draco nodded, accepting the censure. ‘I think a magical primary school would be the best way to do that,’ he admitted. ‘Mother does too. We could introduce both cultures side-by-side so that by the time children reach Hogwarts they see it as normal. Maybe then we won’t have to worry about another Voldemort.’ Draco looked down at his plate. ‘Maybe then there won’t be others like me, forced to become a Death Eater at sixteen.’
They’d all known Ron was going to take the news badly, even if they hadn’t realised how badly but why should Hermione feel guilty for now being ready to talk to Ron just because Harry wasn’t?
The fact that Draco had ways of making essay writing interesting said a lot about how much Harry loved the enormous git and he thought Hermione might appreciate knowing that even if he still didn’t get a thrill out of learning, Draco could almost make him see the thrill he and Hermione got.
Ginny, draped over the sofa in an exhausted slump from an afternoon spent freezing her arse off training in the rain, had simply shaken her head and pointed a finger between them repeating her earlier assertion, ‘I have actual pity for those of us who came between you since the moment you met in Diagon Alley.’
Ginny stares at him and Draco stares back. Apparently her idea of breaking the stalemate is to bluntly drop it all on Draco for him to deal with. ‘I’m pregnant. I’m not ready for a baby. Harry is. Where do you stand?’
It was only when he was taking a proper look at the menu that he realised the witch was likely just happy to have someone who wouldn’t blink at the prices listed beside each item in the post-Christmas bustle. He could appreciate a witch who would let a convicted Death Eater sit at a table just because she knew he could pay.
Ten minutes later, exiting the classroom he and Harry were quiet, their footsteps awkward.
‘I can’t feel my cheeks either,’ Draco told him petulantly but there was a soft smile threatening at the corners of his mouth.
‘From what I can see.’
Given this was something he’d complained about multiple times before – even before they’d had to go to Gringotts to get the book on blood runes – Draco really should have expected the way Harry rolled his eyes fondly and said, ‘I’ll build you a bloody library when you can settle on somewhere you want to live.’
‘No,’ Harry answers but he’s aware it lacks conviction.
She wasn’t so sure about that, but she hadn’t wanted to ruin their easy talk by pointing out that even in the wake of a war based on blood and status, there were still those old families – and some not so old – who didn’t like change, who didn’t see the need for change and would be watching and scrutinising every change she tried to make just because she was muggleborn. There’d be people who opposed her for simply being who she was and just because she was Harry’s friend, just because she’d fought beside him in the war, she didn’t think that would make it easy for her to change the way the wizarding world worked.
But she needed answers.
The spell didn’t so much trigger as erupt. There were more than a few startled cries from behind them as a mushroom shaped cloud burst out of the ground at the dog’s feet and engulfed it. Draco had been prepared for a curse or a spell, he’d not been prepared for a mushroom cloud of hungry cannibalistic magic that soaked up the magic from Harry’s spell until the transfiguration failed and the rock fell lifeless to frozen ground.
Draco winced. ‘I know. I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that.’
He turned around and walked away. Someone fired a jinx at his back. He waved a dismissive hand over his shoulder, blocking the jinx with little effort. He was perfectly happy to ignore them and move on, a little trip jinx was nothing compared to the curses he’d undergone during the war and the power and skill behind the fourth years’ spell wasn’t worth acknowledging.
‘Charlie?’ Harry repeated, for a moment he looked confused but then his expression brightened. ‘Charlie.’
Perhaps not so strangely then, it was Granger’s compassion that gave him the additional strength he needed to straighten up and pull on his mask. He watched her eyes widen and body stiffen at the abrupt change. In contrast, he felt Harry relax beside him. Draco smirked. It wasn’t a perfect mask, there were still signs in the puffiness of his eyes and the paleness of his cheeks that all wasn’t well, but anyone taking a quick glance at him wouldn’t notice, they’d be put off by the arrogant Malfoy smirk. They would only see the cold and aloof front he’d been putting on since term began.
This time Harry did turn to glare at him. ‘I haven’t forgotten what he did,’ he snapped. ‘Maybe I just know more about what really happened than you do.’
Charlie didn’t have to say it for Harry to understand what he was talking about. Fred was a huge empty space next to them all and Charlie, who had spent the better part of a decade in Romania working with dragons, had missed a lot of time he could have been spending with his brother. He had a lot of guilt weighing on him, wondering if he couldn’t have changed something, if only he’d been around sooner.
Weasley snorted. ‘What? Are you going to curse me, Malfoy?’
Draco clutched onto his arms to prevent the half-hearted attempt and then slid his hands up Harry’s arms until they were cupping his jaw. He dropped teasing kisses on Harry’s lips in apology, soft quick touches that didn’t stop the curve of a grin tracing his mouth or still the laughter in his voice when he spoke against Harry’s lips. ‘Can I have the memory?’
Harry laughed softly, a fond sound, and turned back to Hermione who thought she might have been having a stroke. ‘I can’t believe you’re here.’
‘That sounds like jealousy.’
He didn’t hear the sound of the cell door opening but it must have. Warmth pressed against his back, wrapped tightly around him, lifting him from the stone floor and easing him onto the rickety cot. Soft light suffused his cell, searing against his closed eyelids. He let the warmth take him, drew closer as it wrapped in tight bands around his waist, as long lengths of heat encased his legs. He didn’t resist, pressing closer and closer to that warmth, that heat, until steadily he became aware that his ice-cold nose was pressed against warm flesh, that the bands around his waist were strong arms, the heat encasing his legs were just legs belonging to someone else.
Harry grinned, a little sheepishly, but he met Draco’s look with a heat of his own. ‘Take me to bed?’
He could have explained further, talked about what the fiendfyre dragon represented for Draco, about Luna’s lunar cycle and Narcissa’s flowers. He could have explained about the stag and second chances but those weren’t his stories to tell. And they were getting somewhat off track, this wasn’t about the tattoos Draco had chosen to represent the moments of change and forgiveness in his life, the ones about love and sorrow, this was about the Ministry and their ridiculous use of an eighteen year old wizard for tasks they hoped would get him killed.
‘Ron just asked me if you and Luna were dating.’
‘Draco will like that,’ Luna pointed out – rather needlessly, Draco thought.
‘You could ask,’ Draco suggested. ‘It’s hardly fair you have to put up with Weasley tromping through your bedroom at all hours while he gets a nice quiet room to himself.’
Talked a bit, he’d said. This was more than just talking. Harry had braved the dementors, he’d used his own name to gain access to Azkaban on a daily basis. All for Draco Malfoy. And it was exactly the kind of thing Harry would do, that Hermione didn’t doubt it for a moment. She just struggled to understand that drive, that need to talk to someone who had been so horrible to him. She didn’t understand the need to have anything to do with a Death Eater.
They’d both frowned at that and Molly seemed to be rethinking her supportive stance when he’d glanced up at her, but he’d skittered his gaze away and went on before she could ask him any awkward questions or make unwanted suggestions.
‘Oh yes, that’s definitely Potter hair!’ cried a cheerful voice.
But he never would. There was no life in those eyes and the blood that flowed over Harry’s hands had slowed until it was spilling from an empty shell that was no longer Draco and all Harry could do was gather him close and rock back and forth keening over the loss of his greatest love if only there’d been time because this wasn’t how it was supposed to go. It wasn’t. It –
McGonagall wasn’t as familiar with Draco’s propensity to swear in foreign languages when things got bad, but she was familiar enough with Draco to know that something wasn’t right. She pointed her wand at her own throat and when she next spoke her words echoed sharply around the castle. He wondered if it would reach every corner, known and unknown.
It also meant he could keep an eye on and be there to support his youngest brother.
‘Not really,’ Harry replied. ‘Bellatrix wasn’t there but I was and this time it was my fault.’
Hermione, after yet another pause for Harry to (grudgingly) translate – he knew Draco only brought this up to boast about it – exclaimed, ‘I’m sorry
The shake and lurch of the cabinet in the corner drew them away from their thoughts and for a long moment they both stood before the cabinet watching it quiver and not really knowing what to do. Draco hadn’t faced a boggart since sixth year when he’d come across one in the Room of Hidden Things. That one had turned into a series of corpses until he’d been forced to watch all of his loved ones die. He didn’t know what it would be now, not since he’d faced most of his fears head on.
Harry looked at him as though that was the most ridiculous thing he’d ever heard. ‘I’ll blow you in the shower.’
of the day his house arrest had ended where he, Harry and Luna were captured laughing and smiling over lunch. Luna had charmed the camera herself, making sure to capture the moment so she had something to remember the day by.
They wouldn’t have chosen the moment Harry nearly killed him.
Luna arrived then, drawing Harry briefly out of his melancholy thoughts, to smile weakly at her in greeting. She had Ginny with her. Ginny offered him a bright smile, if slightly weakened, but all he could offer back was a pale imitation. He didn’t want to deal with Ginny. Didn’t want a repeat of the conversation they’d had just before he left on that last training mission. Worried out of his mind about Draco, he just didn’t have the time or the energy to deal with Ginny and her honest words and gentle (but loving, she assured him) mocking.
He didn’t know how to talk to them now, not when there was so much pain and hurt and anger roiling around inside him waiting to be let out.
‘Well, at least it doesn’t appear to be affecting your spell casting,’ she offered, finally turning to lead Hermione out of the Great Hall and leaving Harry to finish his lunch without having to answer a million more questions about his bond with Draco or the unfortunate need to translate everything Draco said.
He’d never thought Ron would be so cruel.
‘Do you still speak to them?’ Draco wondered, thoughts still on that first time he and Blaise had perfected the lubricant charm and had some fun with Daphne.
‘I expect proper chocolate to go with them,’ Draco informed him. ‘I owe you some new Quidditch gear by the way.’
They didn’t speak again until they reached the door to the common room, Granger somehow refraining from giving their joined hands a comment even if he caught her looking at them from time to time.
‘Anyway,’ Draco went on, ‘Andromeda was talking about how she was going to school Teddy because she wanted to send him to a muggle primary school but if he doesn’t get a proper grip on his metamorphmagus abilities it’s going to be a bit of a moot point. She can’t afford a governess and while she could teach him herself, she’s worried about his social skills.’
Draco sighed, his breath coming in a warm fog that mixed with the steam rising from the hot cider he was cradling in his hands. They’d picked the drinks up from a stall sandwiched between a stall selling glassware and another selling knives. Harry hadn’t even realised it was ordinary consumable food until Draco had handed him the steaming cup.
Harry’s nightmare jerked him out of a deep sleep just a few short hours later.
Would they listen to his other concerns? There’d been inquiries after Harry had found Draco in his holding cell, employees of the Ministry had been fired and some arrested, but it wasn’t enough. Sooner or later, if they kept on in this way, the new Ministry would be just as bad as the old and it would be like nothing had ever changed.
‘Is that how you did it, then?’ the Ravenclaw sneered, voice carrying in the corridor. The silence of his audience, eagerly waiting to see what would happen next, offered the perfect atmosphere for his words. ‘Go on then Malfoy, tell us the truth, who’d you let fuck you to get you out of Azkaban?’
Draco cast the standard detection spells on both secured Death Eaters and then laid the two wands and a handful of pocket detritus – none of which had more than basic spellwork on it – out on the pavement far enough away from the two that they couldn’t somehow use them but close enough to identify which of them the pieces belonged to and then transfigured a muggle newspaper into little labels that he tucked under them. He didn’t recognise either of the Death Eaters so settled for labelling them Death Eater #1 and Death Eater #2.
‘Hi,’ Harry choked out, voice thick with emotion and it was a wonder he could even see the portrait through the tears forming in his eyes. They threatened to spill over as he reached careful hands into the box to remove the heavy wooden frame containing the animated form of an older man in his late sixties, hair just as wild and dark as Harry’s with soft brown eyes and a wide grin Draco had seen time and time again on Harry’s own face.
‘See!’ someone declared, reminding Harry with a jolt that they had an audience of more than just Ron and Hermione. ‘He has got you under some sort of spell.’
‘I don’t think I love you.’ Her words are a relief, he can see it in the way her shoulders relax, in the way she sinks more comfortably into her chair. It’s an admission, something she’s acknowledging now because she can. ‘Not, I mean, I do love you Harry but not – not like I should.’
Of course, then she speaks, and it’s so far from what Harry was expecting but it certainly explains the green tinge she’s taken on. ‘Sweet fucking Merlin, were you in love with him in sixth fucking year?!’
As an adult he could see it. He could put that meeting in perspective and see that the witch was startled when she realised who Harry was and that Harry hadn’t been cold but nervous and unsure – and also a little annoyed by a boy who reminded him of his bully of a cousin. As an adult, he could see the nerves and confusion and how his petulant arrogance crafted from watching his father interact with people (and all the lessons he’d been taught growing up) had presented a brattish snobby child who was rude and obnoxious and wasn’t worth knowing.
‘Agreed,’ Mustafa concurred before turning to the gathered crowd of aurors and curse breakers to start issue orders.
Pansy reached across the table and took his hand again. The fact she missed on the first try was a good indication she’d had just as much to drink as he had. ‘He’s your father Draco,’ she sympathised. ‘I can’t hate my mother either.’
has become alarmingly respectable these days, they’ve not got anything wrong yet.’
‘Bloody hell,’ Ron blurted out. ‘Look at you!’
‘Right, okay, setting aside the absolute rage that’s going to induce in Hermione,’ Harry and Draco shared a look and winced before Harry carried on saying, ‘Why? Why has this been happening? How long has it been happening? Are those other magical children getting educations?’
The smile slid off Joseph’s face and he reluctantly congratulated Harry on his well-cast shield. Harry merely shrugged. His disinterested response seemed to annoy Joseph even more which was probably why he didn’t let it go, instead asking, ‘Have you used this spell before?’
Longbottom nodded. ‘Couldn’t sleep either?’
It was only the last time he’d been out with her that he’d returned bloody and broken. He could appreciate that what happened to the both of them after that incident might have earned him her respect, perhaps even changed her mind about him – she had been the one to suggest they properly train him up because they could have a place for him, after all. But that didn’t explain why the hell she chose that moment to protect him and it limited Draco’s ability to keep himself alive. Winthrop might not hate him, and she’d certainly never openly shown a wish for him to drop dead like some of the aurors he’d been forced to work with, but that didn’t mean Draco trusted her to watch his back. There were only three people Draco trusted to do that and the last of them was still at the Ravenclaw table having her breakfast. The second was his mother.
But she wasn’t ready for that yet.
the Ministry – she didn’t want to be adversarial in her approach, she’d had a glimpse of how poorly that went in fourth year with SPEW. What she wanted was to be a part of the changes at the Ministry. She wanted to be like Percy taking red ink and a team to the archaic wizarding laws (although perhaps without the guilt that drove him). She wanted to be like Draco and his mother (as terrifying as such a thought was), building a new school system to encourage every magical child to mingle and mix and gain the best education.
Harry laughed, ‘One of those fancy hot chocolates you like so much from Honeydukes, then.’
The bond didn’t work that way. It was raw and pure. It was secrets and truths, shared hopes and stories. It was hours and hours, days and weeks and months spent talking and learning each other. It was time spent open and healing and broken and bleeding and it was natural and perfect, and it was exactly the kind of love that Harry deserved after all he’d been through but the fact it was with Draco Malfoy just…
There were quite a few surprised (and pleased) gasps. Draco chanced a glance at Granger and was unsurprised to find her looking at them with satisfaction as though they’d just proven a theory of hers correct. He supposed they likely had. He pointedly failed to acknowledge the look of amusement on Girl Weasley’s face because he refused to give her the satisfaction.
Because Draco was gone. It didn’t matter that Harry loved him or that his sentence in Azkaban was just days from being over, Draco was gone and in that horrible grief filled moment, he took Harry with him, leaving behind a shell of himself, broken by the passing of a boy he should have hated but was instead the man he loved, when even Voldemort and the war and his own death hadn’t managed.
‘True,’ Harry conceded. There was every chance these two kids new more about Harry than he’d ever known about himself growing up – hadn’t Draco tried to explain it to him multiple times what it was like growing up and hearing the legends? Hadn’t Hermione told him the very day they’d met that he featured in a number of history books? And that was before all the stories were coming out about his post-war work with the Ministry that further painted him as a hero.
‘The Malfoy boy is dead,’ Kingsley repeated and there was a strange undercurrent to his words that Harry might have mistaken for grief but that couldn’t be right, no, it must be anger because Malfoy was locked away in a holding cell and the only people who had access to him down there were…
‘Impressed,’ Granger repeated, her voice strained, eyes darting between the two of them. ‘Harry, you let Malfoy write on you in blood!’
Harry grinned. ‘Thanks, but it’s not a secret. You can shout it from the Astronomy Tower if you want to.’
Ginny snorts. ‘You don’t understand anything!’
Harry hastily pulls his head out of the floo and steps back. Draco steps through a moment later, any of his hesitation and worry hidden behind the mask he always pulls on to protect himself.
The fact he’d not even hesitated to let Draco try probably should have been a clue as to how much he’d come to trust and care for Draco. It had still taken him another three days to work it out.
‘Shut up, Harry,’ she says, ‘I’m talking to your boyfriend.’
‘Where is the slimy Slytherin git?’ Ron asked.
And so, despite the very real desire to hide away in his room where no one but Luna would come looking for him, he gathered up the necessary books and made his way to Herbology. At least in that class he had Sprout.
He caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror as he went to drop his towel in the laundry basket and paused for a moment. He didn’t often see what others saw when he looked in the mirror, too often he still saw scrawny Harry Potter with the broken glasses and messy hair and the hollow look of someone who didn’t have anyone and hadn’t been fed properly in a while.
‘Are you being summoned?’ Harry hurriedly demanded. He hadn’t taken his arm from around Draco and Draco wished that made some sort of difference, that he could take comfort from the gesture, but tears were stinging his eyes and his arm
,’ Harry murmured with feeling. To be fair, he’d never actually regretted it, the man spat on McGonagall, and Harry had been in a very high stress situation, but standing on the edge of the Carrow property, looking at a dragon chained and tortured, he was really feeling as though that hadn’t been enough punishment and could understand Marigold’s desire to resurrect and torture him some more.
Bill nodded sharply and jogged back to Charlie. Harry watched him go before he turned back to the dragon. He and Draco didn’t share a word as they studied the creature. Harry didn’t understand that kind of cruelty and he didn’t want to understand what use Voldemort might have for a dragon.
Sometimes though, Draco just wanted the quiet of his room. He’d already been in bed when Harry came in and he’d sat propped up in bed, sketchbook on his bent knees, and watched Harry kick off his boots (Draco preferred them over his hideous trainers) and shirk his jeans and t-shirt. He watched quietly as Harry tugged on a pair of cotton sleep pants, the ones in soft grey that Draco had bought him as a joke – they were covered in broomsticks – before he slipped into the bathroom in bare feet. He listened to him brush his teeth, go about his normal night-time routine (it contained at least four steps less than Draco’s) and once he was done, he whispered a soft spell to extinguish the bathroom light and then slipped into bed.
‘No they’re not,’ he denied immediately.
, but he started to see the torn and frayed edges of it all. He started to see the madness in tasking a child with something the Dark Lord himself had never managed. He started to see the punishment where before he’d only seen trust and honour and glory. He started to understand the fear and his own arrogance, and he learned what it meant to break. It was slow to happen, he couldn’t believe it – didn’t want to believe it. He didn’t want to believe that everything he’d once believed was wrong and twisted and that being a Death Eater and bearing the Mark was not all he had been promised, all he had hoped.
Ron’s aspirations were as simple as they were complex. He wanted to, for once, stand out because of who he was and what he could do rather than live in Harry and Hermione’s shadow – in the shadow of his family. He wanted something as simple as the chance to be his own person without being cast as the sidekick and, as hurt as he’d been when he’d realised Harry wouldn’t be joining him for auror training, that he’d be a full year (possibly more) behind his best friend, here he was now seeing that as a positive.
Draco hesitated to say what he was thinking but, in the end, he wanted them to understand why that might not be the case and why it wasn’t a bad thing if Harry and Weasley didn’t just automatically fall back into their friendship.
‘I’m really fucking lucky to have you,’ Harry agreed.
Then again, maybe it’s not. Maybe she’s going to require a little bit more because she’s looking at him like he’s lost his damn mind and also like she has no fucking idea why she should even be listening to him.
‘What about the squib seats?’
Only now, sitting across from him in the kitchens, she was considering that he truly had been changed by his experiences, only now was she seeing that maybe those changes were real and not just a ploy to clear the Malfoy name or gain favour with Harry.
Draco was both very familiar with Dark Arts and the pins and needles twitchy nerves could give off and so determining what the detection spells were telling him and proven ridiculously easy. Determining why this spell was classified Dark had not. But he’d left that problem with Bill and right then the only thing he needed to know was that he and Harry would be making just as slow progress through these fields as the rest of the Ministry team.
‘It could be a trap!’ Hermione’s worried voice was almost a shriek in the stunned horror of the kitchen. Hovering half out of her chair at the table like all the others, her eyes were wide with nothing but concern for Draco. Any other time he might have taken the time to appreciate that she was worried
‘That glass cut off the tip of an antler,’ Hermione informed him in a probing manner. Apparently questioning Draco’s tattoos was easier than addressing the larger issue of what exactly Harry meant about what he’d been through during the war. They’d need to talk about that though, eventually. Not all of it, not the details, they had no right to those, but there were some things they would need to know if they were to accept Harry’s acceptance of Draco.
Friday morning meant double DADA with the Gryffindors. For the first time, he was looking forward to it.
Hermione looked at him thoughtfully. ‘He really has changed.’
She glared at him for the obvious brush off but started to eat her own dinner, clearly deciding it was not the time or place to talk out his views on house elves and the need for better creature rights.
For a moment he just looks at Draco. Draco, who is curled up on the couch, deeply immersed in a file making notes. Draco who looks up with a smile when he hears the floo.
Draco considered her question. She wasn’t the first person to ask him about his career options. Obviously, that had been Snape as his head of house back in fifth year – the answer then had been something purely academic and somewhat lazy as he’d been a rich coward back then. Hermione was the first person to ask him about the curse breaking without seeming to think he owed the Ministry his time.
‘I know you’ve been teaching him everything you learn, and I want you to keep doing that.’
‘Of course, we will.’ Draco rolled his eyes. ‘Now go.’
He almost snorted at the thought. If only his father could see him now. He might have been supportive of his choice in partner but he sincerely doubted Lucius Malfoy had been stripped of all his prejudice after just six months in Azkaban. It hadn’t worked the first time, just because his precious Dark Lord was dead didn’t mean he would suddenly change his ways.
‘Another demonstration,’ Joseph explained. ‘You insist on telling me you know what it’s like to be in a real duel, well now you’ll get to show me. Mister Potter, you may go first.’
It was as if the ward itself detonated. Heat flared around Draco, seeming to crawl up his arm through his very veins. He gritted his teeth against a snarl of pain and focused his power down into the ward, fuelling the crude spell as it tore the ward apart. Somewhere deeper in the house he heard glass breaking and a moment later a pipe exploded, filling the house with the added sounded of rushing water.
Draco winced. His time in Azkaban was something of a sore spot for Harry, the prat seemed to see it as a personal failure. He seemed to think that he’d failed Draco when he didn’t fight hard enough to keep him out entirely. Draco disagreed, he knew he deserved that three-month stint, as hard as it had been. Some days, he wondered if he shouldn’t have been there longer. There were some mistakes Draco felt he would never be able to make up for.
at some point, just to thank them for being objective and actually writing the truth. He liked the way they captioned their photos too, something about it amused Draco, to see the slow transition he’d been making from ex-Death Eater to Ministry curse breaker. Perhaps he’d offer up a donation if they could promise to continue writing fair and well researched articles – about everything of course, not just him. He knew how that would look.
‘What?’
‘He’s still dealing with it,’ pointed out Harry, not even acknowledging Draco’s regret for his past actions.
When Molly revealed the Dark Mark and they all got a look at the way it slithered in motion, there were a lot of fearful gasps. Bill practically vaulted over the table to get closer and offer help, but Harry pushed him away with one quick shove.
Draco had raised his eyebrows at that, but Harry had elbowed him in the side before he could point out that both he and Harry had far less room in their schedules but were still managing the added commitment. Although, their lessons were sporadic and usually impromptu, most of the time they were more a result of the growing friendship between Astoria and Luna.
He was gone before Ron could say anything else and then he was so busy trying to catch up and learn the differences working for the British Ministry versus the Australian one that Friday rolled around without any other sign of Harry, although Hermione said she’d gotten an owl asking them to meet for dinner.
doesn’t have any of the really incriminating ones.’ Ginny paused thoughtfully. ‘It was a bit weird really. He said he barely even had to ask, the woman writing the articles just handed them over without complaining.’
‘I think I wanted to be your friend once,’ he mused and his words were slightly slurred now, that last swallow of firewhiskey probably a swallow too many.
Draco didn’t believe that for a moment, not really, he was just a touch nervous about meeting with Pansy. He hadn’t seen her since the final battle of the war and before that he’d been a right shit friend to her. He was using his new relationship, his newfound happiness, to give him the strength to reach out, to try and be the kind of friend he only just now realised she’d been trying to be all along.
Given they didn’t actually use most of the castle, Draco raised his eyebrows, happening to catch McGonagall’s eye as she glanced over them all. She gave him a strange look he didn’t quite understand but her gaze had moved on before he could think much more on it and then she was laying out instructions.
He thought, for one optimistic moment, that Weasley was going to say something bratty and leave, but he took a slow breath, winced, and said, ‘No. Not until Harry comes back.’
Draco’s nose wrinkled in disgust. ‘That’s an even worse idea.’
‘But they will work it out, won’t they?’ Hermione’s obvious anxiety over the issue had Ginny hastening to reassure her that Weasley would come around.
This, Draco was confident, she only said to rile her brother up further. Weasley had started to turn an unfortunate shade of purple, his ears looked like they were on fire. Granger, it seemed, did not approve, something she managed to convey with a soft sound and the tip of her forehead which was about all Draco could see of her behind the paper she held. She seemed intent on studying the photo carefully.
Harry’s friend on more than one occasion.
Draco smiled winningly, not even bothering to lie. ‘Yes.’
‘Not a clue,’ Harry confirmed. ‘I’ve no bloody clue how he hasn’t noticed. I’ve never once slept in the dorm with him and Neville.’
Still, Draco couldn’t help but drawl, ‘If you ruin my potion, I will force you to drink it.’
‘No.’
Harry came through the door just as Kreacher returned with dinner – the perfect timing of a good house-elf. Draco and Hermione looked up when he came in, but it was Kreacher who commented disapprovingly, ‘Master Harry is in need of a shower.’
Sending her this letter, with a sketch that could have been suggestive but was instead soft and warm, would intrigue her enough to respond, even if she wanted to hate his guts.
‘Oh well if you insist.’
A sharp piercing whistle cut through the air and the shouting cut off abruptly. Draco turned to find Longbottom had just arrived. His trunk lay at his feet and he pulled his fingers from his mouth to address the room. ‘What in the name of Merlin are you all shouting about?’
‘You think Hannah Abbot is pretty?’ Weasley asked.
‘Then I know you’re not the same arrogant git.’
Of course, they didn’t have much of a chance to dwell on that creepy likeness because Ron heard the words and, knowing nothing of the sentiment behind them, sneered at Draco, ‘Stay out of Harry’s head, Death Eater.’
Madam Pomfrey, placed her wand down and snatched up a stone bowl. Using a pipette, she steadily dripped a foul-smelling liquid onto his thigh. The itch as skin and muscle rapidly started to knit itself back together was almost as bad as the wound itself had been.
Positive thoughts were few and hard to come by, harder still with every passing day. Time in his cell was weird and hard to keep track of. It didn’t seem as simple as noting the rising and setting of the sun. The cold seeping into his bones crept into his soul and when the dementors came looking for him they fed that feeling, swelling the fear and the shame inside him until there was nothing left but the cold dead feeling.
‘What?!’ Ron leapt to his feet just as Ginny staggered dramatically into the room and collapsed face down on Hermione’s bed with a heartfelt groan.
‘There’s a common thread here, Harry,’ she’d pointed out softly. ‘Do you see what it is?’
Harry was wearing black jeans with a patch on one thigh, tears in the knees and black motorcycle boots. His dark green t-shirt showed off his eyes and his arms, which were up (fingers interlaced behind his head), were all lean muscle and tattoos that made Ron’s own arms feel like limp spaghetti. He just knew beneath that t-shirt Harry had actual abdominal muscles while Ron had simply let himself go, enjoying Mr Granger’s Sunday roast (and all the little snacks he liked to fill his desk drawer with) until he had what Hermione fondly called a “dad bod”.
Harry pulled his head through his t-shirt and looked over at him. ‘What?’
‘She’s what?’ Hermione demanded hotly. ‘Blonde?’ She raised her brows. ‘Short?’ She gave Weasley a sharp look. ‘Or did you mean fat?’
‘Want to come, Neville?’ Harry asked as he stood and stretched.
Days later and Draco had honestly thought the conversation he’d been preparing for would never come. They’d filled their days with friends and Teddy (lots of Teddy, Draco was wholly unopposed to Andromeda’s shamelessly throwing her grandson at his godfather) and after finally agreeing to a dose of Dreamless Sleep, Harry had gradually lost the sadness until his smile always reached his eyes and Draco didn’t think he was the only one to breathe a sigh of relief when he saw that.
‘Good morning, Malfoy,’ she said softly, still a touch wary, and sat down beside Harry.
‘No,’ she snapped at him. ‘I did not choose
I feel like this chapter sort of lost momentum by the end but hopefully that doesn't impact what I was trying to say!
Harry’s eyebrows shot up and rather than be offended he laughed. ‘Draco, you’ve turned down sex to study curses before – you love curse breaking.’
Hermione was taken aback by Harry’s harsh words but there was no surprise, no indignation, just the faintest flush of guilt, and Harry saw it just as well as Draco did, and he was
‘Mister Malfoy,’ McGonagall reprimanded sharply.
Ron could not mean that much to him (he wouldn’t
‘The runes are still on your neck. They’ve changed.’
He’d have to see if he could get a copy of the original photo. And perhaps one of their last appearance on the front page too.
How she thought taking the best friend who had always been sensitive about money on a trip to one of his many (many) vaults was anyone’s guess, but he’d extended the invitation to Ron with only minimal grumbling because Christmas was a week away and he still hadn’t found a good time to tell Ron he wasn’t going to the Burrow for the break. He’d be there for Christmas of course, he’d assured Molly multiple times that he and Draco would be there for Christmas dinner, but they’d be arriving on the day just as Bill and Fleur would be.
Hermione gave a soft laugh, probably more at the fondness she recognised in Harry’s expression than the words themselves. Ron was not amused, but he gave them both one more frown before Hermione prodded him back into focusing on his homework. He did as he was told but there was something in the frown on his face that told Harry his thoughts still weren’t really on his homework and although he could have asked, Harry let it slide. If Ron was frowning over thoughts of Draco, Harry didn’t want to know. If he was frowning over the realisation that he would be entering auror training without Harry then…well Harry wasn’t ready for that conversation either. How did he have the conversation with Ron about making the decision for his future based on what worked best for him (and Draco to a lesser extent) and that Ron had not even been a factor?
Well, read probably wasn’t the best way to describe what he was doing. The thing about these spells is they only worked for the caster. He’d found them in the same book he’d lent to Bill when they’d been looking for the right spells to bring the wards down and he’d known immediately how useful they’d be – if completely useless. They didn’t give off fancy colours or sound or even that one detection spells the Ministry used to teach which used temperature differentiation, no, these ones hummed along you nerves and without some considerable study in the Dark Arts would feel like nothing more than pins and needles.
‘Fuck that’s impressive,’ Bill had said when he had finally put all the pieces together. ‘Do you understand how rare this kind of thing is?’
Harry was taken aback – how had that story even reached beyond Hogwarts? – but before he could sputter out some sort of response, Draco was there crouching beside him. ‘He did,’ Draco assured them, offering a soft smile. ‘And he saved all of Hogwarts in doing so.’
‘Nope.’
Ginny grinned. ‘Done.’
Harry laughed at this. ‘I have no fucking idea what I’m doing, Hermione, but as long as I’m doing it with Draco, then I think I’ll be okay.’
‘Absolutely not,’ Draco replied with a wrinkle of his nose. That would be like dating a sister, which explained the horror in Harry’s expression, he too would see dating Luna the same way.
‘What if I’d listened to you and not lied about Norbert the dragon?’
Funnily enough, Draco had been more worried about the influence Granger and Weasley would have on Harry than he had the entire wizarding world through the lens of the
Maybe if he’d been forced to sit through a Muggle Studies class as a child, he would have seen how much of what his father was pushing him to believe was complete dragon dung.
Definitely not a conversation he was looking forward to and he imagined there’d be quite a few people sending angry owls to the Ministry (because they could no longer send them to him – some poor Ministry sod got to deal with all of Draco’s hate mail now) when the list of seats was released after the new year and they realised that the Malfoy seat was to be claimed rightfully by Draco. If they were lucky, Harry’s place in the Peverell seat would create such a stir no one would notice.
Draco didn’t bother to comment, he merely asked, ‘Did you see where exactly that ward was?’
‘Well, I guess that answers my question of how you’re doing,’ Pansy had quipped, with a healthy dose of sarcasm as she shut the door behind them.
Irritated again, Harry said, more sharply than he intended (which seemed to be the theme this afternoon), ‘He’s not a crap player. He’s bloody brilliant.’
Harry narrowed his eyes at him, exasperation positively bleeding through. ‘You could have done that in the beginning,’ he said sounding more resigned than properly angry.
‘Draco!’ Harry shouted, edging as close to the gaping hole in the floor as he could and stumbling when he misjudged just how close that actually was. Hermione and Weasley grabbed onto the back of his jumper to keep him steady.
‘Thanks, Hermione.’ Harry hesitated and then he rushed on to say, ‘You know I’m happy for you and Ron, too, yeah?’
‘Never mind Harry’s sudden interest in romance novels, Hermione,’ Ron complained, ‘I need help with this.’
The next time, when the aurors came for him, he was deep in discussion with Granger about a new article in the
They’d only turned up one more curse like the one Draco and his second years had triggered – Bill and Fleur had found that one in the dungeon. It had been another blood curse with a much sturdier trigger and even after careful study, neither of the curse breaking Weasleys had been able to identify just what was set to trigger it. It had the same magical signature though, so there was some comfort to be taken in the knowledge that just one witch or wizard had been responsible.
Draco hummed in acknowledgment but didn’t open his eyes. There were another two wards he needed to bring down first before they could let the aurors in to explore the house. Of course, even then, he thought they’d probably send him in with Mendenhall and Winthrop first, just to check there weren’t any more Voldemort related cruses for him to break.
It had been Draco that made it possible for him to finally get rid of the bent and broken frames his horrible aunt had purchased him all those years ago. Draco who spent hours and hours brewing a horrendously tricky potion and Draco who helped Harry get the doses right in the beginning. It was Draco who had pointed out such a fundamental weakness given his chosen career and then helped him find a solution. Draco who had done so many simple things for Harry that no one had thought to do before. Replacing his whole wardrobe might have seemed like a controlling move but, in reality, it had honestly never occurred to Harry that was something he should – and could – spend his money on.
Harry stopped grinning, sitting up straight to look across the table at his friend. ‘I think most of it’s jewellery passed down through the family,’ he explained awkwardly.
‘They stacked up his case files and reports, gave a detailed description of all the work he’s done when he was supposed to be restricted to Hogwarts and pointed out the good he was
That didn’t mean he was happy about following Arthur to the lifts. He settled in the rickety cage with a grumpy expression on his face that, unfortunately, didn’t deter a number of witches and wizards from trying to talk to him or shake his hand. As such, he was in an even worse mood when Arthur prodded him into Robards’ office and so he slouched into the visitor’s chair across from the head auror with all the dark moodiness of his fifteen-year-old self.
Ginny snorted and Draco thought he saw the corners of Granger’s lips twitch but Weasley had gone a funny colour beneath all those hideous freckles and Draco just knew whatever he was about to say would be awkward for all of them but especially Harry.
Ron might have been amused too but he had no idea what the fuck was happening. And he still didn’t understand why Malfoy was there. Weren’t they supposed to be meeting Harry’s wife?
‘Essay or non-verbal spellwork?’ Draco inquired.
Harry didn’t recognise the spells they came from, but he dutifully murmured them for Draco and Bill in English as best he could. After fifteen minutes of translating the soft hisses, Draco stopped casting and turned an exhausted look on Bill. He didn’t release Harry’s hand but that was more likely out of exhaustion and the need for physical contact than because he genuinely wanted to show a sign of affection in front of the Ministry employees.
The tired croak was the most beautiful sound Harry had heard. He lifted his head and as his eyes met Draco’s he felt the worry ease away. He’d known, of course, that Draco would be fine, but finally seeing his grey eyes made it real.
Ron had just finished a rather grand tale about lost love and murder involving the truly hideous silver candlesticks Harry had found in the back of one armoire and they were both having a good laugh when Harry bit the bullet and broached the topic with Ron.
Arthur smiled, clapped him on the back. ‘It’ll do Ron some good to get to know him. Come on, Robards wants a word before you start with Smith.’
‘Yes,’ Luna confirmed, not seeming to understand why her friends found that so weird.
When Draco finally felt the wards fall, her body was the first thing to be revealed. He had seen a lot of death in a few short years, enough that a glimpse was enough to tell him she’d not been killed the moment she set foot across the boundary. No, her death was slow and painful, and it looked as though there’d been efforts made to prevent it, but none had been successful. He couldn’t tell what exactly she’d been struck down by, but he imagined she’d spent days lying in the snow wishing for her death.
‘She’s Draco’s oldest friend,’ Harry repeated slowly but then he stopped to consider what he was saying and realised that meant absolutely nothing to Ron because Ron didn’t like Draco, didn’t know how much Harry
‘I’d very much like to go home now, Potter.’
He didn’t really taste the tea as he drank it slowly. The toast may well have been cardboard on his tongue. But Harry’s thigh was pressed solidly against his own beneath the table and that grounded him in the here and now. It was a reminder that this was real and the dream he’d had was nothing more than memory.
Ginny, being Ginny, made a point of noting his hair and flushed cheeks when they arrived at the Burrow minutes later. Something about the satisfied smirk on his face and Harry’s obvious happiness tipping her off. Thankfully, Harry didn’t notice, but Draco winked at her as he was swept into a welcoming hug by Molly.
He’d been studiously ignoring her although she’d remained on the periphery of his awareness thanks to Luna. The two of them had a quiet bet going about how long it would take her before she made a move on Harry. Luna seemed to have a lot more faith in her friend than Draco did – unsurprisingly.
He didn’t need Ron. He didn’t want him either. He
‘Thought you wanted to go for a run?’
‘You weren’t here,’ he explained. ‘You needed to get to know Draco before I just sprang it on you. If you’d come back and I told you straight off, you’d never have been supportive. But now,’ he sighed, running a wary hand through his hair, ‘now I’d like to think you know Draco better and can see that he’s not the complete git he used to be. That all that pureblood crap he had drilled into his head isn’t there anymore.’
‘Well,’ Harry grinned, ‘you’ve got my vote and I know you’ll get Hermione’s.’
Hermione didn’t want to
was the first day of November. Draco couldn’t help feeling smug about it. Not because he and Harry were on the front page but because, again, it was a good shot of the both of them.
‘Why?’ asked Ron bluntly, managing to convey that even if he was softening somewhat towards Draco that he still thought he deserved what he got. It was a sentiment Draco shared. He’d been absolutely gobsmacked when Robards had handed him a copy of the new probation agreement. It had taken Percy explaining that Harry had nothing to do with the decision for Draco to accept that some very important people were very impressed with the man he was becoming and the work he was doing.
Startled, Harry frowned over at him. ‘What? Take you where?’
He wished he could punish the Ministry for the wrongs they were committing. He wanted to show them he didn’t like the steps they were taking, that he didn’t like the way they treated Draco and all the other prisoners locked up tight in Azkaban. He wanted to rage to Kingsley until the man could promise changes would be made and that those changes stuck. He didn’t want to watch as slowly the old habits and corruption snuck back in, until the new Ministry looked much like the old and those in its employ were too jaded from failure to try anymore.
pretty,’ he stressed. ‘Keep making comments like this and you’ll get in trouble.’
Ginny shrugged. ‘He said he didn’t want them falling into the wrong hands. He’s been passing them all along to George so that the
Underneath it all he’d still believed. He’d needed to believe.
Draco shrugged. ‘They voted on it, but he had a lot of influence and he wanted to start every student off on an even footing and that meant not forcing magical traditions on muggleborn students.’
Harry was tempted but he thought he’d look like an idiot, so he settled for burying his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck and breathing him in instead. Draco shivered pleasantly and Harry, who was already plastered to Draco’s back, burrowed a little closer, gloved hands sliding easily into Draco’s pockets as Draco went back to his conversation with the stall owner, his own gloved hands gesticulating enthusiastically as they discussed something Harry didn’t understand.
Draco laughed, a raw broken sound that he hated to hear coming from his own mouth, but Granger’s words were a drastic understatement. People were talking, yes, they were already asking questions as well.
‘See you there,’ Harry agreed.
He hoped she knew that even if she’d broken up with Ron – just as Harry had broken things off with Ginny – that the Weasleys were her family.
‘What do you think my chances are of getting in a nap during my free period?’ Harry mused, not even bothering to look back over his shoulder at his two friends. His attention was all for Draco and it was doing pleasant things to Draco that he couldn’t act on in the Potions classroom.
Draco was asleep before Harry even pulled the covers over him and he stood for a moment smiling fondly down at him before he turned to head back to the bathroom and jumped when he found Ron looking at him through the open bedroom door. Belatedly, Harry realised he hadn’t closed it behind him and that Ron couldn’t reach through the wards to close it. Later, when he was thinking a bit clearer and wasn’t suffering from magic fatigue, he’d realise that Ron had been standing guard over the door.
‘That can’t be true,’ Hermione tried to dismiss his assertion with a frown but even as she was saying it, Draco could see the connections she was making, little things that were making more and more sense to her now that he’d blatantly pointed Harry’s isolation out to her. Again. He could have sworn he’d had a conversation with her about this, or a conversation around her about this?
Because that was really where Harry’s hesitance came from and why Granger had acquiesced so quickly when Harry had shot her down. Weasley might have been an oblivious idiot but Granger wasn’t, and she was making an effort not to alienate her best friend before she had all the answers. Draco wondered if that meant she was willing to alienate him once she did have those answers. He’d always thought she’d keep on hating him, that even when she learned the truth about his relationship with Harry that she’d never trust him and focus all of her effort on getting Harry to see sense and break up with him.
Hermione wiggled closer to him so that their bodies were pressed together from hip to shoulder, knees bumping awkwardly too. ‘I know it’s not the same,’ she said, ‘but you have always been able to reach out to me.’
Draco wasn’t aware Ginny knew about that and judging by the surprised look on Hermione’s face, she hadn’t known it either.
Probably about as bad as it did now, what with him standing over three tied up Death Eaters at the scene of an attack on muggles. Draco made sure all of his movements were slow and careful and didn’t put up a fight when the wizard started barking orders at him to lace his fingers behind his head and get on his knees.
Harry used the moment of distraction to incapacitate one of the witches. Winthrop and Mendenhall, who were used to Draco’s presence (and his Mark) each got the other two. Draco barely spared the fallen women a glance, he simply dropped his sleeve and strode through the final layer of wards. Once inside, he sliced open his palm and shoved the bloody appendage back out of the ward. Harry took it without hesitation and stepped right through after him.
‘I don’t want details!’ he hastily assured Harry. ‘Merlin, I do not want details.’
‘I have an exceptionally good arse,’ Draco replied, unapologetically.
Harry’s offended glare melted away and he smiled, somewhat sheepishly and admitted, ‘I have.’ With a shrug he added, ‘It’s easier with Draco. I’ve always known how to read him.’
‘Just…how did you know it was the right time?’
He was almost waiting for one of them to say it, to make a comment about his “saving people thing”. He wanted one of them to ask again if he knew what he was doing, if he had any idea what his friendship with Draco could mean to the other students at school and the wider wizarding world. He wanted them to ask him why he cared and whether or not he was willing to risk everything for a man who had done nothing to deserve his faith and his trust.
‘Draco, here, look at this and cross off all the texts you’ve already checked.’ Hermione shoved a roll of parchment under his nose, coming dangerously close to smudging the fresh ink of his Potions essay.
Hermione made a small noise that might have been amusement but also might have been disgust at his and Harry’s complete lack of interest in the movement of their new tattoo. Draco honestly didn’t know how to make her understand that he didn’t much care that it moved between them or that it was the result of their bond because it was something else that showed his connection to Harry, and it was hardly harming either of them.
‘I’ll say,’ Ron muttered, eyeing the tattoos he could see. Harry made it easier for him by pulling his arms from behind his head and holding them out for Ron to admire. Ron caught the glint of a gold band on Harry’s ring finger. ‘Alright, lay it on me,’ he said. ‘Married.’ He pointed at the ring. ‘Kids?’
He might have asked her what but as soon as he focused on her it was obvious. He’d been letting his emotions control his magic again and the temperature in the Hospital Wing was soaring with his fury, the water in the jug beside Draco’s bed was starting to bubble and hiss as it boiled. ‘Sorry.’
‘I didn’t lie – not really.’
It was so easy to make plans for the end.
They’d glared at her some more. ‘We’ve already been to see the mind healer,’ Draco had then informed her crisply. ‘She gave us a prescription for some dreamless sleep, but Harry won’t take it.’
‘Oh,’ she said with befuddlement.
‘Scorpius set the house on fire,’ Malfoy answered with a wry look, lifting the drink in a toast to her before he tossed back a large mouthful.
to be that person; I
‘Watch it,’ he hissed.
Draco actually laughed at this. ‘Sometimes. Honestly, though, I expected muggle things to be completely alien to me, I’m always more surprised when I find out they do things just like we do.’
Draco, who had been smart enough not to waste his time in a stuffy tower with the barmy seer, had never had cause to set foot in the centaur’s ground floor classroom. ‘Better than forcing eleven-year-olds to stay up until past one just to learn the constellations.’
‘We won’t be needing them,’ Mendenhall growled, when he asked about them. ‘Hold tight.’
He’d treated Pansy terribly at times. Now, with a new perspective, he didn’t blame her for the distance between them that grew throughout sixth and seventh year as he once had. Lying in bed beside Harry, knowing what he did now about friendship because of Luna – from watching Harry interact with Granger and Weasley – Draco understood he’d been a truly shite friend to her in the end. He didn’t blame her for not standing by him during his trial, for not visiting him or writing to him once he was out.
He was lying on the floor of a train compartment with Draco hovering over him and there was a familiar vicious snarl on the boy’s face as he opened his mouth to shout the harsh words Harry knew he deserved because he would one day get him killed. Only the words didn’t come and there was a moment of confusion because the snarl on Malfoy’s face didn’t match the soft words that were making their way into Harry’s head.
It didn’t matter that the war had changed him, he would still always be those things. He could share his past and his pain and his hopes and fears and all the in between with Harry and some of it with Luna. He could share bits and pieces of himself with Ginny and (fuck it)
‘You’ve met you, right?’ Draco joked. ‘You fell into a relationship with Ginny after your jealousy and (possibly) idiocy caused you to snog her in public without warning and the disaster that was Cho Chang really speaks for itself.’
Which was a terribly weird headspace to be in when Longbottom knocked on their door with a heavy fist and a mumbled. ‘Oi, you two awake?’
It was a muggle neighbourhood. Ordinarily it might have been a quiet street with family homes and large front gardens where kids could play. He imagined, on a normal morning, there might be people out tending to their gardens or walking their dogs. Perhaps on an ordinary day it would have been filled with muggles in their cars heading off to work.
There was no questioning who Draco would work with, the aurors and curse breakers may have been coming around to him but not one of them would trust him to watch their backs in those fields and he doubted he could trust them to have his.
‘Why the fuck is he in cuffs?’ he demanded, glaring at the junior auror – Draco had never bothered to get his name, but he did look vaguely familiar. They’d probably been at Hogwarts at the same time for a year or two.
Harry scrambled away from the table after him, calling his name in a panic, almost violently kicking his own chair out of the way. Molly, recovered from nearly being knocked over, was not far behind him, her eyes wide with fear and concern. Draco just kept stumbling away from the table and the crowd of Weasleys, arm clutched to his chest as though that could somehow shield him from the pain, until Harry caught him around the waist and steadied him. It was Harry who managed to pry his arm away from his chest but Molly who pushed his sleeve up to reveal the writhing form of his Dark Mark.
Harry grinned. Then he sobered, looking darkly down the corridor at the alcove just beyond the suit of armour. ‘Proper sex ed.’
detailing the sweeping changes Smith and Kingsley had been working toward at the Ministry. Granger was fascinated by the moves the Ministry was making in the post-Voldemort world, Draco was just impressed the woman who wrote the article seemed to know what she was talking about. As far as he (and Harry) could tell, everything had been reported truthfully, without bias and, in a manner that seemingly targeted the loss of its credence during the war, somewhat self-deprecating.
A lie, of course. Draco loved Harry’s hair, but he’d been stiff and sore and far from being alright, and that hadn’t stopped the two of them from arguing back and forth for twenty minutes before Harry had slumped down to the floor, dropped his head onto his knees and cried. It had been the first time Draco had offered him comfort and not received it and it had been awkward as fuck for the both of them. Neither of them knowing what to do or how to handle the unexpected confessions spilling out of Harry.
‘No,’ Harry disagreed sharply, hurrying to catch up. It sounded like a bewildered Granger and Weasley were following them. ‘You shouldn’t have to do this,’ he insisted.
Draco frowned at her. Why she hadn’t just gone down and met them in the Great Hall was anyone’s guess. Why Harry had come back to his room after he’d slipped out so early for a morning run was another mystery, though one he actually thought he’d enjoy the answer to. He suspected the reason Luna had come to him had something to do with forcing him into breakfasting with the two of them in the Great Hall.
‘There was very little pining,’ Draco had attempted to assure his father. He hadn’t been especially successful; the eyebrow had made a reappearance and Draco and deflated a little under his father’s scepticism. ‘Well, there wasn’t much pining,’ he reiterated. ‘Mostly I had to wait for Harry to realise he was attracted to me and we all know how oblivious he can be.’
‘Don’t look at me like that,’ he said. ‘Any more than four of them and you’d bloody curse the lot of them – or start swearing at them – and I don’t need McGonagall asking me where a bunch of first years learnt how to swear so creatively.’
Harry frowned as Draco tilted his head as though he were listening to something. ‘Can Draco and I get through?’ he asked, glancing briefly at Bill.
But that was guilt she didn’t know how to process yet and so she tried to think about the things Draco had told her, the things Harry had admitted to, about how hard it was being on the outside of the wizarding world. The fear and the confusion and the not knowing. She tried to think about all the pain she could have caused her parents – because Draco had a point when he said she was never going to be quiet about her views – and she told herself she’d done the right thing. She’d told herself that her parents were safer and happier not knowing the dangers they were in, not knowing the dangers she was in.
at a distance.
the type to pry. She wasn’t so easily shrugged off by Harry’s answer, even if it was the truth, but the manner in which she demanded answers was equally as unlikely to get a truthful response. Draco didn’t blame Harry, he’d actually been interrogated by aurors and once the right people started asking the questions (and not simply attempting to beat answers out of him), he thought the experience much like watching Granger try to get answers out of Harry.
He snorts. He can’t help it. Rubbing his head where he knows there’s going to be a nice big bruise, he glares at her. ‘I probably deserved that.’
‘You’ve got shiny jewels?’
Joseph looked more annoyed than anything else at the response and turned to Harry as though it were somehow his fault that their teacher wasn’t properly prepared to teach a class of war veterans. Granger, ever the teacher’s pet, took pity on him because she hesitantly spoke up into the resulting silence.
‘Draco,’ Harry asked, sudden and urgent. ‘Did you trigger it?’
Harry had twisted around so he was facing Draco, mirroring his position and pointed a finger at him. ‘Just because I’m struggling doesn’t mean you need to miss out on sleep,’ he’d insisted.
‘I should hope so.’
, he didn’t know how to reach out and talk to other people who didn’t talk to him first and being famous hardly made it easy. It was simpler just to ignore everyone, that way his fame never got in the way. That was just at Hogwarts, mind you, I think it got dramatically worse when he went home for the summer. Just imagine it, Hermione,’ he implored. ‘Every summer when he went home, he was shut out. He was completely cut off from the wizarding world and the only support system he had.’
Draco placed his teacup down on the table with enough force to slosh tea over the rim. ‘You’re being stupid.’
‘You’re making it worse,’ Ginny chided with a soft smile. ‘Go. I’ll stay with him.’ She drew her wand when Harry still didn’t stand. ‘I’ll watch over him,’ she promised and the look she gave him was every inch the woman who had gone toe-to-toe with Bellatrix Lestrange and survived.
But his voice was soft when he spoke to Harry, saying, ‘You should go, you shouldn’t have to hear this.’
Harry looked over at him startled. ‘What do you mean?’
In answer, Mendenhall turned to Draco. ‘Does this change anything you told us?’
How he’d managed to avoid it was honestly just a combination of his usual dumb luck and his trademark obliviousness.
Draco made a sleepy, content sound, and was out before he could worry on the implications of
That was another thing they’d talked about.
Draco laughed – potentially inappropriate given the current circumstances but rather fortunate when the sound triggered a witch bottle just a step ahead which – once they’d got done fending off the cloud of poisoned darts – they discovered had been buried upright in the ground to shoot the poison darts directly up into whichever poor sod stepped near enough.
‘It’s a witch writing them, then?’ Draco asked. ‘Do you know who she is?’
Not that Harry could blame him for being preoccupied. Draco had a book on rare curses resting on his raised knees, feet propped up on the low table that Harry suspected one of the Hufflepuffs had dragged over earlier when they’d come looking for Herbology help from Neville. Every so often Draco would flick a finger to turn the page of the volume he’d taken from the Lestrange vault – this one in hopes of finding the missing curses they needed to bring the wards down around the Carrows’ home.
He didn’t think anything of it. He had a vague idea that his childhood best friend worked as an auror and he was looking forward to seeing him again, feeling a longing for things forgotten with time, and so he kept an eye on the reports that he’d been given, the ones he was told would get him up to speed on the current cases for his new Department, looking for the name Potter. He found a couple of cases he thought might have been Harry’s – but it was hard to tell because everything was labelled with initials in the briefs and he never did come across any HP’s written in them.
doing – and then they pulled in Smith and a couple of aurors and arrested a bunch of the Wizengamot on corruption charges.’
‘Ah. Can you do that?’ Harry tried to picture the Manor as it was now, with big empty rooms, fresh coats of paint going up and the walls they’d knocked out to open up even more space.
Draco turned his head away, studied the stalls they passed still looking for anything that caught his eye. ‘There were almost four hundred magical children allegeable,’ he said.
repercussions) meant that he didn’t just provide his own image to work with but was given smell and taste and feel as well. The wards for him were tangible. In this state, he could reach out and touch them, smooth his hands over the soft curves where they guarded the property. There was no spiderweb for Draco, not this time.
They could have hated Draco, could have held so many things he and his family had done in the war against him, but that wasn’t them. They’d taken Harry’s words and actions and looked to Draco’s own actions before they passed judgement. He hadn’t asked them for forgiveness, but he had written them all letters the moment he was free of Azkaban and allowed access to an owl, he’d written at length of his regrets and his hopes to someday be the kind of man they would be proud to have their son love.
), she was his friend and he loved her and it didn’t matter that he wasn’t comfortable sharing all this with her – not the deep dark bits of himself – because he had to remind himself that she loved him too and she just wanted to understand.
Today it wasn’t. The street was in chaos. Aurors in their hideously impractical scarlet robes were snapping spells back at a group of four witches standing on the lawn of an apparently ordinary muggle house that looked the same as every other house on the street. Another two wizards were attempting to fire spells at the aurors’ backs from the other side of the street, where they’d hidden behind a car parked at the curb.
But that was a problem for the future and not right now. Now, they had enough things to be worrying about.
Harry tried to look offended, but he ended up laughing. ‘The fact you’re the one saying that – and meaning it – should be stranger than it is.’
‘Malfoy,’ the call was sharp and commanding and Draco turned to look back at the huddle of curse breakers to find Mustafa’s eyes firmly on him still. ‘With us,’ he commanded.
With a snort, he tossed the magazine onto Hermione’s bed and ignored the way Hermione raised her eyebrows and reached back to pick it up. As she’d dropped right back onto the floor to sit beside him when she came back, he couldn’t avoid noticing the way she rolled her eyes as she looked through the glossy pages or the exasperated sound she made when she realised the detailed breakdown of Draco’s wardrobe and his new sense of fashion went on for four pages – one of which made a point of mentioning Harry’s new wardrobe (complete with a full-page spread) and crediting Draco for the new sense of style he was sporting.
