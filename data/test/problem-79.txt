“I just wanted to know,” Harry said between gasps of laughter, “what would happen...if you tickled...a sleeping Draco.”
Harry stared at her. It was as though she’d read his mind, things he’d never even thought to say out loud, things he would never have admitted to wanting. He thought about saying
The look on Malfoy’s face was priceless and absolutely worth it and Harry had to work hard not to start laughing. “I don’t believe you. Impossible. I will march up to the school and demand to know the truth from the Sorting Hat. You wouldn’t have lasted a
He shut the door behind him and wiped at his eyes furiously, took a walk out past the Quidditch pitch and the Herbology greenhouses.
The music in the background helped, because Malfoy was humming along absently. While he instructed Harry to step that way, no,
didn’t like me!” Malfoy says furiously. He stops walking, crosses his arms and glares at Harry. Harry glares back, out of reflex, and stops too.
stalked anyone!” Harry protested vehemently at this gross slander. “Especially not Malfoy, I – he was doing evil things! I had to stop him!”
“If you say so,” Luna says doubtfully. “It could just be Wrackspurts, I suppose. Happens to the best of us. Speaking of Wrackspurts, have you and Draco figured your relationship out yet? Sex is always a good solution.”
So their first few days staying in Grimmauld Place were spent cleaning it up, like the summer before Harry’s fifth year, except this time there weren’t any dark objects putting up a fight, the house and Kreacher seemed to actively be helping them, and Harry was having a much better time. Even Walburga kept the shouting to a minimum, and seemed to be taking some time to rest. Malfoy had charmed his gramophone to fit in his school trunk, and he tinkered with it for hours until Patrick Swayze was singing while they worked.
“Hermione found out,” Padma said, “and she said we had to ask Professor McGonagall, but we figure she’s probably going to let us.”
“That Slytherin girl?” Ron asked, and Harry remembered the girl at the Slytherin table yesterday, all golden hair and stately blue eyes, examining her manicure.
There it was again, that nagging feeling. Malfoy in the morning, sleepy-eyed and grabbing at Harry’s arm, his shirt slipping down. Something he was forgetting. Something he was trying not to notice.
The first thing Harry notices when he wakes up the first time is Malfoy. He’s still asleep, his chin tucked against Harry’s shoulder and his arm thrown across Harry. Their legs are tangled together, their bodies curved to face each other. The joy in Harry’s chest is so fierce it feels like it’s too much for one person to feel.
Harry had known he was bisexual since fourth year, when Sirius and Remus had latched onto his descriptions of Cedric Diggory with a suspicious gleam in their eyes, and literally started crying about his Big Bi Crushes, as they dubbed it. He had no doubt the Dursleys would have been horrified, but he’d stopped caring about their opinion a long time ago, and hadn’t talked to them since he was thirteen years old. In the wizarding world, it was mostly seen as perfectly acceptable, except in some pureblood circles. He had told Hermione and Ron in fifth year, and they hadn’t batted an eye. But Cedric Diggory was one thing. Malfoy was an entirely different thing.
He tried to help as best as he could. He sat with Arthur and showed him how to use a Muggle telly. He helped Molly prepare dinner and set the table with Percy. He got drunk with Ron and George as George turned to inventing in his grief, finishing every idea Fred had ever had with trembling hands. He dragged Charlie into conversations to keep him away from Molly asking about his love life. He asked Bill questions about Curse-Breaking without mentioning Malfoy’s name, and listened to Fleur talk about potential baby names with a hand on her stomach, glowing with happiness. He stayed with Ron most of all, standing by him and making sure he was alright, because Ron so often worried about his family over himself.
!” Malfoy said enthusiastically. “At least, all the evidence points that way, that they didn’t get on at all. But for the rest of their lives, they were never separated. Meera Shafiq led Isolda back to Britain, where no one was much inclined to argue with a girl who’d come back from the dead. And the goblins had raised her as their own for a long time, shared secrets with her. That’s why their statues are at Hogwarts; the two of them managed to get the humans and goblins to get along. It was a brief time of peace and prosperity for magical Britain, and Isolda campaigned for rights for Muggleborns and other magical creatures. Of course, then she died, and she’d never married, and everyone started fighting amongst themselves again. There’s great debate but I think Isolda and Meera Shafiq were probably. You know.” Malfoy waggled his eyebrows. “And that’s why she never married despite the threat to her line. Binns
He did not have enough energy to hate Draco bloody Malfoy, even though he could remember hating Malfoy more than anything, hating Malfoy so much it kept him up at night, hating Malfoy so much he let them provoke each other, just so he could satisfy that particular urge to punch him in the face. He could not bring himself to do it now. He supposed there was a reason he had saved Malfoy’s life three times in the past year, but it felt incredibly like he was paying for that now.
“Potter, you’ve made Pansy smile,” said Malfoy, coming back from the table with an incredible amount of drinks that were mostly being held by Goyle, “who are you?”
And Malfoy had not answered, but Harry could guess at the truth. He made himself some hot cocoa and sat next to Malfoy.
Malfoy, deciding to overcompensate for their emotional conversation, keeps up a steady stream of chatter as they continue towards the register, barely putting up a fight when Harry cajoles him out of the shopping cart. The cashier, young, with a haircut vaguely reminiscent of some of Harry’s students, watches them in an entertained way. Harry even manages to stop Malfoy from showing off his prowess when it comes to Muggle money. They walk out of the store, Harry with an air of triumph around him and Malfoy with a dramatic, sulky expression on his face. Harry can tell he isn’t really upset. This was a good idea. They’re completely back to normal now.
“Race you to the pitch,” Malfoy said, and he leaped up to run down the stands before he had finished speaking because he was a rotten cheater.
“No,” Harry says. “Listen.” It’s almost like he’s back in sixth year, hissing at a Malfoy who was tired and tired and hated Harry.
Okay, so he’d kissed Malfoy, and wanted to do it again, and again. That didn’t mean he liked Malfoy in a romantic way. He wasn’t even sure whether he liked Malfoy in a non-romantic way. They’d sort of started living out of each other’s pockets by accident, and then kept on doing it. For the most part, Harry thought that they couldn’t stand each other, but also that they’d die for each other.
“No one cares what you do,” Malfoy interrupts, jabbing his quill in his inkpot with rather more force than necessary and sloshing a fair bit on the table.
Malfoy was standing with his mother, his father absent, stiff and pale, dark circles under his eyes visible from where Harry was standing. He – he was wearing Muggle clothing. Jeans, and a jumper that looks a bit big on him, but it was a nice colour, Harry thought absently. He didn’t know Malfoy even knew how to put Muggle clothing on, and he couldn’t see any other Slytherins near Malfoy. He did not see Pansy Parkinson, or Goyle.
When Malfoy went to his Arithmancy class, he went out to look at the statues: the queen’s serene expression, the knight’s devoted pose.
,” Malfoy ranted, “and did he listen to me? No. Do you know how many people are taking his N.E.W.T class? Five! And I don’t think he’s even noticed!”
“I love you, Harry,” Hermione mumbles, her eyes full of tears and her arm around Ron’s shoulders. Hermione may be a little drunk too. She’s a sappy drunk; so is Harry, it’s something they’ve got in common.
Harry’s mouth twitched, which was the period in time where he became aware that the rest of their housemates were creeping down the stairs to see what all the fuss was about. On the boys’ staircase, Ron and Hermione were rushing down with their clothes rumpled, Hermione’s hair sticking up in every direction, and identical expressions of concern on their faces. Blaise Zabini leaned against the banister with an expression of extreme judgement and trepidation, wearing fancy-looking pyjamas that set off his dark skin and handsome face perfectly. Neville and Justin Finch-Fletchley were absent, but Dean, Seamus, and Terry Boot were looking on with raised eyebrows. On the girls’ staircase, Parvati stood by Daphne Greengrass, who was wearing a lacy slip of a night dress that went down to her feet and had a gaping neckline; each of them had their shining hair, one dark and one light, braided back identically in a coronet. Padma Patil watched on with indifference, next to her Susan Bones and a girl with brown skin and curly, short hair who Harry assumed was Lisa Turpin.
When he looked behind him, Malfoy was smiling and smiling at him like he couldn’t help it. “You are,” he agreed.
“Oh...you didn’t say anything special, you only told us you were ‘going out for dinner with Malfoy’.”
“I don’t care,” Blaise proclaimed, “I’ve given my heart away. Although I would appreciate some tips.”
Harry looked away because he thought if Malfoy kept smiling he might do something stupid like kiss him. “I’m sorry that you don’t want me to mean it,” he said in a low voice. “But I do.”
“You have to read it,” says Malfoy, and lapses into a rant about all of the virtues of the book, as though Harry hasn’t heard it all for the past week. As though Harry didn’t buy the book because Malfoy loved it so much.
“Yes,” Malfoy said sharply, like he was waiting for Harry to laugh. Harry couldn’t blame him. Eight months ago, he would have laughed at the idea of Draco Malfoy working retail. “For the summer. And Ester and some other girls worked there too, and we got on fairly well. So.” His chin tilted up.
,” Malfoy said, putting his face in Harry’s hair briefly to groan. “You’re not supposed to say it, Potter, honestly.”
“Good,” Malfoy says quietly, turning pink. “Because so do I.” Harry’s heart is beating so loudly he thinks Malfoy must hear it, everyone must hear it, the sound of his desire for Malfoy.
“This isn’t healthy, Harry,” Hermione insisted, “are you friends with Malfoy or not? Make up your mind.” Harry didn’t like talking to Malfoy about Hermione. He didn’t think Malfoy deserved Hermione’s forgiveness, or Ron’s, not that it mattered since technically, to Harry's knowledge, Malfoy hadn’t apologised yet. But Hermione had a point. In the dark Potions classroom, Harry talked to Malfoy like he talked to Ron and Hermione, and outside of it, he usually punched him in the face.
“Did you know,” Malfoy continues, “I’ve wanted to kiss you since you wore that leather jacket in fifth year. It was maddening, actually. I don’t think it’s fair for people to be so attractive.”
. Flying had always been easy, and flying against Malfoy had always made him feel alive. Only this time, Malfoy was singing Celestina Warbeck’s “Beat Back Those Bludgers, Boys, and Chuck That Quaffle There,” off-key in the air as he and Harry trailed circles around each other. Harry laughed so hard he nearly fell off his broom. He thought that maybe he could deal with this, that it would be fine. Then the wind whipped Malfoy’s hair into a frenzy and his cheeks turned pink from cold, and Harry’s stomach swooped and it was
Mad-Eye Moody screamed in his mind. Harry could picture how disappointed he would have been that Harry had allowed himself to be taken to an unknown location by a Slytherin.
He went down and made breakfast, bacon and eggs and toast. Malfoy joined him after, hopping on the counter and distracting Harry with his long legs and the lovebites Harry had left on his skin.
This was the truth and he hadn’t known it until he’d said it, and he wished he hadn’t said it aloud.
“May 2nd,” McGonagall repeated softly. “I thought you might like to speak at the feast that day, after we have our moment of silence.”
Harry kept looking at him. He watched Malfoy’s jaw twitch, a fine blond hair falling over his eyes. He slid off the table abruptly.
“Pansy was in hysterics at the idea of him going to Hogwarts without any of us with him,” Zabini continued, “especially when she found out you were going to be there too. She couldn’t go, of course, completely out of the question after what she said, and she wasn’t interested anyway. And who else was there? Goyle didn’t have the Saviour of the Wizarding World to testify for him. He was in no state to come here. Crabbe is dead.”
“You. Didn’t talk about it.” Hermione stares at him. “Ever? Harry, you’ve been living with Malfoy for three years and you’ve been friends with him for eight and you’ve never talked to him about your shared moment of passion?”
Malfoy sneers. The expression is so familiar Harry feels something inside him settle. “Have you forgotten already we’re supposed to be a couple? No wonder you have so much trouble finding dates.”
Madam Pomfrey took hold of both of them and sat them down on separate beds, tutting loudly all the while. “And quite right of him too! Students messing with healing magic...You’ve both always been delicate,” she said disapprovingly, grabbing Harry’s chin and inspecting his face.
“I’m kind of a coward,” Malfoy said abruptly. “More than kind of. I might have been the one to kill Dumbledore if you hadn’t made me change my mind. You didn’t have to do that. Why did you?”
Malfoy placed two fingers distractedly on Harry’s dimples and said, “You are incredibly full of yourself, I have been saying this for years – ”
“I used to have a really big crush on you,” Dean confesses. Harry is too gobsmacked to say anything. “Do you remember that time when Seamus kept glaring at you for no reason?”
He didn’t think about it when they all headed down to the first official Hogsmeade trip of the new year and pretended that they hadn’t all been sneaking out to Hogsmeade whenever they wanted, and that they didn’t have a stash of Butterbeer and Firewhiskey and Honeydukes chocolate hidden in Hermione and Padma’s room.
stupid. They’re not going to believe we’re really engaged, except for Thomas, apparently.” He starts laughing again. “And none of my friends would ever think that.”
“I was dreaming about the war,” Harry said, though he wasn’t sure why he was confiding in Malfoy. “And dying.”
He heard the familiar murmur of Ron and Hermione bickering and then falling silent, settling themselves down on either side of him. He wasn’t surprised they’d come, but he was hopelessly relieved. They were the only people he trusted himself to be able to be around right now.
Harry had thought faintly that Malfoy might have been the kind of wizard that used cleaning charms instead of doing things the Muggle way, or what Harry thought personally of as the normal way, but when he came out of the bathroom, a pleasant smell of mint toothpaste and the scent of vanilla followed him, and he was wearing pyjamas. It was absolutely ridiculous to see Malfoy in pyjamas, even though they looked like expensive silk. It was absolutely ridiculous to see Malfoy’s bare, white feet as he set his shoes neatly down by his bed. It was absolutely ridiculous that Harry had to get up and follow him, and that they brushed shoulders as they passed and did not start a fight.
Harry watched him for a little while, languid and lazy in the sunlight. “Merlin,” Malfoy said finally, sitting up and laughing sharply, “I can’t believe I actually slept there. Everything hurts now. What a disgrace. And your
Harry came back to the conversation to grin at Malfoy and say, “Oh, yeah, doesn’t it have your name in it?”
Malfoy started taking all the clothes out of the trunk. “We’re burning these and we’re buying you new ones.”
. When Malfoy got a question right and he turned around to smirk all self-satisfied at Harry, Harry rolled his eyes back. When the bell rang, he waited for Malfoy to gather all his things. When Malfoy smiled he smiled back, and he thought, for a second,
“Are you stalking me again, Potter?” Malfoy asked, something odd about his voice as Harry slowed down to his pace.
“I suppose,” Molly says anxiously. She holds their guest list in her hands, and is going over it for the twentieth time. She’s worse than Remus. Malfoy refrained from going to this dinner mostly because of Molly’s endless remarks about their upcoming wedding.
“Nightmare?” There was something in Malfoy’s eyes like understanding, or maybe it was mocking. More often than not, it was usually the first one nowadays.
Harry considers telling Pansy that she promised him tea. He has a strange thought that he doesn’t want Ginny to be here, after all. He likes talking to Pansy.
“Why not?” Malfoy was staring at him, flushed and desperate. “We can go back, and it’ll be the same – ”
Malfoy’s eyes narrow. “If you do that, I’m coming tomorrow to embarrass you in front of a class of gossiping children.”
“Did they appreciate the fact that I managed to make her play the Dirty Dancing soundtrack at all? No, Potter. They did not.”
“Draco is difficult to share a room with,” Zabini said. “I know because I shared a dormitory with him for six years. Sometimes he’d stay up all night doing something ridiculous like making Potter Stinks badges, or writing lyrics for an insulting song so you would give him the time of day.”
“Of course I’m alright, you idiot,” Malfoy said, and grasped for his hand, ignoring Blaise and Daphne’s laughter. “We have terrible friends.”
“I don’t like him,” Harry says, but what he doesn’t say is that thinking Harry likes someone isn’t a good excuse for Malfoy being moody. Possibly there’s something else going on here. “And that isn’t really my type.” The sporty part maybe. Good-looking is a
“Um,” said Harry, swallowing. “No? What? Er, I think we’re friends now.” Friends was a bit of a stretch.
Harry shrugged, moving over to sit next to him and swinging his legs back and forth. “It makes me feel alive.”
“Look,” he said quietly, in the corner of the common room when everyone was saying goodbye, handing each other presents and wrapping scarves around their necks. Parvati Patil was kissing Daphne Greengrass under a sprig of mistletoe while her sister and Blaise catcalled at them. “I’ll be at the Weasleys’ all break, and.” He hesitated. “Write to me, okay?”
Harry hugged his knees and looked down. “It’s just a day. It doesn’t mean anything. It’s really – it’s only that I’ve realised how little I actually know about them. And there’s only two people in the world left who knew them well, at least as far as I know, and I don’t know if they’d know everything I want to ask. They used to have a cat, and I don’t know where it went. I don’t know how they celebrated Christmas or birthdays. I don’t know what – what their favourite songs were, what Quidditch teams they rooted for, how they fell in love. I don’t even know where my father’s family was
Malfoy smirks. “Isn’t it obvious? You’re a ladies’ man. A savage. A heartbreaker. A sex maniac. A dirty deviant. A – ”
“I don’t think it’s a source of shame to you,” Harry said, grinning. “You did say that since fifth year – ”
He waited for hesitation and there was none: Malfoy kissed him back right away, legs around Harry’s waist while the rain kept falling and drenching them both, like they had been hurtling towards this point for months or years. Thunder crackled in the distance. They were both freezing cold. Malfoy’s hand moved up from Harry’s jaw into Harry’s hair and Harry tightened his grip on Malfoy. He had been wanting to do this for so long and he wanted to do it right and he wanted not to stop, not now, not ever. He had to be slow and he had to be gentle. But he had been hungry for too long, and Malfoy tasted like rain and he was gasping into Harry’s mouth, his hold on Harry’s hair so tight it hurt.
Malfoy from beside him kept cackling at the Valentines, and Harry kept looking at the way he was licking jam off his butter knife, which was frankly obscene and not
Harry let him do this without much fuss. “I thought you were studying with Blaise and Daphne in the library?” he asked as Malfoy dragged him down the stairs and out of the common room, past Justin and Terry, who saw that Harry was being kidnapped by a madman and waved at him merrily.
“I’ve always heard Gryffindors keep their promises but I will hold you to that,” said Zabini, setting the bottle in Harry’s free hand before exiting with a wink. Harry winced at the sound of the door closing.
after a while – , a fork of cake halfway to Malfoy’s mouth, and the same cake’s icing smeared over Harry’s cheek.
There were only sixteen of them, the last remnants of Harry’s year. The Gryffindors, seven of them in total, outnumbered everyone else: Padma Patil, Anthony Goldstein, Terry Boot, and Lisa Turpin from Ravenclaw, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Susan Bones from Hufflepuff, and the three Slytherins. They all stayed in their respective groups, casting uneasy glances at each other.
Harry had rolled his eyes, fighting the urge to smile. If Malfoy was asking, it meant he liked Harry’s breakfasts. And Harry sure as hell preferred making breakfast for Malfoy over making breakfast for the Dursleys.
Ron and Hermione, of course, had followed Harry, like they always had, though he could see in their eyes that they were simply dying to confront him about this.
“I reckon he was scared,” Ron said unexpectedly, shoving his hands in his pockets. “I’ve seen him, Harry, and I don’t believe he doesn’t feel the same way. Come on, all of school he was just trying to get your attention, wasn’t he? All he ever wanted was you. Bit embarrassing, really.”
He went to sit at the top of the empty Astronomy Tower after Malfoy had gone, because the alternatives were staying outside staring pathetically at the castle or going back to the rest of the eighth years, and he didn’t think being around people was a good idea, right now.
Ron leans over. “You’re inviting all of your students, Harry, honestly. Oi, why are you inviting that reporter Malfoy punched in the face?”
By the time Pansy, Goyle, Theo, and Millie had started planning to leave, the rest of the Gryffindors had come inside to have a drink or two. Ron and Hermione waved at him, until they saw that he was sitting with a crowd of Slytherins, at which point they began to look concerned for his sanity and physical well-being.
“What, exactly, are your intentions with my son?” she says coolly, her tea and biscuits untouched on the ancient table Malfoy had brought over from Malfoy Manor ages ago, ignoring Harry’s protests.
That is, thinks Harry, a part of it, but more than that, Camille’s Cakes is pretty much the reason he and Malfoy are together now. He owes Dean, Dean’s sister, and Seamus a whole lot.
Ron had his hands over his eyes and was asking Hermione if it was over yet, and McGonagall was beginning to march along to the Gryffindor table to break them apart, but Harry could see Ginny smiling from over here when they broke apart, and Blaise bowing to his audience, as Luna clapped vaguely. He’d never thought it would happen either, but he was glad for them. He hoped Ginny was happy.
He shouldn’t have said it like that. He shouldn’t have said it at all, but if he had – he should have planned it out, explained –
Harry winces. Neville had spoken a little loudly, and now some of the students are turning to look at them curiously. He doesn’t have time for this. His class should be starting in ten minutes. “I’m not – I’m not engaged, Nev.”
The party fizzled out eventually, until everyone was climbing up the stairs to their dormitories, Ginny and Luna sharing with the girls so they wouldn’t be caught sneaking out to their own. Terry and Justin led the way to the boys’ dormitory with a serious and increasingly nonsensical discussion on conspiracy theories about Lady Di’s death. They’d lost much of their number: Neville had disappeared in his room with Lisa Turpin a while ago, Ron and Hermione had gone to Hermione’s room, and Anthony Goldstein had thrown up and fallen asleep on one of the couches downstairs. Susan had Vanished the mess but no one wanted to wake him up.
ever do is complain about him complaining and insulting your hair,” points out Ginny, yawning. “Ron, did you see how badly the Chudley Cannons lost yesterday?”
“Morbid curiosity,” said Harry and watched him laugh. He didn’t ask what Malfoy’s nightmare had been about.
Ron and Hermione exchanged their meaningful looks at this, but they didn’t say anything, and Harry didn’t try to figure out why. He was too busy being annoyed at Malfoy.
“I have tea with your mother! And I’m meeting Pansy every week. Remus already likes you, and the only reason Sirius doesn’t because you two are weirdly alike.”
“He’s a bit strange,” Andromeda said, watching Malfoy argue with Teddy over which colours to use. “But I’ve lost enough family. I’d welcome getting some back.”
Harry absolutely could not remember why he had decided taking off his shirt and jeans and sleeping in Malfoy’s bed was a good idea. It was clearly a terrible idea, and he hated drunk him for not seeing that.
Malfoy’s been acting strange this whole day. First there was his inexplicable behaviour with Rafael, and then, when Harry had changed into his clothes for tonight, he’d been fidgety and had stared so long Harry had asked him what was wrong.
But they slept in the same bed now. Malfoy had charmed them to move together. The thing about being able to touch Malfoy was that Harry couldn’t bring himself to stop.
“Well, first it’s more about who they were,” said Malfoy. “There was this period of time, before the founders or the Ministry or anything like that, where wizards thought about having royalty, like Muggles do. It was this old wizarding family, died out forever ago, but if they hadn’t they’d probably have been on the Sacred Twenty-Eight…anyway, the family took place of power, essentially, and they had all these advisors and people to help them, and knights trained to protect them. At the time, wizard and goblin relations were at an all time low, and the family ordered the death of a couple of goblin families. So in retaliation, the goblins stole away the family’s youngest daughter when she was ten and raised her for their own. Shoddy decision-making in my opinion, but fast forward seven years later, the daughter is of age, and her entire family has been murdered by goblins or other wizards.”
“Hi Luna,” Harry says. He hops onto the counter behind Luna and starts swinging his legs, which are long enough to reach the floor; Malfoy leans against the kitchen table, probably trying to look cool. “What are you doing here?”
Malfoy, his back to Harry and his wand in the air as he repaired the chandelier, said, “I don’t know. I just liked it. I suppose it reminded me of dance lessons when I was a child. They were obviously never like that, but it was similar.”
than normal. They’re best friends. They’re going to go to Ron’s celebration party, and have fun, maybe. Everything will be great.
“Yeah.” Harry’s laughter died in his throat. “And he. Well, he doesn’t feel the same, so.” He blinked, twice.
didn’t figure it out till Easter,” Ron told him. “Only, then you were hanging out with Malfoy at Teddy’s birthday party, and you spent all of Easter break with him, and every letter was just full of mentions about him – Ginny told me she’d known since Christmas.”
with a smiley face at the end. Harry can understand what all those fans see in him. Rafael doesn’t mention their sleeping together, most likely because of Malfoy, and Harry is glad for it, because he really doesn’t remember much about it. Those days, he had been living for how he felt in the air: untouchable, sweat clinging to his collarbone, exhilarated, free. How he had been able to forget, for a minute, all that had happened. But he couldn’t have forgotten forever. Hermione and Ron and Sirius and Remus hadn’t begrudged him his time away. They’d known he’d needed it. Malfoy had been angry, and Harry knew why – because he had not taken Malfoy with him when he went to search for Horcruxes and then he had abandoned Malfoy again. Malfoy had been angry because he had needed to leave, too. It was a question Malfoy had left unspoken between them –
“The coffee-flavoured one was the best,” Malfoy interrupts, a beatific expression crossing his face.
Malfoy comes even closer, so he’s standing in between Harry’s legs. He’s close enough that Harry could kiss him. Before Harry can gather his courage to do it,
Harry was so busy staring around at their surroundings that he only caught the tail end of McGonagall talking, saying, “The name of the person you will share your room with will be written on each door as well as your own. Boys are up on the left staircase, and girls on the right. I expect
He was carrying Malfoy’s books and their arms kept knocking together on the way back to the common room. Hermione had dragged Ron to the library, Blaise was frantically planning out how to proclaim his love for Ginny, and Daphne and Parvati had Divination. It was just them.
“You,” Malfoy said, sounding strangled. “Oh, just – come on. Let’s go to bed. You’re ruining my beauty sleep.”
Malfoy shuddered. Harry tried to feel offended but couldn’t manage it, seeing as he felt the same way.
“Listen,” repeated Harry. “Whatever it is, you don’t have to do it. I’m sorry for the spell, okay? Draco, listen to me.”
Neville pushes his hair out of his eyes. “Hey, Harry. I was walking by, and I haven’t got a class – I just came by to say congratulations.”
“I didn’t want to have to admit it,” Malfoy told him solemnly, “but there’s something you should know, Potter. Daphne – was obsessed with you.”
shacked up with Gryffindors,” Pansy said. “I digress. The point is, he’s ours. So when he said he wanted to go back to this school, I pointed out that a crazed maniac who had tried to kill him in a girls’ loo was also going back to this school, and when he ignored me, I made Blaise come here to look after him. What are
He waited for Malfoy to nod and sit down next to Daphne Greengrass and Parvati Patil, who was wearing a butterfly choker with her head in Daphne’s lap, before he moved away.
, but instead he says, “Wait for him to come home so we can have a mature conversation about our feelings.”
Malfoy grabbed a glass of Butterbeer and started to drink. Harry cursed the Hogwarts rumour mill and said, “Well, it isn’t me that Dean likes, if he likes anyone.”
“There he is,” Harry says, spotting Malfoy’s distinctive white-blonde head in a crowd of people near the entrance of the Muggle pub they’re all currently sitting in. Dean, Seamus, Neville and Luna aren’t here – neither is Padma Patil, and Harry thinks that must have something to do with her fight with Pansy – but Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Blaise and Pansy are, and now,
“Hey,” Dean said, a bit surprised. “Blaise and Seamus are switching the music back and forth between Celestina Warbeck and the Weird Sisters, it’s giving me a headache.” He nodded towards the bottle in Harry’s hand. “Mind if I have some?”
, but when you realise later – it’s better, if we go back to like it was before. You said nothing had to change.”
“The Harry Potter I know,” Hermione says sternly, “doesn’t wait to find out if people like him back. If he doesn’t like you back, you can move on with your friendship. You survived the war, you can survive this.”
?” repeated Harry, thunderstruck, looking around to make sure no one at the breakfast table was overhearing this horrifying conversation.
Harry was beginning to despair. He couldn’t see McGonagall letting him and Ron share a room when all the other pairings so far had been two people from different houses, the idea of Ron sharing a room with Malfoy was disastrous, and the idea of him sharing a room with Malfoy was even worse. It was unfathomable. He stuck close to Ron, and they kept walking. The second-to last door said – Harry squeezed his eyes tightly shut and opened them –
are not your size.” He picked up several shirts. “These are not your size either, and they are the most hideous things I’ve seen in my life.” He picked up a pair of sweatpants. “These are not your size
“You listen to terrifying songs!” Harry shouted at the bathroom door from his position at his desk, where he was trying to complete an essay for Potions. Beside the cup of coffee Malfoy had set out for him, totally ignoring the fact that Harry didn’t even like coffee that much, was the assigned reading from the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He’d already completed it. Harry thought Hermione would probably be proud that he was starting on homework due for Monday on Friday evening.
“Don’t trivialise my job like that,” is Malfoy’s response. He grudgingly compliments Harry on the coffee, and takes out his
“Honey,” came the sound of Malfoy’s voice in the background over running water, “d-du-du du du du. Ohhhhh, sugar sugar. Da da da something something something.”
“People use the wrong pronouns for her sometimes,” Malfoy said. “Muggles haven’t got a Potion for if they’re born not looking the way they are. Sometimes they have to have surgery, and people don’t understand it properly. I didn’t know that before.”
February turned to March, the cold weather thawing enough that nine of them headed down to the pitch to play a makeshift, modified game of Quidditch with only two Chasers and one Beater. Harry and Malfoy claimed respective Seekers immediately, and Harry snagged Ron as Keeper, Dean and Seamus as Chasers, and Lisa Turpin as a Beater. Malfoy’s team consisted of Anthony as Keeper, Padma and Terry as Chasers, and Susan as his Beater.
“Right,” says Malfoy, his voice suddenly cold and faraway. “Maybe you should have Zabini be your pretend boyfriend, then.”
Harry stares at him for a few seconds, then shakes his head and gives up. Maybe Malfoy is a little jealous of Harry, for having dinner with Blaise. He and Blaise have always had a strange sort of relationship. The thought of Blaise and Malfoy together makes Harry feel sick, but he pushes away the feeling, and gets ready to Apparate to Pansy’s.
“Hello,” Harry said. They had woken up together twice before, but he felt his heartbeat quicken. He didn’t know where they were going from here.
“Alright, Madam Pomfrey it is,” Malfoy decided. And then he was making his way past Harry and closing the door. Harry frowned at the door accusingly, and then turned around to say, “No I’m fine.”
The moment Harry and Malfoy Apparate back to their flat, Hermione, who has either been waiting for them or has impeccable timing, comes marching up to them, eyes flashing and arms crossed in a frightening manner. Malfoy, next to Harry, inches away from her.
Harry got out of bed silently to join him, and Malfoy offered him some coffee because apparently he was crazy and had stolen several cups of coffee from the kitchen and stored them in their bedroom.
, for once in your miserable life,” Harry said, trying to keep his temper in check. “It doesn’t have to be like this. Dumbledore will protect your family, I
Harry could imagine. “You weren’t exactly an example of normal two-year old behaviour. Teddy doesn’t care about that. He gets loads of presents.” Harry gave him too much, according to Andromeda, but he remembered that when he was a kid, getting presents meant you were loved. He wanted to make sure Teddy knew that.
“I’ll try,” Harry whispers back, and lets her go. Then, again, there’s nothing left to do except wait for Malfoy, who was also talking to his smarter half (Pansy).
Hermione was talking to Terry about their Ancient Runes homework but Harry could feel her gaze drifting up towards him and Malfoy constantly. He couldn’t really bring himself to care.
“Good.” Luna nods. “I’m going to meet Pansy Parkinson. She’s also having some problems with her love life. I know Padma very well, you know, so I’m sure I can help her out. Wish me luck.”
Malfoy was now laughing so hard he was clutching his stomach and Harry couldn’t even complain because he didn’t think Malfoy had laughed like that since before sixth year and even if he had, Harry had never seen it. “That’s true,” he gasped. “You should keep it.”
Harry hadn’t thought about it, Malfoy or any of the other Slytherins coming back. He hadn’t thought much about coming back himself. He hadn’t thought about what it would be like, this King’s Cross station, bustling and suffocating, contrasted with the one he’d been in when he’d died, empty and – not peaceful. But something like it.
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry said, and tilted his head back to kiss him again, feeling Malfoy smiling into his mouth.
As he said it, he remembered that the last time he’d stayed in Grimmauld Place was in the summer, and that it was a horrible idea to invite Malfoy to stay with him, it would make everything worse. But he couldn’t stand the idea of Malfoy on his own for the holidays.
For New Year’s, Andromeda Tonks came over with little Teddy Lupin, who spent the whole time waddling after Harry. Harry tried to be good with him, tried to be patient with Teddy the way no one had ever been patient with him.
“I’ve already been threatened about hurting Malfoy twice,” Harry said, “so there’s really no need for – ”
Harry spent his Christmas break fixing up Grimmauld Place. He told Malfoy he would live there for the summer, and Malfoy had said, “That house belongs to me as much as it does to you.
“No,” Harry said, “it’s, er.” This last word made Malfoy start laughing harder. Harry glared at him and tried not to laugh. “I’ll change it back.”
And then fucking Pansy Parkinson Floos them. When all this is over, Harry is adding Pansy and Dean’s names to Malfoy’s
The door behind them opened and they both fell backwards in a heap on the stone floor, Franny falling to the side and miraculously still playing,
“Did you also have to follow him to the bathroom and ask me constantly why he wasn’t sleeping and why he looked sick?” Ron said. “Did you have to stay up at night and wonder where he kept going at night, and why he wasn’t talking to you or trying to bother you like he did every year before that? Did you have to contemplate missing Quidditch matches in order to follow him around some more?” Ron’s voice began to get a bit overwrought. “Did you, Harry? Did you?”
Ginny had been right to worry about her mother – Molly pushed them together at every opportunity. Harry knew she just wanted a little bit of happiness, but both of them were losing their patience by the time they’d been sent to wash the dishes after dinner and Molly had shooed everyone else away.
Blaise waved his hand around again. “That’s because back then, Harry,” he explained patiently, “insulting blood traitors was in vogue. I’ve changed my ways accordingly to cope with the new fashion.”
“What?” Malfoy looked up and followed Harry’s gaze to the door, where Mrs. Norris had appeared, watching them suspiciously. He paled.
The door opened noisily: Anthony Goldstein stumbled into the common room with his school bag slung across his shoulder. “Fell asleep in the library and Madam Pince chased me out with a feather duster, then Peeves tried dropping a water balloon on my head,” he announced to the room at large, looking around at everyone gathered in a semicircle on the staircases around Harry and Malfoy. “Er, what have you all been up to then?”
“You listen to terrifying songs,” Harry told him again, because it always deserved to be said. “You’ve traumatised me for life.”
“How’re you two lovebirds doing?” she asks pleasantly. Harry starts coughing. Instead of helping him, Malfoy laughs.
“It’s a good class,” said Malfoy defensively. “And if you’d known before, you would have laughed at me.”
He realised what an awful idea this had been when he and Malfoy were standing inches away from each other, and Malfoy was directing Harry’s hand to his shoulder, and putting his hand on Harry’s waist.
as they ran. They made it all the way to the third floor, near a classroom door, when Malfoy, pink-faced and breathless, skidded on the floor, almost stumbling. Harry caught his arm and pulled him up right before he fell.
Malfoy fixed him with a contemptuous look. “I’ve got to find her before Filch does. She is my pride and joy.”
“Er,” Harry said, and thought that Blaise really should have been more apologetic when asking Ginny’s ex-boyfriend that question. “Possibly? If you had less of an inflated head.”
“I know what you meant down there,” Malfoy said finally. “All this – all of last year – and it’s not that important, anymore, is it. I don’t know how to go back to what we were like before. You saved my life.”
“It’ll be dinner in a few hours,” Ron said, standing up and offering a hand to both Harry and Hermione. “Better tell him before then.”
“Roses are my favourite flower,” Harry says, squirming a little inside. Had it been strange to keep the flowers? They were a reminder of his mortification in front of his class, so maybe it was. “Not that you’d know.”
,” said Malfoy, mouth twitching. “It was obvious, and completely unfair, by the way.” He looked at Harry’s hair as if he couldn’t help it, and started laughing.
“Oh, I thought you were Parvati from faraway,” Daphne said, disgruntled. “Welcome back, Potter, Weasley.”
Someone knocked on the door; grateful for the reprieve from his essay, Harry stood up and opened the door to see an unusual grouping: Blaise Zabini, Parvati and Padma, and Susan Bones.
Malfoy didn’t go back to his bed or to his desk. He slunk down to the floor in front of his bed and put his head in his hands. Harry waited, and came hesitantly to sit next to him, leaning against the back of Malfoy’s bed. The room was hushed and no one else was awake, but the birds were singing outside, their window cracked open despite the chilly November weather, because Harry got hot at night and Malfoy slept with millions of blankets.
The eyelash is still on Malfoy’s finger. He brings his finger up to his mouth, and blows it away. Harry watches him to do it, his attention caught on Malfoy’s pursed lips. He thinks for a moment the eyelash will stick to his finger, but it flies away. Like magic.
Malfoy smiled weakly. He was not laughing anymore. He took off the glasses and turned them back into an empty glass.
Harry had no idea what Malfoy was talking about, but he was talking an awful lot, which was when Harry remembered that Malfoy had gotten hit by that bastard, the door, too.
Malfoy groaned, and ate his syrup-drenched pancakes instead of answering. But Harry sent an Owl to Andromeda, and a few hours later, they were standing in front of her cottage and she was opening the door.
Harry sighed and rested his head against Malfoy’s shoulder, looking up at the brilliant blue of the sky. “Is that Blaise.”
Zabini kindly ignored this and went on, “My point is that living with him is no drink in Diagon. It’s annoying.”
“Alright,” Malfoy said again, with a raised eyebrow. “I agree to your harebrained and ridiculous idea.”
With a Herculean effort, he then extracted his other hand away, trying not to jostle Malfoy. He opened the bottle of Hangover Potion and drank half of it, deciding to leave the rest for Malfoy but also having nowhere to put it. His head felt as clear as it would ever be and he felt less groggy, less likely to throw up.
Because Harry was sleep-deprived and Malfoy never stopped chattering, he let himself think about how he’d always thought he and Draco Malfoy would be enemies. It had been a constant in his life, something to count on, something to be sure of. He thought he could understand the undertone behind Malfoy’s words, which were probably mostly jokes.
They weren’t strictly meant to be wandering the halls even during their free periods, but Harry was swinging their joined hands back and forth, and the corridors were mostly empty except for a couple of students who mostly scuttled away when they caught sight of Harry and Malfoy.
Malfoy is cold to touch, and his hair is covered in snow. Harry thinks he has hated Malfoy since he was eleven years old, and that he has loved Malfoy since was sixteen years old, and that now he holds Malfoy’s heart in his hands. It’s both a terrifying and wonderful thought. He says, “Let’s go back home.”
Malfoy stares at him a bit, then shakes his head, and continues, “We can’t tell anyone about this until after we stop pretending.”
McGonagall came to a stop in front of a set of old, wooden doors in one of the north towers, guarded by a statue of a girl with a crown and closed eyes, and a knight with flowing hair that sat at her feet attentively. Not Sir Cadogan, Harry thought, meeting Ron’s eyes and smiling. Everyone stumbled back, not expecting McGonagall to have stopped; there were the general mutterings of, “’Scuse,” and a couple of people stepped on everyone’s toes as McGonagall turned out and squared her shoulders. Her speech was familiar and comforting, containing the words ‘respect’ and ‘inter-house unity’ again, and she smiled at them all. The look in McGonagall’s eyes was different, like she was relieved that they were all still here and like she hadn’t thought they would be, but she was the same and it was achingly comforting.
Hermione nodded. “To Ron and Neville as well. It doesn’t mean much, but it means a little. And you see, I’ve got a great deal to hate Draco Malfoy for. But I have to be grateful to him too.”
Harry thought irrationally of what Malfoy was doing for New Year’s, whether it was just him and his mother, which it must have been. Andromeda and Teddy were related to Malfoy, too. He wondered if they’d met.
Zabini leaped up when he saw Harry and opened the door out the common room with a bow. Harry gave him a weirded-out look as Dean walked through the common room door; Blaise leered at him, and Harry gave him an awkward nod. He gave them both a half-smile, so things were fine if embarrassing.
Harry is glad Malfoy never asked him. The answer is too complicated to put into words. That he’d been such a mess. That he hadn’t wanted Malfoy to see him that way. That he’d thought being alone was what he needed, but what he had needed was just the simple comfort of Sirius and Remus kissing his hair, or Ron and Hermione’s fierce embrace, or Ginny’s wild laughter – alive, alive – or Luna’s understanding silence, or most of all Malfoy needling him and poking him until he was human again. That he had been scared of his feelings for Malfoy. That he had not known if he was the same Harry Potter he had been before he died and came back.
“What d’you mean you lived through sixth year?” Harry said. He looked at Hermione, thinking that must be what this was about. Of course they wouldn’t have forgiven Malfoy. Harry didn’t know if
is right here,” Malfoy said pointedly. “Shove over, Pans.” Malfoy slid in next to Pansy, smiling at her affectionately, and Harry followed him uncertainly.
This made Malfoy smile a tiny bit. “She’s in the common room. I fixed it. It was Blaise and Daphne’s incredibly rude idea of a prank.”
. “We were pretending, you see, to be engaged, for.” Er. “For free wedding cake.” Well, that sounds ridiculous. But less ridiculous than what Dean believes, surely?
Harry shuffled against his pillow and kept looking at him, eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks and pale hair kissed. He tucked his free hand under his cheek. The other one had intertwined itself with Malfoy’s in the night. Harry lifted their entwined hands together and pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s knuckles, and then hoped no one would ever know he’d done that.
.” Malfoy laughed. Harry waited for him to get annoyed but he didn’t seem upset. He said the steps again, a soft murmur until Harry had almost gotten it, and when Harry did get it he couldn’t pretend it was a joke at all. He let Malfoy lead him past the portraits, under the chandelier, and Grimmauld Place seemed to move with them, the walls stretching out to give them more space and the lamps getting brighter. The sound of the gramophone got fainter and fainter, and Harry lifted his hand up to turn around and find himself in Malfoy’s arms, close enough that if Harry reached up he could –
Malfoy stood up, too, stretching and yawning, rubbing at his eyes. He stumbled a bit into Harry, and Harry caught him at his elbow, and it felt good, just to touch someone. They stared at each other, laughing a bit awkwardly.
His old home, in a state of disrepair even after the long months spent repairing the castle, was not going to be the same again. There were still holes from hexes and empty spaces at every house table. Then there were all the crowds of people trying to get a good look at him as he stepped out of his carriage, which shouldn’t have been something new, but the reverence and the way they spoke his
, Malfoy had said. “I,” Harry said, “well, I – yeah, I would. I would.” He got up from the chair, and stopped. “Professor? Who was it that Malfoy reminded you of?”
Anthony was still passed out on one of the couches, but Susan was sitting next to him reading a book, so it was probably fine. Harry didn’t see Ron or Hermione, and he didn’t really want to think about what they were doing with a private room. Ginny and Luna must have gone down to breakfast, or, he thought bitterly, they hadn’t been awoken rudely by Blaise Zabini, who was lazily reclining on a sofa and flirting with Susan.
“I can’t believe you both!” Harry said, and was startled into laughing, until all three of them were laughing and clutching at each other’s shoulders, voices echoing in the empty tower.
“That’s wonderful,” Remus tells him, patting Sirius gently on the back. “I’m very happy for you both.”
Malfoy shrugs again, lolling his head back. The lime lighting casts a yellow, artificial glow on his face. “Are we going to the pub tonight?”
“Human,” Harry said, and Malfoy let out a breath like he’d been holding it in for ages, shuddering until Harry couldn’t stand it anymore and he was clumsily pulling Malfoy into his arms.
“He’s had a lot of Firewhiskey,” said a frazzled-looking but fond Hermione. “I think we’re probably pushing our luck, McGonagall’s going to have our heads if we keep this up any longer, though I did cast about a million Silencing Charms over the door and to my knowledge none of the teachers’ offices are that close to our common room – ”
?” Malfoy said skeptically. Harry looked back to see him settling on the long wooden table of the dining room, the one they’d hardly used in the Order, his ankles crossed and his hands braced on the edge of the table.
Harry pulls on a shirt and goes to meet Luna, possibly finding out why she is in their kitchen at eleven o’clock or possibly not. You never know with Luna.
,” and the knight leaped up while the queen opened her eyes, moving to the side for everyone to pass and settling back down into their positions and becoming stationary again.
He gave up on sleeping and started writing a reply to Malfoy’s letter, the one that had arrived in the morning detailing all of Malfoy’s Christmas holiday exploits, which mostly consisted of:
Harry ignored him. He let his breathing even out, head resting against the seat of the settee with his legs spread out, and the sound below of the wind, the sound next to him of Malfoy’s breathing. He thought he should feel weird. He should go into his perfectly comfortable bed, which was a small distance away. He should tell Malfoy to move. He shouldn’t be able to sleep with Malfoy next to him. But then he felt Malfoy breathe in, and lie down opposite Harry so that his head rested beside Harry’s and his legs curled up on the rest of the sette. He felt Malfoy touch his hair, gently, hesitantly; it might have been a dream, but by then he’d already fallen asleep, Malfoy’s fine hair falling on his face, even though there wasn’t enough space for both of them, really.
“I see,” Andromeda said. Harry waited in dread but all she did was welcome them in to the sitting room.
“I dunno,” Harry would say, shrugging. He didn’t know. It was just – entertaining, a little, to listen to Malfoy’s rants. Malfoy had listened to Harry, so Harry listened to him, whether he was talking about the quality of coffee in Hogwarts or how it was absolutely insane to be turning against the Dark Lord. He didn’t like Malfoy, he hated him still for being the first person to call Hermione a Mudblood and for bullying everyone in sight. But sometimes he would forget that Malfoy was an awful person, and it was, he thought, because of Malfoy’s steady stream of bored commentary in lessons.
It felt like someone had Stunned him behind his back. He grasped for the door’s handle and held on to it for dear life. “Oh,” he said again.
“Why didn’t you like him?” Harry says, wondering if they need anything else. They probably do. Wondering if they
Malfoy is simmering next to him, either with anger or annoyance. “I’m afraid not,” Harry says, offering Rafael another smile, this one a touch apologetic for Malfoy’s attitude. “I’m pretty attached to where I am right now.”
And he couldn’t find Ron, even though Ron must have come back to the common room, because Hermione and Malfoy had Arithmancy together. Ron would look at him and just
He woke up from a nightmare about Sirius and Malfoy was already awake, sitting on the floor in front of his bed and working on his Charms essay. It hurt to think of Malfoy not being able to sleep for the past week and just lying there, so that he would not bother Harry. Even though it wasn’t like that wasn’t what Malfoy deserved.
He thought the Sorting Hat might have been right after all. He could have done well in Slytherin. Maybe he could have helped the rest of them too, changed their minds.
Harry’s not sure how to tell Malfoy not to be embarrassed, and not to worry about making a silent apology to Harry in the form of breakfast. He watches Malfoy burn toast and attempt to scramble eggs with a wince – there’s a reason Harry’s usually the one in the kitchen. Really, apologising to Harry with breakfast is
“Don't call me that,” Malfoy said. “I don’t want to listen. I don’t want to talk to you!” He had looked at Harry for one long moment, quivering, and then Madam Pomfrey had come in and kicked Harry out, and Pansy Parkinson had shoved her way in with Crabbe and Goyle.
and find Malfoy but Malfoy had already disappeared, presumably gone down for breakfast. Disappointed, but resolved not to give Ron and Hermione anything to exchange meaningful looks about, Harry waited a bit for them to come down, and they did soon enough, one after the other, probably because they’d been worried about him.
Under no circumstances was it easy, living with Malfoy. When was anything with them ever easy? No, it wasn’t easy. Malfoy had a habit of leaving a mess everywhere he went, because he was used to people cleaning up after him without him asking. They had a few fights about that. Malfoy always needed to have dinner at a specific time, and breakfast at a specific time, but he considered lunch basically useless. He slept an insane amount, but sometimes he drank a ridiculous amount of coffee and stayed up ridiculously late, doing something equally ridiculous like writing an article or making a potion or practicing Charms they’d learned in school – as though Flitwick was going to spring an exam on them at any second. He was always singing along to songs on his Muggle telly at the top of his volume. But the worst part was that Harry found all of these things endearing, and he got used to them quickly.
“So you’re not really neat and quiet and nice?” Harry said, trying not to smile. “That’s a shocker.”
He woke up in the night sweaty and shaking from a nightmare, a bad one about Voldemort, with Mad-Eye shrieking, “CONSTANT VIGILANCE,” at him and the dead of Hogwarts resting on the tables in the Great Hall. Malfoy moved his head to press against Harry’s shoulder and said, “Shhh,” softly, over and over, stroking Harry’s hair until he had fallen asleep again.
He could hear Luna talking to Malfoy about Wrackspurts and his careful responses behind them. Ginny looked thoughtful beside him. Things felt a lot easier between them now that they weren’t pretending to be something they weren’t.
“Yeah, of course I know,” lies Harry, “but I just don’t remember...d’you mind telling me what I said? To help with Remus and Sirius,” he adds, congratulating himself on such a good cover-up story.
He Apparates back to Hogsmeade. One of Malfoy’s employees is closing up the coffee shop, and Harry nods a hello at her. He doesn’t receive a reply but he hadn’t expected one: Malfoy trained these employees, after all.
He thought that this wasn't supposed to happen, shouldn't have happened. He thought he wanted to do it again, so badly it hurt. He could see his thoughts reflected on Malfoy’s face. They were nothing to each other, nothing, and yet. And yet.
This was nothing. He wasn’t fifteen anymore, burning with rage and being constantly aware of Malfoy’s sneer everywhere he went, and he wasn’t sixteen anymore, brimming with convictions over Malfoy’s guilt and following Malfoy wherever he went. He could deal with this.
But it is nice not to have to deal with Sirius and Remus’s own disastrous matchmaking attempts, which include: a disdainful Parvati Patil, a son of a friend of Remus who admitted to being straight – “But I might be willing to reconsider for you,” he’d added, eyeing Harry hungrily, and Harry had made a hasty exit –, Ernie Macmillan, Lisa Turpin, a Muggle who really had no idea what was going on, almost every single twenty-three-year-old Sirius came into contact with and in one mostly successful attempt Viktor Krum – so Harry had let himself be persuaded to pretend to date Malfoy.
“No chance of that,” her sister said, looking up from her book and giving Parvati a meaningful glance.
, and Harry had thought with a pang of shame of what Remus would say if he just left Malfoy bleeding in a bathroom – bleeding
“It was a bit silly,” she went on, “but I almost felt in that moment that James and Sirius were here together again.”
When they got back to the common room, Blaise dragged Harry away to ask him seriously if he thought Ginny would like a statue of herself in chocolate. Harry busied himself doing homework with Ron and Hermione after that until it was time to go to sleep. He considered going to the Gryffindor common room or sleeping anywhere else, but he couldn’t think of a good excuse for doing so. He imagined the hurt, bewildered look on Malfoy’s face and went upstairs resigned, with a sinking heart.
“Bring out a loaf of that bread Mum likes, will you, Cam?” Dean requests, and once Camille has left, there’s nothing stopping his interrogation of Harry and Malfoy, who stand up, ready to make their escape at any moment.
Harry swallowed and reached for the door at the same time Malfoy did; their hands brushed, Malfoy’s cold and soft, and Harry jumped back.
“I invited Girl Weasley,” says Pansy after a moment. “To make you feel more at home. I also quite enjoy her company. I planned on easing you in. Girl Weasley one week, more Slytherins the next. She, however, had a Quidditch game to play.”
“Don’t listen to him, he might have a concussion,” Malfoy advised her. He had turned a little paler, and shrunk down on himself, as though just waiting for Madam Pomfrey to furiously rain down on him and demand to know what had happened.
And, well, Harry had never liked any of these people, but they were Malfoy’s friends, and Malfoy clearly liked them. “It’s alright,” he said to Pansy doubtfully. “I. Er. Get why that would be a reasonable thing to do.”
“I understand if you would not,” McGonagall said. “If you do, let me know. And I assume you will be going into the Aurors after school – ”
“And what about when you came down to breakfast in Slytherin robes, and when we told you, you said your robes must have gotten mixed up with Malfoy’s?” Hermione pointed out.
“You’re welcome,” Malfoy told him primly. “And.” He looked at Harry side-long. “For what it’s worth, I’m glad you came back.”
Pansy lives in an elaborate mansion with Padma Patil. Harry has never been able to understand whether Pansy is dating Padma, or whether they’re simply friends, or why they live together. They spend most of their time sniping at each other and bickering like Ron and Hermione would. The only thing he really knows is how they got to know each other – that year at Hogwarts he had missed.
“Yeah.” Harry almost laughed. It was ridiculous the way they were intertwined, in life and death and in ways that they could never make sense of. “But – I had a choice. I could have stayed, or I could have come back to finish the job.”
The war was over. Draco Malfoy was actually incredibly inept at being evil, as it turned out. He wore Muggle clothes and had bony feet and smelled like vanilla and had dragged Harry to the Hospital Wing, and they were living together.
Harry sank to his bed in despair and considered the tendency for dramatics in Slytherin House, and that maybe this was what the Sorting Hat had been referring to all along when he said Harry would do well there.
“And,” Malfoy went on, in hysterics, “you have some sort of problem with me being a good roommate. What exactly in your opinion should I do instead?”
“Well, I never swore not to be friends with you,” Harry admitted. “I did think of you as my archenemy in second year, if that makes you feel better.”
He didn’t think anything of it, that the feeling when he’d seen Malfoy was the same feeling he’d gotten when he’d seen Hogwarts. Not immediately. Not on the first day, when everyone was greeting each other and hugging and making fun of new haircuts. Not when Hermione came through the door with snow on her eyelashes and Ron spun her around and kissed her delightedly, or when Dean and Seamus came inside the common room holding hands and beaming. He didn’t even think about it that night, when he and Malfoy stayed up talking until their eyes were drooping and they’d passed out. He didn’t think about it the next day in class, sleeping on Malfoy’s shoulder and kicking each other’s ankles until Flitwick noticed. He did think,
Harry laughed and yawned, and lied back down. He let Malfoy rant on about how rude it was of Harry to just forget their hatred, did he have any consideration at all, et cetera, et cetera.
Harry stares at her. He feels like someone’s smacked him in the face. He thinks about Malfoy’s hand on his cheek, Malfoy saying
. First there’s Cho Chang. But she’s got a boyfriend, so you go with Parvati Patil to the Yule Ball, who, by the way, had a crush on you for all of fourth year until you took her to the ball and spent the whole time glaring over at Cho Chang, culminating in you and Weasley ditching the
make some friends who are Muggles, they liked me.” His voice was proud, and Harry’s mouth tilted up. “They’re just people.”
“I can smirk,” Harry murmurs sulkily. Then, he adds, “Hermione and Ron have known that I’m also completely head over heels for you since sixth year. Apparently I talked about you a lot, and was kind of stalking you.”
“You can laugh,” Malfoy said, voice rising and mouth twitching, “but it’s true. Before she came to Hogwarts, she read all the books about you, and talked about you constantly. That was before she met you and realised you were nothing but a disfigured disappointment with dreadful hair and vision problems, of course.”
“Er, I think you mean cinema,” Harry said, smiling and trying not to think about exactly how well Arthur Weasley would get on with Draco Malfoy.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said again, and felt gut-wrenchingly awful. He had not even thought about it – he had not even cared – he remembered the blood on the bathroom floor and Malfoy gasping and dying, that feeling in his chest like he was falling, dropping to his knees. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I didn’t mean to.”
“Shut up!” Harry says, and goes to brush his teeth. Once he’s done, he walks into the kitchen, where Malfoy is...cooking?
kiss Malfoy, at any moment. He wants to take it slow, and he wants to give everything to Malfoy. He wants to make Malfoy lose control.
“Hi Harry,” said Parvati brightly. “We thought about having a little get-together, all of us, since it’s the weekend and all.”
“We didn’t have any Muggle money, and Malfoy really wanted wedding cake,” Harry tells her, shooting Malfoy a furtive look that says
“Stop laughing,” says Harry when they’ve stopped at last. His anger at Malfoy is, reluctantly, ebbing away, and his lips are twitching instead. “Oh my god. I
didn’t tell you to wake up,” Harry said, but he followed Malfoy up to their room, and fell asleep smiling.
He was glad when the holidays came to an end and he, Ron, and Ginny Apparated into Hogsmeade and walked towards the castle, bundled up in cloaks and Warming Charms.
Malfoy laughed, almost gratefully. Seven years and Harry thought maybe he had Malfoy almost figured out now.
“While we’re on the subject of kids,” begins Ginny, “what about you two? I mean, hypothetically, kids: yes or no?”
Harry looked down, frowning. “Sirius gave it to me for my birthday this year.” It was the first time Sirius had bought Harry one of his own, instead of just throwing his and Harry’s father’s old leather jackets at him.
“Oh,” said Harry. He hadn’t known that. “I’ll do it, then.” He dug in the pocket of his robes for his wand, but he had only just pointed it at his face when Malfoy hissed and pulled his hand back down. Harry stared at their hands, intertwined. Malfoy let go quickly.
Harry made a face at him and turned his hair back to its original colour, as someone managed to find a way to turn off Celestina Warbeck and put on the Weird Sisters’ new single.
“That’s a matter of time,” Pansy informs him. “I know Draco. I’ve been watching him moon over you embarrassingly for years. If you hurt him, I’ll kill you.” She sounds perfectly serious, and Harry inches away from her in fear.
“Did you?” Hermione pauses, then adds, “Yes, you did. And you still didn’t realise that you were in love with him?”
“Yeah,” said Ron, “but I dunno what she was thinking putting Harry with Malfoy. Doesn’t seem like it’ll end well.”
Harry stayed. When Ron and Hermione came, he shrugged off their worried suggestions to come back to the Gryffindor common room, and stayed. When Pansy Parkinson came, pale and close to hysterics and clutching at a handful of Slytherins, he didn’t talk to her, and she didn’t talk to him – not even to spare him a sneer – but he stayed. When Madam Pomfrey told him to get some sleep, he took her advice and went to sleep in the hospital wing, so he could stay.
He saw the look on their faces and squeezed in to sit next to them, Harry’s best friends, and later Malfoy grudgingly conceded that maybe he would have lasted more than a minute if he’d been sorted into Slytherin.
“You’ll forgive me if I don’t take you at your word,” Malfoy said sarcastically, but he let go of Harry’s shoulder, which felt, oddly, like another loss even though it was what Harry had wanted.
He waited until Malfoy came out of the bathroom, like he was going to – what? Corner him? Ask him why he was being polite? It sounded ridiculous even in Harry’s head, and anyway, when Harry came out after changing into his robes, Malfoy was already gone.
“Now mind your own business,” says Harry sternly to his friends. “Talk about the Chudley Cannons, or Blaise’s depressing love life.”
“So does Pansy,” Malfoy replies. “She told me that she’s known me long enough to know I am completely head over heels for you, and everyone has known it since we were in school. Well. Everyone in Slytherin. Apparently I talked about you quite a lot at Hogwarts.”
He didn’t know what they were doing, what they had been doing all year, and he didn’t know whether Malfoy felt the same. But he did not want to mess it up.
“I get the picture,” says Harry, and leans over to grab a pillow from their couch to throw it at Malfoy, who catches it with five years of Seeker’s reflexes. “I’m telling Sirius and Remus that
Harry squirms, unsure where this interest in his and Malfoy’s hypothetical children has come from. “Adoption also works, but – ” He glances at Malfoy. “Narcissa really wants a Malfoy heir.”
Before Ron can retort angrily, Malfoy slides in next to Harry. “What disappointment? Are we talking about Weasley’s sad obsession with the Chudley Cannons?” He turns to Harry and says, “Hey,” softly.
The hour came by and went. Malfoy had been right about Harry liking Millie the best; she had the same opinions about Quidditch that he and Ginny did, and she was much easier to talk to than the rest. Goyle was next, to Harry’s immense surprise. He talked to Malfoy mostly. Theo didn’t say much to Harry, but he didn’t think he hated him. Though when Pansy saw that he and Malfoy had their ankles hooked around each other beneath the table she did seem to despair.
Remus’s smile turns wistful. “Your grandmother brought it back from Pakistan. James had it with him in first year. I didn’t know he’d kept it.”
Harry and Malfoy went into their room stumbling and yawning and humming Celestina Warbeck, to find Zabini spread out on Harry’s bed, asleep with his robes and shoes on. He looked like a model that had decided to take a nap mid-photoshoot.
“Did you dream about this?” Harry asks, legs entangled with Malfoy’s and neck covered in lovebites and an embarrassing smile on his face.
“If you’re done making out, want to come down and play a game of Quidditch with us?” Ginny called out.
– Potter, when I said act like you’re alive I didn’t mean act like you’ve lost the plot completely and go out in the pouring rain!”
“No it wasn’t!” Malfoy said. “I’m so sorry, Professor, I didn’t mean to, I fully accept any punishment, it’s only that I can’t turn it off – ”
“I don’t – I’ve got class,” Malfoy said, and looked at him for a long time, pale and with his hand outstretched again – before he turned around and walked back into the castle, leaving Harry standing there, impossibly alone in the sunny afternoon.
Malfoy was going home for the holidays. His mother had come back from France to be with him. Harry was going back, too, even though he and Ginny knew how awkward it would be, and even though Ginny said it would give Molly the wrong idea. He was going for Ron, because Hermione said she couldn’t risk not staying with her parents, who were still furious at her and had patches in their memories.
Greengrass and Zabini immediately rushed over to Malfoy, giving Harry incredulous looks as he backed away, and let go of Malfoy’s hand. Harry thought distantly as he went over to Ron and Hermione that Malfoy had never hung around with Daphne and Zabini much, before, but that they were all sticking together now. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had all gone back to their rooms, Terry Boot leading a puzzled-looking Anthony Goldstein upstairs. Dean and Seamus hovered by Ron and Hermione; Seamus was trying not to laugh and failing.
The first time Harry saw Draco Malfoy after the war he dropped his trunk on Ron’s foot amidst the usual rush at King’s Cross: bright-eyed children and their parents anxiously tugging them closer, hurrying towards the Hogwarts Express, the screech of owls and the faint whispers of people pointing to him and saying
“You could make it yourself, you know,” Harry replies irritably, plopping down next to Malfoy. “You’re the one who makes coffee for a living, not me.”
Harry gave up in order to let Malfoy be lulled into a false sense of security. When they went to bed that night he put his plan in action: he waited until he heard Malfoy’s breathing even out and he tip-toed out of bed towards Malfoy, and tickled his stomach.
. I had to learn all pureblood family genealogy. I can tell you the name of Terry Boot’s third aunt, and Susan Bones’s cousin, and Longbottom’s great-grandfather.”
Malfoy tugged down his sleeve and his shirt shifted down, and Harry saw the first white scar, stark against his skin, from his throat and going down in a wicked arc –
He thought about skipping the next class, but then Malfoy would know something was up. He expected Flitwick’s five points from Gryffindor because he was late on purpose, hoping Blaise or Terry or Anthony would have sat with Malfoy in his place. But when he came to the classroom, Blaise and Parvati were sitting in front of Malfoy, whose bag was clearly saving a seat for Harry.
Seamus will be upset, of course, and Hermione will disapprove, and Ron will support him because Ron is a good fucking friend, but this is the only perfect solution to Harry’s current problem, as Dean Thomas is the reason that everyone in Harry’s life thinks he is engaged to Draco Malfoy.
“Oh, Merlin,” Malfoy said, voice clearer and louder and very panicked, “Merlin and Morgana. Have you got a concussion, Potter? Let’s get you to Madam Pomfrey.”
“I wasn’t being moody. I thought you liked Hernandez. Isn’t he your type? Good-looking, smiley, sporty type.”
Harry looks down at his hand. Apparently this ring holds more sentimental value than he’d first thought. Malfoy must really love cake.
He pulls away, resting his forehead against Malfoy. Malfoy is breathing heavily. Harry can hear every intake of breath he takes.
Like Harry had summoned him, he saw Malfoy’s white-blond head walking over to the castle when he stood up and scrubbed a hand over his face, and ran to catch up with him.
“Because – because the rest of the Slytherins are in there,” said Malfoy. “We haven’t seen each other in a while, and you don’t exactly get on particularly well with any of them.”
“Lower your volume,” says Remus, sighing. “And of course we’ll sit down, Harry and Draco aren’t going to stand there the entire time they’re here.”
Malfoy pauses in the middle of laughing like a hyena to say, “You’ll be fine, Potter. None of your friends are
Malfoy was waiting outside of the eighth year common room, arguing with Daphne about something. Harry was struck suddenly with the disconnect from Malfoy at the beginning of this year, shrinking in on himself, too skinny and sallow, and the Malfoy who had now caught sight of Harry and had trailed off in his tangent to Daphne to break into a smile.
Harry laughs again. “Come closer,” he says again. Closer closer closer. Harry can’t get enough of Malfoy.
Malfoy sitting next to him in Potions class, Malfoy calling him his best friend, Malfoy saying he dreams about Harry sucking his dick and calling him
“I don’t know if it was the right thing,” Harry said. “Now. Now, I don’t – sometimes I wish I didn’t come back. I don’t think it’s fair that I got to come back when so many other people didn’t, that I got to come back when there have been loads of times I wish I hadn’t.”
me. As if I’d ever want to anyway. Who’d want to braid her hair? Not me. She thought she had the best hair in Slytherin, and she and Blaise would duke it out. As though I wasn’t even an option. I have great hair.”
“I hope for your sake it’s been made properly,” Malfoy says tartly when Harry emerges from the kitchen.
“I should probably get him home,” Harry says, apologetically. He’s not really sorry for it, truth be told. Pub nights with Ron and Hermione are fine, but the party scene isn’t quite his thing.
“Perhaps you’d like to join me for breakfast,” Zabini cut in smoothly. “We have some things to discuss.”
“I didn’t think it was true,” Harry dismisses, feeling stupidly disappointed. “We’re not really going to meet your mother, are we?”
Ginny kissed Harry when the countdown finished – “For old times’ sake,” she said, smiling against his mouth, “and also to see that look on Percy’s face.”
“I’m not,” Harry says. I’m not leaving. He says, looking at Malfoy, whose nose is pink from the cold and lips are parted, “You’re beautiful.”
Malfoy didn’t even bother to argue. He was so feeble, lying there, and Harry was the only one who thought he posed a threat.
Harry couldn’t help but feel like if he’d been better, smarter, quicker, Fred – Fred would still be here.
Inside the bathroom, where it smelled like vanilla, Harry swept cold water over his face and tried to think. McGonagall had trusted him to be able to do this. So he was going to do this. It was almost soothing, to be able to have a task to focus on again.
Malfoy took Franny from McGonagall’s arms, and hesitated. Harry nodded at him before he left, closing the door behind him.
Actually, the immediate aftermath of the war was mostly a blur. Harry recalled passing out for two days straight in Ron’s bed and then throwing a lot of things and punching a few trees occasionally. He’d gone out with the Aurors and members of the D.A. to round up the rest of the Death Eaters, to help rebuild Hogwarts, to talk to families of the dead and try not to throw up afterwards, to release some of that pent-up energy that he had no idea what to do with now. They’d stayed in the Burrow, mostly, where everyone was quiet and wretched and George had not come out of his room. They’d gone to Grimmauld Place, too, to check on Kreacher, and Harry had stayed there for a bit, but the musty and dark halls of the house Sirius had hated made him feel worse than he already had. Miserable was probably a good word for how Harry had been, or furious; he’d been stuck between burning anger and an icy nothing. And now, Hogwarts.
“No, it just applies it to your face automatically and gives you an everlasting glow for the day,” Malfoy said absently, like that was perfectly normal.
Parvati, Padma, and Susan looked bizarrely intrigued and puzzled. Zabini looked completely unsurprised and a bit resigned.
He waited for Malfoy to spit out something nasty about how he wasn’t surprised, but instead, Malfoy said, surprised like he couldn’t help it, “Me too.”
“I really wish everyone would leave me alone so I could live out the rest of my life as a hermit in peace,” said Malfoy loudly, pushing his glasses up on his nose. The Quidditch jab had probably stung. “Oh, did you want another autograph? Anything for my fans.”
.” Malfoy sounded a bit hysterical, but also like it was too early to be bothered about it. “This is your fault. Your insanity is catching.”
Harry looks up from his desk. He’s been on edge all day, waiting for Malfoy’s arrival, and his second class is still in twenty minutes. “Something the matter, Adriana? You’re a little early for class.” Some of Harry’s students like being early for class – though all they do is sit in the corner and cast giggling looks at him – but Adriana isn’t one of them.
Harry settled down to sit at a table, putting down their books and pulling out his Potions essay that he’d left to the last minute, and let Malfoy do this without any objections. He had long since discovered that Draco Malfoy was an alternate universe, pureblood version of Hermione.
Malfoy had wormed his way into Harry’s life and now there was no way to extract him from it. Harry didn’t want to, anyway. He was just going to have to ignore this, only it had never, never been easy to ignore Malfoy.
Harry gives Malfoy’s owl a piece of paper asking Hermione if she has time to meet him. A few moments later he receives an answer that says yes, she needs a break from work, and she’ll meet him in a few minutes at the flat. Then there’s nothing left to do but wait.
“Excuse you, I am a connoisseur at braiding hair,” Malfoy said with his nose in the air. “I did it all the
Harry walked through the corridors of sprawling, once loved and once hated Grimmauld Place till he’d gotten to the doors to the garden. He threw the doors open and went, as Malfoy had said, out in the pouring rain. The garden had always been the only part of Grimmauld Place that he’d liked, straggling and airy with dead grass and flowers and weeds.
Malfoy with his cheeks pink from the cold and his hair ruffled from the wind and his mouth smirking – it was a dangerous combination. Malfoy laughing at Harry, with Harry, Malfoy with his face still and determined to catch the Snitch before him – Harry had been playing with fire.
He did not cast an Impervius, but he did take off his glasses, tucking them in the pocket of the new jumper Malfoy had got him. There was a storm on the way. He stayed out while the rain kept hammering down harder, until he was drenched, hair a soaking mess and jeans sticking to his skin, and he felt alive.
He helped set the telly up. Malfoy was more of a hindrance than a help, and he had gone to ask Kreacher for snacks, and came back with enough cakes and biscuits to feed an army.
“Ronald,” drawls Pansy, sipping at her drink elegantly, “you need to give up this insane obsession with that awful team. When you inevitably pop out another Weasley, you’ll pass your obsession onto the brat, and the poor kid doesn’t deserve the disappointment.”
Harry makes his way, finally, to Malfoy’s coffee shop, and the flat above. He stares at it for a while. His home. Or – Malfoy’s home, technically, but it had been a long time since anyone had referred to it as that. It was their home now.
He was trying to reach down and set the potion on the ground when he felt Malfoy stir and yawn, sleep-soft and quiet. Harry froze, turning around.
“I’m not a floozy,” Harry says, offended. “I don’t remember a lot about that time.” Because it was after the war, he doesn’t say.
It wasn’t easy to leave them behind. Everyone wanted to talk to Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville almost as much as they wanted to talk to Harry. He felt sick. He wondered why he bothered to come back, but he knew the answer – he had no idea what else to do.
Ron reached into his pocket and handed Harry the Marauder’s Map, clapping him on the shoulder. “Use your old stalking skills from sixth year.”
, Harry thinks to himself, willing his heart rate to slow back down. Malfoy’s drunk. He won’t remember any of this in the morning.
Harry sat down beside him, running a hand through his hair, which was a horrible idea because it made the whole hair situation even worse. “Me too.”
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry called back, laughing. He looked at Malfoy and his smile faded. “Are you alright that they...know?”
Malfoy looks like he’s about to laugh himself silly and this is ridiculous, so Harry grabs his hand, tells Dean, “We’re not actually engaged,” and runs out of the shop at breakneck speed.
and Malfoy casts a Heating Charm on some leftover curry to eat. And they settle onto the couch and watch Muggle pictures until Malfoy falls asleep, his mouth falling open and his head falling against Harry’s chest.
Since Harry knew about Malfoy’s Muggle friends now, when Harry went over to visit the Weasleys or Teddy and Andromeda, Malfoy sometimes went to visit Ester and the girls. Harry would have liked to meet them, but Malfoy never asked, so he never did. It was after one of these trips that Malfoy triumphantly came home – no, to Grimmauld Place – with a Muggle telly and a VHS tape.
“I can handle it,” Hermione says, and Harry doesn’t doubt that. She hugs him, once, tightly; he can smell her shampoo, the same one Ron uses. It smells like home. “Be happy,” she whispers into his shoulder.
“Good, because I had to deal with Pansy today,” says Harry, instead of saying something embarrassing like
“I’ve seen what your interference has done, thank you very much, Blaise,” Pansy retorted. “This is a mess.”
Inside was a wide, airy common room with long windows and lanterns that McGonagall lit with a flick of her wand. The flames in the fireplace were dancing merrily, and there were a couple of armchairs around it, as well as couches and tables spread out with high bookshelves. There were two spiral staircases, one on the left and one on the right, both leading up to what must be the dormitories. There were no house colours. The lack of red and gold felt like another loss, even though it didn’t matter.
“And he doesn’t know – ” Daphne exchanged a meaningful look with Pansy that Harry could not decipher. “You know.”
“Oh,” Dean says. “Yeah. Just wanted to confirm your order for Cam? Coffee-flavoured is an interesting choice.”
“We can’t kidnap anyone either,” sulks Malfoy, “seeing as Thomas has already told everyone in the world, that’s isn’t any use, so there goes
“Malfoy, I am not going to a wizarding clothes store,” Harry said. “Everyone will try to mob me, and I don’t understand wizarding clothes that much anyway.”
Before Harry could answer him, Ginny leaped up from behind Luna with her red hair loose and falling down her back. She linked her arms around Luna’s neck and Luna reached up to hold her hands against Ginny’s absently.
“It’s not like that,” Dean said, and then exchanged a rueful glance with Harry. “I mean – well, sorry, anyway. I think I’m drunk.” He sank down on the nearest bed. Harry hoped Neville and Justin never learned of the events that occurred in this room.
Parvati’s smile got a little wider, a little more relieved, and she said, “Yeah,” giving Harry’s hand a squeeze before she let go.
When he and Dean arrived back in the common room, it seemed like Zabini had won the battle, because Celestina Warbeck was blaring loudly and Blaise was singing all the words with his wand as a microphone to serenade an amused-looking Ginny while Seamus booed loudly. Neville was making out with Lisa Turpin and Ron, horrifyingly, was dancing shirtless while Hermione tried to cajole him into putting his shirt back on. She did not seem to be trying very hard.
Harry looked for Malfoy, whose white-blond head was always distinctive in every crowd, and found him near the Patil twins, Daphne, and Anthony, with an awful lot of bottles of Firewhiskey beside him. Harry nodded at Dean, who went over to Terry and Susan, and made his way over to Ron and Hermione, even though his feet felt like they wanted to keep walking over to Malfoy.
,” Hermione admonished. “I’m sure there’s a reason McGonagall’s put us all together in different pairings.”
He was at a loose end the rest of the day. He paced back and forth in front of the common room door panicking and trying not to panic until Lisa Turpin walked over and asked him very slowly if he’d forgotten the password. Then he went to his room to panic some more. Only being in his room was horrible because it was Malfoy’s room too, and he was
Now he had seen their graves for the first time, seen the home they had picked out, seen the life they could have had.
“Well yes, there’s no denying that, but she seems fine,” said Hermione. “A little full of herself and dignified, maybe, but she and Parvati don’t seem to have any problems. And Susan Bones is with Lisa Turpin.”
She turned to Malfoy, who sat, twitching like a rabbit, ready to make his escape at any moment, and murmured a spell for the bump on his head. She handed them both a potion that tasted like gurdyroots, and Harry tried not to laugh at the expression on Malfoy’s face.
When Harry wakes up, he doesn’t immediately remember the humongous problem he discovered last night, which is being ridiculously in love with Malfoy, who he’s also pretending to date.
“I’m not trying to,” Harry said, and stopped. “I mean, it’s complicated, but I saw flashes of what Voldemort was doing, and I saw you, and. You didn’t look glad. And when you Disarmed Dumbledore – ” His voice stumbled. “You didn’t seem like you wanted to, and I saw your wand lower – ”
“I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Blaise said casually, “do you think Ginevra Weasley would ever go for me?”
still written upon it. He let his head rest against it, briefly, and felt ridiculous, but he said, “Thanks.”
Malfoy had been right. It was a good movie, even if Harry understood approximately seventy-five percent of it. He pretended not to notice when Malfoy teared up in the middle and in exchange Malfoy pretended not to notice when he teared up at the end. It was dark by the time they’d finished, time for dinner, but they stayed sitting for a while, Malfoy yawning and turning his head into Harry’s shoulder. They stayed there for a while, Harry still as a statue, barely daring to move, barely daring to breathe.
Hermione eyed the Firewhiskey disapprovingly when they came back. “You do realise this is not at all what Professor McGonagall intended.”
Hermione kept going, though her eyebrows were raised now. “But he’s really unimportant now, with everything that’s happened. We’re only trying to make sure you’re happy.”
Camille looks between them with some surprise. “Do you know each other? Oh, of course, from school, I’m being silly. Aren’t they a lovely couple, Dean?”
“Malfoy?” Harry asks, staring. Malfoy is faced the other way; all Harry can see of him is his white-blonde head, rumpled from sleep, but still lovely-looking. “Are you...making breakfast?”
Now there was this: getting drunker than Harry did after a few pints. (So, Harry’s tolerance was pretty low. Not everyone drank a lot of alcohol. Some people were busy saving the world, okay, Malfoy?)
“I’ve heard enough!” Pansy cries. “Potter, you’ve never deserved Draco’s affection and I miss the days where we would plot your humiliation, but since we’re to be a family, I expect you for tea Sunday afternoons. Draco, I require many gifts to compensate for this betrayal.”
He waited for Malfoy to sneer at him or insult the Weasleys and Hermione or ask Professor McGonagall if they could change rooms, or just change rooms without asking and shut him out completely. He didn’t. He was still incredibly annoying, of course.
Harry was startled into laughing and saying, “What?” He could easily have stayed behind when Malfoy opened the door and stepped outside. He could have asked Neville, Dean, or Seamus to cast a healing spell on him; they’d all had to learn them in the war. He could knock on Ron’s door. He could sleep it off, because he was used to sleeping with pain, and this honestly didn’t even hurt that much. He followed Malfoy instead.
Harry almost scream. He says nothing. They subside into awkward silence. What he wants most of all is to ask if the way he feels about Malfoy is written on his skin. What he wants is to ask why everyone seems to think they know how he feels, when he has no idea. On one hand, there is the memory of Malfoy’s lips against his. On the other, there is Malfoy pulling himself away from him. Malfoy running away.
Harry felt a bit uncomfortable, even though he’d been thinking practically the exact same thing yesterday. He just kept thinking of Malfoy’s pointed and bare feet, and his cloud of hair sticking up in the morning.
Malfoy’s face did something strange, and he took out a sophisticatedly wrapped present in red that was very obviously a book. “Me too.”
“Right,” Pansy said, and took a sip of her drink before she seemed to steel herself. “Potter. My sincerest apologies for offering you up to the Dark Lord in return for the lives of hundreds of other schoolchildren. I’m glad you live to scowl another day.”
Muggle Studies had been required before, I’ve spent seventeen years not knowing what the cinnamon is! It’s exactly like magic.” Malfoy’s voice had started to get more and more excited as he rambled on, like he’d forgotten who he was talking to.
When Malfoy told the knight the password and they went inside, Harry looked back curiously and said, off-hand, “Who were they, anyway? Were they real people?”
“What?” Harry said, looking up from frowning at a mysterious stain on page 97. Malfoy had opened the wardrobe and was staring at its meagre content. “Er, some of them, yeah. Those clothes are from the summer.”
and once Malfoy stopped jumping and looking at Luna like she was about to cast a Jelly-Legs hex on him, he joined in hesitantly. He listened to Luna and did not say a thing about some of the more outrageous theories, and just kept offering to refill her pumpkin juice. Harry wanted to snap at Malfoy that giving Luna juice wasn’t going to make up for having held her prisoner, but he trusted Luna. She knew what she was doing. And Malfoy was trying, so obviously hard. He didn’t see how no one else could tell.
“Let’s not get hung up on specifics,” Hermione said quickly. “I expected you to restart the whole situation, start proclaiming Draco was evil and all that. For old times’ sake!”
Hermione laughed and Harry felt warm inside. He went with them to the common room and burrowed Lisa’s owl. At the threshold to his and Malfoy’s room, he rested a hand against the door affectionately before opening his trunk and digging in to find the letter from the Aurors. He thought of Malfoy in the rain, Ron and Hermione next to him, McGonagall’s suggestion. Snape’s words,
Harry’s stomach squirmed unpleasantly, but Luna struck up a conversation about the newest issue of the
“Come to gloat about the scars you’ve given me, Potter?” Malfoy said, voice hoarse. “Did you want us to match?”
He thought maybe getting some distance from Malfoy would be better. Then he let himself admit in his head that he was going to be miserable the whole holidays, and went to help Luna hide Easter eggs in the castle to try and forget about it, went to play Exploding Snap with Ron to try and forget about it, went to watch Ginny’s Quidditch practice with Blaise to try and forget about it. He couldn’t.
“I didn’t know you were out here!” Harry protested, walking along with him and kicking at some rocks in his way, tilting his head up to feel the sun on his face. “How’s Franny, then?”
“How come I’ve just heard from Dean Thomas that you're engaged to this git?” Hermione says dangerously. Malfoy doesn’t protest to being called a git – after all of the shit he put Hermione through, he doesn’t have the right, but also because he still remembers being slapped in the face in third year – though his nose sticks up in the air like it always does when he’s offended.
“I’m going to get another drink,” he said, but Malfoy didn’t look like he’d heard over the sound of the music and everyone chatting and laughing noisily, so Harry moved closer, his mouth to Malfoy’s ear and his heart skipping a beat and said it again.
“That’s true,” Hermione said, reluctantly, as if she didn’t want to admit Malfoy had a point. “It’s an example of the prejudice that most people don’t tend to think about, but it’s important – ”
Classes went by in a routine that Harry lost himself in. He found it hard to care much about them, and he saw that Ron, and Hermione though she tried not to, felt the same way. They had used magic in a war, relied on their wands and their wits, and now they were in a classroom, and it didn’t seem to matter much. They shared most of their classes with the rest of their year. All of them were set apart in the classes they didn’t have together, chewing on quills and tapping their feet impatiently and trying to listen but mostly falling asleep. The rest of the school steered clear of them.
Harry notices Rafael Hernandez immediately; he’s kind of hard not to spot, being surrounded by a million fawning fans and all. He’s certainly very attractive, all dark, soulful eyes and muscular arms and curly hair. He’s also not really Harry’s type.
“Harry, Dean wants to talk to you,” Hermione says from across the table. Harry leaves behind his food with some regret to go find Dean, who was invited to dinner because he’s friends with Harry, Ron and Hermione and Mrs Weasley is always looking for strays to take in.
“I thought you knew my size!” Harry protested, struggling under the weight of all the clothes in his hands.
“A disaster?” Ron offered when he reached them, grinning. “Probably the tamest word for it. How was it? Did you try to murder each other in your sleep?”
going to spread virulent hatred you should be accurate at the very least. I wasn’t accurate, and all pureblood children have to take Muggle Studies at Hogwarts now, it’s required. I didn’t want to be behind either. So I bought some books, and they were very interesting. Then I thought I should see what Muggles live like, and I couldn’t use magic for the past year, so – ”
“That was because I told him I used to have a crush on you,” Dean says. “I was dating Ginny then, and he couldn’t glare at her, so he glared at you. Finding out you’re bi would have been a dream come true for me back then.” He pauses, then adds, “Not anymore, though. No offence.”
Harry moved forwards through the door and stumbled inside. He heard Malfoy say something about a room, a bed, and moved up the stairs blindly, one hand on the railing and the other holding Malfoy up. He got up the stairs to the first floor and slammed Malfoy up against the wall, let go of Malfoy’s mouth to drag his teeth over Malfoy’s throat and unbutton his soaking jeans. He felt Malfoy find his glasses and put them back on his face, laughing. Malfoy peeled his shirt off, impatient like he always was, tossed it in some corner where it would be a shrivelled-up, wet pile in the morning, and place a kiss under Harry’s ear, on his collarbone, his shoulder, on his mouth. Harry smiled and Malfoy moved away to place two fingers on the two dimples on either side of Harry’s face, and kissed him while Harry was still laughing. Harry reached to take off Malfoy’s shirt, and saw the way Malfoy hesitated. He kissed the scar he had left on Malfoy’s skin, and looked at the Dark Mark and did not flinch.
When Harry Apparates back to his flat, it’s to find Ginny sprawled along the floor, watching Muggle cartoons on their telly, and Malfoy sitting hamrod-straight next to her, eyes glued to the screen.
“That’s not what happened,” Harry said. “I – ” He didn’t know how to explain, to Zabini or to Ron and Hermione. He wanted to say that Malfoy was a soft touch as soon as he thought you liked him, that he had made Harry laugh, that he never stopped talking, that he was not afraid to touch Harry easily, affectionately.
“This is really unnecessary,” Harry said, tilting up his head so the blood wouldn’t drip on the floor.
“You can’t say things like that!” Malfoy raged, and Harry turned around to see him looking at Harry like he was a nightmare or dream come to life.
He thought about it fondly later. It was Seamus, and they were both drunk, and high besides, so it didn’t have to be embarrassing or a big deal. He could admit, in the morning, when he woke up, that he’d liked Cho Chang and Ginny, but also Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory. No one had ever told him you could like both, but Ron and Hermione had been really great about it, though Hermione had gone a little overboard with research.
So he had two solutions: dismiss his attraction to Malfoy as unimportant, and ignore Hermione’s advice.
“What a shame,” said Zabini, producing a clear bottle of liquid out of thin air. “Since if you came to talk with me, I could give you this Hangover Potion.”
“Oh,” said Harry, remembering this vaguely. He waited with trepidation for Malfoy to kick him out of the bed. “Do you have a problem with that?”
Harry assumed his competition was Voldemort. This was further proof that Malfoy was actually incredibly mad.
And he went over to sit in front of her portrait, listening to her rant about the usual inhabitants of Grimmauld Place, nodding absently, and telling her about how his mother was doing.
By the time Easter holidays came around, most of the eighth years were frantically planning out their revision for exams. Ron admitted to Harry in-between Hermione tossing revision timetables at him that he wasn’t worried about exams. They’d both gotten that letter from the Aurors, after all, like most of the D.A, but Ron seemed to be under the impression that they were both going to go directly into Auror training after school. Harry didn’t want to think about it.
“Nuwa and Ester gave me their old fellytone,” he said, all in a rush, “come help me set it up so we can watch Dirty Dancing and you can finally see its brilliance.”
“Right,” Malfoy says, determinedly not looking in Harry’s direction. “We need to review our ground rules.”
At least until now: Malfoy at the Slytherin table next to a figure Harry vaguely recognised as Blaise Zabini, and a Slytherin girl who’d been in their year who he honestly did not recognise at all. There were not many other Slytherins at the table, and they all mostly looked terrified despite McGonagall’s stern speech about inter-house unity. Most of them were just kids, Harry thought. They were just children, like Teddy Lupin. They were all just kids.
Malfoy looks taken-aback. “Oh – well, alright, then. I suppose we don’t have to review the ground rules – ”
“Happy for you, mate,” Ron says, looking faintly ill. “I mean, Malfoy used to be a evil, prejudiced git, but I s’pose he’s grown out of the prejudiced part and he’s not evil anymore. So. He’s just a git, and I can deal with that as long as you’re happy.”
saying that to Ron and Hermione; they’d gone out to celebrate Malfoy uncovering several unsavoury politicians a few weeks ago. They’d gone as friends, and he’d never thought he implied anything else.
Harry startled and turned around to see him, with his hair sticking up in his pyjamas. “What are you doing?”
“Because they were Draco’s best friends,” Pansy explains. “Did you really only learn Blaise’s name in sixth year?”
Zabini stared at him for a few moments. “Oh, Merlin. It’s worse than I thought. If I could only have told myself this before. I’m sure it would have been a bright spot in a sea of darkness, or perhaps another dark spot in a sea of darkness. Either way it would have been hilarious.”
When had he even told Ron and Hermione he was dating Malfoy? Had he ever said anything to give them that impression?
The word is quiet and soft between them; a private thing, something no one else will ever know. That home is wherever Malfoy is.
“It did, actually,” says Harry. “It was – fun. Did you know she’s under the impression that you’ve been mooning over me embarrassingly for years?”
“It’s okay,” Harry says. It’s charming, he almost says. I love that about you, he doesn’t say. Love. He doesn’t use that word when it comes to Malfoy.
“You don’t like coffee!” says Sirius, scandalised. The biggest thing Sirius and Malfoy have in common is a tendency to be a drama queen. It must run in the family.
Malfoy kissed him back almost immediately; his hands found their way to Harry’s hair, pulling harshly, tugging Harry closer. Harry didn’t think, couldn’t think. He kissed Malfoy like he had something to prove. Malfoy kissed him like a challenge. He kissed Malfoy back like he wanted to
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry said, standing up and pulling his arms over his head briefly. His shirt rode up a bit and he pulled it down, because –
Malfoy looked extremely gratified when Harry almost snorted with laughter and spit out his drink at his Slughorn impression. “This is the kind of reception I deserve,” he said, tapping his foot against Harry’s approvingly, “although I recall never getting it from you before.”
