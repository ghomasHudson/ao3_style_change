“I was afraid,” Harry admitted softly after a short pause. “I was hoping you wouldn’t, and part of me believed you wouldn’t, but I was afraid. Vernon— He used to say that nobody would want me either way, not once they’d see what a freak I am—”
His tentative plans were overruled before the next morning by the faint noise of a door opening and closing, followed by soft steps on the stairs. Draco snapped awake, more alert than he had any right to be when it was clearly still dark outside.
“Sorry, it’s just that Kreacher doesn’t really like me. Or anyone. It seems you’re an exception, probably because you’re all pure-blooded and a Black and all that.”
“He hates me, doesn’t he,” Severus stated in such a flat tone that Remus looked up at him in surprise.
“Instant Darkness Powder, imported from Peru,” Fred announced proudly. “Dead useful if you need to make a quick disappearance. Twice as effective if used together with a Decoy Detonator.”
Frowning, he stepped out of the bathroom, snatched a set of clothes from his open trunk in the corner and dressed quickly. Pacing around the room, he tried to recall the last thing he could remember, and another wave of grief hit him as his thoughts immediately went to Sirius. Struggling to breathe, he tried to force his thoughts away from his dead godfather. Afterwards, what had happened afterwards?
Remus gave a pained laugh and said, “I think she fancies me, but I have no idea how to make her understand that it’s one-sided.”
“You could say that,” he mumbled back, lifting his wand and joining her in ripping down the old wallpaper.
He spent the following hours finishing up Harry’s room, then went back to the living room to unpack the little scroll Harry had charmed to transfer messages. It was an ingenious little thing, and Severus was impressed once again by Harry’s skills. Now that he paid attention, it was beyond obvious that the boy was talented.
As his anxiety dissolved, Harry briefly considered telling Remus and Narcissa about his meeting with Dumbledore — he hadn’t given Narcissa any explanation why he had to know about his inheritances all of a sudden. In the end, he decided to obey Dumbledore’s orders and refrain. He could tell Remus about the Legilimency thing when he came to Hogwarts.
After pulling one of his new pyjamas from a drawer, Harry was just about to get changed for bed behind closed doors as usual when he hesitated, remembering the night before.
“Like hell I didn’t mind, of course I minded! But how was I supposed to think straight with you suddenly on your knees? Do you have any idea how— gah!”
the people responsible for this. Hurt them more, make them pay, make them wish they’d never been born.
“Yeah, I gathered as much,” Harry spat. There it was. The anger Severus had been expecting. “It shouldn’t matter, though.”
Granger was eyeing him suspiciously as he sat down next to Harry, while the Weasel was outright scowling. Draco ignored it.
It was a very abridged version of events, but it got the point across well enough. The reactions Draco observed ranged from disbelief or pity to openly impressed.
“Oh please, I’ve known you your entire life, Draco. Ever since you met Harry at Hogwarts five years ago, all you talked about was Potter here, Potter there.”
with Harry much sooner than anticipated. The thought alone made him squirm. While he wasn’t a shy person when it came to sex, he also wasn’t a particularly
“Well, we’ve figured out who my real father is.” Harry paused, and he suddenly looked nervous, eyes darting over to Severus.
She smiled as she let go of him. With a sigh, Harry turned back to face Draco. The sadness in his eyes made Harry’s heart clench, and he knew that he didn’t look any better himself. They both took a step towards each other at the same time, like magnets being pulled. Harry forced a smile and leaned in to give Draco a gentle kiss, but Draco had other ideas. In the blink of an eye their bodies were pressed flush together and Draco’s tongue was plundering Harry’s mouth.
Pansy had already discussed Harry’s “new” face over dinner. Extensively. Somehow managing to feign distraction, Draco had avoided the conversation completely.
Draco’s heart accelerated at that. He hadn’t thought that far. Merlin, he hadn’t thought about anything other than Harry in hours.
Draco’s hand began to move and Harry had to remind himself to breathe, to stay aware. Relying fully on his experiences from wanking, he started to move as well and Draco let out a broken moan.
“Sorry,” he murmured, then cried, “Ouch!” when Ginny smacked him on the back of his head. “What the hell, Ginny?”
All in all, he barely looked like himself. For several minutes, Harry simply stood there, examining his new face—and body. He felt…taller. Was he taller? How could he be sure— broom, yes.
Harry wasn’t sure how long he stayed on the floor crying. Eventually, he felt like every emotion had been poured out of him, drained and left out to disappear into nothing. He felt empty, numb and exhausted. And
Harry tilted his head questioningly. Snape had never explained anything during their lessons before. He’d just thrown Legilimens at him and told him to fight it off, without any actual instruction. Dumbledore must’ve forced him to put in a genuine effort. Harry felt the tiniest glimmer of hope stir in him. Maybe, just maybe, this would be merely unpleasant, rather than unpleasant
Harry followed him as he led the way through the connecting door to his quarters and to his main seating area. He settled down with a sigh.
Harry grinned and put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him into his side. Butterflies filled Draco’s stomach again as he leaned against Harry, placing his hand on Harry’s thigh. Casual. Because this was just how things were and they had nothing to hide.
, he decided, reaching for a little white bottle that smelled like vanilla and coconut, and poured a generous amount into the rising water in the tub.
For a moment, none of them reacted. Severus saw Remus’ eyes flash with anger and he knew they were both thinking about Harry’s relatives, about the fact that Albus had left him
“I will,” he promised, stirring the mixture in his cauldron. “I hope Harry won’t try to avoid me once we’re back at the castle, that would complicate things.”
Draco was lounging on his bed, waiting for Harry to reemerge from the drawing room. Whatever he and Severus had to discuss had at least the potential to put him into a right foul mood, and Draco wasn’t about to let him go through it alone. Over the past week he had learnt many things about Harry, but one above all: His boyfriend had a tendency to bottle things up unless you pulled it out of him. Draco could tell that Harry was preoccupied pretty much all the time, and yet he hadn’t ever told Draco what he was ruminating about. Instead, Draco had noticed, Harry would seek physical reassurance whenever he was upset—and Draco was all too happy to provide.
As if to reassure himself, Potter leaned in again, brushing his lips lightly against Draco’s. Without thinking, Draco pushed back, needing more than just a tease, and deepened the kiss. It was just as mind-blowing as the first time, when Potter’s lips parted to allow Draco’s tongue to explore. He crowded closer, pressing Potter further into the wall.
Harry didn’t respond and simply walked over to his room. He didn’t have the nerves to deal with petty taunts now.
After Draco was gone, Severus summoned his Patronus once more, sending it to Narcissa with the message to meet him at Spinner’s End—his childhood home. Pocketing his wand, he grabbed some Floo powder, threw it into the fire and spun away.
Severus needed a second to remember who exactly Riley Bovin was. “The Ravenclaw boy? He was fairly quiet in previous years. What changed?”
“Even just your knowledge about the allegiances of the people inside the Ministry would be invaluable, there’s no need for you to fight, regardless of what difference it would theoretically make.”
“Well, I suppose I should be thankful that you don’t see me as a murderer. I never asked for any of this, but I will see it through. Even if it includes learning dark arts and killing someone.”
Draco’s brain short-circuited again, and he couldn’t fully stifle a soft moan, as he melted into Potter’s touch. He was only half aware of how he let go of Potter’s shirt, letting his hands travel up and twist into black hair instead. It was Potter’s turn to moan now, parting his lips just enough for Draco to take advantage and dart out his tongue cautiously. Potter responded immediately, opening his lips further with another, deeper moan, meeting Draco’s tongue with his own.
He flashed Draco a mischievous smile and saw Draco’s expression morph from stunned to almost predatory. The impression was only reinforced by the way Draco prowled across the room and climbed up unto the bed, taking the book out of Harry’s hands and throwing it carelessly on the bedside table, as he came to hover above him.
By the time he was able to focus on the meeting, the Dark Lord was already in the middle of a rant. Something had gone wrong, some mission inside the Ministry failed. Severus suppressed a groan. It had only been a month since Harry had derailed the Dark Lord’s plans and his mood had been downright foul ever since.
“There’s more?” Ron asked incredulously and Harry laughed. Just a few hours ago at the beginning of the party, Ron had anxiously asked about the contents of the prophecy. Apparently Harry’s relationship reveal had shocked him so thoroughly that he’d promptly forgotten about it again.
Just as he reached his conclusion—it couldn’t have taken longer than a couple seconds—an incredibly strong hit of magic shattered his shield. He barely managed to evade the red jet of a Stupefy that followed closely behind, before quickly raising a new shield. Harry’s expression of grim determination as he raised his wand again made Severus’ blood run cold for a moment, before remembering that this was merely a duel.
He shook his head vigorously, stubbornly refusing to believe that ridiculous idea. Unless someone could present him with absolute proof that Snape was actually his father, he wouldn’t believe it.
“Do you want my mouth on you?” Harry asked, his voice low and husky. Draco could’ve melted on the spot.
“Sorry, love,” said Draco as he closed the door and sauntered over to Harry, giving him a kiss as he sat down next to him. “So, what can’t be a coincidence?”
Harry knew little about Muggle biology and genetics, but he vaguely remembered Hermione mentioning something along those lines once, when she’d ranted about the idiocy of pure-blood lineage constraints. Sometimes he wondered where she found the time to learn all those things, when their Hogwarts curriculum kept them rather sufficiently busy all year round.
“Because this is your house,” she replied with a smile. “Its servants should obey you. Not that they wouldn’t have obeyed you either way, but this way your word is stronger than that of other people—besides mine that is. But I doubt you and I will ever give them such contradictory orders that this would become an issue.”
. Harry couldn’t remember ever being so aware of someone’s magic as he was right now, watching Draco’s core pulse and shift. It felt oddly familiar to him, giving him an odd sense of comfort he couldn’t quite parse; as though he’d always known exactly what Draco’s magic felt like, he’d just never explicitly noticed.
Once more he forced himself to pay attention to Narcissa again, who went on to say, “The incantation for this second step is Par Sanguis Familia.”
“It’s a simple heritage spell, it works by matching the magical signature of two people. I’m sure Narcissa and Draco could demonstrate.”
She nodded and pulled him into a quick embrace, obviously taking him by surprise—judging by the way his eyes widened. He straightened quickly, looking over at Remus and giving him a quick nod for a goodbye.
“No, Potter, Lucius is a Death Eater. Narcissa never showed any interest in joining the Dark Lord. Now that Lucius is gone, she took the opportunity to get away. Dumbledore granted her sanctuary.”
“The prophecy. I was the one who overheard it and brought it to the Dark Lord. It’s all my fault. Without me the Dark Lord never would’ve gone after Lily—and Harry.”
He’d almost made it without encountering anyone, when the door to the smaller bathroom on the third floor opened and he found himself standing right in front of Draco Malfoy. A half-naked Draco Malfoy at that. He’d apparently taken a shower, judging by his still damp hair and the steam that rolled out of the bathroom behind him, as he stood there in nothing but his pyjama bottoms.
“You went all tense the way you usually do when you’re worrying,” Draco replied, snuggling back into Harry’s side.
He found his glasses and, relieved, he put them on. His wand lay right next to them. Harry cast a dim Lumos and looked around.
Don’t fret, that doesn’t mean Snupin will be forgotten, it’s just that at some point we gotta get some actual plot done, right?
“You said the salve is only for non-magical scars. It won’t work on these, don’t waste it,” explained Harry.
“Fine,” he grumbled, allowing Harry to pull his hand into his lap. “But in that case we have to find
Harry managed to keep himself from frowning, at least mostly. On one side he really wanted to get his hands on as many healing related books as possible, on the other accepting the offer felt almost like he was selling himself out, like he would have an obligation towards Severus if he took those books. An obligation to talk to him, let him into his room, his life.
He was just joining Ron and Hermione in the common room again, Sirona coiled firmly around his arm out of sight under his robes, when a fifth year student walked up to Harry and delivered a roll of parchment to him before scurrying off again. Harry recognised the elegant handwriting immediately and hurried to unroll it.
an actual concern,” he admitted. “I— I’m mostly afraid that they’ll turn their backs on me. For various reasons. I have a father now, so why should the Weasleys still see me as part of
His godfather gave him a surprised look and didn’t answer immediately, his expression turning thoughtful. Draco could almost see his mind work behind his black eyes.
Harry considered that. It was true, he hadn’t trusted Severus for the longest time. But after Moody turning out to be Barty Crouch, he didn’t really trust anyone he didn’t know, and with Severus he could at least be sure that he was who he said he was. At least he
“Er, yes. It’s the Room of Requirement — it can provide what is required. It produced training dummies and partitions and all sorts of other equipment whenever we needed it,” Harry explained.
“Remus?” A muffled voice called his name, pulling him out of his thoughts. For a moment, Remus frowned in confusion. Where—
“Oh my sweet boy, come here. It doesn’t make any difference to me whether you have a father who’s alive or not.”
“So, back to my original question though: What do we tell the others? Your mother? Remus and Severus?” Harry asked, slightly breathless.
Silence settled over them and Harry drank it in along with Draco’s warmth on top of him. He could already feel sleep tugging at him when Draco mumbled, “Harry?”
“I didn’t ask whether it would be possible, I asked whether you would want it,” Narcissa replied gently.
Harry furrowed his brows at her. Sure, the first couple spells had been a bit more difficult to learn, but once he’d gotten the hang of the basic…
The other unknown brother—Charlie, apparently—sauntered to the armchair next to where the Weaslette sat, followed by Mr and Mrs Weasley who sat down on the small two-seater on the lower end of the coffee table, directly opposite Draco’s seat. Granger had apparently gotten over her initial shock and stepped into the room, but paused when the Weasel didn’t follow.
He shook his head. Sometimes Hermione was too focused on the wrong things. Severus was a potions master, not some random seventh year student who helped Harry with his homework.
Guilt once more twisted his insides as he thought about the years he’d spent tormenting his own son, effectively wasting the boy’s potential.
For a moment, neither of them said a word. Then Remus smiled, took a sip of his firewhisky and pointed at Severus’ head.
Standing swiftly, Severus led them to the drawing room, which was indisputably the nicest room in the entire house, maybe with the exception of Harry’s room. Only when he turned to close the door, he noticed that Draco was still with them. He was about to ask his godson to leave, when Draco quickly stepped up to Harry, pressed a brief kiss on his lips, and, with a whispered “See you later,” disappeared up the stairs. Severus felt his jaw drop, and it was only because Harry himself seemed rather flustered—he was blushing at least—that he managed to control his expression in time before Harry turned to look at him.
“Draco?” Remus’ voice pulled him out of his comfortable bubble of outrage and Draco startled slightly.
It would be a long night. Full moon nights always were for him, but at least this time it would be long because of boredom, not because of the irrepressible urge to hunt and kill.
as well? He would’ve been branded a traitor to the Order, effectively turning the entire light side of this war against him.
The quiet hiss from behind him made Harry turn around to see Sirona slithering towards him. He held out his arm for her to coil around his wrist.
Harry flashed him a quick smile and jogged off, and Remus’ chest felt like it was about to burst with pride.
Harry gaped at her as she continued to instruct the elves about the importance of secrecy regarding Grimmauld Place and anything they might hear here. When she finally dismissed them, all three elves bowed to her, before bowing equally as deeply to Harry. After they’d disappeared, he turned to Narcissa disbelievingly.
“Oh please, Harry, do call me Molly. It’s high time we left the formalities behind,” Molly interrupted, and Severus had to smother a laugh. Of course she would offer Harry to call her Molly
The sensation in Severus’ chest was impossible to describe. It felt like his heart had both stopped and started to race at the same time, a tight knot of something
let that go. Even if the conclusion was that it had been a fluke—Merlin he hoped it wasn’t—Draco had to know. He had to be sure.
Harry stared at her for another moment, then visibly deflated, giving a defeated nod. Draco laughed softly, running a soothing hand over his back, which earned him a small smile.
He read over the letter twice, overall quite satisfied with the outcome. It hinted at big news, which was hopefully enough to somewhat prepare her for the impending shockers, while not making it sound negative. It was as good as it got, and with a little luck, she’d be distracted by his sudden interest in healing and runes and arithmancy. Perhaps that would be the biggest shock of all for her.
The kitchen smelled delicious. Narcissa stood in front of the stove, waving her wand at the table, where three sets of dishes were currently arranging themselves.
His attention snapped back to her. She had tears in her eyes and looked incredibly guilty. He shook his head, he didn’t want to hear any apologies, he just wanted her to breathe and continue breathing. She managed to sit up and he immediately pulled her into a hug, which she returned with a surprising amount of strength. She was crying.
Severus knew that his voice had turned a little high-pitched and that he was ranting, but he couldn’t help his agitation.
Draco’s words were so unexpected that Harry loosened his grip on Draco’s hands in his surprise, and Draco promptly took advantage of it, pushing him onto his back, straddling him again and grinding down once, hard. It knocked the breath right out of Harry’s lungs.
Harry smiled and wandlessly called the two tomes they’d been reading over to the couch. Wandless magic came to him easier every day, and it delighted him to no end, especially since it was a rare talent according to Remus. Shifting a little, Draco settled his head in Harry’s lap, holding his book above him, while Harry leaned on the back of the couch, holding his book one-handed and playing with Draco’s hair with the other. For the first time since he’d begun his story about that night at the Ministry, Harry felt the tension in his body ease away again.
If Severus hadn’t known that it was an act, he never would’ve guessed it. Harry’s entire demeanour conveyed utter disdain—the sneer perfect, the tone venomous. Severus wouldn’t have been surprised if Draco’s reaction wasn’t entirely faked. He winced slightly, then whirled around with fury written across his face, glaring daggers at Harry.
library right behind the Black family tapestry. He didn’t tell Remus about any of those rooms, not because he didn’t trust him, but because he felt strangely protective of the secrets he’d uncovered in this—
“I didn’t,” replied Harry. At Severus’ questioning look he explained further, “It’s an illusion. Your spells went through until they hit my shield—”
“During my time at Hogwarts, I was constantly surrounded by pure-bloods. Back then, in order to survive as a half-blood in Slytherin I had no choice but to try and get into their good graces. Thanks to my considerable talent with potions and in the dark arts, I managed to make valuable connections that kept me somewhat safe. I was young and impressionable, and over time my own opinions grew weaker as I adapted to their beliefs. That was probably why my relationship with Lily eventually broke apart, too—she saw me change long before I realised it was happening. After that, I had nothing that would have kept me from following my so-called friends into servitude to the Dark Lord, it was the only path I saw.”
Harry kissed him again and Draco relished it. He wasn’t sure how they’d gotten across the room, but suddenly he felt the back of his legs hitting the bed, and before he could regain his balance, Harry had pushed him further backwards, and he landed on his back, Harry following suit on top of him. A small spike of anxiety shot through Draco, momentarily piercing the cloud of swirling emotions and lust surrounding his mind. As natural as this felt, it was the first time Draco ever kissed a man. Technically, it was the first time Draco ever kissed anyone he was actually attracted to, given that Pansy definitely didn’t fall into that category.
Harry’s face twisted in apprehension, but he nodded and moved away to take off his shirt. Giving Draco another pained look, Harry turned.
“I’m not sure, Professor,” he replied, glad that he was able to answer truthfully with that. “I just … did it.” He didn’t mention that it was the same odd liquidy kind of control he used to shape his magic into healing forms. He would just
Nevertheless, Harry did want to see Hermione and the Weasleys. He had a lot to tell them. Once more, he wondered how they would take the news that he was Severus’ son. And the news that he was dating Draco Malfoy. He was almost more worried about that second part, since in the first he’d at least not had any say in the matter. Dating Draco, however, was something he chose.
“They won’t,” he insisted between kisses. “And if they do, they’re not worth your time in the first place. But they won’t. Merlin knows you lot are annoyingly attached to each other.”
Remus took a deep breath, then looked Severus straight in the eye. His amber eyes shone with an intensity that sent a shiver down Severus’ spine.
“No,” he admitted. “Although I’m fairly sure that Weasley—I mean, Ron—wanted to hex my head off more than once. It was to be expected I guess. I like the twins, though, and I suppose Charlie and Bill aren’t too bad either.”
“I’m glad you agree. Either way, my first priority will always be Draco’s and Harry’s well-being—if Albus Dumbledore threatens that in any way, I have no qualms to oppose him.”
He considered his options—all of them were lies, of course, but which one to choose? He went for the most obvious one, and the one most likely to get Pansy to drop it.
Harry stared at him in wonder. Sure, he remembered those discussions with Draco, when they’d tried to explain spells to each other and neither could really seem to grasp the other’s approach to learning them, but he hadn’t thought about it in that much depth. Now that he did, though, Remus’ attempt at teaching him a shield-breaker charm flashed through his memory. It was a tricky one, wand movement, incantation and intent had to be exactly right—a fact which Remus had repeatedly mentioned as he explained it. Harry had struggled with it for
“I think your insight into the political machinery of the Ministry could provide us with valuable information about key individuals,” Remus replied. “And you’re a talented witch, however wasted your potential was during the past few years.”
Dumbledore just regarded him thoughtfully. Harry felt increasingly uncomfortable the longer those twinkling blue eyes rested on him. Finally, Dumbledore looked away — and the room promptly vanished into nothingness.
“I think you shouldn’t let anyone but me see you in these,” Harry answered, before snapping his mouth shut in horror at what he just said, blushing furiously again. Draco grinned.
“I cannot hope to defeat Albus Dumbledore one-on-one,” Severus argued quietly, hoping incessantly that the Dark Lord wouldn’t actually give him an order he’d be forced to refuse—which would indeed blow his cover as a spy.
Harry flinched. He had successfully avoided to think about how he felt so far, and he grimaced at her for putting him on the spot like that. She didn’t relent.
Harry nodded, images of Severus’ bleeding body flashing through his mind. His breaths were coming more and more shallow.
Harry didn’t answer that because yes, he would have. After living with Narcissa and Severus for an entire summer, McGonagall wasn’t half as scary anymore. Hell, even Remus had turned out to be rather intimidating when he was angry, and yet Harry hadn’t had any issue with standing up to either of the three.
“Possibly the risk of anyone finding out. Albus was very adamant that as few people as possible were to know; perhaps he thought to keep it from me until the last moment, to keep the number smaller as long as possible.”
With that she left, her footsteps echoing from the staircase. Harry listened as the steps grew fainter and fainter, until he sat in silence at the kitchen table, alone.
Harry was left sitting alone with Narcissa, an awkward silence settling over them. It made him feel antsy and he began to fiddle with the lid of the teapot to keep his hands occupied.
“Well, what’s the point of the DA when we have proper Defence classes again? If we get an actual teacher, that is. In any case, don’t you think Dumbledore will want a reason?”
His expression was sour but Slughorn either didn’t notice or didn’t mind, for he merely pointed him towards a cupboard in the back of the room, telling Ron to help himself to a used copy for the time being. When he returned, Ron’s scowl had deepened.
His pale face was blushing crimson, but he seemed frozen, his gaze fixed on Remus, until he finally, after several seconds of rising tension, flung a hand before his eyes, turning his head, but not leaving the room. Remus could hear Severus’ heart beat, strong and incredibly fast—almost like his own heart. For an excruciatingly long moment, Severus appeared to be paralysed. Remus couldn’t help himself, he inhaled deeply, taking in his scent, the smell of blood thundering through his veins, of the slightest sheen of sweat on his blushing skin, of nervousness, fear and…lust?
Almost everyone drank except Pansy, Draco, and Potter. Draco looked at Potter surprised, but he just grinned back lazily.
As if she could hear the train of his thoughts, Granger looked up and met his gaze. She regarded him coolly, but not unkindly, which was generous considering he’d watched his insane aunt torture her not 6 months ago in his house. Sometimes he heard her screams in his nightmares.
“I... neither have I really,” he hiccupped. “None that I’ve been allowed to know. Will you tell me about your mum?”
She walked along the aisles with the confidence only the older students had, familiar with the quirks of the castle. Draco remembered being a first year, sticking to the more populated areas of the library, thinking he could be lost for weeks in its depths.
“Let’s not dither like pigeons ladies, Ancient Runes are calling out to be translated,” he said, brushing past them both to walk over to the table and Luna.
Draco didn’t tell Pansy and Blaise about what had happened, mainly because he had no idea what HAD happened. The train journey was peaceful once they had settled in. Pansy told anecdotes about her travels around France over the summer, knowing full well that Draco wouldn’t have much to contribute. He’d been under house arrest for most of the summer. He tried to pay attention to her and not think about Potter, or his mother, or what awaited him at the end of the train ride.
Malfoy took the box from Harry's hands, walking into the house. Harry felt like an idiot, standing on the porch. He was about to turn and leave when Malfoy called out.
"I am so glad you're taking this call," his father said. "I had to listen to him talk about Potter for the entirety of his school years."
He walked through to the back of the house where Draco had a set up with all manner of contraptions. He stared at Malfoy as he went about settling the kittens into, whatever it was he had.
Had that happened? Harry didn't even realise. Had he known and just pushed it to the back of his mind?
That Draco would always exist. No matter how many times he tried to rewrite his life. Nothing changed. He would always be
Harry had thought he could take care of them. Warm blankets and consistent feeding, but it wasn't enough. They seemed to get weaker overnight. He felt sick. He felt like a failure. These poor, defenceless babies relied on him and he had no idea what to do.
Dinner was quiet, the two of them sharing meals without a word between them. Harry would look at Malfoy as if he wanted to start a conversation, but what could he say?
He sighed, looking at his mobile phone. He'd insisted that his parents have one in case he needed to contact them, which his mother had found amusing and accepted.
He sighed. "It felt right. It felt like Harry was..." he shook his head, "like he was supposed to be here. You know? And it was like what I always wanted. Him here with me. Like... like he might actually like me... and didn't just pity me. Like he wanted to spend time with me and... What am I saying? He wouldn't have reciprocated my feelings. He doesn't like me."
"I love him. I just... seeing him last month when he brought the kittens... it was like seeing him again for the first time and I just fell in love with him all over again."
"Absolutely. His scum parents should have also gone. They got away again. Biggest fucking joke. Can't believe you don't remember."
"I thought you'd never get over him. Technically I was right. I'm sad for you. He won't ever love you. He is repulsed by you. You have this," she said, taking his arm and looking at the Dark Mark. "You're scum to him. The lowest of the low. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't care about what happened to you. He knows what you went through after the war. He doesn't care that you hoard cats and waste your inheritance on them."
What he didn't know was that they didn't actually take in neglected kittens and raise them into adult cats. Besides Crookshanks, Harry couldn't think of any other cat he knew. Did Professor McGonagall count? He doubted it. Regardless, he'd seen cats around. One of the houses near him had to own the cats that wandered around at night and stirred up the neighbours dogs. He never heard them from inside the house, only if he was outside.
together. He broke the kiss, looking into Malfoy's eyes, Malfoy looking at him through half-lidded eyes.
Harry felt an uncomfortable feeling twist in his gut. He could have gone without hearing updates, but he hadn't fully declined it. Now he was accidentally ignoring Malfoy. He replied to the message, his fingers typing fast.
He could have connected with Harry. He could have been his friend. Harry seemed willing to give him a chance.
The room wasn't overly large, but it had a large window that Harry was sure let the perfect amount of sunshine in during the day. Currently the shutters were closed, keeping the moonlight out. The three kittens were all lying together in a plush round cat bed. The mewled loudly upon seeing Malfoy, who smiled. "They just had a feed before you arrived. They're doing really well."
She sighed, going through the rooms far too dramatically for Draco's liking to clean them. "What has you so depressed?" she asked, walking back into the living room.
He shooed the cats away from the last of the food, packing it up and putting it in the fridge, still numb to how he was feeling.
Harry opened his mouth to answer, but then he realised he didn't really have one. He had wanted to see Malfoy, right? Did he even want to see the kittens? "The kittens?" he repeated dumbly.
"Good. I'm proud of you. But I doubt the reason for your slump is getting rid of two kittens. Back to Potter. What happened?"
Harry opened an attached video of one or the kittens feeding, their little ears wiggling contentedly. He felt a smile pulling on his lips as he heard Draco cooing over them as he fed them.
In saying that, if he didn't call them,  Pansy would definitely tell them he was 'having a mental breakdown' as she had so often before. Another reason he didn't want to deal with his parents. They thought he needed a stint in the St Mungo's mental health ward. He'd managed to doge it so far, but if Pansy brought up Potter's name...
"I told you not to bring food," Malfoy said, taking the bags of Chinese food from him. "Oh, watch out, Ralph will get under your feet. Oh, and there's Jill-"
"We all know she was in it for the money. She's engaged to Dean Thomas. That Gryffindor boy from our year."
He stood up, making his way to his office where he'd left his phone. He picked it up, realising the battery was low, as was usual, but he was surprised that it not only had some battery power left, but he had a message which said it was from Draco Malfoy. He pressed on the notification, the message opening.
Harry looked at the tiny kittens. He didn't know if he was supposed to say anything aloud. What could he say? Sure he loved them, but they were kittens. They wouldn't remember him, thankfully, and they wouldn't know what he said. He sighed, shaking his head. "Thank you for taking them in," he said, turning to face Malfoy.
"How did I end up with three kittens?" Harry repeated. "How did you end up with all these cats?" he asked, his tone uncomfortably accusatory.
Malfoy hummed. "Huh. Well, I just bought a baby name book and I just open the book and pick a name from that page and then cross it out. That way I don't choose the same name twice."
"Of course I remember them. You told me you were up every hour to check on them for the first two weeks."
He shrugged. "Just wondering. I mean..." He looked at the time. "I don't know, we probably won't get out of here for another hour, so that's like, eight thirty and then I'll be sleeping because we have an early start tomorrow and you will be..." he looked at Harry.
"He might," he said desperately. "There's still time. Pansy, I get it. You're a businesswoman who doesn't want a man, but I do. I know that... I totally get that he doesn't want me, I understand that. But..." he sighed, "I'm sure that... if I start with friendship-"
Harry felt like he was in the Twilight Zone. Draco Malfoy. Surrounded by mess. And cats. It was surreal. He couldn't see much of the house, having only stepped into the living room, but it was the most bizarre moment of his post-Hogwarts life.
He set his phone down, unsure if he should have replied. It would have been so easy just to ignore his message. Cut ties. But he was intrigued. He still wanted to know just how Malfoy had ended up caring for kittens and cats. He wanted to see Malfoy again.
Harry wasn't ignorant of the muggle world. He had never fully left it, living between two worlds, so he knew all about veterinarians, vet clinics and the like.
Harry felt his mouth dry. He didn't know why that invite made him feel that way. But the idea of seeing Malfoy again was... exciting.
Harry felt like he was stunned. Like Malfoy had stupefied him and forced him to watch him care for kittens. Well, that was the scenario, sans being stupefied.
"No mum. Everything's a mess and I just found out Harry isn't married and I had him over and then I kicked him out and I want to tell him I'm sorry but I just can't."
"If he comes back here you tell me. Don't talk to him anymore. You have more important things to focus on."
"Just thinking of these kittens I found." It was a half truth. There little faces had imprinted in his mind. He doubted he'd ever get those sad, terrified, yet innocent eyes out of his mind. But every time he thought about the kittens, Malfoy's face invaded his mind. It made sense though, he believed, since the two things were so closely linked now.
He adverted his gaze, knowing there was no way that she was going to get what she wanted from his mind as she wasn't even trained to do so.
"I don't like the way you said that, but, yes, basically. It feels like atonement. I refuse to let a single kitten or cat die in my care. So far I've been lucky. I have had... well over a hundred cats through this house."
"Follow me." Malfoy led him to another room, opening the door. "Sorry I had them locked in here. This is where I keep them currently."
He slumped against the wall, sliding down it until he was sitting on the ground, Jenny curling up next to him as he sobbed.
She sighed as the white cat rubbed against her, weaving flecks of glittering white fur into her black trousers. "When are you going to adopt them all out?" she asked, her tone harsh, waving her hands and scaring Polly away.
Harry stared at the text message longer than he really should have. He was so curious as to who this person was. This person who inhabited his school nemesis' body. This wasn't the Draco Malfoy he knew three years ago. This wasn't the future he had expected for him. It was uncanny. Like he'd stepped into an alternate universe.
She rested her hands on her hips. "Darling, I think you need to meet someone new. Lose your virginity. Settle down with a man as cat crazy as you. It might be your only chance."
"Harry Potter... you've seen him? Oh my..." she covered her mouth dramatically, "he is the one who put you in your slump," she said, sitting on the coffee table and staring at him. "What did he do to you?"
"He isn't attractive. There's nothing there that interests me. He looks like any other average person. I still can't believe you lied to me Pansy. I feel so betrayed."
While he was staring Lucy stole a piece of chicken off Malfoy's plate, jumping back down on the floor to eat. At this, two more cats jumped up on the table, demanding chicken and face rubs with meows and soft batting of paws.
"I think so too. We can, right?" Harry asked, anxious for Malfoy's response, yet hoping for the best.
Harry felt himself smiling. It was a dumb smile, realising that he had been an idiot as per usual. He was sure this was the fastest he had ever typed as he replied.
"I guess he has nothing else going for him since they took his wand. Wouldn't have happened if he wasn't such a piece of shit. They took his father's too. Should have taken his mother's but they didn't. Defeats the purpose really, don't you think? I mean, she has her wand, and I know that Draco and his father can both use non-verbal spells and wandless magic-"
He carried the box up the footpath. The home was small, nestled between two bigger houses. At first he thought he had the wrong home, but he saw a flash of fur in one window, another cat jumping onto the windowsill on the other side of the door.
"I think I do. I definitely do. I was going to... I was going to be, no, I would have felt responsible if Voldemort had killed you-"
He picked up the phone, calling his mother. He was surprised to hear his father's voice on the other end.
It had been weeks since he'd dropped the kittens at Malfoy's. He had thought about the kittens sporadically, but he'd been busy with work and soon enough the weeks had flown by.
No, vets didn't raise neglected kittens. Foster carers did. If he could get in contact with one that wasn't already run off their feet.
"Wait... what?" she raised a brow, looking at him, as if she was attempting to perform Legilimency  on him.
But he was grateful for Malfoy. Because of him those tiny babies would have a much better chance of survival.
Harry looked back at his car before walking through the door. He could hear mewling, chattering, something carpet-like being shredded. The living room was full of cat things. Scratching posts, toy mice, tunnels, crinkly things. Mostly cat hair. There was a lot of cat hair.
This was the scenario Draco had dreamed of since he'd met him. Harry coming home from a hard day's work, Draco showering him with affection and praise, and having dinner ready for him. Just as Harry deserved.
Malfoy's expression softened. "Of course. I mean, you do know that is it frowned upon to apparate into someone's home. But I'm glad you're here. Harry, I'm sorry. I am. I'm really-"
He sighed. "I thought... this could have been my chance... I still thought he was married. I thought we could just be friends."
A chubby ginger cat with a sagging white fluffy belly jumped up on the table, purring and rubbing against Malfoy's hand.
Draco couldn't remember the last time he'd spoken to them. Perhaps they'd called him for his birthday. "Yes," he lied.
"Darling why did you call me over? I hate coming here," said Pansy, tearing through the messy house like a cat fur covered tornado. "Can I at least cast a few cleaning charms? Your house is a disgrace."
Harry generally believed that luck was on his side. He'd been through so much in his life, and things generally worked out for him. The one thing he didn't know how to deal with was kittens. Abandoned, neglected kittens. Teeny, tiny kittens with newly opened eyes and empty bellies. Three of them to be exact, in a little cardboard box about a block from Grimmauld Place.
"I know you're busy with your cats, but do you think you could invite us over or come visit soon? We are so proud of you and love you so much, but we want to see more of you."
Harry pushed his food around on the plate. He hadn't been able to stomach anything since he'd upset Malfoy the night before. He hadn't meant to. The last thing he wanted was to upset him.
He had called all the foster carers, but they were full. A shortage of carers. Too many abandoned cats and kittens, expectant mothers and trapped strays waiting for their neutering before being re-released.
"Wait, what?" Harry said, realising just how out of the loop he was. He just assumed the Malfoy's had been let go. Innocent. Innocent enough, he supposed. They weren't exactly model citizens.
"Anyway," Ron continued as if Harry hadn't said a thing, "he parades himself as a foster carer. Don't know what he actually does. Pathetic, isn't it?"
"But he didn't. I almost killed you," he said, his hand automatically resting on Malfoy's chest, knowing that was where the scars littered his torso, feeling Malfoy's breathing quicken and his heart race. Harry looked into his eyes. "I'm also sorry."
"I just assumed you were given them by that vet nurse who wants to fuck you. He is always giving you those ugly little rejects."
Harry's didn't know how to respond to that. A million responses went through his mind. But he settled on just one.
But he didn't want to call them. Generally speaking, nothing good came of hassling his parents. They fretted over him, and wanted to make sure he was okay, and they wanted to stop by and see him. he didn't know if he could face them while feeling like this.
He sighed. Harry had no right to forgive him. He had every right to think Draco wasn't worth his time. He really wasn't. What could Draco offer Harry, that he didn't already have? Harry had everything he could need. His own home, having inherited the Black estate, a good career, and friends who were family.
This was definitely the home of a cat person. Someone who could breathe life into these precious kittens. He knocked on the door way harder than he should, but hardly registered the discomfort. The only discomfort he felt was seeing someone he hadn't expected on the other side of the door.
He was trying so fucking hard to be a better person. To not be the same person he was in school. That Draco was dead. He didn't exist. Not anymore.
Surely he'd remember something as monumental as that. Right? Lucius and Draco weren't in Azkaban. Did they really take wands outside of there?
"But I still can perform magic," he said softly. "I don't know why they insisted on taking my wand. I can use wandless magic."
“Right, sorry. Hmmmm... Sources inside Hogwarts have confirmed that Potter has been spotted with no less than 9 boys since the start of the school year in September. Unconfirmed rumours suggest that number to be higher. Potter is frequently absent from the castle at night, skips his classes, and is often drunk and disorderly. At a recent party on school property, Potter reportedly beat two seventh year boys senseless in an unprovoked attack.
Finch-Fletchley was impressed with the plaits. After a bit of begging, he sat on Draco's bed and wiggled around excitedly while Draco crafted two French plaits out of his messy curls, joining them up at the back. In return Finch-Fletchley brushed glitter over Draco’s eyelids and cheekbones. In the end Finch-Fletchley decided on bright yellow dungarees over a sheer mesh vest. Even in his platform trainers he barely came up to Draco's shoulders. He shimmied around the room, making Draco laugh. The more time Draco spent with Finch-Fletchley, the more he genuinely liked him. Historically Draco had very little patience for nice people, but Finch-Fletchley was like a tiny ball of sunshine.
He kicked off his shoes and burrowed down under his blankets to make his point. He looked up at Blaise beseechingly, silently asking him to let it go. Blaise ran a hand over his face, clearly deciding if it was worth the effort to keep arguing.
The only time Pansy broke her resolve and asked him to speak to Patil for her, he told her emphatically that he would not be put in the middle. In all honesty he probably would speak to Padma. The whole situation was getting ridiculous, and he could tell that Pansy was upset because Parvati wasn’t speaking to her either.
“We haven’t been together for well over a year, and I’m gay. She really needs to get over it already,” Potter said, crossing his arms defiantly.
Draco lost track of time, but after a while Blaise pulled him over for another shot and another glass of the blue cocktail. Draco was feeling pleasantly fuzzy. Judging by the volume of people’s voices and the goofy smiles on a few faces, he wasn’t alone. Blaise was looking around with a satisfied smirk. He’d had more to drink than Draco but he had an amazingly high tolerance for alcohol. Drinking was practically a sport in Slytherin.
“I thought we talked about this Terry?” said Potter calmly, looking at the other boy with cool anger behind his eyes, but Pansy suddenly shot to her feet, cutting him off before he could say anything else.
On Friday evening the snow was falling steadily, swirling in the darkness as they tramped into Hogsmeade. Draco ducked into the Three Broomsticks, dragging Pansy behind him, shaking snow from his cloak and out of his hair. Pansy shrieked as she was sprayed with freezing droplets, and Blaise laughed, following them into the pub. Justin bounded in last, almost completely concealed in a huge fuzzy coat and a knitted hat.
“Thanks for telling me. We’re really good at listening to rants about unrequited love, so here for you any time.”
And he was off, chatting animatedly about this band of five girls. Draco could barely keep up with him, as he started to unpack his clothes and hang them in the wardrobe with a few waves of his wand. He then set about charming the wrinkles out of his shirts and trousers. Finch-Fletchley had moved to his own trunk and was hurling balls of socks across the room towards his draws by hand, still talking a mile a minute. Draco tried to make sense of the words he couldn’t understand like “MTV" and “music video", but he was mostly grateful for Finch-Fletchley’s good natured manners. Maybe McGonagall did know what she was doing after all. At some point the record came to an end, and Finch-Fletchley went to flip it over to play the B side.
Finch-Fletchley had a small freak out when he found Draco’s collection of Versace silk shirts. He picked out the purple and gold medusa print for Draco to wear tucked into white jeans. Draco sat on his bed and carefully undid all the little plaits, combing out his hair gently with his fingers. It fell to his shoulders in little ripples, and he loved it.
“How did you come to that conclusion? Just stop acting like a slutty alcoholic with a death wish,” he gasped incredulously.
Blaise stole the cup of coffee from him and cradled it, looking mournful. Draco sighed and reached for another cup.
Potter threw his arm out to gesture at the room as a whole and said gleefully, “Haven’t you noticed there’s a party going on?”
He looked down at where her slender brown hand was clinging to his pale forearm. Right over his mark. His stomach twisted, and he pulled his arm free. He didn’t want her to touch it, like it might taint her somehow. He shouldn’t have forgotten it was there, even for a moment.
“Harry, come on, it’s just Malfoy—” Longbottom was tugging on Harry’s sleeve, trying to pull him back, but Harry took another step forward instead, drawing his own wand as well.
him with his aggravating behaviour. He didn’t like it. Especially, because while he might be interested in Draco, Draco most certainly was not interested in him, not in that way. As far as he knew, Draco was dating Pansy Parkinson and very much not interested in men. He’d tried to ignore the little voice in his head whispering that nobody really knew about Harry’s interest in men either, that it was very well possible that Draco just hadn’t had a reason to make it public, just like himself.
, begging the question why he’d been with the madman in the first place. They had to figure this out themselves. If only he knew what curse had caused the big slashes, he might find a way to break it
a Slytherin. Ron’s house-prejudices were rather intense, now that Harry thought about it, bordering on problematic.
“Severus, Severus.” The words were cold, laced with mock pity. “A mudblood? You defiled yourself with such filth and never deigned to tell me? Tsk, tsk, you disappoint me.”
“I do, sir. For my own schedule, Wednesday afternoon would be ideal, but I suspect that other years have classes during that time, correct?”
Severus smiled. Harry would like that, he was certain of it. Turning back to what used to be his unused side-room, he began to conjure furniture, feeling the pull of Hogwarts’ magic as it supplied him with suitable pieces to be transformed. It saved a remarkable amount of strength, and Severus wondered whether the castle always supported this kind of thing, or whether it depended on more complicated factors.
He glared at her. “Did I, really? You know as well as I do that this job was nothing more than a facade when I became a spy. I didn’t really have a choice.”
Harry was out of his chair in less than a heartbeat and already practically flying down the stairs when he heard Narcissa scream. The sight before him could’ve come straight out of a nightmare. Severus was sprawled on the floor, covered in blood, his robes ripped to shreds revealing countless deep cuts all over his arms, thighs, sides and chest. Harry’s heart turned to ice.
“I— sorry,” Potter stammered, before disappearing in his room so quickly Draco would’ve thought he’d apparated if he hadn’t known better.
Draco had always been a light sleeper, but the past year of increasing pressure and anxiety due to his father’s demands and the prospect of the Mark had exacerbated this predisposition to the degree where he’d wake up from the slightest noise. It was a right pain, usually. But not tonight. Tonight, it was a blessing.
Remus smiled widely and Severus found himself staring. Had he always smiled like that? How had he never noticed?
, but it definitely wasn’t,” Draco explained, looking somewhat irritated. “It was wandless magic, bound with runes he drew onto your chest, and quite a powerful spell—”
Curse Pansy and how well she knew him. Draco had assumed that it’d be best to avoid talking about Harry at all, lest he give himself away accidentally—but she had a point that he’d alway been rather…focused on him. Perhaps Pansy’s reaction was to be expected, perhaps it’d be less suspicious if he
“How did it go? Please tell me nothing went up in flames, it’s not impossible with Finnegan involved.”
When Narcissa announced that lunch would be ready in just about an hour, Severus decided to go take a shower and put on some proper clothes. He couldn’t simply stay in his pyjamas all day, no matter how tired he still felt.
, not the main thing. He turned to Harry, counting on his boyfriend to support him, but instead Harry’s expression was grim and thoughtful.
“I have. He seemed most displeased that you told me about it.” Severus scoffed and refilled his glass as she went on, “Apparently he was of the opinion that it would be better to tell me as late as possible, to minimise risks — his words, not mine.”
“You know that this doesn’t change that I’m still here for you, too, right? I am still your godfather,” Severus pointed out, his tone cautious.
But it wasn’t just looks. Where Potter had previously been a carbon copy of his father—no, of James Potter—down to the smallest gestures, his entire demeanour had suddenly changed. He still fidgeted, but he did it in a far less disruptive manner now, and he clearly tried to control it. His facial expressions, which had been a mirror image of James’ until now, were much subtler than before; though he still couldn’t hide his emotions completely. The unguarded arrogance Severus associated with Potter’s face was all but gone. In its place, Severus had observed a cautious sort of confidence when Potter had dealt with Narcissa, and a surprisingly intelligent, controlled attitude during their Occlumency lesson.
“It’s alright, cub,” a voice said from the door, and Harry whirled around to see Remus and Severus standing in the hallway, listening. How long had they been there? Seeing Remus’ encouraging face—he settled down on the small couch they’d moved to the wall for now, Draco taking a seat next to him—Harry took a deep breath and continued.
—so his mind provided him with seemingly pure randomness instead. Every noise alerted him, every movement in the air made him twitch in anticipation of
“I— I’m sorry,” she managed between gulping breaths. Harry frowned, taking her hand between both of his again.
He gently patted Sirona’s head as he passed her, making sure the warming charm on her basket was still strong enough, and left his quarters. It was already dark outside, and the train had probably arrived at Hogsmeade station by now. It wouldn’t take long for Harry to reach the gates from there.
Harry continued, “That’s probably when we’ll have to split into different groups according to skill-level. Younger, less experienced students will probably continue working on defensive spells and tactics; I won’t deny anyone who wants to try their hand at higher level spells, but I also won’t spend entire sessions on them trying to do magic their body and core simply aren’t ready for.”
spacious. While Draco’s own room could hold a bed, closet, desk, small bookcase and an armchair, Potter’s room had a full seating area with a fireplace, an entire wall covered in books, a much larger desk directly under one of the two huge windows that flanked the luxurious looking four-poster bed, a chest of drawers and two doors, probably leading into an on-suite bathroom and a walk-in closet, like Draco’s old room at the Manor used to have.
Severus watched their argument with mild amusement. It sounded like this wasn’t the first time they were having this fight. Harry was meanwhile exchanging soft hisses with the snake, holding it up in front of his face. It was strange to see Parseltongue used so casually, and Severus noticed that Draco was watching Harry with open fascination and barely concealed lust.
. It felt like—” He hesitated, swallowed heavily, looked up at Draco with anxious eyes. “It felt like before I changed. He looked at me like he used to when he hated me. He sounded like he’s gone right back to hating me.”
And then the world tilted and he lost his orientation for a moment. Harry was still kissing him, but it was Draco who was flat on his back now. If he hadn’t been so utterly absorbed in the feeling of Harry’s hands roaming down his body, he might have wondered how Harry had flipped them so fast. He didn’t.
“There are a number of things I’d like to say and address, and I hope that you will hear me out until the end before you pass judgement.”
“She’s right, babe,” Harry said, trying for a smirk. It felt more like a grimace, but he went on undeterred, “If you don’t eat you’ll be hungry hours before the Trolley Lady makes her rounds, and you get awfully bad moods when you’re hungry.”
He kept his arms tight around Harry when he pulled back, watching Harry’s eyes flutter open slowly. The green of his irises had darkened and his pupils were blown wide. His dazed expression made Draco want to snog him all over again.
“I thought you might appreciate having a room here, even though you can not use it at the moment. Just know that it is yours, and should the need ever arise you can come here whenever you want. Draco already had access to my quarters, so you’ll both be able to come and go—but I’m sure I don’t have to remind you that you can not overdo it or people will raise suspicions in no time. If you come here, nobody can see you. If necessary, go through my office—there’s a connecting door here.” Severus opened the door in question, and Harry nodded, looking strangely dazed. “Are you alright?”
Alright darlings, remember that fluff chapter you got where they go shopping? This is the panic attack that was originally in that second half there. Somehow it felt like it fit better here, gives them some room to breathe before shit goes down again.
“Which brings us back to the reason why I sent them away in the first place.” Narcissa looked over at Severus. “What happened yesterday?”
Harry took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. He busied himself with emptying a full cup of tea to forestall answering a few moments longer.
“What?” Harry asked, dumbfounded. “But just a minute ago you made it sound like it should be possible for me to learn it within a year!”
Draco froze as soon as the thought registered in his conscious mind. He saw Harry’s brows twitch inwards and immediately shoved it away.
Back at Grimmauld Place Draco claimed the bathroom first, quickly showering and fixing his hair, before letting Harry have his turn as he went to pick an outfit. In no time, he was dressed and ready, lounging in an armchair and waiting for Harry. When he finally emerged, Draco’s breath caught. He was wearing a dark green silk shirt and black trousers, both tailored to perfection, the deep yet vibrant colour a flawless match to his eyes and contrasting beautifully with his skin. It
Harry scoffed. “Right, because being related by blood means so much. You just said yourself he treated you better than your own father. Blood means nothing, at least not in my experience.”
Draco watched as the clock crawled towards midnight with excruciating slowness. He had finished brewing before dinner and spent the last few hours curled up on the sofa in Harry’s bedroom reading a mystery novel he’d found in a corner shelf in one of the unused bedrooms. As much as he enjoyed reading about transfiguration, potions, or charms, sometimes he just felt like something non-academic.
“So?” asked Harry, who had settled into his chair again, as soon as Severus was served. “What is it you need to tell us?”
Harry’s insides churned. Surely Healers were sworn to help any patient, right? But even if they were, Narcissa was right. Not even Dumbledore could save Severus from Azkaban if they brought him to the hospital with wounds that were clearly inflicted by dark magic practically screaming
Severus’ nerves calmed a little, and they headed up into the drawing room together, where Severus poured them two glasses of firewhisky before they settled down in one of the smaller seating areas with only three armchairs around a small table.
“This will be a very busy year at Hogwarts. Not only do we have the largest class of first years in quite some time, but you will have noticed that we have some returning older students who will be making up our eighth year. All of you have a lot of hard work ahead of you to catch up on the education you will have missed because of the disruptions last year, but I have every confidence in each one of you.
He slid his arms around her, the familiarity of her affection and the scent of her shampoo grounding him.
There was a much larger crop of children starting Hogwarts this year. It seemed a few wizarding families had chosen not to send their children to school last year, and no muggleborns had received a letter for obvious reasons. McGonagall had decided to start them all together, and the Sorting Ceremony was taking forever. Draco was starving, but he still clapped politely as each terrified new Slytherin joined the table.
Draco still felt apprehensive about the whole situation but Blaise’s blue stuff was deadly, and soon enough he found himself standing with Pansy, Brown, and Patil making bitchy comments about people’s outfit choices. Pansy had warmed slightly to the other girls after finding out that Parvati's thirst for gossip was almost as strong as her own.
Draco supposed he shouldn’t really be surprised about how excited everyone was to have a few drinks in the common room and call it a party. Not after the last year they’d all had.
Blaise looked at him coolly, looked around the table at everyone’s half full glasses, and back at Draco. He met Blaise’s scowl in flinty silence.
Draco didn’t know if he was dreading the idea of another party, or just dreading all the extra people that would be in the common room. Whoever had thought about inviting the seventh years shouldn’t be allowed to have any more ideas. The only silver lining was that he would get to spend the evening with Luna.
They all worked quietly for a while, Luna occasionally leaning over to ask Draco a question about his Charms notes. She wasn’t great at taking notes it seemed. She barely had any as far as Draco could see, and when he asked her why she said she preferred to experience the lessons without any distraction. He thought that was pretty naive of her, but then he realised that the questions she was asking him were specifically about his opinions. Her memory recall, and grasp of the topic, was actually astounding.
Patil blinked and looked at him. Then her clouded expression cleared and panic flashed across her face.
“I know that you’ve lectured him, and you’ve nagged him. You and I both know that’s not going to work. You need to have a conversation. Listen to him! He doesn’t need more criticism, he needs a friend. He thinks he’s so alone right now Hermione,” Luna said, her voice achingly sad.
MacMillan and Finch-Fletchley laughed, and Draco heard another muffled laugh. He looked around and saw Granger a few seats away with her hand over her mouth, blushing furiously. No one else seemed to have noticed.
“No! Of course not. Only the core-members of the Order. Dumbledore called an emergency meeting two days ago.”
At least the memory of being sent down to his mother and right back up to Remus again fuelled enough affront to distract him a little, so he happily latched on to it while Remus was still talking, clearly uncomfortable himself. How dare he send Draco downstairs like a— like a
“Maybe I just want to ogle him in his new look,” he said nonchalantly and emptied his drink with one big swallow.
wrote a little ficlet prompted by that paragraph of Severus telling stories about child Draco! You should go check it out
“Draco,” he choked out, and he knew that he sounded desperate. He didn’t particularly care, though, not when Draco looked at him as if was about to devour him whole. Then a smirk spread on Draco’s lips, just as one finger dipped ever so slightly below the waistband.
Harry Potter’s head was throbbing. He sat up with a groan and rubbed his temples, keeping his eyes squeezed shut. He reached blindly for his glasses but only grasped at air. Confused, he opened his eyes to a dark room. He wasn’t in his dorm.
She snapped her mouth shut, her cheeks deep red now. Harry sighed and refreshed the double layers of privacy spells around them.
Minerva gave him a patient look. “Severus, I know you’ve never liked the boy, but are you sure that this isn’t just your biases coming off because he no longer resembles James? Potter has always been generous, I would have been surprised if he’d turned Narcissa away. And while I can not speak for his skills in Occlumency, he’s never been untalented or unintelligent in general. He may have been impulsive, but never cruel—he wouldn’t have attacked Narcissa unless she attacked him.”
Four shocked faces stared at Harry, but he didn’t seem to notice, his eyes fixed on Albus, who only shook his head. Severus knew that Harry had been unhappy with how Albus had treated him during the past year—Remus had told him as much—but he hadn’t thought that his resentment went that deep. He felt a glimmer of pride. If anyone could stand up to the old meddler, it would be Harry—if only because Harry had unique leverage as the Chosen One.
Severus drew a sharp breath and his eyes fluttered open. Relief crashed into Harry as black eyes found his. His vision went slightly blurry as he blinked back tears, still gripping Severus’ hand tightly.
His rumination was interrupted by a chime from the Floo, followed by Narcissa Malfoy stepping out of the fireplace. Her posture was full of pride and elegance, as if she’d entered a gala rather than a dusty living room.
“Did you by any chance speak about anything else?” he prodded, biting back a grin when Severus rolled his eyes at him.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “So we’ve decided that it’d be best to keep up appearances, pretend we still hate each other in public, meet in secret.”
“Yes, I defended myself. That doesn’t change the fact that I saw that my touch caused him pain and immediately moved to melt his face under my hands. I killed Quirrell. I killed the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, and I sort of killed the diary version of Tom Riddle. I would’ve killed Peter Pettigrew if Sirius’ freedom hadn’t depended on handing him over — in hindsight a rather grave mistake, isn’t it? In the Department of Mysteries I shot spells at Death Eaters that could have crushed their lungs and killed them. I crucio’d Bellatrix and if I got the chance I’d eradicate her in a heartbeat. If you are somehow under the impression that I am really Dumbledore’s Golden Boy then you have either not been paying attention for the last five years or are actively ignoring the obvious.” He shook his head, running a hand over his face. “Merlin, do you even know me at all? I thought you two at least would see past this stupid Chosen One charade.”
“I was looking for you for ever such a long time!... but then I got side tracked! Where have you been hiding?” She shouted, waving her arms around and nearly falling backwards.
Draco was distracted, staring at the silver stars dangling from Potter’s ears, but he snorted when they all looked at him. Blaise had told him that he would be expected to pay for drinks, if he expected Blaise to hang out with his “intellectual friends". Blaise was incredibly smart, but he had no interest in making an effort, choosing instead to coast along relying on his natural talents. He said he found bookish people exhausting.
Harry didn’t try to speak to Severus again. The man stayed in his room, except for Occlumency lessons every other day, during which they barely talked. Harry’s shields were excellent by now, and coupled with the newly increased motivation of not letting Severus see how he felt, they sufficed to keep him out practically every time.
Theo blanched and Draco felt empathy for his friend rise in him. It was an open secret that Theo’s father, Erasmus Nott, was a Death Eater; as were Crabbe and Goyle Senior. As was Draco’s father.
Four hours later, Draco walked back into his and Harry’s room grinning broadly. It had taken three attempts to get the modifications right, but he was fairly confident the mixture he’d brewed for Severus would work the way he intended. His satisfaction with himself, however, was quickly overshadowed by the look of pure joy lighting up Harry’s face as soon as he saw Draco enter.
Severus wasn’t at breakfast. It would have worried Harry if he hadn’t been thoroughly distracted by the arrival of their O.W.L. results. Draco blanched at the sight and Harry felt oddly reminded of Hermione by how serious they both seemed to take their grades. Nevertheless, he had to admit that he himself was nervous, too, as he turned the letter in his fingers for the third time without opening it.
“Severus, Severus,” the Dark Lord said, almost mockingly, shaking his head. “Whatever is wrong with you today? You’re usually so…attentive. What is distracting you? Legilimens!”
“Fine,” he conceded. “I’ll talk to him, soon. First we have to survive tomorrow, without casualties if possible.”
“I’m sure we’ll find a place for you to brew. Maybe we can clear out one of the unused bedrooms on the second floor and turn it into a lab for you. I’ll ask Harry about it.”
Another shiver of apprehension went through him. He shook himself to snap out of it. There was no other choice. Not that he hadn’t tried to get out of it. As soon as he’d realised that this would have to happen soon, he’d practically panicked—and promptly turned to Narcissa for help. She was a mother, she’d know how to approach the subject best in a parental way. Remus cringed as he remembered the conversation.
“It’s not so bad,” Ginny dismissed his apology cheerfully. “He’s a wonderful target for pranks, last time I doused his jacket with an odor that attracts the garden-gnomes, it was rather hilarious to watch.”
“We both trust him,” Remus went on, “but after today’s revelations, I am not sure I trust him completely anymore, at least not around Harry. I know that due to your position as a spy you won’t be able to publicly treat Harry like your son, but I ask you to keep an eye on him at Hogwarts. He’s involved enough in everything as it is, I don’t want Albus to drag him in any deeper than necessary.”
Neither of them answered, both frozen in matching expressions of shocked horror. The silence between them stretched far beyond comfort, and Harry felt agitation rise in him. His legs began to bounce rapidly, and none of his efforts to keep them still succeeded.
The expression was uncomfortably familiar and so convincing it felt like being doused with ice water.
The door opened and Draco twisted his head around so fast that his neck popped. Harry slid inside, breathing deeply and giving Draco a smile that made him feel slightly weak.
“I was unhappy about Kreacher because he’s unpleasant to be around,” Harry answered evenly. “And before you get all wound-up about it: No, Narcissa is not mistreating them. Yes, they like working for her. No, they do not want to be freed.”
A smile spread on Remus’ face, and that hungry glint flickered in his eyes again. Then he seemed to rein himself in again as he said, “I don’t think Harry should know about it, in that case. He might not understand this type of arrangement, and I’m not sure what he’d think if his guardian and his father suddenly started to— Well, you know.”
He paired up with Blaise and graciously offered his friend to be the one to do the jinxing first, knowing that it’d be much easier for him to block Blaise than the other way around. After ten minutes of whispered jinxes bouncing off Draco’s shield, Blaise gave him an exasperated look and shook his head.
The room was huge. To his right, Harry could make out two armchairs made of nearly black green velvet and a couch table between them, standing in front of a large fireplace next to a wooden bookcase that spanned over the entire right wall. At the wall opposite the fireplace, a desk stood under a large window, which was covered with heavy, dark grey curtains.
. We haven’t had those lessons downstairs in weeks, another thing he reversed back to how it was before.”
Weasley grunted, then after a pause conceded, “Fine, I’ll give him a chance. That doesn’t mean I trust him, though.”
“I’m not supposed to tell you,” said Harry. “I’m not supposed to tell anyone at all, actually, though Dumbledore considered making an exception for Ron and Hermione.”
“Why don’t you take mine?” He pushed his brand new book towards Ron, grabbing the battered old copy from the cupboard in turn.
“A permanent warming charm on an easily accessible surface, yes, I know, Harry,” Severus finished for him with an exasperated sigh, rolling his eyes. “Sirona will be perfectly fine until you can pick her up again.”
Harry’s insides went cold, and he suddenly felt very exposed. He’d confided in Narcissa, he’d trusted her to keep his secrets, and now she’d just gone and told Severus, the one person he didn’t want to know.
“Yeah, actually, that describes it quite well.” He thought for a second. “Imagine it like different plays in Quidditch. You would never dismiss those by saying ‘why would we need tactics if I can just throw the Quaffle’, would you?”
And then the Dark Lord had returned and his father’s expectations had turned from passive ones to active demands.
son. Ridiculous. And yet there was still the little voice in the back of his head, insisting much like Minerva that it was a possibility, that it wouldn’t even be too surprising.
“I recognise two of the covers, I remember studying those books myself, once,” Severus replied, the slightest smile tugging on his lips.
“They had all summer to overcome that,” countered Severus with a shrug. “However, I must ask you to keep this secret, for now at least.”
“No,” Severus acknowledged with a sigh, “she isn’t. She’s infuriating in different ways, although I suppose I am treating her unfairly.” He hesitated. “She reminds me of Lily sometimes. It doesn’t help. Lily was just as talented and studious, if far less obnoxious about it than Granger. And admittedly, my dislike for Harry has biased my view of his close friends too. So you see, it’s a product of many factors, upholding my cover plays an important role, as do my personal feelings for our former classmates.”
Harry thought, remembering what he’d read just two days ago about spells designed to increase the chance of lethal blood-loss. At least it seemed that only the ones in the centre of Severus’ chest were of that nature, while the cuts on his arms, legs and sides were bleeding noticeably less strongly.
that Slughorn treated like that. He glanced over at Blaise Zabini who had also been invited to the Slug Club, but the Slytherin’s face was completely blank.
Thank Merlin Harry developed a fascination for healing, right? It’s quite difficult to write the feeling I imagine when doing this sort of magic, but I hope it’s somewhat tangible.
Draco couldn’t even flinch before Harry already hissed, “Protego!” erecting a shield between the two groups and two spells ricocheted off it straight into the walls. The twins and Weaslette had their wands out as well now, though only the Weaslette had actually raised hers, aiming at Draco and his mother.
“As I began to work through the pattern from there, Harry lost consciousness and I brought him here. By the time we arrived and Poppy had administered her care, I noticed that Harry appeared…changed—an observation all of you shared. Nevertheless, I continued my task, until I was sure that none of the spells remained.”
Draco gaped at him, speechless. Harry just shrugged and went on. He told Draco about the beatings. Not from Dudley, from Vernon. It started with an occasional slap across the face, when he’d done something Vernon considered abnormal, or when he couldn’t keep up with his chores, but it hadn’t taken long until a slap turned into fists and fists turned into a belt on a bare back.
he wondered to himself. Why had she thought it necessary to make everyone believe that James Potter was Harry Potter’s father? Was she simply ashamed of her infidelity? Had it been to prevent James from finding out? Was there another, deeper reason behind this charade?
Remus sat down with a relieved sigh and accepted the glass of firewhisky Severus was holding out to him.
“Then how,” Narcissa went on, “can we trust him to make wise choices when it comes to the war? Do not misunderstand me, I will speak to him and respect him as the leader of the Order but I can not see myself putting all-encompassing trust in him like so many others seem to do.”
Remus huffed and rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t help the smile that tugged on his lips. Harry pulled him to his feet.
. He had seen everything and he hadn’t left. And really, if Harry was completely honest with himself, the secret of those scars had been the main reason—the
rituals and spells that change the caster, but in such cases that is usually the explicit purpose of it. It’s not a hidden, gradual degeneration of your mind and morals, it’s a conscious decision. I can promise you I’ll never touch anything even remotely like that.”
to bridge the gap between them, that much was clear. Still, Harry couldn’t get his long-honed paranoia to stay completely quiet. Offering gifts as a method of manipulation wasn’t a particularly novel trick, even though Severus had explicitly claimed that Harry owed him nothing for it the thought was planted in Harry’s mind now. The knowledge that Severus had done something for him, so he ought to do something in return. It was infuriating, because he
“Oh, certainly, certainly,” the portrait said, reaching for the frame from the inside. With a sudden
“I never got the chance, I would’ve done it after the feast or first thing tomorrow. Dad must’ve mentioned it to him.”
As he bounded down the stairs, he once more revelled in the fact that he didn’t have to be careful to be quiet anymore now that Walburga’s portrait was gone. Narcissa had done him a real favour there.
For the next two hours they selected outfit after outfit for Harry, had him try it on and then judged whether it was worthy to be purchased or not. It was honestly the most fun Draco had had in years, while Harry, though he seemed to be enjoying himself, looked a little overwhelmed. After they had amassed an incredible collection of clothing for Harry, Draco finally declared their haul complete and released Harry, taking the changing room for himself instead to try on the dress robes he’d chosen. They were midnight blue, with silver ornaments that matched his eyes running along the seams. When he stepped out of the fitting room, he heard Harry inhale sharply and had to suppress a grin. At least he wasn’t the only one admiring his boyfriend.
“Yep. But Remus is helping me with my duelling skills and he’s teaching me to apparate. Severus isn’t bad at defence either, so maybe he’ll be able to show me a thing or two as well, and Draco is a good opponent to practice with. Even Dumbledore said he wants to teach me once the new school year starts.” He grinned. “You know, this time I’ll be properly prepared at least, unlike the last four times I faced Voldemort.”
“You’re expected to be friends with more popular people than us,” Luna deadpanned, eyes still on the Quibbler.
He hesitated, not knowing how to put it so it wouldn’t sound too shocking. After a few seconds of struggling, he shot a helpless look at Ginny, who gave him a smirk in return.
. Naked. Remus could feel himself flush bright red. Gods, what was wrong with him? He’d never been the type to be shy, especially not around a full moon. And it wasn’t like Severus would give a second thought to what he’d seen, the man was straight.
He pushed the book into Draco’s hands, directing him to stand so he could see it while drawing the runes. His hands were shaking, there was no room for errors here. Harry took a deep breath to calm his racing heart, then put one hand on Severus’ chest, while beginning to draw runes with the other. His magic responded immediately, parts of it flowing along the lines he traced, leaving glowing symbols behind as he focused on replicating the pattern of the form in his mind. Warmth spread through his body, pooling in his palms as he finished the last rune. He felt himself thrumming with magic, his whole body filled to the brim with it. In any other situation, it would’ve been exhilarating. Taking another deep breath, he willed his magic into taking the form he wanted. For some reason he felt no more than a mild sense of surprise when it complied fluently, as if it wasn’t any harder than breathing or blinking.
Albus seemed unperturbed. “Yes, I’m afraid it looks like Lily was indeed unfaithful. As to who the father is, I can only speculate. By all means, if you have a guess do speak out. It should be no trouble at all to confirm or deny whether a specific person is or isn’t Harry’s father. All it takes is to look at their magical signatures.”
Harry cast a wary glance around. The alley was practically empty, but somehow that didn’t make him feel any more comfortable to discuss information he got from Severus. If anyone overheard them…
“And you’re certain that they’re not manipulating you?” asked Mrs Weasley, her tone so full of worry Draco wondered whether she was exaggerating on purpose. “Remus, what do you have to say about this? Surely you don’t think it safe to allow supporters of You-Know-Who to—”
Severus thought his idea over, muttering under his breath, “Yes, that’ll work. Grimmauld can hold four people, easily. And Narcissa would feel at home. I only have to convince the Order to let them stay—”
“Well,” said Remus, grinning broadly as he set his glass down, “I’m already exhausted, but you should be fresh as a daisy.”
There was more, Remus could feel it, but Severus wouldn’t volunteer any further details by himself as he knew him.
“Yes, progress.” She smiled sweetly, but her eyes had a dangerous glint in them. “Muggle authorities are now investigating them on the grounds of having found alarming evidence for maltreatment of a minor.”
Draco’s eyes flew open at the unexpected touch even as it sent a shiver through his body. The heat in his stomach flared. His hands were still moving of their own accord, still stuck on the task of pulling Harry towards him even though Draco’s mind was thoroughly distracted by the lack of fabric under his fingers as they slid further around Harry’s waist towards his back—and stilled suddenly. A tight knot of tension coiled rapidly inside Draco’s chest.
Their eyes locked. There was something odd in Draco’s gaze, something Harry couldn’t really decipher. Then Draco’s face twisted into a sneer, and it was gone.
“I didn’t even know where exactly he was, only that it was with Lily’s relatives,” he admitted. “Dumbledore assured me it was the safest place for him to be, because it would grant him Lily’s protection through blood-wards. He insisted I stay away, that I let Harry grow up away from his fame, and he never told me
Draco gave a small chuckle. “You’re welcome,” he replied, and Harry pressed another soft kiss to his lips. For a moment they just looked at each other and Draco was already losing himself again in those green eyes, when an incredulous cry ripped through the air, making them jump apart.
It was Draco who eventually broke the silence. “Merlin’s beard, you’re right,” he breathed, his eyes flying back and forth between Harry and Snape. “He does look like him!”
“So, how are things between you and Harry?” he probed carefully. Harry had told him his side of things, of course, but Draco couldn’t help but wonder how Severus felt about it all.
What on earth was Dumbledore teaching Harry? Was he even teaching him anything? Or was this just another scheme to manipulate Harry into playing soldier for “the light side” as Dumbledore called it?
And then there was that little detail of how much Potter’s exterior had changed all of a sudden. Potter’s new face had completely thrown him off balance. Not that Draco would ever admit it, but Potter had always been stupidly attractive—even in his weird ill-fitted Muggle clothes—but now? Downright ridiculous. Even the slightly longer, jet-black hair that came down to his jaw in loose waves suited him.
Damn, I can’t believe I wrote this entire chapter in less than a day, but I guess that’s what NaNoWriMo does (if that’s over by now, now you know when this chapter was written).
He couldn’t take more than two steps towards the stairs before Remus stood in front of him, blocking his way. He gave Harry an imploring look and said, “We should talk about this.”
Suddenly, Severus remembered something else and called her back, “Wait, has Albus spoken to you already?”
“Hermione, it’s alright. I mean, I’m not happy about it either, but it’s not the first time I have to kill in order to survive.”
“It’s Sunday, Draco,” Harry said, then halted suddenly. “Are the shops even going to be open on Sunday?”
“I’m afraid I did not manage to give him detention again, though not for lack of trying. I think he’s planning to stop by on Sunday, given that he can get away from his Gryffindor friends unnoticed.”
“My grandfather built this school,” said Sadia in a dignified voice. “It is my honour to serve the Slytherin Head of House.”
They sat silently, both lost in thought, for a little while. Eventually Severus’ mind went back to their encounter three days ago and stubbornly refused to let it go again. Well, if Remus wouldn’t bring it up, he’d have to do it himself. That much about Gryffindor bravery.
We’re nearing the end of Part 1 (Summer), and Part 2 (Hogwarts) will bring some changes with it, mostly in regard to POV frequency, so be warned about that.
, making Harry shoot upright instantly. Last time the wards had felt like that, Severus had arrived cut open and covered in blood. Ignoring Draco’s mildly offended confusion, he jumped off the couch and dashed to the door. Within seconds, he was halfway downstairs, when he almost ran straight into Severus coming out of his potions lab.
“Yes, I did, it just wasn’t a Protego,” Harry insisted. “Anyway, your spells hit my shield and bounced—I simply timed my own attack to pass my shield at the exact moment yours bounced, so it would look like yours turned around rather than deflected.”
“We’ve tried to clean the house last summer as well as we could,” said Harry, just so there wouldn’t be this tense silence hanging over them, “but it was quite a challenge. Sirius is—
“I’ll take that as a no,” she said, smiling gently. “Have you considered telling him? Perhaps he is just as unsure as you, waiting for you to make a step.”
She smiled again, then approached him and extended her hand. “Very well, Harry, in that case please call me Narcissa. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you under more friendly circumstances.”
Sorry it took a while for this update, I have two more exams and an essay due next week, but at least the presentation I was dreading is through now. I hope to be updating faster again once this is all over.
Draco moaned, trying to latch onto Harry’s neck in return, but Harry still had their hands firmly pressed down to the bed and he moved just too far for Draco to reach. Indignation warred with arousal on Draco’s face for a moment, then he whined, “Harry, please.”
with that knowledge, despite Remus’ efforts to shut those thoughts down. Severus could be as gay as it got, it made no difference if the man was behaving the way he currently was.
“Draco,” he gasped, trying to focus on getting the confirmation he needed before he completely lost himself. “Can—”
Draco stepped up to Severus, lazily handing him his suitcase, his face set in an utterly convincing mask of bored arrogance. Severus ran the detection spell over it, knowing full well already what was inside—absolutely nothing of concern.
I have decided to upload the last few chapters of Part 1 with an actual schedule (whaaat) and so I’ll be posting 29 next Friday and 30 the week after that. However, there’s most likely going to be a bit of a break after those two chapters, so I can build my head start again.
Severus sighed, took a bite, chewed slowly and washed it down with a sip of water before finally speaking up, “The Dark Lord has found a willing recruit at Hogwarts. There’s going to be a Death Eater among the student body, and I don’t know who it is.” Draco sucked in a sharp breath and Harry’s face darkened. “I tried to get him to tell me, pretending that I would help whoever it was, but he refused. He insisted that it would be best if I knew nothing, in case Albus Dumbledore decided to read my mind.” Severus scoffed. “As if Albus would ever resort to the methods of the Dark Lord.”
“It was an arranged marriage. Even though I did not support Lucius’ allegiance to the Dark Lord, my parents insisted that I was to marry him or be shunned from the family. Both my father and Lucius assured me that I would not have to join the Dark Lord’s ranks myself, so I agreed eventually.”
it works, there’s some sort of reason for it. But these inheritances … what explanation could there possibly be other than that I’m
After finishing his meal, Severus retired to his lab. Albus’ arrival had interrupted him in the middle of brewing some healing potions to replenish his stock. He vanished the ruined mass in his cauldron and set up his workplace to start over. Entranced in his work as he was, he didn’t immediately notice that Remus entered the room.
Severus beckoned him inside, closing the door behind them and putting up a silencing charm, before following Harry to the seating area. As they settled down across from each other, Severus felt himself getting nervous again. This conversation could very well ruin all the progress he’d made in his relationship with Harry.
Each cut drew a scream, until Severus’ voice began to give out and screams diminished to hoarse yelps. He felt blood trickle down his legs, thought he heard it dripping to the floor. His arms were completely slashed open at this point, as were his thighs and the sides of his torso. Oddly, the Dark Lord had left the centre of his chest alone. Severus wasn’t sure whether he should be happy or concerned about that. So far, at least it appeared that he would be able to survive this.
bad thing to happen per day,” he muttered angrily. “But no, first this fucking prophecy business, then you send Harry into a fucking panic attack, and now Dumbledore is dying. Isn’t that just a lovely Wednesday?”
He started to pick at a sprig of peppermint, trying to control his irritation. It wasn’t actually Severus’ fault that they couldn’t make their relationship public, even if the childish part of Draco’s brain tried to blame it on him for being the one who pointed it out.
. He briefly wondered if Potter was using some weird sort of magic to make his insides feel like liquid, but the thought was pushed to the background by the feeling of Potter’s teeth nibbling on his ear.
A knock on the door pulled him out of his work, and he furrowed his brows. Who would visit him before the students had even arrived? He opened the door with a flick of his wand and Minerva stepped into the room.
“It wouldn’t. I am merely trying to be more clear in my communication, seeing as that created…issues before,” Severus drawled, sounding much more like himself now.
, your life might be in danger.” He tentatively reached out to Draco, brushing his fingertips along Draco’s cheek. “I can’t let anything happen to you,” he whispered.
Draco almost answered, only remembering at the last second that he was not supposed to know and would have no good explanation for knowing who Slughorn was. He forced himself to shrug instead.
“Well, there’s one that stands out in that regard, Neville Longbottom. He— It could’ve been him, you know? The prophecy. The Dark Lord could’ve chosen Longbottom instead of Harry, the prophecy could’ve applied to either of them. I know I should be ashamed of thinking this way, but I can’t shake the thought that Lily could’ve lived if the Dark Lord had gone for Longbottom instead, the thought that he
Furthermore, since Grimmauld Place has gone through some changes in this fic and I've been whining about it a little, my angel and saviour Alex (again
After greeting both Molly, who almost crushed his ribs with the hug she gave him, and Arthur, they were finally off towards the shops. As they wandered down the alley, Harry couldn’t help looking for a familiar head of blond hair, but to his dismay he never found it. He did notice other things though. The alley was much less crowded than the last time he’d been here, and everything looked…dull somehow. Perhaps it was the permanent fog that shrouded everything in a grey veil that gave it all such a bleak atmosphere, but Harry also noticed that more than a few shops seemed to be closed—for good.
“You acquired notebooks? Careful, Potter, if you go on like that people might start to believe you actually know how to use your brain, you’re almost as bad a swot as Hermione,” he said sarcastically.
“No glamour, this is what I actually look like now,” said Harry, settling Hedwig’s cage on the seat closest to the door, before sitting down next to Luna just as the train started to roll out of the station. He glanced out of the window, but the crowd was too dense to spot Remus. “It’s a bit of a long story, tell me about your summer first.”
. Harry needed him, and he didn’t need an angry werewolf on a vengeance trip. He needed comfort. So, instead of giving in to his anger, Remus nudged Harry again, before jumping up onto the bed and curling around him.
“Narcissa, can you hear me? Squeeze my hand if you do.” He was relieved to feel her grip tighten. She was responsive, that was a start. He cast a wandless diagnostic charm, but it came up clean. How could it come up clean?! His mind started to race through his growing repertoire of healing spells, but he needed to know what was happening to be able to help. He wished he had the journal and syringe from Draco with him.
Also, my apologies for being kinda behind on responding to comments, somehow my brain did not manage to fit that in with everything else in the two days since the last update. I still appreciate every comment so so much, they make me so happy. I'll do my best to catch up!
‘we’? I’m fairly certain by now that you’re not all that loyal to the Dark Lord, but that just leaves me with more questions. You brought me and mother here before you knew that you’re Potter’s father, so your connection to him has to be through something else. I’m guessing Dumbledore, the man is a meddler to the core, even Mother agrees with that. The most logical conclusion is that you’re not just disloyal, you’re an actual traitor to the Dark Lord. But there’s no certainty of that either; maybe you’re just using Dumbledore to protect mother and me—which we’re eternally grateful for, but if you eventually go back to the Dark Lord, what happens to us then?”
Dumbledore nodded, his smile giving way to an impersonal expression. “There are several things entailed in our meetings, but in this first one we must address an organisational matter before we can begin. As you have surely deduced at the welcoming feast, I approve of your choice of supervisor for the DA. We must, however, still decide on a time and place for these meetings to take place. Would you happen to have any suggestions?”
The First Wizarding War. That’s what they called it now, twenty years later. As if it had always been clear that there would be a second one. But they hadn’t known, had they? Nobody had told them that You-Know-Who would fall, only to rise again. Well, there was the prophecy. Even back then, there had been a lot of speculation about this supposed Chosen One, and when Albus Dumbledore had eventually approached the Potters, advising them to go into hiding, they had all assumed they would stay in hiding for years, until their child was grown.
Draco nodded with a heavy sigh. “I knew what I was in for, didn’t I? Might as well get it over with all the apologies I have to make.”
“Right. Well, if that was all you wanted to discuss, I’ll go now.” Harry stood, his expression stubborn.
“Is that so?” he drawled, growing more irritated by the second. Minerva nodded affirmatively, a smile spreading on her face. “Well, that’s wonderful. Except that it’s clearly not true since James isn’t Potter’s father.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, his relief at being rid of the horrendous thing overpowering his distrust of Mrs Malfoy momentarily.
“Of course not,” Harry said vehemently. “His safety is the most important thing, but that doesn’t mean I like what we have to do to guarantee it. I’ll do it, but I don’t have to like it.”
Harry fell silent again for a few minutes, staring out of the window. Remus kept his eyes on Harry’s face, as myriad emotions flitted across it, most of them distinctly negative. Once again he wished he could take some of the burdens Harry was carrying onto himself. Some of the grief, some of the confusion, some of the ridiculous responsibilities. He wondered what Harry was thinking, wishing he could at least ask. But Harry answered his unspoken question as if he’d read Remus’ mind.
“Thank you all. Now, it is my hope that we will discover ourselves to be stronger and more united than we have ever been. This is our chance at a new beginning, and to embrace all the hope and joy the future may hold. It is my wish that we all move forwards together from this point, with open minds and hearts.
“I didn’t see anything,” Blaise clarified, “but it’s all anyone is talking about. Potter was spotted going into one of the toilets with Finch-Fletchley. They’ve been in there for half an hour.”
He’d taken his time wandering down to the village. The day was still beautiful. Freezing, but beautiful, and he’d enjoyed appreciating the scenery the way he rarely ever did. Hogsmeade in the snow was the way the village was meant to be. The tiny houses and shops always looked their best and most magical with a coating of glittering frost, and their roofs heavy with snow.
So Draco found himself heading to the Great Hall with two Hufflepuffs. It wasn’t even 8am and his mind was already reeling.
“I’m not giving you the gory details,” he said coyly. “It was a thing that happened. George can be an incredibly serious person, but only about 2% of the time, so it didn’t last. I don’t have any regrets about it. I think that’s the most important thing. I just wish that Ron didn’t know. He’s so squeamish about his family.”
When everyone confirmed they did, Blaise made a little circle with his wand, his lips moving soundlessly. Draco felt the familiar warmth in his fingers from the spell.
Conversations around the Hall slowly died out when raised voices could be heard through the open double doors, getting louder. Just as the voices were close enough to be in earshot, and Draco heard “I don’t know what you expect me to say...”, they cut off suddenly. Everyone was craning around to see who would enter the Hall, when moments later Weasley stomped in. He was red in the face, and his expression was murderous. Granger shot out of her seat, her eyes wide with worry, but when Weasley got to the table he ignored her and attacked a plate of sausages. She hovered near him hopefully, before giving up and returning to her book.
“Apparently I’m triggered when arseholes are homophobic... you might remember that I have a bit of a short fuse.”
He looked down at the exposed mark on his chest, biting his lip, but she had already guessed about the spell, so he didn’t think there was any point trying to hide it.
The next morning Draco woke up slowly,  incredibly comfortable, to the upbeat sounds of Finch-Fletchley’s music. When Draco pulled back the curtains of his bed, the boy in question was nowhere to be seen. Draco frowned and checked the time, but it was still early. The cold jolt of the floor against his bare feet was enough to wake him fully, and he stretched before getting up to dress. He caught himself nodding along with the music as he tied his hair back, and found he didn’t mind.
“That’s not who I am Draco. I meant everything I’ve said to you. I want to leave the past in the past, and I know you do too.” She sounded earnest.
He was giggling until he glanced towards the open door, and saw Longbottom and Weasley staring at him with varying degrees of shock and alarm. They were both frozen, Longbottom’s fist extended to knock the door opposite their room. The door behind which, Draco suddenly remembered, Potter would be.
Boot rallied and changed tact, grabbing Draco’s chin roughly and forcing his head down to Boot's eye level.
His wild, unruly hair was long across the top of his head, but shaved around ears which were now studded with silver hoops and dangling chains. There was another silver ring through the dark slash of his eyebrow. His glasses were gone, and his fringe fell over one of his brilliantly green eyes.
“I’m well aware. I shared a room with you for 7 years,” Draco reminded him icily, “What do you want me to do about it? I’m not going to come and put you to bed every night to do it for you.”
So the plan is that I'll be uploading every week on a Wednesday, because Wednesday's are rubbish and it'll give me something to look forward to. I'm writing this mainly for myself to prove that I can, but I'm more than happy for anyone to come along on this party train with me! I hope you stick around.
Finch-Fletchley’s tight, posh accent always caught Draco off guard. He had a way of speaking which was at once familiar and foreign to Draco, very similar to the way his father’s friends had spoken, but ever so slightly off. It was pompous yet jovial.
After sending the letter and grabbing a light breakfast, he headed back to his room. He needed to start the long, agonising process of choosing what to wear.
“Fine... there’s not a lot to tell really. I’d had a crush on him from afar for a few years, but then in fifth year I joined the DA and I got to spend so much more time with him.”
“Sitting,” said Draco bluntly, raising his chin to look down his nose at Potter while his head was still lolling back. “Obviously.”
It was the last weekend before the Christmas holidays. The following Saturday everyone would be leaving to go home. Justin told Draco that Finnigan had tried to arrange another party for the Saturday evening, but it hadn’t worked out. Draco privately believed that the reason the party wasn’t going ahead was because of Potter. He’d seen Potter and Finnigan arguing in the corner of the common room on Thursday evening, over a game of exploding snap. Justin heard that it’d been decided that there would be a New Year’s party when they all got back at the start of the next term instead.
“Is this some sort of joke to you Potter?” he said menacingly, stalking forwards, “What did Hermione tell you?”
Tracey laughed, “Rules are made to be broken Longbottom. You can say something you’ve done as long as you don’t mind everyone seeing you drink as well. I just want to get everyone drunk.”
Draco stilled and Pansy huffed a quiet laugh beside him. He was beyond confused. He hadn’t thought he’d been giving off those sorts of signals.
He looked past her, and saw Granger standing at the corner of the shelves, staring at them quizzically.
“Well thanks Boot for bringing up the war and ruining the party atmosphere,” said Blaise frostily. “Probably time to call it a night.”
He was immediately relieved that he had good reason to forgive Potter for today. He hadn’t really wanted to end things before they had even started.
“Darling, why are you dressed as an octopus this morning? It’s a bold choice of look, but I can’t say I’m a fan.”
“Don’t be silly. Madam Pomfrey will fix you up and you’ll be right as rain... and then you can tell me what happened.” There was a surprising steeliness to her voice that brokered no argument, and Draco really didn’t have the energy right now to try.
He was getting more annoyed with her by the second and he couldn’t fully grasp why. He only knew that he felt viscerally opposed to being social.
Draco pulled himself to his feet, cradling his pounding head in his hand. He’d forgotten about the gash on his palm, and left a bloody smear through his hair and down the side of his face. Pansy whimpered, and wrapped an arm around him.
He didn’t seem inclined to get up again. He tipped his head back against the stone floor, closing his eyes. Draco sighed and bent over to haul him to his feet.
Being an anxious person and getting into these situations was just asking for trouble. Draco was horribly twitchy for the rest of the week. To make matters worse, Hermione decided that Potter couldn’t be trusted to communicate effectively. This was a fair point, but slightly annoying when she forbade Draco from speaking to him until Saturday.
She fixed his leg first with a very complicated incantation, and he was a little relieved he hadn’t attempted it himself. The relief from the sudden lack of pain was almost sickening, his stomach unclenching when he hadn’t even realised it was. He hadn’t registered how much pain he had been in until it was gone.
Potter sauntered in with his hands in his pockets, as though the whole school hadn’t just heard him have a screaming match with his best friend. He glanced around, the ring through his eyebrow glinting. He didn’t head towards the eighth year table, but instead made a beeline for the Ravenclaw table. He sat down next to the Lovegood girl, bowing his head to speak to her. After a moment he slumped against her, his head on her shoulder, and she patted his hair like he was an oversized puppy.
She looked at him with her knowing eyes that told him she knew exactly how long he had been listening.
“No need to alert the media Pans. Finch-Fletchley is my roommate this year, and he has far superior manners and much more grace than either you or I.”
He became engrossed in the book, content to wait, but when he looked up he realised another hour had gone past. There was still no sign of Potter. He frowned.
Blaise pulled Pansy to her feet and dragged her back into the press of bodies. The whole room seemed to be moving and pulsing to the rhythm of the music. Draco stayed where he was and let it all wash over him.
“Ummm... I had a head start on the Arithmancy questions?” he guessed, wracking his brain for what she could mean. Why was everyone acting so oddly today?
“That’s actually really helpful,” he found himself saying out loud. He knew he must be flushed with embarrassment.
Draco stood frozen, staring at her. Arranged marriages were not uncommon in pure blood families. If the war hadn’t happened, his father would have already arranged Draco’s own engagement. He would have had very little say in the matter. As awful as it had been, Draco was suddenly very relieved the war had happened.
It was a pale grey now, but still so clear against his alabaster skin. The ugly skull and twisting serpent always seemed to stare back at him mockingly, and he vividly remembered the burning sensation that had engulfed him whenever he was summoned. This was all people would ever see when they looked at him.
Potter took a few steps forward, stumbled, and reached out to grab hold of Draco to steady himself. Draco automatically put his hand on Potter’s hip, and Potter stepped even closer, sliding his hands down onto Draco’s waist.
He still hadn’t found her after 30 minutes of searching the crowd, and now he was dreadfully bored. He danced for a little bit, but it was no fun without his friends. He went to refill his drink, and spotted that over in the back corner one of the few remaining sofas was somehow magically empty. He made a beeline for it and claimed one of the cushions.
No matter his recent behaviour, Harry Potter was still an influential figure in society. If Potter was willing to publicly date him, it would be tantamount to him forgiving Draco’s past sins. That would have to go some way to clearing his own reputation just a bit. Enough to help his future. It might even be enough to stop the other students violent reactions towards him.
He read the letter calmly over his omelette and black coffee, finishing with an eye roll so exaggerated they could probably see it over at the Hufflepuff table.
“You should leave them in for a bit. If you take them out before the party your hair will be all wavy. It’ll look lovely.”
Draco smiled, but inside he felt his anxiety swell again. Being himself around Harry Potter was never something he’d been good at. With all the progress he’d made so far this year opening up to new people, Potter was the one person who really scared him. In a good way or a bad way, he couldn’t tell yet, but it would take a lot for him to be able to relax around Potter.
Draco stood in the uncomfortable silence she left behind, desperately trying to conjure up the illusion that he was unconcerned with Potter’s presence. Potter didn’t look at him, but ran his fingers over the spines of the books on the shelf beside him.
He looked up at her gratefully as she began to pass her wand over him, muttering to herself as she catalogued his injuries.
Potter swayed, looking lost. Draco groaned in exasperation, running anxious hands through his hair. He couldn’t just leave Potter like this.
“Hermione, let’s not talk about this now,” Potter said wearily. “You could actually talk to me any time, if the child over there let’s you that is,” he looked pointedly at Weasley.
“What flavour of ice cream?...” Lovegood began to ask, before she turned to Draco with wide eyes as though just remembering he was there.
The volume levels on Justin’s record player were really being tested. People were sort of dancing, it was hard to tell in the crowd. Someone had hung up orange and black streamers, and little paper pumpkins and bats floated about overhead.
Maybe he’d get lucky, and spending actual time with Potter would cure him of this infatuation. He was probably really boring when you spent a lot of time in his company.
“No,” he said more gently, “We’ve never hooked up if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve actually never done that with anyone...”
“I... That’s... This has nothing to do with me!” he stammered. “I just think you should be a little more sensitive to the fact that Justin still likes you. It’s cruel.”
“Every time I see you I’m apologising,” Potter continued sheepishly. He looked Draco up and down, his expression softening.
He laughed and caught her hand to kiss the back of it. When he turned back, a few people still looked confused.
“We go around the circle one at a time, and you say ‘never have I ever’ before saying something you’ve never done. If anyone here HAS done it, they have to drink. Get it?” Tracey answered excitedly, grinning.
There had been a collection at lunchtime, everyone contributing some money for alcohol, and then Finnigan, Thomas, and Potter all went down into Hogsmeade to buy a selection. They didn’t get back until the party was just about to begin, and they had clearly gotten a head start on drinking while they were out. Longbottom and Weasley had been down to the kitchens to get some snacks, and Justin had volunteered his record player. Thankfully he had a lot more records than just the Spice Girls.
His tone was only slightly mocking, but it worked on Potter like a charm. The flustered, slightly helpless look vanished from those green eyes in less than a heartbeat, replaced by a flare of irritation. Still keeping his wand at the ready, Potter snatched up his book and glared at Draco.
“How are you feeling?” Remus asked once Severus had a full plate of breakfast in front of him, eyeing him worriedly, despite looking rather worn out himself. Right, it had been the full moon. He took a bite of toast and warmth spread through his stomach, spurring him into eating faster.
“That’s none of your concern,” Severus answered curtly, hoping Draco would just let it go. Then a thought struck him. Lupin had offered him to take up residence at Grimmauld Place. Grimmauld Place was big enough to house two more people.
“Do you want the high ground?” he muttered to Remus with a wink. “Would give you a fighting chance at least.”
