They caught their breaths lying on their backs, Harry’s hand on Draco’s. He took off his T-shirt and wiped the come off his skin. He turned to Draco, who gazed at him with dark eyes, and cleaned him too.
Next to the other students at Hogwarts he'd seemed so confident, so tall and loud and
"Hermione?"
Harry feels awkward. "Well, uh, I was just wondering... you're usually good with, like, feelings and stuff, yeah?"
"You're wrong," he says quietly as he wipes his face dry with the sleeve of his robes. "It's not okay."
"It's okay, Draco," he whispers. Using Malfoy's first name feels
It's at the beginning of Harry's fifth year that he understands the reason behind his odd attachment. Attraction. Not
ok so harry's description of draco in this chapter is basically word for word stolen from the book, which first of all credit to j.k. and second of all it kind of proves how canon this shit really is when i'm able to use unedited content for a fanfic about their love. js. i mean. not that the description is erotic or anything but just the fact that he noticed. and tbh the words are so fucking sad they can't have been thought by harry in like a matter-of-factly way
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco pauses for a bit, frowning as he appears to consider whether he should say something else or not. “I, um, I just wondered if I could tell you one more thing about Astoria?” He’s fiddling with the sleeves of his jacket, as he looks nervously at Harry.
“You’ll be fine”, he says in a low voice, trying his best to sound calm and comforting despite knowing that his words can’t possibly make anything better for Draco right now. “You’re not alone.”
Malfoy frowns. "Girlfriend? Potter, have you been imagining things?"
basically the battle of hogwarts only shortened and mainly focusing on the little bits where harry sees or thinks about draco (bc this is a drarry fic in case you haven't noticed yet) (yes, sarcasm) and also it's really short. whatta nice summary i really should be a published author huh? enjoy
will be with him. The two of them were getting into a quarrel outside of the Great Hall after Harry heard Malfoy loudly singing
Hermione looks amused. "I guess so," she says. "Go on."
"That's probably for the best," Draco gives Harry a small smile back. Seeing Draco's smile, and knowing that he was the cause of it, makes Harry feel inexplicably happy.
brewing a Sleeping Draught because he's running low on it. No doubt Snape only does this to further torture Harry.
Finding out it was Marietta Edgecombe who'd told Umbridge about the DA provided Harry with an excellent reason to finally put an end to his and Cho's bizarre relationship. Surely, they never would've lasted anyway; Harry knows he's just been acting as Cedric's replacement.
“I don’t know what to do,” he says, his voice barely more than a whisper. Harry squeezes his hand and waits for him to keep going.
another short one
Once up in the air Harry starts scanning the room from above, frantically trying to see where the diadem went in all the turmoil caused by the fire. Knowing his priority must be to defeat Voldemort, even though his eyes are desperately trying to find not only the diadem but also a certain blond boy lost among the flames, the thick smoke and the enormous piles of furniture and discarded things.
"Screw you, ferret." Harry says before turning his back on Malfoy and walking away.
and he is being an even worse pain the arse than normal. Unfortunately, he still looks great and Harry often finds himself staring at him in Potions and Care of Magical Creatures (although he does his best to make sure it just looks like evil glares).
Now, this makes things a tad bit complicated. In fact, it's a bloody mess. Whenever he's around Malfoy, Harry doesn't quite know what to do with himself. Naturally, he keeps up appearances for he isn't one to become flustered in the face of his enemies, but internally he is constantly screaming when Malfoy is around. It happens that the two get so caught up in their constant bickering during class, it is more often than not the very main reason for Harry's continuously failed potions. Of course he's going to ruin Harry's grades as well. Git. Even worse is when Malfoy decides to get up all close and personal, trying to act cool by shouting his insults mere inches from Harry's face. The (questionably imaginary) sexual tension drives Harry
"Like what?" Harry asks, genuinely curious. There are no similarities between them that he can think of.
to identify the "mudblood" as Harry's friend, Draco still tries not to give them up.
"I'm the one who's sorry," he says. "I never even stopped to think about why you behave the way you do. When I first came to Hogwarts, I'd been bullied my whole life, and you reminded me of that a bit. I guess I never really gave you a chance to begin with."
Then Draco shouts in his ear: "The door, get to the door, the door!" And Harry snaps out of it, steering the broom towards the exit. He makes a quick detour when he spots the diadem (which has Draco screaming and holding on to Harry so tightly it hurts), but then they're finally out of the room crashing into the wall outside and rolling onto the floor.
“Being gay in the wizarding world isn’t a big deal. But marrying someone with whom I wouldn’t be able to have a biological child… My father would’ve never accepted it. I’m their only kid and there is pressure on me to continue the bloodline. There was no other option for me.” At this point he’s rambling, the words are falling out of his mouth quickly. He licks his lips nervously and continues:
"I- I need to talk to Ginny," he manages to stutter out in a shaky voice. He sees Draco's face fall, but he can't think about that now. "Goodbye," he says and rushes out of the café.
Malfoy opens his mouth to answer, but at the same time he happens to glance down at Harry's hands and rushes forward to stop him from making another mistake. "No, no,
you brainless loser, she's just a friend."
As for Snape, Harry doesn't care. Snape is essentially the reason Harry's parents are dead, and he doesn't mind having another reason to hate him.
"I haven't got any options!" Draco exclaims, pulling Harry out of his thoughts. "I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!"
“Fair enough. Noon’s good,” he smiles.
Harry sits up and looks over at Draco who is lying face down, gasping, coughing, and retching.
as always, i appreciate feedback even if it's negative.
Harry doesn’t know if it’s going to be a big ceremony. Maybe this funeral is just meant for close family, maybe Harry isn’t supposed to be there at all. He hardly knows anything about Astoria aside from her name and the fact that she was married to Draco.
“The fact that you feel guilty,” Harry says, “Shows that you have changed. Maybe you did some bad things, but that doesn’t make you a bad person. Just as a few good acts don’t make you a good person. The thing is, you can’t go back in time and change everything. All you can do is apologize, and to be better now. And I have to believe that’s enough.”
It’s been such a long time since Harry had read that story. It was one of his old favourites. But now it left a sour taste in his mouth. The side story with the village forgetting the prince seemed to hurt him a little more than necessary.
At that moment, Minerva stood up and addressed the students. The announcements were over within seconds, and soon everyone had food appear in front of them.
He wondered if he should move, until muttering bounced off his ears.
Then he grabbed the new journal he bought. The new quills, and inkwells, the new muggle pens too. He rearranged them on his desk the way that felt right, even if it was different from before.
But his grip is quickly loosening though, he can feel it.
Harry stood still, thankful that everyone was still really busy with each other and not noticing Harry yet. Malfoy appeared next to him, and put his hand on his shoulder. Harry immediately narrowed in on the touch. They haven’t really touched, unless you count accidental bumps. They kept their distance from each other, but this touch was definitely with purpose.
“Good.”
“What happened?” Hermione's voice was gentle, not pushing too much.
“Nope. She’s been sitting on your head proudly since you came in. To be honest, I thought she’d get bored and fly off…” Malfoy grabbed his bowl again and started eating, watching Isolt like a movie.
“Why did you do that?” Malfoy asked, letting go of Harry’s arm.
Three neatly stacked boxes shimmered into view. Harry gasped and stood up, walking to them quickly. Malfoy followed. Before Harry could open the box to look inside, Malfoy’s hand landed on the top.
“I read about it while in this study group I had with other 7th years. They were talking about the great potioneers of the wizarding world, and I just... “ She slowed to a stop. “Got inspired I guess.”
Harry, noting the way he didn’t seem to want to talk more about it, nodded.
Kingsley, still standing in the doorway, nodded to Harry. “Welcome back, Harry.”
“Rough day at work?” Blaise asked, reaching over for a slice of treacle cake.
“Why are you apologising?” Malfoy asked, similarly to the way he asked Harry before.
When he looked up to the counter, Malfoy was there, smiling apologetically at him. Harry didn’t realise why until his eyes glanced over at the people beside him.
“Harry,” Malfoy says, stepping closer to Harry. The first movement from him for a long time. “It’s still you.”
Malfoy nodded, then moved to turn back around. Before he could, Harry spoke up once more.
Minerva nodded and smiled in such a motherly way his heart swelled at the sight.
“Of course.” Malfoy, swift and elegant, moved away from the tense situation without having said a single word to either of the three. If Harry could strangle him, he would.
Harry nodded and followed him through to the training rooms for new aurors.Past the swimming pools and training dummies, classrooms and blackboards. He remembered training vigorously for a year with Ron struggling beside him, jokes and laughter while puffing exhaustedly.
Finally, what came next was his hearing, or at least the voices. It was hushed but urgent whispers. His head was pounding too loud to focus on them, but at least he wasn’t alone.
Harry learnt that Luna wasn’t working with creatures anymore, she was looking into wandmaking after a dream she had about Mr Ollivander. She was working under him, learning about the different cores to the woods, from lengths to designs. She found she loved it a lot more than the creatures, though a part of that would always be in her heart. She still edited for the Quibbler one the side, but more people had come to them for a job, so she wasn’t needed as intensely as before. Her father’s quite ecstatic about it.
Malfoy noticed, and conjured a glass and cast a simple augementi. He offered the glass to Harry, who took it gratefully. He nodded his thanks.
Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry, waiting for him to come along. Harry looked at Lara waving off customers as they left. The idea started to come back.
Parkinson gritted her teeth, her claw clenching. “What do you see, exactly?”
“No, I haven’t seen him. Do you-”
“Anyway, I’ve been thinking,” Harry started. “I should take Teddy back to the park near my house, maybe he’ll see his friends there again. I think he’d appreciate it, it’s been a while since we all went there.”
Harry continued eating a lot slower than when he started. He watched Malfoy, still trying to get a gauge on who unknown Malfoy was.
Harry chuckled in response, and began to move through the other archway leading to the dining table. It was a modest table, it wasn’t grand or overbearing like he feared it would be. There were scratch marks on it. His fingers traced over them, and he smiled. This table was well loved, it made Harry almost tear up.
He went back downstairs, and unpacked the new picture frames he bought. There weren’t many, but 5 seemed to be a good amount. They all ranged from small photo sizes to large ones. A small part of Harry wanted to frame new memories, ones that had him now in it.
The second was of Malfoy and the toddler. There was no Harry in this one. The toddler was giggling, sitting high on Malfoy’s shoulders. Malfoy was looking up at him, not caring about how tightly the kid’s hold was on his hair. It was so sweet. This moment captured seemed to calm him down a bit from the overwhelming situation.
Where? Harry didn’t know. From what? He didn't know that either. But the adrenaline shot through his veins. Even with energy bursting in his body, he stayed still and staring.
A bigger part of him wanted that to be the first one he hangs up on the wall.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, then smiled at the note. Malfoy was a good friend, even if their current label was ‘???’ He was very glad to have him beside him.
Malfoy was gripping Harry’s arm tightly, not letting him go and run away. Harry's heart was beating out of his chest. Maybe the kiss was too much, after all. But surely unknown Harry used to do that? That’s something he always imagined himself doing to his beloved ever since he was young, so why?
“Oh, uh,” Harry looked at the food, then faced the person serving food. “I’ll just get a ham, cheese, tomato and lettuce sandwich, and a mac and cheese.”
Harry and Teddy just laughed and hummed along with her. They hummed and mumbled unsure words of the song for at least 15 whole minutes before Teddy got bored and jumped out of Harry’s arms.
It was so strikingly domestic, his heart felt a strong pull. But even so, he needed to remember it all first. He wasn’t going to do anything like this. Not while he wasn’t really himself.
Malfoy stayed on the kitchen floor on all fours. He was shaking now, trembling. Harry coughed up a bit of blood. Wiping his hands on his trousers, he tried to calm down his breathing.
He tried to get up, but his knees gave out. Just when he needed it, a pair of pale delicate hands helped him up and get to the couch a few steps away. He wiped clean his glasses, and put them back on only to stare at the carpet, and the soot stain, in high definition.
Hermione reached out and held his hand, squeezing it reassuringly. It was nice, but something was off about it. It didn’t feel right. It didn’t feel like it does in his dreams.
Ron and Hermione shared a look before pushing open the doors to a beautiful and busy environment. Harry heard the dinging bell, orders being yelled over the counter, and the sound of people’s conversations overlapping each other.
“You okay, Harry?” Goyle asked.
“Fine.” He said to himself, and started picking up the mess.
“Yeah?” Harry wasn’t sure he was comfortable with Malfoy calling him by his first name just yet. Even though they’ve been dating for a while, it still shocked him a bit.
After the apothecary visit, the Daily Prophet had a field day. Throwing out conspiracy theories as to why ‘The Boy Who Lived to Hide.’ Harry didn’t even get through half of the article before he
The wards wouldn’t let any strangers in, and Harry knew, or at least trusted, his currently unknown friends not to show up unannounced when Malfoy wasn’t here. So when he walked into the living room and saw Ron and Hermione waiting patiently for him, he had half a mind to walk right back to his office.
“Hey, Neville. How’ve you been?”
It didn’t even occur to him until he was riding up the elevator that his name was the headline. Again. He didn’t remember it word for word but he knew it was something to do with his ministry visit a few days ago. Why his face was still in the news, he didn’t want to know.
Kingsley seemed to release his own tension too. “Thank you. I’ll inform them of your arrival.”
Harry looked at them and smiled, genuinely smiled. The slow simmer in his chest was controlled, and he knew he had them. That it was successful and that it had worked.
Harry nodded in understanding. The small area was perfect for studying and thinking. It had the aura of the Hogwarts library but it didn’t make you feel like you were drowning in books.
? How do you do that? Wait, had she not yet returned from this morning? The small bit of concern he crushed this morning came back full blast.
He stepped back, away from Kingsley’s desk and simply asked with betrayal laced in one syllable, “Why?”
The wooden stairs were beautiful. The third step had a creak that sounded like a cry from the Whomping Willow, and it scared Harry half to death. The handrails were simple yet elegant. The best thing was there was no cupboard underneath the stairs. It seemed to be taken off and destroyed.
Nott held out his hand for a handshake. Harry looked at it, unsure of what to do. But when Nott’s hand started to fall, Harry grabbed it and smiled.
Harry shook his head. As if he needed more reminders of the failure he was ever since he woke up.
Harry didn’t know how to proceed. There were too many unknowns in how things are in this world he woke up to. Kingsley and Malfoy were on good terms, maybe even good friends. He realised, as if his mind couldn’t help but betray him, that not only has he lost memories of his own friendships, but also the friendship of his friends.
“Go and see Draco, Harry. Go and have a break.” Lavender smiled before she stepped onto the elevator.
Holy shit.
The sun’s heat was less intense as he watched the students running up the hill, discussing their next classes.
Malfoy looked startled for a brief millisecond. He swallowed his food and nodded. “It was one of the worst, there’s this customer who keeps telling me I give him the wrong potions. Says I give him a calming draught instead of a sleeping draught.” Malfoy scoffed. “Those two are as different as your hands and feet.”
“How did this all happen?” Harry asked, still gazing over the sight.
Malfoy, damn him, must’ve felt Harry’s gaze because he looked right at him.
For a second, Harry realised that the easy joking of memories he’d lost was a bit easier. Maybe he could try again, his plans. The ones he shoved aside during the day. But the sun was down, and there were two people he had yet to meet for the first time
Harry continued to eat his dinner without conversation with anyone. He must’ve given off the vibe that he didn’t want to be spoken to, because Neville didn’t talk to him again after the school was dismissed and the food disappeared.
Harry twisted his head to face the person behind him. Lavender looked at him with a mixture of concern and pity. He hated it.
Harry smiled, and quickly wrote back a reply saying that it was okay. Just as he tied the letter back on the owl’s leg, Malfoy came back with an owl treat. The owl took it gratefully, and continued resting for a short while next to Isolt in her cage.
There were three left to unpack, face down. Harry blinked the tears away from his eyes. He flexed and unflexed his hands, trying to calm the shake that seemed to grow.
“Yeah?” A shout from downstairs.
Harry, for the first time, saw how much love Goyle had for the two as Goyle looked over at his boyfriends with a soft smile.
At that point, Hermione and Ron looked like they already understood and were ready to apologise for not thinking, but Harry just continued.
Harry wanted to run, to back away and shake his head and put all those thoughts back in the ‘for later’ pile that has grown so tall. He didn’t even realise his heart was booming through his chest until it was the only thing he could hear. Like it was an earthquake, shaking the very core of his soul, towers swaying back and forth, breaking and falling and losing structure. He couldn’t move. He tried to force his fingertips to twitch, or his eyes to blink or look away, but nothing was working.
“Here’s the floo, Harry. International is on and everything,” Neville led Harry to the corner where the floo is
“Wow, that’s a lot of dedication,” Harry commented.
“Like the lacewing fly is used in polyjuice potion, right?”
“Dinner will be here soon. Call Isolt home when you come down.”
And his mind descended into a spiral. He wasn’t sure if he was even breathing anymore. Was there still blood in his veins? Beating of his heart?
“I’m sure. Neville says Nott has his on international all the time. It would be easier.”
“I’m really happy for you, Nev. They’re brilliant boyfriends, and they treat you well.”
Hermione was Minister of Magic, he knew, and at least he could remember. She was great. She passed law after law that brought the people together. She had a ban on sleeping draughts after the war as people started getting addicted, and the healthcare was more welcoming. Healers got more patients, people got better. She lifted the ban, and nothing went terribly wrong.
“Yeah, right. He did all these amazing things at Hogwarts, was still in the aurors, and had all these great friendships.”
Despite all the memories gone, Hogwarts hadn’t changed. The walls still had the same cracks, the same weeds, the same feel as they did before. Hogwarts was still there, seemingly untouched by the lack of his memories. It calmed him.
He moved forward, hand outstretched in front of him. As soon as it was close enough to the hippogriff, he stopped, allowing it to choose whether to move forward into his hand. It did, and he pet the hippogriff gently, admiring the feel and looks of their feathers from up close.
Teddy just smiled. “Yeah, it was one of the first stories you read to me.”
Finally, there was space for his new books on the shelves. Malfoy’s books now reordered in a completely new way that still, somehow, felt like him.
He quickly ran downstairs to the floo where Malfoy was patiently waiting. Before Harry could grab some powder, Malfoy stopped him.
Before Harry could reply, Malfoy’s shadow and footsteps moved away from the door.
But if he had to choose between too much or nothing at all, he’d go with too much.
Harry looked over at Blaise still standing in front of the door. He looked like a security guard, ready to deny access to anyone wanting to enter, or in this case, anyone wanting to leave.
Harry wanted to grab his wand, to hold it out and against Malfoy but something stopped him. Some sort of muscle memory that kept a level of logic when Harry’s mind couldn’t. But Harry was seeing more and more red.
“Oh, thank you. I didn’t realise they were blown away,” She said, reaching out for his notes.
“Pansy, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Harry tried again.
Harry didn’t realise that the sun had gone down until the floo roared behind him while he was still putting his books in.
The office was complete a few hours later. It wasn’t a completely new office, but this one felt right. This one felt more Harry now, than it did before. A part of him was nervous about this change, but he knew this was moving on.
He stared at the ceiling, its blurred nothingness. The covers clung to his body like a second skin. But he didn’t reach for his glasses, nor his watch. He just laid there, and breathed.
*****
“Aw man, now the noodles are overcooked.” Harry frowned as he ate.
Much too soon, the class was over. As Harry helped the third years pack up the knick knacks from Hagrid’s hippogriff grooming lesson, the students talked to him about the duelling club.
Through his chest aching cries, Malfoy stayed beside him. He didn’t hug him or touch him, but he was there. That was perfect for Harry. He didn’t think he could handle anything else right now.
Harry looked at Malfoy with surprise. But he just smirked and shrugged in response.
Lara just kept smiling, her hands fiddling. “Are you okay, Harry?”
Even as they walked out of the pub, having already paid and gave Madam Rosmerta a hefty tip, Harry was still giggling.
Malfoy thought for a bit, then sat next to Harry on the floor. They weren’t facing each other, and somehow, that made it easier to talk. Just like when they talked about Harry’s desk job.
Malfoy looked… confused, hopeful, unsure and scared all at the same time. They stared at each other for what felt like years. All of Harry’s thoughts about work seeped out of his mind. All he thought of now was what he was doing, and what he had done.
“How long was I out?” Harry asked, feeling the pit in his stomach slowly grow.
!” The incantation reached normal speed halfway through.
Of course, Teddy won.
But Neville didn’t take it, he just laughed. “No need, they treat me like a king.” Neville kept smiling. “And I, them.”
Harry realised the hands that held his while he slept was Malfoy’s. Harry quickly put that thought away for later. There was another pressing matter at hand.
The sound of a kettle boiling, and clinks of mugs hit their ears as they waited for healer Tina to come back. Harry wanted to talk to Ron and Hermione, but he didn’t know where to begin. Honestly, he just wanted to sleep.
bad if everything could be recalled like that.
Malfoy sighed sadly.
*****
“It was great, thank you. When did you learn to cook?”
“Oh, but that’s not all,” Ginny continued, completely ignoring George. “Ron was really stressed that day, so he was eating more than usual. He kept asking for more food.”
The trio laughed together.
“How is Draco by the way?”
Harry laughed. “Draco got so sunburnt, the git put too much trust in those charms.” Words taken from Andromeda, and dressed up as if it were his own.
He just smiled at Tatus, still sniffling a little bit, and hugged them too. Tatus was the hippogriff he felt a connection with right now, and Harry knew it was the same vice versa.
Harry continued resting on the chair, waiting for the pain in his stomach to subside. Whilst he waited, he took note of the room. There were shelves on the corner overflowing with books, he noticed some were muggle stories, the others were magical textbooks. The books were all over the place, but for some reason, he knew there was an order to this mess. Organised chaos.
“But you didn’t, Malfoy.” Harry looked at him and smiled, even if Malfoy wouldn’t look at him. “I’m still here.”
When Harry said goodbye a few hours later, he hugged Teddy just a little bit tighter and kissed the top of his head. He thanked Andromeda for letting him in on such short notice.
He put down today’s Daily Prophet newspaper with ferociousness. Frustration tingling in his fingertips, but held back with taught control. It wasn’t as bad as it could have been.
“Yeah, at pretty much every event.” Neville noted.
Harry just chuckled, and waved him off. “Yeah, I know.”
“Because… I wanted… to?” Technically, it wasn’t a lie, but it sure sounded like one.
‘I must not tell lies,’ it said. The blood left Harry’s face, and he stared at it. Even with Isolt moving down, hooting softly, Harry didn’t take his eyes off of the words.
He didn’t miss how Teddy said the last words with him.
“Sometimes we just need one person to tell us we can do it, you know?” Malfoy smiled through teary eyes at his memory. “Just one. Mr Rizer was that for me.”
Before he could even move, he felt a new cleanliness wash over him. It was refreshing and filled with Malfoy’s magic. It lingered for a moment before slowly washing away.
“Um, yes. Molly told me she invited him.”
The first of the last, was of Harry and a toddler. He couldn’t tell what colour the toddler’s hair was or what words he was saying, but Harry held him. The toddler sat high on his hip despite seeming to be too big for that. The way Harry looked at the toddler… There was something about it, something that he knew he would only save for that one.
Harry looked at Malfoy as he crumbled. Malfoy couldn’t seem to look at Harry anymore. His shoulders dropped, leaving the tension that was so tightly together. He took a deep breath, and closed his eyes tightly.
“It’s bacon and eggs today?” Harry said, noticing the smell of bacon in the air.
“Lavender? You work here?” He asked, gesturing wildly to the entire investigative group.
He walked around the lake. There were no students about and the sun was lowering, hitting the lake in a way it shimmered and sparkled. The shadows were long now, and the wind was softer, seemingly adjusting to the lack of heat now.
“Oh? But your potions notes are incredible.”
He’d watched the pensieve memories so many times he could reenact them as if it were a one man show.
“What do you want to know?” Parkinson asked, this time out of curiosity, not caution.
Neville and Goyle looked at Nott sitting between them, tongue slightly poking out as he continued to write quickly, as if the words were on a time limit. Harry felt like he was intruding, feeling the love and affection the three of them had for each other, so deep and true.
How Harry had forgotten that, he didn’t know. It was a long time ago, but he always knew that kids were observant. That’s how they grow. They watch, and listen, and learn with every single thing adults do. So of course Teddy knew how to stare down someone, or how to communicate well, it was all things he’d learnt from being around a variety of adults at all times.
Ron sighed before he continued. “Harry, for the past 5 or so years, you haven’t lived in Grimmauld Place anymore.” He paused to let Harry process.
Harry couldn’t believe it. He could not believe it. Not only had he forgotten his partner, but his memory loss had taken a toll on someone he cared so deeply for. His mind was racing, and his heart was hurting, yearning for something he didn’t even remember.
Parkinson and Hermione were just watching Ron with a sense of amusement, and Neville and Zabini were just eating, watching everyone with an amused smile.
A single hoot in reply, and Harry knew.
With that, Harry quickly planted a kiss on Malfoy’s cheek.
He just shook his head, and sat down on the free seat beside Neville. Neville greeted him with a smile that Harry returned.
“Congratulations on your wedding, by the way! I am so sorry I don’t remember anything about it.” Harry cringed internally at himself with that fact.
I wrote too much for this chapter so I'm splitting it into two parts. They're both under the same name and for good reason. I hope you enjoy the L E N G T H. (This had little to no editing btw)
Harry then looked at the backyard door, and went to it. He was about to open it when he heard Malfoy’s voice.
Malfoy nodded, and sat back on the other side of the table.
“7th, actually. NEWTs are soon, and I’m still not there yet.”
“Are you sure?”
Harry took that opportunity. “He’s my boyfriend, I can imagine him doing it.”
Malfoy sat down in the seat beside Harry’s bed as the healer ran diagnostics first. This part was his least favourite. The spells would constantly wash over Harry, making him feel like he was in a bubble that kept bursting, yet never went away. Worst of all, he couldn’t speak during the cast.
Harry just kept his mouth shut, he’d already stepped past a lot of Malfoy’s mental sanity checkpoints today. Yet, he knew he was amazed with Malfoy. The completely new Malfoy, miles ahead of the one in his memories.
“No! No,” Harry pleaded. “Bring them there. It’ll be better to get it over with, and it’s a controlled environment anyway, right? I can just floo home if I’m overwhelmed.”
“I’ll have the most expensive slice of cake you have, and he’ll have three of your top choice cookies.” Parkinson told the girl at the register.
Harry, not trusting his voice, slowly nodded. His arm went back to his side, the words slowly drifting out of his mind.
He tries to keep holding on to Hermione’s words. But it’s getting harder and harder with every waking hour.
And just like that, Harry’s body collapses. All the tension, all the tight muscles, the stress and strain, just left. His body slumped into the chair, and he hung his head in shame.
The situation was so eerily similar to that first night he was here. That first day, he’d fallen asleep on the floor and wound up on his bed the next morning. He smacked his lips, realising just how thirsty he was.
Harry helped Hagrid take care of the rest of the animals that accepted their help, and they talked briefly about new things. As they talked, he learnt that Hagrid had started teaching Care of Magical Creatures alongside Professor Grubbly-Plank, who co-taught the subject as Hagrid’s roles in the school became too much. With being gamekeeper, professor, and caretaker of the new endangered animals field, it was no question.
The thoughts from before started to creep in until a loud sob cut through the air.
d it, startling Isolt.
And so it became routine.
Ron and Malfoy were crying outside, comforting each other. There were many moments when Harry realised that this entire situation was real, that everything he’d missed out on was real and not some sick joke. This might’ve been the most intense one yet.
Neville looked at him with an immense amount of pity that Harry wanted to scream into an abyss. “Don’t. Don’t do whatever it is you’re doing. It’ll only make things worse, and you know it.”
“All charms have an essence of magic,” Lavender explained. “Too much magic, and it ruins the evidence. Sometimes it mixes with the lingering bits of magic and nullifies it, other times it makes it stronger and difficult to analyse. Plastics are the best things we can do for now to avoid that.”
“We’ve been worried sick. You’re short replies, coldness in your voice.” Ron said.
“Yes?” There was more hesitance in his voice than expected.
After Harry got his food, Malfoy got his. It was just as silent as the dinner was last night, but it wasn’t tense or uncomfortable. Harry recognised that Malfoy seemed worn out. The kind of worn out that comes after a hard day at work. Harry himself was starting to feel it.
Well, expect for his boss.
It was silent now as Malfoy moved some of the papers around. Harry watched on as he tried to think of what to say. On one hand he wanted to ask about earlier, but he was afraid Malfoy would walk off again. Harry really didn’t want that.
As if he hadn’t been thinking about that the entire day. Like somehow Malfoy was always in the back of his mind, being as grouchy and closed off as he was this morning. Harry picked and prodded at his brain for an answer, but nothing came up.
“Yep, why wouldn’t it be?” Parkinson countered.
Hermione sat down on an empty chair, and motions for Harry to as well. He almost declines, but Hermione says, “You look like you’re able to fall down.”
“I’d love some, thank you.”
He kept his eye contact, and bowed as low as he could. Trying his hardest to remember how it was all that time ago in his own third year Care of Magical Creatures class. But when the majestic creature bowed its head down to Harry, he couldn’t help but celebrate in his mind.
Minerva stopped walking at the top of a hill. The wind was blowing, giving kisses of cold air onto their heated foreheads. Harry stopped beside her, and took in the sight.
Just then, Lara came up, giving the bill and taking their finished food away. The trio split the bill while Ron started a conversation about how confusing muggle money was compared to the 17 sickles for a galleon he was used to.
There was that darkness though. It sat there in his chest, small, but patiently waiting. For Harry, despite loving the sight, was jealous of the old Harry. The Harry that could see a vision and let it come to life as wonderfully as this. Harry now felt like if he tried, he’d fail over and over again.
Someone grabbed his hand, held it tightly, like a lifeline. He tried to grip it back, but nothing was responding. His eyes wouldn’t even open. The pain was taking over, he could feel it. Everything started to get a bit lighter.
He expected a grand welcoming one way or another, but it didn’t happen. The group just nodded, some saying hi, others nodding hello. They were all surrounding the table filled to the brim with food. Malfoy wasn’t kidding when he told Harry not to eat too much leading up to the dinner.
He discovered a lot of things though. Ginny and Luna were married from their matching rings in several photos. Theodore Nott, Neville, and surprisingly Gregory Goyle were in a relationship. Some photos just two would be holding hands, other times kisses on cheeks and winks were captured in the moving photos. He was amazed, but they all looked happy, so he was too.
Lastly, there were the books. His favourite books, and a bunch of new books he wanted to read. There was a moment where he stopped, unsure if it was worth it because maybe he had already read that book. Maybe he already disliked it.
Her head whipped to face him. Eyes slightly teary, but not crying. Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
With a heavy sigh, and a want for communication, he walked down the stairs. He put on the bare minimum into getting ready to see Kingsley, knowing that his clothes would get sweaty anyway, and left the house.
“I do a good thing for you, and you think I’m being selfish? I had a feeling you’d react badly to them if you were surrounded by them, so I packed them. Now here you are, throwing it all back to me.” Malfoy’s voice was like a snake’s hiss, and seemed to weave itself into the walls of the house. “You’re the selfish one.”
He was so close.
Everyone was the same, yet different. A sense of familiarity was the only thing he gained from going through the pictures. His mind couldn’t place it, the reasons or the logic as to why everyone was moving so well together, but he just knew they would.
His throat felt like sandpaper, and his vision blurred with tears. Was he crying? There was too much happening to tell. Harry’s wand was outstretched, pointing at Malfoy who didn’t stop looking at him.
“Not another word out of your mouth about that,” Molly adamanted. “Out of all the things to talk about, it had to be that moment.” She shook her head and starting walking back to the kitchen.
Malfoy continued moving, adding final touches to the dinner. “You thought a lot of things, Harry.” He smiled gently at Harry, then gestured to the plates. “Can you bring those to the table? I won’t be a moment longer.”
Malfoy looked at him and smiled. Then raised an eyebrow in confusion. “Food?” Malfoy mouthed.
“Yeah, you remember that?”
He couldn’t fucking control it. Any of it. It was a desperate plea, a sliver of hope for him. This plan, these performances, it made him feel like he could have it back. At least he was moving. It was better like this than before where he wasted away in his office rereading words of what felt like a stranger.
In the corner was Isolt, a few dead mice in her cage. In the other corner was a table that held a few candles. Harry looked up and almost passed out at what he saw. He’d been sure he’d remember a floating chandelier with lit candles instead of lightbulbs, but no, no it was there and Harry just seemed to completely miss it. Blimey, how oblivious was he?
“Well, I called her like you asked.” Harry started.
It was subtle and if Harry didn’t know to look for it, he wouldn’t have seen it. But he saw them both, their walls slowly crumbling.
Malfoy started shuffling even faster. There were only so many combinations in which the papers could be rearranged. Surely Malfoy had created each one at least twice.
“Did you really think I did?” Malfoy sneered.
Harry could cry. Why couldn't Draco have taken Dumbledore's offer and joined their side? He could've been somewhere else,
wants to be the person who makes Draco better. Who makes Draco
"Not anymore," Harry replies, as he tries to think of ways to get out of the situation. "Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who's lent you theirs?"
Harry doesn't think he's ever been more aware of his heartbeat, as he feels it speeding up and threatening to break out of his chest.
"I just - how do you - er..." Harry tries to find the right words. "Is there an easy way to, well eh, get over someone?"
It's just a few days later that Ginny kisses Harry after a Quidditch victory. It surprises him, but what surprises him the most is how much he actually enjoys it. And maybe it's for the best anyway. Ginny is soft and beautiful, they're already good friends, Ron's okay with it and Ginny is the one person who can actually understand what it's like to have Voldemort inside of your head. Plus, she's not related to any Death Eaters. Things with Malfoy were bound to end badly one way or another anyway.
Now Harry wonders if he should say something to Draco, about Astoria. He doesn’t know what he would say exactly, or even how to approach Draco to begin with, or how to avoid making it awkward and weird. He ends up not mentioning it, silently hoping that Draco is okay.
"What's the matter, Malfoy?" Harry says, quite out of breath himself. "Don't like the fact that
Harry hasn’t talked to Draco since the Battle. Well, he hasn’t
“I loved her as a friend, but nothing more. She knew that.”
"What?" Harry is confused for a moment. Is she talking about Cho Chang? Sure, she's pretty and sure Harry's noticed her, but -
Harry can't move; he's been immobilised. Dumbledore has just wasted his last chance of defending himself to immobilise Harry. Why? Harry struggles hopelessly against the spell, knowing there is no point but not finding it in him to just give up. At least Dumbledore has made sure Harry's protected under his Cloak, so he won't need to defend himself.
"Well, I don't see the point in that." Hermione only shrugs and opens up her book again.
"I swear, I knew how to brew this potion at six years old just from watching my dad!" Malfoy claims with an exasperated tone in his voice."Were you raised in a fucking barn, Potter?"
When he weeks later finds Professor Trelawney claiming to have heard someone - a
It's pitch black with the door closed and he can barely make out Malfoy's face. Malfoy lights his wand and puts it on an empty shelf before he turns to face Harry.
"Get your bloody glasses out of the way, Potter," he says breathlessly and Harry takes them off immediately. Then he tears Malfoy's robes open and attacks his neck; kissing, sucking marks into the pale, sensitive skin and occasionally biting down hard causing Malfoy to shudder. Harry very much enjoys the way he can make his
The door to where the three are standing on the Astronomy tower bursts open suddenly, and Draco's face changes at the sound; hardens. His wand is back up, pointed again at Dumbledore's face with a now somewhat steady hand. But as the other Death Eaters join him, Harry can still see terror in his eyes.
What makes it hard for Harry to let go of the guilt gnawing at his insides is the sight of Draco (
Harry looks up, confused. The usual venom is gone from Malfoy's words, and his expression lacks the sneer that so far has seemed to be glued permanently to his face.
“Come.” Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s left hand and guides him over to a small wooden bench placed along the wall. They sit down in silence and Harry wonders if he should say anything else or if he should leave it up to Draco. Before he can make a decision Draco speaks up.
"Why weren't you?" he asks cautiously. Harry's curious about Draco's background, and he's never really seen this side of him before, but he's worried Draco's going to get angry again.
"Fuck," Harry swears as the potion once again turns a colour that it shouldn't.
Hermione closes her book after finishing the page she was reading and looks up at him. "Don't tell me you need help with your Potions essay?" She sighs. "I thought you and Ron finished it hours ago, you-"
“Tori made me better,” Draco mumbles.
Then Malfoy clears his throat and unlocks the door with his wand. "See you around, Potter." He closes the door behind him, leaving Harry in the dark.
just called a Malfoy hot?"
"We have a lot in common, you know," Draco mumbles.
“Dad!” Harry is pulled from his thoughts as his youngest son comes running back to him right before the train is supposed to leave. “Dad, I need you to take me to Scorpius’ mum’s funeral. I don’t know when it is, I’ll send an owl, but I need you to know that I’m going and I don’t care how much you hate the Malfoys because Scorpius is my friend and he needs me to be there.” The words are falling out of Albus’ mouth in one, rushed sentence, and by the end of it he’s out of breath.
There are tears in Draco’s eyes now, and Harry sits as frozen in the chair listening intently to every word coming out of his mouth. This is not at all what Harry would have expected to hear. But Draco goes on:
someone - gleefully celebrating something in the Room of Requirement, Harry is sure this someone has to be Draco. And he doesn't know whether he should be happy for Draco's sake; clearly he has succeeded in whatever it was he's been trying to do, which hopefully means he will no longer be on Voldemort's hit list; or if he should be worried for his own sake. Worried, or even scared. If Draco's task had really been something that would help Voldemort, Harry could be in danger. Not
As far as funerals go, Harry’s been to plenty. After the war there had been many casualties, and he had been determined to attend each one. Some - most - of them had just been a memorial service without the burial, since there was no body to bury. And every single one had been equally painful, whether Harry had known the person now dead or not, because they all took him back. Back to the war, back to losing everyone he did know and love, back...
Harry wants to puke. This isn't fair to Draco. He's only a child, just like Harry. And Harry knows what it's like to be pushed into situations where you have to act even though you might not want to. But for Harry it had still always been an easy choice. He had fought for the good. He had fought the very people who started the war, the people who killed his parents, and Sirius. He would always be known as a hero. But Draco? Neither choice is an easy one to make for him. One would mean he would be not only disowned by his parents, but hunted down by the currently most dangerous wizard in the world and most likely killed along with his family. The other would mean he's a killer. A cold-blooded killer who might spent the rest of his life in Azkaban, and hated by everyone. Remembered not as a hero, but as a villain. As the boy who murdered Dumbledore.
Harry wants to reach out to Draco. He wants to reinforce Dumbledore's words, to reassure Draco that he can be okay. He wants to scream at him to accept the help he's being offered, he wants to take Draco's wand away from him, to hold him and wipe his tears and...
"Yeah, well, where are
And then there's a loud noise from behind the door, startling the group. Harry looks over and sees someone entering through the doorway - Snape.
“Jerk.” Draco follows. “Let’s go find the boys.”
“She was such a good person, and she deserved so much better. I just wanted you to know that.. well that I… It was never like that, with her. I don’t really, with women, like… at all.” he’s looking down at his hands, his leg bouncing up and down. “I needed you to know.”
is making you cum?"
Harry only catches one last glimpse of Draco's face - now showing a mix of fear, relief and sadness - before he disappears with the other Death Eaters. Harry feels the spell being lifted off his body, and he immediately sets off after them.
to give them up, he doesn't
That's what he'd said. Whatever it is Malfoy is up to, it doesn't seem like he wants to do it. He still isn't saying anything, so Harry decides to take a risk. He moves closer to Malfoy and puts an arm around him.
, Harry thinks. “Yeah?” He replies out loud.
"You- what?" Malfoy looks taken aback at Harry's statement about the cupboard. "You're not serious?"
given Harry detention when McGonagall shows up. She's also seen what happened, and demands that Snape gives Malfoy the same punishment for something they were both involved in. Snape can't go directly against another teacher, so he's forced to do what McGonagall says. Harry's very amused at first - for once Malfoy won't get away with his shit like he always does - but then Snape says they'll be in detention
"C-Crabbe...Crabbe," he stutters in between coughs.
and Malfoy's lips are exactly as soft as Harry thought they'd be. Harry is pretty sure he's the one who initiated the kiss - something like he grabbed Malfoy by his robes and slammed their lips together. It's heated and forceful, but it isn't one-sided - Malfoy is definitely kissing Harry back. When they pull apart, gasping for breaths, Malfoy smirks at Harry.
“Uh, no, of course not,” Harry responds shaking his head in an attempt to clear his mind. “Sorry.”
Draco is standing in front of Dumbledore - some distance away, but with his wand raised and pointed straight at him. The conversation between the two is surprisingly light, Dumbledore calmly speaking to Draco about what he's done, praising him even. Draco has found a way to let Death Eaters into the castle... Had that been his task?
Harry rubs his eyes tiredly underneath his glasses and lets out a small sigh. “Look. I’m exhausted right now, but let’s take tomorrow off from work and we’ll go have coffee - I know a place where we won’t be bothered. Then we can talk. How’s that?”
Ron and Crabbe are running towards them, away from a roaring fire which seems to have appeared out of nowhere. It quickly becomes apparent, though, that it's Crabbe who's caused the flames to erupt from his wand - evidently without thinking about how it might affect himself and his friends as well. He seems to have no control over the fire, and Harry's attempt to extinguish it with Augamenti seems pathetic. The only thing they can do is run, so they do. The fire keeps spreading; chasing Harry, Ron and Hermione through the maze of junk. Harry had seen Draco grab the Stunned Goyle before joining their sprint away from the fire, but now he's nowhere to be seen. The three must've been separated from Harry and the others somewhere along the way.
anything." Harry snorts. As if it did for him. "But I haven't gotten laid in a while," Malfoy continues, "and you seem willing enough." He smirks at him again.
Soon Draco calms himself, frees himself from Harry’s grip, wipes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Then he clears his throat and mumbles out a small “I’m sorry.”
Had he been talking about Voldemort? What if Draco did die and it was Harry's fault? His fault for not stopping Draco in time, for not figuring out this secret mission Draco seems to be on, his fault... Draco had been forced into this, after all. With his father being a Death Eater, the whole family of Malfoy a group of pureblood Slytherin maniacs, with no one to guide him out; steer him right. Voldemort is
Draco didn't kill Dumbledore.
"What is it you have to do?" Harry asks, for what feels like the millionth time, thinking that he's finally going to get an answer.
“I never should have told you that story,” Harry tries to give Draco an angry look, and hits him playfully on the arm before bursting out in laughter. Draco joins him, and Harry is thinking that it was a long time since it had been this easy between them, if ever. Draco even looks happy, relaxed, less reserved than usual. Maybe they could become friends again. Maybe.
"Well," Malfoy says after a moment of awkward silence. "I think I have to take 5 points from Gryffindor just for wasting my time." He smirks.
this is a short one
where sectumsempra never happens
Draco shrugs. “It’s not like I was innocent. I should’ve known better. I was so nasty to so many people. I still feel guilty for it everyday.”
He scowls at the mental image of that. What would he do exactly? Run up to Malfoy after potions and shout loud enough for everyone to hear
"Wow," Harry rolls his eyes. "I only said you were good, not
Sorry for the long ass wait! (and for this short chapter...)
OKAY PLS
Draco laughs a little. "Yeah," he says. "Everyone always does. Living in a big house, with a well-connected father and lots of money - how could I not be happy?"
As if he's not catching enough looks already.
he's caught Malfoy's attention. Although it's not exactly positive attention, it's attention nonetheless. Damn, Harry is starting to get a little too obsessed.
I'm working and studying and battling depression still so it's been kind of hard to find the time to write. I have also recently moved so that's taken up some time as well. Hope you like the new chapter, feel free to give me feedback even if it's negative!!
“I want you to know,” Harry says after swallowing, “that I forgave you a long time ago.” He pauses for a second before continuing. “Even back at school, during our sixth year, I started viewing you more as a complex person. When you’re a kid, everything is so black and white. You had been mean to me, therefore you were a bad person. Obviously that isn’t necessarily the case. When you first talked to me about your upbringing is when I started seeing the bigger picture. That there were reasons behind your actions. It can’t have been easy for you.”
stuff, it's
Harry turns to face Malfoy. "What do you want? You can't take any points from me as I'm not doing anything wrong, and if you think you can try to get a reaction from me - you're mistaken."
He didn't do it.
Harry meets his eyes and sees a hesitant expression on Draco’s face. They’re both quiet for a bit before Draco speaks again. “I mean… Being your friend is kind of all I ever wanted. I saw the friendship between you, Weasley and Granger and I.. I guess I was jealous.” He takes a sip of his coffee and Harry mirrors him subconsciously, picking up his own mug.
Malfoy bites his lip as if he's concentrating on something, and it really just makes Harry want to kiss him. "Maybe I'm just bored," Malfoy finally says.
"Oh that's right, I forgot, you're taking
Harry thinks it's over, Draco is going to do it. He wishes he could close his eyes...
One day in Potions class, Harry notices something. Almost everyone is off taking their Apparition test, so it's just Harry, Malfoy and Ernie Macmillan in class. This gives Harry a better opportunity to stare at Malfoy without having to worry about anyone noticing, and what Harry realises worries him. Malfoy looks paler; his skin still has that greyish tinge, probably because he so rarely sees daylight these days. But there is no air of smugness, or excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort... Harry doesn't know why this bothers him so much. Surely it's a good thing, given that it probably means Malfoy still isn't succeeding with his mission. Harry's been trying to get Malfoy to tell him what it is whenever the two are alone, but so far he's had no luck. There is just something about seeing Malfoy being so...
Draco bites his lip. “Okay,” he says.
"That's not true." Harry frowns. "I didn't start hating you until you insulted Ron, the first kid I'd ever met who was nice to me."
It's Snape, of course, that gives Harry detention for what feels like the hundredth time. Only, this time, it will be even worse because
and having Malfoy thinking he's taking extra Potions lessons makes him feel even worse.
"Pansy?" Malfoy laughs at Harry like he's an idiot. "Pansy's not my
"Fuck," Malfoy breathes. They're both close, so close, and then - way too soon in Harry's opinion - it's over. They stand still for a second, catching their breaths before Harry steps away and Malfoy takes out his wand to clean up. They put their clothes back on in an awkward silence. Harry doesn't know what to say, or if he even should say anything.
"Not that they're much better themselves," Malfoy continues, probably just trying to stir up Harry's temper. "Mudbloods and blood traitors - I'll never understand why you keep such lousy company."
Harry rolls his eyes. "Whatever."
Harry wishes he could rest. That he could grab Draco's hand and lay down somewhere soft and clean. To cool off from the burning hot fire and suffocating smoke, to heal and rest and recharge. He wants to tell Draco it's going to be okay, and he wants to mean it. Wants to be able to mean it... But there is no point in wishing for things like that. Because the battle isn't over yet. Voldemort is still alive, Nagini is still alive, and the Death Eaters seem to have entered the castle.
“Yeah,” Albus’ tone softens, and he sighs a little. “I just found out.”
"I'm talking about Parkinson, you prat."
Harry shakes his head and grabs Draco’s hands in his own. “Don’t.” He hesitates, “Look. I know I might not be the one you would want to talk to about all this, but I am here if you need me. Okay?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes at him. "Come on, how hard can it be?" he says with a condescending voice as he works with the potion to fix Harry's mistake."It's only a Sleeping Draught, Potter."
The task is done, but without Draco having to live with the guilt of killing another person. Without that one act to taint his soul for the rest of his life.
When Dumbledore offers Draco their help, Harry feels relief flooding through him. Draco could join their side, he would be okay, and Dumbledore would be alive. He wants to hug Dumbledore, to thank him for being ready to forgive Draco and help him move on... But these feelings are cut short only a moment later with Draco's reply.
oh also an important thing!! I know this is supposed to be canon compliant but i just couldn't bring myself to let the sectumsempra thing happen... i know it fucks with the whole hbp plot but... ignore that. this is what i wished could've happened instead, i guess.
“You’ve been quiet for a while now,” Draco says, pulling Harry out of his thoughts. “Did I say something wrong?”
There isn't even the smallest trace of happiness in Draco's face right now. His eyes look empty, hollow; and the bags under them deeper than ever. His skin is almost paler than usual and he's become thinner, causing his cheekbones to be even more prominent. It makes Harry want to take him into his arms and comfort him. Even though really, in the current situation, it is
to him, for real. He’s run into him, of course, at the Platform 9 ¾ and at work, but they haven’t exchanged anything more than distanced polite phrases.
They're just about to get physical, which sadly doesn't go unnoticed by Snape. He's just taken points from Gryffindor,
Having completely abandoned the task of getting the diadem, Harry swoops down low towards the two Slytherins. Draco sees him coming and raises his one free arm towards Harry. Harry attempts to help them up onto his broom, but it's too hard with Goyle being stunned. Thankfully Ron and Hermione are coming to help, and together they drag Goyle onto their broom while Draco climbs up behind Harry. Harry's mind blanks for a split second as Draco's arms wrap around his waist and their bodies are suddenly pressed together.
instead of being here, alone and in danger, living in a constant state of fear.
Maybe Harry's just feeling lonely. Having broken up with Ginny and then spent months with only Ron and Hermione for company has made him long for something, someone. Seeing Ron and Hermione together, sharing that connection, that closeness... Falling asleep holding hands, knowing that the one person they care so much about is right there with them... Harry wants that, too.
“I love you!” Harry calls after him and as a response he gets a wave over the shoulder.
Harry's too caught up in the previous change in Malfoy's behaviour to feel angry or upset at his words. There had been something in his eyes - pity? Understanding? Is it possible that there is another person underneath all of Malfoy's nasty exterior? Harry shakes his head and silently puts his focus back on the potion in front of him again. He's probably just imagining things.
to be better.
The others are urging Draco to have a closer look, to confirm that it really is Potter they've caught. Draco steps a little closer and looks at Harry's face. Harry can see a mix of reluctance and fear in Draco's eyes, but despite Bellatrix and the others egging him on, he doesn't give Harry away.
, Harry can tell. Draco doesn't
Harry thinks,
Harry sits down next to her. "Er- can I ask you something?"
"Oh," a look of understanding shows on Hermione's face. "it's about you fancying Cho?"
"I don't know, Harry," she says with a small smile. "Sometimes you just have to wait it out, I'm afraid." The flicker of hope Harry had had that his crush would be over soon goes out at her words. "Although," she continues, "you could try confronting her, I suppose. I know she was with Cedric, but I've seen her look at you when you're not noticing. You never know - she could feel the same way."
And the next thing Harry knows, they're Disapparating.
"Easy for you to say!" Harry exclaims before he can stop himself.
friends then?" Harry replies, and he's surprised by how normal their conversation is compared to their usual bickering. "Or your girlfriend who's always trailing after you like a lost puppy?"
"My mother." Draco won't meet Harry's eyes.
A battle ensues: with Draco hiding due to him being unable to fight back wandless and Hermione finally hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell taking him out of the equation for now. Harry is refocusing on the very reason they are even in here to begin with: the diadem. He starts to tell Hermione to look for it while he tries to help Ron with duelling Crabbe, but is interrupted before he's finished the sentence.
Not all memories are good ones, and the most painful one of them all is the memory of Draco smiling. Glimpses of him laughing with his friends in the Great Hall; smiling to himself as he gets back his Potions grade; giggling with Pansy, drunk on firewhiskey and butterbeer.
Harry feels lost. Betrayed. Abandoned.
Harry comes face to face with Draco again, but can't even talk to him
"Fuck off," Malfoy snaps at him, but Harry doesn't mind; he's eager, too. In a moment their robes are on the floor, and their trousers around their ankles, as Harry fucks Malfoy against the wall.
"Just, I always thought Snape only favoured you because you're a Slytherin, but you're actually really good at this and it pisses me off," Harry glances up at Malfoy, who's frowning. "Never mind," he adds with a sigh.
Draco shrugs. "Lots of things. My father, for one. I have always looked up to him, always wanted to make him proud, but he's never been particularly nice to me. It was lonely, growing up, I don't have any siblings, nor did I have any friends as there weren't many kids around. Dad always worked a lot, and Mum too. Mostly the only company I had were the house elves, and they were scared of me." Harry is starting to realise what Draco had meant by them being similar. No friends, no company or kindness during the earlier years of their lives.
“So, uh,” he starts, then silently scolds himself for sounding like an idiot. “Well, I guess I just wanted to tell you that if you ever need anything I’m here for you and you are not alone. I know we’ve never been that close but you’re a good guy and I’d like to be your friend if you’d let me,” he finishes, still feeling awkward since he genuinely doesn’t have a clue how Draco will respond. He keeps his eyes fixed on his hands in his lap while awaiting an answer, scared to look up.
Harry lets go of Draco’s hand as soon as their feet find solid ground. He’s Apparated them both into an alley of the street where the café they’re going to is located. Draco had been right, their destination is a cozy little muggle place that Harry comes to whenever he misses his parents. The staff is polite and friendly but mostly leaves him alone, and no one here recognizes his face or knows who he is. He likes it, the anonymity. Plus they have the best scones.
At least, Draco didn't have to become a killer.
Draco scoffs. “Well it sure feels like it.”
"There," Harry starts, but he doesn't get to continue as Malfoy has tackled him on to the floor, attempting to get his wand back. "Hey, what the hell!" Harry exclaims in surprise, and keeps a tight grip on both of their wands. Malfoy lifts his hand in a fist, and Harry can tell he's about to punch him in the face. In a last, desperate attempt to stop him, Harry speaks again.
responsibility. It's Harry's job to kill him. If he doesn't, and Voldemort ends up killing Draco it would definitely be Harry's fault.
“Sorry,” Harry says.
Draco shakes his head and laughs a little, but when he speaks his tone is flat. “Isn’t it obvious?” he asks.
“Astoria didn’t mind marrying me as a friend. She already knew she was sick, and didn’t want to waste her last years looking for something she might never find. She reassured me over and over that she was happy with her decision, that she loved me and that she wanted to have a child with me as a way to make sure she was remembered after she passed.”
“Oh, um…” Draco looks confused and… disappointed? “Right now?” he asks timidly.
"Make me," Malfoy challenges. Harry's first thought is to take out his wand and cast a Silencing Charm on him, but he quickly realises that probably isn't what Malfoy intended. Instead he walks closer to the Slytherin and pushes him back against the wall while starting to kiss him again. Harry is surprised to hear Malfoy moan under his lips, and decides he's being too gentle. He presses Malfoy harder against the wall, grabbing his waist. Malfoy puts his hands on Harry's chest and shoves him, just hard enough for their lips to be forced apart.
"Oh, fuck off," Harry says. "Don't act like you didn't enjoy it."
somehow, it suits him so much better. Instead of pushing him away, like Harry had expected, Draco puts his arms around Harry and hides his face in Harry's neck. Harry can feel Draco's tears running down his own skin, but he really couldn't care less. He just holds the broken boy in his arms tighter and strokes his hair.
he's gained a lot more supporters,
When Harry's on his way back to the Gryffindor common room one night, after Umbridge's interrogation about Sirius and Dumbledore's locations, he runs into Malfoy. He doesn't want to deal with him right now, but there's only a straight corridor ahead and no way to avoid the Slytherin coming his way.
"I...maybe...yeah," he mumbles. Poor, sweet Draco. Harry can't help but feel overwhelmed with sympathy towards him. Draco is trying, he's trying
"So how come you three aren't with Voldemort?" Harry is just stalling for time, hoping that Ron and Hermione will join him soon, or that he can keep the three Slytherins in front of him distracted while he slowly starts moving towards the tiara.
“I think I will manage.” Draco smirks before adding: “That is, of course, unless Albus has inherited your inability to speak clearly. But that is something you can’t blame me for!”
They attend Astoria's funeral and there is a conversation.
“Well I guess I can trust you to Floo them back to Hogwarts safely tomorrow morning?” Harry jokes, wanting to keep the mood light.
Harry laughs and shakes his head, and even Draco is smiling a little. They sit in silence for a bit longer, looking at each other and smiling, both trying to come up with something new to say.
Harry returns from his Horcrux hunting trip with Dumbledore, and finally learns about the task Draco was given by Voldemort.
always demanding your attention. But now - next to his father, mother and the rest of the Death Eaters - he looks lost. He looks tiny, lost and frightened. Less like he wants to be the centre of attention, and more like he wants nothing but to fade into the background, to hide in the shadows, to disappear.
that makes him feel uneasy. It's not like Harry actually
“I loved her.”
"It's okay," Harry replies quickly, not wanting him to stop talking. "I'm not going to tell anyone if you don't want me to. I'll just listen."
Spoonful by spoonful Draco calms down. This feels oddly
to stay on the ship.’ He locked eyes with Harry and smiled in a provocative way that had Harry’s blood roaring. ‘You can’t imagine how grateful. In fact,' he smiled and slid on the floor between Harry's legs, leaving him breathless, 'why don't I show you?'
He and Draco picked fallen branches as they followed the path along an avenue of beech trees. ‘We need to talk,’ Harry told him.
‘Too far.’ Draco shoves him against the wall in the hallway under a silver snake candelabra. ‘I can’t wait.’ He kneels, yanks Harry’s jeans down his thighs, and mouths on Harry’s cock through his boxers. ‘I want you right—'
‘They’re not Muggles. Look.’ Draco pointed at the broomsticks leaning against the nearest caravan.
A man in a grey trilby with a blue kerchief tied around his neck detached himself from the others. Harry guessed him to be in his early forties. Deep crows’ feet creased his face, which was twisted in a scowl. ‘Seems like we have some visitors.’ He spoke to the crowd as well as the two of them.
‘There are three special bells that ring at the exact moment of the royal consummation.’
‘That’s quite alright,’ she smiled. She turned down Malfoy’s offer of a handful of galleons. ‘I have no need for gold. I’d be grateful if you helped Dawn with some chores, though. Also, do you boys know anything about plumbing?’
The bouquets combined wildflowers (bluebells and bugle and cow-wheat) with some fern leaves and weeds and a magpie feather, tied with a long piece of grass. They were pretty, but strange: just like Draco.
‘What’s it about?’
‘You look the same, Weasley,’ Draco drawls, and somehow that has everyone laughing again.
Flushed and wide-eyed, Harry stared. Draco frowned. Hermione coughed.
Malfoy shuffled a little. ‘It’s all about the wand. You were raised by Muggles, you have no idea. No wand means you’re more useless than flobberworms. Did you hear what Aunt Bella said to my father? That he lost his authority when he lost his wand?
Dawn hadn’t broken yet and the night was full of the sounds of the woods outside and the creaks of the old, groaning house. In the half-light of the waning moon, Harry stared transfixed at the blond head in front of him. Draco’d let his hair grow this year. It brushed his ears and covered his eyes and now it fanned on the pillow; liquid silver on blue cotton. Soft strands moved with Harry’s exhales.
‘I think so. I assume the people that were similar to real life were those who are happy here. Which means my parents’ deepest desire…’
. Super helpful, wouldn’t have thought of it myself.’ Draco flicks his wand, murmuring a spell his mother used to cast for him before bedtime. The spell tints the air with shades of blue that change from violet to turquoise depending on the temperature of the air currents. In high-ceilinged rooms, like his bedroom at the Manor, there were a dozen hues, shimmering and shifting from the slightest draught from the windows or the heat from the fire. Here the effect isn’t as impressive, but it’s pretty. It’s like they’re floating in an iridescent violet sky with veins of blue running into it. Harry adds a
The next day, Harry is frustrated to realise that shagging Malfoy wasn't enough to satisfy him and take the stupid attraction away, it rather seems to be the opposite - now he wants more. Luckily enough for him, Malfoy seems to be thinking the same thing. They keep up this bizarre hate-fucking relationship for weeks. It isn't really that hard, they keep up the fighting and the hating each other, especially when they're around other people, and only if they find themselves alone they'll take advantage of the situation. Works for Harry.
“Are you okay?”
Harry has always felt drawn to Draco Malfoy, in a way he can't quite explain. He always seems to find an excuse to talk to him, or rather, yell at him. That's what they do - they fight, they scream, they insult, threaten and hex each other. But if Harry's being honest with himself, he wouldn't know what to do without Malfoy. He hates the bloke, sure, and he would like nothing more than to punch him right in his stupid face when he starts attacking Ron and Hermione, but he provides entertainment. Harry can always count on Malfoy to keep him busy when he's bored.
Draco clears his throat and runs his hand through his hair. “I... You.. What happened, at Hogwarts, you know, between us,” he seems to be struggling to find the words, and Harry has no idea what Draco’s about to tell him.
Harry blinks at him. “Astoria passed?” No wonder Draco had seemed a little off at work.
Harry flinches a bit at the mention of Cedric, but considers Hermione's words.
and hope that would do it
Harry can feel that Malfoy is hard against him. "Eager, are you?" he murmurs.
Harry is beyond grateful, he knows how much strength it must take for Draco to lie to his father like this. Draco's eyes linger on Harry's for just a second, and Harry can't help but remember all of their moments together. He faintly recalls the feeling of Draco's soft lips on his skin, his strong arms wrapped around Harry, the taste of him, the sounds he made... He represses a shudder at the thoughts.
Harry asks himself.
“It was a beautiful ceremony.” Harry speaks with a low voice as he approaches Draco from behind. Harry had been watching him the entire time, and Draco hadn’t cried. He’d held his son and whispered a goodbye to Astoria’s casket, but he hadn’t shed a single tear as far as Harry had seen. After the ceremony Harry followed him into a small back room and now, as he turns around at the sound of Harry’s voice, his eyes are red and his cheeks are wet with tears. Instinctively Harry takes the two steps he needs to be able to wrap his arms around the other man, and hugs him tightly as Draco helplessly sobs into Harry’s shoulder.
adding the Sopophorous bean, damn it!" He's managed to push Harry's hands away from the cauldron, but in doing so the chopped up Sopophorous bean has fallen from Harry's hands and onto the floor. Malfoy sighs.
Draco is looking rather nervous and uncomfortable, dressed in muggle clothing at Harry’s demand. It doesn’t matter whether people know who they are or not if he’s walking in there with bright green wizard’s robes - that’s bound to draw some attention. Draco is hanging behind letting Harry go first, almost like he’s hiding behind him, and Harry finds this very amusing. He orders at the counter for the both of them and goes to find a table in the back, Draco trailing behind him a little lost.
"Only in private, I assume?" he says in a lighter tone.
Harry's in his sixth year now, and has spent the entire time back at Hogwarts obsessing over Malfoy. He is
Draco glances up a Harry, and then he continues. "At first I didn't understand why you didn't like me. I just wanted to be friends, and you rejected me. But as I've watched you over the years, I get it. I realised not everyone thinks the way my father does. But it wasn't as if I could just change. I'm a coward, I couldn't stand up to my dad, or anyone. So I kept it up. And I'm sorry." Harry realises his eyes are watery after listening to Draco talking.
“Because that’s when you wake up?” Draco teases.
"Well- er, yeah," Harry says, for he doesn't know what else to do.
But as Bellatrix refocuses her attention on Hermione, and once again asks
A smiliar reply comes when he's asked about Ron: "Yeah, it could be..."
"I'm sorry," Harry says in a low voice. He isn't sure what he's apologising for exactly, but he hates everything that just happened. For some reason his heart breaks seeing Malfoy so upset.
Harry can't help but smile.
He'd only asked her to the Yule Ball last year because he didn't really have anyone else to ask. He realises that it's a perfect cover-up, though, since Hermione guessed it herself it won't be too forced. "Oh, yeah... Yeah, I suppose," he adds quickly, to cover up his previous question. Hermione's extremely good at reading people, but Harry hopes she'll only take his slight confusion for awkward nervousness.
"I don't even know why I'm telling you this," Draco says with a sigh.
in any classes he shares with Slytherin. Perhaps it had only been Harry's imagination, but he could've sworn that over the past few weeks of them being "friends" - or at the very least
Harry saves Draco's life without hesitating
Harry feels something stirring up inside of him at that. Old feelings that haven’t resurfaced in a long time, feelings Harry didn’t know still existed. He suddenly feels like
groan in pleasure and smirks into Malfoy's neck.
Draco clears his throat again and continues with a somewhat steady voice. “I don’t know what to say to Scorpius. I don’t know how to raise him alone. I don’t know how to be his dad and his mum. I don’t-” his voice falters mid-sentence and he stays quiet, seemingly fighting back more tears.
Dumbledore greets the new addition of people, and meanwhile all Harry can think of is Draco. Draco had referred to himself as a coward. And if he truly believes that, he isn't going to be able to resist the pressure that is on him to finish what he's started. Especially now with more people on his side, egging him on, telling him to hurry, taunting him...
Draco looks up for a second, meeting Harry’s eyes quickly before looking down at their feet again.
"Bet you think I had a great childhood." Draco says quietly.
"I can't do it... " Harry can hear him quietly whispering to himself in a shaky voice. "I can't. It wont work and unless I do it soon...he says he'll kill me..." As Malfoy's voice breaks, Harry realises with a shock so huge it seems to root him to the spot, that Malfoy is crying - actually crying - tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. He gasps and gulps and then, with a great shudder, he looks up into the cracked mirror and sees Harry staring at him over his shoulder. Malfoy wheels around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulls out his own. But his intentions aren't to curse Malfoy, seeing him cry makes Harry feel sad himself. Somehow, it makes him want to comfort Malfoy until he's smiling again. Harry frowns at these thoughts, they don't make any sense. Before he has time to say or do anything, though, Malfoy has sent a curse his way. Harry manages to avoid it just in time, but Malfoy sends another. Harry blocks them all, not wanting to hex Malfoy back. He decides to try talking him out of it instead.
The guttering light deepens the wrinkles around her eyes when she laughs. ‘You won’t win it. But you will pay it back. In a week.’
She frowned as she gazed at them. ‘I say we feed them and then we decide. They look half-starved.’
‘Revenge for what? For beating me at Quidditch today?’
Potter pursed his lips tight. ‘I thought that after—’
Malfoy flinched. A step backwards brought him almost to the edge. ‘Careful!’ Harry blurted out, as some gravel fell off the cliff and disappeared in the yawning darkness. Malfoy hurried away from the edge, and Harry, holding the dagger high, retreated towards the slope behind him, eager to put some distance between the two of them, and
That statement drove pretty much every thought of fathers and disappointments and childhood games from Harry’s mind, replacing them with barely restrained desire. They remained gazing at each other, a slew of memories bringing heat to Harry’s cheeks; a corresponding flush warmed Draco’s face. He licked his lips, letting his eyes slide luxuriously up and down Harry, the little
Esther must have been thinking along those lines. ‘Do you worry the bad men you told me about will find you here?’ She patted his arm. ‘It’s the middle of nowhere.’
here.’ Malfoy swallowed, as if it pained him to use Harry’s given name.
Draco leaned closer, fingers digging hard in Harry’s chest, his voice almost a hiss as he said, ‘
‘When I find my friends,’ Harry insisted, ‘I’ll borrow a wand and come here to cast a protective spell. It’s only a few more days, and you said that Rookwood was useless.’
Draco gathered his clothes and left the room, his back straight as a rod, and Harry punched the pillow. For a second there, he’d been tempted to lean in Draco’s touch, to let him run his fingers through Harry’s hair and maybe pull him closer, face to face… Harry couldn’t allow Draco to know how much he was beginning to affect him.
you.’
, only you.’ He clasped Draco’s palm tight in his and Draco thrust faster, unable to hold himself back. By the time he came, they were both incoherent.
Draco’s shaken by his visit. The fact that one more person from the magical world knows where he lives is only partly why. The main reason for this unstable feeling comes from having someone like Potter — lauded and celebrated, powerful, famous — come to apologise to someone like him.
The dead were living here, because it was someone in the real world’s deepest desire. Vincent’s whole family had died in the final battle; there was no one to wish him alive. Draco clutched his fork, his eyes stinging with the memory of his former friend. He’d have liked to see him again, even after everything.
‘I’m going to head back down.’ Draco walked to the door, but Harry called behind him.
The tension dissipated as the two in the living room, their profiles cast in sharp relief by the spring daylight, faced each other in silence. The tall one hunched, as if unable to hold his pain inside; the tiny one, leaning on her cane but erect, reached out to Draco, her big heart making her look a giant. Harry was about to leave his spot to avoid getting caught by Draco — Dawn had given him a look when she passed on her way to the kitchen — when Draco spoke again.
The four Death Eaters gathered around the walkie-talkie and peered down that street. ‘They’ve gone that way,’ Avery said.
’ Harry hissed, lowering the wand.
Draco would have to do some more research in the library, but he now firmly believed he was in a world created by the Mirror of Erised, a world which manifested everyone’s deepest desires. He had Harry (and no Mark), Pansy had Blaise, Skeeter was in charge of all the press, Weasley was Head Boy, and —
‘I don’t hate you,’ Harry said with conviction. There were worse monsters in the world than Draco Malfoy.
‘All I want,
.’ He paused, eyes on the horizon, still looking proud. ‘I blend
He’s not sure how this is happening, this easy-going chattiness with someone he hasn’t seen in years, someone who stood on the opposite side of a battlefield not that long ago. Or perhaps five years
Harry sat heavily beside him, driving his despondency away. ‘I’m limping and it’s your fault.’
For all their poise and arrogance, for all their vanity and talk of great deeds, the Malfoys scurried out of the room in an undignified haste, and Voldemort would laugh at their blatant cowardice if he hadn’t been simmering with rage and frustration. He paced past the shattered chandelier until Rookwood and Dolohov came and kneeled at his feet.
Potter leaves the book and reaches for the tray. ‘Thanks. I
It’s over.
‘What are you looking for?’ Harry asked, but Draco shook his head quickly.
Harry could hope that Rookwood and Dolohov had been stupid enough to use up the few drops he’d left behind, but that’s not how his life went so far. Besides, if Bellatrix was involved— Harry shivered. The woman scared him more than any other Death Eater; she was as intelligent as she was ruthless.
mirror-self was
to it: one of those strange realities that wizards sometimes found themselves in, because of time malfunctioning. He’d read a novel like that once. He’d always assumed it was fiction, but now he was reconsidering.
The door opens and Draco lifts his head, all thoughts of his aunt fleeing his mind. Harry walks in with a tray of sandwiches, shirtless, his jeans unbuttoned and hanging so low on his hips that Draco can see his pubes. Harry’s glistening with sweat, exuding a post-orgasmic glow, loose-limbed and soft. He looks debauched, well-fucked, absolutely pornographic, like a whore that could demand a kingdom’s ransom. Desire drives all thoughts from Draco’s mind, and he sits up.
‘How dare you paint me as a self-righteous—’
When she left, Harry cast a last glance at the cottage. The light on the ground floor winked out. The trees rustled over his head and the darkness was snug as a blanket around them. At the end of this path, the magical world beckoned.
‘That’s why they had the milk outside,’ Harry mused later, hoovering the carpet on the first floor.
‘So? They can come through and see me. Here is better anyway. People are happy and—’ he tried to fight Potter off, who had a surprisingly strong grip, ‘people are
‘Disillusioned, most likely,’ said the short wizard.
He could picture the scene: holding hands in the middle of a quiet lane, snow falling soft around them, Potter’s cheeks pink with cold, their breaths fogging in front of them… He’d dreamed of this fantasy more times than he cared to admit.
‘Nah,’ Ron shrugged. ‘Well… sometimes I gag him. I’m the only one who talks.’
He made to leave, but Harry caught him again. ‘Your parents are waiting on the other side. Don’t you want to see them?’
‘Find them,’ the cold voice said. ‘Find them and bring them both to me alive.’
They cleaned themselves with Salazar’s scarf, which he then discarded on the ground. Salazar remained looking at it, thoughtful and solemn, and Harry wished once again for light so he could read his expression. He held Salazar close and kissed him softly, and Salazar responded, cupping Harry’s cheek.
. You make me want to
‘Well,’ Malfoy says, glancing at Harry and back at the painting. ‘I’d invite you now.’
‘You… had left…’ Draco writhed below him.
‘Harry? Harry!’
Why should it have been
Exchanging a glance with Draco, Harry said, ‘I’m fine now.’
Draco had finally gone insane. This was a hallucination of epic proportions, and he jerked away, only to stumble in the curtains and knock his head on the bed post. Darkness came upon him swiftly.
Which no one of the living had managed to do. He shouldn’t be surprised that Dumbledore’s
Malfoy looks entirely unconcerned as he takes a seat, pulls his perfectly normal pint to himself, and takes a sip. His eyes land on Harry, full of mischief.
‘—knew better?’
dare to show who he is. He’s a Creature, not even fully human; a monster, a demon, a liar, and he doesn’t deserve Harry.
‘Very funny.’ Harry punched his arm, annoyed — but also relieved — and got out of bed. His face heated up as he stood starkers by the side of the bed. Presenting himself in the nude to Draco’s interested gaze felt more daring in the daylight. He dressed swiftly, and Draco’s expression changed. He turned his back and rummaged for his own clothes.
‘I’ll bring you some ale then.’
Harry sat up so he could slide under the covers next to Draco and laid his head on the pillow with a sigh of relief. He narrated his vision while Draco snuggled close, clutching Harry’s arm as if he was about to bolt out of the door. When he finished, he curled towards Draco, inhaling his scent. It soothed him.
‘Perhaps. Or perhaps he decided to aid Potter.’
! Come
‘Well, well,
Draco also experienced the unfamiliar but rather delightful sensation of being loved, not just by Harry, but by the whole school. Sure, he’d been popular in Slytherin, but the levels of adoration he enjoyed now reached soaring heights. Deep down, he knew he didn’t deserve any praise; but as the days passed, the real world became distant.
‘Yes, of course,’ Draco bleated.
Draco nodded. He offered his hand, and Harry cradled it. Long, elegant fingers, trimmed nails and a tiny mole between index and middle finger; a secret detail Harry had never dreamed he'd discover. He felt Draco’s eyes on him and had to concentrate to make sure his grip was steady. His fingers traced the fleshy part of Draco’s palm entirely of their own volition.
‘Shh. Sleep now.’ Harry threaded his fingers through Draco’s hair, relishing the intimacy, the warmth, the companionship. That they could touch like this, not just with desperate, lustful caresses in the night. That he could press his nose in Draco’s hair and let the softness of it tickle his face.
‘I’ll have you know you’re wrong. Cornwall is beautiful.’
Draco had thought long and hard about the Mirror Pansy. ‘You were fearless.’
‘Oh?’ was all Draco managed to say.
?’ His voice dripped with mockery.
‘Not anymore.’
Draco's whole body

The evidence of Harry’s arousal bobbed between them, flushed and red and unavoidable.
The selfish part of Harry rejoiced the fact he wouldn’t carry on alone just yet. That he’d have Draco at his side, like now. They were both leaning against the stone fence, looking at each other.
Draco hesitated. But he met Harry’s eyes and finally nodded.
you?’
. A formidable weapon to defeat such a ruthless wizard as you are, isn’t it?’
. He’d had fantasies about Cedric and Bill Weasley in the past, but seeing as they were both straight, Harry’s fantasies had felt harmless; an idle exercise, a private unreality he liked to spend some time in. But now Harry had fantasized about someone who lay beside him and confessed to liking boys, too. Someone who Harry could reach out and touch, and who might — the idea made Harry’s blood simmer —
‘Nothing.’
Malfoy’s as handsome as he was in the dream — less dazzling, but perhaps even more desirable for it. Polished and graceful, wearing rather severe midnight blue robes with a high collar, Malfoy would give the impression of a stern judge if it wasn’t for the way his hair — long enough to brush his chin — softens his overall look, creating an aura that’s… the first word that comes to Harry’s mind is
‘I wondered…’ Malfoy pauses, seeming to gather his thoughts. He taps a finger on his glass. ‘I wondered if the… battle, and… you know. The past. Left you bad dreams. I used to have some.’
The look in Potter’s eyes could have blasted him away. He cupped Draco’s face and kissed him with such force that Draco was slammed to the wall behind him, a cloud of dust erupting around them.
Harry’s blood roars. An effort to calm his treacherous body is futile, his brain is supplying him with images of Malfoy sucking his dick, and Harry wants to have sex with him again. Or rather, for the first time. He knows dreams aren’t reliable indicators of sexual prowess, but something in Malfoy’s gaze promises unfathomable ecstasy.
‘You best keep yourselves in one piece, got it? Esther don’t need to mourn more people.’ It was Dawn’s way of telling them she cared.
‘Well, you’ll pardon me if I don’t think you’re sexy,’ Longbottom says, and Weasley pipes in, ‘Give it another pint, mate.’
‘It’s Morse code, Malfoy. So we can be rescued.’
‘No, shut up and look!’ Draco grabbed his arm, whipped him around and pointed upwards.
‘No,’ Harry echoed. ‘Nothing serious.’
Draco runs a hand over the smooth surface of the Succubus’ curves, her wings and curled tail, and the little bump at the bottom of her feet. Harry had named her
The wizard darted off and returned with Dolohov and the witch. Harry said, ‘Go tell your Master, Dolohov, that you failed him once again. I’m in Tinworth with Draco Malfoy, and you weren’t able to catch us.’
Harry smiled. ‘I’ve already locked the door. Pull your trousers down, Malfoy.’
Harry chanced a look behind him; Rookwood had turned towards his left. ‘What’s this?’ He’d thrown the owl away somewhere, but he waved the wand in front of him, murmuring several Revelio spells. They revealed nothing.
Draco stands and walks to the fireplace. His head is spinning, he needs some time to think. He runs his hand over the carved slithering dragons on the mantelpiece to stall.
But of course! Harry chided himself for not thinking it earlier. ‘We need to be able to drive and I can’t. But we could hitchhike.’ To Malfoy’s non-comprehending glance, he explained, ‘Ask a driver to give us a lift.’
Harry heard it too. A violin thrummed from somewhere near, a sorrowful tune suffusing the air with melancholy. Merlin, would they never find any peace?
. Is it because it’s gold?’ He poked the pound.
Voldemort stood in a room Harry hadn’t seen before, holding two galleons, while Rookwood and Dolohov bent before him in submission. Fury possessed him, and he clasped the Elder Wand tight but didn’t use it.
He dismissed instantly the possibility of a curse. For one, he’d never heard of a similar spell, and secondly, what kind of curse gave so much pleasure to the victim? If it was a curse, Draco was ready to buy very expensive flowers and/or a house to the caster.
Harry cast a sideways glance at Malfoy. ‘You know a lot about this.’
She pursed her lips. ‘Harry has no idea you’ve forgotten this much?’ she asked quietly.
Just before he blacked out, he heard Dawn yell.
The train stopped at what seemed every Cornish village on the line, tiny stations that were no more than a narrow building in the woods. Commuters and teenagers climbed on board. The morning mist had burned off; in the east, the sea sparkled.
exchange his home for Slytherdom’s rocky capital, he’d have been furious. ‘I’m sorry you were the one to abandon your life for this alliance. It’s a crappy situation,’ he agreed. ‘But we’re stuck in it, and we should learn to work together. Is there something you like to do? Something you miss from home?’
He couldn’t continue. He breathed heavily, and Harry, spurned by god knows what implacability, pricked him more. He was like a dog with a bone.
Draco exhales raggedly on the sweaty sheets. Harry removes his fingers and rises on his knees over him, taking in Draco’s sprawled, liquid body, the come gleaming on Draco’s quivering stomach. His own erection is painfully hard, and he curls his hand around it. A few strokes are enough, and he climaxes over Draco, who’s staring at him, face open like the dawn. Then Harry bends and licks it clean, his come mixed with Draco’s, their tastes mingled, until Draco’s stomach is clean.
Draco knows Nariyoshi’s only saying it because the hospital is miles away and they can’t afford long taxi rides. ‘I’ll go get ready then.’
Malfoy’s eyes grew cold at the rejection. ‘Suit yourself.’ Staring at Harry, he bit into the chocolate. Before he turned to leave, he threw the card at Harry’s feet. ‘Take this then. He’s your hero.’
‘What is it?’
Draco gazed at him, his skin luminous in the firelight. ‘Are you alone?’
‘How long has it been since you sent that Patronus?’
‘And who are you then?’ she demanded from Harry, whose accent certainly didn’t suggest royalty.
‘You don’t have to continue,’ Malfoy said. His face had gone paler than normal.
Malfoy talks over him. ‘Not a hero? Perhaps you fancied me even then. Perhaps you wanted me to drag you into an empty classroom and have my way with you.’
She sliced some more, her expression thoughtful. ‘I reckon it’s possible, my love.’ She put down the knife, rinsed her hands and approached Harry, following his gaze outside. ‘Depends how much they want to.’

‘I remember

, when a big hard cock intruded and took up space in Harry’s body. He urged Draco faster, and Draco propped himself over him, elbows on either side of his face, and snapped his hips forward.
Harry’s heart drummed in his chest. He rubbed his palms on his jeans, body tense, getting ready to fight.
Malfoy’s uncomprehending look reminds Harry that he doesn’t know about his Muggle upbringing, so he explains, while Malfoy’s face clouds over. Harry’s voice is casual. It’s easy for him to talk about it in the light of day.
Draco smiled fondly. ‘I’ll show you.’ He picked his wand up from from where it'd fallen by the bed and Accio’ed the lube he carried in his robes out of habit rather than hope.
‘I was advised early on by one of my tutors to never allow my parents to catch me at it. Right, where was I?’
else, no money, no family I can go back to, no home, no wand, not even a name that’s not a disgrace whichever side of the war you’re standing in.
Draco nods. ‘I can’t think of how to tell him. It seems easy, and yet.’ He waves the pamphlet. ‘This gives me no reassurance whatsoever. What if Nariyoshi thinks I should be sent to the madhouse? What if
‘Yes, it is.’ Harry looked mesmerised at the sight of his fingers fucking Draco, making Draco gasp and writhe, lost in the sensation, until fingers weren't enough. ‘Take them out, slowly… that’s it,’ Draco instructed. He rolled him over and straddled him. ‘Ready, Harry?’
way, but I am surprised — and delighted,
and Draco hated him, because he came to ruin the one good thing he had in his life. ‘Your mother is distraught,’ Potter said again, not letting go of Draco, even as he squirmed. ‘You’ve been in a coma for days. Weeks actually.’
She shrugged.
. I’m up for giving it a go.’
Harry couldn’t promise they’d make it out safely, so he said nothing. What paltry words of comfort could he offer? Instead, he wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulders and gave a gentle tug. With a needy sigh of relief, Draco leaned against his side, stretching his arm around Harry’s chest. His head rested on Harry’s shoulder, heavy and trusting in a way that made Harry’s heart flutter.
‘Do you like writing the horoscopes?’ Potter asked.
Harry and Draco stood at the edge of the clearing as the sky lightened over the treetops. Within minutes, the Roma were ready to depart. Cam whistled, and the Thestrals spread wide wings and soared into the sky, pulling the vardos behind them. The sight of them over the treetops, dark silhouettes graceful against the coming dawn, made Harry feel
‘What the—’ Draco murmured.
‘There’d be a Voldemort in the Mirror world…’ Draco felt goosebumps. ‘And Harry would be dead.’
‘And I’ll make love to you.’ Harry is shivering with the thrill of saying it out loud, something so dangerous, something he desperately wants. ‘Forever, if I can.’
not Muggles.’ He darted a look at Draco. ‘Can you—?’
‘Nothing, just looking around.’ He set off down the main street, checking the wares and chatting with the locals until Harry had settled the matter. The evening was drawing to a close, and the sun gilded the roofs and spires of the city as they headed back to the palace.
‘Travellers,’ Harry whispered.
Here it came. Potter wanted to talk about
‘And you believed them?’
The return of the shop assistant spared them as well as her announcement that the coins were pure gold. She rang up their purchases. Harry stuffed their own dirty clothing in a plastic bag, while Malfoy opened the map and inquired about the fastest way to Falmouth.
‘That day was the best day of my life,’ Harry murmured. ‘I’d wanted it for so long.’
‘Will you still love me when we’re no longer young or beautiful?’ Draco’s face ripples with the force of his arousal.
The Inferi-Draco starts to rise, and Harry knows he’ll have to kill it before it kills him. He must kill Inferi-Draco, but it won’t stop him, so he must do it
The man, Cam, laughed. ‘Can you get to your gold, boy? Travelling with this one, I bet you can’t.’ His eyes slid up and down Harry before turning to his community. ‘Give this one to You-Know-Who, and we might earn ourselves a powerful friend.’ He rubbed his stubble and let the silence stretch. Harry’s pulse galloped, the tension straining his nerves to a snapping point.
‘Shut up, Potter!’
‘You—’
anyway, and watched as Draco kneeled and licked Harry’s cock.
Draco took a sharp intake of breath.
‘’Smatter of fact there was a letter,’ Rookwood said, sounding closer to them. ‘Only, the parchment was blank. A joke maybe. It’s in my pocket. Want to see it, Malfoy? Come out and get it.’
They trudged through muddy fields and along a tree-lined path that lead to the country road. The temperature rose slightly as they walked, drying their still damp clothing. Harry knew what he must look like if Malfoy’s appearance was anything to go by. He felt damp
. But back then—’ A very early memory: being very young and wanting to decorate his cupboard for Christmas. His aunt had grudgingly let him have one bauble, a bright red one with sparkly bits, and he placed it on the shelf next to a Rubik’s Cube he could never solve. He’d spent the rest of the holidays admiring the way the ornament caught the meagre light and shone, casting sparks on the dim walls like distant stars. The stupid bauble had made him so happy.
‘Er…’ Harry said, ‘tonight is the seventh night we’ve been married. And— as you know— or maybe you don’t—’
And then, surprisingly, Pauline did. ‘Shouldn’t your valet help you with that?’
‘Family obligations.’ Salazar’s voice hinted at suppressed fury.
‘So don’t,’ Draco said, pushing his food around. His appetite hadn’t fully returned yet.
A strong scent of mint and dittany permeated the vardo, which comforted Harry; familiar, domestic smells, reminiscent of carefree times at the Hogwarts greenhouses. The bed, tucked between two cupboards painted with flowers, was heaped with soft blankets. He flopped on top of them without undressing, just tossing his glasses on a shelf. He’d no energy left and was bemused to see Draco remove his shoes for him. ‘Who’s the valet now?’ he mumbled, eyes closing.
Draco snorted. Incandescent with rage, Dolohov growled and pointed his wand at the corner where Harry’s voice came from. ‘Avada Kedavra!’ He cast it again and again, lighting up the night with the curse’s vile green colour. The spell dug deep in the wall, making it rain plaster. The lit windows of the houses around them winked out one by one, their residents realising that something was happening outside.
‘Shut up, Fenston.’
Harry sighed, exasperated. Trust Malfoy to be infuriating even in the midst of disaster. ‘You’ll freeze to death. Trust me. I know how cold it gets out there.’
Dolohov swept imperious eyes over the man and replied with cold contempt, but Harry stopped paying attention. The witch had wandered over to the swings and slipped among the trees. If she looked up, she’d see them. Draco’s face had turned the colour of ash; he’d stopped breathing, his body rigid with tension. Harry held his breath, his mind whirring with defense ideas, all useless against a wand.
‘What’s on your mind?’ Potter whispers, stroking Draco’s hair off his forehead. ‘Nariyoshi? Telling him about magic?’
. What’s more, I did all that on my own.’ He blew on his tea.
He couldn’t mean what he meant. Stunned, Harry whispered
you talking about?’ Draco asks. ‘I just said I’m magic!’
Draco’s eyes filled with wonder and delight. ‘Help yourself,’ he said in a teasing tone, gesturing with careless elegance to his body.
As they’re sat down in the comfortable armchairs by their small table Harry feels a bit awkward, nervously fiddling with the sleeves of his shirt, not quite knowing what to say.
this chapter, again, is pretty short, but i hope you enjoy it.
Malfoy doesn't stop, but Harry can see his hand is shaking. He quickly points his wand at Malfoy, and cries: "
Voldemort to have them. And the best way he knows to help is to be vague, even though he clearly knows that the witch in front of him is in fact Hermione, after their six shared years at Hogwarts.
"What the hell was that, Potter?"
But Harry's used to facing death. He's used to battle, used to pain, used to having to fight for his life... Draco isn't weak, but he deserves better than this. Better than to live in constant fear, to experience that inner battle between what's right and what his family wants him to do. With Voldemort using the Malfoy Manor as a base, Harry can only imagine how much time he's been spending there with them, and how utterly terrifying it must be to have someone like that as a constant presence in your own home. And Draco has been alone in all of this.
“You’re gonna take me to a muggle café aren’t you?” Draco sighs, but there is a glint in his eyes.
"Hold it, Potter!"
"I don't blame you," Draco says with an empty laugh. "I was a real jerk to you, from the start." Harry stays silent. Of course, what Draco is saying is absolutely true, but Harry understands him on a whole new level now, and he doesn't want to make him feel any worse.
"Of course," he says, "you're not to do all the work. Just stop him from making a mess out of it." Malfoy laughs, and Harry walks away, fuming.
"Is this the best you can do, Scarhead?" Malfoy tries to keep up the taunting voice he always uses around Harry, but he's panting and has to bite down hard on his lip just to keep himself from moaning out loud, so Harry hardly takes his words seriously.
"Oi, Scarface!" Malfoy calls. Harry ignores him, but can't help but to slow down his walk. "Where are your friends, huh?" Malfoy turns around to follow Harry. "Finally realised you're a useless prat, did they?" Harry still doesn't answer, but he's standing still now.
Knowing Voldemort, he's probably going to do worse than that. Torture and play with him. Kill his parents in front of him. Perhaps even use the Imperius curse to make Draco kill them himself.
a crush."
"I'm sorry." Harry's voice is barely a whisper.
He tries to ignore this for now, and to instead focus on the Potion in front of him and getting Professor Slughorn in a good mood.
The next time they're alone isn't until after one of the DA meetings. Dobby came to warn them about Umbridge, and now Harry's running as fast as he can to get away from her and the Inquisitorial squad. When Malfoy catches him with a Trip Jinx, he's angry and frustrated. The DA meetings were the one thing left at Hogwarts he was actually enjoying, and now Umbridge has taken that away, too. Malfoy hoists Harry up by the back of his robes and whispers in his ear: "Got you, Potter." Harry tries to ignore the way his voice sends chills down his spine.
"I always thought," Draco continues, "that what my father taught me was right. I literally didn't know anything else. That's why I've been such a prick. He taught me that purebloods like ourselves are superior, and I believed it. I was just a kid, you know. And I know that doesn't excuse my behaviour, especially as I got older, but it hasn't exactly been easy. All I ever wanted to do as a kid was make my father proud. I thought, maybe if I was a good enough son he'd be less distant, maybe he'd hug me... I don't know." He pauses. Harry feels awful - all this time, he'd thought Draco bullied people because he enjoyed it. When really, much like Harry himself, he'd been lonely and insecure, just acting like he thought he was supposed to.
"You can't help me," he says, voice almost a whisper. His arm is shaking even more at this point, and Harry thinks he can see it drop just a little. He's not going to do it after all.
"Don't think it means anything to me either, git." He shoves Malfoy's shoulder a little, suddenly nervous. "I can't help it you're hot."
Harry's staring up at familiar features through his swollen eyes. Draco is here. Right in front of him, being demanded by his father and Bellatrix to confirm Harry's identity. Harry knows just by looking into Draco's eyes that he immediately recognises Harry despite his deformed face. He tries to give Draco a pleading look, begging him not to give them away, but without making anyone else suspicious. He tries to deliver words with his look. Words aimed not at the person Draco thinks he has to be, but at the boy who had once cried in Harry's arms; the boy who had exposed something else hidden deep within him, a part of Draco that is nothing like his harsh exterior. That's who Harry is trying to reach, because he knows he's in there.
Harry knows he needs to get his shit together, this obviously can't continue. Malfoy might be hot, but nothing could ever happen between them due to him also being, well, a bully. A not-very-good person. Yeah, Harry has to get over his stupid crush immediately. The only question is, how?
Harry shakes his head, oblivious, too preoccupied with sorting out the mess in his head to be able to deduct any new information on his own.
"Sorry," Harry mutters and takes out his wand to gather the scattered bean pieces back in his hands.
- that the other boy had started to look just a tiny bit better. A little more light in his eyes, some colour to his cheeks. Now he looks almost worse than before.
The word about Ginny and Harry is spreading fast through the castle, and he can't help but notice a distance growing between himself and Draco Malfoy. It pains him. He really likes Ginny, and he doesn't want to feel guilty because of it. Ginny is fun. Her smile is bright, her energy matches his own, and she makes him smile. And there is no sneaking around necessary.
Now there is nothing to see but fire. The flames are circling them, coming closer. Harry can't believe his luck when he spots a couple of old broomsticks. He seizes them quickly and throws one of them to Ron while he climbs onto the other himself.
"Oh," Hermione frowns. "Then, what?"
It's like Harry had flipped a switch. Malfoy stops. The anger disappears from his face, replaced by something Harry can't identify. He lowers his arm and gets off Harry, his wand forgotten in Harry's hand. Malfoy sits on the floor next to Harry as Harry pushes himself up into a sitting position. Neither of them say anything. Harry notices that Malfoy is still shaking, his eyes fixed on the bathroom floor, arms hugging his knees to his chest.
“Well,” Harry says, “Of course I’ll take you, Al. Now go before you miss the train!”
“It’s not fair,” he says eventually. “It’s just not fair. She was so good, so kind, and she knew… She knew me and she didn’t care, she loved me anyway, and she shouldn’t have- She shouldn’t have died, she didn’t deserve that. It should have been me, it should have been me in there instead, that’s what would have made sense, and Scorp would have his mum, and Tori could’ve found herself a real husband, a better husband, someone worth her time and her love, I- I can’t,” he stops talking abruptly once again but this time he can’t stop the tears from falling. “I can’t do this without her.” He chokes out the last words in between sobs, breaking Harry’s heart.
“Yes… Kind of. Not really. I think I need to have a conversation with Ginny.”
The one good thing that comes out of it, though, is since Harry did the interview for
Harry can feel his own heart beating hard in his chest. Is Draco going to do it? Is Dumbledore going to die? The answer to that question is obvious, Harry tells himself: Of course not! Dumbledore is the greatest wizard in the world! He is talented, old, wise and brave. He has defeated both Grindelwald and Voldemort before, and several other dangerous wizards too, no doubt. He is going to survive this. Like he has survived everything before. Like Harry himself has survived.
wanted you."
He scoffs. "Are you messing with me, Potter? You've hated me since the day we met."
"What's that supposed to mean, Potter?"
"I- I can't do that, Hermione. I'm talking about getting
Hundreds of thoughts start swirling around in Harry’s head at once - questioning his feelings towards Ginny and Draco respectively, memories of the intimate moments he’d shared with the man sitting opposite him, wondering whether this is the life he’d always pictured and whether he’s actually happy...
Hey, I'm so sorry for the wait you guys!! I've recently started working full time and moved away from home, so I've been super busy. I can't promise anything for the future chapters, but I will try to finish them soon. Also this one is pretty short, but I wanted to update.
“Maybe.” Harry doesn’t really know what to do. He needs to be alone to sort out his thoughts...and feelings. So many confusing feelings. “Unless there was something else, I.. Maybe we could continue this another time?”
don't be so full of yourself."
Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy this chapter!
Potter, you absolute worthless potion brewer! You're supposed to stir and heat it
And yet, Dumbledore is still dead.
In the days that follow Harry catches himself smiling at Draco whenever no one is looking. He never gets a smile in return, but Draco will keep eye contact for a few seconds, letting Harry know it's okay. This slight change in behaviour between the two leaves Harry feeling a bit awkward, not to mention confused. Is he actually starting to like Draco Malfoy - as something more than just a good shag? As something like a... friend? The thought seems ridiculous to Harry and yet the feelings are there. Though they're still insulting each other at any given time, he doesn't feel the same passion as before. There is no weight behind the ugly words. In fact, more and more frequently the nasty fights between them are being replaced with friendly banter. Maybe people around them are noticing, or maybe not. Either way, no one is mentioning it. Maybe they are simply too busy with their own lives to acknowledge a difference in the stupid interactions between Draco and himself. Harry sighs. Maybe there is no reason in dwelling on it.
I have literally never written smut before, but i got to the point in this story where i couldn't figure out a way to go forward without it. so be gentle with me. i did keep it as short and vague as possible and i was cringing during the entire time i wrote it and i had to take breaks.
for Godric's sake; just simple, physical attraction. And who can blame him - the git's handsome. It's really all Malfoy's own fault, strutting around like he does with those stupidly fitted robes showing off his perfect arse, and always wearing that ridiculous smirk on his face - what does he expect? After all, Harry has
"I'm well aware of my extraordinary talents in potions, there's no need to point it out for me," Malfoy snaps.
“You really are thick, aren’t you, Potter?” Draco rolls his eyes and takes a deep breath. “I fell in love with you.”
"Draco, please."
“So I heard Al wanted to stay with you guys tonight, is that okay?”
