“Potter. I’ll write. I promise.” Neither Harry nor Draco were in any rush to get back to their dorms that night. The next day the two of them sat next to each other on the train ride home and said their goodbyes. As sad as Harry was to see Draco go, he was excited to be home with his parents for the break. He just needed to figure out how to hide Draco’s letters…
I could go before the Wizengamont and expose the truth. Tell him that. You tell him that if he doesn’t help your father, then I will tell the whole world the truth about their Savior.” That’s when it dawned on Draco. His father thought he had been thinking about Harry Potter because they were…together.
Draco could feel his eyes becoming watery. He always thought people had moved on. Forgotten about him… He looked around at his cottage and noticed that it was beginning to grow dark outside. Harry must have noticed this too.
The night of the sleep over came quickly. The work week flew by and before he knew it, it was Saturday already, and Teddy was bouncing off the walls in excitement. The boy had cleaned his room five times, gone through all of his toys, and pulled out everything he wanted to show Scorpius.
Granted, not everyone else got their photo on the front page of the Daily Prophet, but what else is new?
“Draco…how’d it go?” Harry looked at the man as he began to make his way towards the kitchen and Harry followed. The two sat and Harry stared as Draco sat in silence before finally speaking.
“Right – yeah, it’s just Scorpius and I as well…like I said.” Draco smirked again and Harry felt a flush on his neck.
The two looked at each other for minutes before the Malfoy patriarch spoke, “Go back to your room Draco.” Draco didn’t need to be told twice – he tore out of that room and went straight up the stairs. But when he arrived at his room, he saw his door was missing.
When Harry’s parents came back that night, the first thing Harry did was apologize for his behavior. He sat them both down in the living room and braced himself. “Harry, you already told us you were gay son…What on earth could this be about?” James tried to make a joke but was too nervous to fully commit.
Draco Malfoy made the Slytherin team that year as well. He even ended up in the same position as Harry, seeker. This only fueled their budding rivalry.
Harry was excited when conversation leapt to ‘Who at Hogwarts Was Gay’ and he quickly realized his later-in-life sexual awakening was unfortunate. Granted, he was fighting a dark wizard and probably wouldn’t have had time anyway, but still…just
“Of course Potter! I had to make sure that CHARLIE of yours knew what he was missing out on.” Harry saw Draco wink and immediately felt the tightness in his chest. Oh Merlin…not again.
James and Lily came back and found a much happier Harry. They decided not to comment on the change, but instead, thanked Sirius and Remus in private. When they asked what they had done to help him, the two exchanged looks and said, “Nothing special, just talked.”
the classes. It was if he just ‘magically appeared’. Draco knew that wasn’t the case and suspected a certain invisibility cloak was helping.
Draco seemed to understand and nodded in agreement. The conversation came to a halt when they heard a loud thud from upstairs and felt it was best to get the boys to get some sleep. As much as Harry wanted to get caught in the doorway with Draco again, he noticed Draco hang behind him as they exited.
“Maybe you’re right. Maybe we were flirting…” Harry heard Draco say before he closed his eyes and sleep washed over them both.
Astoria arrived at the gates and Harry worked on getting her through the wards quickly. The two ended up looking at each other in his living room before Harry offered her a drink and to sit. She quickly declined the drink but moved to sit on the sofa and Harry did the same, sitting at the other end.
The dreams escalated in this way until he was finally able to see features – dark hair, green eyes, a scar… Before Draco even knew the gender of this person, he knew the name – Draco Malfoy was having flirtatious dreams about golden-boy, Harry Potter.
“I don’t want to tell my son anything unless it’s real. He already doesn’t have a mother - I don’t need more people going in and out of his life.” Draco’s voice was strong in this moment and it took Harry by surprise.
“Any time Mr. Potter. I expect I’ll be seeing more of you.” She gave Harry a quick hug and left the room.
The two talked about everything and actually started to get into heavier and more personal conversations about family and the war. Harry could tell Draco was still guarded about his father and his actions but seemed to be okay talking about everything else. Harry thought he knew a lot about what happened during the war, but he was wrong.
“Harry, what are you doing? Meeting up with Draco Malfoy late at night? Alone?! He’s bad news Harry!”
His parents tried to shield him from the rumors surrounding him. Some in the wizarding community felt he had to be even more powerful than Voldemort, even as a child, and therefore could possibly be the most powerful wizard there ever was. Others were afraid of him. What if he ended up being the next Voldemort, but worse?
? But, no, he said all those things…he said he had liked Harry for a long time… he got in fight with Blaise about him…this just didn’t make any sense.
But instead, all he felt was fear – he wanted to run out the library and go back to the safety of his room (or where there once was safety).
The situation Harry wasn’t prepared for was when Draco wrote, “What if I came as your date? You know, show that you’ve moved on.”
Harry. Everyone would be returning tomorrow, and Harry had been no where to be found. Draco just assumed he had gone back to taking his meals in his room and was actively avoiding Draco at all costs. Draco warred with himself about going and knocking on the man’s door but fought against it.
Harry shifted his body on the bed and placed his hands in his lap. Charlie felt that this pose made Harry look much more innocent than the man who had been kissing him merely seconds prior. “Oh, right…yeah okay…talk, sure.”
“Oh, that’s quite alright Mr. Potter. Harry’s had enough to worry about this year…” Harry was afraid Oliver was going to bring up Draco and tried to shoot him a look, but found Oliver was looking straight at his father. “You know, with this being his last year and all. It can be quite stressful. I remember my last year – the classes were insane. Harry’s handling it much better than I did.
They had spent the better part of the day in town and returned in time for lunch. Draco and Harry dropped the items in the living room and Draco quickly began to put up his groceries. He prepared himself lunch before remembering Harry was still sitting at his kitchen table and began to prepare him a sandwich as well.
The younger boy turned to his dad, “Can we dad? Please?”. Harry always admired how kids could so easily become friends. These two boys barely spoke to one another and here they were asking for a playdate. One in which he knew Draco would never agree to.
“Oliver this is…amazing. Thank you…” Harry moved to give Oliver a hug and caught Remus’ eyes before looking away.
Harry ate the rest of his sandwich then went back to his room and immediately fell back asleep. He was in no shape to process any of this.
“It’s alright ‘arry. Probably best this any way. All this Quidditch has really put me behind in my studies with Hooch. It’ll be good to have some alone time to catch-up.”
“That’s enough Malfoy. Go.” Oliver’s chest had grown, and he was standing slightly in front of Harry. Harry felt that this position made it look like he was protecting Harry…but Harry didn’t understand from what.
Draco soon turned the conversation to a much safer topic – healing. This was actually Harry’s favorite topic to hear Draco talk about. Harry wasn’t particularly interested in healing, he felt he spent enough of his time in the hospital wing and didn’t need to be reminded of it all, but there was something about the way
The next morning, the Hogwarts rumor-mill was back up and running. And if Harry thought in his final year he would be immune to being involved, he was wrong. He wasn’t sure how, but someone found out about his and Draco’s argument last night. And just like last time, the rumor varied person to person.
When Draco finished, he looked directly at Harry again, “Thank you Harry. Thank you. You didn’t have to do anything. This wasn’t your issue… but thank you.”
The two carried on casual conversation, discussing work, life after the war, and what the people from Hogwarts that they kept up with were up to. They stayed clear of anything too personal.
Hermione must have not told them he was coming, which was smart on her part. Didn’t give them a chance to mysteriously eat in the kitchens or go to Hogsmeade instead. But it also meant they weren’t prepared and therefore couldn’t hide the emotions from their face.
of my many talents.” Oliver gave Harry a smile before moving in to kiss him. Harry met Oliver’s lips and kissed back. In this moment, he felt…solid. All of the thoughts of Draco and the breakup and the wedding…just stopped. It was like he froze in time.
“Bye Mr. Draco! Bye Scorpius!” the boy turned to look at the younger boy “Maybe Harry will let us play together some time.”
On instinct, Harry moved closer. He had no idea how his movements would be received but figured he should at least try to comfort the man. He moved into hug Draco. As he wrapped his arms around the man, he felt Draco tense up before finally releasing and hugging back.
was a much more suitable name for a muggle apparently. But unless he is in town for supplies, they leave him alone.
“So, what do we do…?” Harry asked timidly. For some reason he felt the need to look to Draco for guidance in this.
“I’m going to talk to her…alone. We don’t need to go through lawyers. We can do this ourselves. If she wants time with him, then fine. But she isn’t taking him completely.” Harry didn’t love how this sounded. He really should use lawyers to make things more official but understood where Draco was coming from.
“Harry…” Harry looked happy but worried at the same time, tucking his bottom lip in between his teeth.
Draco stared at Harry and let him continue. “Charlie told me what you said to him at my birthday party. That you felt I deserved someone who loved me and I think…I think that person is you. I hope that person is you.”
“Yeah…and what did he say?” Harry was surprising growing angry at a five-year-old boy. What if he told Teddy things that could scare him? What if he told him lies?
Harry's still in his room and refusing to leave, Draco is looking for alone time, and a letter from a certain someone contains concerning information...
Harry tried not to focus too much on the feeling of Charlie holding his arm. “Right…well, what did you want to talk about?” Harry tried to act nonchalant, but knew it wasn’t working.
“So, if I was gay…you wouldn’t mind?” Ron looked up quickly and had an angry expression on his face.
Draco reached out to grab his arm and pull him back down. Why was everyone grabbing Harry and pulling him down?! Harry shot a glare at him but sat back on the bar stool.
the time and Harry could see their hands grazing one another from time to time. Harry was happy for them, but he was mostly just happy they were good friends and weren’t flaunting their relationship in front of him.
“Draco, do you think we were flirting back at Hogwarts…?” Harry watched as Draco changed positions and placed his hands behind his head and laid back onto his pillows. Harry stayed in this position and looked down at Draco.
. Draco pushed and pushed at these dreams – plead for them to go away. Took shower after shower and erased them from his memory, but after his 15
Harry continued, “It was right when I was figuring myself out. Charlie was openly gay. And he was available. So, it happened.” Harry hoped the conversation sounded matter of fact and not defensive, but he really couldn’t be sure.
It was only when Draco calmly took his arm and sat him back down that he saw Harry relax and truly process what this all meant.
Astoria looked more put together than she did banging on the front door of Malfoy Manor. She wore an elegant black dress, modest heels, and her dark hair framed her face beautifully. Harry noticed how her pale skin echoed Draco’s and their son’s. Harry could now see her features in Scorpius.
“Look. I know this probably is stupid. Like, we just became sort of friends and we have a really long and terrible history. But if you think about it, nothing truly bad has happened between us in a really long time so maybe that means we are friends. And we don’t have to be anything more if you don’t want to. This is all happening pretty fast for me actually and I just don’t really know how to process it all so I’m trying to acknowledge my feelings and be honest about them because that’s what Charlie said to do….” Harry was rambling and Draco wasn’t really hearing any of it.
Realizing that Charlie meant Draco and that he never knew that they were merely pretending at Harry’s birthday, Harry simply looked at the ground. “We…aren’t together.”
As much as he hated to do it, two years ago he went to the Ministry of Magic and talked to Kingsley Shacklebolt about job. He stated his requirements and thought he was going to have to use his fame as a way to guilt Shacklebolt into a job, but Kingsley seemed to have the perfect solution.
“Like, I’m not ready to make anything…public. We have…history and a lot of people witnessed the events of this morning. I don’t know if I want to be seen like that…” Draco smiled.
He knew Draco was an amazing father just based on how he was with Scorpius, but Harry always figured that was his own kid, so of course he was good with him. He felt Teddy would probably be different…but he wasn’t.
Hermione wore a serious look on her face. “….Harry. That’s not true. I’ve seen you two together. I’ve seen him write to you over and over again – even though I’ve never seen you respond (but I guess I now know why). I’m sure whatever happened, it can be fixed.”
“And Harry, do you not remember how our ‘relationship’ came to be? I was a fake boyfriend for you. I was helping you make Charlie jealous. I just think, we need more time.” Draco’s voice wasn’t harsh. It wasn’t angry; it was…gentle.
Harry stood up to leave. Draco didn’t move. Harry gave Draco once last glance then took off up the staircase and Draco heard his door shut.
of his favorite people, Harry’s mind began to wander. He knew his family was loving Oliver. Every single member of this table was eating up every word Oliver spoke. He bonded with James and Sirius over a love of Quidditch. Apparently Oliver loved to cook and therefore had plenty to discuss with Remus who kept picking his brain about recipes. And Lily was impressed with Oliver’s high marks in school, his excellence with Charms (his mother’s favorite subject in school), and his desire to return to education. “I always told Harry that education is the most important thing a young witch or wizard can have. Magic is nothing without your ability to control it and use it properly.”
Harry sat down at the table across from his dad, his usual spot. He opened his mouth to speak but was silenced by James continuing.
As Draco sat down, he noticed a disgruntled expression rising on Ron’s face. He looked to find a heated glare coming from the younger Weasley but was surprised to find a Harry that was…smiling.
The two ate together and Draco once again found it refreshing to have a companion to eat with. Draco figured Harry must have sensed his earlier frustrations and started conversation about life on the farm and his animals. This was safe territory for Draco. Anything so long as it wasn’t about whatever Harry was really here for.
“Yeah – of course. It’s no problem. It’ll be good for Scorpius to have some interaction.” Draco smiled and Harry melted.
“I see…well, if this is what you think is best, then I’ll support you. You know that.” Draco looked up at him and gave him a half-smile.
“Hmm well, why don’t you tell me why you decided to come so late in the day, rather than during your normal early mornings. Surely, you aren’t still on the clock at the Ministry.” Draco watched Harry get uncomfortable for a moment then bounce back.
He is naturally replaying the kiss that happened earlier tonight. He laughs to himself thinking about his fifteen-year-old self and what
But those days were obviously gone. His father was in Azkaban and his mother was…well, Draco honestly wasn’t sure what was happening with her. But she had changed.
Harry had made sure that Teddy knew about the war. It was important for him to know how bravely his parents fought and how they gave their life to an important cause. But when he spoke of the war, it was in general terms and mostly focused on Tonks and Remus’ involvement – not Harry’s…fame.
“Ron, I trust Draco. That’s what should matter. I like him… a lot actually. And as for my dad, well, we will cross that bridge when the time comes. I just need you, both of you, to be happy for me and support me – can you do that?”
The man who opened the door was gorgeous. Platinum blonde hair slicked back with a few stray pieces falling straight into his face. A fitted black suit with a black button-up beneath. He looked so handsome that Harry almost forgot what he came over for.
He couldn’t believe this was happening. Harry Potter was on top of him, making out with him, aroused because of him… Draco tried to take it a step further and pushed his hips up slightly to gain friction, but immediately found his lips abandoned.
They went to get Harry’s broom then began their walk towards the pitch. Harry grabbed Draco a broom and mounted his own. As Harry kicked off into the air, and Draco followed after – he tried not to watch the way Harry’s body moved on the broom. He had played against Harry enough times to know that when Harry flew it was like watching a hippogriff take flight. He was always majestic but matched with intensity. Harry didn’t fly because he had to, he flew because it made him feel good.
Draco flushed and looked away. But before he did, he could have sworn he saw a look pass over Harry’s face. He wasn’t sure what the look meant, but it didn’t mirror Ginny’s.
When the two parted, part of Harry had flashbacks. He thought about his first kiss and the way Dean looked at him after. When he pulled away from Draco – his face was a stark contrast to Dean’s. Draco still had his eyes closed and was smiling…
“I 100% agree. It does feel…natural.” Draco took this moment to move closer to Harry on the bed. He took the man in his arms and held him there for a moment until he felt the man stir.
Draco? What the hell are you doing?! You’re getting married? To…to some girl?!” Harry couldn’t even believe what he was saying. It took every ounce of him to push down his magic, force some sort of control.
He would repeat it until he could find the focus inside of himself to open his books and study. Books open, parchment scattered about, he heard a knock at his door. Draco looked up in alarm. What if this was his father?
Voldemort preached. But it’s to be expected, right? Just because Voldemort is gone, doesn’t mean his supporters just up and decided he was actually a bad guy. They weren’t all Draco. The rest of them, for the most part,
When he finally reaches Draco its as if neither of them knows what to say and Draco will be damned if he’s the first to speak.
Harry felt his heart fall. Ron looked ready to murder Dean for many reasons and Hermione simply put her arm around Harry. Harry knew he should look away, but he couldn’t. Dean looked…happy.
Harry anxiously awaited Draco’s letter concerning their date. As excited as he was, he forgot to mention to Draco that whenever he goes out in public, people tend to harass him. They ask for autographs, pictures, and more often than not, want to touch him. The first couple of years after the war had been the worst, and now it’s died down.
“These aren’t sleep robes Potter, it’s just a robe. And it’s actually quite expensive, I’ll have you know.” Draco hated himself.
Molly’s smile stood firm. “Of course, dear. I knew the moment Charlie left and you had breakfast with me in the kitchen that one morning. I could tell on your face that you were hurting.”
Draco tensed up at the thought of acceptance, “It’s definitely not accepted across all of the wizarding world. I imagine the Weasleys are okay with it because they have seven children, so if one is gay it’s no issue. There are six more to carry on the bloodline. And Dean isn’t pureblood so…” Draco was growing heated and hated himself for it. He was projecting way too much into this conversation. He didn’t even know the Weasleys or Dean’s family. It was wrong to make these assumptions.
“I don’t know…can’t be that early. Sun’s up. We must have slept late…” Harry flushed thinking back on last night.
“Right…well…um, for now I suppose that’ll just be Hermione and Ron.” Draco hated the sound in his voice as he spoke. “I plan to tell them this afternoon. I can meet you in your room tonight, after?” Harry looked at Draco with hope and Draco smiled back and nodded. “Okay, well, I should go. Ron wants to tell me all about the shit-storm that apparently happened after I left.” Harry smiled at him as he made his way back towards the rooms.
The next three months were a series of dates and ‘sleep-overs’ that alternated between Malfoy Manor and Grimmauld Place. And Harry loved it.
Molly gave a knowing smile. “Of course, dear. Draco will always be welcome in this house – regardless of what
When he heard the door open, he jumped up and quickly made his way to the entry way of the Manor. He was met with an expressionless Draco. Harry honestly couldn’t tell how the conversation went by the way this man looked.
Before Harry knew it, Draco grabbed him by his wrist and pushed him inside the room before slamming the door shut. Both men looked at each other in a moment of fear from the noise, but quickly decided to push past it. Draco latched on to Harry’s neck and Harry listened as he let out sounds he hadn’t heard from himself in a long time.
He simply went from his room, to his bathroom, to the Great Hall, to class, to the library, and back to his room. In the library, he found a table at the very back that didn’t require him to look at anyone. It was just him and his books. He spoke to no one and no one spoke to him.
“So what’s for dinner?” Harry grinned as an attempt to dodge the impending doom of conversation about to afront him.
Harry went to sleep that night more content than he had ever been. As he drifted off, he saw flashes of blonde hair and grey eyes.
Harry thought that Kingsley would approach him about being an auror again. But this, this surprisingly felt right. He would get to help people without doing anymore fighting. And he would get to help those who were like himself or Hermione – unaware of Wizard culture.
He grew concerned, grabbed his wand, and got out of bed to go and find him. He saw a faint light coming from the kitchen and made his way downstairs to see the source.
“So talk to her. Or better yet, take her out that way she’s less likely to cause a scene.” Honestly, Harry was less concerned with Astoria causing a scene than Draco – but he wasn’t going to say that. “Let her know how you feel.”
Charlie threw his chair back and stormed out of the pub. George followed after him, but the rest of the group decided they were way too drunk to deal with this and decided to call it a night. Hermione and Seamus tried to get Harry to leave, but he refused. Ron walked over and took one of Harry’s arms while Dean grabbed the other. Harry began to fight back and yell. He threw his arms around like a child, all the while crying and yelling something about “-harlie!” and “Sorry ‘arlie!”.
about it. You aren’t bisexual just because you did it.” Draco felt the need to make this point clear.
“What the hell does that mean? Did you hear anything I said to you? I’ve been looking for you for ages!” Harry looked as if he was beginning to finally look around at his surroundings and take it all in. “And what the hell are you
He loved Christmas dinner – all of his favorites would be made, and he would sit at the table with his mother and father. All happy.
And just like that, in walked a disoriented looking Harry Potter. His hair looked somehow worse than usual with half of it sticking up and the other half as flat as a board. He remained in his boxer briefs as he entered the kitchen and seemed to have no interest to clothe himself anytime soon. He yawned and stretched himself into the kitchen and looked at Draco in earnest.
“Draco! You haven’t told him! This directly concerns him!” She was trying to keep her voice level, but he could hear it beginning to rise.
Once the conversation stalled, Harry grew uncomfortable. Draco broke the tension and appeared to want to get to know one another a bit more…
Draco went into his room and did just that. Showered, then homework. He tried to busy himself with his work and kept trying to re-focus but found his thoughts drifting towards the letter more and more. He shook himself out of it and once again tried to work on his defense paper, but thinking about defense made him think about the boy down the hall…
Over the years, Harry had seen Lucius Malfoy on several occasions. There were times in Diagon Alley when the Potters would run into the Malfoys while doing back-to-school shopping. In those moments, there were harsh words muttered under the breaths of the patriarchs of both families and fierce glances between the sons. Then there were times when Lucius would come up to the school for matches or meetings.
The last week of his fifth year was a blur as was the train ride home. When his mum picked him up at the station, Harry couldn’t speak. As soon as he got in the car and they started driving away from King’s Cross Station, Harry broke down in sobs. He hadn’t realized how long he had been holding it in.
All of these thoughts hit Harry quickly and he hadn’t noticed that Draco hadn’t said anything or made any sort of noise. He looked to Draco just as Draco spoke, “Astoria…”
Harry even got to his farm. And while he had only spent a day with Draco, it was more social interaction than Draco had had in two years…
Harry quickly learned that Draco was extremely intelligent. Some nights, the two of them would bring their homework up to the tower and Draco would help Harry on his potions assignments. Other nights they played games of Exploding Snap or talked about their mutual love of Quidditch. A discussion on Quidditch quickly turned into a ranking of the hottest Quidditch players of all time – with Viktor Krum ranking on both of their lists.
Draco hadn’t told anyone, because honestly – who was he going to tell, but word seemed to travel fast anyway. Once word got out about the Chosen One’s new relationship status, Draco actually began to fear for Harry’s life.
Harry was startled by the sudden sound in the silent room. He thought for sure Ron would be asleep by now, though the lack of snores should have been a clue that he wasn’t.
“Okay Teddy. I think it’s time for us to go home now.” Harry rose to usher his godson from the table.
Harry’s eyes went wide, but he tried to keep his composure. “Um…thank you sir, thank you very much.”
His mother’s trial was first, and Draco hoped she would be let off easily. She didn’t do anything wrong in the war. Her only fault was marrying a man as cowardly as his father.
Harry was the last to arrive at the restaurant, even though he was technically 15 minutes early. When he made his way to the table, he couldn’t stop his heart from pounding. He looked at the two sitting at the table and quickly noticed how
like I don’t know what you’re doing…I was there Harry. Right next to you with Draco said all those things. I was there when you two broke up – I’m not going to act as some…rebound for you.” Oliver spoke very fast and Harry’s brain couldn’t catch up.
“Ah, Mr. Teddy! My most loyal customer! What will it be today son? Triple chocolate raspberry? Strawberry vanilla custard?” The smiling wizard behind the countered peered down at the young boy.
But as much as Draco wanted to forget the letter – one piece stuck out above the rest. And it’s the line that’s burned into his memory –
But Draco Malfoy can also recall the exact moments that changed the nature of his relationship with his father forever. The day he stopped trusting the man, the day he stopped fearing the man, and the day he knew he would despise this man forever.
After the war, Harry was in no position to date. He was in a constant state of depression and had a baby to take care of. Ginny thought as much and never brought up the question of starting their relationship back up – but once Harry moved into the Burrow, it became unavoidable.
“Well, when I heard your son was staying the night, I thought it best to just pop over and check on everything. Make sure Draco, Scorpius, and Teddy were doing okay.” Leona smiled nervously as if she had been caught.
With his father in prison, the Malfoy name was already disgraced. It wasn’t like Draco could do anything more to tarnish it. They barely managed to keep their house and
Draco let out another laugh and Harry was starting to become annoyed. “No, Perfect Potter. I didn’t want something more with Blaise. We’d been getting into fights for a while now.” Harry immediately thought back to that first night in the bathroom. “He keeps wanting more from me. But I don’t have anything more to give.”
Draco’s eyes widen, “Your sure? This is a big step, we don’t have to…”. Without hesitation Harry responded, “yes”.
It was also at this point that Harry began to realize his two best friends were…more than friends. Harry knew this would happen eventually, but he also knew he wouldn’t be able to be around it right now. Hermione and Ron seemed to be around each other
Draco exhaled and heard a tap at the window. His eyes widened and his body froze. Without getting off the bed or sitting up he turned his head towards the window and saw a familiar owl with a letter…
“Yeah…he is cool. I just notice you’ve been hanging around him a lot more. So, I’ll ask again. Harry, do you like Dean Thomas? As more than a friend…?”
Two weeks went by. Two weeks of Charlie catching Harry looking at him. Sometimes, Charlie would play up to it. When he knew Harry was watching – like after a game of pick-up Quidditch - Charlie would catch Harry staring as they headed back into the Burrow and would slowly decide to remove his shirt. He would watch as Harry’s mouth fell open and he would watch as Harry looked around nervously and tried to re-compose himself. Charlie would smirk to himself and head back inside for a long shower.
“She’s right Harry. It doesn’t matter what job I have, how much I keep my head down, how well I raise my son, or who I choose to have as a partner…people will always see me as a Death Eater. And who on Earth would give a child to a Death Eater…?” Draco still sounded too quiet for Harry. Almost like he was defeated.
Draco spoke with so much passion that he would actually end up sweating a little bit and it would gather at the top of his hair line. He would move his arms and body around to explain certain spells and potions to Harry and Harry listened intently. Harry was enjoying his conversation so much that he soon found himself yawning and wanting to lie down.
Apparently that was the wrong thing for Draco to say because talk about it he DID. Draco heard everything. But to his credit, his upbringing taught him it was rude to make faces while someone was speaking. So, he sat and listened with a neutral expression on his face. He only made a face twice – once when Harry said he was gay and once when Harry went in
And the comment about Scorpius’ mom… is that what the child thinks? What exactly had Draco told his son? Probably not much, but kids can take stories in many different ways…
you know about me. I will not be speaking to him for you. You will be convicted. Because you are guilty. And you will stay here and rot away until you die the death you deserve.”
“Exactly…” Harry understood – he really did. He wasn’t expecting this tonight and he hadn’t really thought any of this through. Harry once again began to make his way towards the door, “Goodnight Draco.”
Harry apparated to Diagon Alley and tried to remember where Twlifit and Tattings was located. He had never been in there himself, but he knew people like Draco shopped there. Which basically meant he would never need to go in there…
Their routine staring session at meals stopped completely. Mostly because Draco stopped showing up for meals. After two weeks, Harry began to feel uneasy about the absence. He decided that the next time he saw Draco – mostly like after Defense Against the Dark Arts later that day, he would try and talk with him.
Draco smiled, “Uh yeah – I think you did. Don’t tell me you’re trying to hook me up with a Weasley, Potter. I may have changed, but I have standards.” Draco knew this sounded rude but hoped Harry would catch the joke.
Draco. This is the same Draco. Right? He had just changed…or maybe he was always like this, but we were too busy in the middle of a war to see it?
His godfathers did not try to talk to Harry like his parents had. Instead, they let him be. They figured whatever Harry was dealing with, he would tell them when he was ready.
As Draco led them further into the home, Harry took full advantage of walking behind the father. He noticed Draco was once again in muggle jeans that tightly wrapped around his ass and he wore another fitted shirt, but this one felt more formal and definitely more Malfoy. It was probably expensive, and Harry was feeling a little under-dressed.
The rest of the conversations leading up to his return to school continued in much the same way. A reminder of how
“Well, isn’t that wonderful Teddy. I’m glad you and Harry have made a new…friend.” Hermione’s grin was wicked in that moment. “Now run along and go up to Rose’s room.” Teddy took off towards the staircase still talking about Scorpius…to no one in particular.
Getting out of bed caused Draco to feel equal parts excited and fearful. He thought back to Harry from last night and remembered…Harry wanted him. Like, actually wanted him. But he also remembered that Harry planned on telling people. Namely Hermione and Ron… What would happen if they didn’t approve? Harry seemed pretty sure on Draco last night, but what if talking with his best friends causes him to see how terrible of an idea this is. And it is terrible…right?
to continue this, I think I should head back to the Burrow. I kind of left in the middle of a conversation and didn’t tell anyone I was leaving…”
“’Night”. Harry looked up at the moving posters, smiled and turned on his side. He drifted off to sleep that night with a permanent smile on his face.
“Sure!” He realized very quickly how that sounded and corrected himself, “I mean – yeah, that sounds good. Teddy is with Hermione and Ron for the night so…I have nowhere to be.” Draco smiled and the two made their way out of the pub and into the back alley (making sure to not be seen) before apparating to the Manor.
Harry actually…didn’t. He found some girls pretty, like Hermione or Cho Chang (who was now dating Cedric Diggory). But he didn’t have a strong interest in
But they knew this couldn’t last forever. After their month of bliss in the tower, their world came crashing down.
Draco noticed the members of the table exchange looks, but he dismissed them and quickly turned to follow Harry.
“Yes! Because I have a plan.” Harry felt his lips curl into a smirk. In reality, he had been thinking about this plan for the past month.
“Stori and I were just talking about the first Christmas we spent together.” Draco looked from Harry to Astoria before continuing, “…it was terrible!” The two busted out laughing and Harry felt out of place, so he politely smiled.
Draco smiled back, “Great – awesome. That’s...good then. A date.” Harry listened as the man babbled again and all the while thought,
Harry honestly felt it did. It made a lot of sense. But he couldn’t help but wonder why he had never seen two women together or another couple like his Sirius and Remus. Part of him figured other people were like them, maybe he just had to wait until he was older.
“And as I already said, Potter, I have no interest in talking with you. Much less going anywhere with you. So…” Draco looked up at Harry and met his eyes. “You can leave.”
“Nothing I guess. Let’s just continue being…us.” Draco’s response made Harry calmer, but he knew it wasn’t that simple. Draco must have known this too because he continued, “Look. It won’t be easy, but people
“We are going to play at Scorpius’ house on Saturday.” He thought his godson was going to faint. But instead watched as the boy’s hair color changed fifteen times in a single minute before finally calming back down to its dusty brown.
Another month went by. Another month of Harry going to classes, doing homework, going to Quidditch practice, and avoiding Draco. Harry felt he was getting…better. He was thinking of Draco
“Oh, he is. That’s how he was raised. Proper and charming.” She shot her son a smile and was met with cold eyes on the other side of the table.
Draco were already there when the woke up, huh?” Ron looked at his best friend knowingly. “And how was it that Draco was there so early?”
Harry went back to his room but couldn’t stop thinking about the incident. His mind kept turning over, what was Draco crying about? Draco Malfoy didn’t cry…
“This was….nice. Could we meet-up again sometime?” Harry asked in what he thought was a cool manner, but actually came out a bit nervous.
As much as he was somewhat dreading returning to Hogwarts with the rest of the students from his year, it was a step-up from his current situation. So, when he received his letter from McGonagall, he was more than happy to read it and accept.
Draco was also smart, kind, and surprisingly funny. He liked to read books and tell Harry about them in great detail. Then, when Harry looked bored, Draco would quickly jump up and say something like, “I will have order Potter!” in his best Umbridge impression. It didn’t sound anything like the woman, but Harry laughed just the same.
Quidditch (even more than Ron and Harry!). He would make them practice for hours and hours, day after day – Harry didn’t mind. He would give these stirring speeches before each match and Harry made sure to be front and center and listened very closely. He hung on every word the boy said.
At first, this made Harry uncomfortable and unsure. He went back and forth between elated that it was out and anxious about what it all would mean. He hadn’t been ‘out’ about a relationship of his since Ginny…
“I’m fine Hermione, really. I don’t know what you’re implying, but I’m great! Now, go take care of your boyfriend. He thinks you’ll get mad if he drinks too much tonight.” Hermione gave Harry a smile and stood to leave.
On the day Draco was set to leave, Harry came and surprised him on a Tuesday. He took the day off saying he knew Draco would need someone with him. And Draco did. He cried harder than he had at any point in the past two years. Possibly harder than he even did the first night he stayed on the farm. It took him so long to leave because he went up to each and every animal he had to say a personal goodbye.
With only a couple of days left before his return to Hogwarts, Harry decided to come out to his parents. He knew they would be okay with it, but part of him was still very nervous. There’s a difference between your best friends being gay and your own son.
“Of course not! Harry, I don’t care what you are. We’ve been friends since we could walk – you think I’d ever let you get away?”
They were all met with quite a scene. Blaise was yelling and throwing hexes at Draco, who was attempting to speak but was too busy putting up protection spells for himself.
“Mmm, I see.” Harry stood up from the chair he had been occupying across the room and started making his way towards Draco.
, after I left Azkaban things were quite different as you probably know. My father was in prison, my mother was…not well, and I just…couldn’t be there anymore. I didn’t…deserve to be there anymore.” Draco got quiet on the last words.
Oliver took a drink of eggnog before answering, “Yes sir. With my build, keeper’s the best position for me I believe.”
The thoughts of what Harry had been doing just before this letter arrived caused a flush to creep up his neck as he prepared to respond back.
If his father wanted to comment on the Draco situation, he didn’t. The only person who brought it up was his mother.
Harry allowed himself to flirt back. Some strange part of him still felt like he was somehow cheating on Draco. But he guessed that was the same part that thought he’d wake up tomorrow and the two of them would still be together…
Harry stressed all night about how he was going to tell his parents about Oliver coming while also remembering his dad was expecting Draco. Honestly, he knew his dad would be happy to hear that Draco wouldn’t be there…but he didn’t know how he’d take Oliver coming.
When he opened his eyes, he found a wide-eyed Harry staring back at him. Draco didn’t want to speak and break whatever it was that was happening, so he just stared at Harry as Harry stared back.
“No, Ron. I can’t. There are some things I can’t talk to YOU about.” Harry saw realization dawn on Ron’s face.
“Oh…right. So, do you think everything Harry said about Charlie was true? I mean, it looked true…especially the way Charlie reacted. But how could all of that have happened without us knowing?” Hermione looked at Ron.
for once and his alone. He relished in the idea of being the only auror in the family and took it as a great honor (boasting and bragging about it every change he got).
“Good. Now, I do think you should go back to your room.” Charlie watched Harry’s face fall. “Not because I don’t want to do anything with you, but because it is late and it’s been a very long and…loud day.”
They sat in an odd silence until luckily, Dean and Seamus came to cut the tension. Draco noticed as the two boys approached the table hand-in-hand and felt a strange feeling enter his stomach…envy?
The next day, as Harry walked into Charms – he noticed a note in his seat. It wasn’t addressed to anyone, but he figured if it was in his seat, it had to be for him.
On the next Saturday, Harry did not arrive at Malfoy Manor. Draco assumed he just needed more time. But when he still did not arrive the Saturday after – Draco sent an owl. The letter was simple, direct. He just wanted to check on Harry and make sure he knew they could still hang out and be friends. When he didn’t get a response, he kept writing.
Harry tried to push the thoughts away but, for Draco, it was all he could think about. And rightfully so.
“Shit Draco…I’m sorry. Of course, you already know that – it was stupid of me to say. Especially sitting here whining about
“Here it is.” Draco echoed Harry before continuing, “I guess there would be no point in denying it.”
Draco let out another exhale, “I didn’t want it anymore. I regretted getting married the minute it happened. It was like something washed over me after the wedding. It suddenly hit me - I was free. I wasn’t in Azkaban. I fought and survived a damn war, I deserved to be free. So…I told Stori. I told her I was gay and that I wanted a divorce. That’s when she told me she was pregnant. She wanted me to stay; I told her I couldn’t. I knew it was selfish, but I needed to live my life.”
By the time Draco made his way into the common room most of the eighth years had already gone into their respective rooms and were unpacking. He decided to make his way to the Great Hall for breakfast before everyone got down there.
talking about and those things were going to have to come up eventually. But, maybe just not right now.
I’m slowly but surely working on this piece! I am determined to see it through. As always, comments/kudos welcome!
Even as Harry said this to his godson, he didn’t believe it. He would never stop bringing Teddy here. The way his face lit up when he said they were going, the way he bounced on his feet while they waited, and the way the boy took
Harry was at Malfoy Manor with Teddy on a Sunday morning, as was custom by now, when they heard someone trying to get through the wards. Draco opened the door to see a grubby-looking man outside the gates holding papers. Draco went down to the gate to retrieve them, but when he came back, he was pale.
Skeeter needs to find better things to write about than people’s personal lives. It’s absurd!” Hermione was raising her voice and Harry could tell Ron was concerned about waking up Rose.
When Draco and Scorpius arrived at Grimmauld Place, Harry forced his anxiety down. Thankfully, Teddy hadn’t brought up Draco and his ‘relationship’ since last weekend, but Harry was still having a lot of thoughts and feelings about the possibility. When Draco and Scorpius came into the house, Harry found himself staring again. Merlin, that man can really walk into a room.
Harry continued the kiss and straddled Draco – their chests touching. Draco pushed his hips up once again to gain friction and once again felt his lips abandoned.
“You don’t have a house elf?” Draco asked as he took a sip of his drink before returning the glass to the table.
“You are a hero, Harry. And trust me, that’s not the only reason they want you.” Draco felt his face flush. He needed to stop himself. The conversation was venturing into dangerous territory.
“Take your tea Draco.” Draco looked to his right and saw a beautiful cup of tea sitting on a glass saucer floating in the air. He moved to take the tea and the saucer disappeared. “Drink Draco”. Draco moved to bring the cup to his mouth but caught a strange look from his father. He tried to take a sip of the tea and move it back to his lap but felt he couldn’t. The cup wouldn’t leave his lips. The tea burned his mouth as it went down, and he was forced to drink and drink until all the tea was gone.
“Yes. We’ve moved into the Burrow shortly after I got custody of him and needed the help…greatly. But we moved back to Grimmauld a couple of years ago and it’s just us now.”
“But don’t you worry your pretty little head about it, Potter. I’ll get him back.” Draco winked and Harry felt his neck heat up again. Harry took this as his cue to leave.
This was the first time his father attempted to contact him since their last meeting. Draco opened the letter and began to read –
On Saturdays, Harry would apparate to the Manor. Sometimes they would have lunch with Narcissa, sometimes it was just the two of them. Harry was growing fond of the Malfoy matron, but relished the times it was just Draco and him.
“Well, I brought food. I figured we could…eat. Together. Preferably inside.” Harry nodded towards Draco’s cottage.
“Harry, what were we going to say? We knew you’d tell us when you were ready. And besides, that’s for you to discuss – not us.”
When Harry entered the Burrow, he had expected to be charged at and hexed by several red-headed Weasley children. Instead, he was met with silence. It appeared as though everyone was too drunk to yell and had instead gone to bed. Harry started to make his way towards the staircase but was stopped by someone sitting in the living room. “Harry.”
There was nothing for him to worry about. Draco had changed. He knew it had to be true. The man whose kitchen he stood in earlier today was definitely not the same man he went to school with. Or maybe he was, just…affected by a war…and a marriage.
“Right… makes sense. I’ve seen quite a bit of staring aimed at you since we’ve been back. And some…whispering. But I haven’t seen you interact with anyone.” Hermione gave him a pitiful look.
Harry stopped himself immediately. Absolutely not. This is not a road we are allowing ourselves to go down. Draco Malfoy most certainly does not look hot.
Draco smiled, “Luxley will get it.” And he moved towards Harry to start what looked like a continuation of last night.
, only to turn around and see nothing but his goats oddly lurking behind him. Draco was sure he would return. He even found himself almost…hoping he would.
Harry gave Draco a glance and was met with a stare that said, “didn’t want you to chicken out.” Along with another one of those chest-tightening smirks.
“Oh! Dear! So sorry!” They heard the voice of Leona Greengrass and they broke apart quickly. Harry felt embarrassed but noticed irritation on Draco’s face and felt the need to smirk a little.
he had a few years ago. And wondering how it took us so long to figure out he was gay.” Harry hit Ron in the stomach to get him to stop talking.
to do with his ability to be an amazing father. And he is – just that. Amazing. Scorpius loves him very
The boy nodded before returning to the food on his plate. They finished their dinner in near silence while Harry took the opportunity to process everything Teddy had just said. It was true. He didn’t get to play with other kids, but Harry never knew how to introduce him to other children – except for his cousins. He didn’t want to deal with their parents and bringing up the war and just…everything.
“Right…well, they never said being an auror was easy work.” Draco tried to make his tone sound light, but it still came out cross.
As soon as Marigold left, Harry immediately turned to Oliver. Most of the people from the match had disappeared by then and were going back to the castle for celebrations. Harry knew he and Oliver were the only ones left on the pitch but had a strange feeling they were being watched. Harry shook it off as paranoia and re-focused on the beautiful man in front of him.
of these thoughts, but he knew that if they were true (which, they were) that that would mean even more changes to come. This was both a terrifying and thrilling thought.
Draco was gone for what felt like forever. How long could this letter possibility be? Harry couldn’t eat and just moved food around on his plate while watching over the boys.
Harry kept trying to push Oliver towards the door, but his family kept wanting another hug or to say just one more thing. “Don’t be a stranger Oliver!” James wasn’t ready to let this man leave.
Harry wasn’t prepared for this response. He sat up on his elbow and looked at Draco who was smiling at him. “You agree? You’ll write? You promise?”
So, after a rather long day of watching George try and fail to create a firecracker that would only explode with a secret code word (which resulted in a lot of booming and banging in the shop), Charlie decided to make a move.
The TriWizard Tournament was, indeed, extremely dangerous. Each task left the impression that one of the champions’ lives would be in danger, but thankfully they all came out of it alive.
“Hermione. Please, just leave me alone.” Hermione backed out of the room as quietly as she had entered. She wanted to help Harry, but also knew he needed time to himself.
“I – I don’t know. But I wouldn’t put it past him to have someone at the school working for him. Some sort of informant, I imagine. But they must not be in the 8
Charlie spit out the small amount of Firewhisky that had just landed in his mouth. “Oh, I…I didn’t realize…does anyone know? I obviously won’t say anything, but I just haven’t heard anything about that.” Harry could tell Charlie had suddenly turned nervous.
Draco laughed again, “Oh, poor naïve Potter, you have to be going out to break up. No, Blaise and I were strictly friends with benefits, with heavy
“Mmm – so that comment about knowing a lot about me…what? That’s just because you talk about all of your teammates when you come home for holidays?” Oliver wasn’t giving up.
That was the end of their conversation. But it certainly wasn’t the end of Hermione. She continued to sit there for the rest of the day and came back every day that week. She never spoke. Just pulled out a chair, sat down, and took out her books.
“Oh, you didn’t have to get me something Oliver. I-I feel terrible. I didn’t get you anything.” Harry was getting nervous. He could feel a lot of eyes on the two of them. Oliver didn’t seem to mind or notice.
Oh, that was something else that had changed. After much discussion, Charlie decided to leave his dragons. He insisted it wouldn’t be forever, but he told his boss at the sanctuary that after the war and the loss of his brother, he couldn’t be away from his family any longer. He was gone so much for the past 7 years and had missed so many memories with the family. With Fred’s passing, he decided to step-up and be the big brother he needed to be for George. He offered to come help him re-open the store and after much
“Oh…Hermione taught him that that was the way he was supposed to refer to my…um, significant others. I’m bisexual, so it covers if I’m with a man or a woman…” Harry’s face flushed, and he grew uncomfortable. He wasn’t ashamed of his sexuality, but he wasn’t sure how Draco was going to respond…
He learned that Slytherin house was small. Very small. Several people didn’t return (even in the younger years) and very few first years were sorted into the house at all. Draco assumed this had to do with their involvement during the war and the new-found prejudice towards the house, but once again, Draco didn’t mind. It meant fewer people were trying to talk to him during meals. And by fewer, he meant none.
The Patil sisters quickly realized that neither Harry nor Ron were happy to be there with them. They left them as soon as they could, and Harry didn’t really blame them.
“Yes.” He knew he was being a prat but couldn’t help himself. He had no intention of answering this man’s questions.
– he decided to leave certain parts to just he and his godfathers. Harry tried not to look at his parents while he spoke, instead choosing to focus on the floor or a wall.
Draco could look in any direction from his home and see no one and nothing. His nearest neighbor wasn’t for miles. It was simply him, his cows, his horses, and his sheep. No people. Just how he liked it.
“Are you…Harry Potter?” The boy asked incredulously. Great, Harry thought, not even safe from toddlers.
Once Harry was on the team, he soon became enamored with the Gryffindor Quidditch captain. He felt this boy was simply…amazing. Oliver Wood
“No Draco, he said really terrible things about you. He aired a lot of your personal business to the whole school…I would have done much worse to him. Trust me.” Draco thought back to their incident in third year.
Harry made sure to avoid Charlie as much as possible for the next two weeks. He was doing a great job of it. He would wake up early and go into town to “shop” and return only in time for dinner and bed. He decided to spend his time in town talking with Kingsley about possible jobs. He knew that once Charlie left he would need something to occupy his time. Otherwise, that feeling in his chest might consume him and kill him…Okay, he was being pretty dramatic about the whole thing. Which is why he took careful steps to distance himself and attempt to allow himself time to deal with all of the feelings that had been bubbling up for the past 6 months.
“I can’t take care of you all the time Harry. I have other shite going on, you know? You should have told me you were telling them, Harry.”
When they arrived back to Hogwarts, Harry couldn’t contain his excitement. He spent the train ride catching up with people and couldn’t get to Draco. As soon as they started their walk into Hogwarts, he quickly scoured the heads around him for blonde. When he finally locked on eyes on him, he rushed over. Before seeing Harry, Harry could tell Draco had a hardened look on his face. Harry was nervous to approach the man but had waited too long to see him to NOT run up and kiss him.
Harry couldn’t have that. “Hey! Look at me! Stop that. It’s okay.” Harry grabbed Draco again and began stroking his back before he felt Draco pull back and continue with the letter.
Draco and Harry met-up for the next two weekends up until Harry’s first day at the Ministry. Harry knew he would start to get busy with work and so he and Draco decided to owl each other and schedule a day for Harry to come to the Manor in the next few weeks once he got settled.
Back in the pub, Harry was holding a glass of water. He felt as if he had blacked out. He couldn’t remember who gave him the water or when he had moved to the bar instead of his table. That’s when a cool hand touched his back…oh, that’s right, Draco is here.
But Scorpius had been to Scotland a few times by now and Draco was getting better. He knew Scorpius would come back. And every time he did, he was happy and healthy. He was happy about being home and he seemed to rather enjoy his time with his mother.
The rest of that summer was tense. Draco and his father had several long, drawn-out discussions about his late-night activities. But strangely, the name Harry Potter wasn’t brought up once.
A year ago, he would have jumped at the opportunity. Took it as a badge of honor and felt special to be included. But as he sat at the table, something didn’t feel right. If he did this, if he took the mark, then that would be it. His fate would be sealed. He would forever be associated with these people who had infiltrated his home. The people who made Draco’s blood curl and his entire being uncomfortable.
He even went to Hogsmeade with Oliver and he helped him pick out new gloves for the upcoming match against Hufflepuff. Harry and Oliver were slowly becoming…friends? Well, they were kind of friends before, but this was different. Harry and Oliver in the past had been more like…Oliver and his much younger teammate, Harry. But now the four years didn’t feel like so much. This felt…equal.
After the dinner, Harry expected a fight to break out the next day. Paperwork to come, more banging at the door…something. But nothing happened. And as the days went by it became more and more confusing. Where was she? Did she leave? But she said ‘we’ll see Draco’ as if she fully intended to be back and fight for Scorpius.
“I’m not exactly sure when it changed. I’ve been trying to think about that for a while now and my best guess is sixth year. When I saw you in the bathroom…” Harry looked back down at his hands and Draco felt an uncomfortable tension fill the air.
. My family decided to travel this holiday and I’ve never had a steady enough boyfriend to spend holidays with. So, here I am. I’m just thankful Harry pitied me enough to invite me – it’s really kind of you and your family to invite me into your home.” Oliver smiled. Lily was beaming.
Draco had decided weeks ago that of all of the people to talk with about the ‘father issue’, Hermione would be it. She had reacted well to Harry and Draco’s relationship, she was even the first to befriend him at the start of the year, and she was, even if it pained him to say it, the smartest in their year…possibly in the whole school.
“But-but what about Oliver…” Harry heard the sadness in his father’s voice at the loss of his super star possible son-in-law.
“Dear. I don’t care anything about that. Like I said, I care about your safety and your happiness. You deserve love, Harry. After all you’ve been through, you deserve all of the love in the world and I don’t care who it’s with, so long as they give it to you.”
“I don’t know…we haven’t talked since it happened. But Ron wanted me to go. He said the Weasleys are still my family, but I knew it would be awkward…so I stayed.” Harry kept his eyes on his hands before continuing, “What about you?”. On this Harry looked up to Draco.
But logical, rational Harry was always overshadowed by emotional Harry saying, “You’re not worth someone’s love. No one wants to be with you. Draco just wants to be friends. He doesn’t see you as anything more, just like Charlie. You fall in love too easily and this is your punishment. You’re doomed to hurt forever.” Harry knew he was being dramatic again, but still he couldn’t pull himself to move past it. He had felt more for the two men in his life than he ever did for any of the girls he had ever dated or thought he
The three men, well James really, continued to grill Oliver. Harry grew nervous as the conversation made its way to Oliver’s personal life. His mother had just entered the room and asked, “So, Oliver, Harry has told us that you didn’t have anywhere to go. That’s so sad – I’m so very sorry. Where is your family at? No special someone to spend your holiday with?” Lily looked as if she didn’t mean to ask the last question.
Draco’s life is what he would now call, comfortable. He doesn’t own much because he doesn’t need nor deserve much. There are times in which he reflects back on his past life and thinks about all of the material possessions he once owned. They were beautiful. But now, that feels like another time…another person.
“An inspired choice. I think I might have one of the same. Wait right here with your father and I’ll be right back.” Draco moved to stand up and moved his eyes towards the other father for the first time.
Draco snapped his attention back to Harry before relaxing his face, “You’re right, you’re pretty awful.” Harry was taken aback by the comment, but saw Draco crack a smile – so Harry returned it. The smiles quickly turned into outright laughter on both of their parts.
The men took their time with each other, completely forgetting the outside world and wrapping themselves up in one another. After what seemed like hours, and honestly probably was, both men drifted off to sleep.
Charlie told his family the news in more or less the same way he told Harry (without some parts obviously). The family reacted rather well. Percy and Bill had stayed late at work – Charlie would probably tell them later. Ron continued to eat and with a mouthful of potatoes said “Okay”. “We will miss you Charlie, but I expect you’re missing the excitement”, Hermione smiled politely from across the table. Harry wondered if Charlie had already written to Ginny at Hogwarts about it. Charlie and George must have been talking about this for a while because George merely remarked “Okay, but don’t think those dragons will be nearly as cool as the dragon-roasted mints I just developed! They make fire shoot out your nose!”
“No bother – there are loads in the quidditch storage room. We’ll just grab one from there. Come on!” Harry stood to leave, and Draco began to follow suit.
Harry felt tears swelling up in his eyes and pushed them back down. The two decided to end on that note and walk back inside. When Hermione saw them enter the common room, she rushed them and pulled them into a big hug. Her arms lingered on Ron a bit too long before she pulled away completely before saying, “See Harry! I told you Ron wouldn’t care!”
“What the bloody hell does that mean? Much less mine? Am I that terrible and unlovable that you could never see yourself with me?!” Harry felt his all of his insecurities from the past several months rising to the surface. He tried to push them down, but they continued to bubble up.
Harry watched as Draco’s face went through a myriad of expressions before settling on frustrated but surprisingly calm, “He isn’t here.”
He also remembered being fifteen years old and laying in his bed at the Manor and thinking about Harry Potter. He remembers those being some of his best memories… He, of course, remembers the sexual fantasies that started, but almost as if blocked from his memory and only now coming back, he actually remembers a faint feeling of hope. Hope or longing… Longing that maybe one day this boy, Harry, would feel the same way Draco did…
“That doesn’t make any sense. I didn’t even know I was bisexual back then. I couldn’t have been flirting with him. He was just…up to something. And I needed to figure it out.” Harry tried to defend himself but knew it was likely useless.
“Oh – I didn’t even think about it like that…” Draco tried to calm himself down. Harry was ignorant, it wasn’t his fault.
Sirius made a noise and Harry shot him a look. He was met with his godfather giving him a wink. Harry rolled his eyes and tried to steer the conversation back to a safer topic.
“True, but she’s your girlfriend, right? I imagine you must be pretty lonely here without her or your other friends.” Harry looked down at the ground.
“Yeah, but at least Voldemort wasn’t trying to shag either one of us.” There was silence, but soon Draco couldn’t keep in the laugh – it came tumbling out of him.
“Hello Teddy. My name is Draco, and this is my son Scorpius. Why don’t you talk to him while I go inside and get you a both an ice cream? Let’s see…what did we have? Based on the colors and the smell…I’m guessing – blueberry, banana, and…caramel?”
Draco looked back at Voldemort and felt a familiar chill run down his spine. This was what true fear feels like.
“Fine.” And with a roll of his eyes he stomped away, Harry following close behind. Even from in front of him, he could swear he sensed a smile enter the man’s face.
And of course, he’s thinking of his father. It pains Draco to think of this man sometimes. There were good memories at some point, he knows there were…but in this moment, he’s struggling to remember them. He can only remember the cold eyes staring at him through the door way, the way his father said ‘We will kill Harry Potter’, and the way his father clung to the bars of his cell in Azkaban pleading for Draco to talk to Harry for him.
On one of these nights, the two had stayed up until 2 in the morning talking. They talked about Dean’s family and what it was like growing up in the muggle world. They talked about Harry’s fame and how difficult it was growing up with that surrounding you. Over the course of the evening, the two had gotten rather close next to the fire that kept dying out, only for Dean to bring it back to life.
“No, I caught the way they look at you. I even heard some of the younger women talking about you when I waited for you outside the feed store. They think you’re handsome and…” Harry placed his index finger on his chin as if to signal he was thinking, but really Draco knew it was to pretend to be cute, “I think the word they used was…mysterious?” And there was that attractive, yet annoying grin again.
“Leona, as you can see, Harry is here to pick up Teddy. Everyone is fine, you can go.” Draco started to usher the woman towards the door with an annoyed look on his face.
“So, you like red heads? That part is obvious.” Draco smirked and Harry felt the need to defend himself.
“I see…and where is this little one’s mother?” Harry realized he might have overstepped when he saw the little boy’s eyes grow sad and Draco looked towards him quickly.
She gave a half smile before continuing, “Yes, I think that’s for the best. Then we can work as a team to figure this out, okay?” Draco returned the half smile and saw the witch was preparing to continue speaking. “But Draco… I do have to ask…”
As Draco made his way to the eighth-year dorm and towards Harry’s room he couldn’t help but notice the increase in stares he was receiving since sitting with the Golden Trio for meals. Just when he thought the whispers had died down, they sparked back up. On several occasions he had walked to classes the past week and heard ‘death eater’ and ‘murderer’ murmured under the breaths of students. It no longer seemed as though he could keep keeping to himself. Students were growing more brazen and it was becoming harder not to react.
Blaise continued, “I’ve tried for so long with you Draco. But I am done! I’m not going to listen to you go on about him anymore. And I’m certainly not going to stick around while we try and pretend like you didn’t say his name yesterday while we were…” Blaise didn’t even get to the finish his sentence, though everyone in the entry way knew what he was going to say. That was it. That was what did it. Draco threw the largest hex Harry had ever seen.
“Well, Oliver, what have you been up to? I feel like I knew everything about you four years ago, but now…nothing.” Sirius shot Harry a knowing smirk before turning back to Oliver.
The boys eventually woke up and Draco and Scorpius made their way home. Draco told Harry he would write to him to set something up. The two men moved forward as if they were going to kiss before Draco left, but stopped themselves quickly and looked at the two younger boys – who they found were staring at them.
him that I actually want to be with you and he still couldn’t…deal with it.” Draco hated how much he understood Ron in this moment.
“Oliver and I were never together, dad. And I’m sorry that Draco isn’t what you wanted, but like I told you before – if you get to know him, I know you’d really like him.” Draco felt uncomfortable. Harry was speaking as though he wasn’t there. So, he decided to make himself known.
Draco returned to Hogwarts for his fifth year and intended to do as he was told. He would keep his head down, focus on his schoolwork, and his…future. The fact that he needed a wife and an heir never escaped his mind. He had known it his whole life. But strangely, while he was engaging in his
But Harry was persistent and by the fourth weekend things were running much smoother. Hermione and Draco soon bonded over schoolwork – a conversation Harry and Ron were happy to be left out of. Draco and Ron were more difficult to get past, but once Draco brought up Quidditch, Ron was sold. Harry had told Draco ahead of time that Ron’s favorite team was the Chudley Canons and while they were easily the worst team in the league, Draco still pretended like they were “one of his favorites”. He even went so far as to throw in, “they just haven’t had their year yet”. This planted a permanent smile on Ron’s face and kept him talking for hours.
He laid in bed that night in disbelief – his own father had used a truth serum on him. His father now knew Draco’s deepest, darkest secret. Not only did he like boys… he liked one boy in particular. Probably the one boy he shouldn’t like more than all the others.
“Would you…would you want to come back to the Manor with me? Scorpius is with Leona for the night….” Draco seemed nervous to ask, but Harry was all too willing to go.
Coming back that year, Harry would catch himself looking at Dean while he studied in the common room. He liked the way he bit at the end of his quill while he was working. He liked the way he crossed his feet but tapped them at the same time even if no music was playing.
They approached the porch and started towards the door. Draco put his hand on the handle and took a deep breath. He was beginning to realize that no one other than himself or Billy had ever actually been inside… He swallowed any pride he had left and pushed the door open.
reached the counter, they were greeted with a now too familiar face. “Mr. Teddy! Mr. Scorpius! What can I get for you today?” As the boys began to speak, the wizard paused them. “Wait, wait! Let me guess…hmmm… I do believe Mr. Scorpius will have the…strawberry tart with…sweet vanilla and…whipped cream on top!” The wizard looked down at a wide-eyed Scorpius.
Dean, being the sweet man he was, asked “…is it to a boy…or…a girl?”. Without missing a beat, Hermione and Ginny spoke at the same time.
He tried to act nonchalant, taking off his boots and motioning around to show various areas. “That’s the kitchen, obviously. Dining area, living room, and back there is my bedroom and bathroom.” Draco tried his hardest not to look at Harry as the man looked around but couldn’t help it.
“Hermione…” Draco whispered out into the library even though he really didn’t need to. They sat so far back that no one would even know they were there if it hadn’t been for their pile of books coming and going from the table.
Draco sat for a while and took-in everything she had to say. He knew she was right, but he also knew that telling Harry would surely cause panic and anger. Harry would want to know why he wasn’t told sooner and what he needed to do to help. He probably wouldn’t catch on to things the way Hermione did, so Draco felt his past secrets were probably safe.
Harry saw Draco’s eyes light up, “Wait a minute. Wait a damn minute! Is the Boy-Who-Lived actually…gay?! I knew it!” Harry was strangely happy to see Draco smiling, but the smile quickly faded as he took another drink.
Harry needed to make arrangements for Teddy and as much as he was dreading having a conversation with Ron and Hermione about
, she never stopped yelling. Harry knew she meant well, but he just couldn’t stand to hear one more time how, ”He should never have played with you like that Harry! It’s simply barbaric! He should have told you!”. And Ron wasn’t any better. Ron stayed silent for the most part, but Harry knew it was because he was holding back an “I told you, mate”.
“I knew you were hiding it from us. I told you you could talk to us. I told you you didn’t have to keep talking to him, Harry.” Ron was pleading at this point and Harry was growing annoyed.
Harry took a moment to process everything that was said, “You sound like you cared for him a lot. It must have hurt when he said he wanted a divorce.” Harry genuinely meant that.
He had done terrible things. He didn’t deserve the Manor, his family fortunes, or even a life. He had to leave. And as much as he detested muggles as a child, he knew they couldn’t be all that bad. Anything had to be better than living in the wizarding world for another minute.
“Ah – I see.” Harry didn’t really see. He had taken special precautions after the war to not let it be known he owned Grimmauld Place. But Draco obviously was avoiding the topic, interesting…
“I like their orange jerseys too Scorpius.” Harry smiled at the younger boy and watched as he got closer to the edge of the box to watch the match. Harry and Draco hung back and watched the two boys, noses pressed against the glass and on their tiptoes. Harry turned to look at Draco and found he was already looking at him. The two moved closer and pressed lips against one another. They were both very aware of where they were and who they were with and kept it chaste.
And they were right. The day before he was set to go back to his parents, Harry couldn’t help himself. All of the thoughts and feelings that he had been bottling up over the summer were ready to spill out. While the three of them sat in silence eating dinner, Harry spoke. “How did you guys know you were gay?”
Harry forced himself to interact with his family and went to the Burrow on several occasions over the break. He ate meals, opened gifts, and flew around on his broom…all the while thinking about Draco. As stupid as he felt, he hoped Draco was thinking about him too.
As soon as they were through the door Teddy took off towards the backroom while Harry yelled after him, “Be careful!” and turned his attention back to the witch from the door.
to say. “Draco, I want us to write to each other this summer. I know we said there were complications and I know we aren’t ready to tell our fathers, but I don’t think I can go a whole summer without hearing from you.”
But Hermione didn’t answer. Draco began to fill his plate and just stared back and forth between the couple.
“Yeah, well….” Harry wanted to get out of his conversation as quickly as possible and attempted to move around Charlie.
Draco figured Hermione would say something eventually. They weren’t friends, far from it actually, but he knew this girl pretty well. She was intelligent and determined. If she wanted something, she would work to get it. And she’d be clever about it.
“Yeah well, I typically go to the Burrow for Christmas. But with everything that happened with Ginny…I don’t know. I just didn’t feel right…” Harry finished and looked down at his hands in his lap.
Draco threw himself on the bed and was continuing his internal conflict when he heard a tap at the window. He rose up and noticed an owl with a letter. He didn’t recognize the owl, but he recognized the writing on the outside…his father.
this would happen. Even when we were together? You knew you’d be getting married.” Harry didn’t understand any of this.
all break! I came out about us to my parents and you weren’t there to talk to! You’ve avoided me since we’ve been back – you couldn’t even
“Well, honestly mate, I’m relieved. I’ve been waiting a long time for you to like someone. I mean, I personally think it’s weird you ended up liking someone we’ve shared a room with since we were 11, but…I guess I can’t really talk”. Ron looked down and Harry knew Ron was thinking about Hermione.
Draco opened his door with no robe and began to venture down to the common room. Once there, he found the fire already going and Harry sitting in the same spot as earlier – back against the sofa, feet to the fire. Just sitting and staring into the fire.
, okay? I’m not going to break up with him or anything. I love him. So I need you two to help me figure out how to tell mum and dad…and to tell me I’m not going crazy.”
Harry thought his father was going to cry right then and there. “Harry’s going to play professional Quidditch…?”
“I’m around enough. We share a dormitory, several classes, and now the same table for meals. I notice things.” He had a point. They did seem to be around each other a lot lately. And Potter had noticed…
Anytime Draco had to scold Scorpius for something or put him in time-out, Harry knew that Draco would come and find Harry and needed to be told he was a good father and that it was okay to get onto Scorpius for doing a bad thing.
But he had heard nothing since then. He just assumed Draco chose to keep a low profile. He imagined the man had married some pureblood witch and carried on the Malfoy name. Which, he guessed, technically he did. Even with the trials and his father going to Azkaban, the family was still obscenely wealthy.
These were the comments that scared Harry growing up. He didn’t want to be evil. He wanted to be Harry.
the Canons playing? I really don’t want my son to be subjected to this level of quidditch…” Harry was about to respond back but was cut off by Scorpius.
“Of that I am sure.” Harry remarked before letting out a laugh. “We’ll meet you in the common room in 20”.
As he stood, he heard Draco whine. “Help me up Potter! You can’t just leave me like this.” Harry extended his hand out and Malfoy took it – hoisting himself up in the air. The two walked towards the door to the bathroom, “See you around Potter” Draco winked and stumbled out and began to walk towards the dungeons.
“Then, then why Draco? Why put yourself through this?” The more Harry talked to Draco the more he missed him. He knew he shouldn’t be in here and it wasn’t good for him to be having this conversation, but he didn’t care.
“So….so you’re okay with me? Being gay?” Harry didn’t know how much of this conversation Molly would be comfortable with, so he decided to keep going, but proceeded with caution.
The months between the drunken night at the pub and his party went by very slowly. He tried to spend as much time asleep in his room as possible, but also felt he owed several people an explanation and an apology.
“No. I have food inside though…for dinner.” Draco knew this was a borderline lie. He was still struggling greatly, and food had taken a back seat to the expenses it took to run this place.
The Chosen One’s words must hold power because Draco was let out with stipulations. He wasn’t allowed to leave his house for the remainder of the summer and was due to repeat his final year at Hogwarts before being allowed to enter the work force or pursue a higher degree.
This was a solid plan, until George decided to make the going-away celebration a reality. Harry tried on many occasions to get out of it, but every time George or Ron or both would respond with “Mate! Everyone will be there! We are going to a new wizard pub in London – Hermione, Seamus, Dean, Lee, Ginny, everyone!”. Harry eventually said he would go, but made it clear he would NOT be staying late. Hermione gave him a look that reeked of pity and knowing. She had been giving him this look for the past 2 weeks. Anytime someone mentioned Charlie leaving, Hermione would LOOK at him. He decided to leave it alone lest he discover Hermione
Harry couldn’t help but notice the seriousness in his voice and sat up straight. “Is…is everything okay?”
Harry continued the kiss and followed Draco as Draco moved Harry on his back. The two continued in this position until Harry pulled back and looked at Draco – taking him in. “Draco…I think I’m ready”.
Draco hesitated before speaking, “I – I hoped she would.” Harry didn’t know why, but that response made his heart fall.
Draco watched as Harry stopped laughing and begin to take in the sight in front of him. Draco quickly felt self-conscious and regretted not bringing his robe. He saw Harry’s eyes roam over his chest and eventually find his dark mark.
“I heard what happened…with you and Draco…I’m sorry.” Dean alternated between looking at Harry and looking down at the fire.
Everyone had turned to look at Harry. Harry felt…nothing. His whole body was numb. His brain was blank except for the words ‘Draco’, ‘married’, and ‘girl’.
Silence hung in the air for several minutes while Draco composed his thoughts. Harry Potter…liked guys. Harry Potter liked…him. He started thinking more about it. It just didn’t make sense…he and Harry hated each other. They always had…right?
Charlie had wanted to talk first and make sure Harry was absolutely sure before they went any further.  Harry assured him he was indeed ready (and he was!). When the time came, it was actually quite perfect. They had waited for everyone to go to bed and for the house to be quiet (or as quiet as the Burrow could get). Charlie cast multiple spells on the door to ensure they wouldn’t be heard or disturbed.
“Okay dad. I’m really sorry…”. “I know son, I know”. James held his son in his arms and rocked him back and forth. There was more James wanted to say but knew he shouldn’t. The way Harry’s magic reacted wasn’t entirely normal. James knew Harry was a strong wizard, but he also knew Harry wasn’t ready to know that just yet.
he was cut off by the younger boy. “Daddy…that’s Harry Potter”, the child whispered to his father without looking at Harry.
Draco wrote to Harry that night and the two men decided it would be best if they spoke to their respective children separately, but with similar information. Some things would obviously be different, Teddy’s use of the word ‘partner’ for one, but the idea would be the same – Harry and Draco are
notice that he had Oliver’s. After dinner ended, Harry couldn’t take it anymore. While all the students were trying to exit the hall, Harry made his way to the astronomy tower. If there was any place to meet Draco, it would be their spot.
“You don’t need to console me Harry. It’s fine. I get it.” Harry noticed Oliver’s tone change. It sounded like Oliver was done with the conversation. The conversation left Harry with an unsettled feeling.
“Draco was…nice actually. He listened to me and tried to give me some advice, I think. I feel…terrible about what I did. All those things I said. I’m so embarrassed.” Harry looked down at his shoes. He could feel the tears coming but insisted on pushing them down.
Oliver moved in and kiss Harry. This kiss was different from the one inside. This one wasn’t sweet, it wasn’t due to a mistletoe – this one was purposeful. Harry felt this kiss with every fiber of his being.
Harry didn’t know if it was because he was now on his second class of whisky or because there was something about talking with Charlie that made Harry feel calm, but he decided to just come out and say it. Aloud. For the first time.
Harry liked Draco more and more each day. Now that the truth was out there Draco was noticeably happier. He knew he had Harry and that gave him a sense of confidence. So long as they could live in their astronomy tower bubble…they’d be fine.
But as he walked into the kitchen, he found Draco sitting at the table nursing a cup of tea in his hands – looking just as rough as Harry felt.
Harry approached the table and sat down with a modest ‘hello’. Astoria gave him a weak smile but didn’t say anything and he felt Draco’s hand touch his back. That was calming.
Draco finished putting on his boots and stepped outside. He looked around at the fields. His fields. And quickly set to work. Behind the cottage was a small barn where he kept most of his supplies and he started in that direction. Today’s objective was to cut the grass in that god-forsaken north eastern side that just wouldn’t stop growing. As much as it bothered him, it was also quite easily his favorite place on his land. It sat right on the water and he could take several breaks while cutting the grass to go and swim.
“Ah, I see. And I trust everything went well?” At that moment a rather sleepy looking Draco came into view. He was wearing what Harry could only consider to be his version of ‘lounge wear’ – a loose fitting t-shirt and dark bottoms. Harry had a sudden surge to reach out and see what material they were but fought against it.
Harry didn’t know how to take the conversation or how it ended. Did this mean she listened to him? Was she
Things from that point on moved rather quickly. Two days after their discussion, Charlie decided to further their physical relationship. He told Harry (repeatedly) that he would only do as much as he was comfortable with and would go as slow or as fast as he wanted.
Two weeks of this and Draco was growing exhausted. So, when a majority of the eighth years decided to journey to Hogsmeade this Saturday, he took this as a quick opportunity to pass and have the day to himself. He would have his Saturday morning routine with no interruptions. He would get to wander around the eighth-year dorms as he pleased and spend a day in silence.
“Well, I always said – a seeker is nothing without a good keeper behind him.” As soon as James made the comment Sirius let out a laugh he had been holding in for far too long. Harry shot him a death glare before his father commented “What? What did I say…?”
Draco couldn’t actually believe what he was hearing. Harry Potter had been (what sounded like) the only person looking for him. He was…worried about him?
“I know we’ve never really talked about me and my ‘coming out’ and I also know you’ve been too polite to ask, but…but I want to tell you. Now.” Harry just continued to nod. If Draco wanted to talk, then Harry would listen.
“Right. Sorry.” Harry cleared his throat before continuing. “I told Charlie. He told me that I could be experimenting, but then we kept talking. I told him about a lot of…things I guess. Feelings I had been having. Feelings I’ve had…before.” Harry looked down at his lap again. Draco felt they might be getting somewhere and decided to stay quiet.
Harry shook his head and re-focused on the conversation, “Sorry about that, got distracted.” Harry smiled at the three at the table, “What was the question?”
“Harry, I know you said you’re rather impulsive, but…I don’t think you’re really seeing this from an outside perspective. Look at us.” Draco motioned between the two of them and noticed how Harry gave a confused look. “We are who we are. We have a terrible history between us. We fought on two different sides of the war and honestly, people kind of hate me.”
He opened the box and found a small, white card. It looked kind of like the ones he collected as a kid that he would find in the boxes of chocolate frogs, except this one didn’t have as many colors or embellishments on it. It had the face of a man who was moving and information below that read:
“Let me go get Teddy…” Draco walked out the room and Harry couldn’t help but watch as he did. Even if they were lounge pants, they definitely weren’t baggy by any means. His mind fluttered to his thoughts from this morning before pushing them back down.
Harry kept thinking back to the all of the terrible things Draco had done over the years. But the more he thought about it, the more he was able to see that those terrible things had stopped around fourth year. And this year…this wasn’t the same Draco.
Beyond just the tournament, the year was difficult for other reasons as well. As the year wore on, thoughts began to develop inside of Draco, and he began to have dreams late at night in the Slytherin dormitory. These dreams started innocent enough – a distorted face approaching him and smiling. The next night maybe the face would begin a conversation. The next night perhaps some…flirting.
“Harry…it’s okay…” Draco really didn’t know what to say but felt he should say at least that much. He didn’t want Harry to feel bad about what happened.
“You haven’t asked a question Potter.” Draco was now sounding too cocky, but Harry could still see that there was worry behind the mask.
He quickly realized this was the first time he had fully said it aloud and was beginning to feel a little queasy. Both of his parents just stared at him before his mother jumped up and gave him a huge hug. She began to squeeze him tight and tell him, “I’m so proud of you! My beautiful boy!” Harry soon realized she was crying.
Draco stopped himself. “You really have to interact with people more…” Draco cursed to himself under his breath before moving towards the kitchen. He hoped Harry was a hard sleeper because he had no intention of keeping himself quiet in his own house.
Harry backed away to a comfortable distance and looked at Draco. Draco took this moment to look Harry over, noticing the dark circles around his eyes and the stubble that had gathered around his face. Harry looked handsome (as he always did), but exhausted.
Later that night, Harry and Teddy sat down to have their usual dinner. Harry asked Teddy about his sleepover and was told in detail about every single thing the two boys had done. They played with Scorpius' toy potions set, his toy quidditch set, and apparently his pet pygmy puff. Harry laughed at the thought of Draco Malfoy’s son owning a pygmy puff… Even more so when he was told by Teddy that the pygmy puff’s name was Hubert…
“Yeah…well…that may be true, but we aren’t…together or anything.” Harry felt the need to defend this to Draco. Draco seemed to perk up at the comment before Harry continued. “What about you? Making plans for the big day?” Harry watched as Draco’s face fell again.
So, that was that. Harry was…oddly sad about the conversation. Not sad because he wanted to be with Ginny, he honestly thought this was the best idea. But sad at the loss of normalcy he had experienced with Ginny. Even though he was glad that she too did not think re-establishing their relationship was a good idea, he couldn’t help but feel empty about the situation. At least back when he was with Ginny, he could look forward to something and someone. It made times in the forest more manageable, but even he had to be honest with himself, he wasn’t really thinking about Ginny. He was thinking about the idea of Ginny. The idea of having someone who you loved and who loved you back – like he watched Hermione and Ron develop. But this conversation with Ginny was right – Harry didn’t really ever love her like he was supposed to.
He also knew this year was different. Oliver was by definition, perfect. He liked Harry. Harry liked him. And he was
“Listen to me.” Draco stopped and looked at Harry which proved to be a mistake because the man took it as an invitation to continue talking. “We-as you may or actually probably don’t know, the Ministry has been hunting down any remaining death eaters for the past two years. At this point, they’ve all been either incarcerated or…well, killed.” Draco winced at this thought but composed himself.
It was exactly one month after the war. Draco Malfoy was on trial for his involvement with the death eaters during the war and he was fully prepared to accept his fate. He was in a terrible place mentally, and he secretly hoped for the Dementors Kiss – rather than just a life-long stay in Azkaban.
The day was winding down and night was quickly approaching. For a moment he wondered why Harry would choose to come now, but that thought soon fled when the man approached him.
Harry didn’t know what time it was when he finally drifted off, but he must have because there is now light streaming into his bedroom and an all-too-quiet house.
“Wait, Harry, no you don’t have to go.” But Harry had already walked out towards the door and disapparated back to the Burrow.
Charlie smirked and continued to look directly at Harry – who had now decided to look anywhere BUT Charlie. Before answering, Charlie poured another drink for Harry then settled the bottle back on the table.
be sorry she didn’t come back? She tried to offer you up to Voldemort like a piece of centaur meat.”
But word traveled fast. Harry Potter was now The-Boy-Who-Lived. Word of his name began to travel through Wizarding communities around the world. As his fame spread, Lily and James decided to shield their son from it as much as possible. They wanted their son to grow up with a normal childhood (or as normal as he could). The family was together, and everyone was safe; that’s all they cared about.
He took a meeting with Kingsley the Friday before he was scheduled to meet Draco in Diagon. The meeting was extremely hopeful. Kingsley was delighted that Harry
them to be together’ and while that last one wasn’t a far stretch, Harry couldn’t help but be annoyed. Regardless of the details of the rumor, it was clear to everyone…Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were over.
“Surprisingly, I think I’ll manage. Besides, from what I heard, Weasley men are severely lacking in a department in which we Malfoys seem to excel.”
to tell his parents about Draco. Draco made him so happy and he loved him. He wanted to share that with his parents, and he knew if he did then they would be able to talk him out of all these terrible thoughts he was having about Draco’s lack of communication. But he also knew how his father felt about the Malfoys…
There it was. Harry knew this was a possibility but had stupidly allowed himself to get his hopes up.
George was, surprisingly, the most upset with Harry. He didn’t care that Harry was gay and he really didn’t care that he had had a relationship with Charlie. George knew Charlie was gay as he and Charlie had become close over the past year and was old enough to remember the ‘incident’ in the living room, but outing him in front of everyone and going into detail about their time together was “too much Harry”.
Draco hadn’t heard Harry coming up the stairs and spun around, “Please Potter, you think I would live in a tower…? I’m a Malfoy – we have standards.” Harry looked around confused. “I partake in
Draco felt defeated. This isn’t the way he wanted this conversation to go. He just wanted Harry to be
The day after the alcove, Harry returned for meals. The Great Hall went silent as he entered but didn’t stand long – people got over it rather quickly.
“I was going to tell you when we got back to Hogwarts, but my father started marriage discussions in August before we came back. By then…it was too late. I felt it was best if we just…ended things. Part of me thought about telling you. That’s why I waited for you that day after Quidditch practice, but when I saw how hurt you were…I just couldn’t add to that. I knew it was best for you if we just dropped it. Let you move on…and you did.”
These thoughts weighed heavy on his mind and they drove him to stay clear for Harry for the weeks leading up to the winter break.
“Raise a glass to the sexiest man in the world!” The rest of the table paused for a second, then raised their glass and cheered. There were various whistles and hollers aimed at Charlie, who blushed and smiled politely. The table got quiet when they realized Harry was still standing and was intending on continuing.
“Oh. Um, right. Well…I’m sorry too. You know, for…pushing you, physically…and telling you to ‘fuck off’.” Draco watched as Harry smirked and returned the look.
“Harry…he wants you to get him out of prison. And if you don’t, then…I don’t know what, but something is going to happen.”
When the two finished, Harry moved Draco down to the ground with him and laid them both down – flat on their backs.
Leona continued, “You see, we were on your side during the war, so we were quite surprised when Stori said she wanted to marry a Malfoy. But they seemed happy and in love, so we allowed it. Then there was the divorce, her leaving, Draco gaining custody and he showed us he truly is a remarkable father. We support him, fully. But a young man such as himself can not do this job alone. But don’t you worry Mr. Potter, I’ve made sure Scorpius knows all about you and what you did for our kind!” Harry gave a nervous smile while continuing to look around for Draco.
promised to give me. And that was taken from me!” Astoria’s voice grew and she quickly looked around before lowering it again. “But now…I have that. And I intend to give it to my son as well.”
Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts brought even more excitement. At their opening feast, Headmaster Dumbledore announced that Hogwarts would play host to that year’s TriWizard Tournament. This was an event Harry wasn’t too familiar with but was excited that new students would be entering the school. They were told that, as hosts, they would house students from both Beauxbaton’s Academy of Magic in France and the Durmstrang Institute of Magical Learning in the north.
“Oh, alright.” Both men moved to exit the bed, Harry found his clothes and started dressing. Draco found his lounge clothes and pulled them on. Harry didn’t stop himself this time and reached out to feel them. Satin. Of course.
“Scorpius…for you to be Teddy’s brother, Harry and I would have to be…well, married.” Thankfully Draco took over.
Draco ate his dinner that night, alone. He sat at the very end of the table and made a conscious effort to not look at anyone or anywhere – just down at his plate. But as hard as he tried, his eyes still managed to find Potter. Staring at Potter had become a hobby over the past 7 years, he wasn’t sure who he thought he was kidding thinking it would stop now.
“No, my memory hasn’t been wiped or anything. You seemed to have found me, miraculously. Even though, I am a bit tickled that it took you so long. What is it that you want, Potter?”
It’s been five years and he and Harry live together at Grimmauld Place. They moved his mother in a year ago when her health started to fall again on the pretense that they needed extra help with the kids.
Harry stood up with Draco and was immediately pulled into a hug. Harry was overwhelmed and confused.
But that doesn’t explain the small smile that crept upon his face when after a week of thinking he heard
For a while, Harry couldn’t hear much of anything over the loud blasts from the spells hitting and shattering walls. But eventually, Harry could make out a tone in Blaise’s voice. Blaise was pissed.
“Oh…I- I just assumed. Sorry…” Harry kept his eyes on the ground and let his voice get quiet. “I’m a little relieved. I’m surrounded by couples all the time… and now that Ginny and I are…it’ll be nice to have someone else who’s single.”
Harry stayed with the boys the next day while Draco went to have his meeting. As much as Harry hated the last time he saw Astoria, he didn’t like the idea of Draco going alone this time – but knew it was for the best. They knew each other…well actually. He might be able to talk to her and reason with her about the whole thing.
Draco stood and hesitantly opened the door. It definitely wasn’t his father. Instead, it was Harry Potter. A rather flushed and breathless Harry Potter, but a Harry Potter, nonetheless.
“Yes. But…” Harry paused, “I just thought he would be different. Or rather I hoped. I mean, I wasn’t happy with Ginny and he knew that. And I’m sitting there
Just to be sure – he made sure to stay away from Potter in the second term of fifth year. He would still harass Granger and Weasley, but he needed to keep his distance from Potter.
“Merlin no! I told her we could still parent him together! I told her we could work it out!” Draco was becoming flustered.
Harry tried to enjoy his time at home, but a large part of him missed Draco. He had to keep reminding himself that it wasn’t a long time to go without someone…especially someone you just started dating. It had only been two months and Harry felt like a lovesick fool.
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione boarded the train they started to search for a place to sit. When they neared the end, they opened a carriage only to be met face-to-face with a rather obscene image of Ginny and Dean.
“Oh, um thank you very much Mrs. Weasley, but I really shouldn’t impose.” Draco’s mother had always taught him to politely refuse an invite on the first request.
“At the risk of taking this too fast, you should probably go back to your room. This is a lot for one night.” Harry seemed saddened but understood.
“We heard you’ve been being a little shit around the house” his godfather Sirius spat out as soon as he sat down. “We know you’re going to tell us eventually…so go ahead, out with it”.
The man stared back at him. “Oh, um, sorry…am I bothering you?” Harry moved his eyes down before quickly bringing them back up to meet Draco’s eyes.
“Oh! So you heard, did you? Tell me Potter – what did you hear, huh?” Harry didn’t know how to respond. Luckily, he didn’t have to – Draco wasn’t finished.
“Yeah – but, it’s just Teddy and me. Like I said.” Harry didn’t know why he was rambling and repeating himself.
Starting at a very young age, Ron Weasley was his best friend. The Weasleys became a second family to Harry. He loved it the Burrow. It was a stark contrast to his life in Godric’s Hollow because the Burrow was always filled with people. The Weasley’s had seven children, so their home was always loud and exciting. Being an only child, Harry loved the idea of having brothers and sisters (but secretly also loved the idea of having his parents all to himself).
Draco was beautiful as usual. He wore all black, as he typically does, and his pale skin contrasted it perfectly. The two sat across from one another and Astoria was smiling…
By the time Christmas Day came around, Harry was down-right nervous. He’d been around Oliver loads of times by now, but there something
“They’re custody papers…she’s really going to try and take him Harry…” Harry moved to speak but felt Draco collapse in his arms and thought it best to stay quiet.
Harry tensed and shrugged Draco off. “Yeah, Charlie, we can talk.” Harry shot back a look to Draco which Draco shirked off and went to get another drink.
the idea of Harry on the house team as a first year. He would constantly find the boy staring at him with a scowl on his face.
Harry was confused. “Why? Dean’s straight…and so obviously not interested in me. What’s so hard to believe?”
Harry immediately turned angry. “He’s not Ron! I know we’ve had issues in the past, but he seems different now!”
Harry didn’t want to hurt him, but instead felt a strong urge to sit down in front of the broken man, so he did. “I’m not here for any of that Draco. Like I said, I’m here to talk. Did you and Blaise…break up?”
An hour later, Harry found himself back in Draco’s arms – his “spot”. Harry had so much he wanted to say but decided on the one thing he
The lack of communication from Draco was starting to take a toll on Harry’s ability to act normal around his parents. After the letter from his birthday, Harry became insufferable. He knew he was being rude to his parents and he knew they only wanted to talk to him, make him feel better – but he couldn’t bring himself out of it. He had a bad feeling in his stomach.
The meal dragged on, Draco eating more than he had in two years. Night fell on the cottage and as he was about to get up to light candles, he watched Harry look up. And just like that, the lights in the cottage were on.
“Luxley, we would like to have roast beef and roasted potatoes for dinner. Bring up some of mother’s wine from the cellar, something from the twelfth century. And…treacle tart for dessert.” Luxley nodded her head and disappeared.
“I love flying. Doesn’t it feel so good to just…let go?” Harry turned to look at Draco, but Draco made a failed attempt to look away quickly before Harry noticed he had been staring.
“Please. A lad like you? You’ll have plenty of options when you get out of here. Your future is too bright for you to be terrified.” Oliver spoke to Harry like they’d been friends for years. Harry thought talking to Oliver again after all this time would be strange, but they seemed to settle back into their natural rhythm.
“Draco, you don’t have to be in here. You’re my fake boyfriend – you don’t owe me anything. You should just go.”
“Fine. But all I have is the couch.” He pointed towards the ratty old sofa that had been left behind by the previous owner. “It’s not comfortable.”
During a rather intense game of seekers, Harry and Draco spotted the snitch at the same time and dove for it. As the ground became closer and closer, it felt like old times – neither pulling up, neither giving in, and both going head-first into the ground. Finally, Harry reached out a hand to grab the snitch – with Draco right on his tail. As Harry grasped the snitch, he took a fall and dragged Draco down with him, both hitting the ground hard and rolling.
Harry was frustrated because he came over here with a job to do, “I will. I just need to do this first, please.” Hermione nodded and got him fixed up with the supplies he needed.
“Oh, no, I’m not going. What did you have in mind?” Harry gave a grin and before he knew it, Draco was abandoning his routine yet again for Potter. He quickly dressed and made his way out of the dormitory to meet Harry at the Quidditch pitch.
He already decided he wouldn’t be returning to the Manor. The summer was bad enough and he knew his mother would understand. He was looking forward to spending the holiday alone.
Draco seemed lost. “I – I don’t know. I should probably have an actual conversation with her…one in which I don’t slam the door in her face…” Harry and Draco looked at each other and smirked, “I just… don’t want to get Scorpius’ hopes up. And I don’t want her around my son if she doesn’t approve of…us.”
“I see…Well, here I am. You’ve checked.” Draco hadn’t seen this man in years and yet they fell right back into their natural rhythm. It was fascinating really how much some things don’t change. Even when others definitely do.
It was exactly like one would expect Draco Malfoy’s bedroom to look. All of the furniture looked more expensive than anything Harry had ever purchased himself. The walls were a dark green and the furniture was a deep black that starkly contrasted the white floors and bed linens. Was it some sort of rule in Slytherin house that everything a Slytherin owns has to be green and black for the rest of their lives…?
“Right, well, better get on with it then.” Harry made his way towards the door of the Burrow. As he was about to enter, he heard Draco say “Oh, and Potter, if it’s anything to you, I would really rather you NOT continue on your outing spree tonight. I have a reputation to protect.” Harry rolled his eyes as Draco pretended to slick back his hair, then disapparate.
“He said he wasn’t interested. Same thing.” Draco looked around the room wide-eyed and with a look of bewilderment. “I can’t believe it…”
It had been six months since Astoria’s letter. They had agreed for Scorpius to go to Scotland one weekend every other month and that for the first one, Draco would accompany him. Draco insisted on meeting her husband and seeing where they lived. “My son will
Barely a week into break and Harry received his first letter from Draco – as promised. The letter was long and in Draco’s beautiful handwriting. The contents of the letter were a mixture of poetry and filth. Harry loved the way Draco could be so sweet and tender but turn heated real fast. Harry tried to respond with the same length and heat but had to rush the ending when he heard his father coming up the steps to his room.
“It is what it is, Harry. But what I’m saying is, I understand Ron’s hesitation. This…” He motioned between the two of them again, “won’t be easy.” Draco knew that was an understatement.
It's been a while since I updated and this one is short...sorry! This story WILL continue - I'm just also working on other stories at the same time.
“What Charlie? All too much for you? Feeling scared, embarrassed, vulnerable? Hmm I imagine that’s what Harry was feeling all those months he was with you.” And on that note, Draco decided he would go and find Harry.
real.” Harry’s heart dropped as he spoke the last words. Part of him had begun to doubt if they were ever…real.
Harry stood in disbelief. “So, then what about Charlie? He said you kept pushing him to find a wife.”
“Nothing. Just happy is all. We’re about to graduate. I’m going to go on to play professional Quidditch, Ron is going to be an ass-kicking auror and Hermione is off to do her favorite thing in the world – continue school.” Hermione and Ron weren’t convinced but chose to drop it anyway.
“Ah – yes, of course. How could I forget about the hot fudge?” The wizard waved his wand and began on the boys’ ice creams.
Harry felt foolish. Dean was a boy he had known for four years by this point. He shared a dormitory with him! This was his friend! But for some reason, he couldn’t help but notice his sudden attraction.
Harry felt a rush of relief wash over him. Deep down, he knew Hermione wouldn’t care. But part of him just really wasn’t ready to face it all yet.
“I did…I wrote to Astoria. I called her to a meeting- just the two of us…” Harry looked straight at his friends. He knew this what he needed to do. He was sure of it.
Teddy did not respond right away. This was an important decision and one he did not make lightly. He stood and took in all of the colors and smells…
Harry found himself walking towards the Quidditch pitch Friday evening after a very long week of classes and crying. Once again lost in thought, Harry flinched as he felt a familiar set of hands on his shoulders. When he turned to look, Oliver Wood was making his way around Harry.
Draco finally broke the silence, “Well…what do you want to do? Knowing our children, the minute Scorpius sees Teddy he’s going to say he saw you here.”
liked this Draco. He also began to realize that this was a very different feeling than what he had with Charlie. He and Charlie were, for lack of a better word, physical. They had begun physical and remained physical. Harry’s feeling towards the man evolved because of their closeness and the intimacy they shared. Draco, on the other hand, hadn’t even tried to kiss Harry. And yet, Harry could feel himself falling.
“Well, Hermione, yes, I’m gay. Very very very gay. And I slept with Charlie and I fell in love with Charlie and I outed Charlie and myself. So, we are all caught up – can I go to bed now?”
But Harry didn’t watch any of it. He was still looking at Draco who seemed to turn the tables back on Harry and make him wait this time.
“Harry…that’s not what I meant. I mean, yes, we do need to have a discussion. But I certainly don’t pity you! I just worry. I’ve spent the past week thinking about this a lot and part of me doesn’t think you’re ready for this…whatever it might be.”
“Merlin Potter – what woman wants to be with a gay bloke? Huh? And like I said…it’s complicated.” Draco’s voice was tense.
All clothes eventually found their way to the floor and positions changed to where Draco was laying on his back in his bed. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry and the two continued before Harry pulled back, not enough to break out of Draco’s embrace, but enough to look at Draco’s face completely.
“Hi Scorpius, I’m Harry and this is my godson Teddy.” Harry watched as the boy looked at him with scared eyes that widened as he looked at Harry’s forehead where his scar lay.
“If it’s not too much, I mean, we haven’t really talk talked in a while, but…why did you guys break up?”
But amidst all of this, Harry kept thinking how different this would be if Draco were here. Like he was supposed to be…
He’s wiping the sweat from his forehead with his spare towel he always brings when he hears it again. Another
Leona picked up Scorpius a couple of hours later and Ron and Hermione agreed rather quickly to keep Teddy for the night. Once the kids were taken care of, Draco and Harry decided to make the day and night about them. They would block out the world, pretend it didn’t exist for a bit, before eventually having to face it later.
“Harry, I’ll always love her. She’s the mother of my son, but I don’t love her in the way you’re asking. I never loved her like that…” Draco trailed off and for a split-second Harry thought Draco might continue. He hoped he’d continue…
Draco watched Harry closely during the trial. The boy…now man, had changed. He looked refreshed, but haunted. He wore a hardened expression that Draco recognized because it was one, he too wore – an expression of pain stuffed behind a mask of confidence.
Two weeks into the new term and Draco found himself in a now all too familiar location; studying at a table in the library with Hermione Granger. Draco was always fascinated by how often this tended to happen, with Harry usually slacking off on his studies and Ron following suit. But today their absence was welcome as he had something he needed to discuss with the witch.
Draco hasn't seen Harry since the kiss and has spent the remainder of his holiday wallowing in self-pity.
knew. Everyone knew…After you and I started hanging out, I kept pushing myself to not think about you or think it could be anything more. I went back to Blaise because I knew he was available. He let me because he wanted more from me.  It was fine until last night…” Draco got quiet. Harry immediately thought back to Blaise saying, “say his name yesterday while we were…” Harry’s face flushed.
Harry sat on the bed in shock. Yes, of course he knew this day would come. Yes, he knew he shouldn’t feel tears starting to swell in his eyes. And yes, he knew that tightness in his chest was about to burst. But he calmly looked at Charlie and said, “Okay. Two weeks, wow, that’s….soon, but yeah okay. Thanks…I guess…for, everything.”
what happened – in your own words.” James Potter was very serious with his son. He didn’t love getting a letter from the school, but this was honestly out of character for his son and he needed to know
or anything. So, I don’t really have much to talk about.” Harry really didn’t understand why Draco wanted to talk to him about this.
“No, um…it’s fine. I just…knew? I don’t know. I started having thoughts and dreams…” Watch it Draco….
Draco stayed silent, truly unsure of what he could possibly say at this point. Harry looked back at him and continued. “After everything kind of settled…you re-entered my thoughts. Or, well, continued to be in my thoughts? I don’t know…it’s weird to think that, but I know it’s true.”
“Draco Malfoy uses a reusable, muggle shopping bag?!” Harry’s voice was far too loud and was bound to catch attention.
“Oh… I, I see. Well, that makes sense, we’ve been hanging out a lot. He’s probably just jealous.” Harry attempted a laugh. “There’s nothing for him to worry about, right?”
“It’s fine Hermione.” She had found him in his room and had pretended that she didn’t hear him say “go away”.
The next day Harry found himself 20 minutes early for his meet-up with Draco. He decided to wander about Broomstix for a while and found himself soon caught up with the new broomstick on display. After a while in the shop, Harry glanced out the window and noticed a glimpse of striking blonde hair. A flutter went through Harry’s stomach. Draco was here.
While lost in his own thoughts, he caught a glimpse of blonde. His eyes fell on Draco Malfoy instantly. He told himself it was because he had trained himself over the years to find the man – and avoid him at all costs. But the more he looked, the more he noticed. Draco had changed over the summer. He no longer looked like the skinny, arrogant, git Harry had come to know. This Draco looked…
He made his way inside the home and was met with the boy’s father, James. A powerful stunning spell landed the wizard on his back and rendered him immobile and unable to protect his family. Voldemort found his way to a room with a glowing light. Inside was the boy’s mother, Lily. She was terrified but stood firm in front of her son’s crib. Voldemort raised his wand and stunned the woman who let out a blood-curling scream. Voldemort decided to not kill the woman but instead, give her a fate worse than death – watching her only son die.
“Will you…will you stay tonight?” Harry was confused by the question. Of course he’d stay. They always stayed over at each other’s houses with the kids – but they never asked quite this…way.
“You know there are better ways to do that right? Like, they make machines that will actually cut your grass for you? Non-magic machines.” Draco looked over and noticed the man wasn’t dressed in his auror uniform from yesterday and was instead in muggle jeans, a form fitting dark red t-shirt, and what looked to be shoes that were at least five years old or older.
“You’re getting fucking married?!” Harry looked directly into Draco’s eyes while he had his arm against his throat. He could feel his magic coursing through his entire body.
Harry reached out his hand to take the ice cream as he followed the younger boys to a table outside the shop and sat. He took his first lick and was once again in shock. It tasted like…treacle tart.
When they finished, they agreed to go out for a fly. They grabbed brooms and went out – flying and playing like they had done before.
Once Harry left, Charlie let out an exhale and ran his fingers through his hair. As soon as Harry was upstairs, Draco entered the living room.
Harry knew this was true. The two boys had grown very close and the fact that Harry was here without Teddy would be odd to Scorpius. “Should we…tell them?”
Draco took a breath and continued, “I was having a hard time accepting who I was, and I wasn’t ready to be ‘out’, but by fifth year I was annoyed by having to pretend and decided to pretty much just own it. Most of Slytherin house knew by then, but you know us, we keep our business to ourselves. Well, mostly…” Harry and Draco both thought to the incident from this morning. “But, that’s how I ended up with Blaise. I liked him because he was attractive, available, and discreet. I loved feeling confident about it for myself and I didn’t mind my house knowing, but I wasn’t interested in hearing
They found themselves in a hallway, Draco up against a wall, and the two making-out and groping at each other before a voice caught their attention, “Draco.”
Without the ability to focus on schoolwork, friends, and insulting first years and muggle-borns, when he returned home after that year – the dreams increased. They not only increased in frequency but also in…
of things but look at them and…think about them. It really did start small. A quick glance as he noticed a certain someone walking out of the shower, soaking wet and wearing nothing but his towel. A little-too-long stare while playing a game of pick-up Quidditch and focusing on the way that someone’s body moved on a broom. Or, in the case of today, a late-night drinking session.
“Well, you gave me that title – so I guess I don’t really have a say.” Harry couldn’t help the smile that crept upon his face.
Forgetting she was there, Narcissa Malfoy stepped from behind her husband. “Draco…Draco honey…you need to think about this. Carefully. This is your future at stake…”
“Fuck off Potter and leave me the fuck alone!” Draco turned towards his barn and stomped off. He didn’t hear steps behind him and when he looked back, Potter was gone.
“Yeah – I just wanted to discuss….us.” Harry stated awkwardly as he tried to hold eye contact with the youngest Weasley.
Harry had always loved quidditch and after seeing the World Cup, he had wanted to go to more and more professional games. So, as soon as he was able to, he purchased himself a private box. The box was large enough to hold 10 people comfortably and offered a house elf that would help prepare you and your guests food and drinks while you enjoyed the game (for this reason, Hermione chose not to accompany him much).
After a solid month of planning, Harry and Draco figured out a plan. After graduation, Draco would return home and pack his bags. He’d leave a letter for his father explaining everything and would leave Malfoy Manor in the middle of the night. He would apparate to Harry’s parent’s house, then the two would leave for Scotland the next morning.
Draco quickly looked at his father. He needed his father to stop this. He couldn’t do this. Bring Death Eaters into Hogwarts? How?!
Draco never understood this. If his father wished for him to be strong and ‘carry on the family name with honor’, then why not let him partake in these meetings? Why not let him become a Death Eater?
They knew this plan was cowardly, but no matter how they tried to work it out, they just couldn’t figure out a plan in which they could convince Lucius to cancel the wedding. So, they’d flee.
The dark hair moved and eventually Draco was able to see a face. A face with green eyes that looked swollen and red. But still…beautiful. Draco stopped himself immediately. No, Harry Potter’s eyes were NOT beautiful. And why did he call him Harry again…?
you’ll find someone new later…and maybe he’ll be blonde.” Harry caught the last thought and let out an audible groan then turned to shut his curtains and fall asleep.
Harry wanted to speak but found he had no words, so he stayed behind Draco in the doorway. “Astoria. I already told you, he isn’t here. And even if he was, I wouldn’t give him over to you. We haven’t seen you in four years.”
“Okay…so you think you’re bisexual? Potter, one kiss doesn’t make you bisexual. Kissing another guy doesn’t make you bisexual. It’s about how you
“Teddy, we saw him two hours ago…” Teddy looked saddened by the response and went back to his plate.
Harry felt himself blush and a smile move up on his face, “I assure you – I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Later in the morning, he set out to work in the field. He was annoyed that he still had to go out and cut the grass but trudged his way out that way anyway. It wasn’t long before he heard the
He didn’t appreciate the tone in Harry’s voice, “Yes? Sorry if it isn’t up to your standards Potter. But as I said before, you can be going.” Draco made his way inside and slammed the door before Harry could get in. He heard the man curse under his breath, then heard the familiar
It was funny how much he already knew about this man. He knew Draco Malfoy wasn’t a morning person, nor was he a night owl. He had to go to bed right at 9pm and would wake up at 6am always upset about it. But anytime Harry said, ‘it’s fine, go back to sleep’, he would
“Potter. The people in town don’t know who I am. To them, I’m Drake the farmer down the road. That’s it.”
Draco looked up as if he hadn’t heard Harry come down and let out a quick, “I want to take you on a date.”
“Ah – yes. Well, like I said, I would take care of things. I imagined that the Savior and a Death Eater going out on a date in Diagon Alley would cause a bit of an uproar, so I felt it best to pull some strings and here we are.” Draco looked proud of himself.
“I want to date you. Publicly. I just…I need to talk to Ron and Hermione first. Tell them properly. Then we can be out.” Harry’s eyes went wide. “Unless of course that’s not what you want! Then we don’t have to! This is probably too fast and everything.” Draco couldn’t help another smile from creeping on his face.
“Well, his father and I were classmates at school together.” Harry hoped this would appease his godson and that the other boy wouldn’t give him away.
But that’s the thing, Harry did know Draco. Maybe he didn’t know all of Draco, but he had known him for years. Granted, a majority of that time Draco was acting like a prat, but still.
“Ron, why don’t you go up to the dorm. I’ll be there in a bit. I need to speak with Draco.” Harry watched as Ron left up the staircase.
long time.” Sirius turned to look at Remus, took his hand, and smiled. “But, when this one decided to show his Gryffindor bravery and kiss me that day sixth year in the astronomy tower…well, I couldn’t deny it after that…”. The two men looked at each other for a very long time before finally breaking out of their haze. “Why do you ask Harry?”
Harry told Hermione everything the next day and she encouraged him to talk to Ron. She knew he needed his best friend for this.
When he returned, he wore an indistinguishable look on his face. He held the letter in his hand and stood in the doorway looking at Harry.
The banging continued. Draco rolled his eyes, “Ugh – okay.” Draco got out of bed and Harry followed him.
Back on the train, Draco looked embarrassed. He quickly took his hand back and Harry watched him re-compose himself. He looked around the carriage at the other two faces, “Well, at least we respect our pureblood status. We don’t go around associating ourselves with mudbloods.” He immediately turned and looked at Hermione. Harry was sickened by the word, but it was Ron who stood up. “That’s a bad word Malfoy! It’s cruel! Harry and I aren’t interested in you or your friendship. You can leave!” Harry had never seen Ron so confident – part of Harry’s heart swelled. He stared at Draco and watched as he fixed his expression into a scowl and left their carriage.
“Okay Potter. I don’t want details of your sex life, I’m looking for a reason for the break-up…unless they’re related…?”
Draco Malfoy sat in his cozy (cramped) kitchen, nursing a cup of hot tea, and looking out his window towards the rolling lush green English countryside. The sun had yet to fully rise and the smell of morning was only beginning to creep into his cottage.
Harry pushed himself from behind Oliver and shot back at Draco, “You’re drunk. You’re always drunk. What’s wrong Draco? Troubles with the future
“Oh. Right…So, how are things with you and Blaise?” Harry was uncomfortable and after his own activities last night and needed to talk about anything other than Draco engaging in…activities.
By the end of the conversation, his mother was crying. His father just kept looking back and forth between Draco and Harry.
“Actually…do you think I could stay here tonight? I’m exhausted. I can barely apparate properly on a good day. Apparating now might be a disaster.” Harry looked towards the fireplace, “Unless of course you have a floo…”. Draco gave him a look that screamed ‘you know damn well I don’t have a floo’.
He didn’t think about it when he agreed to the sleepover but now, with nothing else to do or think about, he realizes this is the first night he has ever spent away from Teddy.
Lucius Malfoy would spend the rest of his days in Azkaban Prison and Draco vowed to never visit his father again.
This Christmas would be…different. He had heard Charlie would be coming home as part of his promise to Molly that he would not miss any more major family events. Charlie would be there on the 23
“That’s fine. You don’t have to say anything. Let’s just have our normal day. We can keep taking this slow. Lunch?”
The more Harry spoke, the harder the rain began to fall. Draco quickly finished packing up their items and started towards the barn. All the while, rain began to fall around them.
Harry was the first to speak, “Mr. Malfoy…I love your son. I love him very much.” Draco looked up quickly at Harry before turning his face towards his father.
“Harry, just because you’re now comfortable with your sexuality, doesn’t mean you have to jump at every gay guy you meet mate!” Ron was a little
He entered and immediately realized two things – 1. The inside matched the outside perfectly. It was perfectly decorated to be a mixture of pub and restaurant. An oak bar lined the right side with liquor bottles floating every which way and oaks tables to his left.   2. The place was near empty – with the exception of three guests. One of which was Draco.
As much as he already knew, there was so much left to see. He was loving finding out more and more things about Draco. He liked learning Draco. He liked exploring Draco.
Don’t get him wrong, he was extremely attracted to Draco. He found himself staring at Draco much in the same way he used to stare at Charlie. And that’s how Harry noticed their differences. Charlie was…large. He was a Weasley which meant he was stocky and built. He also tamed dragons which meant there was a fierceness in his eyes at all times and a confidence that would take over when they were together.
“Right! Here! I really hope you like it…” Harry extended the gift out to Draco who took it and carefully unwrapped the paper. Harry would never get used to seeing Draco be so gentle.
“But you are a Malfoy man. A pureblood. You belong to one of the wealthiest and well-respected houses in the pureblood families. Your activities must stop. You are not to act on these…
Draco laughed out loud to himself because of course he did. He had probably liked Harry for way longer than he could care to admit.
“Oh Harry….” Was all Hermione could say. Harry decided to stay there the rest of the day in case Normigeon came back with a response with Astoria.
an infant managed to destroy one of the most powerful dark wizards of all time, but he did. The war had been difficult on everyone and the Potter family was no exception. Upon joining the Order of the Phoenix, the Potters immediately began to help. Voldemort was growing stronger and gaining more and more followers. Wizards and witches were flocking to become Death Eaters, followers of Lord Voldemort, and terrible times laid ahead.
“I guess you got what you wanted Potter.” Draco’s voice cut into Harry immediately. He thought he had seen Draco in the stands earlier, but thought he might be imagining things…
a pureblood. Harry had never really thought about what that would mean for a family such as the Malfoys to have a gay child, especially their only son.
But Harry also understood the importance of the farm to Draco. So, he agreed to long-distance. Harry would come and stay weekends with Draco on the farm, and the work week back at his own house.
Harry could feel tears starting to form in his eyes and decided to see how much Molly really meant what she was saying. “Thank you…then, is it okay if Draco Malfoy comes over for Christmas tomorrow? I got him a present and I’d like him to open it on Christmas Day.”
Harry heard a faint, “Night Harry” before closing the door behind him and letting out a long exhale. He made his way down to his own room and prepared himself for bed. There were so many thoughts swirling in his head,
“…Hermione? What do you know?” Ron gave his girlfriend a look that screamed ‘I know you know, so just tell us’.
Astoria would come back and take Scorpius at any moment. Scorpius began to ask questions about his father’s behavior, but Draco simply told him he was ‘tired’ or ‘working too much’ and his son accepted it.
“Yes? He’s small, practically a baby.” Draco opened the door and Billy came flying in, cowering behind Draco as he did. He did a quick look around and made his way towards the bedroom to lay at the end of Draco’s bed.
Draco decided to sit down at the table directly next to Harry. He looked up and made eye contact with Charlie who gave a hesitant smile. Draco turned his attention to Harry who reached a hand under the table to look for Draco’s and gave it a small squeeze. The two looked at each other and Draco felt his chest tighten.
“Hermione, it’s Skeeter. She’s going to do whatever she wants to whomever she wants. She’s always been obsessed with Harry…it was bound to happen.” Ron placed his hand on Hermione’s back to sooth her before looking back at Harry, “What are you thinking, mate?”
Harry responded to Draco’s letters as soon has got them. He talked about Ginny and Cho (and that led to Cedric – which Draco agreed with). The Cedric conversation led to a conversation about their first same-sex crushes, surprisingly they realized they had the same one…Oliver Wood. Through these letters Harry was able to process all of the things he had been feeling since his realization 6 months ago. Draco was someone who understood. Draco would talk about his own experiences and the difficulties of growing up gay
Draco was sure. He knew how he felt about Harry and he knew better than to allow himself to feel those things if Harry wasn’t ready to return the feelings.
Harry accepted the offer and Kingsley informed him that he would be starting in two weeks (after they filled some of the other positions available in the program).
“Blaise Zabini owns the place. He opened it up about six months ago with the money his mum gave him after her last husband died. I called in a favor.” Draco still looked smug.
He told him about coming out over the summer and about how not many people knew. Harry even told him about Dean…. He wasn’t sure why, but before he knew it – he was spilling everything.
“That doesn’t mean we’re married Scorpius. There are procedures that would have to happen. And one of us would have to ask the other if they even wanted to be married to the other.” Draco was continuing to look only at Scorpius. Teddy had gone quiet and was finishing his ice cream in silence. He had gotten really good at learning when to contribute and when to allow Draco and Scorpius to have their moments.
Harry tried to not think about the new information but kept finding himself thinking about Draco. This explains so much actually. His moods, his absences, and his…flirting the other day.
“Oh, so you think I’m cute… Interesting.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Okay – I think these compliments are getting to your head.”
“Yeah, well…I probably deserved a lot worse. I haven’t exactly been…great to him.” Draco quickly looked down at the ground before finally taking a seat.
“Harry, I’m happy we could talk about this. You don’t ever need to feel like you have to hide something from me, okay? I want to be there for you when you start to have an interest in someone, okay?” Harry nodded.
Harry didn’t know what to say, so he said nothing. Ginny took his silence as agreement and simply turned and walked away as if there wasn’t much left to be said. And Harry guessed there really wasn’t.
He was enjoying this position a little too much when he was all of a sudden no longer in Harry’s lap and was instead being moved in the air. Harry grabbed him around his waist and quickly flipped them, so Harry was on top of him in the bed, Draco on his back.
The Weasleys had strangely took him in as family. It took a while for them to come around, but when they did, Draco quickly realized why Harry loved them so much. Being an only child, Draco had never experienced a family quite like this. There was so much love in that house… even with a person missing.
Just as he started for the door out of the dorm, he felt a hand on his forearm. He spun around and saw an overly excited Harry Potter staring at him.
“Yes, but I don’t mean it like that. I just mean…” Harry exhaled and attempted to gather his thoughts, “I just mean I think my sexuality will be fine with him. But it’s likely going to take him a while to warm to the fact that I want to date…you.” Draco hated how the last sentence made him smile. Harry Potter wants to date him.
Harry continued to look at the man in front of him and listened as he babbled on and on before finally speaking, “Yes.”
“I’m aware, Potter. And if that’s all the advice you have for me, have a great day.” Draco turned back to his grass and continued cutting. He could feel Potter growing agitated next to him but refused to acknowledge it.
Harry quickly arranged a dinner at Hermione and Ron’s for the next night so they could meet Scorpius. Obviously, they knew Draco. But Harry wanted to introduce them to
His routine consisted of waking up, eating breakfast, going to work, coming home, waiting for dinner, then going to bed. He hardly interacted with anyone and when people asked him if he was okay, he would simply say, “Yeah, just tired from work”. This usually shut down conversation, for everyone except Hermione of course. She saw right through Harry.
Ginny gave a drunken, yet very sweet speech about how great of a brother he was and how he was much better than Ron. Ron didn’t even try to argue, he simply piggy-backed off of Ginny’s speech and said “hear, hear!” Hermione’s toast was elegant as always, it probably helped that she hadn’t drank
“I know Hermione, I just…I don’t want to bother him with this. I don’t want him speaking on behalf of my father, not that he honestly would anyway, and I don’t want him trying to go off and fix this problem himself. You know, he does tend to do that…”
“Harry. I’m sorry for leaving you like that yesterday. I should have handled it better…I just wasn’t prepared for that.”
When Harry was 9, he started to develop questions. He decided to go to the smartest person he knew, his mother.
The two laid together in the astronomy tower for hours that night, alternating between kissing and talking. They would face everything later.
Based on the banging on the door, Harry figured the woman was mad about something, but didn’t understand what exactly. She didn’t have her wand out, so she couldn’t have been here to harm them, right?
Harry opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by his own godson. The boys seemed to be much chattier now than earlier. “My mom and dad died during the Battle of Hogwarts. They fought bravely and validantedly.” Teddy remarked as if from memory.
Harry moved to sit down at the table with Draco. “Me? I’m fine! How are you? We explicitly talked about
“I…” Harry started but stopped immediately. Draco waited for him to go on and watched as Harry seemed to grow uncomfortable before taking a deep breath and looking like his confidence was re-sparked. “I’ve thought about ‘Draco Malfoy’ probably every day for as long as I could remember.”
“No, they don’t hate you. They’ve been worried about this. They’re the only ones who knew what I did. They’ll be happy for us. Trust me.” Draco still looked terrified but seemed to relax a bit. He took Harry and gave him another kiss, ignoring the yelling boys behind them.
“Right…sorry.” Harry looked around the room before deciding to take his cue, “It’s getting quite late. I should probably take Teddy home.” Harry moved to exit the kitchen but once again found himself chest-to-chest with the man as they both tried to leave through the doorway together.
looked different. His shaggy hair was cut much cleaner (albeit still a mess), he wore what looked to be auror robes, and Draco couldn’t help but notice he seemed to fill them out rather well.
“Yeah, well, it was really out of convenience. We were both in Slytherin, both pureblood, and both had mounting family pressures during the war. He wasn’t a Death Eater, so he didn’t
help in this case? He had obviously escaped to the English countryside to live on a fucking farm. Why would he have any interest in this case?
over a month ago that you two were together even before that little scene with Blaise. I still don’t think it’s a good idea. You dad won’t be happy about it and if I’m being honest Harry, I don’t know if I trust Draco. He isn’t good enough for you.”
“Okay – write to them and ask if they can keep him for the night. I’ll ask Leona to take Scorpius and we will have a day and night just to ourselves. I want to remind you that this relationship is about us and our children. No one else, you understand me?” Draco was looking right at Harry and all Harry could do is smile and nod.
“Right. Sorry. I’ve just never really talked like this to anyone. Oddly enough, Charlie said the same thing. He said if I couldn’t say the words, then I’m not ready to have the conversation.” Draco nodded and hoped Harry would continue. “I’ve had dreams about guys before. Sex…dreams. Like you said. And…I’ve found guys attractive before…I just didn’t really realize that’s what it was at the time, I guess. But I’ve never wanted to kiss one until…well, until you.”
Harry looked at Charlie’s hand on the glass and noticed the grip Charlie had on the glass. Charlie looked up. The two made eye contact. Harry felt a heat rise up the back of his neck and decided to ask another question to cut the tension.
Things were also continuously getting better with the press. For the most part, the two could be seen out and about without the risk of being mauled by a group of reporters or fans or…not fans. After a rather heated argument with a reporter who thought it would be okay to take a picture of Scorpius and Teddy, reporters especially left them alone now if they were with their children.
Harry knew the level of his voice was too high when a majority of the class, including Draco, turned to look at him. He caught Draco’s eyes and was met with that same stare. Harry hadn’t realized how much he missed that stare until a familiar heat went up his neck.
Before things continued with Draco, Harry knew he needed to talk to Oliver. He found the man sitting outside one Saturday afternoon and decided to approach.
Harry didn’t understand why Draco wasn’t fighting back. Was he really afraid of firing a spell at Blaise and looking bad for it? Anyone would fire back at Blaise. It would be justified – in self defense even!
Draco watched as his father’s face dropped. He must have not been expecting that. If he wasn’t so terrified, he might have rather enjoyed the look of pure shock on his father’s face.
“Mr. Potter! What a coincidence I should run into you today! Do come in!” Harry gave the witch a smile before looking down at Teddy who seemed to be unbothered by the witch.
Harry was heartbroken. He was angry at himself for thinking he and Dean could be something. He was angry at himself for letting himself feel this way for someone…for another boy. Harry knew he shouldn’t care – his godfathers were gay, and he loved them! He knew it was okay…he just wasn’t sure if it was okay for him.
“Oh…right, yeah okay.” Draco stood and began to make Harry a plate. As he placed more and more food on the plate, he noticed Hermione and Ron sharing a look. Before he turned to leave, he thought of one more thing, “Ron, if they have treacle tart – will you grab some and bring it to Harry later?”
“It’s okay. We can do as much or as little as you want.” Draco took Harry in his arms again and held him. He lowered the two of them back onto the bed and the two just laid there for what felt like ages. Eventually, Harry ‘The Voice of Reason’ decided it was probably best if he
How in the hell did you end up in a place like this?!” Before Draco could comment, Harry was back at it. “And what the hell are you wearing?” Harry looked Draco up and down.
Harry was left with a very strange feeling. This wasn’t normal. His parents didn’t act this way to him. These were the parents that didn’t scold him for earning detention and scooped him up in their arms when he came out as gay. Not the ones who…left the room.
Even though Harry’s job was more demanding than he initially anticipated, he loved every minute of it. Draco’s training was starting to pick-up more as well, but somehow, they still managed to meet-up every week. They developed a sort of routine after a while.
Draco decides to stay back during the winter break as a way to find solitude and peace from the other members of his dorm while also processing the letter from his father.
Silence fell between the two before Draco moved to speak, “So…Wood, huh? Can’t say I blame you…he’s quite fit.”
But things took a turn one night in early August. Draco was sitting at the dinner table with his parents and being served their dinner by the house elves. As he sat there, thoughts began to pop into his mind, and he began to feel familiar feelings running throughout his body. He continued to engage in normal, polite conversation with his mother and father – listening as they discussed day-to-day items from the Manor and their estate. But once dinner was over, Draco quickly excused himself from the table and made his way to his bedroom.
“No, I understand all of that. I only recently figured some of this stuff out. I’m probably not ready for anything…serious.” Harry felt confident as he spoke, but that confidence shattered as more words suddenly came out of his mouth. “Unless! Unless you don’t want to do this at all! Which I would COMPLETELY understand. I’m sure it isn’t super exciting to be with a virgin – much less one you’ve known since he was so young and all. I’m just going to go back to my room…”. Harry turned to move towards the door and began to stand. Charlie quickly placed his hand on his forearm and brought him back toward to the bed.
When he was done, Remus reached out a hand and took Harry’s, “I’m so sorry Harry, I’m sorry you had to go through that heartbreak. But I want you to know that not every boy will react that way. It sounds like Dean just didn’t know how to handle that.”
Graduation came too quick for Harry. He thought he would be sad to leave Hogwarts, and on some level, he was, but he was also thrilled for the new chapter of his life. Harry had asked Draco to come to Scotland with him. Draco could continue to study potions at the Scottish Wizarding School for Continuing Education and Harry could play Quidditch.
Harry looked up at Draco and quickly realized he liked this angle. “I know. I want to…I’ve wanted to do this for a while. So, just let me, okay?” That’s apparently all Draco needed to hear.
Hermione fixed her expression into a determined look and responded, “I’m listening.” She closed her textbook as if to show that he had her full attention. “Is it about Harry?”
“Would you…would you want to stay?” Harry looked back from the door to Draco with a wide smile on his face.
The next day was much the same. All of the Weasley children (plus Harry, minus Percy) met outside for their usual pick-up Quidditch game. Harry kept feeling as though someone was watching him, and whenever he would turn to look at Charlie – Charlie would look away. Harry thought this was odd behavior. It had always been the other way around…
This was working until he saw a flash of shimmering light in the hallway on a walk late one evening. He had taken to these walks his first week back as a way to ‘de-stress’ and process his thoughts. But he never saw a shimmer like this…
Harry felt he was a little young to start these conversations, but Hermione insisted and planned on teaching her child the same way – Rose is now three and has already said the word, ‘intersectionality’.
Harry opened his arms and stepped towards Draco. But by this point, Draco was over all of this. He pushed the man back, hard. So hard he fell into the sopping wet ground, but Draco couldn’t be bothered to care.
The game ended with Harry holding the snitch and with Draco and him on the ground - Draco on top of him. It took Draco a moment to understand their position as he raised himself up. He found himself staring down at Harry, his hands straddling the side of the man’s head and their bodies lying flush.
Draco began to push against Harry and move him towards the bed. Harry turned them around and moved towards Draco’s mouth and began to press flush against the man from mouth to legs. He quickly removed Draco’s shirt and began to push Draco onto the bed. Draco allowed his head to fall back and moaned as Harry began at his neck again.
“Well, Mr. Potter. You’ve certainly given me plenty to think about. Tell Draco he will hear from me soon. Good day.” Astoria moved towards the door. She gave Harry one last glance, then left.
“I went to Romania right after graduation because I knew this was not the place for me. I needed to be with people that felt as I do – who looked for adventure and felt that there was a higher purpose to life than some office job at the Ministry. The dragons were an added bonus.” Harry smirked and allowed Charlie to continue.
Harry finally decided to speak, “But…what happened? I thought you said you and Blaise were just friends with benefits. This morning didn’t look like friends with benefits… and if that’s all you were, then why were you crying…?” Draco froze. He knew Harry would come back to that.
