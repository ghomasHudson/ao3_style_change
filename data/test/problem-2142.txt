of their parents… if neither of them had… they might’ve been brothers of a sort if not at least raised as friends if they’d lived in a better world where madmen and their followers didn’t kill and torture people. If they weren't both orphans and their parents were just friends they got to see all the time.
If he hoped because he empathized and it was a reflection of the wish he still held for himself, or because he truly wished his godson happiness, he didn’t know. But he had hoped… that Draco wouldn’t be the cold-hearted bastard his father was, or a pawn to either dark lord or Dumbledore. Draco was a lot of things, but he’d never been cruel… and Severus had known since the boy asked how to brew a pain reducer for his mother who’d come down with the flu at nine years old that he’d never be truly cut out for work in the Dark.
But he had another reason to sit at the Slytherin table now, because he was going to figure this out if it killed him.
Neville didn’t even question it.
He didn't feel all that guilty for giving Ron a mild concussion though, and wondered what that said about him.

“Harry…”
But it was very manageable, and in a couple seconds he’d gathered himself to turn around and find his seat again—a very pale looking Draco not watching the table at all but watching him intently, hands hovering like he wanted to do something despite that being rather useless.
So, with Crabbe and Goyle not bothering to come look for him since their parents had told them not to anymore, he'd been free to pick and choose which room he wanted—there were only five Slytherin boys this year and six bed spaces in the two rooms of three, both rooms having a spot open. Since he was from a newly grey family and Zabini was the most infamously grey family there was, it was an easy choice.

Harry felt a sense of nostalgia slipping into the bench beside Draco and looking at his fellow second years across the table, even though it hadn’t really been that long.

Narcissa took half a step back and smoothed out the front of her robes.
Draco was pleasantly surprised, and Blaise nodded quickly.

sounded way to pleased to say it and Harry forced himself not to turn around, not acknowledge the man, not even react to the intense punishment they’d just been given as he bolted up the entrance hall stairs, forcing Neville along as he gasped sharply in shock at the loss. He knew it was probably rude of him not to acknowledge a professor, but he also knew they’d just lose more points to his unfortunate habit of mouthing off if they stuck around too much longer, and at least now they were out of earshot for if the man decided the slight to his person was worth detracting

The pain had been so unbelievable that he couldn’t lie here and even replicate the feeling in his mind. Not that’d he’d want to, but he couldn’t outright feel fear of something he couldn’t even wrap his mind around or was so vastly, unimaginably tortuous that his mind whited out rather than give him a replay in his mind’s eye.
He didn’t need the help with the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division aspects of any of it, but since his knowledge of things like exponents and square roots amounted to only knowing generally that
Harry was sweating actively as he tip-toed as fast as he could the opposite direction from whatever was happening here, really trying to forget he heard that as their hissing disappeared behind him. Whatever it was about, it sounded serious as hell and also if professors were threatening each other’s lives, then this school was even worse in professionalism than he’d thought it was.
Grim as that extremely nonchalant admission was, Harry did feel slightly less weird about so many apparently willing him things—Axeclaw most certainly hadn’t phrased it like that last year.

It was a win all around and so Harry happily shook off the rest of his nausea on his way down the street and to his first destination.
“I can assure you Mr. Potter will do as he pleases with or without my input, but I can put in a good word.” She admitted wryly. “Thank you for your help, but if you could keep this under wraps for now, it would be appreciated. I think this potential work can be fleshed out more thoroughly for the time being, and perhaps published when he’s a bit older.”

Harry was a tad surprised at the blunt take from the bookworm but was more amused by the pretty colors Draco turned to be talked to like that. He would’ve loved to see what outburst was coming before something about the impending appointment with Gringotts hit home with him.
Another quick nod, and the rest of the walk down to where Hagrid was standing was spent in silence—both boys on his arms now too tense to do more than pretend to be unbothered while Harry dragged them forward.
“Yeah.” He let out a tired breath. He had figured as much.
“Ah… hello.” He greeted in surprise, and she smiled politely.
He just had one thing to write, before it could slip his mind yet again.
What did-” His questions bubbling to the surfaced silenced themselves when the professor shot him a dark look over his shoulder and suddenly a trill of fear jolted something in Harry’s memory. That, and a stab of pain directly to his forehead that seemed to dunk his body into a cold sweat instantly.
There was a graceful arc to the way magic moved through objects he was transfiguring—a sharp incline of power, but then once you pushed it over that tiny invisible edge, you could relax and simply

“DON’T YOU DARE TALK TO MY WIFE THAT WAY, YOU BRAT!” Vernon bellowed, taking a menacing step forward and Harry was suddenly very aware that he was pinned in the corner between the counter and the sink with any means of escape blocked by all three Dursleys. Vernon and Petunia had never actually hit him besides grabbing him to toss him out of their sight here and there, but Dudley sure had and despite him standing there with a gaping look of dumb shock on his face, if Harry tried to bolt past him he’d likely automatically take a swing just on principle.

No, Harry had a whole list of questions. Probably more then just Axeclaw could answer to be fair, but… his eyes dropped back to the two names at the base of the tree, and maybe he was just tired or loopy from the spells but... he couldn’t help himself.
They got to the Great Hall and Hannah lead the charge by plopping down at the Hufflepuff table, and Lu was so into it with Susan he didn't even notice he was sitting at the wrong table as they didn't spare a breath to stop arguing. The Gryffindors were too used to Harry sitting wherever he liked to think too hard on it and just plopped down around them to dig in. Only Neville glanced around a bit nervously before sitting beside Harry quickly, and yes they did get some odd looks, but not nearly as much as there'd once been.
Dell wasn’t a stranger, odd as it sounded given she died centuries before he was born. She was like a big sister, but more somehow since he’d spent over a year reading about her life through her eyes.
He felt the pain in his hand suddenly disappear and blinked his eyes back open to see not only the cut on his hand suddenly gone, but all the blood cleared apart from what had made it into the now-full cup. He had to blink a couple times as he pulled his hand back close to him, rubbing his palm distractedly as the black dots cleared from around the corners of his eyes.

It was not unusual for his godson to visit Severus office, both with questions and simply to talk at times, although on a weekend was a tad out of the normal for sure. Draco was still young, and he’d made new friends
Harry scoffed audibly. “Being a stereotypical bully doesn’t make you strong, or worth noticing, it just makes you predictable. Predictable people are easy.”
“Yeah… so uh, the whole train knew pretty quickly you weren’t there. But then he cooled it so everyone figured you’d managed to get a message to him to explain.”
Said boy flashed a wry smile as he mulled that advice over while Blaise got even more annoyed.

The first person to break the silence though, legitimately startled Harry.
Neville would keep to the lie that Harry had been the one to lose the points. He had no clue if Neville could actually lie or not.
That earned a small smile from her, at least. Severus was the youngest potions master ever and was undoubtedly gifted, but his published works were rough to get through despite them being groundbreaking in the Potions field. Minerva had read the summaries and left the actual reading of those papers to other Potions masters who really wanted to know. As was often the case, being knowledgeable didn't mean you could express it well either in words or writing.
but were mainly after self-preservation and success, not so much because of any belief system they may or may not buy into. Pucey was in the twins’ year level and Higgs was a fifth year so they’d played against them both a lot and confirmed they were the least of their worries—average players and also decent (ish) enough for Slytherins in their opinions. They were about appearances and politics and success, and also apparently had a passion for quidditch while they were at it, but they weren’t exactly death eaters in training.
Draco watched him do that, but just blinked at the motion in confusion, clearly not understanding.
The shed doors had not opened once since Vernon had closed them over a month ago, and Harry felt nothing as he lay down again rather than respond to Draco’s message. The blond knew something was wrong now, because Harry would go days without writing him back. Luckily he hadn’t stopped writing him first, even if most of the time it now sounded like journal entries talking about his day without someone responding to him.
“It’s Monroe actually, Ms. Davis, and the fact you fell for that means I’ve already made more progress with you than with Mr. Nott.” Harry didn’t miss a beat in snipping back, and her face crumpled in annoyance at him, which he returned with a megawatt fake smile of his own.
He turned on his heel and walked the direction Draco had been leading him—Draco himself startled by the sudden 180s that had been happening and quickly following him. He felt the others aside from Ron follow, as well as many eyes on him, but he didn’t look back to meet any of their gazes.
“Of course it is. Sorry for being so nosy, just letting my mouth run over here.” He kicked the ground a bit awkwardly, gripping his hands behind his back in a submissive tone that Neville couldn’t see with his back turned.

he hadn’t thought it through, but he’d panicked okay!? "Still, it’s a rare witch or wizard who leans on transfiguration first, in a battle-like setting, instead of a charm or an offensive spell. In any case… thirty points to Gryffindor, for an excellent show of Transfiguration. Keep at it, Mr. Potter."

The fact he was good enough at arguing his point to know what equation to use and how to break it down in a clearly worded, simple manner only a child would be so good at was impressive enough, but backing himself up with no less than two dozen texts and principles proven to be true meant his argument was all but impenetrable. She would have to run it by Septima to double check the Arithmancy, but from what she knew of the subject is was all spot-on.
“Yes.” He allowed simply, before turning back to his book and honestly that was all Harry needed from him to be on cloud nine.
“Theoretically if his magical core is being taxed it might stunt normal growing so it’s probably just to be sure. Better safe than sorry and nutrient potions only help, even if you’re not deficient. They’re nasty tasting but can only do some good.” He explained automatically and Theo seemed to accept that logic.
“Excited to fly then Harry? We’ve only drilled the rules of the game into you by now but you’ve never actually flown right?”
Harry was fine with consequences, but Draco wasn’t. That meant he needed a way to make sure Harry didn’t feel the consequences of his actions, but literally
“Awake against his will is seems,” Harry smiled in amusement as he placed a hand pointedly over his collar, having tuned out mostly but definitely aware of the soft grumbles beneath his ear about people talking too loudly over his nap. At his touch he felt the snake writhe a bit and poke his head up to see what was happening.
He would sacrifice 75% of the children in this school for the sake of the last 25%, without hesitation. Which, on one hand Minerva kind of hated him for, as he was a professor and supposed to be here to protect
The girls kept talking to themselves and giggling quietly as they watched, which was also weird, but Harry ignored it. This time. Next time they showed up, they were going to play or get lost since the giggling was getting old fast.

population of the upper years who, outside of the snake house, took to blatant whispering and staring when he walked through the Great Hall at meals, in the library, or in the halls even. Luckily his year level seemed familiar enough with him to either keep it to themselves more tactfully, ask him to his face, or simply get over it decently quickly, so his actual classes turned out fine. By Wednesday all second years seemed to be over it and thankfully were more focused on the potions exam Snape had sprung on them for this Friday. Not to mention the new quidditch team line-ups were announced the same day his parseltongue rumor had broke so the two topics of conversation seemed to compete with each other and eventually quidditch won out as the more interesting of the two.
“What’s got you so happy over a timetable?” George leaned over his shoulder to see his schedule, and made a face. “Bwah! I forgot how nice the schedule was for first and second years!”

“Hey!” Harry’s indignant cry was ruined by his laughter too. He really did have a point there, much to Harry’s chagrin.

He was half tempted to ask the snakes for more information, but figured if he didn’t know who they were, the more protected they’d be.

Speak of… he buttoned the new overcoat closed, reached up and pulled the excessively large hood over his face, and willed the material of the sleeves and bottom hem to 'un-smoosh'—material filling back in and covering his hands and feet. He looked back in the mirror and… grinned at the blank, Harry-less mirror looking innocently back at him.
It pulled him forward slightly before suddenly going slack, a grip still around his hand but like the person attached to it had just given out and stopped pulling him—and then it felt too lose. Something wasn’t right.

Not that he didn’t enjoy class clowns, but even if he didn’t have the added motivation of never causing the scene and pissing off the Dursleys, he’d never felt the desire to disrupt class or crack a joke in the middle of a class-like situation.

“A copy of the will is sent to everyone named in it. You also received a copy, but it’s filed in your account until the day you were old enough to ask for it. Technically you would not even be allowed access until you were of age, but by inheriting the Monroe name— who didn’t have any age restrictions given they had no young children when they died out—

“I’ve already done my essay if you’d be interested in talking Transfiguration anyway?” He offered, a bit too delicately to be casual. In an instant Harry realized this was the first time Theo was actually offering to do a deal with him and he almost jumped at the chance simply for the principle of it all—but then he caught sight of Draco’s glare and grimaced.
Said teacup was being drained for the fourth time in one meal, but he really liked jasmine tea and they rarely had it. Most people seemed to like earl grey, the lemmings.
"They lead you to me?" Harry perked up again as she nodded with a proud glint to her eye, and he cheered significantly even with the grim topic. Spare stones on the floor of the chamber… a simple transfiguration into mice and sending them on their way… it was a miracle neither Quirrell nor Voldemort had noticed, but then again they’d been pretty pissed off at his smart mouth at the time. Maybe they

But when the light above stopped making his eyes sore and he actually took in what he was seeing, he didn’t recognize the top of his cupboard or—ah, not even his Hogwarts four-poster bed as that was the more common sight these days. That was right, he didn’t live in a cupboard or a shed for now, that was good.
“How do you know that if they sort us when we get there? Do you get to pick which house you’re in?”
“Maybe I’ll care more when the adrenaline wears off?” he offered helplessly instead, and Draco slumped into the table in front of him with an equal amount of helplessness that didn’t quite match Harry’s. And it also called attention to the lack of plate in front of him. “And you should really eat something, you know. If you’re going to fret like a hen then at least do it on a full stomach.”
“Ah… yes.” He admitted.
“You don’t say.” Draco deadpanned, but luckily Charlie seemed to miss it.
and Severus had just never known about it—which meant even the loud blabber-mouth that was James Potter had managed to keep something secret for once in his life.

“Yeah, but it’s the oddest thing so I wasn’t going to make a huge fuss just yet until I know more. You also have several poorly healed fractures that seem to be pretty old—older than this malnutrition issue for certain, and that have definitely been treated before, just not fully. It’s odd, as if you’d had them at Hogwarts and were ever in the same room as Madam Pomfrey she definitely would’ve noticed them.”
Still, as everyone liked to argue and tell him what they thought of his actions like they had any say at all in what he did as bystanders to his own life’s drama, he found that he was getting a lot less stares and people were for some reason happier to talk to him like he was an actual person now. Harry—and not

They sat it relative silence for a time, Lucius asking after the latest potion he was developing, and while Severus would love to speak in depth about it he also knew not to spill proprietary potion research to someone who would sell it to the highest bidder without a second thought if presented the chance. Lucius was his friend, but Severus wasn’t stupid either.
Fred snorted on his lunch so hard he almost choked, and George grinned from ear to ear.

, you jerk!”
Harry took a breath, mentally conjuring up that mental landscape Hermione’s book told him to visualize when he needed to center himself. It still had no clear form, but he thought it was tranquil and calming, like a garden or something.
“But they’re all my favorite!” She frowned, honestly troubled by this. Harry had sat next to her in Transfiguration one day in his rounds of his year mates, trying to get to know everyone and her being no exception, however Transfiguration might not have been the best class to choose do to that with. She’d seen him go at it with McGonagall and now had it in her head that he was just as much as an academic as she was, which was just painfully not true.
One of the twins threw his head back, laughing heartily when he heard that complaint.

The day had been long, but it wasn’t over yet as Harry finally escaped and wearily climbed his way up to Gryffindor tower. He was so tired, he was sad to realize he hadn’t even noticed when his
If he was alone, the thinness around his face meant he had not seen a healer and likely did not know how to go about doing so—or perhaps wasn’t willing. Either way the first thing they’d need to do was get some nutrition potions into him; perhaps a tip to Severus to give him a detention delivering potions to the hospital wing would do it—Pomfrey would see his poor health a mile away and that would take care of that at least. No matter her affiliations she was a good healer.
“Fine. Whatever. What are you going to do.” He ground out flatly, and she huffed.
Dudley had never been told no in his entire life, but the second he started banging on the shed door while Harry was inside scrubbing the kitchen floor, Petunia had run out in only her slippers and dragged him inside once more. She then did the unthinkable and told Harry not to cook Dudley a single sweet that night.
It also explained why he was so twisted up in knots every time he had to write home to his parents—it sounded like a freaking mine-field to navigate, which had to be hard considering he very much did actually love them as his parents on top of needing to be on his toes with them.
Like he had something in
"Nice hair you got there,”
“Look, not that I care about your feelings but… hm, how to say this delicately?” Blaise drawled rather sardonically, but he actually did hesitate as if trying to figure out his words. Harry rolled his eyes and spared him the trouble.
And a man with long black hair and the eeriest pair of blue-silver eyes seemed to casually lean into frame, one arm up to lean on James Potter’s shoulder like it was only natural. His eyes were alight with life and laughter, and even young as he was he had lines at the corners of his eyes from how free-spirited he seemed to be. He was handsome and relaxed, silent as they all were but Harry could see him saying something that made his parents crinkle their eyes in delight.
Inspiration hadn’t just come because he wanted it to last year, the opportunity had simply fallen into his lap and the idea to use it just popped into his head one day

Neville… crossed in front of him to return to the flower bed he was tending, and Harry dutifully followed to crouch beside him as he picked at a few stray weeds here and there. The silence always got to him eventually and Harry wanted to help with the weeding just for something to do, but knew he’d probably just get in his way so he kept his hands to himself for now, and watched him work.
At some point while he was screaming on the ground, a clear thought filtered through the agony in his brain and reminded him that he

Daphne tilted her head, long black hair pooling over her shoulder, and she took a moment to push it back to give herself a moment to think of her answer. “Yes, technically. But there’s definitely more—Pansy would hate you because her parents have told her to hex the hell out of you if she ever gets the chance to, and you’re a half-blood on top of it all.

And the man with blue eyes seemed to lean around James as if to touch Harry’s hair too—only when he pulled away Harry saw a tiny clip in his hair. It seemed to be made of diamonds, in the shape of a tiny paw print.
As he was up to third year level now, he had a basic understanding of how to quantify these inherently unquantifiable things when mastering new spells. And with his
Which meant clearly he
Harry acknowledged silently. Mr. Greengrass was not his daughter, and he could be making deals with the dark lord himself if that were possible, or literally just anyone else who wanted something out of Harry Potter the myth, or even the boy himself. Or perhaps he wanted something badly enough, who would turn down a favor from the Boy Who Lived if he offered it as a trade?
Vernon seemed to be a man on a mission and ignored him entirely.
coughed out for Harry’s benefit, and then she was gone into the bustle of people watching the showdown curiously as they made their way to lunch.
While the Zabini and Greengrass families were both neutral, that’s about where the similarities between the two stopped. It was like talking about quidditch and garden gnomes.
Axeclaw really didn’t have any facial expression aside from scowling, but Harry got the impression he was satisfied with that. Maybe he just didn’t want to deal with emotional humans, which Harry could kind of empathize with.
he was holding off on that for the time being.
Another thing he’d noted: George had a bit shorter temper than his brother and some of the more vicious pranks they got up to were definitely the majority his idea. Fred was always down for a prank without question no matter how devious of course, but he was fractionally more forgiving and less vengeance-oriented than his twin. Which, if Harry wanted to avoid being the center of too many pranks moving forward, was
His jaw clenched and unclenched almost by force, and he had to stop weeding for a second to steady himself before busying himself dusting the dirt of the edge of the flower bed, which incidentally had him facing pointedly away from Harry to do it. “All purebloods are sort of related. We all know about each other in some way.” He finally got out.
Harry thought it decidedly deserving, but kept his expression neutral.

“Well, that settles that! Time to go tell everyone!” He was loud enough and also uncaring enough that there was no way the whole common room hadn’t heard that, and also no way they didn’t see the mild glare he shot down at Harry before he went. “I know I promised but waiting this long has been

That amusing thought helped him regain his mental clarity enough to remember not to hit the boy in front of him, and instead form an actual human response.
“It’s just not cursed or Madam Pince hasn’t read it yet to know itty bitty first years shouldn’t be reading it yet—and there’s thousands of books so it’s probably not hard if you keep looking!”
He was so shocked by the sudden change and the sudden touch, he didn’t even have time to feel afraid.
He did find his Hogwarts letter eventually and made a list of what he’d need, but also a separate list of things he could do before Draco got there. He wanted to show Draco Contrair Alley but he wasn’t sure if the pureblood would actually be up for buying anything there, so he got those stops out of the way first. That way he could hang around if Draco wanted to shop, but he
he’d said it sounded like in his head but… it was honestly a very unnerving language to hear coming from a human mouth. Much less
“Hermione?” He called out through the door.
Eventually, Draco perked up and tossed his head back, abruptly regaining some of his bravado.
“You’re my favorite Gryffindor, you know that?” He hummed.
There was something to be said for earnest, non-manipulative praise because of

Harry hadn’t known a thing about the wizarding world until his Hogwarts letter, because his muggle relatives hadn’t told him a damn thing. And if he didn’t know about the wizarding world, he didn’t know his parents were magical. Which meant he hadn’t known how they died.
“The last, you above all should know of. The killing curse.” McGonagall explained grimly, and Harry didn’t really need her to elaborate more on it. “That is… another reason you are so well known. When He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named came to kill you ten years ago, not only was he destroyed which ended the war and earned you the thanks of many, but he also attempted to use the killing curse to do it and it

subject for this, but Transfiguration was easy for him and with McGonagall willingly, and seemingly out of nowhere, offering her assistance not even realizing what he was actually planning, Harry couldn’t exactly pass up that unexpected gift.
"I'm not sure. 'Because magic' seems to pacify most people."
“We can mimic the muggle way of calling it if you’d like—they’re called divisions, so a division 1 team is better than a division 2 team, and so forth. I figure, if there’s not enough people for a division 1 or 2 game, we can make it work with people who want to stretch themselves or something by trying out a different division.” Dean stepped up to take some charge as well, but even despite Lu and Dean seeming to know exactly what they were talking about, there was still a lot of uncertain faces milling around the group.
They weren’t going to take him alive if they tried.
family knew after Potter’s incident several weeks ago. Quirrell had been possessed, the dark lord was still around, and everyone was now making plans just as he was for that inevitability. While Severus thought he was pretty safe in his role, most others did not.
Vernon’s eyes narrowed, but he seemed to buy that his warning had been received.
"I mean we know you were raised by muggles but we know muggles some too, from our dad."
“I was grounded,” He got out, hoping the grinding of his teeth didn’t make it sound too weird. “So I missed some meals for it, yeah.”
Harry looked up, surprised by that. Did that mean…?
Axeclaw gave him a very eerily snarling smile. “You’ve given your word to accept their bloodline, therefore the right is yours. It would be… severely unpleasant, to rescind your word now, so in the eyes of our wards you are, shall we say,
without thinking it through.
“Okay? Good for him? Why did you feel the need to wake me up for this?” He groused and Blaise rolled his eyes impatiently.
“And who exactly thinks so badly of my intelligence they’d assume I’d go after a troll alone?”
That he thought his godfather would not like to hear this confession of his, and instead of using that to get what he wanted, he’d tried hard to avoid bringing it up instead. Still not a good tactic as he’d confessed himself that everyone would know soon enough but…
“But even he didn’t break out from how things are taught at Hogwarts until like NEWT level classes. To actually be
“I’ll have you know for once I didn’t do anything for this, I just would not be caught dead anywhere else when I could witness this firsthand.” Blaise chirped gleefully, and surprisingly Theo just nodded in total agreement.
But that was a petty part of himself he didn’t like to give much time in the light of day, and nor was this the moment to say something like that, so he kept his thoughts to himself.

“Try to tell that to me again when you find another hobby.”
“Don’t wait up Draco!” He shouted over his shoulder as he made his grand escape, a shell-shocked Neville being dragged along beside him and the girl struggling to keep up. He heard something loud bang in the compartment behind him but couldn’t tell what, and then he was gone, peeking into compartments curiously for a nice-looking upper year.

Ignoring the large amount of black on the racks, there were several shelves of t-shirts with colorful slogans and design that made no sense, like a pale red shirt with a giant purple handprint on the front, a pastel blue long-sleeve shirt with a big black crescent moon, one that was black and purple and pink and blue with stars like it was cut from a galaxy, and dark grey with a giant pink duck with fangs on the front…

Harry gave him an indulgent smirk. "I can understand how Ron's personality can rub you the wrong way, but it sounds like you've never even talked to him or the rest of his family.

With Harry off playing with the more experienced group, people tended to approach the people in the beginner’s group who looked like they knew what they were doing. Lu visited to give them drills and help out sometimes, but really stuck to the other group, so that kind of just left Susan. She, Hannah, and Neville were now the most-senior of the beginner’s group, and Susan herself had even played on the “division 1” team during their last ‘official/unofficial’ game they’d held. She definitely hadn’t been the best player on her team by far, but she hadn’t completely failed off the pitch either.

He gave one non-committal nod. "No. I don't like them much." He admitted. Where did he even start with this can of worms really? He gave it a second’s thought before deciding today was not the time to bring everything down with talk of the life he was leaving behind, and shook it off quickly. "They hate magic, to put it kindly. My aunt was my mother's sister and I think she was always jealous of my mom's magic.

Blaise leaned on the railing in front of him on the quidditch pitch, chin on his hand as he looked out over the as-of-yet empty fields below, waiting for the stands to fill in and the game to begin. They still had some time left, and Nott was present beside him, reading and as ever the stimulating conversationalist as he always was, so Blaise had some time to himself to consider this morning’s events.

A silky voice hissed behind him, but he couldn’t even give a thought to how oddly familiar the voice was before his world absolutely whited out in pain unlike anything he’d ever felt before. He’d really rather face a hundred trolls and have them rip his bones out to use as toothpicks in front of him than bear it even a second longer—

Harry’s starry-eyed fascination with the craftsmanship of the stone snakes was lost some by the attitude, taken aback slightly. Not that he should’ve expected anything else from a snake Slytherin himself probably enchanted to life.

You still need a lot more practice as if you'd done it correctly that club should've been solid metal—in this case it works out as that would only have done quite a bit more damage." Harry felt sweat pop up on his brow as he imagined that—
He made a lot of Hufflepuff friends as people came up to him to talk about it, cheering him on as they too were a bit annoyed with the two house rivalry, and he’d gotten an earful from both Hermione and several Ravenclaws who were appalled by the blatant display of violence. Some more chill Ravenclaws said it was enjoyable, but most thought it was pretty startling—better than the normal fighting in the halls or passive aggressive comments during class, but still not their favorite thing.

It took a little practice, but he got good at covering it, buying a few other products over time from the drug store to help hide it entirely, and then it became part of his daily routine without much thought on his part. Since he stopped complaining and acted very willing to be their chef, the Dursleys stopped locking him in at night so that he could get up and make them lusciously large breakfasts so (with a tiny, quiet alarm clock he’d also bought for himself) now had almost as much time as he wanted to get ready in the morning so long as he was neck-deep in cooking by the time his Aunt woke, got ready, and made it downstairs. He took his time to brush his hair, brush his teeth, wash his face, fix his hat, cover his scar, and adjust whatever hand me downs he was wearing at the time to be semi-presentable without causing the Dursley’s any suspicion. Since he was doing the laundry his clothes were always clean now and slightly more his size thanks to his rudimentary sewing skills and long nights in the cupboard.
He was going to have to run around the lake a couple times to work this off but he was too caught up in the thought of treacle tart to care.

The only saving grace—so says Blaise and to which Theo looked like he vehemently agreed—was that Flint was apparently dumb as a rock. He had the control pretty much by dumb luck and being good at quidditch, but a lot of the larger schemes the alliance got up to was definitely not his idea, and if he claimed anything was of his own creation, then the most common belief was that someone has just tricked him into thinking it was his idea in the first place. He was one of those loud trouble-makers who picked fights and forced other Slytherins to follow his lead in front of the other houses in the name of appearing as a united house, but there was a lot of mumblings here and there about how bloody

As it was, they had the Dean, Seamus, Lu, himself, Neville, and two Hufflepuff girls who'd been very curious but had sat out to just watch for now. He wasn't quite sure what was up with them, but he did recognize them from both the train and the sorting and having seen them around in classes. Hannah and Susan, he recalled, having literally run into Hannah on the train.
A joyous surprise though, was Draco picking up on a piece of that and asking the real question at heart here all on his own.
Ginny seemed nice enough, although she refused to look at Harry for long, seeming both terrified and interested in him at once. Not that that was unusual, but she took it to another degree by seemingly being unable to form sentences when he tried to strike up a conversation with her. And he
“The process is simple: I will need a dose of your blood and the runes of this table will automatically sample your magic as well. The blood will act as ink and fill out this enchanted parchment with your family tree; we will keep it here in your vault for safe keeping and will be provided a copy free of charge. Any additional copies requires a fee, to be determined based on the size of the tree you wish to create today.” The goblin explained as he went about his work, placing a fine silver bowl the size of a teacup with fluted edges on the edge of the table to the size of the parchment, taking a piece of what seemed to be charcoal and marking a haphazard ‘x’ in front of where Harry was sitting, and waving his hands in a complicated pattern that immediately made the paper flutter a bit as if a breeze had rushed by in the otherwise still room.

His mother smiled. “Good. Now finish your food,” she reminded him, and he suddenly recalled that he still had a nearly full plate in front of him. He dug in again, enjoying the quiet as he began brainstorming his own ideas for how to start the coming school year off correctly with this new goal in mind.
Okay, new plan: a cloths shop, and then world domination. He would probably keep that second part from McGonagall though.

He wondered if he’d get in trouble for skipping classes at a magical boarding school—if Quirrell would even notice as he hadn’t taken attendance after that first class and had let him leave early both times with so much of a stutter, Harry had already left before he got his ‘y-y-y-y-y-y-es’ out.

Maybe he could work out a deal with Madam Pomfrey…

With separate graves he could talk like he could believe their spirits were somehow hearing what he was saying—the magic of a graveyard’s illusion making it feel like for some reason they would hear him better if he were saying it to their headstones rather than literally anywhere else in the world. Like they were somehow closer to the living world when he was in a place designed specifically for them, and the memorials to their deaths.

It also filled him with a sense of excitement and heart-aching longing to wonder what was in the Potter main vault. Was there a level of history, of belonging in there too?

He sighed, tapping his quill on the page in agitation.
“Wha-” He gave a strangled gasp but he couldn’t even get it out before the wand was up again, and this time he heard it.
Not that he would’ve, given the situation at the time, but still. He wanted to know now.
“Okay, my turn. Tell me about the Slytherin first years—I know almost nothing about them so far beyond who will talk to me. Like, why does Tracy hate me? You said her family wasn’t even that involved in the last war.”
He told himself it was simply good tactics to do it now, and ignored the small voice calling him a hypocrite when not four hours ago he was telling Draco that lying to oneself was unbecoming.

It was taking a lot of effort to open his eyes though, his mind clearing in the fog as the voices got loud enough to shake him from his rest.
What was he supposed to do? Call out? Try to appeal to Vernon’s empathy one last time to just let him go?

He had a suspicion about what Draco was so tense about, but he knew his butting in wouldn’t be appreciated, so he kept his mouth shut.

When morning came, predictably he’d started up a bit violently from a nightmare—the only blessing was that he couldn’t even remember what it was about by the time he sat up fully, but it was still ungodly early and he couldn’t have been asleep more than a couple hours given the sun hadn’t risen yet.

Realistically, going by what Daphne had said last year, even if he were miraculously innocent there was no way he’d be sane enough to be an actual guardian if he were to be released. Azkaban was just that bad that people didn’t just walk away from over a decade in there perfectly
He’d had half a thought not to fall asleep out here and had pulled out Dell’s journals to try and read a bit to get his mind off things. But… he wasn’t even sure how many pages he’d actually read, much less if he’d actually absorbed any of the words on the page and not just stared at her handwriting blankly, before he was suddenly blinking blearily back to consciousness at a sudden motion nearby. It had been a solid surprise nap and he had no idea how long it had really been, but Theo had not budged from his position across from him, nor did he do more then shoot one sharp glance at their interruption before going back to his text, pointedly ignoring it.

"Morning Harry!" Fred got out first, wiping tears of mirth from his eyes.
And either Draco had been getting so much better lately but apparently getting too comfy with his parents right behind him made him forget every lesson in observation he’d ever learned because he was being pretty damn oblivious to Harry’s tension.

surprising as the whole pureblood thing meant families in history were definitely intermarrying and creating thick bushes of branches instead of linear lines, but he found it hard to believe his entire maternal line had consisted of only children for what looked to be centuries.

“Do you honestly think we’re ever going to get to practical work in Defense? Because having met Lockhart, I don’t.” He scoffed. “And Pomfrey wasn’t worried about Charms; she said second-year Charms’ spells were light enough it shouldn’t bother me. It’s mostly because I’ve put too much emphasis on Transfiguration.”

Everyone seemed to get the message—except one obnoxious party.
A lot had happened, and his mind was buzzing. As the several very important things of equal criticality he’d learned of today were just too much for him right now, his mind settled on one of the quieter, less important things he’d noticed after his conversation about Ancient and Noble houses as he sat at his desk and tiredly brought out a piece of parchment and a quill.

He lit up in joy as they walked in. “They have candy corn!”
He wasn’t sure what it meant when both girls just froze upon meeting his gaze properly, the blonde who’d run into him flushing red in embarrassment and the auburn-haired girl behind her staring with her mouth popped open in a little ‘o’.
And despite being kind of rude to admit he hadn’t cared that Harry’s only magical relative might’ve been incarcerated in hell wrongly, frankly the honesty was oddly refreshing in a way.

He didn’t want to confess he’d just fallen asleep like a child, and pointedly ignored Theo who was smirking into his book. For once Harry was thankful he just stayed quiet with his knowledge.

There were mornings like this, when the air outside your blankets was chilly and inside your cocoon of sleep was warm and toasty, and sleep itself was like a ten ton weight dragging you down even as your mind flickered out of dreamland and told you that you were awake against your wishes.

His mother had ordered him to find an excuse to bring Harry to Gringotts as he left for term, and he couldn’t believe something so blatant had just dropped into his lap like this. He was fairly certain not even his mother had seen this coming either but… well, here they were.

And I’m 100% sure they didn’t know it was dangerous, they just thought it was impressive at best. They’re reckless as heck but they’d never purposefully harm someone!” He defended his friends, a bit panicked, but she just sighed audibly to let him know she was too used to their nonsense to actually be bothered by their involvement.
