But I know you existed. I know that if I were to go to the Slytherin common room and cast that secret spell you taught me; I will find "Property of Draco Lucius Malfoy" indented into that huge, ever-glowing silver candle next to the reading tables.
The ravenette walked to the table and took a seat next to the other fourth years. Most of the other Slytherins started at Hayden, they all looked at him with curious gazes, as if trying to figure him out. Others looked at him with skepticism, even jealousy, Hayden had no idea why though.
The two had obviously formed some sort of bond, so it was a logical conclusion that Draco would know what to do.
A tense silence hung over them like a wet blanket, neither one of them knew how to try and fix it, and Draco wasn't so sure he even wanted to.
Fleur sat in a seat in the front while Hayden stood behind her. On either side of him stood both Cedric and Viktor, Cedric being a little closer than Viktor.
Severus had helped him pick out the dress he would wear the other day, and he was glad he had his help. He felt overall really comfortable in it, and the back wasn't so revealing either because of the ribbons hanging down. He was smoothing out his dress when he heard a knock on the door.
Harry had heard Hermione talk about creature inheritance once after reading a book about it. She had shared a pretty in depth summary of the whole book to both Harry and Ron once she was done with it. So he had an idea about what Severus was talking about when he said that he had gone through an inheritance.
"Also I was apparently tricked into being friends with them in the first place" Hayden added, venom creeping into his voice. Tom was angered by this statement and wanted to interject, but waited for his son to finish speaking.
"Are you sure you don't want me or my father to go to the Ministry to force them into letting you out of the tournament?" Draco asked, almost pleading with the other to let him do this.
After rushing through the portrait door, and ignoring the few still in the common room, he ran upstairs to find the door locked, again.
"Well, I think this is where we part ways" Hayden said, impatiently trying to leave so he could meet up with Draco.
"I did?" Hayden couldn't remember much of the end of the task. Now he wishes he did though as he watched Draco nod his head.
"What did you expect out of a rejection? You know, if you were rejected, you would've died within 36 hours, Hayden has a month. Now tell me which is worse, dying in 3 days, or having it being spread out throughout a month?" Severus asked
His anger seemed to suddenly leave him with that realization, he loved the other boy, he really did. How did this even happen. Why was he so upset?
"Please, d-don't. I-I, I'm sorry but I, I need to leave" Hayden rushed. He apperated away before Draco could say another word.
The apology fell on deaf ears though as Hayden continued to stare at Draco through his mask. He quickly regained his composure though once he realized he was staring.
Hayden walked through the common room, practically ignoring the existence of everyone in the room, and went straight over to his dorm room.
Draco could swear that he recognized that cold tone from a meeting he had accidently walked in on a couple months back.
Hayden watched as the gears turned in the blondes head, separately trying to figure out what was going on. Not a minute later, a look a realization flashed across his silver eyes before a look of anger hardened them.
Hayden relayed almost the entire night to his mother, all except for the part where he almost kissed Draco. Severus was so happy and proud for his son!
He closed the door to his room right as he heard the front door down stairs open. Thankfully, the Dursleys just ignored him for the rest of the night and was able to fall asleep peacefully.
He looked back towards the potions professor who was behind him and gave a small smile, receiving one in return, before looking back at himself in the mirror.
"Are you sure that you want to join my ranks? Are you truly sure this is the direction you want to go?"
It was the warmest room he had ever been in, which was an amazing comfort! Ever since he was rejected, he's been growing colder and colder, and honestly he had been feeling rather lethargic for a couple days now, so the room was a godsend.
"Alright" the raven said, the soft smile never leaving his face as Draco carefully began to lean over the edge of the tub.
While still standing near the entrance, Hayden scanned the small area for Draco. Looking for a head of blonde hair to help in his small search, but he didn't find one.
"If I could take back every threat I have ever made on you, I would. I want you to be able to feel safe with me, and I will do everything I can to make sure you do!" Tom gave his son one last squeeze before pulling back.
Severus was shocked. They had talked about this subject not too long ago and already his son had found his forever mate?
Harry closed his eyes and concentrated on his wings, after a minute or two, he felt his wings disappear into his back.
“I am not responsible for your mistakes, Draco Malfoy” Severus stated coldly but calmly. “I will not help to fix what you have broken any more than I have already. If you have failed to talk to my son and mend his heart, then you will find no sympathy with me. Good day” The professor ended with finality, going back to the essay he was grading before.
A noise from the other side of the room shook him from his musings. Looking over he saw Draco sitting up on his bed.
“I don’t mean to be rude or anything, but I am really curious, what type of creature are you?” Hermione questioned as they got started on their assignment.
Hayden's heart broke. The only family he had, never wanted him? They meant to just leave him? Tom ripped his hand away from Hayden and stood up pointing his wand toward the boy sitting on the floor, shaking with tears.
"It's perfect, mother thank you!" Hayden excitedly grabbed the dress and went to put it on as after his mother left the room
He had time, not much, but he had it. At the moment, he would much rather try and figure out what in the world is going on with Draco.
He let himself think about the month he had been at the manor. He had definitely been happier than he had been in the last couple years. Sadly, he hasn't had much time to really connect with him like he did with Sev. In a way he missed his father, even though he didn't really know him outside of being Lord Voldemort.
He cursed silently as he righted himself. Why wouldn't Hayden just listen to him? He would have knocked on the door Hayden was behind, but there was nothing but an empty wall.
"We all know the only reason that Snape kid is hanging around you so much is because you're constantly getting into his trousers" Weasley sneered at the blonde.
He would have to see if Hayden was interested in going. It might be nice for him to be able relax at an event that doesn't really hold any importance.
Draco had almost caught up to him, his hand just barely brushing against the other robes. Right as he closed his hand, the ravenette turned and his hand grasped at empty air.
"No, of course you didn't, huh. Why would you? I bet you've been slipping me Amortentia haven't you? How did you do it, huh? How were you able to mask it so well that I couldn't even detect it?" Draco finally yelled.
"I'm joking, but it is a serious matter that requires attention sooner rather than later," Sev said, chuckling at Hayden's reaction.
"Alright, I guess? I could always be doing better, but, ya know" Hayden said, seemingly resigned to his fate.
"Yes I am" Malfoy growled lowly. "You know I find myself wondering how you two can manage to get into even more trouble without your infuriating leader"
"I'm doing good, father! I love it here!" Hayden responds with a smile, sitting up so he was beside his father. Tom gives a happy smile back at him.
"Sleep well, love" Draco whispered before getting up and silently leaving the room to go back to the common room.
"So, you're the new student then" Malfoy said, now leaning against the door frame where Weasley and Granger once stood.
“Well, we were all just so worried about you. You missed the last couple weeks of school before winter break and nobody had known where you were or what exactly had happened” Hermione explained matter of factly.
The blonde's eyes flickered down to Hayden's lips before looking back in his eyes. At the others' response, Draco leaned forward even more, closing the small gap between them to gently press his lip against the others.
After a couple minutes of putting things together to see if they worked or not, Draco found the perfect outfit to leave out for Hayden.
Harry wondered. Unexpectedly, the door opened and Harry dove back under the blankets, suddenly scared about who's house he might be in.
"Unfortunately I have not. The last time I saw him was during class this afternoon. But I must ask, why do you not know where he is?" Severus glared. He knew wherever Hayden was he was safe, so he wasn't too worried about it, but Draco paled at it.
Tom looked sadly at his son. He reached over and he wrapped Hayden in his arms and hugged him tight. At first Hayden was shocked and flinched back a little at the contact, but then hugged his father back with full force.
Both Griphook and Harry went in, but as Severus was going to follow, the goblin stopped and asked him to wait outside.
When breakfast was over, Hayden made his way over to the office room the interview was going to be in.
Ignoring the stairs of the three other students in the room, Hayden walked over to a corner in the room wanting to be alone. He leaned back against the wall, closing his eyes, waiting for the staff to come and start berating him.
“Just Ron, I promise. I think Viktor might’ve seen as well and Loony Lovegood” the girl explained as fast as she could.
Hayden closed his eyes, hiding his face into his arms as if to shield himself from the man berating him. "After all this family has done for you, taken you in and gave you a bed and the clothes on your back, this is how you repay us! By stealing from my precious son!" Hayden shook from fear, tears running down his face. He knew what was coming, maybe if he stayed quiet it would end faster.
“I-I” before the Gryffindor could give him a proper answer, they were interrupted by some else interjecting.
The doors to the Great Hall opened and at least 20 girls came striding into the room, a giant of a lady walking behind them. She was even bigger than Hagrid!
After a minute of no one getting up, Theo finally stood, giving a heavy sigh, "Guess you all are wimps, huh" He muttered under breath.
"All I did was call you mate, no need to get your knickers in a twist" Weasley muttered, squirming away from Hayden's gaze.
When they had finished, Hayden had flopped down on his bed and almost immediately, he was asleep. Severus tucked him into his bed with a smile and silently left the room.
Unfortunately he had to put it down as he went to his door to see Draco standing there. The man had to hold back a disappointed growl as he stared at the blonde Veela in front of him.
"Mmm...'bout what?" Draco asked as he put an elbow on the edge of the tub in order to prop up his head easier.
All-in-all, it wasn't that bad, mundane stuff if Hayden was being honest. It was rather boring, but was necessary.
He desperately wanted to see his son and get to know him, but at the same time, he feared that Hayden wouldn't want anything to do with him because of who he was.
"Is anyone even still alive down here? When was the last you put someone here?" Hayden asked, noticing the almost echoing silence of the dungeon.
“If you would like, I would be honored to escort you back to your common room. At least there you might be free from idiots such as this” Viktor responded, sneering at the Hufflepuff and effectively cutting off the angered sixth year while extending out a hand to Hayden at the same time.
As a result of these feelings, Draco's potion was beginning to suffer. The potion was supposed to be turning a deep cobalt blue, but was instead varying on the side of lavender, and Draco had yet to really notice.
Meanwhile Hayden had been sleeping in a room he happened across almost completely by accident, but he was never more thankful for it. He had been wandering around the Castle and had come across the room while on the seventh floor. He had no idea how he had got up there, but in the end it was a good chance encounter.
"No, now it's almost time for dinner. Head on over to the Great Hall before it becomes too crowded" Sev said, standing up from where he sat.
"Oh, uh, yeah. I guess, since you confided in me, the least I can do is return the favor" Draco said as he shifted on the bed.
“Hey” Draco whispered. The only response he got was a sleepy hum, but it was enough for the blond to know Hayden was listening.
The only thing that was bothering him was the fact that he couldn’t dance. He never learned how to and was a bit embarrassed because of it.
Once he was done he scurried back into the kitchen to dispose of the broken glass and to wait until breakfast was over.
"Well, this should make you even happier. Your last letter" Theo said, breaking the hug to give Hayden his letter.
Draco was confused as well. He knew that it was planned to enter Harry Potter into the tournament from talking with his father, but he had been told that the plan was called off and that no such thing would happen. So then how did that happen, and with Hayden Snape no less?
Draco didn't really know what to do, he had never had to deal with someone who had nightmares before.
Hayden apperated straight to his bedroom in the Riddle Manor. Taking off his mask, he couldn't help but notice the warmth in his cheeks.
Hayden looked at Narcissa, she seemed nice enough. This is really the first time he was meeting her. She definitely looked like she belonged to the Malfoy name.
The second Hayden lands his wings burst from his back, ripping a hole in the back of his uniform where his fiery wings were.
"I just don't trust those Beauxbaton girls, they just rub me the wrong way, I suppose" Draco said while putting down his book to look at Hayden. "And I don't like the Bulgarians either. They are far too smug for their own good" Draco said.
"Mum? Are you here?" he called once more, again no response. Hayden shrugged at the silence, walking over to the black leather couch that sat in front of a smaller fireplace than what the common room held. It was rather cozy.
"But I want to," the blonde interrupted. "I want to, I want you to know that I'm like you. I have creature blood as well"
Meanwhile, Hayden was outside sitting against a tree near the Black Lake while he did his homework. He was about halfway through an essay for DADA, ironic considering who he was.
He still needed to figure out how to deal with that as well. The death of Harry Potter. He should probably talk with his father about that sometime soon.
"Well, it sounds like you have everything planned out. Do you want to tell me why?" Tom asked, knowing that something was up.
Maybe one day he would be more comfortable in these types of dresses, but because of his scars, he just didn't want the added attention they were sure to bring.
"Don't call me that," He stated. Skeeter seemed taken aback at the small outburst, before resuming her normal persona.
"Hayden!" Draco called as he rushed out of his bed to go help Hayden. Draco wrapped an arm around Hayden's waist, the other reaching out to the boy's arms which were still gripping the table like his life depended on it.
“Why not? I would be fully within my rights to protect you!” Draco responded with a humph, burying his head into the crook of Hayden’s neck.
He never noticed the blonde sitting right outside in the corridor waiting for him till classes started. He would just have to try again.
At first he was nervous to be going to the house of the people who had emotionally tormented him, but he felt slightly better behind the mask that Tom had given him.
Draco tilted his head, slotting their lips together to deepen their kiss before licking Hayden's lips like the raven had done earlier.
He whined in inconvenience as he peeked an eye out from his blanket, just to see that the fire he lit the night before had gone out, leaving the cold of the castle to seep through the walls of the room.
Before Hermione could open her mouth, though, Hayden had turned to face the professor with the biggest smile he could.
“If I didn't know better, I would think that Dumbledore is planning something and the Gryffindor's are just following what he tells them to like sheep” Hayden deducted.
He wasn't necessarily angry with any one person, but with himself. The completely heartbroken look in Haydens eyes will haunt him for months. He can't believe that he did that to him, it tore him up inside.
The raven boy sighed as he attempted standing from his chair, attempting to be the key word here. As soon as he put his weight over his legs, they buckled underneath him, forcing him to grab the edge of the desk so he wouldn't topple over onto the floor.
He looked down at himself not noticing a thing, he grew slightly worried because of the mysterious force not letting him up.
Hayden quietly walked in, trying not to make a sound as he watched Draco rummage around his truck. Soon he stood his arms filled with clothes.
Theo walked over a little table where a long box sat. Picking it up, he made his way back to where Hayden waited.
"Every year around this time we hold a reception of sorts for the recently inducted members of our cause. I would like you to attend this year" Tom told a surprised Hayden.
“Where’s the fun in that?” Hayden whispered with a devilish grin as leaned up into Draco only to bring the blond down on top of him and into a kiss.
“What do you mean trouble? Did someone touch you? Who was it?” Draco demanded, ready to kill whoever hurt his love.
He shifted uncomfortably in the bed before noticing his wings were out. That must have been what was weighing him down. He relaxed as he calmed down.
It was Monday, so most of the other Slytherins, including Draco were in class. Hayden, though, was excused because of the interview with the Daily Prophet, which was where he just came from.
"I wanted to ask you a question," Tom said as he entered the room, sitting on the chair by the desk. Hayden nodded for him to continue.
After getting dressed, Draco went over to Hayden's side of the room and opened his closet looking to see what exactly he had.
Hayden woke up the next morning shivering, cold and miserable. No matter how far he burrowed under the blankets in his nest, he couldn't escape the chill that was settling into his bones.
Now he didn't feel so bad about crushing on the other boy. But wait, does that mean that Hayden was the one meeting his father that day?
Hayden didn't really pay attention. He looked around the hall, seeing all three schools there and the headmasters for each. There weren't many teachers from Hogwarts there, if any at all. After looking around for a minute more though, he could spot his mother standing in a darkened corner.
"This castle would not only be your home this year, but home to some very special guests as well, you see, Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event" He paused, for dramatic effect, of course.
"I want to know everything! Who is it? What house are they in? Are they from Hogwarts or from a visiting school? How did you two meet?" Sev asked rapidly with a giddy smile on his face.
"Um, sure, what is it?" Hayden asked, not exactly sure if he should believe whatever the other says.
“I’m not entirely sure as it has been a while. I think it might be Devin, possibly Gavin. Nikoli died a couple months ago, but I could very possibly be getting them mixed up…” Voldemort said thoughtfully.
"You might not realize this, but you've managed to sway the hearts of pretty much everyone in our House. Now of course I know that you have something going on with Draco that you're probably wanting to keep secret. Don't worry, I won't tell"
Severus didn't know what to do, he didn't know how to console his son and tell him it would be alright.
A name flew out of the cup and landed into the Headmaster's hands. He mumbled the name to himself before saying it louder.
The girls seemed to wither and close into herself under the intensity of the glare pinned in her. Finding it in herself, she started to elaborate on her previous statement.
Harry was a bit nervous, though. Severus had told him that they were going to get an inheritance test, but Harry didn't quite know what that meant.
Severus just wanted to leave and keep Hayden to himself if this was how Tom was going to act, but he was trying to think of his son and put him first. He knew that Hayden would want to at least meet his dad.
"Well, the reason for that is because Phoenixes have extremely bright magical cores, but once rejected that light will slowly start to burn out. They will grow cold and distant. As their fire dies out, so will they" Severus explained.
"I would be surprised if he doesn't respond by morning," Sev said, leaning down to ruffle his son's hair.
He looked over to the beautiful sleeping boy in the next bed and almost thought twice about starting this early and leaving him for a morning alone.
“I don’t need any of your help. I am completely capable of doing my coursework on my own” Hayden sneered, growing more and more frustrated by the second.
"I mean, not really. They've just, been kinda, ignoring me a lot lately. They've seemed to distance themselves from me the past year or so and they haven't written to me at all during the summer. I'm just not sure they still want to be friends with me is all. It's not like I blame them or anything, I have indirectly put them in a lot of danger" Hayden replied with.
Harry ran back up the stairs and into his room. The Dursley were back any minute now from their vacation and Harry didn't dare show his face. He didn't want to ruin their good mood with his freakish face.
He quickly found the blonde in the halls before he could get the Great Hall for lunch. Grabbing his arm, he began to lead him to the Slytherin common rooms.
"Hayden, I couldn't have asked for a better successor and son. I know you will do great things, with or without me and I am honored that you would rather be with me. Thank you" Tom said as he hugged Hayden tighter, tears falling from both of their eyes.
"You are so insensitive you know that? He could be dead for all we know and all you care about is a false sense of superiority!" Granger said, false tears filling her eyes.
"Well yeah, but I don't see why that has anything to do with you. You're not him so why should I care?" Draco said, his tone becoming irritated. Why wasn't Hayden answering his questions? What was so important about that Potter bastard?
"I know that you can handle yourself, but still. I can't just stand by and watch you get hurt or even die Hayden!"
He wanted to ask Hayden to see what was really going on, but now wasn't the time. He needed to provide comfort for his son, hopefully he'll find out soon though.
Draco was miserable and almost downright depressed. His Veela was tearing him up inside for practically crushing the one he loved and then never making up for it. It's not like he hasn't tried to mend things between them though, he just can’t find Hayden!
Thankfully the castle answered his prayers and the plain wooden door he had come accustomed to appeared before, allowing him to rush through and close behind him.
"Calm down, I'll send him in" Severus gave Tom a quick peck on the cheek before turning to the door. He opened it, revealing Hayden.
The two followed Griphook into a back room where they were seated down at the desk. Griphook took out a piece of parchment and laid it in front of Harry. He handed a needle to Harry and asked him to drop three drops of blood onto the center of the parchment.
Hayden just giggled silently to himself. He was not expecting them to act like this, he kinda enjoyed it.
Unfortunately, luck was not with as it immediately started to pour. Hayden just stood there, wondering why all this was deciding to happen to him now. He briefly wondered what would happen if he just stayed here in the rain, would he die of hypothermia? He kinda hoped so, but then again, he still had things to do before he died.
Severus smiled back at him. "You figured it out, now let's get you back to bed. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow"
Sighing, Hayden packed up his stuff and stood up, stretching his arms above his head. It would take a couple minutes before he could get back to the castle, he hoped that the rain would be light, at least until he got inside.
Until then, Severus sat back down in his arm chair and picked his book back up, hoping that Hayden would feel a bit better after sleeping.
"Are you ready to go down?" his father asked while holding out his arm. Hayden smiled and took his father's arm as they went out of the room and down the stairs that led to the ballroom.
They walked into the grand building and up to the front of the bank where Griphook sat and asked to do a test on Harry's inheritances.
Blaise and Draco spent a few minutes more just talking about useless subjects. Soon Draco was able to escape his friend and went back to check on his hopefully soon to be boyfriend.
Harry looked over the words on the parchment three times, making sure that what he was seeing wasn't a mistake, before putting it down.
"It is perfectly normal, in fact it is to be expected. Because you are a submissive you tend to look a bit more feminine. It is normal for you to want to wear a dress. As long as you feel comfortable, you can wear whatever you want" Hayden smiled.
"Thank you for the warning, but i'm sure i'll be just fine. I have had to deal with the press before" Hayden informed the girl.
"As much as I would like to continue, it's late and we need to get back to bed. Especially if you want to be ready and well rested for tomorrow," Draco said, returning to a kneeled spot by the tub.
Hayden couldn't believe what he was hearing. The fact that Draco loved him, so much so that he wanted to be with him forever. The thought melted his heart into a big happy fluttery mess.
He had never been so grateful for those classes Madame Pomphrey had made all the teachers attend at the beginning of every year.
"-about to compete against 3 students! Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?"
He couldn't help but enjoy the looks Malfoy gave him, strangely enough. Shockingly, he didn't see an ounce of malice in his silver gaze.
I have decided that I will be keeping the A/N because I don't want to delete all your uplifting comments, I hope you all don't mind!
“I guess? It might just be a part of her plan to befriend me. I never told her that I was though, and I don’t think she’ll be able to figure it out either. But, I guess now that you mention it, the Gryffindor's have been a bit nicer since this semester started” Hayden responded with a tired sigh.
Once he got up to their room, he paused, taking a breath, preparing himself for an argument that he hoped would not come.
One question, when events come up in the future like the Yule Ball and other celebrations where Hayden and Draco dress up, do you all like when I post pictures of the outfits, or would you all rather prefer links instead?
"I-I" Hayden tried, but he couldn't form his thoughts coherently. He breathed heavily before trying to speak again.
After arranging other details for the upcoming school year, Hayden finally went back up stairs to get ready for bed. Tomorrow he would be waking up early and apperating to Kings Cross with Snape.
As discreetly as possible, Hayden opened the door to a study room attached to the main room. It was a good sized room with a desk and a couple bookshelves, a window sat in between the two selves with a comfy looking window seat below the glass.
"And now our friends from the north. Please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and their high master, Igor Karkarov!"
"AWWWW!"Pansy cried, absolutely loving how adorable they were after reading the letter over Hayden's shoulder.
After about a half an hour Hayden's arm was finally healed of the burn with almost no scarring, only a light discoloration on the inside of his elbow.
I will be deleting this A/N a couple days before I post the next chapter, so there's something to look for!
“Fine, lead the way” Hayden muttered as he placed his smaller palm within Viktor's bigger one. Gently, he pulled the Slytherin out of the library. The glare Viktor sent Cedric was just daring him to try and stop him.
"Hmm? Oh, just some Mudblood that thought they could make a difference. Disgusting" Tom answered his son.
Draco smiled, content to just lay with Hayden for a moment more before he made himself get back up, standing from where he laid.
As it neared the end of the day, Harry was done with all but a few things on the list, but first he needed to make dinner.
It was easier said than done. Somehow, everywhere Hayden went it seemed the Draco was always there before him!
A few days later, during the next Death Eater meeting, Tom had a surprise for his followers, one that Nagini took great pleasure in.
Hayden finally woke up almost three hours later on Severus couch. It took a minute for him to remember where he was and why he was there, but as soon as he did, he wished he could forget again.
After a moment, Tom spoke up again. "I would like to introduce you to some of my most trusted Death Eaters"
Taking out one of the bars of chocolate, he noticed a letter. He picked it up, opened it and began to read:
After making sure that the man wouldn’t wake up prematurely, he levitated him out of the cell and up the stairs and through the mansion until they came to the guest room that Tom gave Hayden permission to use.
"We'll talk about that after your mating with Draco, if you mate with him. It's your choice if you want to pursue a relationship with him. Remember that, don't feel pressured by anyone, alright?"
Hayden was so engrossed in his book that it took him a couple minutes to notice the blonde, but when he did, he just sighed in annoyance.
"Hayden, what's wrong?" Draco asked, his heart dropping as he saw Hayden's face morph from happiness to something else entirely.
Hayden smiled as he answered, "Amazing!" Finally, he opened his eyes only to find silver looking lovingly back at him.
Hayden soon deducted that his room was at the end of the hall, seeing as he hadn't come across his name yet. Soon enough, though, he found it but when he saw who he would be rooming with, he felt his face flush a slight pink colour.
Draco had obviously started to change his clothes but never seemed to finish. He stood at the wardrobe in a pair of black pressed slacks -part of the school uniform- and a white button up, the rest of the school uniform laid spread out against his bed.
I'm not trying to make excuses or anything, but if you guys are wondering what the hold up is, I have had a lot on plate for the past couple of weeks.
"Hmm, speaking of your parents, how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, or worse, a psychotic death wish?"
Draco quickly got up from his bed and made his way over to his roommate to see what was wrong. When he saw that Hayden was still asleep, and by the obviously pained expression on his face, he was having a nightmare.
Draco chuckled quietly to himself as he watched his mate nuzzle himself into his chest. Draco couldn't help the warm feeling in his chest as he wrapped an arm around Hayden’s waist to pull him even closer.
"What did you do?" Blaise asked Draco, a bit unnerved at the sight of tears streaming down the angry face of the new Slytherin boy.
He looked to Draco's side of the room to see the blonde sitting in a chair near his bed. He must've moved it from the desk.
"Alright then, go upstairs and get changed into something nice and we'll floo over" Hayden quickly finished his breakfast then ran up to his room to get changed.
He folded it as nice as could and laid them out on a chair and put a note for Hayden telling him to wear it on their day out on his pillow.
"These represent four very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple: collect the egg. This you must do, for each contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?"
"Oh uh, hey. I'm Ron, Ron Weasley. Who are you?" the redhead asked, sounding like he just wanted to find the sweets cart.
Severus was waiting for everyone in the common room of the dorm. He waited for everyone to find a spot in the room before he started talking.
Only a couple Slytherins were in the room when Hayden decided to make an entrance, one of whom was Theodore Nott, who is the year above Hayden.
Draco turned over to try and see what was wrong with the other, only to see Hayden tossing and turning in discomfort.
Draco couldn't help but coo at the sight. Draco walked over to the sleeping boy, making sure that his steps were quiet.
After a week had passed, it was finally time to see who the 'lucky' students to be entered into the Tournament would be.
Dumbledore stepped away from the podium where he was speaking to make way for Mr. Crouch, who seemed as though he were afraid to be there. Hayden wondered if he suspected anything.
"Oh, I have plans for him," Hayden said as he looked back to the man shivering on the floor, trying his hardest to sleep.
They both blushed when they realized they were now holding hands. They looked into each other's wide eyes, neither knew what to do. It felt nice though, it wasn't awkward at all, in fact, there was a sense of belonging instead.
"Mr. Snape, could you come with me please?" She said as if there was no other choice but to follow her.
“Miss Granger, Mister Snape. Is there a problem?” McGonagall spoke above them from where she stood in front of their desk. She had been doing her rounds around the classroom to make sure everything was going smoothly when she saw what looked like two of her best students arguing. Upon walking closer, she could just make out the tears starting to form in the corners of the brunettes eyes.
“Why would I go with you?” Hayden demanded incredulously, finally coming out of his thoughts at the question directed towards him.
"Oh nothing, it's just a little hard to imagine the hard and emotionally stunted Draco Malfoy to be soft and doting much less loving" Hayden teased with a smirk.
He slowly made his way to the castle, in a way he actually enjoyed the rain. Soon enough he made it back to the castle and started to climb the stairs to the seventh level. Unfortunately he wasn't the only one.
Potter only rolled his eyes. “No Draco, I’m not planning anything nefarious, as you call it. And I propose we start going through the basics separately and discuss our individual takes. We can plan further after that.”
What can I say? It was easier, to run. To hide, to flee, to never look back. Much easier than facing all of the shit that the war left behind.
I will not ever give you a reason to regret anything. You trusted me once, please trust me once more. For all the pain the Wizarding world has put you through, I don’t expect you to come back. I’m touched that you would still do for me. But I don’t want you to. I don’t know if you still find my arms the safest place (you talk in your sleep), but you are still my home. So
So then he used other people, made my mother and my father both torture me, over and over again. I still hear my mother’s sobs, as I writhed on the floor. My father never showed any emotion - I hear he’s in Azkaban now.
See you at 5 (I’ll be the one looking woefully unenthused but also very, very thankful, fuck me, you have no idea).
It was easier, I think, to leave without telling you goodbye. Less painful, perhaps, because I knew you would try to stop me. I knew you would burn down the world in a heartbeat, face Voldemort again. It’s always been your personality, your infuriating, beautiful personality, to give up everything for someone you love.
He tortured me in the Manor. Tortured me and tortured me, over and over again, cut after tear after snap. I never knew why - perhaps he used me as a warning, a reminder to not fail him.
He all but ran outside, Apparating immediately when he could. Where he landed was not how Harry had imagined the place to be like at all. Nevertheless, he was going to look for the blond dumbass and get him out safely. No sooner had he thought that he found himself unable to move. The sound and light of Petrificus Totalus registered later. He could disarm whoever it was wandlessly, once he saw them.
Promise me you won’t interfere. I’m going to try my best. And if that’s not enough, that’s okay. I deserve to pay for my crimes anyway.” With that, he walked away.
Ok. I do want there to be a next time, in case that wasn’t clear yesterday. I’d be gutted if this got fucked up because I’m not very good at talking about my feelings. So, yeah. I said it. It’s said. I like you. There you go, I said that too. (Why is that so nerve-wracking?)
Crystal assures me you’ll be receiving an extra-large pink box tomorrow, specially curated by her and a very perky young man called Kinloch. I’m quite intrigued as to what exactly will be in it myself, since, when I described you, they were very forthcoming with ideas. I didn’t want to spoil their fun, so I gave them your account number and told them to go wild and make up the “Deluxe Plus Butt Stuff Box”. If you’re confused about any of it, let me know. After a FUCKING HOUR in there I’m very well versed in any and all things one might want to use to smack, tickle or stick in places.
Saviour of Wizarding World tag. I’m making you take this leave, so you don’t have a chance to pull weird shit like this again just before you’re to meet me. You do not have an excuse to be late tomorrow. Or I’ll make good on my promise of making you regret something or the other.
And I’m apologizing in advance for the painful back that you will no doubt have in the morning, what with you passing out on the couch. I am in no condition myself to walk more than the distance from your drawing room to the guest room, let alone to shift you to a proper bed
You had better be a better boyfriend than you are a friend. I had a look at my Gringotts account this morning. Not only did you
Also, I would like to point out you’re a lying bastard, since you said you wanted to know if I was seeing anyone “for the gossip”, when clearly it was because you wanted all this (hot mess that I am). And while being a lying bastard is generally frowned upon, I… am very glad you’re into it. And that I didn’t have to make the first move, haha.
They followed the movement of the little-demons-made-of-jelly with their eyes and found Luna waving her arms senselessly while also.. was that singing they heard? Was she waving at them? Luna kept smiling and as she moved her hands, the bats disappeared into the garden.
“Hey, that’s the only spell I can do wordlessly, seeing that all our wands are in the car,” was the indignant reply. “You cannot judge, Mr Head Potioneer of the Unspeakables Department! You work with bat wings and bat spleen all day.”
and I will disappear from your life, like the way you did from mine, by LOOKING ME IN THE EYE. Not by leaving a Merlin-forsaken letter for me after you have already left.
Potter took so long to answer that Draco had begun to suspect that it was a joke. As Draco stirred, Potter came back to his senses, “Yes! Yes, right now,” he was smiling like a lunatic.
The scene unfolding was shocking, to say the least, and yet they shouldn't have been surprised, considering the amount of discarded bottles and glasses strewn about the two men now grabbing each other by the collar.
Even I was shocked at the alleged eloquence of my last letter. But the thing is, Draco, when you think you only have one chance of gaining back your lost world, you put everything into it, surprising everyone, even yourself.
There is a certain undeniable charm to Luna and I think it will do Pansy good to have a little help in the relationship department, she’s rather headstrong. I'm afraid we might be the only ones who can help, so what kind of friends would we be if we didn't? Thursday evening will work perfectly and I will be sure to bring enough wine to loosen everyone up. You seemed particularly keen on Gigglewater though, from what I remember of the party. I will be on your side of London earlier that day for a robe fitting with Blaise. Should be done no later than 4:00, so if you would like assistance cooking, I would be more than happy to head over early.
I’m staring at my bags right now - there are 7 of them. The apartment is empty, of furniture and of clothing. My fingers are curled around a pen - I am absentmindedly flicking it, like I’m casting a spell. You still have my wand by the way - I want it back.
“There are bats in our home?” Draco almost yelled again. “And you did not think to tell me, Potter?”
Harry only grunted. “If it stops you both from talking about Ron and Hermione’s sex life, she can do whatever the hell she wants.”
curse you for introducing that song to me). I head to my apartment. I open the door, the key scraping in the lock. I am greeted by not one, not two, but 10 different wizards meandering about in my living room.
The “box” which we received was a bloody giant crate that was big enough to fit my couch! Needless to say, that purchase has definitely assaulted my Gringotts account. Under other circumstances, I would have set a handful of your precious belongings on fire. But since I’m amused
Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night, Harry? Do you ever have the nightmares, the soul-stopping, terrifying ones, the ones where you would rather die than wake up? The ones where you’re gasping, you’re drowning, when all the pain from all the Crucios came back at once and you can’t do anything about it?
Maybe you’ll finally understand why your world only holds pain. For me at least. It’s interesting - you were saved by magic and I was damned by it.
“I wonder how you would have reacted if I had told you about the bats in Grimmauld Place,” Harry joked.
Anyway, I better get to bed now. I can barely keep my eyes open, as you can guess from my worsening penmanship through the letter. And I hope that where you end up falling asleep at night does not affect the quality of your promised pancakes. I’ll be dreaming about those tonight.
For this alone, I have a strong mind to rethink setting her up with Luna. I need a sly Slytherin by my side, not a love-sick Hufflepuff.
And war or no, you will not be used as another piece to be sacrificed. Bred to fight and die. I’ve been that enough times for both of us. You may argue that the choice to live in solitude, to undertake this job for a lifetime, is yours to make. But that is exactly is why I made it. Because you would undertake this to atone for your actions when you were still as young as fourteen. All your beliefs, your decisions, your hatred - it was all you knew. It was what you had been taught. How can I let you do that to yourself, while fully knowing that you want to be seen for who you are and not for who you should be?
We shared an intimacy that went beyond what’s normal. All our truths and secrets laid naked and bare in front of each other. For the other to see, to understand, and to accept.
There is so much I want to say that I don’t even know where to start. To be honest, I’m not even sure that you want to hear it. But I’m going to barrage on regardless, like the idiotic Gryffindor you always accused me of being, and maybe came to like.
And yes, what we had was love. Don't you dare say it wasn't, or that it was unrequited. Because if it wasn't love from your side as well, then you won't remember exactly what I need to recover from those crueller-than-life nightmares. You know what I’m talking about, and you know that since my recovery process involves you, I don’t actually recover from the dreams. I do something else that ends up making it worse. Is that what you want to hear? Because I don’t know how to answer that.
I remember, the day you convinced me to switch. The day you looked inside me, my shredded soul, and it was as if you knew. Knew everything I was going through, the way I was killing myself inside. I remember the rain, pouring down, soaking us both, your hand on mine as you whispered.
I feel silly now. Leaving you a letter even though I’ll just be two rooms away. Must be the darndest thing I’ve ever done, even under the influence of alcohol. You better deliver on your assurance of being able to cure the worst of hangovers.
“I had to leave because I would have ended up hexing her, and that is not a nice thing to have on a professional record, is it?” Harry countered.
With a bow and a crack, Kreacher disappeared.  The old elf reappeared after what seemed like hours but when he did, the boys’ joy knew no bounds and they apparated to the Ministry.
Draco thought as he stormed his way to the changing room. Life had certainly been less hell since the genocidal maniac had died, but it couldn’t be called paradise. He felt less gloomy, but the threat of Azkaban was always looming over his head. And what had transpired in the Auror trainer’s cabin had only served to remind him of his impending fate.
You’ll need to take a seat for this one. I haven’t written and rewritten so many times even for our essays in school. Trust you to make me do unexpected things.
Good lord. If I knew you were this eloquent with your letters, I may have been persuaded to write to you earlier.
And now I can’t even go back. I was a spy, Harry, one of the best. They all think I’m a murderer, one of those pure blooded fanatics, and nothing can be said about it because my cover even now can’t be blown. I remember what Shacklebolt told me, right after the fighting ended.
On the topic of finding love, how are you faring in that department? Have you been actively trying to find your one true love? I’m not trying to be intrusive, I’m just a sucker for gossip. Care to share your type? I promise not to tell.
“Oh yeah, good one babe!” Ginny exclaimed. Then proceeded to snog Luna again who was only too happy to comply.
And I know what you’ll say, Harry. God, I know you so well. I know you’ll help me, be willing to spend the rest of your life with me and I can’t have that. Because you are a hero, Harry. You are the Chosen One. You deserve so much better than me. You deserve the world.
I dreamt about you, last night. The bed always seemed too large without you in it - I turn around, reaching out for someone and awoke holding onto air.
Do you ever wonder, sometimes, what life would have been like if we were reversed? If you were the one raised in a house of Dark Magic, if I was the Chosen One? Do you ever wonder what would have happened?
Also, I expect to see you outside The Emporium of Vogue at 5 p.m. tomorrow. Mrs Lavender Brown-Patil was kind enough to give us an appointment at such short notice. In case you weren't paying attention yesterday: unless you want to look and feel as stiff as a bamboo shoot, you need new attire. I refuse to allow my perfect pictures to be ruined by having you look like a particularly slutty best man (we'll be in the same frame for Salazar’s sake!).
Draco? It made me want to kill Voldemort on the spot every time. And if it wasn’t for you or Ron or Hermione, I would have stormed off in a rage so many damn times. And for every curse you took, I punished myself.
“Potter, while it certainly is hot that you’re so cocky, I would ask you to get to the bloody point,” Draco bit out.
But now I would give up quite a few things to see the way your eyes light up when you speak about your favourite things, the way your hands fly all over the place when you’re excited. And I hope that the stunt I pulled with the Ministry does not stand in the way of this.
I’m going to repeat myself from last night (just because I can) that your warning about the bees and wearing blue could have come a bit earlier.
Well, no. You aren’t weak, nor was that moment. When will you rid yourself of all the hogwash that your father taught you? Isn’t that one of the reasons you left? You wanted to unlearn everything ingrained in you. Rediscover what it meant to be a normal person. With that brilliant brain of yours, you should have figured out by now that vulnerability is not a weakness. Wouldn’t you have preferred Lucius showing some emotion while he cast an Unforgivable on his own son, the priceless Malfoy heir?
“Master Draco, Kreacher is being very happy to see you” Kreacher shrieked, bowing beyond his old back should have allowed.
The blasted evaluation was today. They did not even have a full four days before their time was up, and this would take up another significant portion of what valuable time there was. Perfect. These sessions with the Mind Healer were usually scheduled before or after the test assignments, not during it. The reason for the overlap had been stated as lack of time before the graduation ceremony which Draco knew was bullshit.
“I had to keep a straight face and look at her while she was literally plotting my downfall in front of us.”
Do tell me what Luna thought of the evening with Pansy, and if she would be amenable to accompany my
“He’s still overprotective. I’m a lesbian, for Merlin’s sake!” Ginny kissed Luna loudly on her lips just to prove her point. And also because she wanted to. But that was beside the point.
Though, the next time, please close the wards to our homes temporarily if you plan on not leaving (or letting me leave) the house for a few days, especially when we’re due somewhere. I don’t fancy Blaise hexing me again while I’m in the
Really? Too-short time? Don’t try to speak lowly of what we had. I will not believe it. I was awake that night when you came back after the holidays. I heard what you said.
charm to get me the job! Saint Potter can’t get enough of people worshipping him and owing him favours. Explains why you’re not surprised.”
I guess we’ll never know. Though, I’m not sure that we would have won if I had been the Boy Who Lived. I don’t think I would have been brave enough.
And yet the scars never go away. You always asked me about them, the year I defected. You did seem very fascinated with them, always kissing them and touching them, brushing them whenever we kissed. You told me it was to remind myself, that whatever torture I went through did not define me.
“Fuck, Draco, I hadn’t planned on ambushing you. But that arse of yours, when you bent to pick this one and the vulgar moans you’ve been making,”
As they made their way inside, Draco couldn’t help but ask, “Harry, what spells were you using that they did not affect the bats?”
Truthfully, I have only heard from Blaise. I had half expected Hermione to come around to work on the project that Chief Warlock Clairmont has us on, but if Wealsey is in such a state it explains her absence. Though, it hasn’t stopped her from owling me a schedule. She’s a very...tenacious worker. Her methods do get us results, however, so there are worse partners to have in the Junior Wizengamot.
Only, his mind refused the moment Mafalda Hopkirk had come into view. The black hood with the wild hair and feral grin gave him flashbacks to a different time. He was now sweating profusely with his heartbeat increasing every second. He couldn’t see properly or even think clearly anymore. Just as Hopkirk was about to raise her wand again,
Instead of thanking him, she stopped him by placing a hand on his arm and proceeded to say something that rendered him frozen to the spot. He did not have time to protest Luna’s whispered reassurances of
Magic did save me later on. But it was love that saved me first. My mother’s, our friends’, your mother’s, yours. You say you dream of me and scarlet jets. Well, I dream of white. Your skin, your hair, death, the light. Is this some sort of indication?
When you ask me about nightmares, do you mean the kind of place that traps you in the worst way possible? That moves further than the physical, a place where you feel that every atom in your body is screaming at you to run, but all you can do is sink? I think you will understand when I say that you’re captured by the twisted confines of your own mind. It is a never-ending maze of memories, the most terrifying ones you possess. You think you’ve found an exit only to be led back right into a pit you think you can never crawl out of. An ambush of memories and magic and manipulation and insanity. Yes, I do have them. Yes, I did hope for you to rebuild my fragmented self. I don’t know if I still do, or if I even should.
Pansy’s uncharacteristic giggle reminded him exactly why. He’d generously helped with organizing the surprise birthday party to help his love-sick friend impress the up-and-coming Wasps player. That the birthday-person was also a close friend of his was beside the point. He narrowed his eyes at the cheesy scene unfolding in front of him. Pansy was batting her eyelids at Ginevra Weasley who was beaming at his best friend in turn. People had only started arriving and yet, with every chime of the door his nervousness increased.
It took Draco a few seconds to locate his voice, and what came out was scratchy at best. So, he tried again. “You’ve been spying this whole time?”
Next time (if there is a next time?) perhaps we can stick to the bedroom so I don’t have to start avoiding other rooms in my house just to keep my dick calm?
Harry thought to himself while he tried to get rid of the bats. He flailed his arms around after his attempted magic failed. Ginny stopped a few feet away - still carrying Draco - from Harry as he unsuccessfully tried to shoo the bats away.
Your habit of prattling on about so many different things at the same time did drive me insane. You cannot blame me though. When you’ve lived year-to-year with the intent of finishing a mission, and had to be alert for signs of danger from the age of three, everything that is not related to the next task is a distraction. I am sorry for all those times I’ve not been nice when you only did what you learnt to do for survival.
And I am desperate, Draco. I’ve been like that for a long time. I went to great lengths to find you over the last fifteen months, and it is only by chance last month that I found evidence that you were even alive. And if takes flattery to get you here, I am willing to indulge you every day for the rest of our lives. But as I said, I will understand if your freedom takes precedence.
“It was a gift from Mum, for my fifth birthday,” Luna replied as if it was the most normal pet to have.
PS. You know what, I need to see the look on your face when you open it. I’ll see you tomorrow around 2pm.
Draco supposed his plan of menacing someone would have to wait. He untangled from her softly and turned to lead her towards the gifts, wishing her a wonderful and charming year ahead.
“Of course, the Gulping Plimpies I was taking care of told me,” Luna replied as if anything of meaning could ever be understood from the Plimpies.
It was my unexpected Slytheriness that drew you to me. You loved that I could see right through you, even under all those masks. Because you wanted someone to be able to see past all the lies you created to hide your desires. You wanted all the sappiness and the declarations of forever. You dreamt of a constant, of all the forbidden touches and affection. Something you were told you shouldn't have.
Sighing lightly in relief, and smiling a somewhat natural smile of his own, Draco brought up the first thing that came to mind. Cake. “I think, I can only offer similar praises of my own after I see your cake.” He kicks himself for forgetting all his training on socializing and small talk and accepting praise. Really, when had Draco ever been bad at
Don’t make a face, Potter! You know you want to. Plus, it will give you a respite from your “needy” boss. And truly, I still don’t understand, no matter how much you explained earlier, how you thought you could get away with hexing someone (yes, even if they don’t die) and not have to do the paperwork. I refuse to believe you’re dumb enough to think that just because the wizard you hexed was queerphobic, you wouldn’t have to pay for being violent. You truly are something else.
You are finally free. Free to live. To move around. Go to all those places you’ve always wanted to go to. Without the shackles of being a Malfoy, without the shadows that you were constantly accompanied by.
And if you are angry because of how put together I seem from our correspondence, then I can only point out that you are mistaken. It is no wonder that you made your reply sound so bitter. But you are forgetting, Draco, that I can see past your defences. I can call out your bullshit. I didn’t know what I expected from your letter, but it certainly wasn’t this. It shouldn’t surprise me, considering you’ve used masks your whole life to hide the truth. About yourself, about your feelings, and most of all about what you truly want.
The man deemed the Saviour walked towards them, and Draco cursed his luck. He stood in place watching Potter hug Luna and tell her how much he’d missed her stories.
He then walked to a chair in the corner of the room and let his new-found friend eat to her heart’s content while he tentatively took a bite of the sinful-looking cake. As soon as the creamy, chocolate hit his tongue, he instinctively closed his eyes and let out a moan. It was embarrassing but since the room was empty anyway, he would allow himself to make indecent noises for the cake. No wonder the ball of fur currently nestled in is lap was so insistent.
“I don’t need another favour added to the already heavy list of what I owe you. A life debt at that.”
the bane of his life, was flirting with him? This party may not have been such a terrible idea after all.
So give up the search. Maybe it would be better for me anyway. Maybe I’m foolish, an idiot, going back to a world that has only caused me pain. Maybe I’m too trusting, so damn naive, maybe I will regret this for the rest of my life.
My favourite part was the sounds I was able to elicit from you. I suspect it will continue to remain so. Not to mention, your completely flushed and blissed-out state. My trousers have become strained from just imagining it again.
So no. No, I won’t deny what we had. How could I, when it saved me so many times? How could I, when it was the only thing getting me through the pain? I used to repeat it in my head, when they were torturing me, over and over again.
Harry started to protest just as Luna chimed in, “Is it as bad as Hermione’s prattling to cover up that she is embarrassed as well?”
5. I loved every bit of what we’ve done over the last few days. By Merlin, this is the longest I’ve missed work for sex (as if that is even a thing). But this does not mean that I regret it. I will gladly do it again and again.
What were you expecting? Sappy letters and declarations of love? Reminiscing about that too-short time we had together? Perhaps you wanted a memory, something to comfort yourself with, something to remind yourself that
Hours had passed before Harry came back but when he did, he looked strangely content. But Draco could not dwell on it much, as it was his turn with the Mind Healer. Maybe this break would do him good, Draco thought as he left.
Hope. I can already feel you thinking, of all the ways you could convince me to return. You won’t give up, will you? You never do.
I might be running late. Boss is being a needy, troll-faced bastard and insisting that if I hex people I need to write a report about it EVEN IF THEY DON’T DIE. This is needless
I know you’ve killed before, haven’t you? We both have. So you know what I’m talking about, when you end a life. The way their eyes go blank and their body stiffens and they collapse on the floor. I saw many people being killed, was forced to kill some myself. Some are defiant, some heartbroken, some brave and some so hurt they can’t even move. But it’s all the same in the end - another body on the floor.
Stunned for a moment - Draco took that as a victory - Potter swallowed and immediately removed his hands from Draco’s face - not a victory, after all, he thought with disappointment - and arranged his features in a serious expression.
was acting like everything was fine. No anger for how Draco had treated him last time. Which was good. He will be able to concentrate on the case better.
because I saw a stubborn, brave, blond git fighting with all his might to set things right. I saw you give up everything in the blasted war and vowed to make sure that your sacrifices weren’t in vain. The rest is history.
Do I ever regret it, switching sides? Sometimes, when the moonlight hits my skin and the scars show up, or when I collapse on the round because my back is shaking, or when I see the mark on my arm and I want to throw up. I tried to get rid of the mark, you see, tried cutting and burning it. I even tried slicing it off, one layer of skin at a time.
Every prayer murmured between ourselves after nightmares, every plea uttered by you when I was recovering from curses is proof of a life that was spent in Britain. Of breaths belonging to your living body. Of you having ruled the Slytherin dorms, and my heart.
“It’s Defense Against the Dark Arts. Now if you’ll excuse, I need to be getting back to my dorm” Hayden growled out, glaring at the other boy.
Without sparing a minute, Severus was up and dragging a confused Hayden out of the classroom and to his private room.
Hayden shrugged as he nuzzled into Draco’s chest, breathing deeply before telling the blond about the conversation he had with Granger earlier that morning.
"Hello" she says walking forward. "Rita Skeeter. I write for the Daily Prophet, but of course you know that don't you" She continues as she shakes our hands.
After hearing Vernon yelling, Harry quickly gathered the plates and brought them to the dinning room where his uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley were all sitting.
All these thoughts and more were going through his head as he looked all around the room before noticing the note that sat on Draco's pillow.
Another heartbreaking sob left the ravenette caused Draco to feel an immense amount of grief at making the other cry like this.
The dragon's tail seems to come out of nowhere and nails Hayden, sending him flying back into a nearby rock.
"How would you feel about meeting your father today?" Hayden was surprised. He had wanted to go meet him, but technically he already had, and he was nervous. Which made sense considering Voldemort was his father.
The seemingly famous boy suddenly looked at all the other students but paused when he met eyes with Hayden and smirked before turning to look straight in front of him.
“I know that, I’ve put many people down there, I can't remember everyone's names, can I?” Tom laughed.
Hayden couldn't help but laugh at his father. He might not have been trying to at that moment, but his father somehow had a way of lifting his spirits. Kind of ironic since it wasn’t really that long ago when his father was trying to crush his spirits.
“It was my pleasure” Victor said before reaching out to gently take one of Hayden’s hands in his own.
He got up from his bench and began wandering around Hogsmeade. After about 5 minutes, he began to rethink the letter.
Hayden suppressed a groan as Draco gave him the same sympathetic smile he had given the blonde earlier.
“Yes, Draco, what did you need?” Severus asked, barely even looking up from the abysmal essay he was grading.
"I can ask if he wants to meet you tomorrow." the black haired man said. Tom looked back up at him and smiled.
Draco returned to his room that night with too much on his mind. The two out of three trouble makers of Gryffindor had confirmed much of what Hayden had told him almost a week ago, and he couldn't have felt any worse.
"Now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived. A moment only the four of you can appreciate! Barty, the bag"
"Pity" the man hissed, his red eyes glowing with menace "you were never meant to be found, much less still be alive. What possessed you to think we would ever want filth like you back in out home"
Grabbing one of the blankets on his bed, he wrapped himself up and left his room so he could find his father.
Suddenly on guard, Hayden looked around for a hiding place before finding one behind a potted bush that his mother no doubt planted.
"Severus. What brings you into my household. Last I remembered, you wanted nothing to do with me" the brown haired man said.
Draco, I know that by now you will have been contacted by the Ministry, relieving you of your spy duties, and invited to publicly pronounce you as an ally of the Light. Don’t be furious.
Although, I suppose that was always one of my strengths, pissing you off past your limits. We know each other too well it seems. I suppose we always have.
Merlin. It’s been a long time since I’ve written those words, written anything to do with the whole shitstorm of the wizarding world. Did it ever cross your mind, Harry, that perhaps I did not want to be contacted? Did you ever think that maybe I “disappeared” for a damn good reason, that maybe I was hoping to escape everything and hopefully die alone one day?
That’s why, I went to Kingsley, and demanded he release you of the sanctions and orders given to you. The Ministry has no right letting the Wizarding world think of you as evil for their benefit.
2. The number of things we received in that package will certainly last us for years. This, by the way, is also a hint for you as to how long I’m planning on having you around. A lifetime; just in case you were not clear.
Draco was left speechless. In typical Malfoy fashion, he deflected from his emotions and instead, asked, “So, what now? What have you planned?”
You be careful - "that witch" is my friend (but you're right, she's NEVER been able to hold her liquor). Hermione has said (multiple times) that "you Gryffindors" (like she isn't one herself) are, and I quote, "braver than is healthy when it comes to over-indulgence". Usually she says it very, very loud, too early in the morning, while opening all the curtains. She's not super sympathetic. Incidentally, she was also up at some ungodly hour the morning after, clanging around in the kitchen. Before you ask, I was on the couch, alone. I expect you saw that fucking article in Witch Weekly? The one that suggested the three of us were "unnaturally close". I'm
Please don't be alarmed. I have no way of knowing how this letter has been delivered to you, so I'm not sure if you may have cast any diagnostic spells on it. But
So. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to look at my kitchen table again. Not without that feeling of confused arousal and the ghost-like sensation of syrup dripping down my arse crack. Not that the arousal is confusing, I’ve just. I dunno. I’ve never had any sort of sex on a table before. Or on a pancake, but there isn’t a stack of them in my kitchen at all times, so it’s dismissable. Right now, every time I walk in there, all I can think about is you. I’ll stand at the kettle waiting for it to boil, half-hard and wondering if I should Floo you to come over. (Should I?) I’ve repaired all the dishes and cleaned the table, both the magical and Muggle ways, but I still can’t bring myself to sit at it and eat. Last time I sat there, it was to suck you off and I can’t shake the memories out of my head. I almost fellated my toast when I had some earlier and had to eat in the lounge lest I choke on the crumbs.
For Draco’s selection, they had to solve a case that even experienced Aurors had not been able to solve. That sealed his fate then.
. Hence the need for today’s shopping trip, which I must say was a roaring success. I got new robes for myself as well. Which I shall wear tomorrow, since today’s robes will also be thrown out. Courtesy of your beloved bees. What human named them bees and not b-holes?
You know I would have stood by your side no matter what. That I would have helped you fight whatever it was that you needed to fight. Make me
I understand you now, Draco. Better than I was able to before. I’m sorry it took me this long. But never again.
sickeningly sweet. Seriously. Her “first love” (See: Theodore Nott), as she likes to call him, got his arse dumped because he called her “not romantic enough”, which translates to
“Likewise, Kreacher. Mother spoke volumes of your faithful service to the Noble House of Black. It is good to see you again” Draco smiled fondly as he said this.
I like to think we are quite the same, save for the different ways in which we grew up. You are right, Draco, about all the things you said. But even more so when you say we know each other too well. We do. That day in the rain, I did not see Draco Malfoy. I saw anguish and fear. Your eyes gave you away. They showed me everything you had been trying to hide behind the indifference.
. And if the cursed prick of a man walked in, reports would certainly get back to his mother. He shuddered at the thought. He was provided relief from more horror-inducing thoughts, and thoughts of abandonment as well, by the arrival of the birthday girl.
My front door has thrown a fit over a bit of wet mail and it won't open to anyone but Hermione. Use the side gate and come in through the garden and in my backdoor. Kitchen is on the left. See you tomorrow.
They are a menace, and I don’t buy your assurances of them being more bearable under other circumstances.
I dunno. Love seems… ugh. Like something that happens to other people? I feel like I couldn’t possibly suspend my crippling sense of realism for long enough to act all smooshy and heart-eyed and soft like everyone else seems to. Do you happen to know anyone who likes brutal honesty and blunt, artless declarations of affection these days? We should go back to just sending people we like poems written by other people that say the things that we’re not capable of saying to their face. Add that to my type. Boring, pyjamas, blunt, likes poetry.
Draco, well thank fuck, you did end up replying. Even though your reply is all coated in barbs and wires. Just like you.
I never thought it’d be you I’d gossip about my love life with, though. And it will continue to not happen. Because reporters are sneaky motherfuckers and I’m not putting anything that pathetic down in writing. Suffice to say, no, I am not in love. No, I am not on Tinder, or Grindr or Howlr, or any of those, and I’m too fucking exhausted to go out on the pull anymore. I expect I’ll come across someone nice at the supermarket eventually and we can be boring together, in our pyjamas. That’s my type. Boring in pyjamas. Try and gossip about that.
“He’s your brother. What do you expect?” Harry asked as they started the brief trek to the cabin they had rented.
You always made me do stupid things, made me think I could fly even though I was chained down. That was the part I always loved about you, the thought that you had hope in this screwed up world.
This spurred the other two into action as well. Even though Draco’s cheeks were now pink, he refused to be embarrassed or even get down. Harry sighed and jut out his for Draco to climb on while Ginny sat on the ground.
I regret having to leave just as things were turning interesting yesterday. If it wasn’t for Mother’s kneazle taking ill, I would have stayed longer. I rather enjoyed your company
Ginevra's call for attention - and when the hell did Luna slip away from them? - did not allow Draco an opportunity to overthink, and eventually freak out over the possibility that Potter might be flirting with him. Draco Malfoy's lifelong fascination, long-standing crush
“Was this an effort to up your chances getting it? Because you didn’t have to. Kingsley was involved to make sure the selection was fair!”
came a posh voice. Everything was a blur after that. He faintly registered that they had caught her as he closed his eyes.
Anyway. I still don’t believe you about the kneazle. You’re a fucking lightweight and all your talk of how other people handle their booze is bollocks because you have the fortitude of a teenage girl. Next time, we will throw you in the downstairs shower 'til you’re less embarrassing to yourself and you can sleep here. That way I can make sure you don’t choke and die in your sleep and get me blamed for it. Plus, I make pancakes that can absorb the worst regrets and the most deserved hangovers. Which is lucky because I really want to open this bottle of wine NOW. I’ll chill it. You can come back here after our (groan) shopping trip. I fancy trying that new Indian place’s spicy biryani - Dean says it’s amazing and Lisa’s afraid of it - both high praises.
“I’m impressed. You do have the ability to do things in an organized fashion. I wonder if this is a result of Auror training.”
Then there was the problem of Potter. He claimed to be a friend and had all but deserted him in that bloody cabin. He even had to salute that Proudfoot witch, even though she would be the reason he was going to be sent to Azkaban.
Another day had passed with no progress. But Draco had an idea that he wanted to test out. He had asked Harry to get Kreacher directly to the old mansion where the last robbery had taken place. Out of all the houses that had been plundered, this was the wealthiest. The gems and precious stones that had gone missing from here may have allowed the robbers to possibly retire for good.
