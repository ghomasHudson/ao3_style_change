“Yes.” Harry strapped a holster under the billowy material. “It’s dangerous, Draco. The people meeting are from two of the most dangerous groups on the planet. Who knows what might happen?”
“It was alright,” Harry said neutrally. “I’m about to head out for some sleep.” Harry made to leave when McLaggen said:
I jumped into the kitchen, ready to unleash whatever hex my drink-addled mind could come up with on the intruder– and froze.
There was a sardonic clap. Draco turned in confusion. It wasn’t from Theo, who was examining the Decoder with scientific interest, or Harry, who was busy changing out of the wetsuit.
Harry could barely move a finger, let alone his body. Dancing white spots blinded his vision, and even the gloom became more pronounced. Harry took a deep breath, trying to relax and unclench his locked muscle. He was going to pass out – if it meant sweet release from this agony right now, then –
“Well, it’s a very old magical site, steeped in lore,” I said, settling into a chair, trying to shake the sense of vertigo. “West Country especially is a region heavily associated with wizards and magic. Glastonbury Tor is there, Stonehenge …. There’s a reason why my family settled there, too. And yours. And a large number of magical families.”
I shook my head. It was difficult to fear a man when the very sight of him ignited rage, but I forced myself to remember Cross was a dangerous criminal that evaded all attempts at capture so far. His cool calculations were deadlier than mere brutal thuggery.
There was a faint itch in the back of my neck, as if I were being watched. I scratched at it. I was allowing my imagination to best me; it was the middle of the day. But when I reached my flat, I resolved to reinforce the wards and the protection spells –
“Just stay behind me, Draco.” Harry sighed in exasperated defeat. “And don’t do anything stupid like charge at the enemy.”
That didn’t sound good. The Shield might not be a fabled relic of mystical power, but if it were real, it would be a priceless artifact that belonged to the public. Draco loathed that in one stroke, it would enrich terrorists and be lost forever in criminal hands.
“A man of the world,” Draco said drily. He settled back in his chair once he was sure Fletcher wasn’t going to run. Harry settled next to Draco, standing like an angry shadow. Draco decided he rather enjoyed this, Harry’s protective – and frankly, possessive – side. “Please feel free to take a seat.”
Luna smiled. “I always knew you would be the one to find it. Call it a woman’s intuition. It’s because you have Salazar Slytherin’s blood, right?”
“I take back everything I said about you being able to handle this business,” Harry said, still fuming. “You’re clearly too impulsive.”
“He is the last living descendant with Slytherin blood,” spoke a voice from the armchair. It was a mellifluous baritone, one that lulled a feeling of soporific calm. “The key will react to blood.”
“Malfoy ….” Shacklebolt scratched his chin musingly. “I haven’t thought about them in a long time.” He turned to Harry suddenly. “You met the son, Draco, I believe?”
A fierce wind picked up. The sky, already grey with clouds, threatened to rain. Granger signaled to us – they’d finished scanning the entryway for traps. It was time to move.
Not that Harry had committed any with Malfoy, of course. But it was a fear now, one that laced the air like a poisonous miasma, that any sign of unconformity or deviancy was a threat and had to be dealt with accordingly. Only in Underground were attitudes more relaxed, which only added to the sense of its degeneracy.
“Oh Merlin, don’t compare me with your mother. It completely ruins the mood.” Blaise grinned at me, flashing a smile that reduced the even most hardhearted into rubble. “I just care, that’s all.”
“Want to get out of your robes?” I breathed out. It came in gasps and hitches as Blaise continued to work, his hand kneading and pulling at my cock. I tugged at the waistband of his briefs as he slipped out of them.
Leveling his gun again, Harry was about to let loose when Bellatrix tackled him. Her hair was askew, a mess of black hair flowing.
“Duck!” Harry shouted as a ripple of gunfire dotted the wall. He raised his rifle. Draco averted his eyes, focusing his body on grappling with one of the men, trying to wrestle the gun from the man.
Without hesitation, Harry lunged at Draco, pulling him down behind the Humvee, the armored frame shaking from the thud of the bullets.
Harry leaned back. “I have great taste in literature,” he said with wounded dignity. “I don’t think I want to read any of your boring histories. Although yours aren’t that bad – as far as historical writings go, they’re actually quite entertaining.”
Damn bureaucrats. I was at loss. Do I make an appointment? It seemed a comical response when someone tells you his life was in mortal peril. I narrowed my eyes. No doubt if it had been one of the Gryffindors or anyone else, the witch would have leapt to help. Probably accompanied by maternal fussing and offers of a warm cup of tea.
I wanted to shut my eyes. My head throbbed. I was exhausted. All I longed for was to lie down, to not think, and let sleep take me where it may.
“She is,” I said, taking the mug of coffee from him gratefully. I marveled at myself for having a conversation with Potter in the kitchen. That spun my head more than all the alcohol I imbibed earlier. “You know?”
The air froze in Harry’s lungs. Even at this current state of mind, Harry still had enough capacity to be horrified.
“No, it’s fine. This was just a whim.” And I was reluctant for Potter to change into pants that covered up more of his arse. It really was delectable.
Why did he divorce Ginerva Weasley? That could not have gone well, seeing as how the Weasleys had practically adopted him. Was that linked to his quitting the Ministry? I gave this room a quick look around. His line about pay rang false; it was true that Ministry pay was a pittance, but he was on the fast-track for Head Auror, I heard while having dinner with Astoria and her then-fiancé. And he had been so bent on it.
“Well, seeing as how Blaise was gonna leave this man with nothing, I’d reckon I’d take pity and leave him at least a bit of his senses so he can make his way back.”
Strangely, neither of us had suggested opening it. Both Harry and I knew it was a bad idea. For one, we had no idea what might happened. Dramatic pyrotechnics came to mind, and though we were in a desolate part of the moor, I shuddered at attracting the attention of all and sundry. It was already bad enough wandering around with an ancient book in my hand. It was obviously not what one carried around for light reading.
Harry told himself that making any rude gestures would be unprofessional and unbecoming of a Commander of the Auror Force.
Sunlight streamed in and pooled at the foot of the bed. I rubbed my eyes. It had been a pleasant sleep, lying next to Harry. His arm, flung across my chest, weighed comfortably. The aftermath of sex still filled the air, and the little vial of lube that Harry had, in a stroke of foresight, taken with him, rolled on its side. I grabbed it before it fell to the floor.
I nodded. “And just so you know, you need to wear your own tie this time. I returned all of Blaise’s.” Blaise, on hearing his name, turned and gave a small wave and a wink. He went back to his conversation with Weasley, of all people.
“In some ways, it did. I don’t think I realized how much the discourse around the War was in terms of black and white – Light and Dark, good and evil. Oh, I can see that my father and the Death Eaters were carrying out horrific deeds. But that wasn’t born in a vacuum, and neither was the Dark Lord’s rise. And understanding that helped, in a way, to understand how much I was at fault.”
“We’re here investigating this wand,” Malfoy said. He took out his palmtop, displayed it. “Do you recognize it?”
Bellatrix evidently thought so, too. “Shut up,” she snapped at him. “No wonder you’re reduced to an errand boy, if you can’t even handle this little bit of breeze.”
Draco tensed. “I’m having a really bad day,” he said, “and I really don’t take kindly to being kept in the dark.”
They had been the best of friends at school, from the age of eleven up until their graduation, full of dreams and hopes. Until circumstances intervened, and those dreams were crushed under the brutal heel of reality.
A flash filled the basement. Spending so much time in the darkness made it all the more blinding. My eyes watered even as I fell back. My foot caught on a piece of the flagstone, and I almost tripped. Potter’s blurry form blocked out part of the light as a loud keening cry sounded, followed by a quieter grunt of pain that I knew came from Potter.
Shacklebolt addressed Draco. “I don’t know how exposed you feel, but it might be best to move out of Malfoy Manor for the time being. It’s too conspicuous and too tempting a target, even with all your state-of-the-art security. And it’ll be easier to reach you if you were close to HQ in London.”
Gingerly, I picked myself up. Next time I needed more cushions around me. I sat on the table, staring at the book.
“Really, Potter, stop trying to show me up. But yes, you’re right. But the strange thing about this sword is that only the hilt appears to be goblin-silver; the rest is some other kind of metal. Look –”
“If you’re asking if that’s how I pick up men, no. I haven’t – well,” Draco laughed. It came out like a sharp crack of a whip. “I haven’t seen anyone in over five years.” Not counting the few random encounters, Draco had been living life that would have rivaled a monk.
Someone – a young man under the visored helmet by the looks of it – had relieved Harry of the duty to watch over Bellatrix.
I raised a hand. “I’m not trying to justify any side of the argument. I’m only explaining what likely would have been Slytherin’s mindset in his preference for purebloods. Of course, it’s an outdated idea now, and we know that people will react with fear and violence towards anything they don’t understand. Both wizards and Muggles.”
Then, after what seemed like an eternity, Potter’s eyes focused. “First ... time ... you used my name.”
“I don’t know, Malfoy, I was attacked in your kitchen.” Despite the levity in his tone, Potter frowned. “And we still haven’t caught the rest of them yet.”
“It failed, obviously,” Harry said, with a mimicry of a smile. “And I was wounded in that attempt. It had been close, but I was overconfident, and I had gotten hurt almost as badly as Riddle was.”
“Malfoy.” Now there was an edge of frustration in Potter’s tone. “I’m not asking you to marry me. I just want to talk about it. You think I’m fit, I think you’re attractive – let’s be adults about this.”
“Why are you surprised? It’s a very profitable investment. And” – Malfoy’s eyes glittered – “It’s much more interesting than staring at code all day, don’t you think? Why, it’s somehow even brought the redoubtable Commander Potter here.”
“That’s a good idea,” Potter said, “but you sure you’re ready to go back? I can go and you can stay here.”
“We’re not simply asking you to read the Grimoire to us,” Cross said, taking a sip. “We need a leader. The Blood Circle of Slytherin needs his heir to lead us to create a new world for wizards.”
“I gave you the equivalent of a muscle relaxant for your bio-enhancements,” Malfoy said. “This is a drug that is used for node connection burnouts when the web components between the human body and the Sentient Intelligence become too stressed.”
“I won’t be telling what happened today to everyone at the pub tonight, if that’s what you’re worried about, Draco,” Theo said. “After all, I don’t want any rivals to get to that treasure hoard before me.”
Even through his trousers, I could feel his erection, rapidly thickening and hard, straining at the seams. He rutted against me, his breath hot on my neck as I arched to meet him.
“Thank you,” Harry said, thankful for the training that prevented him from showing his alarm that Malfoy could tell, “but that’s not why I came.”
I poured a cup of coffee, the liquid almost splashing out and burning myself in my haste. “Is it usually your habit to wander around the house half-naked?” I didn’t look at him, focusing on making my way to the table.
The Dark Lord’s eyes went wide. The man continued: ‘In exchange, we can help with your … experiments. I believe you wish to experiment with the magical properties of the number seven.’ He produced a scroll of parchment so old and yellowed, it was flaking onto the carpet. ‘Here are some ideas.’
“Well, for instance, the human body is a complicated machine all on its own, and there are many different parts to it. To my knowledge no one has ever built a fully functional mechanized model of the human body. And you mentioned this earlier, but the human mind and a Sentient Intelligence’s nature are very much different.” Malfoy shook his head. “Sorry, I got carried away. This area is one of my studies, and I’ve spent half my life on this.”
Harry watched Ron and Hermione’s faces carefully. It was the slightest reaction, but it was there: a tiny tightening of the corners of their mouths that gave them away.
Now that she mentioned, I noticed that she was only in a safari shirt and khaki pants without cloak or jacket or coat. It was just like her to forget London’s fall weather had a bite to it.
“Every man has his own foibles,” Harry said with a bitter smile. “Riddle’s is that he enjoys flaunting his power to his inferiors. And he considers everyone his inferiors.”
Harry cut me off with another kiss, one even deeper than our previous. “Draco. Shut up.” He guided us to an alcove.
Draco heard no response on the radio, but neither did any of the soldiers fired, either out of confusion or because they believed him. He didn’t have time to be grateful – he needed to reach Harry.
The Shield glowed, rivaling the lamp. Not in its entirety; only specific segments of the Shield did. It was the sun, the moon, the Sagittarius, and the farmer. It was some sort of luminescent coating or quality of the metalwork that allowed them to do so. Draco wanted to lean in to see what exactly was at work, but the not unformidable presence of Riddle next to him made Draco reconsider.
Blaise often joked that I should have been a Curse-Breaker, with my penchant for adventure and my yearning to make breakthroughs. But I pointed out it was in a researcher's nature to uncover the truth.
“Yessir.” Finnegan saluted. He grinned at Draco. “Hope all goes well sir. For the record, I think you were brave, coming out here like that for your friend.”
“Thank you,” Harry said curtly. “I’ll keep looking into this for now, until I’m ordered to stop. Do you have a physical address for any of these shell companies?”
The Pensieve glowed even brighter as we approached it, like it had sensed our approach, and the impending task we had for it. The bottle was warm, both from the memory inside and from where I clutched it tightly.
“Of course,” Potter said. He sat down across from me. “I’m having dinner with them sometimes this weekend.”
I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. “I don’t want to know what you’ve been reading, Harry, but your taste in literature sounds appalling. I’m going to loan you some books from my shelves once I get back to my flat.”
As to the case … this is a worrisome development. These chip schematics, if they fall into the wrong hands … who knows what damage one could do with them?
“Excuse me.” Draco stood abruptly. “I think I’m going to go outside for some air. Thank you for dinner,” he said courteously to Mrs. Weasley, who seemed taken aback by Draco’s unexpected burst of politeness.
“Oh, I don’t mean that I was unfaithful, or that I had a roving eye.” Potter gave a twisted smile. “More that I was used to being on the move, too comfortable with uncertainty and danger to really lead a domestic life. Of course, coming to the realization that I enjoyed the attention of both men and women didn’t really help settle me into domestic bliss either. It was a surprise, I tell you.”
Malfoy was not bad in bed, Harry thought, squishing the pillow into a more comfortable state. In fact … Harry stretched, letting the knotted muscles loosen out. He looked around.
Harry produced the Grimoire from under his robes. “This book can take a lot of damage. Not a scratch. I’m very impressed.”
“He’s well,” I said, a little miffed at my mother’s mocking. “I’m meeting up with him later with a couple of friends.”
“Why are you bringing wine with a duck on it for dinner with your parents? I doubt it’ll pair better with foie gras. And — hang on — is that Potter?”
He was of medium height and slender build, pale and blond and attractive in that cut-glass aristocratic way. He had the most striking pair of grey eyes that Harry had ever seen – the pair of grey eyes that had looked at Harry.
But Granger had warned me to be careful … even as that memory entered my mind, my anger became suddenly tempered by a chill of paranoia. I had to be cautious. If Granger was right – and annoyingly, she was rarely wrong – then turning to the Aurors would be a mistake.
“Sodding Gryffindors,” Draco muttered. The old House rivalry didn’t die an easy death. At least whatever Granger was doing numbed the pain. It was beginning to get difficult to think.
Damn. Harry was looking at me like he wanted to drag me off to the alley ahead and have his way with me. By this rate, we were never going to get anything done.
“That’s not why I came today, actually,” Granger said. “We’ve been keeping track of Ted Cross’ movements and we think we found one of his hideouts.”
I sat at my counter. I had meant to go to the British Library. Why did I change my mind? My intuition told me that the answer wouldn’t be there, but in Gringotts Reading Room where I found it. Pity. The British Library had much more accepting patrons, and its librarian was much friendlier.
“He told the elf this morning that he wasn’t feeling well, so I had a tray sent up to his room,” my mother said.
Draco gazed at the Shield in his hand. It was heavy, too much for his grip, and his wrist bent at an unnatural angle trying to hold on. It was special — Draco felt it in his bones. Though the Shield did not change again, it seemed to vibrate in his hands, and it was like resting on top of a ca hood with the engine pulsing under.
“Draco!” Harry grabbed me, pulling me back. He severed the sleeve of my robe with a quick slash of his wand, tossing it back.
“You weren’t unreceptive to it,” Draco said. It was on the verge of his tongue to tell Harry that Draco missed him. But Draco’s courage only extended so far. So he waited.
“Well,” Draco said, “it’s possible that Homer simply heard and passed down the oral tradition of the Trojan war. So in that sense, it’s very possible that Achilles’ shield is a real item, albeit embellished. It could be that Achilles was a very real man, a war chief or warrior who participated in the fight against the Trojans, and his exploits became legendary.” He paused. “But the theory gets crazier from here. The fringe thinking goes that not only was the shield real, but it was actually forged by the gods themselves and had the ability to show the truth of the world. So in other words, it has some clairvoyant or such properties.”
“Who is your master?” Draco asked. “What else do you want from me?” He narrowed his eyes. “Was this just all a trap to lure us out here?” It was awful to think that he was the reason he and Harry were captured.
Draco did, in fact, had many clues about the Shield’s existence, like the fact that he had held it in his own hands. Disappointingly, he did not have any idea about its current location except that it was likely headed to the hands of a madman.
“Yes.” Draco was breathing hard. His arms and legs were sore, bruised from the struggle beforehand. Draco was sure he would look like a patchwork of colors come tomorrow morning. “You?”
“That little thing is all you found?” he asked, not bothering to hide his disappointment. “Nothing else?”
“We’re not old,” I said. I favored Harry with a small smile. “Just mature. And you more so than me – you’re the one that’s a father.”
I tongued the tip, making a face at the taste of precum. Harry made a low noise, pushing; I almost gagged at the unexpectedness of it.
Potter nodded. “I know I said I didn’t think you needed it, but I’m changing my mind. I think the situation calls for it.”
Our relationship had drastically improved. He still took every opportunity he could to lecture me on the duties of a proper Malfoy, but at least we no longer ended our conversations in screaming matches.
“They are quite beautiful to look at, aren’t they?” Riddle asked, emerging from the shadows. “The ancients were quite skilled at creating works of art.”
“Where’s your sense of adventure, Harry? As I recall, you seem to be the one who always traipsed around the Forbidden Forest when we were in school.”
“You know what I’m talking about. The key to Grimoire. You, the blood of Slytherin. You will lead us to it or feel even more pain –”
I settled finally for a cream sweater that I had bought on sale at Selfridges two years ago, and a pair of black pants tailored to accentuate the length of my legs.
Harry watched Malfoy close his eyes, occasionally making little nods and tiny expressions – brows furrowing slightly, mouth puckering in a moue -- before he blinked and stared at Harry.
“I haven’t, either. It’ll be an interesting job, that’s for certain, but I’m not sure if I can handle it.”
Not for the first time, Draco wondered how it was that he and Harry ever managed to enter a relationship in the first place, buffeted on all sides as they were by disapproving parents, friends, mentors. He supposed it had only been a matter of time before what they had ended in tears.
It was a heart-stopping sojourn; every time they turned a corner, Draco thought his heart would burst. He almost preferred the certainty of captivity.
Draco considered the offer. The car was parked illegally in front of the recently constructed flats which would be soon joined by their brethren here.
“I could do with a nightcap at your place,” he said. “There’s a bottle of that Macallan I’ve been eyeing for a while now.”
“I think I’m going to bring in my products from my flat,” I said. “Your shampoo is horrendous. Three-in-one? Seriously?”
“Do you think Cross survived that?” Granger broke into the train of my thoughts. She shuddered. “That spell. I don’t know what it is, but I don’t think anyone could live through that. And we had surrounded the house with Anti-Apparation Jinxes and Snaring Charms.” Her face paled for a moment, as the possibility she might have trapped Cross in the house occurred to her. Then she set her expression resolutely.
“Shut up, Wormtail,” Dolohov snapped. He regarded Draco. “I think we might need to rethink our plan of taking him with us.”
It probably didn’t extend to hiding them in someone else’s house, Draco thought, but that was the least of his worries.
“They’ll be brought to heel,” Cross said dismissively. “After all, with the power of Slytherin’s Grimoire behind you, I don’t think they’ll dare to challenge you.”
Draco jumped on the second man, the butt of the pistol going straight for the temples. The man collapsed.
“I came with my professor for a dig in Turkey,” Draco said drily. “We slept in tents without cots. We didn’t even have a shower, and we all looked like we had drowned in dust after a week.”
“I assume you’ve heard of the Shield’s abilities?” At Draco’s nod, he said: “They’re true. The Shield can give you great insight into what is to come. It will be a great asset to further our master’s plans.”
It was powerful and subtle. Unlike the Dark Lord’s overwhelming brute force, the librarian’s probe sought to distract and lull one into a sense of complacency before he struck.
I assessed Harry from head to toe. “You look nice. Your hair’s in a relatively decent state for once.”
“Don’t think about it.” The guard tightened his grip as Greyback continued to rain blows on Harry. Draco stilled.
“Malfoy! What are you doing up so early? You’re usually still in bed at this time.” He replaced the newspaper on the table. His hair was still wet from his shower, and there was a faint outline in his grey joggers that could only be –
“Potter can attend too.” Riddle’s face tightened. “It is a pity that he is such a thorn at my side. He would have been such an asset. And we do so need fresh talent in this organization. Unfortunately, he has chosen to oppose me like his parents before him.”
It had been swiftly replaced by Lucius’s typical mask of patrician arrogance. Lucius had hurriedly rushed the man out of the Manor before returning.
“Oh. That.” I looked away. “Sorry. I just don’t think I’m ready, with all that’s going on.” I crooked a small smile at him. “A secret society is after me, you know.”
“It’s not ‘just a book,’” I said with exaggerated patience. “It’s a book with spells used by one of the most powerful wizards in history. A book that contains all the magic he knew. You remember the Chamber of Secrets — the Grimoire probably has the secret of how to breed and control a basilisk. Along with so many of his secrets.”
I gave him a look of sympathy. Potter carried on. “That wasn’t why I wanted to be an Auror. I wanted to help people, not fight about parchment allotments.” He grinned at me crookedly. “That’s why I went rogue and decided to start my own – well, I’m not quite sure what it is yet. Part private investigation, part security detail, I suppose. I don’t chase after lost kittens or spouses. Usually. Call me a … security consultant.”
Nor did I care much for him. Physical appreciation aside, we had nothing in common. I had no idea where to begin the conversation if we were to somehow meet at dinner. He always seemed the type that grunted his responses, as evidenced by that broad shoulder and those strong legs ... his firm handshake that clasped my hand with crushing pressure....
My steps faltered as I walked past the boarded-up storefront where Fortescue’s Ice Cream used to be.
“Nothing,” I said. “I never heard of any group that cared about Slytherin’s Grimoire until I ran into Luna today and she told me about it. Apparently there’s an article on them in the Quibbler that I haven’t even read it.”
I blame Mr. Potter and young love for spoiling my plans, of course. By the way, I feel I must claim some small measure of credit in pushing you two together. No matter; what blooms in the spring fades in the fall. I suppose I might as well inform you that I’m not done with the Grimoire – or you, for that matter.
One hand cupped my face as he leaned in. It grew more heated as I returned the kiss, becoming lost in the sensations. His thumb drew small lines on my cheek and his teeth nipped at my lip as the other grabbed my hip.
This was why I insisted on being single, I thought facetiously. Nothing compared to the luxury of an empty bed.
I felt like I had been here before ... there was a familiarity that eluded me, a misplaced piece of a puzzle that I had owned for a long time. The cave, its walls slightly glinting with wetness … the book, ancient and yet somehow timeless … I closed my eyes –
“Are you alright?” he asked, out of breath. We were tangled in a heap of limbs and robes. “What happened?”
My hope was not in vain. The scents of toast and eggs and coffee drifted out of the kitchen. I grinned. That smell always put me a good mood. Strange, too, since I was not a morning creature by nature, and only rose early by the necessities of responsibility. Perhaps instead of thinking of the restrictions on my movement, I should try and imagine this as a vacation of sorts.
Draco’s brows creased. He never received guests at the Manor. His father’s old set had all but dispersed, and Draco’s own friends all lived in London. Draco had not socialized with any of the local villagers; he had only stepped into the local post office once.
Yes, Hedwig replied. We have prevented a massive influx of Elixir. By my estimation, it should result in a 0.3% decrease in violent crimes in the City and a 0.013% decrease in Underground.
Speaking of which, Harry had brought his own gear. He dropped a heavy duffel from his back. It landed with a thud. Cameras, with titanium housing and controls that could fine tune the image even while taking it underwater. There were two miniature ones that could easily be attached to the diving masks.
“No,” Dolohov said. He, too, glanced at the object curiously. “And I was imagining something bigger.”
Draco ran his hand over them. Despite his logic, Draco hesitated. He knew it was all nonsense, but his heart still thumped. It was a ridiculous reaction – there wasn’t any information that these cards could convey that would be useful.
She narrowed her eyes, looking for an instant very different from her typical dream-like state. “I suppose I’ll take that. But what’s this research question you have? I wasn’t aware appraisers at auction houses needed to publish like those in academia.”
“Alright,” Draco said. Was he agreeing because, against all his better judgement, Draco wanted to unravel the mystery of his father’s death? And truth be told, Draco was becoming exhausted by the numbing idleness of his current life. “Do I need to do anything to prepare or bring anything?”
“We’ll have officers there but we can’t make it as fast as you,” Shacklebolt said. “We’re monitoring your movements now and it appears you have a tail.”
He tapped his fingers on the plush velvet, rearranging the sheafs of papers once more. Harry had gone to work after helping him settle back into Grimmauld Place. Neither of them talked about what had happened last night, though they greeted each other with an ease that set Draco’s heart floating when they woke up legs tangled with each other’s.
Ron gave a sigh. “What do you need help with? I admit that we make wands equipped with the type of modules that you see in the schematic, but we haven’t provided anyone with those in over a year.”
And Harry was fit – their sex was great. It more than made up for him leaving his socks all over the flat. Even now, it took all of Draco’s willpower to keep his hands off Harry: Draco loved running his fingers through Harry’s messy hair – tousled, Harry would insist – and pressing against the firm chest, the strong arms.
Blaise noticed my gaze, raised an eyebrow in a knowing gesture. They’d been seeing each other on-and-off since our Hogwarts days. It was only a matter of time before they ended up married with a few brats along the way, I reckoned.
“You’re welcome to my father’s papers,” Draco said finally. “I can’t make heads or tails of it, but I’m assuming you, with your superior resources, can. If you’re here to ask for them, then I’ll gladly show you the way to the study.” He hoped this would finally put to rest the last embers of Lucius’s misdeeds.
Thankfully, they had the advantage of defending in a narrow passageway. Like Thermopylae, the constricted hall gave Harry and Draco a clear vantage point to plug the hole as it were, and push back the attackers.
He took a deep breath. He was feeling the strain himself. He could have Hedwig release some nano-cells to wake himself up, but it always left him hazy and disoriented after the effect wore off.
Then Harry was naked in front of Draco. The fact that Draco could only see outlines in the darkened room added to his desire. He moved in, his breath hot and wet, to engulf the swell of Harry’s cock.
“It’s ancient history now,” Shacklebolt said, staring at the holo-projection. “Or it feels like it. In any case, young Malfoy had nothing to do with Riddle’s coup. I believe he was under car at St. Mungo’s hospital at the time, undergoing treatment for the injuries he sustained when he was kidnapped as a child.”
The librarian glared at me. It was different from his usual. Those had been blunted and common; this was sharp, like a stiletto point pressing on my jugular. I recognized that sensation I had experienced earlier now – it was fear.
Draco nodded. “Yes. But in 334 BC, Alexander the Great visited the site of Troy and paid homage to the tombs of Achilles and Patroclus with his lover Hephaestion. Alexander was a great admirer of Achilles, and incidentally claimed descent from the Homeric hero. It’s believed that he found the Shield there, and that was partly the reason for Alexander’s remarkable military success.”
“Do you have any other details?” she peered at me. “I mean … a man with a cloak who doesn’t like you … that doesn’t quite narrow it down.” She gave me a lopsided grin. “You know you have a way with people.”
Tension that had been keeping me upright broke and I almost collapsed. Potter grabbed my arm just in time.
This chapter was over. Finally over. Draco collapsed against the pleather seat of the Land Rover. It was surprisingly comfortable. Either that, or the contrast from the rock wall of his former prison too deeply impressed upon him.
I hissed in anger. And fear. Whoever had done this managed to break the wards I had set. The spells I casted were sturdy enough to cause trouble for anyone but a powerful wizard. In theory. I never had anyone test their durability before.
“That wasn’t my proudest moment.” I really drank too much, if I were sitting here apologizing to Potter and having a heart-to-heart. “But you? No friends? The Chosen Savior? I don’t believe that.”
“Well, the inscription is definitely Koine, which spread across the Mediterranean through Alexander the Great’s conquest, and it says, ‘made to the order of Aristotle, tutor to the King of Macedon.’ So there’s no doubt that this is the object we’re looking for. The object itself is made from bronze,” Draco held it up to the sun, “gold, and this mineral looks like silver, but –”
“This was your bright idea?” Theo shouted at Draco from behind a wooden bench. “You’re wrecking my ship!”
“I’m sorry,” Harry repeated. “What I just aid earlier, I just panicked for a moment. I don’t doubt your competence or your good intention.”
I did. And keeping my distance to Potter obviously was an ineffective tactic. Potter was right: we couldn’t go on denying our attraction to each other. And his other point, that we weren’t making any commitment to each other, both stung and appealed to me. Sleeping with Potter did not preclude my new resolution to be a better Malfoy heir. And I so sorely wanted to.
“Pettigrew and Dolohov?” That was Malfoy. He still sounded dazed, but the sharpness that he had displayed earlier was back.
“I trust your conjectures,” Harry said. “They’ve saved my life more than once.” The pit of unease ever since Harry had seen the body turned into a churn. “All of the Unspeakables who worked on this … dead. Do you know why?”
“Right.” The edge of panic faded. Harry spoke in rapid bursts of words. “Call Kingsley. We need backup. I’m going to get out of here, into traffic and then to somewhere safe. Can you handle that?”
“Let’s just say I have seen material which makes me a convert to the belief of its existence,” Draco said. He drummed his fingers on the table. “Why do people want it so badly? Beyond the obvious historical value. It can’t really have mystical powers, can it?”
Potter’s frown deepened. “Are they giving you a difficult time? Tell Hermione; she’ll sort them out. And do you know why you were attacked? Was it because you were a Dea – your past?”
Malfoy made a little noise. Then he broke into a reluctant smile. “Alright. It’s been two decades, and I might as well tell another living being. But Potter, it’s a gory tale and I hope you’re ready for it.”
“Protecting the innocent?” Granger looked at him. “You can always come back, you know. There’s always going to be a place for you.”
I breathed in. Fairy lights fluttered, washing the garden with a soft glow. Here, flowers that were out of season still bloomed, kept so by magic and scrupulous attention. Elaborate topiaries of mythical creatures towered over the manicured hedges. Stone benches were unobtrusively placed around the garden.
Harry avoided a sleek racer with a move that left it spinning in midair for a second. He passed by the driver’s angry face and suppressed a grin. That man had been pushing at the edge of safe driving anyways. Served him right to be taught a lesson.
His work kept him busy. It left him on constant travel and Draco didn’t have much time to spare for a cup of tea, much less lead the leisured life of a country squire. It was what he told himself, and it was all true.
None came. I dared not breathe, body locked in tight suspense. Could he have followed me? The man certainly knew more than enough, but this building was discreet, and an unexpected choice for a wizard.
“It’s hard to have your sangfroid when I’m out on the street actually doing my job,” Harry said sharply.
“I reckon that there’s a way to match the gears.” Draco squinted. “It’s in remarkable condition, considering it’s been under the ocean for thousands of years, but the inscription is too faded for me to make out except the biggest ones.”
Maybe they would assign someone to guard me until the threat’s passed. Maybe it would even be Potter.
The librarian recovered first. He drew his wand, waving it in a figure eight movement as he opened his mouth –
I waved off her concern with a confidence I wasn’t sure I felt. “I’ll be fine. I can take care of myself. I’ve been practicing my dueling.”
Harry scowled. But he pushed his way through to the bar, taking out his wallet and hailing the bartender –
“My past is rather boring,” Draco said. “Public school boy with daddy issues and, well…” he gave Harry a once over, “a complicated relationship with an impossibly handsome man who infuriate the hell out of me. But someone that I can’t live without.”
There must be someone maintaining all of this, Harry thought, trying not to trip over his feet. The entrance had sounded loud to Harry’s ears, but it worked seamlessly, and its decibel wouldn’t have registered to the cams that monitored this place. Harry wondered who it was. While not terribly sophisticated, it still suggested a technical proficiency beyond what a campout of vagrants could afford to muster.
His hovercar pulled up to a tower in west London that soared far higher than the vehicle could reach. At a glance, Harry could see that rent here was just as astronomical, even if Harry sold all his belongings and cashed in his pension.
Cross reacted, his wand slashing out at me before I could blink. A red heat caught on my chest, even as I hurriedly shielded myself.
“I suppose not. Those kinds of problems are far too pedestrian for me. Any third-rate hack can do that. Anyways, what’s this problem you have for me then?”
I was still last evening’s robes, having fallen asleep in them. They smelled rank. I wrinkled my nose. It was more than just my robes; I smelled rank.
“Well, typically you use a counterspell or you overpower it with your own magic. Those are the two ways most wizards use.”
“Went to meet with new investors today,” Lucius had written. “Wanted large sums transferred from Jersey account to Prof. Rosier for services rendered. Prof Rosier wanted money immediately, told him that might take several days to clear, given nature of transaction. Had to pay out of own pockets” – here Draco pictured his father’s scowl – “and retained copy of analysis as proof. Could not make heads or tails of it, but it relates to investors’ new project.”
I was also terrified at what would await me when I did open it. Not so much because it might threaten bodily injury, but because of its contents. All this power in my hands … I was curious to lay my eyes on it. It tempted me; I remembered that flash of covetousness when I saw the blue flames – I wanted that power for myself.
Potter touched my shoulder. It was a gentle gesture, and yet I felt in it all the strength he could convey to me. I stopped myself from instinctively leaning into it. I had to be strong. And yet, every gesture and every word peeled back the layers of my attraction to Potter from merely being physical to something more visceral.
“He’ll probably hand it over to Riddle at the earliest opportunity,” Shacklebolt said. “It’s likely they’ll come after Draco again too. Here’s what we need to do: I’ll have the analysts track down Dolohov and Riddle’s whereabouts. In the meantime, Harry, stay close to Draco and protect him.”
He probably thought he could fend them off better than me. He might even be right; though Potter attempted to train me, I was hopeless. No instinct for counter spells and slow responses hindered my progress.
He looked at Harry. Harry sat with his eyes closed. Draco envied Harry’s state of meditative calm. How Harry managed that, Draco didn’t know.
The bar was in an uproar. Fists flew his way. Harry’s combat mode flicked on. He dodged them, returning with his own, well-aimed blows.
“I think I have a very different impression of this place,” Potter said neutrally, “but I’m sorry that your memories of your home has been – well, ruined.”
Harry directed a level gaze at Draco. “For work. Kingsley comes here often. It’s close enough to walk and it isn’t somewhere that stands out. Not a very see-and-be-seen place.”
There was a mass of algae that registered on the camera screen like clump of black. Draco squinted. This might be it. It was about the same size and shape, though it was obviously difficult to tell.
“I’m not Slytherin’s heir,” I replied. “The Heir of Slytherin is dead. Died not very pleasantly too, I’m afraid.”
Then the flames were gone. Darkness suddenly took over the cave again to eyes used to blinding blue, and the unexpected disappearance of the heat made me shiver. But the way was clear.
As before, I tapped my wand to my fingertip. A cut opened, and a droplet of blood welled. By instinct, I lifted my finger, presenting it to the stone chamber. As I watched, the white glow changed to that unearthly green I had come to associate with the Grimoire. It was strange, how I used to be so fond of it as my House colors, I thought.
She turned back to Potter, satisfied now that my father hadn’t said anything offensive that might have run me off.
“You’re headed into a trap,” Draco shouted over the man. “They know you’re coming, and they’ve stationed lookouts the entire way. You need to get out of here at once!”
Harry somehow managed to steady and unsettle me at the same time. Just his proximity was enough to set my stomach cartwheeling. And yet, when he was near me, I found myself not worrying about others’ opinions, about all the mistakes I had made haunting me in some way.
“I don’t,” Potter said. “But there are some things that I had to learn out of necessity.” I waited for him to elaborate.
“They were my parents, Draco,” Harry said with a touch of amusement. “I think I know if taking you to see them is appropriate or not.”
“With what? A fork? You need to use shampoo and conditioner when you wash it too. Otherwise it’s going to stick out like that.”
I turned to face Harry. His eyes were wide and clear, with an earnestness that prompted me to forget everything.
Had he made a mistake? It was possible, given the circumstances Draco had worked under. The Shield was quiescent now in his hands, nothing out of the ordinary. It was simply a very old antique.
“Don’t blame yourself too much, mate,” the man from Yorkshire said. “You did some of the quickest spellwork I’d ever seen, mate. You should’ve seen him, ma’am – it was impressive, the way he just cast spell after spell like bam! And then he did this weird thing with his palm and blood and there was a light and –”
“Saw the news about the Prof. Shaken. Might be fanciful but have decided to hide the analysis from him in safe place.”
I woke up earlier than usual the next day, feeling a pleasant sort of laziness. I moved leisurely; there were no impending deadlines, no urgent need for me to be in a rush.
“You told me I could come by whenever to inspect your place,” he said, setting down my mug and reaching up the shelf for another one. He wrinkled his nose. That sight should not have looked so attractive. “Merlin, you smell horrible. Did you douse a bottle of whisky on you or something?”
Harry managed to return to Grimmauld Place without any further interruptions. It was an older flat, in a less than reputable part of London, but at least it was in the City and comfortable enough for a single man.
It was the restaurant where they had their first date in England. It was busy; a small queue wound its way around the lamppost, and the interior was filled with patrons, the staff milling around them like bees around flowers.
“Hmm … well, without more details, I’m afraid we can’t do anything. Maybe our squad on the scene can turn up more details, but I’m afraid the only thing I can offer is a pamphlet on magical self-defense.”
“There’s actually an entire hoard of treasure down there,” Draco said, laughing at Theo’s crestfallen face. “I’ll give you the exact location later. And the pictures of it. I want my name on the discovery, but you’ll get the salvage rights and the rewards associated with it.”
It hit harder and with more speed than a bullet. “My father – he was killed by them because he knew too much.” Draco met Harry’s gaze straight on. “He found out something about whatever they’re planning right now and was silenced because he was going to talk, wasn’t he?”
Theo gave Draco a sour look. “Who do you think I am? Besides, dealing in underground antiquities these days is not the payoff it once was. The trade’s been taken over by organized criminals. They’ll stiff you faster than any government. And at least you can challenge the governments in court.”
Granger nodded. “Yes. We had reports of a fire at Malfoy Manor. Thankfully, most of it was contained by the house-elves within an hour of discovery, though I believe the study and a large part of that wing would need repairs before it was habitable again.”
“You’re not in financial distress,” Potter said mildly, though I could swear a smile played in the corner of his mouth. “What you’re wearing probably could pay my rent for a week. And who actually uses the word ‘pecuniary’ in conversation?”
My hand was met with a terrible burning that threatened to sear off my flesh. And yet I could not let go. I did not want to.
“Oh…. Alright.” Draco wasn’t particularly enthused by the idea of walking so much, though he supposed it was better than taking the stairs all the way up.
“You are an officious irritation,” Draco snapped. “And no, I’m not going to reveal any mention of this meeting – my academic and social reputation hang by a thread as they are.” He gave an internal shudder at the idea of the Daily Sun catching wind that Draco Malfoy, hated scion of a crime family – never mind that the Malfoys were ten generations of proper English gentry – bandying fanciful theories to MI6.
Instead, Shacklebolt took out a small polaroid. It was of the car that had fled the estate this afternoon; Draco recognized the grainy visage as the men self-identified as Dolohov and Wormtail.
I hit the hardwood floor of my flat. Picking myself up with a grimace – my entire body screamed at me – I checked quickly if the stranger had followed me. I held my wand up, ready for an imminent attack.
Draco blinked at Harry with sleepy eyes. “Then what is it? What’s the matter? Is this something that can’t wait?”
“Thought you were overdue for a vacation. And with Harry too,” Blaise had said, winking naughtily at Draco. “I always knew you had a crush on him back in school. It’s good to see that you’re together again.”
The Weasley gave a delicate cough. “Erm … Malfoy, can you put on your pants? I can see – well, sometimes things are better left to the imagination.”
Potter’s reluctant smile grew a centimeter bigger. “I guess this will be a test of how well I taught you how to duel.”
“I have pictures of the men who died after visiting here,” Harry said. “I was going to start by asking around if anyone had seen them, or know of anyone who had.”
“I’ll include you and the school’s assistance in my acknowledgements,” I said, giving McGonagall one of my winning smiles. “If I find anything of note.” If I survived this. “You can be sure of that.”
“Don’t be in such a hurry,” he laughed. He clambered over me; my hands reached up past his shirt, tweaked his nipples. “Can – can you do that again?”
“You, of my blood, thinned as it is, should not look away. This is your both your birthright as well as your future.”
Harry stripped with fumbling motions as I did the same with my trousers. I ignored the loss of physical contact that announced itself like a blast of cold, as the sight of Harry naked hit me with the force of bricks.
“Tomorrow might be dangerous,” Harry said and his voice was low. Wistful, even. “Can we just, for a second, pretend like nothing’s wrong?”
Thankfully it was just the two of us in the hallway, this being a busy day and most still tied to their desks. I cringed to imagine how others react if they happened upon a former Death Eater with his wand raised at the Deputy Head of Magical Law Enforcement.
“We’re the ones stopping them!” Ron glared at Malfoy. “Don’t pretend like you don’t know that the Death Eaters are the ones extending their power in the Ministry by bribery and intimidation and forcing these unjust laws through. You can’t deny it. I know who you are. Your father –”
“Would you listen to me if I told you that?” countered Draco. “Besides, I never listened to you when you tell me to stay out of things.”
“It’s quite full in there,” Draco said, not wishing for conversation to stray beyond the practical. Even so, a lump lodged in his throat. “We’re going to have to wait half an hour by the looks of it.”
I couldn’t stop as we continued to kiss, my hand reaching out to pull him in closer. He weighed comfortably on top of me, one leg on mine, as our arms intertwined.
“We’re just friends,” I said, as we turned the corner leading to the Small Room. This passage had never felt so interminable as it had right now. “We tried dating, but we don’t work well together.”
Harry shook his head. He was being overly fanciful, and he needed to keep all his wits about him if he wanted this night to be a success. His team kept a watch on the entire city, and the SI analysts kept up a constant stream of projections where the drug runners would be. Every sign pointed to his section being where they would most likely be.
“You laugh,” I said darkly. “But I can tell you stories of houses where stairwells cracked and walls shattered, all because the owners slammed the door too hard. These old houses – better not to offend them.”
I looked up at Harry, his body on top of me, pressing me down as to protect me from the explosion. I kissed him, hard and fierce.
“There’s no point in resistance,” said a blast of frigid air. “You’re surrounded by my men. I hope you’re not so foolhardy as to risk your life and that of Mr. Malfoy in demonstrations of futility.”
“This place … it was once my home,” he said. I could almost detect a note of wistfulness in his tone. “But I am driven from it for my love of it. Such is the world we live in.”
Just in case, I casted extra wards and protection spells, feeling the slight electric across my skin as they slid in place.
On the day we were set to visit the Manor, I dressed with care. I sent two letters to my parents, one to my father and one to mother. I neglected to mention Potter was accompanying me in the copy my father received, my reasoning being that my father would be more receptive to the news from Mother.
Bellatrix nodded. “Yes, my lord. Dolohov believes he has the papers regarding the Shield which disappeared around the time Lucius defected.”
You don’t need to go this fast, Hedwig said in Harry’s ears. You can cut back forty percent and still catch up to the suspects. Not to mention you’re breaking the speed limit.
“You’re right, it doesn’t sound exciting,” Potter said. “But you must have a reason for why you came to me. So what is it?”
“I know what a laptop is,” I said quickly. “Some of the Muggleborn scholars use them. It’s nifty, though I don’t think I’ll ever be able to figure one it.” And I wondered at myself – the younger me would never have deigned to even look at a Muggleborn, let alone listen to one explain how a computer worked.
We had all grown up. Harry had grown up, too. No longer as brash as I remembered, though still very much impulsive. Afterall, he leapt in front of me to take the hit from an unknown curse.
His assistant waved me up, giving me a curious once-over. I ignored it. He was familiar, and I recalled his face as one I had seen before in Hogwarts. He was probably one of Potter’s Gryffindor lackeys, following him like a puppy.
I nodded. We sat facing her at the enormous claw-foot desk, the portrait of Dumbledore snoring behind McGonagall, though occasionally I thought I caught a wink from him. Next to it, in a place of similar prominence, was Snape. Unlike the other portraits, he was not – or did not pretend to be – asleep, eyeing us with hawk-like eyes as he listened in on our conversation.
He needed to get out of here. Never mind that Goyle, that scum, had already vanished, but Harry had to fight his way out of the Leaky Cauldron first. Man for man, he was more than a match with his training and enhanced body, but he’d tire, and the number of his opponents were against him.
“I can understand about your families not approving.” Rosa gave a commiserating nod. “My parents weren’t exactly happy when I introduced them to my partner.”
I wondered how it had slipped into my tote bag in the first place. It certainly was not there this morning when I packed.
“I’m sorry,” I said quietly. It felt like I was apologizing for more than my faux pas. I was apologizing more my past, for the actions of my family, for the damage of those I had once counted as friends and comrades ….
“Yes, I know,” I said with a touch of impatience. Desire spiked at his touch and it made me tetchy. “You’re highly in demand.”
The iron-wrought gate opened at my touch. A peacock turned its head at us before returning to back to its strut. The hedges which used to be so familiar now towered over us, as we walked in its sinister shadow it left.
Founders’ Heirlooms were steeped in mythology and lore, but the Hogwarts Founders were real people, and it stood to reason that the objects they owned were real, too. The Sorting Hat was example of one – and didn’t Saint Potter find more? We all knew the stories of how the Dark Lord turned them into his Horcruxes.
Potter came over. He yawned and stretched his arms. I looked away quickly as his movement exposed a stretch of tawny abdomen. “Time for lunch?”
Harry grabbed Goyle’s arm. “I have what we came for. I need to get back to HQ and discuss this with Shacklebolt.”
“Are you all right?” Harry asked. He even sounded concerned. “I know it’s not a very pleasant flight, but we are on a tight schedule and don’t have any time to lose. If you’re feeling tired or jetlagged, the best I can do is some aspirin and coffee.”
Harry bowed and left. He supposed he was free to return home and sleep. By the looks of it, he might be able to get one or two hours still.
I had not envisioned I would be standing here in the chilly afternoon baring my soul to Granger of all people. I forced a wan smile. “Don’t worry about it. Let me know when you track him down.”
Unbidden, a pair of grey eyes swam into Harry’s mind, paired with that faint, sardonic smile that was both infuriating and challenging. Harry wondered how it would feel under his lips.
“How may I help you, Mr. Malfoy?” he asked, after they were seated and the aperitifs poured. “I understand you’re looking to procure a very specific piece.”
“Rosier did indeed possess the necessary expertise, but he was much too close to the truth of our actual plans,” Riddle said. “He was also beginning to cost more than he was worth. And who knew if he and Lucius had planned their little shenanigans together? It was better to be safe than suffer traitors. You do understand, don’t you, Wormtail?”
Harry glowered at Tom the Bartender. “You knew what Blaise was going to do and you didn’t stop him?”
Draco cordoned off those emotions, focusing on the lady now laying out her pack of Tarot with professional precision.
Which was why they were not going to Athens right now, but to a small island in the middle of the Aegean, where Rosier had postulated the currents had taken the shipwreck.
It warred with the unpleasant bile that rose whenever I set my eyes on the tatter remnants of my flat. Damn pride and fear – I couldn’t handle this alone. A piece of what had been my kettle rolled towards my feet.
I gave her a malevolent look. “Don’t be facetious. Those were expensive. Some were on loan.” Thank Merlin they only suffered cosmetic damage. “I have news to share.”
“Yes,” Slytherin said, his voice in a whisper as he turned to look upon the castle, what must be the culmination of his life’s work. “But hopefully, I give to you the seeds with which the injustice can be rectified.”
“You’re a fucking idiot,” Harry said as he stand over Bellatrix. He looked at Draco with concern. “Are you alright?”
Potter eyed me with concern, his expression like what I imagined of a mother hen watching her chicks. “Yes? Are you alright? I’m sorry that my story upset you so much, but—”
I estimate that if you shower in under a minute, you should be able to get two hours worth of sleep in, Hedwig told him. I will formulate and compile the report that you promised McLaggen.
I shrugged off my waxed field jacket and my Slytherin House scarf. Despite the clear day, it was still autumn, with the attendant biting weather. I would have preferred a cloak, but wandering through Muggle London, it would have looked odd. And the streets were dirty; I didn’t want it dragging through.
I missed being a student here. Even my last year here, when it seemed that hell itself came to earth, this school provided me with a modicum of stability and safety that I craved. I could not bear staying in the Manor when the Dark Lord took residence.
“We do have some lovely Muggle neighbors,” she said. “Old Mrs. Maple just had her third grandson. She’s a fat bouncing baby. Very adorable.” She gave a melodramatic sigh. “I wonder if I’ll even have one of my own in my lifetime.”
“I cleaned up before I came,” I confessed. “It was making me … uncomfortable.” Sick was more accurate, but I didn’t want Potter’s pity. It came anyways.
Harry suddenly smiled. “I sound like an arse, don’t I? I haven’t even thanked you for helping us get out of there.”
Riddle nodded, stopping Dolohov and Bellatrix from objecting. Wormtail’s brow was furrowed, like he was unable to fathom such a request at this particular time. And indeed, Draco was surprised at himself for having demanded it.
What would have Harry done? He didn’t know. Thoughts of that gorgeous man – Blaise – had all but been banished when Malfoy was in front of him. Harry wetted his lips. “I don’t know.”
Portraits of past Ministries luminaries stared at me, some with a mere glance before returning to posing, others with a much more intent curiosity. I could ask Professor Snape for advice. Even in portrait form, he still had valuable insight to offer. Being the former Head of Slytherin, it was possible he knew more. Being oil and canvas had not improved his disposition, I remembered, from the last visit I paid him.
She laughed at that. “I think you’ve had more than enough to drink, Draco.” She checked the large and smudged grandfather clock next to the fireplace. “I need to head home soon. Ron’ll be back from his business trip in America.”
Cocky, too. An attribute Harry would have scarcely thought apt for a computer, but Sentient Intelligence programs had both the self-aware of a living being and immense calculating speed that dwarfed a human’s.
I looked around warily. There was no sign of the blue flames. I knew that meant little; they could still burst out in any minute. If we took the wrong step ….
Harry wasn’t sure who, though the Ministry nowadays resembled not so much a sieve as a broken roof. Half the employees were on the take, or at least had uncomfortably close relationships with the criminals in this city. It was understandable, but Harry didn’t like the idea of someone he worked with being untrustworthy.
“Why should I trust you?” spat Fletcher. “You lured me under false pretenses, you bast – ow!” Harry had raised his arm warningly.
“I’m glad you’re alright,” Draco said, taking a deep inhale. “We should probably go before more of them come.”
The wise man knew when to retreat. Draco and Harry left with alacrity, out under the baleful gaze of a glowering Fletcher.
Like clockwork, her team sprang into action, each taking up their positions – two besides the entrance, one behind Granger as she kicked in the door with a resounding crash. She made a gesture. They swarmed in, wands at the ready, looking for any signs of trouble.
Blaise nodded, getting off me. I padded after him, giving my living room a quick scrutiny. It needed cleaning; our activity on the couch had knocked some cushions onto the floor. My coffee table was still a mess, the cup from earlier and my tote bag heaped on it. The magic book was there too, one among many.
It wasn’t a stretch of the imagination for Draco to believe his father was involved in illegal activity, but he always pictured those being harmless crimes, like tax evasion or maybe a little embezzlement. The charges Mr. Weasley named were serious, and what was worse, Mr. Weasley’s tone expressed a surprised sympathy that forced Draco to realize what Mr. Weasley said was true.
Draco gave Shacklebolt a dubious look. He worried for Britain if all the men responsible for national security were like these two. “An expertise in archaeology doesn’t make me the best man for the job. I work at Christie’s, for God’s sake. I’m used to temperature-controlled labs and prissy curators, not bombs and criminals.”
“I’ll send Kreacher to the Manor,” Potter said. “He can organize the elves to put out the fire. And I’ll contact Hermione as soon as I’m sure you’re alright.”
Harry wanted to pursue this intriguing avenue of inquiry when Fudge, seemingly recovered, intervened.
“Ah....” Theo didn’t make it this far in the business by being overly nosy. He and Draco were old acquaintances, friends even, but there was a limit which Theo observed. “Well, you have all the equipment you requested ready on the boat. I trust you’ve done this before?”
“Persuasion is sometimes more effective than magical coercion,” Potter said sagely. “It’s more foolproof and there’s a power in having someone join you willingly instead of forcing them through physical or magical means.”
“Hello,” I said politely. “You came just in time. I would like to request,” I looked down at my notes, “Manuscripts 102A and 15C, please.”
“Thanks for coming with me,” Harry said as we returned to the inn. The door was unlocked, though both the innkeeper and his daughter were nowhere to be seen at the front desk. I shook my head at their lack of proper security. Even in a small town, they should have much better sense.
Draco almost rolled his eyes. “Yes. Well, I’m not a big expert in sneaking into places. I never had to; after all, I’m more used to people opening the door for me. Are you sure we can’t simply scale the building instead of sneaking in disguised as janitors?”
“Not if I have to.” Malfoy tapped a button. “I was looking through the facts of what happened again, and I managed to have Metis scour the recordings from the Underground.” He considered. “Well, what little we got from the surrounding cameras. They’re not as extensive as the ones you lot have, and a lot lower quality, but workable still.”
Draco jerked up from his plate in surprise. “He’s fine. He’s his usual self.” Mr. Weasley never spoke to Draco directly before. Unlike the others, he treated Draco with an awkward distance that bordered on courtesy. He seemed more uncomfortable than anything else with Draco’s presence.
“I used your existing account and clearance as well as my own intimate knowledge of the database structure to find gaps in the Auror protections,” Hedwig said. She sounded rather miffed. “On the other hand, I do not have any preexisting knowledge of this console’s system, except its defenses are much more sophisticated than the average.”
It was an awful thought and stirred in Harry pity. Malfoy, now that Harry looked closer, did display signs of illness which elegant clothes and a cool demeanor had previously covered. “Your own father … he made you go through that operation as a child to plant those biomechanical enhancements?”
Draco saw with a glance that these men worked for the government. And not the usual bureaucrats, either; these two had an air of efficiency and hardness. Draco searched their faces: they betrayed nothing.
“Your behavior is atrocious.” Malfoy sighed. “But I suppose I can’t blame you. Plenty of people fall for this type of boorish behavior, it seems.” He appraised Harry with a curious look. “You seemed receptive to Blaise’s advances back at the Leaky.”
“I don’t take orders from you,” Greyback said, dragging a sharp nail gently down Draco’s cheek. “Even from someone the master wants unharmed.”
“Yes, we get it. You know your protection spells,” I interrupted. Harry mock-glared at me. “But how do we get past it?”
Did something happen, Draco wondered? A momentary spasm constricted his throat. He knew that Riddle kept a close watch on him. The hot burn of shame and frustration at losing the shield was like bile.
“Yes.” Draco clenched his glass. It was no act. The anger still smoldered. “Why bother with being a good person when every one expects you to fall in the end?”
“No, it’s alright,” Harry said. “I can wait outside. Draco here,” he gave Draco a wink, “can go first.”
The night blurred. I ate and drank too much, my head pleasantly light, my stomach comfortably full. Our decibels rose ever higher as more alcohol was consumed. Goyle touched Millicent’s arm as they laughed over something she said, their heads huddled together in a mimicry of a lover’s intimacy.
If McLaggen was a wiser man, then he probably wouldn’t be in this line of work in the first place, Harry thought wryly. There were plenty of sinecures in the Ministry that a man with McLaggen’s connections could obtain. However, Deputy Head of the Aurors wasn’t one of those.
Draco read rapidly: “Draco, if you’re reading this, then it means I am dead and that you have discovered what I have been involved in for the last years of my life. I had not told you about the location of the hideout, though it has been a Malfoy secret passed from father to son generation after generation. If you are reading this, I had rather vainly hoped to keep this from you so that you would have the chance to live a normal life without the complications I have brought upon myself. Here, next to this note, are the papers from one Professor Rosier analyzing the findings of an archaeological artifact that the people I have been working with coveted.
“I’m right here,” I said, cutting off Granger’s response. I was touched – and more than a little irritated – at Potter’s protectiveness. The irritation won out. “And I think you forget who I am. I’m not just some squishy academic; I’ve practical experience in the Dark Arts too.” Both Potter and Granger flushed at that.
“Is that the case with you?” Draco asked. Do you appreciate me, after leaving me for the deserts and the bombs?
“Nah,” he said. “Most of those bastards went to the front, and Hermione and I were more than able to deal with the ones who came from the back.”
“Well....” It was my turn to shift uncomfortably. “He was really never that fond of you, even when you were a child.”  That was the understatement of the decade.
Potter’s body was long and lean, even wrapped up under that tent of robes. I longed to press myself against that broad chest, wrap my legs around his waist – my hand quickened its pace – as he mouthed my neck, his hands roaming and kneading with callused roughness.
Hm. I pursed my lips. “Well, I guess then we could use a spell or something to break the protective magic that’s encasing the memory.” I gestured towards the books. “Time to hit the books again.”
There was a delicate cough from Malfoy. “In that case, I suppose I won’t escort you out,” he said. There was an expression in his eyes that Harry might have thought was disappointment.
I breathed a sigh of relief as nothing happened. Yet even my body relaxed, I was disappointed by the lack of further action. It was … anticlimactic.
Draco didn’t intend to let anything happen to Theo, aggravating as he was at times. “The ocean is unpredictable,” Draco told Bellatrix. “And these waters aren’t exactly undisturbed. The Decoder can get stuck to the bottom of a haul, or caught in a fishing net too. And you can’t carry out that massive diving action without catching notice. Do you really think the Greek coast guard or the media won’t find out? You can bribe a few of them, but not the entire fleet.”
He sank back into the seat, his consciousness flowing like the sand from an hourglass … he was tired, and he leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, allowing the movement of the car to lull him ….
“What’s going on?” Harry’s voice was loud in his ears. It still came muffled through the buzzing as Draco was plunged into frozen fear –
I sat, waiting in a brightly lit antechamber, looking impatiently at Potter’s closed door. I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection.
“Methinks the lady doth protest too much.” Now Potter definitely smirked. “Look, can we cut the bullshit?”
Harry eyed those with an expression one usually reserved for trips to the dentist. “Better you than me.”
“No!” Harry said hotly. “I haven’t!” He turned imploringly to Draco. “Don’t listen to him. Don’t give them what they want. You’ve seen for yourself what these people are. Think of your father… think of all their victims.”
Draco had no idea what the depth of his father’s participation was. Nor did he cared to find out. The body was buried, and Lucius’ secrets with it. Draco did not want to exhume all that.
The air fell still and heavy in the mausoleum. Generations of Malfoys were buried here: from Nicholas Malfoy, who made a fortune, it was whispered, from highway banditry and cattle-thieving, to his grandfather Abraxas, who barely escaped prosecution from war profiteering during the Second World War.
“That’s all?” Finnegan frowned. “Usually there’s more information. Useless information, but still, more than this.”
