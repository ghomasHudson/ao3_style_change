Never mind.
Sure enough, by the time pub night rolled around, it was as if nothing had changed. Draco tried to act the same, but it was hard. How could he act like everything was the same when he didn’t even feel like the same person? He wondered if anyone else knew what Potter had gone through as a child. Did they know it had never truly left him?
Potter frowned, seeming unwilling to speak and break the strange spell that had descended over them. “So, this is some kind of fairy entrapment curse? It pulls the fairy inside and then makes sure they can’t escape?”
“Yeah, pretty much.”
Draco’s mind was already turning over figures, running analysis against existing budgets that he’d worked on during the last financial year. He could make this work. If he put enough effort in, accounting for potential investments from potioneers and businesses that traded in security and illusions, he was fairly certain he could even make it turn a profit.
Potter’s brows flickered into a half-frown, just for a second, but then understanding dawned on his face.
“They discovered these at
Draco stared at the letter for a long, long time. The string bag of vegetables on his arm grew heavy, and he dropped it to the ground before sinking slowly down beside it. Potter had done it. He’d really done it.
“You didn’t,” Draco protested with a laugh, letting his forehead rest against Harry’s.
“Which one’s yours?” he asked, nodding his head to the crowd that were now standing in a line and practicing the ‘up’ command.
Draco groaned, burying in closer like he was trying to ignore him, but Harry could tell he was listening closely.
“The anchor keeps us linked to ourselves and to the curse,” Potter added quietly. “The only times the spell ever went wrong were when the person controlling the anchor let themselves get pulled too far one way. You don’t want to end up with someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, or who panics at the last second and tries to anchor you back to yourself when you’re still tied to the curse.”
“There you two are,” Hermione said, stifling a yawn. “We were just about to head to the Floos.”
“Fuck,” Harry splutters.
The biting edge had returned to his voice, thank Merlin, and Potter seemed to notice it too. He climbed slowly to his feet. “New plan,” he said lightly, although there was a hardness to his jaw that Draco didn’t want to examine too closely, lest it reveal more than he wanted about the man he was indefinitely locked up with. “We work on this together. Let’s start from the beginning—do you have any texts I can read?”
“Bring George out of the—” Draco repeated weakly, before he shook his head and just decided to go with it.
Beside him, Potter was leaning back on his hands and twirling the pendant around in circles. It was maddening.
Draco froze and tried to look like he very obviously wasn’t listening, which he very obviously was. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter emerge from the back room and come to stand in front of him on the other side of the counter. He pasted a politely curious expression on his face and looked up. It nearly fell off his face in dismay when he realised that Potter—the
Harry’s heart is hammering in his throat, but Draco just sounds tired. It’s impossible to imagine, but in this strange new land full of dingos and durries, Harry finds the leap isn’t quite as far as he always thought. He drops his gaze to Draco’s lips, to the thin line of pink and the nervous tongue that darts across it. Draco’s breath visibly hitches, and Harry can’t help but notice.
“Look what Mummy bought me!” Rose held up the giant book she was holding, waving it as close as she could get to Morgan’s face. “Will you read it to me?”
An ache long forgotten started up in Draco’s chest. “Well, congratulations on changing the future, Potter, but it’s not like you can change the past.”
wants you to. Hang back as long as you can, at least until you know more.”
But he said none of that, and simply climbed to his feet with increasing tiredness.
His eyes fell on Potter and Draco, and they shared a grim look which removed all doubt from Draco’s mind that George wasn’t aware of the seriousness of the situation, even if he didn’t know the details.
Hermione blinked rapidly, taking it in, while Ron’s gaze darted between the two of them repeatedly.
“Not yet,” Draco insisted, and began to unbutton Harry’s shirt.
Hermione looked like she was bursting to ask a million questions, but for once, she seemed to contain herself.
It wouldn’t. It rose and rose, to the point he almost couldn't feel it; he could only hear it.
The Veela did not answer. With a sound like sand trickling over glass, it disappeared.
He looked down at his hands, and found only skin. No claws, no feathers.
Draco caught his eyes. “Exactly.”
For a moment, it felt like they were floating. The world around them was full of shadows, and Draco realised with a sudden rush of euphoria that he was looking straight out into the Ether. Glittering dully in the dim light, broken gears floated upward, some still ticking faintly around, searching for their partner.
Pansy raised her eyebrows in surprise but agreed, and the two of them left through the garden door and set off down the path to the orchard.
The moon had risen to its zenith, shining in through the open window and illuminating Harry’s living room far more than should be possible at two in the morning. Draco stood in one of the only shadows, just beside the doorway. Harry thought Draco might be watching him, but he couldn’t be sure—not because Draco’s face was hidden, but because Harry couldn’t bring himself to look.
“How often do you ever just sit still, Potter?” Malfoy’s voice was so quiet, Harry barely heard it.
Draco had thought Potter’s infuriating mood swings were something that only happened around him, like Potter was so conflicted by the need to be civil to Draco whilst simultaneously wanting to slam his face into a brick wall that it kept leaking out in fits of petulance. Now, he wasn’t so sure.
Draco blinked, trying to process what response would be required. “Why not try for three?” he asked faintly.
His eyes widen as he remembers Malfoy’s parting words, just before he left the Ministry that afternoon.
Hermione,
If anything could make me stay here, in England, it would be you. Merlin knows how or when that happened, but I know it to be true, just as much as I know our friendship would never happen. It’s been years since I last saw you in person, but the papers tell me enough. Is it strange that I feel happy for you? To see how much you’ve accomplished?
Potter grimaced, and something beneath the anger broke free. Suddenly, he looked so completely lost that Draco stopped and simply stared at him.
“Yes.” Draco panted, struggling to maintain any dignity at all and failing magnificently.
“Stop it,” Harry hissed. “You know what I mean.”
Harry had no idea what he was talking about, but the sheer exasperation in Malfoy’s tone—along with the faint but undeniable lack of vitriol—somehow made him smile, despite his best efforts.
“Patient zero.” Her voice lowered. “Another student witnessed the infection take effect, but when she returned with help, Miss Stanthrope had vanished.”
“Me?” Potter asked, incredulous. “You won’t even let me try to explain what I meant! I had one moment of weakness where I lashed out, which is hardly unusual for us, and—”
At first, he thought he’d tumbled from a pleasant dream into a nightmare until it came back to him. He scrambled for his glasses on the bedside table and blinked repeatedly until Malfoy’s face sharpened into view behind the lenses.
Am I an idiot if I go?
Harry frowned down at the vial as Draco dropped the last hair inside and corked it. “So, it doesn’t want to come in contact with your wand because the hair isn’t pure anymore?”
He always thought that love would feel like fireworks and sex. And it does, but it also feels like a tiny candle burning gently inside his chest, and the littlest things make it burn the brightest. It’s the sight of Draco resting on the couch in a bathrobe and warm socks; it’s the concentration on his brow as he reads one of his potions journals; and it’s the sound of his quiet movements in the kitchen as he prepares their breakfast. Harry never thought those things would be so important to him, and yet they’re the parts of his life he treasures the most.
Potter laughed. “Don’t be a twat. You never liked me at all, Malfoy.”
“What was that about?”
Draco sipped experimentally after a few minutes, and then nodded. “If you’re drugging me, Potter,” he muttered, pausing as he tried to think of an adequate punishment. Eventually he shook his head and finished, “poor show.”
“We’ll take him in now, Auror Potter.” One of the mediwizards looked up while the other transfigured a stretcher out of one of the pieces of foam in their pack. “Looks like a bad Stun at this point. There’s no indication of head trauma or other damage from what we can tell.”
Unless you were a stubborn old man who refused to make amends for his choices, and instead chose to allow Fate to destroy you on the altar of your own pride.
“Would you like to stay for dinner?” he asks, his heart warming at the way Malfoy’s eyes widen a little in pleased surprise.
The room fell awkwardly silent. Potter stared mulishly at Ron, some kind of wordless communication happening between them, while Draco discretely but firmly mutilated his palm with his nails to distract himself from the possibility of just Apparating out of this whole situation.
Potter gripped his shoulder, fingernails digging into Draco’s skin and his face pale with fright, but before he could explain what the fuck had just happened, an odd sense of calm descended over Draco. They weren’t alone.
“After the war, Harry was all over the place,” she said in a hushed voice. “He’d be crying one moment—never in front of us, mind you—and then the next second he’d be laughing hysterically over nothing. We could say the stupidest joke, and he’d be off. We figured he was grieving, so we didn’t want to press him, but eventually it just got…” she trailed off.
They never did. His great aunt Tremidia had sprouted wings whenever she got into a spat, which was frequently, but Draco remained wingless. The beak his great, great, great grandfather Vermillion had claimed as an eccentric mask worn only on the new moon served as little more than a cautionary tale.
The sun shining down on them warmed Draco’s shoulders, taking the edge off the chill that suddenly suffused him. Pansy was never one to let things go, and yet she wasn’t latching onto the drunken bet like he’d thought she would. If anything, she seemed to have forgotten about it.
He turned to watch, and found they were correct—a brunette who looked a couple of years older than them, maybe twenty-one, was currently grinding up against Malfoy and undoing his buttons in what he probably thought was a very seductive manner. Malfoy was leaning back against the wall, arms crossed, one eyebrow raised and an amused smirk on his face. Harry noted distantly that he didn’t seem impressed, but neither was he flustered or upset.
“The inhibitor was found just under Mr Weasley’s armpit,” the Healer informed them. “Quite easy to miss in the initial testing. We’re lucky we found it when we did, as I’m certain it was responsible for the febrile convulsion. Typically, we see them in children rather than adults, but as we know, this is not a normal case. As soon as it was removed, Mr Weasley began to respond to treatment—rather quickly, I might add.”
They’d have to start with an investigation at the scene of the crime, just to make sure there weren’t any lingering effects he’d missed, and after a moment’s indecision he decided to invite Potter. It was better he was there, just in case there was something in the Unspeakable archives that rang a bell.
It was a Friday night affair, which meant no expense had been spared. The entry was lined with tasteful garlands, and waiters emerged from every corner with a tray of drinks the moment you felt the slightest bit thirsty.
After all, they had work to do. And time was even more of the essence now. Increased exposure meant increased risk.
“Right,” Malfoy echoed faintly.
Draco stared at him. If someone had asked him to name all the feelings that were swirling around in his gut right that second, he wouldn’t have been able to. He’d never felt this surge of pride for someone else before—pride and respect and so much warmth it was disgusting.
“Fuck off, Malfoy.”
“Much.”
unknown. He staggered to his feet and almost ran to the fireplace. Pinching a handful of Floo powder, he threw it in and called out Potter’s address, resolutely ignoring the fact that before today they hadn’t even been on friendly speaking terms, and now he was making house calls.
Already walking away, Harry shrugged and didn’t look back. “Trust me, it’s fine.”
Potter caught on quickly. His eyes flashed in understanding for the merest second, and then he adopted a sheepish expression. “Look, Malfoy… I know I called you disrespectful and everything, but you don’t need to prove anything to me.”
He shook his head, clearing away the thoughts that didn’t have a place right now. He would deal with them later—much, much later. Possibly never.
“God, Malfoy,” Potter murmured against his mouth. “Do you know how long I’ve wanted this?”
He leaned back into the softness of the chaise and studied the party. It seemed to be going well, but Pansy’s parties always did. He would see her for perhaps a collective five minutes at one of these things—otherwise she was too busy mingling with people she didn’t get a chance to see for months at a time. He thought he’d spotted her by the salad table at one point, but by the time he’d looked back she was already gone.
Draco staggered, certain that no one—not even Blaise—had ever done that to him before. He cleared his throat.
“Because it’s so pure?” he guessed, fairly certain he was right.
When Draco arrived in France, it was the middle of the night and—fittingly—pouring with rain. The old apartment blocks had changed a little since he’d been here last, but the alleys looked the same. He picked his way over the broken bottles and piles of trash until he reached the dumpsters at the end of the lane. There used to be squatters here, when he’d been here last, but the apartments were cleaner now, trendier, and they didn’t stand for that sort of thing anymore.
Draco rose to his feet and crossed the room to retrieve a bottle of scotch from the liquor cabinet. He poured two glasses and sent one floating across the room where Potter took it with a nod of thanks.
Malfoy’s boots echoed in the barren hall as he strode toward the table. Professor McGonagall met him halfway, guiding him to the table as she had done Harry, and turning a blind eye to the restrained nod the two of them gave each other.
Harry agreed, but his eyes kept returning to Malfoy. It didn’t escape his notice that every time he looked, Malfoy was looking at him too.
“You get some odd ones, Harry,” Weasley mumbled around a mouthful of pastry. “What about that wizard who went to Durmstrang? The one who kept hinting he had a sex dungeon.”
“It isn’t enough to offer reparations,” Draco said wearily. “They must be accepted.”
Potter nodded.
Draco reached up and clasped his hand, squeezing it.
It wasn’t cold outside—far from it—but it had nothing on the stifling intensity of the club.
“I’d love to join you… sometime,” Potter said slowly. “But maybe not now? I’m feeling a little—” He broke off and shuddered. “This has been great. I really enjoyed myself, but I think I need a break now. I think I need to be alone.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said abruptly, wetting his lips and looking nervous. He paused, and Draco waited expectantly. “If you’re Veela, shouldn’t I be… well… falling at your feet or something?”
Then, he took a deep breath and left.
“Do you know who—”
“It never helps, mate,” Weasley insisted.
Draco hadn’t even realised he was standing, walking around the table, until he came to a halt just before Potter’s chair. Potter leaned back, legs spreading just a little further, and looked up to meet Draco’s eyes.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “This feels like a terrible apology.”
Viciously, he pulled the glamour back into place.
One of the witches tries to use her copy of the book as an impromptu battering ram, breaking through the shield charm and hammering at Draco’s chest with it while he stands between Harry and the witches. Draco’s only armor is the soiled bedsheets clutched around his waist, while Harry makes creative use of the pillow and tries to recall how Transfiguration works under stress.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said quietly, so that only he could hear. “I think I’ve been a bit… difficult to get along with the last couple of days.”
Once, his father would have reprimanded him for talking back so much, but not anymore. Now, he only settled further into his ramblings, staring into the fire. When he was called away, Draco thought nothing of it, and when the messenger came scurrying back to fetch Draco as well, he felt only the thick slide of dread at what might be to come.
Potter.”
? You dated your stalker?”
Potter raised an eyebrow. “And why do I need to see a Mind Healer, exactly?”
The fact that Rita Skeeter had just published a riveting exposé on their escapades into Diagon Alley the other day only served to fuel their enthusiasm for the charade.
He pulled off, looking up at Draco with mild alarm and fear, but the sight before him made him stop. Draco’s eyes were closed, his mouth slack with pleasure and his eyebrows drawn together with desire. He was waiting, arms behind his head, legs spilling over the side of the table as he lay with complete abandon.
After a long, long time, Potter lifted his head. He reached out and picked up the box from the table, turning it over in his hands and studying it.
Harry turned to him and saw starlight reflected in his eyes.
Harry snorted, and the fog in his mind finally lifted. The world had colour again, and it took him several attempts before he could speak. “Yeah, all right. Trust
An insistent pecking roused Draco from his thoughts, and he left the living room, padding down the long hallway to the conservatory. Alan liked to roost among the moth orchids arranged on the top shelf. Phalaenopsis bloomed regardless of day length, and as the neighbouring cottage often forgot to extinguish their garden lanterns, the moth orchids had been a good choice to minimise light from the west window during night time. For some reason, Alan had gotten it into his head that moth orchids were the only acceptable roosting shrubbery, prompting Draco to change his name from what had been Cassius to a name that more adequately favoured the peacock’s prized ph
Malfoy huffed. “You think I wouldn’t say anything on the chance it might
“You’re in a strange mood.”
Potter laughed and reached out to grab a handful of peanuts, clearly unbothered by the implication.
“Do you want another?” Draco probed gently with a second finger, and Potter nodded eagerly.
He suddenly longed for a cigarette; it had been years since he smoked.
Having had just about all he could take of Potter and curses and dreams that lit his blood on fire, Draco went to bed.
Draco picked an imaginary piece of dust off his lapel. “I happen to think my cock and my heart have some pretty good ideas.”
Yes, the two dozen letters you sent to me over the last three days made it very clear that you’re in this for the long haul. Frankly, I must say I’m delighted to be given the opportunity to relive my childhood by being stalked by the Boy Wonder. I dare say my prolonged absence in writing was only indicative of the time I needed to quietly process such a prestigious honour.
Irritation and hurt rises in Harry’s chest. “Are you saying I didn’t?”
“Nothing else for us to do,” Harry echoed.
Draco’s stomach churned with jealousy, which overwhelmed him immediately after with shock—he knew there was another Veela, so why was he suddenly so annoyed? And in the turbulent mess of emotion, he almost missed the obvious question. Fortunately, his brain was still working.
“Why did the curse bring me here?”
For the first time since they’d begun their bet, there was no hint of suspicion beneath Pansy’s words. Their performance was both subtle and believable enough that Pansy no longer questioned it. For some reason, the thought made Draco’s stomach sink.
“We’re stuck here,” he said flatly to no one in particular.
“Because I didn’t repay my debt fast enough,” he said, wriggling his shoulders to see if wings came out. They didn’t—not yet.
Whatever that something else was, he never wanted it to arrive.
“That’s a rather inelegant way of putting it.” Draco sighed. “But unless you have any better plans?”
Was it an insult, or a compliment?
Potter tipped his head back to lean against the wall and looked at him out of the corner of his eye. “I guess.”
Retail therapy had always been Draco’s go-to. It was enjoyable, distracting, and most importantly required nothing from him emotionally. By lunchtime, his pockets were fall of shrunken bags of clothing, books, an expensive watch that he justified because he’d left home without one, and several pieces of jewelry for Pansy. He’d eyed off a number of ancient texts with Blaise in mind, but he felt he owed Blaise more than a dusty old book, even if the man did go wild for them. He’d settled for a delicate tome on the origins of Herbology and decided to think carefully about something more indicative of the depths of his appreciation.
“You too.”
Harry strode forward and examined the closest artefact—a broken Sneakoscope he assumed was from the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom. “Then the curse is airborne, not just through physical contact.”
I often find that humans are contradictory, nonsensical creatures, and both parts of Draco’s mood are likely true. If you stay, you will be pushing on a boundary that might affect his happiness and well-being. If you leave, you might deprive him of what he truly wants and needs.
He felt suddenly awkward, uncertain about his welcome. Uncertain, too, about whether he should be doing this at all.
“How did the proposal go?” He asked instead of responding.
He didn’t bother waiting for a response and stomped off to his room. The door slammed behind him, and his head
“May I just say, Mr. Potter, your proposal was outstanding. We’re more than happy to partner up with the Aurors in pursuit of such a charitable cause.”
“You’re… surprisingly pleasant… as well,” he managed, ignoring George’s bellowing laughter and Morgan’s one-armed hug.
Potter’s eyes widened, confused and surprised, but there was a hint there of what Draco had known he was going to see: disbelief and hope—hope that he meant that much to someone. Draco kissed him again, soft and slow and full of promise.
In a rousing show of fortitude, Draco’s hands moved through the expected etiquette of preparing tea for his guest, despite their intense urge to strangle him instead.
Harry clenched and unclenched his hands nervously, feeling like he was about to take a test he hadn’t studied for and was very much about to fail. He’d never been good at tests.
Draco nodded, raising one eyebrow in a little dare that Harry found stupidly sexy. “Well, then,” he said lamely.
“Potter,” he said warily, coming to sit beside him on the edge. “Are you sulking?”
“Pull yourself together, Potter,” Malfoy said crossly. He was leading Harry down the corridor to the library where he’d asked Ron and Hermione to meet them.
“I like you, too,” was all Draco said in response, and the small spark that had been growing since they’d really, properly started this thing with emotions and all blossomed into a warm ball in his chest.
Malfoy wasn’t going to end it. Elation surged through him, and he let himself fall back on the bed, a massive grin on his face.
They were leaning so close together, Draco could feel Potter’s breath rasping across his skin with each ragged exhalation. Potter’s face twisted into something pained, something furious.
Then, the wedding march began to play, and they turned around, pretending not to notice the tears in George’s eyes and the steady grip of Kalen’s hand on his shoulder. Draco felt Harry lean back into him, the steady rise and fall of his breath a soothing rhythm, as the doors opened and the hall was filled with light.
Draco ran a hand through his hair and studied the idiot snoring on his chaise longue. He supposed there was a chance the curse would fail, unable to find any compatibility between them at all. But as much as the thought of becoming soulmates with Potter was not only ludicrous but frankly incomprehensible… Draco couldn’t risk those odds. He had to break it himself.
When Malfoy gave a frustrated little “
Draco pulls back and glares at him. “You ate a whole stick to yourself. This isn’t exactly like kissing a dental surgeon.”
. “Again,” he muttered, voice hoarse, “you’ll have to be more specific.”
They fell into silence, something between them shifting and changing under the fading afternoon sun, though Draco couldn’t be certain what it was. Eventually, they finished their tea and Potter went back to examining the wards and making a list of everything they would need to install the complex new protection spells.
Blaise laughed, eyes lighting up with warmth and affection. He squeezed Draco on the shoulder, and Draco leant into the touch, just for a moment. It was grounding and real, and he needed that.
“I'm sorry, Harry. Fuck, I'm so sorry. I love you. I love us, everything about us. I love our routines and predictability.”
But even as the warmth spread lower, his cock hardening, he didn’t feel a need to rush anything. Malfoy had made it clear what he wanted and what he didn’t, and there was something about these moments together that made Harry hesitant to change anything too soon. These two nights they had spent together, long past midnight on a roof in the middle of London, felt somehow removed from time, from history. It felt like something was changing, something bigger than the two of them.
“Ah.” George nodded. “So, it’s a little like reverse engineering a tracking spell—you have to locate all markers before you can get to work on the whole.”
“What the fuck is in that?” Potter gasped.
They buried the elf together, at first an awkward distance apart and then side by side as Potter glared at him and told him to do some work for the first time in his life. Somewhat uncalled for, but Draco didn’t have it in him to argue. He had offered to cut the grave with his wand, but Potter had snarled at him that it needed to be done like this, without magic, and since the alternative had been to stand around awkwardly in the cottage with people who clearly did not want him there, Draco had helped.
She smiled, but it was the gentle, soft smile that nurses give when they’re about to say something bad. “He’s calmer now,” she said, addressing them all. “But I’m afraid we really can’t let you all in to see him yet. Unless any of you are family?”
Anger wars with indignation in Harry’s chest, but he’s too tired for either, so he just says, “Why do you
Potter blinked. “Really? Why?”
Draco read and reread the message so many times, he was certain that Potter was asleep by the time he finally got a new piece of parchment ready.
With one hand, he gripped the base of Draco’s cock while the other drew idle patterns beneath, along the curve of his arse, and he stopped teasing. Draco’s back arched off the table as Harry slid lower down, caressing Draco with his lips and tongue, sucking gently at the tip and then sliding back down.
It had been years since he last took any sort of structured classes, but he didn’t remember them being so difficult. How was it that as a teenager he was capable of spending eight hours in lessons back to back, but as an adult, he could barely handle three hours without wanting to rip his hair out or sleep indefinitely?
She gave the wand a tiny little shimmy, and a cloud of breathable air descended around Draco’s head. He drew in a deep breath and smiled.
Mate… The answer’s in the question.
Potter dropped to his knees, looking up at Draco with a wicked smirk that he had felt certain only existed in his own fantasies, and pulled Draco’s trousers slowly down his thighs. Draco was already hard, and he had to close his eyes when Potter stopped to just
“You didn’t know,” Draco said. “You
Draco Vanished the pinboard, and as it disappeared a funny jolt twisted in his stomach. A tugging, pulling thing. He straightened and shook his head—bizarre.
Potter toyed with a priceless figurine on Draco’s mantle, spinning it this way and that. “Except, apparently, a prophecy-child.”
“Seems a little biased,” Malfoy said, looking over at Ron and Hermione with narrowed eyes. “They could probably do that without the quiz.”
“What is it now?” Draco sneered, but he walked away without waiting for an answer; unwanted guest or no, his parents had raised him with manners, and it was nearly eleven by now, so he led the way to the kitchen where they could discuss Potter’s numerous issues like grown men. Potter shuffled awkwardly behind him, picking objects up and putting them down again like he hadn’t just been here and also didn’t know how to be a functioning adult.
They talked well into the night. Before long, they weren’t even discussing the bet anymore—they were just talking. Part of Draco was singing in delight, reveling in finally having the attention of the famous Harry Potter. The other part of him—the part that was older and less eager for validation—was just enjoying himself.
Draco realised he was nodding along uselessly, and he made himself stop. “We have to find out what the curse is. If we can identify it, we can understand what it’s done to him.”
Can’t wait! I’m wearing sunshine yellow with lilac trim.
So many things were a mystery to Draco these days, when only last week, his life had been blissfully dull and ordinary. Perhaps it had been a mistake to embark on this ruse with Potter. It had seemed such a laugh at the time—make people think they were in love, collect on the debt, throw it in Pansy’s face. What could go wrong?
“You think it’s the curse?”
“I think Ron expressed everything I would have said.”
He froze for several seconds, staring at the scene, before Malfoy turned to him and he realised he was holding several pairs of clean boxers. Flushing, he dropped them on the floor and walked over to the doorway.
The hitch of Malfoy’s breath nearly unravels him. It’s so real, so believable, that for a moment he questions his own sanity. Then he pushes it aside and gives in to the moment.
Potter gave a wry smile. “Embarrassed. I don’t know what the fuck came over me. It was… it was really strange.”
Potter awoke from his undignified stupor in time to step the last remaining foot into Malfoy’s space, bringing them nose to nose, and glared. “I’m not asking you to do anything,” he insisted, as entitled liars do. “I’m requesting your
One boy lifted his wand; the eggs rose as one. The wards around the house flickered, shining silver for a single moment, just like a mirror.
Draco made a wounded sound and wanked madly until he, too, was coming in long spurts that seemed to pull all of the energy out of him. Afterwards, he slumped down on top of Harry, forehead pressed uncomfortably into the junction where his neck met his shoulder. There, he mouthed lazily at the skin of his throat, pressing sloppy kisses where he could reach as he caught his breath.
“I didn’t know he was Veela,” Potter snapped. “I only found that out after I saw him soaring through the bloody sky—not that he even told me then. You waited a good long while, didn’t you, Malfoy?”
“It was better than I thought it would be. You know, you feel one way when you wank by yourself, but with another person…. It was… y’know,
Still, it was horribly annoying to discover that he was becoming less distracted by Potter’s uniquely wild form of attractiveness, and more distracted by… well… him, just him. It was disgusting, and Draco tried to push it from his mind.
Power radiated from the Sanctuary, ancient, furious power, but the clueless wizard on his path continued on, dooming them all. Draco sank back into the bushes—which had become, through Draco’s discomfort, the bushes of the present—unwilling to watch the moment the Veela cursed him.
Potter’s eyes flashed, not just with anger. Blue fire flickered there, and Draco forced himself to play nice.
“How’s it going?”
Draco looked up to see Pansy watching him shrewdly. He supposed he had been rather absent.
“I haven’t thought of anything like that since Fred was around,” George continued, stepping away from Morgan and gesticulating widely. “Do you think if we did away with the fairy boxes and based it on Undetectable Extension charms instead, it might hold better?”
“Not a whit,” Draco agreed, moving to the centre of the room and taking his toolkit from his pocket. “I don’t suppose you know anything about watches, Potter?”
The scent of strongly brewed coffee wafted through the house, and Draco bit down on his tongue—hard—to avoid giving a moan of appreciation.
“You know, I had a dream about this once,” Draco said, biting lightly against Harry’s neck.
The two of them jumped before realising it was only Pansy. She glared at Draco suspiciously, but for once he was confident they had no need to worry about being caught out. After all, this time their closeness had nothing to do with their charade.
Potter tilted his head to the side, studying him. Then he shrugged and turned back to the feathers. “You wanted to know why I’ve been on your property after midnight?”
“I’ve been experiencing a little problem with pranksters recently. I wondered if you might take a look at the wards at my home? Share some of your expertise with me?”
Draco had always hated the smell of St Mungo’s. It was worse in the actual rooms; something about the spell residue and stench of varying ailments and curses combined together to produce something potent and raw. It made him think of Aunt Bellatrix, which came of no real surprise but still sent waves of nausea running through him every time.
the practical work. Where are they keeping the… the… the
“You were telling me you were trying to heal the families you’d hurt, and I told you it wasn’t enough, and whether it is or isn’t that doesn’t matter because you’re trying.”
Draco could spot the new faces in the crowd. They were mostly quiet, trying to follow along with the answers a beat behind everyone else. One little girl looked like she was about to be sick.
“How long has it been since you left the Sanctuary?” Potter asked suddenly, catching the Quaffle with ease and lobbing it straight back to Draco’s chest.
Draco smoothed his fingers over his side of the knot, watching it heal beneath his touch.
“I didn’t realise it was so bad,” Potter said abruptly.
“You egg them back, don’t you?”
“Yeah,” Ron snorted, “You mean like wanting to get into a fight all the time.” He turned to them, then. “You can’t tell me you and Malfoy don’t argue anymore.”
“We’ve only got about an hour left of the potion before we wake up,” he said, his voice coming out rough. “I’d better get to work.”
“That was… wow,” was all he could say.
Behind him, Malfoy made an irritated sound.
Potter’s eyes darkened, and he moved forward with a lurch, eyes glazed and filled with desire. It opened up a pit of yearning within Draco’s heart, seeing a future he could never have become real before his eyes. This curse might well be the worst thing that had ever happened to him, because there was nothing in it he could trust, and—he was slowly, painfully realising—everything that he had always wanted.
Then, he immediately dropped back on his pillows and pretended to be asleep, not because he was attempting to pull off the charade of drunkenness, but because he suddenly and fervently wished he was unconscious. Why was he trying to prolong this conversation? What possible good could come of it?
“What’s happening?” Potter asked, trying to steady the room with his amulet; it didn’t work.
“Right, well, if they’re for your family, surely you have to wrap them, right?”
“Blimy. Do you know what? I think he
Draco glanced over at the crowd of eight years olds huddling excitedly in the centre. One of them had got their hands on a spare broom and was already trying to levitate it. His red curls whipped around his face in the wind, and his cheeks almost matched his hair with the exertion of how hard he was trying to make the broom jump into his hands.
She stood, brushing off her jeans and taking one last look at the fading lights above them. “I reckon you can get them brighter,” she teased.
Leave, and go back to Grimmauld Place, where he was also confined.
There was a mumbled response, but Harry didn’t catch it because Draco made a particularly deft manoeuvre with his wrist and he nearly came.
“No,” he said roughly, shaking his head. Their eyes caught briefly, and for one breathless moment Draco could have sworn Potter’s gaze was heated, staring into him with an intensity he’d only imagined before, on nights that he was particularly drunk and lonely. Then, Potter turned away. “Nothing happened.”
“I don’t think I want to do anything hardcore.”
He felt Potter relax beside him, like he’d been waiting for a different sort of acknowledgement altogether.
With a sweep of his hand, he knocked everything off the coffee table and lay back on it. Harry choked back a laugh that quickly turned into something like a sob as Draco began unbuttoning his shirt, letting it fall away from his pale shoulders and leaving acres of skin in its wake. With another flick of his hand, this time with magic, he Vanished his trousers and boxers.
“Well, shall we?”
He looked back down to see Potter watching him. Potter’s eyes shimmered in the unsteady light of the candles, making him look like he was crying one moment and fiercely bold the next.
As he browsed the shelves, he heard some children burst into the shop, bringing icy wind whirling in with them for a split second before it hit the shop’s warming charm and fell away.
“A pocket world,” he repeated, looking up with a strange gleam in his eye. “That’s wicked.”
But Draco wasn’t sold on that.
“Are you calling me
“I can’t stand not hugging people,” Harry blurted out.
“About yesterday,” Draco said, trying to work out how exactly an apology to Potter should sound. By all accounts, it was unfamiliar territory.
Potter’s brows drew together. “We?”
Potter reeled. “Okay,” he said slowly, holding up his hands. “It’s okay, I didn’t realise…” He stared at Draco, edging backwards.
Potter lifted his eyebrows. “The bet? I don’t think so. Unless you’re not happy with the progress?” He took a sip from his mug. “I figured it was going great, and we just need to keep at it as planned.”
Malfoy led him from the Great Hall all the way up to the library in silence. He sat at one of the long tables and gestured for Harry to take the seat beside him.
They drank, and together they fell asleep.
Then he stood, arms coming to wrap around Draco’s waist and draw him closer. There was a moment where they simply stood and watched each other. Draco’s fingers had drawn down to cup Potter’s jaw, and every place where they touched burned with heat. Draco bent down, closing the distance between them, and pressed their lips together. He wondered if Potter could feel the thudding of his heart between their mouths, if his pulse really was bursting through every millimeter of skin. It certainly felt like it.
“You were wooed by my irresistible charm. It’s okay to say it, Potter. The truth will set you free.”
Potter laughed—a genuine, throaty sound. “Not like this.”
“Don’t worry about the anchor,” Potter growled, shoving Draco’s hands aside and undoing Draco’s fly in one smooth movement.
“I mean.” Draco agreed with a speaking look.
Potter’s eyes flicked to Draco’s, and whatever he saw there made him pause. After a moment, his shoulders slumped and he visibly deflated.
Potter’s eyes met his, and for a moment, Draco thought the firelight was reflected in them. Then he realised the colour was wrong: blue instead of red. The sapphire flames licked Potter’s eyelashes, darting up his hairline and into the ether. They vanished, but the answering call flickered from Draco’s heart—a pounding drum of heat and fire and longing.
? How was he so certain that the two of them, here, could make this work without killing each other?
touching him. He knocked Malfoy’s hand away and replaced it with his own, appreciating the weight of the cock in his hand and the sudden sharp inhale Malfoy made at the contact followed by a quiet, breathy moan as he started moving up and down.
all of that. I hope she finds it too.”
The word fell like a stone between them. Draco winced.
“I won’t disturb you.” Draco lifted his hand in farewell, but George made a noise of protest, and Morgan reached out to grasp his hand.
Draco held up his hands in defence. “I’m not going to make you.”
Draco groaned against Potter’s skin and then dropped back down again. This time, he held nothing back, licking and pressing his tongue as deep as he could while Potter thrust up into his waiting fist. He felt Potter grip his hair in warning, and then his cock jumped, warm ropes of come sliding over Draco’s fingers as Potter howled into the pillow.
The sound of a foot scuffing across the path came from behind the bench and startled him. When he turned to see piercing green eyes staring back at him, for a single moment, he froze in fear. But then everything else faded away and he remembered he could do this. It was only Potter.
“Well,” he said slowly. “You are. So, next time, you can use the front door like a normal person. Is everything all right?”
“I dream about you,” Potter said so suddenly, Draco choked on his own spit. “I dream about you, and when I dreamed too many times to take it anymore, I changed the dream, and it changed the future.”
“It was last conducted successfully by the wizards Stanwart and Thaise, who braided together their magical signatures into an unrecognisable aura that slipped beneath the curse’s protective layer and dismantled it from within,” Potter interrupted, meeting Draco’s eyes while Draco gaped at him.
Thanks to Potter, Draco was now cursed to go through Veela puberty. Again.
“Only what we want,” Malfoy agreed readily, and Harry felt the beginnings of a smile creep onto his face.
“Oh, nothing much.” Pansy waved her hand in the air. “Just an explosion or two and the near destruction of the Granger-Weasley partnership.”
“You’re the Curse Breaker,” Potter said slowly, as if he were talking to a young child. “If something happens to you and this gets out of hand, we might not be able to solve it. I’ll do it.”
Instead of feeling less stressed, which he knew would be the outcome of actually telling them and having it in the open, he felt keyed up and anxious to begin. The fact that he had no idea how they would react was scaring him immensely.
Harry felt a rush of affection towards his friend as he realised that Ron was making an effort to include Malfoy in the conversation. He froze, wondering why the hell he cared.
He knew a little about that. The word had been thrown in his face by a few Mind Healers over the years with varying degrees of tact. Somewhere, between specialists who cost more than a new wing for the Manor and potions that were illegal in some countries, he’d found a way to get by. It wasn’t the best way, and the journey was long, but he had his coping techniques and the Floo address for several professionals when it became too much to bear.
I went back to the café and tried the eclairs. You’re right—they’re to die for.
“My…” Potter’s hand hovered over his thighs for a moment, and Draco collected all his willpower not to take the piss once again. Then the hand moved higher, over his chest. “My heart.”
“It’s 7:00,” Malfoy said with meaning.
“With what?”
“You know, when we first started out, I wasn’t sure if we’d make it all the way to this,” Harry admitted, watching the path of his fingers as they trailed along Draco’s shoulders. “Or if I’d want to.”
Draco studied him, taking in the concern on his face—the sudden softness to his eyes. He took in the lines on Potter’s face, some of them from laughter but many of them from weariness. He noted the darkness beneath his eyes and recalled the way that had evaporated in the blissful afterglow of their single night together.
Draco leaned back against the lockers and just let Harry’s words wash over him. He couldn’t keep the dopey smile from his face, so he didn’t even try. When Harry finally turned to face him, surprise registered on his face for a moment before it was replaced with heat.
“I’ll check the records, but I think so,” Potter agreed.
Harry bit his lip to avoid commenting on the innuendo, but then he looked up and saw the heat in Malfoy’s eyes, and he realised with a jolt that Malfoy was flirting with him.
Draco let out his breath in a rush. “Are you mad? If we let it out here, now, I’ll murder you.”
He watched Malfoy for the rest of dinner, not even bothering to hide it anymore. He had no idea what it could be that was bothering him, or why he had acted like he did, suddenly so cold. All he knew was that he felt like something had been taken away from him. He didn’t even care about the sex, it had nothing to do with that, but that left the question: if it wasn't the sex he was missing, what was it?
hiding something, and hiding things right now was stupid. Secondly, because Draco didn’t want to think about the fact that he hadn’t cared about anyone like this since…
“Well, I’m sorry Malfoy, I’m flattered, but—”
Draco closed his eyes and focused. He could feel the curse working against them, trying to disorient them until all the parts of themselves had fallen away and were lost, no longer able to remember how they ever fitted together.
that he didn’t scare Potter away, and Potter was looking well spooked. “I think you’re fit, and it’s clear we make a good team.” He waved a hand at the parchment in front of them. “What if we tried this for real?”
not the child?” Harry asked, unable to keep from smiling.
After a moment of silence, Malfoy stood up and walked back to the rest of the group. They’d missed their chance at being the first now, and the groups were already peeling off to go search for the various components they needed to complete their summer courses.
“Why would you—
“Right,” Draco said, the word masked by the sound of Potter Apparating away.
“Potter,” he began, but Potter had already opened the window and torn the note from the bird’s leg.
Their hands were slick now, and Harry knew he wasn’t going to last very long. He didn’t even have the capacity to care right now, to be embarrassed. For the first time, he didn’t feel the need to make some kind of ridiculous competition out of everything, and by the sounds Malfoy was making, he didn’t either.
“There’s no point wasting time,” he said, his eyes flicking to the closed door of his work room where complicated symbols etched in red chalk flickered faintly on the wood.
“Potter,” he moaned, reaching down and gripping Potter by the hair. “Harry. Please.”
“All right then, Potter. Let’s go plan our first date.”
“We’ll have to get some ingredients. You know, go out in public, be seen together—
“You just seem a little… upset.”
“I wouldn’t have thought the Weasel had it in him,” he commented, handing the glass over and watching as Harry took a tentative sniff. His eyebrows lifted in amusement at Harry’s expression. “You don’t drink gin?”
“You’ve got to admit,” Ron said, his eyes wide. “It’s pretty funny.”
Draco nodded slowly. Potter had assumed him weak; it figured. What else was new?
“How could you not know she was the stalker?”
Just as he’s getting close, Draco pulls away and mutters a spell beneath his breath. Harry waits for the slickness to appear beneath his legs, but nothing happens, and then Draco is coming closer and sitting down on top of him and it all makes an unexpected and welcome amount of sense. Harry resists the urge to let his eyes roll back in his head and watches instead as Draco guides himself down onto Harry’s cock.
—until he’d realised that he could be attracted to him and still completely hate him, and the world suddenly felt right again.
“What?!” Potter held his hands up defensively. “I’m just saying the truth. It’s not a
hiding in a darkened corner. I had this corner prepared for couples, you know. There’s a spot right behind you that’s just perfect to use as a prop to push someone against while you ravish them.”
He seemed strangely fragile, hunched over the kettle, his back to Draco. It was yet another side to him that Draco hadn’t seen before. He wanted to get to know this side too, all of him, every part of Potter.
Then, he felt a warm hand in his, and he turned back to see Malfoy watching him, a knowing look on his face and something else—something Harry had never thought he would see in those grey eyes: compassion.
Draco knew her well enough to know she was only half-joking.
“Yes.” Draco nodded. “It looks like a variety I’m not familiar with, judging by the residual thickness of the air, but I’m sure it’s just a slight modification.”
“My family is in danger, Malfoy,” he spat. “And you’re still spewing petty bullshit. I thought you’d changed. I thought you might have—” he broke off, turning away to run a hand through his hair before speaking again to the wall. “It takes years to become an Unspeakable, you know. And you get to see a lot of shit along the way. My work— My work touches on curses a lot.”
“Can I?” Potter asked, his voice breathless.
“Perfect.” Harry smiled. “Anything I can do? Or have you done everything?”
Hey Luna,
“I can’t believe you still only have one set of dress robes,” Hermione muttered, fond exasperation on her face. She turned back to Harry and Draco. “It’s good to see you both! It’s been nearly a month, hasn’t it? I’m so sorry. This little one has been sick, and we’ve all been a bit frantic, but we can’t let it get so long between visits again.”
Draco sighed and began the slow process of packing up the paper and tape. He tucked the festive present toppers of tinsel and ribbon back into their box, and then stacked the whole thing inside the embroidered footstool by the fire. It was one of the few things he had taken from the Manor when he had moved out. His mother had always hated it, having a particular distaste for tapestry-style artwork that depicted bustling, hectic scenes, but Draco loved it.
“What burns, Potter?” Draco asked.
He clutched at Harry’s hair, riding out the waves and thrusting as gently as he could manage. Then, Harry pulled away and spat onto the floor, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and smiling up at him. Before he could speak, Draco pulled him upwards and guided him back to the bench behind him. Still warm from the afterglow, he dropped to the ground and settled himself between Harry’s spread thighs.
“How do you like it?” Draco asked, unable to keep from reaching out and running a hand through Potter’s hair, caressing the thick strands. “A little rough? Slow? Kinky? Or are you a vanilla sort of man?”
“You said something was wrong with your magic,” Draco said when he realised too long had passed with him staring at Potter’s arse. The gold had fortunately faded from his irises, but he’d bet the curse wouldn’t need much to get going again. “What does it do?”
“I think Hannah might have gone home with a bit of gossip, tonight,” Potter said with a grin, and it was like the previous conversation had never happened.
“Well there’s a resounding show of conviction,” Draco muttered. “I’m perfectly happy to risk my life now.”
“Yes, I’m not surprised. You were making quite a display of yourself.”
“Even if you are a total git about it,” he continued, ignoring Draco entirely. “Still, I knew you’d see it. No one else does, but I knew you would.”
Harry follows the sound of waves to the beach across the road and sinks into the fine, white sand. This is the life. This is relaxing. This is what it means to not have people hounding your every move and breaking into your house because they’re convinced the scar on your head makes you a great shag.
Nothing happened. The latch moved, the gate shifted, but it simply did not open.
“The—” Potter trailed off, took the glass, drained it, and tried again. “The Fair Folk? Like, fairies? I thought they were a myth.”
it. Not witnessed. We didn’t change the past, but it was a shared dream anchored on the crux of a prophecy, which means it was once a possible future.”
So, I haven’t left France yet, but don’t worry, I’m not going to harass you or anything. I just wanted to send you a letter. As in, for me. I wanted to send you a letter for me. Not for you. I’m not making sense.
Harry wasn’t sure who reached out first, the world seeming to pause for days before he finally felt Malfoy’s hands on him, fierce with warmth and want. He was pointy in all the wrong ways, sharp angles and fierce words, but it was that sharpness that had kept Malfoy going. Kept him chasing the cure until he found it. It shouldn’t be attractive or good at all, but it was. Harry wanted it so much, now he knew what that sharpness meant—both what it concealed and what it
“Oh, no way!” The boy’s eyes widened. “We have to get them! Filch’ll never catch us now!”
Ron had mostly recovered by now.
After a few seconds where Harry scrambles to his feet and backs away to the window, he discerns that three intruders have invaded the room and are fighting to get through Draco’s weakening shield charm. The frantic racing of Harry’s heart fades as he realises they aren’t trying to hurt anyone. At least, not in any way they recognise as pain; the result is subjectively different.
If they took the second box and fused it with the psychical inhibitor from the original, they could overlay it with an echo so that the spell was just confused enough by the familiarity to let them in like nothing had changed. It would be like using a carbon copy.
“Wake up, Potter.”
,” Draco hisses, “you’ll scratch me!”
“I thought you were going to say you were in love with me,” Potter said with a laugh.
Potter’s face closed over. “’S not your business, really.”
Then there was a loud crack, like Apparition mixed with a car crash, and both George and the box disappeared.
The grin fell away from Malfoy’s face and he turned back to the parchment. “Pet peeve?”
“I mentioned something similar to Robards, once. Not the security spells, but I wanted to provide a detail for a family on their first journey to Hogwarts. Nothing too flash—just an Auror accompaniment to Platform 9 ¾.  Their son had been threatened by pure-bloods in the neighborhood for years, and the mother was terrified of sending him off on his own.” His eyes hardened. “Robards went on for a full thirty minutes about how it wasn’t the Ministry’s place to interfere with schoolyard bullying. He kept saying how it wasn’t sending the right message and that it was a waste of funding. I tried to explain that it had nothing to do with the kids—it was about sending a message to the parents, so that they knew the Ministry wasn’t turning a blind eye to old prejudices. But he didn’t get it.”
“There’s your romance,” he said, reaching for one of the vials by Malfoy’s hip. “Get properly on the bed so I don’t have to do this half bent over.”
“He’s stable,” she said softly, speaking to both of them. “And the Healers say there is no mind damage at this point in time. Draco and Harry will find the solution.”
The nurse frowned. “Blood?”
“I think it’s time we got them back.” Potter’s eyes lit up with a fierce determination.
The amulet twirled in Potter’s fingers, catching the light. It was such a gentle illumination here, in this room, and Draco realise with a sudden startled clarity that he had remembered bits of it last night; namely, the way that Potter’s eyes looked when they watched him.
“Yes?”
“Of course.” Potter scoffed. “We’re both adults, despite what Hermione suggests. Why on earth couldn’t we? It’s not as though we’d be actually dating.”
“Our ordinary lives,” Potter repeated, his voice slow and thick. “Right.”
But Malfoy didn’t even sit with him, choosing instead to sit halfway down the table with two students who had gone to Durmstrang and were studying for the London Aurors with Ron and Seamus.
Draco chewed on his lip. “But the other signs…”
Harry reached for his hand and held it, staring around them with awe, and Draco quite forgot the view in place of his boyfriend’s expression.
“Yes, Potter, I have the lubricant. I only made it myself and have told you this half a dozen times.”
He waited a few minutes and then decided Potter must have fallen asleep in front of the hearth. The image soothed him, warming him all the way to his toes despite the dying fire. He stood up, stretching his hands above his head and sighing at the delicious cracks his body made.
each other—at the Manor, in the Fiendfyre, at the trials. Now. Because you know we’ll somehow save each other now, too.”
“True on both accounts,” he said dryly.
Potter laughed and took the bottle, pouring himself a new glass and raising it in the air. “To true love.”
was raised?” He jabbed a finger towards the family in the corner, though he didn’t turn away from Draco. “Like that. Do you know what it’s like, to be called a freak when you let slip a little accidental magic? Do you know how fucking terrifying it is to think that maybe, maybe
Harry emerged from the kitchen, his hair tousled and wet from the shower. The pale blue sweater Draco had picked out fit him perfectly, and Draco privately congratulated himself on getting Harry out of the leather jacket.
“Well, yeah, mate,” he said confusedly. “You did ask us here to talk about something.”
The curtains were pulled shut, and even with the faint light Draco could now see coming from what must be Potter’s study, the place felt gloomy and uninhabited. It felt haunted, but not in the wizarding sense, where you could talk and laugh with the ghosts—it felt Muggle haunted, where your every step was shadowed by an unknown creature, sapping your strength and sanity when you least expected it. Draco had a brief, delirious thought that it was haunted by Potter.
He let Malfoy lead him onto the dance floor and draw him close, their bodies moving together. The music was wild, vibrant, but Malfoy slowed them right down until they had transformed the song into something else entirely. The obnoxious melody still rang out over the top, but they weren’t moving to that, they were dancing to some other undercurrent instead.
The first words that came out of Draco’s mouth were, “It’s not that kind of Sanctuary, imbecile.” And then he’d realised this was actually quite serious, blast it all, and tugged the feverish and delusional man inside. The second words he uttered were along the lines of
“But it isn’t the same.”
When had it become acceptable to make jokes with Potter? But that wasn’t the half of it, because inside Draco was seething with a turmoil of emotions he couldn’t name. He remembered the anger and bitterness that he felt outside of the dream-state, but as the minutes passed it was being overridden by the increasing sense of warmth and tentative curiosity that seemed to define their relationship in this space. He wondered if Potter felt it too.
“Do share with the class.”
“’Fraid so,” Potter said with a laugh.
“And to think, you were suggesting we just charge ahead without any more research,” Potter said with a faint grin. “How disgustingly Gryffindor of you.”
“I don’t understand why it’s up to me.” Draco frowned. “This is meant to be about what I owe, not you.”
Pansy only laughed.
He collapsed on the bed, plumes of dust startling into the air around him, and stared at the ceiling. After a moment, he lifted his wand and sent a tiny ball of golden sparks into the air. It hovered for a second, and then disappeared through the wall and into the night.
Harry didn’t understand it. In particular, he couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that people were brazen enough to have sex so baldly and without any discernable need for privacy or any consideration for the people who may or may not have been unwittingly handed front row seats for the showing.
“Every other record of this spell had the wizard appearing in front of the curse. The fact that we were always inside it was the final clue,” Draco explained. “It told us the curse’s purpose, though we didn’t realise it. The whole thing was made to trap someone inside and then disappear—when it became aware of us last time, right at the start of the session, instead of going into an intruder-induced craze and eating us, it assumed it had succeeded. It was getting ready to take us away.”
Draco followed. “The one who kept sending love potions?”
After an uncomfortable greeting where Draco tried his best to look as though he hadn’t been five minutes away from strangling their honorary brother, the four of them went back into the workroom.
He considered refusing to allow Potter to join him, childish temper tantrums be damned, but there was a strong, undeniable part of him that was looking at the situation objectively. Potter knew the spell. He had access to information no one else did. Once they were inside the mechanism, there were no second chances. They could re-engage as many times as they liked, but they couldn’t introduce someone new or it would weaken the structure.
Weasley smacked his forehead. “Right. I forgot I sent her there for the tea towels. I left them at the office. Shit.” He hurried away towards the fire and stuck his head in, yelling for his sister.
Potter looked over at him, eyes and face already soft with sleep. “You don’t have to go home, obviously. Just stay here. No sense in running out the door; we’re friends.”
“Yes, and you complained the entire time you were getting ready,” Granger said, failing to hold back another laugh.
The room seemed to hold its breath as they stared at one another, each surrounded by lonely memories best forgotten. After a moment, Potter reached out to clasp him on the shoulder. It was only brief, the barest touch of skin on fabric before he turned away, but it was like nothing Draco had ever felt before: warm and gentle and a little bit awkward, but all the more powerful because of it.
In the centre of his beacon, there was no light. There was a darkness there that had somehow been darker than shadow—not just the mere absence of light, but an unearthly pit that swallowed the rest whole. When the tiny witch with the bright pink hair had Apparated next to him, startling him out of a trance he hadn’t known he’d fallen into, she explained that it had been that centre that drew her here.
“Do you know where he lives?” Draco asked.
“Took me for an iKea man?”
“What’s that noise?” he said, looking around in alarm. “I thought I heard someone scream.”
Harry raised his eyebrows, taking in the magenta backing and the fifty hoola-hooping Santa Claus that he could see just from that small strip alone.
“What kind of scene?” Potter leered at him, the anger melting away to leave heat in its place. “I mean, if you’re offering. If I’m going to cause a scene, there might as well be something in it for me.”
“Can I?” He breathed, his lips brushing against Harry’s mouth as he spoke.
He shook his head, clearing away the maudlin thoughts before they overwhelmed him. It would do no good to stew on it tonight, or any night. But maybe… maybe he’d reached a point where he needed to talk to someone. He was in too deep already, and he badly wanted a second opinion.
“I think it’s your only chance.”
They Apparated back to Draco’s to get ready for the pub, taking their time with languid kisses and conversation. By the time they were ready, the light had almost faded. Potter’s eyes glittered in the lamplight, bright with affection and simmering heat.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “If he was trying to impress George by trapping him in a box, why is he suddenly afraid to let him go?” he snarled. “Wasn’t this the whole purpose of the exercise?”
His head snapped up. He caught sight of his reflection in the crystal cabinet: his eyes were wide and crazed, the candlelight sending erratic shadows dancing across his face. Surely not. Surely it wasn’t
It was smoother, this time, waking up in a seated position instead of slumped over on the cold floor. His limbs were still stiff, but they lacked the dull ache of injury. With a start, he realised he had slipped into a relaxed lean against Potter, and he pulled himself upright before it became obvious.
“It’s been marvelous hearing about it,” Narcissa said reaching out to take Pansy’s hand and squeeze it briefly. “But I do have to run now. Be sure to keep me informed as to how it goes. You don’t have to wait for Draco to invite you.” She smirked at her son and then waved her goodbyes, leaving the two of them alone.
printed on it in tiny letters under the author’s name, that Malfoy spoke again.
He wasn’t sure how to properly convince them that he was going to go after Potter and fix this. How on earth could you come back from an argument like that?
“I’m going to try for two,” he warned, pulling his finger out entirely and making sure the two together were slick enough. The press back inside was more of a struggle than the first had been, and he had to keep pausing every time Malfoy twitched. It was entrancing to see and feel his fingers pumping slowly in and out of Malfoy.
“What?”
“After the war, I could feel it. Dead, but lingering, rotting away in my blood. The Unspeakables wanted to study me, like I was some kind of lab rat. Given half the choice, I reckon they would have left it inside me just to see what it did.”
He nodded towards the table where their friends were sitting and they headed back.
He was just starting to believe that Malfoy would never respond when he finally moved. It was just to lean back against the chair more firmly as he perused Harry with what might have been interest or perhaps curiosity, but it made Harry feel loads better.
“What?” The word came out far weaker than Draco meant it to as he froze in place.
“It’s an excellent idea.” The warmth in his own tone just about disgusted him, if he wasn’t already resigned to what Potter was turning him into.
“Then please, by all means, make it stop,” Draco replied. “But until then… all you can do is stamp on it when it rears its ugly head.”
To Draco’s surprise and confusion, Potter winced. “That sounds awful.”
“Ron, catch—and GO!”
Malfoy’s eyes dropped to Harry’s mouth, and he bit his lip, but neither of them made a move for the other. It was somehow more intimate than if they had been kissing. Warmth spread through Harry’s body, filling him with sweet anticipation for what might come, tonight or some other night in the future.
“What the hell, Malfoy?”
Harry barely even waits until he’s home before consuming the sweet. It’s chewy and tastes a little like cabbages, but he is already salivating the second he pops it in his mouth, eager to experience the latest ride that Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes has to offer.
Draco’s head spun. Something was at work here, some piece of fate that he couldn’t trace, and if it went one way Potter would die, and if it went another…
“I have to go,” he said, and turned swiftly on his heel before Potter could say anything.
“No,” Draco said icily, stepping away from the table. “Don’t think I will, Pansy dearest. Enjoy your night.”
However, since that would mean dealing with people, he begrudgingly just let him in.
The fire flared green as the parchment disappeared. After a moment, it flared again and a new ball of parchment shot out onto the heart. Draco kneeled forward to grab it.
It was nonetheless surprising when Potter nodded, and it forced Draco’s thoughts to return, once again, to the baffling mystery that was Unspeakable Potter.
What the hell was Draco meant to do with that?
Harry huffed a laugh, his cheeks suddenly hot. “A bit.”
Hermione
“I forget pens all the time.” Potter held up his hands in defence. “It’s not a bad thing.”
Draco gaped after him indignantly. He was just about to insist Potter regain any manners he had once possessed, when he noticed that Potter was wearing the same clothing as yesterday. He frowned, wondering how to broach the question—or what the question might even be—but the workroom door was already banging shut, leaving him alone.
Malfoy swallowed. “Quite often. Sometimes at Hogwarts, too.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth curled up, and he sat back, starting to unbutton his robe.
Malfoy continued to stare at him. It should probably be awkward, but Harry couldn't find it in him to care. Finally, Malfoy said, “What the fuck happened to you, Potter?”
To Draco’s surprise and fury, Potter laughed. “I actually can’t tell you that, Malfoy. Sorry. Occupational necessity.”
It was a slow trajectory through the air, the eggs sailing in a beautiful wave towards the space where the wards began. A sound like cracking glass surrounded them, and for one shining moment the boy’s face was alight with triumph.
“He’s
of the daily tragedies he must endure. You want to change people’s way of thinking, and every time you think of a way to do it, your superiors tell you it’s a waste of Ministry resources.”
He suddenly remembered what it was like this time last year, wrapping presents alone, drunk, and wishing stupidly that Harry was there with him. He pulled back and stood up, ignoring Harry’s protest and spinning him around so that his hands were braced on the dining table.
Malfoy,
Draco breathed a sigh of relief, though he could tell from Potter’s voice that there was a ‘barely’ hidden in there somewhere.
“I didn’t mean lonely.” Potter shook his head. “I meant you aren’t surrounded by cronies. That sort of… defined you at Hogwarts. You were the head of a pack of idiots. Even when you were alone you were… part of something else. A thought that didn’t belong to you. But here, you’re just you.” He shrugged. “I like you better this way.”
There was almost a peace in that. Peace and a fierce, aching, sadness that Harry thought might never go away.
“That would be somewhat limiting,” Professor Staltwort said with a genial smile. “Select your partners, please. I understand we have an odd number of students, but no more than three to a group!”
The harsh, urgent side of him piped up, pointing out that by doing so, he had lost Potter. Was it worth it? Was he a better trade than the Boy Who Lived?
Harry
Morgan and Potter rushed to him, holding him, telling him it was over, long over, but when George looked up and met Draco’s eyes, they were cold and empty. Nothing like this was ever over, and they all knew it.
As the heavy wooden doors fell shut behind them, finally hiding the whispering couples and curious faces, Draco didn’t feel triumphant that their ruse was taking shape; he felt exposed.
“Draco’s his partner,” Pansy said, giving him a little shove forward.
Every word had been planned, but Draco saw red.
After several seconds of tense silence, Potter relaxed. Somehow, Draco had said the right thing.
Weasley snorted. “Wouldn’t dream of it. My tongue would probably drop off if I tried to speak fluent ponce. Don’t touch the squid display.” He pointed to something bright red in the corner that jiggled ominously. “It bites.”
“Did you know that Hermione would go spare if she had any idea that you knew something about me that she didn’t?”
“I want to make you feel like that,” Draco finished, leaning forward to kiss him again, slow and languid.
unfair bias. Preference, not bias. Make sense?”
Malfoy made a noise—shocked, a little awed. His eyes were wide, a tinge of pink rising on his cheeks.
here.”
All Harry could think about was how good he smelled and just how much he wanted to bury his face in Draco’s neck, and suddenly all he wanted was to get back to their room and lock the door.
Unease settled on Potter’s features, along with another glimpse of the rage Draco had seen earlier. “Unless you remember how I hurt you, I guess.”
The voice pierced through the fog of his increasing panic—something about its tone dragging him out of his thoughts. He looked up and saw Potter’s concerned face mere inches from his own.
Draco didn’t answer.
Harry didn't even know his relationship needed saving.
He felt a strange familiarity at the urgency that was building between them. It made him think of Quidditch games, racing side by side for the snitch, or even of arguments where they were standing two feet away from each other, each desperate to gain the upper hand. Funnily enough, he didn’t care who had the upper hand right now, and when they both began to slide their palms down each other’s chests, reaching blindly for buttons and zips, panting into each others mouths, he felt a momentarily overwhelming sensation that they should have tried this earlier.
“Right,” Draco said slowly.
“Anything else I need to add?”
When had it gone away?
I asked about the old tabby cat. The owners were delighted that someone remembered her. Her name was Pattenrond, and she was indeed the mother of Noirot. Pattenrond never liked guests, apparently. She’d always leave when someone came too close, so she must have loved you if she stayed asleep while you sat with her.
“Both. I liked what we did the other night, and wouldn’t be averse to doing that again and maybe even going further, but I want to be prepared before we go all the way.”
“—and I spent several exhausting days searching for you and trying to blend in by talking like a chav.” He pinches the bridge of his nose and winces, presumably at the memory of his abused vocal chords. “I tried an accent spell but it didn’t work and I ended up sounding like Steve Irwin on cocaine. At least without the spell I was in control of the sounds coming out of my mouth.”
He wants to push Malfoy back down on the table, to take him apart with his lips and his tongue, but before he has the chance to do so, Malfoy drops to his knees. His fingers are shaky as they unbutton Harry’s trousers, shoving the fabric aside so haphazardly Harry is sure a cheaper material would have torn. When he reaches for Harry’s pants, he pauses, breath coming visibly shallow and harsh. He wets his lips. Then, very carefully, almost reverently, he pulls Harry’s pants down to meet his trousers around his thighs.
“Um,” Harry said slowly, looking over to where Malfoy was standing on his own. “I don’t know.”
their argument, which meant that he was still holding Draco in at least semi-professional regard. And he didn’t look like he had mentioned their disagreement either.
Malfoy, whose head was pillowed on his chest, breathed out a sigh that Harry felt down his torso.
The times when he wasn’t in therapy, Draco worked from his apartment. He conducted meetings via Floo call, arranged paperwork via owl, and started to enjoy his time alone. He’d never much liked being alone. The silence would build in his ears until he started to hear things and he had to run, to escape. But it was different now. He could play whatever music he wanted, whenever he felt like it. He ate in fine restaurants, enjoying the atmosphere just as much as the food. There was no need to pretend, no need to put on a mask just to get by in simple interactions.
“Me?” Harry spluttered. “No. Why the hell would I want space? You’re the one who suddenly turned ice cold just because I asked you to give me a real compliment. Was it really that hard to tell me something nice? Surely after everything we’ve been doing, you could pick one thing that you like about me.”
Draco sniffed delicately. “I suppose it’s too much to hope you could grow to learn the appropriate pureblood decorum?”
Then he remembered the Sneakoscope, and how it had glowed right before the door had locked. He turned to it, and he could almost feel the air freezing solid, the hex creeping towards the closest threat. It flickered like lightning.
Once or twice, Malfoy’s breath hitched. Each time, he stopped to make sure he wasn’t in pain. Every time, Malfoy glared at him and told him to keep going until, finally, the noises went back to being recognisably ones of pleasure.
“Oh, Harry. I never knew you had a fetish for aristocracy. Does my accent make you tremor?”
No. That wasn’t what Potter had said. He’d said that Weasley had a biased view—that Weasley would view him in a way that was different to how the rest of the world saw him. Kinder. Rose-tinted.
“I don’t follow.”
Harry frowned. He knew Malfoy was only being dismissive because it was a stupid exercise, and he was confident from Malfoy’s responses that he was more than happy to have Harry in his bed, but something about the flippant way that Malfoy had used that knowledge, their experiences, to dismiss the question bothered him.
When Potter spoke again, his voice was cold. “Did you hear them? What they said to him?”
“When we started out, I was uncomfortable with the idea of complete sexual intimacy, but I think I might be ready for it now.”
“It isn’t enough for you to rely on the law to influence people’s behavior. You want them to understand what their prejudice does. You want them to see that there is a face to the half-blood child they so despise—a tear-stricken, terrified face that deserves
“I don’t think forgiveness is about right or wrong,” Draco said slowly, staring at the feathers growing up his forearms. “It isn’t about being just—it’s the opposite of justice, actually, Potter—wrap your Gryffindor head around that one. It’s separate from it. Forgiveness is just something you offer. If you want to.”
“Unspeakable tosspot?” Potter snorted, and Draco edged closer. “Is that the best you’ve got? You ought to be more worried about the uninhibited access I have to surveillance spells now, mate.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Clearly, I’m being facetious. And why are you calling me ‘Draco’ all of a sudden? Have you had an aneurysm?”
It watched him, tilting its hooded head to the side as though assessing him. Moonlight glinted as the tree outside his window swayed, and for a moment he saw a flash of what might have been a beak.
Harry shook his head. “It can’t find her.”
Potter blinked in surprise. “Yeah, the Barkley’s case. All the wards were shattered. How come?”
“Defeating Lord Voldemort was never going to be enough.” The words dragged out of him. They were thoughts he’d long mulled over, but never closely examined since, in many ways, they cut too close to home. “To affect real change, you need to dismantle the systems that allowed him to gain power.”
“Right,” Blaise said, breathing heavily, ignoring the looks of confusion from the other three.
He felt Potter come to stand behind him and look around the room, and when Draco turned to look at him, he had an expression of calculated interest in his eyes. It made Draco feel unusually self-conscious, and he covered it with a fierce glare.
Potter waved his hand. “You don’t respect anyone. What does that matter?”
Which left the Veela Curse. Enacted as revenge for interfering with a Veela nest, the enraged mother could curse the invader with an appropriate mate.
“Well maybe if you’d asked nicely instead of accusing me of possessing exactly zero brain cells, we would have realised that a whole lot sooner,” Draco retorted after he’d caught his breath.
“We’ve done all we can,” Malfoy said, finally easing enough to agree with him. “It’s up to her now.”
Draco turned his attention to the peafowl, finding Potter’s face suddenly difficult to look at. “Igrelda’s getting a mean look in her eye,” he said idly.
As the night went on, without meaning to, Harry found himself matching Malfoy drink for drink, keeping his pace. He wasn’t sure why, but he didn’t like the idea of being drunker than him. He didn’t mind losing a bit of control around the others, but it was the thought of what might happen once they left, what he might say or do, that made him stiffen up and refuse to drink too deeply.
“They’re so confused.” He clapped Draco on the back and shook his head. “It’s unreal. If they only looked down, they’d see you practically punching them, mate. But they fall for it every time just because you smile at them. Disgusting really. How is it that
Harry looked up to see a shrewd expression appear on Malfoy’s face, his eyes flicking to the balcony, only to vanish immediately. He blinked, but Malfoy was the picture of innocence.
From the other side of the room, Harry thought he might have heard Malfoy sniff. Looking over at him, he thought perhaps he saw his shoulders shake, or maybe twitch. Harry found himself in the odd position of sympathising with Malfoy. Umbridge was an entirely other level of PTSD that left a lasting impression.
“One thing I don’t understand,” he said slowly, “is why you even acceded the bet in the first place? It was clear we weren’t in a healthy or mature relationship at all, even if it was at least obvious we were fucking.”
Well, damn. Wasn’t that just a sentence that begged clarification. Draco closed his eyes and counted to ten, forcing himself to swallow down the insatiable need to know more about Potter, always more.
Draco froze. “What wands?” he asked, carefully stirring his tea.
“It’s dinnertime,” he said plainly, looking over Harry’s left shoulder. As he gawped in confusion, the muscles in Malfoy’s cheek jumped.
There didn’t appear to be anything out of order in his surroundings. The polished wood of the table was unsinged and the passing waiters seemed entirely unruffled as they greeted new customers. Both Weasley and Granger were giving each other secret smiles over the top of their glasses, blissfully unaware of the rest of the pub.
rushed,” he agreed. “Because we are running out of time. I’m nearly completely certain that the box presents no great danger to us, but the prospect of further packages, with even more non-Ministry-approved magic therein, does.”
“Yes. Fine. I’ll meet them, if it’s important to you.” He laid back down, putting his head back on Harry’s shoulder. Harry squirmed until he had an arm around him.
“My name is Draco.”
“I hardly use my Floo,” Draco said, putting down his quill and Vanishing the specks of ash that fell on the carpet. “Anyone with decorum knows to Apparate to the foyer where the elves can announce them.”
Then, he dropped a few Galleons on the table and walked away.
Draco waved a hand. “Not you and I, obviously. But I need an anchor. The spell hasn’t been used in centuries—it hasn’t been needed. It’s highly complex and involves dissecting the spellwork while engaging in something like a meditative state.” He grimaced a little, his mind wandering to several readings he’d done on the process. He knew he was rambling, but he couldn’t make himself stop. The whole situation was just so unbelievable. “You enter a dream-state where you can see the curse manifest as something physical and tangible, like tree or a wall or something that can be analysed. But, of course, to do that you have to trick the curse into thinking you’re not a threat, and the easiest way to do
The room suddenly lurched, and Potter’s hand jumped to his chest where he kept the anchor amulet. Draco held his breath as Potter closed his eyes and repeated a quiet incantation under his breath. Slowly, the ground grew steady again.
Harry held the parchment up to Malfoy and watched as he scanned it slowly, eyes darting across the page, back and forth. He reached the bottom, looked at Harry, and then read it again. Finally, he said, “You mean words? All put together like this? One after the other? I know it’s a notch above your reading level, Potter, but do give it a try.”
Somewhere in the distance, a group of teenagers are playing beach cricket and chugging back tinnies. The harsh cries of “Howzat” float down on the wind, accompanied by the raucous screeching of a flock of seagulls eyeing off a nearby tourist’s unguarded chips. Harry spares one final moment to stare out at the ocean longingly, silently farewelling this sun-kissed land and all the joy it might have held for him.
Do you like men? Do you want to come back with me? Do you like
Harry’s hackles rise. “All the more reason to tell me then, yeah?”
She levelled him with a stare. “You know exactly what I’m talking about. Stop pretending.”
Harry’s fingers dug into the wood of the table and he pushed back into Draco, whimpering as his cock began to pulse, and then he was coming. Draco pushed up his shirt and trailed kisses down his back, thrusting slowly as Harry came down from his orgasm, and then he couldn’t hold back any more. He gripped Harry’s hips and pushed in faster, harder, until he was spilling over too.
Granger frowned and leant forward on the desk. Her long, bushy hair fell into her face, but she didn’t seem to even notice. Draco had no question that he’d already had her full attention, but he suddenly felt like he now had her scrutiny.
Harry felt him turn so that he was looking at Harry, breath ghosting across his cheek. He swallowed and continued to look at the ceiling.
Potter shrugged, staring down into his tumbler of scotch. “Can’t, really. Just trying to stop it where I can.”
“I wouldn’t have thought you’d be anxious,” Draco said quietly. “Do you think she won’t show?”
Seamus burst out laughing, but he stood up anyway and stretched. “Oh, who cares? They’re having fun. Good on ‘em.”
“Yeah, that one. Well, I might have dated her a bit.”
his father.
“I have to go,” Draco said, a little harsher than he meant to. “Are you coming to Blaise’s party on Saturday?”
that your complete inability to trust I’m a capable human has given the game up before we could even begin.” Potter shoved his glass away and glared at Draco with disgust.
Potter yelped and scrambled backward. Draco waved his hand vaguely, his words failing him and leaving him with nothing but a woeful, defeated expression.
“Keep up with what? Sitting in fucking silence? Yeah, that’s really taxing.”
“If it is, you’re losing,” he spat, distantly acknowledging that it didn’t make a whole lot of sense and just going with it anyway.
His hands stilled and he felt the blood drain from his face. He turned to Potter and watched as understanding crossed his features.
He flexed his fingers, and claws that should only have appeared beneath the harvest moon unsheathed themselves from beneath his human nails.
But Potter had already gone.
“Of course I do.”
Potter shook his head, careful and oh so certain. “Ten years, Draco. The curse waited ten years until we were ready to be soulmates. It doesn’t want to kill us; it wants to save us.”
The sound of someone complaining loudly and indignantly about the quantity of marshmallows in his cup broke through Draco’s thoughts, and he returned to the present. He felt Potter shift beside him, glancing up before quickly looking back down again at his cup.
The words were like ice straight down Draco’s back, but Potter wasn’t finished.
“To that end, we need to consider the pushback once pure-blood families read between the lines and see that they’re unlikely to gain assistance from the program if they’re magically capable of providing the security the program provides.”
Potter’s eyes widened and his face turned carefully blank. “Pays to be prepared,” he said, a touch weakly.
“Pure fear that calling for Weasley will get me six of them at once,” Draco responded immediately. “I am a practical man.” He shot Potter a smirk. “Why? Are you jealous?”
Granger stood up, wobbled a little, and tried to usher Potter out of his seat, but he only crossed his arms over his chest and glared up at her mulishly.
Or, perhaps being surrounded by laughter and love was turning him into a sentimental twat, and as soon as they parted ways he would fall back into his blissful life of bachelorhood.
To be quite honest, he couldn’t fucking believe it had taken this long.
Draco’s tiredness disappeared, replaced by a burning need to get Potter alone, to hear his voice where there were no other distractions, to see all the many emotions he wore openly on his face when he stopped worrying about who was watching.
Pansy’s words echoed back through his mind:
“You never were the brightest quill in the box,” Draco agrees, but there’s a smirk on his face that reveals he’s only joking.
“Well, I think the likelihood of us holding a stable trance is slim to none at this time,” Draco said stiffly. “And since time is of the essence, I fail to see that we have another choice.”
Then he remembered why he was out here, and the smile fell away. Malfoy continued to watch him, brow furrowed in confusion.
Blaise shook his head and held up his hands, silently pleading for mercy. “I don’t mean that he’s manipulating you. He’s absolutely not. But please understand, Draco, before you continue with this, that if you’re not careful, you could get hurt. Really hurt. That doesn’t mean you don’t do it; it means you have to do it
“That’s all we really have, when you get down to it,” Harry pointed out, thinking of the two metre distance he was required to keep from people at all times. “Maybe that’s why this one hurt the most; it took that too.”
The sounds of the club faded around them, giving way to the intoxicating thrall of sweat and a bassline that thudded somewhere in their chest. Malfoy’s hands lifted up, playing with his hair, teasing him, and Harry responded by keeping his hands firmly to himself—teasing Malfoy in an entirely different way.
Then it shifted, and he thought for a moment he was back in his own nightmares, in the memories Potter had stirred up by talking of borrowed wands and drastic measures. But he couldn’t be. These dreams were Potter’s.
“Ah, a play for more attention,” Draco said, nodding thoughtfully. “I should have guessed.”
“Quite.” Draco shifted in his seat, trying to regain the upper hand and finding it impossible. Potter was an Unspeakable; he probably knew more than Draco did. “A person may be forgiven for thinking that this blood conduit is functionally the same as a magical creature, like a Veela or a house-elf, but it is not. Blood as a conduit still limits the magic to the blood, requiring focus to appropriately wield the channel of power. A creature
A large piece of parchment shot through the fire and hit him in the foot.
“Never.” Her eyes turned grim. “We’d like to keep the patient for another day, just to monitor him since this case is so unusual. At this stage, there is no indication of long-term damage.”
He remembered those times huddled on his living room floor, crying because he had never felt emptier or more alone.
“Nathan.”
The silence stretched, and it was oddly pleasant, until Potter said, “Paying things back doesn’t mean you’re off the hook, though.”
“Don’t beat yourself up about it,” Draco mumbled, folding his arms and leaning back in the doorway. “You’re the first person to put it together in two centuries.”
When he put it like that, it sounded perfectly stupid. Harry had never known Malfoy to take his feelings into account when he said anything. At least, not in a positive way. There’d been the whole thing with the dementors in third year just
“Anything I can do to help?” Potter asked, shoving his hands in his pockets and looking awkwardly around the room. “It doesn’t take much attention to monitor the anchor, and I’ve got a bit of experience in locating nasty curses.”
“I know.”
“But I don’t think I quite want… Could we just keep things as they are for now?” His cheeks—already flushed from exertion—turned pinker. “I want to get to know you.”
“Would you mind if I checked on the orchids?” he asked, rising to his feet. “It soothes me.”
“Eggs,” Potter said, still with that faint smile.
By the time he manages to tear himself away from the expression on Draco’s face, he is late. Even still, he doesn’t go to the office. He beelines for the bathroom and stares at himself in the cracked mirror above the sink. His face looks lined and haggard. It hadn’t seemed to matter before, when he thought his looks weren’t that important, but now he’s starting to wonder—should he be making more of an effort? Or is it too late even for that?
Weasley opened the door before he’d even had the chance to knock.
“What?” Draco gaped at him. “No—it’s new. It only got set off when Potter ignited the curse and sent me back into fledgling.”
Harry smiled slowly. “Do you have a preference?”
Draco snorted at that, unable to keep the thought of exactly how little he would have minded their imaginary tryst from overwhelming his mind. It would be hilarious if it wasn’t so bloody pathetic.
“Draco.” His voice cracks, and his eyes open wide and snap to Draco’s.
Potter leaned back against the wall, and his eyes seemed suddenly dull. It was as if all the life had been drained away from them.
A jolt of heat rushed through him. Potter almost looked like he was jealous. His jaw was set firm and his eyes were piercing as he stared at Draco, challenging him.
Harry reached out to adjust Draco’s lapel, and Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair. They were as ready as they could ever be, and after sharing a final, secret smile, they stepped into the Floo and left to face the outside world together.
Draco considered how different they were now, even to when they had met in the shop just the other day. Something had changed.
“So you want to pretend we’re pretending to fall in love, and then pretend to fall in love along the way,” Potter summarised, smirking a little into his glass.
Harry kept pressing at the spot he’d found, eyes darting between Malfoy’s face, cock and arse. He couldn’t decide which part he liked best, and it was all he could do to take it all in at the same time.
“Seriously, Malfoy.”
“I don’t understand how they’re getting through the wards,” he said finally, turning his piercing stare onto Draco.
When Draco turned back to the others, Pansy was still watching him.
“It was just meant to be exciting—a big explosion—and then the inhibitor was part of the original design. I thought I weakened it so it just made you a bit sleepy and more likely to open the box, but it must have revived.”
“Two years. They signed Hedley for seeker and Fayose and Carilo for beaters,” Harry said distractedly, thoughts whizzing through his head at a million miles an hour. He hadn’t thought it was common knowledge; Ron seemed surprised if not disappointed he wasn’t rooting for
didn’t make sense, because it absolutely made a difference—they could make each other sick. Harry could make Malfoy sick, and the hex could activate before Malfoy found a cure, and what if there
Potter,
He’d dreamed of kissing Harry Potter once. He’d dreamed that the kiss was brutal and rough, a mixture of repressed desires and hidden shame, knowing that he wasn’t good enough for this and taking it anyway. There was still a hint of that now, as they carried the past into the future with them, and there was even a surprising amount of shame from Harry himself. It made Draco think of the small dark spaces in Harry’s dreams and all the things they didn’t know about each other.
“It’s really good to see—”
Draco didn’t need to imagine what that felt like.
Objectively, Potter was his best chance. He could always ask another Unspeakable, but even when he’d thought that his only option, he’d been hesitant. He’d worked with several Unspeakables before on smaller matters, and he never got along with them. They knew too much about him—or he felt like they did. No matter how essential it was that they remove their personal lives from their work, he’d never met one who could, not where he was concerned. He didn’t trust them to hold the spell. He didn’t trust them to anchor him without having that small moment of indecision, that one tiny moment where they looked at him and thought
“I’ve only ever wanted to be an Auror.”
“I bet this was your idea,” he said savagely, then he sniffed, a familiar scent catching his attention. “Is that… is that chocolate? Potter, where the hell did you get chocolate from?”
“You do care, don’t you?” Harry asks, incredulous.
Draco’s stomach pitched in relief that Potter was still normal underneath it all, although he did immediately wonder why he cared.
The sinking feeling grew, spreading cold fingers through Draco’s veins. He couldn’t say he was surprised, but Potter obviously wasn’t taking it with the same jaded dismissal that Draco had. Was this part of everything that was going on with Potter right now?
“Remember that stalker I had?” Potter answered distantly, peeking around the pillar and apparently deciding it was the perfect opportunity to run to the next one.
Malfoy smiled—a cold, rueful smile—and sipped his drink.
Draco turned to see Harry staring at the final hourglass on the mantle.
They set off down the path, bees buzzing around their heads as the garden flourished into spring. Hydrangeas bloomed along the wire garden dividers, and daisies sprouted amongst the stones of the path beneath their feet, defiant as they speckled the property with the least pure-blood flower Draco could imagine. He loved tending to the orchids, but daisies were his favourite.
Potter looked taken aback for a moment, but then his face closed off and he walked away without another word.
“Mate.” Ron reaches across the table and grasps Harry’s wrist, forcing him to look up. “We’ve been through this.”
“I don’t care about my bloody journal,” Draco said in a rush, before clutching his head in confusion. “How is this even possible? Not even twenty-four hours ago, I remember feeling such complete and utter betrayal at what you revealed to me, and yet, only a day before
He strolled down the shopping district, searching for a café he remembered from his time here. They’d made an exceptionally good cappuccino, and he was in dire need. Before long, he’d found it tucked away in a little corner of the street, and once he emerged with a steaming ceramic takeaway mug, he felt ready to tackle the day.
Draco turned away. It was no use getting involved in the argument. Smith was clearly sloshed, and the kid hadn’t meant any harm.
He ran back to his desk so fast, he almost stumbled. Malfoy startled, watching him go, but didn’t say anything as Harry rummaged through his instruments for the only one he hadn’t thought to try.
He stared at the pinboard for a while, trying to work out what he was making up for by undergoing this horrible entanglement with Potter. It couldn’t possibly be owed to Potter, could it? But then, how could it not? He had one more debt to pay after his one, and no reparations made to Harry Potter so far, which was a hilarious concept. Truly hysterical. As if Fate would ever let him off without paying his debt to Harry Potter.
Then, he turned around and pushed his way through the crowd to the front door. It was freezing outside, and a light snow had started to fall. Potter was nowhere in sight, but they had planned to meet back at Draco’s place, so that was no surprise. With only a small amount of trepidation, he turned on his heel and Apparated away.
Eleanor leaned back in her seat, getting comfortable. “Therapy is an ongoing process. It looks different for everyone, but that’s not to say that you were doing it
“Let’s get to work, then. Get it over with.”
This dream didn’t burst. Draco still felt like he was floating, drifting through the air in some kind of perfect haze, but his world was no longer narrowed to one man and all the problems that lay there with him. It expanded from Potter outwards and drew the whole world in.
He rounds the corner at the bottom of the stairs and finds Malfoy standing by the sink, looking at the dishes with a perplexed frown on his face. The fading sunlight barely makes it over the ridge of the window, sending scattered light across Malfoy’s face. The sharp shadows formed by the angles of his cheeks and nose compete with the more gentle shade of the leaves on the oak tree outside the window, and Harry can’t look away from the way it softens Malfoy’s features. Orange light glints through the glass, and he feels as though everything is caught in that moment of breath right before a sigh—the moment you allow yourself to relax.
Draco drew back and grinned. “What was that about?”
Malfoy pretended not to realise that Harry was watching but angled his face towards him all the same, allowing Harry to drink his fill of the sight. And when Harry turned away, he felt Malfoy’s eyes on him as well, saw Malfoy’s head tilt as his eyes traced a slow path down Harry’s body and up again. Something inside him shivered and ached for more, but he remembered what Malfoy had said and remained still. Somehow, that small decision to wait made it even more delicious—knowing that Malfoy wanted him, knowing that he wanted Malfoy right back, knowing that the two of them were building something together beneath these city lights.
Draco took a deep breath.
“Goodbye Potter.”
“Merlin,” Malfoy breathed. “Just like that—please—”
Harry’s heart stuttered, a rush of feeling overwhelming him with its unfamiliarity. In that eternal moment, he was volatile again, wild, everything he hadn’t felt in forever. He moaned, one hand reaching out to tangle in Malfoy’s hair as he did what he was told and thrust upward in slow, careful movements.
“I didn’t say I wasn’t interested.” He ran the tip of his quill idly across his chin as he studied Harry. “I’m just surprised you suggested it. Just to be clear—this is a convenient arrangement, nothing more?”
“What do you say, Malfoy? Want to get out of here?”
Something in Harry’s voice must have done what his words couldn't, because Malfoy stilled, looking from him to the Sneakoscope and back again. The Sneakoscope glowed faintly, and Malfoy carefully lowered his hands from the door.
The wizarding world, for all that he loves it, has always invaded his most private of spaces, and yet it never once tries to understand him. Every so often, it will find some piece of him that’s true—a photo or a quote—and it will take it and expose it for all the wizarding world to see. And that wizarding world, true to form, will completely fucking misunderstand it.
Balancing himself on the headboard, he leaned over and opened Draco’s bedside drawer to get the lube.
Pansy waved a hand dismissively, practically bouncing in her seat with excitement. “It was only confirmed this morning,” she gushed. “I’m hoping to Portkey everyone over to see it, but we’ll have to arrange the details closer to the time.”
He wanders down the beach, hitching his Transfigured shorts up around his waist and hoping they don’t turn back into a pillow before he’s returns to the hotel. There has been no word from Draco, and Harry is nervous to find out what happened after he left. He hopes Draco knows he wasn’t trying to leave him to deal with the problem alone; Harry was removing the problem altogether. And since the witches were there to see
“This is going to be brilliant,” Pansy enthused. “Please do try. I can’t wait to watch you attempt to make it look real.”
Directives were snarled, hexes thrown, Bellatrix’s wild hair whipping in a frenzy that punctuated every flash of hatred from her wand.
Draco had been seen in public with Potter before, but there was something different about this. Usually when they were seen together it was in a group. They would stand on either end of their strange collection of friends and shoot insults at each other over everyone’s heads. It was safe, normal, expected.
Draco didn’t mean to hunt down Granger; he was only heading to an appointment in the Ministry. Though, if he was forced to be honest with himself, he could admit he’d taken a small detour on his way there. Several small detours. Early.
“What did you want to be when you grew up?” Malfoy asked suddenly.
There was no change in Potter’s features, no flash of emotion anywhere to be seen. His face had closed off, the walls creeping up brick by brick until there was nothing of the man Draco knew left on the surface. Potter was meant to be fire, fury, and justice. Only a moment ago, he had been just that, but now… There was no sign of it.
A house-elf popped into existence beside the bed.
Harry has tested the product before. He knows they’re safe, knows that the daydreams are perfectly within your control—they only ever manifest a scenario you completely consent to—and, even better, he kept a few of the testers aside for private use before the new line is approved and released.
Draco ground his teeth together and fought not to give into stage two earlier than strictly necessary.
Green didn’t identify intent; it meant the curse’s will was done. It was as if they were in the throes of the curse itself, which was impossible because they were
“Right. I’m going to grab something to eat, then.” Potter left them at the table and headed towards the sandwich display.
Warm hands were running circles on Draco’s back. In front of him, Granger was arranging her coat around Potter, who still hadn’t moved. Her hands were shaking, and she kept stroking Potter’s hair tentatively, as if unsure whether or not she should be touching him.
“You think he has any left?”
Pansy’s fashion lines were renowned, not just on the catwalk but as pieces of art displayed across the world. She had investors lining up every other week for a piece of her pie, and Draco couldn’t be prouder of her.
Voices surrounded Draco as though in a fog.
“I know,” he says after a moment. “But, he’s Draco Malfoy, Ron. He’s used to glamorous parties and expensive holidays. I mean, the Prophet was open to the society and gossip pages; what if he’s bored of me? What if he misses the world I dragged him away from?”
“I got your owl,” Potter said, still in that same tentative voice he had used last time they met. “Are you sure about this? It seems a bit… rushed.”
Hogwarts. Since regret.
“Potter,” he said quietly, ignoring their surroundings when the scene shifted again.
Draco thought of chandeliers shattering, scratching his face as the meaning of Dobby’s words sank in.
Of course, Potter frowned at him and lifted the coffee pot with a questioning shake. “I didn’t know if you preferred tea or coffee,” he said slowly, sounding as confused as he no doubt felt, guided by the curse to play house with a Malfoy but internally resisting it as only a Potter could.
“And yet,” Malfoy said pointedly.
Just before it hits, his eyes fall on an empty sweet wrapper on the floor. It is innocuous enough—a brightly coloured square of plastic like any other—but Harry recognises it instantly. It matches the one in his shirt pocket, the one he can feel crinkling beneath his fingertips.
“Do you think of me?” Harry asked.
Then he realised what Potter had said.
A faintly terrible start.
He smiled at Malfoy, warmth rushing through him at the relieved smile Malfoy returned. “Me too,” he admitted, feeling like he had somehow confessed something far more intimate.
They both looked over at the box, but none of the wards had broken, and none of the diagnostics indicated anything had changed.
Through exploration, he learned Malfoy’s nipples weren’t incredibly erogenous zones, that he was ticklish, and that he had an incredibly sensitive spot at the base of his throat. He’d spent quite a lot of time at that last, massaging and revelling in the sounds Malfoy would give him in reward. Then he thought to use his mouth on it, and the sounds he got in response were entirely different. Bigger. Louder. Better. There were things he could do with his tongue that he couldn’t with just his fingers, and the way Malfoy went breathless when he started nipping at all the places he had discovered on his journey up made him believe the sensation was altogether different.
The grin on Potter’s face faltered. “We still don’t have a pen.”
“Finally acknowledging your dangerous volatility, then? Shall I sign you up for Alcoholics Anonymous next?” Draco smirked.
Eyes remaining fixed on his work as he added a passable recreation of the symbol, he nodded.
“Or you,” Potter said, something unreadable in his tone. He opened his mouth to say something else, but seemed to change his mind and shut it again without speaking. Eventually, he simply said. “When I get these feathers…” He trailed off.
“Merlin,” Draco breathed. “We don’t have time.”
Potter tipped his head back and laughed. “No no, nothing like that. Draco just wanted to know why I was making a right tit of myself running at a crouch over half the party.”
“In what way?”
I know that Hermione says I’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon or whatever, but honestly, have you met her? She Obliviated her parents and sent them to Australia! Don’t get me wrong: I love her to bits, and that was definitely the right thing to do. But… I couldn’t have done it.
Except it wasn’t that easy. The gritty cloud of his mind was agitated, restless with unease. Something else was looming.
was would be lost. Somehow, he knew that if he let him, Malfoy would shutter himself away.
“It is,” Harry agreed, taking the hint and allowing them both to sink back into the tentative camaraderie they had been building.
Eventually, Potter turned to him. His eyes were still faintly unseeing, like a sheet of muted glass had dropped between them, but he was closer now. Draco thought that if he reached out, Potter would feel solid beneath his fingertips. He hadn’t thought that before.
But Draco was watching him with a fierce resolution, his body simultaneously relaxed and full of new tension, and Harry knew that he had made up his mind.
She sniffed in response.
The room felt colder than normal, but Draco engaged every ounce of self-control to make sure his sudden fear didn’t show. He curved his lips into a smile, though he was sure it must look all wrong.
George grimaced. “As much as we can at the moment.”
Harry lets himself be soothed by the gentle words they whisper to each other and just sinks into his lover’s arms. Soon he is surrounded by the smell, the sound, the warmth of Draco, and it’s exactly where he’s meant to be.
Harry chokes a little on his own spit and clears his throat, feeling more wrong-footed by the second. “Um. I’m Harry Potter?”
“I don’t understand, Draco.”
After a few seconds of frozen horror, Draco turned and punched the wall. It crunched satisfyingly beneath his knuckles, leaving a small indent of his strength behind. The skin was instantly grazed and bleeding, and Draco stared at it numbly, unable to reconcile the sensations flooding him because he couldn’t remember anything that had just happened, at least, not before he’d apparently ruined everything.
“I’m sorry, let’s backtrack for a second. You did what?”
“I have to go,” she said, and it was like listening to an icy stream pouring down the side of a mountain.
Tell me how your treasure hunt goes.
“No, I really think I do.”
You can imagine how Ron and Hermione would react to that. It’s wonderful to have friends, but there are some things you just can’t tell them.
Occasionally, blue flame would flicker in Potter’s eyes, and Draco realised with mounting horror that, amongst the second great wizarding war, he was courting the Boy Who Lived. He hoped Potter didn’t notice, and that he didn’t notice the claws that raked across a Death Eater’s face when they were attacked at Hogwarts with the full moon high above them—not a harvest moon, but close enough for his frazzled nerves. And he hoped Potter didn’t notice the protective blue flame that followed them through the Fiendfyre Vincent unleashed, burning high on the fuel of Draco’s fear.
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed how you look at him lately,” she said finally. “It’s like you’ve never seen him before, even in the six years we’ve all been friends.”
“No need,” Draco said, standing up straight and ignoring the way the Aurors’ eyes raked all over his dishevelled appearance in surprise. “I’ll take the case.”
Draco sighed, and then forced himself to ask what he really didn’t want to ask. “You do know that the Veela Curse doesn’t usually bind the wizard to the territorial Veela, don’t you, Potter? It chooses another.”
“The wards are designed to keep unwanted people out, though,” he said quietly. “Their spells get reflected back before they ever reach your internal wards, and since they’re essentially impervious to magic, it makes the wards doubly hard to disentangle if you don’t know where the entry point is. You won’t have to worry about the pranks getting worse or becoming something more than just what kids do on a Friday night.”
Draco tried to focus on the words, but he was too far away. All he could hear was laughter, and it made him grit his teeth and nearly walk out the door. He managed to stop himself and instead walked closer to the counter, pretending to eye some enchanted pigmy puff toys.
sharing a room,” she stated, though it sounded more like a question with the way her voice went high at the end.
Draco led the way to the artfully arranged seating in the corner and settled back to survey the room. Something about Hannah’s reaction was bothering Draco, but he couldn’t put his finger on what the issue was. In lieu of an answer, he propped his chin on his hand and studied Potter, taking in the harsh lines of his face—how they seemed so much starker than they had in his youth—and the way his eyes skittered between the door and windows and back again.
His candor took Harry by surprise, making him swallow the sharp retort he had ready. There was a dull look in Malfoy’s eyes as he stared ahead at the undulating crowd that was all too familiar; Harry had seen it in the mirror often enough.
wrong, and there were times when you could have made a better decision, but you did all you could with the information that was available to you.”
“Several times this month, I’m sure. What in particular have you done that has caused this latest wave of melancholy?”
“They’re here now, and it didn’t make a difference to me.”
“Am I going to like it?”
Love, Luna
That had surprised a laugh out of him when, really, it should have made him angry.
“Can I touch you?” Malfoy breathed, his usually aristocratic tones already broken and ragged.
“And I’m beating you,” Malfoy pointed out.
“Binky,” he murmured, snapping his fingers lazily.
“Just say the word.”
Draco pocketed the vial and checked the time. “There. Still ages until dinner. We could go and check in with Professor Slughorn, or…” he trailed off.
A shiver of foreboding ran down Harry’s spine. “What?”
He shoved his hands in his pockets, eyes fixed on the slowly rotating symbol that pulsed with a golden light.
“I did say that, yes.”
Harry turned to him and smiled.
Before he had the chance to respond, Draco was tucking his icy feet between Harry’s thighs. Harry shouted in alarm and tried to move away, but Draco wrapped his arms around his torso and forced him to take it. Finally, after a great deal of struggle to no avail, Harry laid still and accepted his fate.
They came to stand on either side of the box, on the rim of the protective circle.
“Pansy wants a pub night,” he said, standing and retrieving his clothes from where his spell had Vanished them. “She closed a major deal today and wants to celebrate.”
The problem was that none of those things were an act. Potter simply lived and breathed chivalry, even to someone like Draco. It didn’t mean anything, but he could see on the watchful, curious faces how much they thought it did. He was sure his own face revealed far too much of how much he wished it was.
This is unbearable.
you always get the creeps, though?” Weasley mused, his tone serious for once. “I mean, look at you. You’re a bloody catch. Smart, fit, saviour of the wizarding world; is it too much to ask that someone decent asks you out?”
Draco laughed. “Potter, I don’t think you understand. It’s a fragile, delicate piece of, quite frankly, hugely experimental magic. I need a trained professional who—”
Potter slid his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, pulling it free from his trousers before drawing Draco’s tailored jacket slowly back down his arms. Draco heard the sound of fabric being folded and slung over the rail of the balcony, and then Potter’s hands returned to his skin, moving around to his front and undoing his trousers button by button.
A thought that made no sense occurred to him: that the curse may not have shown him a future he could not have after all, and that maybe all he needed to do was trust and choose.
Mind Healer Scottsbury had long since drilled into Draco’s head that humour as a coping mechanism was rarely acceptable if one was in company, and yet it still took all of Draco’s willpower not to make a dick joke. Not that Potter would likely have noticed; the man was barely coherent. Draco set to work making the living room habitable for the infirm, lighting a fire with his wand and setting the kettle boiling and an all-purpose tincture pouring with a few more well-placed flicks. He had no idea what Potter had done to himself, but if he’d come
This time Harry didn’t bother to hold back his groan. He set his glass down on a coaster—roughly hewn wood carved by a Muggle woman in Surrey—slid his hands into his jeans, palmed his hard cock, and began to stroke.
“Weird good or weird bad?” He finally drew his eyes away from where Malfoy was clenching down on him, little spasms that felt incredibly odd.
He realises that if he had looked closer at Draco instead of getting caught up in his own head, maybe he could have seen it coming. Maybe he wouldn’t have missed the insecurity that he should have known was there. But his own fears prevented him from that—fears that Draco had no way of predicting. He draws Draco closer and decides that it’s time he let Draco in on them, before they find themselves in another mess like this.
“It’s okay. You can ask.”
His heart thudded, reminding him that, as of thirty minutes ago, this was no longer true.
Draco snorted. “Is that what you call it?”
Draco snickered into his wine, and just like that the soreness of Ron’s coma had passed. They settled into safer topics—the shop, Draco’s work overseas. Draco found himself enjoying both the wine and the company far more than he had expected, and by the time he was ready to go he was surprised to find the last patrons were leaving as well.
“You know what?” Draco said tiredly. “We need one more thing: a drink.”
He remembered them, and then he shoved them far away.
Potter cleared his throat. “
When Draco looked over at Evie, her whole body had collapsed against the barrier with relief, a huge smile on her face.
“No, you bloody haven’t!” Morgan yelled back. “Just give me the box and I’ll let him out back home. I told you not to come near me, Christ, I knew it was going to end up like this somehow.”
He allowed himself to be pulled down to the floor, dropping to his knees, held up by a slow kiss and the sensation of strong hands sliding down and gripping his arse.
“So,” Malfoy agrees.
“Is that all right?” Malfoy asked softly, his wand still hovering in case Harry wanted him to undo it.
He took a deep breath.
His eyes met Potter’s in the mirror as he said that last word, and he immediately saw both understanding and surprise reflected there.
Draco leaned back in his chair, drumming his fingers on the table in front of him. “So, after snooping here for Merlin knows how many hours—days?—you now request my permission to collect feathers from my peafowl, conduct some spell no doubt also on my property, and engage with the Veela who hates you so much they have submitted you for execution. Is that the summary?”
“It’s a lot,” he echoed Draco’s earlier words, suddenly coming to the realisation of what it was like to be on the opposite end. It didn’t feel bad or hurt, it was just… unusual. Different than having fingers inside himself.
“It’s nice out here,” Draco lied, clenching his knuckles against the frost of the wind.
Malfoy’s voice is softer now, gentle with tones of affection that Harry has never heard from him before. He closes his eyes and feels every fibre in him reaching for the sound, propelling him forward to the owner of the voice.
“Well, Potter, it would appear our charming acquaintances have such a low opinion of our intelligence that they think we would attempt such a gauche act.” He turned to Potter and had to fight back a laugh at the narrowed eyes that met him.
Draco wasn’t sure he’d ever forget the moment Ron Weasley had taken him aside one night, nearly six months ago, and hugged him. They hadn’t needed words. Draco knew that Harry was smiling more lately, that Ron’s owls were being returned with long letters in reply. He knew that they were seeing more of each other than they had in years, and the stilted conversation he had witnessed in the hospital so long ago had become a distant memory. He had tried to tell Ron that he hadn’t done anything, but Ron had just told him to shut up and accept the gratitude, so he’d simply smiled and nodded. Maybe he did speak Gryffindor after all.
Without even meaning to, he was reaching towards Potter, some part of him aching to console the broken man before him. What had happened in the last few minutes to lead to
Draco glanced at Potter, mulling it over, and decided there was no point keeping it secret. “Blaise is the only other person who knows about me,” he explained to Potter, throwing him a bone by dropping Blaise’s name in. He turned back to Blaise. “Potter trespassed while I was sleeping and set off the Veela Curse.”
The warmth in Draco’s chest grew. “And the curse is over now?”
. Someone who had wronged him so very, very deeply.
When he felt Potter grow hesitant, pulling back with a question in his eyes, Draco gave himself over to the sensation. He reached for Potter’s shoulders, gripping them almost like he was about to shake reason into him, and pulled him into a kiss so violently they nearly head-butted. Potter laughed against his mouth, surprise and pleasure and desire all wrapped up in one small, breathy sound.
“Er,” he said, trying to think how to ask and feeling his cheeks flame at the realisation of just how stupid he’d been.
so many times, he’d all but memorised the text by that point.
He meant had something happened with Ron, but another meaning popped into his mind and his face suddenly flamed. Potter’s cheeks turned pink, and Draco wondered if it was too much to ask that the dream-state open up a pit for him to crawl into and die.
But it was impossible.
“’Fraid not.”
Slowly, an image creeps into his mind. Draco’s face falling in disappointment. Draco looking hurt.
In the quiet of his apartment that night, he felt a lingering sadness at the thought of Potter all alone across the sea. He hoped Potter chose to listen to him, to seek help, but he also knew that it could take years. It had taken Draco himself this long to be ready, willing, and able, and he’d started with a desperate need to feel anything different to how he always felt. It hadn’t been enough, and he wasn’t sure that Potter even had that.
“It’s not that bad,” he said. “I mean, you’ve got kind of a biased view, Ron, you gotta admit.”
“Good.”
One thing Draco did know was that their time was running out, and if the curse managed to properly identify them as intruders, it would all be over.
“Yes, thanks,” Potter replied.
“What’s the next step, then?” Draco asked once they’d clinked their glasses together.
With that, the mystery of how Potter had remained so silent for the last ten minutes was revealed as his Patronus scampered back into the room, whispered something into his ear, and disappeared. Then, he caught Draco around the middle and Apparated them straight to Kalen O'Fearadhaigh’s address.
Potter glared at him, and Draco forced himself to remain quiet lest he ruin this momentous occasion.
“You know I wanted you so much I actually started to smile when I thought of those stupid badges?” Harry said conversationally.
“Why don’t I?”
“I honestly don’t know, Potter,” Draco admitted. “Morgan made it sound as if it was the Fair Folk behind this curse, but why would they use symbols designed to trap and ensnare them?”
“Something like that.”
When they finally arrived in Draco’s foyer, he took a deep breath and stepped backwards.
P.S. do… do you want some perfume?
“We don’t have much time,” Draco protested.
Draco shot him a wounded look as he uncorked the lube and emptied it onto his hand.
He looked up to see Malfoy waving his goblet at Harry, one eyebrow raised as he stared pointedly at Harry’s own glass. Confused, Harry picked up his own goblet on reflex, holding it out for the bizarre toast Malfoy appeared to be giving him.
He’d written exactly one letter to Potter and received one in response. He’d asked Potter to meet him at the lake on Saturday, and Potter had said yes.
Hermione,
In a deathly calm voice, Potter asked, “You didn’t bring a pen, did you?”
“Oh.” Potter cast an uncertain glance in Draco’s direction, and Draco felt his stomach flip. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re good.”
“No. I’m not getting you a drink. Unless it’s water; would you like a glass of water, Draco?”
He took a glance at the open bottle of scotch he’d left behind and the bottles of wine in their rack on the kitchen bench. With a flick of his wand, he sent them all sailing into the liquor cabinet. He locked it and threw the key behind the armoire. He needed to focus; there was no time to get smashed, however tempting it might be.
“Oh,” he sighed. “Is this what you’re like after sex?”
Why had he thought its disappearance was a good thing?
A thrill of hot desire coursed through Draco’s stomach. Merlin, he wanted to. But… something wasn’t right. He didn’t like how quickly Potter had shifted from elation to cynicism to desire.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy’s dramatics.
to create a barrier that made his cock glitter faintly. Grinning shakily at Draco, he retrieved the vial and slicked himself up.
