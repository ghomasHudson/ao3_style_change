Harry shrugged. “You could just pack it all up and take it somewhere else.”
“Obviously,” Draco said. “But I also had a job to keep and a reputation to protect. The Ministry doesn’t need an excuse for giving me the shit cases; do you think fucking their Saviour would put me in any higher regard? I wasn’t about to make a play for you and jeopardise not only my career, but my family’s safety if you reacted badly to it.”
. That’s like the biggest idiosyncrasy of all.”
Draco was on the precipice, wavering between two directions, and Harry could see him leaning away, choosing the safer path, but Harry had never liked safe, and he was a terrible person for not wanting Draco to take it either. He leaned forward, and grabbed Draco’s hand.
He buys some coffees from another vendor and returns to the office. He sits the first coffee on Fievel’s desk and she looks so surprised and so grateful that it makes Harry’s belly warm and he gives her a smile, even though he’s feeling pretty run dry. He drops the other coffees under a warming charm in the breakroom and lets the Aurors in residence find them for themselves, first come first served.
“Thank you, Hermione,” says Malfoy.
Harry pulled him closer to his body. Hermione was crying all over Draco’s face as she breathed into his mouth, and she hadn’t even cried over her parents. Not until she’d nearly got them back again, anyway.
Padma and Nott looked at one another. They looked back at Harry and Hermione, and said simultaneously: “Volcanoes.”
“Please bring us some hydromeli and figs, Galene.”
That was all it took. Draco arched shamelessly, moaning loudly; hot liquid splashed against Harry’s belly. He clenched his abs, startled and aroused by the feeling of it. Fuck, but Draco was hot when he lost it. He watched it all play out, feeling like he’d just experienced something far greater than orgasm.
wasn’t the right term for it. It was more that he
Harry wondered if Petunia knew…if it would be kinder to tell her or not.
“I haven’t spent a great deal of time in the magical world over the last seven years,” Harry reminded him.
The quiet became tense, and Harry stood to find Ron and Hermione communicating silently. “What?”
Draco gave him a nod in return. Potter followed, and Draco tried not to get annoyed at the brighter smile Piers gave him. It really wasn’t the time to be jealous and anyway, Potter was too dazed to even notice. Once they were all ashore, Draco led them through the ruins of the Queen’s garden into her receiving room.
but was too chickenshit to actually say it.
Ginny, one of six acceptable Weasleys—the only outlier being Ronald—craned her neck to take in the scene. An Alopekis, which Draco had thought was extinct in this form, was apparently conversing, through yips, with a fisherman returning from sea. The fisherman listened attentively, nodded, and handed the dog a single fish.
Harry forced himself to smirk, gestured magnanimously, even though his heart was beating faster than a snitch’s wings. “Don’t let me stop you, then.”
Downstairs, Lavender was pouring Mr Weasley some tea with her wand while instructing Mrs Weasley on how to make homemade phyllo pastry. Harry and Hermione took their usual seats at the awkward end of the table, and watched, feeling equally inadequate.
Malfoy kissed him desperately, his hands coming up to Harry’s face and grabbing hold on either side. Harry groaned into his mouth. He moved his hips, grinding against Malfoy’s, and Malfoy moaned. Their ankles tangled together, hooking as if to never let go.
“Poetic metaphor,” Draco finishes. “Yes, dear, we know.”
Draco did so, but made sure everyone knew he was furious about the whole thing. The angrier Draco got, the quieter he got. And he was practically breathing the words by this point. A shield charm flew up between Harry’s outstretched hands and the two men.
The reporter cocked her head. “You believe your reputation will be ruined after today?”
“Be grate—” Harry cut off, gasping. Well, this certainly felt familiar. He could barely breathe, his magic felt like it was being scraped out of him. “Shit, I think they’re trying to dismantle the ward.”
“So things haven’t got any better, I take it,” he finally said.
. All those people there in that stadium, watching this football game—they’ve got to know.”
Harry was incurably in love with Draco Malfoy, and it was the most awful thing in the entire world, but he was happy anyway. He had potions, and explosions, and two/three really great best friends, and Draco turned to him first when he had something witty to say at tea in the staff room. Love, Harry figured, didn’t have to be returned to be brilliant.
She cleared her throat. “Mr Potter,” she said at last. Harry blinked. He felt Draco’s tendons stiffen beneath his hand. “Your experiment nearly killed my son.”
They all turned to look at him. He crossed his arms, gingerly, and stared them down. Finally, Pomfrey exhaled in a rush of air, and removed her hands from her hips long enough to set his wrist. It snapped, literally, back into place, and Harry managed to withhold everything but his initial yelp of surprise, but
Harry snorted. “Do I look that stupid to you?”
. Probably painfully. I can’t say that I ever had reason to confirm that theory, but it is an
She blinks at him. “It’s in Lebanon.”
“Thank you, Your Dignity. Yes, that phrase brings us cleanly to the reason of our arriving,” spoke one of the Ministry officials in a painfully jarring broken Greek.
Music began to play and the Prime Minister ascended the stage to wild applause. She smiled and waved, pandering professionally to the crowd.
?!” said Narcissa.
Harry stopped dead in the doorway. “What?” he said. “How?” He rushed forward again, snatching up Teddy’s misshapen unicorn colouring. “What did you do?”
“Well, we could just shut down their machines and force them to use the other options,” Anthony said.
Potter didn’t even deign to look at him. Draco’s estimation rose further still.
Harry throws himself down on the couch. This is not going at all like he intended for it to go, although now that he gives it some thought, he doesn’t know exactly what he intended. He just knows it wasn’t this. “You’re my healer,” Harry says quietly.
“Right,” said Harry, nodding vigorously. They had
It wasn’t difficult at all to identify his three potions (1, 2, and 6), nor was it difficult to know what to say. He’d worked so much with them lately that he rather thought he’d have too much to say. Hermione would be amused. And vindicated, most likely.
Was this blank force magic to Muggles?
He’s never been closer to anyone in his entire life than he was to Malfoy by the end of their partnership. And he’s known since that Potions class in eighth year that having Malfoy in his life is like some sort of strange, counterproductive requirement for continued existence. How’d he go all those years before Malfoy? How’d he make it through those close encounters alive? It’s never been a matter of skill in living—Harry’s got plenty of that—it’s more that he’d never really understood what the point of life was. Harry’s always lived for a purpose; when he was little, it was for the fantasies in his head of a better life; when he was in school, it was destroying his parents’ murderer, and nowadays, it’s Malfoy. The thing about living for Malfoy is that it doesn’t require any sort of action, like living for Voldemort did; it just needs Malfoy.
It was here, a week before Christmas, that Harry realised his platonic marriage to Ron was never in danger at all, it was just that there’d been a different sort of piece missing, one that Ron couldn’t ever fill, and Harry needed both him
Harry scowls, suddenly annoyed that she’d figured this out ages ago when it only hit him while having sex with a woman. Ron stammers out a hopeful, ‘Are you
Harry bit his lip, eyed the little blue ghosts. “Like what?”
Draco’s hands found his bum, pulled his hips in closer. Harry moaned into his mouth as delicious little tingles travelled over his body. And then Draco’s hands were moving down, inwards, scrabbling at the button of his fly. Harry lifted his hips to help him, and by Merlin, Draco was a talented fuck, because he had Harry’s fly open, zip down, and jeans pushed halfway down his thighs before Harry even realised what was going on.
They sit in silence for a long while. Malfoy won’t look up and Harry can’t talk to him if he doesn’t. He drinks his tea and tries not to notice how uncomfortably it settles in his stomach. He wishes Malfoy would take off those glasses. It makes everything feel so much more intimate than it really is, and while there’s a new part of Harry that desperately wants that intimacy, there’s a whole other part of him that wouldn’t know what to do with it if he had it.
“The last ice age ended 11,700 years ago,” said Draco. “Very close to when Atlantis disappeared.”
“Mischief?” Harry repeated. He was beginning to wonder about the Wizarding World’s use of words, but perhaps he’d just been out of Britain too long. “Er, good to see you, too, Headmistress.”
Luna nodded sagely, taking a long sip of her pineapple juice and coffee blend. Harry tried not to sick up in his own mouth. “I do understand, Harry. Perhaps you should speak to Professor Snape. He always seems to bring you back from the very edge of despair.”
.” He waggled his eyebrows again.
Harry didn’t either, frankly, because he wasn’t entirely sure he knew what Draco was talking about. It could have been any number of things; but there was just one thing he hoped it referred to, and he couldn’t bring himself to be selfish enough to broach the topic now.
Malfoy sat back in his chair, thinking. After a moment, he said, “Is this bad?”
Malfoy smirked, but refrained, thank Merlin, from making a comment on Ron’s financial standings. “All right, Potter. You can be my Mill, but I assure you, the entry fee for
The cat hissed angrily, and Harry quite suddenly realised that—Hermione was on his couch. And she wasn’t pleased about it. He turned to Millicent. “Is that—?”
. How was it that soft, sweet little Hufflepuffs could tell you they’d be your friend forever one moment, and then break out into cackles the next, when Malfoy made a joke about Professor Trelawney’s hair resembling one of the plants climbing the common room wall?
, he writes, shrugging.
“Both, but the chlorine was rather high,” Harry said. “Makes you wonder what diseased thing keeps getting into their water that they have to dump so much bleach into it.”
“Actually, me neither,” Lee added. “I’m not really the renegade type, the War notwithstanding. So it’d be great if you kept the impetuous cliff-leaping to a minimum from here out.”
She gave him a look as her fingers closed around it. “I know that I came here specifically to take one of the twenty-four slots, but I didn’t intend for you to actually keep giving me Snitches,” she said. “I know that I’ve said—things—about this programme, but you really should consider dating again.” She grimaced. “Even if you’re being filmed doing it.”
Harry nodded, though that didn’t explain things any further at all. “It felt disgusting,” he whispered. “That shock. It felt like looking at something revolting. The nauseous feeling Tracey had...I bet it was from that.”
our wands would make it a lot stronger.”
Was Hermione in danger?
Overwhelmed by the suddenness of her mood swing, he was unprepared for Hermione throwing her arms around his neck and thereby tackling him to the floor. She sat above him, seemingly unaware that they were now on the floor of the Great Hall and in full view of the impressionable students staring at the head table.
“Oh,” said Harry, softly. He furrowed his brow, feeling wrong-footed. Swallowing, he said, “How do I represent love?”
“Am I getting booked anytime soon?” Harry asked between bites.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Yes, Malfoy,” he said patiently. “I’m not stupid, just lazy.”
The next day, Harry went to the Ravenclaw table before Hermione could sneak out, and said, “Anthony Goldstein says I’m bisexual.”
“Yeah, have been since you laid down on me. Your head is heavy, imagine that.”
“Of course, Headmistress,” Draco said, and he was already up the stairs and disappearing into the castle for McGonagall’s office before Harry even blinked.
Then the Portkey activated. It was a smoother trip this time, and Harry was only a little unsettled when they landed at the International Portkey Arrivals dais at JFK airport. Despite all the holiday travel, they were able to make good time exiting security and finding the Arrivals pick-up spot.
go talk to the goblins.”
“Doesn’t it?” said Luna, excitedly. “If your series goes well, I think we can get renewed for at least three more, so be sure to be exciting.”
Merlin, it was indecent how she curved. She looked mean and vaguely foreign, and then Harry realised the xenophobia the Dursleys bred into him was showing its arse and he decided she looked striking instead. She was staring at them with a particular look, and it made Harry uncomfortable.
Malfoy beams at him. “Lovely. After work then?”
possible.
“Never seen such luxury, have you, Potter? You must be overwhelmed.”
, and Malfoy obliged him, sliding his finger in and out, in and out, in the most insidiously slow way, rubbing over Harry’s prostate. Malfoy was watching his face, his eyes flickering as he took in each of Harry’s responses and reacting to them. When Harry’s back arched, Malfoy pressed harder; when his chest heaved, he rubbed harder. Harry wasn’t even sure when he’d managed to get three fingers inside him, but he was delirious from the pleasure of it.
, he thought to himself. But it was better than freaking out.
Malfoy tended to grab his dinner and take it back to the common room, which had always been great in Harry’s opinion since he didn’t have to share a table with him, but now he wondered what it would be like to be around him, play Snap with him, talk Quidditch with him.
“Astoria has him for the rest of the week, which works out now I have to deal with this…thing.”
“I don’t know,” she said. “He needs St Mungo’s for a full check-up, but I don’t see anything immediately alarming.”
Petunia’s eyes narrowed fractionally. “I don’t think it’s my place to expose him at a time so fraught.” Then, she looked right at the camera and said, “I would hope he has the opportunity to do something good, without my undoubtedly shredded reputation after this interview hindering him.”
“Have you heard anything from the ICW?” asked Harry, after they’d giggled enough. “It’s been nearly a week since we visited, and I find it really hard to believe that they just decided to let the Queen’s dismissal go.”
She passed the folders to them, and they each took them without a word. Harry because he was too tired to care, and probably the same for the other two.
“Doubtful,” Draco said, with some disappointment. “But he had that look on his face when he was working on it, like you do now. That cataloguing look.”
They went to sit on the long bench, though there were far too many of them to all fit. Draco managed to secure a spot before the rush, and Potter sat next to him. Draco smiled blandly at the Ministry witch glaring at him, who’d not been fast enough to secure a seat.
“Yeah. My wrist is broken, though.”
. Harry doesn’t know
Harry briefly considered the horror it would be to accidentally Polyjuice into a crocodile. But, well—Gryffindor. In answer, Harry uncapped Flask 1, and tipped it back.
Potter grabbed on, his fingers, bared at the tips in his gloves, touching Draco’s knuckles around the shell and sending a strange shiver down his torso. The Portkey activated and they were swept away. They didn’t spin; it felt like he was being dragged backwards at great speed, his hair blowing across his eyes and his clothing pulling away, until they came to an abrupt stop.
Draco smiled at her from somewhere behind his mother’s hair. “Me too, Headmistress.”
you,” Harry said, and immediately wanted to kick himself for how Hogwartsian it sounded.
Draco swallowed. “Second time I’ve nearly drowned.”
And with that, McGonagall snatched the Hat from his head. Harry stumbled down from the dais as if he were weightless. He floated over to the Hufflepuff table and took a seat next to Hannah Abbott in a daze. And then, his face split into a grin. It wasn’t Gryffindor, but it also wasn’t Slytherin. He breathed a sigh of relief, and helped himself to some pudding, which tasted a little weird. He suddenly had an appetite again, and since Ron wasn’t at this table, there was food left.
“I wish I had a portrait of Professor Flitwick to carry around,” Luna said. “He’s rather handsome, isn’t he? But he isn’t dead, so it wouldn’t work anyway. It’s okay, since he’s very easy to find when I have questions about my projects.”
“Nothing,” they said.
Malfoy smiled. “You will,” he said.
“I will be, love.” His voice was so quiet, Harry wasn’t sure if he’d imagined it. “I’ll be fine when I see you again. Running on adrenaline right now.”
like him.”
“Potter, I told you—” Draco begins, as Harry passes him.
“What about the tsunami, though?” asked another, through a Translation Charm. “That will happen regardless.”
He slept fitfully all night, despite the overwhelming fatigue.
“Bit weird the first few times,” he said. “You get used to the movement.”
“He saw?” Harry asked, but that was stupid because
He disappeared from the frame and Harry turned to Draco, beaming. “He’s going to do it.”
way I come,” Harry reminded him.
He shrugs.
Draco quirked a grin at him over his shoulder. “Come here,” he said softly.
Harry choked again, and it came out as a sob. He fell down next to Draco and pressed his ear to his mouth. God, he
Draco loved him.
He bent down, engulfing Harry’s prick in his mouth. Harry arched up, gasping. Malfoy groaned around his cock, and then Harry felt two fingers pumping inside of him, making sure he was ready. They retreated, leaving Harry feeling empty, but then he opened his eyes to find Malfoy leaning over him, reaching for the Zwei on the bedside table.
On Thursday morning, Harry woke with a new resolve. Together, the Hufflepuffs could fix this thing; he was certain of it. There were two books on chemistry that he found to be written in a magically-raised friendly language (read: simplistic explanations of natural and synthetic chemicals) and robust enough to give them a thorough understanding – all under 150 pages.
It worked. “Wallabies, really?” he said. He’d never seen a wallaby.
“Calm down,” said Harry. “At least you know your hypothesis is correct.” He reached out to pet her on the head, but drew his hand back quickly when she began a low, ominous growl. Of
Harry shook his head. “Sounds…right.”
“I knew it would be bad,” Petunia said. “But knowing it and living it are two different things. Tea?”
Harry shrugged. “Dunno, but she’s the Magical Beings and Creatures expert, so she must be right.” He held up the tank and peered in at Seabiscuit. “Ready to return to the wild, Bikki?”
“Going
“And the
“Come in, quickly, quickly,” she hissed.
When she left, Harry was shuddering. He glanced up from his place on Luna’s indigo patchwork settee and gave Malfoy a tight smile. Malfoy, who was sitting in Gin’s favourite chair, one leg crossed wide over the other, hands steepled before him like he’d been watching Sherlock on BBC.
“Oh,” said Harry. He could understand that, the discomfort of being around people you weren’t sure of.
“No, probably not,” she said, laughing.
Actually, now that he was doing it, he really had no idea whatsoever how to ask Malfoy for help. It wasn’t like they were
’ The magazine’s spine was bent open in the middle of the article, as if it had sat that way for a year and a half.
He rolls out of bed and is in the shower before Harry can even respond, so Harry just sinks back into Draco’s bed and snoozes for a little while. They always stagger their entrance times after a night together to avoid suspicion. The non-fraternisation policy within Ministry departments is even more severe in the Department of Mysteries. The inherent dangers in their research make it imperative that no flyaway emotions are fogging up their auras or working environments, and Harry already struggles with flyaway emotions anyway. With Harry, flyaway emotions are already trouble enough.
Malfoy blinked his eyes open. They looked softer than usual, lacking the spark they’d always held. He was still Malfoy, but Harry had never before realised what Malfoy would be like without magic in his veins, without that clean eucalyptus smell lingering in his wake.
“Being Hufflepuff is great,” said Anthony. “You get to read about what you want without anyone judging you for having loads of books on the forgotten princesses of Eastern Europe.” All three of them turned to stare at Anthony. He daintily licked his finger and turned another page, ignoring them.
what he wanted to think about with Millicent staring beadily at him and Hermione on his lap, claws millimetres from embedding in his upper thigh.
“Ron,” Harry whined, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. “Never travel trans-Atlantic during hurricane season.”
“Mrs Dursley, you’re also known online by the username ‘purplehybrids,’ is that correct?”
things. I’m more of a
we’ve been friends.”
Harry’s heart stuttered in his chest when he came across one story from a woman in Idaho who had experienced abductions
Harry nodded frantically. “Yeah, yeah. So ready.”
Sometimes he replayed that moment in his head, and tried to figure out if the ghost memories of Malfoy’s fingertips pressing against his sides were real or imagined. It felt like everything between them had lead to that one moment, that their entire history was distilled into the sound of Malfoy panicking against Harry’s neck.
He looked so regal sitting straight against the royal blue upholstery, his white-blond hair contrasted against the cotton. For the first time, Harry wondered what it would have been like to spend evenings in a common room with him at Hogwarts, what he and Astoria had talked about during spare few months of their marriage, when they’d been young enough to not be exhausted all the time.
“Tell me what you’re thinking,” Harry insists.
“Hey, man,” said Lee, stepping inside as if he came over to Malfoy’s all the time.
Snape waved a hand, dismissing the argument and probably Harry’s existence, as well. “And yet I somehow managed to develop and maintain a vocation prior to it. How very Potter-esque of you to make every effort at becoming a man of leisure. Your father will be proud, of course.”
She beamed. “Now we just need to figure out what chemical is causing the samples to steal atmospheric magic.”
“That’s what I’m saying,” said Hermione. She glanced up at Headmistress McGonagall at the Head Table, who was deep in conversation with Professor Orkney. “McGonagall must’ve been able to see this all so clearly. She teaches all of us, so she would’ve noticed the trends in her classes. She wasn’t isolated from the other houses like us.”
“After Mr Potter is sorted, he will join his new house for the remainder of dinner. We will thence go in alphabetical order until each and every seventh and eighth year student has been re-sorted.”
of your magic, instead of just a little bit. Imagine losing so much you couldn't regenerate any of it.”
But eventually, they were done. The oysters were settled, and that was all they could do for now. They Apparated back to the Rover, casting several more cleaning spells over themselves and in their mouths and noses, and in the girls’ cases—their nether regions as well. Harry did not blame them. They still laid towels down on the seats before hopping back in the Rover.
He turned around, found Potter watching him intently. Malfoy swallowed, kept talking, too excited to shut up.
Fuck, this was going to suck.
Hermione grinned at him. “Alright Harry. The Ravenclaws and I wanted to study the flowers more tonight anyway. See you later.”
For a moment, Draco could only stare at him, keep his eyes wide open and try to make sense of what was right in front of him.
Grey eyes searched his, and then Malfoy drew him forward.
, he mouthed and nodded at Draco.
He stood quickly and pivoted, trying to catch another glimpse of him. Draco didn’t hear anything except the high-pitched ringing in his ears. Ignoring his classmates, Draco hurried forward, his eyes scanning the rafters.
dying.”
Harry contemplates lying for a second, but only a second. "Kind of."
The mediwitch then folded her arms as if hugging herself. She walked closer to Draco, whose heart was now beginning to thud with achy pain again.
Yearning swam through him, just at the sound of his name. He wished Harry was really here, that he would come back. Maybe then he wouldn’t hurt so much.
In the absolute silence that overtook the room after, his voice was so clear, whispering, "Draco."
that it made everything around it dull and lifeless in comparison.
Harry was doing nothing except shaking his head and putting distance between him. His face looked panicked, like Draco had done something that had scared him.  Draco came closer to him, his hand reaching out. He realised that Harry was saying something, repeating it every few steps, his eyes glazed.
"It’s," Harry’s eyes flicked back to Malfoy, then he turned back to his desk mortified. "Nothing – no."
Draco saw Potter still sitting on the bed then. His head was in his hands, and he was curled in on himself. Potter had his eyes closed as if he was in pain.
Potter bit his lip. It was trembling as were his fists. The defeated look Potter gave him clued Draco into how he must have looked then; a man who was ready to burn.
When he came to, Draco was vaguely aware that there had just been a potions blast and that he’d caused it. He heard the moans and griping of those around him, the shuffle of limbs on dusty stone, and the fumbling of their professor attempting to right the situation.
“Say something.” Draco croaked, even though he was nine-tenths sure the demand was futile. He was so sure his chest ached because of it.
"It’s killing you," Granger said, and Draco was beginning to wish he could hex her.
"What does?" Draco asked cautiously; her tone put him on edge.
he parried. Draco inched an eye open to glare at Madam Pomfrey only to see the mediwitch smother a small smile.
Draco croaked. “They stopped entirely?”
, his lips moved around his name, a soft murmur. There was only so much a ghost of a boy could do about somebody else's life, Draco supposed, touching the corner of Harry's mouth with a thumb, a rueful twist at his own. Draco could feel him now, even if the sensations were faded.
"I just... don't know how to respond most of the time. It doesn't mean that I don't like it. I just can't— I think I might still feel like people don't want to touch me. Which is...stupid, isn't it?" Harry huffs wryly. "Imagine destroying bloody
Draco's breath stilled in his chest.
Draco’s.
‘Where are you going?’ Draco asked softly. The sound of it belied the anxiety which was creepin up on him.
Then Draco noticed his classmates, their furious hissing and glares, all of it directed at him, like house points mattered at all in the grand scheme of things. His stomach dropped and his hands suddenly shook.
"I want a living room full of our friends, happy and warm. I want tea in bed. I want to fight over the duvet. I want to wake up in the morning and realise that none of it was ever a dream and that I have the love of my life, and that I have him forever."
The boy he was meant to love forever, and never got to. His love and his soul. Draco would have, if he hadn't gone away. He should have gotten to have him forever, and in that moment, the terrible injustice and agony and grief of it all, of what could have been, of what had been stolen from the two of them, bore down on him with all the weight of a tsunami, drowning him under.
“You should be dead, you’re fucking nothing, you’re nothing but fucking filth – scum!”
Granger left shortly after that, her stance more at ease than it had been before she’d arrived, and it made Draco smile.
so leached of colour they were.
"Harry – you alright?" Ron asked. He sounded distressed over Harry's tears. "It was only a bit of a spill, I’m not
He slowly drew down his shaking hands before Malfoy ran his thumbs over Harry’s cheeks, wiping the tears. There was a familiar fondness in those grey eyes, and Harry’s heart thumped with an old pain, one his soul should have been too young to carry. He was overrun with desperation to touch. The notion of once not being able to pierced through him.
"Fine," Draco muttered, trying to regain his bearings as he blinked hard. "Just an ache."
Granger’s hand searched for it, and then held onto it. The ire and suspicion that typically coloured Granger's interactions with Draco wasn’t there at that moment. Her eyes took on a distant look before she answered with a strange, calm openness, taking him wholly by surprise.
When the smoke had cleared, and Potter laid still and hollow-eyed in the debri, Voldemort's body a mere haze in the face of the other's in his mind, Draco had felt a horror and agony so inexplicably deep and cutting that he might as well have stopped breathing right then and there with him, tears burning up his throat and into his eyes. He could not explain the reason for such anguish, radiating right down to his very soul, for someone that he hadn't had a civil conversation with since they were eleven.
He turned to see his father’s portrait, staring after her, his features wan, pale, and terribly sad.
There had been Cho before her. They'd kissed, and it'd been... well, it'd mostly been nerve-wracking, wet and very uncomfortable.
And out there, in the middle of the yard, was where the phantom of Harry Potter's death haunted them all.
There was a brush over his hand, and Draco looked over to find Harry beside him. And the tightness in his chest eased.
Ron's grabbing Hermione from around the waist and spinning her in a half-circle, rapid-firing kisses into her cheek as she laughs, and then reaches up over her head and dumps a handful of snow over his red beanie hat, grinning, kissing him. Pansy seems to be mock-exaggerating a cooing sound to Blaise, but it seems all in good fun. She balls up snow from the ground in her gloved hand and smears it over Blaise's face, then, apparently turning on her own teammate.
“Something wholly dear to me." He looked right at Harry then. “Something that has always been important to me, right from the start. But it was a terrible secret, Potter. Kept it hidden because I’m a coward, you see. Couldn’t face it then, and I’m doing a terrible job of it now.”
Draco coughed into a small handkerchief, and bloody spittle came away. He frowned at it before hiding it in his pocket.
There was nothing except the swirl of black and the strange sense that something might be right behind him.
Lovely
He heard a few of the Slytherins snort, and his own housemates groan. But the noise his mind honed in on was a deep laugh, from a boy who sat to his left, just across the aisle.
Draco's throat convulsed. He blinked hard and fast at the burn in his eyes, trying to rise above the leaden weight of his heart. He placed his hand in Harry's and let him pull him to his feet, their hands tangled at their shoulder level.
He howled with manic laughter.
Harry lowers down to sit at the foot of his bed, clasping his hands between his lap. He shifts, looking down at his shoes.
that clung to him like a second skin did.
He felt like he could do everything, could finally say anything. But he felt so stunned by it all that it rendered him deathly still and silent.
but on an empty stomach?
So, with a quick spell, and a discreet
Now Draco was silent, unable to gather his fragmented thoughts and say something.
Harry was mouthing words, slowly, and Draco swore he could feel the bass of the growl which would have sounded otherwise.
"But he survived here, didn't he?" He felt the lump in his throat, his voice crack around it. His eyes stung. He kept his face very still, exhaled a close-mouthed tremor of a breath through his nose. "So why do I still feel like it was my fault? Why do I feel like I should have—I should have found a way to keep him—"
mad."
There in his palm was a book bound in light brown leather with a black-stone ring tied to its binding.
"What's going on with you?" Greg asked.
They were lips Draco had never
Harry didn’t listen. Instead, he fisted his hair, his mouth opening as if he was shouting. He suddenly stopped, his face smoothing as if his mind had suddenly settled on something before turning to Draco.
There was Sirius, who had held him tight and taken his face in his hands and put his arm around his shoulders without any thought. Harry thinks about it sometimes and wonders how much more he could have had of that if Sirius were alive, or if he had just gotten to spend more time with him. He thinks of his father and wonders if he would have been like that too.
Pomfrey simply huffed, shoving a pain potion in his hand. Draco took it gratefully and downed it fast. The potions' effects were immediate, and Draco suddenly felt as if he was walking on air.
He looked at Harry, whose eyes trailed the blood with a deep, unsettling sadness.
“Seen what?” Draco asked warily.
"Draco…"
but then stopped herself before her features tensed into a frown.
," he breathed.
Then there were hands on his throat, pushing down with such a sudden jerk that Draco had no air. They pushed harder, harder. Panicked, Draco thrashed, but then he felt hands hold his legs down.
“They should weep blood for all that you have done for them,” Draco intoned slowly, his grip tightening on Potter’s hand.
He eyed the prints, so engrossed in the memory playing before his eyes it was almost as if he was right there all over again, kneeling before Harry. Terrified and desperately hoping Harry would make it out, that nobody would find out what Draco did. That he was more sure about Harry than he'd ever been sure of anything in that moment, and he still couldn't bring himself to give the absolute answer that it was him. To be the one to give him away.
“It is your choice, Draco. I know it is truly an impossible one.”
The first attempt to unstick his eyelids resulted in a short, sharp pain through his skull, the second equally ill-advised. In fact, merely sitting was quickly becoming a pipe dream as Draco realised that
Harry tries to. He really does. But Draco's so warm and heavy against him. He can't think much right now beyond the heat of his back all over his torso, and if he leans his head closer, he can brush his lips against the skin of his neck. His arms are wrapped around the bottom of his ribcage, rising and falling with every breath. He can see his profile, his grey eyes sharp with intelligence and flickering with fast thoughts, his mouth moving and his hands gesturing, the way he pauses to recall, his brows furrowed and his lips curled in thought, and his chest hurts, looking at him, the beating of his heart slow and erratic in his throat. If he leans his head closer, and tilts Draco's head a little towards him, he can kiss him.
“Ah, Draco. Glad I’ve caught you," his mother greeted in an almost sing-song tone.
With furrowed brows, he returned to his seat and opened it to the first page, his mind rolling over the strange sensations the book seemed to be causing.
But there was grief, always.
Draco didn’t reply. There was nothing worth saying anyway. He found his shirt and trousers neatly folded on the bedside table. He rushed in silence whilst careful eyes watched every move he made.
And then he was waking up in the infirmary, Luna and Goyle next to him. His headache was back to a bearable level. Goyle left through the curtains and came back with Madam Pomfrey.
"Darling, you don't look too well," she said, touching a hand to his cheek, his forehead. "Are you ill?"
And then Draco turns around, and Harry says, "Draco."
Draco moved quickly to the doorway, an old corridor that he had never set foot in before. He found himself apprehensive, scared almost, but he walked ahead into the dark shadows. He peered forwards. There were no lights, just stone and echoes as his feet continued on and on, growing pitch-black. He walked until he could no longer see his own hands in front of him, and the cool stone his other hand grazed, that guided him as he ran his hands along it, was terribly cold and damp.
“You are sure that’s all?” Pomfrey pried. Clever as she was, she wasn’t convinced at all.
“Hmm. Well, you seem to have magical exhaustion," she said as her eyes still searched his face. For what, Draco wasn’t sure. “Your wand was checked, and no spell listed accounts for your symptoms. Thus, we will be keeping a close eye on you from now on. At the moment, your core is stable. So, you are free to return to your
soulmates," she corrected herself before visibly cringing.
to touch his image sank into him. His thoughts turned dark as they recalled how Potter looked in his last moments and what Draco might have done differently, what he could have done to save Potter, to save himself from this black feeling in his chest.
Harry’s eyes widened with the thought, and then he made a mess by trying to look suddenly very busy – in doing so he made his inkwell knock over, and the scales clatter.
Ginny eyes the necklace closely, making a funny face, and then nods with a scrunch of her nose and shrugs. "Yeah. I think I just find
too bright when Draco tried to pry his eyes open.
even when Harry was alive and they were children pushing and pulling at each other. Some of these desires were
"It lets you bring back the dead, I think. He figured it out just before we last—" Granger cut herself off with a deep swallow, as if fighting off an awful emotion.
And, if so, what was she trying to tell him now? When it would all unravel?
When he opened his eyes, he saw Harry standing across from him, all light and colour.
Draco turned to see Harry standing behind him, his eyes wandering, obviously taking in the sight of Draco in his old haunt. They grinned at one another. He had an old wish granted then; the sight of Harry in his Common Room filled him. All that was missing is Harry’s uniform. Instead of it, Harry was wearing a tattered hoodie and frayed dark jeans – the clothes Draco saw him fall in.
Draco's lips quirk into a mellow smile. He takes Harry's face in his hands, closes his eyes and does just that.
"She gave me this today," Ginny says with a soft grin. "She made it herself, from the bones of some creature that I don't even remember the name of. It's ghastly, isn't it? But cute."
Potter then walked closer to the bed, slowly, as if aware of how skittish Draco felt then.
How had Draco never seen Harry in this light before? He thought his subconscious must be taking liberties; Harry pulled Draco in, like light, moth, and flame. But his mind now catalogued other details he’d previously overlooked, such as how Harry's clothes were far too large for him, frayed and full of holes. His cheeks were hollow, and his wrists were too thin. There was an instinctive downturn to his lips, like his mouth had not learned to smile unguardedly yet – as if it had been given scarce reason to do so in the first instance.
He follows Draco over into the empty boys' dormitory, heart pounding wildly in his chest. Draco closes the door with a click when Harry enters after him, turns around and crosses his arms over his chest.
from his chest.
was Draco’s inspired opening, and now Granger’s features shifted from mystified to highly concerned.
Draco lifts an eyebrow. "Pardon? What does that mean?" He blinks, confusion furrowing his forehead and scrunching his nose. "Are you telling me that for eleven years, nobody…?"
"Did you know, that when a person dies, their soulmate follows them?"
I never
‘Harry?’ Draco whispered, his voice terribly small.
Draco shushed Harry, not wanting his tears or pain.
He waited for Harry, in his rooms, on the Quidditch pitch, near Hagrid’s hut, under the Gryffindor tower, and even the rafters in the Defence classroom. These were the places that Draco knew Harry loved to visit the most, to explore, and watch as the world moved on without him.
There was a pain in his chest that wouldn’t go away, steadily building with each thump of his heart. It might be his heart; Draco thought briefly before pushing the thought away. He always was a coward, afraid to confront important things.
Harry breathed. “I didn’t want to leave, I didn’t
of, never mind be caught
Harry’s tanned hand was pulling at Draco gently, before showing him his dorm room, his garish red bed.
“Okay," Greg whispered brokenly. “Okay.”
Draco motioned to the stone again, begging to use it with a look.
Draco then felt a hand touch his. His whole body froze, not daring to move, all his focus – all of it – now burned onto that small expanse of warm skin on his wrist.
Then, with a shock he pivoted, his eyes flicking from footprint to footprint. All of them coming to and away from where Draco stood.
His voice had risen to a growl towards the end, and yet, Harry never stopped smiling.
His chest felt like it was being knifed.
He grimaced when Goyle inhaled with a particularly loud snore, causing him to nick a scab.
He couldn't say he didn't entirely understand why they were angry. Draco was too; at himself, the Dark Lord. At his father.
Pomfrey made a note, her expression darkening for a moment.
“Shut your fucking mouth.”
. You saw it – you were right there! And now you’re hallucinating his mute apparition because you’re an idiot and you think about him too much anyway, always have since forever. And –
Saying it aloud seized something in his chest, the grip unrelenting.
Giving up, he then decided to turn his search to something else — the books Madam Pince had intimated that Harry had donated.
After Madam Pomfrey checked him over, casting a few spells and telling him to stay put for the day, he was left with Luna and Greg. For a while, nobody said anything.
“He knows you’ve always cared, very much so,” Lovegood murmured, as if answering his thoughts. ‘Here – this is for you.’
"Rowdy
“Potter," he whispered, the quietest he’d ever been.
Draco stared down at the Defence book unseeingly – a wish for something he couldn’t word or name rising up like bile.
“My hand slipped. I lost my grip on the vial," Draco offered the excuse readily.
He knew that this was not Potter’s ghost – this was not merely an echo of him. He could almost taste Potter’s magic in the air. It rose the small hairs on his arms. Ghosts were too flat and, well, dead for that. Draco’s eyes widened as he took Potter’s form in, understanding fully then that this was no mere imitation of Harry Potter.
Draco had been fine for a few weeks, 'fine' only meaning that none of the symptoms were severe enough to warrant a visit to the infirmary. The nosebleeds came at intermittent times, a quick and runny trickle that he only noticed when someone pointed it out, or when he saw it dripping down onto his collar. His headache was a constant, nagging throb, sharp spikes that made him gasp and double every now and then, his hands tight to his skull, but other than that, it was bearable after a dose of a Pepper-up potion. His failing immune system gave him too many runny noses, sore throats and mild fevers.
But the pendant was so
And so, with his hands in his pockets, he watched as the people that had loved Potter said goodbye to his corpse in the casket, one by one. Granger cried, kissing his forehead. So did Weasley when he knelt by it, murmuring words that weren't for anyone else to hear.
Draco thought, running a hand over the ink of Harry's handwriting, imagining him writing this under a lamp at his desk.
Lovegood then gave him a book. Its cover was an attractive purple, so intense that Draco’s eyes winced at the brightness of it.
It was quiet for a few heartbeats, and the exhale Draco needed to steel himself sounded like a klaxon in the closed space.
you,” is what finally escaped his tight throat. “Before I ever got to have you.”
” Draco garbled.
He looked to Harry with a questioning glance, and Harry nodded his head.
“You’re living without him now, aren’t you?’ Greg said, and it hurt Draco to see the fear and pain he was causing.
Holding the book she had just given him gave him the same strange notion that Loony Lovegood was not all she seemed. He thumbed through the pages, something settling in him now that he was touching a book that both Snape and Harry had held themselves.
“But—"
cute, mostly." Harry laughs, and Ginny grins at him, and it's good. Seeing her like this, being okay with her, being lighter. Ginny Weasley was his first love, and he will never forget her. She is beautiful, funny, caring and fierce, but she deserves someone like Luna Lovegood, someone who will know how to love her the way she should be.
Draco’s head dropped; his hands suddenly became fascinating.
“—No. No, thank you. Lovely meeting you, but I’m going now.” Draco said tersely as he slipped his shoe on and grabbed for his coat.
Alick then said, “Fourth years and new Hufflepuffs, you have each been sponsored by an initiated Hufflepuff. This member will guide you throughout the year in your own personal journey to become your best self, the person who can give something great to the world, the person you are not yet, but can be. Sponsors, please reveal yourselves to your initiates.”
him instead of
Nevertheless, Malfoy moved around the table and pulled the spare chair out. The loss of his body heat in the air around Harry was palpable and aggravating.
he chanted in his head as he approached the stool. McGonagall gave him a stern look and tossed her gaze towards the stool, directing him to sit. He did, under duress.
The anemones curled around his ankles. Harry whined. He couldn't take it anymore. He took his cock in hand and began jerking himself off, but he’d not even settled into a good rhythm before Draco was batting his hand away. Harry could’ve cried.
“Harry, let me check your Gillyweed, come on. I want to get back to shore before lunch.”
“Slowly,” said Harry. “Properly. I… I shouldn’t have done what I did that day in our office. I should’ve told you that I’d wanted you for years, that it was more than just sex. I shouldn’t have made you think it was only about a fuck.”
“Do mine eyes deceive me?” asked Snape. “A Potter working at Potions in the middle of the night. It’s gone four in the morning. Why are you awake?”
Harry was feeling shaken, as were the handful of others who’d reached the magic-level tests in class. They huddled at the far end of the prep table, drinking their hot chocolates silently. Others filled in around them, offering that strange Hufflepuff sort of comfort that they’d all learned in the weeks since their re-sorting. To Harry’s great surprise, Draco pushed in next to him again, his hands wrapped tightly around his own cup, his fingertips whitening with the pressure.
Everyone immediately quieted down. Harry and Draco sat up on their blanket and turned their attention to the Notts and Patils standing at the edge of the stone circle.
Malfoy raised the other eyebrow before throwing his head back and laughing. The sound up close was even more delightful than from afar. Harry swallowed hard. Oh this is not good. He’d thought those boyhood feelings had died when he had died in that forest. But apparently not.
Immediately he felt a corresponding leak on his palm. Malfoy was turned on by the idea. He smiled, even though Malfoy couldn’t see it. “You like that idea, huh? Just you wait, Malfoy, I’m gonna make it so good, then I’m going to shoot my hot, sticky cum inside you.” He licked a stripe up the side of Malfoy’s neck, earning him a low moan. Malfoy unconsciously pushed his arse back against Harry’s cock, sending a delicious shiver through him.
As if sensing he was being looked at, Malfoy lifted his head, turning it to look at Harry. The blush darkened and his eyes lowered again. The arrogance and swagger of earlier was gone, leaving behind a man who looked unsure and maybe a little bit scared.
Harry sighed and raised his glass of mead to his lips, eyes looking out at the crowd.
“Close,” he said, his eyes still watching as Malfoy moved over his cock. It was one of the most erotic sights Harry had ever seen. And then he was falling, lights and sparkles exploding behind the lids he hadn’t realized he’s closed. He could feel as his cock exploded inside Malfoy, shooting his warm cum into the other man, filling him.
“Potter, are you drunk?” a voice asked from somewhere to his right.
Smirking Harry said, “Patience, Malfoy.” Then he added a third finger to the party, stretching Malfoy’s beautiful hole wider. Malfoy nearly screamed.
, he thought bemused.
Draco spat, his face twisting in a sneer. “Did she not realize how good she had it with you? And, I
Harry gave him a slightly shaky smug look, which led to Malfoy returning the look with a smirk. “Don’t get too full of yourself, Potter. I’m sure I could find someone to fuck me like that somewhere else. Possibly with an even bigger cock.”
Finally he settled his glass on the bar and turned his eyes back to Harry. “If you must know, Potter, I’m here to get away from the whispers and stares out there,” Malfoy said, gesturing back towards the crowd milling around in small groups, their chatter carrying across the expanse of the ballroom. “And, in a few cases, curses. And not the colorful language kind either.”
Malfoy was silent for a while. Then, “What happened?”
They smiled at each other as their hands went back to their respective drinks. The silence that settled between them was not quite comfortable but wasn’t awkward either. While they both knew there were things they needed to say to each other, apologies and such, in this moment everything seemed a bit better than it had before.
Harry could only stare wide-eyed at the former Slytherin.
He felt as much as heard the moans Malfoy was making as Harry fucked his mouth, he was so close now, he could feel his bollocks starting to tighten, knew it was only a matter of a few more moments.
“And,” Draco said fiercely, “You are very deserving of being loved, Potter. You
“Fuck, Malfoy, you’re so tight. Feels so good around my cock,” Harry spoke in his ear, licking the shell. Malfoy moaned, pushing against Harry, trying to make him move.
,” he whimpered. “
Then he started to move his hips, watching in fascination as his cock slid in and out of Malfoy’s mouth, feeling the slight scrape of teeth along the shaft. There was just something so dirty and dangerous and thrilling doing this in a public bathroom where anyone could catch them, wards or no.
new robes! And no you are
They broke apart, panting, hands under robes, splayed across backs or grabbing a handful of delectable arse. As the noise of the room returned, Harry suddenly remembered where they were and it was like a bucket of ice cold water thrown on his arousal and the haze of it.
Of all the reactions in the world, especially from Malfoy of all people, whom Harry still couldn’t believe he was telling any of this to, that had been the last thing he’d expected.
He opened his mouth to say something and abruptly closed it realizing he had no idea what to say. Swallowing the last dregs of his drink Harry tried again. “I … well .. I … don’t ...uhm … “
“Then what
fall apart in front of
,’” Harry told him, doing a very good impression of Hermione’s stern tone. He shuddered remembering all the places she had dragged his whining arse that day.
Malfoy took him back into his mouth, tongue swiping over the mushroom head before swallowing the rest of him. He felt the head of his cock hit the back of Malfoy’s throat. Fuck it felt good. So hot.
Harry laughed as he took the wards off the door before opening it and peaking out into the hallway. It was empty. “I know many useful things, Malfoy. Some you may have already experienced. Others you will,” Harry replied, smirking over his shoulder at the man. “Now come on, there’s no one out there. If we can just get beyond the ballroom and into the lifts, we can apparate from the Atrium.”
Thankfully the lifts were empty and the golden gates slid open on the first one they called. Stepping inside and pressing the button for the Atrium, Harry wrapped his arms around his new lover and kissed him with abandon, letting him feel his now very prominent erection and wet leak through his robes.
“Please, what, Malfoy?” Harry asked him, voice low and growly.
Amber liquid splashed into the glass, making the ice clink gently against the sides with a sort of musical jingle. Harry watched the bit of steam rise from the glass in an odd sort of fascination.
Not giving himself any time to actually think about what he was doing, Harry struggled to his feet, standing a bit shakily at first before grabbing Malfoy and spinning them around so that Malfoy was the one with his chest and face pinned to the door. Shoving his knee between Malfoy’s thighs, he could feel Malfoy’s long, hard cock straining in his trousers. He felt his own cock start to leak needly again.
They fell silent for a few minutes, both looking back out into the crowd while also stealing glances at each other while the other wasn’t looking. Or so they thought until Harry caught Draco looking and their gazes locked. He could feel the tension in the air around them, thick with something like anticipation. Even arousal, at least on Harry’s end. His cock was aching for attention now, and he could feel the steady leak spreading wetness over the front of his underwear. Again, he was so very thankful for robes that hid things so well.
A moment later, silver gray eyes looked over at Harry and suddenly he felt rooted to the floor. Malfoy’s eyes, which Harry had always thought of as cold, looked warm and bright, like melted silver. To his astonishment, instead of sneering or glaring or anything else hostile that he had come to expect from the other man, Malfoy simply looked surprised to see Harry. Something like genuine delight lit up his pale, pointed features, softening them in a way Harry hadn’t ever seen before.
Malfoy’s shoulders and head dropped, the tension he’d been holding on to draining away. He was still very pink in the face but there was a smile tugging at his lips.
No matter though, he was sure eventually the drinks would work their magic.
Malfoy whined at the loss but soon was groaning in satisfaction when he felt the head of Harry’s cock at his hole, rubbing around it, spreading the pre-cum all around his stretched hole. Then Harry pushed in, letting the mushroom head push inside before stopping, then pulling out again. He did this several times, teasing not only Malfoy, but himself.
, who are kind, loyal, caring, selfless and giving.
Malfoy nodded his understanding, a more genuine smile coming to his face. Harry felt his heart thud in his chest.
“Meanwhile,” he continued once he’d gotten control of his emotions again, “She was sleeping with random men every other week. And she didn’t care if I found out or how it made me feel. And the worst part is, her family blames ME for it all. Said I wasn’t attentive enough towards her. Which to be fair, I wasn’t at first. The first months after the war were … hard. I was a mess. But she was there for me. She helped me get through some of the worst of it without ever complaining.
“So tight, Malfoy. So hot. Fuck it’s going to feel so delicious having you wrapped around my cock,” he told Malfoy harshly, adding a second finger to the first. He watched as his fingers slipped into Malfoy, felt the way his arse clung to them. Malfoy was panting heavily now, and Harry could see the shiny trail against the door that the steady leak of his cock was leaving behind.
Harry snorted. “Yea well so did I. Thought we would spend the rest of our lives together. Should have known that anything good wouldn’t last,” he replied bitterly.
, whatever stupid moniker they could stick him with. It made his skin itch. Unfortunately it was mandatory that all Ministry employees attend the annual Spring Ball, and the Aurors had to also be on duty during the whole thing. Mostly in case anyone got too drunk on mead or wine and needed to be escorted out. So far most people had behaved themselves. Just one minor incident with a couple of old codgers arguing that the other had stolen their cane (they were leaning against the table next to them).
Trying to change the subject and to get his spiraling arousal under control Harry asked the question that had been forefront on his mind since he had spotted Malfoy and his pink hair in the crowd.
this time, Malfoy. Suck you dry. Would you like that?” Harry whispered against his lips.
There was a flash of pink in his peripheral vision, so shocking in a sea of white, pale blues, pale yellows, and pale greens, that for a moment, Harry thought it was his imagination. Then, as his eyes scanned the crowd of party goers in the large ballroom again, he saw the pink again, standing among a group of dodgy old wizards, dressed in the drabbest robes possible. He blinked. No. He has to be seeing things. It can’t possibly be who he thinks it is. There’s no way the person he’s thinking of would ever be seen with that color.
to be cared for and loved. You deserve to have someone take care of you for once. You are worthy.”
Lifting an eyebrow in return Harry said, “Oh? Where did you go? And yes I am.”
Silence hung in the air between them as Harry’s words faded. Suddenly he was very aware of his nakedness. And wondered how exactly they had gone from the officious Ministry gala to being in this random Ministry bathroom, having sex and now standing here in nothing but their skin having a serious talk about feelings. Or possible feelings.
“That absolute
“I think I should get to taste
His thoughts were still so loud, still screaming. He’d hoped that the alcohol would be enough to drown their voices. To dull the ache in his heart. To erase the image of her with someone else. Again.
Harry smiled back. “Maybe both,” he murmured reluctantly stepping away, his body bemoaning the loss of the delicious skin on skin contact. Finding his wand where he’d dropped it earlier, Harry summoned their clothes from where he had banished them. Another wave and both of them were perfectly put together again.
He watched as Malfoy made his excuses to the dodgy old wizards and then began to weave his way through the crowd towards him.
get nice, tailored robes.
Moving his fingers slowly in and out, feeling the clinging heat and the delicious stretch of Malfoy’s perfect arse, Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to wait much longer. After only a few thrusts of his fingers, he withdrew them.
Harry laughed, “I think we can manage.” He sobered quickly though. “You know I stopped hating you a long time ago, Malfoy. I know you didn’t want to be part of any of that in the end. You were just a kid. I’m sorry I didn’t realize it sooner.”
Malfoy chuckled, “If you’re good, maybe we can arrange that. So how about it, Potter? Want me to suck your cock?”
you mean, Potter?” came the icy reply.
“Malfoy?” he asked stupidly. What did he want? Why was he even here?
In another moment the two were slipping into the nearest loo, locking and warding the door. The minute the door was secured, Harry found himself pushed roughly against it, and Malfoy’s lips on his, kissing him with abandon. A knee was insinuated between his thighs, putting delicious pressure on his aching cock. He groaned into Malfoy’s mouth and felt the answering smile against his lips.
buying something off a rack! If I have to drag you by your ear you
Carefully, Harry scissored his fingers, stretching and pulling, widening and preparing Malfoy to take his cock. Malfoy moaned, he was nearly incoherent with desire.
“Patience,” Malfoy said, his mouth close to the tip of Harry’s cock now and then he was inside a warm, wet cavern and pleasure exploded in his body. He mumbled incoherent words as Malfoy’s tongue swirled around him, tracing the vein on the underside of his shaft before licking at the head, the point of his tongue pushing into the slit. “You taste devine, so delicious. Can’t wait for you to cum in my mouth.”
In less than a few minutes, Malfoy stood in front of him, one elegant eyebrow arched. “Well well, Potter. Don’t you clean up nicely,” he said, voice devoid of the usual mocking drawl. Harry felt exposed as Malfoy blatantly looked him up and down slowly, drinking in his clothes and form. “Yes, very nicely indeed. Those robes from
A hand landing on his shoulder and giving a gentle squeeze startled Harry out of his musings and when he lifted his eyes he saw the concern in the grey eyes of the man next him. Harry wondered when Malfoy had started to be concerned about him. Or when it started to matter to Harry that Malfoy was concerned about him.
Harry was just about crawling out of his skin with arousal now, he could feel his cock pulsing with the rhythm of his thudding heartbeat. He definitely wanted that. “Yes, I want you to suck my cock. I want you to swallow my hot cum, and then I’m going to fuck you, Malfoy,” he breathed against the other’s mouth, their lips brushing but not really kissing.
When he did manage to open them, he found himself being stared at by intense, worried looking, gray eyes at close range. He swallowed hard, his heart was still beating an erratic staccato in his chest. “Fucking hell,” he whispered, realizing his throat was a bit raw. Had he shouted when his orgasm hit? He couldn’t remember.
Draco hissed, breathing out a yes before Harry descended on his mouth again. The jarring stop of the lift broke them apart, Harry realizing they’d made it up the Atrium. No one was around. Quickly they stepped out and without another thought Harry pulled Draco to him whispering, “I can’t wait to suck your cock, Malfoy,” before disappearing with a faint pop.
“Fuck, Potter,” he breathed, his voice rough. “Hurry up, I need you to fuck me.”
Harry sat in shock at the words spilling from Malfoy. He’d known he’d said the wrong thing somehow, but the venom in Malfoy’s words were like a blow to his stomach. Quickly, Harry scrambled to his feet, ignoring his own nakedness. Holding up his hands, palms out, he said as quickly as he could before Malfoy could leave. Panic was starting to spiral inside him, and Harry realized that his feelings for this man were more complicated than he thought.
He vaguely felt the coolness of the title on his bare arse and the cool air of the bathroom on his wet cock . He was still shaking, cum still dripping in large droplets from his twitching cock. It was a few more minutes before he became aware of his surroundings again and even longer before he could open his eyes.
No. It really can’t be. But, when he blinks once more and the image in front of him doesn’t change, he has to admit what his eyes are telling him. The man with the brilliant pink hair (his heart gives a painful twinge at the thought of Tonks with her bubble gum pink hair), is none other than Draco Malfoy.
Draco smiled slightly at him, which did funny things to Harry’s insides but he ignored that. Who knew he could smile like that?  “I know we agreed to be civil to and all that, but I’d rather thought … well … I thought we could be friends?” There was a vulnerability in his voice that struck Harry. Draco then seemed to hesitate before he added; “I … I don’t hate you. I … I haven’t hated you in years. I sort of … well … I thought maybe we could try to be friends after everything was over. Start fresh?”
“Impatient, aren’t you? Can’t wait for me to put my cock in you.” A quick flick of his wrist and both he and Malfoy were completely naked.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” he blurted.
, Harry thought as the bartender returned to refill their glasses.
Malfoy noticed where he was looking and when he looked down he seemed unsurprised to see the cum all over him. Instead, in slow, deliberate motions, he reached down, drew his finger through the splashes of white on his shirt and chin, collecting the cum. Then he lifted the finger to his mouth and sucked.
“Gonna … gonna cum … “ he panted, hand unconsciously going to Malfoy’s head, threading his fingers through the soft blonde locks, holding it in place, moving his hips faster, the increase in friction driving him to the edge. Everything exploded and he was cumming hard, harder than he’d ever done. Stars twinkled and sparked behind his eyes, he could feel himself shaking as his orgasm tore through him like a train. He felt the spurts of cum shooting down Malfoy’s throat, thick and heavy. Spots danced in his vision and he felt the moment his knees buckled only to be caught by strong arms around his waist, helping him to sit on the cold tiled floor of the bathroom, even as he kept cumming. White streaks hitting Malfoy’s trousers and shirt.
The sound of their heavy breathing filled the room, along with the groan from both of them as Harry’s softened cock slipped out of Malfoy along with a long stream of hot, sticky cum.
Slowly, deliberately, he rubbed his finger over Malfoy’s now slightly stretched hole, enjoying the way it twitched at his touch. Finally, Harry slowly pushed the finger inside, feeling the stretch and give of the muscles as he moved it slowly into the glorious, tight heat of Malfoy’s perfect arse.
Malfoy nodded, that shark-like smile still in place. “So we’ll be colleagues now. Think we can get along being back in the same castle again, Potter?”
The gray eyes blinked, the anxious worry leaving them, and then the smirk was back in place. The anxiousness in Malfoy’s eyes was replaced with smugness and pride. “You taste fucking fantastic, Potter. I knew you would,” Malfoy said, and Harry was smug to note that his voice was rather hoarse from having Harry’s cock fucking into his throat. Then he noticed the stripes of white on Malfoy’s chin, on the front of the shirt he was still wearing, and on one leg of his trousers. Harry blinked, had he really cum that much? Bloody hell.
? Very nice. And tailored to fit. Let me guess, the Misses?”
, he thought. Oh he was so fucked.
This time the eyebrow lift was more quizzical. “No, I haven’t been in the country for a while, only returned about three weeks ago. So, you’re bisexual?”
“And erm, yes, I do. Bat for both teams, that is,” he finished, feeling that heated flush now crawling up his neck. His cock was starting to throb in his pants now.
Suddenly it felt awkward and tense again, now that the desire had been spent, neither seemed to know what to do or say. It was long moments later when Harry snuck a glance at Malfoy that he saw the other man’s cheeks were stained pink. Malfoy was
Relieved more than he’d care to admit, Harry took a tentative step forward, hand reaching for the other man. Draco came willingly, slipping into Harry’s arms, pressing a soft, warm kiss to his lips.
The longer Harry’s silence went on, the more worried and anxious Malfoy looked. Heart stuttering Harry licked his suddenly dry lips and said, voice quiet. “What do you want it to be?”
After a few seconds Harry began to move, slowly pulling out until just the head of his cock was caught at Malfoy’s rim, then pushing back in again. He kept doing this, increasing his speed each time until he’d found a fast, steady pace.
He turned a glare on the man in front of him who was smirking in satisfaction. “Oh don’t look at me like that, Potter. You honestly think I would have done that with an audience? I cast the spells as soon as I was over here. Besides, you weren’t objecting a few minutes ago,” Malfoy said, stepping back into Harry’s personal space once more. “And I have a feeling you won’t be objecting to what I have in mind next. I want to taste you, Potter. I want to feel the weight of your cock on my tongue. I want to suck you dry. Would you like that, Potter?” Draco whispered, slipping a hand down between them and squeezing Harry’s cock through robes, trousers, and pants. He moaned. “Fuck, Malfoy.”
Finally, unable to take it anymore Harry pushed inside further, reveling in the feeling of tight heat and the way Malfoy’s hole stretched around him to fit him. When he was fully seated, Harry groaned in pleasure. It felt incredible.
Harry stared down into his drink, trying to once more silence his screaming thoughts and wondering once more why he had just spilled all of that out to Malfoy of all people. Maybe he was just that drunk.
