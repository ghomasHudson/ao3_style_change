“Dear god, you look like shit Potter” Draco piped up suddenly, causing the other boy to stop mid sentence
“Better yet, if you hadn’t come back to Hogwarts at all!” Pansy chimed again, seeming the most enthusiastic to get involved
“I’ll have a better time than you.” Draco smiled “I can already picture you and Weasley having the first romantic, slow dance together with the other champions.”
“I know, I know” Harry sighed, tilting his head into his hand so his palm was resting on his forehead and he closed his eyes.
Ron was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet in his hand, shaking his head. Though it seemed he was more than happy to read through the entire article despite his best friend's humiliation.
It seemed that wherever Draco was over the following two days, Harry wasn’t and he wondered how that could be.
However he was all eyes, and no ears. The way he seemed to listen vigorously or his contemplative demeanour meant nothing to him when whatever came spilling out his mouth was nothing short of foul.
Draco had been the first one to suggest it, followed by Pansy writing a delicate letter, and Blaise sending it off to Potter during the flurry of breakfast the very next day.
Harry frowned at being pulled out of his thoughts, let alone where they had even headed. It took him a few moments to register what had happened before he jumped up from the couch.
“See Harry? Nobody even cares anymore about Cedric asking Cho to the ball and Draco tricking you into thinking she was going to ask you” Ron spoke with a mouth full of toast
Before he could analyse the situation anymore he felt something digging into his shoulder, Harry was pushing past him harshly and leaving without another word.
“And now, he’s gone and stolen your girlfriend. How embarrassing. I can’t wait to see how this one plays out, right Potter?.”
“I said shut it, Malfoy!” Harry spoke loudly, taking a threatening step forward toward him which made Draco jerk back slightly on instinct
Harry sat deep in his chair in the Gryffindor common room, elbow on the arm rest and head in his hand as he watched as Ron made a face at Hermione once his reading material had been taken away.
Harry went into the dining hall after a slow morning routine, finding familiar faces and sitting down beside Ron.
“I think i’m going to go to the library” Harry spoke, as if the mention of Draco had most of his other problems rushing back to him
"Well, great. I'm glad we had this conversation" Draco shoved the rest of the pastry into his mouth, no longer interested in this particular topic
They chatted amongst themselves until they heard steps not far off in the distance, and some of them started finding it hard to contain their laughter like this was the funniest thing in the world.
He passed an isle with a sole occupant who was hunched over one of the many books that lay sprawled out and open on the desk.
Harry lifted his head up quickly, fixing his crooked glasses from having been laying on his arm, his face falling when he noticed who it was.
He thought the whole ferret incident with Moody would’ve made Draco back off, but he hadn’t. And come to think of it, he thought maybe the Cho prank was some sort of revenge. If Draco’s strategy was to just get progressively meaner every time Harry got him back then so be it.
“I’m so tired of you!” Harry stressed again “I'm tired of your group and your little girlfriend, i'm tired of these god forsaken tasks, and these assignments, I'm tired of Ron and Hermione. It’s every day, all the time, at school, at home, in the hallways, I can't get a break around here can I!” Harrys voice was steadily rising and he was at the point of yelling
“Do you ever take a break, Malfoy? You know you’ve been on my arse since first year. You really don’t take rejection well, you know that?” Harry quipped, standing up now and stacking up the books he had collected
“I’m just trying to be supportive!” Ron spoke “There’s no way I can go into class with that blond git. Even the thought of what he did makes me want to punch him right in the stupid face.”
Word had gotten out that with the Yule ball approaching, boys and girls alike were rushing to secure themselves a partner.
Harry looked around now, glancing each way. There was nobody else around, no sounds to be heard beside the gentle patter of rain painting the uncovered pavement a darker shade.
Draco munched on his pastries, shoving that feeling of regret down inside him and instead thinking about what assignments he needed to be doing.
“Upset, Potter? Maybe if you hadn't put your name in the goblet in the first place this could all be avoided.” Draco spoke
Draco hadn't been listening, but only remembered because he was so bemused by Snape trying to explain to them about dance etiquette and then resorting to reading from a little handbook. He hasn’t thought people were wanting to actually go outside of getting to press up close to the person of your choice.
“None of your business what i’m doing, Malfoy” Harry spoke with disdain, snapping the book he had been resting on shut.
He gestured behind himself at Ron who was still staring into the fire, almost lustfully now. Harry cleared his throat to get Rons attention but even that didn't work, so he glanced back at the sisters. Padma looked concerned, but Parvati was still smiling.
He didn’t feel how he had expected to, he felt no need to celebrate, but plastered a smile on his face and forced out a laugh.
It was almost too much for him to bear. He wasn’t weak, no, he knew he wasn’t. He was stressed, tired.
Harry left behind the laughing group, Pansy hitting Draco's arm playfully as their plan had been executed perfectly.
He shook himself out of his thoughts and they were soon making their way out with a flurry of robes and echoed voices.
Ron glanced at the chessboard they had temporarily abandoned mid conversation and made his next move.
Dracos eyes trailed over to the exit where Harry was no longer in sight, the setting sun streaming into the stone walled room and for a moment Draco thought about taking off after him.
It was a very Slytherin way of thinking, he thought, not taking the high road. But something about Draco filled this deep, burning and rising passion for-
“Potter musn’t get discouraged from this Tournament.” Snape paused “You’re going to get yourself into more trouble than it's worth”
And maybe it was that evil Draco felt metastasising inside him that made things harder to deal with. He didn’t know.
There was something about Harry bouncing back after being the victim of Dracos own bullying rubbed him the wrong way, so he felt the need to continue. Maybe it was he admired what Harry had, that very ability to bounce back. To work through it, to move on, continue to save the day.
He ignored the concerned undertone, knowing they often were overly worried whenever notable things happened- which also happened to be very frequently.
On most days he started to feel like a nuclear reactor, toxicity oozing and seeping through every pore and sometimes when he looked in the mirror at the end of the day, he was worried he was one wrong move from melting down.
Draco raised an eyebrow at her tone, glancing over at Goyle who seemed to be following the conversation.
“There's no way you stand a chance against Cedric, and half the school thinks you're a dastardly liar.” Draco spoke
“Sorry- I didn’t want to wake you.” Ron started as he watched Harry now “You look so peaceful when you’re asleep”
“What a pathetic little crush. She’s already going with Cedric, watched it happen myself” Draco hummed proudly
Harry's eyes met Dracos again but only for a split moment, and now with that burning feeling of regret searing the inside of his chest did he realise how tired Potter really looked.
He felt every emotion as it passed through him, like a weight sitting heavy on his chest. The embarrassment, the anger, the stress, the sorrow, the fear, the pure, relentless day-to-day tiredness he felt.
The sun streamed into the silent room, thoughts of the bitter cold of last night by the lake came back to him, how it had made his bones ache, his cheeks and nose stinging with the frigid weather. And then he remembered how nice it was to slip into bed and warm up, and sleep dreamlessly. There was always a silver lining.
“As if you actually thought someone was going to ask you to the ball.” Draco laughed, and soon erupted the chorus of laughter they had been trying so hard to hold in
The rumbling on the tracks, although no different in reality, resonated differently this time. Loud enough to notice to the average person, but for Harry, swirling in his thoughts and numbing them simultaneously. The foliage of the countryside flew past his window in a whirlwind of green, yet he didn’t really see it. It only reminded him of their screams…
He pointed to Draco, and it took Harry a moment to realize what was going on. The blond was staring at the flames at the other end of the room, paralyzed in fear. His eyes were glassy, but there was no mistaking the look on his face. It was the exact same one Harry had seen during the Battle of Hogwarts in the Room of Requirement. Blaise looked at Harry, desperately. “The flames are going to get over here eventually. Help me.”
Harry sighed, turning back to the front and started as he saw that McGonagall stood at the top of the stairs, blinking at Blaise’s retreating figure. She looked down, shook her head sadly, then made her way back to the front of the class.
Harry took that all in, reading it over several times as he walked back to the common room with Ron and Hermione. As he stepped inside the room with them, he scanned it for Draco. When he was sure he wasn’t there, he typed back. ‘
Harry gasped for air, and Draco could feel his whole body shaking as his own often did after having crucio used on him. He shook his head against the blond’s chest. “I couldn’t save them… I never wanted any of this…”
.” A snake flew from the end of his wand, landing ten feet away from Draco. It slithered forwards and Draco jumped back with a gasp. He quickly hit the wall with his back, eyes blown wide. Justin only stood still, an eyebrow quirked in a sort of concerned curiosity.
“Of course I noticed,” Harry said in disbelief. “I’ve always been aware of you for some reason. And you
Harry looked to Ron beside him and then to his friends. He glanced back out at the other boys as he spoke. “Should we ask them all to come over here? We could try out some Weasley products or those candies that make you impersonate animals, or something.”
Blaise, Seamus, and Dean snickered, while Justin, Neville, and Ernie rolled their eyes. The cries and Draco’s incoherent mumbling from inside the curtain subsided and the group turned back to the curtains as if they could see through them to the pair of boys sitting in silence.
“Yes! Because you had been a twat and people had told me about Slytherin and I told it ‘not Slytherin, anything but Slytherin.’ And so it put me in Gryffindor.”
“I was saved by a mother’s love, three times. First by my mum, from Voldemort. Second, by Molly Weasley, from loneliness and neglect. And third, by your Mother… because of her love for you. She checked my pulse in the forest, and when she found out I was alive, she asked if you were alive, and if you were in the castle. When I said yes, she lied to Voldemort. It’s the only reason I’m here.”
Draco attempted to cover his flinch of surprise by rolling his shoulders. “Don’t be. You did the same for me.”
“I’m Michael. I don’t know how I made it into Ravenclaw but I’ve just learned to except it, and even though I’ve ever played it, I’m really intrigued by the muggle game baseball.” Harry chuckled under his breath as Michael turned to the next person.
The call had been quiet, but Harry had still picked it up from across the aisle. He glanced over to see Pansy tugging on Draco’s shoulder, the opposite one which was occupied by a tiny hamster. His gaze was focused on Harry’s desk and he scrunched his eyebrows, looking between Draco and the small bird. His silver eyes were openly staring, transfixed on the twittering creature. He snapped his fingers, but the other boy didn’t look up. His breathing was slightly heavier—Harry could see his chest rising and falling.
She shrugged, looking between him and Ron. “I guess something else came up. I’m not sure what could have, though. She wasn’t very involved.”
“You mean luck,” said Hermione, nose still buried in her book. Harry snorted as Ron glared at her. She glanced up at him briefly, “You know it's true. Harry could’ve easily beaten you.”
Malfoy didn’t rise to Goyle’s taunts. Harry’s eyes widened, flitting back and forth between the two, former, friends.
Harry stared down at the grey speech bubble on his screen, then locked his phone. His read receipts were off anyways. “What are the chances?”
Harry, Ron, and Dean strode into the common room with wind-burned cheeks and their eyes set on food. Draco looked up from his textbook immediately after hearing them come in, and watched as Harry spotted the platters sent for them. They strolled over to the area where Draco was sitting, curled up in the corner of the couch with parchment draped inside his textbook working on potions homework. He quickly turned his attention back to his book, and felt the couch dip beside him as someone sat down.
Harry made a face, surprised at this revelation. He knew Malfoy was smart, but he’d never realized how bookish he really was.
Harry tore his gaze away and refocused onto his own team. Ginny was instructing the chasers on a new drill, while Jimmy was showing Maya how to properly swing her bat. Harry decided to circle above them and practice some rolls and dives as he searched for the snitch. He practiced corkscrews, vertical twists, dives, and finally, a looping dive that allowed him to quickly change directions, as if folding on an axis and heading back the way he had come after turning upside down. In his head he called it a looping dive, as he wasn’t quite sure what the real thing was called.
“Huh.” A ghost of a smile appeared on his face. “So is that all muggles have to write with? Like us with quills?”
Transfiguration was nosier than usual that day, the seventh and eighth years mingling, chatting, and laughing amongst themselves while they worked on a new spell. They’d done similar work before in previous years and were now turning their quills into small animals.
Harry stared around the room for a moment, taking in all of the different students practicing different charms. Hermione, of course, had a glass of wine in front of her. Sue had dried out some sort of flower. Luna was beaming at the legs on the teacup in front of her, which Ginny was raising her eyebrows at with something between amusement and confusion. As he turned back to the other side of the room, he saw a flare of orange over Ron’s shoulder. Squinting at it, his eyes widened, realizing someone below had set something on fire.
Within a few minutes, they were racing again, diving and swerving through the beams of the stadium. Side by side they stretched to close their fingers around the snitch and finally, Harry emerged with it in his grasp. His team cheered, as did Ron and Hermione as he smiled at them from afar. Ginny and Dean flew over, clapped him on the back. Dean nodded at Draco, who returned the gesture, uncomfortably.
“Thirdly, because of the events of last year I feel it very pressing that I comment on this. The war was fought bravely, and although there were tragic casualties, the students that you see in this room were all very brave and valiant. All of you deserve to be here. Please respect each other. No house is better, nor worse than another… and neither is any student. Work together, support each other… you have all seen some horrible things. The staff have been trained to help you deal with your trauma, and we would like you to know that there is always someone here to help you.
He and Draco circled each other above the play, waiting for a glimmer of gold to catch their eye. No sooner had Harry thought that, however, than he saw a gold streak near the Gryffindor goalposts. A blur of gold and silver nearby told him that Draco had also seen the snitch and Harry leaned forwards, accelerating until the two were neck-in-neck, both reaching for the golden orb. But it’s fluttering wings deceived them and it cut back underneath the two seekers, heading the other way. Harry did the looping dive that he had been practicing, following the snitch. Draco attempted to copy him, but Harry heard him yelp behind him. He turned to see Draco hanging off of his broom, where he had slid off trying to flip upside-down, his footing having been misplaced. Harry floated closely underneath him, allowing the blond to adjust his hands and push off of Harry’s broom with one foot back onto his own.
He was brought back to his senses as the other boy began shaking. He tightened his grip, now feeling how slim Draco really was. Harry could feel his ribs through his clothing. “It wasn’t real, Draco… It wasn’t real. None of that was real. He’s gone… he’s gone… You’re safe. I promise, you’re safe. Shh… It’s okay…” Harry kept talking to him as Draco buried his head in his knees, slightly muffling his sobs. Harry just held him tight, allowing him to break, a comforting hand on his other side.
down, let alone how to calm Harry down. He rested his head on top of Harry’s and rubbed his back as he let out all of his pent-up emotions. “Shh… you’re safe with me… no one is here to hurt you…”
Harry glanced down at his phone, and the boy’s face from only minutes prior popped into his head. “Maybe. I dunno. I didn’t even know he was taking that class.”
The Great Hall was full of chatter when Harry and Ron plopped down at the Gryffindor table across from Hermione. “Good morning,” she chirped, smiling at the pair over her muffin. “Have a good night last night?”
Professor McGonagall came up to them and her eyes widened. “Hello,” she said, a laugh clearly being suppressed.
Harry’s gaze shifted to Malfoy, who looked skeptical, but curious. The corner of Harry’s lip quirked in amusement. “It’s sort of like a quill. Except you don’t have to dip it in ink all the time.”
Harry stifled his laugh and pointed his wand at the vinegar. A burst of air came out his wand and Ron had to catch the goblet, glaring at Harry. Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “I guess I need more practice.” Ron rolled his eyes, but grinned as he turned away, trying once more.
“First I think you should fix that monstrosity on Mister Malfoy’s head… and then try adding or removing freckles.”
Justin cut the cards. “If you can collect three of the same cards, you can knock. The other players get to draw one more card. Unless they have three cards of a higher value than yours, you can win. So if I had three kings and Hermione had three aces, she’d win, because she’s ace high.”
Ron eyed him, praying that Harry’s sixth-year obsession hadn’t returned. “What? Were you expecting a hello?”
. Not anymore. So… I don’t know. It’s funny that now of all times I catch a glimpse of that side of him.”
“No,” said Harry, frowning. “Is it falling asleep or staying asleep that’s the problem? Or nightmares, maybe?”
More scraping chair legs pulled Harry’s attention away from Luna. Blaise had pulled up a chair beside him and was sitting with his stomach against the back. Harry bit his lip. “Is he okay?”
He turned to Hermione, who’s brow creased in confusion. “Yeah. It’s a really small class this year, there is only six or seven of us.”
“No…” Harry whispered. “I’d have to fall asleep for that. My brain just doesn’t shut up sometimes. Can you have nightmares while you’re awake?”
The three continued to add, remove, and alter each other’s appearances for the rest of the class. Hermione’s lips turned purple, Draco grew another three inches, and Harry’s eyes turned blue. They spent most of the afternoon laughing at each other, making snide comments, and overall, enjoying each other’s company.
“He asked, but the guy wouldn’t tell him. So they’ve just decided not to tell each other. At least, not yet.”
After the class had resumed for a few minutes and they were back to working with tiny animals, Harry felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned around, meeting blue eyes. “Hey, you all right, Luna?” He felt Hermione turn around as well.
He grasped the blond’s arm, and Blaise grasped the other one, and together they tugged him forwards. His gaze snapped away and he hurried with Harry and Blaise, taking wild looks back at the orange glow and jets of water. Blaise elbowed his way through a group of people and brought them to a bench against the wall, where Harry pulled Draco down to sit. He was back to staring at the flames, which were slowly being put out. Harry could tell it wasn’t that serious, but obviously to Draco, it did not seem that way. Blaise, who sat on Draco’s other side, surveyed him. He was heaving for breath, completely unaware that some other students were staring at him. It was as if all he could see was the fire. The scene repeating in his head like a broken record. Crabbe’s scream as he fell into the inferno…
Draco shook his head, pushing food around on his plate. “No. I mostly stayed inside with my mother.”
Draco didn’t switch his gaze, just continued reading the same line over again for the third time. “Hi.”
But not. It was kind of nice, not bickering. Not trying to one up each other even in the first few days. But it did make him wary, because something had changed. A lot.
Ron closed his eyes, the fact that he had no idea what to do about this anymore evident in his expression. “I know.”
“He’s only thinking so hard because all of his hobbies include being a Death Eater,” sniggered Ernie. Some of the boys laughed.
If he did, he said nothing about it. Draco tried earnestly to continue his studying, but found it impossible when the boy next to him began talking about Quidditch. Every time he tried to read the next line, he had to go back and read the previous one. The sound of Harry’s voice was utterly distracting, and he all but gave up and listened to their conversation.
“Alright. Now, I’d like you to partner up. I won’t partner you this time, because it’s just review, and as I have been told, some of you may not be very comfortable with this so soon after the war. Take your time, get used to it, and if you need to stop, take a few minutes. Off you go.”
“I don’t know if he knew it was you or not, at first. But he’s definitely not fine, judging on what happened. Frankly, I’m not sure if he cared that it was you once he found out. It wasn’t really characteristic of him. But war… I guess.”
He took it tentatively, eyes focused on the half-clear, half dark tube of ink. He rolled it between his fingers, looked in the hollow end as well as the tip. Then he handed it back to Harry. “So the ink is in the tube, and it comes out when you apply pressure?”
“Obviously, the three unforgivables. But a few more dangerous ones I can think of are the entrail-expelling curse,  obliviate, transmogrify… sectumsempra… and… fiendfyre.”
“I was going to change her hair colour,” Harry said. “I can try yours, too, if you like. It might be easier, because your hair is such a light colour.”
“Where did you get all of your makeup?” Hermione voiced. “I thought witches usually just used their wands?”
Ron only stared at Fred, who waved at him. Both of them had tears in their eyes. Hermione gently pulled Ron away from his brother and they continued up the stairs to a giant frame on the wall. It held the Hogwarts crest, all four houses represented equally. McGonagall pushed its center inwards and said, “Lime lollies.”
Harry chewed on his lip, setting his phone face down on the table. Hermione looked up at him, then over at Ron who was playing a game. She rolled her eyes. “Are you guys going to do any work?”
Ron looked between Harry and Hermione. “Wait… there’s only seven dormitories. Where are we supposed to sleep? On the floor?”
The duelling started after everyone had found their place, and the room became full of light, movement, and sound. Jets of light, laughter, squeaking shoes. Harry pointed his wand at Ron and thought in his head,
Hey everyone! I hope you enjoyed this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it! Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Until next time! -Emma :)
Those words seemed to break Draco out of his daze. He stood abruptly and took off in the opposite direction from everyone else. Blaise stood to follow but Harry held up a hand. “My turn.” He spun on his heel and left in the same way as Draco had, leaving Hermione and Blaise staring after him.
“He did try to help me when I was in the Manor. He would bring me extra food and heal my wounds when he could. But they did awful things to him there, too. I could hear him scream when they tortured him. It was quite awful… I don’t blame him for being scared.”
Harry felt a pang in his chest. Could that really be true? Draco Malfoy, one of the most popular students growing up… never had anyone get to know him? What about Pansy and Blaise? They seemed to be good friends with him… ‘
It sounded as though Ron had choked on something. “No I wouldn’t! She’s already into me.” Harry and Dean both laughed. “What? I don’t need to impress her.”
The boys laughed together, some jokingly dancing to the music. The conversed together as they goofed off with the candies. Next, Michael sounded like a duck. The boys chortled as he hopped around, jumping over their feet and flapping his arms. Harry’s head fell back in laughter as Michael stepped on Ron, causing him to yelp.
Pansy eyed him, but whether she was amused at his choking or his stance on Draco, Harry wasn’t sure. Finally, she nodded. “Alright then.” She turned to Hermione. “Did you hear about Hannah?”
Potions, as the last class of the day, seemed to drag by. Harry sat with Hermione, cutting and weighing while she took care of the cauldron. They sat in relative silence while the rest of the class chatted, both caught up in their own thoughts.
Harry glanced around him, heart still beating out of his chest. Behind him, Ginny crouched under her desk, wand drawn, breathing steady but eyes full of terror. Luna crouched next to her, hair in her eyes because of her downcast gaze. Neville was beside Ron, shaking his head as he rose back to his seat. Hannah, Ernie, Tony, Michael, Terry, and Lavender all looked to be in a similar position.
Abruptly, Malfoy stood. He handed Blaise the box of sweets and turned his back, heading for his bed. Harry watched him with curious eyes, the other boys mainly with sneers of satisfaction. Malfoy snapped his curtains closed, hiding him from their glares. The boy’s turned back to each other, rolling their eyes. The malice was gone though—they knew they’d went too far.
,” and sent it towards Harry so Ron could see him. He knew Ron was sitting on the edge of the boy’s bed, but he couldn’t bring himself to take his eyes off of Harry.
Harry shook his head, turning to Ron. “Huh? No.” He stood and headed for the shower. He slipped into the shower Malfoy had clearly just been in, as it was the only vacant one. Once the door closed Harry turned the water on so that it was burning hot. He never got hot showers as a child, and now he cherished them. What he was not expecting was the pungent, metallic odour that filled his nose once the steam started rising. At first, Harry wasn’t sure what it was, but his eyes suddenly widened and he gagged on the realization that the smell was blood. Why had Malfoy been bleeding?
Harry put his phone down and unrolled his half-finished potions essay, leaving his bag on the seat beside him. He looked up as Padma Patil and Sue Li stood beside the table. “Hey guys, what’s up?”
Harry shrugged, before reaching out and taking something else from the platter as Draco returned to his book. Or, seemed to, at least.
Silence for a moment, and then Dean spoke. “She’s doing alright. I don’t think that’s the right position for her though. I reckon next year Ginny’ll move her to seeker.”
“Look,” Harry interjected. “I know this wasn’t what we all had in mind… but at least we’re back. So what’s the harm in getting to know each other. We’ve all changed since we first met, and since the War, so what’s the harm in goofing around a bit?”
Harry bit his lip, contemplating his reply. He knew coming back couldn’t have been easy after the war—especially due to his allegiance. What people
“I…” He stood there, slack-jawed, searching her eyes frantically. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He turned abruptly and hurried from the room.
Hermione’s bushy hair bounced as she threw her head back with a laugh. “You should’ve seen the look on her face! She was furious! It was war at that point. I ducked off the side of my bed when objects that weren’t pillows started flying past my head. I lost my place in my book, but it was actually quite fun. I enjoyed myself. I think we all kind of called a truce by the end. Especially when we had to lump all of our belongings in the middle of the room at the end to sort it together because everything was mixed up.”
“A little,” Harry admitted. “The Slytherin guys aren’t very well liked by everyone else, so that was a bit of an issue. Blaise is cool though, seems nice enough.”
Seamus looked at Dean, who only shook his head before dropping his gaze. When he looked backup he was smirking. “Have you payed any attention to Seamus and I? At all? Because… well…”
Faith turned to Harry. “He’s right. I know that you three saved the Wizarding World. That’s Neville Longbottom over there… he killed the bird!”
,” then pressed it to the exposed skin. The blood came away on the cloth and Harry stood from his stooped position to stare at Draco’s face and neck.
“I don’t care if he isn’t fine,” said Wayne, speaking for the first time in a while. “He was a Death Eater. He
He handed it to Harry, his fingertips brushing Harry’s palm. Harry sucked in a breath through his nose, then tried to hide it by clearing his throat. “Thanks.”
Harry pulled a face. “Who do you take me for?” Ron smiled, then went back to staring at Hermione’s book. Harry’s phone lit up again. ‘He helped me through the aftermath of a nightmare where I relived something awful that happened to me. He’s always checking on me. He keeps telling me he knows I’m not okay and that I should talk to someone. But idk how. I’ve just always been told that I should just take it and I deserve it anyways but it just hurts so bad. And I can’t show it outwardly. I can’t ask for help. I just can’t. I’ve never been like that. I guess that’s because nothing was ever this bad, it was just trivial things. But the last few years have been cruel. Ik it’s not just me. So many people are suffering, so why shouldn’t I? If they can all deal with it, I should just do it on my own, too. It shouldn’t matter what I’m going through, right?’
Miraculously, Harry slept with no nightmares. He expected to dream about the war, however, being in a new environment in the castle that he’d never seen before might’ve had something to do with it. He smiled to himself upon that realization, pondering how he’d gotten that lucky. His smile faltered, however, when he wondered if everyone had had the same luck.
badges and ‘Weasley is Our King’ both proved his creativity, even if he was being a creative little shit. But now he was showing it to Harry through his drawings and doodles. He knew he had been clever to be able to figure out a loophole to complete his mission in sixth year, but now he was showing it through his homework, his studies, and how he managed to stay alive during Voldemort’s stay in his home. He was clearly ambitious and competitive before, based on quidditch games, but now he was taking 7 NEWTS while he’s dealing with other struggles, as well as trying to beat Hermione out for the top grade.
“I think that’s his point,” said Ron, nodding. “If we’re gunna spend a whole year with them, we should all know each other.”
The portrait swung inwards, like how the one in Gryffindor tower did. The old witch stepped inside, beckoning for the rest of them to follow her inside. Once this was achieved, smiles graced many of their faces. The common room was mainly stone and wood, with a large fireplace on one end of the room. In front of it sat a wooden coffee table surrounded in a semi-circle with a long couch and two chairs. On the far left was a large bay window with a sill, as well as a few small tables and one long one beside it. On the immediate right on the door they had just come in was an enormous bookshelf, which Hermione grinned at, eyes sparkling. In the middle of the room, on a purplish-grey carpet were two long couches and two armchairs, which formed a circle. A couple of end-tables sat with them, as well. And finally, a spiral staircase with a gold-coloured railing led to where they could all only assume was their dormitories.
Hermione smiled. “That’s really cool. If you want some, I could take you out to muggle London sometime. While we’re at it, I could show you some other fashion type things you’d probably like.”
Harry nodded, shrugging his robes on. “That’s true. I just feel really bad when I wake people up because I know how hard it is for some of us to sleep at all.”
He stopped between his bed and Malfoy’s, contemplating. The boy looked so peaceful reading, unlike how he’s seemed since the sixth year. He didn’t seem on edge now, or like he was carrying the world on his shoulders at sixteen years old… However, something still nagged at Harry. He tossed his toothbrush onto his bed and padded over to Malfoy’s. Hesitantly, he tapped him on the shoulder.
But he probably wouldn’t do it. He thought that he was just talking to some random guy who was giving him advice. And he had very particular opinions about Harry.
The group nodded then turned back to each other. Harry pointed his wand at Draco, who went cross-eyed. “What are you doing Harry?”
Hermione eyed her with an amused smile as she swallowed a mouthful of toast. “We’ve found that out.”
By this point, Draco was mostly recovered. He was breathing almost normally again, and the trembling had mostly subsided. He leaned back against the wall, raising his head, though his eyes were closed. Harry watched him as he swiped at his eyes, sniffling, his face red, blotchy, and tear streaked. His chest tightened at the sight. Without looking at him, Draco spoke. “You can leave… you should get back to bed…”
Harry squinted over at them, then rolled his eyes. “Fine. We’ll bring them in to practice their positioning on defence. Happy?”
Draco’s face softened and he dropped his gaze. “Just go.” Harry nodded, leaving the room wordlessly, and leaving Draco alone with a tightness in his chest and throat that he couldn’t get to leave.
As the bridge came to an end, Harry stepped further into the room, leaving the other two staring from the doorway. “Amen,” Harry belted, causing Dean and Michael to look up at him with shocked smiles. He danced over to them as Seamus hopped off his bed and followed.
As the boys headed to bed that night, many of them were goofing around. Blaise and Draco sat together on the latter’s bed, joking about something that had happened in between classes that day. Justin, Seamus, and Terry were stacking pillows on Michael’s back, stealing as many as they could before he woke up. Theo and Tony were standing by Ernie’s bed, the three of them discussing classwork (or at least that’s what they said), but many of the other’s assumed they were really discussing a prank they’d overheard one of the younger Slytherin girls was planning.
Malfoy rolled onto his back to look at Harry, book resting on his chest. He raised his eyebrows. Harry cleared his throat. “You should sleep.”
Harry loaded some eggs onto his plate as Ron poured them both some juice. He handed Harry his goblet as he spoke. “So what exactly happened last night?”
Harry only nodded as the other boy left, staring at the empty doorway. “Okay.” He shook his head to clear the thought, then turned and slipped on his tie. A fist pounding on the door reached his ears and he sauntered over to it, poking his head out.
She rolled her eyes. “Wipe that smirk off your face, Malfoy, and take the compliment.” He only laughed as he watched her attention shift to Harry. Within seconds his hair was a light brown, which oddly suited him. Hermione’s eyes widened as she took him in. “That actually looks good on you!”
He only looked away when a pillow came hurtling at Dean, smacking him in the face. “Enough with the music,” Theo groaned.
“Wow, you got all that from sorting your stuff? What kind of shit did you guys throw at each other?”
Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “Whatever we were before the war, can we just forget about it? I saw you in pain, and I wanted to help.”
Harry shuddered as the door swung shut, the thoughts ghosting over him and mingling with his reality. He held his hand up in front of him, surveying his fingers. He flipped it over and stared at his palm, then dropped it, startled by the crackling of the fire. After extinguishing it, Harry took a deep breath, then hurtled up the stairs.
Draco Malfoy: ‘Hey. I just wanted to thank you for the advice. The same guy as before had a nightmare last night and I went and checked on him.’
Ron flushed a bright red from the tips of his ears to his chin, stuffing his book as close to his face as he could. Harry knew that feeling, the one of wishing the world would swallow you up whole… He bet that Malfoy was feeling it, too. He watched as Malfoy looked back up at Ron’s hidden face, and relief washed over him. Harry bit his lip as he watched him, sure Malfoy thought he wasn’t watching.
With that he put his phone away and returned to his essay. A few moments later footsteps pattered down the stairs and over to the table. Draco strode towards them, a book and supplies under his arm, still wearing his school uniform, minus the robes. Harry removed his bag from the chair next to him and put it between his feet. He sat down, mumbled a hi to Harry, and looked across the table to Hermione. “You wanted to study Ancient Runes?”
“Stop that!” Harry glared as Draco snorted, then shook his head as he headed back to his bed. He glanced back over at the other boy. “Night, Malfoy.”
Blaise shrugged. “I don’t know, honestly. Probably not. I think he’s struggling just like everyone else.”
Harry sat back on his haunches, hands up. “I—sorry…At least… just… talk to someone. Even if it’s not Blaise or me.” Draco avoided looking at Harry, reigning in the anger from his outburst. He swiped at his eyes, engulfed in silence. “Goyle’s wrong by the way. I remember what happened. It wasn’t your fault… Please don’t blame yourself.” He was still silent. “I’m going to dinner. But, I’m here, if you need someone.”
Draco shrugged, not looking up as he spoke in a pretend nonchalant voice. However, it wasn’t very effective, as it broke at the end. “A lot of things are my fault…”
Harry glanced around the room as McGonagall retreated to her quarters and the rest of the class slowly resumed conversation. He watched as Draco rose back to his seat, hair falling into his face. Blaise came around to his side and crouched beside him, but Harry couldn’t hear what he was saying. Pansy had a hand on his back. “I’m fine, Blaise,” he said. He wasn’t looking at him.
Harry and Ron took their seats in the Great Hall while there was barely anyone there. Draco sat alone at the Slytherin table, a few Hufflepuffs were eating cereal at their table, and Ned and Faith sat together down the other end of the Gryffindor table, chatting over their pancakes. McGonagall gave Harry a questioning look as she talked to Professor Flitwick, and glanced over at Draco with the same one. Harry followed her gaze, momentarily wondering why he was up so early, especially after the events of the previous night. The thought quickly left, however, as Harry remember the troubles the other boy had with sleeping.
“Shut it, Ron,” Harry laughed, shoving his pillow at him. He ducked as he began speaking, the pillow flying back over his head. “I don’t know how to explain them all, but there’s a variety.”
Once again, he thought about how odd this was. But at the same time, he also recognized that he didn’t care anymore. Whatever had been their old relationship, the war had turned it upside down. It had flicked a switch in him, the events, the stress, the reality of what his parents had instilled in him, the torture, the loss… all of it. It had been hard on him, too. After all, they were
Draco shook his head at himself, then rested it against the wall. It had to be Harry Potter that came in, didn’t it? Of all people… He chuckled lowly to himself, swiping at his eyes again. Blaise he would have expected… he’d had an eye on him recently. Even Theo. But not Harry. That was the last person he was expecting to see when he finally looked at the person who’d comforted him… He wasn’t one to accept comfort, often. Especially not when he felt he didn’t deserve it. And now he’d shown him weakness, vulnerability… to the one person he’d thought would never be the one to be there for him. Of course, though, it
Eyes at the Slytherin table went wide as they stared at the sweet looking girl in front of them. Of course, many of them remembered being so young an innocent, it was only that none of them felt that way anymore. Alice blinked at them, confusion evident on her face. She didn’t quite realize what was going through the heads of her peers… the first student sorted right after the war, the war started by Slytherin supremacists, and not fought against by many Slytherin students, was one of them. However, unlike past years, there was no booing. Only stunned silence.
Ron Weasley: Can u help me out? Had to give some kids detention for hexing Draco while we were patrolling. He’s fine but bloodied up, so I sent him back to the common room. Can u help clean him up?
Draco raised an eyebrow with a breathy, humourless laugh, looking Harry in the eyes. “Are you kidding? I already have it.”
The common room door opened and in strode the Slytherin quidditch team. Daphne came though first, blond ponytail falling out. She waved at Pansy, grabbed some food from the platter laid out for them, then jogged upstairs. Blaise followed suit, and Draco emerged from behind him. Harry watched as he looked around the room, then flashed a smile at Harry when he saw him. Harry waved.
Harry grinned. “Alright now, who’s ready to get started on our first practice, I guess, since we don’t need to do trials. Ginny and I have been working on some new drills and plays for this season, and I have a really good feeling about them.”
!” Him and Justin had been duelling fiercely, and they both had to move diligently to avoid getting hit.
“I told you,” Harry stated as Hermione looked up at the two of them. “I’m not going to mess with him. I think something’s up.”
“I’ll testify again,” Harry insisted, to which Hermione only gave him a sad smile. “What’s next? Dragging Draco into it again?”
“Me, as well,” said Blaise. “I just… I don’t want to say anything about it and freak either of them out.”
Draco sat bolt upright with a gasp, shoving himself back against the wall, staring straight ahead. He was panting, eyes wide. His jaw quivered as his eyes watered, swallowing thickly. He attempted to supress the first one, but quickly broke down in sobs. Startled, but not surprised, Harry slung his arm around the boy’s back. Draco struggled at first, pulling away from the comforting arm. “I’m f-fine! Leave me alone!”
Ron shrugged, looking behind him at Harry and Neville for their opinions. Neville contemplated it before speaking. “He probably wants us to stay used to it, instead of getting rusty, or avoiding it altogether. The longer we wait, the more nervous we will get. You know?”
The Hufflepuff tabled cheered as their, apparently, second student of the sorting joined their table. Harry had missed the first, and apparently another Ravenclaw as well.
“It’s a talent,” he laughed. “But obviously, this one wasn’t me. Seemed to be coming from one of the seventh years at the bottom.”
“A bit of both,” said Harry, rubbing his neck. “I didn’t know what to do. I remember dropping next to him in the bloody water, no clue how to fix it. He was bleeding out right in front of me, and the look on his face… God. Ron, I don’t ever want to see that look on his face again. I don’t care who he is.”
He nodded, staring at the thin cloth shielding him from his thoughts. Ron cleared his throat and tore his eyes away. “Do you want anything from the trolley, mate? It’ll be by any minute.”
Harry nodded, then scooped some more eggs into his mouth. Hermione turned to the black-haired girl. “Well, you’re welcome to sit here whenever you want.”
Mumbling reached his ears and slowly became clear. The rest of the boys were up getting ready for classes. Showers were running, a toilet was flushing, trunks opening and closing, groggy early-morning conversations…
Professor McGonagall’s robes billowed behind her as she swept around the corners of the corridors. The eighth-year students followed her eagerly, excited, yet nervous to see their new arrangement. Turn after turn they made, the architecture catching their eyes as it had always done… although now it had a newer feel. And an intimidating reminder as well.
“Those are the scars I left… Snape said he got lucky. He could’ve died. He lost so much blood that day…”
A small smiled graced Draco’s lips as he flicked his wand, light dancing from the tip. “I appreciate it.”
Hermione raised her hand and he pointed to her. “A jinx is benign dark magic, meant for minor inconvenience. A hex is slightly more severe and can inflict some harm, and a curse is dark magic meant to inflict serious harm on the victim.”
Back at his bed he stuffed his toothbrush away, then opened his trunk and grabbed his robes. Once his pants were on, he drew his curtains back and sat on the end of his bed. Ron emerged then, clad in a towel around his waist. After a moment inside his curtains he returned.
“No. His Aunt and Uncle despise people like us. They treated him real bad, and they hid it from him. Even tried to hide his Hogwarts letter.”
Hey all, I'm so sorry for disappearing for literal months. My mental health fell through a wormhole or something, I broke up with my boyfriend of two and a half years, was dealing with summer school and barely passing and then fell down the fandom hellhole of a show that really helped pull me out of a dark place. So I'm very grateful for the Bungou Stray Dogs community because I don't know if I'd be functioning without it. I was so stressed guys, I'm 19 and my roots are grey what the hell. But I am back and excited to see where this story goes! As promised, here is an update, and I very much hoped that you enjoy it.
“I’m Justin. There’s nothing interesting about me. I’m literally boring as hell and can’t make a joke to save my life. But I could probably out-eat
Blaise looked at Harry, eyes pleading. Harry interjected. “Everyone, shut up!” The boys all turned to him, startled. “You guys don’t know anything about the behind the lines of the war, okay? I’m not going to go into it, but I owe him my life. And his mother. Now, we’ve been rivals the entire time we’ve known each other, but if I can play fair, so can all of you! We have to stick together… you need to understand that. This year is about moving past everything. Inter-house friendships and cooperation.”
Harry turned to Ron, who was trying to turn vinegar to wine. Harry remembered Hermione doing it in sixth year, and laughed when all Ron achieved was creating ripples in the clear liquid. “Go on then,” Ron chided. “You try it.”
Justin turned to him, pushing a piece of dark hair off of his forehead with annoyance. “Ron. This is our third game and I haven’t won one yet.”
Harry bounded up the stairs to the nearly empty dorm. As he entered Malfoy glanced up from his book at him, then continued reading wordlessly. Harry turned his back to him as he searched his trunk for his textbook. Shaking his head, he stood, going to his nightstand instead. It wasn’t there either. But as he turned, brows furrowed, he caught a glimpse of the cover between his nightstand and his bed. “Aha,” he whispered, picking it up. “Found you, you bugger.” Behind him, he thought he heard Malfoy snort, but when he turned around the boy’s face looked exactly the same as it had before.
She flipped a few pages in her book, turned it towards him and pointed at a line of runes. “I’m having trouble interpreting it. Want to give it a try?”
“Struggling with what?” Terry voiced. “The fact that his racist family lost the war of pureblood supremacists?”
The group stopped in front of a stool at the front, where the Sorting Hat, battered but intact, perched. Professor Sprout took her seat at the staff table, and McGonagall held up a piece of parchment.
Harry went back to his cereal, snorting as he watched Seamus down the table slap Neville in the face with a sausage. He squinted at them, wondering how on earth he was friends with them. Ironically, of course. He loved them, all of the boy’s he’d spent the last eight years with.
“Yeah.” At Blaise’s expectant look he continued. “Honestly. I was a bit rattled at first, but I’m alright. Why do you keep checking on me?”
Ron let out a burst of laughter, but he had a genuine smile on his face. “You don’t even know how to play yet!”
Harry startled as a noise reached his ear, although he couldn’t quite place it at first. He listened harder, dropping the map onto his stomach. Somewhere in the room, a sniffling noise was echoing. After another minute, Harry frowned, realizing that it wasn’t some sort of cold—one of the boys was crying. He didn’t know who, couldn’t recognize it as one of the Gryffindor boys. Besides, they wouldn’t cry by themselves in the middle of the night when they thought no one would hear them. Seamus and Dean would be together, and Ron or Neville would come to him. They always did, even if Harry wasn’t always the best at comforting people. He tried his best, though.
Ron sighed. “I guess the people who post this stuff online have just gotten lucky. Your turn, Harry.”
And as many times as Ron had reassured him… he couldn’t stop the suffocating feeling that he was somehow no longer a part of the only true family he’d ever had—because he tore it apart. And Colin… too young to die, had snuck back into battle to fight for him, and Harry hadn’t been able to stop him. Hadn’t been able to save him. And by the time he knew about Colin, he was already dead.
“Cool.” Dean turned to look backwards over his shoulder at the rest of the room. “OI! All you lads, yeah, Ernie, you too. Come sit over here with us. We’ve got some Weasley products to try out and some weird candies to help us make fun of each other.”
Harry glanced up at the Slytherin table, searching for the familiar blond head. Malfoy sat with Pansy and Blaise, pushing food around his plate. It was virtually untouched. Harry turned back to his friends. Hermione had a textbook in front of her plate, eyes rapidly scanning the words. How she took information in that fast always baffled him. Beside him, Ron had already finished one sandwich and was working on the second one. He looked up at Harry, eyebrows raised.
He stepped into the bathroom for the first time, scanning it. There was a row of sinks on the left hand side, across from a row of six toilet stalls. Straight ahead of Harry were six more stalls, this time for showers. They had tall white doors which matched the small tiles covering the floor. All of the showers were occupied, so Harry figured they were filled by the boys he hadn’t yet seen: Ron, Seamus, Malfoy, Blaise, Terry, and Michael.
Dean scoffed. “Merlin, Harry. Spend less time laughing at Ron and watch her. She’s an amazing flyer. She was showing Jimmy a few of her moves during practice.”
Harry nodded, eyes staring into his lap as he shook his head. “Something doesn’t seem right with him, Blaise.”
He wrenched his eyes open, glaring at the Dark Mark on his forearm. At the scars above and below it… the ones overtop that had become thin, white lines instead… At the chunk of angry, red skin that reformed every time he tried to cut it off. Eyes furious, loathing the brand of evil, of the choice he didn’t get to make for himself, he summed a razor. Draco stuck the corner into the red mark, then dragged it upwards, slicing underneath the skin. The snake could still be seen underneath—he dug deeper. Blood filled his palm and ran down his arm and leg, washed down the drain by the fierce pressure of the water. Finally, it severed, falling to the floor of the stall, leaving his arm searing and leaking fervently. He banished it, still cradling his arm. However, no matter how hard he tried to get away from it, to escape evil’s shadow, he wasn’t Peter Pan. He couldn’t get away, and the Dark Mark appeared in the same spot it would be for the rest of his life.
Both teams got in their positions. Harry rose above the rest of them, Draco across from him, waiting for Hermione to yell ‘go’ at Seamus. Once she did, and he released the balls, the Slytherin chasers were off to the races, the Gryffindor chasers blocking them to the best of their abilities. Ron blocked a quick shot, knocking the quaffle to Demelza, who passed it to Dean, who passed it to Ginny. Daphne quickly won it back after Goyle sent a bludger Ginny’s way, and Daphne dropped it to Blaise beneath her. Jimmy nodded at Maya, who held the bat in a shaking hand, swung the incoming bludger, and knocked it straight at Blaise, who tucked up and rolled, but lost the quaffle, dropping it to Dean. Harry smiled as he watched, nodding at Maya’s quick learning from Jimmy. Dean sped through the Slytherin chasers and tossed the quaffle to Ginny, who tucked it in the left hoop. Hermione and Seamus cheered.
He was silent all day. Whenever Harry saw him in class or in the halls, his head was bowed, no words ever crossing his lips. He never saw him in the Great Hall either, for that matter. Not at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Not once.
Hi everyone! Thanks for reading another chapter. I hope you enjoyed it. Definitely let me know what you think! Until next time. - Emma :)
“Harry!” The hiss of a boy’s voice caught his attention over the noise of the students shuffling out of their seats along the long classroom. He turned to see Blaise staring at him.
He thought about that for a moment, handing her another handful of ingredients. “Happy. I knew something was wrong and pursued it, and now he’s opening up to me. I can support him more, now that I know what’s going on.”
“I agree,” said Ron. “She was able to email all of the eighth-year prefects our new round schedules right away!”
Harry surveyed the room to see what the other boys were up to. The Hufflepuff boys were sitting on the far side of the room, talking quietly. Malfoy was laying on his stomach on his bed, his nose buried in a book. Goyle was annoying Blaise, who sat with his arms crossed on the edge of his bed. Terry Boot was seemingly playing a game on his phone, as was Theodore Nott, and the other Ravenclaw boys were talking amongst themselves.
Blaise blew air into his cheeks, then let it out. He looked up at Harry. “No. But he wouldn’t talk to me about it. Pushed me off when I got close enough to grab his wrist.”
Harry shook Ron’s shoulder, and when he turned, agitated, Harry pointed at the growing flame. Ron shook Seamus, and he and Dean too were soon staring at the flame. Professor Flitwick called out in shock as it began eating at the stack of books he was standing on. With a gasp, Hermione turned and shot a jet of water at it, but it wasn’t enough. Flitwick tumbled off the stack into the row of seats on the other side of the class. Hermione jumped down the rows with a few other students, who were trying to put the fire out.
Draco felt a pang of disappointment run through him, but from what part of the conversation he wasn’t sure. Probably just from missing Quidditch, he presumed. He had always had a natural talent for flying, and missed being able to show it off as the boys were describing.
Outside the curtains, the boys sat on the beds surrounding Draco’s. The adrenaline surge had kept them awake, unable to fall back asleep right away. They’d sat in small groups, lost in their own thoughts. No one spoke in the stunned silence, but the looks on their faces told that they were all thinking the same thing. It was only then that the majority of them had realized how much pain Draco was really in, especially when they heard him break down. They were all uncomfortable and shaken, hardly able to believe that that terrified, pained sound could come out of Draco… the boy they’d all thought to have it all. Maybe as a child… but during the last few years… no one really knew. But here he was, in pain and breaking down. None of them had heard anyone else in near as much mental pain… aside from Harry. They sat watching the shadows behind the curtains, listening to Harry’s incoherent voice through Draco’s cries, and praying for the heart-wrenching sobs to cease.
“It.. that’s just so like him. And I haven’t seen that side of him much lately. He always was a snarky little shit, but with us he was just plain funny. But now Goyle isn’t
She glanced down at him, contemplating. Then she closed her book and slid onto the floor. “Sure. Haven’t played that in a while.”
“The real trouble was waking him up. I tried to shake him awake but I guess he thought I was Him… he kept pulling away from me. I had to pin his arms down so I could talk without him thrashing.”
Draco sliced into his arm above and below the mark in desperation—angry red tears and gashes standing out against his porcelain skin. Five more, six more, seven… the back of his head hit the wall as he dropped the razor to the floor, bringing a hand up to his mouth to stifle a sob. His shoulders shook as he cried, hand still over his mouth so that the boys whom were starting to enter the room wouldn’t hear him. An angry, pained scream of a sob tore from his throat and his face scrunched up as he sank to the floor, watching the blood dance its way down the drain. It still flowed from his arm and he watched it from where his head rested on his knees as it left his body. He bit down on his hand to keep quiet… a silencing charm would be useless now, he couldn’t open his mouth to speak without a sound escaping that he wouldn’t want to.
Clearly, the other three tables noticed this hesitation, because soon all three tables were clapping and cheering. The staff joined in, followed, half-heartedly, by the Slytherin students.
Harry and Ron were summoned by Ginny after classes that day. They had bolted upstairs after their final class and changed from their robes into their scarlet and gold quidditch uniforms. She had been let in by Hermione and was startling the two boys within two minutes.
I am also doing one-shot commissions for multiple fandoms right now so if you are interested, leave me a comment and I will send you the link to a google form! I have also began an instagram for the other fandom I mentioned above, but it is also being used for writing updates and other miscellaneous things, so if you would like to chat or anything, send me a DM @soukokous_shared_braincell . You can also DM me there about commissions, or on my tumblr (which I hope to become more active on) destiel--loves--pie.
After a few more minutes Draco heard their plates landing on the table. Someone muttered a spell and the plates and platters vanished. He could feel Harry stretch beside him before leaning back into the couch. Either Ron or Dean yawned. Then Ron’s voice piped up. “Harry, what was that game called that we played the other day?”
Harry grinned. “Are you sending that one back to your mother, then?” He nodded. “Perfect. Can you send this with it?”
Harry was shaking his head with a smile when a thought struck him. “He used to get in a lot of shit for that from his parents, you know.”
Hermione side-eyed the girl on the floor, who was smirking up at her. She rolled her eyes, setting her closed book on the table, a hint of a smile on her lips. “Fine. Just one game.”
“We thought so too,” said Ron. “But I guess something happened between them after Crabbe died in the fire.”
Malfoy raised his eyes to meet Blaise’s. There was something present there which Harry couldn’t understand, yet wished he could. Malfoy shook his head, trying to make Blaise take them back. He wouldn’t.
“That is cute. I wish I had a younger sister.” She stabbed a sausage with her fork and brought it to her mouth. “Did I tell you Draco got a message from his number neighbour.”
Seamus and Justin were standing by his bed, and Dean was waking Ron by the looks of it. Draco watched with curious eyes as Ron emerged from his curtains, concern etched into the lines of his face.
Harry grimaced as Ron laid his hand on the boy’s shoulder, “Harry. Wake up.” He shook him gently. “Harry.”
When Thursday morning arrived, no one was quite ready to start duelling again for DADA. Not the students who’d fought in the war at least. Harry stalked through the halls with Ron towards the classroom, and Hermione had gone early to talk to Professor Spunks about how this could affect some of the class. Harry shoved his wand into his pocket and frowned at Ron, knowing he was thinking the same things as he was. Many of the other eighth years had an look of apprehension on their faces, as did a few of the seventh years as they entered the classroom.
Harry returned to the task at hand, placing two sandwiches on his plate. He took a sip of his pumpkin juice, sloshing a little over the side of his goblet when his phone buzzed.
Once they did, Ron stood, whispering that he was going to check on the two of them. He slid the curtains apart gently, stepping halfway inside. He glanced over the scene before him, concerned. Harry had his arm around Draco, who was trembling. ‘Is he okay?’ Ron mouthed.
Harry woke the next morning to Ron shaking him. “Get up, Harry! Hermione was just at the door asking if we were ready to go to breakfast.”
“Alright class,” Professor Spunks boomed, striding into the room. “I assume you all remember that we will be duelling today?” The class nodded. “Now, today we will be doing review. Just what you already know. Try your best to use silent spells, but you can verbalize if you must. But first, let’s go over some quick theory. Who can tell me what the difference is between a jinx, a hex, and a curse?”
“You wish!” Harry called back, handing the snitch to Seamus. He headed down to the centre of the pitch to start the match.
They looked at each other again, then Blaise blinked at the floor as Ron said, “Maybe. But I dunno for sure.”
Draco tentatively took the parchment from Harry’s hand and read the note, then looked back up at him. “You… you don’t have to thank her, Harry. It’s the least she could do.”
Harry hid behind a suit of armour as he watched Goyle bash into Draco, sending his small figure flying into the wall and sliding down to the floor with a thud. He looked up at the other Slytherin, dazed. “Scared, Malfoy?”
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but caught a purple bruise on the other boy’s cheekbone. “Did somebody hit you?”
“Beats me,” spat Ned. “He should’ve been sent to Azkaban. A lot of this is his fault, he would’ve deserved it.”
Luna looked at the pair of them, then nodded. “Yes, I’m alright. Was just a bit startled is all. I wanted to tell you about Draco.”
Harry felt a pang in his chest, his eyes widening. He was taken aback by this feeling and looked down at himself. He heard Hermione’s concern in her voice as she said, “Are you okay, Harry?”
Hey there everyone! I hope that you enjoyed that chapter! Let me know your thoughts, as always. Until next time! -Emma :)
Harry stared into them, quirking his head. “That would have been a shame.” Then he shook his head and took a step back, as if he’d revealed an embarrassing, intimate part of himself.
He recalled the last time that Harry had had a nightmare and how uncomfortable he’d been watching the other boy’s pain. How much he’d wished he could’ve gone to him. How his number neighbour had said to go to him anyways, and how he’d appreciate it, even though the two of them had never been friends. He’d been right, of course.
Harry glanced down the table to where Ginny sat with Luna. She waved at him and he waved back, glad that they were on such good terms. ‘
“I thought they were friends?” Hermione voiced, speaking what everyone had been thinking the previous night.
Harry’s eyes widened with realization. The bird looked almost exactly like the ones that used to be in the cage upstairs. The one by the room of requirement. The one which was now empty… Harry turned abruptly to his desk, closed his eyes and redid the spell. When he opened them again, a caterpillar inched towards Hermione. He turned back to his left. Draco was blinking furiously, looking at his desk with Pansy’s hand on his shoulder.
A few moments passed and Harry chatted with Ron and Hermione, one of Ron’s jokes causing him to almost choke on his eggs. Finally, his screen lit up and he snatched it out of their view to read it. ‘Heh… I’m not really a great person to ask about that. But I think some people just don’t want to be bothered or bother anyone else.’
Harry crouched down and put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “You did what you had to do… but you aren’t your past.”
. But he said he’s never been allowed to and… I dunno, Hermione. He told me a lot of things I bet he never would have admitted before, especially to me. And then later he texted me about it, not knowing it was me of course, but he told me he thinks he has PTSD and anxiety, which makes sense. I mean, a lot of us do. And we talked about what happens when it’s bad and what helps and what doesn’t, and how he should tell people he trusts…”
Most of the other boys were awake when Harry sat up the Wednesday morning. He’d accidentally fallen asleep with his curtains open, and could see his peers milling around the room, chatting idly as they got ready for the day. However, Harry quickly noticed that he wasn’t the only one who’d left their curtains open—Malfoy had done the same thing. His hair stuck up slightly where it hit the pillow, and he looked more relaxed than Harry had seen him in a long time. In his outstretched hand lay a novel, but what novel it was Harry could not quite make out. Malfoy was only holding onto it loosely, as if it would fall any moment.
‘I just comforted him until he calmed down. It was a really bad nightmare. Took me a few minutes to wake him up, but when I did I didn’t know what to do he was so upset. I hope I did okay.’
“I’ve never been allowed to feel. Ever. Especially not when I needed to, or needed to talk, or whenever I wasn’t okay.” Draco’s stormy eyes searched Harry’s, as if begging him to understand what he was saying and why. “The last few years have been hell for me, too, but there’s nothing I can do about it.”
Draco nodded, straining to keep a semi-straight face. “It already is,” he mumbled under his breath, but Harry still caught it.
Blaise looked over at Draco’s closed curtains, a smile gracing his lips. “More than you might ever know.”
Wednesday had been a hard day for Harry. He’d spent more time than he’d like to admit standing in front of the portraits of Lupin, Tonks, and Fred. They were beginning to emit some sounds, and Harry had taken to reading their lips. Lupin had been proud of him, as was Tonks. Fred did some sort of miming that Harry had chuckled at but not fully understood. He’d even meandered over to see the portrait of Colin Creevey, who flashed a huge smile as Harry stood in front of the small 16-year-old who would never age another year. Though it felt good at the time to see these people, he couldn’t push them and their sacrifices from his thoughts.
Harry counted them off on his fingers. “Let’s see… we have highlighters, pencils, pens, Sharpies…” He stopped when he saw both of their blank faces. “Highlighters are bright coloured ink that you put over words in a textbook to mark important stuff. And sharpies are permanent markers.” More blank faces. “Like pens… uh… they’re usually thicker but sharpies have fine points usually… but I guess Crayolas are washable so they also aren’t always permanent like pen…”
There was a unanimous round of yesses and nods among the boys. Michael spoke up. “We all just went through a war. We will need to be woken up. Harry, just go with it.”
“Okay, okay. I guess it’s only fair, since you’ve both done yours.” Harry opened his messages, brought up a new convo, then typed in his number minus one on the last digit. ‘
Harry looked at him, amused, and nodded. Then he tapped Ron on the shoulder. “Wanna partner up today?”
Harry slipped off his bed, grabbed his toothbrush from his trunk, then headed to the bathroom. As told by the large clock on the far wall, they still had plenty of time to get ready and eat breakfast. All of the boys who weren’t showering were in the room, chatting and changing.
“Great, actually! I didn’t think we’d all get on so well. But they’re such nice girls, most of them. Very different personalities, though.”
he scanned the page to see exactly were in the room everyone was located. On Harry’s left was the door to the stairs, as well as to the bathroom. On his right, the window. On the same wall as him, Wayne slept closest to the door, followed by Michael, Theo, Seamus, himself, Ron, Ernie, and Neville. On the opposite wall, Tony was closest to the door. He was followed by Justin, Terry, Goyle, Malfoy, Blaise, and Dean, who’s bed had a great view of the castle grounds.
She shook her head. “Not really. Draco just up and left, and then Blaise followed muttering something about ‘getting to the bottom of something.’ Whatever that means.”
Harry and Hermione exchanged concerned glances, then returned to their potion. They both knew what the other was thinking. They too, as had many around them, reacted similarly to things before. The realization was slightly startling, as he had been on the other side. As reluctant as he’d been, he had still been a Death Eater. But both students also were aware that he’d had it rough over the last few years, too.
Neville, Justin, and Ernie stood off to the side, with Ron standing groggily and Blaise staring from where he’d sat up in bed. They all watched as Draco pushed past them all, reaching out for Harry’s curtains. Ernie grabbed his sleeve, raising his brows. “What do you think you’re doing?”
Finally, while stirring another ingredient into the mix, she turned to Harry. “So, how’s the ‘number neighbour’ situation going?”
Hermione. I appreciate it, but I’m coping. Some days are hard, but you will either be able to tell or I’ll let you know. Yeah?”
Harry glanced back over at Malfoy after a moment, a noticed that his breathing was still erratic. He tapped Hermione’s shoulder, gesturing to the Slytherin. She bit her lip. “You could text him, ask if he’s alight,” she whispered.
A thousand images, sounds, and feelings flashed through Harrys brain. From the war, from camping, from the news, from his visions… He swallowed thickly. “Someone should go… see what’s up.”
to him like he was a normal person… a normal conversation, like he was checking in with a friend… He should’ve just told him to bugger off, but the kid was persistent as fuck, and he had to admit… it was nice. But then he’d blathered and admitted to the trip-jinx and not being able to sleep and
Ron watched as Harry drew his curtains, blocking him from everyone’s view. He sighed, not knowing what to do to draw Harry out of his own head, out of his spiral of depression and self-hatred. Stuffing his hands in his pockets he wandered over to Draco and Blaise, who were watching him with raised brows. The boys talked for a while, avoiding the topic of Harry and the chaos inside his head.
“Well, yeah! I was kind of caught up in other thoughts this summer, and was excited just to go back…”
She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. “No, Harry. Before, I would’ve found it odd, but I mean, look at me. Friends with Pansy freakin Parksinson.” Harry laughed, quirking his head in agreement. “Besides, you two aren’t that different. I think it will be good for you both, actually.”
Ron looked at Harry, who was fuming, out of the corner of his eye before turning back to his food. Hermione sighed, exasperated. “We don’t know what’s going to happen, Harry. There’s no use worrying about it until we know.”
“I find it really interesting. It’s kinda a mix of a bunch of classes, like transfiguration and potions. It teaches you about transmutation, and turning a substance into another form. My professor said it was very similar to a muggle subject called… chemistry, I think. Is that what it’s called?” He looked between Hermione and Harry, who both nodded. “Anyways, I find it fascinating.”
Draco took a sharp intake of breath, a physical pain registering in his chest. He shook his head. “Harry…” The Gryffindor was inconsolable at the moment, and he had no idea how Harry had managed to calm
Harry didn’t head to bed until late that night. He’d spent most of his evening planning Quidditch trials and new plays with Ginny. They were up until two am talking technical and tactical approaches until she could barely keep her eyes open, almost spilling a mug of tea on their carefully sculpted diagrams. Harry sent her off to bed, hoping that she wouldn’t be caught out of bed after curfew. He wasn’t sure if McGonagall, or Filch for that matter, would be more or less strict after the war.
Ron threw the door open as Harry did up his fly and he was still fiddling with his helmet. Ginny rolled her eyes at the pair, turning and walking back down the stairs. They quickly caught up to her, pushing past Blaise, Pansy, and Draco on their way out. Briefly, Harry’s eyes met Draco’s, before the other boy tore his gaze away.
He looked down at his messy scrawl, cheeks heating up as he felt Draco’s smirk beside him. “Uh, no. No, not yet. Sorry.” He peeked up and she had gone back to her work, shaking her head at his daydreaming. Then he turned to Draco, placing a hand on his arm to get his attention. His icy eyes looked into Harry’s. “Did you know I was almost sorted into Slytherin?”
After a few minutes of near silence, Harry, Ron, and Seamus decide to move closer to where Neville and Dean’s beds were on the right side of the room. Harry and Ron sat together in the windowsill, while Seamus joined Dean on his bed. The five talked about their summers, their NEWTs, Quidditch, anything other than what had just happened only two months prior.
"I can't stay here.  I've just told you, I am NOT leaving my mother alone with him.  Let me go right now or I swear to everything holy this WILL be the end of you."
The pink spots on Draco's cheeks deepened to close to crimson, his eyes dropping for a moment as his hand reached out further, opened, and the chain returned into his palm.
Tom raised one hand between them and very very gently touched his index finger to the middle of Harry's lower lip.
“We're... What?”  Draco shook his head, starting to reach for Harry's arm again.  “Stop it, we need to get you out of here.”
I always absolutely HATED how Harry approached Slughorn to get the memory from him at first.  Harry's not an idiot, I don't understand why it seemed appropriate he'd act like one and just go charging off to ask him about Horcruxes the same way Tom did.  He'd seen the memory and had seen the way Slughorn tried to hide the truth.  It was so ridiculous that he'd not even attempt to be covert in his approach and ultimately scare Slughorn away from him.  Ugh.  UGH!  In my version Harry doesn't behave like a feeble minded oaf.  ;)
His school mates all said they'd seen him during the battle, some even said they could have sworn they saw him alive at the end of it.  But when there was nary a trace of him turned up they started wondering if perhaps they hadn't seen him.  It had been the most hectic and stressful of nights.  It had been a BATTLE, after all.  They couldn't count on their memories being entirely clear.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
“You knew?”  Draco's eyes narrowed as he looked at the other man, then shook his head a bit, relaxing his gaze.  “Of course you knew, sorry.  Wasn't a secret after the war, was it.  And Potter had been there, Potter got everyone out.  Thank Merlin..”
Draco shook his head.  "No, I couldn't see them then.  I can now.  I did on the way to school this year."  He paused, chewing the inside of his lower lip for a few moments, looking at the floor, scrunching his socked toes into the rug.  "It was a bad summer."
“Draco, I...  I'm sorry...”  Harry said, turning his eyes away and exhaling a long breath.  “Really.  You're right...  You'd think I'd learn by now.”
“It's alright.”  Harry said with a nod, reaching over to squeeze Draco's shoulder for a moment, smoothing over the curve of it as he drew his hand away.  “I know what you mean.  Maybe we don't worry about the actual.. act... just yet.  If we continue as we are maybe Tom will actually ask you for something different.  I think we should focus on
Draco, once returning to his study a few hours later, had long since forgotten that he hadn't put the letter in the drawer.
Draco sighed, leaning his side against the couch, turned towards Harry.  "I wish you could come home with me."
“I just need to practice then.”  Harry said, but this time he said it with a smile.  This time he felt like this was something he was actually capable of doing and he was, he had to admit, kind of excited about the prospect of seeing if he could at least match half of Draco's apparent skill with it.
He sat up in bed, both hands clutched to his head, panting and drenched in sweat, his arms shaking as he lowered them from his now perfectly normal scar and forehead.
"When you say 'we'.  When you say we'll find a way out of this.  You actually mean you're going to help me"
“So.  This is...?”  He trailed off as quickly as he started, turning around to the Aurors behind him, all of whom seemed to smile stiffly and encouragingly at him.
“You needed more than that.”  Harry said as he moved to the window and looked out, clearly assessing where his Aurors were and whether it was satisfactory.
And he stood there frozen, suddenly realizing that with a camera crew, a mass of other people, two hosts and two judges roaming around, it was going to be a LOT harder to cheat and magic his way to success.  Doing it to GET to the competition was easy, but now maintaining it was... going to be more than tricky.
They both picked up their sacks of trinkets and carted them back downstairs.  Draco got to watch as Harry gave them both to Kreacher and told him he could decorate the basement with any that he wanted.
reformed.  Big difference.”  Draco smiled in spite of himself, tipping his head slightly and turning just his eyes so he could look up at Neville from the corner of them.
“SO sensitive..”  Draco said, smirking just a bit as he fiddled with his mug.  “Stop, Longbottom.  I'm not reformed, I'm not contrite, I'm still a Malfoy.  But I am an adult now.  And years without the influence of nasty parents, and Voldemort taking up your house space has actually softened me around the edges.”
"Hey," he said, stepping closer to the other boy, curving his palm onto Draco's cheek, brushing his thumb through one of the trails of tears.  "It's going to be okay."
“I hadn't thought about it like that.”  Harry stretched his legs out, smiling a bit and thinking for the millionth time that year just how HAPPY he was being friends with Draco.  How easy it was and how much less drama he brought compared to Ron and Hermione.  And that was saying a lot considering all the twists and turns of what was currently happening.
"My Aunt and Uncle flip out, thinking I've done something to Dudley.  Dudley thinks I've done something to him as well.  And at the time it seemed massively unfair but looking back now I understand why they thought that..  So we're having a bit of a row and then I get a message from the Ministry saying I've been expelled from Hogwarts for the use of underage magic and that Ministry Officials are going to be turning up to take my wand."
”  This time Draco's words weren't just sharp, they were venomous, all his patience for the do-gooder in front of him rapidly disappearing.
Harry was clearly very angry, and that in itself made all the noise worthwhile to Draco.  He knew why he was back, knew it wouldn't have taken that long for Harry to figure out he'd somehow gotten his wand out of his pocket.  Harry was a great many uncomplimentary and unkind things, but 'stupid' wasn't one of them.  More's the pity.
"Are you enjoying yourself playing around with Potter?" Snape said, his voice sharp and cutting.  He closed the distance Draco had left open rather quickly so he could lower his voice into a hiss.  "You seem to forget who he is and what he means to this world."
“Really...  What would happen if you did try to unsuccessfully destroy one?”  Harry spoke a little more slowly, piecing something together that suddenly started to make a lot more sense.
"And?"  Draco, on the other hand, spoke sharply.  He frowned, leaning forward in his chair again to watch Harry closely.  "Did she say anything to you?"
"Well done, Draco."  Paul said, his voice without inflection as he shook his hand.  The smile on his face didn't reach his eyes and it made Draco dislike him even more.
There was just a brief silence. Just long enough for Draco to realize it and look up again when Harry absolutely exploded.
Imagine...  People, good people like Neville, standing around the street outside his building all day.  All night.  And for what?  His safety?  The nasty Auror the day before had been the one who was right.  He should be left to take his chances.  If someone was trying to hunt him down, he deserved to be found.
“I'm not.”  Draco got to his feet as well, glad that his legs didn't shake, though they did still have a slightly jelly like feel to them.  “I thought it was fun.  There was water and bubbles and I could pretend to be horrible at it and break dishes.”
"Ass!"  Draco smacked the side of Harry's arm, getting up and brushing off his clothing, smoothing his hair again.  "That was incredibly undignified."
"I remember."  Draco said, trying to keep his voice neutral but he swallowed roughly, the very vivid memory surfacing in his mind again, his own flesh hidden under his hands twitching slightly at the recollection.
Anything Draco was about to say in response never came when he, instead, let out an involuntary hiss of pain, dropping his quill and clutching his right hand to his left forearm.  Harry stayed silent, his interest pricking but not wanting to say anything.  He'd seen how protective Draco was about his left arm.  Seen how carefully he kept the sleeve pulled so far down it almost covered his hand.  He'd seen him absently rubbing at it, but never like this.
“I didn't want to wake you up, but you slept all day yesterday.  I was getting worried about you not eating since Harry mentioned you had a... Um.. low blood sugar thing..”
Draco sighed out a long breath, rubbing his eyes that felt gritty after a night of no sleep.  He looked out the window to confirm what he had been worried about.  The sun was now much too high for him to send Mimir back out again with a reply, which meant he'd have to leave Theodore waiting until later that night.
“I said, it turned me on.”  Draco raised his head then, speaking in a normal tone as he looked into Harry's eyes not far from his own.  “Fighting with you...  Doing anything that made you mad.”  He slid a hand against the back of his head, tugging at his hair as he looked uncertainly at Harry.  “But I liked the way you were looking at me.  So hard I could practically feel your eyes like they were your hands.  So I didn't pick a fight with you.  I didn't need to.”
He looked at Harry, really looked at him.  Met his gaze and held it, measuring those steady dark eyes with his own.
"I think you need to talk to Snape."  Harry said eventually, absently reaching out to push a stray lock of Draco's hair up out of his eyes. "I mean really talk to him.  Bluntly.  Ask him why he fed false information to Voldemort.  Ask him why he made an Unbreakable Vow to help you.  Tell him you feel like there's more going on than you know.  The more information you can get the better."
He smiled at his friend then left her office, retracing his steps through the Ministry to the apparation spots, going straight to the outer gates of Malfoy Manor.  He was still leery about trying to apparate right into the Manor or on it's front step until it got the feel of him and knew he wasn't going to do anything bad.  But as he walked through the gate and up to the front door, he felt nothing but a quiet sort of contentment that he had returned, and the front doors of the Manor opened for him to enter as he came up the stairs, not even waiting for him to reach for the handle.
"And that's enough space for you?"  Harry asked the House Elf, crouching down to look into the small space where Kreacher was.  "We'll get you a cushion that fits in there to sit on."
He gave his head a shake to try and clear the memory, then turned to look when he heard footsteps.  Part of him was expecting someone else entirely.  Harry finally having played him properly, he'd send someone else to laugh at him rather than show up himself.
Oooo....  Draco's eyes narrowed and he turned himself around quickly, his back to Harry once more as he resumed working, or at least trying to work, absolutely fuming over the dismissive way the other boy was treating him.
Eventually their mouths parted with a soft noise, Harry's hand shifting through the strands of Draco's hair, letting them spill slowly from between his fingers.  But his brows knit when he saw the look on Draco's face.  "What..?"
"Even if you had instructions in your potions book, you still followed them correctly and made the best potion.  It's yours, you should keep it.  You'll need it."
It was a little awkward.  Okay, much more than a little.  Aside from the nods they gave each other at the train station, and the owls they'd sent each other recently, they'd had absolutely no interaction what so ever since Harry had been captured and in Malfoy Manor.  Which was not the best time at all.  Terrible, to say the least
“They're a matching set.”  Draco said, shifting a few things that had fallen in front of it since the last time he was there.  “The one in the shop is still there and this is it's mate here  But it's broken.”
Yawning, he dug a book out of his bag and leaned back against the stone arch as he opened it, thinking he'd read here until it got dark then decide what to do next.
"Fuck off, Potter."  Draco grumbled, knowing that he really didn't have any true reason or privilege to be in there, but not wanting to admit it.  Especially not to Harry.
Draco let out a low breath as Harry looked down.  He took a few steps back and sat down on the couch, staying quiet and just waiting.
Draco said the one word, and then ducked his head.  He knew that just that one syllable had come out with such a disappointed inflection that Harry could not have missed it.
They stayed officially married for appearances.  They were seen out together at important social functions and to see Scorpius off at school and arriving home again.  She appeared, with Scorpius who lived with her, for holidays and was perfectly gracious and an admirable actress in making all appear well in front of family.
Draco couldn't help but smile.  It was a wane smile, but a smile all the same.  “Yeah I only sort of fought against him.  At that point, Longbottom, everything I did for Voldemort's 'cause' was half hearted.  Just enough to make it look like I cared...”
Draco tried to hold onto a straight face but couldn't do it for more than a few seconds before he snorted out a laugh.  “I'm only joking.  I don't have any use for Tinder.”
"Which news?  There's always news."  Harry smiled at Ron, then up at Hermione as she leaned over his shoulder to set a plate and cutlery in front of him.
"I... wasn't invited.." Draco said haltingly, finding that just when he thought this conversation couldn't get weirder, it went right off the tracks.
"You must be so pleased."  Draco said eventually.  His voice thick but still bitter and sharp as he looked over at Harry, his eyes red and swollen, tears still trickling down his cheeks.  "Finally caught me, haven't you."
But it did smell good.  And after he had picked apart a triangle of it (oblivious to their waiter standing not far off watching him like he had tentacles instead of fingers) and could identify everything in the sandwich as something he liked, he put it all back together and settled in to eat.
Harry felt a surge of anger mixed with... something else entirely as he looked at him.  Hated himself for that ‘something else’ which was supposed to be gone.  It was supposed to be done.  It couldn’t keep coming back, but it did.
Maybe it was the situation.  It could just be the incredibly dire situation, the months of absolute torment Draco had been through.  Or maybe Draco himself was just different than Ron and Hermione.  Maybe he was more affectionate...
Harry turned to go with him, following close behind Draco, close enough to he could whisper, close enough that he could slide his fingers against the inside of Draco's palm.
"Well...  It's done now.  And the chances of anyone ever doubting that I've been given excessive detentions from Snape is pretty slim.  But if they do, he'll happily say it's true.  Has he said anything to you?"
Draco was quiet for awhile as he thought, then he nodded his head, turning to look out the window.  “That’s fine with me.  But I would like you to send me an Owl afterwards to tell me what you talked about.  I’m sure he’ll have more questions for me and I want a level playing field.”
“Isn't it, though.”  Harry sighed out a low breath, turning his eyes up for a moment then looked back at Draco.  “You will ONLY communicate with Nott, however.  And you will only do so at night when people won't see an owl swooping into or out of your window.  Your owl is free to hunt at night, as well.  I wouldn't make you try and keep him in or just use him for messages.  But if you start using him during the day we'll remove him and you'll have to communicate via Floo.”
"Why did you put him on the team then?"  Draco added a few tiny little flies around the Snape drawing, smiling a bit to himself with obvious satisfaction.
It all took about three weeks from that night for Harry to get everything together he needed and for his offer towards Malfoy Manor to be approved.  A week after that, he had deed and key in hand and was, on paper, the rightful owner of Malfoy Manor.
Neville reached into his pocket and pulled out one of the rectangular box things like what was in the window.  The screen suddenly lit up when Neville tilted it towards his face and Draco took a step closer to look at it.  “Magic?”
“Oh god, you sound like Hermione now.” Ron knitted his eyebrows together “Are you going to tell me you already have a date and then storm off too?”
He may or may not have tipped off a certain gossip seeking beetle of the story that was about to go down.
“But I haven’t-” Draco started, as he had been too distracted with following his feelings to even retrieve what he came for
Harry internally groaned at the comment, Ron didn’t exactly have a way with words and by the look on Hermione's face he could tell this wasn’t going to go down well.
He’d told his friends about the unfortunate event that had happened yesterday evening, minus the crying part. He was always open, and one to share these things with the two. He knew and had learnt there were burdens he could not carry alone, and time and time again had his friends proved he could tell them anything without judgement or fear, no matter how big or small the problem was and they would take it as seriously as the last.
Damn. Humiliation kept him grounded, sure, but slow dancing with Ron in front of their entire year? That was a bit much. Maybe he should have been the one to ask Hermione.
He slowly moved through the isles as he had been caught one too many times rushing around and he didn’t feel like getting that lecture again by that horrid Librarian.
He was lucky to not exactly have Snape on his opposing team, between Snape knowing his father and being in Slytherin he seemed to have more of an advantage to his good moods than others. Most of the time.
Hermione made a face as if she was going to say something, torn between offended and upset. Instead she grabbed at her book that had been sitting by her plate and swiftly left the table without a word.
sorry just i realised how long the first chapter is and how short this one is in comparison. I’ll work on medium chapters... if u read this far thank u.. much appreciated
Laying in his bed after a long shower, he let thoughts of Harry seep into his mind slowly. His stomach churned at the thought of pitying him, but he couldn't deny what he saw in Harry's small outbursts.
It was the fog that shrouded his feelings clearing for a few beats, long enough for Draco to recognise the deep understanding he held of the fatigue and hopelessness Harry exerted.
Harry let his legs carry him outside where dusk had settled over the fields, the tiredness and confusion moving aside to let the bubbling anger through.
“I just thought she’d mention it!” Ron stressed “And you know what? Now Nevilles asked my bloody sister to the ball. Neville.”
On top of the personal shame brought on by the group of Slytherins, he had every other regular Joe in his year whispering about his personal life. It felt invasive and was a whole nother level of teenage-angst and humiliation on top of the simple everyday events of his life. The tournament. The inevitable darkness looming overhead. The droning of his concerned friends, his snappy Potions professor always breathing down his neck.
“Found a date to the ball yet?” Draco's face broke out into an amused grin and he stood up from leaning against the wall
It was the same, hopeless feeling Draco got when he watched his father yell and shout at some poor house elf who had simply been somewhere at the wrong time.
“You know i’m happy for you. She’s just as- if not more insufferable than you. I’m sure you’ll have a grand time with her Malfoy.” Harry spoke bitterly
Draco frowned, offended that Harry thought so low of him as he would only be hanging around to pester him. It was true, but there was that little familiar regretful feeling seeping up and making his hands tingle, the same feeling he had been trying to suppress while noticing Harrys absence.
After stumbling back a bit Draco could see now that Harry was upset. Genuinely upset. It was late, he could tell Harry was tired and he could also tell he had been the straw to break the camel's back. Usually, he didn’t care. But yet there he was... caring.
“Sad, Potter. Not only are you going to die in these tournaments, you’re going to die without even having your first kiss” Draco pouted at the other which caused another short burst of laughter from the Slytherins.
He wondered if he had something to do with it, but before he could think more about the subject the abrupt laughter from those around him whipped him back to reality.
“Oh, you didn’t know? The champions and their dates are the first ones to take the floor and start the dance, so I’ve heard.” Draco stated “So do your robes match Weasleys god awful ones or are they worse?”
"What? No- I meant general. As friends- a group" Draco pinched the bridge of his nose then glanced at Pansy again "I assume you're going?"
“It’s not a big deal. Don’t worry about it Harry, it's just a dance. Not everyone is interested in taking dates anyway. ” Hermione spoke gently from beside Ron
Not that he was looking for anything in particular of course, his eyes almost straining as he looked over at the Gryffindor table which was separated by at least a dozen heads.
Harry's dim eyes met Dracos, and he could tell that it hadn’t been prior knowledge to the Gryffindor.
He reached over the table and grabbed the first thing within arms reach, a pastry of which he absentmindedly took a bite and let his eyes scan the room, filtering out the usual chatter from those around him.
Harry looked defeated, tired, his face was sullen, hair shaggy and glasses sitting slightly crooked on his face.
Draco moved himself over toward and in front of the entrance so that Harry couldn’t leave as easily, the boy finding himself surrounded by the Slytherin group.
And at the end of the day, there wasn’t anything better than a little humiliation to keep him grounded.
Harry only gave Ron a small and sympathetic pat on the back as the red-head rested his face in his hands once again.
“Don’t be so full of yourself, Potter. This bloody school is full of half-wits and mud-bloods every morning I’m basically knee deep in filth.” Draco spoke
Harry laughed at that, he’d be lying if he said the thought hadn’t crossed his mind about asking Ginny to the ball after Ron had mentioned it in passing. More of a last ditch effort really, and now even that option was gone.
She was leaning forward slightly to be able to see Harry properly, he could tell she was still worrying about him.
“Harry, I know it's embarrassing but it’s not worth missing classes for. You’re just letting Draco have the upper hand” Hermione spoke in that very Hermione tone she always had. Loving, but with a firm undertone and a realistic point of view.
Opportunity was basically knocking on his front door when he heard whispers of Harrys apparent crush on Cho Chang. That paired with the knowledge of Cedric already having asked her, it was a set up too easy to be true.
He was almost worried she was going to throw another punch his way. Not that he was scared of her of course, he still claimed that it was simply a cheap shot on her part as he hadn’t been expecting it.
“I'm just asking!” Seamus looked surprised at the small outburst and raised his hands in self defence
As he drifted off to sleep, he pictured vibrant green trees and soft grass peppered with wild flowers, the sun filtering through the drooping branches. And if that distant laughter sounded familiar, he didn’t even seem to mind.
Stumbling a bit down to the lake where silence wrapped around him like a blanket, he felt a sob wrack through his body before he even noticed all his anger had coursed through him, and now he was crying.
“Shh!” Draco took a step forward so that Harry would tone it down as they were on the path of getting kicked out
Draco hesitated a moment before he took a few steps backwards and leant back slightly to see if it was who he thought it was.
Draco just gave her a pointed look as he had almost dropped his pastry, and she cleared her throat awkwardly.
"Perhaps it’s a good thing you’re in the tournament, might give you a more honourable death” He puffed
Harry and Ron were as absent as ever, and Draco figured Hermione had taken one for the team and was gathering copious amounts of notes for her absent minded friends.
Ron watched her walk away before slowly turning back to the table, looking at the others who all shifted awkwardly after watching that encounter.
Draco had now only noticed that eye sore sitting on the desk on the far side of Harry, the golden egg reflecting brilliantly despite the muted light of the library.
Which was followed by the regret he felt for his own actions, and before the confusion started to settle in, Draco shut it down. It wasn’t something he wanted to deal with right now, the can of worms he just couldn’t release. Not in the library at least.
Draco hadn’t been there to see Harry receive the letter, so he was just going off the hope that he’d received it as Draco and his posse of five piled into the observatory, owls cooing and rustling about as they moved closer to the wall by the entrance as to be undetected by Potter at first glance.
“This is the great hero wizard, Harry Potter, huh?” Blaise piped up “Why don’t you go cry to your mother- oh.. Hang on a second”
“Bloody hell, Seamus” Ron spoke, dropping his food back on his plate like it had personally offended him.
He hated Draco. He had to keep marching forward to stop himself from turning right back around and Hexing him into next week.
It was confusing, disorientating even. He noticed how Draco watched with intent, like he was soaking up every word and movement.
“Oh yeah...if he’s not already doing it with that pitiful little mud-blood you call a friend” Draco added
Slytherin's common room was calling his name, rushing down the hallway until he was halted by a familiar set of heavy black robes.
Especially those who were unfortunate enough to attend the same year as Harry bloody Potter, where around every corner there seemed to be another problem brewing.
He had seen the frizzy haired Hermione nose deep in books in shared classes or scurrying around the hallways, throwing Draco the dirtiest of looks.
Draco found these situations less on the amusing side, instead using his insistent cruelty and bullying to fuel something bitter that had been growing and festering inside him.
Draco avoided the Slytherin common room after dinner that dreary evening, instead opting to visit the library. Partly to pick-out a herbology textbook he needed to fill in some gaps in his notes and partly because he wasn’t in the mood to entertain his friends.
Draco slipped onto the seat in the dining hall the next morning, taking up a usual spot in between two of his friends- today it was Goyle and Pansy. Pansy seemed to be everywhere nowadays, he noted. Only after they had come back from break he had noticed she had taken more of a liking to him than usual.
Ron looked between Harry and Blaise’s sullen faces, and those of his peers. He faked a stretch, yawning loudly. “I think it’s time for bed.”
“That’s because it’s not. But I don’t know exactly what. He’s always been one to hide how he feels. Drilled into him, I guess. That or he’s scared.”
Harry didn’t take his eyes off of Draco as he spoke. “I think he’s having a flashback to the fiendfyre…”
He startled, eyes searching her face before his brain fully processed her question. “Yeah! Yeah. Sorry, just… never mind.”
After about a half-hour, Harry was tired of keeping a constant eye on his wobbling ink well. He banished it. “Accio, pen,” he muttered. A black ballpoint pen zoomed from his trunk and into his waiting hand. He clicked it, then began writing once more. After a few moments, however, he glanced up after feeling like he was being watched. And he was right. Both Malfoy and Ron were staring at him. “What?”
“Nothing, Harry!” She smiled then, something glinting in her eyes. “How did the Quidditch planning go last night with Ginny?”
“I guess,” she laughed. “He’s very competitive, but we were also kind of helping each other so I guess it wasn’t that much of a competition.”
Harry glanced passed them to the blond who sat with his eyes downcast, trying to sink into the floor. He looked back at the two first-years, but Hermione had started for him. “He saved our lives from Voldemort,” she said.
Harry glanced across the hall at Malfoy, then back at Ron. “Maybe.” Out of the reach of Ron’s prying eyes, Harry typed another reply.
The Gryffindor rolled his eyes. “I’m Dean. I really love football, and I’m dating Seamus. But you all knew that already so, uh… I am actually really good at Ancient Runes even though I hate it with a passion.” He looked down to the floor at the next person.
“I’m just kidding with you.” He smiled, a breathy laugh escaping. “Not many people know but I’ve always been right behind Hermione in grades, and I genuinely enjoy school. Though, I’m really not enjoying the arse-kicking I get every single year, thank you very much.”
The room went silent for a moment, until a cough drew everyone’s attention. “I’m Blaise. Despite being in Slytherin I hate the colour green, so that’s rather unfortunate…” He gestured to his bed. “Besides that… I really like dogs. I want a beagle.”
Just then, Malfoy emerged from the bathroom. As the other boys had been, he was only covered by a white towel around his waist. Harry’s eyes slid over the boys incredibly pale skin—the amount of weight he’d clearly lost in his stomach, face, and chest. With a pang, Harry found the thin, silvery lines across the boy’s chest and stomach. Harry’s jaw dropped as he stared, eyes only moving from that spot when Malfoy’s stood still. He was raising his eyebrows at Harry. When the Gryffindor glanced back down at the scars, Malfoy’s eyes followed. He pursed his lips and shrugged at Harry, leaving him speechless as he turned and closed his curtains.
The next morning, Draco thanks his number neighbour for advice. Harry and Hermione chat in potions class and Harry is oblivious as ever.
Tentatively, he turned his attention to Harry, who was holding up a deck of cards. Muggle cards. He quirked his head, then brushed a piece of hair out of his face before it could get into his eyes. “What is it?”
He turned from the mirror abruptly, heading to the showers to wash away the terrors of the previous night. Draco turned the water on and stepped into the shower, resting his forehead against the wall as the water ran over his body as soon as the stall door was shut. Eyes shut tightly; he remembered the events of the day before. The texting… why would anyone want to talk to him? Want to get to know him? Of course, they didn’t know it was him… but if they did… And then there was Potter. He came up and actually
“Okay,” he said, but at the same time, Seamus erupted with a whooping laughter. It reminded Harry somehow of a parrot, but also of a clown you’d see at a circus. Seamus eyed them all, and Dean soon started meowing at him like a kitten. That made Seamus actually laugh, and the whooping became louder. Harry bit the inside of his cheek as he glanced at the door, praying the girls wouldn’t come and bang it down with a noise complaint.
“Thanks,” he said sheepishly. His cheeks were flushed, but Harry couldn’t tell if it was from the wind or embarrassment. Harry nodded at him and they were back to circling, having lost the snitch.
Draco smiled to himself and rolled over onto his side. Maybe he should ask this boy for advice more often.
Malfoy was sitting at the Slytherin table with the other Slytherins who had chosen to return. Among them were Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Goyle, Daphne Greengrass, Theodore Nott, Millicent Bullstrode, and Tracey Davis. It seemed to Harry as though the only Slytherin in his year whom had not returned was the one who couldn’t. His gaze strayed to the slumped figure of Malfoy. The boy who had grown up as his rival, yet during the war had turned around and saved Harry’s life. Of course, Harry had done the same in turn… but where that left them, he wasn’t sure.
Harry returned back to his phone, this time checking his messages. One from Ginny, asking about the date and time of their next practice. One from Neville—a funny picture of a weird plant in the greenhouse that he turned into a poor rendition of a meme. But hey, at least he was learning, like a lot of the students were who had never been exposed to muggle tech and pop-culture before. A section of the ministry had even been added to make muggle tech work with magic, and to develop wizarding versions of Google and social media that wouldn’t risk exposing their secret to the rest of the world. He laughed inwardly at the thought of his schoolmates using a wizarding Instagram or Snapchat—he could see it now. Hermione posting on her snap story a picture of all her textbooks followed by the timestamp, 3:00am. Awkwardly cute photos of Seamus and Dean, or Deamus as they all jokingly called the pair, on Instagram. Draco posting a selfie with a snarky caption, or maybe, just maybe, a picture of how he preferred to be… bundled up in a sweater by the fire reading a book, his hair loose with no gel, as he had so often been wearing it for the last few years.
A scrawny boy with mousy hair clambered onto the stool. He stared into the crowd for a second, then closed his dark eyes tightly. The hat paused, muttering to the boy, who shrugged. “Gryffindor!”
‘No one’s been interested. Thought they knew me already, or just didn’t care enough. Friendship isn’t what they wanted.’
Harry poured himself some Pixie Puffs and immediately tucked in. Hermione looked up at him from her textbook. “Are you feeling better today, Harry?” He glanced up with raised brows. “Well, you weren’t yourself yesterday and Ron told me about last night…”
She rifled through her bag and produced a few sheets. To Harry’s surprise, he picked up his spare pen, and started drawing on the page. Hermione watched him curiously, as did Harry. He worked silently for a few minutes, before turning the sheet back to Hermione. She studied it, then circled a part. “I think the rest of it is right, but I don’t know about this part here…” She watched him as he tapped the pen against his chin. “Geez, Draco. Aren’t you hot in long sleeves? It was hot out today.”
he was so stupid! People had never necessarily been a big fan of him, but at least then he was spending more time on his feet than on the floor. Now he was being forced to hear what everyone else had to say about him and his family… he hadn’t chosen that fate! It had chosen him… But he supposed he deserved it… Hadn’t he made some hurtful remarks to others before?
“And lastly, to my eighth years, once again. I ask you to please stay behind after the feast has ended. I will be leading you up to your new dormitory, as we do not have room for another dorm in your old ones. The staff and I have worked incredibly hard on it, so we sincerely hope it is to your tastes. And with that, let the feast begin!”
The trio entered the potions classroom together, taking their seats as they laughed at Ron, who stumbled over a chair. Harry and Hermione slid into a table together, with Ron in front of them. Slughorn was writing on the blackboard at the front, his messy scrawl covering the entire thing. Today’s potion would clearly take a while, and Hermione pulled out her materials and began taking notes. Reluctantly, Harry copied her, taking down his hints and other anecdotes on a piece of parchment. Most of the class did the same as they settled in. Malfoy was the last one to enter the room, plopping down alone in the seat across the aisle from Harry as the bell rang.
Harry shrugged. “Honestly, Ron, I have no idea. It wasn’t something I expected from myself either… I just… I can’t stand to see anyone in pain, you know that. And especially after the war, and after how he was living and used by Voldemort, and Crabbe dying and I just
Hey everyone! Let me know what you think! The next chapter should be coming very soon! Until next time. -Emma :)
“See you,” Ron said. Harry said nothing. Ron waved a hand in front of his eyes, snapping when that didn’t work.
“Dammit, Ron!” Harry turned to Justin and Ron, watching Ron’s smug face as he took Justin’s king. Justin turned to Harry. “He’s a cheater, I’m tellin’ ya!” But he didn’t mean it, his smile was too genuine.
Harry spots something weird getting ready for class, Hermione tells the boy's about antics in the girls' dormitory, and Harry discovers his unlikely number neighbour.
As Harry stood to leave with Ron, Malfoy emerged from his curtains. The boys all froze, staring at him silently. Malfoy glared at them, icy eyes penetrating them. “WHAT,” he bellowed. “Can I not just brush my bloody teeth? Can’t I do
Ned glanced up at Ron. “A lot of us do. Well, at least, the one’s who grew up as wizards or have older siblings. I don’t mean to sound rude… it’s just intimidating. Being a Gryffindor. I don’t know if I can hold up what you guys have left for me.”
