"Budge over," Draco said, already climbing into bed next to Harry. Harry moved over a bit and Draco leaned his head onto his shoulder. Harry's heart hammered in his chest.
“Okay,” Draco murmured.
They both didn't have classes in the afternoon and had decided to spend their punishment in the library.
Harry seemed like he was ready to blow up Draco suddenly noticed as he took in Harry's flushed face and tight grip on his book.
"That isn't the point. Being around someone often causes people to become closer, and feelings to start."
He picked at his breakfast as he tried to list who had what colors in his head. Draco, Hermione, Ron, Seamus, and Dean were red. Ginny, Luna, Hannah Abbott, Pansy, and Neville were pink. Blaise, Susan Bones, and Madam Pomfrey were blue. And he could make out a couple greens in the sea of students, though he didn't know any by name. He briefly wondered what his color was.
Draco sent him a small smile and a thanks in return and Harry's heart swelled. Harry quickly looked around and then grabbed Draco's hand, giving it a slight squeeze.
"Malfoy," Harry responded, poking his food, slightly angry at Draco for ignoring him.
"I still can't believe that we hang out with them now," Ron said, shaking his head in disbelief, "Especially you and Malfoy."
"I dare you to kiss Harry." Draco looked at her, shocked and Pansy shoved him towards Harry.
"Veritaserum and amortentia were supposed to cause you two to confess your feelings towards each other when you drank it, but instead it blew up!"
"I'm not."
"What's the highest thing on your bucket list?" Harry finally asked after an hour of silence.
"Well don't get used to it. No one is here yet and I've been getting weird looks sitting alone like this," Draco grumbled.
"Yeah, okay," Harry said, glad to finally shut the textbook. Though it wasn't like he was reading it much anyway.
"Sure."
"What?" Harry asked, smiling at the crooked grin on Draco's face as he pulled back.
"I love you too," Hermione said back. Ron could feel her smile against his lips.
Harry spluttered in indignance and a few people looked over at him, he blushed red before lowering his head and hissing back, "I'm not stalking him."
"Make it one!" he heard Blaise shout behind him as he closed the door.
Ginny grabbed onto the bottle and set it down in the middle, giving it a good spin.
Harry groaned, "I'm not stalking him, I just happen to be looking at him... whenever you look at me."
"It's been alright I guess. I mean, it could be worse, we haven't gotten in any major fights yet so I suppose that's good."
"Wow, I was in that group you know," Blaise said, pretending to be wounded.
"That's the thing, you don't know me, I would have taken it."
"Yeah, funny that is. Weren't following me now where you Draco?" Blaise laughed.
"Harry-" Draco started to say, but Harry cut him off.
"Hey! I'm just surprised, I wasn't expecting that," Ron said finally recovering, "Since when?"
"I'm eating before setting this up next time," Draco groaned, flopping down and grabbing food from the mound Harry had brought from the kitchens. "It's practically lunch by now."
They walked down to the Great Hall together, engaged in light conversation on the way down. When they entered the Great Hall they split to go to their respective tables. Ron raised an eyebrow at Harry as he sat down and Hermione didn't miss how Harry sat in a way that would give him a perfect view of the Slytherin table.
"You're just what? Watching him? All-day long? Following him around? What do you want to call it, take your pick."
Draco quickly got out of bed and rushed over to him, calling his name. When Harry didn't wake, he reached out and gently shook his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, are we really surprised? This is Potter we’re talking about here,” Pansy said.
"Oh," Harry said, and then suddenly he had an idea. He quickly stepped in front of the door, successfully trapping Draco in the room.
"Alright, well, there should still be some time before we start games and such if you want to work more. I'm going up to shower," Harry said, already heading up the stairs. Draco watched him go until his body disappeared.
"Good morning," Harry replied. His voice was a little husky from sleep and Draco liked the sound of it.
"Are you actually going to do something this year?" Pansy asked.
Draco let out a sigh and picked at the side of the table.
Draco looked over to find Harry grinning as Filch walked past, his face glowed with joy and his eyes seemed to glow in the moonlight and Draco fell more in love with him in that moment, if that was even possible.
"Well last night Ron and I.... hung out... and," Hermione started to say, and that's when it finally hit him. Draco was right, or at least partly, Ron and Hermione had been up late cause they were- ugh, he didn't want to think about it, he got the gist and he understood why they were glowing so bright this morning.
Harry laughed and wrapped his scarf more snugly around Draco.
He remembered his stash of hangover potion in his bedside table and sat up to get it out. By the time he had downed a bottle, he could hear Pansy groaning as she woke up. Draco passed down a bottle of the potion to her wordlessly.
"Truth or Dare?" Harry said, not meeting his eyes.
Ron's voice snapped him out of his reverie, "You coming mate?"
They sat hours later next to a small fire Harry had made, leaning against the cave wall and each other.
Harry blushed at that as Hermione shot a glare at Ron. "It's not like that, Ron. I already told you. I dated Ginny, remember?"
The notebook was a garish sparkly pink book that Pansy had showed up to school with after summer break in second year, and proclaimed it would be for any plans they made. Pansy always brought it to school every year even though it remained mostly empty..
Harry nearly choked again and Hermione looked at him funnily. Where was I for all this? He wondered.
"Too true. Keep on being unladylike, maybe you'd actually get a girlfriend," Blaise smirked and Pansy elbowed him in the ribs.
-------------------------
"Would-" Draco started but then caught sight of Blaise and Neville at a table across the diner, holding hands across the table.
Harry blushed, "Didn't have time to change and didn't want it to seem suspicious if they caught me leaving. You look really nice though, I missed you."
"That wasn't what I was about to say, though you are being awfully defencive."
"You'll regain your youth soon I'm sure." Draco glared at him.
Draco raised a brow, making his voice as serious as possible before saying, "I don't know, that sounds pretty dirty, Harry," and then burst out laughing.
Harry let go of Draco’s hand to unbutton his suit, Draco walking slightly ahead of him.
I don't have a lot of time to write as my mother is calling me down now for breakfast, but I wanted to tell you Happy Christmas.
The terrified girl walked up to the stool and placed the hat on her head, "Hufflepuff!" it shouted and the girl immediately looked longingly at the Gryffindor table before walking towards the Hufflepuffs.
That couldn't be though, he had liked Ginny and Cho. Both of them were definitely girls.
"Any idea who you'll take, mate?" Ron asked.
Harry looked up and saw the waitress had come back with their drinks and she looked utterly shocked. Harry and Draco both coughed awkwardly and pulled their hands away from each other as the waitress put the drinks down and hurried off, shooting them glances the whole way across the room.
November 16, 1998
"Please? We went to the Slytherin ones," Harry begged, "It will be a quick way to pass the time! Plus, we went to the Slytherin ones."
"Must I remind you that The Dark Lord nor your father would accept that as an excuse to be befriending her."
"Well you were in Slytherin and you're a pureblood and extremely annoying. We figured you were a great candidate."
"Can I sit here today," Draco asked, fidgeting a little and Harry realized that he was nervous. Draco being nervous is rather cute, Harry thought before shutting the whole idea down. He was forced back into the present when he realized Draco was still talking, "Pansy and Blaise are driving me a bit crazy today."
Hermione and Ron tried to talk to him at breakfast, but Harry wasn't interested and Hermione noted that Harry sat with his back to the slytherin table.
"Is that what everyone thought? That I was dating her?" Draco asked laughing, "Nah, I never dated her, plus she likes girls. Er- don't tell anyone that though please, she'd skin me for telling you."
Harry groaned as he realized his head probably hurt from hitting it on something on the way down.
A sort of sad expression took over Draco’s face for a moment before he seemed to shove it away, “No, I don’t think I’m even going to go,” Draco finally said with a sigh. Harry couldn’t read the look on his face.
Just because he's nice to you doesn't mean he likes you. You're friends, or you were until you kissed him.
"What!" Harry said and shot up into a sitting position, suddenly wide awake.
"Really?" Hermione asked.
"What do you mean?" Harry said, looking up from his eggs and bacon.
"Ginny," Harry said, gently grabbing her arms, "Your family is the most loving one I've ever seen. I'd be surprised if they didn't accept you."
"Your face says it all, so who is it?" George pestered.
It was like the floodgates of noise had opened, the entire hall filled with the sound of metal clanking and the heavy footsteps of the suits of armor running about the halls. Soon enough, Filch was running out the doors swearing endless punishment and pain upon the perpetrators.
This was one of my most favorite chapters to write so far, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
"What did I say about not doing little kid pecks," Pansy's voice travelled to them.
When Draco decided he couldn't wait any longer he reached around Harry, pressing his fingers against Harry's entrance. Draco rubbed his fingers in circles around it, teasing Harry. Harry let out a small whimper as he tried to press back against Draco's fingers and slumped into his shoulder. Draco allowed Harry to press back onto his finger and heard Harry take in a sharp breath. Draco tried moving his finger around a little to try and get him used to the feeling. Harry's hands made their way to Draco's shoulders, squeezing slightly. Draco leaned down to plant a few soft kisses on Harry's clenched jaw.
It was messy and his teeth clanked against Harry's, but when Harry finally kissed back, it was oh so worth it.
"You did?" Hermione said, whipping around to stare at him.
"You know what I mean! I just think it'd be nice to actually find someone for our final year here don't you think? I know we all joke but I really think we should try and just have a normal year. And if you like Potter there's really nothing wrong with that Draco," Draco groaned and threw his head back, "And you Blaise, you should just admit it if you like him. In my opinion I think he'd say yes and if he doesn't like guys we both know he's too nice to be mean to you about it."
"Yeah?" he responded, turning around.
Draco was already in bed asleep with all the lights out. Harry paused and took a moment to stare across the room at Draco and felt his heart throb in his chest.
"Uh," Harry said, feeling slightly stupid but all the colors were hurting his brain and he felt very tired.
"I don't want you to miss out on it taking care of me," Draco said.
"I never see you guys anymore!" Pansy complained as she flopped onto Blaise's bed. "You're always off making out with Potter," she said gesturing to Draco.
"Yeah, didn't you guys hate each other?" Charlie asked.
"Yeah, it's weird to think we won't be coming back here next year..." Hermione said looking up at the castle.
"I'm just telling the Death Eater that if he decides to attack you or anyone again he's going to have to deal with our whole house too," the kid sneered at Draco.
"Yeah, of course. Thanks, Ron." They stood there awkwardly for a moment, Harry hovering on the stairs and Ron studying him. "Hey, I'm really tired, I'm going to head to bed. You should too."
----------------------------
"Yeah, Seamus learned that the hard way earlier. Tried to put his stuff down in a room with Seamus and it flew at him, barely missed his head. He's rooming with Ernie Macmillan now and Dean got stuck with Zacharias Smith," Ron made a face, "Dean really got bad luck."
Draco's hands were just gripping the base of Harry's jumper to pull it up when Harry suddenly snapped out of it.
Harry looked over at Draco and froze. Draco had two large scars cutting across his abdomen and up to his chest. Harry took them in and realized what they were from.
He slowly sat up, surveying the room. The window was open, they must've opened it the night before. His sheets were tossed off the bed along with most of his pillows and Pansy seemed to be using it all as a makeshift bed on the floor.
"Oh good morning Harry!" Molly said, taking in Harry's form at the window, "Mind waking Ron up for me? I just finished preparing lunch."
Harry looked up at Draco guiltily.
The colors were pretty, Harry couldn't help but think as he stumbled around the room a little light headed. Someone had done some spell to make colored lights flash around the room and music was playing out of a gramophone in the corner. People were glowing all over the room though, adding to the haze of color that filled the room.
"It's okay, I get it," Harry said, shaking his hands in front of his face, realizing why Ron was reusing to look at him.
"Of course," Blaise smiled back, "how about The Three Broomsticks next? I could go for a butter beer."
"Great, this will start tomorrow," McGonagall said and turned away, leaving Draco and Harry to glare at her retreating form.
"I like Liquorice wands and chocolate cauldrons," Draco responded, running his hand over a selection of Fizzing Wizzbees. "What about you?"
"Shove off Malfoy," was all Harry managed, because while he was very annoyed that Malfoy decided he needed to barge in just to start an argument, he brought up the very subject that he was trying to avoid mentioning: himself and Ginny and dating- and now he just felt embarrassed.
"Me neither," Hermione said, turning to look at the stairs where Harry had just disappeared up a moment ago.
"I swear..." Hermione shook her head, "You're so dense sometimes."
“Astronomy tower at 7 pm this Saturday, and you better not be late. Oh, and you’re taking me on a date Saturday,” Draco said with a smirk and then left to go find Pansy.
"Yeah, that's a good idea," Ron said, "Much better than mailing your gift. I like seeing you open them."
School had just ended for the day when McGonagall stopped him in the hall to tell him to go see Pomfrey.
It took Draco a couple tries but he finally got it down and made a face, "Why would muggles do that?"
Harry quickly sobered up, "You are?"
The next 28 days they had to let the potion sit and mature and when October 5th rolled around, Harry was kind of interested to see how it turned out.
Draco let out an annoyed sound but he slid off Harry and laid next to him. Harry sat up then and leaned back down to help Draco get under the covers.
"What are you talking about, just watching is boring," Draco complained, falling into easy conversation with the Gryffindors.
"Wait really?"
"Well I've decided I should try something new this year."
"You just made fun about my favorite color being my house color and yet so is yours!"
"Yeah, plus Luna is actually the only one underage. She turned 17 in August, remember? And Luna's almost 17, what's the big deal?" Seamus snuck his arm around Dean's waist and Dean pulled him closer to him. They'd taken to doing so when they were talking to people or even just standing around. Hermione figured it might have to do with the fact that they didn't need to hide their relationship anymore, she smiled at them despite herself.
"I don't want to-!" was all Draco managed to say before Harry yanked him under again.
"I hadn't really thought that far, I really didn't think he'd say yes," Blaise nervously laughed.
"Alright," Harry said and then paused, trying to think of a good pick up line. "Do you believe in love at first sight—or should I walk by again?"
"Well here he is," Pansy said, way too happy for Draco's taste, "Go on draco." Pansy smirked at Draco and he shot a glare at her in return and followed Harry out of the room.
Harry brushed off Draco's comment, "Doesn't matter, you still need to get up or we won't be on time." With that, Harry pulled away from Draco and watched in amusement and Draco stretched out his arms trying to pull Harry back. "I'm going to get dressed, you need to get up," Harry laughed.
Draco laughed, pulling him into another kiss.
Draco
"I found this spot at the beginning of the school year. See how it slopes down, but you can't see any of the beach? It looks kinda like a cliff huh?" Draco nodded a bit, "Well, that's 'cause it's a bit of a secret cove. There's a hole in the rock that you have to squeeze through a bit here on the side," Harry pointed to what was, sure enough, a hole in the side of the rock formation, as they got closer. "Then, when you go through there, it opens up into a little cove with a small private beach."
"Where is here?"
"Alright, follow me then," Harry said with a small laugh, standing up and offering Draco a hand.
Hermione smiled up at him, "Jealous of what? That she got to kiss me like that?"
"Yeah, party games are no fun sober," Seamus said laughing.
Hermione beamed at him, "That's great!"
"Do you ever wish you had help with it?" Blaise continued, peeking over at Neville's face and bracing himself for the question he was going to ask next.
"Yeah, it would be very fun. What's one place you want to travel to?"
"I saw that you were at least fair with the Quidditch lineup," Draco said, without looking up from his book.
"What is something that people think you'd never do, but have?"
Harry could feel Draco smiling against his lips and he couldn't help but smile back.
He watched as a house elf came in, then, and took away their plates. It was silent a few seconds more as Lucius finally folded the daily profit and set it down on the table. He took a breath like he was about to talk.
Harry smiled over at him. "What?" Draco asked after a moment.
Draco blushed slightly, he knew it was a bit true... he really needed his own style.
Neville was walking back to the castle when he heard his name being called. He turned around and was shocked to see none other than Blaise Zabini jogging after him.
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," Harry said, tapping his wand on the parchment, watching as ink spread across the page.
As soon as things were cleaned up, Harry and Draco practically raced up the stairs, taking two at a time.
"Blue," Draco said sitting up so Pansy had access to his head.
"How about we do it this coming Friday? Dean said, "We should be able to get everything ready by that time and it'll be nice to conclude the school week with."
"I never said it was a problem, I just mean that I'm not gay!"
They made it back up to their dorm without incident and Harry let out a breath of relief.
"Are we going back to that cave of yours?"
"Well he wouldn't be completely wrong," Blaise said and Draco glared at him.
"Forgot he was still here," Ron mumbled as he walked over to Harry's bed and sat. Draco decided to ignore the comment.
Harry looked up at Draco with sad eyes and Draco leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Harry's lips. "You have to forgive yourself," Draco said, the words ghosting over Harry's lips.
When they reached the Great Hall doors Harry made a split second decision and told Ron and Hermione to go on without him as he hurried to catch up to Dean and Seamus.
Blaise gazed lazily over at the work he was holding up and then it hit him: he had herbology today, which meant an entire hour working next to Neville. A smile spread across his face.
"No way, I thought for sure they wouldn't be okay with it," Ginny said.
----------------------
"Wait, what?" Harry said, shocked. They're dating? Since when?
Both boys stopped yelling and trying to untangle themselves from each other when they heard laughing. Turning to stare at Hermione who had dissolved in a fit of laughter by the door, they suddenly realized just how close they were to each other and quickly disentangled themselves and rushed to get as far away from each other as possible as their faces rapidly colored.
"Sure,"  Harry responded, "What are we playing today?"
"You soaked my robes!" Draco sputtered.
"About how we didn't get back together after the war, right?" Ginny said, feeling slightly nervous. She figured this would eventually happen, but she still hoped this talk wouldn't come.
Back in the common room most everyone had already vacated the room to go to bed.
"What's going on?" Harry said as he caught sight of them.
"Guys, I really don't care. I was just surprised like Ron."
"Who knows," Harry mumbled, head pounding and still confused why Draco was glowing red. "I'm not terribly surprised though."
"Maybe, don't wait up for me," Harry said.
"Where were you two?" Ron whisper-yelled to Harry as the professor tried to grab the class' attention once again.
Harry woke up on Halloween and rushed down to eat. Hermione and Ron shared looks as Harry practically inhaled his food and then muttered a quick goodbye as he ran out of the dinning hall.
"Yes, and you've seemed so willing to return that friendliness since we've been back. You've been ignoring me," he shot back. Draco took this as his cue to lean in close, putting his mouth next to Harry's ear and he could feel his breath tickle his ear. Harry's face heated up as he stumbled backwards towards the table, but Draco grabbed his hip before Harry could get very far. Harry stiffened slightly at the contact.
Draco woke up the next day by the sun glaring through the window. His head was pounding and he was immensely thankful that it was Sunday and not a school day.
"Alright, Harry."
"Well, I was mad at first," Lucius admitted, "but your mother helped. I was mostly worried about you, especially since you liked the exact person who the Dark Lord was against. I've learned a lot over the last few years and especially after Potter helped us all stay out of azkaban, I don't think you could have picked someone better."
Harry immediately got lost in his eyes as he looked at him. They seemed to be glowing in the moonlight and Draco's hair was messily hanging in his face. Harry really was hopelessly in love with him.
"As much as I love this conversation," Draco said, checking the time, "I have somewhere to be."
"I refuse," Draco said, glaring at Pansy and picking up a glass.
"Is-" Harry paused wondering if it was something he should even ask, but figured he might as well since they were already here, "is being gay, something common in the wizarding world?"
"Keep in mind what my childhood was like," Harry mumbled, averting his eyes back to the pile of pillows at his feet.
Hermione noticed him a moment later, "Ah! Hey Harry, have you been sitting down here long?" she asked sitting down in the chair next to him.
“Don’t give him any ideas,” Draco said, eyeing the chocolate, “The junk food from there is already bad enough. I can only imagine if they filled chocolate with the earwax flavoring from bertie botts every flavor beans or something.” His nose wrinkled in disgust.
"Listen, I know it's kind of awkward between us now, after the whole dare and everything, but I don't want it to be," Blaise said as they were sealing the last vials of the potion, Neville turned to look at him. "It doesn't have to mean anything if you don't want it to, but if you do want it to mean something...." Blaise struggled for a moment with the words, rubbing his arm nervously, "I wanted to know if you wanted to hang out with me during the next Hogsmeade trip? If you don't want to I perfectly understand, and I don't want this to make anything awkward between us-"
"Sorry, I didn't think I'd be gone so long," Harry said, embarrassed. He really hadn't been planning on staying the night at Draco's.
They both heard steps then and Harry quickly grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him under the cloak. Just in time too, as Filch came around the corner just then, muttering about hearing naughty kids up and about.
"I'm just-" Harry sighed a bit, taking another sip of water and looking out over the grounds, "I'm a bit worried about what the whole potion means for Hogwarts and well... everyone I guess. If a death eater did manage to sneak into Hogwarts, I doubt they're going to just stop after one failed potion."
“You’re one to talk,” Harry shot back, but before they could start arguing Hermione put up a hand.
Of course, that wasn't the only reason. There was also the slight issue that Harry was a boy and so was he, which was something his father would be anything but pleased to find out about. What would he do if his father found out? Draco suddenly thought. It was bad enough that he was kissing Harry at the parties, at least those could be explained away with the excuse of it being a game, but there was no way to explain actually liking him. The thought sent a shiver up his spine and he felt himself beginning to panic just over the idea of it. He had no idea what to do besides just ignoring it, so that's what he decided to do. He would ignore his feelings for Harry and they'd eventually go away.
"Oh yeah, I can't blame him," Ginny murmured and they both turned to look over to where it looked like Blaise and Pansy were teasing Draco again. "He seems happy."
Hermione looked at Harry skeptically, but didn't question it.
I'm glad you had a good Christmas, mine was nice too. I got some clothing and a new potions kit. I can only imagine how atrocious this jumper is going to be.
"Help me move the pillows and left-over blankets inside," Draco said, heaving a pile of cushions up from the floor. Harry hurried over to the mound to follow suit, spilling them onto the floor in a corner of the fort.
"My smile isn't creepy."
"I don't think we'll have enough time to get them back before the match though," Draco murmured, already trying to come up with ideas on how to get the fireworks back and prank Filch in the process.
"Why not?"
Harry decided it might be better to get out of his room.
"He-" Harry paused wondering if he should even tell them. The idea of telling them Draco kissed him embarrassed him enough and he didn't want to share that embarrassment with someone else. "He didn't do anything. I'm fine, just tired."
Harry and Draco set to work as they normally did, working in harmony and complete silence. Harry still felt the awkward tension, but it wasn't as strong while they were working.
“Listen, Draco,” Harry reached out like he was going to grab his hand but thought better of it and dropped it down to his side again, “I really am sorry. I’m kind of an idiot, I uh- didn’t mean to make you upset the other day. I wasn’t thinking.”
"I mean like school interesting. Like something normal kids do, normal kids don't go off fighting Voldemort."
"Me too," Harry laughed, changing into his pajamas. He rarely wore them, but he figured he probably shouldn't show up to Draco's in his boxers and he didn't feel like changing before he left.
"Are there rules that you have to be alone with him? Or can Ron and I join you two? I know Ron was hoping to discuss the Quidditch team with you."
They found a booth at the back and both ordered a butter beer.
"If I wanted a girlfriend I could get one at any time. I'm focusing on myself right now."
"Exactly. Let's say only one of the potions took effect, what would either of those do for their cause? You don't know any information that they'd be willing to be caught for and logically what would putting you under a love potion do?
Draco shook his head, trying to clear the thoughts from his head and turned over, facing his back to Harry.
"Fred and George gave it to me third year. They said they nicked it from filch's office. When you're finished with it you just say 'Mischief managed' and the ink disappears."
“You know, tonight’s a full moon, which means if Pomfrey is right, there will only be one more moon cycle until the potion wears off,” Hermione said, trying to cheer Harry up.
"Wait! Where are we going?!" Harry tried to shout over the music as Draco drags him down the hall. Harry knew, whatever happened, he had to get away. Who knew what Draco was planning? I mean, Draco had always hated Harry and he could easily do what he wanted right now, he'd come and distracted him with sweet words that made his heart pound in a weird way. Harry was utterly defenseless, wishing he hadn't forgotten his wand in his room. Before he could think about how to retrieve his arm from Draco's hand, and then an escape plan, Draco pulled Harry into an entrance to a secret passage. Before Harry could recover Draco pushed Harry to the wall.
"Honey you're very far from straight," Pansy rolled her eyes, "But that isn't the problem here! I never see you guys and you both have boyfriends! I don't have anyone!" Pansy groaned falling back on the bed dramatically and Blaise rolled his eyes at her.
"I'm alright, just feels strange..." Harry said as Draco started to move his fingers again.
Ginny looked over at Ron and had to stifle a laugh as she saw Ron's pleading look. "It's alright, I'll leave you two to your date," Ginny and Luna stood up then to go find a table.
Hey guys! That was the last chapter! There will still be an epilogue of course, so look out for that though.
-------------------------
"Who hasn't ever made a fort?" Draco asked incredulously.
They made it to the stairs and out of sight just as the girl made it into the room.
"What the heck?!" Draco shouted when he came up for air, "You ruined my hair!" Draci continued complaining but slowly stopped and burst out laughing himself when he saw Harry doubled over in laughter.
"Oh, right. Sorry," Draco said, suddenly embarrassed. While he'd always had a lot expected of him as a kid, he still had had moments where he was allowed to act like a child when he was younger, Harry never even got that.
"Hey," Draco said, sitting down on the chair as well, forcing Harry to scoot over. It wasn't made for two people, though, and Draco ended up sitting on him partly.
"So that's why she was over quite a bit in the summer!" Harry laughed.
"We can do something after practice, how about that?" Harry said, his face flushing as he felt Draco's breath ghost over his neck.
Harry let out a sigh, grabbing his book bag and heading after him. When he made it down the stairs and set his stuff down at the table, taking the seat across from Draco, Draco didn't even look at him and Harry felt a twinge of sadness.
"We'll bring the alcohol!" Seamus proclaimed, grabbing Dean's hand. Hermione shook her head laughing slightly and giving up.
"I thought so," Ron said, leaning back and taking Hermione's hand up in his.
A letter dropped in front of Ron that looked like it might have been from his mom and then a bright pink letter dropped in front of Harry. Everyone turned to look at him as Harry stared at it.
Harry laughed at Draco's look of panic, "Don't worry I wont. So you've never dated anyone at all?"
“How on earth did you know I was holding his hand?”
When he got there he realized it didn't matter much as Hagrid seemed to be having trouble keeping everyone's attention anyway over the chatter about the ball and Quidditch game.
"Just because the war is over doesn't mean that there aren't people out there who don't still want revenge," Pomfrey said, "though I don't see who at Hogwarts would want to do so."
How has your break been? It's always a bit crazy at Ron's house, it's a lot of fun though. Ron, George, Percy, and Ginny all still live here of course, but Charlie and Bill will be coming tomorrow. Fleur, Bill's wife, is coming as well so the house is going to be packed. I suppose it's a lot less hectic at your house. Hermione will be coming for New Years too, so pretty soon there'll be 11 people here. You're probably rolling your eyes right about now, but it really is nice. I wish you could be here as well, I do miss you.
"I was thinking we could have a study date today," Harry said as they got up to leave the table as well. "It's kind of late to go to Hogsmeade now and I have quite a bit of work this weekend."
"Alright, I can do that."
"Whatever, I don't have to hear it from you, dinner's over anyway!"
"I just thought he could use the help," Blaise said suddenly defensive.
"Yeah, I would like to. As long as my father doesn't know."
Hermione could see how nervous he was as they sat down at the table for breakfast. Harry had decided to drop it off to Draco by owl because he was worried Draco would just walk away if he tried to give it to him, so now he was nervously waiting for the post to arrive.
"Wait," Ron said holding up his hands and looking at the pair, who at this time had managed to grab the attention of most of the Gryffindor table and a few students from other tables, "you're dating?!"
"You can't just-"
Draco cleared his throat, "So what do you want to do after Hogwarts?"
"I won't tell a soul," Draco laughed and dropped his chocolate frog onto the counter to pay. The employee gave him a cautious look and rang up Draco's purchase, Draco tried to ignore the look.
“I may have asked him if he was going with anyone, and when he said he wasn’t even planning on going I said he should. Then, when he asked why I said he should go because it’s our last year.”
"No way, really?" Harry breathed, and turned a bit to peek at them again. They were laughing now and Neville was still holding Blaise's hand on the table. "They are pretty cute together, I've got to admit. Hey! That's what Ron was talking about then earlier today!"
"We'll bring the alcohol," Seamus said, sliding into the seat next to Ron, Dean following.
He really shouldn't be reacting like this, this was no different than any other time they've hung out and studied. But, oh lord, Draco was glowing a bright red and Harry finally understood what it meant.
"Well since we had to room with someone from a different house, that meant that there were only two Huffelpuffs and slytherins to choose from.
He originally thought that maybe the potion had been brewed incorrectly but when he had brought this idea to Hermione, she assured him it wasn't. Though Harry wasn't quite sure if "assured" was the right word.
Harry let his hand find it's way between Draco's legs and rub circles against his entrance, slowly pressing against him when Draco suddenly stopped him.
Neville quickly shut his eyes as Blasie kissed him, he knew he wasn't supposed to have his eyes open as he kissed at least. The kiss was quick and over a bit faster than both of them wanted. When it was over, Blaise rushed back to his place in the circle, both his and Neville's faces' coloring fast.
"Oh no, looks like tails," Seamus said in mock sadness when he noticed how eager Harry and Draco were to know what was said about them. Seamus passed the coin onto Dean who asked Neville next and then Neville asked Blaise.
"That's a surprise too. Where is everyone?"
"Never have I ever had dyed hair," Neville said. Lavender took a shot and so did Goyle. The former didn't look very happy about it though and sent a glare around the circle, his hair was still slightly orange.
Ginny smiled at him, "Thanks, it means a lot. I want to say sorry too, I mean I didn't exactly help things. I didn't make any effort to try and talk either." Ginny gave a small laugh, things were starting to look like they could go back to normal.
"Wait! He asked you out?!" Pansy said, clasping her hands together in excitement.
"Oh yeah, that's right," Hermione said, thoughtful, "I wonder with whom, though."
"Exactly, and the brighter the color, the more you're feeling the emotion."
"Yeah?" Ginny said with a small laugh, "Good for you then. What made you realize that? Was it Malfoy?" She said it like a joke but when Harry just turned redder and didn't meet her eyes she let out a small gasp, "No way! You like Malfoy!"
"Alright, so now what? It's only ten, not exactly time for lunch or anything yet," Harry said, shuffling through his bag and pulling out some Liquorice Wands and offering one to Draco who happily accepted.
"No, I didn't mean to be rude. I just- IthinkImightbegay," Harry scrambled to get the words out and they all jumbled together.
"Here's the notes you were asking for the other day from Potions," Hermione said, "I just finished my homework and figured you'd be needing them. Ron and I are going to the library to study after Hogsmeade."
Harry was about to say hey when he took in Draco and his breath caught in his throat. He was absolutely stunning.
"Well I actually kissed him back in October and then a few weeks later was when we actually got together," Harry began telling Hermione everything from the beginning. "And then his mom came in to wake us and they caught us in bed together, apparently his parents knew he liked me though and didn't mind," Harry concluded, blushing slightly.
Harry pulled back after a moment, panting slightly, "Well, good morning to you too, love."
"Yep, you're the first to know about my stash. Don't tell anyone or Ron will look for it and steal some," Harry joked.
Their drinks came quickly and they settled into easy conversation. It really was no different than they were before except that Harry could kiss Draco whenever he wanted; that was a definite plus in Harry’s book.
Hermione watched Harry blush as Pansy and Draco fought with each other and smiled. Oh how much has changed since first year, thought Hermione.
The whole thing sucked if Draco was being honest. He was at a loss of what he was even supposed to even say to Potter, what was McGonagall even expecting from this? They were hardly friends, and Draco was certainly willing to point that out if not for the fact that they'd both only end up in more trouble and if this is the punishment they got for an argument in the hall, who knew what she'd come up with next. With that in mind both boys stayed silent as they made their way up to their dormitories to study.
"You'd be right Weasley," Pansy laughed.
"You may be able to fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I can see it in your eyes," Seamus said with a triumphant smile when Draco blushed lightly.
Draco wandered through the aisles for a minute until he found a black and silver pheasant-feather quill. He bought it quickly and they headed out towards The Three Broomsticks.
Suddenly Harry was visible, the cloak laying beside him on the floor. Draco stared at it, mildly shocked for a second before recovering himself, the cloak wasn't important right now.
Sincerely,
"We should probably all head to bed," Neville added, he started to stand up and grab some of the empty bottles and put them in the bag Seamus and Dean brought them in. "I'll bring these to Seamus' room so he can get rid of them without Headmaster McGonagall finding them or another professor." Neville headed up to the dorms.
"Sure, maybe one day," Harry bumped his shoulder against Draco's, giving him a small smile, "Cheer up, I'll still let you eat some of the cake Ron certainly bought for our win."
"Ready to start?" Hermione asked when she saw Harry and Draco emerge from the stairwell.
"Yeah, like any eighth year that wants can join in, we all play games and stuff," Seamus said.
Harry felt terrible now about pushing him away and yelling at him like he did a while ago. But on top of his guilt, Harry could feel his stomach turning with nerves, though he had no idea from what.
Neville thought about it for a moment and then an idea popped into his head. "When did you start liking Ron?"
Harry hurried to the window to call Draco's owl back to give the letter to him. He was watching it fly away just as the door burst open to admit Mrs. Weasley.
"The player Pansy actually wants a steady relationship?!" Blaise said in mock surprise.
When the final class ended, Harry, Ron, and Hermione headed down to the pitch for practice. Hermione broke off from them when they reached the stands though and left with a quick good luck to sit and do homework.
"What?" Harry asked, confusion written on his face.
"Yeah?" Ginny said with a bit of an amused smirk, "And who's that?"
"Oh, good," Hermione said as she noticed him sitting down, "you're finally here, Ginny said she has some news for us."
Draco could hear Harry laughing at something the Weasel must have said and couldn't help feeling slightly jealous. Harry had only laughed like that twice for him: when they had the pillow fight and during that blasted game of Questions (or whatever the hell Potter called that game).
"Hmmm," Harry hummed into Draco's shoulder when he pressed his head into Draco's neck. A shiver went up Draco's spine as he felt Harry's breath ghosting over his skin. "I love you," Harry barely whispered and then placed feather-light kisses up Draco's neck.
"I am not bottoming," Draco said, nose turned up at the idea of a Malfoy bottoming. Or at least that's what Harry guessed Draco wanted him to think, Harry could tell that he was scared though and his face softened.
"What?"
"Hey," Draco said and a light pink made its way across his cheeks and Harry thought it was adorable. He figured Draco would not be happy to be called adorable.
"That's what happens when you try to disappear for a couple months," Harry sighed, propping his head up with his hand, "sorry that you didn't really get to say goodbye to your parents, Ron."
Lucius and Narcissa shared a look over the table.
“Well then go get ready!” Pansy said, ushering him out of the room.
"Just because we have a truce, doesn't mean we're friends."
"Hey! You can't just copy!" Harry said with a slight laugh.
"A fort?"
"Are you okay?" Hermione asked. They had been sitting in the dining hall for the last ten minutes and Harry hadn't said a word, just mindlessly stared down at his plate.
"Who? Ginny?"
Malfoy didn't stop until he reached the room, Harry right on his heels, looking a bit more than peeved.
"You're way too skinny to be worried about what you're eating," Harry said with a laugh.
That was all it took for their friends to understand- and for the entire school to know- and Draco and Harry finally let their nerves turn into excitement over the next few weeks they had planned. The train ride home was over faster than they expected and next thing they knew Harry and Draco were standing on a beach hand in hand.
"Hey, are you alright?" Draco asked, worry dripping from his voice.
"What?"
"Alright, then Pansy and Goyle are the new beaters. Goyle has experience too which will help."
"Of course." Hermione looked at him skeptically. "Don't worry 'Mione, I'll take care of it."
Draco blushed harder when Harry snickered.
"He's not fine," Ron said intelligently and Hermione gave him a look. "What?"
They made it back up to their room in silence and Harry realized as they stepped through the door that he had no idea what they were going to do for the entire hour that they were going to be stuck together for. For the first time ever they had both found themselves with no homework for the night and Draco seemed to realize this too as he looked over at Harry.
"Two."
He was met with Draco leaning against the gate to the manor in skin tight black pants and a loose grey sweater. "You sure took your time," he smirked, pushing away from the gate to wrap his arms around Harry.
-------------------------------
Harry and Draco were running for the office doors as soon as Filch left the room. Harry rushed to the desk, hurrying through the drawers to find where he kept the confiscated items.
"I don't care what others think. I like you, Draco. I don't want to date someone else."
"Draco-" he started.
“Thank you, you look amazing too,” Draco said and Harry envied how he never seemed to get flustered.
They entered the store and the door chimed signaling their entrance. The store was swarming with Hogwarts students and they had to squeeze by a group of fourth years to reach the chocolate section.
"Yeah, yeah," Harry replied, grabbing Draco around the waist and pulling him closer and pressing a light kiss to Draco's lips
"Yeah, I suppose we probably should," Draco sighed, but didn't move to get up.
Harry slowly ran his hand in circles on Draco's back, feeling his muscles slowly relax and his breathing slow down.
Hermione looked down and noticed the soaked robes in Harry's hands then and the upset look to his eyes, "Is everything alright? I saw Malfoy run through here a minute ago. Did something happen?"
Draco watched him go, his brain trying to process what just happened and finally slowing down.
"I agree," Harry said, almost wistfully, "The war really made us all miss out on a lot, huh?"
"Mr. Malfoy, visiting hours are over," Pomfrey tried to say but Draco ignored her.
"That's not how the game works."
"Hey," Harry said and got up to walk over to Draco's bed where he sat next to him and Draco surprisingly didn't protest, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring up any bad memories. For the record, I don't think you would have taken it if your family's life didn't depend on it."
"I'm not taking it off," Harry said, pulling the fabric around himself protectively, "I don't care what they think."
The next morning was hell.
Her suspicions were confirmed anyway when Draco came into the dining hall twenty minutes later, meeting eyes with Harry and then dropping them to hurry over to the Slytherin table.
"Yeah," Harry replied and Pomfrey went off to find something for his headache.
------------------------
Neville picked the bottle up to give it a spin, it landed on Hermione.
"Three sickles," the employee said and Draco handed over the money. Harry dropped his pile of treats onto the counter when Draco was handed his item.
"Stop."
Draco seemed to notice Harry looking at him across the library, startling Harry, and picked up his stuff to go sit next to him.
"Now tell me what happened!" Hermione whined, "I want to know from the beginning!"
"So I'm your new source of entertainment?"
Draco was in love with him.
"Draco has changed a lot since then," Hermione finally spoke up, and Harry looked at her with surprise, "He actually came to me and apologized for how he acted towards me several weeks ago." This was news to Harry and his eyebrows went up, Draco hadn't mentioned it, and neither had Hermione. Hermione elbowed Ron when she finished talking and everyone stared at her.
The second of October was the day the eighth years planned to have their second party and they were all gathered in the common room after dinner. A couple new people had shown up and a couple that came last time didn't come this time. Hermione was silently fuming at Dean and Seamus as they'd brought alcohol against her wishes, especially because Luna and Ginny were both there.
"Well they don't know that. They're young and impressionable right now and usually younger kids tend to turn to those who are popular and you are a prime candidate," Hermione said, turning back towards McGonagall who had finished sorting the new first years and was preparing to give the welcoming speech.
Hermione smiled a bit at that, but was not nearly as embarrassed by the question as Neville had been by his, and confidently answered, "about third year."
"Want to head down to the dining hall for dinner?" Draco asked, when Harry looked over it seemed like he actually had a lot more done of the project than him. He felt a little jealous.
"So you stuck with," Ron seemed to take that moment to realize who Harry was standing with, "him."
"I'm just as shocked as you are," Harry laughed, leaning his head on top of Draco's.
"Ugh," Harry groaned, rolling over to peek at Hermione with one eye, "why do I even need to get up? It's a Saturday."
"Yeah, eyes just hurt. Lot's of colors."
Dean smirked at Seamus and whispered back, "Want me to only name one of the people in that relationship? Or both?"
"That's just an odd mix," Hermione said, almost like she was talking to herself, "I don't imagine it would kill you, especially as none of the ingredients react badly towards each other... I imagine it was someone who wanted a specific effect or they didn't know what they were doing. It just seems odd."
It was starting to snow and Harry looked around at the path in front of him, he supposed it would be white by the time they started on their way back to the castle.
Harry went red at all the possibilities of answers to that question, he quickly took a shot before an answer could spill from his lips.
Ginny simply smiled and hugged Harry, "Thanks, I care for you too, as a brother of course. And I guess since we're sharing shocking news," Ginny paused for a second to take a breath, "I'm dating Luna right now."
"Yeah, I'm sure you are," Draco grumbled, picking at his robes. Harry quickly casted a warming charm on Draco as he tried to peel his robes off himself. "Thanks," Draco said with a sigh as he warmed up.
"It is your problem because if you just sit there and read, I'm leaving and this hour won't count," Harry shot back, crossing his arms over his chest and glaring over at Draco.
"Ginny and Luna?" Ron asked.
"Shoving you in it is..." Harry said, starting to walk over to Draco.
Ginny let out a laugh, "Yeah, I guess that probably wouldn't be the best idea. Thanks, for talking to me about this I mean. It helped a lot."
"No way, they were really okay with it?" Ginny asked.
"It'll be interesting watching from the stands for once though," Harry said, joining the conversation after finally tearing his eyes away from Draco.
"Maybe they had been hoping it'd blow up," Harry said grimly.
"We should come here sometime with your friends and mine sometime. This has been kinda fun," Harry said, leaning his chin in his hand and gazing over at Draco who was sorting through the things he bought and placing them all in one bag.
------------------------
"That's not a bad idea, we could try catching her later at lunch or something," Ron said, excited to be of use when it seemed like Hermione and Harry were the only ones with any useful information on the subject.
"You're staring."
Harry struggled with knowing what to say. Ron and Hermione were the only ones he'd ever really confided in about his life before Hogwarts, but he also knew that Draco was right. Talking about it might help.
"Gee thanks Ron."
"Wow, so cold Potter. After saving me, I thought you decided to turn a new leaf."
"We could use the room of requirement," Harry suggested.
"The potion."
"For a prank."
“Yeah, but this one’s really grown on me,” Pansy looked down at the spoiled dog she’d named moose. Draco had no idea why she chose that name.
"Since about six months ago?" Hermione said, confused now and Harry realized he'd just have to let it go or people were going to think he was weird.
"I am, now do the dare."
"Neither of us believe that Draco," Pansy laughed.
"Yeah," Ginny said and leaned forward to capture Luna's lips.
Harry had let go of Draco's hand when they stood up, but he wished he could take it again. He felt slightly jealous of Ron and Hermione's easy display of affection.
Groaning, everyone started to get up and round their things up.
"Tomorrow is the first Hogsmeade trip," Draco started, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt, "and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me."
"Don't ruin my hair like Potter's."
"Do you have a crush on anyone?" Harry went pink and Draco smirked, "So you do. Who is it?"
"You're really just going to let him be?" Ron sputtered indignantly.
He wished he was hanging out with them now as he looked up from his textbook to observe the way Draco's hair fell across his face as he had taken to doing lately. He had decided in the last few days that Draco was one of the best looking boys in the whole school, and that he definitely had a massive crush on him.
"He's done it more than once and I want to get the stuff back. They were some fireworks and things that Ron was planning to use then when Gryffindor wins against Slytherin at the first match this weekend."
"Step three was ask him to hang out outside of school and step four was to ask him out," Pansy replied, making a few marks in the notebook. "But I guess you don't need to really worry about the steps now though, he said yes." Pansy smirked and went to sit down next to Blaise on the bed.
"I feel like I made a mistake first year and don't want to remake it," Harry explained.
Harry just shot him a glare.
"Yes, Ron," Pansy replied as Draco continued to glare at her, "that's what I said."
"I don't care what my father thinks."
"You should go," Harry said before he could stop himself, and blushed further when they both turned to look at him.
"Sometimes I'm not so sure that's entirely true for Malfoy," Ron said and Harry laughed a bit.
Hermione gave a light laugh, "I agree, easier on the owl too."
"Well that's not my problem," Draco said, turning to his book that he had just picked up.
"Yup, we're going to Hogsmeade together this weekend."
“Am not.”
Ten minutes later and Draco regretted everything.
Draco shook his head, following, "git."
"Yeah, I tried dating girls and boys and I realized I liked both," Dean replied.
His eyes wandered over to where he saw Hermione and Ron walking down the stairs together, Hermione laughing at something Ron had said. They were dressed fairly nicely, not fancy or anything, but still. He figured they were going on a date and hoped Pansy wasn't nearby to see. He knew that Pansy really liked her, even if she pretended she didn't care.
"Still can't believe you thought it was me," Draco said sleepily.
Every suit of armor in a 500 meter radius of filch's office was set to start making noise and running around the halls, and to promptly fall apart when Filch got close. Succeeding in not only allowing a big enough distraction to get inside the office, but also causing a huge mess for Filch to clean up.
"Great," said Hermione as she circled their names, "for chasers you have Malfoy, Lavender, Dean, Zacharias Smith, and Seamus."
"Oh definitely not," Blaise laughed.
-------------------------------
Draco groaned as Harry pushed against him slightly, the kiss was heating up fast and Draco found himself not minding at all.
"Yeah, but that isn't due till I get back, I can just do it the last few days," Harry said and Hermione and Draco rolled their eyes.
------------------------
"Uh- I've never kissed anyone before," Neville muttered, looking very shy as Blaise looked at him. Blaise was well known as being a bit of a player around school. He'd come out as gay in his third year and from then on had rarely not been in a relationship. Knowing this, Neville really didn't want to screw up and completely embarrass himself.
Ron had reached the dorms in record time due to his desire to hurry back to his food at the table waiting for him. He yanked the door open in time to see Draco fall to the floor with a loud thud.
“Hey! Stop laughing at me, I’m serious!” Ron spluttered, indignant.
"I can see you as a healer. You'd be good at it."
"You're a jerk, you know that?" Draco said when they both calmed down.
Draco could help blushing a bit at how much it sounded like a date, "Alright."
Harry slumped down into the seat next to Draco in the dining hall for dinner, "This is a first, you're never here before I am."
December 24, 1998
“Didn’t say you were.”
"Draco!" Pansy shouted as he entered the common room, "Oh thank god you're okay! We weren't allowed to visit!"
"The door," Ron said sarcastically as he leaned back up.
"Nobody's going to hear us," Pansy laughed, "Anyway, we need a plan! Let me get the notebook!" Pansy jumped up and ran out of the room, leaving Blaise and Draco to laugh.
"Yeah, I know. Do you really think I should tell him?" Blaise said, turning his head away from Pansy's surprised expression.
"We'll start practices after the tryouts for the house teams end, pass the word along okay?" Harry said as he hung the paper up on the board.
"Come on Draco, most everyone is going to be there."
“Warm enough for you?” Harry said, smiling teasingly over at Draco.
"Not to mention he was on the opposite side of the war," Arthur said.
"Can I ask why?"
"Well of course not, everyone wants to be in Gryffindor because you're in it," Hermione said, turning to look at Harry, "I mean how often is it that one gets to be in the same house as the one who saved the wizarding world?"
"You were extremely persistent though, I'll give you that. Trapped me in the potions store and everything."
"Yeah, you're probably right," Harry said with a sigh to Hermione and then turned to the others, "Okay, tryouts are over! We'll get back to you all about who made the team, thanks for coming!"
"No I can do it," Draco said, moving to get up. After a few seconds it became clear he couldn't and with a chuckle Harry moved to help him.
"Two butterbeers," Harry said and the witch hurried off. "Did you really think I would take you to Madam Puddifoots?"
"Yeah, class started over twenty minutes ago, and we didn't see you at breakfast," Hermione hissed to them. They were all seated in a line, Ron and Hermione to his left and Draco to his right with Pansy and Blaise next to him. Harry figured they were currently grilling Draco too.
"If we head back now, then we would have time to head up to the astronomy tower for a bit," Harry said, walking close enough to Draco that their shoulders brushed together, "We could eat some of this candy too."
Draco watched, red faced as Harry closed the door to the bathroom.
"Yeah, my head still kind of hurts, but that potion Pomfrey gave me has helped a lot."
"Uh- I'd love to, but I'm really not looking for a relationship right now," he settled on, it wasn't a complete lie as he didn't really want to date as he still wasn't sure if he wanted to date boys or girls, "I'm really sorry," he added in hopes to make her feel even slightly better because by now she seemed to have grabbed the attention of the entire table and some people from other tables had started to take notice as well.
"Wow," Draco said, running their fingers over their names. "So is this how you never seem to get in trouble even though you never seem to be in bed on time?" he said with a smirk.
"Okay, I finished my part," Harry whispered, crouching down next to Draco. They were both hidden behind a statue just outside filch's office.
Harry was watching Draco though, wondering if he'd drink. When he didn't, Harry felt oddly happy.
"Luna right?" Ron said, seemingly unsure now, "You're making me question it now though. It is Luna right?"
"I'm not Whipped! I don't even like him! He's a boy for one!"
The annoyances didn't stop there though, when he got to the dining hall Pansy insisted they sit at the Gryffindor table again. Blaise got seated next to Ron who insisted on talking with his mouth full and staring at Hermione the whole time which was beyond annoying.
“Can’t blame him I would too,” Ron said.
---------------------------
"Two butterbeers please," Harry quickly said, noticing the look and the waitress hurried off without a second glance at Draco.
The train ride passed quickly and before they knew it Harry, Ron, and Hermione were seated at the Gryffindor table in the great hall.
"Yeah," Harry responded, trying to keep his eyes from travelling to Draco. The bottle landed on Pansy next who seemed very happy to have something to do.
"Oh come on I didn't complain when we went to the Slytherin tryouts."
"Turn to page 394," Snape said as class began, "Today we'll be brewing Veritaserum, which is an advanced potion, so we'll be brewing a less potent version of it. After the brewing process, you'll be drinking some of the potion to study how it affects you. Don't worry though, you'll be able to refuse telling the truth if you truly want to. This potion will merely show you how the potion pulls at you to tell the truth." Snape started writing down potion ingredients, then.
"Well, Luna and I have been talking about finally coming out."
"You totally are," Blaise said, receiving a glare from Draco.
"All good, all good, just don't make a habit of it," Slughorn said, turning back to the board where he was explaining some potion.
------------------------------
"Harry your rambling," Dean said with a laugh and a nervous smile spread across Harry's face, "But about when we knew we were gay, it started like how you described: I realized that I was looking at guys as well as girls and it just came down to experimentation.
Pomfrey stared at him for a second, "What potion did you say you were brewing again?"
Ron was sitting smugly as about half the circle took a shot when Hermione elbowed him.
"I have no idea. Do you need anything for Quidditch? It's starting soon."
"Right now you don't, but you'll find someone better. You're the chosen one, no one will be pleased when they find out you're fooling around with me: a Death Eater."
While Ron looked at him shocked, Draco came up behind Harry and cleared his throat.
"Why don't you just go talk to him?" Hermione hissed at him across their shared desk in potions.
"What did you do to me last night," Harry groaned, trying to make his way to the bathroom without walking funny.
"Oh don't be a wimp," Pansy groaned, "Potter did it with no issues last time." Pansy then seemed to get an idea and a shit-eating grin crossed her face, "You're going to let Potter win?" That seemed to do the trick and Draco set the cup down, crawling over to Harry.
"No way! That long?" Ginny finally spoke up, "I knew you guys were dating but I didn't realize it had been for that long!"
"I told you I wasn't kidding," Harry said, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Yeah, he's just worried about his dad finding out though."
"You are the most annoying person I know," Draco grumbled. Harry snickered and Draco glared at Harry. Harry quickly shot his head back down to his work and pretended he hadn't just been listening to their conversation.
-----------------------
Harry woke up to the sound of his alarm blaring next to his bed. He could hear Draco groaning about the sound a second later as he reached over to turn it off.
Harry caught sight of Draco first as he made his way towards the entrance of the restaurant. His breath caught in his throat at the sight, Draco was absolutely stunning. His hair was loosely styled in that way that made Harry’s head spin and Pansy had evidently also roped him into wearing eyeliner and Harry had to admit he was glad she had. It made his grey eyes almost seem blue and Harry had a hard time not stareing. “Wow- you look-” Harry tried, stumbling over his words. “Amazing,” he finally managed as Draco laughed.
"Sorry," Harry said, "Everyone was talking."
“You got it,” Harry said, heading to pick something out, Draco following behind, fingers intertwined.
"Yeah, I'm good staying for a while. No one will know I'm gone till the morning and I'll be back before then."
I've spent most of my time doing my homework for the break and reading in the garden. My mother has been reading in the garden with me as of late as well, it's strange in all honesty. Sometimes I wonder if she's trying to make up for the last few years. I don't mind it, though.
"Truth or dare, Longbottom," Pansy said as a wide smirk spread across her face and Blaise shot her a very worried look.
"Correct Miss. Granger! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now does anyone know the ingredients?"
"Mr. Malfoy, visiting hours are over. I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
He couldn't just turn her in. What kind of friend would he be?
Draco didn't say anything, instead turning his attention to the issue at hand: what the hell was he supposed to do?
"Sorry," Draco murmured. "I said things I didn't mean."
Luna ended up not having to let Seamus do her hair and the game continued. Both Seamus and Dean ended up shirtless along the way, Ginny and Luna had shared a short kiss that left them blushing, and many other dares were given that weren't fulfilled as the numbers didn't match.
Harry tried not to gape as Draco sat down next to him the circle for the first time, a light blush dusting his cheeks as he avoided Harry's eyes.
"Oh no, absolutely not, no way in hell," Draco said, breaking the silence and plastering a look on his face somewhere between distraught and disgusted, because while he didn't really find the thought of him rooming with Harry all that horrible, he knew that Pansy would never let it go.
"No, more like you have a haze around you."
"Of course, only if you write back though."
"Wait. Quidditch match?" Harry said, slowly turning around to look at Draco.
-------------------------------
"Well I didn't understand what I do now last year, "Harry said sternly. "Draco, look at me," when Draco finally looked back up, Harry continued, "You were put in a tough position and you can't be blamed for that, and even in that position you still found a way to save my life. You risked your own safety to help me and I'll never forget that, you had a part in defeating Voldemort too. That goes for your mother as well, she saved my life too and I'll forever be grateful to both of you."
"Yeah, I used to cook for my aunt and uncle actually which wasn't exactly fun, but when I stayed at Ron's house over the summer I helped his mom with the cooking and found I really enjoyed it." Harry felt kind of proud of himself, especially when he noticed that Draco was giving him an impressed look.
Draco and Harry had been laying around nearly the entire day. It was a hot Sunday and neither of them felt like moving much. It was cool inside the dorms, but the heat outside was making them lazy.
"I mean, that they're dating."
"Come on Draco, we're about to start," Pansy called, patting the spot on the floor next to her. Draco made his way over to her as she launched into the rules of the game they'd be playing. "Okay, we're shaking it up again and playing a game called What Are The Odds. Basically person A starts off by spinning this bottle here and when it lands on person B, person A askes B a 'what are the odds question.' This can be anything as long as it's not too explicit.
"Sleep better?"
"I have a record player we can use for music and we can just amplify it," Draco finally said, trying to ignore the stares being sent their way, he had no idea how Blaise and Pansy just didn't seem to care.
"Can I?" Draco asked, placing his hand at the button on Harry's pants.
They were planning to meet at 10:30 and it was already ten. Harry looked himself over in the mirror again and decided it couldn't hurt to brush his teeth again. Twenty minutes of pacing nervously around the room later, Harry was putting on his shoes and rushing down to the entrance of Hogwarts where they planned to meet.
"Well, I wasn't sure. I don't know..." Ginny trailed off. She knew deep down that Ron wouldn't care, but a part of her was still a bit worried. She felt a weight had been lifted off her shoulders though as Ron smiled at her.
"You can say that again," Harry said, letting out a sigh. He looked back up and met Draco's eyes after a moment and then they both burst into a fit of giggles.
"It is pretty cold," Hermione replied, leaning into Ron for warmth. Harry watched them, wishing Draco was there and then reminding himself that he'd see him soon.
"We're okay," Ginny said with a smile as they started to walk to the great hall for dinner.
December 23, 1998
"Hey guys," Harry said, "wow you got a lot of alcohol this time." Harry took in the massive pile on the table.
"Talking wasn't part of the truce."
“‘M awake,” Draco said and Harry laughed.
"Mmm," Harry mumbled, taking a drink of the water, leaning into Draco a bit.
Draco pressed his lips to Harry's forehead and then captured Harry's lips in a soft kiss when he looked up. Harry sighed into the kiss and Draco pulled Harry further into himself. He slowly pulled away after a moment to look into Harry's eyes, "I love you, you know."
--------------------------------------------
"You're the one that puts up with him," Harry pointed out and laughed again.
"You've been ignoring me."
"Sorry?" Seamus raised an eyebrow at him.
"Alright," Harry croaked and Madam Pomfrey tutted before hurrying off to return with some kind of painkiller.
"I'm bored~" Draco said. He had landed on his stomach on Harry's back and crawled up so that his face was smooshed between Harry's shoulder and head. Harry tried to push Draco off of himself, but Draco wouldn't be so easily tipped.
"You can top until you're not scared, I don't mind."
"I'm definitely not envious of you," Harry said around his toothbrush.
"Don't worry, my lips are sealed," Harry said, pretending to zip up his mouth.
"Well I don't care what you do, but I'm going to read," Draco responded as he walked over to his bed and plopped down.
"No, I'm not sick, don't worry," Harry said, hurrying and shoving his shirt over his head.
"Okay, what are we playing first?" Pansy said, reaching forward and grabbing a bottle of firewhisky from the center. Dean and Seamus showed up with an armful each of alcohol at which Hermione sighed and told them to set it down in the middle of their circle along with the food Harry and Ron picked up.
"What's up?" Ginny asked.
"No, you're fine. Just keep going," Harry said, letting out a shaky breath. Harry could feel himself stretching around Draco's fingers and the thought alone would make him shiver with need if he wasn't so focused on the burning sensation below. Draco moved his fingers a bit and then grazed a hard bundle of nerves.
"Come on Draco," Pansy complained as Draco worked on his homework in the common room next to Harry. It was the first day they had to do their punishment in front of others and Draco was in a sour mood, he didn't like all the looks they were drawing. Draco decided to keep ignoring Pansy as he had been for the past ten minutes.
Harry quickly cast a tempus, "9:15"
"Well I just hope you know what you're doing Harry," Molly said, "I know you two didn't get along in the past..."
The silence drew out for a few minutes until Pansy broke it again.
Pansy snickered next to Draco as Blaise stormed off. Draco was just taking his book out of his bag when Harry finally arrived, with Ron and Hermione.
"Are the rumors true?" Blaise asked, coming up from behind Pansy, "Did Potter really-" his eyes traveled down to Draco's chest that was currently covered with layers of bandages below his clothes, "cut you all open?"
On the other end of the table Harry and Draco were arguing over their Tentacula and how they were going to go about getting leaves from it.
Harry
Harry took the scarf with a smile, "Thanks."
"No! I don't, I just- I don't know if I do," Harry mumbled, staring resolutely at the ground.
“I like you, Draco, and I was too nervous to tell you and instead said something stupid,” Harry said, finally dropping his gaze down to Draco’s hands, too nervous to look him in his eyes.
"I'm fine," Harry muttered.
Summer break had hit Hogwarts finally after a long year filled with actual studying- due to Hermione's insistence. Eighth year had come and gone quite quickly in Harry's opinion. But if you asked Ron, summer hadn't come soon enough. Though, of course, Ron happened to be dating someone who apparently prized school above her own life. While Harry dated someone who decided he was too smart for school again and only came back to appease his mother. He, unlike Hermione, decided to prize sneaking off and making out with Harry above studying.
"It is, but that doesn't change my duty as the oldest, and only, son. As the one carrying on the family name, I need to marry well and produce an heir. My parents don't really care what I do after as long as I'm only with people of a similar status. Though, it doesn't much matter now. My family has the same status level as the Weasley's now."
He was at the end of the stairwell when he looked up and saw Draco across the room, completely alone in the corner of the room. He looked like he was studying but Harry could tell by the way his eyes stared blankly at the same spot on the page, that he was thinking about other things.
"I don't have a date," Draco said, "And how did you even hear about it. Blaise only just found out."
"Yep. Fine. Spiffing!" Harry turned and rushed up the stairs, Hermione and Ron watching helplessly from the couch.
"Oh hey, there you are," Draco greeted him as he entered the common room, "you disappeared after class, I was wondering where you went."
"We better go to Honeydukes before the third years take all the good stuff," Blaise said as he led Neville towards the brightly colored shop.
"How on earth would that be fun? I think we have different definitions of fun, Harry."
"Um- thanks Luna, good to see you too," Harry said slightly confused and sat down across from her.
Draco stared down at his cup, realizing the change in mood. "How are you doing on your arithmancy homework?" Draco said, trying to offer a different topic.
"Reckon that's your replacement?" Draco asked, watching as the new player flew around between players.
After tryouts ended and Ginny was assigning positions to the players, Harry and Draco decided that it'd probably be best to just head back as she looked pretty busy.
"Let me help you," Harry said when he saw Draco struggling. Setting down the cup and pill on the bedside table, he leaned forward and helped pull Draco gently into a sitting position.
Hermione was starting to think that Harry may be going off the deep end again, and by that, she meant he was stalking Malfoy again.
Harry was opening his textbook when he heard, "Psst-" to his side. He turned to see Ron trying to get his attention.
Draco tried to ignore the way his arm felt on fire where Harry leaned into him, their fingers brushing on the railing.
"Yeah, I told you we're friends now."
Harry looked out the window as the train started to pull away from the station and closed his eyes as Hermione and Ron continued to talk to each other.
“Maybe?”
"So you knew that Ron had it?"
"Yes really."
"You know that's not what I meant at all. I simply meant feelings like compassion and friendship-"
"What a prat," Ron said looking after Draco.
"That's what I said to you last weekend, but you still made me wake up."
Draco had been trying to shed the title of Death Eater but knew it would always haunt him and for Harry to bring it up, it seemed like a smack in the face. The only one who stood up for him and his family against the wizengamot, calling him a Death Eater was too much and he immediately raised his wand.
"Truth."
"Sure," Harry said with a grin and rolled, pulling Draco on top of him and flipping their positions.
"I was going to say, did you know that apparently Weasley and Potter were talking about starting two eighth-year quidditch teams. Like so people can still play if they want. Beats me how they'd find enough people willing to play to make two teams, but it does sound interesting doesn't it?"
"Hmmm, yeah maybe if I could by-pass the headache," Draco said, bumping Harry's shoulder with his. Harry smiled in return.
"What's up?" Draco asked.
“Mhmm,” Pansy said and turned to appraise Draco’s outfit of sweatpants, “Is that what you’re wearing to lunch?”
Ron was dared to kiss Hermione and Seamus (who didn't seem very bothered). Hermione was dared to sit in Lavender's lap for a couple rounds, which was slightly funny to everyone else as they spent the whole time glaring at each other. Neville was dared to kiss Blaise again. Pansy gave Blaise a lap dance (which neither of them seemed to really enjoy much). Padma kissed Pansy and Neville. Luna was dared to hold hands with Ginny for a round and Dean and Seamus played seven minutes in heaven (coming back with rumpled hair and clothes).
"How was your Christmas?" Harry asked as they made their way up the stairs to Ginny's room where Hermione would be staying.
"Mom's been working like crazy on food. Fleur's been helping but it's a lot," Ron said, making it to Ginny's room.
TW: Panic attack
Hermione watched Pansy and Blaise out of the corner of her eye as she responded, "Looks like we're all going home then. I haven't heard of any eighth year who's staying here."
"You don't look very fine."
"For goodness sakes, it's not that hard," Pansy said growing annoyed, and before Ron could even express his confusion, "They're dating," she continued.
Ginny and Luna.
"Yeah, I mean it's mostly me. Thinking about it, I mean. She doesn't really care if people know, but I was kind of worried about my family."
"Well they've been dating for about six or so months now, and then the other day you said they both were red now, which kind of tipped me off."
Harry happily returned the enthusiasm as he ran his fingers through Draco's hair, pulling slightly as Draco let out a small moan.
Draco moved his arm down off his face and his eyes met Harry's. Their gaze held for a moment and Harry was thinking about leaning in when Draco broked the eye contact and turned his eyes towards the comb on the bed.
Blaise sputtered as Neville blushed and looked down at his feet.
Draco watched as Harry stood up and disappeared out the gap in the curtains and soon after he heard the water turn on. He let out a sigh, Harry was just too good for him. No matter what Harry said, he deserved much better than him, Draco thought.
“Hey, I came outside for those sometimes you kno-” Harry cut him off by pressing his lips to Draco’s. The protest died in his throat, letting his arms find their way behind Harry’s neck, pulling him closer.
Harry got up and changed quickly. He didn't notice Draco staring at him as he changed.
"Yeah," Pansy said, finishing, "You look hot now, I'd date you if I wasn't a flaming gay." Pansy gave him her most winning smile and patted him on the shoulder.
"You were the one who bumped into me in the first place!" Harry said, voice rising to match Draco's tone.
"Oh whatever, Harry won't die from hanging out with Malfoy," Hermione rolled her eyes, "it really is a smart idea: the prime example for disagreement between houses, getting along? That would be setting the perfect example."
"Maybe I'd be nicer to her if she had given me a hangover potion," Ron responded and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Harry laughed, "You should have said that before I agreed to let you top."
"Oh stuff it Weasley," Pansy laughed, and like that the moment was over, the tension could be cut with a knife.
"Oh-!" Harry moaned, back arching off the bed slightly. Draco watched in amazement as he grazed the spot again with his fingertips and Harry curled his fingers into the sheets. Draco tried his best to aim for that spot each time and soon Harry was mumbling nonsense.
"Ugh!" Harry groaned, leaning back in the chair he'd been sitting in for the last fifty minutes. Draco and him had been sitting in the common room doing homework for almost an hour in silence and the murmuring around them had finally quieted down, but Harry's sound of annoyance proved useful at drawing in much attention. Draco shot him a pointed look. "I don't understand this!" Harry turned to look at Draco who had started on his work again.
When they made it into the room, Harry was immediately surrounded by glowing people and it seemed to just make his head hurt worse.
He felt hands grab onto his and squeeze gently. "Breathe in slowly, okay?" someone said and he felt himself complying, breathing in and letting it out slowly.
Ron had to admit that Draco truly hadn't done anything this school year so far, but it didn't mean he liked him any more.
“You better get moving if you don’t want to be late though, aren’t you meeting at 11?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. "I'm not going to ruin your hair." Pansy stuck her fingers in the potion and rubbed it on her hands, bringing them up to his hair and messing it up.
"I'm gonna go to the restroom," Harry said, slipping his chocolate frogs into his pocket and slipping out the door. He didn't mind if they knew he wasn't going to the bathroom, he figured, they'd probably just think I was being nice and letting them have some time alone.
She gratefully took it, downing it in one gulp.
"I'm sure you'll do great."
"We shouldn't be doing this."
"How-" Draco said when he took in the mound of food in Harry's arms.
“So, the colors should be wearing off soon right?”
"If you're trying to make fun of us-" Seamus started to look slightly angry and Harry panicked.
Harry pressed light kisses down the back side of Draco’s neck and Draco let out a content sigh scooting further back into Harry’s embrace, “You don’t have plans tonight right?” Harry asked between kisses.
"Do you have a candy hoard in your trunk or something?"
"Harry," Ginny said softly, "Did you come here to fix things? Or to remain friends?"
"Yeah," Harry mumbled back, missing his mouth with a piece of bacon. Hermione and Ron shared a look.
Harry wished he would've made friends with Draco sooner. He really was one of the best he'd ever had and he felt like Draco understood him better than Ron and Hermione sometimes.
"What on Earth is 20 questions?"
"Didn't know you paid so much attention to Malfoy," Harry mumbled.
“Of course not, you weren’t supposed to be here for another two hours. I’m not ready yet.”
Ginny came out today as well and Luna stopped by. Ginny and I came out together actually, I suggested it cause she seemed really nervous. Turned out, there was nothing to worry about, everyone took it extremely well, apparently Charlie is Asexual and Aromantic as well.
Pansy spun the bottle and it landed back on Harry. "Truth or Dare?"
Harry watched as Draco struggled to do what he was telling him to, and held his hands as he slowly came back to him. "Are you feeling better?" Harry asked when Draco finally squeezed his hands back, tears still running silently down his face.
Hermione handed Ron a chocolate frog and Harry decided it might be a good time to leave and look for Draco, as well as allow Ron and Hermione a moment alone.
"Alright, well I'm leaving. Good luck with your homework."
Harry sighed again, "You are extremely difficult you know. I just thought it'd be a good way for us to actually get to know each other better, with the truce and all."
"So, what are you doing for the holidays?" Hermione asked, to the slytherin friend group, but to no one of them in particular.
"Don't worry, we'll bring some next time," Dean said, wrapping his arm around Seamus' lower back.
Draco headed to Pansy first and he seemed to be admonishing her.
Draco coated his erection with the lube, positioning himself at Harry's entrance and slowly pressing inside of him. Planting kisses on his neck from behind, continuing until he was completely inside. Draco tilted his head to look at Harry and noticed his eyes shut tight, tears forming at the sides, and jaw clenched.
"Ew, gross, I don't even want to think about that," Harry groaned, moving to snatch the map back.
"I'll try and sneak away from Ron and Hermione on the train to see you if you'd like," Harry said and he rounded up the last of his things to take down to the Hogwarts Express.
"I'll go," Draco offered a bit too quickly, but he knew what was about to come if he let Pansy ask him, he wanted to put it off as long as he could. He leaned over to Lavender to be able to whisper in her ear. "Who here would you want to snog?"
Harry felt like an idiot as he made his was back to the castle carrying Draco's soaked robes. Why did I have to kiss him? he asked himself.
"Come on Draco, it's just a dare," Blaise laughed, finally joining in.
"Well, when you think about it..... it was pretty obvious I guess," Hermione finally said looking over at Harry who at this finally started to look up and over at Hermione and Ron.
"Yeah," Harry replied through gritted teeth, "Just give me a moment... to- to get used to it."
"Hey Harry, Hermione, Ron," Luna greeted them in turn, "You look happy today Harry and the Wrackspurts around your head seem to have been growing lately too."
“‘M’kay,” Draco said, following Harry out of bed to shrug on some pants. Recently he’d started making sure to put on clothes when he wakes up because Pansy had a bad habit of coming through their floo unannounced and a couple times she’d caught them both quite spare of clothes.
Silence.
"Oh! No worries, thanks for the apology," Seamus said with a smile.
"We went to the library this morning to get some homework done and lost track of time," Harry said and Draco had to cover his mouth so they didn't hear the laugh that struggled to escape.
"It's alright, it's just a game," Harry replied with a shrug he thought was convincing.
"Well it is past two in the morning," Ron said. Dean and Seamus had fallen asleep together on the couch, Romilda Vane and Milicent had gone to bed an hour ago, Pansy and Blasie were beyond drunk and were starting to get a bit hysterical, and Harry was becoming sleepy with the amount of alcohol he had consumed.
Draco sat back a moment to get his pants off and Harry's own quickly followed Draco's off the side of the bed.
"You know, now that I'm thinking about it, didn't you say that Draco was red?" Ron snickered a bit.
How could it possibly get any worse, Harry thought. Now, not only did Harry have to hang out with Draco, he also had to hang out with him in public.
"There is no point to this, it just won't settle," Draco flopped down onto Harry's bed next to him. Harry stared down at him as he put his arm dramatically over his face.
Two hours of Pansy fussing over him and he was on his way to meet Harry for dinner.
"You have. Why?"
Harry turned then and went into the restroom to get ready for bed.
"Well I only ever really knew a few people there. Well I mean, I knew everyone, but I wasn't friends with anyone except Pansy, Blaise, Crabbe, and Goyle. So, the parties were always really boring, just a bunch of walking around and greeting people. My father would make me dance with all the young women around my age."
Without another word, Harry scooped him up and dropped him in the water, robes and all. Draco came up sputtering and shivering a moment later.
"Yeah, saved me from a few detentions," Harry laughed, placing the map into the bedside table drawer and leaving the notebook on top of the piece of furniture. "I suppose we should probably get up if we want to go to Hogsmeade today."
Draco on the other hand was very interested in the tryouts. He actually knew quite a few of the people trying out, so he was more interested in who would make the team than Harry was. Harry enjoyed watching Draco get into the practice game that was being played below them, he'd never really realized how much Draco liked Quidditch. Harry watched Draco's lips move up and down in response to what was happening in the game. The corner of his lip twitching up when he saw a particularly good play, or his forehead creasing when he saw something he didn't like.
It was hardly convincing, but Hermione dropped the topic.
After the war had ended, Harry had become a bit of a recluse. He stayed at the Weasly's house for the summer because while he technically had a house, he just felt that Grimmauld Place was a bit too cold and empty and much preferred the warmness of the Weasley's house. Because of his stay at their house for the summer, it meant he didn't have to go out much. This meant that the papers where going nuts trying to get interviews with him, crazy rumors started, mail from all over was showing up at the house, and when people got wind that Harry Potter was returning to Hogwarts the media had a field day. For this very reason, Harry didn't want to go back.
"Better?"
"Uh, hi Zabini," Neville replied. Blaise had changed since the war, well everyone had for that matter, but Blaise had definitely changed for the better. Although Neville still didn't really consider them to be friends. Not that he minded Blaise calling out to him in the slightest though, as Blaise's voice was something Neville didn't mind hearing so much and that had nothing to do with the faint blush that spread over his cheeks. Nothing at all.
Harry suddenly felt a bit embarrassed about liking Draco as he remembered just how much Ron hated him. How stupid could he be for thinking that there could ever be a possibility that they could get along. "Since several days ago. We've decided to try and be friends." Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.
"Why not?"
"Thanks, Malfoy. For listening," Harry said, a small smile gracing his features. The small smile made Draco happy and they both slid down into a laying position. Draco took the damp towel off Harry's neck and dropped it over the side of the bed.
"I didn't make any face," Draco suddenly tried to pull his hand back but Harry held fast and laced their fingers together.
The next two days seemed like they'd never pass in Harry's opinion, but soon it was Halloween and Draco had agreed to go with him to Hogsmeade for their first date.
"Are you able to see what color you are?"
"Well of course."
Draco studied him for a moment before standing up, pulling Harry with him. "Come on, let's step out."
Draco shot him an annoyed look, "And why would I tell you? Now if you don't mind, I quite liked the silence."
"You want to go on a date with me?" Draco finally said, eyes drifting down to the box of Alihotsy leaves he held in his hands.
Ron, on the other hand, stripped down to his pajamas and only managed a "good night" before he was out. Harry waited a few more minutes to make sure he was out before sneaking out of bed and making his way down stairs. He could only hope no one would wake as he was on his way down.
"When we get back to our room, you need to lay down. I'll run you a bath."
"I had to use the restroom and then I couldn't go back to sleep!" Ron shouted, moving to search through his dresser drawers. "Oh! I found them!" Ron cheered when he opened his sock drawer and found his things he jammed in there last week when he hurried to clean up for Hermione.
“Well, I mean, you are right,” Harry started and both Ron and Hermione turned to look at him, Harry was surprised they didn’t get whiplash.
"Thank God," Ron said, rolling his head back into his arms.
"Erm-" Harry looked away from Draco and avoided his eyes. He really didn't want to bring up how he thought he might like guys, especially not before he was sure.
The sound of his name from Harry's mouth sent him over the edge and he stood up, fumbling with the button on his pants, pulling them down with his underwear. Draco leaned back against him letting their erections rub against each other and his breath caught in the back of his throat.
"I did. I'm sick of people saying false things about you and believing stupid rumors."
“Are too.”
"Well that concludes the torture for the day. I'm leaving," and with that, Draco walked swiftly out the door without a second glance at the Gryffindors.
"Thanks, it means a lot," Draco said and Harry suddenly felt a surge of fondness for the boy, that he quickly fought to ignore.
"We should probably head to my room," Draco laughed as he pulled Harry back to his room.
"Harry..." Draco dragged his name out as he sat up. No response came from the other side of the room.
"Wait, stop-" Harry said as Draco leaned down and planted a kiss on the corner of his mouth. Harry's mind seemed to go a bit blank. Draco was kissing him again, he thought, and it'd be so easy for Draco to attack him right now. He couldn't seem to push him away though and he found himself leaning into the kiss as Draco's hands found their way to Harry's hair.
"Alright."
They walked up to the counter to pay and Blaise took the chocolate frogs out of Neville's hands, "I'll pay."
"We should go too Malfoy, we still have to do our punishment for the day," Harry said, turning to Draco who didn't look pleased.
"What?" Harry asked, turning from the shelf where he'd just picked up a handful of chocolate frogs.
Draco stared at his reflection in the mirror in Blaise's bathroom. He was dressed in dark pants that hugged his hips and were rolled at the bottom. He also had on a pair of black shoes and a plain light-blue long-sleeved shirt he had gotten over the summer.
"Yeah," Neville said, sending him a smile.
"I will not."
"Hurry up, or he'll wake," Dean whispered in Seamus' ear when they opened the door and Seamus slipped in. It was almost one in the morning and the room was pitch dark except for the small amount of light streaming through the window. Seamus turned to look back at the group that was hovering by the door and Dean gave him a thumbs up. Seamus turned back around to look at Goyle who was fast asleep and unsuspecting in bed.
"I didn't follow you, we just happened to see you two when we sat down."
“As I was saying,” Harry continued, less nervous now that he knew his friends were just going to make fun of him for making a mess of things rather than liking Draco, “I was going to ask him, but I ended up just making him upset.”
"Hi Mrs. Weasley! Happy New Years Eve."
"Yeah, and everyone will be over their hangovers by Monday," Seamus said snickering.
Draco was just putting Harry's bag on his bed when he walked in. "Nice cover."
"You didn't answer my question."
"Veratesirum," Harry replied.
They made their way around a bend in comfortable silence until Ginny broke it again to stop Luna in her path. "Do you want to do something else tonight?"
"Thanks for having me for breakfast," Harry said awkwardly, "but I really should be getting back to Ron's house. They're probably worried."
Draco casted a tempus charm and, realizing it had been a little over an hour, started gathering his things.
"Oh we knew," Ron said nonchalantly.
"Muggles are weird," Draco muttered, but still went to try and sit up again.
Barely anyone looked up at them as they came down the stairs, at this point seeing them together wasn't really a novel thing. They were practically always together. The few who did look up though watched as Draco and Harry laughed like old friends the whole way to the door
"Yeah, I'm fine, just tired. Late night last night."
----------------------------
Hermione couldn't express her gratitude when it was finally time to head down to the pitch. She couldn't take anymore of them.
I'd love to meet up with you. Everyone here also goes to bed shortly after the ball drops. I can apparate to yours if you want?
"So, are we not gonna address the elephant in the room?" Blaise finally chimed in, "How on earth did you score a date with Potter?"
Draco looked up at Harry, his green eyes sincere and a warm feeling filled his stomach, "Thanks."
"Wait, I wanted to apologize," Draco said and Hermione looked at him like he had a third eye. "For everything that is."
"Alright," Harry laughed, "and what of food?"
"Time to get up," Molly said as she entered Ron's room to wake him and Harry up, "Where's Harry?"
The pillow hit him square in the face.
"Wait it feels like-" Draco couldn't finish the sentence, his face already coloring a dark shade of red.
"I see," Pomfrey said, writing on her clipboard, "What made you guess this specifically?"
The game began with Madam Hooch's whistle and then all the players were in the air. The announcer was a small Ravenclaw boy, he had to have been no older than a fourth year, Harry thought. The kid wasn't biased and didn't constantly need Mcgonagall telling him he couldn't say certain things like Lee Jordan, Harry figured that might have been part of the reason he got the job.
"No, don't stop, please," Harry practically begged, leaning his head back to look up at Draco, gasping slightly. Draco started to continue slowly at first but then began to pick up the pace, thrusting into Harry as he leaned forward to capture Harry's lips in a kiss. Soon Harry's moans turned from slight pain to pleasure as he started to relax and grind back on Draco - rolling his hips in small circles that slowly got faster until their movements were erratic. Draco grabbed his hands and pushed them above his head on the wall.
"Never have I ever kissed on a first date," Pansy said happily and downed a bit of alcohol. She then looked 'round the circle to see Lavender, Blaise, Dean, and Seamus taking a shot.
"So do you want me to run a bath for you?"
The second the seal broke the thing popped open and started spewing little fireworks and Harry could make out fancy cursive writing sprawled across the paper.
"They're on a date," Draco laughed and filled Harry in on Blaise asking Neville out a week ago.
They all walked down to the Quidditch pitch together. Ron and Hermione, Pansy and Blaise, all in a group at the front. Draco and Harry were both lagging behind a bit, too wrapped up in each other to even notice the growing distance between themselves and their friends.
"Who of the boys do you think is going to get married first?" Ron asked Harry.
"We aren't friends, I don't need to talk to you every moment of the day." Harry felt his stomach drop a little at Draco's words.
"On the bright side, the colors are sort of pretty," Harry said with a small smile.
Pansy sat forward a bit as she watched the bottle spin, fingers crossed...
"What do you want to do? There isn't much we can do for that matter," Draco said, turning his head to look over at Harry.
Before he could respond though Ron butted in, "If he did anything to you, I swear-"
"We found Harry," Ron shouted when they entered the house and Molly came hurting around the corner engulfing him in a hug.
Draco and Harry separated when they made it down the stairs, but Harry continued to wear the jumper the whole night. If anyone thought anything of it, they didn't say anything.
"Nine!" Everyone joined in, with varying degrees of enthusiasm.
"Goodnight, Draco," Harry said and drifted off as well.
"Shush. Now all you have to do is ask him out and I'm sure he'll say yes."
"I dare you to-" Pansy slurred her words a bit, she had by far drunk the most. She looked around at the group looking as if she was contemplating something, and then her eyes landed on Draco who didn't seem to be paying much attention. "To snog draco. And I don't mean any of that little kid shit where you just sit there with your lips touching. You gotta actually kiss him."
"One day I think I'd like to be a teacher here at Hogwarts," Draco said, looking around as they walked down the street, "I'd get to visit Hogsmeade every weekend and teach kids potions. I don't suppose they'd hire a Death Eater though."
Harry, instead, was currently thinking about how Draco didn't seem to be bothered at all by the fact that Neville and Blaise were both guys and that was surely a good sign. Right? Before he could get ahead of himself though, he reminded himself that just because Draco didn't care if someone was gay didn't mean he was gay himself.
Draco found him a couple minutes later, tucked on a chair in the corner.
"Yep. Perfectly regular brain-"
"Hey guys!" Harry said as he came up behind Ron and Hermione.
"Don't worry, I won't. What about you two? Anything new?" Harry said with a slight smirk at Ron who turned a light shade of pink. He knew that Ron had been trying to go a step further with Hermione for months but just couldn't get up the courage. Ron chose to ignore Harry's implication though.
"What? You're saying Harry and Malfoy are gonna starting dating 'cause they're spending time together?" Ron laughed at the thought, but Harry's stomach squirmed at the thought and a light blush spread over his cheeks.
"That's because I am straight."
"Oh that would have been horrible, thank god I didn't waste my one chance at getting you on a date, on that place." Draco smiled a shy smile over at him and Harry broke out in a smile too.
People were starting to get nervous too as it was never pretty when Harry and Draco were fighting. The situation was likely to blow up soon and people were getting wary.
"Nothing," Draco said, "Just Pansy being Pansy. You got away then I see."
"Nope, absolutely refuses." Harry laughed and picked up a package of the candies as well.
"I wasn't planning on going today, don't worry about it. I'm a little hung over too."
"He was still asleep," Ron said, smirking at Harry.
"Get it off yourself," Draco grumbled, picking his wand off the floor as Harry struggled with the vines, "And you should remember covering them." Draco watched Harry struggle for a moment, "Oh wait, you slept through the whole class, that's right."
Draco sent him a smile, “Get me some chocolate then, you choose, just nothing disgusting.”
"I'll go," Luna spoke up and spun the bottle. The group watched as the bottle spun 'round and 'round and the game had officially begun. The bottle slowed to a stop in front of Harry. "Truth or Dare, Harry."
"I can't believe you got us into this," Draco said, continuing his earlier rant by finally directly speaking to Harry. For the past ten minutes Draco had been making snarky comments and complaints about the situation, as they walked to where McGonagall said their dormitories were. Harry had to say, he preferred when Malfoy was just ranting and he could just stay there silently.
Draco opened his eyes when he heard the bathroom door close and stared off at the wall in front of him. It was pretty bare, especially compared to Harry's side of the room that had posters and Gryffindor stuff all over the walls. Draco had pretended to be mad about them when they first moved into the room together, but he didn't mind, he rather liked them actually. The posters and things were just so Harry.
"Yes, headmaster," they both responded with utter defeat.
"It appears someone tampered with the potion after all," Pomfrey said, "Though we have no idea who, why, or what the effects are except the colors..." She trailed off, letting Harry process the information before starting again, "Do you have any idea who might have done it, or any ideas about the potion's effects?"
The seconds seemed to drag on as they stared at each other. Harry didn't know who was the first to lean in then, but Draco's lips were suddenly pressed against his and he had no complaints.
Harry and Draco had made their way up the winding staircase to the top of the astronomy tower when it was still bright out. It was dark now though, and they hadn't even made a move to leave. Draco was leaning into Harry's shoulder, laughing at something Harry couldn't remember saying. It was long past curfew and they were both loopy with exhaustion.
"Who do you think is most likely to marry someone twice their age?" Hermione asked Ron.
Hermione stared at him a moment longer before saying, "so like we're all different colors or something?"
"Yelling at him about it isn't going to change anything, okay?" Hermione said, a pleading tone in her voice, "Plus it's getting late, let's just go inside okay?" Ron continued to glare at Blaise.
Harry laughed as they bickered over Ron's eating habits and Ginny turned towards him. "Did you go to Hogsmeade with Malfoy?"
"What are we? First years?" Blaise said.
"Because it's all juvenile prank materials. You could cause a better prank with magic from your own wand, and that's free."
"It's not like it's all that great."
"Yeah."
"I already told you, I don't want to go."
"I'm excited for that one!" Ron said excitedly and then blushed when Madam Pince sent him a look from across the library and he lowered his voice, "You gonna come watch us beat Gryffindor, 'Mione?"
The next day was a Sunday which meant Draco and Harry didn't have much to do with themselves until Quidditch practice started and so Harry spent most of the day in bed while Draco complained.
"Do you have a crush on someone in the circle?" Neville felt the back of his neck heat up. He knew how playing games like this worked at Hogwarts: it would be impossible to lie, he only had a few moments to take a shot if he didn't want to answer before his answer would burst from his mouth without any control over it.
"Please?"
And as for Draco, his friends weren't so forgiving. Pansy took it upon herself to shout "Saint Potter~" in a high-pitched voice every time Draco left to see him: successfully allerting the entire eighth-year, Slytherin, dorms to Draco's endeavors and embarrassing him in the process. This embarrassment was partly due to the fact it would catch the whole dorms attention, but mostly because it had more meaning than just a dig. It was right after Christmas break and Pansy walked in on Harry teasing Draco about things he said in the past- hence the 'Saint Potter'- and then thoroughly snogging Draco.
"Yeah, and our last match for the year the 28th against Gryffindor."
"Yeah but she's in a happy relationship. I know I have no chance, you, on the other hand do."
Harry and Draco had decided to go to Hogsmeade again on Saturday and were now bundled up in warm clothes as they made their way to Hogsmeade. Harry had plans to stay with Draco for the two hours of their punishment and then he was going to meet Ron and Hermione.
"Wake! Up!" Harry's sheets were violently thrown off him to show a sheepish Ron and an angry looking Hermione.
"You don't sound very straight when you're complaining about 'Potter this, Potter that'," Blaise said with a laugh.
"Yeah, wish Luna was here?" Harry responded.
"Fabulous," Draco said and tried to sit up again before Pomfrey pushed him back down.
While it shouldn't be as weird to witness because she had seen him do the same thing all of sixth year, it still was strange watching him stare at Draco across the room for the tenth time this week. She figured the reason she found it so weird was that they were actually friends now. She had no idea what was going through his head either. The look on his face was a mix between contemplative and nervous and a whole slew of other emotions she couldn't place. The whole thing was weird.
"Alright, alright," Draco said, still breathless, before doing as he was told. He watched in awe as ink slowly spread across the parchment, and opened it up to check out the contents. "Is this... Hogwarts?"
"Oh there you are! We were wondering when you were going to show up, Harry's missing too."
Harry scooped Draco up in his arms and carried him over to the bed, Draco letting out soft laughs the whole way there, Harry smiling as well.
He looked over at Ron who was sound asleep on his bed, snoring peacefully. He sighed laying back down and relaxing back into his pillow. They'd all stayed up late the night before, opening presents and eating junk food. He was about to close his eyes and try to fall back asleep for a bit longer when he heard tapping on his window. With a groan he got up to open the window.
"Didn't know you were in here either until I looked over and saw you a second ago either," Harry lied, looking down at his book before Draco looked at him too closely and caught him in the lie.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stared across the room, now. Watching as Draco's head bobbed as he laughed quietly at something Pansy said.
---------------------
"Oh don't go getting upset," Pansy said rolling her eyes, "That wasn't meant for you, it was for them." She shot a look at Draco and Harry who sat defiantly staring at their plates and had been very quiet.
"You're ridiculous," Draco said, but he was laughing despite himself and Harry could see the slight flush across his face that told him Draco was enjoying himself.
"Four," they both said at once.
"Yeah, I get you, but I suppose you should just be happy that it seems to be simple right? I am at least. On a brighter note though, would you like to work on homework together and then we could go up to the astronomy tower or something."
"Yes I can and I just did. There's no rule against it, now both of you start snogging."
Two hours later, they found themselves leaning against the wall of the cave next to each other, a fire burning in front of them.
-------------------------------
Breakfast had been pretty quiet, except for the low murmur of people talking about the quidditch match the next day. It was to be between Slytherin and Gryffindor, which meant it was going to be a rowdy match.
"No I don't think so-" Harry started but Draco cut across him.
"Should we head out to Hogsmeade now?" Ron asked when they'd left the board.
October 31, 1998
"Shoot," Dean said stopping and turning back to him.
Harry set the picture frame back down and reached over to grab his transfiguration homework from his book bag that he set on his bed. He'd been having a hard time focusing while him and Draco studied lately and he now needed to finish his transfiguration essay, quickly, before Draco got out of the shower and stole all his attention away from homework again.
"I don't have a date with him, I just decided to dress nicely. Is that so wrong?"
"We should probably go to our room..." Draco said in embarrassment and Harry was eager to comply.
"We're in a first-name-basis now," Harry replied, trying to hide his blush, but Hermione noticed it anyway. Her eyebrows rose slowly in recognition.
Harry glared back at the two and Hermione sent them a questioning glance, "I'll be fine. Just sore."
Harry watched in amusement. A few months ago he would've thought it impossible for Draco to eat in any way that wasn't "dignified" (Draco's words) and yet here he was watching him scarf down a sandwich like he hadn't seen food in months. Sure, it was less messy than Ron, but still not anywhere near "proper" (again Draco's words). He supposed there were a lot of things he would have never thought possible a few months ago.
"You're his little sister, he cares for you more than you know, and I don't think he cares much what gender you like anyway."
"Oh whatever. Draco, do you mind if we come up here for a bit? We wanted to discuss the Quidditch teams for the eighth years, you might actually be interested." Draco stiffened at the use of his first name, but let it go. Granger really wasn't that bad, and he knew she was only trying to be friendly.
"I don't want to spend the whole year like this."
When he appeared in front of Ron's house, he hurried towards it. It was already pretty bright out and he knew they'd be waking up soon if they weren't already awake that was.
"Must have gone to breakfast early," Harry said failing at keeping a bit of disappointment out of his voice, but if Ron noticed he didn't comment on it, "So, why exactly are you in here hovering over me? I doubt you just came here to wake me up."
"Oh that's a brilliant idea!" Hermione practically shouted earning herself four bemused looks from the four other boys.
------------------------------
"I was sure you were going to pick Finnigan over me," Draco said, finally looking up at Harry.
"What? I'm happy for her," He said to all the stares he was getting, "and I have a feeling I know who it is and I'm glad for that."
"I told you... hah... to stop, now you're a mess!" Harry said breathlessly, fussing over Draco's face and he laughed.
Draco slid down next to him laughing as well as he leaned his head against Harry's shoulder. "I never thought I'd ever pull a prank with you of all people."
"Great," Draco said.
"Alright, my turn!" Blaise said as he reached for the little bag, "Never have I ever kissed more than ten people." Blaise, Pansy, and Lavender all took a shot shamelessly, and looked rather proud of the fact.
"Yeah."
"Ready then?" Draco asked when Harry was bundled up in warm clothes.
“No kidding,” Draco laughed.
“That had to have cost way too much money,” Draco said skeptically.
Harry cried out, savoring the feeling of Draco's tongue trailing circles around his nipple as he soothed the bitten nipple and moved to the left. He could feel the heat in his stomach building and when Draco sucked rather roughly on Harry's nipple it completely undid him.
"You don't have anything else you need to shop for?"
"Well that went a lot better than I was expecting it to," Hermione slid into the seat across from Harry that Draco had just exited.
Harry's lips trailed their way down to Draco's neck and he pressed light kisses to Draco's skin as he made his way toward his collarbone. Draco let out a soft groan and ground down into Harry.
"What's your favorite color?"
"Today we will be brewing a potion called . Does anyone know what it does?" Slughorn asked. He was standing at the front looking around at everyone. Harry often felt like he was in a glass jar around him, like some sort of attraction.
Hermione and Harry were the only ones to take a shot and Hermione shuddered at the memory. She did not like flying.
Rolling her eyes with a laugh, she looked over at Harry, "Are you and Malfoy sitting together?"
Before you read this I just want to let you know that there is mild smut in this chapter. It's extremely light – clothes stay on – but I still thought I should let you guys know before you read. You'll know when it starts, because it's pretty obvious. Happy reading!
"You wouldn't," Harry said as he reached forward and grabbed both of Draco's wrists and pulled him under the cloak as well, his anger melting as he pulled Draco towards himself. He could see the sorry look in Draco's eyes and he knew Draco well enough to know that the fight earlier was just Draco's fear talking.
Draco,
(See the end of the chapter for
That's when the post came in, no matter how long Harry had been at school it still amazed him.
"None of your business," Draco responded a bit harshly which just made Harry slightly mad.
Harry,
"What was that about momentum now?" Harry said with a laugh.
Maybe he is going to do it, Draco thought to himself, there’s still hope. If not, I can always do it myself. “Sure, I’d love to,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand up in his own as they made their way down the street.
He turned around and was immediately engulfed in Draco's scent, either this person was soaked in Amortentia or it was Draco, and Harry was pretty sure no one had drenched themselves in it. So that leaves-
"Well, there's you three of course, Dean, and surprisingly Pansy."
"What did I tell you?" Harry was laughing.
Draco readily agreed, not wanting to imagine the rumors that would spread if they were caught like this: clothes and hair rumpled, pink-lipped, and snogging on the side of the hallway.
"There's so much," Draco said as he came to look down at the drawer. "We don't have time to look though, Filch could be back any time."
"You know, if you ever need to talk to someone you can talk to me, right?"
"You're awake," Draco said, noticing Harry staring at him as he collected his clothes to change, "Good morning."
"What-" Harry started, shock lacing his features, "What was that?!"
After a minute Harry pressed back against Draco, "Move," he said, slightly panting.
"Fine."
Warm water was poured over Draco's head to rinse the suds off and then Draco made Harry use his shampoo and conditioner ("who on earth uses two-in-one hair wash!" Draco had said, horrified.) and when they were both clean they rinsed off in the shower.
Draco sent him a smile.
"Even if I was interested in Potter, I don't need your help."
"There's hardly any drama around here these days! Everyone was confessing left and right after the war ended and now that everyone's in happy relationships, no one has any pain for me to enjoy anymore."
Harry felt his ears heat up, "Who says I went to go see anyone 'special'" Harry made air quotes with his fingers.
Harry's hair was sticking up in directions Draco didn't know were possible and, on top of that, Harry was bright pink from laughing at Draco's face slowly becoming more distraught. Draco thought it was terribly cute though and was probably the reason why he hadn't given up earlier.
"He did?" Harry finally asked.
“Well they did, mostly. Sometimes if too much is going on though ontop of all the colors, or there’s a lot of people, it can be a bit much.”
----------------------------
"No, he would have said something if he did," Harry said, walking to the bathroom to get dressed.
The walk to Hogsmeade was quieter than usual and when they reached the Three Broomsticks for lunch it was boarding on awkward.
"Yeah, it seemed the whole room was glowing while we were in the common room, I think the flashing lights added to the effect."
"Yes! You've been in it right?"
Draco
When it was finally over, Harry practically jumped up, leaning down to help pull Draco up before another person could kiss him.
"Truth," Draco sighed.
Hermione figured she'd have to talk to him about it after this though.
-------------------------------
He couldn't help feel cold without Harry's hand in his.
"AH!" he gasped, "D-Draco.."
“I’m sure they’ll figure it out eventually,” Draco finally said, quietly.
"Doesn't need to know. We can keep it a secret and we can always blame it on our punishment if we're caught," Harry said, and a bit of a mischievous look came about his features.
"I can see you as a healer more than I can see you as an auror," Draco said thoughtfully and Harry sent him a smile.
"Draco," Draco looked back up at him, "Listen, I don't mind okay?"
Harry
"A weekly party?" Harry asked, sitting forward to lean his elbows on the table.
Harry was starting to climb the stairs to the dorms when Ron stopped him, "So, you and Malfoy?" Harry's heart stopped for a second. "I mean, are you two okay? I can only imagine how awkward it is to have to kiss him every time there's a party."
Then again, when he thought about it, Draco had never really been reserved with touching him. The amount of times they'd held hands was staggering. Harry felt himself heat up at the thought. Was he thinking I liked him that entire time-?
"I don't care who is going to be there."
"What plan?" Draco said, placing his homework down on his bed.
"Dare," Harry said, giggling a bit.
Draco let out a sigh as he turned the page of his own textbook and jotted down a couple notes Harry's stomach flipped a bit and had trouble trying to focus back on his work.
"You- you can't be serious about this Potter!" Draco's face was getting redder as Harry sat down in front of him, and he just hoped everyone would attribute it to the alcohol in his system.
"In that case, Macmillan's out too, he couldn't even manage to stay on his broom the entire tryout," Ron replied.
"Great! I'll go get Ron," with that Hermione was bounding out the door to get Ron who was still in the common room.
Draco decided to copy Harry, pressing his finger into him slowly. Harry let out a small groan at the odd sensation and Draco pressed in further, still unsure what he was doing. He moved about for a minute before pressing a second one in as well, Harry sucked in a breath.
"I know Hermione," Harry said tiredly and plopped down onto one chairs in the corner next to Seamus, "He's just always in the mood to fight!"
Draco felt his cheeks heat up, "okay," he said quietly following Harry down the stairs.
"That's my job as your best friend. It's also my job to get you to do fun things, and that is why you should come to the party."
“That settles it, you’re meeting me to practice your dancing, I’m not going to be seen with you if you can’t even dance.”
"Well it didn't work Pansy! So what now!?" Draco practically yelled and watched as Pansy shrunk back in the way she did when she knew she was in the wrong. "I need some fresh air," Draco seethed, throwing on his shoes and leaving the room.
He knew he was zoning out, but he was quickly jolted out of his thoughts as Draco turned and Harry quickly avoided his eyes. It was weird to stare.
"I can pay, don't worry about it," Neville said, blushing.
Draco watched from across the hall as Harry received yet another love letter. He didn't know why but it pissed him off, and when it started spewing fireworks and Harry's face turned pink he grit his teeth and stabbed his sausage with a bit more force than needed. Pansy looked over at him.
Draco looked at her like she’d grown a second head, “What on earth would make you think that? He very clearly turned me down.”
"I told you two not to bring alcohol, they're underage," Hermione hissed to Dean as she waved towards where Luna and Ginny sat, talking quietly between themselves.
"You don't have a plan do you," Draco said sighing, rubbing a hand down his face.
"If you take me to Madam Puddifoots I won't hesitate to kill you in your sleep," Draco said as he caught sight of the horrid shop.
"Draco, huh?" Ginny said with a smirk as soon as Draco was out of earshot. Harry quickly reddened.
Blase was blissfully aware of the implications of Pansy's teasing though, and simply joined in the fun.
Harry returned a few minutes later. "Need help getting up?"
"What?" Harry asked, slightly worried now.
"I don't see why not, I mean it's a fun thing for the eighth years to do and it would give the house teams more practice," Hermione replied.
There was a general head-nodding in agreement. "Great. Try and score as many points as you can and good luck!"
"Yeah, they're one of the more common plants here. There's an area over there," Draco pointed off to his right but the place was so dense with greenery that Harry had no idea exactly what he was pointing at, "that is filled with wolfsbane. It was planted here during the war, we only had a couple of them, but with Fenrir Greyback living here we planted more to be safe."
"Hey," Harry murmured back.
"Now, in light of recent events, I implore you all to be kind to everyone regardless of house, status, blood, or otherwise. It is no time to hold on to petty rivalries and the like because what we really need right now is unity. I hope you all take this into consideration.
"The Forbidden Forest."
"No problem, you're welcome any time," Narcissa said, "Draco make sure to show him out."
"So you immediately turned to pranking?"
With that both boys got up and left, eager to get out of her office.
"I just had a feeling that something was happening and had to be here for it," Pansy said, appraising Draco, "and it seems I was right. You're wearing those black muggle pants. You'd only wear those for Potter and we both know it."
----------------------
"I see you dressed for the occasion," Draco laughed.
The restaurant was definitely an expensive one, Draco noted as they followed a waiter to their table. He was used to going to expensive restaurants, but it was rare for Harry to take him to one, or even suggest it.
Neville's smile made Blaise's stomach flip, he really liked it when Neville smiled. During their eighth year, he hardly ever saw Neville smile.
Harry remembered seeing them on the marauder's map last night, up late in the common room and his lips turned into a small smirk. He had an idea to get her off his case, "and what were you doing up so late? Draco and I were looking at the marauder's map last night, and you two were up oftly late in the common room last night." Harry was only teasing her to get her off his case, so he wasn't expecting it when her face heated up like a tomato. Then, if he wasn't surprised enough, she let out a loud gasp that drew the entire class' attention, which only made her turn redder.
The bottle slowed to a stop in front of Draco and everyone seemed to hold their breath for a moment. It had been two weeks since they'd last kissed at a party and everyone was dying to see what'd happen.
"I cannot believe that you two couldn't even make it to two weeks!"
"Yes."
The thing that made them part was actually both of them reaching for each other at the exact same time. Their hands both came to each other's face and that was when they both snapped out of their trance and pulled away, albeit reluctantly.
After breakfast Harry had a free period that he planned to use as time to go explain the color's meaning to Madam Pomfrey. On his way there, though, all he could hear were girls stressing about what they were going to wear.
"Definitely," Harry grinned, giving him a light kiss, "Now I better get going, I love you!"
"There's a lot of suits of armor around his office right?" Draco asked, an idea slowly forming in his head after a long moment of silence.
He felt a tap on his shoulder then.
Draco used some spell that Harry couldn't hear to remove the red rings from his eyes from crying before heading down to breakfast.
"So?"
Harry paced around his dorm room, Ron had just left so he had the room to himself. He'd been thinking about Draco kissing him for days and it was starting to hurt his brain. He had a million questions.
"Alright, let's go there first then," Harry said as they arrived in the outskirts of Hogsmeade.
"I don't think they will," Luna said softly.
"Well, I just picked who I thought would be the best for the team," Harry shrugged, sitting on the edge of his bed, looking over at Draco.
"You didn't go too far, I was just scared and saying whatever came to my head, I'm sorry," Draco breathed into his shoulder as Harry wrapped his arms around him, and then added, "I think you're pretty cute too."
"What do you mean," Ron whispered back, in complete confusion this time.
"Exactly," Ron grinned and Hermione had to give in.
"I don't know if that would have been the best idea," Blaise said, face still red and head running with traitorous ideas.
"Stop making people kiss people they don't want to!" Ron shouted and glared over at Pansy and Blaise.
"Hey," Harry said, coming out of his stupor.
——————————————-
Hagrid gave him a curious look but handed him some meat anyway, "Sure, just watch yer hands."
"Malfoy isn't actually a bad roommate, he's just sort of quiet. He keeps to himself most of the time," Harry said, shoving a piece of bacon in his mouth.
"Aren't you worried someone is going to catch us?" Harry said, panting.
Dean immediately turned his smirk to Harry, his eyebrows wiggling suggestively.
"Hmmm?"
"You're sitting with the Gryffindors today?" Hermione asked, smiling over at Luna who was seated between Ginny and Neville. Some students had been switching tables recently and McGonagall seemed to be thrilled by the easy display of house unity, but Luna was the one who switched tables the most, by far.
Harry then realized it was Monday, which meant they had potions first thing. He cast a quick tempus and freaked out when it showed class had started ten minutes ago.
"I didn't want to get back together with you because I was starting to realize that I might not like girls and I didn't want to lead you on." Ginny's eyebrows went up at that, that was not what she was expecting. Harry continued, "Don't get me wrong, I do care for you, but as a sister." Harry took a breath, he hoped that she wouldn't be mad at him.
"You like both? That's a thing?" Harry asked, reeling from the information. You could like both? He could like both?
Hermione was quick to raise her hand and Slughorn happily called on her. "It's a potion made from the Alihotsy plant, sir, it causes uncontrollable laughter."
"Of course, as I said, I'd love more help," Neville said with a slight laugh as they finally reached McGonagall's office. "Lemon Drops."
"I was a Death Eater, and will be one as long as this mark remains on my skin." Draco yanked his sleeve up, showing the dark ink that painted his skin. It was slightly faded now, but it was still there and Draco hated to look at it. He yanked his sleeve back down. "And my father too, he wouldn't be okay with me dating a guy, let alone you. He'd kill me."
They both slowly pulled away after what felt like both an eternity and barely any time at all, eyes still closed and breath mixing between them.
"Oh yes, he brought me food when he could. He didn't do much else, but I know that he couldn't afford to do much else in his position," Luna said, smiling down at her food. Ginny took her hand under the table and gave it a squeeze. There was something final about what she said and everyone let the subject drop.
"Okay!" Hermione said as she dropped a notebook onto the dinner table, startling Harry and Ron who were arguing over the new Quidditch season lineup and who they thought would win. "I have written out a list of everyone who tried out for the eighth-year team and what position they tried out for." Hermione opened up the notebook and Ron and Harry leaned over to read.
"Last Friday... I know you remember it or you wouldn't be acting like this. Did you mean anything by it?"
"What- what happened last night stays between us okay!" Draco shouted in a panic and quickly got up and hurried off to the bathroom to hide his quickly reddening face.
"Where'd you get that from," Harry said, eyeing the sweatshirt, "Thought you hated muggle things.'
"Oh ha ha."
"What on earth do you think you're doing?" Snape hissed when the classroom door closed behind the last student. "First I hear you lost it on your housemates when they called Granger a mudblood, then you dye your hair blue, and then I hear you're associating with Hagrid and Granger."
When Ginny got the bottle in her hands she prayed that it would land on anyone other than Ron. She gladly leaned over and kissed Luna when it landed on her. The kiss lasted longer than the prior ones and Pansy seemed to be pleased that the game was picking up and she tossed a bottle back, taking a big gulp of the burning liquid.
"Of course!" Harry said smiling, "I was actually going to ask you if you wanted to go."
"Exactly! And then, the brighter the color, the more admiration or respect you're feeling for someone!"
Draco made a noncommittal noise and closed his eyes. The sun streaming in the window was brighter than he ever remembered and everything seemed just a bit louder than usual.
The shock was evident on everyone's face, including some of the people around the group, but before anyone could say anything Draco looked up and glared at Pansy.
"Sounds great."
"He didn't seem to be actually interested in playing for the team," Harry laughed a bit, "Plus, you have much better broom handling skills and are more experienced."
"We'll figure it out, I'm sure. For the meantime, we can keep trying to think of what the colors mean, it could be something interesting," Hermione said.
Harry stopped Ginny in the hall after dinner as soon as he made sure no one else was around.
They all turned to look at Luna, they'd never known that. She never really talked about the war or being at the Manor, hell no one really talked about the war.
Harry slowly dragged his teeth against Draco's thigh, biting softly and Draco let out a low moan. Draco writhed on the bed, wanting friction, needing it. Harry pressed kisses up Draco's left leg stopping at the place his hip met his leg.
Draco sucked in a breath, and stared intently at Harry.
“Wow,” Harry said, inspecting a shelf of chocolate in all different shapes, boasting different treats in the centre, “There really are a lot of new flavors. I bet George would like some of these ideas for his joke shop, he’d probably find it a lot of fun coming up with weird concoctions to put in the centre,” Harry laughed picking up one with an orange flavoring in the centre.
"Pass," Harry mumbled, avoiding Draco's gaze.
In that moment he realized that Pansy was right, that he was perhaps in love with Harry Potter, and that was one of the reasons he was never going to tell Harry. He couldn't stand the fact that Pansy was right and he knew that the second he said anything she'd never let it go.
"Leave it to you to read a book over the summer on room expansion spells just to try and figure out how we're going to be rooming," Ron said turning to Hermione with an exasperated look.
"What was that about?" Blaise said from his bed, having had woken up when Draco started screaming.
When she reached the top of the stairs she turned the doorknob to their shared dorm room to find both boys tumbling over each other and a mess of blankets that seemed to be Harry's bedsheets. The sight of Harry and Draco smiling and messing around brought a smile to her face and she burst out laughing at how odd the sight was.
The new color did not go unnoticed by the student population and by the time he got to class most everyone was whispering about it.
"I already said no alcohol."
"Alright," Ron said, feeling sort of nervous at the serious tone Ginny had used. He gestured to the booth and they sat down. "So what's up?"
"Never have I ever gone skinny dipping," Draco had said, his words slightly slurred from the alcohol and he then tipped his glass back, shameless.
"You ready?" Harry asked Draco, leaning over to him to whisper in his ear as they were packing their bags up to leave class. Despite Draco's nervousness, Harry's breath grazing his ear and neck didn't fail to make his skin prickle and send a shiver down his spine.
Hermione noticed the lack of bickering immediately, turning to see Draco grinning at the match and Harry staring resoutly forward, face painted a bright red. She shook her head in exasperation.
When Harry finally pulled away they both looked a bit disheveled and red. Their lips were swollen and Draco let out a little laugh.
Harry didn't know this either and decided he really needed to ask Draco about what he did when he wasn't with him when he got back.
"Uh- what are you doing?" Draco asked warily, glancing at the door behind Harry.
"Not at all. She's insufferable," Pansy said with a scoff, "Always telling me I should be more lady-like and then going and throwing herself at the feet at any man who offers a bit of power and money, like a common whore."
The end of the quarter came faster than Harry expected and he found himself seated next to Draco at the Gryffindor table at the feast the day before everyone would go home for the holidays - or stay at the castle.
When they finally reached the dining hall it was already packed with people and they had to squeeze in to fit near Hermione and Ron at the table.
When Ron walked through the door, he couldn't help the groan that escaped him at the sight of Draco.
Harry tried to focus his attention back on the pitch, he had come out to support Ginny after all. She was the new captain this year and looked right at home out on the pitch running the practice. She had a bit of a practice game going and Harry noticed a kid he didn't recognize playing as seeker. Harry had to admit, he was pretty good, he was glad that the Gryffindor team seemed to be in good hands.
Draco looked down at himself. The idea of substituting his daily shower for the scourgify charm was not appealing in the slightest, but he figured it'd have to do, "Alright."
"But think about it Draco, Potter will be there too. Won't you Potter?"
Harry suddenly woke with a gasp and sat up very quickly, causing Draco to jump back. He was drenched in sweat. Harry stared around, wide eyed until his eyes landed on Draco and he let out a sigh of relief.
"Yes, because I don't," Draco responded, starting to get up from his perch on the couch.
"What do you want?" Draco said sharply, rounding on Harry as soon as the door closed.
"Damn," Harry mumbled, still slightly put-off that he wasn't currently snogging Draco.
"Wait! Slow down! He kissed you?! Oh my goodness! I'm so happy for you Draco!" Pansy said, throwing her arms around him and hugging him. Draco allowed himself to smile a little bit, he was extremely happy after all.
"Hey, Longbottom," Blaise said as he slowed down and came to a stop a few feet in front of Neville.
Hermione snickered as Ron complained.
Harry hurried along behind him, smiling.
“I just remember how much you didn’t like them in school,” Draco laughed, accepting the cup of water.
“Sure,” Draco said, grateful for the subject change.
"Not really."
"What's wrong?"
"But that doesn't make sense. Draco was working on it with me, whoever did it couldn't have known Draco wouldn't be next to me when it exploded. Someone getting revenge wouldn't attack him."
"Yes you do. All the time actually," Draco laughed a bit and Harry was glad that Draco was laughing again. Harry paid for his candy and they left the shop, curious stares following them out.
"Mmm" is Harry's only reply as he leans forward and grabs Draco's shoulders, pulling him into another heated kiss that Draco smiled into. Harry's head felt fuzzy and all he wanted was to be kissing Draco.
Harry bristled.
Draco let himself feel happy at the complement and smiled over at Harry, which made him smile back.
"Did you get anything from the trolley?"
"If you could change your roommate, who would you choose? Besides Ron," Lavender asked Hermione.
Harry and Draco had spent the weekend awkwardly shuffling around each other after Saturday and they had hung out during their free period in the morning so now Harry had the entire rest of the late afternoon and evening to himself. Because of this, he ended up in the common room with Ron and Hermione as they did homework - or more accurately, Hermione did homework. Ron and Harry had given up on homework a while ago and were engaged in a game of wizards chess. Hermione had stopped trying to get them to work after a few tries.
Harry and Draco were currently sitting in their shared room, each on their own bed. Draco had suggested reading since they were to be stuck together for two hours. Harry didn't particularly like reading but agreed since Draco did. And now Harry was bored, like he knew he would be, and was currently trying to get Draco's attention from across the room. He'd caught himself doing this more and more in the last few days, during their time together Harry had been wanting to actually get to know him more. So now here he was, a week into their punishment, sitting across the room watching Draco read.
"You have to hang out with each other for at least an hour a day on weekdays right? Well if you come to the party, then that'd count as hanging out right? As far as I know, McGonagall didn't really give you any rules on that." Draco and Harry both stared at her for a moment, neither of them had thought about that. "Plus, of course, there's also the reason I'm going: there's going to be alcohol."
Tuesday started long for Blaise, he woke up to Ron throwing things all over the room in search for who knew what.
"Draco!" Harry whisper-yelled. No response.
Luna and Ginny were back as well and were seated between Seamus and Harry on the other side of the circle. Ginny was already drinking out of a cup Seamus had handed to her and Hermione was sending looks at Dean who was ignoring her.
"You're welcome. Now remember the spell for next time or you'll catch a cold," Draco said. Harry turned his attention back to the pathway, he rubbed his hands together and breathed on them as they walked towards the pitch, but Draco's eyes lingered on Harry for a moment longer than they should have.
"Oh, hey Draco. Yeah, I'm alright," Harry said, turning and wincing as he took a step.
Draco let out a sigh in his sleep as he snuggled in closer to Harry. He ran his fingers through Draco's slightly damp hair then, messing it up just slightly. Turning back to his homework, he kept his fingers in Draco's hair, absentmindedly running his hands through it as he worked.
"I don't think we should be using that room for a party, Harry," Hermione said.
He liked this better though.
"Well if it helps any, I'm sore too," Draco tried.
Harry didn't seem to be planning on waiting for an answer though, and was standing up and hurrying out of the room as fast as possible.
"Okay, you get the ones on the furniture by the fire and I'll grab all the others," Draco said, already moving over to a chair, "Grab the cushions while you're at it too."
"Oh he's nice like that," Luna responded, "he helped me when I was at his manor last year."
Hermione hurried off to finish homework and dragged an unwilling Ron along with her after they all finished lunch and Blaise and Pansy hurried off as well with a silent "Have fun" mouthed at Draco - to which he replied with a very particular hand gesture - leaving Harry and Draco alone.
“Good, I want to take you out to dinner tonight.”
"Oh, we all know that you like him Blaise, don't act like you're just going for help," Draco said a smirk spreading over his face.
"If I have to have this conversation again, I will have no choice but to take more extreme measures," McGonagall paused to let it sink in, "You two may go, I don't expect you to finish your punishment today, you both clearly need a break. But, I do expect you to do so in public tomorrow."
"Oh it's quite alright," Hermione said as she managed to pull herself together and wipe her eyes, "I just was worried that you two were fighting again, but I'm glad to be wrong. Anyway, how much more time do you two have?"
"You two could actually try and be civil," Hermione sighed. Even with everything that they had all been through, Hermione had realized that many that they hadn't gotten along with before the war had really just been a bunch of kids caught up in a war. After the war, and Draco's trials, Draco had mellowed out. Hermione saw this, the only person he still showed any of his old fire with was Harry.
"Truth," Hermione said, before Ginny could ask.
--------------------------
"Alright," Draco said. They stood feeding the thestrals in silence for a moment until Draco spoke up again, "I wanted to say I'm sorry."
“I think my leg may be broken, but before we go to the hospital will you marry me?” Harry interrupted, a slightly pained look on his face.
"You act so surprised," Hermione hissed back.
Draco looked up from his book to stare blankly across the room at Harry. "What the hell is a bucket list?"
"It's Monday, Draco."
"I suppose you're right," Blaise said, watching as Neville continued to water the plant.
“No way, you seriously figured it out?” Ron laughed a bit, suddenly interested, “Oh this is gold, you gotta tell us who it is!” Hermione shot him a look but he either didn’t see it or ignored it and kept his eyes trained on Harry.
"Hey, Harry," Hermione said when she saw him enter, "I was just telling Ron that I'm hoping to make it to his house for New Years and then staying until we ride the Express back."
"Draco, Draco," he could hear someone saying, "breathe, you're panicking. I'm right here okay? It's just us."
--------------------------------
"Alright then Hermione, let's give the people what they want," Pansy announced as she pranced on over to Hermione who was slowly getting redder by the moment. Ron, who sat next to her, looked aghast.
"Yeah, if that's okay?"
"I'm alright," Harry said, reaching out and bruising his hand over Draco's where he'd placed it on the edge of his bed. Draco seemed to hyper-fixate on his hand then, allowing Pomfrey to finally be heard.
"Why is that even a question?"
"I have to agree with Malfoy," Hermione said, "It just doesn't seem like something Voldemort's followers would do. Something isn't right."
The group seemed to be a mix of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor students and Harry couldn't help but be happy at how houses were mixing more.
"You're doing it again," Ron said, noticing the look.
"The chocolate frogs," Neville said, picking up a couple to buy, "You?"
"You want to go to Hogsmeade? Together?"
"Well I did tell you it wouldn't." Harry turned slightly and pulled his legs up onto the bed, leaning back on his arm to look at Draco.
His hair caught the light and seemed to glow in the sun, though it could also be due to the fact that he actually was glowing.
Harry was a goner.
"I just suggest trying dating a guy," Seamus said, "Or try being with a guy, if you know what I mean." Seamus wiggled his eyebrows and Harry went red.
"Really? That's good then!" Hermione said.
Draco moved out slightly before thrusting back in, causing Harry to cry out and Draco quickly stopped.
"We've known you liked Potter for years," Lucius said, glancing over at Narcissa.
Snape stopped him the next day after potions class.
"Draco." No response.
"Anyway, I have to hang out with him for at least an hour on weekdays and two on weekends. She said it was to promote 'inter-house unity' and all that."
He threw open the bottom drawer on the left to find it over-flowing with contraband. Everything from fireworks to dungbombs.
"For the prank you git, not whatever you're thinking."
Harry blushed, “I just thought it’d be a nice breakfast.”
By the time Ginny picked up the bottle to start her turn, Draco wanted to stop playing. He in no way wanted to watch as Harry kissed another person.
"It's from Friday's party," Harry said, quickly tugging his shirt over his head.
"That's great!" Hermione said happily and Ginny beamed over at her. "Do you two want to join us? I can get a waitress over here for you two if you'd like.
"You can't come watch the tryouts if you're just going to shout at everyone!" Ron was yelling at Blaise when Harry finally got to them.
"Nothing. You're just really cute."
"Potter, wake up," Draco said, "Harry!"
Harry stared at her a moment, still trying to get over the fact that you could like both, and that's normal. He finally found his voice after a moment of stunned silence though, "I think I am too."
Draco shuffled his feet under the table, staring hard down at his butterbeer that had been placed in front of him a minute ago. "I just wanted to apologize," Draco finally said, not looking up, "I shouldn't have just kissed you. If we can still be friends I'd like that." He felt his hands find the cup and his fingers wrap around it.
"Even after kissing him?" Pansy looked mildly disappointed.
Draco started to move then, yawning and raising his head up to look about himself. When his eyes settled on Harry's shocked form it took him a moment to respond, but when he did he suddenly jumped back muttering sorrys.
Harry thought about how soft Draco's lips were as he made his way into the compartment Hermione and Ron currently occupied. He'd miss being able to kiss Draco over the break.
"Of course, with Dean here," Seamus said smirking at Ron and holding their linked hands up as Dean rolled his eyes at him.
--------------------------------
Harry Potter — seeker
Hermione studied him for a moment, "I- I'm not sure... would you care if he did? Like Malfoy I mean?"
"If I had known you were going to throw me into the water, I wouldn't have come."
"It's because you're too close!"
"We wouldn't go in too deep, just around the backside of the lake. It'll be fun."
Harry looked over to where Lucius was sitting, calmly looking at the paper and then over to where Narcissa was stabbing at her eggs. He looked back down at his own, figuring it might be better to keep his eyes on his food. Is this how meals are normally at their house? Harry wondered absently, I've heard of families eating their meals quietly, but I've never actually witnessed it. He decided it was quite awkward and wouldn't do it again if he could avoid it. Well it could just be because I'm here.
Harry glanced away as Draco managed to pull on his shirt and he felt his cheeks heat up. He had to stop looking at Draco if they had any chance of winning the match, he needed to focus.
"I thought it would work, Draco! And you all were taking veritaserum anyway, if you had admitted your feelings everyone would have just thought it was the potion!"
"Sounds good to me," Pansy said, "I'm starving, I thought that match would never end."
This was unlike any of their kisses they had shared before, this time they were both sober and no one was forcing them to do so. They just were.
"Thanks a lot, Draco," Harry said with a smile, "I'll see you later back at the castle!" With that Harry rushed across the street to meet up with Ron and Hermione.
It made sense to Harry, Ron and Hermione were clearly in love with each other and always seemed to glow brighter when they were particularly happy with each other. "How did you piece it together?"
"So what's up with you?" Hermione asked, taking note of Ginny's slightly stressed appearance.
He really liked being with Draco though.
“Probably.”
When the clock in the corner chimed midnight, everyone started to get up and pack the alcohol up and head to bed. Dean and Seamus rounded up the alcohol as they usually did and Seamus snuck a bottle to Ginny to take with her when Hermione wasn't looking.
A/N: Trigger warning, homophobic language is referenced, though it is not directed at anyone in specific.
"But seriously, why won't you admit it?" Pansy said, causing Draco to shut his book again with a sigh.
"Well I vote Bulstrode out, she couldn't hit a bludger to save her life and I'm pretty sure she was just out there for a laugh," Harry said.
Draco watched as Dean crossed the circle with an odd twisting in his stomach. He wanted to punch Dean in the face when he leaned down to kiss Harry. The kiss wasn't very long but it still made Draco want to strangle Dean and he sat silently fuming as the next round was played and Harry had to kiss Ginny.
Draco sent him a glare but continued, "He kissed me about two weeks ago and then cornered me in potions the other day and asked me out."
"Just from years of living here I suppose, you get used to it."
"Hey."
"Ughhh-" Draco groaned, flopping face-first onto his bed, "I'm such an idiot to fall for him. I have absolutely no chance."
"See anyone with a different haze?" Draco said, watching as Harry gazed around the room.
"I've been meaning to ask, growing all the potions ingredients just you and Professor Sprout must take a while."
“I’m pretty sure no one is going to be paying such close attention to our dancing that I need to be perfect at this.”
"I'm pretty sure the potion is done, so today we just need to put it in vials and bring them to Headmaster McGonagall," Neville replied.
Sure enough, points were being racked up by Gryffindor as Draco grumbled beside him.
"And didn't think to give you some for me too," Ron groaned into his arms.
"It'd be a perfect way to promote inter-house unity!" Hermione said, growing excited.
Hermione's cheeks pinkened slightly and she let out a breathy laugh, "Boys," she muttered with a roll of her eyes as she gave him a light kiss.
---------------------
"I have more wolfsbane for you to deliver," Neville said, as he handed her the vials.
“And? I have more money than I’ll ever need or want from my dear mother,” Pansy said with a scoff, “Now try it on.” Draco moved to put it on and Pansy stopped him, “Oh! I nearly forgot, I got pants too,” she said moving to grab the dress pants from her closet as well. “Go try them on too,” Pansy said, ushering him out of the room.
"You think the color is ever gonna wear out?" Ron snickered to Harry and Harry chuckled in response.
Draco,
Draco didn't say anything but Harry could see him looking at him worriedly. "Well, there's always the possibility you two simply messed up the potion," Pomfrey looked over at where Malfoy was sitting, "though I know that you're pretty good with potions, so it would seem more likely that someone tampered with it."
“Yeah, you could say that-”
"Oi, I'm trying to be concerned."
"Just food then," Pansy said, picking up a sandwich to take a bite of.
Draco sent him a goofy smile and played with Harry's hair a bit before pulling him down again.
"Sure!" Harry said, jumping up and dropping the money for his butterbeer on the table.
Ron, however, looked absolutely horrified. "That's so wrong Pansy, Harry you don't have to do it."
"I was just at Hogsmeade," Harry said casually. He barely cared about Hermione's concern at the moment, though, he was too busy feeling like he was floating. It had to have been the best day of his life and he could never remember enjoying a date like this before.
Even though Ginny never said anything and went on like everything was normal, he still felt awkward and felt as though he should really talk to her and give an explanation. But then again, what would he even say? "Hey, sorry I haven't asked you out again, but I don't think we should get back together because I think I might be gay"? Like hell if he was going to say that! Hell, he didn't even know what he was feeling! Sure, he never really liked any girls before, but he also never had any crushes on guys either... at least he thought not.
"Sure didn't look like that. He was sitting there with that dumb look on his face staring at you. Anyone could see that he was at least checking you out. I could see it from across the room."
"You didn't need to do that..." Draco said when they made it into a hall where no one else was around.
"Did I miss anything?" Harry asked Ron and Hermione when he arrived.
"Always good to stay stocked up," Harry joked and Draco shook his head and reached to grab a chocolate frog to buy as well. "But yes, I do have a stash of candy. But I'm not telling you where it is, ever." Draco raised an eyebrow at him. "Not even Ron knows where my stash is."
Draco
Harry watched Draco pin up the last blanket to the wall with a sticking charm. Draco had insisted they put the fort together without magic - except for the sticking charms - because "it's more fun that way." Harry enjoyed it, he'd never really made a fort before and was excited that he was making one with Draco. If there was anyone he wanted to make one with, it'd be Draco.
Harry moved back to his bed where his homework had been left forgotten. He picked up his potions book, looking it over. He still couldn't believe he was back here sometimes, it was so weird to come back and have a normal school year after so much had happened the year before. He couldn't complain though, it had given him a second chance at a lot of things and had also allowed him to be friends with Draco.
"Did I?" Harry said, pretending to not know what Draco was talking about.
"Well you were at the party of course (A/N I guess I should clarify that the party they are talking about is not the one from Halloween at Hogwarts - that was just something I wrote for fun - the party they are talking about I didn't write.), but afterwards I'm pretty sure Harry stayed up a bit longer. He was still on the couch when we went to bed," Hermione said.
"So who is this 'friend' you went to visit, Harry?" George interrupted with a smirk.
Harry looked over at Draco, this was news to him. As far as he knew, it was only Blaise and Neville working on brewing the potions. Harry broke out into a smile and pulled Draco into a tight hug. "You're amazing, you know that?" Harry mumbled into Draco's hair as he hugged him.
“Harry comes to me for help planning dates more than you think,” Pansy smirked, “He’s dreadful at it you know. Anything nice he’s ever planned for you was at least partly due to me.”
Harry yanked the door open when they reached their room, chucking the pillows into the room and quickly closing the door when Draco made it into the room.
Practice was awkward again and had people curious. Harry tried his best to avoid Draco during practice to quench some of the curiosity, but it seemed to only make it worse as people seemed to pick up on that too. When it finally ended for the day, Harry left as fast as he could.
"Ah... wait- Draco, ah! Stop! I'm gonna..." he panted, trying to remove Draco from him, but Draco reached around, grabbing his hips to make it impossible for him to get away. "Draco- AH!" Draco felt Harry's whole body shudder as he came in his mouth.
Harry smiled as he enjoyed the feeling of Draco's lips on his skin. Draco continued to kiss Harry's face though, his lips pressing a kiss to Harry's temple, his nose, his shoulder. Harry let out a soft giggle as Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him towards himself.
Harry's head jerked as he realized what he'd just thought, turning towards the match, face bright red.
"We should hurry to the Great Hall and try and beat some of the rush getting in the doors," Hermione suggested to everyone as they made their way down the stands. Many students were still mulling around the stands and if they hurried, they could make it into the Dinning hall before they got trapped in a big crowd.
“Shit!” Harry said, frantically checking the time that read 10:56. He was going to be late for sure if he didn’t get going immediately. “I’ll see you later tonight!” Harry called, grabbing his jumper and practically sprinting out the door to the front doors of the school.
Draco looked over at Harry as the letter landed in his lap, Harry quickly looked away.
Tonight they were going out to the lake to work on homework. Hermione eyed him as he made his way towards the door with Draco.
Hermione gave him a contemplative look before seeming to give up with a sigh, "Well you could still take someone you know, just don't do whatever Ron is suggesting."
"He's not that bad you know," Neville spoke up, "He's been helping with Professor Sprout's and my project and he's very helpful."
"Are you feeling any better?" Draco asked, their shoulders bumping as they walked down the hallway.
Draco looked at Harry for a long moment and Harry was beginning to feel awkward when Draco let out a long sigh, "Fine, but if something happens to me, you'll have to answer to my father."
"Harry!" he suddenly heard Ron's voice shout when he neared the house. "Where have you been?! We've been looking for you for ten minutes! Mum's worried sick!"
Changing was a whole other issue, as soon as Draco took off his shirt Harry was assaulted with the memory of the night before.
The trek out to the edge of the forest by the lake was a bit long and Draco had to redo the heating charm on himself twice before they got to the far side of the forest.
"What's going on over here," Hermione said as she walked up with a smile, "Did I miss the party?" she slid into the booth next to Ron and pulled her butterbeer up to herself.
Snape cut in then, "It seems someone has slipped amortentia into your potion; that, or you happened to accidently put all of the ingredients into your potion," Snape drawled, obviously angry about the inconvenience, "Though I highly doubt even you'd manage that."
Draco and Harry had climbed the winding staircase till they reached their room, which was situated at the top of the stairs. Games had ended early as the eighth-year Quidditch team had their first match the next day and they all decided it'd be a good idea to get decent sleep the night before. They also stayed away from alcohol for the first time since the game nights had started.
"I like the idea," Hermione said, "but we'll need a bigger place than the common room."
Harry liked how they were starting to hang out outside of the common room, and were doing things together that weren't homework. Of course, they still worked on their homework together as they still had to complete it, but more often than not they were actually doing something fun. He wondered what it would have been like if he had been sorted into Slytherin or Draco had been sorted into Gryffindor. Would they have been friends? He liked to think they would have.
"Truth or dare?"
"Have you ever liked anyone?"
"Wait, for real?" Draco asked, completely shocked.
"Okay guys," Harry said, quickly turning around to address the group and avoid the possibility of an awkward discussion with Ron. "Just because their team is younger than us doesn't mean they aren't good or should be taken lightly. Our score in this match doesn't matter towards the house cup of course, but that shouldn't mean we go light on them as it's still a good practice match for both of our teams. Got it?"
"The seats are way too cold," Harry shivered a bit as he sat down on them and then cast the heating charm on them that Draco had just taught him and sighed in relief. "Ah that's better."
"Hey, Draco-" Harry began.
"What was that all about?" Harry asked when Draco emerged from the compartment.
"Thanks," Ginny whispered to Seamus as she tucked the bottle into her robe's pocket.
"I think Malfoy," Harry said, leaning over to circle his name on the paper.
"Uh- yeah, alright. Goodnight," Harry muttered, climbing into bed and grabbing a book off his bedside table to read a bit before bed.
"I just know how to think on my feet, unlike you," Draco said, walking over and placing his hands on Harry's hips, pulling him further into the room.
“Ow.”
Hermione (bless her, Harry thought), seemed to notice he wasn't feeling great and managed to disperse everyone, leading him over to the couch by the fire where they were able to sit down.
--------------------------------
Hermione thankfully decided to interrupt then, "Do you know the quidditch schedule yet for this year, Harry?"
"I asked how much of this project you have done," Draco said with a small laugh.
It was silent for a moment as everyone seemed to process what Harry just said.
"What! What do you need Pansy?" Draco said, finally paying attention to the girl who was laying next to him on the grass and had been calling his name for the last few minutes.
Pansy looked around at the group gathered on the stairs before rushing after Draco. "Wow, your father isn't going to like that very much," she said, leaning against his bed frame.
"Well, each color deals with a romantic feeling. Red, love; pink, crush; blue, not liking anyone currently; and green, aromantic," Harry glanced over at Draco, taking in the bright red haze surrounding him that never seemed to dim, "and the brighter the color, the more you're feeling that particular emotion."
The party was crazy. That was the only way to describe it.
Harry woke up, head pounding, in the hospital wing with barely any memory of how he'd gotten there. He tried to sit up, but didn't make it up far before he was flopping back onto the bed with a groan, his head spinning.
----------------------------
"Sure, I don't mind," Hermione said back with a smile.
"What's the matter?" Harry said, rolling over and shoving his face into his pillow.
"I don't eat it all in one sitting," Harry said, bumping his shoulder against Draco's playfully. "I like to have candy on hand at all times."
Hermione watched Harry warily as they headed back up to the dorms. She had noticed the tension during the practice and was interested to know what had caused it.
"She said not to pour the water directly onto the plant, not to just not water it," Neville said, finally glancing over at Blaise only to laugh at the annoyed face Blaise was making. "I think I'm starting to notice a trend here," Neville smirked at Blaise who was continuously looking more annoyed with each word, "you just don't listen."
----------------------------------
"I can't believe I'm stuck with Potter of all people. I knew I shouldn't of come back for another year," Draco said, bringing up the room arrangements for the first time since they had walked into the library after class. "And on top of that, McGonagall made us hang out for at least an hour a day to promote inter-house unity or something like that. I mean, I just can't believe that no one would room with him!"
“So in other words you asked him if he had a date to the Yule Ball and then told him he should go simply because it’s his last year, never asking him to go, and all the while holding his hand?” Hermione said, completely disappointed.
When Harry arrived at his shared room, Draco trailing behind him, he fell into bed letting out a groan. He was out in mere seconds, leaving Draco staring at him from his bed across the room feeling strangely disappointed.
Harry smiled after them and made his way back up to the dormitory where Draco was laying on his bed doing his homework.
Draco just stared at him waiting for him to continue, letter still clutched in his hands, and lips pressed in a thin line.
Seamus caught Harry watching Draco and rolled his eyes. How obvious could they be, he thought. It was obvious what they had gotten up to the night before and Seamus wondered if Harry had forgotten they had a match today. From the looks of it, he had.
Harry didn't seem to be planning on saying anymore and Draco let himself relax, leaning into Harry and resting his head on his shoulder.
The eighth years that had come out to try out for the team were currently watching from the pitch as Ron and Blaise yelled at each other loudly in the stands.
"Your hair is atrocious."
Wait, not gay, Ron thought, she likes me, so bi maybe?
"I'm pretty sure it was you who kissed me," Harry said, leaning forward on his elbows, "and you enjoyed it."
Harry let out a contented sigh before falling asleep.
When they made it down the stairs, to the common room, it was thankfully empty.
"Medicine. Muggle medicine. Dean and Seamus forgot to make more hangover potion and I'm trash at making them. Anyway, it'll help with your headache, you swallow it."
"It's too cold to get in. It's November."
"I didn't know that!" Ron said, surprised as he looked over towards Blaise and Neville, who were blushing and backing up from each other.
------------------------------
When Harry showed up, Draco was with him and they quickly separated to go to their respective tables.
-----------------------
Draco was about to answer when he remembered something, "Wasn't today a hogsmeade weekend? I don't want you to miss out on it taking care of me."
When they got to the Dinning hall, Pansy dragged Draco and Blaise over to the Gryffindor table, "Mind if we join you today?" Pansy asked, already sitting down across from Hermione.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck, pulling him in closer, "hmm," he hummed.
Two scourgify charms, and a trip to their dorms to get their bags, later, they were pulling the doors to the potions classroom open.
"Dean and Seamus?"
"Yeah, you've got that right," Draco said, slumping back into the pillows. It was quiet for a moment and then Draco noticed the pink highlights in Pansy's hair, "Did you do those yourself?"
"I just need a new quill first and then we can go, it'll be quick," Draco laughed as he dragged Harry into Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop.
Blaise glared at him, "Being pan doesn't mean I don't have standards."
Draco's head whipped towards him, "You do?"
“Don’t you like the snow?”
Blaise groaned and slumped into Neville who seemed pretty happy with the turn of events.
"What?" Draco said, finally tearing away his eyes from the Ravenclaw girl to give Pansy a reproachful look, to which Pansy only raised an eyebrow. "I am not."
"Oh, the tryout dates for Quidditch have been put out. Of course, none of us can try out tho. Slytherin is set for the 5th and 6th, Hufflepuff for the 7th and 8th, Gryffindor for the 12th and 13th, and Ravenclaw for the 14th and 15th. Speaking of Quidditch, when will the team be announced for the eighth years? Dean's been really excited about it."
"Not at all," Draco said, leaning his head against Harry's shoulder and letting out a sigh.
"Mmmhmm," Harry said with a smirk, "Want to go down to the common room? I think everyone is at Hogsmeade and we can sit by the fire."
"Ah!" Draco could feel him shudder as Harry slammed his hips backwards into Draco and came for the second time, practically shouting Draco's name as he tightened around him, sending Draco over the edge.
Harry let out a sigh, “Well, I was going to ask him to the Yule Ball and-”
------------------------------------
"Yup! Apparently we all have Wrackspurts around our heads though," Seamus laughed and Luna smiled at him.
"No," Draco grumbled, pulling at the hem of his shirt in nervousness, 'We're just going to hogsmeade."
"Well that too."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Better?" Hermione asked, watching as his eyes seemed to clear.
"Wait, what?" Draco asked, suddenly shocked.
"That's true. My parents want me home for most of the break and they aren't even wizards, I'm just hoping I can come to your house for a bit of it," Hermione said. (I'd like to note that i'm imagining she went to find her parents during the summer after the war ended and restored their memories, as it's not really a key event in this story I'm not really going to cover it.)
No one else seemed to know either and when he related this to his mother, it sent her into a state of panic and in a minute everyone was looking for Harry, per her instructions.
“Ah,” Draco said, eyes traveling down to his drink as he took a slow sip.
"Of course you're going for the alcohol, though I didn't even think about that being a way to complete our punishment," Draco said when he stopped laughing, and Harry forced himself to look away, face turning red.
"I'm alright, thank you!" Hermione called back.
"Think you'd join if they managed to pull it off?"
-----------------------------
Madam Pomfrey let out a long suffering sigh. There was no way to win with these two, ever since they'd become friends they were unable to be separated from each other. "Alright, if you stay out of my way you can stay," Pomfrey said, moving to grab a clipboard. "It seems like your potion exploded. Malfoy was lucky to have not been hit with it."
"I can't. My father-"
They were on better terms of course, but Draco and Harry had been avoiding each other after what had happened after the last party. It was simply too awkward. Not to mention, Harry was still slightly upset over Draco's rejection.
"Yep! I used to make them a lot when I was younger. With blankets and pillows and stuff."
Harry felt embarrassed as Hermione turned the conversation about Draco back to him, "Yeah, he's been nice. He's just a bit reserved."
After a few trips back up the stairs to drop off the pillows and cushions, they were finally grabbing the last ones.
"Not as far as I know, and Draco is too good at potions to mess up either."
"Are you alright Harry?" Hermione pressed, she was growing more worried about him by the second, and the fact that Draco had just run through a little bit ago with an air of panic around him wasn't helping.
“Wow,” Harry said quietly, slowly opening his eyes to meet Draco’s grey ones.
"What?" Ron questioned.
"Mmmm- what? It's early. Go back to sleep," Draco mumbled without opening his eyes.
Draco simply stared at him a moment longer before he was leaning in and Harry's brain shut down.
"What are the odds you'll let Seamus do your hair." Hermione and Ron turned back to the game as they heard Blaise asking Luna the next one.
"That limp isn't exactly convincing," Draco said, walking after him.
"Well of course! What else?"
"Yes you do. You've been staring at him like an animal in heat for the last twenty minutes as you've been doing for the last seven years." Draco jumped at that and turned a pointed stare towards Pansy who sat next to him.
Draco finally cleared his throat, "We can both eat lunch and then we can fulfil our punishment for the day, after."
"Save it, I already got a lecture from Draco. I know," Pansy said, deflated. She got up then to grab a hangover potion for Blaise.
"Not because it's my house color though! It's been my favorite since before I came here!" Harry shouted back laughing. This game was actually pretty fun. "Oh whatever, what's the stupidest thing you've ever done?"
December 20, 1998
They'd all been given permission to use the Gryffindor locker rooms and Harry and Ron entered them to find Dean already there.
"Nothings wrong, I just-" Harry paused a moment gathering his courage, "I wanted to ask you if you'd be my boyfriend? I know you wanted to date for a bit first, but it's been over two weeks now and we've gone on several..." Harry trailed off, realizing he was starting to ramble.
"What?" Draco asked, turning redder.
"Luna and I..." Ginny trailed off for a moment, "we're dating. I'm bi."
"I do, thank you, but it just makes it worse," Harry laughed, running his hands through it and messing it up worse.
“Yeah, yeah, I know.”
"What did I tell her," Blaise said to Draco as they watched her stumble over to the alcohol table, "A nutter that one is." Draco let out a small laugh and Harry felt his stomach flip at the sound.
“You implied it.”
Blaise glared at her and then turned back to Draco, "What's gotten into you all of a sudden? Just last week you would've had no problem with it."
"Yeah. Thanks."
As soon as the door closed behind them, though, Draco was on him: kissing Harry roughly, hands traveling up Harry's sides under his shirt.
"It wasn't not part of the truce," Harry said, "Help me?"
"I have not been looking at him like an animal in heat!"
"Dare."
“HE WHAT?!” both Ron and Hermione shouted, quickly turning back to him, shock and surprise written all over their faces. Harry winced.
"If you say so... Will you join us after Hogsmeade?"
