Dobby shook his head. “Nothing happened at Hogwarts, but it will soon. Dobby feared that something bad happened to Draco Malfoy so he came back to check. Dobby wants to get Draco Malfoy some help in Hogwarts.”
He looked down at the wand in his hands and broke it in two. Then he threw both pieces over the edge and watched as they fell down towards the lake around Hogwarts. It felt like a weight was lifted from his shoulders as got rid of it. It felt like he could breathe again.
He stopped before they could see him and pulled the Snitch Dumbledore had left him out of his pocket. The sentence on it made sense now. I open at the end. He touched it to his lips and this time, it actually opened for him. Inside was a stone. Small and rectangular, no bigger than a coin.
He stayed there for a moment, keeping a tight grip on the wands in his hands. He looked down at the one he had used to disarm Bellatrix. It had listened to him perfectly as if it was his, but that wasn’t possible because his got destroyed. Looking at the wand didn’t help him though, because he wasn’t able to recognise it. It seemed slightly familiar though.
Without really thinking about it, Draco began to move to the doors as well, dragging both Blaise and Greg with him. They both protested at first and asked what he was doing but in the end they came with him willingly.
All the students he could see seemed to be from any house except Slytherin and for some reason he couldn’t quite grasp, that fact pained him. They had always been on the wrong side of the war, by default. But he felt like he could change that. A new sort of determination rose up inside him and he looked around, trying to find someone who could get him a spare wand from somewhere. He would need a wand if he wanted to fight.
He send a small and grateful smile her way and then, she was gone again, weaving through the crowd to get back to her friends.
Harry looked away and shook his head, his warm hand was still resting on Draco arm. “For helping us get out of the manor. And for fighting on our side.”, he paused for a moment, but before Draco could say something, Harry carried on. “Listen, we’ve always hated each other, I know, but maybe we got up on the wrong foot. We could start again, you know?”
Blaise pulled him into a short hug as soon as he reached him and when he pulled back he looked at him with curiosity. “Where have you been?”
Once outside, they found a way through the crowd of students and wizards and witches that weren’t injured.
In that moment shouting could be heard from outside, and everyone who wasn't occupied with tending to the wounded got up and began to move outside to see what was happening.
He must have fallen asleep at some point, because when he became aware of his surroundings again, there were a lot more people in the Great Hall than before.
Then it finally sunk in. They had won the war, the dark lord was gone. And he was still alive. And that may be the biggest surprise of all.
Draco sighed and went to get up from his place. He wouldn’t want to have him here, he was sure of that. Why would Harry Potter want to spend any amount of time in the presence of the Deatheater that had only recently decided that he wanted to help his side?
Draco really wanted to answer with sarcasm, rile the other up even more, but another scream echoed all around them and he decided against it. If it was one of his friends up there, he would probably react the same way, looking to blame someone else. But even with that in mind, he couldn’t bring himself to actually say it. That Bellatrix was using the cruciatus curse to get answers out of her. He didn’t want to think about the pain that the curse could inflict.
This feels very rushed, and I'm sorry about that. I kind of lost my interest and motivation for this story but I still wanted to bring it to an end. Hope you like it regardless, I still tried to end it in a good way.
Sorry for the late update, I was kinda stuck with this chapter because I didn't just want to recount canon but at the same time I didn't want to make it awfully short. I hope I managed to find a middle way.
Draco lowered his eyes again, staring at his bloody arm again. He couldn’t go to Hogwarts, the Deatheaters would surely attack soon. And he wouldn’t be of any help, he could barely move. He was better off dead anyways so Dobby could just leave him here, lying on the floor, and pretend he never found him in the first place.
They quickly figured out a plan, not that Draco actively took part in that discussion. Not until Dobby turned to him and asked if he wanted to come with them. He took a step back in shock and just shook his head. “I can’t leave, they would know I had something to do with this.“ Dobby nodded and grabbed Luna, Ollivander and the goblin, but he didn’t seem too happy about what was going to follow. Harry recounted the plan. “Dobby, you will apparate them like we planned, then you come back and get us from upstairs. While you’re away, Malfoy will get us out of the basement and go back to them, then he will pretend to try and stop me from getting the wands, got it?“
He ran over to Ron as fast as he could while not getting hit by any curses. Bellatrix had seen him by now but she hadn’t managed to hit him yet. He pulled one of the wands in his hand at random and shot an Expeliarmus her way.
„Are you serious, Harry?“ He ripped his arm out of Harry’s grip and they continued to glare at each other.
And that was when he understood. They wouldn’t call for the Dark Lord as long as they aren’t sure that it is really the boy who lived. And given that Draco had been going to school with him, he would be the best to identify him, right?
She paused for a moment, wand already in hand. She didn’t move. Draco realised that she was waiting for his permission, and he nodded. She smiled again and touched his left arm at the wrist. Then she pointed her wand at it and touched it briefly with the tip. He felt something soft wrapping around it and even though it didn’t stop hurting it felt better with the gauze around it, in a way.
Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for Draco to find out what Bellatrix wanted to do, and Draco looked away. He couldn’t help her, he couldn’t do anything. When the screams started, Draco turned away and left the room. Maybe his mother had told him to stay, maybe not, he was trying to tune out all sound, to be able to ignore the screams, and couldn’t properly hear her.
He let his gaze wander over it and tried not to think about the future for a moment. He had no idea what he would do, now that everything was over.
His determination became even stronger and he knew, he had to end this before anyone else died, even if he died in the process. He left the castle and made his way to the Forbidden Forest. Halfway there, regret gripped him tight and he nearly turned around again. He hadn’t told Ron and Hermione what he was doing. Where he was going. But he didn’t stop, he didn’t turn around. Hermione would figure it out with Snape’s memory. They would know why he had to do it. They probably wouldn’t forgive him for not giving them the chance to say good-bye, but if he turned around now, he was sure that he couldn’t make himself go into the forest again. Not soon enough to stop anyone else from dying.
He wasn’t sure why he had started doing it, but he had noticed that the food that Wormtail was bringing down there couldn’t possibly be enough for one person, least of all for nearly three. He didn’t have food with him this time, but Harry and his friends arriving changed a few things. Harry’s face had possibly been hit by a spell that would wear off soon and even if not, they would find out about the identity of their guest soon enough, judging by the muffled screams he could still hear from within the walls of the old house.
Blaise seemed taken aback by the question, but Greg was the one who actually voiced it. “Where is your wand?”
Harry looked back to Ron and his friend nodded. Both of them had come to the same conclusion. They couldn’t wait any longer, no matter what Malfoy had told them.
Malfoy? Harry sank back and landed on the sand, the residing water soaking his clothes. He couldn’t believe that he had doubted Malfoy’s intentions. Sure, he has the Dark Mark, and he was always antagonising Harry and his friends in school, but helping out Luna and making a plan with them, that had seemed genuine. And he didn’t kill Dumbledore. He was supposed to kill Dumbledore, but he didn’t. Now Harry was the one staring into the distance, trying to keep track of his chaotic thoughts.
The house-elf actually smiled at that.“Dobby thanks Mr. Malfoy for helping Dobby and his friends.“ He saw out of the corner of his eye how Ron snickered at that, but he chose not to react to it.
Before he could think further about that, he heard someone call his name. He turned to the door and saw Blaise and Greg standing in the doorway. Both looked at him in disbelieve before they made their way over simultaneously.
A noise from behind him startled Draco out of his spiralling thoughts. He didn’t try to turn around and see who or what it was. He didn’t care. Maybe they had decided to sent his crazy aunt to kill him after all.
Harry thought back to what had happened in the manor. Maybe it would have been better if they had taken Malfoy with them. He had said he would be alright, but what if they found out it was him. And the dagger that Bellatrix had thrown. The dagger!
Looking to the side, Draco could see people running around, some of them were limping and he started to register the muffled screams out of the mass of sounds around him. The stench of blood hit his nose and he closed his eyes, trying to block it out as best as he could.
At Harry’s command they both barged through the door, Ron snatching the sword up from the ground and holding it out in front of him. Harry stayed slightly behind him so Ron could try to block any spells thrown their way. Nothing happened. Everyone in the room just stared at them in shock. And Bellatrix wasn’t anywhere to be seen. Harry couldn’t quite believe their luck, especially that Bellatrix had apparently left the room. They had to move fast now before she came back. Or before one of the Malfoy’s got out of their state of shock.
Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Draco pulled his wand out and tapped it on the wall he had stopped at. A door opened and he took a step forward, vanishing into the secret passageways that were twisting themselves through the walls of the manor. He didn’t light the way, he knew where he had to take turns. After all, he had walked this way a lot in the past weeks, smuggling food into the basement.
There were a lot of people he should talk to, people he should apologise to, but for now, he could stay here a while longer. When Harry looked up, he saw someone sitting on top of the one tower that had miraculously survived. He couldn’t possibly tell who it was, but he felt the urge to go up there. Not particularly because of the person but because he wanted to see how everything looked like from up there. Without further hesitation, he started to make his way back into the castle.
Without really thinking about it he sprinted forward, right at Malfoy. Malfoy’s parents still didn’t really react to it, but it had to look realistic so Harry just grabbed Malfoy and threw him onto the ground. As soon as Malfoy had collided with the stone floor Harry gripped onto the wands and tried to rip them out of Malfoy’s hands. He resisted and Harry gripped on tighter, glaring at the boy lying underneath him. Malfoy glared right back and Harry got the bad suspicion that this was Malfoy’s plan all along.
But he had chosen his side and he would fight with them. Because they had a chance again. A chance in the form of the boy he had inadvertently fallen in love with over two years ago.
Even after everything that happened, even after becoming a Deatheater, Draco still had that bit of hope. Hope that the Dark Lord would loose. And if that happened, he wanted to be able to actually have a life after the war. Should Voldemort win, he would be as good as dead anyways.
He couldn’t come up with one plausible reason, so he went to go, but before he could pass Harry at the top of the stairs, he grabbed his arm and Draco stopped in his steps. He turned back to Harry and looked at him questioningly.
He felt out of place again, even more so without his wand. The Deatheaters had positioned themselves opposite them, with the dark lord at the front, leading them on. If they attacked now, Draco would be dead for sure.
The healer in front of him sighed. “I’m not going to hurt you. Dobby brought you here about an hour ago, but I had to tend to some others at the time and you were unconscious anyways.”, her voice was gentle and calm. Nothing like the storm of emotions that was raging inside Draco’s chest, constricting his breath. “I’m going to bandage your arm now, it stopped bleeding, but I still need to clean and bandage it to keep dirt from entering it. The cuts seem to be from a cursed blade so I won’t be able to heal it.”
They had promised Malfoy to wait for at least ten minutes before they went upstairs, so they wouldn’t raise any suspicion against him. Ron had been against it at first, but even he had to admit that it would be saver to keep Malfoy’s involvement out of it. Harry still couldn’t quite believe that he had helped them. It didn’t make any sense. Luna confirmed to them that Malfoy had actually brought food down every day or two, because the amount that they had gotten never would have been enough to sustain two persons and a goblin. But it seemed so out of character to Harry. Hadn’t Malfoy been against them the whole time? And did he really switch sides or is he just pretending?
He tried focusing on his arm again and this time he managed to decipher the word hidden underneath the blood, carved into his skin. Traitor.
A touch to his shoulder made him jump and he immediately regretted it, when all the different injuries all over his body send out flares of pain again. But he didn’t turn around, he couldn’t muster the energy to even turn his head and look at the person that came to end him. He closed his eyes and expected to hear an Avada Kedavra but instead there where light footsteps on the floor.
Draco couldn’t see who the voice belonged to, but Weasley let him go and Harry walked over to the source of the voice. Draco still couldn’t see them, but when they continued to speak, he recognised the voice. “Dobby?“ The house-elf stopped talking as soon as he heard his voice and looked over to him. He had expected to see fear in these eyes, but instead all he found was sadness. “Mr. Malfoy, Dobby thought you would be at Hogwarts. Dobby is here to help Harry Potter and his friends.“ The way he said it, it sounded like he expected Draco to try and stop him. He shook his head. “Go ahead.“
Looking back at the redhead, who was still waiting for an answer, seeing the desperation on his face, he made himself answer. “What do you think?“ It wasn’t what he had actually wanted to say, but he was sure that it was the answer they had expected.
“Did something happen at Hogwarts?”, he asked. He didn’t move to get up from the ground, just looking up to the elf instead.
When Bellatrix came back from the gate, she brought three people with her. She claimed that they had been caught I the woods, putting up a fight to get away. She also claimed that one of them is Harry Potter.
A smile crept onto Harry’s face and he still didn’t let go of Draco’s arm, instead, he let his hand wander downwards until he grasped Draco’s hand in his.
Someone stepped up next to him and he was momentarily distracted from the picture in front of him. He looked to the side and saw Luna standing there, giving him a small smile.
Everything came to a stop. He couldn’t really hear what He was saying, not that it mattered because they were all dead anyways. The dark lord had won. And that meant that Draco could just start to dig his own grave by now. There was no hope left.
He made himself focus properly on the elf and saw the small and deliberate smile on his face. It looked so sad that he couldn’t stand looking at it.
After the fight, the first thing that Draco did was getting rid of the wand. Bellatrix had died during the fight and he didn’t want any reminder of her. His parents had fled when it became apparent that the dark lord would loose and he wasn’t inclined to look for them, not yet. Maybe he would, later on, but not right now.
No one would die anymore, not because of him. Too many people had already lost their life for him. To protect him. He couldn’t bear that thought any longer and it was the only thing that kept him marching on without faltering in his sure and steady steps towards the wall of dark trees.
He squinted up at it and was greeted by big green eyes and pointy ears that were hanging down at the tips. He immediately recognised the being in front of him. “Dobby?“, he whispered, his voice hoarse from screaming. Draco couldn’t believe that this was really happening. Maybe it was just a dream after all. A very vivid dream.
Draco scrunched up his nose in distaste. “Jessie doesn’t deserve to go to the final. She played like a fucking idiot.”
In the time Draco had been daydreaming about Potter-- and how much of a git he was-- the cameras had moved on to the rather motley agglomeration of Easterners. A scruffy man was speaking with a clipped Boston accent, gesturing demonstratively while a meek-looking southern-belle dodged his flying hands. Draco decided he was glad they had decided to impersonate the hippie kind of Americans instead.
“We should fuck behind the waterfall,” Draco mumbled distantly, hypnotized by the dancing rainbows and crashing water.
“Don’t try anything.” He recalled rolling his eyes so far back in his head that his vision had been blurry for an hour. Or maybe that was later, when Harry had unceremoniously cleared the kitchen counter and laid him down, legs in the air… he was getting side tracked.
Harry shrugged. “Internet research. Otherwise, I’d have no idea what was going on at those meetings with Hermione.”
I can’t promise that you and your magic will ever be stable on its own again; I haven’t come across any record of a case where a person was a Horcrux and lived after removing the soul splinter. You are unique in this. However, I believe we can at least find stabilizing measures. If necessary, even with magico-orthetic charms or amulets and reach an increase in life quality for you.
If you believe emotional counseling would benefit me, I am happy to accept the referral to Dr. Bullstode’s office. However, if emotional upheaval will hinder the process of healing my magic, I think it might be best to consolidate my treatments. I may be repressed from my feelings, but I understand myself enough to know that spreading my treatment across several doctors will not be productive. I am an all-or-nothing person, and my magical, physiological, and psychological being tends to be inseparably tangled. If you are going to treat me for magical ailments, you likely should be present for my counseling appointments as well. Unfortunately for me, I think you are correct in the deduction that it is all interconnected.
Draco cringes-- sometime in the last two years with Harry, he has become an awful liar. “We got an inventory shipment.”
Jazz, though, is about the notes left unplayed, and the moment Draco steps out on stage, Harry is suddenly very grateful for his severe lack of preparation. Nothing will ever beat the thrill of seeing Draco in a corset for the first time.
“He is,” Draco nodded, bending down slightly to look into the tank with interest. “Is he a native species, Hagrid?”
Now to your medical history with potions. The potions you took contraindicate Garcia’s Potion, which would have been the simplest approach. In my opinion, we should bring in my colleague Nkoleka Okafor, who is a magico-endocrinologist and can examine your present hormonal state and customize your medication.
Draco was shaken out of his reverie with the crisp smack of a clapperboard as the cameras were moved back and adjusted. Jeff Probst, still smiling, pulled a piece of paper from his loose button-down and studied it for a moment, nodding to the producer as he adjusted his collar.
Once you have configured your gears, you will descend the stairs and fill the second bucket at the base of your platform with water from the large jug. You must then throw the water in the second bucket from outside of the roped-off circle and land it in the first bucket. Each time you throw water, you must climb to the top of your tower and pull the bucket up, regardless of whether you managed to land anything in it, and pour it’s contents into a pail. Once the pail is full, a buoy will be released and your flag will rise. First to raise their flag wins. Let’s draw for spots!”
He was lying on his back on the only sunny strip of what was otherwise a dismally shady beach. He swatted sand flies off his ankles irritably. The old camp never had sand flies.
Harry watched the door swing shut behind Hagrid and gave a heavy sigh. “Great,” he muttered, turning to Draco. “What in Merlin’s name is wrong with you?”
“Shut. Up,” Harry hissed between his teeth. He seemed afraid to even open his mouth at all, lest the dried-up arachnid somehow jumped its way in. It really was awful, Draco amended, all upside-down eight legs in the air. By the time the sour-faced lady had finished, Harry was still frozen with his arms crossed stubbornly over his chest.
“At three, I hold the most Immunity wins of the season. I also found a Hidden Immunity Idol clue, and later the Idol itself, without instructions or prompting. I simply combined my own initiative, knowledge of the game, and ambition to put in the work that would improve my standing. It was these small instances of creativity, inventiveness, and sharp logic that, when combined, put me in the position I am now.
Harry starts as minty magic caresses his skin. “What the--” His eyes narrow. “Draco, are you trying to start something?”
It is Harry’s reaction, Harry’s demand for control, that makes Draco snap. “Fuck,” he says. “Christ, Merlin, Harry, Fuck.”
Harry cherishes these moments-- the casual vulnerabilities. It takes him a moment of reverent silence to realize that he hasn’t answered, and another to realize that he doesn’t have the words to.
Malfoy waits and watches, leaning against an archway. He hasn’t announced his arrival, but he seems to know that Harry has seen him. “What are you doing?” he asks. It isn’t accusatory, or even curious, just words to fill space.
The challenge was a partner one, which meant each player and their loved one would be working together on the challenge.
. Raised beds line the fence, and a bubbling water-feature draws the eye to the center of the garden. It is shaped like a doughnut, the water charmed to cascade in a circle, and the island in the middle primed with fresh mulch. If Draco closes his eyes, he can already see the wild explosion of flowers and lush vines and shady trees. It was perfect.
After five minutes, every player was still in the game, no one having opted to eat straight out of the gate. Draco measured the seconds it took for the ball to travel one third of the track, whispering numbers under his breath to the steady chorus of steel rubbing on wood. He placed his second ball carefully, just after the first. He didn’t want them to be equidistant-- more balls would be added soon.
So it was no surprise-- a relief, really-- when Harry’s lock came loose and his tile shattered in the lurid sound of initial impact and the delayed tinkle of shards hitting the dirt.
“What happened? That bloody toad happened, Hagrid,” Harry exclaimed. “There’s something… we don’t know what it is, but there’s something not quite right with him. We think he might be better off here, with you.”
The donut holes cut in the stones would hold energy for a while, but then I’m sure there are specified spells to draw magic from inside the structure of the rock itself to replenish it. There’s so many stored pockets of energy that the stones never fully ran out, even when wizards drew from the magic and dispersed it into the air for decades. It makes sense why it was so hard to figure out if the stones even had Ley Line magic at all; the hole at the center had long since lost its power, and the rest is just a sliver of magic in each molecule of the rock, and it’s entirely stable. It didn’t want to react with my signature because it was enclosed in a perfect balance.”
Luckily, your magic reacted very fast and burnt the curse away, injuring my arm but preventing the curse that would have killed me from entering into my body.
That Jonas seems to have been just such a prick as Geoffrey. (His opinions were just as antiquated as his name - looking back, I dated him thinking that I didn’t deserve anyone better.) Guess we all have our bad ex stories, and with my experiences with that type of bloke, I can’t imagine that you were the problem.
When they arrived back at camp, the sun was already up. Draco looked at Harry sheepishly and conjured a bucket, filling it quickly with an Aguamenti. “Let me do the talking,” he said. “You’re shit at lying.” Harry grimaced at Draco’s imposed American accent.
The tribes affirmed with a few half-hearted grunts, barely audible over the din of constant rain. Jeff yanked a silver tarp off a lopsided mound in the soggy grass beside him. It stuck for a moment, bogged down by where water had pooled. Underneath were thick blankets and a stack of paisley pillows. Lindsay screamed and Ian gave a little bounce on his toes. Draco caught Isabelle’s eye between shivers.
Stars swim in Draco’s vision, spiraling, consuming, until he is surrounded by shimmering black. The sound in his ears is like sand settling after a wave.
He lines himself up, pushes in slow and indulgent. As he bottoms-out, his eyes open, neck straightening from where it has been tilted up to the ceiling. He wants to watch. Harry is still, mouth open on a sigh and forehead wrinkled: bliss.
Harry is on the couch (well, Draco is on the couch, and Harry is on Draco), green eyes glued to the screen as Billy Crystal yells “
“Draco, you and I both played hard, strategic games. Whereas I trusted my instincts, you trusted your head. In what ways do you feel these strategies are similar?” It was a leading question, and Jones knew it. He sneered at Draco, smug and rotten. It was very Mrs. Trunchbull.
Draco could hardly walk for the rest of the day. He stayed in camp, offering to handle the cooking and cleaning but unable to do anything but sit, stare, and eat. It was a problem, really. Even with the bloody necklace, he still had an alliance to tend to.
“He’s, er, gone through some changes since you left him here,” Hagrid said, glancing at them over his shoulder.
“They think you and Iz are a threat, and they want to take out the one who’s less strong in challenges. I suggested we keep you around for the eye candy.”
Technically, they were there because of Draco’s research on ancient cultural artifacts. He and Hermione had been working for years on a theory that linked unique historical sites to the Earth’s magical core. The idea was that magic, like electric charge, was everywhere, and that wizards simply harnessed it by creating a magnetic pull on the magic in the air. This pull created potential energy, which could then be translated into mechanical energy in the material world and used to perform spells.
Harry led the single-file line of nine remaining players (Ben had been voted out at the previous Tribal) as they marched into view of a rustic set of short wooden bleachers.
Harry kicks his legs, propelling him into the air on a jerry-rigged wooden swing. The lush, silvery birch leaves of the branch that bears his weight flutter in the golden afternoon sun.
Actually, I’d like to thank you for sending me that document. From the bottom of my heart, it meant the world to me. I’d tell you why here, but I’d much rather over-share in person than in a letter. I’m sure the scientific community will be very excited. Do try to keep it out of the press though, okay?
Jeff bobbed his head in a curt, dramatized salute. “First vote: Tara.” Harry’s uneven, slanted scrawl slashed across the page. One corner was splattered with black ink.
As for ADHD, I have actually heard of it. The student-health doc at uni tried to prescribe me something for it along with a few other things, but at that point I was already using potions, and I didn’t want to take anything that might have reacted poorly with them. Visiting a specialist sounds scary, but I suppose it’s likely a good idea. I’d love if you came with me to the appointment, if only to buffer my crippling awkwardness.
Draco grinned and glanced at Harry, while simultaneously replacing the lid of the terrarium. Then they headed upstairs, neither of them noticing the pink spots that Ichabod seemed to have developed.
It was collectively decided that Draco would be the one to attack the orange tribe, and he was pleased. Rather than specifically ask for the role, he had successfully made everyone else think it was their idea first. It felt like a win; Draco had been giddily looking forward to practicing his wiles.
Malfoy wrinkles his nose. “That one has shit swings. They squeak. We’re going towards the river-- I know a spot where the chains are so long that, if you pump your legs high enough, you can look over the whole city. Plus, the slide gets really fast when it rains.”
“You sure they know what they’re doing?” he asks. A team of young men are in the process of digging a large hole at the center of Draco’s back lawn.
“I went exploring the other day,” he said, walking Draco towards a fallen log with sure backward steps, despite the uneven footing. He sat down, pulling Draco onto his lap and running his hands up and down his bare back. “Do you know how bloody crazy it's been making me, seeing you walk around like this and not being able to touch. Merlin, you are stunning. It’s not fucking fair to have a mind and a body so equally fucking
Malfoy grasps one side of the massive yellow handle with both hands, Harry the other. It is textured to look like bubbles. They yank on the count of three, but the door clicks open easily, a rush of cool, cotton-candy-and-chips scented air bathing the hallway.
Harry was staring at the side of Draco’s head incredulously, wishing desperately that he could kick him in the shin without being seen.
Harry pecked Draco on the lips before pulling a peanut-sized tome from his wand harness. Draco took it from him, returning it to normal size and flipping through its doggy-eared pages.
“Good,” Harry said. “I’ll do the plants now. We can check with Hagrid later if there’s anything we shouldn’t put in.”
“Well, if I ever,” he snorts. “Draco Malfoy, caught in a rainstorm. Come on, let’s get you upstairs.”
Potter cleared his throat, and Draco shifted further away from him. “Well, Jeff, I am beyond excited to be here. I feel like I embody the resilience and positivity of the West Coast, and I believe these traits will serve me well in this game. I am here to win, but even if I don’t, I want to enjoy the ride.” Draco rolled his eyes. Potter was not from the United States West Coast-- in fact, Draco could feel the steady buzz of magic in the air as he spoke, indicating that his accent was less than real-- nor was he in any way excited to be playing Survivor. This, in particular, peeved Draco to no end. He had been preparing for months, practicing fire-building in his backyard, picking up a gym membership, and writing up scores of files detailing his fake backstory as an aeronautical engineer in Seattle. The fact that Potter hadn’t even bothered to learn to talk appropriately was a testament to how different they truly were.
The mud ate their feet as they trudged into place, greedily refusing to release them. Draco caught Harry when he stumbled, his shoe having come entirely off. Once they started pulling, however, the mud turned from molasses to vaseline. Both teams opted for merely laying on the ground and slithering like frenzied snakes; when a player would try to stand up to tug, they fell directly on their arse. It was grueling, and for the first time in the game, Draco was more than tempted to use magic. He had never excelled at wandless spells that exerted physical force, but he could get Harry to do it with a pout and his very best puppy-dog eyes. Instead, cursing his sense of integrity, he pushed himself semi-upright with a hand so plastered in mud it looked like an oven mitt and dug his heels in.
Harry leaned into the touch, closing his eyes and turning up one corner of his mouth when Draco’s fingers brushed his cheek. “I’ll miss this place,” he said hazily. “Lots of memories.”
Sixty minutes later, only two players remained. Draco shifted for the first time, the notches in the wood having gouged angry geometric bruises into his legs. He bit down hard on his lip, his brow twisting in a pained grimace.
Draco’s body buzzed with nervous energy as he stepped from the narrow speedboat onto the rickety rope ladder of an anchored sailing ship. In place of a Jolly Roger, a flowing banner reading ‘Survivor Wa’ab: Coastal Divide’ flew from its uppermost mast. Trying not to appear too eager, Draco hopped the railing and boarded the vessel, taking a deep breath of the sweet tropical air and closing his eyes. Following the woman in front of him, he paced the deck, craning to catch a glance at the items littering it’s planks. Single-file, he took his spot on a green raffia rug, shuffling a little so as not to bump anyone else.
Since magic was part of the anatomical makeup of the earth, it had to abide by some sort of laws of physics, but these laws were nothing like non-magical ones. The magic wasn’t constrained by gravity, thermodynamics, or a single Newton’s law. Instead, they had theorized that the Earth contained powerful magical currents that reacted with magic to give it the properties that made it possible to control.
“I know. Come on, let’s have an early night,” Harry said, wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist and giving him a squeeze.
I also have anchored my magic in the woods and garden surrounding my house. This is equally exhausting, but perhaps slightly more productive. The forest is in constant fluctuation between die-back and growth, but during months when I am most overactive, it positively flourishes in an explosion of Hart’s Tongue, Ivy, Honeysuckle, and Dahlias. The ecosystem has an open tap on my magical core, and though it is perhaps not sustainable, I am a willing donor.
you. I thought I was losing it all over again. I thought I couldn’t control my magic. Everything felt so surreal, and it must have been from hunger and sleep deprivation, but I’m spiralling, Draco, and I needed you.”
1) I can definitely NOT be present for all your therapy sessions. As much as your trust flatters me, it would be against the ethics of psychotherapy. With the exception of couples therapy or group therapy, you never have someone with whom you have a shared past present in all therapy sessions, not even your spouse, let alone a former classmate with whom you have a fraught past (and whose entitlement and bad handling of a rejection made your life more complicated than it should have been).
He stares at Harry, crooks his neck, and then turns back around, whispering spells beneath his breath. Harry makes no move to leave, nor to come closer. He watches, lit by moonlight and silvery magic, as Malfoy lifts shards from the ground and knits them, one by one, back to the window. Heat rolls into the room, hazy waves visible where glass meets glass and melts into one. He seems to know where each one goes, and the image of midnight meadow emerges from the knifed rubble littering the ground.
Perched on a knot, he dug through the soggy bracken that had collected in the rotted out hollow, shaking termites and leaf mould from his hands in disgust. He moved to the side of the live section of the tree, marveling at the way it had repaired itself and grown bark where the fallen branch had left a gaping hole. Noticing a strange cavity, he dug further, pulling out a heavy parcel wrapped in canvas.
Harry laughs. “Draco, I’m just taking the piss. You don’t have to tell me what you're doing. I trust you.”
The curtains for the left stage are drawn, rippling occasionally from the flurry of movement hidden behind. Draco Malfoy closes the doors to the right wings behind him, entering backstage. The white-walled hallways of the studio accompany him around the back of the stage and towards the set. He shares a slap on the back with Seth Meyers as they pass near the Weekend Update office and then greets Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, and Fred Armisen where they are already lined up on the blocking tape of the left stage, prepping for the skit .
“Have you ever heard of the Deathly Hallows, Malfoy? The Tale of the Three Brothers? It’s a gift from Death. It’s a trick.”
He also excelled under pressure in a way few would ever be capable of. Uncertainty made him twitchy and irritable and opened the door for purple dishes to emerge beneath his lashes, but it also made him come alive. Harry did not look lost in his body. He did not look afraid. He looked like the colour Moody’s magical eye would turn when he said
He hummed as he showered, lingering beneath the steady spray. He took the luxury of turning the temperature up and down as he fancied, relishing in the feeling of cool water running through his hair and hot steam on his back.
She continued. “I am proud of the game that I played, and I believe I was the example I wanted to model for my children of a calm, kind, decent human being who was able to empathize with others and do the work that needed to be done. I was a stable presence in an otherwise chaotic game, I think that takes a lot of patience and skill.”
The merge feast was there too, under a thick patterned blanket and surrounded by a leafed banquet table. If anyone dropped from the challenge, they would have the opportunity to go and eat. Further, the table was out of earshot of the booths, giving those out early a much-needed chance to socialize.
Needless to say, he did not take well to the test. Retching audibly, he stepped back from the table and cast a fleeting look at Draco, green eyes so big the whites were visible below the irises. He was up against a very smarmy-looking 40-something woman whose intimidating persona was marred only by the splotches of mud and sweat on her navy blazer. She smiled seedily at Harry’s hesitation, and Draco just could not keep his mouth shut any longer.
Draco nodded emphatically. “That must be why the ancient peoples went through the trouble of transporting them. They weren’t tools, they were a
Malfoy giggles, speaking in huffs between irrepressible grins. “I tripped over nothing. The notch only appeared when you caught me.
Draco smiled. He had everything thought through. “During the day, we leave one at a time. You go first while camp is busy in the morning, then I’ll go in the lull of the afternoon. At night, we go together while everyone else is asleep. Every day, we change up the schedule slightly. We play on separate alliances, so we know what is going on at all times. In addition, we use amplifying charms to listen to others' conversations and Muffiato to talk. Obviously, we can’t Obliviate or Confund anyone because of the cameras, so instead, we use subtle magic to our advantage. As for our relationship, we just pretend. Easy!”
Additionally, in order to manifest a force that causes magic to activate, a wizard must input energy of their own. Thus, as my body is a shorted wire between magical charges, I am entirely depleted.
“Things will all fall apart if she stays, anyway. She’ll want to vote for you, and I won’t be able to dissuade her until she’s got Jessie and Claire on board. We have to, don’t we?” Draco added, bitter dejection audible in his low voice.
“Shit,” he muttered, readjusting the position of his shoulders and pushing up with his hands. Draco glanced over at Harry, but he was too preoccupied to comment, his arms flexing as he pressed his chest tight to the wooden surface. His eyes were closed and beads of perspiration rolled over his lids and between his lashes. His bare torso was criss-crossed with abrasions from the pointed edges he so stubbornly clung to.
Claire was last. She sat down on a jerry-rigged bench beside the hammock, greeting him with a motherly nod.
“Fat cells don’t store heat or kinetic energy,” Harry added. “They store glucose, potential chemical energy that’s transformed later. And capacitors don’t store current, they store voltage, which is the electrical potential. We need to find magical potential energy.”
Hermione, pragmatic as ever, called out in precise and structured  directions:  “...Take 4 long strides forward, then 2 directly left, and then 4 more back the direction you came. There it is. Okay, untie the third item on the left. No, no, not that one, one over. Okay, Draco, pause for a moment, I need to think...”
Claire listened with intent neutrality. “I believed that keeping the alliance together was the best for everyone's game. As we had the majority, I felt introducing more instability would only decrease all of our odds, so I focussed my energy on maintaining what we already had.”
“I brought housewarming gifts!” she says with an emphatic gesture towards her wagon. Inside, a dozen or so seedlings and leafy herbs have been arranged into hand-painted terra-cotta pots.
“I’m scrawny and feeble. My stomach’s caving in. I can’t grow facial hair, just a weird translucent goatee.
He was paired with Marissa, a girl so bland Draco knew nothing about her besides her name (which he hadn’t even memorized until day 6). She was assumed to be a slow digger, so they had given her the spot with the driest sand. They had tried to equalize the time all three pairs would take to collect parts, so they had paired the best digger with the toughest terrain and the second-fastest runner, and the second-best digger with the slowest runner, and etcetera. Draco really hoped it would work.
Draco’s nose was buried in the warm shoulder of Harry Potter. Their bodies were pressed together, Harry on his back and Draco snuggled against him, shoulder-length curls tickling his brow. He sprang away, eyes darting frantically to see if anyone else was up.
With everyone distracted, Kristen steps closer to the display of paintings, reaching out with one finger, she pokes one, jumping back in surprise. Laughs from the audience echo around the studio.
“This might sting,” he said. A wound like this could have someone laid up in a hospital for days getting dressings and salves replaced. He could not bear to let that happen to Iz. Need be, he would obliviate her.
“I’m not upset, just humiliated,” Draco muttered. “What if people had seen! My mind is meant to be on the
“Yes. She is the other strategic player. I don’t want her to get votes for gameplay that would go to me over Harry. She played fast and hard, but that’s what a lot of people like to see. Plus, she’s different; she’s a young woman who isn’t afraid to show emotion or be genuine, despite the fact that she flipped alliances more times than the Steelers have won the Super Bowl--” (this was an Americanism that Draco was proud to have remembered from his dozens of hours sat in front of the telly trying to learn how to act like he designed airplanes in Tacoma.)-- “I think you should consider voting for her as well. Jessie came from your alliance, and a lot of people, CJ and Tara included, might stick to that. If you want their vote, it’s twice as hard with her sitting next to you.”
“What’s the matter, guys?” Harry asked went they arrived. They were all chilling on sofas and some of them were at the tables.
The next day was only preparation. Hermione, Ginny and Pansy literally kidnapped Harry about an hour before the official start of their party.
Draco raised his head feeling panic, fear and intense pain coming from Harry. Unfortunately he couldn’t see anything at all, Harry was too far away for him to see. He started slowly up towards Harry's location, followed by Blaise and Theo who asked him what was going on.
“Come on, hurry up” Harry said as he walked toward the door. They entered and closed the door behind them.
“I'd like to talk to you later Harry, sweetheart” Harry was surprised at the tone used but withdrew from commenting and just nodded.
“Wait, did you say you were gay?” Harry suddenly wondered. He didn’t have time to answer as Draco opened the door grimacing.
Zephir was sitting at a table with Zach, Emerik and Ethan, doing his homework but Dimitri was sitting in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassing Zephir. The five boys were laughing at another table and the little one were playing on the floor with Ascella in a corner of the room. Alya, Blaise, Ron, Hermione and Theo were all chatting at a table and they looked up when Harry spoke.
“We'll get back to you later” Jasper finished, like a hirer. It made Blaise laugh and soon he was alone with Theo in the bathroom.
The latter came to seize the blonde’s hand and brought it to his mouth. He introduced two fingers into his mouth and licked them conscientiously. Draco thought he was going to come on the spot watching him do it. Finally, Draco retrieved his hand and pulled it down to introduce one of his fingers into Harry’s intimacy. The latter began to moan only after a few movements. Harry started waving his hips and moaning louder as Draco introduced a second and then a third finger. Harry screamed as Draco hit his prostate with his fingers.
He moved as if he were on autopilot, stepping nearer to the mourning family. He didn’t want to intrude, but at the same time he just needed to know who was lying lifelessly on the ground. When he was only a few steps away from them, Mrs. Weasley looked up and stormed over to him, pulling him into a hug. He returned it hesitantly and as he looked over her shoulder, he could finally see which of the Weasley children hadn’t made it. It was one of the twins. Fred.
Before Draco could make up his mind and tell the elf that he should leave him here, he felt a small hand touching his shoulder again.
A hand touched his shoulder, grounding him. He looked over and it was Blaise. He motioned for him to look forwards and reluctantly, he did.
It took Draco a lot of strength and determination to open his eyes, and when he finally did, he found that he was staring at a ceiling. It was high above him and made of stone. It also seemed vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t place it. Where had he seen it before?
A hand touched his shoulder then and he jumped, ripping his eyes open and suddenly possessing the strength to lift his upper body from the ground. He couldn’t see his attacker clearly and nearly collided with them on his way up.
He turned so he could see better and looked at the chaos in front of him. There were even more injured people as before and the Weasley’s were still huddled around one of the cots.
Draco swallowed. He wasn’t inclined to tell them what happened at the moment. He just shook his head. “I’ll tell you but not right now.”, he paused for a moment, but then another thought came to him. “Do you have any idea where I can get a spare wand?”
Bellatrix’ wand flew through the air and Harry just so managed to catch it. At the same moment he arrived next to Ron and Harry noticed that Dobby was already there too. He hadn’t seen him before as Ron had shielded him too.
He ripped his gaze off the wand and looked around. They had landed on the wet sand near a beach, a house in the distance. Harry could see Ron and Hermione to his left, also sitting on the ground. Hermione was gripping onto Ron, her head buried in his shoulder. When Harry looked to the right, he could see Dobby. The house elf was standing in the sand and looked into the distance, a melancholy look on his face. But he seemed alright, at least as far as Harry could tell without his glasses.
The thought hit him like a train at full speed and he tried to lift his head to look around. After failing to do that, he stayed where he was, turning his head to the side. He was at Hogwarts. Of course. Dobby had told him that he would bring him here, but he hadn’t really believed it. Not until now.
They crept down the hallway, anxiously looking around the whole time and Harry almost expected to run into someone on the way. Where did everyone go? Hopefully not into the room where they kept Hermione, they wouldn’t have a chance without their wands.
Draco’s thoughts came to a sudden halt and he stared into Harry’s impossibly green eyes. Harry began to move forwards, as if he wanted to kiss him, but Draco stopped him, yanking his hand out of his grasp in the process.
They didn’t deserve this, no one did. Involuntarily, his thought supplied him with a different picture. Malfoy. What happened after they had left? Dobby said that it was Malfoy who threw the dagger off its course. Did they find out it was him? And what did they do to him? A wave of guilt washed over him and Harry felt like he should have insisted on taking him with them. He had refused, yes. And they had been enemies once, always at each others throats during their school days. But now?
“It’s not him.“, he said, voice as emotionless as ever. He stood up, not looking at him again, and went over to his mother. Draco watched while they led Harry and Weasley away, but Bellatrix kept Hermione upstairs. What was she planning to do?
When Draco opened his eyes, the bright rays of sunlight that got inside trough the dirty windows burned his eyes and that was all it took for him to get catapulted back into reality once again. He could feel every little ache in his body. His throbbing forearm, the cuts littered all over his arms and upper body, the tremors still cursing through his body from time to time.
After a while, he didn’t know how long, Draco opened his eyes again and looked down at his left arm. The sleeve was torn open up to the elbow and the bloody remnants of skin seemed to glare back at him. The whole arm was covered in blood at this point and Draco wished that she had cut a bit deeper. Deep enough for it to just bleed out and leave him in peace. But she didn’t.
Bellatrix had been very precise in her work with the dagger. The dagger that was meant for Harry, or for Dobby perhaps. Not for him, but that was his punishment.
And then, with his thoughts whirling and still wrapped up in a warm hug full of mourning, he came to a realisation. Malfoy and him had stopped being enemies a long time ago, he just didn’t realise it.
He was also acutely aware of his surroundings again. The hard floor he was lying on, the silence all around him, the rays of sun that seemed too bright and not bright enough at the same time. He could smell the blood. Its metallic stench.
His gaze got caught on the Weasley’s again and this time he could see what they were doing. One of the twins was lying on the ground, he couldn’t tell which one. And he was dead. That explained all the tears that the Weasley’s were shedding.
Well, that was actually the problem, he did not have a plan. Before he could think about an answer, another scream echoed through the room and Weasley ripped himself out of Harry’s grip. He grabbed Draco and slammed him up against the wall. “What are they doing to her?“
“Harry Potter does not have to worry about Dobby. Mr. Malfoy stopped the dagger from reaching Dobby.“
Draco stayed silent and countless thoughts were racing through his head. This had to be a dream. Draco was sure it was a dream. Why would Harry Potter offer to forgive him, to start again? It didn’t make any sense. He blinked a few times and looked back to Harry. He seemed genuine and nervous.
"I couldn't have said all of that and expect them to believe me. After everything Skeeter wrote about me, I doubt they'd take my word for it."
It was very serious magic and one couldn't spread it too thinly. Theoretically, the possibilities were limitless, no matter the number of people and distance. But realistically, very few people ever had a strong enough magical core and personal intent to empower and maintain any more than a handful of loved ones.
"Are you reneging your marriage to Father?' he asked quietly. Narcissa nodded. Draco took a deep breath, taking a while before letting it out again.
"I can understand that sentiment," Hermione said. "Look at me and Ron, when we had Hugo it also changed our dynamic, and we did have to grow up and be more mature about our life together. I guess though, that we were more prepared for the whole family thing that you and Ginny were."
"Albus Severus," he whispered back reverently, moving closer to be able to hold them all in his arms.
"Well, he did react quite negatively to the DNA test, he's gone and locked himself up in one of his enormous rooms somewhere."
"They're afraid of us," Potter replied stonily. "They probably want to make sure that none of us has any inclination to take over or stage a coup. It's like we're being identified, tagged and filed."
"It was alright," she said brightly, "I was able to play Chaser in three mock games, and they usually only rotate you once."
"I was just... lots of thinking going on under this rat's nest." Harry indicated his own head with a wry smile that was immediately returned by Malfoy.
"Two children, Harry. We have two beautiful children, and it's so unexpected and beyond our scope, and I'm scared and terrified because we're fucking

Did Harry want such a big affair? He had never thought it a possibility that he would become a father so soon, so it wasn't like he had much time to think about how he wanted to handle it. Yes, he wanted privacy. But he had also imagined his small, intimate family spending most days together, snuggled up in front of the fire and roasting marshmallows or drinking hot chocolate or what-have-you. Somehow, he never pictured spending his days with his son, working from home, and exchanging stories with his pseudo-wife over the Floo. He had privacy in mind, but not in the lonely way that his life had panned out to be so far.
Harry sighed into his pillow. This was the first time in years that he had felt truly vulnerable, and it scared him, but there was obviously just something left of the old rivalry between him and Malfoy that left him feeling odd. He turned over in bed, feeling restless. The best thing to do was just to treat Malfoy as normally as possible, as if nothing strange had happened.
"How can you fault us for that, Gin?" he asked, voice still low, standing up again and walking away from her. "It was all a twist of fate, it was all just by chance that Ron and I had gone out with Malfoy, that we had asked him to come over, that Teddy came to stay, that Malfoy met James and that Hermione joined us, and that everyone was having a good time. None of that was expected, but it was expected that you wouldn't be here. Honestly, Ginny, what else do you want me to say? Because I honestly don't want to hurt you by repeating all the old shit that we've alerady talked about before but can't seem to actually figure out. So tell me."
"Yeah, so think of two families brokering an alliance between their children. It all comes down to the contract, if the families do decide to wed. They have stipulations and everything on the contract, to ensure a good relationship between the two parties."
Despite the Auror Corps' silence about how the case was cracked, Draco was surprised that he had been treated as a celebrated figure within the walls of Potter and Weasley's workplace for at least a month. His unprecedented Potions expertise had successfully led the MMI to the mysterious Persephone's Poison, which, as Draco had unerringly suggested, was the brainchild of Swedish brothers Edvard and Gøran Eilert. The potion, which had been created by their great-great-grandfather, was a potent means of spiriting away unwilling persons from their own homes. Its effects were similar to the combined symptoms of the Imperius and Amortentia, which rendered the victim highly suggestible and vulnerable to the one who administered the potion, this being highly dangerous as it kept the victim with complete confidence that they were only acting out of their own will, and not the suggestions of the poisoner. After only one dose, it left no room for doubt - the victim would always think and act according to the desires of the poisoner, and they would believe that they were doing it of their own free will.
"I mean, of course we had an arrangement for her strict training schedule, but we hadn't exactly expected to have a child at this point, not when we both knew that she had to away for so long each time."
Malfoy stared him down (or so it seemed to Harry), but then seemed to make a silent decision. In less than a minute, his haughty proud face melted into an expression of sadness and worry. "I needed-" he took a deep breath -"I thought I could use a - I thought I'd talk with you - for a bit -"
Teddy appeared to think it over in his head, then nodded enthusiastically. Harry did notice that his godson always loved involving himself in everything concerning James. With a pang, he knew it was because he considered Jamie to be his little brother, and Harry had no problem with that.
Narcissa interrupted him smoothly. "There are old wards from the ancient Malfoy line that offer stronger protections. In fact, we might also be able to look into activating some of the blood wards."
He was mistaken, however. "Apparently, my gratitude should be given instead," she said, voice low and smooth like dark chocolate. "You seem to have a copy of the book that I've been meaning to look for."
Naturally, no one else but those nearest Harry and Kingsley could hear the exchange, so majority of the people present still had looks of confusion stamped on their faces.
Harry thought about that. It was true. He and Malfoy had had almost the same circumstances thrown to them by a cruel twist of fate. They had both been instrumental pawns in the war, and they had the same losses and sacrifices. They had suffered different situations, but in essence they had lived almost the same life. Like two sides of the same coin.
Ginny tried to look at him beseechingly. "They think being away for close to six months is enough time..." her words trailed off as if she were afraid of how the rest of the sentence would affect Harry. Instead, she bit her lip nervously.
"A special case, you say?" Astoria couldn't hide her surprise upon hearing that Draco had been requested by Potter to help him. She turned away from her reflection in the dresser to look at her husband. His face was serious, somber, and she knew that he was telling her the truth.
"Of course not," Draco answered. "The child's name will be given on the day of birth, as my mother sees fit."
When Narcissa had finished chanting the first half of the spell, Draco felt the stirrings of magic around them converge on his newborn son. He couldn't stop staring with longing, but he knew that he couldn't hold him until after the Naming.
"To use it against me?" Harry asked, slightly defensive. James was beginning to stir in his arms, probably bothered by all the noise their voices were making.
Ron seemed to react to this intimate admission, and he grimaced. "Mate," he began, though he appeared to be having trouble getting his words out. "I'm... I'm really sorry it all came down to this..."
Ron cocked his head. "Pureblood traditions aside, I didn't think you would ever go that route. You just don't come across as the kind of parent to even let go of your son for five minutes," he said with a smirk. "I know you're more of a hands-on dad and all. Even I'm not that kind of a dad, though I do like spending time with my kids."
'Yes," the witch nodded enthusiastically. "There should be parallels between the Malfoy and the Tonks lines, and it is there that maybe we can see what might be wrong, or missing."
"Chasing for the Harpies. Going to the World Cup. Winning," she replied sadly, guiltily. "I know we used to talk about this before, Harry, even when we were back at Hogwarts. Before our engagement-"
"But still," Harry said, trying to find words to explain what he thought. "Doesn't it feel... strange? I mean, to be married to someone that you hadn't been close to or- I dunno, it sounds weird that you have to spend the rest of your life together, and you still have to learn to like each other on the way?"
"You have a club?" Astoria asked with amusement. "Oh darling," she jokingly admonished Draco, "you should have told me you were expecting your friends to be here! They weren't even on our list!"
"You have perfectly fine assets, Harry," Ginny replied, winking at him. "With or without them, you're already family anyway, we're just doing this to give Mum her chance to cry at my wedding."
Hermione took hold of Harry's free hand and gave it a squeeze. "We're here for you, Harry. Regardless of whether we agree or disagree on anything, we're always going to be here to support you, especially when you need it the most."
, as well as a nappy change in Harry's case, the rest of the marathon had to be postponed just so they could catch some sleep.
Harry closed his eyes and shook his head in a valiant effort to clear it. "Draco and Astoria didn't have a rush wedding," he said thoughtfully. "A case of forced or blackmailed marriage is usually indicated by a lack of any decent prep time - the perpetrator is likely to arrange a quick bonding so their victim can't get away. Magical bindings are pretty much Unbreakable."
The thought brought back his nerves, and he kept pacing, probably running the floor thin with each step, but he couldn't care less.
Ron perused the letter, crossing out the corresponding ingredients on the list he had. "Clever prat," he muttered, his tone full of admiration. Harry knew that even Ron admitted how much Malfoy was helping this particular case. In fact, he had only been working on the formula for only three weeks, and so much information had already been narrowed down despite the large margin for speculation. After weeks of feeling stagnant, Harry was beginning to an end to their previously lost cause. And Malfoy had a lot to do with it, which meant he owed the blonde. A lot.
"Scorp?!" Malfoy cried out in horror. "You've met my son once and you've already given him a horrible nickname!"
An owl fluttered into Harry's open window, and he recognized it as one of the Weasleys'. It was pretty late, but he got up anyways in case it was an emergency. Handing out a couple of owl treats, he took the piece of parchment and read it in the firelight. Suddenly, he gave a loud whoop and pumped his fist in the air, startling the owl. He apologized to the bird, then hastily scribbled out a reply, attaching it to the owl's leg and sending him off into the night.
being invoked by someone who believed he had the Elder Wand (Draco shivered) and how the invocation didn't bind with his magic and he got killed anyway. There was also that story of a man whose wives kept being targeted by his enemies, so he called upon
He absent-mindedly played with the tufts of hair on James' head. It was a rich chocolate brown, not as jet black as Harry's, and not as reddish as his mother's. With a pang, his thoughts went straight to his current source of numbness.
"Mr. Malfoy," Kingsley said, this time with a softer tone, "Mr. Potter spent that meeting telling me everything he knew about you, and your family. Oh, he still hates your Father, naturally, but he was insistent on sharing information about both you and Narcissa, in an effort to convince me of the true extent of your involvement in the war. He therefore provided Pensieve memories-" Draco blanched "-that indeed showed a much different perspective."
Hermione was silent, absorbing this new tidbit about the culture that she had thought she already knew. After another comfortable silence, she finally decided to return Hugo to his crib. Then, she led Malfoy back into the kitchen, where their tea had gone cold. She quickly Charmed the kettle to heat more water.
"Oh don't kid me, Harry!" Hermione cried exasperatedly, very obviously close to her berserk mode. He'd better watch it. "People always seem to have something to say about what I'm doing wrong, and what I can't seem to do to make it right. As if they'd know!" she added scathingly. "I've got Molly on my back telling me that I should focus on being a mom, and I've got Ginny setting up some impossible standard for working mothers. And Ron just won't quit hounding me about my job, either. As if I didn't get enough shite from the old coots on the Council! And now I've got you against me, too!"
Harry couldn't help but groan again, and throw his arms upwards in defeat. "This, Harry," he told himself,
The fact that Potter and the Weaselette were an item was news for several months. It never seemed to get old, and people were thirsty for any kind of news about their reclusive hero. Draco unfolded today's edition of the Prophet, and he already expected at least one feature about the Chosen Couple. It was inevitable after the limited ward release.
Potter theatrically rolled his eyes. "I just didn't think you'd appreciate having a great big stag barge into your private residence crying out the woes of Harry Potter..."
"You fucking bastard!" he cried out, wrestling with the magical bonds on his arms and legs but failing. "If I've proven you've dosed me with that fucking potion, I will wring your neck myself!"
Draco knew that she was asking out of curiosity. From what Potter had told him, she had had a very dangerous and difficult first pregnancy, and her second, only a month ago, had been successful only because she had been given strict orders to stay home and remain stress-free. At least his wife was able to be as active a social butterfly as she always was, perhaps even more. It reminded him that he had chosen her well.
He wasn't too surprised, of course. All pureblood children (or at least those from their circle) had been raised to expect such negotiations. However, he had been hoping for a much better pairing than with someone like Daphne. He cringed when he realized he would even rather marry Pansy, who was like a sister to him, than the girl in front of him. Sure, she was quite beautiful, but Draco didn't feel a single spark of interest, which made him dread what was surely coming next.
"I hate this," the Auror whispered, which to Draco sounded as if he were admitting defeat. "I hate just...just sitting here, not knowing whatever's going on... I hate being useless, unable to even do anything..."
The brunet nodded, and there was no sign of having been offended by the conversation not more than a minute ago. "I meant it, you know," he seemed to insist. "I wanted to thank you for... for just being here. I guess I never knew how much I'd been relying on Ron and Hermione in times of, er, crises, until I had to make do with you - wait, that came out wrong," he added hastily, laughing.
Upon his arrival, he coincidentally witnessed a disheveled Potter racing after Weasley and Flooing out in a hurry. He watched with amusement until they vanished, then proceeded on his way to the Minister's office.
been used in active duty. Malfoy had the security clearance, and he was becoming desperate. He thought it was for the best, even if it was still strictly experimental. He requested it specifically."
: Sorry, think of it like... well basically we gather information about criminals, their background, their motivations behind curses, basically looking into their head. So while the other departments in the Auror Corps focus on material such as evidence, witnesses, spell damage... the MMI looks into the how and why, so we can figure out much more about the criminal, and the case as well.
"Can you..." Since when did Draco ever run out of words to say?! "Can you tell me about... about my childhood?"
"Why do you seem shocked, Potter?" Malfoy asked, genuinely concerned. Harry looked at him with disbelief.
Draco felt something in him snap. "I am not a young boy any more, Mother. I am allowed to grow and change, and I am most definitely not supposed to be under your scrutiny, which, if I may be bold as to say, is completely out of hand."
They had expected to wallow the rest of their lives in a derelict cell and treated like scum. This was no prison to them anymore. It was like an extended private holiday, which he and his mother would spend doing whatever it was they loved. They would get through this.
As promised, Hermione's friend had come through and promptly sent out the results of the so-called DNA test. Draco couldn't think of a more nerve-wracking day, as he was feeling both highly relieved and severely anxious at the same time.
Draco shook his head. "Yes, I know you've been popping out your offspring, and living to tell the tale," he said, making sure his tone was light enough so as not to offend his friend. He liked to think they were past that, anyway. "It's not a walk in the park, I know. I've don't my share of reading, Pansy."
"She's right," Harry agreed. "When Ginny and I talked, she told me that she realized only very recently that she might not have the right kind of mindset to really be like Molly. I reminded her that I wasn't expecting her to be all domestic and trapped at home to do all the housework, you know? And she said she knew that, but that even with a career and everything, she would still feel grounded."
He cleared his throat imperiously. "Might I remind you that I am only here on behalf of one Granger/Weasley, seeing as
is supposedly the most powerful privacy ward there is, and its strength shouldn't be limited by either distance, or how thinly it's spread among individuals. The only reason I can think of such an ancient more of magic failing is if the magic itself has gone wrong."
Malfoy nodded, understanding their silent question. "It's not exactly general information. After all, I'm more of an invisible investor here, and I leave the actual management and operations to others."
"Apart from your darling husband making a fool of himself, Granger, the night was pretty much uneventful."
"I guess criminals must go on holiday sometime," she mused. "At least you're getting to spend your time the way you want it. Maybe you should consider starting a consultancy. Something with less work and flexible hours, instead of being a full time Auror."
“Eleanor and Joris are my children, and those of Theodo- I mean Nott” Ron had no reaction but stepped back and closed the door. Lyra, Ezekiel, Nathaniel and Erin came out of the room too, taking Blaise and Zachady with them. In the room, the atmosphere was slightly annoying and nobody dared to look at each other.
He then engaged a slow and gentle come and go that tortured Harry who began to moan louder and louder. Draco sped up and Harry literally screamed. He wrapped his tongue around the tense penis in his mouth and hollowed his cheeks to give even more pleasure to Harry. The latter arched violently one last time before coming with a cry in Draco’s mouth.
“Go see him and talk” Harry offered, staring at Draco, frowning. Ron spun around to find himself on his back across the bed.
“He's just drunk” Alarik added. Hermione pursed her lips and prepared to say that Harry was not drinking but Draco cut her off.
“I'm not adorable, Potter” Harry giggled, the blond was not threatening at the moment. Between his tousled hair, his eyes gleaming with fatigue, his smile that he was trying to conceal, and the sense of joy that Harry could feel from their touching bellys.
Harry opened the bedroom door gently. He was wrapped in the blanket of the bed to cover his nakedness and he tried to reach the bathroom as discreetly as possible. Draco was with him and they spent their time walking on their feet.
So they waited in the room for what felt like hours. Dimitri seemed to be comforting Zephir in a corner, his hand against Zephir’s neck, his thumb brushing his cheek. Harry wondered for a moment if the two of them finally were together but when Zephir shook his head and walked away it seemed pretty clear that it wasn’t the case. Emerik was sitting near Lena, watching her closely with his wand in hand. Zach was standing a few feet behind him, against a wall and he was looking at
“He knows” Nathaniel whispered as Draco crossed the children's room just as quickly. The others sighed, shaking their heads, pretending to ignore the tears they had seen on their father's cheeks.
They arrived with difficulty to the door of the room where Harry was sleeping. Harry lifted Draco and opened the door. He then kicked it close and stopped dead on seeing the room. He rested a growling Draco on the ground and they watched the transformed room. There was only one bed and it was much bigger than the original one. A subdued light reigned in the room and a soft heat seemed to emerge from the walls.
“Because it's out of the question! I refuse to settle at this lion-filled table.” It was Harry's turn to roll his eyes excessively.
For how fast it is over, the impact cuts deep. Draco finishes with a final thrust and a cry. The corset has slid down his ribs, and a pale indentation is left behind on his chest, rising and expanding with each laboured breath.
Better, even, is the expression on Draco’s face. His lashes are dark, fluttering as he blinks, but his lips are slightly parted. He looks entirely in the moment, captivated by his own focus in a way that is so unbearably sexy, so
Draco yelped, and Harry whispered a soft “Come here” in his ear as they landed in lush moss. Draco opened his eyes slowly, barely aware that he had squeezed them shut, to a view of a magnificent waterfall. Mist hung in the air, and, even in the grey overcast light, rainbows danced between the trees. Vines twisted up the rocky shale that guided the clear, cascading stream, and the atmosphere was filled with a pleasant splashing and gurgling.
The cameras stay on Harry’s face, set in a smirk and eyes wide, and the audience laughs in confusion.
They went to the site of the Rai stone, but they didn’t make much progress. Neither party was particularly invested in the task. The stone wasn’t reacting to magic, but Draco had deduced a spell that allowed him to inspect its core signature.
other’s weakness, but the exception often proves the rule, and this was evident in the dedicated way people tried to ignore him.
He scaled the staircase on shaky legs, breathing hard already despite the adrenaline. He pushed on, fully in fight or flight.
Draco sidled up beside Jones, hoping to speak with him but careful to not ask outright. When Jones got paranoid and erratic, he also got controlling.
As Draco ate, he would look up occasionally to find Harry staring in rapt adoration, and burst into gleeful laughter. Harry had always had a thing for watching him work. As they prepared to leave, he slid a napkin into Draco’s lap, the words ‘
He funneled water into his pail, already racing towards the stairs when Jeff called him to a halt. Draco’s flag had raised.
The red lights of a dozen cameras blink off, the film crew adjusting settings as cue cards are shuffled and stagehands rush from wing to wing. The dark haired man-- the host-- stands still and a little stunned in front of the whooping crowd, fingers fidgeting absently at the hem of his pockets.
And then Harry smiles, and that seems to be enough, because Malfoy pauses, and pauses some more, and says “Okay.”
Draco shrugs, but it turns into a shimmy as he snuggles closer. “I did it a little bit for you,” he admits.
I will be by your side in this. You can count on me. I wouldn’t pass up a chance to look into your emerald eyes.
Draco’s Apparition is smooth and tidy, but even the symmetrical acceleration forces Harry’s eyes closed, the pleasant buzz of alcohol in his blood turning queasy. He stumbles on the landing, jerking Draco’s arm forward awkwardly. Draco jostles into his side, and Harry’s reflexes respond just a moment too late. The ground approaches, slow and spinning, and it’s not until he’s flat on his back with Draco pinned on top of him that Harry no longer feels like he’s watching in a dream from above.
“I mean technically,” Harry replied, “our work is done. I don’t need to be here. I wouldn’t mind checking out Ponderosa.”
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy says. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be that. I’m sorry I’m not strong enough to not care.”
He offers her a sheepish grimace. “Sorry, I’ve been up all night doing research-- I think I’ve lost my filter and my sanity.” Standing a little taller, he adds, “I’m building a garden for my boyfriend. He’s moving in.”
A notebook slaps against the hardwood as it is dropped to the side, and Draco feels strong arms flip him onto his back. He stretches his arms above his head. “Planning to show me how much?”
“Do you feel anything dark in the air?” he asked as they neared the stone. Harry tended to be acutely aware of magic. If the wizarding 6th sense was like smell, Harry would be a bloodhound.
“I want to work with you,” Draco started. “We have a solid group of young players on this tribe, and I think it would be in our favour to join up. We all are fans of the game, and we almost grew up watching it, so we probably have similar styles and ideas. I think it’s clear to everyone that Doug and Tara just don’t have the same game philosophy.
“I’ve never heard of anything being able to hold magic inside of itself,” Draco said. “Wizards have a magical signature, but that’s more like handwriting left behind on energy flows. Wands channel magic, but they don’t produce it. Even Stonehenge isn’t magical in and of itself. The rocks have charms placed on them that pull magic to the surface. Since magic works like electrons or magnets, it’s circular shape keeps tons of concentrated energy inside of it; a capacitor, if you will, but if you took it apart and dropped a piece of it somewhere with no Ley Line and no circle, it would just be a rock with a useless charm on it.”
“Well,” she continued, releasing them from a tense silence. She had mastered the deft, quiet diplomacy of a politician’s wife. “I suppose I should ask who you are voting for.”
Along the fence, Harry has planted hostas and camellias and one tall, prized mock orange. Wisteria climbs the gnarled limbs of a lilac, and it’s an explosion of periwinkle and violet. Cornflowers and rose campion bloom untamed, popping up beneath the dwarf cedar and in the edges of pathways.
Draco took a deep, soothing lungful of air and reached into his pocket. Someone gasped behind him. “I’ve got one, Jeff,” he declared. He kept his voice as steady as he could muster, his gait as graceful as he was capable of. “I would like to play it for Isabelle.”
“Puh-lease.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Jones is due to start turning on his own alliance. He doesn’t give a shit about the weaklings on the bottom. Come on, I hear BLTs and a shower calling my name.”
“I hope so,” Draco sighed, putting Ichabod back into his terrarium. “I’ve quite enjoyed looking after him. I thought we were doing a good job.”
Lithodora blankets the earth at the base of the island, deep green foliage offset by the glowing royal blues of the flowers. The colour of those blossoms-- Draco thinks it might be his favourite colour in the world.
He’s wired and fidgety, caught in a cycle of fight or flight that gives the world an odd reflectiveness. For the first time in his life, no one tries to speak to him. There must be something wild in his eyes.
The challenge was a maze. One partner was the caller while the other was blindfolded and spun around a stick. Jeff said it was a true test of communication, and Draco sent Harry and Pansy a prayer or two. They would need it.
Harry smirks. His eyes say he’s having a little too much fun, and it’s pissing Draco off. “No… the nursery is Muggle, and we can’t just carry everything while we apparate.”
fault, but instead he turned his eyes up to Harry’s and said, “I guess I just thought I’d be better at this. Nobody seems to like me and the challenge yesterday was so awful, but everyone seems to want to be your best friend. I just wanted to be the hero for once.”
Draco pauses, a frown catching his lips. He wonders when he started to identify himself in that category. Beneath him, Harry flashes a knowing smirk.
The novelty of perfecting my letters has worn off, so I suppose now is a good time to tell you that I can’t watch ants. Don’t be surprised if my script only gets more chaotic from here; proofreading and I do not get along. My aunt and uncle tried to send me off to ‘St. Brutus’s Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys’ because I never sat still in class or in my cupboard, and while that may have been a pretty severe reaction, they weren’t wrong about the fidgeting.
It came down to a drawing of straws; two short and one long. Jones picked first, fingers twitching as he deliberated. It took half a minute, but when he did choose, his hand shot out, precise and dangerous with the neuroticism of prey and severity of a hunter.
Harry sat beside him in the waning golden hour before late afternoon. A rogue tear streaked his face. “They’re going to vote out Lonnie.”
“It’s a floodplain. Gets covered up in the rainy season, dry in the summer. Could winter mean death and spring mean life or something?” Isabelle said.
Fred Armisen clears his throat. “Wow, aren’t these cool! I heard the artist was nominated for an award!” He points to a series of neon splatter paintings hung on a brick wall. Kristen, Fred, Jason, and Harry lean in for a closer look.
Draco had felt it too-- a busy, violent hiss of magic zipping past his ears, an insolent tug on his magical core as it combusted on contact with the energy in the air like a million tiny explosions. It was a situation where being more powerful meant being more vulnerable, and Harry was just that.
She shook her head and blinked rapidly, and the petrified shock dissipated from her face. “I- I think so?” she said.
They re-voted, this time for only Jones or Harry, and Jones was offed unanimously in the most wild, most unpredictable Tribal Council yet. As his torch was snuffed, Draco gave him a wave and a nasty grin. For once, there was nothing Jones could do in response
We can also work with a potion that balances your hormonal situation. I can imagine that the idea of taking a potion might frighten you. However, it makes a difference whether you self-medicate with addictive potions or work with a specialist to analyze your hormonal situation and prescribe against a hormonal deficit. In addition, I have developed a potion dispenser that is charmed to not let more than the daily dose out in one day, and is virtually indestructible.
Draco scratched his head, tugging at his hair in excitement. “Right, but magic is more like a magnetic field. It doesn’t really
“There are two ways we can do this,” Draco said. “First, we could let it go to firemaking and really, truly cheat for the first time since we got here. Second, we could make an honest attempt at convincing Claire to get out Jessie.”
Deciding it wasn’t worth the risk so early in the game, Harry and Draco opted not to sneak out of camp until at least after the first Tribal Council. Unfortunately for Draco, he was finding it increasingly difficult to pretend he didn’t want Harry’s attention. The prat was popular and gorgeous, and he always had a pack of surfer bros and pretty women trailing after him. One girl in particular never left Harry alone. Her name was Lindsay, and Draco hated her nearly as much as Tara. She had long bimbo-y hair and big bimbo-y breasts, and she was always giggling at whatever Harry said. Harry seemed to find it amusing, but Draco did not at all.
“Oh my… have you lost your mind? You, who hated every single Care of Magical Creatures lesson we ever had at school, actually
Ian agreed enthusiastically, adding that he always felt like Doug was being insincere and that his paternal nature was patronizing and disrespectful. It was a good sign that the others were saying more than ‘yeah, man, I feel you.’ He didn’t trust any of them to be this good at acting.
I will not pretend that I am coming to you in cold rationality; this, to me, is deeply personal. However, I urge you not to see it that way. My body and my soul are a magical anomaly. In short, I am a puzzle that I believe you could find considerable fulfillment in solving.
“Yes, we’d better,” Harry said, turning to look at Draco again. “Or we’ll be in trouble with Minerva again.”
She smiles. “Ah. Well, we certainly do that sort of magical landscaping. I’m happy to schedule you an appointment for a quote.” She rummages through a file cabinet behind the front desk, and comes up with a battered day planner. “What’s your timeframe?”
“Don’t worry, we can bring his terrarium over later,” Harry said. “Hagrid, there was glamour over his terrarium, are you sure you don’t know who you bought him from?”
To customize the prescription, I will need your medical history. What exactly did you take back then? Was it Calming Draught? Putrich’s Potion? Something different? We will avoid medications that have the same properties as the potion you took.
“In that case, are you good to Apparate?” Malfoy is smirking, but it’s a façade. Harry can’t tell if he's fighting giggles or nerves or both.
“If you say so,” Harry said as Draco jumped to pluck a plump green fruit from the tree. He took a bite straight from the side, coughing and spitting it out before swallowing thickly. Harry gave him an I-told-you-so eye roll.
I am also exhausted. My magic has consumed me, burning everything around it with volatile ferocity. As you probably know as you have far more academic knowledge  than I do, the First Law of Thermodynamics can have dire consequences.
only the dim bedroom, filled with Harry’s discarded clothes and trinkets and Draco’s bookshelves. Everything was in the right place. He cast a disgruntled
Harry’s face moves to smile on impulse, but the corners of his lips fight it. He lets them win. Standing, he follows Hagrid two steps behind to the cabin near the forest.
“Hagrid, as much as we loved your gift to us, we need to give Ichabod back to you,” Draco said, holding out the small travelling tank to Hagrid. “He’s… we don’t think he’s happy with us.”
Ichabod continued to gaze at them, not attempting to move from where he was sitting on Hagrid’s hand.
The morning was eerily quiet throughout breakfast and into the afternoon. It was not mentioned again until Harry and Draco had Apparated away.
“How’d you get them to let you off without prison?” Harry asks. He assumes the rebuilding effort is a parole-- he can’t imagine why anyone else would come by choice.
“You too?” Malfoy says. He sits on a bench beside the Black Lake, a mug of tepid tea clutched in his lap. It is dinner time again.
Draco laughs nervously; he has a notoriously brown thumb. “That’s actually sort of what I wanted to talk to you about.”
Harry limped to his side. “Draco, are you okay? Dammit, why’d you have to hurt yourself?” He massaged Draco’s arms and shins with gentle hands, still trembling from the Challenge.
Malfoy hums in understanding, glancing down at his hands. Harry notices that the cuticle around Malfoy’s thumb is bleeding. “I was angry. Knowing you don’t even remember-- I don’t know if that makes it worse.”
Draco admires silently from the mats as Harry projects, appreciating the way his brow knits in total focus, the way his bottom lip curls between his teeth when he reaches max exertion.
“Protego!” he shouted, and, as if the magic had a mind of its own, she spun, the base of her thigh scraping the rock and pushing her away. Draco caught her as she tumbled towards the sea, and they both landed with a splash.
Note: This fic contains multiple characters in law enforcement, some wizarding and some muggle. The reason I included these characters is because Survivor frequently features these professions. I understand, however, that law enforcement, especially in the United States, perpetuates and contributes to systematic oppression and racism, and that cannot be ignored, even in this context. Black Lives Matter, folks.
As they approached camp, Harry stopped him, letting his hand linger heavily on Draco’s arm and pressing his finger to his lips. Over the din of morning birds, they could hear a campmate running a confessional down the skinny trail that led to the production tent.
“We should try to pull Marissa and Tara back in--” Draco cut her off with a childish whine “-- I know, Tara’s a piece of work, but I think Marissa will budge if we can convince her we have the numbers. She’s the type to prioritize self preservation, and she hasn’t ever been in camp with Jones; she won’t know that he’s a flipper. We were on good terms with her before the split, I think we may have a sway.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked warily, eyeing the toad who seemed to be staring at him. “Don’t we need all the fancy equipment?”
“One Eyed Witch!” he says with a wink, and Harry already regrets showing him the Marauder’s Map of hidden passageways.
Harry has done wonders with the place, spending every night from dinner until long past sun-down watering and tending with loving care. A dwarf red maple has been planted in the center of the infinity waterfall, a dappled, fluttering shade blanketing the ground. Combined with the soft shimmering ripples of the current, the surface of the water looks like a portal to another dimension.
While the game was going-- and it went for an excruciatingly long time-- there was no way for one to tell if they were close, no way to know which numbers were wrong. The complete dissonance between each player and their standing in the challenge was disheartening and discombobulating.
He complies, pulling out to add more lube, but not before exploring once more with his tongue, moaning when it slides in smooth. Harry’s arse-cheeks are red from being pulled apart, his whole body shaking until Draco doesn’t know which sounds, which vibrations, are whose.
“Thank you, Draco,” she said. “You’ve been very candid. I appreciate the help.” Draco felt a little bad about manipulating her, but, well, he had known what he had gotten himself into, and it wasn’t like Claire was a gullible child. She was shrewd in her own right. It was her decision in the end, he rationalized. Nevertheless, a butterfly emerged from its cocoon in his stomach, reminding him that, by maintaining ulterior motives and playing under false pretences, he was actively affecting other people’s opportunities.
The nursery is a sea of possibilities-- thousands of trees and shrubs and hanging baskets, no two the same. A koi blows bubbles from a nearby tank of water lilies. Draco could get lost here. He wanders the uneven rows as he waits for Harry, looping through the same displays of rhododendrons and daphnes over and over again. He gets particularly attached to a lone variegated hellebore that must have been put back in the wrong place, and when Harry eventually finds him, he begs Harry to buy it.
She turned towards him on her side. “My dad’s muggleborn, grew up in St. Louis. It wasn’t a great time or place to be black or male or young, so he left for LA in the 70s. My mom comes from a long line of magical families in Mexico. She and her parents were the first to immigrate north, and they lost all their standing doing so. They worked hard to get where they are.
Ron paled, snatching the DVD and shoving it onto the high shelf of ‘grown-up movies’. He cleared his throat, clearly fed up with Harry’s chatter. “Oooh, is it too early to watch Polar Express?”
Draco’s calf spasmed violently, and he clamped his knees tighter together with a grimace. His feet, slick with drying sweat, slid slowly apart.
There’s a buzzing in his ears that is strange and soothing. The longer he sits the more it drowns out the pounding of blood in his veins. Picking up a handful of soil from beside his shoe, he smiles faintly as it cascades from his palm and down either side of a root; an hourglass, or perhaps a mall fountain. He doesn’t need to dig to know what’s buried underneath. Instead, he examines the dirt lodged behind his fingernails.
“Lastly, I want to say that this has been the experience of a lifetime, and, no matter what happens, I am so incredibly grateful to have had this opportunity and to share it with all of you. I will be reminiscing until, I am sure, the day I die.”
“Fuck,” Draco says. “Fuck. Gorgeous. So gorgeous. So eager.” Harry whines, hot and breathy. He wishes he could give more praise, but it’s hard to speak when his tongue is otherwise-occupied.
Their new buffs were purple, which Draco found a little bit silly. Blue and red made purple, not orange and green, but the tribe was far too relieved for semantics. Isabelle pulled her old buff off her torso so fast her bikini slipped.
They Apparated to the waterfall and lay together for far longer than intended, basking in the sound of cicadas and the tropical night breeze. They were both naked, but they remained a few inches apart, their respective hands tracing over the lines of each other's bodies.
It was night 1, and he was already going batshit crazy. By the time they had water boiling, the sun had gone down, and the whole tribe was hungry and irritable. A bland plate of rice did little to raise morale. It was in that moment, staring up at a film of dusky clouds and surrounded by subdued chatter, that Draco realized this whole ordeal was going to be much more difficult than anticipated.
Without hesitation Harry gripped onto Ron and Dobby and the elf disapparated with them. But just before they disappeared Harry looked back at Bellatrix again and he saw a dagger in the air, flying at them at an impressive speed. But he couldn’t do anything. The next moment everything warped around him and then his knees crashed into wet sand.
Before he could continue and embarrass himself even further, Draco stepped forward and took Harry’s hand in his again. Their eyes met and Draco gave him a small but genuine smile.
At the thought of them he dropped the wands onto the ground and fished for his glasses, still somewhere in the pockets of his jacket. He put them back on as soon as he managed to find them.
The voices around him where still muffled, fading in and out and Draco just lacked the energy to listen to the conversations around him. He was just so tired. He stayed on the soft and scratchy thing underneath his back, staring up at the ceiling. It reminded him of Hogwarts, in a way. Hogwarts is full of high ceilings and floating candles. Floating candles?
He let it fall into his hand and looked at it, thinking back to what Luna’s father had told them about the Deathly Hallows. He had no idea how Dumbledore could have gotten his hands on the stone of resurrection but it was undeniably lying in his palm. He turned the stone in his hand absentmindedly and looked up again, in the direction he heard the voices of the Deatheaters come from.
“I'm hungry dad” Lesath reminded them of his presence by addressing Malfoy. The latter just smiled at him before leaving for the living room, Harry on his heels. All the others then followed them into the living room where Jordan and his two sisters watched, a little frightened, their father fuming.
“I exposed my observations to Dumbledore, but he didn’t want to tell me more” They were frowning now, not seeing what she was meaning
“Well, then, me, Zach, Dimi and the five terrors control the amount of alcohol ingested by each parent” Ezekiel continued.
Finally, Draco pushed Harry slightly and they slowly started to cross the room, a bit clumsily, while kissing again. As Harry finally crashed into the wall right next to the door, Lyra groaned plaintively.
“Well, I must go, see ya” And with these words the girl left the room. Harry remained frozen, despite the fact that he closed the door. Draco finally woke up and saw the Gryffindor standing in front of the door.
The last picture represented them both on the same broom, both holding a snitch. This photo was taken from their trip to Malfoy Manor a few days earlier. Harry smiled as he thought of the same gold snitch in his pocket. Tears streamed from Harry's eyes and Draco worried immediately.
“We can do both, I'll be careful not to get too high, that's all” Harry replied, offering Draco a reassuring smile. The blonde scowled, seeming more marked by this event than Harry.
“He’s  not rejecting me!” Dimitri shouted again. They all laughed, knowing full well that he was right. The door opened at that moment on Sirius and Remus, followed by Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Pansy. Erika and Seth ran to Sirius and Remus, both shouting.
“Oh really?” Draco mumbled, still traumatized by the sight of a Harry bathing in his own blood and dying slowly. Harry suddenly saw a picture of him bathing in his blood. He made a good step back and nearly fell off the bench.
“No, you don’t understand. He's really great but I mean he's physically fantastic. He's really sexy” He sighed as he finished his sentence. Harry chuckled and smiled tenderly. Noticing him, Draco blushed violently. Harry turned off the lights with a gesture and he literally fell on the blonde.
“Yeah, because you’re a prefect” He whispered when Draco bent. Draco bites his lower lip when he saw the look of pure lust on the Gryffindor’s face. He cleared his throat and put on his underpants. He looked for his pants and found it besides the door of the Room of Requirement. He sighed, not happy to have to walk by all the room mostly naked, especially when Potter was looking at him like that, like he was the most beautiful thing in the world. He stared at Harry who looked quickly away, blushing like a little girl. Draco smirked and went to his pants and the rest of his clothes.
“No ... T-That’s ... Ha-Harry” He raised his head and tried to find his soul mate among the rubble and the dust. The library had literally burst into pieces, as well as the wall behind it. Hermione got up and took the controls.
Harry straightened the handle of his broomstick and flew to the sky, towards the snitch. He conjured up a bouncing magical barrier to prevent his friends from crashing to the ground, since from what he’d seen, they wouldn’t be able to recover in time.
“Are you all right Dray?” Draco turned to look at him and nodded. They then saw Pansy running towards them, followed at a distance by Theodore.
The next day, all the girls in the house couldn’t be found, and when Harry asked Molly where they were, she simply told him they had some errands to do.
“Oh sorry, Mione” The blond boy exclaimed, hugging Hermione tightly. They all stared at each other except the brunette boy who seemed to be used to this kind of scene. Hermione pulled back sharply, and stared at the two boys in surprise.
“Two” She picked a candy, watching the scene carefully. She handed the package to Harry, who politely refused. He laughed internally, thinking that if Erin arrived with popcorn at that moment, it wouldn’t even surprise him. He focused again on them when Ezekiel tightened his grip on the girl, making her moan with pain.
“Emett!” The person concerned turned quickly, furiously. He glared at the blond girl Harry had met earlier.
“I didn’t want to imagine that!” He was angry with himself. They all burst out laughing and it was this moment that the adults chose to go home.
“Professor Dumbledore, you know what these objects are and how to destroy them, don’t you?” Harry asked.
“Are you sure you didn’t want to say that you watched him passionately every minute that passes?” Ezekiel teased from his bed. Lyra then checked if Lesath and Emett were sleeping and she pulled out all the others to keep it like that. Dimitri groaned as the twins literally laughed at him.
Someone knocked on the door just as he was about to pour himself a generous amount of whatever alcohol was in the fancy bottle in his hand. Pansy always had amazing looking bottles of alcohol in her house.
Yes, Ezekiel was slightly perfectionist and maniacal. Then they went out of the room on a common agreement.
“He wants to know if we can spend the day near the lake to bathe” All the teenagers of that time seemed to understand better and acquiesced. So it was with these words that the teenagers got up like one person and went out. They scared some of the students in the corridors. It must be admitted that seeing all this group coming towards you, Draco and Harry in the lead, did not normally presage anything good. They arrived at the edge of the lake and all sat down in a compact mass.
“You two! When we say we keep this secret, it means that you don’t laugh together or anything!” The Potionist began.
“Then look at Nathaniel, his eyes are as green as Harry's and his hair just as blond as Malfoy's” Ron turned his head to Hermione.
Later that day, Harry finally decided to go up in his room. Draco hadn’t come down at all, sulking. Harry entered the children room and Emett was laughing with his four friends on his bed. Harry was happy to see that the sadness that was here before wasn’t there anymore.
“No, don’t worry” Alarik replied. The Potionist's eyes nearly came out of his skull and he tried to chase the four boys away. They agreed to go out once the older found what he was looking for.
Harry awoke with a start when he heard a scream. He straightened up quickly. Draco looked down at him smiling.
“What is this story of children, Harry? Dumbledore didn’t want to tell us anything” The three children approached them, along with Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Theo. Upon seeing Dimitri, Remus opened his eyes.
"I mean, Voldemort got Daddy angry and Daddy threw all his anger on that poor Voldy” Draco frowned. How's that poor Voldy? The children noticed his questioning.
“I don’t know, Harry. I mean, do you really think a sixteen year old boy would want to talk about his love life to his dad?” Harry nodded. Draco was probably right but Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that he should help his son.
“Auntie Pansy!” Harry stopped when he heard that and saw the little boy throwing himself into the girl's legs. The latter widened her eyes as she heard this and moved back, but Draco put his hand behind his back and pushed her slightly forward. She bent down and took the boy in her arms. He wrapped his arms around his neck and hugged her. Harry was still standing in front of them and Draco looked up at him. A thin smile, almost imperceptible, took place on the blonde's lips and Harry thought he was hallucinating when he thought that this smile was for him.
