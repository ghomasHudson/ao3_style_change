"Would you have preferred me to attend Hogwarts, or Durmstrang?"
"You're a right mystery," Fred started, "and what was that about Harry Potter?" George finished.
"He's currently in Albania's Prokletije, specifically the South of Maja Jezercë." Draco said as he re-interpreted the letter Pot brought with him.
"Why are you here?" He asked gruffly.
"He's the only person who is involved in both worlds down there. I would say he's the best and only option we have until you can track down another person who's ever so willing to cross between the two without reluctance only for the sake of gathering information that would be sitting in the dust for another five years."
"You would?"
"Mother, last I've talked to her and not with a letter, told me the British M's sent dementors to the school. Other than being concerned about Luna, she has written me about how uncomfortable it makes her which surely is an understatement, I've gotten an offer for a one-on-one training session with the students at the end of this Quidditch holiday match so I hardly have time to care about those dementors. Viktor's got an offer on the Bulgarian Quidditch Team, which leaves us rather bleak. A private potions competition next week hosted at the Black Wing, I need to start my application for the Crow's Head for this year, and Matthew needs help growing pumpkins for some reason."
Draco reigned in a laugh, but couldn't hold back a mocking smile.
"Yes, yes, Vivian would have." A bitter expression crossed Catherine's face.
"I don't see how three children can be more important than the murder of our previous Minister Millicent Bagnold." Minister Fudge snapped.
Their table gave an ominous crack.
Narcissa folded the letter away.
"Mate, you look like death has turned you inside out." Fred and George chorused at Blaise.
"It's fine. It isn't the first time this happened."
The third road, right before Knockturn, had an obvious difference in class like the slums in Paris, a building which stood out like a sore thumb amongst grey roofs. It had stained-glass windows, for the love of Morgana, and the entrance was protected in physical charms engraved into its walls. It was made, Draco realised upon a closer look, like a weaker disillusionment charm, in Gobbledegook.
Draco winced at the unnecessary information.
"What if, what if I ask you to send me to Hogwarts this year? I'm a Malfoy, you said I must act like a Malfoy." Draco spoke helplessly.
"I don't think," he started carefully, "I can admit that I am apprehensive of you. Can we compromise on this as being nervous, instead?"
"This would leave an impression on my head but not a solid memory, and a stronger memory in yours but foreign. As raw as it is, I'd have to remove it from you after you've assimilated it in your own head. And by that point the memory, having gone through two receptions, would be useless."
"You'll do it alone?"
"I remember the first time I fell in denial: "But what if that bad person's really dead?"" Draco imitated himself in a high-pitched voice, then giggled with Luna for a few seconds before an idea came to mind. "Is there a spell or ritual concerning revivement, strength, or fertility?"
"Master Regulus spoke of the House of Fawley." Kreacher muttered.
"How horrifying."
"Who are you?"
"Then he's outside." Luna whispered.
Draco swore gently, a soft
"To Bluckbert's."
Blaise's schedule resembled his as much as their discussed choices. They paired in every class, some shared with other Houses in what seemed to be an effort of unity. But that, too, would have only applied when the professor's weren't as loyal to their houses as the students were, an impartiality and stubbornness shining through every brief moment of decision between the awarding of point and compliments.
They reached for the salvaged tea cups with an elegant turn of their body.
"Both." Blaise groaned out as he closed the blinds of their unit.
"OPPUNGO!"
Draco looked surprised the most, while Luna simply narrowed her eyes. The other Hufflepuff and Slytherin, however, only took on amused looks.
"That place still has discrimination against wizards. It was their headquarters in 1612, Draco, you should know better-"
"Zaxter!" Agatha called, "don't sleep in there again!"
"The dog which escaped Azkaban."
"Mother sends her regards." Draco finished, and snapped up the parchment.
Susan threw another firewood into the fireplace, and poked it with the iron stick. She hadn't been invited, but had invited herself, and they'd all but agreed not to exclude her from conversations she privately told him were interesting. Her interest had more to do with the political gossip Pansy carried around with her like a suitcase of legal lawsuits, and so the two mostly kept to themselves by the fire in their personal world.
"But pit Durmstrang's graduate against a Hogwarts' graduate," the two chorused, "and Beauxbatons will crawl for Hogwarts' mercy."
"You did it very gently," she assured, standing to her feet and patting Blaise's head, "it was like a small hurricane."
Jason Olse stood still by the nearest wall, sectioned to the delegates of East Asia, and himself in the disguise of the German delegate Albert Aachen. The Germans, fortunately for Jason, hadn't regained their standing within the International Confederation from their participation of les-autres' genocide. While being German wasn't a problem, the representative of said country was a thin subject of discrimination.
"Are we continuing?"
"When I casted the Accio, I immediately stunned him. We were planning to turn him in to Mr. Scrimgeour, but as he was absent, had to turn to Susan's aunt."
"Accio Peter Pettigrew."
"Where's Bertha Jorkins?"
"Wondrous, how people don't notice such things. Durmstrang could have claimed unaffiliated no matter how many people stated otherwise. Aunt Vivian told me it's recorded in Durmstrang's history that it once took pride in their student's influence, although many disapproved of the deaths of other wizards and witches, mostly because of how the entire Wizarding World knew it was Grindelwald in particular. Unlike the one in England, in fact."
"You've met her?" Hermione Granger swerved her head to him with gleaming, rather imposing eyes.
"No, I'm telling Aunt Narcissa."
"But there was a dog."
"We're already planning something, not for you though," Fred took over his brother's mouth, "we want to have a good laugh, especially at such a time, and we're hoping you'd help us turn the Great Hall's sky pink."
"He threw around the idea so carelessly?" Vivian asked tiredly.
No debates on political issues in class, however, unless you are to personally demand an individual meeting with me in my sleep afterwards. But the most recent legislation, if you look at the thirteenth clause of the recent act passed by the French Ministry of Magic, limits the entries into the country as well as in similarity the twenty-third deportation act by-"
Classes ranged between stressful to easy for Draco. Draco's lessons with Uncle Jason and Miss Catherine had went from morning to mid-day in his childhood, and Durmstrang's lessons, self-planned depending on the amount of electives, lasted from morning to early evening now. Aside from the mandatory classes he had been assigned on the first week, he had Aerodynamics, Languages, and Pavilion activities spread across the week every other day.
"Langley? No wonder, France dislikes being in the same room as Britain. Especially on American soil."
His Aunt's hand wavered in the air before settling to her fountain pen, to which she did nothing with. Uncle Jason moved away and retreating towards the furthest corner of the room. Draco paused in reading out his report.
"There's been someone going around trying to find something from us. Owen sent me a note yesterday saying he did not know whom, exactly. I've been busy organising some private educational practice I failed to notify everyone to double back."
"Luna?" Draco crossed an arm over his chest, and rubbed his eyes with another. Draco, she returned with a smile, and tilted her head. If anyone had known how to read her movements without being distracted by the bullshit she spouted, they would've been surprised at her mocking tone.
"Ohmygod," Hermione stuttered, "did you all know? Why are you telling us now? Why not earlier?"
The bar didn't have a name. The door was small, and the place looked like a remodelled house more than a shop of any kind, but they pushed through nonetheless and nearly tripped over a stool. The bar was crowded, stinky, and to the misfortune of Draco's boots, was littered with liquids of any and all kinds.
"Sirius Black." Draco murmured.
"It's really funny," Luna spoke again, "how Ron's rat is missing a finger too."
The smile wiped off his mouth instantly, Draco turned on his heels uncaring of the twins interests, and headed towards Hogwart's kitchen.
"Only you would criticise the Head of Fawley with such venom, grand-père. But I do request you to exchange the headmaster of Durmstrang with yourself."
"The European Union of Institutions is rarely heard of, most have taken to assuming it as a branch of the International Confederation's Educational Office." Joheim interrupted in surprise.
"Last week? You mean, a few days ago?"
"For what it's worth," Sirius Black said, "I'm sorry about the mess you're in."
"No. I am interested, but there's a few days. There are so much other electives to consider 'till next week, figuring out the rest of my schedule aside from the mandatory classes would take time."
"Anything of Harry Potter, is available for your ears. You'll have to tell me anything you know of Regulus Black first, however, before the tales of Harry Potter's famous adventures are regaled."
"Fine." She agreed, and out floated a notebook, pen, and wallet from behind the counter.
"The Pavilion's representatives are responsible for social matters. The school's representatives oversee the educational and larger problems, like class assignments, in collaboration with the professors. The Pavilion is made up from top to bottom of students, and there are often invited alumni to hold sessions on the greetings and social niceties of certain parts of the Wizarding World. Last, the German Minister came to talk about what manners are required for an official hearing in the German court."
"Draco, was it? Your Aunt will only be a passing face, a portrait to be hung by the other Headmasters and Headmistresses of Durmstrang. But me, I'm Durmstrang itself. It can't run without me," Matthew laughed, "whoever comes to my position next will be struggling to fill my space. No-one would have done better or more than I have, for the past fifty years. Not at all. People will say in a hundred years, "do you remember old Matthew? He always told me where to go" and "Matthew? Oh, he worked at Durmstrang. Good old man". That is what they would say."
VIvian had been silent the entire time Narcissa talked to Flitwick, standing by the stairs. Their first personal tea-time after two and three months had been cut close with Mr. Flitwick's sudden request, but overhearing their entire conversation from not a few meters away, Vivian felt a cold settle over her stomach at the mention of an Avada Kedavra.
"Yes, I see. Why don't we step inside now, if you've remembered to bring the key?"
"Naked?" Draco echoed, slightly annoyed.
"Chartres is...was the bastard of mankind, but had more social outings than any of us could manage, so he knew more gossips. His eyes and ears, well, someone must have found his knowledge as painful a thorn in the side as I did. Catherine's looking into why he went to Knockturn. The answer to his death lies there."
"Who is he tracking?"
"Didn't you say you were here to apply?" Draco shouted after her disappearing back.
Draco looked once down at the scratched surface of the ground, before he was dragged to the ground by his mouth and neck.
"Thank you." Draco replied.
"I'm not mad," Draco rolled his eyes. "Monsieur Chartres, Bartemius Crouch, Bertha Jorkins, and Volly. What connects them when three are anti-Death Eaters? That's something I need answered."
Catherine looked tongue-tied, until she frowned and snapped a change of topic. Smiling, Vivian sat on the wooden chair.
"Very true. Percy Weasley's been keeping some sensibility in the matter and from what the professors have noted, managed to confine the rumours in Hogwarts to Hogwarts alone. Imagine how its reputation would have swayed had the parents known to what extent Sirius Black had gone to harm a student. We wouldn't have been here, especially not Draco. Thank Merlin for Percy, really." Pansy rolled her eyes, "all of your brothers are estranged from politics other than him, and he at least knows where to start than shaking up the school even more. As a student, no less!"
"You have been under the care of Jason's father, and you will be the stepping stone of my heir. Don't you dare, Chartres, forget your position."
"Thank you. But the location, too, please? Draco may have stayed here for long but this is an entirely new environment from England. To find Durmstrang was a fortress was an entirely different matter from knowing Hogwarts was a castle." Blaise explained.
Pansy scowled. The unspoken rule amongst Slytherins was the necessity of their own secrets remaining within the house. The house was similar to Durmstrang's social environment in many ways, aside from the continuous gossip and intrusion on one's personal affairs, but the conjecture Pansy left open was to be stayed buried.
Draco, and by the confusion of blinks, Blaise, felt something missing.
After going up another staircase, and ignoring the wide reception room which seemed to be decorated with ancient artifacts, they rushed down the left-most corridor, until, with another small flight of stairs, they reached a gold-lettered door saying Amelia Bones.
Blaise had never seen Draco cry. It was further accurate to say he assumed most of Draco's emotions were fabricated, with the amount of occlumency which possessed his mind, and he assumption was truer than to his liking. Neither had he seen an emotion so strongly expressed as the red flush falling down his cheeks, or the wide glare of his eyes, he didn't know how to react.
Vivian Fall, Headmistress of Durmstrang, was a woman of many capabilities which were rumoured, and unconfirmed. But now, they could sense the loss of heaviness which lingered around a figure such as the Headmasters of a school, the weight which had settled around their shoulders within the grounds, the grounding pressure before professors, Draco could finally admit the reason behind his instant dislike for Hogwarts.
"I did not intend to. But tell me, don't distract me. Should I remain loyal to a cause, or live befitting the life of a Malfoy?"
They stayed up until the candled burned itself out.
"Us?" The twins echoed.
"Yes. Blacks. Sometimes I wonder if magic itself had twisted their genetics into becoming a stubborn breed. Like hounds, that house, one bite and they never let go."
Midnight had passed a second after he arrived on the front steps of 12 Grimmauld Place. Tea had left the moment his feet touched the ground, leaving his hand grasping at the doorknob instead of her winkled, bony hands.
"I'm sorry for being impolite. I had to ask you something, and thought the fastest route would be to use a cook's temper against the cook." He dissolved his magic, his black hair turning back to pale platinum and his eyes back to grey.
"A run-down house, far from Hogwarts, I assure you, not in British soil. He's been sustaining himself by the blood of purebloods. Fordham was," she hesitated, "a likely coincidence."
"Stealing is not the proper term. I may have had to drag the Blacks into a deeper involvement within our House, which I assume is the reason why you wish to kill me, but I've had the mother's consent. You cannot possibly blame me for choosing a Black, when our previous Head had been a Black himself. It is rare to have a hereditary Head in our House, I'd have you know."
"Yes. Immortality."
It was in times like these he appreciated his well-known presence within the school as he eased himself onto Aunt Vivian's rolling chair and covered himself with her knitted blue cardigan.
"Is that not what I told you? I swore to you that the person is not an
"We don't know," Draco said slowly, "when Monsieur Chartres was planning to meet Miss Millicent. She could have headed out earlier, or later, and their meeting could have been appointed for far later in the evening. Monsieur Chartres is enough of a man to do that. We also don't know where, or how Peter Pettigrew plays into this. We unfortunately do not have an auror in our midst to steal the reports, and Mr. Zimman who cannot access said information.
Draco watched Cedric's eyes turn into a glare, but read contemplation.
The salaud made a three-sixty and zoomed right past Marcus' groins, to which Draco followed. He ignored the following shout, and gritted his teeth. Draco had utterly, truly enough of the thing Marcus had forced him to follow once a week, the salaud which was geared and charmed to play two players against another depending on the magician or witch's intent. He often had to see all unsightly sights of Marcus Flint when invited to a training session, and even now did he have to avoid running his face across the Slytherin's keeper's mouth who'd been doing nothing but gape in horror.
He was similarly taught how to approach such subjects with ample demonstrative scenarios Aunt Vivian had given him to burn himself through the night.
Erlnier was positive his cheeks were aflame, but nodded quietly.
Perhaps the blame fell upon her shoulders, as she had wished his faster maturity and made it so. She had shown life and death in equal measures, noticeable even when he roamed the courts with his friends. The lingering sense of depression, the knowledge of good and bad and the in-between. Questionable morals and thoughts.
Draco rolled his eyes.
"Regio!"*
"Accosted," Ron snorted, "yes, accosted."
A boy, seated opposite their round table, leaned in.
"But he kept my spellwork a secret."
Neither of them made a move to acknowledge knowing the rumour, but Blaise seated them in the furthest corner of the library which, for the first time in long, was fortunately vacant.
"You miserable soot," Agatha giggled.
And between himself and the door stood Kreacher.
"Where is he now?" Narcissa whispered as she looked out the window.
"How is Rachel, and Alexandra?" Catherine leaned forward.
"Never be it known that he's less competitive," Draco smiled, "his ego's as large as his broom. He's found a competitor in Cedric Diggory of all people."
"The very word."
Luna hummed in displeasure.
"Yes."
Vivian mulled silently allowing Draco to twist the tip of his fingers behind his back. It was an improvement from his nervous habit of twisting his wrists his uncle had severely disapproved of.
"It's biology, darling. Now, students have been attempting to organise an introductory greeting, the older years, for Saturday by the means of Quidditch. Or flying. There were not many details involved in their propaganda. I recommend you watch, Draco, apparently it's going to be quite a sight."
"I must speak to Mr. Scrimgeour." Flitwick repeated.
"Haven't Aunt Vivian told you? She was very reluctant to have me here."
"We could simply check with a Revelio as long as the rat can be smuggled out for an hour tomorrow evening."
"Crouch Junior was known to be devoted follower of Voo-doo. If there was an intruder which approached the house with ill-intent, with the kind of magic Bartemius Crouch has and his ownership over Winky, the house elf, both should have noticed. But Bartemius Crouch and his elf didn't notice until sounds came from his son's room, which means someone went there to approach his son for help or pleasantries. Neither seems possible, does it? So whoever it was didn't have enough magic to be noticed, at all."
Vivian was startled out of the tea she had reached for, something she had been pulling out of her brown suitcase, and laughed.
"Do you object to it wholeheartedly?" Vivian asked.
"Under Vivian's influence, you will not deny."
"You are loyal to Regulus Black." Erlnier concluded softly.
"Know everything." Vivian's smile faded into a wry twist.
"Vivian. I am not your housekeeper. You've only given me a worthless key which can barely slide into the house on the best of days, and even if I do enter it is for the sake of dusting and clearing the mould from your walls. To fill the void of no presence for over ten years and I-"
"Think about it," George said to Fred in a complete dismissal of Draco's groan, "think of how all those ickle Slytherins would scream when they find us naked in Draco's bed!"
"He found a place with the Weasleys. He was their pet for several years, passed down from one brother to another. But now that you've raised the question, I'm beginning to question who helped him become a pet. Selling a magical creature requires an official registration, a shopkeeper, and someone willing to sell the pet to the shopkeeper. Nonetheless a pet to the Weasleys. Do you reckon Mr. Scrimgeour could help with this?"
"How similar is it to the stuff I've been learning?" Draco looked at Aunt Vivian, who didn’t answer and remained buried in a paper.
Clair hummed in agreement.
"They should be done with the Sorting of the Houses by now. Each student to a house, then the feast which we are supposedly meant to starve, until the Headmaster deigns to remember us."
In fact, if it hadn't been for the fact that their loyalty lay with the House he would have thought they could have accepted the ideals of all sorts. They treated criminals in the same tongue they treated ministers, and once discussed Grindelwald's preferred lover in all but political terms that Draco only later learned that the 'lover' they talked of was a man.
Draco looked around the dim row of faces.
The Thestrals which moved their carriages tilted their heads, and a few screams, delighted and frightened, ringing the air thinly. Dementors trailed behind them, ahead of them, beside them, flocking a march of the moving dead. But Draco couldn't have cared less, and Luna more invested in Draco's musings as she made him hold another frog, that by the time the ride had ended they had missed the sight of a black serenade against the night sky.
"It should be instinctual by now, Erlnier," Jason said as he stood, "to give a gentle push of your magic towards any object you touch to confirm its property beforehand, nonetheless an object which comes through a dimensional magic you made, which is unstable from what I'm seeing." He flipped the Herbology book on his knee, which fell open on page 108.
Draco had to therefore listen to Hermione Granger's unending rants of Ron Weasley's stupidity most days, at all times.
Draco ran the marble through his fingers, and didn't bother picking it up when it rolled across the floor. He rubbed the towel strongly into his hair once more, and waved the closet open with a hand to eye his clothes for the day.
"Kreacher can enter Agin-Gamchicoth?" Kreacher asked in awe.
"Lestrange."
"That is not my concern." Draco smiled.
Draco had asked if he should have embedded the idea much sooner into their heads, but Luna had pointed out he'd only been distracted.
"I've heard of it," Blaise whispered loudly, "it can apparently talk in your head, too."
Professor Flitwick was an old person, who'd spent the prime of his life in safer waters. He would have joined the Aurors had it not been for the discrimination and, what he could imagine, an upcoming war against workplace solitude (or the Ministry itself) more often mistaken as a goblin, and hence would've received no respect from the better purebloods who visited the place. Sometimes, he cursed his ability to read micro-expressions.
"Yes. The first face people see, will be them. The second, a few records. Third, an ancestral joining of the sacred twenty-eight through many, many bloodlines, and fourth, the finished line of the Flamel through myself. Fifth, our dear Jason from a muggle family, and where else could they go but run to a dead end? It's the reason the Heads are unaffiliated by blood but talent."
Blaise peered over his shoulder.
When the gates did swing open from the iron bars which lined its first entrance to the last oak doors which swung backwards, all that remained was a woman dressed in pristine black, the only colour on her a vivid red cloak which fell neatly to its side. She stepped forwards thrice and did not make to move any further.
"To Bluckbert's?"
A boy swore, and Amiea soon reappeared next to Draco in her rush to leave.
"Branleur, don't you dare think I don't know what you're planning."
"You see, my Aunt knows the political aspects of this side of the Wizarding World better than anyone else could possibly grasp. You could have probably guessed by her explanations, but she also has well intended connections. If her influence is enough to sway the Headmaster's position, what couldn't be used as a weapon for Durmstrang's own safety? I've only heard the worst of Karkaroff's reputation throughout my visits outside, especially when the grandmas decide to involve me in their knitting circle." Draco frowned, distracted, and the class sent warm compassionate glances.
"Drag it down. Thank you, Luna."
"Both." Taysa replied, her cheek twitching and her mouth holding back a smile. There was a total of five galleons, now.
Ten galleons swayed precariously.
"I fear death. The fall of the House of Fawley. Besides, I highly doubt you've ever heard of a younger Flamel other than I?"
Draco's eyes sparked in curiosity.
"You have once insisted that the House of Fawley does not involve themselves with outside matters and have not for three generations."
"Slightly of burnt twigs." Blaise added.
"It's fine. I don't mind."
He watched her stick the letter deep inside the book's page 108 until its words swam around her elbow, settling across her bed in preparedness for a long conversation to come. Ravenclaw had two beds to a room, but no-one wished to be with Luna Lovegood, nonetheless sleeping next to her and her imaginary creatures.
Sighing, he stood, turned, and promptly knocked another student over.
"And so, you see, Hogwarts is vastly different from Durmstrang by the means of its flimsy appearance. As grand as it might be, a castle can't possibly compare to a fortress, can't you understand?"
"Sirius Black will, as long as Peter Pettigrew is fed Veritaserum, be freed. And more likely at as Potter's illegal guardian unless Dumbledore allows."
"We've no idea." The twins chorused.
"No," Luna shook her head gently, "I used to draw the carrots, but you're here."
He ran straight into Matthew's back.
"I have similarly been passed down certain memories of the past, to the furthest possible to the most recent. That is what I have given you. Past time, that memory will become yours, the experience similarly familiar. The only dangers to such a method would be your own misconceptions." Vivian whispered gently.
"Your brother," Catherine replied with horrified eyes, "has no time to waste on any other human being on earth save you, and I would be disgusted the moment I see him with anyone else because none can possibly be within the same league he stands in."
"Don't forget the time you conjured that wave of water down the hall."
Draco fell into a tiring chatter with Pansy, a clear dismissal as he moved out of the classroom.
Aunt Vivian had sent him her violin.
"How vulgar. Are you imagining things, now?"
"That's cheating." Blaise declared solemnly.
"I offered you my brother, didn't I? You turned me down too many times I've lost count."
But she was gazing at the same boy before her, in all his near thirteen years of age, with an identity crisis.
"Draco. You know there's an illegal portkey at Paralia Legrenon. He's heading towards us, not further. You're more likely to arrive in Albania the moment he leaves. Unless," Luna stepped closer threateningly, "you're planning to see him with your own eyes."
"I see."
convinced you to send Sirius Black after him as revenge! When I confronted him about it-"
"Miss Bluard?"
"Why-"
He'd never heard an elf wail before, but he heard it now, and preferred to never hear of it again. Kreacher had a grating, dark voice which, accompanied with his cries established a scream of a ghost. Elves could choose immortality if they so chose, but many aged with their masters of their choosing, reliant on the hereditary magic which flowed through their veins and became their weapon, and home.
(She knew Vivian was never the one to give away her emotions quite as visibly as she was now if it weren't done in sincerity. If she were to object Vivian would stop and repent.)
She had released Lucius Malfoy by the end of Draco's first year of school just in time for the man to act his part of the story. But she was not going to do the same towards Draco. Everyone had sworn not to mess with his memories, or judgements, or growth, and what stood before her was of Draco's own making. Erlnier Fawley was only the best of what Draco could offer, and if he did not figure that out now, he was going to suffer in insecurity.
"Well, this is it. Thank you for accompanying us to Slytherin's dorms. You can head back, now. I'm sure you know more passages to Gryffindor than I've explored."
"Stop shouting." Uncle Jason pressed out.
Draco waited until everyone had settled back into their seats, their eyes on his, listening to his every word as a clock ticked silently in the background.
"Nowhere. That can't be. An animagus takes as much magic to maintain than an average transfiguration." Draco heaved.
Granger faltered briefly, shifting in her seat as though she would make to leave. When she saw Draco staring, she lifted her bag and hugged it close to her chest and stayed. When Higgs walked in on them, he said nothing about the Gryffindor by the window and, instead pretending as though he hadn't seen, slapped an envelope down.
When Saturday came, Draco did watch the show.
Without the Quidditch World Cup coming in time for his authority to rule over, he wouldn't have had his name mentioned in society or the papers, leaving him an office paper-pusher for the Triwizard Tournament instead. It's been years since he began planning for the Triwizard Tournament, albeit in idea, and to only have it acknowledged now as the Head of International Magical Cooperation...
"Oh, my. You do scare me sometimes. No, Erlnier, not everyone, unfortunately. And we are commoners. Common wizards and witches you can spot easily on any street of any Wizarding World. What sets us apart, I suppose, is that we tend to know."
"Explain, Vivian. I swear I had expected the worst when you asked me to check if this house had burned down while I was on an excursion in Norway. No explanations, front or back. Do you know I cancelled a perfectly exquisite date for this?"
But she'd grabbed his hand and twisted him away with far more stealth than when she'd first arrived, before he could reply.
His uncle's words had been the decisive reason behind his current plea, although he had grown a major love towards Durmstrang as a home.
"Jason? You do know this is not public property." She said tiredly as she stalked towards the two.
"Call me mad," Blaise bit out his words, "but that's still a rat."
The very ponytail gathered by the top of her head included five strands of braids with clasps she had brought into fashion not a week before, the clasps tinkling against her back with each step she took. From what he gathered from the girls who often gave him chocolates, they could not find the clasps anywhere but in a certain high-end muggle store which required, even in the transition between their fares, a fair amount of their allowance.
"Have you hurt my friends?" Draco asked as he was dragged, rather nonchalantly for his position.
I've recently read posts of many authors leaving Ao3 due to its more darker nature, and how it's bordering dangerous levels.
Draco frowned. Luna hadn't meant a disagreement by her tone, but it could only imply he was to choose more in the future. Draco nodded and attempted not to think of a chaotic future. They spent the rest of their breakfast in silence, the morning sunlight just dawning on them, half to seven. The Great Hall was empty as were their required personal space for a few minutes longer, before he heard the first voices echo off the walls.
"I did see that." Hermione betrayed as she stuck her nose back into Marcus' potions notes.
"Then have you," Luna glanced behind him, "at least tried running?"
"If you mistake such a memory as your own, and not an inherited one, it may become easier for you to fall into the very habits that the previous head had, losing your own personality. When faced with a conflict of the past and the present, it's important to accept what is but remember the facts of then. Do you understand?"
"Full of snakes!"
"It's a problem of independence," the girl spoke once more, although her sight was fixated on the sky above her, "Durmstrang offers more independence of the students than any other educational institution. We have no restrictive wards on buildings aside from the lodgings, unlike Beauxbatons where everything is clearly divided, and security runs on approval and supervision.
"Tell him yourself," Draco answered, "you'll need some time. Bring the letter to the library after classes, sealed if you must. Pot isn't allowed in the owlery."
Harry Potter, because the scar couldn't be more pronounced, stepped forward to talk.
Yurika Haneda rolled her eyes, stretched between the fainting couch and the second couch.
There was a unanimous glare shot from all the Ravenclaws who sat around the fireplace. They were all bent over books, which were scattered from the bookshelf to their feet, and quills and ink pots which filled every spot between. The only path they deigned to leave was a narrow, small road towards the stairs in between books of spaces the size of half a foot.
"Deep breaths."
"The Ministry? Pick us up!" Susan yelled as she shook Blaise back and forth, "is your brain so lacking that you couldn't say Professor Flitwick took us to the Ministry of Magic due to a mis-pronounced spellwork that affected us all!"
"No, I'm simply implying that someone will step up and argue that the school should not offer an opportunity for Ilvermorny to expand their influence with Hogwarts by rescinding their tradition. Then all their discussions will die."
Draco looked down at the fine craftsmanship, and lamented his future use of the few galleons his mother sent every week on finding a suitable case.
"Hermione won't tell anyone."
Vivian watched Catherine's mouth fall open even as she hesitated in tearing her eyes off the picture, a scene of inflated cheeks which accompanied a heavily pouting mouth.
"But you're happy."
Draco skimmed through the list once more.
Vivian looked around the classroom, at the glittering stares of her students she had come to care for, at the curious stare of her Draco, and the beady eye of her eagle. She made time hold its breath within the classroom, and took the moment to bemoan this life with closed eyes.
They hadn't passed more than a few paces down they were settled at the Headmaster's office. Draco took in as much as he could, a revolving staircase had been the least of his surprise but the objects which sat around Dumbledore's room, not as dangerous than his aunt's as Headmistress but unguarded, and left open if anyone had but a mind to overhear the password at the right time.
"What could be more suitable than to say Professor Flitwick had to pick you guys up from the Ministry of Magic?" Blaise replied, Draco's arched glance completely missing him by a fool's height.
The woman looked even more startled, and she visibly calmed.
"But Dumbledore." Draco insisted.
"What a nice lady." Luna said as she reached for her drink.
"I'm ignoring her," he decided, "do you have anything else for me to take note of?"
He read the court proceedings pertaining his guardianship when he was taught to read legal documents. He was certain Aunt Vivian had started with a topic that concerned himself to rouse his interest in official documents and formalities, and it had worked, because he had already memorised the legalities of custody proceedings of children under the age of three.
"Should your words be considered an intrusion of my privacy," Draco drawled, "or should there be more wards around my belongings?"
always was," Draco heard his Aunt hiss, "were you ever?"
"Oh, it's fine, it's fine, help me put these back up, won't you dear."
With the outpour of words, in short, raspy breaths, Susan pushed the door open.
"Merlin's balls, I'm so sorry. I wasn't looking."
"What warrants your sudden return?"
Their eyes met, insanity against clarity.
"They're too fat." She agreed.
Friend, Peter? We're barely acquaintances. To know you're alive, however, can only mean so many things but one certainty. Sirius Black hadn't been lying about his innocence." Amelia Bones levelled herself to Peter Pettigrew's wide, frozen eyes, "and you have something to admit."
"Oh, Amelia! Amelia, it's been such a while." The rat paled as he took in the situation. "I can explain, let me explain. There's a misunderstanding here, somewhere, you must hear me out!"
"There's less to talk of when Dumbledore's in attendance. Aren't you getting too comfortable with him?" Jason asked as he immediately began to pull off the tie.
Draco groaned harder as the Great Hall started to flood with students.
In that aspect, added to Hermione's unending discouraging rants of Ronald Weasley, he could barely tamper the growing judgement against most of the Weasleys. Luna wrung her hair out again, and dipped it in the Great Lake, again. Draco hauled her waist back when she tipped over, again.
"Many of our mothers knew how close Sirius Black had been to the Potter's, and through several confirmations, we had a theory Sirius Black was an animagus. Not only was the theory proven when my friend, Blaise, saw a black dog on the Quidditch field when Harry Potter was attacked by dementors, I saw the dog around several times, especially when dementors were near."
"I've changed my mind," Erlnier declared, "I want to hear your story. And maybe, if I find it more valuable than anything else, I'll help you. I'm Erlnier Fawley, from the House of Fawley. There are many ways and more to grant a wish of yours."
"Can you feel it?" Blaise rushed out.
Sirius Black rolled his eyes.
"Who will you be talking to?" He asked out of necessity.
"Tell me all you know of Sirius Black."
Draco swung his direction back to Marcus.
"Named individuals?"
"Vestigium."
Draco took in Luna's brighter smile, and concluded: "You know her."
Catherine finally removed her brown coat and sat with a distinct scepticism across her features.
"What a waste, then, since you've had to give up so much."
"You make it sound so easy, dear."
"But the Three Broomsticks is too well-known for both Hogwarts' students and professors alike. If we run into anyone, how are we to explain the unsupervised leave?"
"I've been keeping track of Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew. Aside from the fact that Sirius Black is an animagus, and the probability Peter Pettigrew may be even more so, I've nowhere to go from that point! Besides, I can't track down horcruxes when I can sense its magic moving throughout the entire school."
Between the two, there hadn't been heartfelt conversations perhaps a few confessions, but none so detrimental to their private lives. There were secrets one simply didn't tell others, and so it had been for them. Yet when Draco found Blaise's distinct figure in the crowd of chattering students, and Blaise met Draco's eyes steadily, then, was there something irrevocably changed in their trust. It was too strong a foundation for two young children to build upon, they had but reached 13 years of age.
"Five were killed?" Narcissa asked.
Professor Flitwick reached for a biscuit.
"Did you feel that?" George asked his brother.
"I must say, it was a surprise to have two, very eager students from Durmstrang to greet our halls," Dumbledore rumbled softly, "and I must extend our warmest welcome."
"I feel completely neglected." Blaise chimed in. They ignored him.
"There is nothing much to tell." Jason answered.
Vivian glanced at him exasperatedly.
"Why?" Draco said as he lifted the list to his nose.
"I've found it more surprising that there hasn't been a mention of Hogwarts at all. Especially when all our parents have been informed of our lockdown but has resorted to letters instead of pressuring Dumbledore."
She stared.
"We rather prefer the privacy than the risks."
"Yes. No. No, I didn't."
Aunt Vivian only raised her eyebrow.
Cedric rolled his eyes. It wasn't until he came face to face with Draco Malfoy's grey-eyed stare which, frankly unnerved him in intensity up close, that he began to stutter. A palm was brought to the back of his neck in a nearly instinctive gesture.
"Then," Vivian said, "I would have to force you to agree. I will take your age into consideration and not force my opinion onto you too violently, but violence always seemed to be what convinced you best. So I will, and you will succumb, like all the other times we have interacted."
Draco pulled out a piece of pure white paper.
Draco took another glance outside, and found his father next to his mother. He frowned.
Pointing his wand at his palm, Draco raised both in the general direction of a far patch of grass.
"You were more inclined to teach me about Hogwarts even during my stay in Durmstrang during my younger years." Draco recalled.
Draco sighed into his right fist, glanced at the rat in his other fist, and continued to walk up to the castle.
"And Draco is our heir! What, would you have him do? Let it be published, the furthest we'd be known as would be a myth and the most as a false report. Thirty years after the war that would as well be a cut tail. In fifty years an unbelievable aspect. It is not the first time hints of our House's existence had been reported, it will not be the last. If need be we could call in every one of our life debts and still have most left out there."
"His eyes." Taysa drawled.
She lifted herself off the armchair, patting the clothes laid out for his wearing, and left like a ghost. The curtains had long been drawn.
And he valued his family, despite how independent he seemed.
"Plan?"
"Yes. She's awake at all hours. I've never seen her sleeping. For a Hufflepuff, she's rather determined, and mad. Obsessed, even."
"And because Harry Potter is a living, breathing project with years ahead of him, Dumbledore's propaganda will last as long as he lives."
He walked into the common room and came under the fire of eyes.
Aunt Vivian frowned and sank into her thoughts. Narcissa and Draco watched, because Vivian's reaction meant many things, even as the composure of Headmistress crumbled away.
"Vivian." Narcissa restated. "While it is understandable why you are eager in extracting my son out of British soil and the castle in Scotland, and have long come to the understanding of your position, it does create a question as to why it has to be my son."
Albus Dumbledore emerged from the stairs.
"Darling."
"The next time Tea comes to me with a question of your sanity, Merlin forbid, your mother will be the one to fish you out of Hogwarts."
"What were you talking about?"
"Attention, please! Thank you for applying to Aerodynamics. I am professor Vean Frey Aschdunskii
Vivian gathered her wits and smiled.
"She didn't specify which Crouch."
His aunt's hand, which he now recognised had been weaving through the strands of his hair, flinched away as rapidly as he sat up in the present. She stared at him with a questioning gaze, Uncle Jason leaning beyond a side of the nearest bookshelf in curiosity. Miss Catherine seemed long gone, as night had fallen.
"I would have to speak more freely with the Board of Governors regarding Dumbledore's lack of priorities, if you decide to transfer, but that can be done rather quickly." Lucius eyes the quill which sat by the corner of his desk.
There none who sent a heated glare of distrust.
"Unicorn blood, Philosopher's Stone, basilik, Chamber of Secrets." Draco repeated into his silver band.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You need to sort through the Death Eaters' bank records."
"Unfortunately." They whispered back together.
"Pranks don't work that way!" The twins chorused.
"Ew." Flint wretched at the upper half of the table.
Luna dragged him out onto the street. There wasn't much in broad daylight, where people were off at work and most elders were gossiping in rocking chairs. She crouched next to a narrow storm drain and pointed.
"Let's try three, first."
"Unless there are limited numbers."
"It was more of a sigh."
"Fred, you've read my mind."
Erlnier brought the cloak tighter around himself, and shuffled a step forward. He knew better than to keep his gaze ahead, he kept it down to find patches of blank spots on the road, his feet moving from heel to toe. He didn't know if the house had wards, or spells, which was why he'd been so far, but this was news. Information he didn't think he'd attain.
"People say there's only one of two witches or wizards which comes out of Durmstrang. Someone to lead the century, or someone dark." Cedric whispered to Hermione.
The four involved fell silent, placed around the sofas, while the other ten around the common room's walls listened in without a pause to their low chatter.
"So Uncle Jason is special?" Erlnier gasped.
"It's okay, Draco. We can go back if you want, it's okay."
"Impressive, yes. Students see me trying to clean up after their mess during passing they don't realise I'm doing half of the Headmistress' work. Better than Karkaroff, he made me do more than half, sure, he did." Matthew ranted, "nothing more than papers, he'd say, and leave them on his desk to go mingle with people I'd never heard of. Scrambling for reputation. So much on reputation. Why, if everything I had done for Durmstrang was recorded word by word I would have had a better reputation than Karkaroff himself, that coward."
Narcissa looked convinced, although it was well hid. Their conversation was coming to a close. A conversation which altered the fate of so many, yet so little in its ripples.
When he reached the end of the a corridor he read Regulus Arcturus Black.
A small goblin, well, large for its kind, received them at the reception situated further inside the long, empty corridor. If it was seen to untrained eyes, no-one would have noticed that the walls itself were revolving doors.
Whoever that elf was, she wasn't bound to the house. Erlnier could feel no hereditary magic radiating off her no matter how he concentrated. Instead he felt a distinct magic signature from her. Unlike Kreacher, who served the House of Black for generations and tried to uphold its values by trusting Regulus Black, she was bound under ownership loyal to none but one. And it wasn't Bartemius Crouch.
"Karkaroff himself isn't well established, no matter how much connection he can claim with the Dark Lord. As of now, where he has escaped a trial by the teeth of his skin, I would have to agree with Narcissa that he has disgraced himself. She said, and I quote: "I'd have stripped him of his own skin had he crawled any further in his own cowardice." Which is surprising, considering the future I had watched."
"But the magic of a hanging body seems to leave more rapidly than during the night, brother." She protested.
"Very well. I'll tell them so."
"180-40! Slytherin wins! Draco Malfoy caught the snitch! He, he caught it!"
Uncle Jason frowned.
"What she means, Draco," Aunt Vivian started with exasperation, "is that I knew her grandmother. The witch of illusions and imagery, legilimens and occlumency, the sole person who could beat me in the magic of memory altercations and mind. She entrusted Catherine before entering her own seclusion away from the magical society, as we both knew her granddaughter was much more gifted by birth. But Catherine herself-"
"Yes."
"No," Luna suddenly shot up from her seat, "Monsieur Chartres came over on the 1st of June. He died after meeting Bartemius Crouch on the 2nd. Millicent Bagnold was found dead on the 3rd when
"Very well.
"Is it a similar tradition, then, to take other children as heir?"
"Draco, your Slytherin friends clearly know something we don't. Talk. Now."
Draco clutched his broom tighter, but that was all to his reaction. He turned to look at the high voice, and the first thing which registered in his mind were the bright ginger hairs.
Draco stared at Luna, her soft voice causing doubt of his own ears. She hadn't been six when they first met, ten when he officially recognised her as a sister in all but blood, which, by his calculations, left four years of paperwork as he was thirteen. He faintly noted that her signature was a carrot. He rubbed his face.
"You're mistaken. Sitting in classes didn't mean I understood them. My earliest memory is enjoying watching the colours from spells students were testing. Aunt Vivian and the other professors mostly asked to deliver messages between themselves. The most participation was between Aunt Vivian's classes and the Arts for some project or the other."
"We're not here to ruin anything, Professor. We're here to talk. To give you a better reason for breaking your wall." Blaise waved vaguely in the direction of the wall which was still magically stitching itself.
"Right. Good night, Luna."
She did, delightfully, anticipate the joy of the theoretical regards in organising words as it served better evidence than trying to prepare a debate for hours, nonetheless looking for references to which clause and such law. But as her dearest brother had taken over those paper legalities, she had nothing to do but prepare her tongue for a ridiculous exercise.
Susan Bones snorted from where she stood while Cedric closed the door after her.
They were in the Grey Billard Room, turned 'educational room', or as what Aunt Vivian called 'The Room of Sorrows'. When asked, all she indicated was that it was the most fitting name for what would come to be in the future, a nostalgic memory. Draco had not understood, but came to call it so nonetheless.
Its trailing shadow flickered against the moonlight. The blinds, still drawn, stilled against the window.
The French Ministry of Magic had limited entries into the country. Many connections in the world of les-autres were closed, and government guarded checkpoints were set up for all passages. It was wise of them, Draco had thought, but it posed a problem when he planned to leave Durmstrang.
Vivian thought it would have been easier, certainly, to steal their child from under their noses than to go through the legalities of it all. There was a line to her determination she could muster before Narcissa decided to change her mind, a circumstance much gruelling than the case she had against the child's father, and for a considerate moment before heaving the key against the tinier lock, she wondered whether she should give up her little joys of mischief.
His hands gathered in hers were half of it's size. Small, young, still innocent.
Hermione Granger joins the fray.
She felt the magic resist against her intention even as she wrangled it around her grasp. Chartres was drawing his wand, his legs falling into a position, and she would have mocked him had it not appeared as arrogance. Vivian's imagination rampaged, and she wondered if she should bear more rudeness before deciding he was better without his consciousness. Lightening sparked between her fingers in brief flashes. Chartres' mouth opened to form a spell.
"Are you both drunk?"
Fred and George Weasley poked their heads around the corner, George immediately settling his hands on Draco's shoulder as though the question had meant no harm.
Draco raised his wand against the door, because the screaming wind was louder against his ear, and imagined every conjecture of magic possible before realising there was none he could produce effective against a dementor he had not studied. There had been no reason to, although it's appearance was briefly read in his fast research of the Wizarding Ministries' conduct and management. He only regretted not diving further into the matter, yet he wouldn't have known students would have been left to such a creature at large.
"We have two more hours, Blaise." Draco said, his voice still laced with shock.
"Plausible, but unnecessary." Professor Flitwick decided. Draco lowered his arms.
A merchant in the trade of information selling. That was the darker side of the House of Fawley, where its wealth developed and grew. Rarely was it done in the Wizarding World, but those who were able to fathom its area of business could only be certain of the House's muggle give and gain, hence the motto which changed in the late 1700's by Britanniea Bliod: Gain All, Rot All, Stay All.
"The decision's up to you. Did you get Vivian's present?"
"Safety before traditions, Draco. There are dangers lurking at Hogwarts even if you have the claim of protection as a pure-blood. Our concerns are better off with you in an environment where everyone knows the precautions of safety."
"You and your showing off." Blaise rolled his eyes.
Aunt Vivian intervened before Draco could shout his indignant remarks.
Jason tapped his raised elbow harshly down before moving onto Luna. Draco, frowning at the rustling of his clothes, recalled his aunt mentioning a speed which caused the clothes to paste against the skin, a fine control of strength which could burrow a sword at the right angle so as to not leave any blood behind. Draco swung the sword once more, and wondered.
"Yes, but an elf? You're barely 13."
"We've shared a theory that, in light of my mother's ruminations of how Sirius Black was so utterly enamoured with James Potter he was disowned, he couldn't have betrayed the Potters. In hindsight, there was much hypothesis and less facts we've acted on, but considering how there was only a finger left behind from his exchange with the deceased Peter Pettigrew, I spoke frequently of how Peter Pettigrew could have made an escape and turned the blame on Black. Obviously, with Ron's rat missing a finger, Luna thinks Peter Pettigrew may as well be an animagus."
"And I said you, should be a seeker."
"As rumoured?" Draco repeated incredulously.
she whispered, and the thin wisp shot out and clasped itself around Chartres' neck. His voice, which was producing the first syllable of an unforgivable, gurgled, and he fell back into his chair. Her vengeance was short, near meaningless, as she watched his head loll to the side.
"No way." George whispered.
There were a few shuffling feet, but none turned around. Professor Ash was a rather plump but well-dressed man, with a golden hanging pocket watch by his waistcoat. His colour theme was light grey and red, with silver accents, his shoes a very polished black without a single scratch. He wore a monocle, also silver, and had very bright brown eyes which flickered chocolate under the light.
The Great Lake shimmered underneath the morning sun. Luna's hair glittered with it, rather unseemingly as it was soaked. She rinsed her hair into the water even further, which prompted Draco to reach out and steady her balance. It had been some time since the Ravenclaws decided bullying was a time-consuming project, and like reasonable children regarding marks, had left Luna to her own devices.
He placed Diggory's letter on the table without a second glance, above Higgs', then placed his own. He reached for the nearest space of air by him, and to the incredulous gaze of all but Blaise Zabini, pulled an eagle out of thin air. Pot, the largest Philippine eagle of its breed, was greater than Draco's arm in height and taller than Draco in wingspan. So to have such a creature so silent in the library was, ironically, a majestic scene.
"Pansy," Draco blinked slowly, which was equivalent to a roll of his eyes, "if Amelia Bones finds you as important in the matter of family heritage, she will be contacting you soon."
"Why do you think it's Peter Pettigrew?"
Thank you, your comments and kudos brighten my day : )
And before Draco could nod or indicate a reply, Vivian pressed her finger against the forefront of his head.
"...and look at the facts."
is where the coursework, staff, and headmasters are filtered. Background checks, student control, statistics, and collaborations within the European continent. Aunt Vivian said the former is politics and the latter is of personal interest."
Vivian sighed. Reaching into an empty space before her, she pulled out a bottle of
The elf popped silently into existence, and by that Draco assumed Tea already sank her teeth into the poor thing, which was better dressed but tired, dark circles now blue.
"We will not. You, twins, will be remaining here underfoot, while Draco and Blaise  searches around. I will remain outside the shack setting wards to keep all animals within. If we are all to come across a lethal wound, you, twins, shall alert the staff as we remain outside the wards. There's a higher chance we'd not come across him anyways, as he's long separated himself from his family's hereditary magic. A misfortune to him, and a grand excuse for ourselves."
"Well, he sent me a rather knowing glare last Friday after we started hanging out with the twin gingers," Pansy whispered, "so when else but today? He's only so hard on his own house because he's to do it in secrecy; for the other houses to think we're privileged. But everyone knows he simply isn't bothered with all those other students."
Vivian smiled at Catherine's face struggling to swallow a scream.
He was rather grateful to Pansy as the students around her broke into laughter. She sat back with her arms crossed, huffing and pouting, even as she snuck a wink in his direction. He snuck one back, and resolved to buying her the French macaroons she'd been demanding.
"All in the name of publicising the Boy-Who-Lived?" Draco repeated dubiously.
"We're going off track," Jason interrupted, "this may be the last month of your holidays, Vivian, but Draco needs a year at most considering that the first years are rarely given challenging materials."
"You classes were designed the moment you took your seats. I will be explaining what would be expected of you during your stay at Durmstrang. You will receive your map and your schedules after this explanation. We will not be responsible for anyone who didn't receive a schedule, may you figure it out with the resources available."
They sat in Vivian's sitting room down Dover between red bricks.
This time, it was only Draco and Luna who seemed to communicate out of the corner of their eyes.
Draco glared at Blaise.
"Allow me to translate: 'I don't know his name, but the published Hogwarts Quidditch scores for the Hufflepuff team has risen sharply the past few months ever since their seeker changed. Any details?'"
"The House of Fawley," Vivian drawled out and took a breath, "the House of Fawley has inherited through generations a network larger than any ministry could achieve. When the magical world first went into hiding, the House of Fawley were the last descendants to maintain a connection to the other world, people known through governments and descendants of Royal Houses in that age, friends who've helped and been given help in equal measures. Of course, our founder went by a different name. What I can assure, however, is that our House falls from the beginning of the separation to this day, by Jason's heritage."
"Fous-toi."
"Hey. I'll go ahead." Blaise patted his shoulder, and moved.
"Do I need a new name?" She asked.
The elf's hiding place was small. Smaller than his form, and stank of rusty metal. Kreacher climbed in, still muttering, digging pieces of jewellery out of jewellery, until a soft silence washed over him.
The elf hissed back, hatred written across its every line, before tugging back an ear and growling at the floor.
"So Mr. Mort is more focused on the Boy-Who-Lived." Draco concluded as he rolled around, "but why is he gathering them now? What are they planning with more members? I can only expect a raid at this point in time, but he's so weak."
He peered through every door, and checked its frames first and foremost. All manors and houses were bound to name their rooms as was customary, divided into wings if the manor divided into further distances. But there were none here, which reassured him most, and he strode through the halls with simple glimpses of the names.
"Come on," he whispered a good few feet from the house, "let me
"Talk." She ordered.
"Luna." Draco smiled, and opened his arms tiredly.
"I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Malfoy."
"She owes me a favour, the first of the year. Don't you think, once they come to such a realisation, they would think otherwise of my actions?"
"Ha. Vivian. My goodness, I would have never seen that coming."
"Viktor Krum?" Draco asked for confirmation.
Their extremely liberal conversations led him to understand what lovers and the finer details of it meant, and his eight-years-old face exclaimed into redness behind his hands as Catherine watched on with amusement.
Her gaze fell to the papers, turned back towards Draco, until the tilt of her head gave away her understanding.
"Protection? You must have forgotten that it was Hogwarts' own protection which allowed Black within a common room."
"Sorry," a voice came from behind.
The knife he was given when he turned eleven before he officially began his studies in Durmstrang was a classic Bowie knife of the United States' KA-BAR standard made by D.E. Henry with the blade of a Scimitar, so faintly curved it couldn't be told if not for the curved tip. A similar one was given to Luna who stood silently beside him with a curious gaze.
Vivian smiled sinisterly as she strode down the hall. She had not meant to eavesdrop on Millicent Bagnold's self-importance, nor did she wish to agree. She did, however, wish to provoke.
"She told me she would be hosting the party at this very house." Draco pondered.
"I bloody well have not."
"I was the youngest, but the most mature." She whispered while stroking his head, "not mature physically or mentally, but capable of reading instructions, listening to the adults, and dissecting situations faster than the results. So when the orphanage fell to dire straits, I went to work. I begged for food on the streets, visited charities as the representative, and fought for second-hand clothes from home to home. There was a crowd of children waiting for me back at the orphanage, and you'll never understand, Draco, what a first-born, a leader, a mother and father carries on their shoulders. Not until you're older."
Amelia Bagnold's eyes flickered to them, and settled on Susan.
"Are you perhaps insinuating that I may be a different Draco Malfoy if I had been raised with my mother?" He asked.
"What is so important about Ron's rat missing a finger-"
Blaise rolled his eyes.
"Right, what's up with that?"
"Perhaps it may please your husband to know the House of Fawley does not associate themselves with other Houses with no prospective nor fundamental standing. For example, one of my other reasons for taking a personal interest in your son is the family's generations worth of survival. Not as extensive as the Blacks, but weathering through two major wars is a notable difference."
"Better yet, is it Ron?"
"There was an entrance past the right reeds once, centuries ago. It was blocked by Albus Dumbledore, in his advice to the Wizengamot, under clauses of instability. Ridiculous, considering how long it stood, but the only reason of sense the Wizengamot believes."
"We?" He asked, leaning forward.
"I overheard someone talking about me. A new professor of Spells. He asked the Headmistress why I was at Durmstrang, and not Hogwarts, when I had years of tradition to uphold. So, I wanted to ask whether this tradition was better for my well-being, or Durmstrang as a school."
"Obviously, Catherine. It is rather easy to lock a fence from the outside."
"No, no, you can't act as if the past conversation hadn't been telling," Draco remarked in his eleven-years-old's confidence, "Aunt Vivian may add a few unnecessary words rarely, but mother would rather throw things. She never tore up walls."
"Then I must impose, as my husband begins his house arrest."
"You act all poised now, but I've seen you without a single inch of that self confidence."
"Neither sounds better." Joheim noted.
"Very well."
He turned furiously on his heels at her mocking and clucked his heels away.
Considering that this was his first interaction with someone around the same age as him, no matter the many older friends he had made in Durmstrang, Draco could admit he was nervous. Not quite, however, apprehensive.
The only fair interest which had caught Draco's eye was the girl who sat in every class as himself and Blaise, not a single one to be missed. From the chain around her neck he had once glimpsed he could only assume she was using a turner, the ministry issued ones of a hour's turn. And because they took every class, because Blaise was often pulled away by his childhood friends, because Draco hadn't established his place within the Slytherin hierarchy, Draco sometimes found himself paired with the girl who was always the last to enter and first to leave.
Vivian slowly angled her foot towards the gates as fireplaces roared to life. It was in indication to leave, although there was much she wished to speak of, and even as they both headed towards one labelled 'South' Vivian could only take notice of Narcissa's freshly worn heel of her boots. It meant anger, by the manner she placed more weight on her heels, perhaps frustration or a temporary loss of composure.
"No, you're not."
The last comment had been directed at Lucius, whose release from house-arrest was happening with the next morning. None had commented on the matter, and none had refused the matter. Like all other events in the flow of time, Lucius' release from his home, which had in fact been the least of his concerns, was nothing but allowing his presence into society. Everyone had turned away from the flock of owls which appeared everyday, looked away at his constantly piling documents, at the gold which still ran.
Taysa's eyes snapped to his, and narrowed. She debated the price of the frenchman's belongings to the galleons on the table, and flicked her wand.
Draco's head snapped up.
The room's inhabitants paused. Draco lurched from his seat.
"Grand-père, Narcissa Black has managed to convince all of the mothers that Igor Karkaroff is more suited with his head on the ground than attached to his neck. You must understand that their eyes would turn to you regardless of your refusal. Then why shouldn't you take this as an opportunity to begin before anyone else in the condemnation of such a poorer man?"
"He is a sensitive, prideful child. What remains unaffected in Hogwarts might end the war. He was bound for England by his third year, Vivian, you've suffered through your decisions before we cannot be the ones standing as witnesses any longer. Resolve this, and pry your fingers off."
"A black hound was sighted leaving Azkaban."
Kreacher was an elf driven to insanity by grief. Sadness, Erlnier had learned, was the most prevalent emotion any human could portray, an emotions which had more expressions than happiness could bring. But such a devastating, destroyed sense of happiness stemmed from loyalty was rare, and the most finest quality.
"Better underestimated than known, Blaise. Can I know the real reason you're here?"
"No, Diggory, shut up!" Higgs shouted as he rushed out.
"It's a hat which has sat on countless heads, it's dirty."
Vivian looked up towards the desk, surprised at her brother's voice, only to find two men pouring over a map which travelled across the breadth of the desk and floor and some more.
"Because I think it might be Peter Pettigrew."
call me professor Vean. I am also in charge of the Quidditch team, a referee, and also happen to teach a few Arithmancy classes. I'm afraid we will not be on any brooms this week, unfortunately, because we're to discuss the scientific details of a broom's manoeuvre, the charms that can or cannot be applied to a broom, and how a broom is made.
"No, I meant. Well, Ron's been talking in my ear and out about some things which are, I get it, unrealistic."
Draco Malfoy's grey eyes flickered over them, nearly black against the closing moonlight. They sat apart in silence, tense. Later, just as the darkness threatened Fred to whisper a spell, Draco's wand vanished, his magic settling into his body. He raised his empty hand towards George, the other towards Fred, as he slowly manipulated his broomstick closer.
"Apparently, Harry trusts Professor Lupin enough. Professor Lupin validated his letter, because, you know, he was one of the Marauders."
"Well, fine." He snapped.
"Isn't it dangerous in Knockturn? Does Mr. Crouch go there everyday?"
Note: A subtle nod to Shanastoryteller’s siat, one of my many inspirations, by the means of Narcissa’s garden.
"Your friend is very capable, I agree."
She wondered.
"I am attempting to refrain from allowing his impulse to drive him headfirst into the position. But I did hope, despite the conclusions he may inevitably come to, greeting his own father would give Erlnier quite the adventure."
"That's not what we're told, we're meant to go to Slytherin! She said so!"
Draco huffed.
"Yes, Miss Vivian."
Vivian rolled her eyes, something she only ever did before her brother, and sat down.
"I tried, Vivian." Fillia responded with mockery laced in her voice.
"Blaise," Draco pronounced, "kill it."
A silent pop was all there was before he was alerted to another's presence.
"-how I caught Peter Pettigrew." Draco finished his first round of explanation.
She didn't glance back at him despite feeling his gaze, but shook out her hair and began to pick it apart strand by strand. Pansy was the one to stand, instead, from a chair pushed to the furthest corner of the fireplace to dry Susan's nails she'd been colouring in great concentration, and shooke out a newspaper she pulled right out of Cedric's hands.
His father nodded once, curtly. The nod was severe, solemn, something that should not have been indicated towards a child. But that was his father's methods, and Draco was lost even more in the acceptance which all but been shouted at his face.
"Does my promise as Draco Malfoy hold any weight to you, Kreacher?"
If Uncle Jason hadn't been sitting on his bed when he stepped out of the bathroom, that was.
She stabbed the knife down.
"You'll be requested," Joheim said as they stepped out of the Reception Quarters, "to oversee minor things, such as initial discomforts about their immediate partner or fist fights which should emerge in a month's time. The title will not be 'redistributed', as you have so put it, and the Pavilion will list you as one of the possible alumni to contact after your graduation for the Pavilion's lessons. But, you're a representative for the Pavilion, not the education sector, hence you won't be living in the Yellow Lodgings."
Draco narrowed his eyes, stared at the two with more attention than he had first walked into the room, and came to a realisation.
Erlnier couldn't, not truly. The house hadn't accepted him, and neither had he. It was lightly warded, but not at all to a wizard's eyes, and the only reason which kept the house from knocking him back on its front steps was Sirius Black' verbal agreement. House elves were a different matter which relied on hereditary magic rather than the house's will, but as someone who carried three hereditary magic with two severely unused, he had less a say.
They peered at their mothers through the window, and their mothers stared in return, until the train began to launch.
"...Sorry. He's just. He's my dad."
She tilted forward dangerously at the edge of her seat during Arithmancy with tension trickling around her every gesture. Straightening herself, she gave him a very sure nod, and continued to write what consisted of her own part of the project, the details of how an overlaying charm of two protego would cause in reaction of consecutive or simultaneous casting. Draco, in fact, hadn't spoke to her much, and the question was the third time he had initiated a conversation.
He fumbled, his knife was in his trunk and his wand was in his pocket.
"I've not heard much from Blaise, but as a favoured student of Durmstrang, you seemed to be most involved in the political sector," Pansy's eyes bore into his, "there are less than brighter student in Hogwarts, but much filthier words exchanged. Rumours, similarly, tend to be exaggerated."
Erlnier felt the chain pool within his palm as Kreacher gently laid its pendant. He wished to rid of it from any contact, because he understood why Kreacher went mad. Hoarding the locket would have accelerated Kreacher's grief as the magic was too raw.
"Don't make me consider that seriously Millicent," Vivian whispered as she opened the doors, "I may actually begin a two-year campaign to extract every soul."
"Her cause of death is still being investigated," Dumbledore spoke solemnly, "but we should all pay our respects."
"I will." Erlnier replied.
"Oh, no, what a thing to imagine." Blaise flat-lined.
The headmaster stood a foot away from her, as any other would have done. It was her requested space, as she always noted in her introductions to classes and other people of all sorts.
