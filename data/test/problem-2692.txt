"Bloody vicious beast," he muttered, waving his arms around in an effort to shoo her away.  A small voice in the back of his mind suggested he could just run, head back into the living room and slam the door shut.  But his pride would not allow it.
of a bad idea this conversation was, but he was already on the slippery path, and Draco had every intention of seeing it through to the end.
Harry winced. He had considered waking Draco before he left, but he hadn't wanted to give himself time to change his mind.  "At the Ministry."
"Nothing ever is."  Hermione smiled sadly.  "But you have to at least try."
Harry's eyes flashed angrily -- he hated when Draco referred to himself like that.  "You weren't," he said stubbornly.  "And I don't give a toss what those idiots think.  Everyone who matters already knows."
"Yes." Harry paused and did his best to ignore the smile Malfoy wasn't trying to hide. "No. Just stop avoiding the question."
Harry snorted.  "It's going to take more than shiny, silver sprinkles to convince me," he grumbled, his arm tiring rapidly.
"Fine." Harry gave himself a visible shake and bit back every sharp retort that sprang to mind.
“No one’s saying you have to do that.”  Hermione’s tone was just sharp enough to show her irritation.  She pushed her chair back and began gathering up their empty plates.  “Just stop acting like he’s the same brat we went to school with.  Do you really think I’d be friends with him if he was?”
"I don't know why you don't ask him," Hermione persists.  "I think you might be surprised with his answer."
"No more work talk," Ron said firmly, with a look that said he meant it. "We must be able to find something else to talk about, surely."
The way Draco said it, and the look in his eyes, caused a shiver to course through Harry's body.  But he gave himself a shake – Diagon Alley, in broad daylight, was hardly the place.  "I can't believe you even have to ask that."  Harry gave his best pout – the one he'd learnt from Draco himself.
Her smile brightened then, turned almost genuine.  “Excellent.  I’m glad we had this little chat.  I’ve no doubt we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other soon.”
Harry felt his stomach lurch for a moment before he remembered reading about Daphne Greengrass's engagement in the
Hermione shook her head, expression full of frustration. "No, I mean he
Harry just giggled madly.
"Silly," Hermione replied, smiling widely.  "I just wanted to see if you were free to have lunch with me.  We don't see nearly enough of each other nowadays."
"Draco!"  It seemed the surprise was mutual.
Hermione smiled and gave a slight shake of her head.  "No, I don't.  Not about the gay part anyway.  The bit about Malfoy, on the other hand…"
"I don't understand."  Harry's not sure if it's the beer or the way that Malfoy's being deliberately obtuse, but this doesn't make sense.  "Why are you avoiding him then?"
Extra Credit
Harry chose to walk home from work that night.  Normally he'd Floo straight from the shop into his living room, but tonight he was hoping that the biting winter air would wake him up, invigorate him for the evening to follow.
"I'm sure," Draco agreed.  "Maybe I should suggest it to her?"
Theo began laughing merrily at this, causing Draco to look more than a little put out.  However, before Harry could enquire as to the source of this amusement, the explanation became self-evident.  The flames sparked into life once more and emitted numerous house-elves -- Malfoy ones, judging from the crest on their tea towels -- each of them carrying boxes seemingly far too large for their small stature.
"You have no idea."  There's an awkward moment's pause then, where they both realise the potential implication of Draco's words.  "I didn't mean…" he starts, more than a little flustered.  "I just—"
"Yeah.  And Draco's told Astoria as well, so that's good too, right?"  Harry looked up uncertainly – he still wasn't a hundred percent secure about this.
It had taken some time before Draco had dared to set foot in the place.  Not because he expected to be struck down, but simply because he didn't feel he had the right to be in such a place of remembrance.  It had been Harry who persuaded him otherwise, who marched Draco there one lunchtime, refusing to take no for an answer.  Now it was a favourite spot of his, and Draco could regularly be found in company, or alone, on one of the garden's convenient benches, book in hand or lost in thought.
Eventually, though, Potter pulled away.  He reached out and snagged Draco's wand off the bedside table and cast a well-practised Cleaning Charm.
were eradicated.
A slow grin curves Malfoy's lips.  "And maybe next time we can make it to an actual bed?"
"Look, I will acknowledge that I may have judged you harshly over the years.  Only
-*-*-*-
"I take it Narcissa wasn't impressed?"
"Draco likes you."
"You're not helping." Harry glared but Hermione remained unrepentant. "I was hoping you could talk some sense into him."
Draco leant forward and placed his glass on the bar alongside Harry's.  "Sadly not.  She was feeling a little under the weather."
Draco looked up in shock.  "What?"
Draco searched his mother's words for some hint of a reproach, a sign that she resented not being the first of her peers to welcome the next generation.  But, as always, his mother surprised him.
Hermione was clearly surprised by his response. "Look, I know you don't want to let Ron down, but he's old enough to take care of himself. And I think Pansy's well and truly caught by now. It's not fair of you to keep leading Draco on like this."
"I'm surprised at you, Harry Potter."  Blaise affected outraged tones before signalling the barman to replace their drinks.  "I didn't realise you were heterophobic."
"Would want you to be happy, too.  However that happens."  She followed this up with another glance towards the door.
“How is your mum?”  Harry might consider his debt repaid, but he would always be grateful to Narcissa for her actions.
Pansy was never repressed for long.  "Does she?  How can she, when no one but you, me, and a very pretty French boy know for sure where your tastes lie?"
now?” Harry wasn’t above being petty when he felt attacked.
"It's hardly
Or maybe they were.
Harry does as instructed, but doesn't quite see the point.  "How is this going to be more comfortable?"  He's okay, but Malfoy is kneeling on the sofa between his knees – which Harry is carefully not thinking about – and he's facing away from the TV.
"The Leaky?"  Harry's gaze dropped to Hermione's outfit.  "I think you're a little over dressed for that.  Come on," he coaxed, "what are you really up to?"
“Yes.” Harry nodded gratefully, relieved he hadn’t caused offence.
"Who else is going?"  Harry asked, playing for time.
Astoria sees his approach before Draco does. Her eyes widen, then narrow, and Harry wants to hate her for the hand she has on Draco's arm. But the look of resignation that finally settles on her face just makes him sad. A few whispered words in Draco's ear and she steps away, eyes carefully avoiding Harry's this time, but her body language speaking volumes.
"But I—"
Draco stepped forward, his eyes filled with a visible excitement that reminded Harry of a child on Christmas morning.  "Severus," he said softly, voice full of awe.
at the same time.  But now that he knew what it felt like, the taste of Harry's lips, the feel of his hands, the hot press of his body...Draco knew he couldn't be without it again.  There was just no way.
Harry's brown creased in confusion.  "Then what is?"
Narcissa nodded, and then turned her attention back to her shopping.  Draco just stared at her in amazement.  He couldn't believe it had been that easy.  Something that had kept him up at night since he was a teenager, that had twisted his insides into knots until he wanted to vomit, and she just accepted it
“Not as such,” Draco replied, drying his hands on the tea towel.  “It turns out that despite his rather illustrious pedigree, he was, shall we say, rather impoverished and looking for a meal ticket.  The idiot thought our Pans had more in the bank than she actually has.  He got quite the nasty shock when he found out.”
Harry opened his mouth to press the point further but the approaching click of heels on the tiled floor cut him off.
“Draco?” Harry mumbled sleepily.  “What’s up?”
Hermione shook her head, a
Hermione huffed, but forbore the rest of her rant.
"Of course I am, Mother.  You know that.  But it is a little unexpected for you to turn up at school, unannounced, on a Thursday evening."
Draco's eyes widened and a feeling he didn't dare acknowledge rushed through him.  "You mean..."
"No." She shook her head. "You're not."
He stepped into the first available lift and headed up to the fourth floor.  When the doors opened and he strode out, Draco spotted a familiar figure dressed in lime green robes.  He'd always rather liked Padma Patil, apart from that one weak moment of Weasley-dating in fourth year.
To forestall the problem, Draco took hold of Astoria's hand, and with his free one, gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder.  If she was in anyway surprised by this avoidance, Astoria's pureblood training kicked in sufficiently to hide it.
**********
"Says you moon over him like a love sick puppy."  Ron looks like the words alone make him feel ill, and Harry makes a mental note to have a chat with Neville on Monday.
"Besides," Pansy continued blithely, "You know Lucius would never hear of it.  My name's worth about as much as yours is right now – there'd be nothing for him to gain from it."
The smile appeared to freeze on Malfoy's face.  "She's over there somewhere," he said, and gave a negligent wave of his hand in the direction of the dance floor.  "Last time I saw her she was discussing wedding dress styles with Daphne, so I made a hasty exit."
"You're no help." He ran one hand through hair that already stood on end, and then spotted the subject of their conversation approaching. "He's coming over. For the love of Merlin, don't mention it."
“Still breathing,” Blaise replied neutrally.
Harry shook his head and smiled again.  "One omelette coming right up." He paused and turned to the others.  "D'you two want lunch as well?  I've got plenty of food in."
"It's nothing to be ashamed of, Harry."  There followed a dull thud as Hermione closed the book – Harry had her full attention now.
Pansy appeared rather gratified.  "See," she said, jabbing her finger in Draco's direction.  "That's how you show gratitude.  You could stand to learn some manners from this one."  She nodded at Harry as she finished.
"And now?" Harry knows the answer, can barely force the words past the lump in his throat, but he needs to hear this.
"Oh." Ron relaxed, visibly relieved, before a frown marred his face moments later. "But hang on, where the hell am I going to find someone daft enough to spend time with Malfoy? Willingly? Never mind that he wouldn't give the time of day to anyone I know."
"He's Ron's partner, Harry.  And he's
Draco noticed and didn't seem to mind. Not if his smile was anything to go by. "Don't worry; I'll still be here when you get back."
He had yet to speak to his mother about what was to come – confessing to Astoria had been more than enough for one day – but a part of him suspected it would not go as ill as he had once expected.
"What?" Harry asked.  "You think there's more to it?"
And if he chose, in a quiet moment, to imagine that he and Draco were actually a couple celebrating the holidays together rather than just friends, well, he wasn't doing any harm.  Draco would never have to know, and the idle daydreams gave Harry many a happy nights' sleep.
"Bedroom," he said again, and then stifled a moan as Harry slid warm hands under his shirt and blunt fingernails trailed over his skin.
So Harry waited some more – he'd already managed two days, one more evening wasn't going to hurt.
"Ron, just your family alone qualifies as a crowd."
Harry wasn't at all surprised to find Ron there, wearing a path as he paced before the fireplace. "Harry!" He came to a stop. "It's not true, is it?"
"Indeed," Draco agreed.  "The Weaselette does live in this complex."
Evidently Draco took pity on him, because the next time Harry peeked through his fingers, the room was a much more friendly hue.
Harry paled but was distracted by an excited squeal from the other side of the room.
Harry was hardly one to judge, however.
He shifted uncomfortably. "Is everything—?"
she would.
"Yeah," Pansy chimed in.  "Don't do anything we wouldn't."
Harry knew Ginny well enough to know that she was playing her brother like a finely tuned instrument.  Ron, it seemed, was not so attuned to his sister's wiles.
for tomorrow.”
of theirs certainly do wonders for a nice arse."
Harry turned round and gazed at Draco, who was lounging against the nearby worktop.  His robes lay draped over a nearby chair.  "Huh?"  It was an effort not to stare at Draco's forearms.
For a brief moment an icy fear gripped hold of Draco.  He didn't dare open his eyes for fear of what he wouldn't find.  But then he gave himself a mental shake.  This was Harry, after all; he wouldn't just leave.
Harry nodded in the direction of the portrait at the same time as its occupant released a whispered, "Draco."
"Uh, Ron," Harry prompted when his friend made no sign of moving.
Draco shrugged.  "It's just odd how he's bothered by a portrait."
Harry's heart felt like it stopped for just a fraction of a second as he realised just who he'd run – quite literally – into.  Never one to miss an opportunity, he dived right in.  "Malfoy," he acknowledged as casually as he could mange.  "Do you have a minute?  I want a word."
Harry grinned.  "Not that I'm not always pleased to see you, but what are you doing here?  I thought you were spending the weekend with the in-laws."
"But you didn't—"
George’s eyes gleamed playfully across the table.  “I’m not sure I’d call Pansy a source, but she did get her information straight from the horse’s mouth, so to speak.”
In lieu of a reply, Malfoy took hold of Harry's hand – his
“Poor bloke, my arse, Weasley.”   Harry and Ron looked up as a now fully-clothed Pansy entered the room.   “He was a gold-digging parasite who got what was coming to him.”
"Watch it!"  Harry snapped as he struggled to hang onto the glass in his hand.  A quick look up then had Harry cursing even harder.  He really didn't have the energy to deal with Draco Malfoy right then.
," Snape adds quickly.  "You are not your father, and I acknowledge that now."
Malfoy wrinkled his nose – a response, Harry knew, to his table manners.  "Sounds like fun," he said, in a voice that clearly said it did
"What did you expect?" Harry demanded.  "That I'd wish you both well? Be Best Man at your wedding?  For fuck's sake, Draco."  Harry hit the wall in frustration.  "I was in love with you."
"Almost."  Draco produced the buttonhole with a flourish and deftly pinned it to Harry's robes.  "There," he said in satisfaction.  "Now you're done."
Draco turned around and smiled lazily.  "Didn't anyone ever warn you about sneaking up on an Auror, Potter?"
That got Potter's attention.  He sat forward slightly in his seat.  "What?"
“Honestly, Harry.” Luna gave Neville an indulgent smile, before fixing her gaze on Harry.  “I’m sure you can put the past behind you for one day.”  And there was a note of steel in Luna’s voice that implied he’d better or there’d be consequences.
"Me too," Harry said softly.  "So much wasted time."
Harry didn’t miss the definite flush that coloured Draco’s cheeks, and he was fairly sure that his own were a similar shade.  He tried his hardest not to read anything into the friendly offer.  After all, neither of them had mentioned the hand-holding incident, nor had either of them made any effort to take things a step further.
Normally Harry would have been grateful to hear concern in the voice of his erstwhile rival, but at that point Blaise opened his mouth and Harry realised he'd been given just the opportunity he'd been looking for.
"So?" Harry prompts when nothing more is forthcoming.
Harry laughed breathlessly and raised one hand to push the damp strands of hair back from Draco's face.    But before he could reply, there was a soft rustling noise followed by a pointed cough.
much he and Ron had overheard, but Harry's next words left him in no doubt.  "But your parents are straight, though."
"Yes, but he's—"
to him – Draco was intimately acquainted with the taste of fear, and this definitely was not it – but the looks of disdain, the sneers, the muffled gossip and barely concealed fear was beginning to grind him down.  There had been a time when Draco would have welcomed such notoriety.  That time was long gone.
“So I’m told.” Harry replied.  “It’s just, there’s Luna and Neville, Hermione, and even Ron says you’re okay now.”
"Carry on, then," Harry said, as he curled himself snugly into his seat.
"Come on, then," Harry said as he took the proffered drink and hopped up onto the worktop. "Let the interrogation begin."
"Just Ron," Ginny replied promptly.
"I don't know," he admitted reluctantly.  "It just didn't feel right.  I mean, the garden would be perfect for the kids to play in.  But there's that stream at the bottom that might be dangerous, and all those low doorways."
It wasn't until Harry got home that night and fell into bed, exhausted from the day, that he realised just how much he wanted there to be a next time. And a time after that, too. And not even the sound of Ron's snores rumbling through their adjoining wall was enough to take the smile off Harry's face.
"Is this everything?"  Harry looked around, clearly surprised by Draco's lack of belongings.
~*~*~
"Having fun, darling?"  Pansy strolled into the room as if nothing were amiss, and perched on the edge of the bath.
*~'~*
Harry shrugged.  "It's just taking a little bit of getting used to, and admitting it out loud is…"  His words tailed off here for a moment and Harry raked fingers through his hair once again.  "You've taken it well, though," he added, a slightly sheepish smile on his face.
The pause that followed was awkward at best.  Harry had no idea what to say in response, but at least Ron's attention was now turned to his food instead of pronouncements of truth.
Harry when he was standing right there next to him.  There was little point in Harry avoiding the
before.  He hoped Potter would stay, wanted it even, but Draco wasn't quite sure if he would be able to ask for it.  Fortunately, Potter had courage for both of them.
Draco rolled his eyes, but nonetheless settled between Harry's thighs, and leant back against his chest with a contented sigh.  "Merlin, I need this after the day I've had."
"Gay?"
"Didn't it just," Hermione agreed, sounding equally as discomforted.
"Who is it, Blaise?"
Harry's smile faded, but found himself unwilling to spoil his friend's day.  "I'll think about it," he said.  And judging from the satisfied nod she gave, this was good enough.
Draco’s grip on his cup tightened as he fought the impulse to retort in kind - he was under no illusions about the point Pansy was trying to make.
be dancing this evening, Harry Potter. I spent all last Saturday searching for a dress that did look like something we camped in the New Forest in, and it's
"You okay?" Harry asked tentatively.
“Harry,” Harry corrected.
Harry stills at the familiar voice and the cool slide of Draco's hand in his. He turns his head to the side and the shy smile on Draco's face warms his heart.
They came to a stop in front of the French doors that opened onto their roof terrace.  The doors were ajar and a cold breeze was blowing through them.
"I don't know why you don't say something about them."  Never suppressed for long, Pansy nodded at the empty beds.  "It must be depressing as hell looking at them every day."
Hermione looked up, the corners of her lips tilted in the smallest of smiles.  "Don't worry, Ginny lured Ron off with the promise of Quidditch practice."  She paused here and eyed Harry speculatively.  "She seemed most concerned that he didn't bother you."
"Huh?" It took a moment for Harry's aching brain to process the implications of that remark.  "Oh."  He blushed fiercely.
Draco huffed disbelievingly.
"I thought you wanted to talk," Harry snapped after Malfoy sat there silently fidgeting.
"Just not enough to get hard for them."
"It's fine, honestly."
Before Draco could respond in kind, Harry took hold of his arm and tugged him towards the door.  "Ignore him," he said.  "Luna banished him to the sofa last night, so he's taking it out on everyone today."
"Are you two still close?"
"Maybe he was just waiting to be asked."
"But why you?  Why not his father?  He was the Death Eater in the family."
"Yeah.  Me and Hermione, me and Pansy, I imagine Hermione and Theo." He looked to his friend for confirmation and she nodded.  "In fact," Ron continued, unaware of Harry's increasing panic, "the only people who don't discuss it are you and Malfoy."
Harry was a terrible liar.  He knew that without having to be told.  Which, he supposed, should really be a good thing, but right at that moment, Harry could only wish he'd embraced his Slytherin side more.
Several handshakes later and Mr Worthington was on his way home.  Draco, on the other hand, was on a mission.  A quick glance at his watch told him he had bare seconds remaining before he was due to meet Harry.  And though it was only a short trip across Diagon Alley from Gringotts to Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes, Draco wanted to stop in at his favourite delicatessen and grab some food.  Their crab tortellini was to die for, and Draco knew just how much Harry loved it.
Draco had seen the way Blaise eyed his mother sometimes so had no trouble believing this to be true.  He swiftly strode the short distance between them and lightly kissed her cheek.  "Why are you here?" he asked as he stepped back.
"Well, yes," Harry answered defensively.  "Where did you expect them to come from?"
"Right," Hermione said as Ron's footsteps echoed up the stairs.  "Now tell me what Malfoy said when you asked him."
Draco thought instantly of one such place, but suspected that
coverage.
Briefly, Draco considered returning to the Manor, and climbing into his own bed.  But he quickly dismissed that.  Even if Harry was already asleep, Draco could still climb in next to him, snuggle into his warm embrace.
They both laughed then, like friends sharing an inside joke, and Harry found himself surprisingly okay with it.
"You might want to consider locking your Floo occasionally," she told him primly.  "Anyone could come waltzing in here."
"I don't—"
The smirk dropped from Ginny's face and was replaced instantly by a look of surprise.  "Oh my god."  She shook her head slowly as she pushed away from the wall.  "You're actually serious aren't you?"  Ginny stepped closer, and before Harry could respond, she continued. "I thought you had a hot date or something.  You're
, Draco stopped.
“Hey!” Ron beat Harry to the punch with his protest.
They pulled apart breathlessly, foreheads still pressed together.
think while you're doing that," Harry says, trying his best to keep upright.
"Does he need your permission before he hires someone, then?"
Harry grinned. New though he was to Indian cuisine, Draco had still insisted on matching Harry's meal for strength. Harry'd tried suggesting something milder to begin with, but it seemed the old competition between them lived on.
Harry racked his brains desperately for a believable lie but all his brain could come up with was
"What are they?"  Harry's brow creased with uncertainty.
Harry smiled slightly at this.  Ron might be volatile, but he really did have a good heart, and Harry made a mental note to give his friend the benefit of the doubt more often.  "I really am sorry, you know?  I was still getting used to it myself."
Draco held his gaze for a moment, just long enough for Harry to forget where they were. "Not quite," he said. "But wouldn't it be interesting if I had?"
“I thought we were supposed to be discussing Neville’s stag do, not my love life?”
Harry listened intently for a moment and then began to laugh.
, it had done nothing more than reaffirm his knowledge that Draco was the only one for him - barbed remarks and all.
He looked down at the other end of the table and found that Draco was watching him, a soft smile on his face.  Harry felt warmth suffuse his body at that smile, and he idly fantasised about crawling the length of the table, in front of all his friends, and kissing it right off Draco’s face.
Harry shook his head as slowly as he could.  "Hermione'll have your balls if she catches you doing that, you know."
"Draco."  Apparently tired of being ignored, Astoria tugged slightly on Malfoy's arm.  "I adore this song; dance with me."
He's still for a moment.  In shock.  But it's only seconds before Harry's instincts kick in.  His lips slide, warm and slick, against Draco's, and there's a thrill down his spine at the first flicker of tongue.  He savours the taste of Draco for a moment, before the tang of Firewhiskey hits him.  It takes all of his willpower to pull away, but he has to know.
Struck a little dumb at the sight, Harry stared in lieu of words.  Malfoy, having spotted Harry at much the same time, shifted uncomfortably in his position by the till.  At first, Harry suspected it was embarrassment at being caught in his new uniform, but then he spotted a familiar potion bottle in Malfoy's hand.  What kind of world was it when he had more in common with Draco Malfoy then he did his best friends?
It really isn't fine, and they both know that, but Harry wants it to be – so badly. The problem is that things are so messed up that he doesn't know what fine looks like anymore. He does know that it isn't Draco twirling Astoria Greengrass around the dance floor with laughter in his eyes, though.
There was just the faintest hint of bitterness present, a hint of something Draco had hoped they were long past, or at least had a mutual understanding never to refer to again.  "Pansy, I don't wa—"
"I imagine you think I'm devoid of all feeling, right? Dead inside?"
"Have you no soul?" Malfoy demanded with just a hint of the dramatics that Harry remembered from school. He gestured around him with a flourish. "This is a beautiful period town house, not some mass-produced box lost in suburbia. You can't fill a property like this with flat pack furniture; it's sacrilege."
"Is that everything?"  Draco emerged from the ensuite bathroom, a stack of fresh towels in his hands.
"Where you left me," Harry replied pointedly.  "With your father."
"Oh, come on, Draco.  D'you really think he'd do things like that with you if he weren't in the slightest bit interested?  Why don't you just tell him?  What's the worst that could happen?"
Harry heard a huff, followed by indecipherable muttering.  But just as sleep claimed him, he felt the definite shifting of the mattress and the weight of a head on the pillow next to him.
"You don't need me to tell you that you're both miserable." Ginny steps closer and takes his right hand in hers. "Draco's out there pretending like he doesn't have a care in the world, and—"
They remained like that for a moment, just holding each other in silence – no words necessary – until finally Harry spoke.
#24 Christmas Dinner
Draco pulled his arm back sharply as if burnt.  He focused his eyes everywhere except for the one reminder of his past he still struggled to acknowledge.    "I have a responsibility to my family."  Draco turned his back to Pansy, unable to face the pity he knew would be visible in her face.
Draco gave a slight leer.  "Are you going to be a good boy for me then, Harry?"
Pansy turned her attention to Harry.  “Where’s Draco?  He’s not gone in to work, surely?”
"Say what you like, Potter. This is part of the creative process, and I insist on you leaving?"
"Hermione!"  It took a few seconds for her words to register in Harry's brain, but when they did, he found them even more disturbing from her than Ginny.
It took a moment for Harry to realise that Draco had ceased his preening, and now stood watching him expectantly.  Harry gave himself a mental shake.  “Sorry, what did you say?”
Only Malfoy didn't say anything straight away.  There were no insults or smart remarks, and when he did open his mouth it was only to say a simple "Sorry."
"That's not really for you to decide, is it?"  Harry found it impossible to keep the irritation out of his voice – or he would have, if he'd even tried.
Harry stopped dead in his tracks and shook his head, convinced he was hearing things.  He turned slowly towards the portrait.  "Did you just..."
"When did this happen?" Harry wondered out loud.
Draco bristled.  "I really don’t think—"
"It's fine."  But the slight sharpness in Malfoy's tone says it's maybe not completely.

bed at the Manor wasn't quite what Harry had in mind.  So he held his tongue and followed Harry through the hospital's sanitised corridors.
as George had taken to calling it – to Harry's amusement and Ron's ire.
"Apple?"
"Downstairs. I'll be sure to tell him he was missed."
, it is," Blaise said firmly.  "And you know it."
Just as he's wondering if he should suggest another pint, Malfoy gets to his feet.  "Come on.  Let's go."
Some time later, when Draco had left for his weekly family dinner at the Manor while Harry had desperately tried to ignore the way his flatmate’s robes brought out the colour of his eyes, Ron lay sprawled on the sofa, can of lager in one hand, remote control in the other.
Malfoy watched him intently for a moment, as if to test the truth of his words, and then began speaking softly. "After the war, there were a lot of bad memories in the manor."
"But what about the kids?  I'm not sure Hermione would be happy if one of her children fell off it."
When no answer was forthcoming, Harry began to wish he'd Floo'd in.  Yes, he'd sworn never to do that again, unannounced, after the time he caught Hermione in her underwear – but really, what were the chances of that happening twice?  Harry shook his head.  No, he decided, it just wasn't worth the risk of trauma – on both their parts.  Although he suspected he'd been by far the more embarrassed.
"So I'm told," Draco replied.  "Now get your lazy arse out of bed.  Breakfast will be ready in a few minutes."
"Draco asked me to sort out the garden for you. No point having all these windows when the view resembles a slum. His words, not mine," Neville added hurriedly.
The trick with Hermione was to get it over and done with quickly – like ripping off a plaster.  The longer you left it, the more time she had to expound on her theories, and the more questions she came up with – if he didn't head her off quickly, Harry knew all his secrets would be laid bare before the night was out.   And that was something he'd really rather avoid if at all possible.
"A Weasley jumper?"  Harry asked faintly, already imagining Draco's expression.
Malfoy actually looked offended at this and Harry couldn't escape the twinge of guilt. "I'm sorry," he said hurriedly. "I was only joking. Look, I'll go, but after tomorrow I want my house back."
“So what happened anyway?  Was he cheating on her?”  Harry wasn’t usually one for gossip, but this was the first time he had been alone with Draco all day and he wanted to prolong the moment.
Draco grimaced as he busily resized packing boxes.
"Where did you say you were going again?"  Harry looked up from the comprehensive list of rules and contact numbers that Hermione had provided.  Honestly, he thought, after five years of helping to raise Teddy, he was more than capable of watching Rose for one night.
Pansy just grinned.  "I think it rather suits him."  She stepped back from the door.  "Now, are you coming in or what?"
"I'm sure he could manage that without their help.  It's not like he's ugly or anything."
But Harry followed his direction nonetheless.  If nothing else, Blaise had exacting standards, and any man or woman deemed worthy of his attention was definitely worth a second glance.  This time was no exception.  Harry
Harry paused, spoon full of porridge halfway between table and mouth, and frowned at Ron.  "Nothing.  Why?"
Allowing himself one last glance at Potter, who was now focussed on his own work, with barely a ghost of a smile on his lips, Draco gave himself a mental shake and picked up a new quill.
Draco was smiling when he turned back round to face Harry. He gave a little shake of his head as if despairing of his friend and said, "Maybe next time we should leave those two at home."
Tiny puffs of what looked like soot still coughed their way out of Harry's lungs on occasion – another reason for his brisk walk home in the fresh air.
She turned to leave and Harry was suddenly conscious of the fact it was just him and Malfoy now, and he racked his brain desperately for something to say.  Malfoy, on the other hand, seemed to have no such qualms.  He picked his pint from the bar and gestured to the empty tables.
, Harry!"
"Hmm.  There's another lesson you need to learn."  Draco placed a steaming cup of coffee down on the bedside table.  "You're lucky a sore head is all you woke up with this morning."
“Honestly.” Andromeda shook her head, but she didn’t seem unduly annoyed. “Would you like a tea, Draco?”
The mood falls a little then, and they finish their drinks in silence.  It's not entirely uncomfortable.  If anything, Harry's frantically trying to remember if he's left anything incriminating on show in his bedroom – it's not like he's going to get the chance to hide it now, with Malfoy as his shadow.
Pansy shrugged.  "So?  When the arse is that nice, I don't care
"You joined the Aurors, then?"
"It would seem that way, Potter," Pansy said casually.  "Look at it as an added incentive.  The quicker you get him hanging in his rightful place, the sooner he'll be out of your hair."  She gazed at him critically for a moment.  "Which given its current state, would not be a bad thing."
"Aren't you going to say anything about Malfoy?"
"A few times," Draco said after a moment. "After the war I was like Pansy, wanting to face people down, brazen it out…"
Harry said nothing further.  He buried one hand in Draco's hair and tugged him close, pressing their lips together with soft, but definitely eager kisses.
"I'm fi…" The look in Hermione's eyes stops the lie in its tracks. "You're as bad as Ginny," he says instead, rueful smile on his lips.
“Yeah, well, he might’ve invited you, but if it wasn’t for me you would be sitting down to
"Leave the boy alone, Molly."   Harry breathed a sigh of relief as Arthur entered the conversation.  He accepted the outstretched hand, and subsequent hearty shake.
"Of course we're happy for you, aren't we, Ron?"  Harry gave his friend a sharp kick under the table and grinned slightly as Ron tried to stifle a yelp.
Harry spluttered into his wine.  "There were
"Yes," Malfoy said, almost patiently.  "You.  Where's the lovely lady who accompanied you this evening? "
.”  Hermione’s tone raised a notch and sounded most put out.  “Don’t I?” She turned to her husband for support.
Pansy could have announced she was marrying a Muggle and it would have caused less shock.  With the notable exception of Ginny, all other occupants of the table simply
Pansy flicked through the rail of clothing in front of her.  "And I thought
Harry let out a laugh that was almost relief – for one worrying moment he'd thought the news of his friendship with Malfoy had sent his best friend catatonic.
want to be an Auror," he said finally. "Or at least I think I did. But that was ages ago, and it might have been more about spiting Umbridge than anything."
Draco took possession of the vacant armchair; long limbs hooked over the arm in a fashion that made Harry swallow heavily.  “Whereas you redheads were just built to sun worship, right, Weasley?” he sneered.
"Of that I have no doubt," Hermione replied softly, a slight smile on her lips.  "But intentions aren't always necessary."
.  Hermione and Ron had both told him he was being stupid, that Molly wasn't angry, but Harry was still a little nervous about facing the woman who was like a mother to him.
Harry still hates Ministry galas. Possibly more now than ever. This one is turning out to be even more unpleasant than the last one he'd mistakenly agreed to attend. That had been years ago, just after the final battle, and no one, not Ginny or Draco had been able to coax him back until now. Pregnant women, it seemed, were his Kryptonite. Thank fuck he'd turned out to be gay.
He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to his mother's cheek.  "Thank you," he murmured.  It was for far more than the jumpers, and from the look in Narcissa's eyes, it was clear that she understood.
Harry looked at him curiously.  "Of course.  Why wouldn't he"
*~'~*
Harry frowned a little and looked around them.  A few bottles of beer on very little food meant Blaise wasn't making much sense.  "Who are you talking to?"
Pansy grinned in return.  "Of course you do.  But you don't want to
“Hey!” Ron protested.  “That’s my room.  Where am I supposed to sleep now?”
Both Blaise and Harry started this time, and the amber liquid finally made it over the rim of Blaise's glass.
Draco nodded.  "I know.  Just a shame it's two years too late."
, but hearing Harry Potter address him as Draco for the first time had given him a thrill that was far greater than even his own vivid imaginings could have predicted.
"Nah, day off."  Ron pulled a face.  "I drew the short straw for working this weekend."
"She said no?" There was just a hint of surprise in her tone that caught Harry's attention. Ron, however, was too wrapped up in his misery to notice.
"I can't take it anymore."  Pansy Parkinson, architect of this particular scene, flounced into the 8th year boys' dormitory and flung herself down onto one of the beds.
friend.  If you gave him a chance, maybe he could be yours too."
"It's okay. I know you didn't."  And Harry does.  Once upon a time it would have been very different, but they've both grown up since then.  "Don't worry about it."
“Damn,” Harry cursed.  “We must have left the Floo open again.”
"I didn't realise you two were friends."
"You can't rush these things," Draco said, as he pulled plates out of the cupboard and placed them on the warming pad.  "We live together now.  If it goes wrong can you imagine how awkward that would be?"
"People mostly," Malfoy admitted quietly. "Faces. There's more of a story there than a still life."
"Are you looking for someone?" Draco asked curiously, for it really seemed as if she were.
"Are you asking or telling me that?"
"Ah, well."  Harry looked decidedly guilty.
Harry had been waiting up 'til this point, aware of Draco's trust issues and wanting to let him set the pace. But there was no mistaking the way he was looking at Harry now. He reached out and took Draco's wine from his hand and leant forward to place it on the coffee table. As he leant back towards Draco, Harry went slowly, giving him time to pull away if he wanted. "Tell me if I'm reading this wrong."
But as Harry approaches it becomes apparent that someone has already managed that task, because he can hear voices within the office.  Assuming it to be Neville, Harry gives his usual cursory knock and enters.  Now, either Neville has changed quite drastically in the last half an hour since Harry saw him, or it is, in fact, Blaise Zabini who is occupying a part of Draco's day that Harry guards jealously.
"Pansy!"  Draco flushed; he couldn't help it.  Even after over twenty years of friendship, Pansy's own particular brand of honesty never failed to embarrass him.
There was no disguising the amusement on Hermione's face now either. "And what
Hermione sighed in the long-suffering way that Harry knew she reserved especially for him and Ron.  "Well, it may have escaped your notice, but it's already tomorrow."
"Your turn now," he said simply.
**********
Harry/Draco (Background Ron/Pansy & Hermione/Theo)
"I think it's a great idea." Pansy seemed to have caught Ron's enthusiasm, though Harry didn't recall her being a particular fan back at school. "We'll go, won't we, Draco?"
Blaise arched his eyebrows in response but remained silent.
"Me?" Potter gestured wildly, causing his drink to slosh precariously in his glass.  "How is it my fault?  You're the one who invited us.  And anyway, you said you didn't care."
Malfoy arches a brow, clearly amused.  "Potter, you rebel."
*~*~*~*~*~*
Harry sighed softly; it really was far too early on a Sunday for visitors.  “In the kitchen,” he shouted back in resignation.
"Goodnight, Draco," was all she offered in reply, before heading off in the direction of the girls' dormitories.
Ron flashed a quick look of betrayal at his partner, but given that the delay really was Ron's fault, Harry felt not the slightest hint of guilt. "I'm almost done, sir," Ron added. "I just have to check it through and sign it off. It'll be on your desk in fifteen minutes."
"I see the Canons haven't got any better since I saw them last," Draco commented finally.
"I had some papers to fill in.  And I had to see Kingsley."
“It’s not that ridiculous,” Ron said thoughtfully.  “Part of the wedding tradition, isn’t it? Best man and bridesmaid getting together.”
Harry heaved an exaggerated sigh and turned his attention to the task at hand.  "These are lovely," he commented a moment later.  "Are they new?"
serious," Draco answered finally, and Harry didn't miss the quick glance exchanged between him and Blaise.
much mistaken.
At the sound of Draco's voice, Harry instantly pulled out of Hermione's embrace.  He turned to see his flatmate lounging against the doorframe, looking sexier than it should have been possible for anyone to do in faded tracksuit bottoms and an old white t-shirt.
at him.   “Don’t want you getting wet again.”
Harry shrugged.  "She probably just got the wrong end of the stick.  We went out a couple of times.  He's a nice bloke, but he's not..."
Harry nods.  "Thought you might be ready for a cuppa," he says cheerfully, taking all of Neville's credit.
Ginny made a choked sounding noise that was lost somewhere between a laugh and a sob.  "Don't."  She shook her head slightly.
It was not to be, however, because Harry had made the fatal mistake of not locking the Floo the previous night after Draco's departure.
"How is Severus?" Draco asked as he handed over the plastic tub.
In reply, Pansy simply nodded in the direction of the dance floor.  Harry's heart climbed partway into his mouth at the sight of Draco in Blaise's arms.
"Are you okay, Potter?  You look like you're in pain?"
"Nothing, really." Hermione took an extended sip of her tea. Harry could see the amusement in her eyes as she made Ron wait.
The laugh that followed did little to sooth Harry's renewed irritation. "Draco's okay really."
They're outside the pub in the crisp night air of Diagon Alley before he has chance to ask, "What the hell was that?"
"Yes, as it happens."  Blaise smirked in a familiar, maddening fashion. "Busy working out the department budgets for the next financial year.  So unless you want me to accidentally drop a nought off the end of yours, you'd better be nice."
"I'm sorry," Harry said, and he was.  Of all their friends, he had been the one to spout off most about
Greg Goyle doing here earlier?"
“But it’s Christmas,” Ron spluttered, clearly surprised he hadn’t found a sympathetic audience in Harry.  “What are we going to do Christmas day?”
He was still smiling as Draco got up and excused himself to the loo, and it was still there when Ron and Pansy returned from the bar, drinks in hand.
"But?" Harry prodded gently.
"I see more than Draco does. He's so caught up in loving you that he forgets you're only human sometimes, and that you can't read his mind. You messed up. You
"Of course you are," Draco murmured distractedly.  He brushed his hands down the back of Harry's robes, straightening the fabric.  It took all of his self-control not to press firmly and smooth his palms over broad shoulders and toned back.
There was a loud scrape as Ron pushed his chair back and leant forward over the table. "What did he say?"
Malfoy leant back against the windowsill and gave Harry a long, appraising look. "Let's just say I recognised that you needed a firmer hand."
could fly off anywhere, Harry."  Draco pressed the button and the lift began its descent.   "And it would be great for outdoor entertaining."
"You must be looking forward to it."  Harry counts out the required number of shrivelfig into a jar and smiles warmly at Mrs Morrison.  Mostly they're a wholesale supplier nowadays – Hogwarts and St Mungo's are two of their biggest contracts – but Neville had been keen to retain the smaller, more personal service that
A soft chuckle caught his ear.  Rolling over carefully, so as not to upset the throbbing in his skull, Harry cracked one eye open slightly.  Wincing against the light, he just made out the grinning form of Draco at his bedside.  "Bright," he muttered, pressing one hand over his eyes.
A quick look around told Harry they were home – in the kitchen of their flat.
Narcissa nodded; she was too busy rifling through her purchases to pay much heed.  "Yes, your Aunt Andromeda took me.  It was wonderful – all lit up with pretty lights."  She stilled then and turned to her son.  "Don't tell your father I said that, though.  You know how he gets."
Harry took a deep breath and tried to suppress the smile he just knew his old teacher would not appreciate.  "This is my home."
"They're called levitation spells for a reason, Harry."  Blaise inspected his fingernails casually before adding, "And we both know that if anything's causing you to move like an old man, it's that horrendous contraption you insist on sleeping on."
The looks they'd got on the platform in King's Cross had been bad enough, but the sight of Harry Potter wearing Auror robes (albeit those of a probationer) on platform 9 ¾'s had caused such a flurry of excitement amongst the assembled crowd that they had barely noticed the arrival of the train carrying their loved ones.
really should start getting yourself ready.  Astoria is expecting you at eight."
Nile," Ron corrected, before continuing.  "So maybe Zabini's visit is the perfect opportunity to, you know..."
"Oh, for Merlin's sake, Harry likes
, Harry wanted to point out. But he figured he should probably avoid making Ron’s point for him.  Besides, when Ron started making sense, it was usually a sign that something was wrong.  Not that Harry was willing to accept it was him, just yet.  “Fine. I won’t mention him again.”
Having garnered the information he wanted, Draco felt he could afford a little graciousness.  "Thank you,
Draco's hands were on his waist in an instant, the grip tight as though he feared Harry might change his mind.  "I thought for a minute that you..."  He tailed off into a shaky laugh.
particular scenario was out of the question.
"Come on, Potter.  He's a portrait; how bad can it be?"  Pansy gazed at him coolly from over the top of her glass.
Draco nodded sympathetically.  Truth be told, he was starting to get a little concerned about their lack of success.   "Have a look at these," he said, as he slid a small leather case across the table.
Malfoy smiled.  “Mrs Longbottom was most insistent that I not let Neville choose the wedding robes.”
Harry dropped his cutlery with a
"Aren't you?"  Potter's eyes almost dared him to deny it. Not that Draco had any intention of doing so.
Ron huffed but made no further protest.
Harry took the bag in mute surprise; he knew he was a fairly regular customer, but it was a little odd that the owner was sending him free food.
Harry spluttered a little, mouth full of hot liquid. And from the look on Hermione's face, she knew her point had been made.
restaurant for anyone who wanted to be anyone in wizarding society to be seen in.  "That sounds wonderful," was the only comment he made.
"Gay?" Harry supplied.
is a bit much."  Harry gulps greedily at his coffee.  "Strongly disapproves would be more appropriate."
Harry laughed.  “It’s not surprises you hate, Draco.  It’s the waiting you can’t stand.”
The change of direction caught Harry off guard and he nearly choked on his sandwich.  "What?"
"He's my father."  Despite the failings he had been forced by the war to acknowledge, Draco still afforded his father the respect due to that role.
blokes, no."
Malfoy stilled, glass halfway to his mouth.  "Who told you about that?" he asked carefully.
And that thought makes Harry feel sick to his stomach. Sure, they'd never actually said it out loud, but he'd thought it was felt all the same. If Draco didn't think…No wonder he'd walked away.
A whooshing noise from the Floo interrupted any further conversation, and after what appeared like a tussle in the grate, both Blaise and Ron appeared, bearing numerous bags and cartons.  Seconds later they were followed by Hermione and Pansy.
“We’ll have it here,” he said eventually.  “You and me.  We’ll have Christmas here.”
"Flattery will get you—"
hadn't had the forethought to shrink them.
Harry stifled a sigh and rubbed tiredly at his face.  His own thoughts hadn't given him a moment's peace all day, and now he couldn't even go to his own kitchen without being questioned about his personal life.
Draco chuckled, and yet again Harry marvelled at the changes the years had wrought in his friend.  The Draco Malfoy of old would never have been able to laugh at a joke made at his expense.
business.  Draco knew and understood the reasons behind Harry's reluctance.  Merlin, if the positions had been reversed, Draco was fairly sure he wouldn't have given Harry a second chance in the first place, never mind hopped straight into bed with him.
Harry nods, speech eluding him.  He takes a sip of wine to hide his selective mutism.
"Open your eyes," he said softly.
Once they were all seated, and very polite, but incredibly painful pleasantries had been passed, an uncomfortable air of silence descended over them.
"Don't make a big thing out of it.  I'm sure it's killing him."
Ron's words more than echoed Harry's sentiments at the sight of Malfoy kissing Astoria Greengrass right in front of him.  Harry felt an old familiar clawing sensation fill his chest, and had to resist the urge to tear them apart and claim Malfoy as his own.  Which was ridiculous, Harry admitted to himself, because Malfoy
Luna’s smile turned a little smug. “No harm at all.  In fact, I think you should do rather more than just look.”
“About bloody time, too!” Ron shouted.
Draco grinned.  "Poor baby," he soothed, as he leant over and settled Harry's glasses back on his nose.  "Is the big, bad portrait picking on you?"
"I'll have one of those as well," Potter said without further hesitation.  "Only make mine well done, please."
"You could come back." Harry's pretty sure he's willing to beg. "And stay this time."
"You're actually wearing it."  Pansy stared in surprise at Draco as he emerged from the bathroom.
“I assumed that was for Teddy’s benefit.”
"Favourite?"  Narcissa smiled.  "I know.  I thought that might cheer you up."
"I think it would be best to stay at your place."
"Buying presents for you, no doubt," Molly replied, a fond smile on her face.  "Ron tells me he's quite smitten with you."
no relationship."
"What did you do?" Draco asked suspiciously.  "If you've put him in the attic, I swear—"
couldn’t think of anyone better for the job.”
Pansy Parkinson emerged from the shadows around the house, her face lit by the glow from her cigarette.  "Don't look so worried," she said calmly.  "It's nothing I didn't already know.  Draco couldn't keep a secret to save his life."
Malfoy gave what appeared to be a sad nod.  "I'm afraid so," he confirmed.  "Oh, and his shoulders too, apparently."
The exclamation of disgust was followed by the slamming of the door behind Astoria as she left the office.  Pansy laughed some more, clearly satisfied with her afternoon's work.  Draco was not similarly impressed.
Malfoy rolled his eyes.  "Don't beg.  It's not becoming."  Then he held out his hand in which was a slim blue volume.  "Here."
“But for your own sake, if no one else’s, you need to let it go.  I realise friends might be asking too much.” Hermione gave a wry smile here.  “But would civility really be that hard?”
"But that's over two weeks away."  Draco suddenly felt like stamping his feet.
Even though it's what he wants and wild horses couldn't drag him to Malfoy Manor, Harry still feels a little stung.  He'd expected Malfoy to put up a fight at least.  "Ashamed to be seen with me or something?" he asks, and knows he's being ridiculous – they aren't dating, or anything like it.
"You're not wearing robes."
"You mean he's stopping until the wedding?"  Draco intentionally spoke a little louder so Pansy could still hear him, but even he winced at just how shrill his voice sounded then.
"Me?" Hermione turned her
Malfoy sighed and drank again.  "It's not like I'm blameless though," he admitted with an honesty that Harry would have found admirable if he wasn't so outraged on his behalf.
knew that."
"Still charming your legion of adoring fans, I see, Harry."
"So there's no point in asking if you're up for a drink then?"  Blaise leant casually back against the lockers as he spoke.  The expression on his face was hopeful, but this was one time Harry had no qualms about disappointing.
“Thinking?”
"I won't." Harry glanced down at their hands and smiled softly – whatever her faults, Hermione was a true friend.  "Look, I appreciate the concern, and I'm not saying you're wrong about Draco.  But I'm not going to pine away over some straight bloke I can never have.  I promise."
Harry reached out and took them, glancing briefly at the top one.  "This is for church services," he said sceptically.
As always, thank you to the mods for running this wonderful fest, and for their endless tolerance and patience!!  Thank you to my beta for being available at incredibly short notice several times.  And thank you to   for your endless fandom efforts.  Hopefully this will leave you feeling thoroughly glomped!
Harry blinked hard – he
"Yes, a kitchen."  Draco was rather proud of his patient tone – normally a lack of attention had him bristling within seconds.  And given that the guilty party was Harry Potter, of all people, it was doubly surprising he managed it. "Would you like a modern style or something more rustic? One with space for a table to eat at, or would you prefer a separate dining room?"
The odds of Dean getting punched before the night was out were narrowing by the moment, but fortunately the barman arrived at this point with their new drinks.  Harry grabbed his fresh pint with relish and resigned himself to an evening spent discussing his imaginary sex life with Draco Malfoy.
Draco gave a faint sort of a smile.  "That sounds about right.  She just can't stop herself from meddling, that one."
"Oh, sorry. I just thought…" Neville tailed off, but he didn't
"It'll be important
"She's so looking forward to it," Narcissa said as she placed her hand on Draco's arm and let him escort her from the room.
Harry's eyebrows shot up in surprise.  "So, basically, while I'm watching your daughter, and your husband is at work, you'll be ogling hot men in their underwear?"
He forced a smile onto his face and hoped that he and Astoria were still little acquainted enough for her to believe it genuine.  It worked apparently, because she leant forward as if intent on kissing him, or at best hugging – neither option was particularly pleasing to Draco at the best of times, and certainly not now, when he could see Pansy bearing down upon him, her face twisted with suspicion, or accusation, or something else that meant an equally unpleasant near future for him.
"Is that...?"
"I have.  It's done."
Ron swallows hard and is clearly gearing up to speak, but the sudden appearance of Neville with Draco in tow rather puts an end to the conversation.
Harry laughed.  "Don't try to sidetrack me, Malfoy."  He reached out and tried to peek in one of the bags.
wanting to get into their knickers, you know."  Draco attempted a matching level of lightness in his voice, but even to his own ears he could hear failure.
"Harry doesn't like to bring dates," Blaise answered for him.  "Thinks they'll make him dance."
Malfoy noticed, and simply said "gentle persuasion," as if that explained everything.  And as Harry grinned in response, he thought it probably did.
It was dark when Draco woke.  He knew instantly something wasn't right, but it took him a few seconds to work out what exactly.  A quick stretch and it all became clear – he was alone in bed.  When Draco had fallen asleep, Harry had been wrapped around him like a sleeping cat in its owner's lap – but not anymore.
Harry’s eyes shot to the clock.  He’d been overjoyed the day that Andromeda had pointed to the hand that represented him, and now bloody Malfoy was on it.  With Luna and Neville, Hermione, and now this, it was like the bastard was trying to take over every aspect of Harry’s life.
"What?"
The fates were clearly smiling on him for once, because barely had Harry's back pressed against through stone wall, than the portrait hole swung open and Dean Thomas slid out.  Dean couldn't have looked more shifty if he was hanging around outside hidden under an Invisibility Cloak, and Harry couldn't help but grin to himself as he slid through the entrance in  Dean's wake – clearly he wasn't the only one keeping secrets.
"Felt an overwhelming urge to have me hanging on your wall, did you?"
"Okay," Malfoy said, but some of the confidence seemed to have oozed out of him.  "We can work around that, I'm sure."
"What time are you starting?"  Draco toyed absently with his coffee cup.
"I hope that's meant to be a joke, for your sake, Potter."  Draco folded his arms across his chest and mock-glared at Harry.
Draco slid his grip down potter's arm, until he was gently circling his wrist.  "But
"Don't be sorry."  Draco's aunt actually
A very real knot of fear twisted in Harry's belly at these words, but he squashed it firmly. This was Hermione. How bad could it be? "Okay," he said, and placed his own glass down as well – no sense in breaking her best crystal if it was bad news.
"I'm not even sure we're friends," Harry continued, and it was more like he was thinking out loud now, rather than simply trying to convince Hermione.  "Acquaintances, maybe."
But Draco hadn't been lying when he'd told Harry he needed time to sort things out, to explain to people.  It wasn't as simple as just falling into Harry's arms, however appealing a prospect that was.
"Are you kidding?  You know what Pansy's like when she gets a bee in her bonnet, and for some reason I'm taking the brunt of it.  I'd actually like to have sex again before Christmas."
"Same," Harry replied, figuring it would be churlish to respond with anything other than the truth.
"He went to his death willingly.  Stood in front of V-Voldemort and let him cast the Killing Curse.  Would you have done that?  Because I know I wouldn't have."
"Do you think you'll like living here, Draco?" she asked  casually, but Draco could tell there was clearly more that she wanted to say.
Harry bristled. "I'm quite capable—"
There's a rapidly spread stain on Malfoy's sweatshirt.
Malfoy seemed genuinely surprised at his words. "All you need? What kind of existence is that? Life isn't just about necessity."
"I have to say, you're taking this much better than I thought you would. Pansy and your Weasley," Draco clarified when Harry looked a little blank.
Harry kept watching Malfoy as he replied.  “Yeah, he’s not quite as much of a git as he used to be.”
Harry’s stomach sank as he saw where the conversation was heading.   He followed Pansy’s gaze to where Draco was still with Hermione, only now he was frowning slightly in their direction.
~*~*~*~
It's on the tip of Harry's tongue to point out that Hermione isn't his boss or his mother, but instead he goes for another slice of toast.  Or he tries to, rather, because Malfoy has raised his mug for a drink at the same time and the bond will only stretch so far.
**********
do then?"
“Maybe you could what?” he encouraged gently.
"He's doing a convincing job of it," Harry mutters bitterly. Because he's looked a few times – he's had to – and Draco's smiling at Astoria the way he used to smile at him.
"Pansy."  Harry nodded, giving the tender spot on his ribs a quick rub.  "I have no idea where Ron is, if that's what you want."
“Fuck off!” Dean was lucky he was out of reach, because right then Harry was very tempted to smack him in his smug face.
"Start what?"
Draco’s eyes narrowed slightly.  “Potter—”
Harry sat back in his chair now, hands gripped firmly on the arms.  "No," he said.  "I'm not... I don't want anyone messing around in my head."
Draco spluttered here in what he felt was righteous indignation.  "I most certainly do not."
"Name one time."
Harry joined him. There was something freeing about admitting the truth out loud. And Malfoy was far enough removed from the situation as to make it easy.
"No."  Hermione blinked furiously and then scowled.  "And never mind about me, what about you?  When are you going to start telling people? Draco's made the first move; it's your turn now."
"Then tell him," Pansy suggested.  "Blaise is a lot of things, but he's a reasonable bloke.   I'm sure if you explained to him—"
“He’s an idiot,” Pansy replied with a sigh.  “Always has been where Potter is concerned.”
"I bloody well can.  She raised him like that.  Her and her husband.  They've only got themselves to blame."
When a shadow fell over Draco's parchment, he looked up with no small amount of shock – visitors rarely stayed long enough for contact to take place.
Hermione beamed proudly at her daughter, before turning a pointed gaze on her best friend.  "And you might want to do it quickly.  I can't get her to stop doing that, and even Ron's going to work it out eventually."
“Not on purpose,” Ron agreed.  “But I’m not sure you can help yourself where Malfoy’s concerned.”
"Schedule?"  Harry repeated, his brow creased in confusion as he hung up his coat.  "What schedule?"
Today, the addition of a second couple was making that a little harder.
"Don't stand there gaping, boy. Come in and close the damn door."
"And you're still bringing whatshername?"
Draco shook his head and made a strange sort of clucking noise with his tongue.  He did, however, manage to hold back a disparaging remark about
Harry's jaw dropped momentarily at her audacity.  "You
"Pansy only wants me there so she can try to fix me up with that dreadful cousin of hers again."  Draco makes a grab for the remaining biscuit when Blaise's eyes wander in its direction.
“I know.” Ron nodded, sage like. “’S’what makes it so perfect.  You’re gay, and Malfoy’s a bloke. And gay.”
"I've got to go," he said, somewhat redundantly, before picking the case up off the table.  "I'll owl you about these."
Draco scowled in response and added, "I came to see Harry."
"Actually, no," Pansy admitted.  "I've seen a couple of George's, and you definitely got off lightly."
"Still, we're supposed to be having a
Ron laughed outright this time.  "Just be grateful she can't manage ferret, yet."
Letter finished, Pansy sank down onto the nearest bed and slowly raised her wand to cast the counter charm.  Before Draco could voice his anger at the perceived violation, she looked up at him, sadness evident in her eyes.  "You're not seriously considering this?"
Blaise grunted something that could -- barely -- pass as a greeting, then put his cup down forcefully and eyed his friend.  "I don't suppose you've got room for another body on Christmas Day?"
Harry grinned.  “You’ll see. Come on.”
“I know you’re not close.”  Andromeda’s wry smile indicated she knew just how much of an understatement this was.  “I just thought...with the wedding?  You’re both playing rather key roles.”
Draco shrugged.  "It's a Muggle thing, apparently.  Granger's contribution to the decor."
Not that he thought Harry would mind – especially not with the bottle of wine and Chinese takeaway he came bearing, but considering his hopes for the evening ahead, Draco felt a slightly more formal approach was called for.
in response and slid another hook in place. "So do you have plans in general? Or have you abandoned your Auror career so you can mooch about this house watching me?"
"Not as much as I'd like to," Harry said ruefully. "I catch it on the WWN sometimes, but it's not the same as actually watching it, you know? But with the shifts I end up working, I rarely get a chance to see a match."
“What colour do I get?” Harry took his seat on the floor between the two of them – he could only imagine Hermione’s expression if she could see him right at that moment.
"It means I hate you." Harry pushed back his chair and got to his feet. "But if you come back now and actually write up the Roker report like you were meant to this morning, then I'll think about it."
spit in his food, but he'd be happier not to have to put it to the test.  Swinging his legs over the side of the bed, Harry buried his feet in a pair of fluffy, red slippers, and tried his hardest not to be distracted by the tiny gold snitches zooming around on their surface.
Harry shrugged. "I didn't know what else to do. Besides, everyone kept talking about me following in Dad and Sirius's footsteps, and I just…"
"Look," Hermione took hold of Harry's hands with her own and held them gently.  "I know you have feelings for Draco; I'm not blind.  I just want you to be sure you're doing this for the right reasons.  The last thing I want is you getting hurt."

“You like the idea then?” Harry asked, relieved by his friend’s enthusiasm.
He just had to make sure Hermione didn't find out.
Despite himself, Harry couldn't help grin at this.  "Then what can I do for you?"
“Huh.” Draco took another sip of his wine.  “Only under protest.”
Even more surprising was the touch of her wand to the wrought iron, and the creak as they opened.
"No, no, not her."  Pansy gave a dismissive wave of her hand.  I meant Potter.  I had a most interesting conversation with the female Weasley earlier."
"Not sure about friends, exactly," Neville replied. "But he puts a fair bit of work my way, and we get on all right."
Harry nodded.  “Exactly.  I mean, it’s
Harry looked up from his desk in time to see a red-faced Head Auror making his way over to their desk.
"Master Harry is late."  The accompanying glare was baleful.  "He will have to hurry if he is to keep to his schedule."
"Come on." He grabbed half the plates from Draco's pile. "You don't want to test Hermione's patience this evening, trust me."
Pansy laughed at this.  "Don't worry, no one saw.  You're cold, heartless bastard reputation is safe for now."
"Honestly, Harry, don't be so miserable.  You're starting to sound just like Ron did when we were dating."
#21 Outdoor Christmas Tree
Harry watched in open-mouthed surprise as his hallway became a hive of activity.  George and Ron Levitated the tree into place at the foot of the stairs, Kreacher was despatched to the Manor for decorations, and Draco returned his attention to the garlands of evergreens he had been dressing the banister with.
Harry was silent for a moment while he digested this piece of information.  Draco knew the exact moment his point had been understood, because of the laughter.  Harry leaned across and ruffled his hair. "Poor Draco," he soothed.
"There's no need to do that, surely?"  Narcissa turned to face him, eyes wide with an innocence Draco knew had no place on her face at that moment.  "I wouldn't want you to miss all the fun on my account."
and sank down gratefully onto the soft cushions.  Propping several of them behind his head, Harry raised lifted his feet off the floor as well, and settled down for a relaxing afternoon.
"Bloody hell!"  Neville stumbles and clutches the full mugs in his hand for dear life.  "What on earth are you doing?"  He kicks an offending bag of fertiliser for good measure.
"Positive."  Harry's defensive body language was back, and it was clear from the expression on his face he wasn't happy with the conversation.
"Underwear," she replied, with a brief nod to the far side of the shop.  "I need new underwear."
Harry grinned and kissed him again.  "Then you'll understand why I have no intention of waiting any longer."
Before he could reply there was an insistent tugging on Harry's sleeve.
Ron gave a mock shudder.  "We'll have Friday night drinks round at my place this week, then?"
Malfoy smiled then, much to Harry's surprise.  It was an expression he wasn't used to seeing on Malfoy's face, and certainly not directed at him.  He thought he could get used to it.
Blaise had slid off his stool by now and was making his way over to the window, glass still in hand.  "It all looks very romantic out there.  Can I take this as a sign that you're finally going to talk to Harry about things?"
it from the bedroom, but his mother was unlikely to be impressed with the ensuing hole in the door.
"What about you?"  he asked, taking a gulp of coffee that he hoped would ease his headache.  "George got you playing guinea pig again today?"
It was Harry’s turn to flush now; he’d never been that comfortable with compliments.  “I’ll make sure things aren’t awkward between me and Gin either.  Just because we’ve broken up, no reason we can’t get along for your big day.”
~*~*~
"Exactly." Pansy placed her glass on the table and eyed Harry with a severe expression. "If you hurt him, Potter, you'll be talking in a very high voice for the rest of your life."
Curiosity roused, Harry held up his hands in a placating fashion. "I'll be good. Promise."
"Bloody hell!"  Harry pressed one hand to his chest.  "You frightened the life out of me."
Auror Kettlewell's definitely fighting a grin this time, and not very successfully.  But Harry's more distracted by the feel of Malfoy's breath on his neck as he murmurs, "Which one d'you think we'll be?"
Snape ran a hand distractedly through his hair, which, Harry noticed, didn't look either as lank or as greasy as it had in real life.  "Potter, why on earth—"
Draco promptly slung one arm around Harry's shoulder and pulled him close.  "And a two-headed one at that, Weasley," he chipped in.
Even the years spent at the Burrow, whilst full of fun and good food, had never quite hit the mark.  Something was always missing, and he'd never quite shed that feeling of being a guest, of not quite belonging.
Which was quite laughable, Draco thought, when her expression clearly said otherwise.
"I put a few bits up," Harry protested.
"I don't think—"
Harry isn't particularly vain, but after a morning's manual labour he knows he must look a fright.  And now Draco seems to be a permanent fixture once again, Harry's work wear has had to return to the more practical of his clothes out of necessity.  He is wearing the jeans that Hermione said made his arse look good, though, so with a deep breath he heads across the yard.
"Pot roast for dinner next Saturday," Hermione answered promptly – she'd clearly come prepared.
"I don't think," Draco snapped, more than a little irritated with the conversation.  He was doing his best not to think about Blaise and Harry, or about the prospect of seeing them in each other’s arms on the dance floor later that night.  "I know."
But Harry was paying little attention – he was too busy flipping his way through the clean, white pages, his eyes wide with wonder.  "Thank you.  This is…I mean…"
-*-*-*-
Harry looked up in surprise to be met by the concerned expression of Tom the landlord.  "What?  No."  Harry shook his head emphatically.  "We were just talking."
There was a loud clink as Pansy’s cutlery was swiftly dropped.  “That’s it.  I can’t eat this swill.”  She pushed the tray away and scowled at Draco.  “I said we should have gone for sushi, but oh no, someone couldn’t bear to miss out on the chance to ogle Potter some more.  As if seeing him over the breakfast table
Harry remained silent for a moment.  He'd wanted to say this out loud for some time now, but he was scared of what would happen once he did.  But of all people he could trust Hermione not to overreact.
"I didn't plan to," Draco said, before taking a sip of his water.   "After the war there were a lot of pureblood families who couldn't afford the upkeep on their homes anymore – supporting Voldemort didn't come cheap."
"Normally rumours have me down as some kind of crazed killer," Potter replied matter-of-factly.  "If me having a boyfriend is the worst thing anyone can come up with, well, like I said, it could be worse."
"Are you sure?"
“Not sure,” Draco replied honestly.  “Something woke me.”  He tried his hardest not to focus on the feel of Harry’s breath ghosting over his skin.
Just as with the Welcome Feast in his school days, Draco always ate too much at Christmas.  Even before sitting down to the main meal he had consumed vast amounts of Honeyduke's finest chocolates.  Draco had quite a sweet tooth anyway, but when it was Harry feeding them to him, he was hardly going to say no.
to ask.
The woman turned to smile at Blaise, but her expression froze when it landed on Harry. He could hardly blame her, Harry supposed.  The idea of Draco Malfoy describing Harry Potter as an
"Fine."  Hermione huffed.  "I'll be at the Leaky."
"I'll remind you of that when I'm nursing a broken leg," Harry replied gloomily.
Gloomy house.
Harry followed her into the kitchen and hopped up on the worktop. When his swinging feet banged loudly against the cupboard beneath, Hermione glared.
Draco blinked.  That his question had garnered any answer at all was surprising, but the level of detail offered rendered him temporarily speechless.  His thought process, however, still functioned fine.
Draco chose to ignore the sarcasm and simply pushed the door to enter.  Even the tinkle of the door bell as it opened was enough to set Draco's taste buds tingling, never mind what the wonderful chocolately aromas did to his already-rumbling tummy.
They both laughed then, and Harry felt something relax inside him. Right up until he heard the loud slam of the front door. He looked from the kitchen door to Ron in alarm, and then burst out into the hallway. Draco's coat was gone, and Harry knew without looking further that so was its owner.
"For Merlin's sake, spit it out before I die a second time."
Harry barked out a laugh at this despite himself.  “He’s really not.”  He paused for a moment, allowing a thought to form.  “It’s weird, hearing you talk about him like you’re friends.”
After all, he had months before he had to worry about any of that.
Draco was busily divesting Harry of his cloak but this stopped him in his tracks.  “How did he take it?”
“Wait.”
Harry almost chokes on his tongue when he hears this, and if she weren't out of reach, he would be kicking Hermione right now.  Draco doesn't seem particularly phased though.
Blaise let out a low chuckle.  "How romantic.  Did you skate around hand in hand?"  Draco fixed him with a meaningful glare that Blaise chose to ignore.  "Was Potter aware he was on a date?"
Draco's head thudded against the wall but he barely noticed it because Harry's hand was on his cock, on both of their cocks, pressing them closely together, and the tentative, awkward strokes were better than even the most exotic of his fantasises.
"That doesn't make any sense." But then it did, and Harry could feel the heat rise in his cheeks again. "I don't…That's ridiculous."
Eight years of friendship
Malfoy stepped unsteadily from the fireplace.  His tired expression flitting to one of gratitude when Harry held out an arm to steady him.  "You heard then?"
“Dance with me?  I’m told it’s tradition – Best Man and Maid of Honour.”
Harry moved his gaze away from the sofa over to where their Christmas tree now dominated the room.  He'd been sceptical at best upon seeing the tree that Draco wanted.  But much cajoling and threatened sulks had him acquiescing in no time at all.  Now, as he ran his inexpert eye over the ornament-laden branches, Harry was forced to admit that Draco had done an amazing job.
“Is he really?”  Malfoy looked at him curiously and Harry tried his hardest not to squirm under the gaze.
"Since I was a child. I find it helpful to have something to lose myself in."
"You don't believe me?"
"You can say her name."  Harry tried to keep the exasperation out of his tone.  "It's been months now, and I'm not in bloody mourning!"  It was Harry's turn to look guilty then, but as he opened his mouth to apologise, George waved him off.
Harry looked at him incredulously.  "That's not a
Draco guided them right into a bright, large room with wooden floors and a wall of glass at one side that slid back to give entrance to the terrace beyond.  Harry turned to Draco, eyes wide.
"Maybe," he said slowly.
Harry watched for a moment, taking in the way the snowflakes clung to Draco’s eyelashes, and slowly tracing his thumbs along his cheekbones.  “Not like this, I hope,” he teased, leaning in and nuzzling against Draco’s neck.
"I don't see what the problem is?"  Pansy whisked back the curtain and stepped outside in the first of the chosen outfits.  "I thought you and Blaise used to be close."
best friend. It wasn't quite the final straw, but it was close enough.
And it wasn't just the tree.  There wasn't a part of the flat that had escaped Draco's attention, except for the bathroom, and Harry wasn't entirely convinced that wasn't next on the list.
"No." Harry shook his head and took a few steps closer. "I don't love you, Draco," he said softly.
Harry was still staring at Malfoy, though, and had no idea what the interior of his new home looked like. So he tore his gaze away to take in his surroundings.
“I wouldn’t—”
"Draco will see you now," she said pleasantly.  "Can I get you anything before you go in?  Tea? Coffee?"
He barely had time to mutter a "thank you" before speeding out of the door, and hurrying the few short feet to his final destination.
There was a flurry of loud exclamations in the wake of Hermione's pronouncement.  Harry, for his part, fixed her with a glare.  "We did not."
“I was with my friend, Luna.  You remember her, right?  She was at my birthday party.”
"The camera's broken." Harry remembered vividly the sickening crunch when he'd dropped the box – the shattered casing an uncomfortable metaphor for the state of his life at that time.
The familiar flush of anger and frustration rose in Ron's face. Harry suspected an explosion was inevitable. "Waste of time?" he demanded. "What are you talking about?"
"How's she doing?"  Harry struck up a strange kind of friendship with Narcissa Malfoy after the war, something he can only hope to achieve with Draco.
"I could say the same to you," Ron retorted instantly.  "Isn't it about time you disappeared off somewhere on
Something truly strange was happening – Draco was convinced of it.  Because instead of the scowl he'd fully expected to receive, Potter just wore a rueful grin and gave a shake of those damnable shaggy locks.
"I'll hex the little shit.  Who the hell does—?"
The journey was made in silence and it was possibly the most uncomfortable few minutes of Harry's life – every moment spent waiting to be rebuked for his actions. By the time they arrived at the main doors, none had come, and Harry was perplexed by the whole situation.
Harry blanched slightly at the implication of Hermione's joke.  "You don’t' think he really will, do you?"
"Harry, there you…oh!"  Granger bustled around the corner, the pre-requisite stack of books in her clutches.
Before he could question what she meant, Teddy repeated his earlier actions, only on his grandma this time.  “Is it Cousin Draco?” He bounced excitedly as he clung to her legs.  “Is he comin?”
"Be my guest."  Draco pushed the plate towards him – he'd really only bought it because Harry had.
They might not be friends exactly, but Harry
Ron read aloud, clearly expecting this to explain everything.
"Someone looks like they had a late night."  Hermione emerged from the flames, a grin on her face and a squirming toddler in her arms.
"Oh, no.  Don't think you're just chucking some money at me and then leaving me to do all the hard work.  You
"And don't even
Harry shrugged this time, and didn't bother to admit he'd opened the bottle within minutes of hearing the news.  He wasn't quite ready to examine the extent of his concern just yet.
"It safe to come in yet?" he asked, a wry smile on his face.
Harry grimaced at the reminder.  His plans needed some adjustment in the face of Neville’s reluctance.
"I didn't mean to the first time. I was just…I didn't…" Harry scrubs one hand tiredly over his face. "I have no idea what I was doing."
"You promised we would dance, but I've barely seen you all evening."
Draco didn’t seem to see anything out of the ordinary, though.  He sat back in his chair and chewed thoughtfully.  Harry, meanwhile, could still feel the ghost of Draco’s touch on his hand.
They made it as far as the Entrance Hall before Malfoy stopped in an alcove just near the main doors.  He opened his mouth to speak, but Harry beat him to it.
"Honestly, Ron." Hermione shook her head impatiently. "No one's suggesting you enter a ménage a trois with Draco and Pansy. What Blaise meant is that you need to find someone for Draco so he's not alone, and then Pansy won't feel guilty about being with you."
"Don't be shy, Potter."  Pansy leant forward a little in Harry's direction. "Someone should appreciate them, and they're clearly wasted on Weasley if he's conducting a torrid affair with Draco."
"Malfoy's not even gay!"  Harry blurted the words out before his brain had the chance to process the implications.  But he wasn't used to Hermione responding in such a manner, and manipulation or not, it had him rattled.
Draco rolled over slowly, cracked open one eye, and then wanted to laugh out loud at his own stupidity.  There, silhouetted against the moonlit window pane, was Harry, only a sheet covering his naked form.
As if reading his mind, she smiled slightly. "I think we can trust you not to make off with the family silver."
Harry barely had to fake the wide-eyed surprise.
"I should get going."
Draco snorted.  “Trust me, where Pansy’s concerned, this is early.”
Harry rubbed tiredly at his face.  "I don't know what you're getting at."
"In that case, I'd be honoured."  Draco burrowed deeper into Harry's embrace.  He'd never felt more grateful for a second chance in his life – not even the one he was given after the war came close.
"Talk to him."
Blaise's laugh is deep and hearty.  "There you are then.  You'd make a lovely pair.  Plus, imagine the tongues it would set wagging."
"Oh."  Harry didn't miss the way Draco's face fell at his words, and when his friend stepped back as if to leave, Harry reached out and grabbed hold of his arm firmly.  "I..."  He took a deep breath.  "I meant you," he said determinedly.  "You promised to save me a dance."
“Sorry I’m late.”
Harry's stomach clenched unpleasantly – again at the mention of Malfoy's name, but this time mainly fearful anticipation of Ron's reaction.  "Don't talk daft," he muttered.
"You don't like me."
"That was lovely, Hermione. You'll have to let me have the recipe."
"Just as worthless as your father!"  Snape came to a halt and blinked in surprise at the sudden light.  "Ah, Draco," he said finally, "I didn't realise you were here.
"We're under surveillance, I see," he murmured, with a discreet nod in Molly's direction.
"I'll take off the spell if you can hold your tongue.  This is
Draco still looked uncertain, but Harry was tired of waiting. He'd spent weeks, months imaging the numerous ways this moment could play out, and he'd never been more certain of anything in his life.
"You might enjoy thoughts of Ron getting a large portion, Malfoy."  Harry's eyes glinted with amusement as his sipped from his glass. "I'd prefer to be able to sleep tonight."
It didn't.
Ron turned back to the TV and resumed his channel surfing.  “I was just saying,” he muttered.  “Forgive me for thinking you’d be interested in my life.”
Ron grabbed a sausage from Harry’s plate this time, and narrowly avoided being speared by his best friend’s fork.  “They won’t be here for Christmas day,” he declared, his voice slightly muffled by the mouthful of food.
"On what, exactly?"
"I remember this place," Malfoy comments as Harry pushes open the front door.  He peers inside.  "Looks a lot different now, though."
"Well, you were wrong," she says simply. "You tried to hide part of your lives away from us, and I know you thought you were protecting him – from us, from the public – but I think you just made him feel like you were ashamed."
Harry grinned in response, and as if to bear out the truth in Draco's words, Pansy's strident tones soon echoed through the flat.
Ironically, for someone whom everyone had thought of in their school days as cold and unfeeling, Draco was actually rather demonstrative.  Harry had learned that though the Malfoys portrayed a reserved front in public, in private they were surprisingly loving.  It was this revelation, more than anything else, which had helped Harry come to terms with Draco’s family and their history.
"It's perfect, isn't it Nev?"  Ginny gushed.   "It couldn't be better if I'd designed it myself."
Malfoy stepped a little closer, his brow creased with a frown.  "I've handled this badly," he said finally, before raking one hand distractedly through his hair.  "What I said, about it being a mistake – that wasn't true."
"She's got a point," Ron chipped in before turning his attention.  "Harry?"
"Auror." Harry replied, like this explained everything. Truthfully he'd wheedled it out of Ron the day before, planning to casually drop round at some point over the next weekend. But now didn't seem like the right time to mention that.
"He does not."
"Talk?"  Pansy raised one eyebrow disbelievingly.  "Is that what you kids are calling it nowadays?"  She paused and gave Draco a sly wink.  "Just don't forget the lube."
He burst from the Floo and strode quickly across the room, straight to the drink's cabinet.  Once in possession of a large Firewhisky, he took several deep breaths.
"You could at least pretend you want to be here."
"I don't know what you're talking about," Harry replied stubbornly, turning his gaze to the bare tree.  "I suppose he's still coming tomorrow?"
"I can't believe you didn't tell me." Harry's mind is racing with the possible implications of this news, and he has to fight the very real urge to shake Neville hard and demand to know what it all means.  He still has enough rein on his senses to know this would be a bad idea.
"They're just friends," Harry said, and he knew he was saying it more for his own benefit than anyone else's.
When they landed, Harry was quick to look round and take in his surroundings.  It took a moment for it to register, but then he recognised a nearby building.  "This is where Ginny and Neville live."
Before Draco could cut his own piece, Harry loaded his own fork and held it over the table.
Draco grinned.  “I’m making no promises, Potter.”
Harry didn’t need to be told twice, and he let out a groan of pleasure as the rich chocolate flavour burst across his tongue.
Only Malfoy had apparently taken it upon himself. As the door opened, Harry could see that the walks had been scrubbed and cleaned and painted a bright white. There was also a desk and chair, and a large storage cabinet, which Harry found very odd as he already had the study upstairs. But one look at Malfoy showed him so pleased with himself that Harry didn't want to disappoint.
Blaise shrugged with affected nonchalance.  "You know me, any excuse to get dressed up.  Besides, the brownie points this will earn me with Pansy later are more than worth the effort."  Blaise finished up with a distinct leer which left Harry in no doubt as to his meaning.
"What do you know?" Cutlery clattered onto the plate as Ron gave her his full attention.
"I don’t see why not," he replied,  with quick glance at Theo who shrugged helplessly.
Harry grinned proudly for a moment.  "So what do you have planned for tomorrow, if it's not
Hermione crossed her legs and made a small production of settling her robes. "Wouldn't it have made sense for me to send Pansy up here if that was true?"
"Hermione!" Patience had never been Harry's strong point. "What's that supposed to mean?"
"Oh."  Malfoy expression fell, and his posture followed suit.
They shuffled their way along the counter to the till.  "I'll get these," Draco said, taking Harry's from his hands.  "My treat."
“What?” Draco repeated.  “You’re actually serious about this?  You really want to spend Christmas day eating stodgy pizza, drinking fizzy piss that’s masquerading as lager, and watching het porn with the Weasel?  Can you say the words
Harry didn't reply. He couldn't. In fact, he was pretty sure that he'd swallowed his own tongue at some point in the last minute.
Not even Pansy's ceaseless babbling about Millicent's latest
"Charming," Draco muttered, buttering himself another slice of toast.  "I was going to say you were welcome to join us Christmas Day, but I think I'll take it back now."
Harry makes a noise of displeasure when Draco pulls back, even if it is the shortest of distances.  And he settles his hands firmly on Draco's hips, determined he will go no further.  "Well," he murmurs, nosing his way along Draco's jaw.  "The hat did want to put me in Slytherin."
"It's Harry, please."
He didn't flush. Wouldn't give her the satisfaction. He just gave her a look that promised dire retribution. "Some of us like to look our best," he replied as loftily as possibly, and didn't miss the considering look that Potter gave him.
Harry reluctantly crossed the threshold into the Burrow.  This was the first time he'd visited since his and Draco's very public
.  Instead, he'd spent several hours on an outdoor ice rink watching Harry do a passable impersonation of Bambi on ice.
"It makes my skin greasy, and it gives me
Yet whilst Potter seemed instantly to lose himself in his work, Draco's mind seemed unable to focus on anything other than his
"You did." Harry walked in and let the door close behind him with a bang.
A loud, derisive snort filled the hallway.  "Zabini?" Snape demanded incredulously.  "You think he and Potter are...?"  Snape tailed off, clearly not willing to put such a thought into words.
Draco glanced down and scowled at his offending fingers, but before he could rebut Pansy's accusations, he saw she had all the evidence she needed right there in her hands.  "That's private," he snapped, and reached out to snag the letter from Pansy's hands.
As he slipped his way down the surprisingly busy alley, Harry finally caught sight of his destination and his stomach rumbled in anticipation. Cake testing wasn’t the typical duty of a best man, but with Neville stuck at Hogwarts, and Luna off on one last pre-wedding creature hunt, he and Draco had been pressed into service.  Not that eating free cake was any hardship.  And even spending time with Draco (and he had become firmly that in Harry’s mind now) was no longer the terrible prospect it had once been.
"Weasleys," Draco replied smugly, with a nod at the busy redheads in the hall.
"I blame you for this, you know."
Hermione cast a quick Shield Charm on the flames.  Satisfied that her chattering child was in no danger, she turned back to Harry.  "So?"
Harry just nodded dumbly, hoping vainly that Ron would let it go.
Ron grimaced.  “Hardly.” He leant further forward on his chair and kept a wary eye on the kitchen door.  “Look, he’s still a narky git at times, and I have no plans to invite him down the pub Friday evening, but he’s civil when we meet, and he’s nice to Hermione.” Ron sank back in his chair with a shrug.  “That’s enough for me, you know?”
Harry swallowed hard.  “Pansy, I’m not sure what—”
"Right." Draco picked up his pen and scratched a few more notes on the napkin.  It wasn't much, but at least they were making some progress.  "Now, how about the bathroom?  Are you a bath or a shower person?"
She had a point, Harry supposed. Not that he had any intention of telling her that. "And you're sure this will work?"
Pansy shrugged.  "She's never been that keen on it, really – just an excuse to eat, drink, and spend a fortune, she says."
As he padded barefoot down the newly-stripped staircase, a rumble of his stomach hinted at the lateness of the hour and sent Harry in the direction of the kitchen.
As he ushered a protesting child out of the kitchen, Harry stopped in the door way and turned round.  Draco was watching him.  "I'll be as quick as I can.  Wait for me?"
Instead, he ambled down to breakfast, yawning expansively along the way.  His hair, even more so than usual, had a mind of its own, and as he approached the Gryffindor table, Harry was still fumbling with the knot of his tie.
"Ah, yes."  Blaise turned his amused expression on Harry.  "How goes the house hunting?"
But despite all the hard work that he knew was ahead of him, Harry was looking forward to this Christmas with an almost childlike glee.  And Draco, too, was beyond excited at the prospect.
Harry rolled his eyes – she really couldn't help herself.  "Goodbye, Hermione," he said, before tossing a handful of powder into the flames.  As the crackled green, he took a deep breath, stepped into them and spoke "Malfoy Manor" with a calmness he definitely didn't feel.
What Draco wanted to do was slip into his comfortable bed and mull over the evening's events.  He most definitely did
"No, Ron, he hasn't.  And swallow before speaking, will you?"  Hermione rolls her eyes and returns her focus to Harry.  "Neville tells me he's back at work full time now."
Ginny looks beautiful. She always has, to Harry. The end of their relationship hasn't altered that. And if there's sometimes a bittersweet feeling in his chest as he watches her in Neville's arms, when he faces the future that could have been his, if only he'd allowed it to be enough, there's no bitterness or jealousy there. Ginny's found the hero she deserves, the man Harry could never be for her, and he's content with that. He could never have relinquished her to a lesser man.
The moment was broken then as they were ushered into the back room where a table of delicious looking samples awaited them.  Harry’s stomach rumbled again and he flushed in embarrassment.
Harry bristled slightly at this.  How dare Hermione presume?  He'd said he was going, hadn't he?  It wasn't like he made a habit of going back on his word – or not very often, anyway.  "I'm surprised she didn't stick around to dress me," he muttered sulkily.
And this time it was Harry who took Draco's hand and led the way.
"The party was a frightful bore," he says, crossing the threshold.
In truth, Draco didn't need to work.  The Malfoy coffers had made it through the war very much unscathed, and even during Lucius's incarceration, Narcissa had managed the family funds with startling aplomb.  The fact was Draco enjoyed his work.  Yes, initially he'd balked at the idea of gainful employment, but the drive to rebuild the family name had motivated him.  His choices had been limited – with the Ministry being completely out of the question.  But while few would trust a Malfoy with power, many it turned out, would trust him with money.
"So you're not planning to pick up where you left off then?"
Harry glanced quickly in the direction of the door, and then turned back with a frown marring his brow.  "Really?  Like what?"
If possible, Potter's eyes widened further, and he tentatively reached out for Draco's hand.  "Can I…"
Draco lifted his head, a biting retort at the ready. But it vanished at the sight of his visitor.
Potter let out a throaty chuckle at this and gazed down at Draco with eyes that seemed as dark as the Black Lake.  "You're amazing," he murmured, so softly that Draco wasn't even sure he'd heard right.  But before he could ask Potter to clarify, Potter's mouth was busy elsewhere.
"Malfoy!" Harry couldn't help sound a little scandalised. "You can't drink that at work."
"He's bought a car."
"You knew?  And you didn't think to mention it?"
"Of course you hadn't, darling."  Pansy grabbed a serviette off the buffet table and held it out.  "You might need this for the drool."
want to be there.
"It better be." Robards was fair as bosses went, but Ron and Harry both knew better than to cross him. "It's already a day late. Any longer, Weasley, and you'll be spending the weekend on stakeout with Dawlish."
If it was possible, Harry's face burned an even brighter shade of red.  "I was
Malfoy's laugh was bitter and something clenched in Harry's chest.  "Maybe you shouldn't then," he said, with a rueful glance at the drink.
"Your parents love you, Malfoy," Harry butted in.  "Your mother lied to Voldemort for you.  Do you really think they'd want you to spend the rest of your life miserable?"
Harry choked slightly on his coffee.  "A television?"  he repeated.  "Lucius Malfoy, king of all things pureblood has a TV?  That's priceless."
"Something you want to tell me?"  Harry looked up at his friend, amused grin in place.
was what he had been talking about, Harry realised – but couldn't be sure if he felt relief or disappointment. So he took the proffered sweet, grateful to have an excuse not to talk.
"It was more than my life was worth at the time.  And you'd have never managed to keep it to yourself, anyway."
"He could say no," Harry replies with brutal honesty.  "Or laugh in my face."
Draco just nodded - really, what else could he do?  Aurora Zabini was notorious the wizarding world over.  The only wonder was that she could still find willing...victims.
"Harry and I went ice skating," he answered shortly.
Ron frowned for a moment while he worked that out, and then he flushed.  "Merlin, Harry, that's disgusting.  And not because of the gay thing," he added hurriedly.  "But you're my best friend – it'd be like thinking that about one of my brothers."
Draco grinned.  "Mothers love me," he said smugly, before pecking a quick kiss to Harry's cheek.
"Potter." Draco added just the hint of a smile to his nod. "You came."
Pansy snorted softly.  “Poor Millie, you mean.  You do realise she’ll actually have to have sex with Marcus in order to get pregnant?”  She wound up with a noise of revulsion and a distinct shudder, which was repeated around the table.
Any further thoughts in such areas were interrupted by the office door opening once again.  Pansy Parkinson emerged once more, and though her smile was a little less bright on this occasion it was still very much there nonetheless.
"Close your mouth," Harry murmured, nestling under the sheets.
Draco shifted awkwardly.  “So what’s his problem then?”
“She had pretty hair.  Like Cousin Draco.”  And then Teddy’s hair shifted to a Malfoyesque shade of blond to emphasise his point.
In reply, Draco simply thrust the items he was carrying into Pansy's hands.  "I...um...have to go," he said lamely, before turning on his heel and striding from the shop.
“In the kitchen,” he replied.
“You might want to try being a little more tactful then,” Draco suggested, glancing pointedly at Blaise who was now morosely picking at his stew.
“Of course it has.” Hermione patted his tummy before turning her amused gaze on Harry.  “Ron’s right, though, Harry.  You’ve barely stopped talking about Malfoy since we sat down.”
"Yet." Hermione's expression was more than a little knowing, and not even Ron missed this.
“I’m pregnant,” Hermione replied simply, and then sat back in her seat, hands clasped over her stomach as she watched realisation dawn on her friend’s face.
"Did you have something in mind?"  Draco asked carefully – he was mindful that the last time this had happened, he'd wound up babysitting an excitable Teddy Lupin.
?" Snape repeated, looking between the two of them in confusion.  "How long have I been dead?"
~*~*~*~
Ron let out a dry chuckle.  "Nor will his wife once she realises she won't be part of it.
Narcissa affected a mock-wounded expression. "To see you of course, darling.  One would think a son would be pleased to see his mother."
"Did you hear that?"  Harry rounded one of Honeydukes laden shelves and looked at Ron with wide eyes.
Harry/Draco, Ron/Pansy, implied Hermione/Terry Boot
The garden was covered by a thick blanket of snow, and in pride of place, in what once was the lawn, was a fat, jolly-looking snowman.  And Harry arrived just in time to see Hermione push a large carrot into place for a nose, while little Rose Weasley clapped excitedly by her mother's feet.
The parquet floor was polished to an impressive shine, and Harry could already picture Teddy skidding along on his knees the next time he came to visit. The walls had been painted a soft yellow colour, bringing light to the previously gloomy hallway. The banisters had been stripped and waxed, and the rest of the woodwork freshly painted. It really did look amazing, and this was just the first room.
Harry smiled at that. "I don't think age has anything to do with it. It's just what good friends do for each other."
~16,300
Ron had been easy enough to misdirect on the few occasions he'd noticed Harry's appearance, and there was no one else really looking.  But Hermione was back now, and nothing got past her, and Harry resigned himself to another course of Dreamless Sleep if he wanted to avoid the third degree and questions he couldn't, or didn't want, to answer.
Astoria's gaze flicked to Draco immediately as she began her protest.  "I don't think—"
be big news.  True, they weren't quite the arch-nemesis's they once were, but still...  Was it too much to expect the odd expression of shock or outrage?
Harry ignored the portrait, turning instead to his friend.  "Are you sure we can't stick him up in the library."
Draco definitely laughs a little, the bastard, and obviously turns to look.  "Is that the lovely Martha with her?"  He sounds endlessly amused by the whole situation and all Harry can do is groan.
They entered the lift and Draco punched in a code that enabled them to access the top floor.  After a journey that made Harry's ears almost pop at the speed of it, the lift
Of course he didn’t, but that didn’t stop the coil of desire that unfurled in his belly at the thought.
Hermione scowled at him.  "Yes, that's what I said.  My parents went last year and loved it.  They said the acoustics in there were amazing."
"My apologies, Mother."  Draco stepped forward and leant in to kiss her cheek.  "I was unavoidably detained on a matter of urgent business."  He'd actually met Greg in the Leaky for a swift drink after work which had promptly turned into several – but business
"It's fine," he says, more from a need to hear the words out loud, than out of any hope he'll convince her.
"Harry!"  Weasley's voice was somewhat muffled by the jumper he was pulling over his head.  Such was Draco's gratitude that he didn't even comment on the hideousness of it.  "Me and Hermione are getting off now.  Got to pick the kids up from Mum's."
When the first shout echoed through the house, Harry was in his bedroom fresh from the shower. He looked at his clock – a whole hour had passed since he left the Ministry; Hermione was slipping. Harry had just tugged on a pair of jeans when a loud 'pop' heralded Kreacher's arrival. House-elves were no great respecters of privacy.
"I know you're awake."  Malfoy's fingers don't pause in their dance.  "I can hear you over thinking."
Harry grinned, relieved he hadn’t made the moment awkward.
after the war."
Harry smiled.  "It's not a different language, you know."
Draco nodded, and Harry hurried from the room, wondering if Hermione would mind him using an ever-so-gentle Body Bind on her daughter, given the circumstances.
Harry retreated to the kitchen, seeking refuge in a strong cup of coffee.  He pulled out one of the stools and perched at the worktop.  The sounds of Pansy’s shrieking and Draco’s softer, more rational words, echoed through the flat, but Harry was oblivious to them.  All his attention was focussed on what had passed between Draco and him earlier that evening – he was sure he could still feel the ghost of Draco’s palm against his own – and he couldn’t help but torment himself with “what if”s.
"You need to make this right. I'm not watching my best friend hide away in that bloody house for another four years."
"I'll tell you how it's my business, Potter." There was something oh-so-familiar in the way Malfoy said his surname that time. "You employed me to redesign this house, which I'm trying to do. But it's a bit bloody hard when you keep chasing my elves out of the room because you want to wallow in self-pity."
The door clanged shut and Ron turned to leave, but not before muttering, "Or at least he can if you don't piss Malfoy off again."
Harry let out a sigh, relieved to have survived the encounter relatively unscathed.  But his time on the dance floor was not done.
Malfoy just grinned at that though.  "
"She's boycotting Christmas?" Draco asked incredulously.  "Why, for the love of Merlin?"
Harry shrugged.  “Sounds fine to me.  And it’s not like I have anywhere else to go, is it?”
"I don't!" Even though maybe he once had. "I didn't think and I made a mistake. I wish I could take it back, but I can't."
After she'd saved his life, Harry had struck up an acquaintance with Narcissa Malfoy that most, himself included on more trying days, found difficult to understand.  On the surface they had absolutely nothing in common, but Harry had, over the years, developed a grudging respect for the woman who had risked everything to protect her family.
, he nodded reluctantly.
Harry choked on his drink.  "I'm sorry,
Harry sighed with relief.  Even though there was nothing between Draco and him, he couldn’t bear to think he had cheapened his feelings with a drunken one-night stand.
Not that the juiciest parts bore the remotest resemblance to Harry's actual life.  Post war and Hogwarts, there was nothing vaguely juicy about his life.
"Oh, Harry."  Hermione was flushed and breathless.  "Sorry, I didn't hear you."
"Well," Draco sounded a bit breathless, "If that's what I get for this room, I can't wait till you've seen the rest of the house."
"Do you want to get out of here?"
The conversation lulled for a moment as Hermione entered the room, plates in hand.  Harry couldn't help but be grateful for the interruption – Ginny's expression showed her temper wasn't far behind.
"I was hoping you'd bring your young gentleman with you."  Molly pulled back finally, a beaming smile on her face, and what looked like tears in her eyes.  "Arthur and I want the chance to get to know him."
"Of course he will," Narcissa replied briskly, and gestured to the path ahead of them.
," she said finally.  "It's
to shag him.”
"What's all this?" Harry questioned curiously.
“Well, I do.”  Luna smiled dreamily and allowed Harry to guide her in a turn.  “And Draco noticed too.”
Of course,
Harry didn't reply for a moment.  Lost in thought, he just fiddled aimlessly with the box in his hands.  "I should really get on with this count," he said finally.
look terrible," she said finally, and it came out more like an accusation than a show of concern.
Potter simply shrugged, and the flush became more visible.  Draco could see where it disappeared under the crisp collar of Potter's shirt, and couldn't help but wonder just
The amusement faded from Pansy's eyes.  "Fine," she said.  "I'll play along.  It's not like I haven't had years of practice."
Draco's hand reached up and grabbed her wrists.  "No.  And don't
The doorbell comes as something of a surprise.  His friends know to Floo first, and there are scant other people who would announce a visit, much less turn up uninvited.  Unsure if he's relieved or irritated that the evening's wallowing has been interrupted, Harry makes his way to the door.
"What's that supposed to mean?"
It was the wrong move to make, apparently, because Hermione bristled visibly.  "What, so it's okay for you to pal up with Blaise Zabini, and now
Eventually Draco got up.  Stretching his aching muscles, he let out a groan as they protested the motion vociferously.
"Thank you for clearing that mystery up for me."  Draco held back the eye roll with great restraint, and so allowed a hint of sarcasm to colour his tone as reward.  "I can see perfectly well
"But everyone knows I'm gay."
"Well, we can't have that, can we?"
“Stay.”  It was Teddy, not Andromeda, who spoke, and he backed it up with a tug on Harry’s jumper.  “Cousin Draco is the best at playing trains.  Please, Harry?”
"Really," Harry replied. "And if you hadn't burst in when you did, I'd be showing him just how much by now."
"Oh, come on, Harry." Hermione picked up the overnight bag that Malfoy had instructed Kreacher to pack for Harry. "It's only for one night. Besides, I think it's a nice idea."
-*-*-*-
"I don't know how. I've tried to see him, but he's blocked the Floo and changed the wards at the manor, and all my owls come back unread."
"Charming."  Pansy gave a little shake of her head.  "And damn right I won't marry you.  The last thing I want in a husband is completion for the gardener's attentions."
Harry sat back in his chair and ran his eye over the assembled guests at his table as they slowly picked over the cheese board that Draco had insisted on.   This was a collection of people he had never thought to see in a room together, much less on Christmas Day.  People who, a few short years ago, could have been counted upon to hex each other on sight, were now laughing and joking, as they pulled crackers and wishbones.
Hermione feigned surprise. Badly.
But right then he just didn't care.  Ron's words had set his mind working overtime, and Harry was busy reanalysing his every interaction with Draco over the last few months.  He wasn't completely clueless, despite what Ron thought.  Harry was more than self-aware enough to understand his own feelings for Draco had long since passed the friendship stage.  But the idea of reciprocation was definitely new.  Draco had never given any indication that he wanted more – had he?
Ginny just gave him a
Harry ignored the urge to
Draco looked intently at Harry for a moment – his pupils slightly dilated.  "I'll talk to her," he answered shortly.
Harry shrugged. "It's your fault it's not done – I've taken enough grief from him over the last few weeks because you've been too busy fantasising about Parkinson to do any actual work."
Then Malfoy leans forward, damp forehead pressed to Harry's.  Harry watches him from close up, can't help wondering who else has had the chance to see Malfoy this raw, this open – the dark sweep of lashes against flushed cheeks, kiss-swollen mouth, and usually-perfect hair now completely dishevelled.
Blaise shook his head. "It's not that. I don't think Draco would care either way. He'd probably be glad to be left alone, and that's likely why she won't do it. Pansy knows if she wasn't there pushing him, Draco would just lock himself away in that house like it was some kind of giant mausoleum."
“Or naked men, in your case,” Ron amended hurriedly.  “I’m sure we could take it in turns,” he continued, though his tone and expression said otherwise.
Her tone brooked no argument, and Harry had more sense than to try.  He gave one last longing look at the kitchen – suddenly silver sprinkles didn't seem such a bad prospect after all.
"Because, Potter," Pansy began, annoyance clear in her tone, "you and Draco have it bad for each other.  I know it, all your friends know it, Merlin, even Ron managed to figure it out all by himself.  But for some reason you two seem intent on driving us all crazy with this dance of denial you insist on doing.  Now get on that dance floor and tell him – before I do something that
"Not that, I can assure you."
Blaise gestured vaguely with his hand, causing amber liquid to slosh dangerously close to the rim of the glass he held.  He paid no heed and continued to smile at Harry in the manner of one who had already imbibed a fair few drinks previously.
He felt a cool hand press against his forehead, pushing damp hair back from his face, as he struggled to open his eyes.
Harry grinned despite himself.  "You're incorrigible, you know that?"
Draco smiled ever so slightly, and Harry's insides flipped like a pancake.  "It's okay," he murmured, and then leaned in so close that his nose brushed against Harry's cheek.  "I know."
Harry lets go of his grip on Neville's arm now he's steady on both feet.  "Sorry.  Must have got side-tracked."
Harry couldn't help but remember Malfoy's expression when he'd talked about living at Malfoy Manor, and couldn't help feel sympathetic at the prospect he'd be forced to return.  Living somewhere so full of unhappy memories wasn't good for anyone.  And after moving into Grimmauld Place at the end of the war, Harry knew all about that.
"So you've decided what you're cooking, have you?  You've shopped for ingredients, made sure you have something nice – and clean, to wear?"
"You taught her that on purpose, you bastard."
"Hang in there, Potter."
"Course we are," Ron agreed heartily, and Harry could hear his feet shuffling out of range.  "We're made up for you.  It's just..."
Clearly Potter was not troubled by the same distractions.  "Huh?"  He looked up, apparently reluctantly, from his parchment and frowned at Draco.
"Still sulking then?"  Harry can't resist a little jab.
Clearly a minute was too long for Draco, because Harry heard footsteps behind him.  He tried to ignore it, and busied himself with filling the kettle, grabbing the mugs, and generally trying to keep his emotions in check.
"For the love of Merlin, please don't ever finish that sentence.  I saw enough last night to last a life time."
me to do?"
“Why don’t you go to bed?  You look knackered.”
was provoked."
Well, bugger.
"To talk.  Would it be okay if I came in?" Malfoy gestured in the direction of the bed with a hopeful expression on his face.
Biting back every retort that sprang to mind, including several that were entirely too witty to be wasted in this manner, Draco gestured vaguely at the empty seats.
Harry faltered a little as Draco dismantled his best objection.  Truth was, there was no real reason he didn't like the flat.  Yes, it was lavish, but Harry knew he would get used to that – and with the hours he worked it wasn't like he'd spend excessive amounts of time there.  It just seemed that his brain was determined to object, irrationally or otherwise, to every single property Draco showed him.
"Okay," Ginny said quietly before she turned to go.
"Uncle 'Arry."  Rose spotted him first and trotted over as quickly as wellington boots and deep snow would allow.
Hermione just smiled.  "You'll be fine.  Just make sure you give those to him.  No hiding them down the back of the sofa."  Harry tried his best to look injured at the accusation, but it was a little hard to manage when he knew she spoke from past experience.  "Talking of Ron," she continued, "I bumped into him yesterday."
"Shower?" Harry prompts – and he means both of them this time.  No point being shy when they've both just made each other come in their pants, is there?
“You’re not putting us in those poncy robes that you wear, are you?” he asked, nose wrinkled in distaste.
Malfoy crossed his arms over his chest and stared Harry down.
"Me?" Harry asked, not fully understanding the question.
Harry allowed the smile to cross his face now.  "Mrs Black's long gone."
"Your new dining room, apparently," Neville said. "Malfoy had his elves working through the night."
plants in his morning tea, because there's no other possible explanation for the way this conversation is going.  The silly grin now plastered on his face is a further sign that something isn't quite right.
"I got some perspective."
"I'd like to see some time." And Harry was surprised by just how much he meant that.
Ron nodded thoughtfully.  “I can see that.  It’s still bloody weird though.”
Hermione glanced at the slender gold watch on her wrist.  "I have to go," she admitted reluctantly.  "We have an appointment with a wedding planner this afternoon."
"Not exactly." Harry snorted in amusement.  Then, casting his gaze around them, asked, "Is your mother with you?"
Draco hadn't even realised his nipples were that sensitive, until Potter kissed down his chest and flicked at them gently with his tongue.  He gasped out loud as he felt teeth graze against the sensitive nubs.  Potter chose that exact same moment to rotate his hips more forcefully before, causing the friction to reach glorious new heights.  They moved against each other quicker now, in complete synchronisation, their breath hot on each other's faces.
Draco, in turn, pushed him up against the work top and began tugging Harry's shirt up over his head.  "I didn't want to presume," he murmured, before pressing warm lips against the skin of Harry's chest.
George quickly gulped the last of his beer then held the empty glass out for Harry to take.  "Sure.  I've left Ginny in charge of the shop."  He stopped short then, a guilty expression on his face.
"Much of an arse the man is?" Ron suggested.
Malfoy's brows rose slightly and Harry mentally kicked himself for biting.
"No dead elf heads," Harry agrees.
He locked his reaction to that firmly away with all the other reactions he'd been having lately that he wasn't ready to examine yet.  Instead, he got carefully to his feet, ran a shaky hand through his undoubtedly messy hair, and shuffled off to the kitchen in search of caffeine.
Harry pouted slightly as Draco walked in a slow circle, inspecting him from all angles.  "I'm quite capable of dressing myself."
Draco's face was even more stunned thant it had been after Harry kissed him.  "But I didn't think you'd made your mind up yet."
"Fairy what?"
"The Nile," Harry clarified.  "I knew you getting that TV was a bad idea."
Draco had many years experience in knowing how to smell a rat, and the stench now was overwhelming, but for the moment he decided to play along – at least until he had figured out just what his mother was up to.
is that, Harry?"  Hermione scrutinised him from over the top of her latte.
Harry smiled indulgently.  "Well, I had been thinking more along the lines of cheese sandwich, but if that's what you want—"
"I love you."
"It's a clear case of mistaken identity and we have a witness who can corroborate this."
“A blindfold?”
“Bastard,” she hissed.  “That fucking hurt.”
"I'm only teasing," she replied, and gave her best pout.
"I thought Gryffindors were supposed to be the brave ones?"
“What?” Harry decided denial was his best line of defence.  “I’m just saying.”
"There's nothing
Try as he might, Harry could not coax forth the barest hint of a memory.  He remembered leaving the pub with Ron and - Harry stilled momentarily - Felix!  He peered warily back into his bedroom but nothing in there gave any sign that he had done anything more than sleep.
Padma proved correct in her assertions, and it took Draco only a short time before he saw Harry's familiar figure up ahead.
repeated ad nauseum, and then followed up by a noise that sounded uncommonly like a honking sea lion.”
"They are, aren't they," Harry agreed, before pressing a gentle kiss to  Draco's temple.  "Will you come with me?"
“No!” Harry said firmly, determined to stop Ron before he got too carried away.  “I know you mean well, mate, but please stop trying to throw me at every gay man you meet.”
“You do seem rather fixated on that, Harry.”  Luna was definitely smirking now.  “Draco was delighted when I asked him.”
“Malfoy, is it?”  Dean asked.  “I’d heard it was
Harry laughed.  "Oh no.  There's not a chance of that.  You'd better tell your mother to get used to it."
There was the sound of scuffed footsteps and the living room door banged open to reveal Draco Malfoy.  "Has it arrived?" he asked eagerly.  "Is he here?"
"Any luck finding a replacement for her yet?"  It was a sore point and Harry knew it.  Verity had been with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes since the beginning, and he knew George felt losing her was just like losing one more tie to the past, and to Fred.
"Behave," Hermione scolded over the sound of Potter spluttering his drink. "Now, make yourself useful and set these out."
"I'm not saying some of it wasn't deserved, or that they were the only ones, but they were still children. And with most of the Death Eaters killed or locked up in Azkaban, they bore the brunt of a lot of people's anger." Blaise paused then and took a sip of the tea Hermione offered him. "I think if it was just Pansy, that she'd brazen it out. She's got more balls than most blokes, that one."
"Huh?" Ron's expression remained confused at best.
Harry huffed.  "I don't think-"
Draco pulled his hand away from his scalp and scowled.  "What do you want, Blaise?"
Draco gave a dismissive shrug.  “Some great aunt of Father’s is on her last legs.  We aren’t particularly close to her, but it’s the correct thing for them to do, especially when there’s a Loire Valley chateau at stake.”
Draco struggled hard to keep a reign on his rising temper – he didn't want to fall out with Pansy, not about that, and certainly not in the middle of Honeydukes.  "She knows it's not a love match."
Draco Malfoy, owner/occupier of the bed in question, paused briefly in his perusal of Gladrags latest mail order offering and glanced at his best friend.  "Millicent again?" he asked, tone somewhat bored.  This was also hardly to be wondered at given that just three weeks into term, Pansy's increasingly irate tirades against her roommate were becoming a now-familiar part of Draco's routine.
, the spectacle they were making because Ron had insisted on wearing his trainee Auror robes to impress her, and then had whinged until Harry had caved and done the same, this was the sort of thing that made Harry plot his friend's demise in a variety of colourful ways.
With each step, Harry's feet felt heavier.  He spotted a familiar red phone box looming in the distance, and just for a moment was tempted to slip inside and
“Harry! You about?”
have come that Draco only gives a slight shake of his head.  "Can't keep your head out of the clouds for five minutes.  No wonder you used to drive Severus to distraction."
"Zabini's crawling back out from under his rock then," Ron commented, flashing a bright grin at the waitress as she took his plate.  "What's that in aid of?"
Hermione's expression softened.  "Are you sure this is a good idea?" she asked.
Malfoy shifted uncertainly, the box still balanced on his outstretched palm. "Well, say something."
"Why should I care?  What Malfoy chooses to do with his life is none of my business."
as he stretched out with his wand and neatly siphoned the dark liquid of the parchment.
"Fine."  Hermione closed the oven door with a bang.  "You're helping because you're a very good friend, and because you don't want me to tell Ron what you got up to in this very kitchen last night."
"Good for you."  Hermione beamed at him like a proud mother."Go on then," she said, making a shooing motion with her hands.
to get married," he blurted out finally.
"Too easy, Potter." Malfoy gives an amused shake of his head.
Granger clasped the books tighter against her chest and gave Draco a thoughtful look – one which he returned with interest.
Harry looked away.  Choosing instead to concentrate on his hands as they fiddled with the cuffs of his jumper, rather than face his best friend.  Even though he knew Hermione better than anyone else, there was still a small part of Harry that feared her reaction.  "
Neville just shrugged helplessly.  “I know it’s a little unorthodox, but...”
"Yes."  Harry tightened hi s hold around Draco's waist.  "I was thinking of going tomorrow."
Harry nodded.  “He wasn’t too happy when I pointed out the rest of the building might object to a sudden, and rather localised, snow storm.”
Harry keeps his eyes closed a few moments longer.  He has no idea what this means, how he's supposed to react.  Obviously his body has its own ideas about that, but mostly Harry likes to think with his brain.
Draco couldn't concentrate.
Hermione brandished a bottle of wine in reply. "It's too early for coffee. Besides, you always talk more with a little of this inside you."
Harry's mouth was suddenly devoid of all moisture.  A voice at the back of his mind – one that sounded uncommonly like Ron – was telling him that this was clearly a parallel universe he had stumbled into.  One where Draco Malfoy was semi-naked, glistening with sweat, and apparently gay, if the way he was grinding back against his dance partner was any indication.
"A little late for social calls, isn't it, Blaise?"  Draco dusted nonexistent soot off his sleeves and affected his best nonchalant manner.
"Just what, Ronald?" Hermione enquired.  Harry shifted his chair back just a tiny bit – there was no point getting caught in the crossfire.
"I can't promise I won't," Harry said honestly. "But I'll never do it intentionally. People in relationships hurt each other sometimes. It's what happens."
"I'm glad my misery amuses you."
"Oh, Harry. Really?" Hermione stepped closer, smile brightening. "I did wonder about the two of you, I must admit. It's part of the reason why I went along with it, but…" She reached out for Harry's hand. "Forget everything I just said. Ignore me and my meddling. I think the two of you will make a lovely couple,
He stilled at the realisation of Malfoy's head on his shoulder, uncertain of how to respond.  He could only imagine Ron's reaction if he came through the Floo now.  But instead of shifting as common sense told him he should, Harry just reached over, removed the empty glass from Malfoy's hand and placed it securely on the table beside them.  Then he followed suit with his glasses, before settling back and allowing his own much-needed slumber to take hold.
"I'm not so sure this is a good idea."  The uncertainty was clear in Harry's tone.
"So your parents both know then," Potter stated, somewhat redundantly.
"Still motivating the junior staff members, I see?"
In the end, he had settled for a fairly junior position in the Department of Magical Games and Sports.  His love of Quidditch, and the recent departure of Ludo Bagman, had been the deciding factors in his acceptance of the post.
Blaise dropped into the chair at Hermione's side, pecked a quick kiss to her cheek, before grinning broadly at the rest of them. "So, what are we talking about?"
#3 Snowman
,” Blaise interrupted, his tone calm but firm.
Harry stared intently at the floor. "I didn't want to let everyone down."
What if Draco was just being polite, not wanting to offend him by shrugging off his hand?  What if Pansy hadn’t been there when they got home?  What if Draco came out of that room and pinned him down on the worktop right now?
It was a good job Draco had swallowed his wine an instant before his mother spoke, because he was sure she wouldn't have taken very kindly to being sprayed with it.  "What?"
"I should think not." Ron crouched down at his side.  "Want a hand?"
“It’s hardly
Harry's own participation had been minimal - Draco was far too dismissive of his creative talents to allow him anywhere near the jewelled baubles, swags of evergreens, or assorted decorations that had been purloined from the Manor.  Harry's role had consisted mainly of untangling endless strings of fairy lights and fixing garlands on the walls under Draco's critical, and somewhat dictatorial, eye.
Malfoy, who had been watching the conversation with interest, now dug into his pocket and produced what Harry recognised on sight as being one of his business cards.  "You should come and see me at the office," he said, holding the card out.
He was gone from the room before Harry had chance to protest that this wasn't quite the help he had in mind.
. It wouldn't have been the first of his relationships to falter under public scrutiny. And he wanted,
Blaise rolled his eyes in return.  "What?  Because I'm straight I can't comment on another bloke's arse?"
Draco seemed to understand his reluctance, because he smiled, pressed a slow soft kiss to Harry's lips, and then murmured, "Hold on tight."
"It's fine," Draco replied; the lie tasted like ash in his mouth.  "It was just a spur of the moment decision."
Ten minutes of hot water running soothingly over his tired muscles and Harry felt something more like himself.  The anger was still there, in fact, the longer he had to think about Malfoy, the more it increased.  It had taken courage Harry hadn't known he possessed to make the first move like he had, and regardless of what had happened afterwards, it now felt like Malfoy had just thrown it all back in his face.
"You're wasting your time, Draco.  He's a lost cause."
Harry made one last attempt to rein in his temper. "I only wanted—"
"Look, don't get—" Draco stopped and ran one hand distractedly through his hair.  "I've just come from the Ministry," he said finally.  "And I can assure you that Weasley is not there."
Malfoy swaying precariously again when he entered the Floo was enough to make up Harry's mind, and he followed behind. "Budge up."
It's silent and uncomfortable, and Harry's wondering how long he's going to have to lie there before alcohol or sleep takes hold.  Fortunately, his bed partner has planned ahead.
"Ask me what?"
I could have sworn I saw Greg Goyle leaving just as I arrived."
"Yup."  Ron nodded.  " It was George's idea of showing Charlie our support."
"I got the password off Pansy," Malfoy admitted softly, his face peering between the red curtains on Harry's bed.
"I know that now." Both Hermione's face and her tone betrayed the guilt she felt. "But it's too late to take it back. I just want you to promise me you'll let him down gently."
"You certainly know how to make a splash."
"Like you've ever made bread sauce," Blaise commented.

Ron choked on his tea.  "That's different," he protested.  "Me and Hermione are married.  You and Malfoy aren't... together.  Are you?"  This last was asked with more than a hint of alarm.
"No," he said quickly.  "That's just it – there's not going to be a wedding."
"You're sure about that?"
“How did it go again, Blaise?  I’m sure you remember.”
was something to be wondered at.  Her smile, when it came, was hardly radiating warmth.
"I can't believe Hermione managed to drag you to one of these things."
"That's okay."  Ron gave a dismissive wave of his hand.  "George said he didn't mind if I borrowed you for a bit."
, Harry couldn't help but wonder what the hell he was doing there.  He'd withstood criticism of his living arrangements for years, and honestly, although an actual bed would be nice after a long shift at St Mungo's, Harry genuinely didn't mind his flat.  Yes, it was compact, a little on the basic side, but it had everything he needed – room for the aforementioned bed notwithstanding.
Something warm and, as yet, unnamed, squirmed in Harry's belly at the thought of Malfoy working with Hermione for his sake. But he just didn't understand. "Why?"
"I fail to see—"
Draco flipped a golden omelette out of the pan and onto a nearby plate.  He brought it over to the table and settled it in front of Harry.  "Here, that should help settle your stomach."
"Your presence," Draco shot back before he had time to analyse his words.
Draco muttered the words under his breath.  He had no desire for his companion to overhear, or indeed ask any incredibly awkward questions that Draco would
It's a sign of how far
"Shut up, Blaise."  Draco scowled.
The walk to the dance floor seemed endless; feet seemed like miles. And yet, despite that, Harry arrived at his destination far too quickly for his liking.  His instincts were screaming at him to run, to head back to the bar and get extremely drunk, but one look in that direction showed Pansy was watching him with a terrifying glint in her eyes, so Harry coughed instead.
Draco shook his head. "Fairy lights."
"Did you know he was going to be here?"  Harry's gaze drifted back to the dance floor just in time to see Draco's partner licking his neck.
"To visit your parents?"  Draco asked, his heart pounding in his chest at the prospect.
The haze of sleep now having receded somewhat, Harry found himself remembering exactly
"If you don't mind, I think I'll join you."
Harry's heart lodged itself in his throat again. "He told you that?"
"It's not that easy,"  Harry answered, pulling his hand away slowly.
Luna blushed prettily.  “Thank you, Harry.”  She reached up and tweaked his tie.  “You look rather handsome yourself.”
"You know how he gets." Ron shrugged and gestured vaguely in the direction of Robard's office. "Probably his time of the month." Ron looked like he wanted to take the words back as soon as they were out of his mouth, but Pansy didn't seem to mind.
Harry stared at his friend, eyes wide, and stung by this remark.  "And what about me?  What about how I feel?"
"But—"
Draco pulled back slightly, still licking his lips.  "Oh, I think this is
The dining room itself had been a revelation once Draco had allowed him access.  Not satisfied with purloining various items of tableware from the Manor, Draco had actually taken the liberty of transporting the dining table also.  He’d spent the morning commanding a small army of house-elves as they recreated Malfoy Manor, complete with candelabra and drinks cabinet.  Only Hermione’s presence had stopped him from having the elves serve them as well.
Harry nodded reluctantly.  "But in my defence, she worked it out herself."
The bubbles reached right to the brim of the bath, sparkling gaily in the flickering candlelight.  A large glass of wine was perched on a convenient ledge, and the air was scented with delicate hints of lavender.
"Then pick another room." Malfoy ran a free hand through his hair, exasperation clear in both his tone and expression. "Merlin knows you've got enough of them. Or if you must be in here,
Half-asleep still, and free from the inhibitions that usually plagued him, it seemed the natural thing to do for Harry to raise his head slightly and press his lips to Malfoy's.
Hermione perched in one of the fireside chairs, hands clasped in her lap. "Of course it's true, Ron." Her tone impatient. "Kingsley told us himself. He's hardly likely to make it up."
"I had a really nice time tonight." Draco settled back on the sofa, wine in hand, and smiled warmly at Harry.
"Where d'you want this putting?"  he grunted, giving a nod to the large tree he and George were currently manhandling.
"All that
"Smells nice," Ron commented casually, but Harry could tell it was killing him not to say more.
," he muttered to himself as he swirled the fluid fabric around his body.
The complaining tones of one Ronald Weasley were becoming an all too familiar sound in the Gryffindor common room.  To Harry, the usual recipient of said complaints, it was something akin to nails on a blackboard.
"Sorry I'm late."  Potter sank himself down into the vacant chair with a sigh of relief.  "We had a last-minute emergency."
“A Muggle ceremony, yes.”
"Drink."  Draco held out a small glass vial, and Harry grabbed onto it like a drowning man at a life raft.
"i thought you said Severus never shut up?"
"I'm not sure that would be a problem for you."
, Harry has memorised every such occasion.
“He did a great job with the wedding,” Harry replied, because really everyone knew whose vision it really was.
The End
“I thought it was
Chastened, Harry’s anger faded instantly. “No, it’s not.”  He’d never really thought about it like that, but Malfoy had a point. “Sorry.”
Malfoy
"And we didn't?" Ron's volume rose a little with his incredulity.
“Hermione?”  Malfoy asked with a smirk.
Feeling a pair of eyes watching him intently at that very moment, Harry turned and made his way back towards the bar.  As he crossed the room, Harry couldn't stop thinking about Draco.  His plan all along had been to ask his friend to dance, to lead him around the dance floor and see if he couldn't find something in Draco's eyes, something that would tell him if he was wasting his time or not.  But after three weeks spent living in such close contact, of seeing Draco every day, sometimes in various stages of undress, Harry wasn't sure he could be that close to Draco without exploding.
"Harry—"
Harry nodded, suddenly struck dumb by the sight of his dream car combined with the even more astonishing sight of Lucius Malfoy in jeans.
“Well, no.  Gabrielle was too young.  Besides, Charlie’s gay, you know that.”
"You're still with us then?"  Hermione asked, and she fixed a shrewd gaze on Ron from over the top of her goblet.
"Around seven," Ron replied.  "But come over whenever you're ready.  Rosie's always asking when Uncle Drake's coming over."
"Do what?" Harry asked, puzzled by Malfoy's cryptic words.
~*~*~
. "Mother, I don't think…you shouldn't listen to what Pansy says.  You know how she gets."
"Why not?"  Harry bristled at the implication of Ron's words.  "He wants to move out and so do I.  So I asked him if he wanted to share a flat.  What's not normal about that?"
Draco took a sip of his coffee and smacked his lips contentedly.  Then he smiled at his assistant over the rim of the cup.  "No, dark, handsome heroes of the wizarding world aren't really your type, are they?"   And considering the object of Astoria's current affections was a blond ex-Death Eater, Draco thought that was rather the understatement of the year.
"No," Ginny agrees. "You were never there in the first place."

“We’d kill each other before the week was out,” Blaise responded wryly.
"You know nothing."  Snape folded his arms firmly across his chest and glared out of his frame.  "Much as it pains me to assist you in your pursuit of that blasted boy, there is nothing between the two of them."
"I like him, Hermione."
With a flourish, Kreacher shook out a scroll of parchment.  "Mrs Wheezy was dropping it off earlier.  And was giving Kreacher very strict instructions that you is not to stay in tonight."
"And that's what you want with me?" Draco paused and licked his lips nervously. "A relationship?"
Harry shook his head.  "Sledgehammer," he explained with a grin.  "You're covering up the missing plaster until I get around to redoing it."
Draco snatched a slice of toast off his plate just in time, as a copy of the
But Potter was at work, or he had been until a short while ago, and Draco could only imagine the amount of wagging tongues that would be set off if he had met Potter at the end of his shift.  Astoria was only just over her last Potter-related snit – she'd be unbearable if he induced another one so soon.
the fact that most of his alternative remarks were likely to see him on the wrong end of a hex.  And then, because it occurred to him that after only a couple of minutes in Potter's company he had become as, if not more, inarticulate, Draco forced himself to continue.
“He’s jealous, Harry.”
"Cinnamon latte," Ron confirmed smugly.  "Your favourite."
Harry thought back to the angry glares in the Leaky, to the stories George had told him about disgruntled customers, and didn't argue the point.  "It's not right, though," he insisted.

Anthony meekly seated himself next to Harry, who was secretly grinning with relief that he was no longer the main target of Hermione’s daily tongue-lashings.
"Sorry."  Harry smiled wryly at Ron.  "Nothing personal."
was sufficient to gain her attention.
"Us?"  Harry's eyes widened impossibly but he didn't pull away. "It's not that I think it's bad, it's just. Well, I've never thought about it before."
So he went, made nice with various dignitaries, smiled for the photographers while shaking hands with the Minister, and then, once the festivities began, he would retreat to the well-stocked bar at the rear and sample their wares for as long as he could.  The beauty of attending without a partner was that he wasn't required to spend the best part of the evening embarrassing himself on the dance floor.
He knew he'd regret it, but Harry found himself asking nonetheless.  "Unless what?"
Harry turned round to see Draco, one arm struggling to keep Pansy upright, while the other fumbled to open the door.  He looked back at his friends.  “I’d better go,” he said ruefully.  “I’ll see you two on Wednesday.”
"I wouldn't bet on that," Pansy replied – she clearly meant to imply that she knew something more than Draco did, but he refused to bite.
"But I've got ages yet," Harry protested.
Seizing his chance, because a Ron losing at chess was a Ron with eyes for little else, Harry muttered his excuses and headed for the door.
Harry flushed at the implication.  "I'm not trying to save him."
Harry took one look at his friend's expression and knew there'd be no working with him that afternoon. "So much for helping," he muttered, with a glare at Hermione. "I'll never hear the end of this now."
Harry thought about how lonely he was, even in that pokey flat.  Then he thought of Draco - the conversations, things they had in common, how well they got along - and he couldn't work out why he even needed to think about it.
live to regret."
“Do you two think you could rein it in a bit, please?  It’s bad enough that I’ll have to spend Christmas listening to my mother’s constant bitching, without you two taking me for a trial run.”
“You should talk to him.” Harry’s expression clearly spoke volumes about this suggestion, because Hermione carried on quickly.  “I’m serious.  I think you’d actually get on if you gave him a chance.  Are you really going to let some imaginary feud ruin Luna and Neville’s wedding?”
All Harry could focus on was the
Neville looked up from the bed he was currently weeding and raised a hand to them in acknowledgement.  Draco nodded in reply.
"Does he?"  Harry isn't sure when it started, but Neville is turning into as a big a meddler as Hermione ever was.
"And now?"  Harry wasn't sure he wanted to know the answer, but he
“Man of Honour, actually,” Neville said, not even bothering to hide his amusement now.
Apparently that was all the encouragement Ron needed. "Bring him with you."
Hermione's smiling as he approaches, warm and approving. She also doesn't beat around the bush. "Well? How did it go?"
"Yes, Harry, we've seen it.  We'll need to set another place for Christmas dinner - Blaise will be joining us."
Ron shook his head.  "It isn't Zabini that he's interested in."
"Okay." This was news to Harry definitely, but it didn't exactly fall under the heading of
"Okay enough for you to want to date him?"
“Ginny.”  Harry smiled – they were far enough from their break up that he could do that without pain now.  “You look lovely.”  And she really did.  The gold in her dress complimented her hair perfectly.  But it was an abstract observation, and he was relieved to feel no attraction remained.
Anthony grinned proudly, but the exchange left Hermione spluttering.
Neville relaxed visibly at that – as if there was a chance that Harry might have said no.  “That’s great.  I,
Harry had barely filled his mug from the waiting pot before the door opened and Malfoy appeared.  Any awkwardness Harry had been expecting was stalled in its tracks by the sight of a livid bruise on the pale skin of Malfoy's jaw.  Without thinking, Harry reached out to touch it gently.
Pansy's gaze fixed on him then, narrowed slightly.  "Oh, believe me, I
“He likes you.”  It was said with the confidence of knowledge and caused a pleasant squirm in Harry’s belly.
"I'm getting married, Potter.  It's what my parents want, and there's nothing you can say that's going to change that."
"Something I said?"  Harry enquired, somewhat nervously, because Hermione had
A matching flush coloured Harry’s face – he’d never learned to take a compliment with grace.  “I don’t know about that,” he muttered.
"Am I?"
"There is no me and Harry," Draco insisted, his chest tightening considerable.  "If anything, it's
"Just take the risk, Harry," Neville repeats softly.
Draco was far from sure that anything would be
Draco shifted uneasily, as he always did at any mention of his former friend.  They had barely spoken since the end of the war - it was as if Vince’s death had destroyed their one common bond.
"Weasley's arse."  Malfoy's words were blunt and matter of fact, and were swiftly followed by the sound of Harry choking on his butterbeer.
Draco made a dismissive gesture with his hand.  "It's fine.  I used a Warming Charm on it." He paused then and took a deep breath, aware of the shock his next words could present.  "And it's Draco."
"Ron?" Harry was a little concerned. He was pretty certain this wasn't some big homophobic freak out, but he wanted to make sure.
"We were engaged within a year," Ginny says softly, something like sympathy in her eyes. "Did Draco ever even spend a full night at yours?"
Draco does as he's bid but his brow is still creased with confusion.  "What…?"
"Whose side are you on?"  Draco reached out and grabbed hold of her wrist.
"Are you all right, mate?"
It was only brief, a matter of seconds really, before Harry laid his head back against the pillows again, smiling broadly.
Draco had to admit the jumper certainly wasn't as garish as the ones he remembered seeing Ron wear at school.  It was a lovely soft, black knit, with a silvery-grey 'D' on the front, and if Draco was being honest, he was forced to admit it did feel rather nice against his skin.  "Maybe this time next year you'll have one of your very own," Draco teased.
So he was more than a little surprised, that evening, when he opened the front door and was greeted by the sight of a gaily decorated hallway.  Festive music drifted upstairs from the kitchen, and Harry was certain he could hear the faint echoes of Hermione's tuneless singing.
Hermione jerked her hand away.  "You're cooking for Draco?  Tonight?"
*~*~*~*~*~*
Harry made a mental note to probe Blaise further about that when they were alone – Blaise was possibly the biggest gossip he knew and, with a few more drinks inside him, Harry knew he'd get his answers in no time.  So instead, he said, "Give her my regards." Malfoy agreed that he would, and just like that Harry found himself exchanging pleasantries with Draco Malfoy.
"Wonderful."   Narcissa sipped slowly at her coffee then, clearly delighting in keeping her son in suspense.
it, Potter. Malfoys are no one's lackeys."
Harry could sense the shift in Malfoy's tone and it was plain he had been offended by the refusal.  "I'm sorry," Harry said, raking one hand through his hair in his unease.  "It's nothing personal, I promise you.  But I'm just not comfortable with doing that."
"It's been almost three months since she was here last."  Mrs Morrison digs deep in a jewelled bag before extracting her purse.  "Can you believe it?"
"You agreed," Draco said briskly.  "Do you want Mother to move back home or not?"
“Maybe not,” Draco assented reluctantly, “But Harry can.  He does a roast that would have the Manor’s house-elves wailing into their tea towels with jealousy.”
"Bloody hell! We only just got back, how the—"
But there was no time for Harry to expand on his denials, as the door opened then to admit a rather dishevelled-looking Malfoy. Harry noticed the dust on his clothes and what was possibly a cobweb in his hair, but his main focus was on the familiar box in Malfoy's hands.
"Here here." Draco raised his glass in toast. "Well said."  Some of the liquid sloshed over the rim.
“I’m not so sure that’s a good idea,” Harry replied slowly.  “I know it’s the season of goodwill and all that, but I think it’d have to be a cold day in hell before your father sits down to dinner with Harry Potter and a Weasley.”
Malfoy managed to stop himself mid-shrug this time.  "I've become something of a scapegoat this last year, or hadn't you noticed."
"You didn't seem to mind at the time."  This wasn't necessarily true, because Harry had only been half asleep, but Draco's lips certainly hadn't objected.
“But nothing,” Ron interrupted.  “Nearly six months, Harry.  Don’t you think Malfoy would have said by now if he wanted a repeat performance?  You need to forget about it and move on.  Living here, with him, feeling the way you do - it’s just not healthy.”
"I care about you, Draco. I know…I know I've screwed everything up, but—"
"It's not that bad," Harry muttered defensively, but the glare he shot his friend was weak at best.

feelings clear though."
finally got together.
"Your sidekicks," Draco continued, not even troubling to hide his eye-roll this time.  "I barely recognise you without them tagging along."
“Yes,” Draco agreed.  “But the sales are just beginning.”
Harry only stepped in close again, crowding Draco against a nearby tree.  “Scared, Malfoy?”
Draco choked on his next mouthful of coffee – it was definitely not as pleasant in the other direction.  "Potter made an appointment?  Why didn't you tell me?"
. It's
Harry started in surprise; he hadn't even noticed his father-in-law emerging from the car.
"I'm best friends with Hermione, Malfoy."  Draco was sure that if Potter had been able to focus properly, he would have rolled his eyes here.  "She doesn't let us eat dinner unless we can prove we learnt three new words that day."

Neville patted his arm consolingly.  “Cheer up, Harry.  It’s not like you actually
Hermione repeated, eyes narrowed warningly.
"It's rude to stare, Potter," Draco commented after a few moments had passed.
"I don’t know why you felt the need to keep it a secret from us," Molly continued.  "Did you think we wouldn't be happy for you?"
Draco frowned a little – he had yet to see the problem.  "But you always used to celebrate it," he pointed out.  "I remember."
He glared at the new arrival.  "I wouldn't let Pansy hear you say that."
Narcissa nodded and removed her hand.  Draco knew she was remembering the terrible nightmares he had suffered in the aftermath of the war.  "I'll have Tilly prepare you a Sleeping Draught tonight," she said, taking the seat opposite.
"What if you hurt me again?" Draco asked, his voice small and scared.
“It is unusual, I’m not denying that. But does it really warrant a two hour conversation?” Hermione sipped at her own drink, her eyes fixed on Harry over the rim.  “You still seem…well, fixated, frankly.  And that’s why I don’t bring him up around you.” She placed her glass carefully back on the table and leant forward slightly.  “People change, Harry.  You need to move on.  Even Ron manages to be civil to Draco now.”
"Two sugars," Harry finished up.  "I still remember."  The start of a flush crept up Draco's neck, but Harry turned away quickly and headed into the kitchen.  "I won't be a minute."
The walk back to Gryffindor tower had begun with a spring in his step, but with every passing yard, Harry felt the all too familiar mantle of guilt settle more and more firmly onto his shoulders.  By the time he reached the portrait hole, Harry was scrabbling desperately in his bag for his Cloak.
"What?  Oh, yes, we do sometimes.  All it needs is a little Warming Charm.  Harry loves it out there."
"Exactly." Pansy smiled tentatively at him. "I always had you pegged as marrying Ron's sister and populating the world with even more Weasleys."
Harry frowned slightly.  “What’s wrong with that?”
“Yes, we are,” Ron retorted.  “Someone needs to say it, and as I’m the only other person who knows, it’s going to have to be me.”
Snape lets out a familiar dismissive snort.  "Want?  I should think not.  Were I to pick the ideal mate for Draco, you would hardly feature on the list."  He folds his arms across his chest and fixes a beady stare on Harry.  "But the choice is not mine, and Draco has spent enough years living according to others desires."
Harry clenched his teeth and turned around.  He was surprised to find the young girl who worked behind the counter in
Epilogue compliant? No
"You have heard about Hermione and Blaise, right?" Harry couldn't help teasing for the life of him.
know you love him, doesn't mean Draco's figured it out yet."
"We'll be fine."  Draco gave a curt nod to match his tone and then headed from the room; he was relieved to hear the Floo roar to life behind him.
Harry tilted his head to one side and opened his eyes.  The bright colours of the twinkling lights reflected off Draco's face, giving him an almost otherworldly glow.  "What do you want?"  Harry felt suddenly tired, the fight drained from him.
Harry's hands were busy making short work of Draco's robes, finally leaving them pooled around his feet.  It was a sign of Draco's state of mind that he simply kicked the expensive fabric to one side, leaving them in a crumpled heap on the floor.
George Weasley stood next to the fireplace -- chatting to the Minister of all people -- whilst wearing a drab-looking grey sweatshirt.  It looked innocuous enough from the back, but Draco had been privileged enough to see the front in all its glory.
“I don’t want that,” Harry said softly, more to himself than anyone else.  Draining the remnants of his drink, he turned a determined gaze on his friend.  “Okay, so tell me more about this Felix.”
It wasn't the most comfortable of positions: pressed side-by-side, unable to move apart or lounge on the sofa.  Harry bore it stoically.  Malfoy, as was to be expected, not so much.
Hermione gave a slight shrug and let it go.  "I just wanted to give him these," she said, rifling through her handbag and producing a sheaf of glossy leaflets and flyers.
"Yes, Weasley, my answer is the same as it was the ten other times you asked me this morning."
"No."  Draco bristled.  "I'm not a complete coward."
#16 Malfoy Manor
“This is the third one in as many weeks.” Harry ran a hand through his hair.  “I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but it’s just not that easy.”
"Honestly, you two were so caught up in that Romeo and Juliet bullshit you carved out for yourselves, that neither of you realised no one really cared." He pauses then, ensures he has Harry's attention before continuing. "Well, Draco's parents do, but…" Blaise gives a little
"Thank you."  And never before in his life had Draco meant those words so much.  It wasn't until the threat of it was completely removed, that he understood just how much of a weight the impending marriage had been on his shoulders.  And it was a further sign of his relief that rather than plotting Pansy's imminent demise for her interference, he was actually planning a visit to Honeydukes on her behalf.
Harry shook his head firmly.  "No.  I didn't want him to.  There's little enough private about my life as it is – I don't want anyone messing around in my thoughts."
"Yeah, he's okay, I suppose."
to hang out with him?"
Nothing had happened, but just enjoying the closeness of being in the same bed as Draco had been a wonderful experience for Harry.  Intimacy was not something that came easily to him – having been starved of affection during his formative years, Harry had struggled to learn how to show it to others.  But with Draco it seemed to be second nature.
Harry slid a teasing hand under the hem of Draco's jumper, fingers feathering over the taut skin of his belly.  "I can't take the credit, I'm afraid.  Hermione did the tree, and Neville made the garlands."
"Are we still talking about Blaise?"  Pansy asked.  "You're becoming obsessed."
Whatever Draco might have said in response died on his lips at the sound of the front door opening, followed by Harry's voice.
Ron and Hermione's new home was a quintessentially English cottage tucked away in a quiet corner of an even quieter Wiltshire village.  And Harry loved it.  Grimmauld Place was no longer as dank and oppressive as it had been in the days of the Order, but Harry still preferred to spend as little time there as possible.
It's hard to say who's more surprised by the words – Harry certainly hadn't intended to say them. But he's not taking them back. Not when they're already three years too late.
"Potter," she said shortly.
Harry rolled his eyes; apparently death hadn't mellowed Snape at all.
Harry got up and pointedly slid another couple of slices in the toaster.  “What?” he asked finally, taking pity on his friend who was clearly about to burst.
From the look on his face it was evident that Draco did not agree.  "It was the clothes that were the final straw for Mother," he continued.
Blaise shrugs. "I told you, I
Harry never read the damn thing – his life had featured one too many times on the glossy rag's pages for his liking – so he pushed it in Malfoy's direction.
If Harry hadn't known better, he would have sworn Ginny smirked.
If possible, Harry's cheeks burned brighter.  Which was ridiculous, really.  All of his friends knew how he lived and yet, despite their numerous comments on it, he'd never felt embarrassed before, so why it should suddenly bother him now was a mystery.  Maybe it was because of what Malfoy did for a living, or because Astoria was watching him, distaste clear on her pretty face, or maybe it was something else altogether... he just didn't know.
He didn't have things on his mind, worries that would distract him, and his preferred location in the library was as peaceful as always.
"Draco, you've been going out with her for two years.  You can't blame the girl for getting impatient."
Draco found himself on the receiving end of a particularly sharp elbow dig – in the process of squirming away from it, he ended up wearing a large portion of his own drink.    "Bloody hell, Potter."  He began dabbing futilely at sodden wool of his jumper.  "I'm soaking wet now."
"Then deal with it," Hermione replied succinctly.  "Be a man and ask him again.  It's not like you're asking him to shack up with you.  Are you?"
"Looks that way," Draco replied miserably.  "Unless..."
and Harry."
Blaise stepped forward at that point and placed a bottle of champagne into each of Draco's hands.  "A little house-warming present from both of us."
Draco walked back behind his desk and sank into chair with a sigh.  He winced when the slamming of the outer door echoed through the room and announced Astoria's departure from the building.
"And?" Hermione prodded when the silence dragged on.
"How many of those has he had?" Harry asked quietly.
Draco watched as Harry rolled his shoulders, evidently trying to work out some knots.  Draco's fingers itched to help him with that, but he was fairly sure they weren't at
A moment's silence followed.  Snape appeared lost in his own thoughts, and as Harry and Draco looked at each other uncertainly, it was clear neither of them wanted to disturb him.
"Special request from Mr Malfoy."  The girl -- Emily, Harry's brain supplied suddenly -- blushed a little at this and then promptly disappeared before he could reply.
"Oh."  Harry sank down onto the sofa, the plastic covers crinkling loudly under him.  "I thought she liked me now."
“I look forward to it,” Harry lied because really what else could he say.
“Ron,” Harry said warningly through a mouthful of crisps.
"Blaise's fault," Harry replied.  Every movement hurt; even talking.
"I thought we were meant to be interviewing Petrovic this afternoon?"
," George replied, his tone taking a serious turn.  "You did a good thing here, Harry.  Not many people would have helped Malfoy out, especially considering your history."
"I'm not sure the no would hurt any less," Harry admits, and something clenches painfully in his chest as if to bear out the truth of his words.
"It really doesn't bother you?"
Hermione shook her head again.  "Do I get congratulated for being fertile then?"
Hermione shot Ron a reproving look before turning her attention to Harry.  "How are you getting along with Professor Snape?"
Harry grinned and reached out to ruffle Draco's hair.  "I don't need another elf," he replied evenly.  "Why d'you think I asked
Draco’s eyes narrowed and he opened his mouth to give his friend a patented Malfoy tongue-lashing. However, Blaise beat him to it.
what he had in mind."  Then his tongue was back to tracking its path down past Harry's navel, and Harry made a mental note to say thank you to Blaise at work on Monday.
"Don't get up," Hermione says, as both Harry and Draco move to do so.  "Harry, we'll get the bill on the way out.  It's our turn.  And, Draco, it's been lovely to catch up with you.  We should do this again."
But right now, Blaise Zabini has the worst fucking timing ever.
"No." Harry slid down off the worktop and tried his best to keep anger off his face.
"Too far," Harry muttered in reply, his words somewhat muffled as he turned his attentions to Draco's neck.
The fact that Malfoy was right didn't make it any less an unpleasant truth to hear. Harry got up from his chair and pushed it under a table with a loud scrape. "Fine, I'll get out of your way then. Pardon me for living in my own home."
Draco shook his head.  "Robards dropped by while you were
“If there is, Draco can’t find it.  And believe me, he’s tried.  If he keeps this up, I’ll end up having to hire one of those damn snow machines.”
"Fine," he gritted out eventually.  "If that's how you want." Harry left then, as quickly as possible, without waiting to hear Malfoy's reply – he'd heard enough for one day.
"Fuck off, Blaise."  Draco's eyes darted warily towards the door.  "Mother hears you joking about that, I won't get a moment's peace.   Now, if you don't mind, it's been a long day and I just want to get into bed.  After tonight, I've got a lot of thinking to do."
If Ron had expected remorse, he was to be sorely disappointed.  Ginny simply grinned and gave a brief nod.  "Yes, and I'll do it again if you don't stop being an arse.  So Harry's friends with Malfoy – who cares?  And yes, Hermione's sneaking around with Terry Boot and thinks we're all too dumb to notice, but that's hardly any concern of yours anymore, is it, Ronald?"
"Still," Ron persisted.  "It's not normal behaviour, is it?"
"It's about trust," their instructor says as he assigns them into pairs.  "About building relationships with your teammates."
Malfoy, on the other hand, remained frozen.  His mouth open in shock.
"You'll be round tomorrow night, won't you?" Harry asked as they walked nearer.
Ron looked like he very much disagreed, but any comment he was likely to have made was washed away by Neville's stunned declaration of
“Of me?” Harry frowned, because that didn’t make any sense.
Malfoy seemed unfazed, which only annoyed Harry further. "I was just talking Hermione through my design plans.
There was an odd sort of affection in Draco's tone as he spoke.  Harry wanted to point out that Hermione was
Harry couldn't help it – he pulled back in surprise.  "You do?"
"She's refusing to visit the house," Neville added.  "Says she won't condone it."
"Potter."  There followed the crunching sound of approaching footsteps in the snow.
Whilst not necessarily a fan of the cold – it had a tendency to turn the tip of his nose pink – Draco couldn’t help but appreciate the aesthetic beauty of a crisp winter morning in Hogsmeade.  Despite the low temperatures, the sun shone brightly in a clear blue sky, and it was still early enough in the day that the ground was coated with a fine dusting of frost.
It was an effort for Harry to quash the laugh this provoked. "Oh, so is this like
"So why are you telling me now?" Harry demands.
Which, in itself, wasn't the worst way to pass a Friday evening, but the beer was undrinkable, the pulsing music was doing little to soothe nagging headache he'd nursed all day, and Blaise was currently eyeing up every male in the establishment, apparently with the intent of propositioning them on Harry's behalf.
Harry grins at this and eases the bundle from under Neville's arm.  He hasn't worked here long enough to witness one before, but he's heard enough about them to know Draco is onto a loser before he even starts.  Neville doesn’t cut corners, not where his plants are concerned.
Draco could taste the Carbonara already.  "Which ballet is it?"
"There's no interrogation, Harry." Hermione filled her own glass with a healthy splash of wine. "I just want to see how my friends are doing. I care about you. What's wrong with that?"
"Whatever," Harry mutters.  Then takes his opportunity to drag Malfoy around, towing him up the stairs at speed.
“He noticed, Harry.” Luna paid his warning no heed.  “And don’t think I didn’t notice you looking too.”
"Harry." Blaise firmly inserts himself into Harry's path across the room to where Draco stands at the bar.
"I'm off to the library."  Harry tried to keep his tone as neutral as possible – it didn't take much to set Ron off these days, and he knew better than to accost Hermione, the true target of his irritation.  "I've got homework to do," Harry added for good measure.
"They'll know soon enough."  Harry grinned and held his hand out.  "Come on; we'll be late.  I told Andromeda we'd meet her five minutes ago."
"Thank you," he said softly. "It'll probably be a while before those empty ones get filled, though."
chose, because sex notwithstanding, there was no one he would rather spend the rest of his life with.
“Don’t care,” Draco muttered, sliding cold hands under Harry’s jumper and over the smooth, warm skin of his back.  “Waited too long already.”  He pulled Harry into a bruising kiss that seemed to go on forever -- or at least until the whistles and catcalls sounded from their kitchen, interrupting the moment.
Pansy relaxed and eased back into her chair. Ron was still watching Harry carefully. "You okay, mate?"
"Seeing if we can help your Mrs Morrison understand where your preferences lie."
"Okay, it
"He likes me?"  It was the only part of the conversation Harry could focus on.  He'd spent so long telling himself that Draco was out of reach, admiring him from afar, that the sudden realisation of possibilities was rather terrifying.
"Draco?" Harry wondered if he was actually still asleep, because a dream – or a nightmare – seemed the only logical explanation. "But they're
"Pansy, please.  This is neither the time nor the place."  Draco cast a quick, hunted look around the room.
Just as Draco was debating the merits of changing out of his pyjamas, the Floo sounded, quickly followed by Blaise's arrival in the kitchen.
Draco's eyes followed his best friend around the room, watching as he scowled darkly and helped himself to a cup of coffee.  No words were spoken between them until Blaise was also seated at the table.
No sooner had he sank onto the bench at Hermione's side, than she batted his hands away.  "Let me," she replied tersely, and then promptly slid the knot into place with just a little more force than Harry felt was necessary.
Luna gave a little shrug.  “It’s my wedding day.  He can’t be mad at me today.”
Draco chuckled.  “She always was good at the
Without warning, Draco pushed Harry firmly against the wall, and swallowed the
Harry leant forward so his lips were a hair’s breadth away from Draco’s ears.  “You’ll see,” he murmured, and did not miss the shiver that ran through Draco’s body in response.
