Draco relaxed marginally but kept his frown. “Well, I hope you enjoy it,” he said, nodding to the coffee in Harry’s hand.
“It’s fine. Look, I have to get going.”
“What the hell?” Draco exclaimed, dodging out of the way at the last second. He became even angrier when he noticed who almost ran him down. “Seriously, Potter? What are you even doing here?”
Harry wasn’t paying attention as he rounded the corner with his full cart and almost knocked Draco off his feet.
“Sorry, I’ll just leave,” Harry muttered, deciding to give up. He drained the last of his coffee and stood to leave. He started to make his way to the door, but turned around to Draco standing with his arms crossed where he left him. “It was nice to see you, Malfoy.” Draco’s surprised face was the last thing he saw as the door swung shut behind him.
Harry smiled and said, “I’ll never forget what she did for me. How is she?”
“Please tell her hello for me,” Harry grinned. “I’m glad she’s doing well.”
Draco’s frown deepened. “I really don’t need the savior of the wizarding world checking up on me. I’m here to get away from all of that bullshit.”
Harry nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. “Well, I guess I’ll see you around.”
Harry ran his fingers through his hair out of habit, but he didn’t know what he was so nervous about. It’s not like Draco would attack him. And it seemed like they should be past that point anyway after Harry’s impassioned speech in Draco’s-- and his mother’s-- defense and Draco’s albeit reluctant thank you afterwards. Yeah, Harry felt pretty confident that this would be fine. Right?
“Thanks. It’s good. So erm… how are you?” Harry asked, feeling miserably awkward.
Harry sputtered. “Er… I was just um passing by when I smelled the coffee. I haven’t had any yet this morning and it smelled too good to pass up. I swear I didn’t know you worked here.”
They stood awkwardly for a few minutes. Harry couldn’t take it anymore and broke the silence. “Err… how’s work?”
However, by the time he reached the front of the line, Draco had whispered to one of his coworkers and disappeared to the back. Harry tried to suppress the surge of disappointment at Draco’s retreating back. He ordered some coffee in a mindless fog and settled down near the doorway to drink it. On an impulse, he decided to wait until Draco came back out. The least he could do was say hello. But as the minutes passed with no sign of him, Harry was plagued with doubts. Maybe he should just leave Draco alone. It seems like that’s what he wants, since he’s clearly hiding.
“Apparently,” Draco smirked, before brushing past him. Harry turned to keep going up the aisle, when Draco called out to him, “Wait.” Harry paused and looked back. Draco frowned, but said, “My mother wanted me to thank you again for your testimony.”
The next time Harry saw Draco was a few months later. Well, that wasn’t exactly true. He had made a habit of walking past the coffee shop and peeking in if he was in the area, which wasn’t often. Grimmauld Place was not very close and Harry was spending his time off traveling. It was nice to see Draco laughing with his coworkers. But he didn’t go in again. The next time he actually spoke to Draco was at a grocery store near the coffee shop.
Harry’s temper flared to match Draco’s, but he took a deep breath. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t paying enough attention. Are you okay?”
Just as Harry was sipping the dregs of his coffee and about to give up, Draco appeared and made determined strides toward him. “What are you doing here?” Draco demanded.
The first time Harry saw Draco after the trial was in Muggle London. At a coffee shop, of all places. And the weirdest part is… he seemed to work there? He knew that Draco was under strict no-magic monitoring as part of his probation, even though Draco got back his wand, after he, Harry, had almost demanded it, but he still never expected to see this. He supposed he hadn’t given Draco much thought since the war ended. He knew that Draco had done even worse on his final exams than Harry had, but they both passed and didn’t need to go back to Hogwarts after all. But after hearing nothing more, not even in the papers-- not that he was looking for any mention of Draco, because he definitely wasn’t-- but Harry had assumed Draco was hiding out back at the Manor not... cleaning espresso machines.
“Hogwarts, dear?” Madam Malkin asked him with a kind smile. Before Harry could answer, the witch prattled on. “Got the lot here - another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”
“it’s safe here. All the house-elves have gone to bed. It’s only Dobby and us here.” Bursting with questions, Harry looked around for the infamous Dobby, who he didn’t spot amongst the numerous pots and pans laid to rest.
“Congratulations.” Someone familiar whispered from the doorway. Harry whirled around to face Draco.
“I’ve found him!’ he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here – listen to this: “Professor Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel”!”

“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once . . . might’ve been Bill. . . .”
He dried himself off and got dressed for bed before heading to his dormitory. He knew he had double potions tomorrow with the Gryffindors and hoped he would steal harry away afterward.
written in a messy red scrawl. Harry immediately glanced at Ron, who was holding up his hand too. He suddenly wished Hermione hadn’t come in looking for Neville’s toad.
“Harry, what was that all about?” said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. “I couldn’t hear anything. . . .”
“I’d like that, Draco.”
“LUCIUS,” It was his grandfather. From his place on the floor, Draco watched them draw their wands, but his head hurt too much from the place where it hit the chair.
“That’s disgusting Pansy.” He didn’t realize almost everyone else seemed to be following his lead when Marcus nodded in agreement.
“You look sad,” Harry said quietly, still looking up at him as if he expected Draco to confess something.
“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” He heard Crabbe crack his knuckles and knew he had to stop it now. The Crabbe family spent an unusual amount of time teaching their children hexes and jinxes, Draco had already seen what they had done on a few muggle-born first year hufflepuffs they had encountered earlier.
“It’s not something I can just
Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.
The air outside was crisp, and Draco felt a strange sense of déjà vu as he stood at the edge of the great lake that morning. Draco had asked Professor Snape what he had meant when he said he did not believe Harry, but the professor had been stone-cold silent as he escorted Draco down to the dungeons.
“Why are you here, Malfoy?” Harry had never addressed him as Malfoy when it was just the two of them before.
“Yes, Harry, yes we can.”
“Oh yeah? They cheat during quidditch all the time, using illegal moves! Almost every single dark wizard ¬is Slytherin. Voldemort is Slytherin!” Harry glared at Hermione and Ron, who both cringed when he mentioned the name. Hermione noticed that Draco hadn’t cringed or reacted at all. Surprisingly, it was Draco who answered Harry.
“What?” Harry turned over and stared at Draco incredulously. “I didn’t know you were that much of a nerd.” Draco smiled back at him, knowing Harry hadn’t meant it in an unkind way.
Chapter 1 has been edited/revised.
“It’s not that difficult. My mom hired a tutor for me last year so most of what we’re doing in school isn’t new.” Harry glared at Draco and turned back to the sky.
“I hope you have a great year, son.” His mother said, giving him a warm hug. He smiled in return, hugging her back. When pulling away, he noticed her soul mark of his father’s name glowing faintly emerald, with the tiny rose blooms around them.
“Professor Snape.” Draco glanced at the head of his house, suddenly nervous as to how much he had heard of his conversation in the DADA classroom.
“Draco.” Narcissa had bent down to his level and was hugging him fiercely. He felt a few tears leak out. “Son, I’m sorry I forbade you from seeking out your soulmate. I realize it is an impossible feat.” They just hugged for a long period of time.
The day was warm, and the sun shone down on the grey waves, making it look like a kaleidoscope of silver and blue. He noticed the blonde boy sitting against a tree by the lake and hurried toward him, grateful no one else was around.
He placed a hand on Ginny’s shoulder and watched Draco become angrier still. He could hear Ron and Hermione coming over and didn’t care. All he wanted to do was make Draco as jealous as possible. He completely missed the loaded stare Hermione gave Draco as the five of them stood there in silence, the air becoming more charged as more time passed.
“Unless you get out, right now,” Harry replied, finally having gotten over the shock of what Draco had said. Draco chuckled and pulled his two friends away.
“Draco?” Narcissa’s eyes were red too, although he couldn’t quite place if it was because she was tired, sleepy or had been crying.
“keep this information a secret.” Draco nodded profusely, still staring at the man.
“Yes, dear?”
“Draco!” Someone said from beside him, and he looked up to see Blaise.
The further they walked, the weaker his father seemed to become, almost as if he was losing consciousness. By the time Draco reached the door of Borgin and Burke’s, his side was burning and he was panting as if he had run a marathon.
“I wish father didn’t exist so-“

“Do not give them power over you, Miss Granger.” She looked right into the girl’s brown eyes. “Do not let them distraught you. Your blood is what makes you strong, it is what makes you special.” She smiled at the girl for the first time. It may have been the first time she smiled at any student at all. “Do not let the word have power to oppress you.” She stood up from the table, knowing she had said enough.
“Hi Harry.” Draco felt a little shy at Ron’s presence but understood why Ron had to know.
“Mr. Malfoy.” Madam Pomfrey, it seemed, didn’t always join the feast.
“I don’t know.”
“I know Harry.” Draco’s chest felt heavy. It was an unfamiliar feeling of fear that he had never experienced before. Fear for Harry.
Early Sunday morning, Hermione was at the library before any other student. Madam Pince watched the girl walk in and didn’t frown nor follow her movements suspiciously. The young witch was one of very few students she trusted within the library, and she was convinced Miss Granger would someday become a successful and influential person.
“I missed you, Harry.” He whispered into Harry’s neck and wasn’t exactly sure if Harry heard him until he felt Harry squeeze tighter.
Draco cried the whole night, and she couldn't do anything other than hold him, her heart heavy for what was happening to his soulmate. She was grateful for once that Lucius no longer visited her there, under the stars. It seemed as if he had forgotten about their spot long ago.
Draco scowled, but muttered, “I’m fine, no thanks to you.”
As he processed this, he stood frozen in the doorway, and it was actually causing a bit of a traffic jam. Enough of one that Draco glanced up at the commotion and met his eyes. Which did not help his being-frozen thing, but it looked like Draco was frozen halfway through wiping down a piece of machinery too. They just stared at each other for a long moment. Until Harry caught an elbow to the ribs and let out a huff of surprise. He dropped his eyes and moved out of the way of his fellow commuters, smiling sheepishly at them. As penance, he let everyone pass him and took a place at the very back of the line.
He couldn’t be apart from Crabbe and Goyle for long though. The two boys found him as soon as they entered the castle and prodded him about what he had gotten for Christmas all the way down to the dormitories. He made the mistake of mentioning the Nimbus 2001 and wasn’t left alone until they each had to go get dressed for dinner.
“Master Lucius.” The house elf prostrated himself before Lucius, which made the man uncomfortable.
“Hermione Granger’s in there,” Draco whispered to Harry, eyes darting around the empty hallway. “How about we go back to yesterday’s spot?” Harry nodded eagerly and the two boys took off, keeping a distance between them but still walking side-by-side.
“So do soulmate names show up at the same place?” Harry asked curiously, glancing from Ron to Hermione. Hermione broke her gaze away from Ron to Harry as if she was suddenly realizing he was there as well.
“I certainly will not, it’s mine.” She whisper-yelled back.
“What does he do?” The boy asked curiously.
Also, a special shout out to everyone who commented on Chapter 4! You are the reason I was motivated enough to put this out so quickly.
She was never the kind of woman to beat around the bush, and although he didn't rememebr his first conversation with her regarding his soulmark (probably because it was less of a conversation and more of her telling him never to utter those words a loud, ever), he knew it was a secret that he should guard, always. Draco's mother had told him everything about this Harry Potter, how and why he was famous, and why Draco couldn't be together ith him because of his father's alliances.
curse, or if the Dark Lord was just taking up residence in his mind entirely.
“Five points from Slytherin, each.” Snape looked as if it pained him physically to say so as Draco and Blaise shuffled in.
“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.
“Is the coast clear for me to go back, Dobby?” The little elf apparated to Draco’s dorm and nodded, leaving to lead Harry back to his own before he got caught.
“I say, look at that man!” the boy said suddenly, nodding toward the window. Hagrid stood there, grinning at Harry with two large ice creams in his hands.
“Who’s Dobby?” Harry asked Draco curiously. Draco went on to explain how the house-elf was his protector, and then about what house-elves were.
“Harry James Potter, sit down.”
“I said sit down.” Harry sat.
“What do you have after lunch?” Draco yelled as they began to run back.
haven’t
When Harry Potter was born, his young parents gazed at the beautiful form of their precious baby boy with all the love and adoration in the world. Lily, still sweaty and exhausted from the birth, nestled into the pillows behind her with her son in her arms.
“Hagrid?”
“And why, Salamander’s blood?” At this, Draco did not seem to have the answer. Hermione’s arm was still in the air.
Tom said, and so she did. She felt it slither past her, felt its shadow on her that raised goosebumps on her skin. She smelt the damp and the mould as it slithered away, and when she opened her eyes again, the sinks were back where they were supposed to be and the moon had come out of the clouds it had been hiding under.
Harry sat on a bathroom stall much later into the day, eyes scouring over Draco’s writing.
“Your mother told me years ago.” Draco gaped at the man as he sat down on the chair Blaise had just vacated. “It is imperative that you and your
“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. “Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere —”
Harry reached for another sandwich, realizing the plate replenished itself as they ate. “I wish our marks were more visible, I heard they glow, or flowers sprout up around them when you’re around your soulmate.” Draco went a little pink but nodded in agreement. “But its helpful in hiding it too, I guess, given our current situation.”
“Do you think we could sneak into the kitchens?” Harry whispered quietly as he took Draco’s hand. Draco instantly felt warmer and less scared, although a nagging voice inside his head reminded him that he had not forgiven Harry yet.
“Miss Granger.” Her voice was as strict as ever as she regarded the young witch bent over a book. “I shall have to ask you to
“Slytherins are great. What do you mean I’m not like other Slytherins?” Harry felt a little annoyed. Surely Draco wasn’t being serious?
doesn’t seem to be here.” Pansy egged him on. Draco knew that Pansy believed Hermione was his soulmate, and although most of his friends didn’t really believe the baseless idea, it still irked him whenever Pansy mentioned it.
“He really is a prick,” Draco commented from his hiding place after Snape had limped away, making Harry laugh and pull him up. “He’ll probably come looking for me to give my book back.” Draco was already heading back towards the castle. “I’ll see you at the match, Harry!” the three of them watched Draco runoff before slowly making it back to the castle themselves.
“Which one, mate?” The boy shrugged again, looking a little sad.
“I can help you with your essay if you want?” Draco offered quietly.
She glanced down at Draco's torso, knowing his soulmate had been born in the late hours of last night. There, nestled between his ribs, was his soul mate’s name etched in gold handwriting.
, so satisfying to finish. Once he had read every single thing there was to know about the fire protection spell, he switched to his transfigurations essay which wasn’t due for a whole week.
“Lucius?” He turned around at the familiar voice, Abraxus stood in the middle of the hallway. His father looked so old.
“Don’t be silly Sirius. Who else would it be but you?” Sirius wanted to say more but, the doorbell rang and Lilly stood up to go answer it.
“I didn’t say Draco was bad. At the time, at least.” Hermione frowned.
“I do not know, son. I will be able to tell you more once I visit Harry. For now, I will send up food and tea. You will eat and then write to Hermione or Ron immediately. Your father cannot know you are unwell.”
“Don’t talk, Potter.” A familiar voice drawled from behind him. Harry felt his stomach drop. He wasn’t exactly sure if it was fear or excitement though. The boy removed his hand so Harry could turn around to face Draco Malfoy. His hair was slicked back, and had deeper golden tones in them than the platinum he thought it was, and his grey eyes were shining. Harry didn't realize he was holding his breath until Draco started to talk.
“I haven’t spoken to Dobby in a while. I’ve been angry at him since I found out he intercepted your letters, Harry.” Harry’s eyes widened first in anger then curiosity.
“Master must protect Harry Potter.” Dobby said fearfully.
“We already told him we haven’t seen it,” Ron replied sounding annoyed. Harry was just glad the toadless boy was named Neville and not Draco. The girl, having noticed Ron’s wand,
I thought I might be able to finish first year, but alas, the chapter was getting too long.
“That’s Hagrid.” Harry said with a smile, forgetting momentarily his curiosity of the boy's family. “He works at Hogwarts.”
“I’ve been thinking,” Lucius said with a smirk, sipping his brandy, “we should have more children.” Narcissa squeaked, staring at her soul mate with her mouth open a little.
“It was fun though, admit it.” Harry only laughed in agreement. “I got you something.” Harry looked up to see that Draco had brought a book called
This left only one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light as he unwrapped it. Something fluid and silvery grey went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.
“It’s likely Dumbledore sent for Hagrid to retrieve something important from Gringotts,” Draco responded, chewing on a piece of cheese. “Hagrid probably removed it before the robbers got there, though.”
“Could I become an Animagus, grandfather?” Draco asked curiously as he flipped through various drawings of wizards that were stuck between human and animal forms.
“Do you two know each oth-“
“Not for dark wizards, Harry,” Harry noticed how Draco suddenly became closed off, and they finished their breakfast in silence before turning to their books.
“What do you mean?” Harry turned around, happiness deflating a little.
“Harry, whatever petrified Mrs. Norris is still loose in school!” Hermione whispered fearfully, looking from Harry to Draco to Ron. Ron was nodding in agreement almost immediately.
“I want to be one of them. I am one of them.” Sirius gestured to James, who was now pretending to bite Harry’s chubby little legs as Harry attempted to free himself by screaming at the top of his lungs. Lilly wondered if Mary and Marlene could get there a little sooner, the Marauders were difficult enough to handle by themselves, but it seemed that Harry was an exact replica of their ways. The baby adored Sirius, and if she wasn't careful, Harry would turn out to be just as bad.
,” Snape said the word friends as if he were saying
Narcissa smiled softly at her son as he determinedly waved his grandfather’s wand around. It’s had several childproofing spells cast on it so the most it could do was to choke out sparks of various colors, which entertained Draco more than anything.
“I’m okay, Draco!” Harry insisted quietly, but Draco looked at his soulmate right in the eye for a moment, which made him take it and wrap it around him. It gave Draco a strange sense of happiness to see Harry, the perfect Gryffindor in Slytherin colours. As they began to discuss last night’s happenings.
His stomach lurched —
Harry noticed Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on. He hoped this wouldn’t be an explosive event, the last time the four of them had been in the same place he had lost his two best friends and his soulmate in one swell swoop. He hoped, maybe, now that Ron and Hermione were friends with him again, he could maybe win Draco back as well.
So there he sat, on his staircase, groaning quietly to himself with tears running down his pale cheeks as each kick and punch reverberated through his body.
Potions was Draco’s favorite class, but he grew increasingly upset as Professor Snape kept making unkind jabs at Harry and his friends, taking points away from Gryffindor for no reason. He wondered if he could complain about Snape to his father, but knew Lucius couldn’t care any less.
“You were in the infirmary?” Harry asked as he stuffed a book into his bag and slung it over his shoulder. Draco didn’t meet Harry’s eyes but nodded.
Ron had gone a little pale, Harry couldn’t tell if it was because he was annoyed his spell didn’t work or because of how fast the girl had spoken.
“Write to me and keep me updated then.” Hermione was also not going to be at Hogwarts for Christmas. She was going to France with her parents. Before Draco could reply, the morning bell rang, and they rushed back towards the castle. They all had Potions together and ran all the way to the dungeons.
“SHH!” Harry shushed Draco and took his hand so they were running side by side. Draco could feel Harry’s excitement as they ran up the staircase and along a first-floor corridor. Draco felt as if he had told Harry he needed space in another life.
They chatted into the night, all realizing no one had discovered anything about Nicholas Flammel. Draco felt quite frustrated by their lack of improvement it was almost as if they were sitting ducks. He went back to his dorm and sat in bed for hours thinking about what he could do better. His mind felt like a mess. At last, with sleep evading him for hours in bed, he pulled out his new quill set and began to write.
“Well, well, well — Arthur Weasley.” It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder, sneering in just the same way. The two of them looked almost identical, and Harry could feel his hatred amplify.
On the day of the first snow, sometime close to Christmas, Harry quietly snuck into the Slytherin common room. The sun wasn’t even up yet, and the boy was starting to grow recklessly bold in wanting to see Draco. He had known the password for a long time because he and Draco liked to joke around about sneaking into each other’s dorms. Harry felt thrilled at actually being able to do it.
Don’t be ridiculous. He thought to himself as he heard Lucius Malfoy’s haughty voice mocking Mr. Weasely. Draco was rich and could get anything he ever wanted, with parents who probably bought him whatever he wanted, too. Draco was nothing like Harry, the universe had just made a grave mistake pairing the two of them together.
“You do understand why it has to be a secret, don’t you, Weasley?”
“I’ve heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched.” If only Ron knew that his father still was.
Until one day, in the heat of July, Dobby finally managed to corner him in his grandfather’s study. Draco looked up from the book about transfiguration he has been taking notes on, and into the big eyes of the elf dressed in a raggedy old pillowcase.
“You’re lucky almost everyone’s gone home for the holidays.” Draco sighed. “Just let me know beforehand so we don’t get caught, okay?”
“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,” he said.
She got out of bed and padded to Draco's nursery in her dressing gown. While there were several elves, squibs, and even a wizard nanny to mind Draco throughout the day, she had begun to carry out Draco's morning routine herself, something her parents wouldn't be too happy about. "
“I was in the library. Wanted to start on that transfigurations essay.” He noticed Hermione glance at him, but she went back to her food almost immediately as Ron began to complain about said essay.
So you can beat me fair and square next time!
“Aren’t you a talkative one, then.” She smiled at the bird while scratching the side of her head.
“Congratulations on becoming the seeker,” Draco muttered, edging closer to Harry. Harry laid his head on Draco’s shoulder and smiled.
“I don’t know. Ask Draco! He’s the richest!!” Draco went a little red but shrugged his shoulders.
“Is it true?” He asked the startled-looking boy, “they’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in the compartment. So, it’s you, is it?” He wished the boy would shake his, no, but Harry Potter was not the kind to do so.
“May I know who said it?” Hermione looked unsure for a few moments before responding with the name.
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back to the Gryffindor common room, Harry noticed Ron and Hermione holding hands and finally felt happy for his two friends. The night’s ordeal with the troll hadn’t been an easy one, but he couldn’t help but feel a spark of jealousy at the ease with which Ron and Hermione spent time together.
His cries were the worst, and no number of soft words she spoke could console the unconscious boy. The snowy owl which had been asleep in her cage had begun screeching in protest as well, as if her master’s cries pained her. After several hours of charms, she sat down next to Harry and fed him a potion for nutrition and healing, which calmed his restless body significantly.
“You’re not even picking up as many. Not used to doing your own work, Malfoy?” Draco glared at Harry and bent down to pick up a pixie, trying his best to keep a neutral face as he did so. Hermione and Ron shared a glance, unsure if they should intervene or not.
Madame Pince gave Harry a nod when he re-entered with a few bread rolls hidden in his bag. He went to his usual spot in the library and continued reading about how Leta Lestrange had helped defeat Grindelwald. When he had finished reading about her, he went back to his potions work, determined to be able to answer Snape’s questions next time.
“Professor Snape?”
Draco was just ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione when he got looped into cleaning up the pixie mess Lockhart had created. He was seriously reconsidering not going to madam Pomfrey about his side, maybe he had hit the side of the train when one of the Wesley’s hexed him on the train two days ago.
“I hate Snape,” Harry said hotly under his breath before Snape began his usual drawl about herbs and potions.
He pushed his dinner away, appetite lost at the cheers and howls that were coming from the other three houses.
August 19th, 1992
Your friend,
Draco was waiting by the corridor that led to the portrait of the fat lady, eyes wide when Harry Ron and Hermione made their way there. Harry took one look at Draco and knew that they had to talk, whatever differences or breaks he and Draco were going through.
It was the most miserable Harry had ever been at Hogwarts, Hermione and Ron sat as far away from him as possible, and it seemed as if all their friends had moved with them. Not even the delicious meals that appeared on the table before him one after another could lift his spirits up. He glanced across the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables to the other end of the hall to spot Draco, but his usual spot next to Blaise and Pansy was empty as well.
“I go to school here too, Harry. And last I checked, Lockhart asked all of us to clean up, not just you.” Harry glared at Draco and picked up several immobilized pixies off the floor.
“Do you want something to eat, Harry?” Draco asked quietly, and Harry only nodded, still gazing into the fire. A stool, two glasses of milk, and a heaping plate of cookies appeared between them almost immediately.
“Dad?” he hadn’t intended for his voice to sound so vulnerable, but his throat felt drier than ever, and the headache had returned in full force. Something akin to realization passed through his father’s features before he came toward Lucius.
“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
What had he done? He had let the fame get to his head. He had been no better than Dudley. He looked up at the Head table, hoping to catch Professor Dumbledore’s eye, but caught Snape staring at him instead. He looked away, wondering why Snape was so interested in him all of a sudden.
Narcissa woke from a good night’s sleep which had only been disturbed by Lucius getting out of bed sometime in the middle of the night at the Dark Lord’s call. She worried about her soulmate being overworked, especially because the Dark Lord had expressed a renowned interest in him. Usually, attention from Him meant that they were either doing a very good job, or they were about to face His wrath, but she knew they were both loyal to the cause, so she wasn't afraid for their safety.
Why was there a troll in the dungeons last year? Why couldn’t a great wizard like Dumbledore take down a troll? How did a troll even enter a heavily warded and protected institution such as Hogwarts?
Harry woke up the next morning feeling a little too well-rested. He stretched happily on the bed and stared out the window, expecting his usual view of the school grounds. Instead, a kelpie was bumping again and again against the glass and his view of the school grounds was replaced by the inside of the great lake. Harry shot up in bed to come face to face with Draco, who had already showered and dressed and was reading a book on the edge of the bed.
“He and I have nothing to talk about, ‘Mione.”
“Then I suppose they have rejected you as well?” Blaise laughed. Draco stared at his friend, concerned. Blaise shrugged in response.
She could hear her father saying sternly as her mother turned up her nose, never the one to speak against Cygnus. She smiled softly when she saw her baby awake, and patiently waiting. He wasn't a fussy baby at all, her Draco. He seemed to be infinitely aware and patient with everyone around him. He was clutching a blanket in his chubby arms and wiggled around his cot, cooing when he saw his mother. She picked him up gently and brought him over to the changing table.
was definitely a male name. He also knew what uncle Vernon's views on
Harry was following Percy with the rest of the Gryffindor's first years, tired to the bone after his first supper at Hogwarts when a hand, pulled him into an alcove. He nearly screamed but the same hand fastened around his mouth firmly before he could do so.
“So did I, that’s why I went looking for professor McGonagall to explain why you were flying.” Harry looked up at Draco suddenly, a smile etched on his face.
Harry was sitting miserably in Lockhart’s office signing fan mail when he heard the voice. It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.
“The Dark Lord demands everything from his followers,” Abraxas said softly, feeling sorry for his daughter-in-law. He only knew that his son was given a diary, but of its contents, he knew nothing.
So after seating his father on an odd looking chair he went about snooping through all the packages and bags they had been carrying. Alas, no diary.
“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. “What are you doing? It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside.”
“Again?” Draco whispered to Ron, who looked bewildered but not worried. Why had no one told him Harry was hearing
“Lucius and I haven’t spoken properly in months.” She replied softly. Over the months as she discovered Draco’s secret, Lucius had been given something of dire importance to the Dark Lord. He was consumed by it, and he had explicitly told Narcissa in one of his lucid moments that she must not tell him anything, nor associate him. She couldn't quite figure out if he was under an
Draco said helpfully. Before Ron could complain about something more, the bell rang, and the four dispersed; Draco headed for transfigurations while the Gryffindors to History of Magic, where professor Binns would answer Hermione’s question about the chamber of secrets.
“Try this one for history of animagi, Draco.” His grandfather told him with a smile as he handed Draco a book bound in red leather.
to speak to you the way he did, today.” Draco looked up again, surprised to see a hint of kindness in the professor’s voice.
“I’m glad I beat Slytherin.” He said happily as they raced beside each other.
Harry hid inside the cupboard, covered in soot as he watched Draco and Lucius Malfoy enter Borgin and Burke’s. He could only see slivers of Draco, how thin he looked under his dark robes, how his father spoke to him harshly. Harry wondered if he and Draco were similar after all, with their troubled home lives.
“Father?” He looked even paler than usual, and the cut on his eyebrow seemed to be bleeding too much for it to just be a cut. He hesitantly took his father’s hand, and was surprised when Lucius shifted all of his weight onto Draco.
Moments after the train had taken off, the door of the compartment Harry was sitting in slid open. “Anyone sitting there?” It was the youngest red-headed boy. Harry shook his head and watched cautiously as the boy situated himself. At least Harry knew that this was not Draco. The woman had called him Ron. He was introduced to the twins, Fred and George, who came in moments later and were gone as fast as they appeared, and then Harry Potter got down to learning about his new friend, Ron Weasley, who as fate would have it, would be his best friend for life.
“So, do you know who your soulmate is?” Ron asked much later on with a mouth full of pumpkin pasties harry had bought off the trolley. Harry subconsciously touched his rib again and nodded, not offering up the name. Something in him told him maybe he shouldn't divulge the name. He glanced down at the two chocolate frog cards he now had, both empty of its occupants.
“Excuse me,” Harry tried his best to sound confident, and something about the woman made him feel comfortable. She recognized him as a Hogwarts student almost immediately. How he didn’t quite know.
“What?” he looked up at Ron, and then Hermione, who seemed to be fuming. “Are you going to force me to apologize to him? To accept him?” he was surprised by Hermione’s answer;
“Marcus Flint has really dreamy eyes, doesn’t he?” Millicent Balustrade whispered to the three of them, eliciting a giggle from Pansy.
Draco hoped no one would notice him as he snuck into the hospital. If he was lucky, everyone was down at the feast, including Granger and Weasley.
“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. “The company you keep, Weasley . . . and I thought your family could sink no lower —” There was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf.
“Ginny?” He asked her gently. The two of them had always been the closest in age, and he had always considered her his closest confidante until he had come to Hogwarts. He felt guilty for the second time that day for completely different reasons.
“Wizards are supposed ter have a soulmate yer see, ‘arry.” Hagrid explained. “Their name appears somewhere on yer body, and yer supposed to meet them in yer lifetime.” Harry’s mind reeled at the information. All his childhood, uncle Vernon had yelled at him saying his parents had branded him like a cow, not knowing the significance of the name. Harry didn't quite want to think about the fact that
Harry had gifted him a silver chain with a pendant of green stone that reminded him strongly of Harry’s eyes. He clutched the chain and cried softly into his pillow until he fell asleep.
“Oh, son. Come to the drawing room with me. That diary has taken too much from you.”
Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley’s street.
It didn’t take Harry long to find a few books on Slytherin’s history and the Wizards it had produced. He sat down on a few cushions he borrowed from the more populated parts of the library in a corner and began to read.
“Is that how money even works Ron?” Harry teased.
“Fire dwelling Salamanders, sir.”
He raced to the owlery the moment it was dawn, aware that he was also pissing off Hedwig by not using her to send his letter, but he knew she would be recognized.
Draco stared at the two empty seats next to Hermione all throughout dinner, with no appetite, still unable to stretch too far to his right or lift his right arm without a spike of pain going down his body.
Hermione looked up at Irma with reddened eyes and, “I was called a slur yesterday by someone.” She hiccupped once, then twice. Irma produced a box of tissues and handed it to the girl. It was better for her tears to be absorbed by tissues and not her precious books. “I was looking up the history, and the meaning.” Irma looked at the book and read the first line of the paragraph Hermione had been reading and understood immediately.
“Obviously not,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?” Mr. Weasley flushed dark red.
“Well, I hope I meet mine today,” Ron said with a grin, not telling Harry whose name he had either. The conversation mellowed down to Ron’s rat, and how it was a hand-me-down from Percy, his older brother. Harry glanced at the animal snoozing on Ron’s lap and felt a little uncomfortable with the animal’s appearance. It was fat and ugly, but it was also a rat so Harry paid it no mind.
“Go away, Dobby.” The elf all but vanished, unable to resist Draco’s command. Draco felt a twinge of discomfort at his ability to control Dobby so easily, but the study door opened and Abraxus came in with several books levitating next to him.
“Hey, Draco!” He ran towards the older boy with a small smile.
The four met, huddled in an alcove before lunch. Draco hugged Harry immediately, not having seen him for a while, but it certainly seemed as if the three were bursting to tell Draco something.
The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away — moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn’t matter?
“She did! I’m almost done with mine though.”
“Draco? Are you stalking us?” Harry glared at Draco as he rounded up on him.
“I got lost on my way back.” Both boys knew it was a lie, but Ron didn’t say anything more. Harry was thankful the boy didn’t.
“Young master looks sad,” Dobby said once the dorm was empty and Draco was sliding into his school robes.
“But Professor,” Hermione interjected. “Classes start at 9. It’s not 9 yet.”
“I’m fine, Harry.” He didn’t mean to be rude, and he didn’t mean to hurt Harry, but he suddenly wished he had a different life. That he wasn’t his father’s son. “Good luck with quidditch practice today.” He added more gently as they began to walk back.
Draco flew back down, landing on his feet before Marcus waved him down.
You CANNOT TELL THIS TO ANYONE. If you do, our soulmate bond will be discovered and those on the wrong side WILL use it against Harry. Please. My mother will visit Harry and help him heal, but there is no way for her to know where Harry lives. She said something about a spell that Dumbledore uses. Please send Harry’s address back to me as soon as possible.
“Milli! He’s a sixth year! Is he your soulmate?” Millicent went a little red but didn’t say anything. Pansy didn’t question the girl further but turned her attention to Draco and Blaise.
Hermione,
“The reason why I said we couldn’t be friends in public,” Draco began after finishing his second ham sandwich, “is if my father finds out, he will kill us both.” It would have been just an exaggerated statement if the conversation were happening between anyone else, but Harry understood the gravity of it immediately. “He supports you-know-who, you know. He’s not a bad guy, I swear,” Harry doubted it, but if Draco insisted, he could follow, “It’s just- it’s complicated.”
“Harry found out that Filch’s a squib.” Ron grinned.
“He’s perfect, the chap.” A new voice declared, having entered the room after the baby’s birth. Abraxas Malfoy regarded his grandson with pride and joy. The continuity of the Malfoy line. Narcissa definitely agreed with her father-in-law as she stared down at her son. The baby was indeed perfect. She knew immediately there wasn't anything she wouldn't do for her son, who had a tuft of familiar ice blonde hair atop his tiny pink head.
“Maybe-“
As much as he detested Snape, he was grateful the professor was escorting Draco back to the Slytherin dorms.
“I’ll sit next to him. I’ll hex him if he tries to hurt you again. I promise.” Harry looked up at him, green eyes fearful, and nodded. The two boys sat there for a while, just enjoying each other’s presence until Dobby pulled up, looking fearful as he announced to them that they should go to bed.
“Yes, you do.”
“Mom,” Draco felt a little dizzy as he clutched his mother’s arm.
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy. “All those raids . . . I hope they’re paying you overtime?” He reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration.
“I can.” She set her books on the table and glanced at the two boys.
“I shouldn’t have. I hurt you, and I shouldn’t have. I’ll make sure I never do anything of the sort again, Draco. I’m sorry. I really am.” He finally looked up at Draco to see that the boy’s face looked unreadable.
She glanced down at her wrist where Lucius’ name was written in emerald ink. Usually, close proximity to him would cause the letters to glitter or shine. Sometimes roses or stars would appear along the mark too, depending on their moods. Narcissa remembered a time when Lucius’ name used to be surrounded by white roses, etching into her pale skin. She remembered a time when the emerald ink used to glow so brightly she could read his name in the dark. Now, it was a lifeless dull green.
“Five points to Slytherin and Gryffindor.” Snape glared at the class.
Panic was beginning to rise within Harry, his ears felt uncomfortably warm and he tried his best not to look directly at any adults passing him by in a rush. Prior experiences with uncle Vernon abandoning him had taught him that sometimes people tended to be nosy about what such a young child was doing alone in public.
“I- what-“ Harry felt himself sputter out, his gaze moving from Ron to Hermione, to Neville, who all looked very worried.
“Potter!” Before Harry knew it, they were wrestling on the grass, and Harry laughed as he tried to get Draco off him. The boys rolled around, undoubtedly getting grass stains over everything, but at the moment, neither one of them really cared.
Harry didn’t go to lunch. He went back to his spot in the library. After reading several chapters about Leta Lestrange, Harry opened up his potions books instead. Maybe he could make some headway on his least favourite subject. He sat there in his corner until he heard the clock strike for the end of lunch and gathered up his belongings to head to transfiguration.
I heard this evening, you will still be present at tryouts this Friday and will only become seeker if you are
“Replace
“What about you boys?” She glanced nonchalantly at the Gryffindor table, where, Draco realized, harry wasn’t present. “Care to share your soulmates?” She smiled in what seemed like an uncaring way, but Draco knew that Pansy wanted to know very badly.
“Um,” Snape raised his eyebrow at Harry, pointedly ignoring Hermione’s raised arm. Then, to Harry’s surprise, Draco raised his arm as well.
“Yet they reduced her to nothing, all based on her
Harry stared at Draco, and then at the brand-new
“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Ron,” said Draco, smugly. “Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms my father’s bought our team.” Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.
Terence stayed closer to the ground, and Draco figured he was trying to start his search from the bottom up. Draco on the other hand raised his broom and began the ascent as high as he could go. With the setting sun on his back, he spotted the golden glint on the snitch easily, towards the middle of the pitch. He realized too late that Terence had spotted it as well and was speeding towards it.
“The Heir?” Draco whispered, feeling his heart beating out of his chest. They noticed Mrs. Norris, and after Ron suggested that they leave, Draco agreed vehemently. He pulled at Harry’s arm even as the younger boy tried to edge closer.
“I had a bad dream.” Harry was fidgeting with the blanket in his hands.
He liked to think back to that night and pretend his mother had come to save him.
“Are you boys keeping it a secret?” She gazed deeply into his eyes. He nodded.
“How has your first week been?”
“He says he’s done,” Ron muttered.
“Salamander’s blood sir.” Harry glanced at Draco almost forlornly as Snape redirected his attention there.
“And if Ron wants to be your friend while you are this way, that means he is enabling your behaviour, and I don’t want a soulmate who does that, either.” Harry had no words as Hermione picked up her books and left, and after staring at her empty spot for a few seconds, Ron followed her.
“Hermione?”
“I haven’t had the chance yet." Harry supposed he should ask Hagrid about the houses, and quidditch, and if he should get a broom. "I asked him about soulmates though.” Harry hoped the boy would continue the conversation, maybe tell him a little bit more but he suddenly seemed deflated. Before he could ask why Madam Malkin chipped in.
“The way Draco talked about his father though, I feel like something changed for them this summer.”
During the quidditch game, Draco managed to get to Snape faster than Ron and Hermione, though. Setting Snape’s cape on fire, which disturbed both professors Quirrell and Flitwick sitting beside him, effectively saved Harry from his manic broom. Hermione gave him a thumbs up from the other side of the stands and they went back to cheering for Slytherin and Gryffindor, respectively.
ones who weren’t terrible the way you-know-who was. I know because there are thousands of books in the library about them! So, your generalizations about Slytherins are
“What can you tell me?” Ron asked curiously, having read the letter over Harry’s shoulder. Before Harry could respond, more owls flooded the great hall. Everyone’s attention was drawn to a long thin package carried by six screech owls.
She knew, however, if she did inflict any real damage, it would be traced back to her, and everything she had worked so hard to conceal and protect, especially her son, would be destroyed. So, she walked away, boiling in rage.
“Okay
“If you practice hard enough, I certainly don’t see why not.” Abraxas chuckled as he seated himself by the fireplace. “Animagi are usually common in certain bloodlines, and I must say that the Malfoy one is not particularly known for it.”
“So it’s true then. You two are soul mates!” Draco nodded.
“Fire Dwelling Salamanders have healing and rejuvenating properties, professor. By using its blood in a fire protection spell, any burns encountered will be healed instantly.”
Potions was a miserable class, and Ron was fuming by the end of it. It wasn’t because of Snape’s general displeasure of Gryffindors, but his particular dislike towards Hermione Granger. Before Ron could catch up to Hermione, who with glassy eyes, simply fled the class as soon as Snape deemed the lesson over.
“Why do you wish your father dead, Draco?” The parcel in Draco’s robe seemed to weigh him down, but he stood up and stepped out of his mother’s shadow anyway.
“I don’t know the houses.” Harry saw a flicker of concern in the boy’s silver eyes.
He didn’t like the interaction with Neville’s Remembrall and Draco. He hated the way Draco behaved in public but knew he had to endure it. He only wished his friends would know how nice Draco really was.
“I hope so, Marcus.” Draco took a bite of his lamb chop. “I’ve been practising all summer, and I’ll be in my best shape for Friday. Only time will tell I guess?” Marcus smiled at Draco in almost a brotherly fashion.
“Yes.” He looked from Crabbe to Goyle on either side of him and then back at Draco.
“Harry!” he had finally been cornered in the Gryffindor common room after all their classes for the day had been finished. He had paired up with Neville in almost every single one, dodging out of sight in the hallways whenever Ron or Hermione called for him. Harry sighed and turned to face his two best friends.
“Five minutes, Mr. Malfoy.” He snuck in, thankful almost all of the beds were entirely empty. Harry was awake, staring up at the ceiling as he walked in.
“Are you sure she’ll notice me now, Tom?” She asked her best friend with a smile.
“I’m glad you are Harry’s mate.” Draco looked away from his essay at the bushy-haired witch. “And I feel like the four of us are a great group. I’m glad you’re our friend, Draco.” Draco felt himself go very red, but Hermione went on. “You complete us in a way we didn’t know we needed.”
“You know what it means!” Pansy grinned. “Scum like her don’t deserve to be here.” Draco stepped away from her, frowning.
Harry,” Draco explained, looking frustrated. “But you hurt me a lot, not just yesterday but all of last year. I just need, a break of sorts.” Harry could feel the tears falling more freely down his cheeks. “I can’t jump right back into spending all my time with you.” Before Harry could say anything more, Draco hurried away, taking the stairs two at a time as if he couldn’t wait to get away.
“Mr. Borgin.” Draco panted while he held his father up, “how much to use your floo?”
“Oh, you definitely are Harry’s soulmate there, hating on Lockhart,” Hermione grumbled as she folded up Draco’s letter.
Finally, Potter grabs Draco's wrist and guides it between his legs.
Potter snorts in disbelief. "More interesting than you? For years, ever since we were eleven, you've held my attention, you prat. We're twenty-eight, and you still intrigue me like no other. You are a challenge that I’ll never get tired of, don't you get it?" He kisses the top of Draco’s head. "It's scary sometimes, being with someone who means so much. Giving him your heart and your faith, and then letting go and falling."
Instead of a witty comeback, there’s only silence. Harry opens his eyes, only to see the other man staring at him, his lips parted and a faint blush on his cheeks, as if he can’t believe his eyes.
"Potter, what the hell-"
"Draco, look at who I found waiting outside our portrait hole like an overexcited Crup?" she announces and moves away with a dramatic flourish.
They painstakingly stumble to Charlie’s cabin. Draco tucks him into bed, with Charlie choking out a surprisingly sober
Potter gathers some water in his cupped palms and splashes his face, smoothing his hair back. He leans back on the tub. “I left the Academy very soon after you. I was bumming around for a bit, before Oliver — Oliver Wood, he went to school with us, I don’t know if you remember — told me the Magpies was holding out try-outs for Seeker. I met him again at Seamus and Dean’s sports complex, and we ended up going out for a while—“
The curtain of pleasure parts when a shirt is tossed unceremoniously at his chest. Harry's eyelids flutter open to see his shirt in a heap in front of him. He picks it up groggily and gives Draco's thighs and his own cock a quick clean before crumpling face-down in the bed beside Draco.
“Er…” Harry casts his mind back to his trip so far. “The art museums, mostly — MoMA, Guggenheim, the Met, and the New York museum, which I really liked,” he says, counting them off his fingers. “Central Park too, plus a cruise around the island, and I saw the Statue of Liberty.”
"C'mon, c’mon..." Potter mutters, shifting closer to Draco. Draco's breathing hitches when Potter's thigh touches his; the heat of Potter's body radiating through his clothes. He doesn't know whether Potter's doing it on purpose, but he's definitely not complaining, as he basks in the warmth of this connection.
…except for a lone, pale and
After a bout of thrusting, Draco pulls out and smacks his cock lightly on Harry's balls and is rewarded with a loud cry. Grinning wickedly, Draco begins to thrust between Harry's thighs, rubbing his entire length along his balls and perineum.
"Goodbye, Potter." He wanted to say more, but how could he put into words the emotions thundering through him?
Harry grabs his left arm and spins him around to face him.
This very moment, crackling with pent-up sexual anticipation and energy, stretched as taut as a rope, lingers between them, as they simply stare at each other.
Draco wakes up to an empty bed.
With a determined flick of his wand, he flips the
"Doing what exactly? I mean, now that we all know it’s mutual, it's just a matter of us telling them that and then they can sort it out for themselves, can't they?" Ron points out, frowning.
He's told himself this countless times in the hopes of wiping out his inconvenient feelings for Malfoy. Merlin knows they've fought over this so many times, but he can't stop what his heart wants.
He's surrounded by a suffocating sadness that wraps around him like a kidnapper's cloak, pressing him from all sides.
His gaze flickers to Harry’s crotch, triggering a rush of arousal.
Love, as sweet as frosted sugar, tingles on Harry's skin when Draco reaches over to hold his hand.
Malfoy pulls the bag towards him, raising his eyebrows at its contents. “Quidditch tickets from Weasley, and chocolates from you? If the both of you are trying to court me, I should alert Granger, shouldn’t I?”
right?
"Sorry about just now. I'll buy you a pint one of these nights, yeah?" Ron says in an apologetic tone to Draco, who nods and moves back to stand beside Harry.
not ready for it," Harry trails off, his eyes frantic and searching Draco's face for any clues hinting to his emotions.
They lay wrapped up in each other until Draco pipes up.
He still doesn't know if Potter testified for him during the trials, ultimately sparing him from Azkaban. A part of him knows that now is not the right time to ask.
Who knew that the Golden Boy swears like a jarvey during sex?
"Yes, I am well aware," Draco replies, heaving a sigh identical to Harry's. "There's just so many of them," he says. "And the history between our families…"
This calls for a moment of privacy. "I'll get you some tea," Draco says, patting Potter on the knee and retreating. He brews a mug of Earl Grey, with two sugars and a splash of milk; that’s how Potter likes it. The domesticity of the scene strikes Draco — him puttering about Potter's cosy kitchen on a Friday afternoon, the warmth of the house and the soft pitter-patter of rain on the windows. As the tea steeps, Potter wipes his eyes and blows his nose as he looks through his keepsakes.
"Enough about me," Potter says after he hangs up. "What about you? You've always been really neat, so I'm not surprised at your choice of career."
Scene 5 "Osaka, December": Lee So Ra & SUGA - Song Request
Instead of returning to the studio, Harry goes to the living room and settles down on the sofa. Draco approaches him a while later, his face washed and looking rather sheepish. “C’mere,” Harry says, sitting up, stretching an arm out on the top of the sofa and accepting Draco into his arms. Draco rests his head on Harry’s chest, and Harry curls an arm protectively around him.
"No, I really gotta-" Harry's pushing away from the counter, the stool scraping against the floor. He stands, and he's not exactly sure why he's feeling faint; is it because he drank on a half-empty stomach, or is it because in less than four days, he's supposed to go up on
Draco’s brain barely has time to process the last few words before Potter lowers his jeans and his pants, reaching inside to ease his cock out—
Draco jolts himself out of his recollections and sips his mulled wine. He has been considering further studies in France, but Hermione still needs help with Rose. Perhaps in a year's time...
"Yes, I want that, s'all I've ever thought of. Fuck me, Malfoy, fuck me,
, the pressure in his pants is driving him wild because he's imagining his own tongue tracing Malfoy's body just like the snake; Harry desperately wants to know how Malfoy sounds like when he's touching himself-
"Don't look so bloody pleased with yourself!" Draco snapped and bounced the plushie off Harry's head again for good measure. "Yes, for some absurd reason I took a liking to it when it went on sale after your one-year-old defeat of Voldemort. Father hadn't been best pleased about that, but Mother got it for me in the end. According to Mother, I carried it everywhere when I was a child. When I got older, I had other things instead, such as books, but I've always... I..." He plopped down on the couch and twirled a finger around the plushie's small scarf.
But who's there for Malfoy when he needs someone?
"We suspect Serpentes is under investigation," the man continues.
With that, a grinning Draco licks a long, slow stripe up his cock, from root to tip.
Potter withdraws at once, the speed of the movement telling Draco that he was expecting the command.
Draco wishes at once that he could take it back. His arms feel empty without Potter, and panic seizes him when Potter storms to the teachers' table where their clothes are. "No, Harry, wait!" Draco hurries after him, ignoring the soreness in his arse.
After a quick rest and a shower, Harry makes himself comfortable on his balcony, and places his Geminio-proof canvas on his easel. He scrolls through his photos, noting the earthy colours of gold, brown and deep red. He spends some time working out a rough composition of his painting. Finally, he picks up a pencil.
, Albus.”
A heady cocktail of tension, wariness and arousal buzzes in Draco's blood as they size each other up. The last time they had met was at the Trials two years ago when Potter testified for Draco and his mother, releasing them from their one-month stay in Azkaban. Draco had no chance to say anything to Potter after the Trials since Draco had been herded away by Ministry officials.
"Of course. I wasn't implying otherwise," Draco soothes at once, activating his interpersonal skills that he'd picked up in his job. When he was starting out, he was surprised at how defensive and stubborn people can get when they're justifying their tidying decisions.
"I guess you'll know sooner or later. There's a...
There's a clattering sound from another part of the house, and Harry sits up, the duvet falling to his hips. He sniffs, catching a mouth-watering whiff of bacon and tilts his head towards the kitchen at the sound of eggs sizzling on a hot pan. His stomach growls. Malfoy gave him the best sex of his life, and he's even cooking him breakfast?
"Hey, hey," Harry cuts him off; he knows how hard it is to stop Malfoy when he's in full ranting mode. "She might be an Ashwinder, but she can't lay any more eggs. Plus, McGonagall says it's okay." A hot spike of irritation surges in him, and he treads alongside Malfoy when Malfoy resumes walking. "Give me some damn credit. You wouldn't really think I'd bring a dangerous creature to school without thinking it through."
“You always have to be the hero, don’t you, Potter?” Draco breaks the silence and looks up at Potter, who stops rubbing his head. Draco frowns, places Potter’s hand back on his head and only continues speaking when Potter resumes his stroking. “I heard what happened in the lake. You got to me first, but you had to make sure all the hostages were free before you came up with me.”
Without waiting for Potter’s response, Draco rockets off towards the other side of the pitch where he last saw a flicker of gold. Satisfied when he hears Potter’s snarl, he smirks and edges forward on his broom.
Malfoy bumps his shoulder against Harry, and he bumps back.
Malfoy slaps the salmon skin-up on the board in front of him, grabs a knife and rests the blade on the fish. He bends down, and with deft and steady cuts, he begins to score the skin of the salmon, his lips pursed in concentration.
It’s as if Draco is with him, playing his guitar and writing his songs.
“Sorry. We went to school together, and it’s been years since we saw each other.”
Sighing, Harry hums “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You”, and turns out the lights. He punches his pillow into shape, and lies down, staring up at the ceiling. It was just a summer fling; something that burnt as bright and beautiful, yet as temporary, as a shooting star.
Potter flounders and mumbles something that Draco can't catch. He recovers. "I still don't know why you're here!"
Malfoy looks pleased. "Dance with me then, won't you, Dan?" Malfoy purrs, a note of longing tugging on Dan's name. Hearing Malfoy use his fake name makes Harry even bolder.
“So close, Harry, oh…” Malfoy gasps. He pulls off, heaves his upper body up and plants his palms on the grass. He arches his back, shifting his knees to thrust into Harry’s mouth. He’s crying out Harry’s name, his body shuddering, and Harry quickly gulps his saliva before grabbing Malfoy’s arse, driving his pulsing cock down his throat. Spunk fills Harry’s mouth, and he swallows it, licking Malfoy clean afterwards. Malfoy’s prick slips out of his mouth; Harry’s jaw clicks when he closes it, and he rubs the back of his neck.
The last time Draco was here a month ago, he’d been safe in the knowledge that Harry was still alive.
And then he presses down on Harry's hips and swallows him to the root.
“Oh, I’m feeling much better now,” Potter says impishly. Draco slips a hand between Potter’s legs, flush with excitement at the thought of finally touching him there—
"What?" Potter says, recoiling as if he'd been slapped.
And that's how she got her name — her other sources of food might be live animals, but for some reason, she really, really likes pork chops, raw or cooked.
"Er... Malfoy?" he says, waving a hand in front of his face.
It's times like these — when he's alone and hurt — when he misses Draco the most.
With his identity as Malfoy revealed, the previous comings and goings of his neighbour took on a new importance. Malfoy’s nightly performances explained the odd hours of his return. Ever since Harry moved in, he didn’t hear anyone visiting Malfoy, and that day, there was no singing; in fact, his flat seemed unnaturally silent — Malfoy must still be maintaining his Silencing charm.
Humphrey looks at Harry and lets out a hoot of reproach.
"It's fun!" Harry declares, slowing down. He laughs, a light-hearted, bubbly laugh that reminds Draco of summer and sunshine. He turns around to face Draco and jogs backwards. "Welcome to Paris!" he calls, splaying his arms out.
He could Apparate to Portkey Central, but instead, he chooses to walk the few blocks there, soaking in the atmosphere of New York for one last time.
They fought too, terrible fights where they traded words as sharp as daggers and glares gleaming green, but at the end of the day, Harry knows they would never be apart because they love each other too much.
Even though Draco isn’t here anymore, he’s still in every painting.
"If I were to ring this number..." Harry starts slowly, meeting Malfoy's gaze. "How can I know that there'll be someone helpful on the line?"
Harry licks his lips and pours an excess amount of lube on his fingers. He remembers how turned on Malfoy was when he watched him lube up, and Harry is eager to put on a good show this time, too. He tosses the tube away and rests his heavy cock on his left palm, while he strokes himself with the coated fingers of his right hand. He tilts his body, giving Malfoy his side view as he lubes up.
Judging by the warmth, they've just emerged fresh from Potter's oven.
“Not bad, Potter,” Draco drawls in encouragement. The frown of concentration on Potter’s face is wiped off to be replaced with a rather shy smile. Bashful green eyes peer out beneath a mop of black hair that’s sticking up in all directions because Potter’s run his hands through his hair so much in frustration.
"Don't get too
"Let me take you out to the best restaurants and bars. Let’s go to the vibrant cities, to sleepy villages and pristine beaches. Anything you want, really," he says, bringing Potter's hand to his lips and kissing every fingertip. He smiles when Potter’s grin widens with every word. "We'll rent a villa on the beach, and the night before your birthday, I'll lay you out on the beach and we'll kiss and touch under the stars. How does that sound to you?"
"Piss off, Malfoy!"
Harry shrugs. "Yeah, I woke up earlier and I figured I better do that. Last night ended up pretty... messy," he trails off and rubs the back of his neck, his cheeks growing pink.
"Why do you have need of my services?" Draco asks.
And then Potter wipes his palms on his jeans, and Salazar, he's moving into Draco's personal space, head tilted towards him, his lips hovering just inches away from Draco's, but not pushing it any further—
With heavy limbs, he stands up slowly, his clothes sticking to him like a second skin. The downpour has washed away any stray hope he still harbours. Misery surrounds him like a kidnapper’s cloak. A part of him isn't surprised, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.
"Is he trying to scare me away? Is your pet
"Why are you having a meltdown with a plate of chips outside my room?" Potter asks. He’s a muddy, shivering mess — still in his Quidditch leathers, tracking wet footprints behind him. His hair is windswept with one leaf nestled within, and Merlin, he looks knackered, grass stains on his cheeks, dull eyes and lips not curved in their usual grin.
Now, at the sight of the Mark, he won't recall that scene in the Manor anymore. Instead, he'll think of tonight; of Potter's touch, crooked smile and his enduring artwork on his skin. He’ll remember Potter wiping away excess ink and rolling backwards on his chair to study the tattoo from another angle, before hunching over Draco’s arm again.
"I'll have you know that I make the best chocolate around here!" Potter hollers from his side of the road.
They kiss slowly and sensually in the snow and moonlight, their heads tilted, eyes closed and hands smoothing up and down waists and shoulders. Draco eagerly wriggles a hand under Harry’s layers of clothing to settle on the small of his back. In return, Harry cups a hand on the nape of Draco’s head — Draco loves it whenever he does that — to deepen the kiss.
“That’s twelve.” He grinned at Blaise, who was still on his third but was clearly struggling with it as he picked up another.
“It’ll be a problem when it becomes a problem. For now, we need to protect Harry from you-know-who.” Sirius muttered. “Mooney, maybe we could have another butterbeer before we go.” He stared at his soulmate with big, innocent eyes, who sighed in response.
“You alright, mate?”
“You’d have to have tons of money for that!” Harry interjected as Ron made another move that resulted in nothing happening to either of their pieces.
“Harry’s soulmate?” asked Harry, the usual grin on his face gone.
“I’m sorry about what I said on the train earlier.” Harry glared at the boy, trying to find some dishonestly on his face. “We can’t be friends in public.” Draco explained quietly, focusing on anywhere but Harry’s face. Harry heard the words, but they didn't quite register in his brain. He thought feverently of how he had never been this close to anyone ever before, not even a girl. Draco semlled like applie pie and strawberries, and Harry remembered watching him wolf down exactly those things at the feast earlier.
“-Packed with muggles, of course-“ Harry swung around and found the speaker to be a plump woman speaking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. He realized they were also pushing trolleys and one of the older boys had an owl as well.
were. He figured, for as long as he didn't have to explain it to them, he wouldn't worry about it. He wanted to ask Hagrid if it was normal to have a boy's name on you if you were already a boy, but he figured he wouldn't test Hagrifd's limits today.
“Neville, did you know why Draco was in the infirmary?” Neville raised his eyebrows at Harry and began copying down what Snape was writing away on the blackboard.
“I have a new job for you, Dobby.” She brushed baby Draco’s hair gently and picked him up before bringing him to the rocking chair in the corner. Dobby followed, surprised to hear the plea in his mistress’s voice. “You are removed from all your duties in the kitchens. Your sole purpose is to protect my son.”
“You seem like a good kid, Draco. Good luck.”
“I’d think you would at least remember the potion, Mr Potter, considering the fact that you drank it just last year to reach a
“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” drawled Draco. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books. Harry stared down at Ginny, who had been shy around him the entire summer, and wondered if Ginny really did have a crush on him.
“It’s not here.” But where could his father have sold or lost the diary? The same diary he obsessively wrote on and spent all his time mumbling to?
curse with her aunt Walburga, and she had simply turned the other way, knowing that the system was designed such that f she intervened, she would end up not dissimilar to Andromeda. There was nobody she could turn to, and nobody who would listen and understand. They were all trapped in a prison of their own making.
“James,” Lily warned, but it was difficult not to smile at the pair. Besides, she barely even thought about Severus anymore, he was but a memory of who used to be her best friend, even though he was providing the order with insider information.
“Okay, Draco.” Harry smiled up at his soulmate sleepily before slipping out of bed.
“Okay, then,” Harry muttered back, not entirely convinced. Draco nodded tersely before leaving him there, following a group of Slytherin students away from Harry.
“We don’t,” Sirius responded from the floor, looking at the insane pair that was Harry and James. He wished he was with them, but he wanted to talk to Lily. Preferably without Remus' presence, so he had been hovering around, hoping for a moment alone.
“Professor, I-“ Snape shook his head as to silence Draco and waved his wand. Draco was half expecting a hex or a curse but was surprised by the plate of sandwiches that appeared on his lap.
Draco shrugged nonchalantly. “Yeah, why wouldn’t I be.”
“Did you reference all of the books you used for this essay?” Draco asked Hermione before dipping his quill in the inkpot that was placed between them.
” Harry’s eyes widened and he could only look sheepish as Professor Snape went back to writing on the blackboard. He never could have a good day, could he?
“Have you decided on a name?” Her sister asked, sunken eyes sparkling. Narcissa looked back down at the baby boy and smiled.
Narcissa Malfoy had an easy birth, surrounded by all the people she loved and several of the best healers Britain had to offer, should something have gone wrong. Her husband held her hand as a healer cut the umbilical cord of the squirming baby that came out of her and assessed the health of the baby. She smiled up at Lucius, his name on her wrist was blooming beautiful pink roses around it, the letters glowing emerald. The baby's eyes weren't open yet when the healer wrapped the baby up in a velvet deep green blanket and handed him over to Narcissa. He stopped crying almost immediately now that he was closer to his mother and made grabby hands at her chest.
“Harry, what’re we —”
“I bet she got nervous. Are soulmates supposed to spend all their time together?” Ron looked thoughtful at the question and shook his head slowly.
“My love, listen to me. Harry has been hurt; this is why you are sick.” He sensed a tone of urgency in her voice and looked up at her worried voice. “Harry’s location is unknowable to us because of a spell Dumbledore employs, so there is no way to visit him unless we find his address.” Draco’s eyes widened as he listened to his mother.
“You know why, Dobby.”
“A dark wizard doesn’t always mean a ‘bad wizard’, Harry. The dark arts themselves aren’t inherently bad, or prejudiced. Many wizards who were Slytherin joined the dark lord, yes, but does that mean all Slytherins should be blamed? If the dark lord had been sorted into Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, would you say all the people in those houses are bad?”
“That’s you done, my dear.” She told Harry. So, he hopped off the footstool and turned towards the boy. His silver eyes looked almost muddy grey.
Draco and Blaise were deep into their game of who could eat the most pumpkin tarts when Pansy slid next to the two of them, looking Haughty as usual. Draco had ignored her, as had most of Slytherin house for the better part of the previous month. He paid her no attention now as he wolfed down another tart.
“Fix me some brandy, would you?” She hurried to his side, already smelling the alcohol on him. She worked quickly in opening a new bottle of mead and pouring him a glass full. She eyed the open pages of the leather-bound diary with dislike but knew there was nothing she could do against it.
One thing was for sure, first year was terrible. Draco glared at the back of Harry Potter’s head as the whole school clapped for him and his friends. The ensue of events ever since that one quidditch match had felt like a daydream for Draco. Once he stopped talking to Harry after demanding an apology, Harry never seemed to want to apologize. Or talk. Or even pretend as if that afternoon had never happened.
Irma, however, had a reputation to uphold. She knew that students regarded her to be ridiculously strict about her library rules, and she did not want to be seen as being
“We should have won.” Blaise Zabbini groaned from next to Draco and Draco could only shrug in response.
Hello! If anyone is getting kind of tired of the library scenes, please let me know. I personally adore libraries and books and I love writing about nerdy characters (which is why everyone’s at the library lately).
Narcissa Malfoy looked into the eyes of the house-elf and for a moment wished she had treated it better in the past. She had never been abusive or unkind, but she knew that house-elves lead a life that didn't span beyond working for whatever family they were born into. She vowed to herself that someday, she would free Dobby, or give him the choice to freedom if Draco survived this ordeal.
I hope you enjoyed reading this!xx
“Five points from Gryffindor, each.” Snape snarled at the trio, eyes darting from one to another. “Dumbledore may believe you to be innocent, but I don’t believe you, Potter. To your dorms, now.” Harry was hurrying away, invisibility coat in hand when he heard Snape deduct five points from Slytherin as well before dragging Draco away.
“Because you all but said all Slytherins are bad and didn’t apologize.” Draco whisper-yelled back.
Ron sighed, looking peeved. “Let’s just go back.”
“Yeah, I can see which families are better for myself, thanks.” Harry sniped back, and Draco momentarily felt an ache in his stomach.
“Draco.” She stood up and got into bed with him, and he cringed at how the movement hurt his ribs.
He absolutely loved listening to her talk about things, she got this excited faraway look in her eyes as if she wasn’t even really there, and her voice was soothing, it made him feel like he was at home on Christmas eve with a hot cocoa by the fireplace.
“How?”
“So what?” An icy voice called from the doorway. They broke apart, and Narcissa immediately stood in front of Draco protectively. Lucius Malfoy stood at the entrance with Dobby held by the ear. Draco felt fear rush through him.
Draco hadn’t realized how easily Harry gravitated towards him whenever they were alone, but now he noticed how his soulmate cuddled up next to him on their couch the moment his friends left.
Ron tackles him to the ground, his hands gripping hard on Harry’s wrists. His nails dig into Harry's flesh, leaving crescent-shaped indents.
Draco moaned.
Even in the skies, he can’t escape Potter.
. Once again, Harry detects that whiff of cherries and vanilla that remind him of designer lips and breathless kisses. Upon seeing Harry, Malfoy blinks in mild surprise.
“Oh, Charlie. I’m so sorry,” Draco whispered, and promptly gave him his usual dragon biscuits, hoping to cheer him up, but only received a small, teary smile. Draco brewed him a strong cup of his favourite tea. There’s another new shiny burn on his left forearm, which piqued Draco’s curiosity.
In answer, Draco wound his hands into Harry's hair, guiding his head so that they could continue kissing, even while walking. They managed two steps, before Draco tripped and nearly fell, catching himself on the door frame just in time. Harry, able to brace himself against Draco, remained upright and laughing. Draco scowled and snaked a hand between them and giving him a few hard pumps that effectively knocked all traces of amusement off Harry's face and made his final chuckle turn into a yelp.
lived in our house for months? Or after, when my father convinced me to go with him and my mother because he’s too much of a coward to face the awaiting trials?"
"What was the condition?” he asked. Pansy frowned, pursing her lips. “Pansy, tell me.”
“Draco, I’ll make it up to you, I swear. It’s just tonight, we’ll be at Manchester, something’s come up, we’ve got to go there now. We’ll go out tomorrow, anywhere you want, I’m sorry, so sorry, Draco!” Sparks sizzle from Harry’s mouth as he speaks.
"Go ahead, Malfoy, accept! I'll take Saturday instead, and you can do Sunday. Wouldn't want to stand in the way of true love and all that!" he yells from his corner as he quickly withdraws the Ears.
The Ministry had formally invited Draco, Hermione and the Weasleys to give speeches, but all of them had declined.
“I’ve been thinking about that too.” Potter shifts his chair forward and rests his elbows on the edge of Draco’s bed. “Just think, Malfoy. If you suddenly vanished from my life, wouldn’t I… miss you?” His face goes pink. “You were the first person of my age that I spoke to when I first entered the wizarding world. You were my first enemy. You fight me, annoy me, challenge me every day, and now, you’re my… er…” He makes a vague gesture between them.
“First, I'd like the bloke that I'm going out with to call me by my first name. Merlin knows you've moaned it enough during sex."
No, he will never hurt Potter again.
"Really?" Harry sits up straight, scattering the crumbs from his jumper onto the floor. "That's surprising. Paris is pretty near. I thought you would've been there before."
"Happy Christmas," he says.
,” Potter sighs, cupping the back of Draco’s head and urging him on when Draco takes it into his mouth, sucking and licking. When Potter guides him to the other, he follows, dividing his attention between laving both nipples. He slicks Potter’s length with pre-come, popping his fingers briefly into his mouth and sucking on them, making sure to hollow his cheeks. He returns to wanking Potter and teasing his nipples. He kisses his way up Potter’s neck, whispering every explicit thought in his mind — Potter loves his dirty talk.
His grip tightening on Draco's palm, he pulls out, and with two quick strokes and his abdominal muscles clenching hard, he comes on the back of Draco's thighs, accompanied by a loud groan of Draco's name.
Harry ducks his head in embarrassment — he doesn’t fancy using his name for anything, not even for art school or his exhibitions, but he’s willing to make an exception for this.
The bartender taps Malfoy on the shoulder, proffering a glass of wine. Even though Malfoy tilts his face towards him, his gaze is still fastened on Harry. A man walks past between them, interrupting Harry’s line of sight.
Draco smiles, his chest swelling with pride at the thought of Rose, already ten months old. He loves her chubby fingers and ruddy cheeks, her tufts of red hair and bright blue eyes framed with thick lashes. She's already starting to learn how to stand, much to Draco and Hermione's delight. He had never thought he was the paternal sort, but he's fallen in love with her bubbly laughter, her shy smile and her tendency to hide her face and look towards Draco and Hermione for help when someone that wasn’t family approached her.
Harry sighs. It's so tempting to simply laze on the grass, letting the sights and sounds of the park lull him into a soporific stupor, but he definitely doesn’t want to return to London empty-handed. Nevertheless, Harry's motions are sluggish as he sets up his equipment. He dips his brush in oil, dabs it on the cloth and brings it to his loaded palette. He hesitates.
He's never heard Malfoy say
"You know how hot this gets me," Harry growls, sliding his hands into the back pockets of Malfoy’s jeans, giving his arse a hard squeeze.
"Humphrey!"
“I’m gonna call him Humps!”
Draco pulls the bowl of chocolate towards him and sighs in dismay at the thin, solidified layer on top.
"How may I help?" Draco asks, rolling his sleeves up to his elbows and flexing his fingers.
Potter's close; Draco knows by the clenching of his arse and shuddering of his body. Draco nibbles on Potter's earlobe and pounds into him even deeper—
Draco looks at his exposed erection and his legs, wrapped around the other man's hips. It feels so damn good sitting in Harry's lap, and he's so rock-hard and hungry for him.
When Malfoy first started at the shop, it was clear that he was putting a lot of effort into his designs, but the problem with them was that they were too safe and comfortable.
"Well, that was fun," he remarks. He wanders towards Draco's bench, and before Draco can react, he pops an unwrapped Canary Cream into his mouth.
“Do you still think about that night at the pub?” Malfoy mutters, throwing his head back to grant Harry access, his words dissolving into a moan of encouragement when Harry sucks hard at his skin, that familiar lemon scent transporting Harry to that day in the prefects’ bathroom, sharing a bath with a naked Malfoy—
"Well, if this is what you want..." Hermione says, looking concerned.
"You talk as if we're done for the night," Potter says, pulling Draco closer and pressing his hand on his erection.
His father is practically the Dark Lord’s right-hand man. Would he be expected to follow in his father’s footsteps one day to serve the Dark Lord? When will he have to make his choice?
And then he returned to his chambers and promptly drowned himself in copious amounts of tea.
Draco takes a deep, steadying breath.
"I've got dinner with Ron and Hermione tonight and I reckon I'll be working late tomorrow. See you on Saturday?" Potter asks, nipping Draco's neck. "You know what they say, absence makes the heart fonder-"
"We thought Charlie would win, since he's the closest to you two," Filius says, shaking his head in visible sorrow as he reaches over and drops a sizeable amount of coins on the middle of the table.
A strange homesickness thrums inside Draco, tearing apart within him like a new emotion.
"Potter, you absolute
He freezes in mid-stride. Potter's still yelling, sweet Merlin—
"No, that's not—"
They walk out of Portkey Central, with Draco sandwiched between Harry and Pansy. Harry playfully bumps his shoulder against Draco's. "Did any American blokes on motorbikes take you out for a ride?"
Draco lets out a giddy laugh that gets swallowed up by the wind whistling in his ears. He doesn’t know where the Snitch has flown to, and truth be told, he doesn’t really care. As long as he’s together with Potter, challenging him and fighting him and touching him and kissing him, he doesn’t really care much about anything else.
If life is like a Hollywood movie or some sort of fairy tale, Draco would come charging in with grand gestures and touching words, bags and guitar in hand, ready to go home with him.
pet snake?"
Hermione's smile fades, and Ron frowns. "She said hello," he points out, an edge to his voice.
If these two hopeless blokes won’t do anything about it, then he will, bloody hell!
"It's called an umbrella, Potter. People use it when it's raining."
Malfoy stops beside a pair. He exchanges words with them, accompanied by sketching wand movements in the air with his hands. He takes the place of one student, engaging the Hufflepuff in combat while her partner watches. Intrigued, Harry sits on a bench, staying in the shadows as he rakes Malfoy's form with an admiring gaze. Compared to Auror training, Malfoy's movements are more fluid and precise as he trades a flurry of spells with the student. His concentration is tight and intense as he picks apart the cracks in his opponent's advanced shield charm and follows up with an
As far as Draco knows, the box in Sirius Black's cupboard still remains sealed in the dark.
“It’s his birthday, Harry, and you can’t even spare two hours for him? We haven’t seen you and Ron in ages—“ Hermione stops when Draco appears, stony-faced. “He’s here, and he looks like he knows. Tell him yourself.” She moves away, giving Draco ample space to confront Harry.
