“Pans.”
Life has stupid things, like tea time with Snape. Apologizes to Dumbledore. Even more spectacular things like cosying up with his friends, and the promise of seeing his mother.
After not receiving a letter from his father for nearly a year, he had gotten one mere note demanding he come home for the holidays. Needless to say he didn’t trust it.
Theo’s with him, Theo would never allow anything to happen to him, Theo will
“How did father allow this?” He asks before he can stop himself. Narcissa’s eyes narrow, he quickly makes amends. “I mean, doesn’t he hate animals? He barely let me keep Poly, not to mention how he keeps the owls locked up if they aren’t in use.”
“Have you not been going all out with me?!”
“It’s true, you’re very good at getting things done.”
Christmas is the biggest it’s ever been.
different shape. Black cloak melts to the floor, hood turning into locks of black hair that still as the three of them watch a Dementor morph into Harry, neck snapped, bloodied and very clearly dead.
“No,” he admits, “I can’t find the right way to tell them about Harry, I’ve gotten so good at changing the truth that I don’t think I can ever tell the full truth again.”
“Alright, kiddo,” Remus pats Sirius’s back as he talks, “Today is the crappy paperwork day. We have an agenda of sorts, but we’re going to have to have a few talks first.”
“I dare you to. That would serve him right for acting like such a dick.”
To say he’s at his wits end is the nicest way he could possibly put it.
“But...why?”
“We’ve gotta get out of here!” He screams, right before a look of fear comes over his friend’s face and he hears his father yelling his name.
Never in his life had he made his mother angry. Annoyed? Of course. Frustrated? That’s a given. Sad? Due to recent events, likely. But never in his whole life has he seen the dark look that crosses her face directed at him.
makes Draco snap his head up. “You’re business is the liquor store? The one with the guy who doesn’t like me?”
June shrugs. “She was focused on her Mastery. And mum and dad certainly didn’t know!”
food is more than enough to please his favorite pain in the ass, but Misty insists, so Draco spends the afternoon spelling away dust, getting used to his new wand while she tinkers with the power box.
Draco has no damned clue why she’s on his father’s side. He knows all four of them, himself included, would be perfectly fine with his father going to jail...except he fucking isn’t. Not for this. Not for something he didn’t do while he was trying to help. And why was he trying to help? What was there for him to gain by helping Draco rescue the Boy Who Lived? What was there-
“We be forgetting the wards!”
Misty returns some time later with a broken cup filled with cold water.
Krum laughs at that, they end up bickering until Pomfrey comes into the room. Harry swears that if she wanted to she could kill them all, but she just heals their wounds and tells them to get some sleep. Harry she pulls aside to thoroughly inspect.
Harry has a little bit of a hard time getting off the hook. “I, um, read the message and thought that I should pass it along to you, professor. Hygiene is important.”

“A tale you
Draco peeks open one eye and is stunned to see that instead of the dark dungeon walls he’s grown so used to, light is streaming in. If he hasn’t gone crazy, there’s a bed beneath him and he’s
So yes, now there’s a fourth time.
“Mother doesn’t trust him to have it.” Draco whispers back right as some old man steps forward and Mr. Weasley tears into him. He suddenly has a whole new respect for the redhead clan.
Like at least all of London could fit into it, stands completely packed, cheering fans on either side, and he’s following an attractive man to their seats? This
“Oi! Malfoy! I didn’t know you had a cat!”
“Come on,” Draco whispers, “I think I managed to tire you out, and a bed is much more comfortable than the floor.”
“Are you calling me bitter, sir?” A smile lingers behind Dumbledore’s innocent eyes, so Draco pretends offense. “I’ll have you know I love lemons. The tarts here are my favorites.”
Draco wants to laugh but Hagrid is back and the face Potter makes is enough to get him back in good spirits until he sees what the giant brings with him.
“Harry James Potter.” Draco says, but his hair is dying down so whatever threat he intended to have is long gone.  “Honestly, I should put wards on you, shouldn’t I?” He mumbles a few spells and Harry’s face feels loads better. Draco kisses him on the cheek, then pulls back to glare at Sirius.
The following days Draco finds every excuse he can to get into Snape’s office, the two of them pouring over books, learning ways to defeat such beasts, learning the quickest way to heal, how to protect yourself from something you couldn’t look in the eye. He disappears so much it’s no surprise Blaise and Pansy corner him the second he starts towards the common room door.
McGonagall raises one eyebrow above her glasses so Draco puts on his best concerned face.
“Oh look at these new dragon boots!”
Since he’s here in the cheaper parts, Draco also resigns himself to going
“Don’t. You.
He’s replaying that scene in his mind over and over, just to make sure he didn’t send the letter, to make sure his isn’t the one Potter is actively avoiding in the middle of the hallway.
“Hey,” Draco shrugs, “It’s not being mauled by a werewolf in front of your deranged criminal cousin.”
For the world to just...stop being so quiet that it’s ringing in his ears.
Millie departs with them as she has to be home in time to bake with her grandmother, and since it’s still light out Draco decides to go for a swim.
big red flags, each with the same meaning and Draco can’t help but wonder where
As punishment for speaking against him in public, Lucius forces him towards the commotion of stupid, mush-for-brains Lockheart. Dazzling smile, charming to anyone who looks at him for too long, and probably the most annoying adult he’s ever had the displeasure of meeting. And because having to listen to the man drone on and on about how wonderful he is isn’t enough, Harry bloody Potter walks through the doors.
Sirius and Remus, obviously. They’d give up everything for him, and Harry wants their happiness so bad it hurts. He wants them to frolic in the sun, prank the way they used to, smile without a ghost behind it.
Draco snorts, but it’s fond. “My mother loves lavender.”
The quiet is back once he finishes, and something begins to make sense to Draco.
time as an eighteen year old. My girls and I had this ritual, you see. We’d get all dolled up, go out to the taverns, find some handsome young man, and then-”
At least Potter was probably safe in his muggle home somewhere else in London, hopefully not doing something stupid like leaving in the middle of the night and getting on the Night Bus, which everyone knew was extremely dangerous and only for desperate wizards.
“Harry and Ron just flew a car into the Whomping Willow!”
“I’m honored to frequent your thoughts, really, but isn’t it a bit early for this conversation?”
He’ll have to get an owl to do that, though. Unless he asks Kingsley to deliver his mail, but he’s trying to bully Kingsley into running for Minister at the moment, so maybe mail should be a second priority.
“As much as I’m enjoying the look on their faces, I think they’ll only be lost until we tell them, Narcissa.”
She’s definitely annoyed with him.
also harry, in the midst of not dealing with his trauma:
He rummaged around the cash register for a bit, pulling out a paper that Draco hastily looks over.
His first instinct was to rush towards Potter, but one look up and he freezes. Lucius was watching. He couldn’t run and pretend to be concerned about a classmate with him here, instead he sped off to Madam Hooch, “Potter broke his arm, one of the Bludgers kept coming after him, I don’t know why but I know it got him good.” is all he manages to rush out before zipping back to his team. They watch, completely confused as Lockheart marches over to Potter, even from where he stands Draco can hear his fallen nuisance moan ‘Oh, no, not you.’
They are doing this, then.
section of the spell because
“Have you not wreaked enough havoc?” Fleur asks. “I have no idea where you got my personal information, but I assure you, you will regret exposing it.”
The voice isn’t supposed to sound like that. Draco doesn’t like it when Harry sounds like him, he should never have that much darkness in him. Harry isn’t someone who could kill. Harry smiles when he eats chocolate frogs even though he’s awful at catching them. Harry likes sugar in his tea. Harry likes sleeping by fires and stealing people’s blankets during study sessions. Harry is the type of person to forgive and forgive until it bites him in the ass.
“Shut it! This is the best part!”
He knows he should probably tell him about Potter first, but the golden trunks being carried past him is a little, if not completely impossible, to ignore. And, if it's possible, more annoying.
of you! Mum! Pans! Blaise! Luna!
Their friends all coupling up:
Draco starts out the door, cat in arms, only to pause and recollect his books, meeting her eyes with a soft smile he rarely displayed these days, “Parvos Lumen Malfoy. Parvy for short, or perhaps Pretty as a nickname, maybe even just LuLu.”
The room hushes at his outburst. Dumbledore stills behind his desk, Potter freezes in his seat. Not even the fire moves until LuLu brushes against his leg, like she’s offering some weird support. Draco takes a deep breath, quickly coming to his senses. Before he can apologize, Dumbledore stands and slowly walks to the corner of the room, near the stupid Pensive.
Naturally, if his whole mission for the day is to make Misty happy
“Why?”
“That’s a lie. I know you took the key to your vaults when you left. I’ll have Gringotts transfer the money over to Obsidian, you know the Goblins don’t care about wizard crimes.”
LuLu, the little sadistic monster, spent the morning watching three Slytherins get their asses handed to them by equally sadistic parents, and then had the audacity to nap with Draco’s snake who
Draco nods, moving around to the snack cupboards while Lucius grabs some water.
A crack and the small creature is gone, leaving Hermione gaping and Harry still trying to open his eyes all the way. Before Granger can launch into whatever crazy tangent is brewing in that bushy hair of hers Dobby is back and placing three cups on their respective tables.
“He was an ass about it,” Ellios says fondly, “But he was kind for a Death Eater. He told me to leave him, that his death would be a good thing. One less person on their side….”
“Because I can talk to them! Geia said to mention her name and it should help, though I also have to do this weird bow thing to show respect, there’s a spell, don’t worry.”
hi! i ended on a bad note, i know, silly Harry. warning for next chapter, there's going to be a sex ed scene. i debated putting it in and in the end i liked it too much to pull it so please look forward to poppy casually making harry want to crawl in a hole and never come out.
Anyways,
Harry stands so he looks less suspicious. “No one.”
The Halloween fest lasts all day long for Slytherins, as they pick the day to be particularly cunning and dark. Everything from sneaking hexes into people’s food to scaring each other with silly tricks. In the morning he gets both Crabbe and Goyle with a few smoke bombs at the ends of their beds, they both pout the whole way to breakfast, but their reactions had been funny enough for Draco not to care. Flint almost gets him with a spell on his toast, no one would expect someone to like eating something sour, but this is Draco afterall. Pansy has the same idea as he does, both starling themselves before bursting into laughter at the cards nearly written word for word the same.
You saved Mr. Weasley, yes, but you can’t keep getting yourself in danger! You’re going to get killed!”
She hands it over and Draco takes a sip. The water hurts his throat, makes the lumps in it more obvious, it’s hard to swallow so Draco hands it back. The elf is skinnier than him anyways, and if he’s going to die, he’d rather her live as long as possible. He once read that water makes up seventy percent of human bodies, he wonders if it’s the same for elves.
Snape snaps his head up at that, “If you’re thinking that Harry Potter has the spine to-”
He’s begging for the boy to say no, but Potter is every bit a courageous idiot, replying with a simple, “Yeah, that’s right.”
They stand in a secluded walkway between the field and the school, deserted enough that no one will hear their conversation, or him if he screams.
“You mean to tell me you let a werewolf who’s in love with
The pants are
Malfoy looks off to the distance, which happens to mean him locking those soft grey eyes on Harry’s. For a moment it’s like everything falls away. He can see every emotion in those eyes looking at him, and then they fade away before Harry can identify them.
there’s no need to add a threat to the discussion.
Harry glares at Ginny, “No shit.”
“You could’ve just said you won’t take no for an answer.”
While she’s fidgeting and trying not to drop any blood, Draco counts down with his
Harry grins at them, “Well I’d call that a successful night, wouldn’t you?”
Draco whirls on the spot, wand raising, already stepping in front of his little elf friend, and finds...a blue form of a woman?
“Because I need you to take your father with you.”
Some of them even fell into very, very strange dreams.
He spots Krum as he’s heading to lunch, stopping mid-conversation about anti-fire charms to shout “Krum! Hey! Krum!”
“Because he believes Hagrid has opened the chambers...just like last time they are forcing the blame on an innocent soul.”
things he needs before the year began, which is how Draco finds himself entering some shop that holds all his father’s dirty little wishes. They can't bring anything home, not with the Ministry's inspections, but now that he thinks about it, that's probably the whole reason they're here. Too much darkness in one home or something like that.
“We’ll do both, of course!”
She jolts at his words, quickly leaning over and doing what she’s told.
Also Draco and Harry, standing in the middle of the hallway, holding hands, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes:
Apparently Harry felt just as strongly as he did about Lupin leaving. He gets it of course, no parent in their right mind would be okay with a werewolf teaching their children. But that didn’t stop him from feeling guilty when Lupin reminds Harry that he
They stand beside him, just far enough so they can make out the shapes down at Hagrid’s huts. Draco makes a mental note to spend more time with them, he’s sure it will fit into his schedule.
be throwing a tantrum if they don’t leave soon. What else is left?
“It’s about time, don’t you think?”
There’s no fucking way.
Draco can’t hide his gasp but Lucius doesn’t even notice him. “Mother! You-he-”
“Um, I’m kinda busy and I don’t know who you are so..“
“Alright, as you know Remus and I are very new to this, but we do have some ground rules. Follow me, kid.”
“You don’t say,” Blaise glares, “Still doesn’t answer any of our questions.”
At times it can be overwhelming, all those people all at once, all laughing and joking with him can make him feel too full. It gets painful sometimes, and the giant sleepover at Malfoy Manor where he saw all the people he cared about in one day….
Of course Harry Potter and his fellow Gryffindors would be here to ruin it all.
the one to help him smuggle people out of Hogwarts back in seventh year.
Narcissa places a hand on Sirius’s arm, “We have a family physician we can contact for you at the drop of a hat, we wouldn’t trust anyone else to take care of him, you,
Something about that seems fucked up, but a lot of his life is fucked up.
“Well,” Draco says, stirring the pot in more ways than one, “I’m Howie’s partner now, and that means I’m invested in the well being of his store.”
Turning before he can say something and make a complete disgrace of himself, Draco begins to leave, planning to go straight back to bed and not get out until Monday morning classes.
had to go through an interrogation with his friends, Draco gives his nastiest smirk. He’s opening up his mouth to retaliate when Potter beats him to it.
“Well, we’re already jumped up on candy,” Fred grins.
, as though his ancestors would be proud of his father’s willingness to act like a fangirl over something as stupid as an evil lizard-man.
“Dobby. Listen to me, these are orders. You are not to burn your hands, you are to redeem yourself and make sure Potter is safe. Do
Blaise glares at them, “I swear if I’m still-oh thank Merlin! I’m rubbish at Latin, I could barely understand what I was saying!”

And then the summer of seventh year happened and routine turned into habits he needed for survival. He spent
Oh fuck.
Draco looks up, smiling and shutting the book, “You’re never a bother.”
And then, before Potter can hold him back even longer, Draco matches out the door and straight down to his bed, where he ignores Blaise and Pansy and all his other friends so he can finally get some fucking sleep.
Dumbledore eases his way into the room, walking casually like he isn’t wearing the very face that got Draco to cave in and tell him everything last year. Knowing there’s no way he’ll win a battle of wills with Albus Dumbledore, Draco rises to a sitting position.
Draco rolls his eyes, but invites his friends to sit, not surprised in the least when Crabbe and Goyle tear into the snacks he brought. “It’s nothing really, father has just been training me is all. That mixed with the learning duties of the house and school work, I haven’t had much time. I really didn’t know you all had even sent me letters, I usually fall into bed and sleep right away each night, I haven’t been checking my desk for them.”

It’s a testament to how tired she is that she doesn’t bother arguing.
“Yep! He’s an ol’ friend of mine, said I might be seeing you around. You need help with anything?”
“And then the other Death Eaters  found me.” Ellios sighs. They take William’s hand, squeezing it as if apologizing.
Draco, who fought against liking Harry for three years and is now dating him: you think we have a choice?
“Yes, I wanted to use it for Order meetings. Narcissa and Lucius, I am well aware where your loyalties lie, and I should tell you that I plan on allowing Draco to join-”
Draco almost trips over nothing at Blaise’s question, but quickly catches himself. “No?”
Draco sighs. “It snapped.”
“It’s too dangerous! You’ll do something stupid-”
know the truth about Sirius’s innocence...can you really see him sitting by and letting his god-father go back to Azkaban? I’m personally not sure if Sirius will ever see those walls again….but if he is captured by a Dementor before he can- unfortunately- slip into safety...it would mean another life lost for Harry. He’s been through too much as it is, I daresay another loss so early in life would be the death of him, especially because Sirius and Mr. Potter were so close. Having spent many hours thinking over the situation, I assure you I have spent many sleepless nights on the topic, I decided that it would be safest for Harry not to know the truth until Sirius has fully achieved freedom, by trial or….other means.”
Fuck.
Like, uncomfortably warm.
Emilia said.
“I didn’t realize how much she was still looking out for me until our last year, when the war started getting worse. Lucius caught me sneaking into Myrtle's bathroom one night and she got in his way. Distracted him in the nastiest way possible, if you ask me, but sometimes snogging in the hallways is acceptable. I thought she didn’t care until that point and after that I started keeping up contact with her. Obviously Lucius was expected to join Voldemort, but Sissy told me neither one of them wanted to. She said it was either her life or his, and since he had more connections he was more valuable. Broke her heart for a while, especially because Bella had gone completely mad by then.”
They barely have time to share a look before Sisily is before them, bowing deeply but looking around as though she’d been through the shock of her life.
Draco knows it’s stupid, but he has a wand and his father doesn’t, so really, how stupid can it be? He looks around at the scared group of teenagers, and then at Potter who seems to be forming a plan. Draco locks eyes with his father.
“You too?” Harry asks, just because Ron trying to be serious is second only to Krum-Shark and this conversation is
“I’m not flaming right now, am I?”
“If we’re trading advice, watch out for that William kid.”
“I know sir, but Black can’t get in and-”
One plant quickly turns into several, and before Draco knows it, he’s leaving with three Monsteras, a few Pothos, some Snake Plants
“Nonsense,” Remus shakes his head, “All the teachers agree, and I doubt anyone in this room would say otherwise.”
The girls glare for a second more before Pansy huffs and Millie continues with a triumphant smile.
Draco lets the implications sink in, and then he feels a little more light headed than normal.
“Has he tried a Sleeping Draught?”
Draco turns to see Narcissa, leaning casually against the railing in what she calls ‘casual clothes’ that’s really her sparring uniform. “You’re here early, come grab breakfast before we start.”
and I-” Theo takes a big breath. “Pans has been going
“I’m not the one watching other people sleep,” Draco croaks out and Merlin, he knows it’s been awhile since he’s done anything but scream but there’s no reason for
His left eye pops open only because he hears LuLu huff and her body weight disappears from his side. Draco sits up with a yawn, dragging the white Kneazle back to his chest before addressing his loud little elf.
Pansy made it to Japan all those months ago.
He was definitely adding ‘Sirius Shocked Face’ to his list of favorite things.
He’d been so scared. So immovably terrified.
“See, the ‘s’ stands for no, the ‘e’ means no, and the ‘x’ means-”
He says again, and then tacks on
Pansy looks a little nervous, glancing between the two of them, but she seems to make up her mind, leaning closer as if there was someone around to hear them.
Before he can process what that means, Hermione gasps beside him and he turns in time to see them. Actually fucking
“Ah! Misty doesn’t know if wood will be being good for that room, Mister Draco.”
Harry reaches out to touch him, Draco moves away and the look Harry gives him makes something squeeze tight in his chest. The outstretched arm drops.
“Oh, son, all innocents die eventually.”
“You see,” Lupin continues before Hermione can go completely purple in the face, “I was completely convinced this man in front of you was a killer and betrayed our friends, until one night Dumbledore took me aside and told me that some truths are harder to find than others-”
Draco doesn’t know how to respond, so he splashes water at her. Pansy, of course, splashes them right back, which is how Theo and Blaise find them, in the middle of a war.
Somehow, given what they just went through together, Draco trusted that.
“Don’t make me hex you,” Draco sighs.
“He’s an old friend.”
“Morning, should I ask why she picked today of all days to pick on you before noon?”
They’d never seen McGonagall so pissed.
As much as he hates to admit it, the creature isn’t that bad. Crabbe and Goyle keep a good distance away, enough that he can speak freely.
how he expected to end his shopping trip.
do you think you’re doing here? Have you any self preservation?! And you-” he turns those fearful eyes on Lupin, “I’ve just made my peace with you and now you’re endangering
As soon as the timer in the air hits midnight, Draco feels the rush of the sea, the pull of the tide, like the ocean is filling him to the brim with all of her majesty.
“Well, I’m not sure what happened, but I believe we’ve just seen Fleur-”
Beside him, Potter relaxes every so slightly, but then the door is opening and Memory Draco is tossed inside. They hurry in, despite at least two of them wanting to run away. Lucius places his wand on the door window, just out of Memory Draco’s reach. For a moment he thinks Potter is going to vomit.
“It’s no fun when they’re willing” Draco pouts back.
Harry Potter,” he begins, making a conscious effort to keep his eyebrow from twitching. Thanks to the bloody Daily Prophet anyone and everyone who wanted to help with his father’s little scheme would have a clear target now. There’s no telling how much trouble Draco is in. “Can’t even go into a

Grated, that happiness only lasts until he sees how furious his godfather-in-law is.
“Don’t move, Potter.” Snape sighs, a lazy tone and even lazier movements. “I’ll get rid of it.”
Wait, what? Harry’s cheeks are slightly flushed, eyes wide behind his glasses, and the worst part is either the water collecting in those green orbs or the shaking of his hands as he explains.
now. And isn’t his father going to end up killing one day anyways? He hides things from everyone, even Pansy and Blaise and he’s planning on signing his blood so he can’t do that anymore. Should he turn a new leaf completely? Stop hiding things from people he knows are good, lean on them, let them support him?
“Draco?” Pansy leans on him, in turn he leans on Blaise, who supports them both.
“I can’t be there, unfortunately, too many bad memories, which I’m sure is the reason for our meeting. Finally got out of that ol’ Manor, huh?”
Pansy and Blaise look towards him and match his smile.
“A journal?”
Draco is going to go bald from stress. There’s no other future for him with watching over the idiot who’s
“Draco, darling.” Narcissa turns to her son, Draco gives her a look so full of suspicion he almost burst into laughter. But then Narcissa continues, “You know the Quidditch World Cup?”
Confusion at first, then understanding when his eyes land on the tea. Panic follows those two before fear takes over.

Beside him, Draco’s dead asleep, curled up on his side. His hair fans out in the most beautiful way, his head is practically on Harry’s arm, and since Draco’s probably not waking up any time soon, he won’t be going anywhere for a long time. So he gets comfortable, takes a second to brush a stray strand of hair behind Draco’s ear, and turns back to his new friend.

“I’d like to disagree-“
They set up shop in the back of the apothecary, right next to a window so June can see when customers come in. Draco’s managed to get her on third year potions, thank Merlin. Today they’re brewing Grinding Potion, one of Draco’s old favorites. He would’ve failed his OWLs without it.
“No!” he struggles against his captor, “No! Let me go! He has to live!”

Snape looked equally shocked, if not slightly more relieved. “I wish I could correct you, but it appears I cannot.”

Draco can’t bring himself to tell the boy. Strange because it would be the perfect teasing material, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and this was one of them. Instead he focused his attention on Snape completing the lesson and doing something to someone’s toad. From the look on Longbottom’s face, it wasn’t hard to guess what happened.
“Tomorrow!”
Harry flips through the pages, all the same empty white staring back at him.
The Old Man yelled at her, accused her of something Draco personally knew couldn’t be true. No one listened to her when she said she didn’t even know
“Mum?”
Draco halfway wants to throttle her for being so reckless, but to be that upset would require him to acknowledge his emotions, and if he acknowledges one of them the rest will come out and he isn’t quite ready for that so he holds his breath, and his tongue, waits for the smoke to leave, and then sets the floor so Misty won’t accidentally kill herself.
Misty jumps to her feet, Salem startles, and Draco can’t bring himself to deal with it.
“I do think I agree with your friends. Think of it this way, allies are hard to come by, and you have two throwing themselves at your feet. This way you will be safer, and have the freedom to confide in whoever you chose, plus the contract sounds painless, if there was danger in it I would simply not allow it, but this seems more like your friends are rather protective of you. I daresay they have good reasons to be.”
them, we just have to get around them.”
Fleur glares, Draco’s rather impressed. His cousin’s glare is almost as good as his. “If you defile her I will be very cross with you.”
“I know it sucks, Draco, but you couldn’t control it.”
As if by some twisted fate, Lucius makes the mistake of walking into the room with a dazzling smile. “Darling! Sisily told me we had guests, I do apologize for being absent upon your arrival, the Ministry can be quite demanding.”
Harry perks up with other people talking besides the two ‘nerds’, “Why not?”
“Master Draco.” The elf bows, “Dobby did not realize he failed, he will burn his hands accordingly.”
“Then it is settled! We have come to an agreement, now you must excuse me, I have a meeting with Severus in roughly five minutes, I would assume he is not going to be pleased that I divulged so much of his personal life to you.”
Anyways, next week is The Chapter if you know what I mean.

----------
Malfoy formal robes for the Yule Ball, a note that said he could complain all he wanted to, but he was to wear them or face Lucius’s wrath and looking at the stupid frilly things sent him into a panic. So, ever the voice of reason in the Slytherin Dungeons, Pansy dared him and Blasie to go shopping in the muggle parts.
He’d give anything to wipe the look of innocence off the fuckers face, but Harry is in the room. Somehow, and only Merlin knows how he does it, they finish their conversation without any hexes being thrown. Draco’s half convinced he’s managed to get away with his little comment, but then he and Potter begin to take their leave for dinner and Dumbledore decides now would be a great time to add to Draco’s ever growing reasons to question his sanity.
Strange...it’s only two. Guests won’t be arriving for a few hours, Dudley isn’t even awake yet.
“I guess you aren’t the ever ravenous murderer then, are you cousin?”
Draco stiffens. “What do you mean? There is nothing to take care of.”
Draco points his wand right into the idiot’s eye. He doesn’t like the way LuLu hisses and tries to claw the man’s face. If he lowered her just one inch she could have her will and with the way Pettigrew keeps looking at Harry, he might ‘accidentally’ lose his grip.
Narcissa glares at both of them, “So you’re the idiot that has my son convinced he wouldn’t get himself killed during battle. I ought to hang you by your toes, Albus Dumbledore! Or let Lucius torture you!
He starts towards the door but Merlin damn him if Potter doesn’t speak once more.
He’s never been happier to hear Blaise’s voice in his whole life.
“And why would Harry Potter trust me?”
Myrtle buys every single line like Dudley at a bake sale. She literally melts into a puddle at Draco’s feet, swooning complete with heart eyes, looking like she’s seen some deity, and Harry’s one creepy comment away from snagging Slytherin robes and finding a different place altogether.
“What was that, Draco?”
Narcissa nods her approval, “Why Parvos Lumen?”
It’s exactly how he saw the same Bludger that he knows was coming to him fly right back to Potter.
Blaise replies without missing a single beat, “Ronald, you once stole a car and got caught. Slytherins are the least of her worries.”
“I’m perfectly fine, Mrs. Weasley.”
“Draco, you’re still a kid. You’ve been through horrifying things, and I get it, you feel guilty, but the people you care about don’t want you to die for it.”
“What? Afraid I’ll eat you?”
Fleur wipes her cheeks.
Putting as much magic as he can behind it for
Narcissa is glaring again, but her hair is calming down so that’s a start. Molly looks like she wants to protest, but after last year she’s more than willing to do anything to keep Harry safe.
They share another look, and this time Draco doesn’t have to wonder what it means.
“Please. We both know that wound didn’t come from Buckbeak,” Potter replies easily, never looking up from cutting annoyingly perfect roots.
“But I-”
“Absolutely not! Allowing him to play spy is one thing, but I refuse to push him into the middle of a war! He’s a

He takes a step closer to the desk, sealing his fate. “My name is Draco Malfoy and-”
No one in a million years would ever peg a Malfoy to be friends with a Weasley, much less casually appear in public holding Harry Potter’s hand. But he’s sure stranger things have happened and it’s no excuse for the blatant stares they’re getting.
“Why not?!” Theo barks. He lowers his voice so the entire hallway can’t hear their little argument as they make their way to breakfast. “Think about it, I have no experience, you have no experience. I’m meeting up with Justin after the ball, you’ll probably find your way into a broom closet with Pott-ow!”
Hermione fucking nods, taking a small necklace from her pocket that almost has Draco falling off the bed. “A time-turner?! Is
“I’m going with your friend Alice,” Blaise winks. Fleur does not see this as a winking matter.
Severus steps up next to them, “May I go with him-”
“Will he be staying long?” Draco asks, voice barely above a whisper.
“Then she’ll die, the Dark Lord will rise, and Potter will be devastated and in more danger than either of us can handle…”
As punishment for not paying attention and getting caught, Vernon exiles him to his room for the evening, no food, no water, not even his wand.
As soon as he’s gone Harry rushes to finish up the kitchen. The party is being held in the backyard, so he’ll spend the day gardening. Even so, food is being served in the dining room that has a clear view to the kitchen. He still has dishes to wash and he has to finish breakfast for his aunt and cousin and then clean up that mess and if Aunt Petunia’s kitchen isn’t ready by eleven then-
“Why would we know that?” Krum asks. He also looks like a fighter, dressed in an all black suit, Durmstrang symbol the only color on him. Harry wonders briefly if it chaffs as badly as he thinks it will, and then Cedric emerges from behind a sheet and that settles it.
“Ehwaz?”
Ignoring that fact that Potter’s room was ransacked and the diary stolen, Draco is having a good week. He and Blaise matched class schedules for the next year, same with Crabbe and Goyle. Pansy managed to score an art class, something they’d talked about all week long, and with Flint it had been non stop Quidditch. New tactics, were they going to face Gryffindor again? How to make his broom go faster. The minister hasn’t shown yet, but he can feel it coming. It’s in the back of his mind every step he takes, one of the many reasons he’s trekking it to the library instead of the match. That and a last-minute charms assignment.
to sleep at night. Contrary to what you believe, you alone are not responsible for Harry’s safety. This is why we have a team, why I told people about your existence, so that one person would not carry the burden alone.”
“I didn’t mean for them to die!” Pettigrew wails, “But the Dark Lord-”
There’s no reply so he feels the need to clarify.
Draco’s sure to steer Harry further away from the two teachers before he can ask what the nickname meant.
Oh, on second thought maybe this is a ‘welcome back’ present.

They don’t point out that during her speech she had inched closer and began lightly brushing her thumb across a perky white ear. LuLu gives her a questioning look, and then a single lick on her hand.

Merlin, he’s in no fucking spot to be giving advice right now.

And really, it’s the room that decides for them.
Why can’t he catch his breath? What is wrong with-he’s choking. He’s being choked.
“S-still! I can’t just

Pansy smacks his arm, “I meant that as a

for Draco to figure out the subtle differences. There’s a slight tremor in his left hand, but his right one is still. His shoulders tenses roughly a centimeter, and he won’t look anyone in the eye. Instead he stares either at the nose or the side of someone’s face, but never directly in the eyes. Draco’s thankful for it, he doesn’t know what he would do if he saw fear in Blaise’s expression and he never wants to find out.
Ron gives him a look. “Worrying. It’s only been a day, mate. We both know he gets exactly like Hermione. Give him another five hours, Blaise will probably drag him down to the room. If he’s not there by the time Hermione resurfaces, then we worry.”
“They’ll kill
“You-
Draco almost drops his paper right into his morning tea, turning much like every other student in the dining hall to openly gawk at Weasley, who, much to his personal amusement, has a howler. Oh his morning just got so much better.
“My wand- it’s not. It was in my pocket when we left.”
“Crabbe. Goyle. Let’s go.”
“It’s a pity he broke his favorite broom, but he still managed to beat everyone with a school one.”
From the looks of things, Harry was having a similar conversation.
The Basilisk he remembers was terrifying. Like he definitely almost shit his pants several times during their first meeting, but now the creature lies half in murky water, head barely hanging onto dingy marble floors. It looks pitiful and Harry knows, he
far away. “Call me Harry, sir. And yes, uh, this is just to see if it feels the same, right? I’m not actually doing anything?”
“It’s only five minutes away from here!”
“You still haven’t started on your Transfiguration project!” Draco warns, but he’s not resisting so Harry counts it as a win.
Every last one of his Slytherins came. Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Daphne (and Astoria),
“No one else was.” Draco whispers. “Alexandra was five when they came here and killed her.”
Lupin’s right after him, “Wasn’t killing your friends enough?!”
“I can’t be kidnapped if I’m supposedly an old man.”
Helga does not look the least bit like a friend at the moment.
Millie and Theo would lap up at the scraps Blaise and Pansy left them, going after the food, the curtains, Petunia’s barely passable self respect. Theo could probably take one look at Dudley and utter a single sentence to destroy him.

If we even try to communicate it, our mouths will be locked shut and anything we try to write will just turn out in a lewd drawing until you personally relieve us. I kinda can’t wait to see your gossiping ass draw a naked man during Snape’s class.”
Memory Draco disappears at the same time Dumbledore pulls him back and to his honest surprise, the second they’re back in the old man’s office, he’s dragged into ancient arms.
Snape stirs his tea thoughtfully before rising and pouring something into Draco’s drink.
“I’m sure that is what Severus thought too, and yet….”

“Thank you, darling.” Fleur smiles, “But I have to ask, what are you going to do with the boys’ garments?”
It’s a system he’s worked out by now. If he showers before Vernon drinks his coffee Vernon only gives him two minutes. One minute to figure out why there isn’t coffee, and one minute to figure out where the hell Harry is. If he does it after Vernon has had his cup then he’s cranky and will throw Harry out of the second story bathroom so he can use it for his early morning poops. But, if Harry catches that sweet spot right as Vernon takes the first sip, he gets a whole five minutes.
He finds four bodies all piled together, Ginny and Ron in the middle of the bed, as though the group fell asleep talking. Because they’re
Harry immediately perks up at his boyfriend’s name. Draco’s going to think his ancestry is just as cool as he does, and to be honest he owes Lucius and Luna the biggest ‘thank you’ of his life.
that bond came to be, all he knows is that it ended when Lucius died.
TW: homophobic language, mentions of past trauma, harry being dumb
His eyes grow wide, he starts toward Harry, what an idiot. Why would he come towards the fire-
“What? Did I do something?”
Maybe he’ll just smother himself with a pillow. It really would deal with a majority of his problems. His dad couldn’t ‘train’ him if he were dead, he couldn’t provoke Potter if he were dead, he could even stop worrying the people he cared about. Perhaps that’s a topic for another time, one where Weasley didn’t just ask a question he answers without his brain, and only Salazar knew where it had gone.
“The point, Potter, is that you’re right. And I don’t say that often, Merlin usually I’m cursing every decision and word you say but I’ve put a lot of thought into this and had at least three people trying to talk me into it.” He takes a deep breath, “See, at first I couldn’t be your friend because you didn’t know and it’s dangerous for you to know. My purpose is to keep you safe from danger, so keeping you far away from me was a pretty good plan until….well until you got it in your head to be friends. And sure, I had thought about it before because your friends always manage to get you into bizarre situations so maybe if I had a say in things you’d be safe, but I still thought it was too much to hope for. “
Ron and Harry look up from LuLu at her soft yell, not liking her expression.

He’ll typically read a ‘How To’ book, mess around in the Lab, play on the computer for a bit until Misty calls him for their shows, which he still doesn’t like. She found the first one on a lazy afternoon, playing with the remote, idly petting Salem. Something called Mr. Bean, but it really feels like watching the same show over and over. He really doesn’t know what’s worse, that or the American sitcoms Misty keeps managing to find.

Bloody hell, of course his father had to pick the end of an argument to show up from whatever corner he’d slinked off to. With his mood from Draco’s attitude this morning it's only a matter of time before Mr.Weasley- he's pushed aside as the father of the pack throws himself at Lucius. Oh, Draco will pay for that later. At least they're moving away from the children and not towards them….but that's equally as bad because soon they're all but thrown out by Hagrid of all people. It's only when they arrived back at the Manor, after a particularly vicious beating, his father
And no, he has not been counting the hours since he was sent to his bedroom, so he cannot pinpoint that it’s been seven hours, twenty four minutes, and thirty three seconds when there’s a knock on his door.
“I’m not complaining, of course,” Harry says as they sit down to eat, “They mean the world to me…”
Draco nods. He doesn't think Narcissa will have a problem with it, he’s just unsure about his dad. Lucius has been doing a lot of reforming, and Draco needs to know where his boundaries are. What better way to find out than putting him on the spot in front of his very liberal and scary wife?
“Excuse me? " He chokes, "I haven’t even tried out?”

“You is being too thin, Mister Draco.” Misty whispers.

On Mondays, he ventures out to Yellow Brick Rd., stopping by Mrs. Daisy’s shop. The second time he did it, Howie was waiting with a big grin on his face, much to Mrs. Daisy’s annoyance, and from then on it became common to see various shop owners coming in just to see him.
Fuck. He would have to let Dumbledore know about this. And Snape. Hell, he’d probably have to tell Potter too before he signed it. But, even if they all said no, he already knew his name would be on the stupid thing eventually.

Harry flinches as she takes a step forward, and then a large hand comes between them.
“No, but-”
“Away? Draco, you know you’re on probation, one wrong move could cost you your life. You know that if you leave the manor-”
Lucius nods, “I expect nothing else.”
“Ron! What are you doing? It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside.”
“Riddikulus!”
“Then it can’t be held on Christmas. We’ll do it on the twenty-ninth.”
Harry grins at him, and then waves to Geia, speaking in something that doesn’t really sound like hissing, but Draco can’t understand it so he guesses it’s fine. They lock the door behind them and are almost to the bathroom where they’ll have to part ways when Harry stops him.
A letter appears on his left thigh. Draco recoils like it’s burned him.
The twins shrug, “Sure we’re okay with it, if you’re friends he can’t be
“Well.” Draco blinks. “I read a lot, help Misty with the plants, take care of Salem, meet up for brunch, and have suddenly found myself swamped by paperwork.”
It’s really the only explanation and it makes a ton of sense.
alive, asleep on the hospital bed before them. True to Snape’s word his glasses weren’t broken, merely resting on his bedside table with water and various potions. Black hair fanned out over an unbroken face, his lips were even turned up in a smile as though he were having a sweet dream. He looked so peaceful Draco could almost forget, he would if he didn’t see the boy falling every time he closed his eyes. Draco also knows from personal experience that just because someone can sleep with a smile doesn’t mean they’re happy. Especially after being that close with Dementors.
“There’s not need to look so afraid, Hare-Bear,” Pansy tells him, “Draco would murder me if I hurt you.”
“He’s always been off the deep end. No offense to you and yours but I always thought your mother could do better. At least before the Dark Lord he wasn’t all that bad, but after…”
Tall, tan, with dark messy hair and weirdly blue eyes. A smile that’s a little coy, a little hopeful. Straight teeth,

“Yes.”
Harry. Do you get it now?”
in Latin, I do believe. Quite fitting for a creature such as she. Who got her for you?”
Hagrid disappears to grab something he doesn’t pay attention to, so it’s no surprise that Blaise glares back at the insulter as soon as he’s gone.
Draco exchanges a small nod with the two adults and gently shrugs off Harry’s hand. He walks over to the redhead as calmly as he can.
“I mean, there are more boring ways to die.”
instead of the half-hearted excuse he’d given because his mind was elsewhere, he’s free to go.
But none of the matters because Kingsely’s face drops.
“You have a sock? Are you….?”
“Let me go.”
Harry knows a killer is after him, he knows Hermione is going to kick his ass for this later, but he still follows her down the hill and bloody hell is he glad he did.
The footsteps draw nearer, Draco sighs. “When the time is right.”
“So there I was, the only Slytherin in our year at breakfast,” Pansy makes a point of glaring. Draco’s too out of it to notice, Blaise just doesn’t care. “And who came to rid me of my lonesome? Why Fleur, off course. And apparently, she’s finally gotten a date, and I asked if she knew what she wanted her dress to look like yet, and she said ‘no’, so I threw around a couple of suggestions, and

Apparently, he had produced a three headed snake, known to be both associated with the Dark Arts and piece of mind. The three heads each had their own purpose, and the unfortunate wizards who possessed them were destined to suffer, having not one, but three life changing events in store for them.

Maintaining balance of the three was supposed to be one of the most difficult things in the world, but once it was done it’s power was rarely matched.

Draco has walked in on a lot of strange things, but seeing his mother up at three in the morning, waiting in the kitchens like she knew he’d be down here is fucking up there on the list.
He usually would have been thankful for Charms, but Flitwick was mad over
Insane, how much a person could miss in four days.

“Yes actually.”
“Do you have a kitchen section?”
Pansy cocks her head, sitting her pillow next to Hermione’s on their shared bed. “Do what?”
“Ah, don’t mind him. He’s never been an elf of many words.”
Goyle looks panicked for a moment, “Um-”
Dread and anger filled his every atom. Harry Potter had Tom Riddle’s diary. The fucking Boy-Who-Should’ve-Died had the book that started all of this shit. He was three seconds away from grabbing his wand when the Female Weasley ducked her head. Blushing, looking at the book with wide eyes, horrified and embarrassed.
“Sir! I don’t want to be anywhere near that thing!”
“What’s she’s saying,” Theo interrupts with a bit of pink on his cheeks. “Is that you deserve a night out. That you’ll be getting with me, this weekend.”

He couldn’t find it in himself to resist even if he wanted to. Not when they both release sighs as they drag him to one of the couches and he doesn’t resist. Pansy stays with him while Blaise grabs his books, the boy returns the favor when she fetches her snacks, like he would disappear if they let him out of their sight. Before he can complain, the three of them are settled and words are coming to life out of the book on the coffee table. Comfortable, calming, safe. Between them, Draco could almost forget what he had done, what he was doing, what he would have to do. They were just three friends, enjoying a book by the fire, happy and young and with nothing bad that could reach them in their little bubble.

Buckbeak nods, easing his head under Draco’s hand like he’s saying ‘I get it’. It almost makes Draco smile, but then he feels those stupid emerald eyes watching him.
Draco knows more about Harry Potter than he cares to at the moment, which is his own fault really. Two of his housemates are extremely overweight, all three of them ugly and annoying as all get out. Always on about something trivial, always being rude to Potter, Draco's actually beginning to pity the boy, which is exactly how he knows he had heard enough.
Dumbledore grows quiet, somber enough that Fawkes raises his head and chips out a small song of comfort that brings the spark back into tired old eyes. “I’ll brew us some tea, then. I suppose I should send for Severus, it’s time I told you both the story. There is no hiding from the past when we need it to fix the future.”

Spouting something no doubt unflattering about Potter as he examines a set of skulls, at least two of them fake, how tacky, Draco moves closer to the eyes that are surely watching him. His father replies, not that he notices, staring at items useful for his actual survival taking his focus verses the conversation between his father and the shopkeeper.

Potter’s anger fades. He looks about as confused as Draco feels, but he does snort a bit, “Well you were there the last time I tried to learn something. Someone wasn’t exactly forthcoming with information.”
“It’s not my fault.” he hisses, but he can’t very well tell his father the truth about why his grades had slipped the previous year, so he settles for a quick jab at someone who

He doesn’t like the twinkle he gets back, “It is wise to never say never, afterall, no one can truly see the future, can they?”
“To what religion?” Sirius asks, completely amused by the whole conversation.
And then Lockheart came up with an idea for school morale.
Snape looks ready to murder him, but Dumbledore just smiles. “He’s right, Severus. Plus, he’s being helpful.”
the beginning of this is very gory! TW for gore, blood, darker story telling, and hurt characters.
Sirius doesn’t push Remus out of the way, but that’s only because Remus moves before he can. Sirius pulls him in for a hug, pulls back and grabs him by the chin, and then frowns and speaks in what sounds like rapid fire Latin so quickly Harry needs a second to process it.
Harry holds his hands up in surrender, “But you didn’t! No one got hurt! And everyone understands, they took your sister! I was ready to kill anyone who got in the way of me getting Ron, and if it makes you feel any better you looked like a badass the entire time!”
Now he’s back. Hermione thinks I might be able to see into his head, but Ron thinks I just have incredibly insightful nightmares.”
Candice: (shit-talking, being a generic asshole)
“Do we have to?”
And if Draco can make his patronus give Harry a hug, Harry can use his to summon someone he
Cedric.
Narcissa nods approvingly, “You’re correct, Pansy dear, so there are some things to fill out. Firstly, Draco, your father is recovering right now from the removal. It was painful, and he has suffered, but Snape and a few….friendly people managed to rid him of the flower.”
Maybe something simple like:
“Don’t bully him Pans.”
Mr. Crouch’s face pales, the other’s eyes widen.
“Really, Draco?! You know I hate peanut butter!”
Well, Granger is there, and Harry is passed out and probably getting drool on the desk.
at charms. Maybe they should work on their studies instead of spending their spare time glaring at him, or in Millie’s case, napping.
No one gives him an answer and that’s precisely the reason Draco still has his wand at the ready. He uses it to gesture at Black, “You haven’t told us your story yet. How

“Do you trust me?”
In other words, this is a whole lot of work to bind an elf to the ocean. At the rate they’re going, Draco might as well bind her to him and call it a day.

Misty gives him a look.
Salem perks his little head up, staring deeply into the soul of the shopkeeper before settling back down in Draco’s arm, apparently unbothered.

The meal is quiet but comfortable, no one asks any questions, no one stares too long. Blaise tells them about his two day adventure in Paris, his mother’s summer home that they escaped to just encase Narcissa got pissed and came for them. Mrs. Zabini didn’t ask anything, just made sure he was being safe. His punishment was a weekend with no English, but at least his French was sounding a lot better.
Draco frowns at him, “He’ll forgive you just fine, we don’t need Gryffindors stronger than they already are. It’ll be horrible for my team!”
“My father?” What could Lucius Malfoy possibly-“Oh.”

Tomorrow came with excitement. They woke early, ate breakfast by the fire, and then parted to dress. Draco donned his new silk shirt, white and bellowing out just above his rather high waisted black slacks. His shoes were surprisingly comfortable for new ones, and his coat even more so, with a pocket perfect for his wand. Narcissa dressed similarly in color, white dress and black coat. Joining hands around eleven, they looked around the manor and Apperated away.
Then he sits up straight, dragging Harry with him and nearly screams when Geia’s head pops up from the water.
“In what sense?”
“Back. Away. Slowly.”
had to say about it. They were in the crowd, boiling over with rage at his appearance, his weight, the bags under his eyes and his dead expression.
“Your father,” she begins in an angry voice that has Draco’s eyes widening, “could stand to be a little less of a blithering bastard sometimes. Now take your pet and go pack, we’ll have to leave early to avoid the Dementors.”
He’s not sure how Kreecher always leaves it just right.
Draco spins her, “Partnership. Eihwaz?”

pansy: and that's why umbridge deserves to have her heart ripped out
“Where do you need to go?”
Even Krum is giving him a funny look now, but it only lasts for a second and then Fleur is laughing, light and airy. She pops off her stool and crosses the room to pull him in for a hug.
it is until very familiar arms lift him out of his beach chair and carry him to the living room.
Harry, whose eyes are steadily drooping.
Draco whirls on the bird, “Is that where you’re trying to go? To Potter?”
His mother smiles politely, “Can I trust you four to look after him for an hour? I have some business to attend to before I can take him to his next surprise.”
“The gang?” George asks.
Draco kept his mouth shut, sipping his tea like it was the only thing that mattered.
Narcissa rolls her eyes, “Don’t push it.”
She returns the twinkle in his eyes, and it’s then that Draco notices she has something hidden behind her back. “Do you remember how I promised you two surprises in Diagon Alley?”
“By Potter no less,” Lucius sneers, “I thought I told you I would take care of that as long as you kept up your grades. I did not expect you to make an utter fool of yourself.”
He’s fourteen, alone with his cat, and in paradise. Maybe he could just stay here forever. Maybe if he begged enough, mother wouldn’t force him back into the shit show that his world has become, and maybe the guilt of leaving Harry to die wouldn’t be that bad after all.

“Shut up, Malfoy.”
mean to you.”
“Boys,” Narcissa chides, looking between Blaise and Draco, “Be nice. Clearly something has happened, and I didn’t put him here for you to yell at him, I put him here to explain. Harry, if you please.”
Draco opens his eyes, finally looking away from the window to judge how serious Kingsley is being.
And, like some type of fucked up karma, Dumbledore is out of the room before Draco can even think of a protest.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispers in his ear. His head feels so nice on Blaise’s warm shoulder, it feels good to grip onto something solid. Blaise rubs gently down his back and it somehow doesn’t hurt as much as he thought it would. Everything is just warm here, and when Pansy joins their little hug fest it feels like home.
“What? A bed?” Harry blushes. He kinda guessed that Sirius would stay mad about that for a while.
Blaise realizes the mistake he made the second Draco sends his infamous icy glare his way, rushing at an apology before he gets hexed like a first year had that morning. Pansy comes to his rescue, rubbing the boy’s arms. “If this is about Christmas break, Crabbe and Goyle are staying behind too, right? You won’t be alone, and you’ll have two perfectly willing people to bully.”
“Do you think he has a better opinion of the person who he hated even more?”
The disappearance was really the cherry on top.”
Men, for one, don’t have vaginas. Just bouts of insanity, rage, and all consuming one-mindedness. And Draco, as he is a man, can handle just about all of those. In fact, as a survivor of the Dark Lord, as Carla insists he calls it, Draco even considers himself an

the thing into the back of head, well, he knew it wasn’t right and ran back to tell Dumbledore. And then break had happened and his father was being weird, like really weird. Like getting mad at him for not befriending said Scar Face and ‘teaching him a lesson’ for it. He told them how things got worse and worse until the day before he went back when Lucius had given him his first black eye all while ranting about how the ‘Dark Lord’ was going to be so disappointed.
“Can you at least
know?”
“Allow me!” Lockheart yells.
Lucius, spotting Morgana: Harry....Harry needs a pet too...
The three watch hours of this, Draco being beaten, Draco tied to the wall, Draco with the Dementors, Draco getting cut, Draco starved, whipped, splashed awake by water, Crucioed, frozen, burned, kicked, slapped, taunted and cussed at. And then, just when he’s about to beg Dumbledore to stop, Lucius leaves Memory Draco passed out on the floor, only for one steel grey eye to peek open as soon as the door shuts.
Draco really expects someone to come in between their glaring contest, but then, to his astonishment, Weasley snorts.
“If you do it again I’m telling them. For now, we’ll keep it between us. But I get to inspect you every week for new ones, and if I find out this is what you’ve been using my medical books-“
As of this moment, all of Draco’s logic is gone. All of his years of studying, all the debates he had with Severus, the infernal
emotional trama, it doesn’t matter that Narcissa left him when he needed her most, it doesn’t matter that his father….nothing can touch him while he’s between them.

“Do you like it? I thought it was appropriate to celebrate!”

Harry shrugs. He’s had worse, but saying that probably wouldn’t do anything but make Remus angrier, and that doesn’t seem like a nice thing to do to the man who rescued him from the Dursleys.
“Mother!”
“Don’t mistake me, Mr. Malfoy, I won’t pry into personal matters so early in the term. Your life outside these walls is not my business unless you choose it to be. Should you decide to talk to me about things, I would be thrilled of course, but given your father, I understand if you don’t.”
“Your mother is worried for you.”
“He’ll be okay by the morning.” Harry tells her. “Nagini said that Snape has brewed her anti-venom too many times to count-“
“Draco?”

“Tomorrow.” Draco whispers back.
That Ron seems to understand, kinda. He doesn’t fully get it but the clock strikes four and he gets up to go. “Mum wanted me to de-gnome the garden before it gets dark.”
Also Draco, a horny teenager, upon seeing Harry: I am going to snog the shit out of him
“And life-threatening situations,” Draco adds.
“You also got it all over the floor.” Blaise chuckles, splashing his feet in the puddle they created. “Our mums are ready for us to go, Pans.”
It’s not as scary as it is in his nightmares, but maybe that’s because the monster that usually lurks in the darkness is tied up, or maybe because he’s not alone this time. Footsteps don’t echo in his dreams.
excited.
Potter
Harry snorts, rolling to his other side and grinning at a bemused Draco. “Good morning.”
There’s amusement playing in Snape’s eyes, the smallest of grins, a mere twitch upwards of his lips that’s basically the same as getting a full smile from the man. His voice shows none of this.
“Today, Draco.”
“-Of course he did-”
at Finnegan’s story. Like he wasn’t the least bit concerned about….Draco sucks in air. Potter doesn’t know.
“Absolutely not! You're only fifteen, you have two more years before you’re allowed to get your license!”
Oh well, it’s not like he hadn’t disappeared before. Except he hadn’t. Not on Sirius and Remus, at least.
Harry watches him go, and then he sees who he’s going to and nearly trips.
“Did you see?!” He says, turning excitedly to Fleur who hugs him and shouts something in French. Draco turns back to the steps where everyone else is frozen, and then he too freezes. Silver meets Green and for a second Harry almost believes Draco isn’t even that upset about the whole ‘missing’ thing.
“Yes. I am, would you mind-”
“Kreecher! Come over here, I’d like to introduce you to someone very special.”
Draco struggles against his hold, “Buckbeak hasn’t done anything wrong! He’s innocent-”
But that would mean Misty being alone again.
Misty, as it turns out, has lived a hard life.
She makes a fair point, so Harry stands, ignores the gasps coming from the crowd, and casually climbs on top of his sassy not-exactly-friend that can and will kill him if he makes a mistake. Except it’s not so casual and he does have to fucking climb her like one of those rock walls Dudley talked about after one of his birthday parties.
“There isn’t.” Mrs. Daisy sighs, “At least my oat milk has gotten better...but I can’t do much about the matcha, I haven’t the faintest clue on how to make
“He is being training in the runes gardens, sir.”
Mr. Weasley shakes his head, trying very desperately to tell him to let it lie, but he can’t. Draco steps behind Winky who freezes with his next words.
He proceeds to break down in hysterical laughter and Draco hasn’t the faintest clue why.
Myrtle is fucking
“Well, everyone, meet Peter Pettigrew,” his cousin manages to choke out, “He’s gonna be my first kill-“
Harry goes to turn his head but Remus stops him, grabs his chin and dabs something on there. He can’t
“But.” Harry blinks. “I didn’t say yes to taking her.”
It had been a lie, they both know it, and yet to question him in public was something he knows he’ll pay for later.
Stars twinkled down at them from the heavens, bleeding into lights from the village. Up in this tower, there was nothing but those calming twinkles, an escape of darkness that didn’t swallow up the world, but gently tucked all the worries away. Harry would have to wade through billions and billions of stars before he was allowed to face the real world, and that’s exactly why Draco had brought the boy up here.
The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher changed the room around from last year’s Golden Moron’s set. For the first time in at least a year the room looked like a classroom, dark wooden desks, a few odds and ends for decorations, no over the top dragon hanging from the ceiling, no weird golden bits throughout the walls, just a normal classroom. Draco felt like he would actually be learning for once, he was fairly excited about it.
Lupin clears his throat. “Well...I assume you all have my...condition...figured out.”
They all laugh when Blaise sends a pillows flying towards Ron’s head. Naturally that leads to a giant pillow fight, and Winky does drop in with a very needy LuLu that she deposits in the small space between Draco and Harry. Granted, that space doesn't last for very long before Draco and LuLu are both curled up on his stomach, his friend’s even breathing filling the room until he feels himself drifting off somewhere warm.
Christmas, so-”
Luna flushes,
broom, how are
“Something on your mind, Draco?”
He looks between them, Pansy and her big eyed pug-face, giving him the same concerning look his mother had the one time he fell out of a tree. Blaise, worry etched into his brow, looking like he’d aged overnight.
“Draco! I know you’re in there! Open this door at once! If I have to unlock it so help me-”
Fred and George load him up with more of their products. Ginny’s forked over a copy of one of her favorite Quidditch books. Ron hands him a charm of a king chess piece to go on the bracelet Hermoine got him, embezzled with claiming, protective, and warning magic that she and Narcissa did. Pansy grins at his ‘special hairbrush’ that will apparently ‘tame the worst of maines’. Blaise, because the ass thinks he’s funny, smirks at the large box in his hand, containing a singular, small, snake-bed. Theo, surprisingly not matching with Blaise, has gone the Neville-route and cursed him with a plant that will surely die in two weeks. Draco, in retaliation for last Christmas, merely avoids eye contact after Harry hugs his new dragon stuffed animal to his chest.
“Yeah…”Harry sighs, “Yeah, okay...but only because I don’t think my dad would want his friends to kill each other.”
“Don’t worry, princess, I’ll keep you warm-”
TW: hinted rough sex, memories of the war, mentions of violence and death,
“There’s berries in the garden.”
He had wanted to tell Potter so badly. To reassure him that not everything in the world was awful and out to get him, that the people who loved his parents were good people. But one look into those eyes broke his resolve, and the request for something happy completely shattered it. How could he offer something that would mean so much only to have it stolen away.
“I need to.” Draco whispers.
And to his and everyone else’s surprise Lucius doesn’t even blink. He grabs Draco by the shoulders and shouts, “And I’m not leaving
In the end Draco settles on a simple white since forest green cabinets will be filling most of the walls anyways. He does agree that a copper range hood with the same flower patterns as the sink seems practical, and that if he’s looking to use the new kitchen tonight, he might as well get some stools at the very least.
Life fades out of the trees, the pixies fade, replaced by humans who scream and then become stone at the Blue Basilisk's word.
“But-”
They end up debating over different flavor combinations for matcha, things like honey, almond, and chocolate because one can never go wrong with chocolate. In the midst of their debate, they completely miss the door opening, even with Mrs. Daisy’s little bell to alert them.
“Draco.” Pansy begins in a strained voice, “Explain. Quickly please.”
----------
Fucking hell. Draco groans once more, Blaise laughs from across the room, and he resigns himself to the fact that he will not be getting any sleep until Christmas break.
History lessons would be much more fun if he could call someone….which gives him a thought.
against his lovely floors, the delicate handles curve in the prettiest way, and the ‘walls’ are made of iron flower sculptures that dance all the way up.
“They refuse to replace his glasses-”
He can hear water dripping, senses the despair of losing flight, but the joy of clear water on wings, sharpening talons on cave crystals, learning secrets by crystal light. But one by one, the snakes with wings dwindle.
At least Potter has the decency to look ashamed, although the horror of everyone looking at him is much funnier. “No I’m not! Shut up, Malfoy.”
Harry tunes them out, turning to Blaise who offers a game of exploding snaps that Harry is more than happy to play.
His father had not greeted him, in fact this was their first interaction since he arrived yesterday. Narcissa was still in Paris and had no idea her son was home. Draco had left LuLu at Hogwarts out of fear that his father would hurt her somehow, but Lucius had barely acknowledged him the past day. It was almost nice…
am a Perfect. Nothing is about to attack
Harry leans back into him. He has to admit, while the bed is a little on the huge side, even for the two of them, the sheets and fifty pillows are wildly comfortable. Almost as comfortable as lying on Draco, or having Draco lie on him. Either way he’s not upset with their situation.
Red eyes lock onto Harry’s, the laughter fades. That stupid snake-like face turns stone cold, like a realizaiton in the making just slapped him in the face.
The annoying voice of a first-year, no doubt about that, sneaks him back to the present where Scar Face seems trapped, his friends holding back laughter. What a nuisance...then the reality of what’s being said slaps away fear with his most familiar emotion around Potter: breathtaking agitation.
That seems to strike a nerve, their eyes light up at the mention. Probably there for information, which is perfect seeing that he has none on the subject. Can’t leave them empty handed, plus this is a chance to clear out his house’s name. “I
“We wouldn’t dream of ratting you out, but Merlin, can’t you at least try to make better choices?! The stress is going to wreak havoc on my skin! I’m amazed you haven’t gone bald yet.”
dear.”
Ron’s just finished his own rant when the floo fire lights up again and a herd of Slytherins step out, lead by a ruffled Draco, of course.
“This is our rule board. There’s a chalk stick for me, Remus,
“Thanks.”
The room goes quiet and Harry swears he sees kindness in Malfoy’s eyes from his hiding spot. It must be his cloak playing tricks on him.
Draco raises an eyebrow, “Expected by who?”
“News?” Draco tries to still his legs, it doesn’t work well. He wants to be home
Harry isn’t the type of person to have the beginnings of an Unforgivable on his tongue.
Draco wants to refuse on the sheer fucking principle, but Cedric is starting to leave so instead he grabs the kid’s cloak. Cedric is nice. Cedric kept Fleur from killing Harry on the night the Champions were announced. Draco
“No,” Pansy laughs. She pulls away, all playfulness and kindness fading to the most serious expression he’s ever seen on her. “You guessed right, sir. There’s definitely a connection in there.”
The list of people he loves is weird and important. Some he loves more than the others, but he still loves. He cares, and he cares, and he
They’ve haven’t been avoiding Hermione, not exactly, they’re just been...making sure their heads stay connected to their bodies.
consider taking him for a week you know.”
Pansy hits him on the arm, “No, we need to test it! Blaise, try to tell a lie.”
This just got much more complicated.
That seems to appease the ocean, while Draco finds his stomach suddenly in knots.
