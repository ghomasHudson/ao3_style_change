They were silent for a moment, giving Harry the time to slip into his dorm and retrieve the cloak. When he came back out, both of them were moodily staring at him.
"Stop," someone said again, but John wriggled inside, hitting the gas pedal, but realizing he had no keys. "Keys, keys," he began searching, but looked upwards when a dark, cloaked figure stood at the window beside him.
“Wonderful!” Hermione clapped her hands, cleaning up the rest of her food on her plate. “Then it’s set. Ron will go as Dolores Umbridge, I’ll go as Bathilda Bagshot, and Harry will go as…”
“Well, I’m failing Charms, aren’t I?” Harry said resignedly, shoulders dropping. What am I going to take now?
Stepping fully into the clearing, Draco motioned for them to back away. He mouthed something, but Harry couldn’t decipher it.
I know it's been four years since I touched this fic, but I realized I never uploaded all the chapters I originally had uploaded on FanFiction.net (which, as I'm sure we all know, is basically dead by now). I'm considering revisiting the fic, but I haven't yet decided if I will, as I'm quite busy at the moment.
Malfoy peered up at Harry for a second. "Chop this." Malfoy handed Harry a piece of shrivelfig, and then resumed to reading his textbook. Warily, he began chopping, slowly paying less and less attention to the knife in his hands.
“Yes. Juicy. You were speaking with… your mother, I believe, through the fire? Yes, a very lovely, but rather snooty looking lady.” Malfoy scowled, but he still looked uncomfortable. “She was informing you of something. Something you need to do. Something you’ve already been doing.”
“I, uh…” The thought had never really occurred to Harry. “Well, no one found out, anyways,” Harry said sheepishly. Then, suddenly, something dawned on him. “Why didn’t anybody know?”
Numbly, Harry turned, walking slowly at first. He could hear the laughter of the Slytherins, Draco calling for him to come back, and the outraged shouting of Madam Pince. Everything felt like it was drenched in molasses. It was slow, and warm, like he was walking underwater. Things sounded distorted in his ears, students whispering as he walked past. He could hear Draco coming after him, felt a hand on his shoulder. Very slightly, he turned his head, pushing Malfoy’s hand off once again. Then, as the world seemed to resurface, Harry ran, his anger and hot cheeks catching up with him. No longer was he numb, and no longer was he empty. The world was moving rapidly now, his whole body hot and filled with flames. Faces streaked by, Malfoy’s voice disappeared. Something more strong than simple anger was flowing through him now, and he ran madly, running and running until he reached the door he was looking for. With a great, tremendous slam, he entered the Room of Requirement, shutting himself into a dark closet to fume.
“Harry! Wait-no-but it’s Malfoy!” Ron shouted, but Harry heard the sound of footsteps following after him.
"Aw, he doesn't know? I almost feel bad!" She giggled. "You tell him, Bailey!" She punched the small boy, and he grinned.
"Okay," Harry said warily, running over to where the bludgers were locked safely in place. "I'm going to release this, and I need you to hit it with the- Romilda, did you get the bat?" Harry shook his head, watching as she came down to pick up the bat, which was lying sullenly on the ground.
Though he'd expected to be kept up with thoughts of Dumbledore and the Battle, the memory of Draco's red, crying, and wholly undignified, un-Malfoy face kept towering over everything else. It seemed Hermione was right; no one had sat with him on the train, on the carriage, or even near him at the Slytherin table. Come to think of it, Draco had actually been sitting far away from his peers, estranged by a long line of First Years. He hadn't bullied any new students, or old students for that matter (not even Neville) and had kept entirely to himself. The encounter in the train was strange, and the one in Malkins stranger. Harry turned in his bed.
"Hey," Harry concentrated on him, trying to figure out if it was someone else underneath his face, "what's the curse that I used on you in that bathroom, sixth year, when you were… when we were duelling?" Harry said this as casually as possible, watching as Malfoy went from carefully protected and lightly formal to worried, his emotions rising to the surface.
"Really? See, when I ran into him, he was being… sort of civil, I guess. He was trying really hard not to argue, but I could tell he was pretty pissed…"
“I’m not entirely weak, okay? I don’t always need you to stick up for me. It was nice the first few times, sure, but honestly… I’d rather you didn’t.”
"So it's true? I heard from the Slytherins that you tripped in the hall, " Ron said gleefully. "Normally, of course, I'd never believe a word coming of those little snakes' mouths, but this was just too good."
“The Unknown Secrets of Potion-Making,” Hermione chirped factually, tossing the book over in her hands. It was large and glossy, a kind of pearly sheen painted on the spine.
"Hurry up, Harry," Mrs. Weasley said kindly, eyeing the full plate of hash he was currently destroying. The train leaves in forty-five minutes, and Ron's still got to pack his bag!"
Harry frowned. “I… I’m not sure. The Slytherins…” Harry then trailed off, remembering Draco’s wish. Don’t humiliate him, Harry thought.
“For not turning me in. For not telling him where the Gryffindor dorms are.” Harry put his head in his hands, watching Draco through his fingers. “I don’t know anymore,” he said truthfully. “You screwed me over, for sure, but it was all for protection… why’d you go and do something so-so Gryffindor? So bravely, awfully, stupid?” Harry paused, as if he was waiting for a response. “Unless, of course, you were just trying to save yourself. Again. To get me back on your good side,” Harry breathed, withdrawing his head from its bent position. “Who are you?” Harry said thoughtfully, “what do you want?”
“Good morning, Gryffindors and Slythersnots -- I mean, Slytherplops -- Slytherins… I know, McGonagall, I know… Welcome to the second match of the season! A fiery one, for sure.” Seamus had taken the role of commentator, and he was doing as good a job as Lee.
"What'd I say? To him?" At this, Hermione nodded. "I mean, nothing really unusual. He just… didn't respond normally. No teasing, barely aggressive. Maybe he was upset because I was talking about his father," Harry suggested, feeling a little guilty again.
“How?” Ron looked nearly hysterical. “How am I supposed to trust you on this? Harry, on all other things, but we saved that damn two-faced bastard from a fire — that’s about as far as I’ll go for him,” Ron’s brow was severely furrowed, his whole body contorted with anger. “I freaking hate him!”
The girl squealed, and Bailey stood back while he enjoyed the sight of Malfoy flailing in the water. "Oh, c'mon Malfoy, don't tell me we kicked you so hard you can't swim?"
"Yes, school supplies," Mrs. Weasley chirped, scraping more eggs on Ron's plate, "what's on the list this year?"
"Foolish, yeah," she nodded, stirring the fire again. "Hope he's okay, though. Got a family to feed."
They soon arrived at the door, pushing it open with great effort. A chilly draft blew on their shoulders, but they pushed on, entering the room. Strange, quirky music echoed from the left side of the room, where a group of somber looking ghosts were sliding the bows of their violins back and forth. Ron, who had looked quite normal until his entrance to the party, had pasted a sickly magenta heart onto his chest, displaying the word ‘SPEW’,  and was carrying a stack of Gilderoy Lockhart’s books.
“Harry, I don’t… I think I’m going to have to agree with Hermione on this one.” Ron cocked his head as if to say ‘sorry, mate’.
"Oi," another woman's voice broke out from across the fire, "shut up, will you? I think I heard something."
"You won't believe it, Dean," Seamus spoke quickly, "we went to Rome this summer, and me and me mum got to see the Pope!"
This notion was completely lost, however, when McGonagall raised her own head, speaking again to the students.
“Makes sense,” Draco said thoughtfully, “but it’s not like you’ve really ever cared what the press says.”
“But that was only the surface, Potter. Last night explains everything,” Bailey said grandly, taking great pleasure from the pale, sickly look on Malfoy’s face. “You see, last night,” Bailey licked his lips greedily, “I heard something along the lines of… ‘how’s it going? With the Potter boy?’” Bailey took Draco’s chin, holding it up. “And Malfoy said…”
“I-I just wanted to say,” Harry bit the inside of his lip, “that I’m really thankful that you saved me. From that Gehannan guy.”
"Oh-yeah-erm," Romilda grunted, firmly grabbing the handle of the Cleansweep. "All good!" She called, a broad smile stretched across her face.
"Ron, you're going to apparate home," Hermione said, frustrated. "There's no more walking around involved."
"Hi, Harry!" she called cheerfully, snatching up an old Cleansweep. "I thought I might make a good beater, and you know I'm always glad to see you! Especially after you and the Weasley girl broke it off."
"I know you two have a rivalry," Slughorn sighed, "but it is not okay to set students on fire, Mr. Potter, though I do admire your handiwork… What spell did you use on Mr. Malfoy?"
Instead of answering Hermione, Harry continued forward, nearly knocking over a whole shelf of books. He could actually feel his blood boiling — he was angry, and he wasn’t sure what he was about to do.
“Oh,” Bailey snorted, “says you. You’re the one sticking up for the bully. It seems you’ve forgotten just how awful little Malfoy is. He ruled over as all! For years! And then he couldn’t even do the Dark Lord’s bidding? Crying and pouting, because the job was too big for him… how sad. How very, very sad.”
Harry didn’t respond. He kept looking at Draco, until he noticed something that nearly made him jump. He was holding a small, glass vial, which held some kind of a clear liquid. He gave Harry a loopy smile, before taking the vial and reaching it to his lips.
Harry was falling, he felt so disgusting. He was sick to the core. His body ached. He wanted to scream at Draco, and yet he wanted nothing more than to be quiet, to lie down and be numb. Harry was too shocked to react properly. He wasn’t angry right now, he was just… empty.
"Harry, slow down, will you?" Hermione said sternly, taking a break from lecturing Ron, who seemed to be only half-listening, face buried in a pile of scrambled eggs.
Only Snape, Pomfrey, Dumbledore, and maybe some of the other teachers would have known that… Drat, Harry scowled.
Ron still looked grouchy, and Hermione seemed as if she wasn’t sure what to make of it all, but they both nodded wearily.
Slowly, they retreated, backing away until they could barely see Draco through the string of golden trees, leaves gradually fading into reds and browns. They had hardly taken a breath when Ron launched into a quiet, but heated argument.
“No, no,” Ron shook his head, digging into his trunk. “I bought these,” he pulled something large out of his suitcase, “on a whim, you know. Fred and George had been working on it before…” Ron’s eyes turned downwards for a moment, but Harry stood still.
"Potter! Malfoy!" Slughorn stumbled over, trying to remove the goo off his stomach. "What in merlin's name…" He gasped as he saw Malfoy's singed cloak and the bubbling elixir, which was still emitting an unpleasant-smelling smoke. "What happened here?" He demanded, eyes wide.
Breathing heavily, Harry ran up to the castle, hoping that no one would bother Draco further as he laid on the bank, injured and helpless.
Nothing seemed to transpire for a few minutes; Pete stood, axe held up high, while Patricia and John quaked in their seats, anxious. Then, in an instant, a bright flash of green light shot out from the forest, trees illuminated in a vibrant, electric ray of chartreuse. Pete dropped to the ground, limp, and his axe clattered over the log, into the fire.
"It is," Malfoy said softly, and Harry gave him a bizarre look. Maybe someone's drinking polyjuice, Harry worked out, and this isn't really Malfoy.
Slightly pouting, Ron went back to his eggs, which didn't seem to be disappearing despite the continuous pattern of fork to mouth, mouth to fork. Soon enough, the three of them had finished breakfast, and Ron had scampered upstairs to get dressed. Mrs. Weasley had put on the radio, and Celestina Warbeck's voice belted through the house, causing Harry to give Hermione a good-natured, but exasperated glance. Once everyone was dressed and fed, Mrs. Weasley ushered them out the door, but not before handing Ron his list, which he'd almost left behind.
Slowly, Harry watched a trickle of first years stumble in, all looking equally nervous. His stomach growled, remembering that he couldn't eat until everyone was sorted.
"Look here, Malfoy," Bailey's tone was dangerous, "there's a new movement. Someone… new. To lead us. Someone like You-Know-Who," he bent down to be level with Draco. "He's coming for you, Malfoy," Bailey whispered, smiling. "Unless, of course, we do it first." With this note of finality, Harry watched in horror as Bailey and the taller boy shoved Malfoy to the ground, kicking him. The girl kept jumping, excited, watching as Bailey hauled Malfoy into the lake.
Head spinning, Harry started walking down the hallway, confused for the millionth time over an interaction with Draco Malfoy.
John, watching in terror as someone's boot slipped from the forest's cover, began running at an amazing speed, pelting through the thick undergrowth.
Draco shuddered. His face was wet, cheeks splotchy, just like that night of the start of term. He was crying. Big, horrid sobs racked his body, shooting through him like an electric current. His body twisted as he rolled to the floor, curling into a ball. His knees tucked into his hands, and he fit his head into the space between his legs and his stomach. Momentarily paralyzed, Harry stared, watching as Draco became no bigger than a cushion, all wrapped up and breathing shakily. He turned, ignoring the pricking need to help him, and settled into the robe. He doesn’t deserve my help. He used me. Harry pushed his head into the back of the closet, temples scraping wood. He closed his eyes, stomach and heart aflame, wishing just to sleep for a while. Just go away, Draco. Just go away, please.
“No, I happen to enjoy both drowning and pushing people,” he said lightly, a cruel grin spread across his face.
"Little daddy's boy hasn't got any influence, has he? Been moping around Hogwarts, acting more like a Hufflepuff than a Slytherin… I wonder, how's this goody-two-shoes business working for you, eh? It's cute and all, but how long can you keep it up?" A slightly smaller man circled the boy, obviously proud of his taunt.
"I didn't know," the woman said crossly, her scowl hidden by the night. "Maybe he really did just quit. You two are always looking for excitement. And trouble," she added, turning away from both of them.
"Hopefully he'll behave better this year," Ron said grimly, making his way to the front door. "Hey, Hermione, Harry, I'll see you outside, yeah?" Ron jerked his head towards the hills outside, dragging his things behind him.
Hermione looked a little sheepish. “I’m not a daredevil, it’s just, well, why bother with Filch anymore, right? We’ve done braver things.”
"Sorry, didn't see you there," Harry said sheepishly, snapping his head up. However, as his looked up, what he saw almost made him jump. "Oh… Hello, Malfoy," Harry's voice lacked any contempt, too surprised to make jabs.
you happen to completely ruin the reputation of one of the most powerful pure-blooded families in the Wizarding World? And in a
Almost taken away by thought, Harry didn’t notice the snitch until Draco had seen it. Luckily, Malfoy was slow this morning, beaten back by the rain, and Harry, with a new rush of adrenaline, swept forward and pushed Draco aside. Reaching with great might, he extended his forearm until his fingers, splayed out and white from the pressure, were almost touching the snitch. Malfoy rode up alongside him, straining against the winds. Specks of rain started to pelt from the sky, light at first but slowly worsening. Harry’s glasses were fogging up, but he wouldn’t let a little glass get in his way. With a surge of strength, he stretched forward. Draco’s hand was too close, and Harry tried to bat it away, but it came flinging back. Malfoy tried the same tactic, hitting Harry’s knuckles, but instead their fingers suddenly entwined. Harry looked at Draco with disgust, flicking his hand away, but not before he saw the look on Malfoy’s face: his face had been changed to one of surprise and nervousness, as if he was frightened that he’d just touched Harry. Dashing away, Draco abandoned Harry and the snitch. With great felicity, Harry snatched the snitch in one grand, sweeping motion, stopping short and slowly falling towards the ground in a bottle-nose dive.
Hands carded softly through sweat-heavy hair and caressed damp skin. Once their breathing was back under control, Harry whispered he was sorry about the slight scarring Draco still wore on his chest until Draco kissed away the need for apologies. A little while later, Draco whispered he was sorry for Dumbledore, saying he would never have gone through with it, only stopping his mumbled words as Harry tightened his grip on his waist. It was the first time they held each other, even as they slept.
’ Draco was certain he’d never seen the matron so energetic and enthusiastic before. He’d almost recommended she take a calming draught.
“Er… what now?” Harry became increasingly aware that they were now alone, with nothing to do. Would Draco mention the incident at the lake?
Draco seemed to notice, and shook his head. "I'm not going to kill you, Potter." At this, Harry scoffed.
"Yeah, but who knows if I'll keep everything together," he winced, most likely remembering the splinching incident.
Harry gaped. What? Obviously, Malfoy had no idea what he had just said, but the gravity of it had an impact on Harry. He stood for several seconds just staring at Draco, utterly shocked. Did he just say he’s… a marauder? Not sure if he was going to laugh, or cry, Harry stood still, watching Malfoy talk to Slughorn. It’s not like Malfoy’s done anything, but… he’s such a little twat!
“Who do you belong to, then?” Enquired Harry as he began to untie the letter. As soon as he had the letter free, he offered the owl a treat, which it turned away from and hooted disdainfully.
“If you would be so kind as to keep your cavorting to the privacy of your own chambers…” Severus’s tone was sharp and cold and Draco found he was sorry when Harry hastily jerked back from the kiss.
“I can’t— I need to sit.” Draco pushed himself away from Harry and slumped to his knees, leaning against the partition wall. A split second later, Harry was sprawled alongside him, their shoulders pressed together as they both fought to catch their breath. Although Harry cast a quick cleaning charm, neither man thought to cover themselves, opting to leave their clothes lying on the floor, their boxers half off and straining around their lower thighs as they rested.
“You know, for someone who spends their time practically stalking Malfoy, you don’t really notice much, do you?”
"Well, so would you if you had to deal with the idiots that have been turning up at the library lately." Draco rested his head on Harry's shoulder and took a steadying breath before continuing. "Teenagers should be locked up. They're so bloody disrespectful!"
Draco yawned as he poured himself another black coffee. He was so tired he didn’t think there was a word for it. He’d always wondered how many children he would have when the time came, and this whole debacle just confirmed the niggling suspicion he’d always had that maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t cut out to be a parent. If his mother wanted a Malfoy heir then she was going to be sorely disappointed!
And yet, here they were. Personally, he blamed Granger. He bet her know-it-all eyes lit up when she received the invitation, and the other two had no choice but to go along with her mania. The thing was, he knew she wasn’t stupid. Granger had bested him in every subject in his Hogwarts career. She had to know that he’d be there, that people would expect it as part of his neverending atonement, so to show up practically dragging Potter by the scruff of the neck was so cruel it had to be nothing short of a personal vendetta.
“You never do, do you, Potter?” demanded Pansy, her eyes blazing with anger. “Do you have any idea what the fuck you’ve just done?” She moved past Harry, bumping him hard with her shoulder as she passed. “You guys talk to him. I don’t even want to look at his stupid face.”
“Circe, a Weasley has just agreed with me of their own free will.” Pansy heaved a sigh, her pretty hair flicking left to right as she shook her head in wonder. “If there was ever a sign the end was nigh and we were all doomed, that was it."
Harry felt his eyes widen in horror as he took in Malfoy’s bed hair, the lean muscle of his arms folded across the chest of his tight black t-shirt, his pale bare feet sticking out of the bottom of his blue pyjama bottoms.
"Do you like it?" she asked, licking her lips lasciviously. "It made sense since you're going to massage me, and I was feeling just so hot from being around you."
“There will be several cars, each one with a Muggle-born witch or wizard who will be your driving instructor. You are all required to adjust your mirrors and observe safety, start the car, drive forwards for one hundred yards, turn, drive back to where you started, and stop. Anyone not observing safety measures, being insulting, or generally interrupting class, will be sent directly to Headmistress McGonagall for punishment.”
Draco watches as Harry greets each individual duckling, taking care to pet and coo over Pavoa as she recovers from yet another near-death experience.
You have no idea how many times I used to lay awake at night, right next to you, listening to the sound of your breathing. I used to watch you sleep, pretending that you were there by choice and not because some crazy magic had bound us together. I used to torture myself by holding your hand when you were asleep, closing my eyes and imagining that you wanted me even a fraction of how much I wanted you.
“As you may be aware, every magically-abled person has a twin, a magical soulmate, if you will. The spell essentially enters the patient’s magical core and seeks out their core twin. The results are conveyed back to the Healer, who can then take the appropriate action thereafter.
At first, Draco wasn’t sure if Potter had heard him — he certainly gave no evidence of it — but after a long moment, he raised his gaze to look Draco in the eye. Even then, Draco wasn’t sure he was actually going to say anything. Eventually, in a broken, scratchy voice, he began to talk.
"Shhhh, it's alright," Blaise reasoned, rubbing small circles at the bottom of her back. "I bet Harry is freaking out way more than you are. Believe me, you look hot, and he hasn't been interested in a woman in ages. You're totally intimidating him."
Harry watched as Draco pulled the suite door closed behind them and made sure it was locked, before heading off alongside Harry to the elevator. "I bet twenty quid that I see more barracuda than you do."
With that, Severus sat down at the desk in his portrait and resumed reading his book. Draco wasn’t worried, however, he knew that Severus was still alert and would offer advice if he needed it. He pulled a large reference book back towards him along with the article, determined to choose the right components of Harry’s essence without verging on creepy territory.
“You don’t want me to stop, Harry.” panted Draco, pressing his erection onto Harry’s. “I can feel how much you want this.”
He slid a little closer, appearing oblivious to her rising discomfort. However, before Draco could begin to enjoy Hermione's discomfort, his mobile rang with yet another unidentified number. He fought back a grin and answered, ready to play his part to perfection.
Draco stayed with his arms wrapped around his mother for several long moments, unwilling to let her go just yet. It was surely hopeless, but he would talk to Severus before hanging up his wand and picking out a casket.
"She's right, Granger." Blaise gave her a quick once over as Pansy manhandled her out of her blouse and nodded. "That's good, but you should hike your skirt up a few inches too. Give him a bit more leg."
movements alone in my room, I found myself thinking of you." Oh Godric, what was he even saying? He felt so
“Of course. I’m not Longbottom,” drawled Draco, rolling his eyes in mock exacerbation. He reached into his bag and pulled out a large clump of parchment. Sighing, he plopped himself down at his workstation and began to flip through the pages, his eyes moving frantically from side to side and he scanned the information he’d managed to gather so far.
Which was how Draco found himself squatting alongside Hagrid next to the shielded nest. Upon sight of him, the ducklings began standing on wobbling legs and making their way towards him, crying needily for him all the while. Cries that became the most cutting of screeches once they reached the shield barrier and found they couldn’t actually reach him.
“You need to stop thinking of your sickness as a taint, which would necessitate the use of an antidote. Nor is your sickness a curse, which would rule out the use of the many cures littering your list. It
He climbed into his side of the bed and pulled the heavy quilt over his weary body. Harry wouldn’t be long and then they could talk. Draco found himself thinking of all the things he needed to say, as if he were preparing for some grand speech. After several long minutes, Draco’s eyes began to flutter closed. As his breathing began to even out, he couldn’t help but think how fitting it was that he would be left, used and alone, on what was essentially his wedding night, Harry’s note still clutched in his hand.
Draco felt like a deer caught in a Lumos as Hagrid peered down at him with a hard look in his eye. It was only thanks to his Malfoy-breeding that he was able to resist shrinking and fidgeting under that stare, but only just. After what felt like an age, Hagrid seemed to make a decision, grunting in what Draco assumed was assent as he snagged his moleskin coat from the peg and stepped quickly out into the rain beside Draco and thudding the cabin door closed behind him.
Draco barely fought back a groan at the idea of his mother interfering once again. What the hell had she said to Potter? Not that Potter rightly gave a rats arse about ex-Death Eaters like himself. Draco didn’t bother to look up at the sound of spike heels fading as his mother clipped out of the infirmary. He looked over at Potter and noticed his face was blotchy, as if he had been crying, or had been slapped on both cheeks. Personally, Draco hoped it was the latter.
"Yes, very nice. Harry will likely crumble at the sight of your tits and long legs. Congratulations."
“You know what? Nevermind. Just forget it.” The words were barely legible, Harry’s voice horse through his gritted teeth. Draco watched as Harry reached up and yanked several hairs from his head and dropped them onto the workbench. “That’s the hair. What else was it?” His voice was dull and lifeless, all the things Harry wasn’t, and Draco felt as if he couldn't stand it.
“What do you want me to say, Harry?” Draco sighed heavily, wishing it were already tomorrow. “It’s not that big of a deal. What is death? I mean, really? There are worse things.”
“You know what, Potter? You’re on. But don’t wear those trainers. And comb your hair for once. And bring your galleons because Malfoys are not cheap dates.”
“Not yet,” Harry explained, beginning to inch his fingers closer and closer to Draco’s arsehole. “I need to make sure you’re open, remember? I don’t want to hurt you.”
Severus didn’t need to vocalise that Draco was right — the ghost of a smile lifting the corner of his mouth and the slight sheen of pride in his eyes was more than enough for Draco. Quickly, he pulled his notes closer and began to scribble furiously, pausing now and then only to look up dosages and preparation of volatile ingredients in the ancient-looking reference book next to him. He was close to solving it; he just
Pansy nodded. "You've got this. We've been listening in this whole time, and you're doing amazingly. That whole thing with the wand? Priceless!"
Behind him, the door opened and thudded closed, signalling the arrival of Potter — Harry. They were bonded, surely that put them on a first-name basis? He turned around and stared at Harry, the way his silver robes hung from his sloped shoulders as he leaned against the closed door. Draco found himself meeting Harry’s stare, noting that he looked about as happy with the current situation as he himself was. They found themselves holding the melancholic look, breaking it only to blink heavy lids over wet eyes. The silence stretched on between them like a gaping chasm. They both knew what came next once it was breached.
Harry looked at each of his friends with impatience. Couldn’t they see that he didn’t have time for this? Malfoy already had a head start, although Harry had a fair idea where he might be headed.
This time, Malfoy didn’t send the note back, and Harry was left twitching about in his seat in frustration, which earned him a nudge in the ribs from Ron and more than a few disapproving looks from Hermione. Finally, the lesson ended, and Harry saw Malfoy leave the classroom, the note still on the desk where he had sat.
“I am an adult. Yes, you may be my mother, but I’m no longer your little boy. I stopped being one when you stood by and watched the Dark Lord brand this —” Draco stepped closer to his mother and held his marked forearm aloft in front of her face — “mark onto my arm. You need to let me make my own choices, because they
“If you keep agreeing with Gran—” Draco broke off as Pansy glared at him and quickly corrected himself. “If you keep agreeing with Hermione, I’m going to have to send you the bill for my therapy.”
With those final words of warning ringing in everyone’s ears, they all shuffled out of the classroom and made their way down to the Quidditch pitch, some more enthusiastically than others. Draco couldn’t help but feel as if he were walking to his execution.
Every step he took brought another introduction, another well-wisher, another grateful fan. If only he’d brought his cloak as he’d originally planned, but Hermione refused to entertain the idea. It hadn’t seemed worth it to argue. Just when he thought he couldn’t take it anymore, McGonagall had parted the crowd like a tartan-clad Moses, telling everyone to let him have some refreshments before he suffocated. He’d honestly never felt like kissing anyone so much in his life. As far as he was concerned, she was
Neville's legs floated into the air and Draco plopped down, cancelling the spell, Neville's legs falling onto Draco's lap.
Harry looked back over at Malfoy, a swirl of emotion scorching his chest like heartburn. Why come to a reunion if you were going to hide in a corner alone? A tingling of unease crept into Harry’s stomach as he took in as much of Malfoy as he could. His robes, obviously expensive and chique, were opened at the neck as if they’d been too tight against his throat. His pale skin looked almost grey and the lights reflected off of his forehead as if he’d been sweating heavily.
"You, Mr Potter, are a Godsend." Harry gently placed a soft kiss on Draco's lips and sent him off to sit on the sofa, before busying himself with getting Draco's favourite wine out of the cupboard. Draco was obviously struggling right now.
a part of you, despite its malfunction, and it is simply in need of repair. You must identify which items on your list are focused upon magical repair and go from there.”
“What the actual fuck—” demanded Weasley angrily, pulling Blaise away from his sister before turning his fury on Draco. “What did you do to her?”
Harry had no idea what to do. He’d always sucked at comforting crying people. It had been one of the things Ginny and Hermione had always moaned at him about. This, though, seemed different. More raw. He began to slowly rock them both, smoothing his hands over Draco’s hair and back as he murmured soothing noises into Draco’s ear. After a while, the shuddering had stopped, and Draco was still and silent.
"Pans, you're not making a lick of sense." Neville got up off the couch and went to calm her down, obviously worried at her being in such distress. "Was it bad news? Is it your mum?"
"Hermione danced?" asked Draco in obvious delight. No doubt he would be asking Harry to show him the memory in his Pensieve later.
Draco knew he was staring, but he couldn’t help it. Potter’s body was utter perfection. The muscles in his chest flexed as he breathed, and Draco wanted to touch them and feel them ripple beneath his fingers. His eyes zoned in on Potter’s pecs and saw there were rounded beads of sweat gathering there, some dripping their way down towards his waistband. Draco wanted nothing more than to press his tongue to them.
It had been several weeks since Harry had had his first breakthrough with Draco. Now that he was eating and sleeping much better, Draco was looking much healthier. It had taken some wheedling, but Harry had managed to get him to agree to see a Healer and take his prenatal potions every day, although he endured it with a sour attitude each time. His personality was slowly emerging, and Harry found himself living for the days when Draco was in the mood to argue with him. Draco had reverted to calling him the old taunts, but they had lost their edge, and Harry fancied there was even an undertone of affection in them.
“Fuck. I just— fuck!” Harry took a large swallow of his whisky, revelling in the burn as penance. “I’ll fix it. Somehow, I’ll fix it.”
Hermione’s gasp felt like a shout in the otherwise silent room. Harry turned from the disappointment on her face towards Ron and was rather unsettled to see he also looked uncomfortable at Harry’s behaviour.
He had no idea how long had passed since they began to kiss, but Draco knew he wouldn’t last much longer. The heat and pressure, the push and pull of the whole thing was too much, almost overwhelming, and he felt sure that he would combust any second. It seemed Harry was feeling something similar, as with a final few thrusts, both men reached their orgasm, spilling messily onto each other’s body. They continued to rock their bodies together as they rode the final waves of their high, clutching and kissing as they groaned their way back down to earth.
"Oh, okay then," Draco said with a smile and blew at his scalding tea. "Was there something particular you watched to catch me up on? Did you finally ask that bloke out from the second floor?"
“No, you were harassing. Ron has a point, though. If you want to be an Auror, you’ll need to pay more attention to what’s actually going on around you and not just what you want to see.”
“You can’t really believe that.” Draco couldn’t keep the defeatist tone from his voice. It felt as if he’d done nothing but think and talk about it ever since his diagnosis.
“Oh for— Fine.” Potter’s face looked murderous as he faced Draco. “Malfoy, I’m sorry you’re so sensitive that the room decided to hold us all hostage. There.”
“Can I get you more tea, Mrs Malfoy?” Harry asked tentatively. The last thing he needed was for her to faint or something.
“That’s it! Harry, you were being a bit horrible to Malfoy and then the door wouldn’t open. Maybe you've got to apologise!”
Once her top half was decent, she quickly rolled her skirt back down to the proper length and grinned goofily at the room at large. She had to admit that once the shock had worn off, Harry and Draco made a pretty amazing looking couple.
With one last furious look at her friends, Hermione stepped back into Harry's flat, closing the door behind her.
I know I ran away when the Healers said the bond was stable, but it was because I couldn’t face being so close to you without a chance of having you the way I so desperately wanted.
Draco found himself absently following alongside Greg on the way to the Great Hall. If he had ever thought about reconsidering his decision about Potter being his core mate, this only made him all the more certain that he had made the right choice.
"Keep still, Hermione, or you're going to end up with lipstick on your eyelids instead of on your lips."
He leaned his head back against the wall and sighed heavily, the stabbing in his lungs making the simple act that much more difficult. He tugged a shaking hand through his hair, letting his fingers form a fist, and pulled, hoping the sharp pain would help anchor him. It didn’t, but instead simply mixed with the pain that was already working its way through his body. The small reprieve he’d gotten from the bonding ceremony made the return of his symptoms that much worse. He knew he was nearing the deadline for the bond to be either consummated or nullified, but he just couldn’t bring himself to care.
It was a lovely surprise to see your green eyes open so wide and your lips wobble slightly as you said my name, followed by a swearword (always so classy, Potter), followed by the most tender “I fucking love you, you idiot” I’ve had the pleasure of hearing in my life. I have to confess my knees were a bit weak when you grabbed me by the collar and brought me closer. I didn’t even make it inside before you started kissing me breathless. I think I might have smashed a couple of the mugs while I was trying to get inside and shut the door.
"So," began Draco, after the waitress had brought their cups and Pansy had been sitting staring at him for at least a minute, "you wanted to talk to me about something?"
“What the—” Harry looked from Seamus’ alcohol-flushed face to Dean’s slightly sheepish one in fury. “What the ever-loving fuck are you two doing here?”
“Yeah. At first I thought he must be up to something so I tried coming up with a list of evil duckling-related plots, but it turns out he’s genuinely looking after them. So, I sort of thought—”
Thankfully, he realised it was futile to argue and sat down across from her at the kitchen table, beginning to tell her what he knew so far.
Harry smiled at Kreacher as he set a fresh pot of coffee in front of him. The wrinkled elf nodded and turned back to cleaning the stove, mumbling about coffee not being an appropriate breakfast choice.
The morning found Draco sitting on the window seat, his eyes heavy from lack of sleep. Harry had worked him pretty hard the night before, wringing two orgasms from his tired body before falling into a boneless sleep. Draco had lain next to him, laden with jealousy. By all rights, he should be snoring in just-fucked bliss, but he was terrified to close his eyes and miss a single moment of his time with Harry. He was just one step away from finalising the potion, that ever-elusive final ingredient, and then Harry would be off. Free.
“You think I’m doing this because, what, you think I’m trying to pay my way? My vaults are hardly empty, Potter.”
"Not at all, dearie. In fact, you're welcome to stay the night if you want. I hate being in the flat when Draco works late. It freaks me out."
"Well, I'll be thrilled to see what you do with it this time!" Slughorn chuckled, stepping in front of the Elixir again. "I'll be dividing everyone into pairs, and- no, Mr. Weasley, you will not be working with Mr. Potter," Slughorn glanced at Ron, who had tugged on Harry's robes. "In fact," Slughorn peered around the room, "I'd like two of my best potions students to work together. Harry, will you sit in the empty seat next to Mr. Malfoy?"
The two stood in a cold, icy silence for a few seconds, Ron and Hermione's argument seeping into the room. Harry shrank back, not used to this change in character, half-wishing for Malfoy to tease him back.
“Harry, you should know that it wasn’t very easy to give up my status like that and follow you around like a- a lovesick puppy,” Draco was going paler by the minute, and his significant tallness loomed over Harry.
“Er-bye, Filch,” Harry said, body whirling, and went after his friends, blocking out Filch’s demanding screeches.
"Aw, look, Malfoy's all upset now," the girl laughed, "how weak! I mean, Malfoy, I really want to know; how
“No.” It was all Harry could manage to say. He realised he was clutching the fabric of his robes so tightly, his nails had drawn blood in his thighs. “No,” he repeated, turning to Draco. “No.”
Hermione sent Ron a glance that told him not to push it further, and Harry was thankful when Ron didn't pursue.
Harry frowned, but then understood. He was a Death Eater… they might let him die. Nodding, Harry clasped his hands together in his lap.
The knot in Harry’s stomach twisted. What’ve I done now? He thought, but something in Flitwick’s voice made him think it was bigger than just breaking school rules. Following him through the halls, they quickly made it to the gargoyle, at which Flitwick whispered the password. Watching the great statue step aside, Harry was led into the staircase and up to McGonagall’s.
Suddenly, something heavy crashed into Harry, sending him skidding across the floor. The stack of immensely thick books he was carrying scattered across the hallway, open and upturned.
he concluded, unable to come up with a sensible answer to Malfoy's behavior. Harry supposed it was for the better; Hogwarts definitely didn't need another conceited, openly mudblood-hating Slytherin.
They were sitting in the common room, the last sparks of fire dying out. Everyone else had gone to bed, but Harry had told Ron and Hermione that they needed to talk.
“Ron…” Hermione chose her words carefully, “do you remember what I said to Harry, after that day in Madam Malkins?”
Harry sat down, slumping in his seat, and turned to Malfoy, who looked furious. However, the instant he looked over, Malfoy's walls went up, and he sat down placidly next to Harry.
After a minute, Malfoy turned up again, this time with a brow raised. "Well?" He coolly demanded, and Harry was speechless.
"Huh? I only heard the 'self-righteous, arrogant bastard' part," Ron responded, only for Hermione to moan something about him being 'so unsympathetic'.
“Oh, no, not at all, Mr. Potter. You’re doing just fine in Charms,” Flitwick paused, taking a breath. “I believe I have some rather grim news… I think it best if you come with me, to see Headmistress McGonagall.”
"Oh, yeah, it's next weekend… Ooh, I know, we could both go to Madam Puddifoot's, instead of Quidditch! Doesn't that sound even better, Harry?" Romilda jumped up and down, startling him.
They continued this mundane ritual over and over, until slowly, the pile of unsorted potions ingredients were placed rightfully into their own boxes.
“It didn’t work, did it,” Pansy clicked her tongue, though there was something distant about her posture.
“Mr. Potter, you can take a seat here.” McGonagall pointed to a vacant chair in front of her desk. Once Harry had been seated, she immediately launched into conversation.
Just because you’re an insensitive prat who runs at the first hint of difficulty doesn’t mean I love you any less.  Of course, I was going to help you! Idiot.
“I’ve no idea,” smirked Draco, reaching for the coffee pot. “Although I imagine it was somewhere around preparation.”
“I didn’t know, you know, that you were sick. You always seemed fine, and I made sure I never looked close enough to notice anything different.” Potter sucked his lower lip into his mouth and began to worry the plump pink flesh with his teeth as if he were debating how best to articulate his thoughts. “Everyone lied. They always did. The Dursleys, Snape, Dumbledore. Especially Dumbledore. I guess I was just waiting for the next great lie to come along. And then suddenly I’m the only one who can save the day again, and it was — it was just too close to home, you know?”
"He's not backing down, guys!" squeaked Hermione in utter despair. "He's away to get massage oil so I can be all bendy for when we have sex!"
Suddenly, Harry pointed his wand at the wireless and the kitchen was filled with soft crooning before turning back to his husband with a large grin. “Just in case they decide to take a practical approach to learning safe sex.”
"My friend really likes you, love. He asked me to give you his number." She slipped the young woman his mobile number on a piece of paper and smiled. "He's filthy rich and works as a chemist. You should definitely ring him."
love, like family. You know?” Her lip began to tremble as the thought that Harry might not be on the same page, sniffing. “You do know, don’t you?”
Harry looked at where Malfoy’s hands were tugging at his arms, trying to force him to help find his missing pet. Yes, Malfoy had been an arse about the whole thing, but he could see it was coming from a place of love, misguided as it was.
Theo scowled, nudging the flowers with his foot. “A clue? Some poxy flowers? They’re not even that nice, a step up from weeds really.”
Harry had never been more thankful for the waterproof quality of the invisibility cloak as he knelt in the tall grass, although he found himself wishing it also came with a heating charm. He’d been standing, but the shock of what he found Malfoy doing was enough to drop him to his knees. Harry couldn’t help but thank Godric for the howling wind, otherwise Malfoy would have heard his shocked gasp for sure. If it weren’t for that, Malfoy would have known he was there. He tugged the cloak tighter around his icy limbs and squinted through the rain at the strange sight before him.
"You're telling me," began Draco, smiling wider and wider with each word, "that you've gone and booked us an awesome holiday behind my back and completely out of the blue because I was stressed out?"
The voice in Harry’s head, the one that knew he should push Draco off, was suddenly silenced, muzzled by the louder chorus thrumming through his blood. He arched up into Draco’s kisses, his hips thrusting as Draco ground down. Draco’s scent is all around him, his taste invading his mouth, and suddenly Harry’s so hard he feels he might die.
“Of course, I left! You basically told me you’d been working on some secret cure so you could get to live your life free from me. And I get it, I do. You’ve always felt like you had no choice. I get why the cure was important to you. But it hurt, Draco. Merlin, did it hurt! I was angry, but I miss you more than anything.”
Where Draco and Harry begin to fall for each other and Draco is that much closer to finding his cure.
He took another deep pull of the bottle and passed it to Hermione, who eyed it suspiciously before handing it off to an eager Ron. As the alcohol settled in his stomach, Harry could finally feel his body begin to relax. He settled himself comfortably against the stone wall as Seamus began telling everyone about some night out he’d had recently, when a shock of white-blond hair caught his attention.
He must be, it’s the only explanation for how often he finds himself thinking of Potter. Of how confident he carries himself when in class, only to try and blend into the background when in a crowd. How his glasses magnify his green eyes, making them seem all the brighter. How he quietly cares for those he loves without need of acknowledgement — ordering extra ink and quills for Granger and making sure the plates with Weasley’s favourites are nearest to him during meal times. He notices that Potter has grown a little taller in the last month, his shoulders filling out his robes when before they were small and thin. Sometimes when he’s working in the library, he thinks of taking Potter’s hand and looking him in the eye as they stand together and tell the world to fuck off.
In the end, curiosity won out and he found himself pulling a nondescript folded piece of parchment out from its envelope. He unfolded the parchment and froze, the parchment dropping onto his plate, his stomach swooping with dread as his eyes read the messy scrawl over and over again.
His voice was so low that Harry, who was standing the furthest away from Malfoy, almost missed them.
Luckily, the whole welcome situation wasn’t drawn out. A brief shaking of hands, a random hug from one Susan Bones, and he was allowed to progress from the entry hall into the Great Hall, trying not to set fire to the name tag one of the ‘Puffs had pressed onto his chest. As if people would take one look at his blond hair and pale skin and not know exactly who he was.
My bladder is killing me and I’ve just had to cast a freshening charm on my breath because I can’t brush my teeth, but I am not going to move from this bed until you open your eyes. Then I’m going to smile at you and tell you “good morning, my love.”
I don’t deserve you after what I’ve done. You have a bloody huge heart and somehow you have forgiven me for my past mistakes, even when I couldn’t forgive myself. But you can’t possibly forgive me this time. Besides, I don’t deserve it.
"Ok, but only a few inches," she agreed, folding her waistband in on itself until her calf-length pencil skirt was finally sitting above her knee and the slit hit her mid-thigh. "Right. I'm going back in. But I swear, if he tries to get me into bed, I'll murder him
Fifteen rain-soaked minutes later, Draco found himself pounding on the large wooden door of Hagrid’s hut. A surge of barking from within was the only warning Draco received before the front door was yanked open and a harried-looking Hagrid stared him down.
The instant the words were out of his mouth he regretted it. He heard a gasp from behind him, and suddenly had trouble staying upright. Draco. His chest was throbbing with loss for something he hadn’t even known he’d wanted, but before he could think of how to fix things—maybe ask Hermione to find him a Time Turner—Draco had already begun to move from his spot on the floor.
Unease morphed into suspicion as he took in just how nervous, almost ill, his old rival looked. Abruptly, as if aware he was being observed, Malfoy slunk out of his corner, his eyes downcast.
It won’t be easy, and we’ll likely argue about 80% of the time, so you need to decide if you can handle it or not.
However, before Harry could rally his inner Ravenclaw and knuckle down, a flash of platinum hair in his peripheral vision caught his attention. Malfoy. Skulking as per usual. He found his eyes narrowing in suspicion as Malfoy made his way into the Care of Magical Creatures section, only to emerge a few seconds later and begin to argue with Madam Pince. Harry could feel the annoyance surge in his blood at the sight. How dare he go around harassing old women! True, the ancient librarian could more than handle herself, but that wasn’t the point. As if Malfoy hadn’t caused enough trouble already! After a moment or two, Malfoy had clearly had enough and turned his back on Madam Pince and stalked towards the entrance.
With that, Harry led Draco upstairs and set about giving him a reason to let Harry love him for the rest of their lives.
Blaise chuckled out his agreement, but Neville shook his head. "No, he doesn't, but Pansy does, and I'm so bloody tired of secrets, so this is great."
But you should definitely do something about your secret love. The rest of the world can form an orderly queue and fuck off. It’s your life and you’ve sacrificed enough of it for the greater good. It’s time to do whatever the hell you please, even if it means shocking everyone. And I wouldn’t worry too much about “slumming it down”. Your house was cleaner than I expected. Yes, you could have at least put away the pile of clean clothes, instead of dumping them on the bed, but I doubt you were expecting us to end up sleeping together. Maybe when you invite that bloke over, ask Kreacher to help you tidy up first.
Neville heaved a long-suffering sigh. "What are you looking for, Harry? Please just tell me so I can have five minutes of peace?"
“Nothing.” At Hermione’s raised eyebrow, Harry suddenly felt under attack. “I’m serious, ‘Mione! I haven’t done anything to the guy. He asked me to stay out of his way, and I have. It’s been two weeks since Treacle last saw Atlantis, so it can’t be about that.”
“Are you saying you think I’m too stupid to know what’s wrong with my pet? He’s got all fat, and he sleeps and eats more than usual. This is just not on.”
The spreading of the core sickness was advancing at a much faster pace than Draco’s progress in finding a cure. It had been two months, and so far each combination he had tried had resulted in failure. Severus was beginning to worry, which Draco could tell from the ever-increasing silences from the portrait.
"Oh come on now, it's not that bad. Take a breath and relax," Draco soothed, obviously trying, but failing, to calm Harry's completely legitimate freak-out.
He knew he was being a bit manic, something a Malfoy emphatically did not do, but he couldn’t help it. He’d finally figured it out. He watched Severus avidly as the Potion’s Master processed the news. Then a thin smile quirked at Severus’ lips, causing Draco to feel giddy with elation.
"Stop! Stop! Oh god, he's my best friend, and I kiss that man sometimes. Don't go any further!" She turned on Neville. "How long have you known?"
He hadn’t minded at first, but they’d been in the damned place for a couple of hours now, and the novelty had completely worn off for him. The music thumped a relentless beat as coloured lights lit up the dance floor in random segments. The heat inside the club was so thick he could almost taste it. Sweat and cologne and booze mingled in the air to form a heady smell. Everywhere he looked, there were bodies dancing, drinking, touching. Everyone around him looked to be having a fantastic night, which just made the pain forming behind his eyes all the more prominent. Seriously, was there anything worse than people enjoying themselves while you felt crap? He took a swig of his drink and pondered what would happen if he caused the power to circuit in the club, accidentally, of course. Even great wizards lost control now and then. He could feel himself cheering up at the thought and indulged himself a little more with his fantasy.  However, before he could get too far into it, Ron appeared at his side, his arms wrapped around an incredibly wobbly Hermione who was practically draped over his chest.
“What, like it wants them to shag or something?” asked Seamus, his voice hitching with inebriation. “Fat chance of—”
He wrinkled his eyebrows as though trying to figure her out, but then he just smiled and shrugged. "No problem. I'll see you back at the flat for dinner."
“Come on, you’ll feel better once you’ve had some sleep,” promised Harry, once again holding out the pyjamas and toothbrush. Draco simply shook his head and let himself fall onto the bed, not bothering to change out of his clothes or even remove his shoes. Unwilling to argue the fact any further, Harry put the bundle of items onto the dresser and stepped towards the bed. Carefully, he eased off Draco’s shoes and pulled a thick woollen blanket over him.
As he nears the enclosure, he can hear chirping and realises the silencing and shield charms have been disarmed. Quickening his steps to a slow jog, he rounds the bushes and freezes at the sight of the ducklings clucking and fussing around one Harry Potter. Fury bubbles inside his stomach at the audacity of Harry — of Potter — daring to trespass. He slides his wand out of his sleeve and stalks into the enclosure, glaring down at Potter as he does.
“No dear, but this water doesn’t look fresh. How are you going to manage to stay hydrated if the water is less than adequate?”
He notices that every night, Draco sings to ducklings as they snuggle down into an overly fluffy fur hat they seem to be using as a nest. He makes sure they’re all comfortable and warm and strokes their yellowish feathers gently as he tentatively begins to sing to them. Merlin! Harry thinks he might actually die from the beauty of that voice. After a while, Harry makes sure to never miss the duck’s bedtime routine just so he can hear Draco’s low singing smooth over his skin warmly like liquid silver and wrap around him like a comfort blanket. Every time it rains Harry finds himself thinking of the song and has to bite his lip to stop himself from humming the tune. One night, after a particularly vicious nightmare of Bellatrix slicing Hermione’s arm, Harry remembers the hauntingly beautiful words Draco usually sings to the ducklings and wishes he could ask Draco to sing to him and stroke his hair in the same way.
Neville got to his feet, wobbling slightly. "If you're that annoyed then just turned the darn thing off. It's hardly rocket science." He turned to the table at large. "Right, I'm off to the toilet. Someone order me a bottle of water? I'm getting too old for all this boozing."
The man in question was still lying in the middle of the bed, the blanket wrapped securely around his body. Harry tilted his head and wondered how the Malfoy heir would feel if he knew he currently resembled a poorly constructed sausage roll.
“Pass it over,” Seamus said, holding his hand out for Luna to pass him the rope. He took a moment to examine it before continuing. “Well, it’s clear that this rope means one of two things. Either the room wants us to engage in some light bondage, or it really does want Harry and Mal— erm, I mean Draco, to get together. That, my good people, is a Celtic love knot.”
“Hey, Treacle,” he said, dipping his hand into the water to tickle his fingers along the seahorse’s bumpy belly. “You fancy going down to visit Hagrid?”
“Forgive me if I’m not jumping up and down with enthusiasm!” Draco felt Harry’s words as if he had been slapped, the sarcastic words mocking his pride. If that was how Harry wanted to be about it, then fine.
Draco stood at the window in his room — their room, and looked out at the snow covering the grounds. It looked like it was going to be a white Christmas after all. The ceremony had been small; “Family only,” McGonagall had advised. His mother had looked beautiful in her ice blue robes, the white fur trimming the edges making her look like a fairy-tale snow queen. Molly Weasley had been there for Potter, her red hair frizzing haphazardly from under her midnight-blue hat. She had sniffed the entire way through the ceremony as if it were a wake and not a bonding. He and Potter had locked eyes and joined hands in resignation as the magic of the bonding fizzled through them both, stripping away their freedom to choose.  As the final ribbons of light wrapped around them and dimmed, so did Draco’s dreams of getting married and having an heir. When thought about that way, Draco supposed it may well have been a wake.
“New rule!” Granger called, sitting up on her knees. “We don’t know how long we’re going to be in here, so it wouldn’t hurt to create a more friendly atmosphere. Everyone is to use each other’s first names. No more of this last name nonsense, or whatever else you’ve all been using.”
Blaise put his arm around Pansy, and turned a steely glare on Draco, his voice filled with forced calm. “Steady on, you’ll end up saying something you might regret.”
“Huh? Look it’s two in the bloody morning, and we have Potions first thing. Can you just tell me what the hell you want?”
Suddenly, Harry felt the proverbial Knut drop, and he tried valiantly not to smile, sure that Malfoy wouldn’t appreciate it.
“All right, Mother,” soothed Draco as he grasped her hand tightly, unnerved by the grey pallor of his mother’s face and the shadows that had now taken residence under her watery eyes. “Let’s explore the options.”
“What is it?” Harry pulled the stopper and gave it a quick sniff, pulling away with an unimpressed grimace at the unfortunate odour. Draco just smiled encouragingly, forcing down the sickening thought that once Harry drank the antidote, he would leave again.
“If your core twin was found and agreed to enter in a highly specialised bond, their core would bond with yours, essentially stabilising it and thereby reversing the sickness.”
He looked around the hall, his eyes darting up and over the walls and faces and lights—Merlin, the lights. His mouth was the driest it had ever been and his head was thumping, and he knew, just
Draco watched for Hermione's reaction as Harry practically ran to the men's room. She looked triumphant, and she was grinning at Blaise. Draco pushed himself out of his chair and turned to his friends, none of them appearing overly surprised at Harry's escape. They were up to something.
“Alright, I’m heading out, classes start in a bit. See you guys later.” Harry straightened out his shoulders and waved as he left the table.
Harry gulped. He didn't have the Prince's book anymore, and so now it was up to Malfoy to impress Slughorn. Hermione was right. I should've never got involved with that damn book. Harry looked over to Malfoy, who still had his head down.
"Well, I'm glad to know that you're enjoying yourself so much," Pete laughed, and Lauren gave him a raw, burning stare.
“The guy Bailey was talking about,” Draco reminded. “There’s something we need to discuss. Now,” he said urgently, taking back Harry’s arm and pulling on it, as if to take him somewhere.
"Good," he said, not even looking up to insult or poke fun at Harry. Breathing out, Malfoy rummaged through the ingredients Harry had set down. Without a word, he began setting to work, plopping various items in.
A long, rugged stick rested carefully above John's nose, before a brilliant shower of light seemed to envelop him, turning the whole forest into a surreal shade of green.
"You're not that special, you know," she remarked dryly, poking the fire again. This time, her stick caught on fire, but she calmly blew it out, quickly then resuming to prodding at the big, nearly charred log in the middle of the flames. "Sometimes, you act like a real prick, Pete."
"I'm starving," Ron grunted, feet clacking sharply on the ground. "I could eat a whole dragon right about now."
This time, there was no initial reaction, and Malfoy seemed to regard Harry with little importance. "Only you would think about it that way, Potter." There seemed to be less malice in his name than usual, and Harry, once again dumbfounded, could barely recognize Malfoy's statement as an insult. It was more of a fact, really, or a very plausible conclusion.
Harry gaped at him. “Wha-what? You’re always looking for a good excuse to embarrass me. The ‘lake thing’ would have done it. And you’re always trying to get attention for yourself…” Harry trailed off as he saw the look on Malfoy’s face. “Oh,” Harry said faintly, “it would have been… embarrassing attention.” Of course he wouldn’t want anyone to know! He got beat up — without magic.
Classes had been awfully mundane the whole day. The sky was a perfect, October gloom, setting the scene for a wonderfully lit Great Hall when dinner came around. The pumpkins were glowing with fierce, open snarls, and the tables were lined with rows and rows of pumpkin juice, treacle tart, and cider. The candles were warm, aromatic, and the whole room smelled like cloves. Reminded of Mrs. Weasley’s cooking, Harry took in the smell of the Great Hall with a big, deep breath and sat down at the Gryffindor table with Ron and Hermione. Quickly, they scarfed down their dinner, Ron filling his stomach to the brim with several slices of cake, a full gallon of hot chocolate, and an enormous piling of potatoes. Ron, with a strange excitement, finished early (despite the horrendously impressive amount of food he’d eaten) and went scampering back to the Gryffindor common room to get dressed. Hermione followed in suit, looking apologetically at Harry. He found himself all alone, with only a quiet Neville and a silent Dean, who looked lost without Seamus beside him. Deciding that the both of them weren’t looking very up to conversation, Harry finished his dinner, chugged a bottle of pumpkin juice, and left for Gryffindor tower. On his way out, he turned to look at the Great Hall, and saw something that startled him: Draco was seated sullenly at the Slytherin table, dressed smartly and playing somberly with his food. He had a mask set beside him, making Harry blink several times, just to make sure the image was real. Is Draco going to Slughorn’s party? It would certainly be very strange if Malfoy was to go. He was horribly unpopular, and even if his grades were good enough, he’d probably just end up standing in the crowd, alone and stranded for two hours. Flashing his eyes in modest confusion, Harry jogged up the steps, making his way to the Gryffindor common room.
Harry's stomach sank as he tied two and two together. He had a feeling that he knew who was under the tree. The boy said nothing, as if his bullies were invisible.
Ignoring the bare trace of malice in Malfoy’s voice, Harry stormed out, head burning. So now he’s back to being meek again… maybe he wants me to think he’s weak. In need of protection, even though that’s not very Malfoy at all… I don’t understand. He knows that I know about his plan, so why is he still going on with the act?
Bailey flinched at the name, but continued. “I worked. I did my part. All the ferret had to do was kill Dumbledore.”
Gulping, Harry snuck in, trying to make the least noise possible. He had nearly made it to his dorm room when a figure jumped out on an unsuspecting Harry.
"Em… I, uh…" Harry desperately reached for a lie, "I'm actually not going. Yeah. I'm… not going." Harry gulped, starting to walk again. Instead of taking a hint, Romilda bounced along, still smiling.
After dinner, Harry and Hermione headed to the library, leaving Ron in the Great Hall to finish his third treacle tart. They had just sat down to study when a bout of raucous laughter rang through the shelves of books. Harry stiffened, waiting to hear Madam Pince’s voice.
After a while, they made it to Hogsmeade, and quickly walked to the Three Broomsticks. Inside, it was warm, blocking out the cool, early October air. Hermione met her friend, retrieved her book, and they all sat down with a mug of hot, delicious butterbeer.
“See, I had already guessed this weeks ago, when I came across a certain letter.” Bailey extracted a crumpled, yellowing piece of paper, which he handed to Harry. Malfoy immediately made a grab for it, but Bailey pushed him aside.
Harry could tell Draco wasn’t telling him something, but before he could press further, they entered the classroom.
At this, Hermione blushed, and Ron turned a very deep shade of maroon. "That's not true!" Ron coughed, but Harry only smiled.
"Oh no," Ron groaned, "why couldn't I have failed that one class? Slughorn's gonna pair me with Goyle… or worse, Pansy…"
just be free-time. We will be doing many celebratory activities, but many of them will be educational."
“Oh, well I’m so very sorry to hear that, Malfoy,” Harry advanced on him, trying to draw up his height, “I’m so sorry that you couldn’t remain your old, bastardly self.”
"Maybe," he mumbled, pulling the cover over his heads. Taking Dumbledore's Deluminator, Ron stole the light, clicked back the device, and the room was swallowed by darkness.
His voice was just above a whisper, and he felt the light bouncing off the trees beside him. He looked around, frantically trying to find Pete's Ford. Pulse throbbing at an impossible speed, John made a turn, leaping over several fallen logs. Green light swelled around him, as if a great toad had swallowed him whole. The forest was teeming with snaky, whip-like vines, and John's hands extended themselves above him, balancing and swiping plants out of his way. In a terrifying moment, his foot caught on a tree root, and he was sent flying into the ground. Miraculously, a near-perfect beam of light missed its aim, and soared right above him. Shaken, but numb, John ignored the burning sensation creeping up his knee as he began running again, shoving and pushing through the growth. A dark-looking bird perched above him, sending out a loud, eerie call. He wasn't sure if this was a warning, or perhaps if the bird was a colleague with the green light, but he didn't have long to dwell on it when another ray came frighteningly close. The bird seemed to follow him, hopping from branch-to-branch, and John attempted to outrun it, diving over bushes. He came to a quick stop, unsure of where to go, but instantly saw a small sliver of moonlight to his left. He turned in that direction, hoping the madman behind him didn't see his change in course. Hitting vines and ferns out of the way, he could see the arch that Pete had cut, and the gravel road ahead. Green light came dangerously close to him, just whipping past his cheek, and John burst through the arch, screaming as he struggled with the lock on Pete's car.
"Potter! What the hell did you do to me!" Malfoy kept jumping, soon realizing his robe was lost. Unclipping it, Malfoy stood in simple black clothes, which had thankfully not caught on fire yet.
"I wonder what daddy would think," the smaller boy sneered, "now that your whole family is virtually worthless. If he ever gets out of Azkaban — which he won't — he'll disown you once he's seen what you've become. Might as well go marry a Gryffindor, since you're down this 'road of goodwill'."
"Okay, Romilda!" Harry yelled, watching as the bludger nearly whacked into her head, "Hit it with the bat when it comes back again!" Eyes wide, Harry winced as she lamely hit the bludger, only sending it a couple of feet in front of her. "A little harder, maybe!"
But before Hooch could get any further, the Slytherins had kicked off, shooting into the sky. Enraged, Harry flew off, his team following in suit. Draco, however, had waited for Hooch to blow her whistle before rising into the sky. He seemed lazy, dazed a little. Harry couldn’t help but smile at Draco’s lack of observation, hovering over the match as he looked for any signs of the snitch. Suddenly, he saw what he thought was a gold glint, far off by one of the posts. He whipped around, but nearly fell off his broom as he rammed straight into Draco.
They sat in silence for the rest of the period, and Harry felt his stomach twisting; a whole week of detention. With Malfoy. Praying it wouldn't be the death of him, Harry sagged in his seat, putting his head into his arms.
Feeling like he’d just been backed into a corner, Harry was ashamed. I’m supposed to be the one making a fool of Malfoy! What is wrong with him?
"Ron, drop the smile, will you?" Harry said, glumly spreading some butter on his toast. "I've been embarrassed enough this morning."
Draco nodded, not surprised by Harry’s sudden defense. Harry reflected on what Draco had said, just a week ago, on that last night of detention — I’m not like that anymore. I don’t need to lose, too.
Outside, the hills spotted around the house were a mild yellow-gold, dry as the fall weather set in. The sky was a light shade of grey, and Ron grunted something about rain.
“I guess so,” he repeated, and Harry was struck by the look of sad somberness, of seriousness, on his face. “See you, Pansy.”
“Ron, that’s exactly it,” Harry said quickly, “when we were in detention together, he said some stuff. Some really honest stuff. He said-”
"Wonderful," Slughorn smiled. "I won't keep you, but if you boys need anything, I'll be in my office." Slughorn motioned to a door on his right, and Harry nodded again. With a clap of his hands, Slughorn left, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
Harry nearly burst into a fit of laughter as Ron pulled the remainder of the object out, impressed by his cleverness.
Breakfast with the Weasleys was always a pleasant thing; Mrs. Weasley scrambling around, doling out toast, Ron saying something very daring and stupid at Hermione, Mr. Weasley propped up with The Daily Prophet. Harry, always a fan of Mrs. Weasley's cooking, was currently shoving down several sausages at once, despite Hermione's protests. He and Ron had been too busy playing Quidditch last night to get a proper dinner, and Harry was famished. Thankfully, he didn't choke, and instead moved on to his coffee, which went down hot and bitter in the back of his throat.
"I think it's doing wonders for team-building," Pete, the man beside her, smirked. "This is the most you've ever spoken to me, Lauren, and I'll say that that's an accomplishment."
Escaping the boxcar, Harry began wandering the aisle aimlessly, shuffling past people as he searched for Ron and Hermione. Eventually, he reached the end of the hall, groaning as he went to turn and go the other way. However, before he could go, he spun around to see Malfoy staring right at him, trying to get by.
“No. You have, though, haven’t you, because the old Malfoy would never do something like that… save Harry Potter… or was it just the life bond, Malfoy?”
Draco looked amused, but he still showed no signs of a definite smile. “I think you know I’m not dangerous anymore.”
“Embarrassing, for sure,” Bailey tsked, “but not as embarrassing as being saved by Harry Potter. Is that what it’s come to, Malfoy? Being saved by bloody Gryffindors?”
By dinner, nearly everyone was wondering why Harry was smiling. The only inkling to what  was really happening was the small, discreet smile he shared with Draco, who was watching in amusement from the Slytherin table.
“Oh, that’s a load of bullshit,” Ron seethed, “he can say anything he wants. He’s a manipulative rat. Tell him, Hermione!”
"Holy… Pete! Pete, get up!" Lauren dove to his side, shaking him. Head spinning, she tried reaching for the axe, but her fingers singed easily in the fire. "I said, Pete, get up! If-if this is your idea of some-some funny little joke, I'm telling you, it's not funny!" Green light shot above her head, and she screamed. "Get up! Pete! Get up!" Lauren slapped Pete, to Patricia's horror, but was stopped when another tremendous blast of light knocked her over, violently banging her head on a log. Her eyes seemed to go blank, as if they were shrouded in fog.
“Let’s just say Gryffindor’s aren’t known for thinking things through. You’re more the ‘act now and worry later’ kind of people, aren’t you?”
“Is that so?” Draco winces at the icy tone of his own voice. To think he was feeling quite positive only a few moments before.
Harry watched Pansy walk away in search of Draco, followed by Theo and Blaise, both looking very grim.
“It’s nothing. I’m fine.” He could hear his voice laced with strain and tried to smile at Harry, wincing when it caused Harry to look back at him pained. “Honestly, I’m just tired. I’m going to grab a quick shower, okay?”
"I have to admit," he finally said, taking a sip of his tea and relaxing, "it's nice to finally be able to talk to someone about this. You wouldn't believe what they've been up to."
— a highly prestigious Potion’s journal for him. Something alien began to flutter inside his chest at the collection of items and Draco knew with absolute certainty it wasn’t his core.
As the two love birds shared a rather indecent kiss, Hermione quickly grabbed her blouse from Pansy and thrust her arms through the sleeves, her fingers flying over the buttons frantically.
"Yeah, yeah!" droned Draco, finally leaving the bathroom and strolling towards the suite door, grabbing his keys and wallet along the way. "Well, are you coming or not? I'm not waiting on you any longer!"
Harry looked at Hermione, who kept opening her mouth as if trying to speak. Her face was pale with red splotches and Harry found himself checking her over in concern.
Draco squeezed his eyes as tight as they could go for a moment and then pushed himself away from the wall he was suddenly leaning against. He forced himself to walk, carefully lifting his feet and placing them one in front of the other. As he passed the bar, he reached out his left arm and grabbed an unopened bottle of Firewhisky, barely registering the hostile glare from the bartender. All he knew was that he needed to be alone, needed to breathe, and needed a drink. In that order.
“At first it was, but now...I don’t know. You need help. You seem so angry at everything, and you’re taking it out on yourself. You don’t deserve that.”
Harry watched as Malfoy nudged his way through the group and tugged at the door handle, clearly struggling to get the door to open.
He needn’t have worried, as he found himself being kissed firmly, almost aggressively, in return. Their mouths moved together, their tongues working relentlessly against one another. Hands explored, teeth nipped, and tongues licked as they breathed and moaned into each other, their rapidly filling cocks rubbing together in the most sinful way.
"There is?" asked Harry with a tinge of hope filtering into his voice. He seemed to be finally calming down enough to see reason.
Seamus threw the rope at Draco, who caught it automatically. The rope was heavy and thick, and it was indeed woven into an impossible knot. It was quite attractive actually, and Draco could see why someone would use it to symbolise their love for one another.
I think of you all the time, every minute, if I’m honest. When I’m making tea, I think of you. When I’m getting dressed, I hear your voice in my head telling me to pick something less scruffy. It makes me so bloody happy for about 30 seconds, and then I remember what you did and I’m suddenly furious. Do you know how many mugs I’ve shattered with my magic going all daft with anger? Like seriously, I’m going to need to go mug shopping at this rate!
Malfoy’s steely voice began, but before he could get any further, Parkinson, Nott, and Zabini huffed over to them, looking breathless and extremely worried.
Draco woke up to find himself lying on a hospital bed in a sterile-looking room. The beeping of the monitoring charm was steady and rhythmic, almost lulling him back into unconsciousness. The grit in his eyes scraped against his lids each time he blinked as he tried to acclimate himself to the bright light above his bed. He had initially thought it was the famed light at the end of the proverbial tunnel, but he quickly disabused himself of that notion. Death Eaters, especially subpar ones such as himself, didn’t get a happy ending, even in death. Maybe especially in death.
The shared moment seemed to dissolve, causing both of them to lower their eyes, each unwilling to be the one to take the initiative.
“I figured it out. It was in here all the time, the missing ingredient!” Draco held up the slightly scrunched magazine for Severus to see. “It’s got this article on Healing, where it might be beneficial to infuse a patient’s magic with the potion ingredients, making it more compatible to the patient. Well, what if I put Harry’s magical essence into the potion? That’s what my core needs to help restore itself, right?”
delicate, and I require your assurance that this will go no further if you choose not to be involved.”
For some reason, as they both fuss and care for the little birds, Draco thinks that once they get back to his room, there won’t be much talking after all.
His godfather was silent for several moments before responding. His brow was furrowed, something that had tended to happen in life when he’d been greatly worried.
Harry leaned against the corridor wall and watched Malfoy until he’d disappeared around the corner. Something was up, that much was clear, and the first thing Harry was going to do was have a look in the Magical Creatures section for clues.
“You, okay? I noticed you! You’re smart and resourceful. You look after abandoned ducklings, for Merlin’s sake! And you’re fucking gorgeous! How did I never notice it before?”
Draco realised his hands were shaking and folded his arms across his chest, grateful he was wearing robes with sleeves that fell past his wrists. He just needed to hold it together until Granger got the bloody door opened.
“It’s the lunar quality of the Moonstone, Draco. Part of its nature is to change with the passage of time, growing and shrinking. You will need to find an alternative.”
“Semen? Uncle Sev, please!” He had thought the urine discussion had been bad, but that was before his godfather began talking about Harry’s— How would that conversation even go? The thought of strolling up to Harry, handing him a beaker and asking for a deposit was ludicrous. “Look, can we just agree to rule out anything you wouldn’t personally be comfortable collecting yourself? Thanks ever so.”
Seamus stopped suddenly at the appearance of a thick piece of rope directly next to his legs, woven into an impossibly complicated knot.
At that moment, with the Great Hall full of chatter, bright colours, and the stupid new tables, Harry felt suffocated. He pushed his plate away and stood up from the table, his eyes downcast to avoid the worried looks he knew his friends would be throwing his way.
“As I mentioned, there are a couple of known negative effects which you must understand before agreeing to anything. The first and most common side effect, affecting up to a third of the test subjects, is a lingering pressure on the chest area. So far, this discomfort has been mostly harmless, affecting only those who expose themselves to strenuous exercise, such as athletes. The other side effect, which affected only two percent of the test subjects, is regrettably more serious. In those cases, there seems to be an incompatibility between the core and the spell, an allergic reaction if you will. The reaction was sudden and aggressive, resulting in those test subjects losing the functionality of their magic. Essentially, they became squibs. It’s important you understand that this reaction can be instantaneous — in fact, it often is — however, there are cases where it has taken a while to manifest. Therefore, after the spell is performed, should your bond-mate agree to assist, we would want to keep a close eye on your magical core.”
He found himself halting in the kitchen doorway, leaning comfortably against the door jamb, as he watched Draco aggressively shove the broken shards into the bin.
Draco turned to Harry and something softened in his look. He stepped closer and put his arms around Harry's waist. "Six amazing months."
He offered Draco a weak smile and exited the room, leaving Draco feeling more alone than he had in a long time.
“Had your eye on one of your fellow Death Eaters, did you?” Her words made something inside him snap, and before he knew it, he was stepping into her space, his eyes boring into hers as he towered over her.
“We should contact him. You never know, darling. He’s defied the odds before, maybe he’ll surprise us.” His mother’s voice was careful, measured, as if she knew just how close to the edge he actually was.
Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes tiredly. He didn’t know what he could do to make Draco more comfortable. Behind him, a floorboard creaked, and Harry knew Draco had sought him out.
Suddenly he had no idea when he’d last taken a breath. His face flushed with heat as adrenaline pumped through his body, trying to force his lungs to expand. His blood was on fire, there was no other way to describe it. His heart was pounding a mile a minute, and he couldn’t breathe. He just couldn’t breathe.
“I assure you that it is indeed possible.” Narcissa’s voice was calm and steady, which helped Harry wrap his aching brain around the concept. “Rare, but possible.”
P.S If you’re up for dinner at mine, feel free to suggest food. I’m sick of Italian (thanks to Ron), so I’m happy for new ideas.
“If you won’t help yourself, then I’ll go talk to Potter, tell him what a state you’re in. Maybe he’ll come back to you.”
Harry shrugged. "True enough." He leaned forwards and gave the nipple a long lick then sucked it into his mouth.
Theo moved towards the door and tried to pull the handle along with Malfoy, applying brute strength to the situation. After a moment, Theo let go and leaned against the door in resignation.
I’m free any day next week, but I’ll go for Friday afternoon. Would Your Highness manage to find some time for a mere commoner like me at 6pm? I would love to go out for dinner, but I’m kind of broke at the moment, so a cup of tea might be a more sensible option for the time being. There’s a lovely café just next to my potion lab called
"Please," she scoffed, "you know fine and well that I never ask anyone out. If they want me, they'll have to do the chasing."
First of all, your owl is a delight and he clearly likes me more than you. I had run out of treats and yet he was still lovely (he even let me stroke him). That goes to prove that owls are incredibly smart birds who can determine which of us is more worthy of their attention.
“I’m missing an ingredient and I’m struggling to figure out what.” Draco leaned further into Harry’s ministrations, biting his lip in pleasure. “It’ll come to me.”
For a moment, no one moved. Then, as if prompted by an unspoken command, they all launched themselves towards the door, scrambling to grab their abandoned clothes and wands as they went.
“Not if I stabilise it, it won’t be. Powdered willow bark could manage that. It’s flexible but durable, positive but not overwhelmingly so.” Quickly, he snatched up his quill and added his thoughts to the list. “I need something to counteract the side effects of distance from Harry’s magical core…maybe Ashwinder eggs? They would sort the ague symptoms…”
“Like hell you will, Potter,” Malfoy demanded, his own hands wrapped around Atlantis who had obviously made an attempt to get to his mate. “Just make sure to keep that...that scarlet creature away from my Atlantis in future.”
As he sat at the breakfast table, he couldn’t stop his stomach rolling around inside him, practically squirming at the thought of food being placed in it. Salazar, he needed to eat. He hadn’t managed anything at dinner last night, and if he was going to make any progress with Severus later on, he would need as much energy as he could get. He’d already taken Pepper-Up that morning and wouldn't be able to take another dose until bedtime.
Once midnight had finally chimed, they shared a relieved toast to a better year, both aware of the ridiculousness of that statement, and got into bed, ready for the obligatory sex. Draco had lain on his side this time, his leg hiked up as Harry diligently did his duty from behind him. Once they were spent, lying in the dark, almost asleep, Harry initiated their whispered conversation.
Friday at 6 is a done deal. I’m happy to go for tea or dinner, but if you’re up for it, you could come to mine? I’m still at Grimmauld, and the wards are still set to let you in. We could have something to eat and watch a movie? I would cook, of course. There’s no way I’m letting you near the kitchen after the chickpea disaster when you decided to make your own hummus. Seriously, I still have nightmares about it!
“You’ll need to make them a nest and you’ll need to feed them too. Just line this here box with something soft and they'll be okay for now. They’ll have been okay ‘til now ‘cause they live off the yolk at firs’, but now they’ll be hungry.” Hagrid paused in his instruction to pull a well-thumbed book out of the box and passed it to Draco with a smile. “This here will tell you what you need to know, feedin’ them and the like. Wet dog food with greens is bes’, I think. You’ll need to make sure they have fresh drinkin’ water. A tub for them to take a swim in now an’ then would be good too. There’s some of Fang’s dog food in the box an’ some spinach from my garden to get yeh started.”
“Bollocks. You don’t care about me at all!” He glared tiredly at his friends, suddenly furious that they were bothering him. “You just want my help in Potions, or to copy my notes in Transfiguration. You don’t give a shit about anything but yourselves.”
Harry nodded his understanding, and the elf vanished with a loud crack. He took a moment to gather his courage, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.
Malfoy, who Harry had identified as the owner of the voice, was now punctuating each word he yelled with a thump on the door. Worried he would soon have to deal with the entire floor and not just an irate Malfoy, Harry got to his feet and wrenched the door open.
“I’m saying that I know you put it there and you can bloody well get rid of it! You think you’re bloody hysterical, don’t you? All you arseholes throwing your weight around! And fine, I get it. I deserve it! The names, the hexes, whatever. But I draw the line at this shit!”
“Down there at that bloody party, everyone’s having a great old time, except for the Slytherins. We’re lepers at our own reunion. Oh sure, we all got invitations, but we weren’t really expected to come, were we? Did you ever think why only the four of us showed up? It’s because the rest of them were too bloody scared. We can’t even go into Diagon Alley without suffering some kind of abuse. Millicent? She lives in Muggle London, for Christ sake, because she was so sick of being spat on whenever she needed to step outside her front door. Do you have any idea what that’s like?
I can't say that I miss your messiness and your dirty clothes piled on the floor, but I got used to having you around and now the house seems so quiet and empty. The nights are too long, especially when I have to face them
Harry stared at the ravens, rubbing his thumb over the little birds, and Draco was worried the man was offended. He waited on tenterhooks, desperate for the tension to break but unwilling to be the one to do it.
It was a good twenty minutes later when Draco finally emerged from the bathroom holding his folded clothes with his wand balanced on top. He’d spent two minutes of that time getting changed and cleaning his teeth, and the rest of the time focused on giving himself a mental pep talk. It was just as well, really, because every ounce of cool he’d ever thought he possessed seemed to elude him the second his eyes fell on Harry nervously twisting the hem of his top as he perched on the edge of the bed. Definitely time well spent, in his opinion.
It needed to come to a head, and as Draco made his way back to his room with long purposeful strides, he was formulating a plan. He would stay awake the whole night and catch whoever was tormenting him in the act. Once he confronted them, he would leave whatever was left of them to the mercy of the Headmistress, who although she was a Gryffindor, was also (and much to Draco’s chagrin) incredibly fair.
Apparently, Granger’s threat was worse than it sounded, because Potter actually paled and faced Draco, his mouth still holding stubbornly onto his annoyance.
“You’ve heard me sing?” Draco watches Harry cautiously nod his head, his throat suddenly dry. “It was something my mother used to sing to me. Pennies From Heaven. It’s a Muggle song, if you can believe that. My father made her stop.”
The flat was silent, except for the sound of logs burning in the fireplace. Harry was lying on the sofa, legs crossed at the ankle, his head supported on several fluffy duck feather cushions. Now and again, the sound of a glass clunking on the wooden table top could be heard each time Harry took a sip of his whisky. The lamp on the side table cast dancing shadows across Harry's smiling features as he thumbed his way to the next page of the well-worn copy of The Secret Garden he had borrowed from Hermione. Who knew he would enjoy reading so much? An old book at that. Well, Hermione knew, of course, but she knew everything so it hardly counted.
"This is just sick, Draco. Sick! I feel filthy! She's got her boobs all pushed up and is pouting like a trout pleading for its life, and I have no idea what the hell to do about it!"
“Soon, but not right away. Suppose we get comfortable and at least try to feel less awkward about it all?”
“You waited.” Lately, Blaise had been too busy hanging around with Ginny bloody Weasley to spare much time for his actual friends. Draco had been meaning to confront him over it, but with his Potions project almost complete, he found he was often otherwise occupied too.
When he finally arrived, the door was already open. The space was almost bare, Harry’s usual clutter that covered the surfaces gone. Harry was standing in the middle of the room, his packed trunk at his feet. Before he could overthink it, Draco stepped forwards, anxious to explain things to Harry, when McGonagall slowly rose from where she had been perched on the window seat.
“Absolutely.” agreed Draco. “Now, I have a book which should explain what you both need to know. I propose we all go over it together right now, that way we can answer any questions you both may have.”
Harry still wears his invisibility cloak and watches him play with the ducklings. He seems to have them named and spends more time with them than he does with actual people. Harry isn’t sure he can blame him, considering how people have been treating him lately.
“Who doesn’t like the smell of apples? Crisp, fresh, clean. And it doesn’t make me feel like I’m suffocating.”
The sudden need to feel Harry’s skin on his own descended upon him, like thousands of fire ants devouring him. He reluctantly released his grip on Harry’s hair and yanked the white top over Harry’s head, throwing it to the floor. Harry, seemingly on the same page, lifted off of Draco, allowing him to take his own t-shirt off as well before lowering himself back onto him, both of them gasping as the heated flesh of their chests and stomachs touched properly, intimately, for the first time.
They were small and frozen and frantic-looking as they squeaked over and over again for a mother that clearly wasn’t coming. As soon as they noticed him hovering over the nest, they began trying to climb over each other to get to him, which struck him as odd. Surely safety lay within the nest, not outside it. Without thinking too much about it, he cast warming and shield charms around the nest in quick succession. He may be Death Eater scum, but he wasn’t about to let the poor things perish while he decided what to do about them. After a moment of watching the tiny creatures continue to squawk, he stood slowly, cast a disillusionment charm over the nest, and quickly made his way to the castle. The library would have something on raising ducklings. Just until he could decide what to do with them, of course.
Harry stood awkwardly for a moment as he watched the other man try and choke back his tears and then shrugged. Draco was right. If Harry was going to keep him there, the least he could do was give Draco his personal space.
“Snape helped save us.” Harry could barely get the words out, his mouth was so dry with disgust at himself. Why couldn’t he just stop? What was it about Malfoy that always overrode his internal voice?
Harry looked at Draco's playful grin and shook his head in mock despair. God, how he loved the idiotic man!
He felt like he was cooking from the inside and couldn’t stand another moment of it. As soon as he was safely behind the partition, he took off his shoes and socks and began to pull his shirt loose from his trousers. However, before he could get far, he heard footsteps behind him.
talk to him about it! Goodness knows he won’t listen to me!” With a final glare at Harry, she bent over her notes and began to write furiously.
"Harry, Draco, you, and you," he said in a trembling voice, pointing back and forth between the two of them, "and rash, and weekend, and… and…"
He ran the back of his hand across his forehead, surprised to find his hand covered in sweat. He looked at his mother — she looked so concerned and faded around the edges, like she was blending in with the background. She was saying something to him, coming towards him, but it was like he was watching a badly recorded memory in a cheap Pensieve. Why didn’t she speak up? He resolved to tell her to enunciate just as soon as the room stopped spinning.
“Really?” smiled Draco, his eyebrows raised slightly in surprise. “You’d really dance with a Death Eater at the Hogwarts five-year reunion?”
She closed her eyes and counted to ten, begging for patience. It was also his desk, true, but only because they worked in one of those offices with a large, central desk that had two sides, one for each of them. His feet, however, weren't on his side. He was sitting beside the desk, his feet propped up in the middle. In their joint workspace. "Fine. Did you finish the file on the McDonnell case?"
“Then it would only need to be a temporary bond?” The idea of being forced into bonding with anyone, even his supposed soulmate, made Draco want to throw up.
“Later, maybe.” Draco threw the powder into the fire and stepped into the flames. “Don’t wait up, Mother. Later, Scarhead. Diagon Alley!”
“Thank fuck for that!” Harry beams, his smile lighting up the entire enclosure. Draco feels he could bask in the warmth of that smile for days. Suddenly, Harry reaches out and grasps Draco’s jumper, pulling him forwards and catching Draco’s lips with his own. Draco gasps at the contact and leans into it, desperate for more and scared he might never get it. After a moment, Harry pulls away, leaning his forehead against Draco’s.
Harry watched as Draco processed the information he had just been hit with, his face changing from shock to surprise and, finally resting in amazed delight.
Pansy yawned and poured another black coffee for herself. They'd ended up watching movies until late, and she still wasn't fully awake yet. She looked over at Neville's sleep-slackened face with a rueful smile; it was difficult to blame him for her having to be up early, but still, she wanted nothing more than to courie under the blanket with him and go right back to sleep.
“Who’re you calling a bint, you loose bitch?” Ginny’s answering yell caused the room to erupt in chaos, as both women lunged once again towards one another.
That morning, things had progressed even further. The culprit had charmed his shoes to leave duck footprints wherever he walked, and he unfortunately didn’t notice until he reached Charms and Professor Flitwick demanded to know why Draco was making such a mess on the floor. He’d gone back up to his room to change his shoes, but the arse responsible had actually cast the charm on all of his shoes! He actually found himself hoping to all the Gods known to wizards and muggles that he never found out who it was, because he would likely be facing a lengthy stretch in Azkaban for what he would end up doing to them!
Harry groaned and turned to see Malfoy striding towards him from across the courtyard. Even from this distance, Harry could see his eyes glowing with outrage and the utter fury in each step Malfoy took.
room. A quick scan showed that there was no trace Harry had ever lived here. The book Harry had been reading was gone from the nightstand, the photo of his parents and Sirius Black was gone from its place of pride on the mantle.
"You what?" gasped Hermione, suddenly feeling wrong-footed. "I thought you guys were just shagging." She paused, and then a smile pushed its way onto her face. "I had no idea you were
He could feel hands upon his skin, could hear people talking, but nothing reached him. The words were too far away, too quiet. His ears were too filled with the churning of blood inside his veins. He couldn’t focus on the hands that grabbed at him. His limbs had an agenda of their own as they shook and flipped and tensed. He could see the charmed ceiling of the Great Hall — the clouds morphing into pretty white shapes as they were blown across the ceiling by an imaginary breeze — and realised he’d fallen onto his back. It wasn’t as nice as the stars that littered it during dinner, but still nice to look at. As his limbs twitched and flopped feebly on the burning cold stone, he wondered if the clouds with blurred faces bobbing on the edges would be the last thing he would ever see.
Before Hermione could suggest anything worse than a massage, Harry practically ran into the bathroom to where Draco was hiding with an extendable ear.
“My brother died because of you, and so did Dumbledore, and Tonks—” Ginny broke off, her words hindered by the sobs that were shaking her lithe frame. Draco watched with discomfort as Harry stepped forwards and wrapped a protective arm around her quivering shoulders.
“You had no right to bring him here, Mother.” Draco’s voice shook with repressed fury, his pale face flushing with emotion.
"That's right!" Hermione nodded indignantly, lifting her boobs inside her bra to boost her cleavage. "If they had just told the truth, then none of this would be happening."
"Actually, Ron doesn't," contradicted Harry apologetically, cutting off Neville's triumph. "We really don't want him to find out yet, guys. I need to come out to him first and stuff."
As he finished speaking, he flicked his wand to cancel the Shield Spell, keeping a close eye as he did so.
He tapped the finished paper crane with his wand and watched in satisfaction as it flew across the room and landed in front of Malfoy. He couldn’t see if the git had opened it or not, and he waited for several tense minutes for a reply. Just when he was about to give up hope, the bird flapped down in front of him, stilling its wings at his touch.
Harry could hear the emptiness in his voice as he sat there, gripping the expensive parchment. He didn’t want to involve the headmistress in their pets' love lives, but Treacle was literally fading away in front of his eyes. The grief from losing Hedwig still crept up on him from time to time, and he wasn’t sure he would be able to survive that again. He flopped back onto his pillows, the letter becoming crumpled in his hands, and thought about what was the best course of action. After a while, he fell into an uneasy sleep.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Not what I was going to say. I was going to say, well, it's Harry. Mr Gryffindor who saved the world. And I'm me, ex-Death Eater."
At least an hour had passed, and Draco had to admit he was starting to feel slightly merry. His face was warm and his body felt more relaxed than it had been in days. The room had been growing steadily warmer, another inexplicable clue he supposed, and the majority of the males in the room had shucked their dress robes, their undershirts sticking to their skin with perspiration. Seamus had actually gone one step further and was sitting bare-chested as he passed the whisky around the group. Draco was the only one who still had his dress shirt on, the sleeves still covering his arms.
Once they were all presentable again, they began to make their way back down to the reunion, Susan and Justin leading the way importantly. Harry walked beside Draco at the back of the group, their fingers loosely hooked around each other.
“Wait a minute,” Draco scrunched his eyebrows, mentally running through the options, “there’s no point in talking about prep if you haven’t established consent.”
“It is.” Harry’s assurance of the severity of the situation made Ron’s eyes widen dramatically. Harry would normally have found it funny.
"Guys, give it a rest," Hermione ordered, shucking off her coat as she went. "Besides, everyone knows the Hulk would have totally handled Voldie in two seconds flat."
It was just meant to be a light comment, Draco knew that, but it stung all the same. Why couldn’t he just get to enjoy the moment without constant reminders of how fake the whole thing was? Unable to relax into the massage any longer, Draco shrugged off Harry’s hands and heaved himself off the bed.
He took a long sip of his coffee and was pondering whether he wanted to have toast and jam or not, when the post owls arrived. Draco wasn’t expecting anything from his mother this morning, but he still found himself looking up to see if he could spot Socrates amongst the other owls. He was so focused in his search that he didn’t notice the barn owl until it landed right on his plate, rendering his toast inedible.
Neville gave a sigh that positively reeked of frustration. Draco would feel bad, except Neville could have prepared them for whatever this was and hadn't.
“Good choice. Trust me, you don’t want to be here when Hermione finds out Ron hasn’t even opened his trunk.”
“God forbid anyone upsets the fucking Weasleys!” Blaise’s bitter retort was drowned out by Pansy’s vitriol.
The air in the small room was close and stale, making Draco wish he’d cast a Bubble-Head Charm before entering. It really shouldn’t have surprised him, given that Severus didn’t actually need fresh air anymore. He looked around at the familiar space as he waited for Severus to show up in his portrait, taking note of the many books and bottles lining the shelves. He couldn’t help but step closer, observing the many rare ingredients. Unicorn tears! Draco couldn’t believe it! They were ridiculously difficult to come by. Where had Severus got them from? As he reached out to lift the bottle for a closer look, a sudden low cough broke the silence, causing Draco to jump about a foot into the air in fright.
Draco sighed. “Don’t, Theo. You’ll just set the Hufflepuff off on her banshee impersonation again. My ears have been abused enough, if you don’t mind.”
“They look—Treacle and Atlantis, I mean. They look so happy, don’t they? Peaceful. I’ve missed that,” observed Malfoy, his voice taking on a wistful tone.
"Well, ah—" croaked Harry, fighting to keep his equilibrium. Images of Hermione pouring oil over her breasts flashed before his eyes, and he panicked. "That sounds very nice. I'll just pop into the bathroom and get some massage oil, then."
It keeps me up at night. It makes me lose my appetite. You’re the first thought in my head when I wake up in the morning, the last when I finally manage to fall asleep, desperately wishing to dream about you. You’re the reason I make mistakes when I brew the simplest potions, daydreaming about green eyes and messy black hair. You’re the one I want to share the good and bad news with. You’re the first person I ever wanted to kiss, back when I still thought I was supposed to hate you. I’ve been in love with you for so long that it has become a part of who I am.
Harry, you said that I’m selling myself short and I should ask the bloke I’m in love with to go out with me, but I can’t. I simply can’t. I would lose so much. I would lose a precious friend and the best person in my life and I simply cannot do that. And I know you are going to say that I’m a coward, but this is not about being brave. I’d like to think that I’ve become a more sensible person than I was a few years ago, and I want to cherish the few important things in my life. So this is me, being considerate and reasonable. I won’t tell him about my feelings, because that’s the sensible thing to do, and I don’t want him to hate me.
. If only I were still friends with Rita… Anyway, I have fastened a parcel to Baz’s leg with my personal stash of Earl Grey and herbal tea. Please don’t let any other pet take it away from you.
“Because, you pillock, I like you. More than that. It’s not love, let’s not kid ourselves, but it’s big and strong and hot and it wants to be let out.”
He quickly adjusted his grip on Treacle, who was squirming in desperation in an attempt to get back to Atlantis. A quick look in Malfoy’s direction showed that he was having a similar issue with Atlantis.
“Draco, the Healer is coming. Try to stay awake, my darling.” Salazar, his mother’s voice was laced with fear and worry and something else unidentifiable. It made him want to sink down into the dark and hide from whatever had her so upset. It made him want to lunge out of the fog and wrap his arms around her and vow to protect her no matter what. As it was, he could do nothing except lie there, blinking his eyes painfully, the light pounding at his head, his mother’s face fading in and out of focus with each pass of his lids over dry eyes.
“Are you sure? You seem— Forgive me, but you seem especially calm for someone who has just found out they have a grievous and potentially life-threatening sickness.” Draco could see the concern was genuine from the knitting of his eyebrows.
Quickly, he went into the en-suite and turned the taps on full, adding a generous amount of bubble bath to the water. From the smell of things, Draco would definitely be needing a long bath. Leaving the tub to fill, Harry went back into the bedroom to find Draco sitting up and grumbling.
“Then, perhaps you could consider semen? It’s highly potent and gives the added element of potential sexual magic.”
Draco tried to keep his hands steady as he tipped three level scoops of powdered Moonstone into the cauldron. The sudden and sporadic tremors in his hands were a relatively new development and caused no small amount of trouble when he was trying to work on his cure. In all honesty, he put a lot of effort into not dwelling on his ailment, finding it best to bury himself in homework and his Potions project.
He reached for the bottle of shampoo and squirted some onto his hand, frowning as he massaged it carefully into his hair and scalp. His mind drifted to how much he looked forward to waking up in the morning lately. Harry always woke up before him for his morning jog, and never failed to bring him back a cup of coffee, black with one sugar, just the way he liked it. The invigorating aroma rousing him from sleepy memories of his legs wrapped around Harry’s body from the night before.
“We aren’t doing anything to Draco; we’re trying to get Harry to come back to the party,” explained Hermione wearily. “He’s doing his Draco thing again.”
He tugged the bottle back from Ron and took another deep drink before passing it back to Seamus and sighed. By all rights, Malfoy shouldn’t have been allowed in the place. It was insulting to everyone who lost someone in the final battle. If the git had got his way, there wouldn’t have been anyone left alive to come to the bloody reunion in the first place!  The memory of the house tables being piled with the dead—Tonks, Remus, Colin Creevy, Fred—swam before him and he pressed his thumbs into his eyes in an attempt to dispel it.
"But I'm his best friend," Pansy said, and she almost cringed at the sound of the whine in her own voice. "He's meant to have told me already, and by his own choice! Not because I caught him out."
“You’re— Oh fuck!” He staggered to his feet, his face draining of all colour as he went. “You never told me your boyfriend was Harry fucking Potter, you dickhead.”
"Well, it's meant to hold a mini, rechargeable core for basic household spells to help Squibs with day-to-day stuff. Except, after three or so spells, the core would overheat and send random sparks shooting out the end."
Harry took a long swallow of his drink as he allowed the ridiculous idea to wander around in his alcohol-addled brain. Death Eater turned duck raiser? It was possible — after everything with Voldemort, he would never accuse anything of being entirely impossible — but was it probable? Harry had to concede that looking after helpless fluffy creatures was about as far away as one could get from letting Death Eaters into the castle. It would certainly lend him a softness that he’d never had before, smoothen down those barbs and prickles that he was so famous for. It could work, after all, everyone loves a reformed character.
“You’re the one sticking your nose in places it needn't be, Potter. Maybe you and the rest of your gang could just kindly leave?”
He quickly checked he had his cloak on him, forced his notes and books back into his bag and slung it on his shoulder. He shot a final glare at his so-called friends and, map in hand, hurried down towards the lake.
“Well, I didn’t, not really. I just asked it not to place me in Slytherin, and it decided that Gryffindor was the next best thing. It was because of you, you know.”
“Give it a rest, Zabini, it’s true.” Weasley’s voice was louder than speaking, but not quite a shout. It was impossible and unsettling and Draco wished he would just stop. “If it wasn’t for the Ferret, Harry and Ginny would be happy as clams and my mother wouldn’t have spent Christmas sobbing into Harry’s Weasley jumper that’s sitting under our tree for when he next visits!”
"Remember, twenty quid on who can spot the most barracuda!" demanded Harry, before lunging below the surface and propelling himself towards the rocks and coral.
“I must admit, I am a bit.” She smiled at him as she once again sat in her chair, and he breathed a sigh of relief, laying back down.
Draco found himself meeting her earnest gaze and realised she really was trying her best to get them out. Yes, she was damned annoying about it, but her genuine need to help was clear from the sincerity in her brown eyes. It was this, more than anything else, that prompted Draco to be more forthcoming about his needs when calling the room.
“This!” Draco practically yelled the word, as he strode over to the head of his bed and snatched up the offending item, brandishing it at Neville angrily. “I’m on about
“They're HER babies too, so you need to fight, Harry. Fight for her right to be with her mate and her babies. Malfoy’s being utterly barbaric about all this. It’s just not right!”
Draco barely registered Harry’s excuse for his poor underwear choices. His pulse was thumping in his ears as his eyes roamed over Potter’s — Harry’s — body. The stark contrast of the black tattoos against Harry’s skin was enticing, and Draco felt as if he was being pulled into Harry’s personal space, aching to touch but desperate to keep his distance. In distance lay sanity, and Draco wasn’t so sure he should throw caution to the wind so readily.
“What books?” Harry had the feeling that this was the wrong answer. Annoyance flashed across Hermione’s face and she looked to Ron for help, who silently shook his head at her in refusal to get involved.
“Powdered asphodel roots in the same mixture as powdered willow bark, Draco? Are you a simple first year?”
“What’s there to talk about? It’s done. That’s that.” Harry levitated his trunk and strode across the room, pausing when he reached the door. “See you around, Malfoy.” Draco wasn’t sure what hurt the most, the sight of Harry walking away or the fact that he was no longer ‘Draco’.
“Teddy, my godson, got them for me, and I like them,” Potter said with a smile, unaffected by Draco’s light teasing.
And that was the issue, wasn’t it? It wasn’t that Harry wanted to eat at the table that had held Colin Creevy’s body or chat with his friends near where Tonks and Remus had lain together, their fingers linked even in death. The thing was, he didn’t want to forget them. Everywhere he looked, he felt like the sacrifices of those he had loved were being erased. The feeling left bitter guilt and shame festering inside his stomach.
Once everyone had finished their driving, Miss Bumble herded everyone back into the classroom to collect their results and hand out their homework — some ridiculous amount of parchment on the experience of driving, no doubt! As long as it didn’t involve actually driving any more Muggle vehicles, Draco didn’t care what it was.
Even he had to admit Malfoy quite likely wasn’t doing any of these things with the ducklings. In fact, loath as he was to award Malfoy any kind of positive attribute, he seemed to be helping them. Caring for them. He’d definitely been building an enclosure of sorts for them. Yes, the mother was missing, but that could be innocent.
"Nev, what do you think?" Hermione waited for him to take his face out of his hands before striking a dramatic modelling pose.
“What I want, Potter, is for you to stop gawking like a disturbed codfish and come back to my room with me. Right now.”
Harry quickly cast wandless Locking and Silencing Spells at the door before he turned and pressed Draco back onto the bed, his tanned body settling on top of Draco’s pale frame.
It turned out Seamus wasn’t there, but Harry hadn’t let that stop him from achieving drunken heights. The more he drank, the more he added ideas to his list, each one becoming more and more outrageous than the last, his handwriting beginning to resemble doctor scrawl. He sloshed another generous amount of Firewhisky into his glass and peered at the list, thinking it would be so much easier to read if only the letters would stop squiggling around.
“What the everloving fuck is that meant to be?” asked Ron, as he and Hermione moved forwards to examine the room’s new offering.
"Charming. Yeah, I'm all set." Harry watched as the last of Draco's gear was fixed and checked and grinned, the excitement of the activity finally starting to settle upon him. Once he was given the all clear, Draco took his hand and they both wadded into the shallow end of the reef until they were at last waist deep in the warm waters.
The Leaky Cauldron quiz night had rolled around, and the place was heaving with optimistic patrons, all desperate to have their name written on the winner's plaque displayed proudly upon the bar. In the corner, at a large round table, Blaise and Hermione were putting the finishing touches to their plan.
The mere mention of the cursed fire caused Draco to wince. Didn’t Potter have the slightest trace of tact?
Over the next week, Draco tried two other combinations in Severus’ rooms, both of which resulted in disaster, and he was getting desperate. He spent his days trying to ignore the stabbing spikes in his chest, which the Pain-Relief Potions barely touched upon. He knew he could take a stronger dose, but it would make him drowsy and inconsistent at times — something he couldn’t afford if he was going to find a cure in time. The tremors in his hands had grown to the point that his handwriting was becoming illegible. At mealtimes, he opted to eat solid finger foods, no longer trusting his dexterity with cutlery. He was paler too; his skin was beginning to take on a muted grey tinge, made worse by the thin layer of sweat upon his brow and upper lip.
“Not if I can help it,” Harry heard Malfoy mumble as he was pushed the rest of the way through the door and it slammed closed behind him.
Blaise pushed the door open and froze, but luckily, or unluckily, she considered later, she was short enough to see beneath his arm.
“Well, maybe it’s not meant to be taken literally. Anyone here particularly decent at floral language?” Blaise asked, his voice slow with tedium.
“You’re not so bad, you know, Draco,” informed Harry, linking his fingers with Malfoy’s, “when you’re being decent, that is.”
“Nothing that you’d care to hear, most likely. I like her. She’s different. She’s fiery and smart and funny and man, can she play Quidditch!”
Harry quickly snatched his wand from his bedside table, slid it into his back pocket, and stepped out into the corridor, locking the door behind him.
“Helpful,” grumbled Draco, as he reached over and snagged a drink from one of the bottles of Firewhisky. If he was going to be stuck in here, he might as well join them in their drinking.
"Well, I guess now that you're in my arms, there's nothing left to do but actually kiss." Harry looked pale and sweaty, like a trapped animal. However, she recognised the glint in his eyes, the stubborn edge he took on when faced with overwhelming odds.
If Severus was shocked by Draco’s sudden appearance in his room at ten o’clock on a Sunday morning, he certainly masked it very well. He merely put down the book which he had been reading and quirked his eyebrow in question.
Hermione gave a little huff. She hated it when people knew things before her. "Does Pansy know? Ron can't possibly or he'd have lost his mind already."
The ginger bint turned towards him, her eyes narrowed dangerously. Draco was glad for the chance to vent and found himself sneering at her in response.
Draco eyed the packages doubtfully before curiosity got the better of him. He sat on the bed and carefully opened them, one by one, touched by how thoughtful they were. How did Harry remember he was short on ink? That his favourite quill was needing a new nib? He’d even picked up the latest edition of
However, when Harry saw the latest tray, a lunch of salad, treacle tart, and ginger tea, still lying exactly as he’d left it, he’d finally had enough. He stepped over the tray and rapped lightly on the door, pausing only for a moment before pushing the door open and stepping inside. Harry’s eyes watered as they tried to adjust to the dim room. The lamps were off, the fire was out, and even the curtains had been pulled tight shut as if the light was Draco’s enemy. The air in the room was heavy and stale, smelling of sweat and stagnation. Harry wrinkled his nose and strode over to the window, opening the curtains and the window to let in light and air. Able to see a lot better, Harry turned around and hissed in shock at what he saw.
The door shook violently as Pansy and Blaise pounded upon it from the corridor. He hadn’t seen them for days, instead opting to lock himself in his room. Everywhere he looked was a memory of Harry, as much a comfort as it was torture. He’d stopped going down for meals, instead picking a mouthful or two of whatever the house-elves brought him — on McGonagall’s request, no doubt. He barely slept too, dreaming of Harry moving over his body, the glint in his emerald eyes, only to wake up barely an hour later. His eyes were constantly red and puffy, and he wondered if it would have been better to die of the core sickness than this slow decay.
"What about you, Pans? How come you're so happy?" Hermione had noticed that she looked sly and pleased, which was never a good thing where Pansy was concerned. The woman was a Slytherin to the core.
He scrunched up his list into a ball, threw the parchment at the wall, and downed the rest of his drink. There was nothing else to do but accept that, for whatever reason, Malfoy was helping the ducklings. What’s more, he obviously didn’t want anyone to know about it, sneaking around and keeping them in a secluded area by the lake. Almost as if he didn’t want anything nice about himself to get out and ruin his murderous, cowardly reputation. Malfoy would probably be ridiculously embarrassed if anyone found out, actually.
Finally unable to ignore his bladder any longer, Harry stretched his arms out over the bed, freezing when his arm brushed something on the pillows. He opened his eyes and reached out to find a piece of parchment lying on the opposite pillow, the neat writing completely unfamiliar.
Feeling like he seriously should have left with Ron and Hermione, Harry turned to face his old nemesis and held his gaze. After a moment, he held his hand out, an offering. Draco looked at Harry’s outstretched palm and then back up to his eyes, nibbling his bottom lip as he pondered what to do. After what felt like the longest few seconds of Harry’s life, Draco smiled and placed his hand in Harry’s grasp. There was a moment where they both just stood, hands joined, staring, and then Harry turned and stalked towards the Floo, tugging Draco along behind him, deaf to the protests of his prior admirers.
Everywhere he looked, the absence of Harry screamed at him. He staggered back into the bedroom and sank heavily onto Harry’s side of the bed, feeling as if a black pit of despair was consuming him from the inside out. He lay back and rolled onto his side, burying his face into Harry’s pillow, breathing in the light remains of his scent. He knew it would fade soon, just as everything else they had shared would fade. His whole body shook violently as he began to sob, his lungs struggling to draw breath as he gasped around the pain. He’d set Harry free and Harry had left, just as Draco had known he would.
Merlin, the way you kissed me… I just can’t stop thinking about the feeling of your lips on mine, the slow drag of your tongue in my mouth. I never thought I could get so hard from a simple kiss. Although there was nothing simple about it, not when I think about the way your fingers slid through my hair and gently tugged. Or the way you gasped when I lifted your t-shirt and pressed our chests together. Gods, the sounds you brought out from me. I want to dig a hole in the ground and dive into it when I think of the way I moaned when you sucked on my neck whilst you gripped my arse and rubbed your dick against mine. I didn’t think it would be possible to lick chocolate ganache off someone’s abs, so that was a learning curve. What the fuck, Harry, when did you get those lickable abs anyway? Auror training is definitely doing some good for you.
“Yeah, Potter, just say sorry,” Draco taunted, unable to help himself. “You don’t even have to mean it.”
“Ensure your potions are appropriately labelled and left upon my desk for my assistant, Mr Davis, to grade. Once you have done so, you may go. Obviously, next lesson you will be required to submit the subject and outline of focus for your individual projects. Do not forget, or you’ll suffer my displeasure.”
“Yeah, alright. I’ll sit and behave.” Harry couldn’t help the fond smile that crept across his face at his husband’s familiar snark.
“You know that we all need to do a project for Potions? I’ve been using my core sickness for mine. Before you were told, I was looking for a cure so I could bypass bonding with my core mate.” Draco did his best not to fidget, determined to appear calm. “Well, after the Christmas holidays, I kept working on it, rather than starting from scratch on something else.” He looked Harry fully in the eye, determined to see it through. “Harry, it worked. I found a cure.”
I’m going to put it back together, Harry. I’m going to spend every single day of my life telling you that I love you, convincing you that you’re everything I want, making you believe me when I say that there’s no one else in the whole world I’d rather be with – even if we’re both drama queens, let’s face it.
“You arsehole. You absolute, judgemental, fucking dickhead.” Malfoy’s quiet words were like a curse, their impact forcing Harry back a pace. “You’re seriously going to stand there and tell me that I can’t possibly be here to see Vince? What, like I have no feelings? Or is it that you think Vince doesn’t deserve to be remembered?”
He stared at the ducklings a little longer, then seemed to slowly come to his senses. He picked himself up off the grass and lifted the rapidly dampening box. After drying the box and making it more comfortable with leaves and grass, Draco cancelled the shield charm around the nest and began to levitate the ducklings, one at a time, into the box, counting as he went to make sure he didn’t leave anyone behind. Lastly, he cast warming and silencing charms on the box — he had a Death Eater reputation to uphold after all — and then got to work.
"Say, Hermione-love, do you have plans for later?" If possible, Hermione seemed to pale even more at Harry's words, especially when they got huskier as he continued. "Maybe you could come by for a drink and we could talk, you know, just the two of us?"
“Hey, watch the goods,” he admonished snootily, although the effect was ruined by the chattering of his teeth.
“Where the fuck have you been?” demanded Harry as he hustled Draco inside the room and clicked the door closed behind them. “It’s an hour after curfew.”
"You're lucky you're hot, otherwise I have no idea how I'd put up with you!" quipped Harry, giving Draco a light shove as they left the room.
“Wait a minute,” Granger ordered, making half the room roll their eyes. ”They just appeared now? While we were wondering how to get out of the room? It’s got to be a clue.”
Yes, there’s someone I like. Love, actually. They have no idea, and I think they’d die of shock if I ever told them about it. And then everyone else I know would likely die of shock right after them. They could all form an orderly queue to faint one after the other. And I know I was banging on about not being into blonds, but actually, this person has gorgeous blond hair. They’re also used to the finer things in life, and I’m not sure they would ever want to slum it down to my level. Pity, since I think we’d be good together if we got the chance.
"Fuck, guys!" he groaned. "Do you bloody mind? If you can't get some decency, can you at least get a room?"
"Nope," his voice was clipped and overly cheerful. "I'm too busy with work for a relationship, you know me."
On the subject of Baz, I refuse to own an owl who is so easily swayed by Slytherin charm. Therefore, you are now Bartholemew’s new owner. (Don’t blame me for his name; he came with it. Why do you think I shortened it?) It’s actually perfect timing for Baz’s true colours to come out since I’ve recently adopted a new one. I found Calliope injured the other day and I’ve been looking after her. She’s a lot nicer than Baz and seems really happy to stay, so congratulations! You’ve just got yourself a mean owl. Enjoy!
“I’ve told you why,” retorted Harry, exasperation dripping from his words. “I’m sorry for what I said earlier. I know it’s not an excuse, but it was all so fast and then everyone was staring at us and I just panicked. News flash—even the chosen one fucks up on occasion.” Harry could hear the exasperation in his voice begin to slide into panic and tried to breathe some calm into himself. “Please?”
“Look, I’ll happily call whoever you want whatever you want as long as I get a drink sometime soon,” Seamus grumbled, and everyone readily agreed that a good drink was exactly what the situation needed.
“No! I refuse to let you tell him!” He forced himself to sit upright, his arms flailing uncoordinatedly, disrupting the bedding as he tried to get off of the bed. “Let me go. You can't keep me here!”
“Checking out where Malfoy’s going,” he mumbled, scanning the map for the git’s name, doing his best to ignore the collective groans from his friends and the muffled Muffiliato Hermione quickly cast around them. “Ah! He’s at the lake!” He looked up at his friends triumphantly, his enthusiasm dimming slightly when met with two very unimpressed expressions. “What?”
Harry could see crowds beginning to form as word of a Malfoy/Potter spat spread. Add in the prospect of illicit seahorse sex and a pregnant pet, and everyone would be talking about this for days. Feeling suddenly desperate to calm the whole thing down before it became another Hogwarts legend, Harry attempted to try reasoning with Malfoy.
"I can't turn it off," Draco mumbled to whoever was listening. "I use it for work, and I might be called in." He sighed mournfully, looking up at his friends. "I swear, if I ever find out who gave my number out, I'll strangle them."
“I’m going to clean these before I can heal then, okay, Draco?” Harry advises, looking carefully for any sign that Draco has heard him.
“Well, what about the rope then? What does that mean, other than the fact that this talk of shacking up with Harry is making me want to hang myself.” Draco ran his hands roughly through his hair, done with the whole situation.
“No, you’re just a guy who’s making bad choices, and I’m trying to help. Look, why not have a bath and try to relax? I’ve had Kreacher bring over some of your clothes. You’ll find them in the dresser and wardrobe.” As an afterthought, he waved his hand to stop the taps running, aware that the bath must be close to full by now.
I know I don’t deserve a second chance from you after what I’ve done, but please just read this one letter.
“The floor is cold? No shit, Potter!” scoffed Draco, his hands shaking violently even as he fluttered them at his throat in mock surprise. “I might not make things easy, but
What about you? Is there someone you fancy? Someone obviously not blond, since you clearly despise that hair colour.
“Harry!” The disappointment in Hermione’s voice made Harry feel ten times worse, which he hadn’t thought was possible a mere second before.
Abruptly, Harry’s voice cut through his musings, forcing him to shift his attention to the proceedings.
“Well, they won’t need protection if they can’t prep properly.” Countered Harry, stubbornly folding his arms across his chest.
Only just realising they had company, the brunette pulled his mouth off Draco with an audible pop and turned his horrified gaze upon Harry.
“Considering our pasts, Potter, one could hardly blame you for that.” The smile Draco gave Potter was grim and wan and seemed to add to whatever guilty conscience Potter was already wrestling with.
Two days after Harry received Malfoy’s letter, he still hadn’t decided what to do. Ron had suggested that he get another seahorse to see if the company would perk Treacle up a bit, but Hermione had told him to hush. She was brimming with the kind of fervour he only saw in her when she got going about S.P.E.W, but instead of getting on his nerves, it actually made him feel a little better.
He realises that he hasn’t heard Draco say one slur against anyone’s blood status or jeer about half-breeds. Somewhere along the way, Draco has changed into someone new, or maybe he’s always been this way and never had the chance to express it. He notices how much time Draco actually spends with the ducklings, teaching them to swim properly, how to feed themselves. He makes sure they’re clean and warm.
“Oh Draco, you look terrible! When did you last sleep? Are you even eating?” He stood still as Pansy fussed over him, peering into his face and eyeing him critically. Even Blaise, who was usually unflappable, looked concerned. Not that Draco cared. What did it matter if he ate, anyway?
“Harry, come on! Either do it properly or I swear I’ll tell Molly you didn’t eat those pasties she sent over last week.”
asking him out." Hermione laid her hand on Harry's and trailed her finger over his hand for some reason. Her voice was saccharine, and hearing her simper was just plain wrong as far as Draco was concerned. She'd been fawning over Harry all night, and Draco was about two minutes away from checking her for a badly cast Imperio.
“Antidote?” Harry scrunched up his eyebrows as if trying to solve a complicated puzzle. “Wait a minute. You think I’m under a Love Potion or something?” Harry began to grin broadly and reached for Draco’s hands, rubbing his thumbs over the pulse points at Draco’s wrists. “I’m
After several tortuous minutes of pretending to listen to the professor's instructions on how to bow while maintaining eye contact, Harry decided to send Malfoy a little note. Since they’d met in the hallway a couple of days ago, Treacle had seemed a little down. Harry was sure it was because she missed Atlantis, and he hoped Malfoy would be up for letting the pets have some time together at some point.
“Draco— Shit, you’re freezing! Look, let’s just get you off this floor and then we can talk about the other stuff.”
Harry whipped his head around at Draco’s words to see Draco leaning against the door jamb. He looked dressed for a night out, with impossibly tight black leather trousers and a grey silk shirt with the top few buttons open to reveal an expanse of pale, hairless chest. His arms were crossed over his chest, which only served to highlight the slight roundness of Draco’s stomach. However, what really drew Harry’s eyes was the searing fury glinting in the usually cold grey eyes as he faced his mother.
He settled himself into his chair and tried to force himself to relax as Narcissa called for the house-elf, who appeared and began to busy themselves with the tea immediately. Once they had both been served, the elf popped away, leaving Harry to fidget with his cup as Narcissa watched him curiously.
“I’m serious, Harry. You should go to the school counsellor McGonagall set up. She’s really good. Honestly, this isn’t healthy.”
Harry felt a static at his fingertips. Something wasn’t right with Malfoy, that much was clear. He looked at his friends, and he knew if he said anything they would give him the ‘you’re obsessed with Malfoy’ talk again. Just the thought made Harry shiver.
"Yeah, just keep doing what you're doing," Blaise assured her. "You won't have to have sex, just a little more flirting and then I bet we win."
“Of course,” growled Draco, revelling in the feeling  of Harry grinding their cocks together. “Of course the bloody Saviour can do wandless bloody magic.”
“Mother,” breathed Draco, guilt and remorse eating away at him almost as painfully as the core aching inside his chest. He pulled her to sit on the edge of the bed and wrapped his arms around her, although whether to comfort himself or his mother, he wasn’t sure. “I promised I would do what I could to keep fighting, didn’t I? I meant it. I can’t involve Potter — I just can’t — but I can try and find another way.”
“The baby. Of course, the baby,” repeated Draco in a near whisper. He glared at Harry and lurched to his feet, swaying precariously before managing to catch his balance. “That’s all you fucking care about, isn’t it?” continued Draco, his voice steadily rising now, “the filthy Potter spawn that’s fucking up my life! Well, screw you and screw the baby.”
However, Luna just shrugged, completely unaffected by his ire. She plucked a flower from the bunch next to her feet and began to fix it into her braid, humming tunelessly to herself as she worked.
“I’m fine, Ronnnald!” She dragged the word out as she wrapped her arms around Ron’s neck and attempted to pull him down for a kiss. “I love your freckles, especially the ones on your bum.”
“Oh shut it, Weasley.” Draco fought to keep his tone even. He wished he’d never bothered to open the door in the first place. “She came looking for Harry, and then she and Pansy started on each other. I didn’t actually do anything!”
“Indicate this,” mumbled Draco, as he hit the little stick thing at the side of the wheel to make the light blink and then wrenched the wheel to the right to turn.
Draco looked tired as he spoke, his usually perfect posture more curled inwards, as if carrying a heavy load. Harry felt the stirrings of sympathy in his stomach, but before he could process the feeling, Neville decided to take control of the situation.
"Do you even know what the biggest and heaviest book in the library is?" enquired Harry, barely concealing a snort.
"I think the word is fucking, Granger," said Blaise dryly. "Although, actually, that looked more like eating—"
Finally, Draco gulped down the last dregs of his coffee and made his way out of the hall, determined to fit in a visit with the ducklings before class started. As the other eighth years called out duck puns at his back, he found himself shaking with rage. This really was all he needed. He should never have come back in the first place.
Neville let out a groan as a loud racket pulled him from his exhausted stupor where he lay stretched out on the sofa. He'd had a long weekend on patrol in Knockturn Alley. As a full Auror, even if a junior one, he didn't have to work with a trainer anymore, but he still got stuck with the crap jobs that the regular, more senior Aurors couldn't be spared to do. Most weekends, he would've been on duty with Harry, at least, and they'd joke, chat, and talk about the cases they weren't allowed to help with yet.
It was strange, being back at Hogwarts. Everyone who had survived the war, no matter what side they had been on, had been required to return to Hogwarts to get their N.E.W.T.s, to heal and try to adapt. At least, that’s what their letters had said. Eighth year was an anomaly in many ways — they were now houseless, orphaned from their prior houses, and somewhat adrift together. McGonagall claimed that the school wasn’t designed to house an eighth year, and therefore, as adults, they couldn’t be categorised in the same way as the lower years.
For a moment, Potter simply looked at him. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat at the sight of Potter’s caramel skin as he began to strip. His chest was hard and toned with a light dusting of fine black hair across the centre and down his abs, forming a sinful pleasure trail that disappeared into the waistband of his novelty boxers. Sure enough, there were tattoos across Potter’s chest, his biceps, and even one on a rather firm thigh, the ink sneaking out from under his boxers and winding down almost to the knee. The sight made Draco want to touch the ink on his own thigh, sure he could feel the snake undulating in a bid for attention. Harry was right, they were almost the same as his, right down to the location of each tattoo.
"Yes, mum," Ron said dully, earning him a glare from Hermione. "I won't," he said, this time with a little more conviction.
Harry, mind whirling, had no idea what Draco was trying to do. Is this little ferret still trying to be my friend? Why isn’t he just fighting with me! Why is everything so darn confusing? What in Merlin’s name is going-
I told you. I’m different, Harry echoed Draco’s words, completely mortified, confused and… glad at the same time? Was this rivalry over? That was certainly comforting, but was Draco really different? Had the war changed him that much? Well, he did just hug me…

“I don’t know,” Draco said simply, still staring at Harry. “Slughorn said this would take the whole hour, but it only took forty minutes… I guess we could just sit here for the rest of the hour.”
"Slughorn's not looking. You can curse all you want," Malfoy said calmly. Calm? Harry's thoughts whirled. When has Draco bloody Malfoy ever been calm?! "Here," Malfoy extended his hand, "Let me see."
“Well… maybe what I said is true. About what could happen with his father gone, about the self-preservation. Maybe Draco really is just trying to be normal. He’s certainly… gone through a lot.”
"Strong smells," Draco said absently, already beginning to pick through a few boxes. "Here," he said coldly, throwing something to Harry. "You do this side," Draco waved to the left, "and I'll do this side," he pointed to the right. Too nervous to say much, Harry just nodded, getting to work on his assigned side. He flew through the first box Malfoy had given him, and quickly got through half, before coming across a box of small labeled bags. Inside were miniscule amounts of ingredients that Harry guessed were expensive, and he spent a good deal of time arranging the oddly named powders and dried fruits in alphabetical order. After that, it was easy work again, and before Harry knew it, an hour had gone by. When the two of them had finally finished, stepping back to admire their work, Harry had smiled. It
"Elixir to Induce Euphoria," Slughorn announced proudly, "and if I remember correctly, Mr. Potter brewed a perfect — nay, outstanding — batch of it last year. Added peppermint to reduce the side effects, didn't you?" Though Slughorn said it quite cheerily, Harry nearly gagged.
“Sick,” Ron mumbled, eating more sausage. “Why’d you want to go and kill a load of muggles anyways?”
A surge of confidence welled up in Harry. “Let’s go,” he said firmly, beginning to walk behind Draco, who was heading into a dense cluster of trees.
“Reduced to pushing people now, Bailey?” Harry got up, grabbing his books. “Was throwing people in lakes not good enough for you?”
"Alright, you two, quiet down, will you? I'm gonna go to the back and ask Malkins a question," Harry stood up, careful not to knock any of their items to the ground, and began making his way to the back. However, just as soon as he'd left, he could hear Ron and Hermione arguing again, apparently not listening to Harry's directions. He smiled to himself, staring at the ground, and nearly bumped into the figure before him.
“I agree,” Harry nodded, getting up as he finished his food. He started packing his books away in his bag, stuffing the Daily Prophet into the fold of his arms.
“Oh, shove off, Malfoy,” Harry said crossly, wrenching his arm away, “I can’t believe I even thought about talking to you, even for a moment. You’re a prat, and you’ve always been a prat. ‘Getting too many people involved’... You’re probably just waiting for the right moment to hex me, all alone in some broom cupboard. I think we both know just how trustworthy you are.”
They were all silent for a few minutes. Harry took his eyes off his toast, which was cut into several pieces, and let his eyes wander around the room. He hovered on the Slytherin table, and noticed that Malfoy was, like yesterday, sitting several heads away from his usual clique. Suddenly, Malfoy turned up to look at him, and they were caught, for a brief moment, in each other's stares. Harry felt his stomach twist with unease, feeling like he couldn't look away. Then, as if nothing had happened, Malfoy lowered his head, and Harry turned back to his toast. He didn't seem to be nearly as upset as last night — the swelling had gone down, the red in his eyes had reduced — but the familiar sneer was nonexistent, just like all the other days. Maybe this really is his new normal, Harry thought, taking a piece of cut-up toast.
Harry glared at Draco, but he didn’t seem to send it back. He simply cocked his head, held out his hand, and waited for Harry. With difficulty, Harry reached his hand out and put it into Draco’s. He wasn’t mean or coarse, and shook Harry’s hand with great gentleness. Taken aback, especially by the softness of Draco’s demeanor, Harry yanked his hand away. Draco, strangely, frowned at this.
“Uh-” Harry looked back between Filch and Ron, waiting for instructions. Hermione looked just as unsure.
Singing with excitement, Romilda clapped her hands, skipping away to her own dorm. Relieved, Harry dashed the last few meters up to his room, and stealthily made to his bed. Drawing the four poster’s curtains around him, Harry let out a short breath, body spinning. His last thoughts before he drifted off to sleep consisted primarily of Draco Malfoy.
"No, no, we can wait," Harry assured, getting a scowl from Ron. "Do you have a place we can set our stuff down?"
Harry had slept badly last night, and so when he came down to the great hall, it was in a slow stumble. He rubbed his eyes with his hands, trying to seep vision out of them. Hermione and Ron were already down there, and she seemed to be buzzing with energy. Slightly curious, Harry walked over to the Gryffindor table and slipped into a seat next to Dean.
Malfoy shrunk back, sliding down the tree. "What?" he said meekly, trying to draw his hood back over his head. "Just-just leave me alone, please."
That morning was far brighter and cheerier than yesterday's, the atmosphere boasting a belly of cerulean blue. Clouds swam about, as if someone had dipped their thumb in confectioner's sugar and streaked it across the sky. Harry was almost sad to leave; he had felt at home in the Burrow all summer. He ate slowly, enjoying the tumultuous amounts of food that Mrs. Weasley was piling onto their plates. He spent a good part of the morning avoiding his trunk, which had barely been able to close. Ginny was present this morning, having missed breakfast yesterday, and they spoke in polite tones about what they would be studying that year.
“Harry, c’mon,” Draco grabbed Harry shoulders, clutching on tightly. “We need to talk,” he said quietly, but firmly, looking straight at Harry.
"Me too," Ginny said quietly, removing her hand from Harry's. With a fleeting smile, Harry watched her run up the stairs, right behind Hermione, soon out of sight. Alone, Harry took a final gulp of orange juice before standing up.
“It’s not very nice to throw someone in a lake, is it?” Harry said, fiery, stepping closer to Bailey. “You and your friends thought that’d be a right joke, to drown someone.”
The class had long since abandoned their elixirs, and Harry could feel everyone's eyes on him. He looked back at Malfoy, who flinched when Harry turned to him.
Suddenly, Romilda brightened. "We could just have a match together, right, Harry? Just ride around on our brooms? Maybe we could even share one," her eyes glistened, and Harry's hand receded from its place on her shoulder.
"Mr. Malfoy, though you did not explicitly do anything wrong, I happen to think that you and Mr. Potter need to learn how to get along… Only for a week, boys. I cannot teach this class if you two are going to be causing trouble." Slughorn looked distastefully at them, before turning around to face the class.
“Not everyone’s ‘the amazing Potter’, Harry.” Draco said this quietly, but it still stung Harry into silence. Taking advantage of this brief pause, Bailey jumped back into the conversation.
“Right,” Harry swallowed, looking away from Malfoy’s eyes, which were staring right into him. He picked his glasses up, screwed them on his face, and looked around.
Stepping aside, Slughorn grandly revealed a pot of something yellow and aromatic. Harry leaned forwards in his seat.
"It's true, you know," Harry smiled, clambering into his own bed. "And, besides, I think Hermione knows it too. You're the daft one here, Ron," Harry laughed.
“What they said is true,” Draco said in a low voice. “I had a lot to think about this summer, with my father gone.” Draco was dead-serious, looking straight at Harry. “I wanted to throw a million insults your way when we met in Malkins that day. But I didn’t. My side lost. My father lost. I don’t need to lose, too,” Malfoy said gently, but still wore a sober expression on his face.
“He’s not all bad,” Harry’s words spilled out, nearly shocking himself. Is that really how I think about him now? Then, Harry countered that. It’s true, though, isn’t it? He’s risking his life right now. He has no intent of continuing with the Dark Lord’s plans…
"Oh, Ron," Hermione laughed, "we'll get you some second-hand ones that aren't maroon and frilly, okay?"
“So,” Harry looked at him, controlling the urge to lash out at Malfoy, “what’s it like now? Back to ‘Potty’, ‘Weasel’, and ‘Mudblood’? Should I start calling you ferret now?”
"Come on, Harry, Ron, let's go get our cauldrons. I heard the second-hand ones were almost gone!" Her bushy hair bustling behind her, Harry and Ron followed in suit, nearly knocking over a small, portly old lady as they rushed through the crowd. The sounds of wizards and witches advertising their products, the warm smell of waffle cones at Fortescue's, and the cold, late-August air enveloped the three of them. They began darting from shop-to-shop, balancing cauldrons, books, and other items on their arms. A quick stop in each shop allowed them to retrieve everything in an hour, and soon they were left with the task of buying robes. A disgruntled Ron trudged after Harry and Hermione, grumbling about all the things he was carrying. The three all stepped into Madam Malkins, a rush of linen-smelling air blowing as the door opened.
Suddenly, Draco’s hand grabbed his own, which had been resting on the side of the bed. Harry froze, unsure of what to do. What’s he doing?
She seemed discouraged, something Romilda rarely was, and Harry bent his head. "I'm sorry, Romilda, but I just don't think that you're going to make it on the team." Looking up, he saw her nose wrinkle and eyes water. Praying she wouldn't cry, Harry touched her shoulder and steered her away from the field.
The carriage rolled along, scaling the hill up to Hogwarts with great efficiency. Quickly, they arrived at the great doors, and everyone jumped out, heading straight for the castle. A heavier rain began to descent upon the students, and Harry raised a hand over his glasses, trying to see. He felt Hermione grab his hand, pulling him towards the castle, and relief washed through him as he felt his feet hit stone. Smiling, Harry stretched his arm out to feel Hogwarts again. He smelled something very good coming from the kitchens below, and ran after Ron, who was hurrying towards the Great Hall. He felt a little of his nervousness disappear as he was once again enveloped in the magic of Hogwarts.
Malfoy frowned. “I… Harry, the gesture is nice, but frankly, I thought we were just friendly acquaintances. It’s a bit hard to overcome seven years of hatred, you know.”
Harry hadn’t cried. It wasn’t all that big of a deal, anyways. He really should have seen it coming. Slytherins are never that nice, just for the sake of kindness, Harry thought miserably, burrowing his face in a musty robe. He’d been here for twenty minutes, mulling everything over. After the rush of fury at Draco, he was feeling incredibly angry at himself. How could I be so stupid? To think he’s really changed, that he really wanted to be my friend? All he wants to do is use me. To be protected. What a git. I’m a git. Harry pressed his head against the back of the wardrobe. It was warm and quiet in here. It was still and relaxing. Harry didn’t even play with the logic of why the Room was still standing after the fiendfyre, but he was grateful it was. A clock was ticking softly somewhere else in the room, comforting him. He just needed to think. Without Hermione running through every fact and warning sign, without Ron saying “I told you so.” He wrapped the velvet robe he had found tighter around him. He felt like sleeping for the rest of the week.
Suddenly, Harry felt a sharp prick in his hand, and looked down to see the shrivelfig coated in a thin layer of blood.
“Draught of the Living Dead,” Draco grunted, pointing to the shattered vial on the ground, just a few feet away. “I don’t think he was trying to kill me… probably had bigger, worse plans,” Draco winced, holding his side.
“Mr. Potter! What on Earth?” Madam Pince jumped, scandalized at the fight about to break out in her library.
“We need to get you to Madam Pomfrey,” Harry said sharply, beckoning Hermione to come closer. “Should we levitate him or…?”
He looked horrid. Some kind of a curse had given his skin a strange, waxen complexion. His mouth was twitching, body shivering. Harry felt a twinge of empathy. No matter the amount Draco had played him, Harry could certainly understand what he was feeling — alone, sleeping, in the infirmary. A dark wizard after him. Harry leaned down into the chair beside him, pulling the cloak off of him. Assuring that the curtains concealed them completely, Harry brought his head down to Malfoy’s.
“Slow down?” Harry said incredulously, “you’re asking me to slow down? It’s you that needs to slow down, Malfoy. You’ve been absolutely unpredictable the whole time we’ve been at school, and its driving me crazy! Why won’t you just go back to normal? You’re being way too nice, way too quiet, and way too… unlike Malfoy. The only part that actually seemed like ‘you’ was when you betrayed me, but even after that, you continued the act… you’ve never been this patient… or good at lying, in general…”
"Right now," Malfoy growled, making a small step to indicate he wanted to get by. Harry, unaware, continued on, feeling his old self getting back into the rhythm of taunting Malfoy.
“What if I’m seen, Hermione? I don’t want Malfoy to know. I don’t want anyone knowing,” he mumbled. “I’m going to get the cloak.”
Suddenly, someone else entered. By the looks of the shoes, it was a girl, and Harry had the urge to tell her to get out. She walked over to Draco, and through the door, Harry could see the face of Pansy Parkinson in the mirror.
Safely, they dragged themselves up onto the land, not noticing as Bailey, the other boy, and the girl fled, aware of what they'd just done. Heaving himself up, Harry pulled Draco out of the water a little more and looked at his leg.
The tall boy and the shorter boy both sniggered along with the girl, and Malfoy's carefully protected face looked a little broken.
"But it's Harry," Ron argued, "Usually it's me knocking people into their porridge," Ron stole a glance at Dean, who still had a little porridge on his forehead.
"Bloody hell, of course he knows," the other man butted in with quiet fervor, coming dangerously close to the fire, face lit dramatically by orange light. "They said he was goin' to fire Kenny that week. Guess Kenny knew and thought it'd be better to quit. Not like we all knew."
"Pete! I swear, next time you ask for a favor, I'll make sure it's not 'a camping trip in the woods.' This isn't camping! This is-this is torture!"
Harry, still feeling uncomfortable, didn’t dare look back at Malfoy. He hadn’t said anything about Draco’s confession, but then again, he had no idea what he could say. Never had Malfoy been so un-Malfoy, and this startled Harry immensely; if what Draco had said was really true, and it seemed to be by his genuine tone of voice, then Harry wasn’t sure what to do. It wasn’t like it was entirely impossible that Draco could have changed. Harry knew that war was an impactful thing, and with Malfoy losing his father, who seemed to control nearly every aspect of Draco’s life… it was plausible. Very plausible, in fact.
"Just-It's fine, Potter," Malfoy turned back to the cauldron, face back to formality. Just like that, as quickly as his walls had broken, he'd put them back up. Harry slumped in his seat, bewildered.
"Lauren! Pete! Stop the bickering and shut up!" Patricia's voice wavered, and Pete looked over to her.
"It's fine." Malfoy took his wand, muttered something else, and the blood was gone. Swiftly, he brushed the fig into the cauldron, and a cloud of pink smoke erupted in their faces.
The two ran off in search of food, leaving Harry by himself. He sat over by the band, watching the other students chat amiably in the crowd.
It was the last night of detention, and it was by far the strangest. Draco was actually speaking to Harry; something that hadn’t happened much since sixth year. Harry had a strong feeling that it had to do with that day at the lake. Wouldn’t you want to speak to someone after they saved you from drowning?
Pansy snorted at this, but Draco continued. “I guess… the fact that I’d be just like my dad when I grew up was… ingrained in me. I never really thought about being anything else, except what he or the Dark Lord dictated for me. And then, when neither were there, and I was suddenly all grown up… I realized that…”
"I can't believe you think making nice with the light side is going to save you from anyone," she hissed, teeth glinting viciously.
Breakfast was finished, and then the Gryffindors rushed off to Potions. Once in the dungeons, Harry caught up with Draco, who was walking alone a few paces ahead.
“I ‘spose it is,” Harry smiled, turning to the back of the portrait door as they began filing out. “I ‘spose it is.”
After their trunks were taken away, and Harry found a compartment on the train, he waited for Hermione and Ron to be finished with their Prefect business. Luna, Neville, and Ginny had joined him in the car, however, and they made for good company. Luna kept going on about how her and her father had spent the summer searching for more Snorkacks and Wrackspurts, though Harry had a feeling that everyone was only half-listening. Neville seemed a little shaken, most likely daunted by the idea of returning to Hogwarts, and sat quietly in the car for the majority of the ride. When asked about his summer, though, Neville mentioned briefly about going on a trip with his Gran, but the details didn't seem to be very exciting. Ginny didn't say much, content with the background noise of Luna's ramblings, and Harry stared out the window, counting the minutes until Ron and Hermione showed up. Finally, impatient and bored, Harry got up to leave the boxcar.
“You really do,” Pansy said, and Harry heard her purse clasp with a click. “Good luck, then. I guess this is our… parting.”
Harry glanced to where Slughorn was looking, and saw Malfoy sitting, hunched over a book on his own table. Swallowing hard and attempting to push away the nervous storm that was brewing in his stomach, Harry grabbed his things and sat next to Malfoy, who seemed to not have noticed a change.
Harry had escaped the Room of Requirement, sliding past Draco, who seemed to be sleeping soundly on the floor. Once he had entered the hallway, the door melted into the wall, becoming inconspicuous. Breathing with relief, Harry began creeping down the halls, slowly making his way to the Gryffindor common room. It was late, but Filch didn’t seem to be patrolling the halls. Harry miraculously made it up to the portrait of the Pink Lady, whispering the password as she shook her head at him.
Stomach swirling madly, Harry rushed out, running down the staircase. Say thank you? After he played me like that? Furious and yet conscience stinging, Harry flew down to Potions, guiltily glad that Draco wasn’t going to be there.
"Well," she said carefully, "I 'spose it's exciting to be going back to Hogwarts, but I didn't think either of you enjoyed buying school supplies all that much…"
“Oh, no,” Harry groaned, sliding the paper away from him in disgust. “We don’t have to go, do we, Hermione?”
The sorting passed quickly, Harry only clapping for Gryffindors. After all the first years had sat down, on edge in their seats, McGonagall rose to greet the student body, a wise gaze setting upon her face.
“Can’t believe they’re being that loud,” Hermione shook her head, leaning deeply into her new Potions book. However, before she could be immersed in the world of Mugwort and Pewter Cauldrons, the laughter came again, along with the screeching scoot of Madam Pince’s chair.
Eager to help, Madam Malkins beckoned Harry to come towards her. She directed him to a small, overstuffed chair in the corner, and the three of them set everything down.
“Just stop it, will you? Just stop trying to be my friend again. I swear, if you manipulate me-” Harry was heaving with each word, still trying to get on his broom properly, “-one-” a big breath, “-more-” a heave, “-time-” Harry successfully scrambled onto his broom, “-I will kill you, Draco Malfoy, and I am dead serious.” Harry ignored the near-wounded look on Malfoy’s face. He’s so pitiful. Where’d that stinking Malfoy pride go? Does he even have the decency, to himself, to just give up? It’s not working, whatever little scheme he’s playing out. I’d honestly rather prefer him insulting me than bugging me with his protection issues…
Walking swiftly towards the Gryffindor table, Harry seated himself between Ron and Seamus, who was excitedly talking to Dean about his summer.
When Slughorn had dismissed them, and they had escaped the cupboard, Harry swore Draco was actually looking a little pleased. His impassive, steely gaze had been replaced with not quite an expression of content, but certainly something far pleasanter than the deadpan stare he had come in with. Feeling nearly happy himself, Harry left, though a nagging thought kept pounding in the back of his mind:
“Glasses,” he said weakly, and Harry almost flinched; he could feel Draco’s breath right on his cheek, their noses uncomfortably close.
With this odd, newfound comfort on his mind, Harry drifted off to sleep, mind peaceful for once as he floated away.
Taking advantage of the pause, Harry shot a quick glance at Malfoy, mind whirling. Though just as quickly as the silence had came, it vanished, and Harry powerfully pushed through the crowd. Breaking into a run, he nearly tripped as he made his way to the Divination Tower, lungs burning as he burst through the trapdoor. Breathing heavily, he made his way to a pouf in the back, ignoring Trelawney’s furrowed, intent frown.
“What?” Ron squealed, whipping around to face Hermione. “How could you believe Draco bloody Malfoy?”
"Last year at Hogwarts for all of you," Mrs. Weasley choked. "Ginny, study well, dear, I don't want you having to go for an eighth year like these ones."
Malfoy blinked at Harry. "No, Potter. I wasn't sleeping. Now, can you go get the supplies?" Malfoy's drawl seeped in a little, but his gaze remained bored and plain.
“Did the last interaction have something to do with this little friend break-up?” Bailey simpered, gleefully cackling.
“I-I don’t know,” Harry said truthfully, “it’s-well-I know plenty about those type. You know, big bullies with no real threat. And yet… those weren’t just school thugs-”
She glared viciously at the man beside her. "Of course I didn't like him, but it's not like I like you either. The both of you are annoying."
Though there was only a trace of venom, Harry still felt uncomfortable. "Yeah," Harry responded. "It's me."
Though Ron didn't vocalize it, Harry knew he was really thinking about Fred. Not pushing the subject, the three of them, along with Neville, Ginny, and Luna, all hopped onto an open carriage. Just as Harry could feel the wheels moving along, he peered out the window, and saw a lonely, hunched Malfoy entering a carriage by himself. Eyes wide, Harry watched as his usual group of friends - Pansy, Goyle, and Blaise, all climbed into a separate carriage. He could just see, behind a dirty carriage window, the face of Malfoy, now free and released from its stony trap. A jolt of surprise ran through Harry as he watched Malfoy's face screw up in angry sorrow, putting his head into his lap. Harry saw what he thought was a sob rack Malfoy's body, and as he lifted his head, something wet covered his cheeks. The carriage began to move forward, but before Harry turned around, he caught Malfoy's eye; his expression changed from miserable to pure fear, realizing what Harry had just witnessed. Embarrassed, Harry whipped his head around, unsure of how to process what he'd just seen. There'd only been one other time Harry had seen Malfoy crying, and that was right before he'd tried to
"I think she got more annoying over the summer," Harry muttered, rubbing his temples. He stopped for a second, breathing in the crisp fall air. Opening his eyes, Harry's eyes floated over to the lake, where he watched a leaf slowly drift from its branch. As his eyes followed the leaf, however, he saw a dark figure hunched under the tree. In a matter of seconds, a group of Slytherins joined the figure, speaking loudly.
“Fiery,” Bailey said, smiling. “Well, since Malfoy has no bodyguard…” Bailey motioned to Farxley, who began promptly casting several nasty curses on Malfoy. A few Gryffindors in the crowd gaped at Harry, who was watching, unflinching. “Oh, Harry, c’mon, we all know Malfoy’s a prick, but…” someone called out, but Harry ignored them. He met Malfoy’s eyes for a long second, shooting as much hatred his way as possible.
“Oh, like killing is so easy — wait, according to you, it is, seeing as you threw Malfoy in a lake.”
“You okay?” Harry asked again, rushing to Draco’s side before he could stop himself. Ron looked scandalized.
"Yeah?" Harry turned to face Malfoy, "It's not like I was doing anything different. We always fight. You're the one messing it up with your little 'act for redemption'."
Harry’s head was still reeling, Malfoy’s bizzare behavior never failing to occupy his thoughts. The shouts from outside were muted in the locker room, but for some reason, they made Harry queasy. He wasn’t usually like this, but the strangeness of the whole week had lead up to a totality of naseous stomach aches and cramps. Today was the worst day to be getting them, but Harry slung his broom over his shoulder and slunk out into the field.
"I… uh, I can go get the materials, if you want," Harry suggested, but still Malfoy remained silent. Is he asleep? Harry thought, and reached a tentative hand out to touch his shoulder. Lightly, Harry gave him a little shove. When nothing happened, he shook him again, this time causing Malfoy to dazedly lift his head up.
"Thanks," he said, voice only a little gruff, and pushed past Harry into the next boxcar. Taking a quick glance, Harry noticed the car was completely empty; no Pansy, no Blaise, no Goyle, and certainly no Crabbe. Wondering if Hermione really was right, Harry averted his eyes and began making his way down the corridor, searching for his friends.
They both peered at him, curious. Harry thought for a moment. He’s probably sleeping now. I could just go in, say a quick ‘thanks’, and he’d never know. I’d be free of the guilt, maybe.
“It was an old product,” Ron stared at the thing, “it was supposed to change colors, but I think the manufacturing was flawed…”
“Hey, Malfoy.” Harry’s words were barely audible, but Draco’s eyes fluttered, just for a second. Drawing back, Harry prepared to pull the cloak over himself, but Draco didn’t wake. Breathing, Harry stooped down again.
Harry pulled out the fine, silk dress robes he had bought from Malkins the day he’d met Malfoy. Shrugging, he drew it over him, pleasantly surprised by the cool of it. He clasped the button in the front, sliding it on neatly, and squeezed his hands into a pair of black gloves.
“And the work of a Wizard, I’m guessing?” Ron may have had a mouthful of food stuffed in his face, but his expression was serious.
“Fine for now,” Ron said stiffly, a mixture of anger and regret washing over his face. “I’m- sorry Harry. He’s…” Ron didn’t finish, but Harry could tell that by watching Draco suffer through the Cruiciatus, Ron was starting to get ahold of his anger. “Sorry,” he said lamely, turning to face the attacker.
“I think it’s a rather good idea,” Hermione said, giggling at the idea of Ron in a tight, hot pink skirt suit.
Malfoy let out a quiet, subdued laugh, and Harry smiled. Had he ever heard him laugh like that before? Normally it was a sneer…
Draco began sorting the baneberry into another box, following Slughorn’s orders — Just put the ingredients in these boxes here. Er-should you label them? I don’t see why not. Yes, box and label them, please.
"Is it funny to you, Potter?" Malfoy questioned, voice a little high. He wasn't acting angry, but he seemed extremely tense. Harry watched as Malfoy struggled to get control of his emotions.
"That's a bummer!" She simpered, pouting. "Quidditch match it is, then! Next Sunday, after the trip, okay Harry?" Romilda then ran ahead, but not before giving a girlish wave back to him. Harry weakly waved back, waiting until she had her back turned to groan.
“Must’ve run off,” he said, looking concerned. Then, something flashed across Draco’s face — an idea.
“And is throwing people in lakes cool, Bailey? Do you think bullying people, drowning people, is some kind of a- a trend? That’s sick. That’s really, really, sick Bailey.”
"Erm… Romilda Vane? For Beater?" Harry stared in disbelief as Romilda sauntered across the field towards him, grinning.
That day was miserable. Harry’s wish for a clear mind didn’t seem to come true; his thoughts were frantically buzzing in his head. At breakfast, Ron and Hermione had extracted everything out of him. Now he was forced to deal with Ron fuming over both Bailey and Malfoy, and Hermione constantly worrying about Harry’s health. He’d told them both that he was fine, but the knot in his stomach was saying otherwise. And, to make matters worse, Flitwick had just pulled him over after a very difficult Charms class. Is he going to make me drop Charms? Harry thought sullenly.
