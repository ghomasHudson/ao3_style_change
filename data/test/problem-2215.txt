"What happened?" Harry asked.
"Silverclaw," Amal said with a tight-lipped smile and a short bow. "I hope your gold is flowing like rivers and your enemies lie dead in unmarked graves."
It took about three seconds before both Amal and Silverclaw to process that.
He kept staring into the distance for a long moment. Then his focus snapped back onto Draco and Harry, so abruptly that Draco's breath caught and his cheeks went hot. Harry fidgeted next to Draco before grabbing Draco's hand and clinging to it.
Remus froze, staring at the door. His eyes didn't focus but he'd clearly heard them. Smelled? Harry wasn't sure. Either way, Grandpa Arcturus and Amal and Mrs. Malfoy wouldn't let either Draco or Harry get close to the doorway. Dobby and Ivy wouldn't let the grownups get closer to it, either.
As Harry flailed and tried to escape from Mrs. Malfoy's very determined cooing and hugging and petting his hair, Remus stood up and started pacing in the floo room. This time the growling didn't seem like a threat at all. The wards stopped poking Harry about Remus entirely.
"How can you be so confident of that?" Harry asked with a frown that Draco felt through the bond. "We don't even know how to free someone else right now."
"Third floor behind the statue of Gunhilda de Gorsemoor," Draco said. He was already mounted, cool and calm and controlled if you didn't have a link to him and couldn't feel the sheer magnitude of his worries. "We'll have to sneak through two other passages to get down to the ward room. It's underneath the library somewhere."
"Master Harry Potter does not want his letters?" Dobby asked.
It burned and danced along the lines of Dumbledore's dark labyrinth. Draco wheezed and shuddered at the weight of the magic, gritting his teeth along with Harry who panted and glowered at the altar which had blood stains coating the surface of it.
"It's gone," Remus whispered. "I think I'll just sleep for a while."
They all froze as people started moving around downstairs. Uncle Vernon started talking loudly about drills while Aunt Petunia chattered about her garden. As if she did any of the work to keep the garden up.
Harry huffed at her for the threat. Taking points when they were trying to save people. That was rude.
He shut his eyes against the failing battle going on across the room and allowed himself to commune with his magic. Nothing formal. Nothing too deep. Just gently letting his magic well up inside of himself like the tide filling a cave on the seashore.
Draco choked on a laugh while shaking his head at Harry's straight-forward approach to the problem. "While you're quite right that it will likely come down to money, there may be an issue if your magical signature has been assigned in the contract."
Then pulled Harry to his feet. They headed across the ballroom, hand in hand, though Harry was following just because Draco seemed intent on whatever it was he was thinking. It was formless and dark in the bond, no details, or images to help Harry figure out Draco's issue.
Remus opened his mouth, frowning, and then slowly shut it again. He nodded once before standing and looking to Harry who grinned.
"Damn it," Draco hissed. "We have to get to the center properly or the counter-prayer won't work, Harry."
"Why did my parents go into hiding?" Harry asked Amal. "Dumbledore said that there were reasons but that I was too young to find out."
In the cell, Remus paced. Endlessly. Back and forth and back and forth, wringing his hands while muttering under his breath. Harry couldn't hear was Remus was saying to himself but wow, it really didn't look kind at all. If anything, it looked like Remus was yelling at himself.
"It was Sirius," Harry said. "And um, well. There's some… bits. That aren't um, quite appropriate."
"I don't know," Draco hissed, wracking his brains for any hint of anything Mother or Grandfather Arcturus or any of their teachers might have said that would help.
"Is affecting," Ivy admitted, hands knotted together as she bit her lip. "Ivy didn't think she could say anything. Is very hard to…"
No sense of something new falling into place like a puzzle piece finding its mate.
Allies were good but the more important thing was going to be getting at Dumbledore in Hogwarts. If they didn't act soon, who knew what he'd do?
"Down to the basement," Harry declared. "We'll give it a try. If nothing else, we'll have eliminated one more thing that doesn't work. That has to help. Eventually we'll find what does and then we'll be able to figure out how to help everyone else so that there's no more Dumbledore controlling everyone's lives.
Which meant that Harry had to walk the Labyrinth.
And they were. Slipping out of their suite was easy. Going down the stairs was scary as anything because all the grownups were still up and around. Remus was in the ballroom. Mrs. Malfoy nearly walked into them as they went down the grand staircase. She had stacks of books in her arms and Blue at her side with even more books.
Come what may, he would stay by Harry's side. The risk to his soul and his magic wasn't enough to make him reject this gift from the Lord and Lady of Magic. He would accept the soul anchor straight into his magical core if that were what it took.
Tears burned in Harry's eyes, but he didn't let that stop his focus on Draco.
The blue phoenix trilled, low and thrumming like a cello string that had been plucked. She nodded once and then held one foot out. There was a small tube on her leg, about the length of Draco's hand. Draco caught Harry's arm, keeping him from striding right over to take it.
Harry offered Dobby a fist to bump and laughed when Dobby enthusiastically did just that. That simplified all the plotting the grownups were doing. Apparently, they'd all decided that they had to find a way to keep Aquila from getting into the wards too far, even though there was a special spot just for letting him in. And other flying people, too, not that Harry really thought anyone was going to ride their brooms all the way out here.
Either way, Harry poked the Potter wards and triggered them to war status before putting his face in the crook of Draco's neck. They were at war. That's what those wards were for. Tomorrow, or probably later today once Dumbledore figured out that he'd been tricked, Harry would have to do what Draco had.
All right, no, that wasn't going to happen.
"I'm fine!" Harry shouted back.
"The doors close automatically," Draco said as he rubbed his forehead. "Please. For the sake of my splitting head and my Mother, get those things out of there. Especially that journal. There are a great many other dark artifacts that my father collected, but the wards don't object to them so strongly. Just these. Make them go away, any of them that you see that are illegal or dangerous. Destroy them. Whatever you have to do, but please, do it soon."
Honestly, Harry sort of expected it, too.
"We found a way," Draco whispered to Mother when she picked him up. "Have Ivy show you the blue prayer book, Mother."
The Elves' bonds pulsed back to him, full of joy.
Draco saw the wards that his ancestors had put on Malfoy Manor. They covered the land and the house and the people, the books and the peacocks who stopped their strutting around the gardens as the wards shifted and moved. The peacocks screamed, wings and tails spread, as the wards accepted Draco.
Harry turned to Bill and Charlie, both of whom had gone white as sheets, their freckles standing out vividly blood red against their cheeks. Bill stood taller, more like a soldier looking at his general than a young man looking at a twelve-year-old kid. Charlie got a firmer grip on Hermione's arm because she was shaking her head no and making little horrified noises while tears poured down her cheeks.
Hopefully. Though Harry wasn't at all sure about the whole visitation by a potential deity thing. After Remus and Professor McGonagall lecturing about the Old Gods for half the morning, Harry was a bit nervous about the concept of inviting one to show up.
"Yes, but why's it here?" Draco asked a good bit more snappishly than he should have.
Harry bit his lip. "Um, I'd really like to get to the Keep as soon as possible. I mean, I did steal a Malfoy Elf, even if he wanted to be stolen. And I'm kind of missing, though not really. I mean, I know where I am and I'm doing just what I want to be doing, but Dumbledore's going to be really mad at me for not being at my aunt and uncle's place getting abused. So, um, maybe we could go to Potter Keep first and then eat and talk? If you don't mind?"
"A what?" Harry asked.
"Most would say that he fights for the Light," Grandpa Arcturus said thoughtfully, "but I've never seen much evidence of that. Mostly, Dumbledore gathers power and control over people. People and institutions. No one since Merlin has held as much power over magi society as he has."
George said, laughter echoing even though there were no bodies, no voices, no eyes, nothing but the gentle white supporting the four of them.
He rubbed his cheek against the pillowcase and bit his lip. Ivy wasn't wrong, no matter how manipulative she'd been in saying it. If Draco didn't sleep, they really would end up in a horrible row over nothing.
He'd never been comfortable going deeper into the bank. The carts were a terror and the caverns with their many vault doors hiding who knew what were worse. Doing it now, after claiming the Malfoy family magic?
"Dobby," Harry whispered and before he'd even finished saying Dobby's name, Dobby was there.
Ivy blinked, eyes going extra wide as her ears went straight out. "That is very rare, Master Draco. Ivy is only hearing of it happening once. Dobby might know more of times it is happening. He is older and stronger than Ivy."
Nothing.
"If he wants them," Quinn said with a little sniff of disdain, "he can puts them on himself, Master Draco. You is sure this is wise?"
He grumbled when Draco nudged him, but he reported what he'd seen in the wards and then did the spell for Silverclaw who snarled and marched right off to take care of the problem. His departure prompted an exodus from the ritual room. Mr. Swashlin scooped Harry up in his arms. To Draco's embarrassment, Grandfather Arcturus carried him out of the ritual room as though he was precious and so very welcome.
Not that he did. Or would. He was way too tired to protest anything other than staying awake.
"Werewolves?" Mrs. Malfoy gasped.
Harry settled into the magic of the wards, of the stone, of the entire Potter family, really. Draco had made it very, very clear that wards built on the family magic as much as they did on the runes. His dad and grandparents and great-grands and all kinds of relatives that he'd never even learned the names of had fed magic into this stone. For generations and generations and generations.
"Whoa, you look terrible," Harry said. He pulled Draco straight to the bed, which had the curtains pulled back and the blankets turned down. "Into bed. Come on. Off with the robe. Slippers, too. You can't put slippers in bed, Draco. Ivy will have conniptions."
"Darling, didn't I say you and Harry shouldn't do anything?" Mother said in a rather too sharp and too frightened tone as she stepped to their couch and knelt to scan Draco.
"I know, that was really scary," Harry agreed in a voice that was… was…
Harry sat up straight, almost dislodging Draco who still didn't wake up.
He almost thought that she could do it. Ginny was ferocious, rather like Charlie who looked as though he wanted to join in the battle. Thankfully, Charlie and Bill had been caught in the same ward circle, while the twins were with Percy who'd firmly collared both of them to keep them from doing anything stupid.
"Ivy," Draco whispered even as he and Harry laughed because Dobby had popped straight to Harry's side once the spell collapsed. "Fake Dumbledore isn't gone. He's still there. Still in Hogwarts. It worked. But he's there."
Amal nodded once before shutting his eyes, lacing his fingers together over his belly and dropping into magical communion.
"We should be pushing for our Heir, should we not, Mother?" Draco said. "We are a cadet branch of the House of Black, after all."
That plus a lunch of sandwiches and crisps had all the adults calmer, if still not thinking especially clearly as far as Harry was concerned. They were all up in arms about what Dumbledore had done. In the past. You know, before now. None of them seemed able to focus on what to do to fix the mess they'd had dropped in their laps.
"Dobby does not want to hurt the Great Harry Potter," Dobby whispered as the tears flowed down his cheeks. "He does not. He wants to save the Great Harry Potter."
"Ah, well…" Remus winced as Harry glowered at him. "This. How can I believe that? You don't understand, Harry. The Wolf is so angry at the blessing. Half of me is snarling at it. The other half is terrified that I'll be no better than Fenrir Greyback once the blessing's influence is gone. I can't…"
It wasn't a voice. There were no words. Draco knew what had been said without hearing the words or seeing a face. It was Magic, pure and simple and so alive that Draco's eyes drifted mostly shut. Harry moaned and swayed, his eyes drooping, too.
He kept walking, whispering "please help us save them all" under his breath. Each step brightened the gravel. After the first turn, Harry dispelled the lumos and put his wand away. After the second, he pushed back the hood of his cloak.
"How d'you know that?" Moody demanded.
Dobby popped Harry straight back to Remus and Amal who scolded him just as Mother seemed to be. Draco didn't truly hear it. The magic thrumming through the wards was too strong. Harry's delight was too loud.
"Dobby is going," Dobby grumbled.
No wizard would willingly remove his wand arm even if he wanted to escape the Dark Mark. Draco shook his head and then put his hand on top of the Mark. He couldn't help but be grateful for the heavy sleeve of Father's robe between Draco and the Mark. Even with that barrier, the thing felt wrong.
Dobby sighed and nodded as his ears drooped. "Yes, Master Harry. They do. Is still traces of ritual."
"Ivy, will you be my elf?" Draco whispered. The words came out a bare sliver of sound. Even with this plan, mad as it was, he was too afraid to speak loudly.
As big as Malfoy Manor's grounds were, they felt way, way, way too small right now.
Let them assume he meant grief. Draco wouldn't mourn his father. There was nothing there to mourn. He might just throw a little party with the Elves once Mother went to sleep.
"The soul anchor is probably keeping you from understanding them anyway," Draco said. Despite his telling Harry to calm down, Draco's eyes never left the work everyone else was doing. It was like he was just barely keeping himself from charging in and bossing everyone around.
Hermione huffed. "Harry!"
Then he'd popped away. Draco had drunk his hot chocolate while sitting on the floor exactly as a Malfoy never, ever did, and the three adults had had a little toast to the entire ordeal being over.
Oh wow. It was a blessing, but one put with a snarl and hate and nothing but meanness behind it. Harry frowned and cupped the warped blessing inside of him. How sad. It wanted to do the right thing, but it couldn't. It wasn't allowed to.
"You probably enjoyed being around Professor Quirrell last year," Draco complained even though he ate his hash quickly and eagerly.
The library was cold. Both in temperature and in the magical feel of it. Draco snorted as Mother headed straight to the section of the library holding their ancient religious texts. When Grandfather Arcturus raised an eyebrow, Draco shook his head.
"Where can they land?" Harry asked.
"Only here," Draco said. He shrugged when Harry stared at him, aghast. "Unless you lower the war wards entirely, which would be idiotic, they'll have to hover here and carefully get out onto the balcony. I don't know what to do about the car, though."
When Harry peeked out the window, barely daring to twitch the curtains open an inch, the sun was high in the sky. It looked like mid-morning, maybe eight which was ridiculous. Aunt Petunia never let Harry sleep this late. Even Dudley got rousted out of bed long about now. Despite that, he didn't hear Aunt Petunia doing anything more than humming downstairs.
"You're quiet," Harry commented.
Draco stumbled backwards, tripped, and landed on his arse.
"We need a way to destroy the heart of his power for good," Draco prayed with all the strength in him.
Mother would probably be delighted to give the Manor some more warmth. Draco would certainly appreciate it.
"I've no intention of going anywhere nearer to them than the door to Father's office," Draco said.
"Prayer for a healthy baby," Harry murmured as he compared the notes on each book. "Whoever the blue book belonged to really wanted that healthy baby. Huh. There's two men's names as the people to do the prayer. Maybe that's related to gay couples having kids together? Is that a thing?"
Harry stared at Grandfather Arcturus, turned to Draco who shrugged because what did Draco have to do with Harry's wards? Harry snorted and then locked the floo down with an authoritative snap that echoed through the room. And perhaps through the entire castle. When Harry strode off, Draco followed. The adults trailed after them.
"Of course not," Professor McGonagall said. She rolled her eyes which Harry stared at. Seriously, he was not used to the idea of Professor McGonagall acting like Lavender Brown. "Croaker. Not a drop of romance in that man's soul. Damn good thing, too, or I wouldn't have put up with him all these years."
Draco studied the prayer the way Harry had, biting his lip as he read over the warnings and instructions. It was ridiculously simple to do the ritual itself, but he could see that arranging things so that no one would know what was going to happen was virtually impossible. The only complicated part of it was that you had to have one person walk the labyrinth while another person worked with wards around the labyrinth to make sure that the wards amplified the prayer and sent it out.
Draco sighed. "I can't believe you know absolutely nothing, Potter."
Draco's heart all but stopped as he flipped to the next prayer. "Oh, my. That's… interesting. A prayer to break an enemy's power over you and all your allies."
About their bond. About how they would come together, grow up, mature in magic and body and life.
Grandfather Arcturus hugged Harry, put a proud hand on Draco's shoulder that took his breath away, and then strode out of the library while calling for his elf Cooper to bring him parchment, ink and a new quill.
"One good thing that I learned from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, then," Harry said. He smiled as Silverclaw took the letter. "Oh, have we heard anything about getting Sirius free?"
Croaker nodded slowly. "Now I understand why you called me, Moody. The boy needs to stay. The doors won't stay open without him here. Keep him safe while we work."
Yeah, no, there was no chance that Harry was sleeping peacefully. Draco was fussy. He'd always been fussy. Mother, whenever Father wasn't around, used to tease him about how picky he'd been as a baby. He'd wanted the right blankie and the perfect toy and exactly the right amount of warm milk before he'd curl up and sleep.
Grandfather Arcturus' eyebrows went up as he studied the display. "That's… unexpected. Perhaps the ritual that freed me from the curse killing me wiped away anything else Dumbledore did to me."
"Little Lord Malfoy and Mistress Pretty is coming with Cooper," Cooper said.
He could feel the magic rising from the Twins. It was the perfect counterpoint to the dark magic rising off the altar at the center of the room. Draco's eyes had started to glow as Harry opened the door. This had to be the heart of darkness, the center of Dumbledore's prayer circle.
"Darling, let the goblins heal him," Mother said from the sidelines.
Harry's head snapped up. He flipped pages and read that prayer with even more attention than he had been the one on making babies. Draco bit his lip as Harry read it once, then twice, and then so slowly on the third time that Draco wasn't sure if he was memorizing it or falling asleep as he read.
He shuffled a little closer to Harry, hands clutched to his chest. They lay there together on the pile of rubble, just breathing as they worked to gather enough energy to get up and out of here. Draco dearly hoped that the others would make their way in here once Dumbledore was properly dead.
His eyes stayed locked on Draco's.
Instead, Harry nodded slowly as if he was reassessing everything about Draco.
"Still working it out in my head," Harry admitted much to Draco and Professor McGonagall's amusement. "Okay, so the underlying spell. It's not a curse. It's not a charm. It's not a potion. It's not any sort of magic that any of you are used to. Dobby and Ivy and the other Elves can see it, but it doesn't feel like a threat to them, other than all the ways that it interacts with the other stuff Dumbledore does."
"Well, maybe you should listen to them," Harry said. He huffed when Remus leveled one of those "seriously?" looks at him that grownups used when they didn't want to listen to a kid. "No, really. You keep getting the same advice from all sorts of different places. Me, Dobby, the werewolf packs. Why not listen to them?"
That was good. He'd hoped that the cloak would keep them safe and it had. But it wasn't enough to keep the two of them safe now. They needed to head into the labyrinth and that meant following the prayer and they couldn't be hidden to do that.
Dobby leaned his forehead against Harry's chest. Both of them were breathing hard. Tears trembled in Harry's eyes.
"This is your favorite couch, isn't it?" Draco asked as he settled onto the green velvet couch near the fireplace in the Potter Library.
"Ivy, can you bring me the ritual book we used?" Draco asked.
"I'm the first Malfoy in three generations to touch the Malfoy wards," Draco said with a tired sigh. "And the first in three generations not to be enslaved by a dark lord. Who we were before Grindelwald and Voldemort is… very different from who my grandfather and father were. I'd agree that Father and Grandfather were actually evil though."
"Dobby?" Draco called just a little louder with a bit more intent.
"But he couldn't be behind it!" Hermione protested with tears blooming in her eyes. "He's a great man!"
And really, Harry had reason to be delighted. Potter Keep was beautiful and warm and homey but it didn't have much in the way of land around it. Cliffs and the loch and wind-swept pines, yes, but not formal gardens and a hedge maze and a Quidditch pitch. Harry pointed at the peacocks, laughing with delight at their grand white plumage.
Dobby preened, tugging at the too-large ruffles over his shoulders and making them stand up even more. "Dobby needed a good apron. Cannot be using something old and ugly for first meal in Master Harry's new castle."
Dumbledore wouldn't be content to hide in the shadows forever.
Draco did pull his wand and heal the cut with a whispered charm. Harry shivered at the feel of Draco's magic working in his body. It was so much more… there… than before. The blessing had been blocking him, keeping him from feeling Draco properly. The poor blessing must've been worked nearly to insanity trying to make things right.
"Told." Harry blinked and then shook his head. "They sent you on an impossible mission, then. I'm sorry. You can't keep me safe. This is my life. I suffer here. Dumbledore jerks me out of this place and plunks me down in Hogwarts where everyone stares, and no one actually tries to get to know me. And, you know, dangerous stuff happens. Or happened. This year might be better."
"Potter!" Draco hissed as his cheeks violently went red.
Just steady breathing, slow and deep. Just Remus tilting his head side to side a couple of times as if he were listening to something very far away. Harry bit his lip, reaching back to take Draco's hand even though he hadn't turned to see Draco offer it. He didn't need to. Draco's need to have his hand held was so clear that Harry did it before he consciously recognized the emotion coming from Draco.
"Is Father unconscious?" Draco asked.
"Did it work?" Harry asked. He grabbed for Grandpa Arcturus' hand. "Is Remus going to be okay?"
Harry huffed and shook his head. "I really don't like Dumbledore anymore. Not at all. Go on and finish dessert, Dobby. We should go get Grandpa Arcturus up, anyway."
"Mr. Potter," Mr. Swashlin said as he set the tea aside without even sipping it. "I am at your disposal. Let me set up a few things and then I'll have you tell me everything. Absolutely everything. Whatever you can tell me will help us make sure that Dumbledore never touches you again."
"Blue is searching the attic and all the hidey-holes," Ivy said with a firm nod. She pushed them both to the armchairs and away from the credenzas. "Master Draco shouldn't be rooting around anyway. And Master Harry should know better than to peek in people's drawers. Is rude."
"You're sure that you want to do this?" Grandfather Arcturus asked far too grimly. "It's two more people who know where you are. They will both learn of you, Draco, and Narcissa. They'll learn that I'm not ill and dying anymore. Every person who learns of this before we're ready to act is a risk. I know you don't want to consider it, Harry, but sometimes you have to make necessary sacrifices to ensure your safety and survival."
Harry wagged a finger at Draco, nodding. "Yeah, she could. She really could even though I don't trust her all the way. I don't want to get her in trouble, but she is the perfect choice. Can we trust her? I mean, we'd have to let her come here. The wards on Black Manor aren't secure enough yet and I don't think we could transport Remus anywhere without him breaking free and grabbing me."
He turned and Moody was there with an Unspeakable behind him. No, with a whole team of Unspeakables in their hoods and bland grey robes. Behind them was a healer who glared and pushed at shoulders to try to get through.
"We… can help with that," Fred said slowly. He grimaced as George rubbed the back of his neck. "But we'll get in an epic amount of trouble with Mum and Dad when they find out about it."
"Probably," Harry agreed. "I mean, seriously, it's probably going to take three quarters of forever, even if we could get Hermione in here and set her loose."
"You do realize that we have to reevaluate everyone now," Draco murmured.
"It's quite a different feel," Draco said. He rubbed his chest. "And quite far from Harry. I'm surprised to feel the distance so acutely."
"Black magic of the worst kind," Moody said. He nodded to Draco. "Keep your grip on the wards, kid. Then open the doors for us."
"Dumbledore wouldn't want you to learn anything that might let you escape from his control," Draco said slowly, frowning at the book in Grandpa Arcturus' hand even though his eyes were so unfocused that he couldn't be seeing it. "Because he wants you to die for his cause, whatever that is."
"Thank you, Dobby," Harry said, grinning. He offered a fist which Dobby proudly bumped before popping away.
"Master Draco should be sleeping," Ivy said. She glowered at Draco as she passed him a mug full of warm milk with cinnamon. "Tomorrow is being coming soon. Master Draco needs to be strong for his soul mate."
As long as Lord Black survived. And liked Harry enough to be his guardian until he was sixteen. Or at least tolerated Harry until then.
"Lovely," Remus sighed. "Right. Well, I'll go have the elves make some food. Merlin knows Lily wouldn't stop until her stomach started screaming at her."
Draco grinned at him. "Touch it with one finger, Potter. Think about it being in English. For Merlin's sake, you're the Patriarch. They answer to you. Though yes, you absolutely do need to learn runes. Both ancient and modern. They're terribly useful."
"Mother," Draco said and then stopped, appalled. "Oh, Merlin, you've got to change your clothes!"
"I'm sorry that notice hasn't gotten here yet," Draco said. "I'm afraid that Father died yesterday morning due to… health issues related to the last war. The family magic chose me as Lord, though of course, Mother is my regent until I reach my majority."
"That is what we were afraid of," Draco agreed. "We're somewhat trapped here now."
This might be exactly what Fake Dumbledore had wanted to destroy.
"Um, maybe?" Harry said, biting his lip as he fumbled with his magic and his link to the Black Manor wards. "Grandpa Arcturus did introduce me to them as his heir, or, you know, his heir's heir. They might let me do whatever I want."
Then they'd been treated to a truly marvelous example of Gobbledygook swearing as Silverclaw cursed Voldemort in every way imaginable. He'd expanded out to include Dumbledore for not taking care to check the scar for soul anchors and then the Ministry for being, essentially, the Ministry.
Draco raised his chin as Harry's eyes widened. Of course, he would hear that. The idiot Gryffindor would hear and do the most inconvenient things.
The wards laughed at that. It wasn't a sound or any words or anything but yeah, that shimmer in the magic surrounding Harry was absolutely amused. He grinned, shrugged, and then reached out to Dobby.
"What can Dobby do for Master Harry?" Dobby asked.
Except that he was very, very glad that he didn't have to go somewhere else to get Voldemort out of his scar. Potter Keep felt like home. It felt more like home than anywhere else that he'd ever been. It was the home that he used to dream of having back when Uncle Vernon bellowed at him, punched him, and then locked him in the cupboard.
"Okay, good point," Harry said. "So Vern goes, tells Professor McGonagall that Remus has been horribly cursed, that the curses are anchoring on his lycanthropy and the only way to save him is to transfigure him into something inanimate until the curses can be removed."
"I… have no idea," Draco said, blinking several times. "Ivy!"
There were no runes at all on the stone though they were carved all over the floor, walls and ceiling of the room. Weird that the stone had no runes at all. He could feel Silverclaw's magic on the ward stone. Draco had said that his ward stone was granite, a big chunk that'd been inscribed with runes. Potter Keep had a whacking huge chunk of obsidian that had been carefully knapped until it was shaped like an oversized stone knife. It stood as tall as Harry.
"I completely agree with him," Draco said. "Harry needs to sleep and eat and be tucked in nice and warm, too. Go on and tell him I'll get Mother and have her tuck him in if he doesn't go to bed instead of fretting."
Bloody hell, he was going to have to take a wife. The family magic already pressed on him to provide an heir or four or five, even though he was far too young for that sort of thing. The thought of kissing a girl, having sex with a girl, made Draco shudder.
There was a wash of amusement that startled Harry. It came right from the stone, its magic, which gentled and wrapped around Harry. It was a soft blanket, fleecy and warm and as lovely as the old blue blanket he used to have when he was tiny, the one that Aunt Petunia had thrown out when he turned six.
Father was losing control. He actually was! The Malfoy magic was pulling away from him, seeking for someone strong enough to lay claim to it. Mother couldn't do it, not even as his regent, not after Father had beaten, potioned and cursed her.
He followed Dobby into Blackwell House, doing his best not to ogle the late Victorian elevator with its gold-painted open metal grill work or the beautiful ironwork on the stair railing leading up to the next level. They took the elevator, which had big round buttons set high on the side of the elevator and a sliding grate for a door, all the way up to the fifth floor.
"It's what he did," Harry said with a jerky, furious gesture towards the door out of the library. "Dumbledore sent Remus here to die. To be killed. By us. To test us all. And no. Just no. I won't play his game. Remus deserves to live no matter what's going on. So we have the elves contact Professor McGonagall to see if she'll come rescue Remus."
He marched off down the stairs, pretending not to hear Remus asking Professor McGonagall if Harry ever stopped to breathe for more than a few seconds at a time.
Oh, no.
Ginny stood half behind Bill who smiled sadly at Hermione as Draco served tea and pushed it into her hands. Ron had flopped onto one of the other sofas. He already had a sandwich in his hands. The twins leaned against each other over near the entrance to the room with the big windows, firmly distancing themselves from their siblings as if they didn't want to be caught in the blast radius when Harry, or maybe Draco, went off.
"You know, I haven't been outside since we went up on the battlements," Harry commented. "Maybe we can go out in your gardens or something?"
The healer finally shoved his way past the Unspeakables, glaring at Croaker as he passed. Draco told him what to look for even though Mother tried to hush Draco and then sat blushing furiously as Draco ignored her and told the Healer just what he was looking at.
Draco nodded. "Get rid of my blood. And get me to my bedroom. This… people will have noticed. And make sure that Mother knows that the wards have locked down several… very dark artifacts."
"That looked like first, second and only to me," Draco said with a little grin.
"So," Harry said as he leaned against Draco and cradled his mug of hot chocolate, "from what everyone can tell so far, there's a base behavioral modification spell that makes everyone very susceptible to what Dumbledore wants. It doesn't really tell them to do anything. They just look at him and think he's all amazing and wonderful and wise and all that."
For now.
Draco had to hand it to Harry. That was a remarkable uniform. He might have to see what he could do for his elves, though he would never let them use a print like that monstrosity.
He flung the curtains open, letting sunlight flood into the sitting room. The man pretending to be Lord Black shook his head and then pushed the blanket off his legs. That man was fully dressed, if in casual slacks and a simple button-down shirt with no robe whatsoever. As soon as the bearskin was off him, his skin went warm brown and his hair turned into a black mop of curls that would've done Harry Potter proud.
He shut his eyes, bowed his head, and went totally still. Draco held his breath as he waited for Harry to ask Dobby whatever it was. Probably a simple question about what Dobby thought might work. Draco was tempted to do the same with Ivy but frankly, Dobby was worlds more creative than Ivy would ever be.
Mother put a hand over her mouth though it did nothing whatsoever to hide her laughter. It did shield her teeth so that she wouldn't offend Silverclaw by displaying fangs at him. Silverclaw's lips curled in a tight but wide smile.
"Um." Harry stared at Silverclaw, then at Amal who looked sad for some stupid reason. "Right. Well, the other thing we need to do is get my heir rings. The Potter and the Black ones. And, you know, any others I might have that Dumbledore didn't bother to tell me about. But especially the Black and Potter ones. You know, the ones where I'm, actually, an heir?"
"Where have you been, Darling?" Mother asked. "I looked everywhere."
"I know, I know, but can you tell Remus what you told us about the whole not quite a werewolf thing," Harry said. "I think Remus needs to hear it straight from you."
Dumbledore would not win. No matter what it took, they would stop Dumbledore and free everyone.
The view off the ramparts across Harry's loch was gorgeous.
Draco couldn't harm himself. He wouldn't. There was too much torture in this house for Draco to inflict it on himself, much as he wanted to sometimes to make the internal pain visible for once.
"The only bit of Dumbledore's magic that's touched you is the blessing, Grandfather," Draco said. "Mother and I both have quite a bit more. You're nearly pure, nearly untouched by his manipulation."
"Can you… choose… who to serve?" Harry asked as his stomach clenched in knots around the horrible cheese sandwich dinner he'd been given. Or was that nerves?
"Mmm, about four or five minutes," Harry said. "And yeah, I didn't do a thing. That was all Draco. Just like I was the one that freed myself. That might be a key."
"We'd need teams," Hermione murmured. "At least two teams, maybe three. I mean, where are we going to get a rival circle? And how do we get two sets of twin focals?"
"I have no idea, Potter," Draco said, wheezing just as badly as Harry.
Draco's heart lurched. All right. They were here. It should give them what they needed, if Tippy was telling the truth. Draco would simply have to trust that Tippy wanted to be free as much as Draco and Harry did.
"Darling!" Mrs. Malfoy exclaimed.
Draco poured his magic into those rune circles, strengthening them. The runes brightened, filling out as Draco felt out their contours and intent.
"Dobby?" Harry asked. He put just a little bit of power into the bond that pulsed happily between them.
Even the bed sagged and leaned the way it had before.
Harry stood in the middle of Potter Keep's smaller circular tower and stared up. His mouth dropped open further as he looked up and up and up. The walls had bookshelves. So many bookshelves. They went up not just the five stories you could see outside, but twelve or thirteen, maybe fourteen stories inside.
"We need to talk to Amal," Draco said. "And you need to describe this in much more detail."
He wouldn't stop. He wouldn't give in. This was too important. They had to stop Fake Dumbles. They had to save everyone. Draco was waiting for Harry. He wouldn't fail Draco, no matter how hard it was to drag a foot up, push it forwards, set it down and then drag the other foot up.
Draco sucked in a breath, wondering if it would ever get easier to say this, especially with Mother's breath hitching and her hand clamped down like a vice on his hand. "I'm sorry that we didn't get notice to you sooner, sir. My father died yesterday morning due to… well, complications from the last war. We spent the day dealing with the Ministry. There were. Hm. Artifacts that needed to be removed and the wards needed to be updated."
He offered Dobby a fist that Dobby enthusiastically bumped before popping back out. To Draco's surprise, Mother and Grandfather Arcturus both looked as if they thought it was a stupid idea. Even Amal looked horribly discouraged.
That woke Draco up. It also pulled Mrs. Malfoy and Grandpa Arcturus from the other end of the hallway, all of them frowning at Harry as he jumped up and pointed at Remus. It startled Remus enough that he held his hands up as if to ward Harry off.
Neither of them said anything. There'd been a couple of sidelong looks at dinner when Harry kept asking questions that derailed the grownups into explanations and arguments and debates. But what Harry got through the bond to Dobby was that he knew it was important.
"Remus is doing what?" Amal asked. He came over to stare at the ward diagnostic thing. "Oh-kay. Huh. Did not expect that. He was one of your parent's best friends. More your mom's friend than your dad's. Sirius was your dad's very best friend. Remus and your mom were… huh, study buddies and pranksters together? Not sure how many people knew that, but they got away with some amazing stuff."
Silverclaw tucked the letter away into his jacket's inside pocket. It had to be a magically enlarged pocket because the letter was easily three times the size of the pocket's opening. He sighed and pursed his lips, tapping his claws together thoughtfully.
So yes, he was fine. It was fine. Everything was fine.
"Okay, Grandpa Arcturus," Harry said and then smiled as Grandpa Arcturus lifted an arm for Harry to hug him around the waist, which of course he did. "What are we gonna do? Draco's sleeping, which wow, he really needs. But, I mean, if Sirius is up to something with Croaker, should we help? Or stay put? Get the Wizengamot up in arms? What do we do?"
He slipped out of the library and left them to their research. It wasn't the real reason that they'd left Potter Keep, of course. Grandfather needed to put pressure on the DMLE to get Sirius free. Mother intended to help in Draco's name. Getting some research done before their morning meeting was simply wise. There were books here that didn't exist in Potter Keep or anywhere else, hopefully. It was quite possible that Father had destroyed the books in a fit after the Dark Lord punished him for not being sufficiently devoted.
"I'm ready," Harry said as he stepped into the inner circle. "Let's get this taken care of."
You found my home for me.
The moment Harry shut his eyes and paid the slightest bit of attention to the bond, Draco's desperate fear and worry rushed into Harry. He was outright terrified of how Professor McGonagall was going to react to him. To Mrs. Malfoy. To their bond. To his father's death which was a dark and nasty painful thing in the back of Draco's mind that Harry really didn't think he had the right to poke at.
"Can take bad Dumbles curses off if Wolfy-man is not person anymore," Dobby exclaimed. "Would be like cleaning. Elves is good at cleaning bad magic off things. Not off people unless are family."
Harry grinned. "I adore him. He's awesome. Either way, Remus, that's what you've got to do. It's your path to freedom. Both for you and your wolf. You have to accept each other. If you do, then you'll be free and you can be family and we can go to Malfoy Manor where Dumbledore's completely, utterly, totally blocked from getting at us."
"Dumbledore specifically picked someone who was dear to my parents," Harry continued. "Remus means nothing at all to me but he does to Amal and he did to my parents. This wasn't a test of me. It was a test of whoever's with me."
Harry laughed. He leaned against Draco and put his head on Draco's shoulder. It was the most natural thing in the world to put his arm around Harry's back, to tug him closer so that they supported one another.
"Miss Grant, this class is
Harry and Hermione nodded back at him, while Ron looked as conflicted as Draco felt.
Draco and Ron were quick to follow after him and almost slipped in the water that coated the floor a couple of halls down. As they slipped and stumbled forward, they soon came across the source of whatever Harry was following...
"A picture?" Harry asked, dumbstruck.
. Ugh, girls...
The twins suddenly straightened up behind her. "You were in Knockturn Alley?" they asked Harry, grinning wildly.
"Think it's funny, eh?" Lockhart said, still smiling. "Well, let's see you take them on then!" and with a dramatic flourish, he pulled open the cage.
Lockhart waved his wand, and a few moments later a few sheets of paper landed in front of each student. Draco picked up the one on top and glanced at it as he fished his quill and ink out of his bag. He glanced away for a moment, then snapped back to the paper, certain he had read it wrong because there was
"He's said he's done..." Muttered Ron as he made another grab for the pixies.
That tiny voice in the back of his head said.
"Shut up," hissed Harry, his eyes darting towards Lockhart at the front of the room.
was interesting."
Theodore Nott pushed his way to the front of the crowd, and grinned up at the wall. In his ridiculously nasally voice, he said, "Enemies of the heir beware! That means you'll be next, mudb-" he was unable to finish his sentence, as he was practically shoved over by Percy Weasley as he rushed to the wall, McGonagall, Snape, and Dumbledore hot on his heels.
Lucius nodded and pulled a list on parchment out of his robes. While Lucius and Borgin talked business, Draco wandered the shop. He saw a shriveled old hand, holding an unlit candle, and a beautiful sapphire necklace with a plaque that read;
Painted on the walls, in capital letters and what seemed to be blood, read:
"Tell me what happened," he said in a quiet voice.
Relieved, the four of them thanked their Professors, and scrambled out of the office and up the stairs towards Gryffindor tower. It's just a shame that a lot of other students didn't see things the same way that McGonagall and Dumbledore did.
Mrs. Weasley turned to Hagrid and Draco. "He's lucky you two found him. Knockturn Alley, I swear!"
Granted, that someone was Hermione, but she managed to get the entire classes' attention. Binns mumbled on for another two minutes before he turned and noticed her hand straight in the air, and the entire class staring at her in silent shock and awe. He frowned, and gestured at her "Yes, Miss Grant?"
"Well, well..." Lucius whispered, gathering the attention of the Weasley's and Harry. "You must be the famous Harry Potter. Draco has told me
years he'd been teaching, he had never seen a class so attentive. Every single student was staring at him, waiting for him to give an answer. Binns floated there for a moment, looking somewhat conflicted, before tightening his mouth into a thin line and frowning out at the Gryffindors.
Draco Malfoy is somewhat used to being around people with an ego, but he's fairly certain not even his father can match up to Gilderoy Lockhart in terms of self-satisfaction. Tensions seem to be higher than ever and between classes and back-stabbing Slytherins, things aren't really looking up any time soon.
She ushered them into her office, and they stood nervously, as she leaned forward and fixed all of them with a cold stare. Draco was fairly certain that if looks could kill, all four of them would have fallen dead on the spot. He swallowed hard, and quickly turned his gaze to his feet, rather than look up at the professor, who was leaning onto her desk, silent. A few moments later, Dumbledore stepped into the office as well, looking far more grim than Draco had ever seen him. Dumbledore stepped up next to McGonagall's desk and fixed them all with an impenetrable stare.
Miss Grant?"
Draco likes to think he's afraid of very little. Maybe it's just a Gryffindor thing, but he's always considered himself to be fairly fearless. He's starting to think that maybe it's just him; the chamber opens and suddenly Draco is facing a situation within which he is completely safe, while his peers and friends find themselves in more trouble than he could ever imagine.
A soft bell rang through the shop as Lucius Malfoy pushed the door open, Draco trailing just behind him. While Draco had been to Nocturne Alley with his father before, it always made him a little uncomfortable; something about the atmosphere and lingering dark magic that accompanied the shopping district. Borgin and Burke's was empty, aside from a withered old man with small, black eyes standing behind the counter. He glanced up from the old glass he was polishing and grinned. Draco noticed that he was missing most of his teeth.
"Shove off, Theo." Harry hissed, his face turning red.
"Well..." Draco said, breaking the silence, "
"Of course you did, Lockhart never shuts up, remember?" Harry smiled a little at that, and Ron barked out a laugh, easing the tension further.
my son keeps." Lucius hissed, his eyes darting towards Hermione's parents who were standing awkwardly to the side.
"Perhaps I merely wanted to see the...
Lucius sighed, then nodded and headed out. Borgin headed into a back room with the list, muttering quietly to himself. Draco was about to open the cabinet when it suddenly slammed open. Draco cried out, and stumbled back and falling. To his shock and surprise, Harry stepped out of the cabinet, covered in soot and clutching broken glasses. He looked down at Draco, who looked back up at him incredulously.
After about ten minutes, Lockhart collected the quizzes, then tutted aloud as he began to berate the class for answering most of the (ridiculous) questions wrong. He was flipping through and noticed that Hermione seemed to have gotten every single one right. Draco was grateful for it, as it earned Gryffindor ten points, but he resisted the urge to roll his eyes; of
"What were you doing in there?" Draco asked, gaping.
As she began bickering with the twins, Hagrid clapped Harry and Draco on the back and headed towards the Leaky Cauldron. Harry and Draco headed up the street where they could see Ron and Hermione waiting. After joining up with them, they headed into the Apothecary and got potion ingredients, then wandered a bit (the boys stopped to look at racing brooms, where the Nimbus 2001 was sitting in the window) and eventually came up to Flourish and Blotts. They were surprised that, when they stepped in, the bookstore was packed full of people. Draco stood up on his toes, looking for his father among the crowd, and then fell back down with no luck. After a moment, it became apparent why it was so full in here; a handsome wizard stepped up in front of the crowd, grinning out at the crowd.
"Oh! Uh, hi Harry... My name's Collin." the boy said, shifting slightly on his feet. "I was wondering if I could maybe get a picture?"
Draco grinned up at Harry from where he was lounging on his bed as they walked in. Neville looked up from his book and smiled as they headed towards their own beds, Seamus and Dean just behind them.
"Buyin' flesh-eatin' slug repellent," Hagrid grunted. "Their eatin' the cabbages. And what was
muggleborn
"'Arry! Draco! What are ye two doin' down 'ere?!"
"It's coming from over there!" Harry said, taking a step forward. All the blood suddenly drained from his face as he turned and sprinted around the corner, shouting over his shoulder, "it's going to kill someone!"
Dumbledore chuckles a little, and gazes out kindly at the quartet. "Mischief makers though you four may sometimes be, I don't believe you've ever been trouble. Perhaps you should head back to the common room for the night?"
That really got their attention. Everyone in the room fully sat up and looked at Professor Binns. From his expression alone, it was clear that in the many
"Absolutely wicked," Draco said, and the other boys looked at him. "Completely inspired."
"It's not my fault!" Ron said indignantly.
And chaos quickly ensued. At least 5 of them smashed the windows and headed out towards freedom, covering the back row in shattered glass. Two more had grabbed Neville by the ears and were lifting him into the air. The rest rocketed around the classroom, and most of the Gryffindors quickly headed towards the door as Lockhart dived under his desk just as the chandelier Neville was hanging from gave way, sending him crashing to the floor. Neville staggered up and sprinted out the door, with Lockhart close behind. As he stopped byt he door, he turned to the four of them and said, "well, I'll just leave you lot to take of them! I'm sure you can do it." And with that, Lockhart was gone.
Hanging, stiff and lifeless, beside the words was the caretaker's bad tempered cat, Mrs. Norris. Draco felt his breath catch in his throat as he read the message again, and again. This couldn't really be happening... There was no way.
As Harry stumbled back over to them, a collection of Lockhart's books in his hands (which he gave to Ginny), Draco felt a familiar hand rest on his shoulder.
Hermione stopped a few of them with a freezing spell, while Ron and Harry jumped up trying to catch one. Draco managed to snatch a few out of the air, which Hermione then froze, and stuffed them into the cage.
"I simply told my son I would meet him here when we finished our respective errands. Is that such a crime, Weasley?" Lucius responded, his voice and gaze cold.
"We were going to meet Harry after his detention with Professor Lockhart, sir." Ron said quietly. "We just..." he trailed off here, and Draco was fairly certain he saw some blood drain from Harry's face.
"I suppose..." Binns murmured, then sighed and laid the chalk down, turning to fully face the class. "The Chamber of Secrets is a legend as old as Hogwarts itself," he began. "The story was born from the split of Salazar Slytherin and the rest of the founders.
have you outlined all his lessons in hearts?"
"We have Defense Against the Dark Arts next..." Ron mumbled, then said, "and
After the class had settled in, Lockhart turned and grinned at all of them, before picking a book off the top of his stack. "Welcome, students, to the best class you'll have all year!" Lockhart smiled widely at the class, and Draco heard Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown giggle from the back of the class. "Now, I'm going to start you off with a simple quiz. So long as you've all read the books, there's no reason you shouldn't pass with flying colors!"
still some things he hadn't quite grappled with. The idea that muggles weren't a problem, weren't a genuine threat anymore. The fact that being Pureblood really didn't matter nearly as much as he thought it did.
Draco opened the door, and he and Harry stepped out onto the dark street. They kept their heads down and headed up the street. They were rounding a corner, when...
That did it. Arthur threw Ginny's cauldron and books aside and lept at Lucius as Draco jumped to the side, mildly horrified. They scrapped for a moment before Hagrid parted the crowd and pulled them apart.

As they headed up the street, Mrs. Weasley came bustling over, looking very worried.

"Yes! Everyone's told me loads about you, and I'm sending pictures home to my dad. I thought it would be really cool if I had one of you! Maybe you could even sign it?" Collin said, speaking so fast he ran out of breath.
pictures? Potter's giving out signed pictures?" a reedy and nasally voice said from the other end of the courtyard. Draco and the others turned to look and saw Theodore Nott walking towards them, Crabbe and Goyle at his heels. Draco felt a familiar knot of anger coil in his chest; they used to be
it was Hermione that got them all right.
But the worst thing wasn't even that he was being associated with the writing on the wall, it was that they had reason to believe it. He had done almost nothing, aside from being sorted into a house other than Slytherin, to dispel the mutterings. People still believed that, even if he hadn't directly shown it, he was just as prejudiced as his parents. Never mind the fact that he hung around a muggle born and a Weasley. It seemed that people were just waiting for him to slip up, waiting for him to reveal that uglier side. And though Draco had learned quite a lot about himself, and his points of view had since greatly changed, there
To say the tension in the hall could be cut with a knife was a massive understatement. Draco Malfoy and Ron Weasley stood outside Lockhart's classroom, waiting for Harry to get out of detention so they could walk with him back to the common room. Normally Hermione would have been there to provide a barrier, but she had insisted on staying behind and studying. Both Ron and Draco were fairly certain she just wanted to reread Lockhart's books and
McGonagall looked shocked at the suggestion. "Of course not. Dumbledore and I highly doubt you four had anything to do with this. Despite your record for... mischief in the past, this goes far beyond anything you've lost points for in the past." She smiles a little, and adjusts her glasses. "Beyond that, I like to think better of my students."
Hermione and Ron muttered their agreement, and Hermione put her book back in her bag. She was reaching for her schedule when Ron noticed something peculiar and snatched it up before she could do anything.
Speaking of which... That was something that Draco had noticed lately. Where he'd seen Ginny awkwardly avoid Harry with a scarlet face, and Ron occasionally staring at Lavender Brown ("I was staring into space, not at
"Of course, of course!" Borgin simpered. "Selling today, then?"
As more students filed in, Draco leaned back in his chair and whispered to Harry; "Are you alright? Your face is still really red."
friends, not Theo's.
"I know, but-" Harry suddenly stopped in his tracks, eyes wide. "Did you guys hear that? That's the voice!"
"We stumbled upon it while we were heading towards the Great Hall," Draco finished, and he thought he saw Harry's shoulders relax a bit.
"Percy, get the other prefects together and have them bring their houses back to their common rooms immediately. Snape, stay here and keep anyone front interfering. McGonagall-"
Draco was sitting behind Harry by the window in History of Magic, very nearly put to sleep by Professor Binns usual droning. He wasn't even certain what this lesson was on... or any other lesson this year, now that he considered it. His mind was somewhere between pumpkin pasties and, oddly enough, Dobby, when something happened that no one in the class had ever seen before;
much about you."
"I do not!" Mrs. Weasley hissed, swatting him lightly on the shoulder and making the twins and Draco snigger.
He stopped, staring open mouthed at the three Gryffindors as Hermione also pushed her way to the front of the crowd, glancing in horror between the writing on the wall, and her three friends. Dumbledore stepped forward, a grim look on his face, before turning to the other three.
"Gilderoy Lockhart." One of the twins, Fred, said behind him.
"I suppose not. Doesn't explain why you're bothering to speak to me, though." Mr. Weasley responded.
Draco wasn't surprised by the lackluster response; he knew things would be tense after the incident in Diagon Alley. With a little more chatter, the boys crawled into bed for the night, and Draco put the lights out.
"I know," she said, her lips as thin as Draco had ever seen then. "With me, all four of you." She said, shooting a meaningful look at Hermione as she led them away from the writing on the wall and to her office. The quartet trailed after her, and Draco was certain that his heart was going to beat right out of his chest.
As he was being steered back onto Diagon Alley, Draco looked over his shoulder and said in a quiet voice to Ron, Harry, and Hermione "I'll see you at school."
!"), and of course Hermione's infatuation with the handsome Lockhart, Draco had noticed that he didn't seem to exhibit any of the same behaviors. That wasn't to say he wasn't attracted to anyone... Hermione was right, Lockhart was really handsome, and had Blaise Zabini always been that pretty...?
Someone raised their hand.
Lockhart whipped the cloth off the cage to reveal... "Cornish pixies!"
"Good lord is that... Harry Potter?" he asked loudly. He quickly dashed down, almost knocking Draco over in the process, and dragged poor Harry onto the platform with him, shaking his hand for the camera.
Just as Theo was about to open his mouth to say something else, another voice sounded from the stairs leading up from the grounds. "What's this I hear about a signed picture?"
"Well, we all make mistakes." Hermione said, freezing another pixie. "And look at the things he's done!"
Ron and Draco exchanged a look. "There shouldn't have been anyone but you and Lockhart in that room, Harry," Ron pointed out.
"Alrigh' gents, break 'er up," he said as he pulled them apart and set them down.
Draco's thoughts were no longer on mundane topics like food and house elves. Instead, his mind had drifted to the Chamber, and it's purpose. Did people really think he wanted to remove muggleborns from the school...?
The next day, after receiving their schedules at breakfast and rather difficult Herbology and Transfiguration lessons, the four were sitting in the courtyard beneath an overcast sky. Hermione had her head buried in one of Lockhart's books, and Harry, Ron, and Draco were talking about Quidditch. Draco had just gotten started on a tactic he had noticed at a game this summer, when Harry suddenly broke away from the conversation, looking up at a shadow in the corner. The shadow shifted into the daylight and revealed itself to be a first-year Gryffindor, clutching a muggle camera.
I'm back, specifically to piss on JK Rowling's grave (who may still be alive but is dead to me) because after everything we deserve ACTUAL LGBTQ+ representation in the Harry Potter books, and as a queer woman who struggled with her own sexuality during grade school, I am determined to see it through. And pile on as many parallels to the Marauders as possible because that's what you guys seem to like. This is a shorter chapter, just to get back into the swing of things.
"What is it that you want, Malfoy?" Arthur asked, trying to keep the malice out of his voice.
Hermione, face bright red, seized her schedule from Ron and stomped up the stairs, while the others followed her. They climbed up through the castle, past crowds of students until they reached Lockhart's room. Harry was already there, waiting, his face still beet red. Ron and Hermione took seats on either side of him, while Draco sat just in front of them with Neville. The room was decorated with ornate paintings and furniture, and a stack of Lockhart's books sat on his desk, while a large portrait of him beamed at them all from the wall behind it. Standing just in front of his desk, and grinning just like his portrait, was Lockhart.
They swarmed around, jabbering with high pitched voices, and rattling the cage. They were bright blue, and maybe 4 inches tall with little dragonfly wings. Immediately, Seamus and Dean burst into laughter in the front row, and Neville straightened up as Draco tried to hold in his own laughter. The Pixies were annoying maybe, but they weren't vicious by any means, and Draco was pretty sure they couldn't smell fear.
"I thought I heard someone talking in detention..." Harry muttered, and Draco couldn't help but smirk.
They turned back to the front, where Lockhart was talking and gesturing animatedly. Ron rolled his eyes and pushed through the crowd, accidentally stepping on the photographer's foot as he did so.
Just as he was certain that voice was about to come back full force, Lockhart grabbed the classes attention at the front of the room. Sitting on his desk was a large cage, covered with a large cloth. Lockhart looked out with a very serious expression. "Now, it is my job to teach you all how to protect yourself from the vicious creatures that reside out in this large world of ours. I ask now that you try not to scream and remember..." he looked around the room and Draco noted that Neville was cowering in his seat next to him, "they can smell fear."
"Why, Master Malfoy!" Borgin said, his eyes tracking Lucius as he headed toward the counter. "What do I owe the pleasure for a visit from your esteemed-"
"Oh, Harry! I was so worried!" she fussed, using her wand to remove the rest of the soot and fix his glasses.
"Knockturn Alley; looks like you had a bad run-in with Floo powder," Draco responded, brushing himself off. "C'mon, I'll lead the way back."
"Well, yes, but that's not a problem," Draco said. He waved away Harry's frown, very aware that the adults were staring at the two of them with amusement. "Did you steal Dobby? I know he's gone, but I wasn't sure if it was you or not."
"I can't… let anyone know… that I did this on purpose," Draco panted once the magic calmed to the point where he wasn't blazing with light anymore.
"No, you have a soul anchor in your head," Draco said. "Not the same thing. It's a link back to the Dark Lord, not the Dark Lord himself. And trust me," Draco smiled such a broken, trembling smile that Harry found himself calming down despite the fear hammering away at his heart, "I know the difference between the two. I spent most of a day holding the Malfoy wards around the Dark Lord's shade."
"Polyjuice?" Draco asked. He clung to Harry, desperately afraid but not willing to show it any more than he already was.
They zoomed onwards up the long, straight tunnel until they reached the other end. Then it was climbing stairs up to the third floor and carefully peeking out from behind the hunchbacked statue of Gunhilda de Gorsemoor.
"No, you are not sending my almost bride against Dumbledore, Potter," Draco said over the sound of the men choking. Both Mother and Professor McGonagall snickered. "Her mother maybe, but not Pansy."
"My point," Draco agreed.
Harry sighed, shaking his head as he continued writing slowly and carefully. "Dumbledore."
"Me either," Draco whispered. "I feel her. She's sending the message to the other teams to attack the wards. I… believe she's got Remus going through the Shrieking Shack tunnel now."
"Come to think of it, why hasn't she been up to yell at me already? It's the middle of the morning."
Ivy nodded urgently. "Little Master is. Little Master is strong enough and mature enough. Just barely. Just barely!"
"Who?" Remus called without peeking around the corner.
"That's," Remus paused, swallowing down whatever it was he was going to say. His eyes flared gold, though, and his fingers went claw-like with actual claws growing on his fingertips.
Rich and delicious, not overpowered with either onion or garlic. The peppers added a bit of bite that worked wonderful with the sweetness of the onion and the pungency of the garlic. The sausage filled out the hash and the potatoes bound it all together into something gloriously unlike anything Draco had ever eaten before.
Breathing slowly and deliberately didn't slow the worries rampaging through Draco's mind. There were so many things that could go wrong. Harry could be horribly hurt. He could die. The Goblins might betray him. Dumbledore might attack Potter Keep. Worse, the Dark Lord could escape the Ministry and come after them both.
That made sense.
"Oh, trust me, Potter," Draco drawled as he plopped down shaking next to Harry, "you're washing that face so thoroughly. That's just nasty."
"It was centered in your forehead," Draco said. "I think in your scar. It felt… It felt exactly like the soul anchor my Father had in his library, just quiet instead of alive and vicious and attacking. It felt like the Dark Lord. There's something very wrong with that scar, Potter."
"Oh, was it the "should have smothered you when you were born" or the "you're a freak from a line of freaks that should all be killed on sight"?" Harry asked.
"Maudlin?" Harry asked while snickering. "Really?"
"Right," Harry said. He sighed and sat up, groaning at how tired he was. "Food, too. I'm starving."
Draco nodded. "And perhaps a look out a window as we pass. Just to be sure we're not doing this on our own. We really need the aurors and everyone fighting Dumbledore to get down to the ward room safely."
It had been long enough that soul bonds had been gone that Draco didn't now a thing about them.
Ron didn't get to say another word because Harry was suddenly in front of Draco, his arm finishing a swing. No, a punch. That knocked Ron on his arse and left him spluttering and staring up at Harry as he pressed a hand to the bright red fist print on his cheek.
"I don't know, and I don't think I want to know," Draco said. He tugged at Harry's hand. "Come on. We'll let the adults deal with it. We're too young and much too untrained to do anything with that problem."
Every flicker matched with a spike of pain in Draco's head.
"What is that thing?" Draco gasped as he carefully approached the window to stare as the blue automobile flew by well outside the wards.
Harry crept across the hall to the bathroom, washing up as quickly and as quietly as possible. Even with Dobby's reassurances that he was safe, Harry didn't want to take chances. By the time he'd cleaned up, brushed his teeth, and attempted to wrangle his hair into something less than a rat's nest, Dobby had the bedroom stripped of everything that said Harry.
"Your… uniform," Harry said as he tried not to laugh out loud because as awesome as Dobby's uniform was, the fabric it was made from was a hoot. "You made it out of a flowered sheet. Aunt Petunia's best guest sheets, the ones with the yellow cabbage roses and stupid banana leaves. You used Aunt Petunia's best sheets!"
Draco, he needed Draco. They belonged together. The wards couldn't keep Draco, not when Harry needed him. Harry wasn't going to let go of Draco.
"Nope," Harry said. "I mean, if I can get some money from the bank, I know Dobby and I could go stay in a hotel in Muggle London, but I'd really rather have a place that's warded and secure and, even better, unplottable. Hermione found out about unplottable locations last year and spent a whole week studying how they're made unplottable. I… kind of listened? I mean, I don't want to make them. I just want to have one."
The wards, the normal wards sang with the wild magic Harry had raised. Draco could almost see Harry as he walked up the final straight away into the heart of the labyrinth. It was time.
"Heh, wind flowing through my hair," Amal said with a huge grin. "It's different for everyone. You just… meditate on your magic, let it well up in and around you. The magic finds the blocks and breaks them."
"Of course I want them," Harry said, pitching his voice low so that Uncle Vernon wouldn't hear him and letting it come out as hurt as he felt. "They're everything. It's my birthday, Dobby. All I've gotten all day is abuse and scorn. To get to hold even one of those would be… It would be such a gift. But I don't get that, do I? I guess that's to be expected. I mean, you're just one more person to hurt me in a long line of horrible, abusive people. Another terrible thing happening on another horrible birthday."
"Or not helping you last year was," Draco said. "I don't know which. Mother will look into it. She can work with Mr. Swashlin and Grandfather Arcturus on it while we sleep."
And yet he did.
It hurt.
By the time they got down to the floo room, Remus Lupin was pacing back and forth while snarling at the empty room. Harry studied him as he slowly approached the doorway with it's glowing wall holding Remus in.
"The light of Hope…"
"She… she never believed me or tried to help me," Harry admitted when Draco frowned at him. "So much stuff happened last year, and she just never, ever listened to me. I asked for help. Like, a dozen times. She ignored me. She ignored Hermione and Ron. It was…"
"No, you next," Draco snapped at him. "You're not part of the matrix as belonging here. Go! Harry, go with him."
"It might not work." Draco seemed grimly certain that it wouldn't.
"I think it did," Draco said in a surprisingly steady voice for how hard he was shaking.
"Grant us aid that we might save our friends, allies and even our enemy's forces from the warped blessing at their cores," Harry recited as he walked up the towering black corridor. "Grant us aid that we might save our friends, allies and even our enemy's forces from the warped blessing at their cores."
Draco nodded once. His eyes abruptly focused, shimmering with his magic. It made Harry stand straighter and Grandpa Arcturus set his book aside so that he could focus on Draco properly.
"What did that man write?" Professor McGonagall snapped.
Right down to his tiny combat booted toes, Dobby trusted Harry. If his beloved Master Harry Potter, best and greatest master ever known, did not wish to tell Dobby something, well then, Dobby didn't need to know it. Harry got the feeling that Dobby was going to do his level best to not even look at their bond tonight so if anything went wrong Harry was going to have to really haul on it to get Dobby's attention.
"Master does not have to thank Dobby," Dobby said.
"Ivy is sorry, Master," Ivy said and she did sound sincere about it, so Draco opened his eyes again. "There is blue phoenix who is wanting into the wards. It is saying that it is sent by Department of Mysteries with message for Master Harry."
"Help me up," Draco said to Mother.
"Shut it, Malfoy," Harry huffed at him, amused despite the stern tone. He'd been thinking the exact same thing.
Which he had.
"Did specifically ask for one, Croaker," Moody said as he stepped aside.
Harry grinned before turning back to the ward stone and its razor edge. The magic wrapped around him was so very warm and welcoming. It was easy to close his eyes, breathing slowly, deeply, to a count that went slower and slower as his heartbeat dropped and his whole body went languid with relaxation.
Would it bounce off the war wards or fall through?
He shook his head and huffed. Ivy couldn't do anything to or about Father. Yet. If someone else could steal Dobby, that meant that Draco could steal not just Ivy but all the house elves. And then, once he as strong enough, he would steal the Malfoy family magic, too.
"Don't I know it," Harry agreed with a roll of his eyes. "Though I think she'd have a lot to say about the quaint old religious practices and how pointless they are."
They were too brown, a warm amber-yellow brown that darkened towards black at the edges.
It was so hard to keep moving.
"Cooper says that it feels like the warped blessing," Neville said, raising his chin and nodding to Harry and Draco. "He said that it feels like the exact opposite of what you two did. Dumbledore is trying to reverse what you did, Harry, Draco. He's trying to make it all go away so that he can enslave us all for good."
Ivy loved her rules and orderly life.
Draco sucked in a breath, pushed all his fear down the same way he did when dealing with Father at his worst, and nodded. "You're right. We won't. Let's go. We need to get into place as quickly as we can."
Harry's heart leaped into his throat.
He grinned as Dobby popped to stand right next to Amal who looked confused.
"Yay," Harry whispered to Dobby who giggled. "It worked!"
No. Not for Dobby. Not for either of them. Not anymore.
"Next door," Moody said. "Malfoy senior is dead. Tortured to death by You-Know-Who. The kid's taken over the family magic, activated the wards and… caught something you lot need to handle."
"Think it's safe?" Harry asked.
As much as Draco didn't want Harry to take whatever message it was, Harry clearly didn't want Draco to do it either. Their bond vibrated with their mutual reluctance to let the other one take the risk, at least until Professor McGonagall put her head around the corner of the stairwell to glower at them both impatiently.
The Malfoy family magic hummed underneath the wards, underneath Draco's feet and his hands on the ward stone, underneath the whole of the estate. He could feel the wards shifting like tides, drifting back and forth between Father and Draco. That drift flowed more and more towards Draco as the seconds ticked onwards.
Odd to discover that no other house did the rituals, not even the Candle Against the Darkness one that let you pray to grow up wise and magically powerful. Draco would have thought that Professor McGonagall would teach that to her lions for sure. Possibly with an added twist to make them good students and excellent Quidditch payers.
"Oh," Harry breathed.
No, Draco's blues. It was his magic now, his legacy. His duty to purify it the way Harry was purifying himself. Harry smiled and nodded once more.
Tippy popped away.
Another long moment passed before the blessing abruptly unraveled under Harry's persistent, gentle encouragement. He breathed in stars, breathed out a vortex of sad, confused blessing, and smiled as the wards slowly eased him back to his body.
They both skittered backwards as the blue phoenix flamed away from the pine tree and appeared in a great gout of blue flame on the battlement five feet from the two of them. Despite the bonfire of blue flame, Draco didn't feel any heat.
Harry grinned and offered a fist to Dobby who cackled before bumping it back. "I told Dobby he was to make himself uniforms. He chose my Aunt Petunia's very best guest sheets for his uniforms."
"Probably not," Draco said. He flickered a glance over at Harry, then went back to staring at the ritual room. "I was… instantly aware of the damned anchor at Malfoy Manor. It was one of the first things the wards screamed at me. I couldn't avoid being aware of it. It was honestly rather like having Dobby yelling in my ear and pulling at my sleeve for hours on end."
"Someone's trying to break through to the floo?" Harry said, frowning. "Who would be coming here?"
"Peter?" Remus snarled, jumping to his feet.
"If I can get free," Remus said as if he was convinced that it was impossible.
Remus stared at Harry without seeing him again, mouth dropped open and making garbled angry noises that were a lot like when Uncle Vernon would get so mad that his face went purple and he started spitting when he tried to speak.
Aunt Petunia was humming. Humming and smiling as she dusted the living room. There was no sign of Dudley or Uncle Vernon which would explain why Aunt Petunia looked so happy. She always seemed happiest when there was no one around to mess up her house or expect things out of her.
"Oh, that's just cruel," Draco said even though he was glaring at Ginny who had her hands in fists as she glowered at Draco as though she wanted to beat him to a pulp.
Draco didn't need to say it for Harry to realize the next moment that there was only one person who would try this. Silverclaw had access. None of the other goblins would try it. Amal was here. So were Mrs. Malfoy and Grandpa Arcturus.
"I'm not joking when I say that the wards are screaming, Mother," Draco said. He grimaced at the second round of diagnostics Healer Smethwyck directed at him. "They are quite literally telling me every single thing Father did to you, every injury you've ever had and all the curse damage you're laboring under. As well as moment by moment notices about your general and specific pain levels."
"Needs blood, Master," Ivy said from a half-pace behind him.
"You may have a point," Draco said.
Draco let his eyes flutter shut as he slumped back in the chair he'd been given in the grey parlor off of the floo room. His whole body thrummed with the power of the wards. They didn't like having the aurors here though, honestly, that might be Draco. He was so very done with their endless questions that probed at things that Draco couldn't and wouldn't tell them.
Draco frowned at him. "Then what's driving this?"
He felt the moment the magic brushed over the blessing buried deep inside.
Harry didn't move.
"Harry?" Hermione stuck her head out from one of the other rooms which had been curtained off with a white sheet. "Harry!"
There was no other explanation.
"A lot more," Amal agreed.
Draco pulled his mother's athame and carefully drew it across his palm.
Usually, the kitchen hummed with the squeaky voices of house elves. The stoves and fireplaces were always busy, full of food being prepared; roasts being cooked. Every worktable, set at the proper height for house elves, was covered with bowls and cutting boards, baskets of fruit and stacks of eggs.
"Fine," Draco said. "What are you seeing that we're not seeing? For you to be so certain he can be saved, there must be a hint, a shred of hope. I can't see it. I don't believe Mother or the others can either. What is it?"
Harry pursed his lips before coming to the sofa and curling up against Draco's side in a heart-stopping gesture of affection that Draco was not at all prepared for. That didn't stop him from wrapping his arms right around Harry and holding him close. Nothing would have stopped that short of Father appearing and cursing Draco silly.
Which, honestly, Harry kind of expected.
Blue bit her lip as Draco carefully sat on the edge of his mother's bed. "Mistress is not waking, Master Draco. Is not waking for hours and hours and hours yet. Blue made very, very sure."
"Do not ever do that again," Draco hissed at Harry. "Do not leave me behind."
"So, anyway," Harry said, hoping that his blush for the affection didn't show too much, "I need to have a safe place to stay. I think an unplottable location with the best wards the world has to offer would be good. I need allies. Amal suggested that we contact my godfather's … patriarch?"
Dobby sighed and shook his head so hard that his ears flapped. There were grass stains on his ridiculous yellow cabbage rose cargo pants' knees. His shirt looked as sweaty as Draco felt. And he looked so tired, so very exhausted.
"What are you doing here?" Draco demanded in the most hostile tone imaginable even though he really wasn't angry. Stunned, yes. Not angry. "What did you do to Lord Black?"
A darkness. A spot of desperation and pain and magic working against itself.
To Harry's surprise, Professor McGonagall fixed Remus with a gimlet glare that had him blushing violently while ducking his head. That was more than an idle wish. Remus had a way, or used to have a way maybe, of knowing who was where in Hogwarts.
"Mate, you can't be serious," Ron said to Harry in a pleading voice but with a threatening face and clenched fists.
The ward circles under Draco's feet flared into dramatic, blazing life.
"Dobby does not know how," Dobby said. "If Wolfy-man was something else, elves could be removing curses. He is not. Is wolfy-man."
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, fingers catching on a million different knots that he should try to comb out. But wouldn't. Not until morning. Or, more accurately, not until he woke up since it was already morning.
Draco hummed and stared at the runes, obviously reading them easily.
"I'm outright forbidden from working any level of magic beyond the most minor," Grandfather Acturus said with a scowl as he threw himself into one of the armchairs. "Neither of you have the training or the energy to do it."
That was that.
His body shook under Harry's hand. Something was building between them. Tight and hard and desperate, the magic between them crackled quietly. So very quietly. Harry's panting and Dobby's chattering teeth were louder.
The ward stone pulsed as Draco approached it. He ran his fingers gently over the surface of the stone. It felt cool, a bit distant. Perhaps that was why one only had the wards repaired by outsiders once or twice a generation. It made the wards a bit standoffish.
"We can do that," Fred agreed with such confidence that Draco's heart leaped. "I mean, not the spearpoint bit where you take the light to the heart of darkness. We've not managed to figure out how to call our magic as twins and move at the same time."
He turned to Professor McGonagall who looked up from the letter from Grandpa Arcturus that she was proofreading and extensively editing, much to Grandpa Arcturus' outrage. Apparently, he didn't like the way Professor McGonagall all but graded his efforts.
Neither of them would give up now.
"Swashlin," Silverclaw said with a similarly tight-lipped smile. "Thank you. They are, though my gold is not as free-flowing as it should be. Mr. Potter. I see you finally decided to answer my summons."
It felt like a shade, a soul, an angry ghost haunting Father through the Dark Mark. Who knew? Maybe that was how the Dark Lord tortured Father for all of Mother's attempts to save him.
"A curse," Draco breathed as his eyes went wide. "Oh, damn that man! He could curse a werewolf, and no one would look sideways at him. Harry, check the wards. Specifically, have them look for curses that would bind a werewolf in unstoppable ways."
Father's screams died to gurgling groans that slowly faded away until Malfoy Manor was deathly silent. Draco rubbed his face. His eyes were dry. He couldn't remember the last time he'd cried. After everything that had happened, especially since the end of term when the Dark Lord's spirit returned to torture Father and Mother, Draco didn't have any tears left.
"That," Harry agreed, pointing at Draco.
"What ritual?" Hermione asked in a screech that might have broken glass. "Harry! You can't do rituals! You don't have the training!"
Percy was dead-white, freckles standing out against his pale skin. "Is that thing why you pestered me about who was visiting my room last year?"
Draco nodded. "Tell her to do just that. Father…"
"As I understand it," Amal said, letting the books fly back up to their spots on the shelves, "your father gave Dumbledore access to the library before he died."
"Tell me," Grandpa Arcturus said. It was request, a gentle one, not an order despite the phrasing.
Tears welled up in Draco's eyes as the family magic settled into his core. His knees gave way despite Quinn and Ivy supporting him. He ended up with his forehead pressed against the bloody ward stone, crying for the father he had never gotten the chance to know.
"Much stops Ivy," Ivy whispered.
"Or me," Draco agreed. He shrugged when Harry frowned at him. "Dumbledore knew that Father regularly punished me, Potter. He knew that Mother was being tortured. I know that he knows about the abuse three quarters of the Hogwarts students endure."
"No," Harry said and laughed so brightly that joy bubbled inside of Draco's chest. "Of course not. That's why we're asking for help. We can't do it alone. We need you. We need the grownups. We need everyone. And they need you."
Against Harry's vaguely rage-sweaty hand, Draco's fingers felt as cool and dry as a snake's. Sort of appropriate given his name. Harry had just two seconds to register that before Draco's magic touched his magic.
"Will be," Ivy said, biting her lip and glancing towards the door beyond which lurked silence and the madness that was the Dark Lord. "Is not yet. Has not hit magical maturation."
Mr. Swashlin leaned back in his chair, eyes wide and cheeks going ashy-pale. When Dobby offered a cup of tea, Mr. Swashlin took it so absently that Harry wasn't sure that even knew that he had tea at all.
Either way, they spent about an hour or so debating just what to ask Sirius and the Department of Mysteries for. Harry spent the hour writing up a detailed explanation of what he and Draco had done and explaining that it wasn't something that could be easily replicated without access to a properly pure labyrinth, really strong wards and people who were willing to risk their magic on a secret request that no one else would know about or be able to praise them for. He made sure to tell Croaker which book they'd used for their ritual and wrote down the entire thing so that Croaker had as much information as Harry could give him.
It was such a foreign mindset that Draco could only stare and sigh and back Harry up over the last couple of days. Two very long, very full days that had included far too many experiments with the Potter ward stone, too many tiny cuts to Harry's hands, and too many failures.
Draco frowned even harder. "And yet she came instantly to save Remus."
All the pieces that Harry had fed Draco clicked into place as Draco ran it all through his marvelous mind.
Fangtooth waved his hand and Arcturus took a deep breath as if he'd been held down so tightly that he could barely breathe. To Harry's surprise, Fangtooth stepped back and let Arcturus sit up without assistance. Harry pulled free from Amal and ran over to help Arcturus.
"Nod for yes," Draco whispered. Her hands clenched in her dress at the same time Draco's clenched on his knees. "Dobby will never answer me or Father again."
Father was losing control of the Malfoy family magic.
The excitement shifted from delight in the grounds to a sort of speculation that made Draco narrow his eyes at Harry. Which only made Harry grin at him as he pulled Draco right back into the ballroom. To Draco's surprise, Harry pulled his wand out of his pants pocket and bit his lip for a second.
"They were back then," Draco said. "Especially since they'd been eating on gold and silver sets up until that point. There's plates and bowls and everything. I didn't realize that the elves had put the set away in here."
Mrs. Malfoy hummed and tapped her fingernail against her bottom lip in a gesture that felt remarkably similar to Silverclaw's claw-tapping. Her eyes gleamed silver as she turned to Grandpa Arcturus who was grinning like a wolf. Next to him, Professor McGonagall shook her head, chuckling under her breath.
Harry sighed and leaned on one of the battlements, putting his chin on his hands while staring glumly off towards the distant sliver of sea that they could see.
"Very short," Draco agreed. "Don't worry, Mother would never keep us up. She wanted us both to go to bed hours and hours and hours ago."
"Ah, we're all exhausted," Amal said. "I'm not great at transfiguration, either."
Dobby nodded. His eyes were still dark, dark green with lemon and celadon lightning bolts through them. Odd that the colors were that instead of the red of the magic that bound them together. Harry reached out and touched Dobby's chest. The bond throbbed between them, especially after Dobby put his hands over Harry's.
"All right, point taken," Draco said with a sigh that came right from his toes. "Our bond was behaving differently after the charms and control spells were removed. Its not much of a stretch to think that removing the blessing caused things to get unbalanced, too."
Even after a year at Hogwarts, magic was a wonder. Maybe especially after a year at Hogwarts. It wasn't like Harry had done all that much studying. Or like he'd been taught anything truly complicated.
"It used to belong to my father," Harry said. "I got it last Christmas, Yule, from… Huh. Well. Then again, maybe I shouldn't use it."
The truth of that made Quinn mumble complaints against Father under his breath as he stomped into Mother's bedroom and slammed the door. Magic flared along that wall, blocking everything and anything that might happen in Father's bedroom.
Dobby plopped down next to Harry, waving one hand, making all the rubble go away. In its place were two stretchers that lifted Harry and Draco off the floor smoothly. Only a few inches but it was definitely better than the rubble had been.
Harry hugged Draco. They'd hidden the prayer books. Spent the afternoon listening to the grownups speculate about Grindelwald and his goals. Asked about the cataloging of the books and told the elves to make sure everyone slept and ate and didn't spend all night fretting themselves into pieces.
"Ugly?" Harry asked.
Harry took a deep breath. "Wish for what we want."
Harry leaned back into his chair again, biting his lip. "Hitting?"
"Always," Harry agreed. "I… don't know enough here. If it's not a charm or curse or a standard spell or a potion, what other sorts of spells are there out there?"
"Oh, my god," Harry gasped as he dashed into the library and then flung open the drapes to stare out the window. "Oh, wow. Draco!"
"Let the Healer through!" Draco snapped.
The darkness disappeared as torches took flame around the room.
There was no snap.
So many warped blessings. So many bits of magic desperately working to do the right thing even though it was impossible.
"Get a healer for Mother, too," Draco told Moody who nodded and stomped off to do just that.
He reached out and pulled the limp fabric of the tent flap open, giving Harry a good look into the interior of the tent. Which was huge and beautiful with yellow and burnt orange wall hangings, couches and multiple rooms that had a Middle Eastern feel to them. Harry blinked and stared, shaking his head.
"Whatever we want," Harry said just to Draco as if the chaotic excitement wasn't falling at them like an avalanche. "Whatever we want."
"It's been much too long a couple days," Harry complained as he added equal amounts of milk to his cup of Dobby's special tea and then put in about eight sugar cubes.
It hurt so much.
"Can we give Tippy the cloak?" Harry asked Draco because Draco was way better at tactics. "He could take it, go hit Dumbledore from behind or something and stay hidden. Or maybe use it to hide the elves. They'd all fit underneath it."
Ivy made a little squeaky noise that Draco ignored. He more than likely was breaking a dozen different protocols by actually speaking to the ward stone. Father had always said that one shouldn't treat magic as if it was alive and truly aware.
"Oh, do get on with it, Potter," Draco snapped. "The sooner this is done, the sooner we can go check out your library. I've heard great things about the Potter Library. I'd hate to be disappointed by it."
The goblins had put up special wards that prevented anyone from forcing their way into the floo. They'd updated all the wards so that they were one hundred and eighty percent secure in every way possible. They'd called them war wards, which sounded just about right to Harry given that Voldemort's shade was still skulking about somewhere causing problems.
"True," Draco agreed.
"Is my magic mature enough?" Draco whispered once he pushed back the faint that had nearly caught him.
"Odd," Grandfather Arcturus said. "I've never heard of that happening."
"Master Draco should be sleeping," Dobby said, hands on his hips.
"Tell me everything, Lord Malfoy," Silverclaw said as he scribbled a note on a scrap of paper and dropped it into his message box. It flashed away. "Spare no details."
She stopped. Her eyes went wide as she stared at Harry who started grinning. It took a moment longer before Remus gasped. Then Amal was on his feet, hurrying over to one of the bookshelves to pull of books that he tossed to Remus who started flipping through them urgently.
"Agreed," Harry said.
"He doesn't want to be free," Draco whispered again as he turned and then went to curl up in a ball on the wing chair set before the blazing fire.
"Let us bring the Light of Hope into the Heart of Darkness."
There was magic. Light and bright and wild and beautiful.
"I have a knife, Potter," Draco drawled. "Now go. I'll be in place well before you get to the labyrinth. Just… be careful, please?"
Dobby popped away, leaving Remus with his jaw dropped open and Mrs. Malfoy with her hands over her mouth.
Draco's laugh this time was entirely too hysterical. He leaned into Mother's embrace, letting her pet his hair and coo softly reassuring words that meant absolutely nothing. Other than that she loved him and wished that he hadn't had to deal with all of this.
Other than the wild, desperate hope pounding through the bond.
"All right, Harry," Grandpa Arcturus said. "You come here, to the center of the circle. You'll be sitting in the middle, right in this circle. As soon as you sit, the spell circle will engage. You won't be able to leave. That's by design. We're going to pull the soul anchor up out of you and into the outer layers of the ritual circle. By keeping you here, you'll be safe inside the inner circle and we'll be safe outside."
George agreed with an identical sigh.
They ate all the sandwiches, half the second batch that popped in, and had three big pots of tea before Harry and Draco had filled them in on what'd happened so far. The twins joined them pretty quickly, snagging sandwiches out of their siblings' hands and getting snarled at by Ginny and cursed at by Ron who didn't manage to save his sandwich from the twins despite trying to hide it against his chest and then trying to fight them for it.
"Different library, too." Harry hummed, arms tightening around Draco's waist. "Remus, let's go downstairs. I'll talk you through what I did. You can try it, see if it works, and then we'll go to Malfoy Manor."
"Don't let Dumbledore in," Harry said so quickly that Draco stared at him. "I mean, keep all of Voldemort's people out, definitely, but you absolutely can't let Dumbledore in, either."
"I'll contact the Goblins about it after dinner," Amal promised.
Remus shuddered and turned away. He wrapped his arms around his waist, hugging himself the way Harry used to when he was locked in his cupboard and hadn't been allowed to eat for a couple of days. Which, wow, that was not good.
Harry stared at Dobby, mouth open. A thousand different questions whirled in his mind, garbling anything that might come out his mouth until the shock, amazement and awe that his mother was that incredible resolved into one very big, very important question.
"No one should have," Draco agreed. "Ivy!"
Mr. Swashlin hummed, nodding thoughtfully while taking a refill of his tea from Dobby who brought their plates to the table. Dobby popped away with the plates for everyone else. Draco would have to check that Mother ate properly later. After all her healing, she definitely needed to eat well.
"…No." Draco frowned, trying to remember where they'd come from. "No, I don't think that they did. No one has seen these yet."
"Oh wow," Harry whined, voice much higher than normal. "Ow. So much ow. Where'd my glasses go?"
"Down in the wardroom attempting to give you some level of privacy, Mother," Draco said. He blushed when she raised an eyebrow at him. "I really don't need to know all of that. The wards were… intrusive. Extremely intrusive. I apologize for that."
"Wow," Harry breathed once the door to the floo room shut. "Does that mean that the real Dumbledore is dead or was he tortured and imprisoned all this time?"
"He wants power," Draco murmured. He turned to Mrs. Malfoy who was very alert as she stared at Draco. "Mother, which is more powerful, a blessing or a prayer to the Old Gods?"
She'd come.
Moody's eye snapped back around to Draco as he stood straight. "That's auror business there."
The words tumbled out before he could think about it.
"As I understand it," Amal said with another nod and a firmer grip on Harry's shoulders, "yeah. Lily was… not flattering about that being their only protection. I never understood why they didn't update the wards here and hunker down. You could send entire armies against Potter Keep and never get through. People have tried multiple times over the centuries."
"No, Master Harry," Dobby said. "Dobby would not. Is very good way to die. No Elf would ever steal goblin mail."
They turned to the adults.
"He's…" Draco tipped his head sharply to one side, then shook his head. "I was about to say that I'm astonished that Madame Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall didn't catch that he has a learning disability, but then I remembered who we're talking about. They probably didn't even check. Why would a son of a pureblood line have any problems with learning?"
"Me, too," Harry agreed.
Healer Smethwyck snorted. "That has to be annoying. I'd have thought you'd turned the notices down."
Draco got up and then cursed in a way that would've made Father proud, but which would've had Mother scolding him for being uncouth.
So was Father.
"What the--?" Harry asked.
His magic was a rich warm red with hints of gold. It played over his skin, just barely visible in the darkness of the parlor. To Draco, there was a hint of cinnamon in the air, perhaps a touch of cumin on his tongue. The room certainly seemed far warmer than it had a moment before.
The parchment bloomed with a map of Hogwarts that showed every single room, every floor, every inch of the castle including tunnels and secret passages that Harry'd had no idea existed. Fred shrugged one shoulder and waved at the map.
"I need to talk to Silverclaw," Amal said. "It's regarding the Potter and Black accounts."
Harry blinked and then did take a deep breath the way Draco wanted. He let it out slowly. Only then did Draco continue, biting his lip and gripping Mrs. Malfoy's hand.
"All right there?" Grandfather Arcturus asked, one hand gently resting on Draco's shoulder.
"You said that there are secret passages and tunnels," Draco said to Fred and George. Will any of them get us underneath the Hogwarts wards? We will need some method to get in and that's likely the only thing that will do it."
Harry stared up the long straight away that led to the heart of the labyrinth. The walls seemed twenty feet high now, still obsidian instead of hedge. Far, far ahead, miles it seemed, a warm golden light pulsed as if it was waiting for Harry.
"Um." Harry bit his lip and then sighed. "All right. Let me lay this out. Dumbledore placed me with my mother's sister, Petunia Dursley and her family. They hate magic. They hate me. They've treated me worse than a house elf my entire life. I've been beaten, shouted at, starved, and worked until I passed out since I was four or so. Dumbledore knows that. I asked him to be placed somewhere else and he refused. None of the professors at Hogwarts seem to care. They certainly didn't help. Voldemort is trying to kill me. He's not dead. He's kind of a ghost? Sort of? And he possessed Professor Quirrell last year until I sort of killed him at the end of year. I need help. I need a safe place to live. I need protection against Dumbledore and his agenda. Dobby thinks that you can help. Will you?"
“I won’t say a word,” he promised. She pushed past him and hung the sweater over the banister, tapping her fingers against the wood for a second, thinking.
“It didn’t sting you.”
“Of course!” She rushed into the pantry, overwhelmed. Harry resigned himself to the experience, holding the top of the bag open so Ron and Ginny could stuff it with cutlery and the odd whole onion.
Maybe the allure of getting to actually wear the Cloak was too strong.
“I can’t bloody believe,” Ron said between gasps of laughter. “I’m telling
“How long will you
The third movie was about to end, its characters wrapping up loose ends and making confessions of love. It was bad enough to put Ron to sleep. Harry wished he could do the same.
There was a pause, and Draco looked to Harry like he expected him to say something. So he did.
“Fine.” She disappointed him again by not rising to the jab at Ron. “I’ll be checking in semi-frequently. Weekly, maybe – “
the war.
“Draco gave it to me. And…and he was babbling the other night about the potion affecting him. And the moon cycles having certain meanings.”
“It was sort of a lark, really. He needed to go get something, but didn’t want to go alone.”
A boot kicked sharply at his thigh, and then there was light. It was blinding at first. He had to blink tears away before he could make out the ghostly face bending over him. It was a man. He looked surprised (which seemed quite ironic), then
Harry was flabbergasted. Maybe it was stupid to be so surprised, after the looks and whispers he faced in the streets. But this was markedly different.
He sighed and pulled his legs up, slumping down against the pillows. Harry dropped the cover over him and cast a warming charm.
It took an entire afternoon Vanishing what wasn’t needed. Some files seemed unrelated to office goings-on – he stuck those in an empty desk drawer. Finally, there was just a single tower of files to be passed by Ron again – just in case. They looked unfinished and still had quilled scribbles in the margins. As little as Harry wanted to be in the office, he was quite worried about getting rid of something important and his coworkers suffering for it.
“Not that it was going swell, anyway,” Élise murmured.
“I’m alright. And you?”
Harry shrugged. Ron rocked back onto his heels, sucking his teeth.
“Oh, shut it,” Ginny snapped. She smiled at Harry, gesturing to his broom. “Go on.”
He smiled to himself and shut the door, finding Hermione in the kitchen. She had gotten the dishes to start cleaning themselves, and looked a little guilty when he walked in.
it said, swaying just slightly. Harry nodded.
“Teddy?” She sounded surprised. “Of course. He’s at Hogwarts.”
He blinked at the numbers, waiting for his eyes to focus on a much smaller sum. No, it was the same. “I have no idea. How much do you think I’ll need for…I dunno, a few things for Teddy?”
theory that explains all of this!”
. Surrounded by those…” She shuddered.
“Two days.” She was hanging back, but it was clear that took some effort. “Are you hungry?”
“I know I’ve lost – er, forgotten things. But with everything I’ve learned…it seemed an oversight to ignore him. Since he was a Death Eater, and all.”
Hermione smiled.
And her frame swung forward, revealing a circular entrance to a very cozy room. A fire went, and large squashy chairs dotted the carpet near the warmth. Reena was sat in one, her nose stuck in a book.
“Not anymore," Teddy insisted, turning his chin up. Harry was glad to hear he hadn't cottoned on to Ron's heavy anti-Slytherin agenda.
And the flashiest. Nearly entirely covering the second story windows was a massive, neon sign that read
“Yeah.” Teddy shoved his hands in his pockets, walking off to the side of the path. Harry felt the others draw further away to give them some privacy. “Thanks for coming, Harry.”
“ – not tell you again, Mr. Weasley. This is your fifth and final warning – “
“Just Malfoy will suffice,” Draco corrected shortly. She blinked.
A half-eaten breakfast sat on the sitting room table. The coffee was still warm. Harry checked the rooms before moving down the spiral steps toward the main store. He’d sent Pig, so the letter must have come from here.
“He’s in London.” Harry put his hand over the mug so he didn’t have to see the words anymore. “It made the papers, didn’t you see?”
He put his things away, stored the snake’s things in an empty cabinet, and made dinner. It had been an uneventful week. Wednesday was spent with Victoire, and Fleur had even hung around in the afternoon. They bundled the baby up in a tiny coat and earmuffs, watching her walk around what little yard he had. Harry liked Fleur – she was opinionated, but funny and always kind to him.
” Harry snapped. He was trying to
“It’s – “
“Lovely music to sleep by,” a voice called. Harry took a step backward, looking in on Draco sitting up and downing one of the flasks.
to be the most toxic thing he’d ever heard.
“It’s called a
George twiddled with his pen. He still looked rather tired, Harry thought.
Teddy looked curious again, but kept quiet. He waved once more as they swept off together and that was that.
“Me and ‘Mione got a letter from Ted, too,” Ron said. “Yesterday.”
“They’re mates. At least, they were all through school. Zabini endorsed his job at the Ministry, so parents were furious when he got his position here, but McGonagall doesn’t much care about that sort of thing.”
“You haven’t heard a word I’ve said! Why don’t you tell Harry what you did?”
“You can’t use magic on mum’s sweaters. Whoever sells her this yarn must really hate our family personally, because you can
“Did you just
“What was?”
“I tried.” He had – for what felt like hours. But whatever part of his schooling or work experience that would give some context for advanced potionry was gone. “Couldn’t understand any of it.”
“I like it here.” He plucked some grass up with his fingers. “Do we do this often?”
“How could he work for the Ministry, then? Why isn’t he in prison?”
Her hair seemed less curly than usual. Flat. And her skin had an ashy hue to it. They walked through the Atrium together, gathering more stares than usual. Harry had to let go of her to Floo, and once they were in her flat she seemed even weaker.
“Well, not exactly…I mean, I thought I was making something up on the spot, so – “
“Well, regardless.” He took one of his new sweaters out, holding it against his chest and hoping it would accentuate what muscle he’d accumulated in the gym. “Have you ever bitten anyone?”
“How are you reading so fast?” Dean muttered in an undertone to Élise, still on the second page. Draco sighed sharply and crossed one leg over the other.
Harry set the dog down, expecting it to run to its master. But it only darted around their ankles as they approached the cabin. Ron knocked, bemused.
“It’s a…marked improvement over the past, let’s say.”
“Go back to sleep.”
“Camden Catacombs.” Seamus shuddered. “And it’s
Debra grunted and hit Dean with her elbow, clearly too cold and irritated to speak.
“When it was getting really bad, Dumbledore started gathering everyone he thought he could trust. They called themselves the Order of the Phoenix.”
Draco’s hands twitched, tightening on the arms of his chair. “What do you mean?”
“What exactly happened, dear?” Molly asked, speaking over her son as she rushed over with a levitated plate. “Concussion? Nasty curse? Whatever it was, no one thought to feed you a good meal – “
He stopped himself from calling out her name, blinking at the picture in front of him. Hermione was on the couch, slumped sideways with her eyes shut. A blanket had been half-pulled over her shoulders and a book sat open in her lap, moments away from falling to the floor.
She eyed the paper intensely for a moment, then looked up and recited something in stilted Chinese. Confucius gave some sort of answer before gathering his robes and stepping down from his perch. Ron and Harry both checked over their shoulders – no muggle so much as glanced their way, even as the stone podium silently sank downwards, unfolding itself into a set of stairs that led into a pitch dark blackness.
“Aren’t you freezing?” Hermione cried over the volume. Luna plucked the hat from Harry’s head and fixed it over her own. One of the flowers fell out of her hair and onto the wooden floor.
“Sorry, where else does one buy oatmeal?”
“Most of them are in prison, though, aren’t they?” Harry yawned.
Come on, we’ll go find her!”

“I’ve heard about him.”
He threw a towel around himself and pushed the door open. “What did you say?”
“Ready?”

were yelling behind him. Ron, Neville, and Teddy all whooped. The Slytherins’ serpent suddenly shot up, flying in a perfect spiral once before falling gently back to the awaiting hands.
.” The reference to Molly made Hermione flinch. “If you were just planning on taking it all away?
Draco went, if possible, even more pale. “Yes. I would.”
didn’t I?”
Harry obeyed without thought, standing and opening the parlor door a crack. Acrid, white smoke barreled out at them.
Ron leaned into his ear and whispered something.

Harry joined him there. It was still early, but the sun was climbing higher, casting long shadows down the empty square. “It’s London. He can hide in plain sight.”
He’d checked the Apparition map in the most recent
After finishing the potion and leaving the groceries, though, he didn’t really have a reason to go to Grimmauld Place. All he heard of Draco was whatever she mentioned in passing, and those conversations were dangerous because she’d just ask him if he’d brought up the library yet, and Harry kept having to tell her he hadn’t.
The Great Lake, as they called it, was probably gorgeous in the summers. On a day like this, it reflected the gray sky and some mist hung around the far off shores. That area offered the best view of the castle. Something massive shifted out in the center – a movement in the corner of his eye that left ripples curling outward. He found himself gripping Teddy’s arm in alarm.
“Would you like to come home with me?” If it could talk, then he felt it was rude to not at least ask. “I can build you a fire, there. It’s plenty warm.”
“Ginny,” came the muffled reply. “And I’ll be a bloody ice sculpture if you don’t open the door!”
“We can’t even walk through the Ministry together without making the papers.”
house.”
The bathroom was messy, too, but not unclean. He stepped over a pair of jeans and a crumpled shirt, almost surprised to see his reflection in the mirror. A floating cloud of confused mist would have been more appropriate, but, alas, he was a man.
Something hard barreled into his side, sending him sprawling to the ground just as two sections of wall from the buildings on either side of them detached with more rumbling noises and dust, chunks of brick and cement falling in pieces as the larger two slabs rushed toward each other.
stop in for a drink?”
“The corridor.”
Earthshine: Sunlight reflected by Earth that makes the otherwise dark part of the Moon glow faintly. It’s especially obvious during the Moon’s thin crescent phases.
“And what about the risk you took?” Harry had been significantly limiting his time spent outdoors. He wasn’t scared, exactly, but it was a little creepy knowing anyone on the street could be the person that killed Teddy’s father. Seeing Draco so shaken over it made him feel more inclined to take the threat seriously.
“Alright.”
One of them was sitting on a nearby table. The candle set itself down next to it, providing some light while Harry searched his pockets for the cell phone.
“Yeah!” Ron was starting to sound excited, too. “Yeah, I mean – Maybe McGonagall ought to know you’ve forgot everything. And we can see Neville!”
He didn’t have a reply to that. Her smile widened and she stood on tiptoe to whisper it in his ear. Then she threw the powder into the flame and gestured for Harry to step inside.
Harry shrugged. “I have no idea.”
“Come off it.” Ron rolled his eyes. “They think it’s a good idea, Harry.”
She bit her lip and shrugged.
The lift stopped early at Level Three. Harry sighed and prepared to greet someone who undoubtedly knew him. With a faint
The Briticism fell awkwardly through her accent. She and Ron alone shared the main table, with, shockingly, paperwork spread between them.
από τη βροχή σύλληψη, “from the rain, conception”.
“I’ve eaten everything.”
“No more babysitting?”
The second was him, Ron and Hermione. Their wedding day, it looked like. Ron tried to coax a shorter-haired Harry into the frame. It looked like he was politely refusing. Hermione gestured, too, but still he tried to ease himself away.
Draco thought for a still second, staring at the cover.  “A Pegasus wanders into a garden, and eats an apple off the ground. The garden belongs to a centaur, who scolds the Pegasus for stealing. Of course, the Pegasus has no concept of property and asks the centaur why he would begrudge a fellow beast this fallen fruit. The centaur claims he is no beast, that he is a fellow to man, and that he has a small fortune of man’s coin that he uses to trade in the nearby town.
“Were you hurt? You looked fine in the paper.”
“Residue.” Draco stiffly, trying to stand up and falling back to the floor with a painful
“Yeah. Yeah, if we go there this weekend we could look around. For now, we can start researching in the Ministry Archives.”
“No.” She didn’t sound very put out about it.
Ron’s smile was awkward. “He’s even less sentimental than McGonagall. Fact is, you’re no use to him like this. He’ll want to see you when you’re back to normal, I'm sure.”
Harry blinked, only mildly shocked to hear something like that. Hermione always put it much more judiciously. Harry
“Potter?” He called out, looking at the candle.
Several teller desks lined the long room, goblins and humans sitting behind them shuffling through papers or counting coins. Harry glanced down at the paper, walking straight past them toward the smaller hall at the end. He pushed his hood off as he went, spurred on by the lack of patrons currently inside. The humans that glanced up smiled, but the goblins scowled. He walked faster, following Ron’s instructions.
“What d’you mean?”
“Well, you’re the only one she doesn’t gripe at to cut it off. Thought it might soften the blow.” He went downstairs, leaving Harry to follow, a bit shaken. It was early afternoon, the light outside already edging toward gold as the sun descended.
The shower was stocked with the basics – he even thought he recognized some of the labels from his own place. So he started the water and took his clothes off. He was clean already, but it was the false clean of charms and magic. Not water and soap.
“Is that normal?” He asked when the doors shut, skin prickling. Was that his mind playing tricks, or had several people just stopped in their tracks to wait for the next one?
“It’s your place,” Ron said, with a shrewd look. The Auror look. “As much as it is mine.”
“Is that so?” George asked. Harry caught the hint of a smile. “So you sent him to
“It’s November tomorrow, which means when it’s full it will be the Dead Moon. Or one of mourning, depending on who you ask.”
Ginny had on a heavy cap identical to the one Luna had stolen, only black instead of red. Rosy cheeks and deep red lipstick made her look like a painted doll. A rather horrified doll, at least.
It was gold, sitting over an unlit burner plate between the two sofas. Dark red sludge bubbled within. He leaned closer, wincing at the sharp smell. All around were more books, some open, some closed. Glass bottles of various sizes and shapes. It seemed haphazard, but Draco probably hadn’t planned on full grown Aurors falling out of the fireplace.
“You did?” Harry turned. “Why?”
He Vanished the memo and looked at Harry for a long moment before turning to Draco with cold eyes. “Do you regret it?”
“Right…but all that bad stuff happened to
“Er, yeah.” He folded the navy pants back and shoved them in a drawer. “You know what I mean.”
“Harry Potter isn’t just a celebrity.”
“The bird won’t…” he sighed, dropping the sweater and pulling his hair free. “Doesn’t matter. Don’t bite anyone, okay?”
He laughed again, listening in on Percy and Bill’s conversation about Gringotts and cursebreaking, Fleur joining in every now and again. Seemed contentious, but he noticed that Percy inevitably ended up agreeing with whatever she said. Something about her felt oddly familiar. He couldn’t pin it down.
“Yes.”
“It’s the soul part that matters, Finnigan. Dementor’s kiss took care of that as far as Crouch is concerned.”
“Mum,” Ron said tiredly, standing to the side.
“No, it’s what we call – “ Ron stopped, laughing suddenly and loudly. He laughed so hard he fell back, laying on the floor with a hand on his stomach. The sound of it warmed something in Harry’s stomach, even if it seemed incongruous. It made him smile, too.
“Oh! I completely forgot - I see what you’re getting at, Harry, but I’m afraid this is rather important. I’ll have to cancel our meeting. You see, Lou from Business Regulations has decided to drop by – “
“How do you feel?”
“Ah,” Harry said, intelligently.
He set the frame back down, leaving it face up this time. Hermione’s next breath shook.
“I don’t care what they think of me,” he snapped, still at a whisper. “In fact, I welcome it. People like me shouldn’t
Draco threw him a look. “You do realize you could make that happen at the drop of a hat.”
“Spit it out.”
“I’ve worked more than enough.” Her grip on his arm was very tight, and he realized she was using him to keep steady.
“Because you’re – “ Ron started, then caught himself, smiling sheepishly. “It’s the witch magazines more than anything. The day you find a girl will be a day of national mourning. Molly’ll keel over from happiness, though.”
Harry grinned as the dog scrambled into his arms. It was surprisingly heavy, or just well-fed underneath all that fur. Underneath a heavy white fringe he could see dark eyes, and a pink tongue swiped against his nose when he didn’t pull back quickly enough. He laughed and scratched behind it’s ears.
“Look, Har, here they come!” Ron shook him.
“You don’t mean ‘nice’. You mean…entertaining.”
“Held? Prisoner?”
“Drawing room’s the best place. It’s the heart of the house,” Hermione murmured, setting her umbrella by the door. They tiptoed up the creaking steps to the first landing and into the drawing room, where two graying sofas faced each other in audience to a once-grand piano on one end and a large, unused fireplace on the other.
“Pig?” Harry asked incredulously, reaching for the lower pane. Something hit him hard on the cheekbone.

“THEY ARE RUNNING, FOLKS.

Draco gazed levelly at him, until he actually had to resist the urge to squirm. The stopwatch saved him, dinging tinnily. Draco clicked it off and slid back to the floor.
“Come on,” she urged. “Walk me home.”
“He’s my brother. I’ve got four. George, Percy, Bill, Charlie, and one sister. Ginny.” He looked at Harry in a lost, sad way. “I count you as the fifth.”
Every torch was lit when they entered, but above the second landing the flames were blue instead of yellow. The same amount of light, it just didn’t manage to penetrate the thick air. Stairs stopped creaking as well, adding to the oppressive quiet. Various discolored spots of wall marked the places where abusive, blood-purist (and plain racist, he heard) portraits had been forcibly removed. He moved slowly, trying to picture this place as anything but empty.
“I said

They didn’t leave until late. He was thoroughly hugged or had his hand shaken by everyone, and found he was very sorry to go.
“But Shacklebolt said – “
In the photograph, he’d been wearing sun shades. Now, through the round, thin framed glasses he wore he could see that his eyes were a deep green, slightly too bright against his darker coloring. The beard and moustache were new, as well. Too much of it for only three days – he must have been growing it out.

“You garden,” Ron said, lunging across the table to spin one of the small ceramic plant bowls around. Harry had stuck them in the window to catch the sunlight. “That’s a change. What are they?”

“What was it he asked for with the Penseive? Marco…something.”
He followed, tugging the collar of his cloak a bit looser. Questions buzzed through his head as they walked. Maybe he just wanted to fill the silence. Soon enough, he was sufficiently distracted by hundreds of eyes turned in his direction.
“Do I always let people manhandle me like this?” He asked, pulling his undershirt into place and making sure no vomit had gotten into his hair. “Or is it just your family?”
Floo seemed the only option, as he didn’t know how to actually
"I was with my father," Draco said, and offered nothing else; he didn't quite know what his father was doing down there.
