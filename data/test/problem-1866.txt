“Harry,” Draco said, motioning to Dobbeson, “This is the caretaker of the townhouse. You may remember him?”
“-drian. Hello? Anyone home?” Draco’s voice broke into his thoughts and he looked up to where his best friend stood.
Lyra let her sword tip drop to the ground as she laughed at Harry. The man tripped over his own feet. Again. She knew she should not be laughing at her friend as he struggled to learn how to use a sword, but he was just too adorable. Adorably awful. She had to admire his determination though.
Cas blinked back to the present as the floo chimed. He did not turn around, because only a select few of trusted people knew of the address. He continued to stare out the window. One of the wolf pack was prowling across the clearing, leaving a trail of footprints in the perfect snow. Cas rarely ventures far in winter, at most to the barn, so most of the snow has not been disturbed much since it started falling in early November.
“Well, yeah. Really powerful wizards like my father can do spells both wandlessly and wordlessly. He doesn’t need to use a spell for something he just shapes his magic into doing what he wants with concentration.” Hadrian said. The bell rang for class to start and the crowd that had gathered dispersed but everyone was now sending revering looks his way.
The previous night had been a success. At least, he had thought so. The party went well. The guests liked the food. Even Dudley had looked as if he was enjoying himself. But that had apparently been a lie. After everyone had left, while Harry had been busy cleaning up the mess, the young master had complained about something or other to the Baron and Baroness.
Pulling a knife out of his boot, Draco began to work at removing the stained material. He sliced carefully. After a few minutes, it fell away. Draco cursed. It was worse than he thought. Harry must have been whipped at least twenty times, probably more. They were fresh, most still oozing blood, sluggishly. And the wounds were irritated, like something had been rubbed into them. Or … the whip had been coated in something beforehand. He frowned, looking closer. The skin not cut open, was covered in scars. As if from a previous lashing.
Draco glared at the slime masquerading as nobles in front of him. He really wanted to hear what they had to say for themselves. How they would play this off. How they would justify their actions. Of course, nothing could save them from their fates, but it would be amusing to see them try.
“Mr. Hadrian Mort is here to access his account. It’s under the name Harry Potter and for some odd reason was not changed when I adopted young Hadrian. An oversight of course, right.” His father’s voice was cold and emotionless and Hadrian kept his face schooled to a bored, emotionless look as well.
“All my life,” Harry answered, “I don’t remember a time when I didn’t.” He rubbed a hand through his hair, which hung loose, just brushing his shoulders.
Draco smirked, settling back against Hadrian. “Oh, this is too good. Dumbledore will have trouble explaining himself to the board when they hear about all this. I'll be sure to write to Father about rumors of a Cerberus in the castle so he can bring the Board to investigate, before the old man has time to cover his tracks.”
The door cracked open and Lyra poked her head out. She raised a pale eyebrow at him. “Yes?” she asked.
“Well you can’t refuse because that would look suspicious so all I can say is don’t eat or drink anything he offers.” Draco said softly taking out their Potions textbook, “Until then help me with my homework because Professor Snape may be my godfather but that doesn’t mean he’ll lay off me.”
Silence reigned for a second, then Severus replied, “Change course to the nearest planet that supports your bill.”
“So,” Blaise said, “Now that we’re alone without listening ears, what did you want to talk about Draco?” The Italian lifted a judgmental eyebrow. “That was what you were eluding to in the library, was it not?”
Oops. This one is nearly five times the length ... *shrug* oh well, that's how it worked out according to my outline for this story.
“You know necromancy is illegal. You’ll go to Azkaban for just owning a book about it. It’s really dark stuff.” The boy said smugly. Now Hadrian was annoyed. He marked his page and snapped the book shut.
“You’ve been very naughty. You could have continued on your demented way, but you extorted the wrong students.” He slowly pulled out a gun from the holster on the small of his back, screwing on the silencer. “Vadim Kuznetsov sends his regards. You should have never messed with his children.”
Remus nodded and clapped the younger man on the shoulder. “I’m glad,” he responded, “Also, you’ve been summoned by McGonagall to appear before the Council.” Harry blanched, but Remus was quick to reassure his former Padawan. “You’re not in trouble,” he said, squeezing Harry’s shoulder, “It has to do with a new mission. An important one. Highly classified.”
I break down into sobs. There was no stopping it. I sink to my knees, keening as I clutch the wand to my chest. I am hysteric; I am screaming out my grief and my heartache. The noise must have woken Tia, because she comes stumbling down the hall to me.
Draco frowned. “No, Dursley lands are much further to the south. I did not ride that far this morning,” he said, “And they do not have enough land for an orchard this size.” He motioned around them. The orchard they were standing in was vast, at least thirty acres, probably more.
There was silence, then the quick pattering of feet. The door suddenly opened and a little body slammed into him. “Draco,” his little sister crooned, “You’re back. I’d thought you had left. Left me here. Alone.”
Cas stared out the window, absently tapping his fingers on the tabletop. Snow fluttered to the ground outside. The countryside was blanketed in white. It was gorgeous, but Cas felt cold, both in mind and body. Hadrian was the one that loved winter. He felt his son’s absence like a gaping hole in his chest. The boy being away for so long was wearing on him. Add in all the nonsense with his guardianship and the hearing, Cas just wanted to have his son in his arms again.
The older man shifted in his seat uncomfortably. Draco knew how much the bigotry of this planet bothered Severus, almost as much as it upset Draco. That was why Severus ran away to Coruscant for college, not planning on ever coming back. The man only did because Sirius asked him. Severus did not know Sirius told Draco that, and he had no plans of ever telling the older man that he knew.
He heard Harry’s steps as the man walked to the side and down the stairs. The crowd parted for him as he made his way to the platform. Many of the people recognized him from markets, and remembered all the horrible treatment he withstood. He could plainly see that the people wanted to reach out, to touch him, but they feared, because Harry was now a noble.
“There. You look the part of a Pureblood even though you’re really just a Halfy.” Draco said playfully. Hadrian sent him a glare but didn’t reply. By this point the train was slowing down and the two boys began to put everything away that they had pulled out of their trunks.
Dropping the basket, Harry knelt and picked up several apples off the ground. Straightening, Harry threw one with all his might at the nobleman. It connected solidly with the man’s shoulder. “Thief!” he shouted, getting ready to throw another.
“It’s so sad,” she murmured, “The trees … they’re not maintained. They’re overgrown. And so many apples. Everywhere. A few have sprouted.” She waved her hand back at the wall behind him. “That wall.”
For this story, I will be posting lots of short chapters, unlike "Love Lost & Found in Space" which is structured as few long chapters. This also means I will post more often, because it will take me less time to write the chapters. Yay!
Severus sighed. “I’m not going to lie,” he answered, “It is bad. I did what I could to stabilize him. He needs more help than I can give with a basic med-kit.”
Severus rolled his eyes in annoyance. Draco recognized that expression from his childhood when he was being particularly obstinate or argumentative. Harlan was about to get a tongue lashing, and no one gave better ones than Severus.
Pushing away from the wall, Draco checked his crown to make sure it was still in place. He meandered through the crowd on his way to his throne. He paused briefly to give Harry’s shoulder a squeeze and Luna a soft kiss on the cheek. His eyes boar into Harry’s as he did. Soon, he could show the true depth of his affection for the man in public, but now was not the time.
It did make sense why no one else was able to create a Philosopher’s Stone. The book was rare, and very ancient. Amongst the rituals and processes, there were sprinkled crumbs of the author’s life. The man had worked with a partner for everything in the book, before the partner was murdered by an angry mob and the author fled for his life, hiding the book away. That meant there was, at minimum, one other book about what the pair had learned. Flammel must have that other book. Flammel was so secretive about the stone and how he made it. Every academic has been curious over the centuries, but the man had been tight lipped. Every other alchemist has failed, because they do not have the correct process.
As a forewarning, the next chapter will take me a while, because I haven't planned it out yet. This chapter was long and took forever, but I had already mostly planned it out while I was writing the first part. Sorry guys.
Draco hugged her back. “Never, Lyra,” he said, running his fingers through pale blonde curls, “If I was running away, I would take you with me.”
Remus softly cleared his throat, hoping to gain the other man’s attention without startling him. Slowly, Severus slipped a ribbon, long and shiny and black, between the pages and closed the tome. He sighed before looking up.
The other man’s eyes widened as he looked inside the pouch. If Draco would hazard a guess, he would say the man had never seen that much money before in his life. “But sir,” he started, looking at Draco with bright emerald eyes.
Harry sighed. He rested the basket against his hip and started to make his way to the orchard. The walk seemed to take forever that day, but eventually he reached the orchard. He walked under the tall trees, the dappled light shining softly down on him. It was peaceful. Calm.
The man spoke. “Do you mind?” he asked with a faint British accent, nodding to the empty chair at Draco’s table, “Everywhere is full.” And it was true. The coffee shop had been getting progressively fuller as the afternoon wore on. “I promise not to be a disruption.”
, the home planet of his good friend and collaborator on the bill, Senator Granger, when the intercom buzzed again. Draco absently answered it.
A couple months had passed since the execution. Draco had watched as Harry flourished. It was as if a weight had been lifted from the man. He had become the Comte he was born to be. The expensive clothing was now like a second skin; he was no longer self-conscious and uncomfortable in the fancy garb like he was at the beginning. Harry had absorbed all the proper etiquette, and no one would know he was not raised in the nobility. He could navigate the courtiers with ease. He could verbally joust with the best of the court gossips.
If Harry had the strength, he would have shrugged at those thoughts. What did it matter? He did not presume to know the minds of nobles. How could he? He was just an orphaned servant.
“Well, let’s see what it says.” Cas said as Hadrian climbed onto the bed and curled himself into his father’s side.
“What happened?” he breathed, crouching down next to Harry. He reached out like he was going to touch his shoulder.
After a moment, he glanced up and saw the older man mirroring him. “I pozdrav za vas,” he said, “Jedi …” He trailed off, glancing up at Harry in question.
Severus rubbed his hand over his face, which caused a faint rasping sound from his barely-there stubble. “That’s a long story,” he said, “But simplistically, I administered initial aid on route from Čarobnjačkom.”
The man then turned to Harry. “I am so sorry, my lord, for everything I did,” he said, then swallowed thickly, “Especially lying to get you in trouble for my party.” He ducked his head in shame.
I decided to have her branded for several reasons. Though she is technically a servant, she is a different type of servant than others. She is a criminal serving a punishment. In this universe, servants that were criminals are branded to denote their status. Even after they have served their punishment, they will bare the mark of their actions for the rest of their lives. There are still other servants, both paid and indentured.
Hadrian played happily with Bartholomew in the lush woods that surrounded his father’s home. It was Halloween and Harry had just turned five this year. Father had told him that he would raise him a wolf pup to play with if he was good today. So Hadrian found himself playing tag with an undead wolf. He didn’t understand the meaning of the word ‘undead’. Father had told him he would learn in time, that Father would teach him how to make his own companions. So Hadrian would never be alone. He hated being alone. In that way, he was just like his father, though they looked nothing alike. Giggling, he never noticed how Bartholomew kept him in hearing distance of the cottage, far closer than they normally played. But it was Halloween, the Day of the Dead. And dark things woke on this day.
Draco smiled as the other man approached. He was glad to see him. The warm, fuzzy feeling in the chest that blossomed every time he was in Harry’s presence spread through the rest of his body. The news he had to share dampened the mood a little, but not enough to wipe the smile off Draco’s face.
markings a harsh black against the pale skin and bruises. Draco turned back to the door, waiting for it complete the unlock sequence and open. It was hard for Draco to reconcile his childhood friend with the powerful Jedi Knight he met with the bruised and battered man lying on a blanket spread over supply crates.
Draco gave her a death glare. That underhanded move was very Slytherin. He unfortunately had to give her that and grudgingly admitted that he approved of its Slytherin qualities.
, he threw apples at me. One hit my shoulder, and now it is probably bruised.” He pouted a little, trying to get some sympathy, but his sister just laughed at him. With a sigh, he reached into the bag and grabbed himself an apple. Dieu, they were delicious. Silence reigned as the siblings ate their apples.
Lucius smirked. His uncle really enjoyed showing Haydrien off. “May I introduce, Haydrien Black?” he intoned, waving a hand toward Haydrien.
“It’s real. Go grab some parchment, we’d best send them a reply. And fetch Hedwig, we don’t want to scare them by sending an undead owl.” Cas said and Hadrian chuckled darkly. He bounced off the bed and darted out of the room only to be back in a flash. Cas wrote out a brief reply before casting a quick drying spell on the ink and attaching it to the snowy white owl’s leg and releasing her out the window.
Harry's job often took him to obscure places around the world. As it can be deduced, he tracked down former-Death Eaters that scattered in the wind after the Dark Lord's death, as well as the occasional other Dark witch or wizard. And, he was the best at it. I am a Potions Master, but I work from home to care for Tia. She has the prettiest amber eyes and silky strawberry blonde hair. Even at age three, I know she will be a heartbreaker. We were perfect together as a family. Harry and I were raising Tia how neither of us were, giving her a loving family and a carefree existence.
So I have about seven more chapters planned (six and then an epilogue) right now. Maybe one more, if I feel like the story needs it. =)
They walked through the halls, heading to the Intense Trauma wing. Healer McLaggen stopped in front of a room and waved the pair forward. Hermione took a steadying breath, steeling herself to what she would see. One of her best friends, gravely injured. She pushed open the door and went inside, Dr. Snape following her.
Remus shook his head at the memories. “He told me he made the name Harlan for himself, drawing upon the name his childhood nickname.” He looked down at the young man with soft eyes. “When he passed the Jedi Trials, he gave himself the last name ‘Wolfe’, after me.” He chuckled softly, glancing up at Severus. “Harlan thought it was hilarious, because I’m a Lupyne. I was both touched and exasperated with the boy. I rolled my eyes at him and messed up his hair. Then I pulled him into a hug and told him I was proud of him.”
At the front were the royal family. The King looked regal, but his expression blank. While he accepted Draco’s decision, he would have preferred his son marry a woman, not tie himself to a man. Narcissa looked radiant in her
Draco finally reached Lyra’s door, the guard looking distressed. It seemed that even her guards had not been exempt from her temper. With a glance down to his bag at his side, he knocked on the door.
He was cut off by the sound of a lightsaber igniting. They looked up to see, through the branches, the Knight swing his deep indigo saber. A moment later, Harlan stepped into the enclosure made by the branches.
“We need to go,” he said, a fierce stubborn glint in his emerald eyes, “I just destroyed an assassin droid. There could be more. I need to get you back to Coruscant, where you’ll be safe.”
The blond smiled down at him, tucking a piece of hair behind Harry’s ear. “You’re in the palace. The grand castle,” he answered, then smirked softly, “In my rooms.” Draco winked.
Draco sighed, resisting the urge to pull at his collar. Why, today of all days, did the weather have to break and the sun beating down on everything? Normally, the heat would not bother him. He would just wear a loose shirt, but not today. He was wearing his ceremonial clothes, which were heavy, and thick, and itchy.
A look of grief flashed across the man’s face, and he sighed. He walked over and leaned against the desk. “Yes, it was a shame, what happened to them,” he said, “They were too young.”
“You know me well. Now to start off, the prophecy that dear Snape heard was a fake. Dumbledore set it up. He wanted the Potters out of the way, they were becoming too dark for his likings so he had the Dark Lord do his dirty work for him. Peter is also in Dumbledore’s pocket. He’s currently hiding as the pet rat of the awful Weasley’s youngest son. The Dark Lord himself is not dead, he is currently in hiding. I’ve been looking for one of his Horcruxes, the one you’re currently in possession of will work.” Cas said in a very conversational tone but all the while Lucius’ mind was slowly being blown
“And because you do I must decline. Of course, I can always write to my father and tell him you are keeping me from my studies.” Hadrian said, his voice never darkening but remained polite and calm.
Dr. Snape nodded at the words, and Hermione had to agree. She understood that precaution. Back when she was fifteen, she broke her ankle. It was fixed right away, but she had to wear an immobilizing boot for two weeks.
“That is not a conversation I wish to have in public. Do you remember that cottage you found, the one we were going to run off to before you learned of your betrothal?” Cas said
While it was a shock, to realize someone had been murdered so close to campus, Harry did not feel that affected. Besides that one class, Harry never interacted with the man. He was not sadden by his death. Mostly, he was just unnerved that it happened and that the police did not have any solid leads. Oh well. Harry still lived on campus, as a Resident Director. He felt safe there.
Footsteps sounded outside in the hall, getting louder and then quieting again as the person walked passed the room. Remus glanced around, thinking. “I remember the last time Harlan had to spend time in a hospital,” he said softly, still rubbing the back of the young man’s hand, “Harlan was thirteen. He had been my Padawan for just over a year. At the time, we were at the temple, between assignments. I had been talking with some other Knights, when we got an alert that there was an altercation happening in the Padawan common area. We rushed there, and in the middle of the room, other Padawans looking on, were Harlan and another boy, fighting. Asena, it was a brutal fight. There were no weapons involved, but Harlan was dominating the fight, beating the other to a bloody pulp. It was only after we separated them that I discovered Harlan had a broken arm; he sure did not fight like he was injured.”
“And you want my help resurrecting the Dark Lord. What about Hadrian? It still doesn’t explain why you took him.” Lucius snapped
“What do you know of the Potters? Specifically Comte Jameson, Comtesse Lilian, and their child, Harold,” Draco asked, as if he genuinely wanted to know. And he did. Harry did too; he wanted to know how and why they thought it would be acceptable to take his lands and treat him, a Comte, like a slave.
Draco focused in on the head as the man stepped forward. “Granted,” he said, somehow managing to make that single word so condescending. Draco barely contained the urge to roll his eyes. The man waved the medical team forward. Draco almost sagged in relief as the team head up towards them.
He turned his head to take in his room, and saw Draco sitting in a chair beside the bed. He was reading, book open in his lap; he had not noticed Harry was awake. Harry attempted to push himself upright, the rasp of the sheets moving drew the blond’s attention. Silver eyes snapped to his, and Harry froze.
At Draco’s surprised eyebrow, Severus shrugged awkwardly, looking away. If Draco did not know better, he would have sworn Severus was blushing.
Harry smiled softly as he walked back. The day had been wonderful. It was nice to just relax, enjoying the sun, shade, and good food. The company had been great. Perfect.
Slowly, Draco lifted a piece of ribbon off his leg and marked his place. He closed the book, leaving it lay on his lap. He clasped his hands on top of it, staring at the pale digits for several moments. With a sigh, he looked back up at Harry.
Severus nodded. “Yes, I did,” he said, “How could I not? I raised him. I loved him, like a son I would never have. As much as I love Draconis, he is Lucius’ and Narcissa’s, the next heir to the throne. But Harry, as we called him, was mine.” He smiled softly down at the man in the bed. “Sirius loved him at well.” He chuckled wetly, tears back in his eyes. “Siri had this crazy theory. That Harry was the son of his best friend. He swore up and down that Harry was the spitting image of James.”
, can rule. King Orion had two children, sons names Sirius and Regulus, and Orion’s brother had three children, daughters named Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa. Sirius had no desires for the throne; it didn’t fit with his lifestyle.” Draco chuckled softly and winked at Wolfe. He leaned forward and whispered, “Siri was gay and shagging my tutor.”
Harry felt particularly indicated with her punishment. With all the horrible things she said that day, throughout his life, and all the work she had him do, it was fitting that she would get a taste of that same treatment.
It took him a few tries to find which room she was in, but eventually he did. They stood in what appeared to be a study; there was a desk, a couple of armchairs, and a magnificent fireplace. Lyra stood before the latter, a dust-stained linen in her hand. She was staring up at a painting on the mantel. Draco stepped beside her and looked up. His breath caught.
Slowly, Harry was able to gain control of his lungs and actually take in air. He blinked rapidly as his vision focused; he had not even noticed the spots until they were gone. He stared up into worried silver eyes. “Sorry,” he whispered, feeling embarrassed.
“Oh, move over,” Lyra whined, bumping him out of the way with her hip. She pulls a couple of pins out of her hair and stuck them into the lock. A short while later, the lock clicked and Lyra pushed the door open the door. She smirked at Draco’s dumbfounded expression and entered the house. Draco was hot on her heals.
Draco despised having to go back to Čarobnjačkom. Stepping foot on the planet just seemed to fuel his righteous anger further. He hated the archaic social structure of the planet of which he was now the Crowned Prince. How could they justify enslaving a large part of their population? Even with the dire consequences of bearing a Nečista Stvorenje, they made up at least twenty percent of the people living on the planet. Why did they execute
Soon, his ship was ready to go. Draco held it at a low hover above the landing pad. A few moments later, the warning light shut off. Draco smiled, angling the ship up and away from Čarobnjačkom at last.
Remus could plainly see the guilt written on the man’s face. “Severus,” he said softly, wishing he was close enough to touch the other man, “It was not your fault.”
Draco chuckled humorlessly. The man swiveled his chair to face Harry, propping his feet up against the console. “Then get comfortable, my Jedi friend,” he said, with a smirk, “because this will take a while.”
Harry woke to the bright sunlight of dawn streaming through the shutters. He sat up and stretched, glancing around his room. Tiny though it was, barely big enough for his cot and weather beaten trunk, it was his own. No one but him went into the small room off the kitchen; the Dursleys’ deemed it beneath them to enter a servant’s room.
Lord Malfoy sneered as the pair straightened up. It obviously irked the man that his son now outranked him. The man glanced at Severus for a moment before landing on Harry. His eyes narrowed in consideration. Harry mentally cursed; he needed to do something to distract Lord Malfoy before the man recognized him.
Draco found another book, an older one, that listed properties belonging to nobles. The one he looked through before was more current. Maybe this one would give other information. Halfway through the book, there was mentioning of a townhouse, in the town right outside the palace. Comte Nicholas Potter, father of Jameson, bought it for his wife. Maybe there would be answers there.
The man cocked his chin up, defiant, an apple still in his hand. “Who dares steal from Baron Dursley?” he demanded. Demanded. Of Draco, Crown Prince of France. He wanted to laugh, but wisely held it back. He did not want that apple flying towards him.
Lucius’ eyebrows rose. “Oh really?” he wirily replied, “Would it have anything to do with that glowing stone on the table?”
“I do not know what you’re talking about. I only adopted a young wizard that I found at an orphanage in muggle London. When I adopted him he had no guardian and was being picked on because he was different. If he was your godson, I’m sorry, but I will not give him up. He is the only heir I have.” Cas said lying through his teeth. It seemed Sirius knew this too because he snorted.
Some of these children were like Harry, were slaves, orphans. Alone in this galaxy. Survivors. But some were the opposite. Those were children of nobility, of merchants, of warriors. In a few moments, each would renounce their old lives and start on the path to become part of something greater than their previous allegiances.
“He tried to force his belief that I’m the only one who can defeat the Dark Lord like the prophecy wasn’t a fake.”
They made good time, reaching the village shortly. Again, people moved aside as they recognized the royal crest on the saddles. The pair reached the townhouse and dismounted. Draco tied the horses off on the fence where they could reach some of plants in the front garden. Harry looked very uncomfortable; he was still wary of attention and the crowded village roads did not help.
~ I was involved in a car accident. I wasn't injured, but my car was totaled (old car + wheel-well damage = totaled based on cost)
As he pulled away, he caught a grimace on Harry’s face. He wondered why. He pushed that thought to the back of his mind. “I’ve bought us some lunch,” he said, rubbing his hand through his hair, “ I thought we could enjoy some time alone. Together. Under the shade of these magical apple trees.” He waved his hand around, to the blanket spread out and the basket resting on it.
He stood up and stretched, his back creaking. He glanced out the window. He had been in there several hours, but there was still enough daylight left. Enough to go find this townhouse. To go find more answers. But first, he needed to go get Lyra. She would never forgive him if he went without her. On their way back, she shared that she found Harry fascinating as well. Her curiosity was peaked, and she wanted to know what happened with the Potters and the Dursleys.
, why would the Council send him there?” he muttered, seeming to dig around from something out of sight. The Knight made a noise of discovery, apparently finding whatever he had been looking for.
“He probably did not get approval,” Fred relied, glancing around the group. “He has so much power and influence.”
The man kept surprising Hermione. That he could rattle off those herbs’ stats off the top of his head like that … Impressive. Extremely impressive. Especially since the man was not a medical professional. Doctorate in biology notwithstanding. Ovinnik, but she was flustered. Brains had always been attractive to her; she wanted someone who could keep up with her intellectually. And, Dr. Snape was not horrible looking, very distinguished. She mentally shook her head, unnerved with her own thoughts. Besides probably being twice her age, the man was grieving. And, her friend was unconscious due to injuries from a fire-fight.
The book also contained instructions on how to use the stone. While the ritual for turning any metals into gold was fascinating, it was not a large draw for Cas, since he was very wealthy already. The complex use of runes and spellcasting was intriguing, but not useful. The Elixir of Life, however, was very useful. Thankfully, there was no human sacrifice necessary for the potion. In the most basic terms, the elixir is the combination of Draught of Living Death with the stone. Of course, that is the severely simplified and generalized version of the process. Each step of the brewing, even the ingredients, had rituals and requirements outside the normal process. It would take Cas months to get everything gathered as directed. He wanted to complete the elixir before the end of the school year, before his son came home.
When he was sixteen, right before he left for Coruscant to be Čarobnjačkom’s senator, Sirius told Draco about his best friend, James. James had fallen in love with a healer’s assistant. A Prljavštine Osoba named Lily. They had kept their relationship a secret, and everything was great. Until it wasn’t anymore. Though they had been careful, Lily was pregnant. She hid the pregnancy as long as she could, but it was discovered. The baby was tested and found to be
The other man shrugged off the words, wiping at his eyes. “Draconis came to the funeral, regardless of the danger to him, with Harlan as his Jedi protector,” he said, “And after the funeral and coronation, there was an assassination attempt. We slipped through the siege tunnels, and Harlan held the attackers off as we prepped the ship for takeoff. We all got out of there, but Harlan had apparently been hit.”
Harry was biting his lip, looking conflicted. He fingered the vest wore over his shirt. It was a different from the rest of his clothes; it was not worn down to the threads. It was nice quality, like what a noble would wear. After a moment, he shrugged it off, leaving just the shirt. He folded it in his lap. Draco tilted his head in confusion. The lining was dark red, but only on the back part. Dark red … like blood.
Lyra rolled her eyes at her brother’s antics. The lovestruck fool. If he was not careful with his affections, the King would find out before he declared his intentions.
She laughed at him. “That’s an elaborate way of saying you want to go back to the orchard. To see that feisty servant again,” she teased, “I accept your proposal. I’ll tell the guards to have our horses saddled by ten in the morning.”
. Reduces swelling, promotes the formation of tissue, and stops bleeding.” Dr. Snape smirked faintly, smug. “I approve of the mixture.”
Once there, Draco started flipping switches, priming the fuel cells. Out of the corner of his eyes, he could see Severus in the copilot’s chair, typing away. Draco pointedly ignored the blinking warning which indicated the landing hatch was still open. He would not be the one to deal with it; Harlan would once the Knight was on board.
Remus nodded. “Normally, it’s not,” he answered, “Not unless he is triggered in the exact right way.” He rubbed at his face, feeling a hint of stubble on his own chin. “Remember the civil war in the Toril system? It must have been covered one of the classes you took for your politics doctorate.”
Granger looked panicked and worried. She kept fiddling with the tear-drop emerald hanging from her waist chain. Her bodyguard, a ginger tabby Felidaen, stared stoically ahead, eyes zeroed in on the blaster in Draco’s holster. The bureaucrats’ reactions were most amusing. When Draco had announced himself, the head had looked faintly smug, like he couldn’t wait to make things difficult, and the rest wore similar looks. However, that changed when Draco stated Wolfe’s title. The group began to titter uneasily as the head paled. They knew they would face the wrath of the Jedi Council if they delayed in administering aid to one of their Knights. Draco bit back a smirk.
Draco had made good time back to the castle. The stable hands were shocked at the sight he made galloping on to the grounds: Harry laying across the horse in front of Draco, anger blazing in Draco’s silver eyes. Smartly, they did not asked questions. They just helped Draco down, settled the other man in his arms, and then went off to take care of the horse.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Still one for dramatic flares,” he muttered, as he and Harlan glanced through the doorway. Light was shining at the end of the revealed hallway.
They made it about half the way to the ship when shouts sounded across the way. Draco looked over and saw several people running down the ground staircase to the landing pads. People with blasters. Draco could feel himself start to panic. In front of him was physical proof that his own people wanted him dead. He could no longer deny the Chancellor’s words, and that terrified him.
“Your life, and title, will be spared,” Draco said, Dudley deflating in relief, “But ignorance does not fully excuse your actions. Therefore, the Dursley lands will be halved.”
Harry sat there, still in shock. They were going to Čarobnjačkom. In a few hours, he would be back on the planet he fled when he was seven. When the Jedi Knights found him, bought him from the Dursleys, and took him to Coruscant. And he was going with a Malfoy, one of the planet’s aristocracy.
Harry blinked in shock. “Really? Me?” he questioned, “Why me? I’m just barely a Knight. There must be other, more experienced and qualified Knights to do this job.”
Draco looked out further, passed the gardens, to the 'wild' grounds. That consisted of a variety of different landscapes, all flowing together perfectly. There was an expansive forest that melds into a marsh on one side and rolling fields on the other. There was a large lake in the fields, almost the size of a loch in size, and the bottom was fathoms below the surface. The far side of the fields was a dry terrain that then led into a rocky mountainside with many volleys and caves. The mountains slowly disintegrated with a magnificent waterfall. The river meandered through the gentling slope as trees appeared and became the swamp. It was all very magical and harmonious.
There, a ways in front of him, was a horse, tied off loosely to one of the trees. Harry crept slowly to get a better look. Dieu, it was a magnificent horse. Shining black coat that reflected the sun like a raven’s feathers, with a meticulously manicured tale and mane. The animal was also wearing a beautifully crafted saddle and bridle: gleaming leather with intricate patterns worked into the material. This was a horse of one of the nobility. And there, picking apples off a nearby tree, was that nobleman.
“The only kind of necromancy that is illegal is the raising of human dead and or making Inferni. I myself only raise small things like owls and wolves but if you keep pushing me I might raise something like a basilisk to stop you from annoying me.” Hadrian said sharply. He didn’t really have the capabilities to raise any magical creatures but this buffoon didn’t know that. And from how pale he got the threat had worked.
“Alright. Come in and shut the door. We don’t want any more idiots listening in.” Hadrian said and the twins hurried to comply. They sat down across from each other and grinned
“Don’t worry Hadrian. I’m sure they will be fine.” Draco said softly, putting a hand on Hadrian’s shoulder.
It is 9:30 am. There is no letter. This is not right. Currently, I am sitting in my squishy chair, staring out the window, looking for our black-capped screech owl. His recent letters sit on my lap. The anthology is also on my lap. It is actually really good. There are many different types of love poems in it: true love, addictive love, abusive love, unrequited love, and lost love. I read through the entire book, skipping the ones about lost love. I do not want to think about that because I have a feeling that something is terribly wrong.
The blond cleared his throat, looking down at the three before him. “You have been found guilty,” he began, “And thus, here are your sentences.”
“Here comes Weasley.” Draco hissed and Hadrian looked up to see the youngest male Weasley headed their way.
“Thank you, Drakie. Now I can get you ready for your big, amazing party!” She ended this speech with malicious laughter.
Draco smiled and stood up. “I love coming here. Seeing you,” he said as he dug through his saddle bags for the records the old servant from the townhouse gave him, “There’s something I need to tell you.” He paused for a second, gathering his thoughts. “Remember what Lyra and I asked you about? About the Dursley’s? It has to do with that. Somewhat.”
Lord Malfoy briefly wrinkled his nose in distaste before dismissing the news. “Come,” the man commanded as he turned his back to them, “The funeral will begin shortly.”
The other man nodded. “Yes, he was Draco’s,” he said, “His companion. Until they were five, I took care of and educated the pair of them.” A wistful smile graced Severus’ harsh features. “They were thick as thieves. Until Lucius found out.” The smile melted to a scowl as anger danced in those lavender eyes. “’It wouldn’t do for a prince to be so close to a Nečista Stvorenje’ he had said. And then, Harry had been sold away.” Severus shook his head, closing his eyes as if pained. “I tried to find him, but nothing came of it. It’s impossible to track down someone that the society doesn’t consider to be a person, without a name or any kind of identification. Sure, all transactions involving Nečista Stvorenje were documented, but in the files, there is no way to tell one Nečista Stvorenje from another. Even Sirius tried, but even with the resources of the Crown Prince could we find anything.”
Severus sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. “There is a blaster burn up the entire left side of his torso,” the man began explaining, “It probably happened during a spin. Jedis favor those in their fighting styles, since it gives their sabers more momentum and maneuverability. However, it also creates more vulnerability when facing advisories from multiple directions.” Severus shook his head. “I kept saying it was a stupid move.” Severus caught himself, getting back on topic. “The burn is deep. I’m very surprised Wolfe managed to get in the ship before collapsing.”
Draco was standing next to his parents, with Harry by his side. Another formal ceremony. This time, it was Lyra’s wedding. The previous month, there had been a festival to celebrate the Princess’ seventeenth birthday, and that is when the announcement of her engagement occurred. She will be married to Prince Oliver, third son of King Godric of Belgium. Apparently, this union had been in negotiations for over a year, which explained why the King and Queen of Belgium had been at his and Harry’s union.
Without addressing them, Draco began. It was a power play, to accentuate how little the court thought of them. That had made Harry smile when Draco had told him about the plan. “You were summoned here to stand trial,” Draco announced. The Dursleys all pale.
Harry. He had grown and changed since we last saw him fifteen years ago. Calling him Harry and not Harlan, as he introduced himself, shows that we only see the child from the past. That disregards the man of the present. That says everything he did to become Jedi Knight Harlan Wolfe is meaningless. I call him Wolfe because he is not the child I knew. He is a powerful warrior to be respected.”
That was … concerning. He remembered taking “Intro to Economics” with Dr Piers as a freshman in undergrad. It was just to fill a Gen-Ed requirement, and the class was huge. He never got the vibe from the professor that he was sleazy enough to pull this. He just seemed like any middle-aged man teaching economics to a room of barely-adults who could not care less about the subject.
“Just all the things we’ve seen and overheard at home,” George stated, “Paints a picture, if you can think for yourself.”
Thinking about Harlan Wolfe occupied his through the insincere eulogy and the dull crowning ceremony. The Knight had known the greeting ritual. Why would he know that? How would he know that? Krv Čista rituals would be too obscure to be taught as part of a Jedi’s training. The fact that Harlan did not stumble over the words added another layer to the intrigue. Maybe the Knight spent time on Čarobnjačkom, enough to learn the customs.
“I’m not getting into one of those. I’m afraid of drowning.” Said a mousy boy behind Hadrian. He looked at the boy and smiled.
After about an hour, Harry was distracted by a chair scraping. Draco had stood up, gathering up the textbook and his bag. Harry tried to keep his face neutral, but he could tell it fell some. He really enjoyed studying with the other man.
There, in oil, was a couple. A beautiful woman, with dark auburn hair and bright emerald eyes. Familiar emerald eyes. A handsome man, strong and proud, with raven waves pulled back at the nap of the neck. All so familiar.
“Very good Mr. Mort. Now try and change it back.” Professor McGonagall said as she made her rounds. Draco, who was still struggling to make the needle he had created pointy muttered
The other boy their age, with dirt smudged on his nose, stepped forward, his face reddening in anger. “What is he saying?” he shouted as he pointed an accusing finger at Haydrien, “I heard the word ‘Weasley’ with whatever language that was!”
Harry groggily blinked his eyes open. The ceiling above him was white and plain, and a faint beeping could be heard. Great, he was in a hospital. He thought back over to what happened. The assignment.
He tried to think back, but his memory was hazy. He remembered being dragged out of bed. He shuddered … the whipping … And then, the Baroness, throwing clothing. Chores. The orchard. Draco.
"Correction, Hadrian was your godson." Cas said coolly before he, Bartholomew, and the sleeping child all simply faded into nothingness, as if they had never been there at all.
Remus looked back down at Harlan, rubbing his thumb against the back of the hand he was holding. “So,” he murmured softly, “You met Harlan when he came with Senator Malfoy?”
Albus Dumbledore sat at an outside table at Fortescue's watching as the dark-haired boy said goodbye to Draco Malfoy. Beside him was the elusive Lord Mort, a tall, wiry man with wine red hair and, Dumbledore knew from the man’s time at Hogwarts, black eyes. So Lord Mort had adopted Harry Potter, effectively destroying all Dumbledore’s carefully made plans. The man had probably corrupted the boy so much, taught him dark magic. Magic that should have been banned a long time ago but was kept legal because of Lord Mort’s influence. The damned man had more influence than even Dumbledore and in more countries too. He even had Gringotts under his control, keeping the goblins placated with an undead dragon that guarded the oldest and most powerful families' vaults. The man was also a Death Eater but it could never be confirmed. He had no mark, no one could prove anything. It was infuriating. The boy smiled at Lord Mort like he hung the moon and it made Dumbledore's blood boil. Harry should look at him like that, He was supposed to teach the boy the way of the wizarding world, him and good magical families like the Weasleys. Not Dark families like the Malfoys and the Morts. Or even Black. There was too much darkness in those families. No, Dumbledore would have to bring the boy back to the light. Harry Potter was supposed to be the savior of the wizarding world and he would be.
He led Harry to the bench. When the man was seated, Draco stood before him. He cleared his throat. Nervously, he shifted from foot to foot, his hand reaching into his pocket for the ring.
The Knight stepped forward to peer into the dark, his lightsaber out to the side. “If they are that old, how do we knew they are safe?” he questioned with a glance to Severus, “How will we know where we are in these?”
With a faint chuckle, Draco slipped through the mostly empty corridors. It was early, only a few servants around to see him. The chief gave him some bread and cheese, wrapped up in a cloth. He returned to his quarters, knocking softly before entering.
that pulled around her, her hair pulled into an elaborate hairstyle with her crown resting atop. She glanced over to Draco and smirked slightly; she was just as excited to justice served. Apparently, Baroness Dursley had been unbearable before she was married, being snide and rude, and his mother was eager to knock her off her high horse.
“My apologies, Hadrian. Please come sit. Would you like some tea?” Dumbledore asked as Hadrian sat across from him.
Lyra rolled her eyes at his antics. “It’s perfect, stop being dramatic,” she said. When Draco raised his eyebrow, she raised hers back at him. “What are you, scared?”
Harry stumbled over a root, and Draco stood up. Something was wrong. The other man wavered again. He made it the man’s side just as emerald eyes rolled up. Draco caught him as he collapsed.
customs: Harry had firsthand experience, observing it play out many times. It all made sense. Except one thing. Why didn’t Harry, or Harlan, tell him? Why not say he was Draco’s childhood friend?
Harry could see the panic growing in their eyes. He was morbidly curious about how they would try to talk themselves out of this. But there was nothing they said that could save them now. They would pay for what they did to him.
Draco helped the man up into the saddle. Thankfully, Harry knew how to ride. That would be one less thing he would need to be taught. It was a long list, of everything Harry needed to know to be one of the nobility. Draco climbed up into his own saddle. The other man nudged his horse to follow Draco as they rode out of the palace.
On that note, she turned back to the Healer, waiting for him to continue. Absently, she noticed Dr. Snape lean forward in his chair, also looking towards the Healer.
Up three flights of stairs Draco went, and then down the hall to apartment “3C”. He knocked three times. Nothing. He frowned. The man should be here; Draco did not see him leave. He knocked again, more forceful. This time, he heard movement inside. A grunt or two, some shuffling, before finally the door cracked open, chain stopping it from opening more than a couple inches. Piers looked very disheveled.
Lyra scrunched up her face, sticking out her tongue, and she shut the door in his face. A few moments later, she flounced out of her room, spinning around in a circle. “Happy?” she asked petulantly, as her skirt continued to sway from the movement.
He surfaced from his musing, realizing he had been lost in memories for a great deal of time. A quick
Remus nodded. That sounded more suited to the other man. What with the doctorate in Biology and all. He then frowned. What else happened? What happened to lead to Harlan being in the hospital?
Lyra just laughed at him, moving around the entryway. Draco shook his head at his sister’s antics and looked around. Though it was simple and aged, there was a grandeur to the small dwelling. It was obvious that a noble had lived there, but not for many, many years.
Lastly, Draco came before Dudley. The young man looked terrified, but resigned. Though he had flinched slightly as his parents’ sentences were read, he had not protested. He understood that they deserved that. Now it was his turn to face judgment.
After hanging up on Draco, Hermione freaked out. Harlan was hurt. Harlan was unconscious on Draco’s ship. Harlan, who was supposed to be on a recruiting mission, had been Draco’s bodyguard to Čarobnjačkom. Oh Ovinnik, what should she do?
“He does whatever he wants,” George continued, “No one questions him, and if they do, he says it is for the greater good.”
The sound of a shuttle landing brought Draco out of his thoughts. It seemed his Jedi protector had arrived. He rolled his eyes as he stood up from his seat. He did not need a babysitter, no matter what the Chancellor or Master McGonagall thought. He walked down the gangway to the pad to meet them, wondering what the Knight would look like.
“My name is Hadrian Mort. I don’t care who you are or if you’re a first-year. I don’t plan on being in Gryffindor, I plan on either being in Ravenclaw or Slytherin. Probably Slytherin so that I can be with Draco. Please leave this compartment and don’t come back.” He said in a calm voice. His face betrayed no emotion. The redhead, Ron Weasley, stared at him shocked
There was no way that the Jedi Knight before him was Harry. The boy he knew was still on Čarobnjačkom. Still a slave. Before he left the planet, Draco had tried to find Harry, but nothing turned up. Trying to find a Nečista Stvorenje in their society, which does not treat them as people, is impossible. And it was beside the point. Wolfe wasn’t even Nečista Stvorenje. Actually, Draco didn’t know exactly what species the Jedi was. He was probably a Lupyne, what with his last name and all.
“The Dark Lord, obviously,” Hadrian replied, “The man survived that Halloween night. My father knew of the safeguards he made against mortality.”
“And they enslaved the race,” Severus finished, a perspective look in his eye, “This relates to Harlan’s fight because …?”
“You’re Harry Potter, aren't you? My name’s Ron, Ron Weasley. I’m a first-year too. I plan on being in Gryffindor, like the rest of my family. I hope that we can be roommates.” The boy said. Hadrian blinked once slowly before responding
Harry chuckled softly, standing at the blond’s shoulder. “Of course,” he answered, “Whatever you say.”
She stretched up to pat at Draco’s cheek before flouncing to the door. She opened it and paused, glancing back at him. He did not trust that look on her face. “I’ll let the cook know to pack extra food in our basket,” she announced, “I’ve been rather hungry as of late. Like I could two whole meals instead of one.” She laughed again, then left.
The other man glared, walking forward. “Yes, they are,” he stated, “Baron Dursley owns this orchard. And the apples.” He nodded towards Draco’s forgotten saddle bag.
“Draacooo,” she whined, collapsing against his chest. In their struggles, they ended up lying flat on the chaise. When they were alone, propriety tended to go right out the window. With one last laugh, Draco lowered the bag and handed it to Lyra. Draco grunted as she elbowed him in the stomach on her way to sitting upright.
Hermione’s musings were interrupted by a Healer entering the waiting room. He glanced around at them all before speaking, “We contacted Knight Wolfe’s listed next of kin, Knight Noir. He is in transit to Felidae, but we cannot divulge medical information over hologram. He did give us permission to tell you, Senator Granger – ” The Healer motioned to Hermione “ – and whomever initially administered medical aid.” The Healer then turned to the other man with a questioning look.
“All our lives, it was ‘pretty Lily’, ‘perfect Lily’, ‘wonderful Lily’,” the Baroness continued her rant, “And ‘why are you more like Lily?’. ‘Be like Lily’.” She started to wave her hands around. “I was the eldest! Yet she got everything! Better dresses. Prettier jewelry. And she married a Comte! A Comte! Why did my little sister get a Comte while I got this fleshy Baron?!”
Karkaroff greeted the Beauxbatons’ giant of a headmistress. The woman went to sit on the headmaster’s left and her students went to the first of the empty tables. Karkaroff remained standing. He looked at the students before he spoke again. “And, now, from England, our friends of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy.”
Right, she needed to contact Remus. He needed to know, and would want to be here with Harlan. Hermione really hoped the Knight was on Coruscant. She placed a call to the Jedi Temple and waited for an answer.
He saved me. I have always had feelings for him, even before I met him. I mean, who wouldn't? He was the one who defeated the Dark Lord as an infant. When I first laid eyes on him, I did not even realize it was the Boy Who Lived. All I saw was an endearing, skinny boy my age with messy jet black hair and vivid emerald eyes. I fell for that boy with the innocent, wide-eyed expression. Later, I realized that my green-eyed boy was Harry Potter. I was hurt by his rejection; thus, that began our rivalry. Over the years at school, we tried to best each other at everything. I won when it came to potions; he won when it came to being seeker.
Draco held up his hands in surrender, turning his horse around with his knees. “Whatever,” he said, “Do what you want.”
And finally, there, in front of him, was Draco. Words could not properly describe how handsome the blond looked, waiting there at the altar. And the smile the man sent to Harry … It made him weak the knees. He smiled back, just as happily, because this was the day they would be tied together forever. His knight in shining armor.
, full skirt and flowing sleeves, with yellow embroidery around the hems, necklace, and waist. Her hair, the Malfoy white blonde, was loose, falling to her waist in loose waves. It was scandalous to have it down like that at her age, but that was Luna. Draco smiled softly at the pair as they talked softly to one another. He was glad Harry had found a friend at court.
“So, Harry,” he said, hating himself to dragging this all up, “You said you worked for the Dursleys? Said this was their land?”
Harry slowly blinked his eyes open. He stared up at the ceiling. It was not familiar. It was way more extravagant and gilded than anything he had ever seen. He started to panic. Where was he?
In this reality, there is no Boy Who Lived. There is no Voldemort. The light and the dark still struggle for power, but there is no outright war between the two.
Draco watched as Harry climbed the stairs of the platform. The man took the axe from the executioner, weighing it in his hands. Draco smirked; there was a reason he requisitioned an axe for this instead of the standard sword. Harry had been raised a laborer, so an axe was more natural in his hand than a sword.
Silence reigned for several minutes before Draco decided to break it. “You will come back with me, won’t you?” he asked softly, “You won’t be appreciated here, now. I hate to say this, but they only put up with you because you had Sirius’ protection by being the Crown Prince’s consort. Not now. There would be so many opportunities for you to expand on your research in the capital.” He turned his head to look at the older man. “And I’ve missed you, Severus.”
Healer McLaggen glanced from Hermione to the other man. Dr. Snape. “If we could know what happened …?” he asked hopefully.
Harry nodded, following Draco out of the room and through the halls to the stables. His black stallion was waiting there in the courtyard next to a Knabstrupper stallion, the brother to Lyra’s mare. A gift for Harry, though the man does not know that yet. Draco planned for it to be an engagement present, just as soon as he proposed.
“You must be a Muggleborn if you think like that. And that old man can ban them from the library but he cannot say that I cannot bring my own copies in. That would be an infringement on my rights and he could be put in prison for that. Not to mention he would also be insulting the most powerful house in the Wizimongot.”  Hadrian said with a bored tone. The girl just glared at him before flaunting off like she owned the place. Draco waited a few minutes before telling Hadrian that they should probably change. While Draco was knotting Hadrian’s tie, because Hadrian had no clue on how to do it, he asked a very simple but very touchy question
The ceremony, as it progressed, was dreadfully boring. Draco wondered if his own ceremony had been like this. He almost felt sorry for everyone that had attended. He glanced over to Harry, and then, almost rolled his eyes. His consort, the love of his life, was asleep. Standing there, at the front of the cathedral, at his sister-in-law's wedding, was asleep. He focused back to the front when the bishop started the final blessing. He would tease Harry about this later, in private, and never breath a word of it to Lyra or anywhere she could overhear. She would kill them both, even if it was not Draco’s fault at all. He was guilty by association.
Vernon Dursley looked horrid. He was filthy, and his eyes, even from the distance, were vacant. Haunted. That could be because Petunia’s sentence was carried out the day before. Right in front of his cell. Duc Zabini calmly watched as two guards held her down, another forced her mouth open; the last held a knife in the flames of a torch mounted to the wall. Her husband kept shouting, pleading and sobbing, as the metal began to glow. Finally, when the blade was practically white, Petunia’s tongue was cut out of her mouth, the wound cauterizing instantly. Duc Zabini looked down at the writhing woman indifferently, holding the end of his cane into the flames. After a moment, he removed it and placed it against the woman’s neck, branding her with the Zabini crest. Vernon was a blubbering mess as Petunia’s unconscious form was carried away.
“I saw him. In the bank. He was with a man who called himself Lord Mort-” She rambled until he cut her off
“Headmaster told me to give this to you.” The boy said before handing him a note and trotting off to rejoin his friends. Hadrian opened the note and read the message
“Merde, he has a good arm,” he murmured under his breath. He raised his hands up in surrender, hoping another apple would not be coming his way. Wrong. There was another apple, this one coming at his head. He ducked behind a tree for safety. “Dieu, I surrender!” he shouted at the other man, “Please stop throwing apples at me!”
Harry was distracted from his panic by a beep on the console. It seemed that a communication was coming in. From next to him, he heard the Senator sigh heavily.
Draco’s eyebrows rose at the man’s state. It almost looked like … Draco rolled his eyes. A thud sounded from within the apartment. “You and I, Dr Piers, need to have a talk,” he said, his cold mercury eyes locking onto wide dull brown, “You should get rid of your company.” Draco was glad to have slipped on a beanie to cover his pale blond hair, since there would now be a witness that could possibly identify him.
When the hatch fully opened, there was a man waiting for them. He was a looming figure, with a large hooked nose. Lavender eyes stared blankly out of a haunted face. The man’s black hair hung limply to his shoulders, greasy like it hadn’t been washed in a long time. Something about him tickled Harry’s memory, but he couldn’t quite place why. And now was not the time.
Draco was gorgeous. It had taken a lot of courage for Harry to just approach the table. But everywhere else was full. For the undergrads, midterms were just the next week, so everywhere was full of students last minute cramming. The only seat was with the standoffish-looking Greek god of a man. Draco, a fellow Englishman. The man did not seem to like to talk, but he did not sneer or ignore Harry and his rambling. And then the almost flirting. The wink.
Draco felt his anger building at the man’s callousness about the members of his own court. His sister’s hand crept onto his leg, but it did nothing to calm him down. Mercifully, his mother spoke up before he verbally ripped his father to pieces.
Draco cringed. “Hello, Granger,” he said, “I’m sorry I didn’t contact you. I’ve been a little scattered at the moment.”
At the moment, the group reached the throne room, stopping before the ornately carved oak doors. The servant knocked twice, and the doors opened inward. Again, no announcement. Nothing at all. Holding her head high, Petunia took her husband’s arm and walked into the room full of courtiers, her son following just at her shoulder.
I'm putting this story up for adoption. Some stuff has happened in RL and I've been thinking a lot about it and I cannot continue this story. I am putting all my Harry Potter stories up but if you're going to adopt one choose your favorite, I'm going to only give one story to each person unless there is more stories than people. If that is the case than I'll let you know after a couple days. Please message me on tumblr if you're interested, my username is TragedyUndertheSky (duh). I'm really sorry guys, I really am.
The Dursleys are just about to face the consequences of their actions (I haven't decided if that will be on or off scene just yet *evil grin*). Soon.
The Prince in question stood at the altar. He was handsome enough: sandy blond hair with hazel eyes, decent build, just a bit shorter than Draco. The man was closer in age to Draco and Harry than Lyra at nineteen, maybe twenty? That was not too much of an age difference; there were much older princes that she could be marrying. Hopefully, Oliver would learn quick when to pick his battles. The princess was a force of nature. The prince was also very lucky. Lyra seemed to like the man, given their interactions over the month since her birthday. If she had not, Oliver would have a problem in the form of an angry older brother. Harry shifted closer, their arms brushing.
Severus stood up as well, glancing between the two men. “There’s a secret passage,” he said as he layed his hand on a large knot in the bark of the tree. Behind the trunk, a section of wall slid away to reveal a set of stairs leading down. “Sirius found these passageways when he was a child. They’ve been forgotten, but they were built as siege tunnels when the Palace was rebuilt during Čarobnjačkom’s last large-scale war.”
Haydrien arched an eyebrow at the pair of twins, standing a bit to the side of the rest of the group, with a young girl clinging to their sides. He then turned to Draco, a small smirk on his face. He decided to invoke a guise he loved using, since it gave new insights to people: the foreigner that did not speak English.
Harry pinched the skin of his wrist to anchor himself. “This is happening,” he whispered to himself, “I can do this. I can join with Draco. I can walk down that aisle and become his partner.” His breathing evened out, and he was able to stand back up. He straightened his clothing. It was even fancier than his normal Comte clothing, because he was being coming part of the ruling family. His family colors, red and black, prevail his attire: a blood red velvet duvet with the Potter crest embroidered on his breast over a black shirt, black leather pants into black riding boots,           black cap trimmed with fur, and finally, an ornamental sword attached to a jeweled belt. He felt a bit over the top, but it fit with the occasion.
. Somehow, even sprawled awkwardly across the lavender brocade, the man looked gorgeous. Way to gorgeous to ever be with little servant Harry. And this room was too much for little servant Harry. He needed to get out, before the luxury overwhelmed him.
Harry sighed. Now, the apples were only used for pastries. The Dursleys, Dudley in particular, did not like fresh fruit. The man would only eat a fruit or vegetable if it had been cooked, flavored, or sweetened. So many apples gone to waste. The orchard was huge, at least fifty acres.
It took the rest of the year for Harry to come to terms with his sexuality. During his fifth year, he explored that sexuality. In that time, Harry also learned that he liked to wear women’s clothing. Originally, it was a dare late at night in the Slytherin common room for Harry to put on a girl’s uniform. From that moment on, Harry knew that he wanted to dress like a woman. So, before the start of his sixth year, Hermione and Pansy gave Harry a makeover.
“I took Hadrian because Black would have always caved to Dumbledore’s wishes. Hadrian would have gone to live with some horrid muggle relatives who would have beat him until he was meek and cowed. I know. I Saw it. Dumbledore would have made him a puppet savior. I couldn’t let that happen. I Saw it for a reason.” Cas said putting emphasis on the words Saw.
The siblings watched as Harry just blinked, looking between the two. Then, he paled. “Dieu, you weren’t lying,” the man said faintly, “I’m going to die. I attacked the Dauphin.” He started to panic.
When the newly accepting Comte came to her for help to use a sword, Lyra had thought he was joking. But he had been serious. Harry had wanted to learn how to sword fight, because, apparently, that was on his list of things he needed to know now that he accepted his rightful place at court. She guessed she could see where he was coming from; every male of noble blood could wield a sword to some degree.
Harry barely held in a sigh. Apparently, Draco had decided to just go with the ‘lovers’ reason after all. Thankfully, the blond just implied verses explicitly stating the fact, else Harry would have a hard time explaining this to the Counsel in his report later.
“That is not my name. Now if you would excuse me I have friends to meet.” Hadrian said before leaving without saying another word. He found Draco, Theo, and Blaise in the library
“Come to my office after dinner. I like sherbet lemons.” With a sigh, he folded the piece of paper up and set it on fire. The old man wanted to drug him already. It wasn’t surprising, after all it would seem less suspicious if he broke off his friendship with Draco and became friends with the Weasley boy at the beginning of the school year rather than further in.
Draco had always wondered what happened to Harry. How did he turn out? What does he look like? Is he happy? There was also a question he did not want to ask, because he did not think he can handle the answer: does Harry miss him as much as Draco misses him?
Harry was looking pale. Paler than yesterday. There was an ashy hue to the normally gorgeous, rich olive skin. He mostly just nibbled at the food, though he did eat a decent amount. The man would shift slightly then wince, like he was stiff but moving to relieve that made something hurt. Merde, if those vile people hurt him again.
“The Comte Jameson Potter and the Comtesse Lilian Potter,” Lyra breathed softly, looking away to meet Draco’s eyes. In those matching silver eyes, Draco saw the same realization he had reached. Harry, the servant from the orchard, was the missing child of Comte and Comtesse. And the man had no idea who he was.
! He pushed himself up quickly, and promptly fell to the floor. He felt hands on him, helping him up and back into the bed. He barely noticed as he struggled to get enough air. His hand was pressed against a firm chest.
“You will go with him to his planet for a family funeral,” she said, “The planet is very pro-slavery, with centuries of cultural dependency on it. Thus, he will be very unpopular.” She looked over her glasses at the young man. “Protect him and bring him back to Coruscant safely.”
It was an interesting game. Though Viktor was flying circles around the Irish seeker, the other team’s chasers were dominating the Bulgarians. Viktor had abstained from catching the snitch in hopes that his team could close the gap, but it was just getting more and more embarrassing. He put an end to their suffering before it could get much worse. It was a brilliant display of talent, daring, and acrobatic flying as he grabbed the golden ball out of the air. Though as it stood, they still lost the match, even with the points gained from the snitch.
“by the way, there is something else I think you should know,” Severus drawled, “It seems our resident Jedi Knight is Nečista Stvorenje.”
While the old man had been lost in his thoughts, Draco’s fury grew within him. Everything started to piece together, and he did not like the picture it gave one bit. He reached out to clasp the old man’s shoulder. “Thank you for telling us,” he said, his anger tightly controlled, “The young Comte will return soon. I promise you that.”
“Dumbledore wants to see me later.” He said and Draco sat down beside him so that their knees were touching.
“Ah, Lord Malfoy, your timing is impeccable,” the man came forth, “Lady Malfoy, you’re a vision, as always. And Draco, you’ve grown into a striking young man.” His eyes danced over to Draco, before moving on to Haydrien. His eyes widening in surprise. In his defense, Haydrien does stand out against the porcelain blond family, with his faint tan and raven black hair. “And who might this young man be?”
He did not want to find Mr. Right there. This party was basically full of miserable men, desperate for a lay and willing to go anywhere to get it. Pansy did not know that he saw her pass out invitations to all men at three different gay Wizarding clubs; he had followed her. He was hurt that she thinks he would fall for someone here. He wanted to fall in love naturally, not through a set-up. He was not even sure he even wanted to even fall in love, actually.
One man could hardly take perfect care of all the acres of apple trees. Harry could barely keep the trees healthy. He could not pick all the apples of the trees, and even if he did, what would he do with all the apples. He could not take them to the market with the rye and eyes. He could only take what he could pull in the estate’s old pull cart, and the apples were not worth their weight to haul to market.
Harry grinned at the other two. “We all packed our warm winter clothes?” she asked. They nodded. “Our sexy winter clothes?” She wiggled her eyebrows.
The family of four looked on. Narcissa, disdain for the mess of blood on the ground. Draco, slightly pale but sneering at the dramatic display. Lucius and Haydrien both were masked with emotionless facade.
When he arrived at the office, Draco burst through the doors. He vaguely registered other people in the room, but his focus was on the man behind the desk. He strode forwards until he was standing in front of the man. “Chancellor Shacklebolt,” he said respectfully, nodding in difference, “I request brief leave from session to attend a funeral.”
After their hug, Dobby had removed the sheets from the chairs so they all could sit. Harry had nibbled on his bread, because his stomach was grumbling, now used to getting regular meals. Dobby began to tell him more about himself and his parents. He learned his mother had died in childbirth. He had been born here at the townhouse, but his father did not like staying in it for too long because of all the memories of his mother. He learned his father died in a hunter accident when he was four. Though he had finished most of his breakfast, he had lost his appetite when he learned the horrible truth: the Baroness was his aunt, charged with taking care of the estate and him.
Besides run-ins with the youngest Weasley and avoiding the old man’s manipulations, Hadrian had noticed something odd about their Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Quirinus Quirrell. A timid, stuttering man, seemingly afraid of his own shadow. Hadrian had learned that the man had previous taught Muggle Studies, before taking a brief sabbatical to travel. After that, Quirrell returned as their Defense teacher. The class was a joke. The students did not learn anything in class, unable to understand the professor. However, there were moments, moments that led Hadrian to believe that the man as they knew him was a front. Quirrell would stand tall, a smirk on his face for a moment, as if someone had said something amusing, but it was gone too fast to be noticed. Also, Hadrian had heard the man talking in his office, having what sounded like an argument, without his stutter. And over the past month, Hadrian would catch the professor staring at him, intently, like he was a puzzle he was trying to figure out. Mentally, Hadrian shook himself, coming back to his friends. Whatever was up with Professor Quirrell, they would figure it out later. Once the next term started.
So, I tagged "Survivor's Guilt - minor". Harry struggles with Survivor's Guilt, but very mildly. There is no self-harm, no suicidal thoughts. Harry will loses the motivation to get up and live: not getting up out of bed, not leaving the bedroom, not putting effort into outfits and appearances. There will only be one instance of this in the fic, and it will not be from Harry's perspective, so it will be described too much in detail. That being said, I will put a warning of it in the notes for that chapter (it won't happen for a bit, at least four or five chapters).
Harry had moved, now standing right before the painting. His hand rested on the mantel as his face was tipped back to study the details. Draco cleared his throat softly, causing the man to jump slightly. Harry turned to face them, and Draco heard Dobbeson’s breath catch in his throat.
The man gulped, rightfully scared. He nodded, going to shut the door. Draco stopped it with a hand. He had learned that from past marks; once they had seen him, they would try to run the second they were out of sight.
She does not understand exactly what I meant; she is too young to. However, she understands enough that she starts crying as well.
for the Crown Prince’s funeral and royal coronation. After the ceremonies, there was an assassination attempt in the palace gardens. The three of us snuck out of the palace to the ship. But there was an altercation on the pad. A fire fight broke out, and that was how Knight Wolfe got the blaster burn. Once on the ship, he collapsed from the burn. We assumed the fall caused his other injuries. We found him shortly after.”
Harry frowned. “No, they’ve lived here as long as I can remember,” he said, “And there is no staff, other than me.” He looked down at his lap, cheeks colored in embarrassment. “There used to be others, but with money being short, they had to let all the others go. I wasn’t, because they essentially own me.” He shrugged his shoulders. “I’m an orphan with nowhere else to go.”
Draco smiled slightly, waving his hand at the chair. “Have at it,” he said, letting his native accent color his words, “I’m not easy to distract.” He glanced back outside. The mark should be leaving his office soon; his last class ended thirty minutes ago.
for the funeral of the Crown Prince. How do you comfort an ex-lover over the death of their current partner? Remus was clueless, so he just settled for the simplest. “I’m so sorry,” he murmured.
Remus stepped into the room, and then froze. There, sitting on the far side of the bed from the door, was the last person he expected to see in that hospital room. Severus Snape.
Once they were in the forest, out of the sight of the castle, Lyra pulled on her reigns to stop her horse. Draco did not notice at first, continuing forward for several paces. When he turned around, Lyra was on the ground and digging through her saddle bag.
With the hand not holding the saber, Harlan grabbed Draco’s shoulder and shoved him towards the ship. “Get to the ship,” the Knight said, glancing between the two, “Senator, get it up and running, ready for takeoff.” Emerald eyes bored into Draco’s silver ones. “Set course for Coruscant. I’ll hold them off.”
The executioner pushed Vernon down by the shoulders, his neck extended over the block. The drumming increased to a steady roll as Harry stepped into position. The man glanced up at Draco, winked, and then swung the ax. The drums stopped. The sound of the ax embedding into the wood could be heard in the silence of the courtyard, followed immediately by a wet thud.
Draco barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes. “I can take care of myself,” he retorted, glaring as Severus snorted. He crosses his arms over his chest, pouting as they walked. “I do
Draco stepped aside and motioned towards the Knight. He watched as they carefully maneuvered Wolfe off the crates and onto the hover stretcher. As the passed on the way off the ship, one stopped in front of Draco. The woman offered him Harlan’s cloak and lightsaber, which he tentatively took. He stared down at them, no sure what to do.
Hermione and Dr. Snape stood up quickly. They both were eager to see Harlan. Hermione knew her reasons, but she was curious as to the other man’s. It is one thing to abstractly be concerned about an acquaintance, but that is completely different from being concerned for someone with whom you share a deeper connection. She felt the later of the two, and from what she could see, that was the same for Dr. Snape. She would greatly want to know why.
There will be more chapters coming soon (as in I'm currently writing them right now). According to my outline, there are four more chapters to this story =)
The mark looked nervous. Dr. Gillian Piers had reason to be paranoid. He had a nasty habit of exploiting grades for favors. Particularly those of the sexual nature. Draco scrunched his face in disgust. The man was not too old or too ugly, so there was no reason for his actions. So there was some other sick reason for what the man did. Maybe he got off on the power imbalance? Draco did not care. That was not part of his job.
?!” He looked like someone just told him that magic was not real. It was like his perfect fantasy was shattered.
Friends. Harry could not help rolling his eyes at the thought. Dudley did not have friends; he had sycophants. Lowly nobles, ones with hardly any power or money, that attached themselves to horridness of Dudley, just for his perceived influence. They did not actually like the man. They talked, and Harry overheard. No one paid any attention to servants.
Her husband and son were already seated in the carriage. For both them, the ties of their duvets strained against their large bodies. Again, she had wanted to get new clothing, that being a reason. But since they had to hire staff, there was no money for that. So they had to make do. Of course, the material was still of the finest quality, even though it was tighter than it should be.
“Probably. I haven’t talked to them in a few weeks. They’ll be glad I finally made a friend who’s not undead or an animal.” He said and Draco nodded. Hadrian often made calls to the underworld using a special potion and salt water. His father had never kept the fact that his parents were dead a secret and, though they had a problem with Cas at first, his parents were just happy to be able to see him grow up.
Harlan Wolfe watched as Master Flitwick led the new recruits further into the Temple to begin their training. He wondered if he was ever that small. That scared. That awed. More than likely, and grateful as well. Very grateful to be saved from his living nightmare that was his life on Čarobnjačkom.
Severus raised an eyebrow, surprised and impressed. “Did you find out what started the fight?” he asked, “From what I knew of him as a child and what I learned now, starting fights does not seem like part of Harlan’s nature.”
“Lord Mort.” The two voices finished in unison. The buffoon turned beet red before huffing and disappearing. In his place were two identical boys who looked to be a few years older than Hadrian and Draco
Draco’s eyebrows rose in surprise. He had not been expecting that. “Power to you,” he replied, “I would not have the patience to deal with children. Or really, anything living.” He smirked and sent the man a wink, which caused Harry to blush.
Draco grinned. “Perfect,” he said, standing up, “I’ll leave you to get dressed while I grab us some breakfast to go.” He pointed to the stack of clothes. “Wear those. They should fit.”
Draco waved away whatever protest the other man would have said. He attached the bag to the saddle and climbed up onto his horse. “Keep it,” he said, reigns in hand, “For the apples and your silence. Farewell …” He frowned. “I did not catch your name.”
The man blanched, then looked angry. “No, impossible,” he said, “You’re just pretending to be him. Which is a crime!” He raised the apple higher in threat.
A Slytherin acting sweet and innocent was never to be trusted. They were almost always up to no good. It was better just do as they ask because they would turn nasty when disobeyed. That was why Draco pushed the covers back and got out of the comfy heaven of his king-size bed. I stood up and stretched, feeling the snug cotton of his boxer briefs shift the movement.
She vaguely waved at him, shouting over her shoulder, “I’ll talk to you later. Promise!” And then, she was gone, following after the team and Severus.
Draco sighed in exasperation. He had told the other man of his family, his heritage, his title. But Harry did not believe him; he stubbornly held to the notion that he was the Dursleys’ servant. How one man could be so obstinate, Draco did not know. Draco was at his wits’ end. He had even showed the man the records he had found, but still he made no headway.
“Yeah, I am. Or, I’m in training at least. I’m nowhere as good as Father is. But I will be one day.” Hadrian boasted. The two boys wandered off, talking in hushed whispers about necromancy and other dark arts that they were learning.
“We both know you would have caved to Dumbledore’s wishes. You would have left the boy in an abusive home and gone after Pettigrew for revenge. You would have ended up in Azkaban, then later you would die. Dumbledore has Pettigrew in his pocket and if you help me I’ll tell you where he hid the disgusting rat.” Cas said turning away from the other man to skim the numerous books again.
Snape sighed, sitting back in his chair. “Of course,” he said, “I’ll start at the beginning. Knight Wolfe was assigned by the Council to be Senator Malfoy’s protection. Together, they traveled to
Draco looked out the window and sighed. The weather was meek and gloomy, the sky covered in threatening clouds. It matched his mood perfectly. He was the young Lord Malfoy, head of the Malfoy family after his father's recent untimely death. Now he has to deal with everything that comes with the title, including managing the family accounts, overseeing the manor, dealing with the staff of the manor and grounds. That was just what a sixteen year old needs. He got all the responsibilities of an adult while not being an adult.
“My name is Hadrian and I’m not your boy.” he said sharply. Dumbledore got a hurt look in his eyes that if Hadrian hadn’t known better he would have believed was real.
Draco turned to face the man. He shook his head. “Tsk tsk, where’s your patience, professor?” he questioned, going back to his bag. He pulled out a file folder and dropped it onto the coffee table, picturing slipping out.
further south, close to the southern coast. The lands he had been on, the lands Harry said were the Dursleys’, actually belonged to the Potters. Comte and Comtesse Potter. Draco had never heard mention of them, which frustrated him to no end. How could the court just
Draco grumbled softly as he adjusted the dials and levers in the cockpit of his ship. He hated having someone else fly it; they always messed everything up. The Jedi better hurry up and get there, because Draco was itching to leave.
With his poor eyesight, Harry could only discern the noble’s pale blond hair, but that did not matter. The man was a thief, stealing apples from the Dursleys. He did not know how or why, but he was sure it would get back to the Baron and he, Harry, would be blamed for the apples. He needed to stop the man.
Lyra thought that all over as they wove their way through the streets of the town. People moved aside, the royal crest on their saddles giving away their identities. “Was the child a boy or a girl?” she asked finally.
The shape that erupted next out of the right hand side figure’s wand was a large snake. Students with green badges smirked as they walked it to the left, the snake slithering and hissing over their heads. Draco smirked as well. “
Draco groaned, wanting to bash his head against the controls. “I hate bureaucrats,” he grumbled as he did a final check of the ship’s systems. Severus just laughed at the irony of Draco’s words.
The next minute there was a bang, followed shortly by the sounds of splintering wood. Apparently, Draco used up his allotted time musing to himself instead of letting in the woman. Thus, standing in the middle of his bedroom, was his dear friend Pansy Zabini neé Parkinson. He met Pansy at Hogwarts, both of them in Slytherin. He was not sure what exactly she saw in Blaise to marry him, but she seemed happy. That happiness had made her lay off Draco's lack of a love life, for a while, at least. Then, Pansy decided he needed an intervention. Supposedly, he was too serious, acting twice my age (He had gotten a cuff to the head when he argued that he was just acting like the adult he should be). So she had started ‘spicing up his life’. The latest transgression was Draco’s twentieth birthday party.
on a daily basis. In the senate, no one cared that he was royalty, and Draco loved that. He was just another senator, and he had managed to make a name for himself: the Dragon of the Senate. It had a nice ring to it, and it was completely accurate. Draco was ferocious, hot-tempered, stubborn, and focused to the point of obsession, just like a dragon. He remembered when his friend, Senator Blaise Zabini of Essos, took him to his home planet to see the magnificent creatures.
Severus stopped in front of hat appeared to be a completely random stretch of wall. With a smirk thrown over his shoulder at them, the older man pushed on a stone, and a section of wall slid aside.
Theo hummed, a curiously look on his face. “So, what is your father going to do with the stone?” he asked, “There are so many rumored abilities about it.”
, Draco thought, but now was not the time for that. He was on a job. No flirting or hook-ups on a job. He needed to stay focused.
Apparently, Draco had looked for him. Tried to find him, to free him. He wondered when the blond searched. How old was Draco? Probably late teens, so Harry had already been long gone from Čarobnjačkom. It warmed his heart to know Draco cared enough about him to try to save him. Even though he’d already been saved, it was the thought that counted.
Remus continued down the hall, reading the numbers next to the doors. He tried not to look into the rooms to preserve patients’ privacy. Finally, he reached the proper numbered door: 394. He took a deep breath before gently opening the door.
He had come to when his bonds were cut, collapsing heavily to the ground. He blinked up and saw the Baroness. She sneered down at him, throwing his shirt and a vest at him. “Wear that,” she had spat, “To cover the blood.” And then she had disappeared into the house.
“Sev,” Draco croaked, grief coloring the word, “I’m so sorry.” The blond wrapped the man up in a bone-crushing hug. The older man returned it just as fiercely.
Draco saw movement out of the corner of his eye and looked back at the people gathered on the pad. Granger had stepped forward. Well, given how her skirt still flowed around her legs, it seemed more likely that she tried to rush forward, and her bodyguard’s hand on her shoulder was the only thing that stopped her. The ginger leaned down to murmur something to her. Granger did not look happy, what with how her tail was flicking quickly and with her ears flat to her head. But she stayed put. Draco narrowed his eyes at their strange behaviors. He was distracted from those thoughts by the medical team reaching the ship.
Healer McLaggen nodded. “Of course,” he said, standing up, “If you’ll come with me, I will take you there.”
The woman smirked. “Of course,” she answered, as she glanced at the blond senator, “I know the perfect one. He has just returned to Coruscant from a recruiting mission.”
It was a few moments before her call connected. It was one of the Knights that manned the Temple’s communication hub. She was not familiar with him, but she could tell he recognized her by how his demeanor changed a second after he appeared in her hologram. “Hello,” the Knight said, “Is there something I can help you with?”
Shacklebolt watched the young senator for a moment before shaking his head in defeat. “Since you seem set on this infernal course of action, at least take protection with you,” he said before turning to the Jedi master, “Master McGonagall, could I possibly request a Jedi Knight to accompany Senator Malfoy?”
He rolled his eyes at her. “Why yes, Hermione. It is, after all, the middle of the night.” He scrunched up his nose. “Though, you are not the first to do so tonight.”
Bringing himself back to the present, Draco pulled out a set of clothes from his drawer, an older set that were a bit too tight on him, and brought them to the bed. He sat on the edge of it, gently running his fingers through Harry’s raven hair. “Come on, time to get out,” he said, “We’re going out.”
They continued down the hallway and out of the Palace into the garden. Draco figured Severus would be there, because he loved the garden. Both of them did. Draco had so many memories of spending time there with Sirius and Severus. Sometimes, when he could not focus, they would have their lessons out there. Severus was in pain, so he would retreat to where he felt closest to Sirius.
Therefore, Harry also was allowed to stay with the girls the whole time they are away. The carriages were to be the students’ living quarters while at the foreign school. They had all been expanded to hold three beds and a bathroom.
Granger noticed her friend’s reaction, and narrowed her eyes. “Unless you weren’t on Coruscant…” Her cat eyes widened as she connected the dots. “Tell me you didn’t!” She practically screeched.
Pansy threw back her head and laughed as Hermione rolled her eyes. “Of course, my love,” she answered, “We mustn’t let the poor boys at Durmstrang be deprived of our beauty.” She smiled at her. “Even if it will be so cold there.”
were just the same. And they saddled me with you. She had the audacity to die giving birth to you. Then her husband had to go and die as well. There you were, looking just like Comte Potter with Lilian’s unique eyes.” She smirked nastily. “And I saw my opportunity. To take everything that I deserved. Everything that Lily took from me. As the eldest, it all should have been mine. So, we took your property, your money. And I made you suffer just like I always wanted to make Lilian suffer.”
On a different note, Draco Malfoy did not end up going to Hogwarts. Like his father wanted, the blond went to Durmstrang. He was the only Englishman in his year, but he did not have problems keeping up with the classes. His father had made sure his son was fluent in Russian, the language spoken at Durmstrang. Draco was the top of his year. He was strong. He was vicious. He was deadly accurate.  No one could beat him in a duel, and his opponents tended to end up in the medical ward for extended periods of time. He had grown his hair into shaggy hairstyle, much to his father’s disdain. He felt it added to his ‘bad boy’ image and kept it like that.
Draco scoffed. “They wouldn’t dare hurt me. I am their prince,” he retorted, “With my cousin’s recent death, I am the only one left that can inherit the throne. Even if they don’t like me, they need me.” He defiantly raised his chin as he stood before the Chancellor. He would not back down; he would be going to the funeral of his favorite cousin.
Severus sighed and rolled his eyes, but stood up nonetheless. The Draco was alone, staring out into space. A deep darkness, pinpricked by intense dots of light. Of life, fighting against the oppression of nothingness.
“Draco?” Lyra called out, faintly. They had split up to try and find more clues. Her voice pulled him from his melancholy thoughts. “Come here.”
Draco nodded, becoming more impressed with the Knight Harry grew to be. He frowned after a moment. “Sev, why did you call him ‘Wolfe’?” Draco asked, “It’s Harry.”
Draco sat back, shocked. That was … odd. Really, really odd. He shook his head to clear away the whole occurrence and focused back on the controls. He did need to land the ship at some point, after all.
Remus nodded. “Yes, I met with Healer McLaggen before he gave me the room number,” he answered. He bit his lip as he took Harry hand into his, careful of the brace. He looked up at the other man, eyes assessing. “Why are you here?” he asked, not really caring that the question might come off a bit harsh. He wanted to know why Severus was there, in the room, with Remus’ surrogate son.
“I remember them,” the Queen said softly, “Well, I remember the Comtesse. Lily. She was from Sweden, I think.” She absently tapped on the side of her wineglass. “We were friends. Before. The Comte Potter swept her off her feet. He rarely came to court, but somehow …” She shrugged, turning back to Draco. “They married, and she left court with him. They had a child, but there were complications from the birth. She died. I don’t know what happened to the Comte or the baby.”
Lyra chuckled between bites. “Oh no,” she cooed, “Someone doesn’t like the pompous Dauphin?” She reached out a finger to tap on Draco’s nose, which he promptly mimed biting.
Draco shrugged in embarrassment, looking back out the window. “Just checking,” he murmured, “Landing in 3 … 2 … 1 …”
He shook his head in exasperation, before looking at Remus. “He probably got shot during one of those stupid twirls,” he said, laughing humorlessly, “I told you those were a stupid strategy. Remember? You turn your back to your attack just to harness some centrifugal force.”
“Well done Mr. Mort.” McGonagall said as the bell rang. Hadrian gently placed his music box into his bag noting that Draco had done the same thing.
Ron and Hermione moved into her line of vision then, and it only took a look before Ron began to fill her in about the mysterious curse that had been used. He made sure to tell her it would wear off...eventually.
Malfoy pursed his lips and looked away from her, his eyes focused on the crash and the flashing lights as help arrived on scene, "I have it, too. Post-Traumatic Stress disorder. One of the Mind-healers who had to evaluate me before my trial diagnosed me."
If they couldn't make it to being quite friends, could they be friendly? Or, at least, something that involved less hatred.
Her stubbornness was only able to take her so far, however, as the pain caused her to cry out and close her eyes, surely in the brink of passing out, “You really can’t help being a fool, can you?” Malfoy hadn’t known when it had happened, only that he had taken one of her hands and was allowing her to squeeze it as tightly as she needed to try and distract her from the pain, “Surprised they haven’t done it sooner—the way you blindly threw yourself into those woods without waiting for your team to back you up—“
"I don't hate you anymore, if that's what you want to know," she told him, her voice gentle and earnest--it struck her then that she had never, in the entirety of their lives, spoken like this to Malfoy. Spoken this much to Malfoy, even.
Harriet unfurled it quickly, flicked her eyes to the unfinished bacon and toast on her plate, should the bird be hungry, and skimmed the contents. Once she hit the name at the bottom she read and re-read the letter until she had it memorized.
"Damn, Robards," Harriet teased but nodded in agreement as Darren and Ritchie mulled it over (as if they had a say), "Let's get to it then, I'll leave the alley first, draw their attention away from you lot."
"Hate to burst your bubble, Coote, but I don't think we're about to be finishing this up anytime soon," Harriet sighed, "This doesn't feel off to you lot? Searching for them for years and an annonymous tip leads us here and the first place Ron and I walk into confirms it? It's too clean. Too neat."
She was perfect for the job, after all, she'd been conditioned to be as such for the first 17 years of her life.
Just when she was sure her knees were going to make sharp contact with the ground again, a pair of strong arms wrapped around her and kept her from falling. When she looked up to see who it was that she was looking at, Harriet nearly gasped.
"Embracing the muggle world was something I wasn't ever able to do before. I took my newfound freedom these past three years to appreciate it," he pursed his lips, "Not to mention living on probation is easier if you go it the Muggle way," she didn't have a chance to ask him what he meant by that, nor how he was, how he found the muggle-way to be--nor any of the other things that suddenly threatened to burst from her lips.
Of course, Harriet had told herself that she was doubting herself. She'd floored the auror examinations, passed each one with flying colors (no doubt thanks to the extensive training she'd put herself through sixth year with the senior members of the Order, including Snape). She'd learnt magic and skills that she never would have learned at Hogwarts. She'd been able to show off her wandless magic, even.
Before she fainted, a flash of silver caught her eye and all she could wonder was why the fuck Draco Malfoy was here, trying to help her in a muggle village while they were trying to track down three very evasive, very sadistic Death Eaters.
They sat in silence for a bit. Not uncomfortably so. It seemed they were just...staring at one another, taking the other in.
“Apparently, the git’s become a Private Investigator. Helping families track down loved ones in hiding—and now helping the Ministry find the remaining Death Eaters,” Ron informed her.
THE STAG was written in bold capital letters across the front, the building black, with brick inlaid sides.
She realized then that the reason she found herself thinking constantly about what Malfoy had said to her was because she'd done just what he'd told her not to.
"--are in a village outside Surrey. Find Weasley, Coote, and Chambers. You're going to investigate. If you see anything, call it in and we'll send backup," Kingsley handed her a piece of paper without missing a beat, on it were written coordinates, "I told Robards to take the day off--he was a bit high strung when he came in yesterday."
Harry finally left, then, only to run into a flustered looking Ron and Hermione, who looked immensely relieved on spotting her.
She laughed and ran a hand through her hair before looping her bag on the back of her chair. Draco Malfoy--trust her? That was a new one. Could they really have changed this much in three years? Well--actually, yes. That was a stupid question. Before she could stop herself, she said, "Not the sort of place I expected."
“Malfoy?” It was all she could manage, her voice gravelly with the effort it took not to cry out in pain. She glared at the pair of them when they exchanged a look.
Harriet rolled her eyes and took a sip of her beer, trying hard not to snap back at him with a quip that would surely lead to an argument, which would surely lead to her storming out of the pub and Malfoy covered in the remnants of her pint. She raised an eyebrow at him over the rim of her glass and waited, intent on getting some sort of apology before she deigned to speak again.
Harry nodded, smoothed her hands over her dress and and straightened her posture, "I should be getting back. Leave you to it."
"What have I told you about running off without saying anything to one of us?" Hermione snapped, a rare lapse in control. She looked upset, and Harry realized it was because of what had happened the last time she'd disappeared without telling them.
The barmaid returned with their drinks and Harriet smiled kindly and offered her thanks, "Listen," she started, "I'm nervous about this--"
Ron rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything else as a Healer bustled into the room, “Fortunate he did. His familiarity with the curse helped us greatly, we should be able to break it in the next day or so,” the Healer was one Harriet hadn’t seen before, but she found herself pleased at her lack of bias towards Malfoy.
He was smiling then too, and, as their shots delivered, they drank them together without breaking eye contact.
She wondered what her truce with Malfoy would look like if it made headlines--not that it would. Not that she wanted it to. Not that she was even thinking that their encounter had actually meant anything to him, for it certainly didn't mean anything to her and wasn't at all on her mind.
She took off at a run, then, unable to wait for the others to catch up should a brief hesitation allow them to get away. Breathing heavily, she flicked her wand at the stunned figure in black robes, binding his arms and legs tightly to his side, so as not to allow him movement, even if he came to anytime soon. Harry continued on, flicking her wand and sending flashes or red and blue light with the intent to stun or incapacitate. She caught another and left him to Ritchie, who had quickly caught up to her. She couldn't stop though--they hadn't gotten them all, if her memory was correct the other two should be right around her--
Draco watched Ron's face closely and was surprised to watch a mix of fear and worry cross his features. Momentarily, Draco was brought back to the moment he lingered around, just out of sight in the Entrance Hall while Granger had all but freaked out on Potter for "disappearing". His eyebrows furrowed as he stared at the girls slight frame, remembered the way she had so effortlessly brought him down for protection only a few days ago when she thought there had been danger present--and how she couldn't have her back to anything...anyone.
When she was hidden enough to apparate back to her flat, Harriet realized it had really pissed her off that Malfoy hadn't tried to stop her that time.
All of this took at most 5 minutes--it was the outfit that was going to take longer. She didn't know what sort of place Malfoy was talking about, but he had said a pub, not a restaurant or anything too fancy. She settled on a pair of dark, skinny jeans, a pair of beige, knee high boots with a slight heel, and a white blouse. She put on a pair of pearl earrings, and didn't change the gold locket with a picture of her parents inside. Once she was satisfied, she grabbed her cloak and her pocket book, the one with the undetectable extension charm. Right before she decided to leave her flat, she pinched cheeks for color, pulled the cloak over herself and turned on her heel where she reappeared right in front of the pub and quickly made her way to the alley beside it to remove her cloak.
At around 5:15pm she began to get ready. She'd decided to apparate under her cloak, as she hadn't been able to look up the address because her internet was being shoddy. Ruddy thing--she'd told Mr. Weasley she had no use for a computer, least of all one that hardly worked on a good day, and whined whirred loudly all throughout.
"We've been through so much, the both of us. And you didn't tell her. Bellatrix. That night at your house, you knew it was me," Harriet reminded him gently, "It wasn't just me who saved your life," she was shocked to see how uncomfortable Malfoy looked then, at her mention of his good deed. She couldn't stop, "And at the battle, you threw me your wand. If you hadn't--"
"That's not what I meant. This is...quaint but chic. Very muggle. Rustic," Harriet raised her hand to the barmaid as she surveyed the scene, "I'm going for a shot and a pint--you in?" Malfoy nodded and she order for both of them, pleased to see that Malfoy had no qualms about her choice of drink. There was nothing normal about this. Harriet had to remind herself that she hadn't been normal a day in her life.
Harriet nodded gratefully, Gawain Robards had taken over the Auror department. He was one of the few aurors who had been able to stay with the department after she and Ron had joined and made a movement to weed out corruption by yanking at the roots. Robards was great at his job--but he was a bit of a blunt arse, if Harry was being honest. As blunt as he could be, however, he and Harry had a decent relationship. He respected what she'd done and had been impressed by her skillset. Her ability to adapt, to learn, and fight for what was right.
She was momentarily brought back to the moment she'd rejected Malfoy's handshake all those years ago. Rejected his friendship and embarassed him as he'd embarassed Ron. A sudden wave of guilt crashed over her--what if she had been his friend back then? What if she hadn't rejected him? Would things have turned out different for Malfoy? Could she have saved him from what had happened?
Harriet raised an eyebrow at Ron and mouthed 'bingo', "Not used to outsiders around here?" Harriet took the opportunity to chime in, flashing a radiant smile and blinking her eyes innocently. Ron snorted--the whole "attractive and flirty young woman" bit actually did work out well for her more often than not, but it was admittedly an uncomfortable charade.
Her eyes flashed at this, surprised—she hadn’t thought the Riddle would have used his own followers as test subjects, “Awful,” was all she could get herself to say. Malfoy snorted and gave a nod of agreement.
"They were there, but so were their lackeys--wannabe Death Eater's. It seems they aren't picky with who they can get on their side. Mulciber, no doubt, was the mastermind behind this hex--the Dark Lord used it to torture information out of people. It's a severe burn, which I've healed...but the after effects of it will be debilitating for a time. Potter managed to strike three down before Mulciber attacked from afar...I would've gone for him but I was the only one who knew the curse. The only one that could help."
An unfair wave of guilt rushed through her, and she wrapped an arm around her waist before doubling over with another sob. She couldn't very well desecrate a dead man's body--even if that man was Voldemort. Tom Marvolo Riddle. She wanted so terribly to feel relief and happiness, only, she couldn't. There was so much pain and loss--the range of her emotions shuffled through her and all she could think of was how she wished she hadn't gotten back on the train. Then she might've gone on to see what was waiting for her elsewhere.
“No, just to fix you up after you’ve run amok,” Malfoy pointed out, leaving Harriet no other choice but to release his stupidly soft hand.
Malfoy cut her off by raising his shot glass, cheers-ing her own, and throwing it back. She followed suit easily.
Harry had genuinely laughed at what he'd written. It was like he was half-trying to tell her she was full of shit and probably wouldn't keep her word, while also half-trying to tell her that he would appreciate it if she did. Feeling giddy for the first time in...a very long time, Harry scrawled a reply on the back of Malfoy's letter.
"Why are you so on edge, mate?" Ron asked as they paused and inauspiciously glanced around, Harriet paid careful but brief notice to a homeless man in the alleyway. Something told her, despite being on the run, Mulciber and Dolohov were probably living with more luxury--Greyback, however, she could easily picture around these parts
"Summon Kingsley then, comb the village with a larger crew...might be we get the rest of the week off!" Ritchie chirped and Harriet shook her head, earning a groan from Darren.
Harriet opened her laptop and pressed the power button. She was curious--Malfoy had chosen a pub in muggle London? She hadn't even thought he knew anything about London, outside the magical bits. Before she could put more thought into this, her flat rang with the chime of her telephone and she stood to answer it.
Ross snorted and Lem shook his head, "Rough looking fellows been 'round a bit, funny coats. Tried to pay for a meal with weird coins. Didn't say anything though, as they were gold and worth more than the fish and chips I made 'em."
The Healer helped her drink a calming draught after a brief explanation that it was the only potion able to help, coupled with cooling charms. Harriet didn’t attempt to speak again, but she did feel a relaxation in her limbs and a dullness that replaced the tension, which seemed to also dull the consistent buzz of pain. She closed her eyes briefly, inhale exhale, and opened them again.
Malfoy looked like he was going to say something scathing, but he merely shrugged, "Don't mention it."
The papers reported on the event for weeks. The public was pleasantly distracted. Spirits were up-lifted in the name of hero's getting together and wearing fancy clothes.
And then she remembered. Voldemort was dead. Her entire life's purpose had been fulfilled. She didn't have it in her to wonder what was next. To wonder what would happen now that she didn't have to be the Chosen One anymore. Those worries would come later.
In truth, she had done it for Narcissa Malfoy, who had truly saved her life. Who was not responsible for the choices of her husband or her son. Who would have been devastated if she had lost what was left of her family based on choices it seemed she had been forced to make. Not for nothing, Malfoy had had a change of heart at the battle when he'd thrown her her wand after she'd dropped it due to a nasty curse from Mulciber. Her hand tensed reflexively. Sometimes, the pain still flared.
This year, instead of just standing there and staring at the spot where she'd dumped Riddle's body, she kicked off her heels and sat back against the stone wall instead. Impulsively, she impatiently pulled the bobby-pins that kept her hair in place and shook that much-too-tight-hairspray feeling out of her scalp with a long-deserved sigh of relief. Next year she would make sure she was on a long-term assignment out of the country.
Harry had been listening intently and had to school his features to neutrality when Master McGonagall mentioned slavery. He had not realized there was an anti-slavery movement. McGonagall was still taking, so Harry refocused on her words.
Draco chuckled. “But we must,” he cooed, scratching softly at the man’s scalp, “It’ll be good. You’ve been cooped up too long. We won’t be around the palace, if that’s your concern. We’ll be going into the village.”
“What happened to you?” Draco murmured to the books. He was looking through one that listed the history of the Potters. Unfortunately, it was mostly ancient history. The family originated in Germany, moving to France eighty years ago. Finally, at the end of the book, was a list of marriages. The last one, between Jameson Potter and Lilian Eka, daughter of the ambassador from Sweden, was dated nineteen years ago.
Draco looked up at the other man, horror and anger warring behind his eyes. “Harry … what?” he trailed off, not able to find the right words.
“Why, Draco? WHY?! You know you’re causing so much political and social strife there because of the bill. You’re lucky you’re not dead. Without you, the bill dies, and slavery will remain legal in the Republic.”
The rest of the meal was spent chatting softly about nothing important. The sun beat down mercilessly on them, even with the partial shade of the leaves above. Draco plucked at neck of his tunic. It was heavy, thick, and it felt like it was suffocating him. He made a snap decision. They were in the middle of a basically abandoned orchard; it was just the two of them.
Draco sighed, but dutifully ‘translated’. Though Haydrien was not paying attention to either of them; his focus was on the Bulgarian Minister. The man’s eyes were following the conversation. Haydrien came to a realization: the wizard was pulling the same con as Haydrien.
“Sherbert Lemons.” he said and the large stone statue moved. Hadrian figured that Dumbledore was either barmy for having such an easy password or wanted people to be able to go through his stuff. Either way Hadrian wasn’t happy to be drawn away from what would have been a very relaxing evening reading in the library for the headmaster’s personal agenda. Once he had climbed the stairs he knocked and entered. Dumbledore was sitting at his desk seemingly doing paperwork. There was a perch behind him where Hadrian assumed his phoenix sat when he was present.
Harlan chuckled right behind Draco, breath ghosting over his neck. However, when Draco looked back, the raven-haired Jedi was a couple steps behind him, turned around to watch the way they came. The deep color of the lightsaber added to the shadows instead of dispelling them. Draco had never seen a blade that dark a color; he wondered why. Maybe he would ask Severus later. When they were back on Coruscant. Safe from his own people.
A choked off noise caught his attention, and Harry turned to look at Draco. This was the first time he had seen a genuine expression on the blond’s face. Sadness was etched across every feature as Draco walked towards the man on the platform.
“Now, I have to go let in the guests.” Pansy then gave Draco a knowing smirk. “Do not think you can change clothes the minute I am gone; I put a charm on them that prevents you from removing them yourself.”
{My car is being fixed. It wasn't as bad as I had feared, but I was still stranded at my old college campus where I was visiting a friend for two hours waiting for my father to come. We traded cars, and he managed to fix mine enough to get it back home with him to be fixed at our normal repair shop verses some possibly sketchy place out where I live. I'd had my laptop, and campus is really safe, even during the summer.}
Draco smirked softly to himself. Harry might be the perfect Comte, but with a sword in his hand, all that noble grace went out the window. Though he was improving, Harry could only best the younger knights. Lyra still enjoyed teaching him, and fencing circles around him.
“They aren’t as important as concentration. In fact if one really wanted to they wouldn’t even have to use the movements, they would just have to concentrate on what they wanted to happen.” Hadrian said with a shrug.
Apparently, hearing his son speak jarred the older Baron into action. “He died,” he said quickly, “Childhood illness. We brought in a physician, but he could not be saved.”
Their attention was drawn back to the doors as the figure on the left conjured a raven, also made of gas. Again, two lines of students in black robes, with blue badges this time, entered the ball and moved down the right side. The raven flew above their heads, circling when they stopped. “
Remus shook his head. “No, he wasn’t. The boy ended up leaving the temple soon after. Not a big loss, though.” He ghosted his fingers down Harlan’s hairline, along the marks. “Though, he did not purposely provoke Harlan. Hardly anyone knew he was a Nečista Stvorenje; just me and the council members. With the scarf over the marks and currently no
Draco stepped forward, grabbing the other man. “Harry, breathe,” he muttered. But that did not seem like it was helping. He pulled the man against his chest. “Come on, Harry, breathe with me. Match my breaths.” He exaggerated his breathing, and slowly, the other man calmed.
Harry needed to nip his feelings for the man in the bud. It would do no one any good if he allowed them to take root. To grow. Regardless of the care and concern he showed, Draco could never be with Harry. The man was nobility, a royal, and would have to be with some of noble blood. In other words, not him.
, the Knight was freakishly good at blending into the background. The only reason he did not jump was the Malfoy breeding ingrained in his mind. The Knight’s presence also was not helping Draco keep his mind in the present because the man looked how he imagined Harry would look at their age. But Harry might not have even lived this long. Nečista Stvorenje did not tend to live to be very old. Krv Čistas claim that it has to do with the mixing of Krv Čista and Prljavštine Osoba genes, but Draco figured the real reason was their treatment. Another reason to abolish slavery.
Harry stood by the window, looking back over his shoulder at Draco. The man pulled nervously at the sleeves. Draco had been right; the clothes fit perfectly. The dark green velvet pants hugged his muscular thighs perfectly and tucked into the boots Draco had commissioned. The brown tunic was a little long but fit decently; the light green leaf embroidery around the neck and hems brought out the green in his eyes. He was waiting for the man to put on some more weight, to get to a healthy weight, before commissioning clothing. If Draco was being honest with himself, he was stalling partially because he liked seeing the man in his clothes.
Hermione paced the room anxiously, gripping hard to the teardrop emerald of her necklace. Waiting was … Horrible. Excruciating. Infuriating. She
She heard more cursing, then a muffled apology. After waiting a few moments, she removed her hand to see Remus,
Severus sighed, looking down. He seemed more uncomfortable, and very sad. “I did not have much standing there, and it kept me in the palace,” he finally answered. It looked like the man was trying to gather his thoughts, working on how to words something. “I was … with … Sirius, the Crown Prince.” He rubbed his hands across his face again. “As in, we were in a relationship. For twenty-nine years.”
“And a pleasure to meet you Heir Zabini.” He said and they headed off to Transfigurations, a class that both the Slytherins and Ravenclaws.
Dudley rapidly shook his head. “No, sire, I did not know anything about them, or Harry,” he said, then blanched, “I mean, Comte Potter.” He ducked his head in a stunted bow. “I remember moving, but not why we moved. And I knew Mother hated the little boy who was with the other servants. She encouraged me to be awful to him, to get him in trouble.”
The woman in the projection pursed her lips, apparently not missing the sarcasm either. “Really now? Is that any way to talk to me?” she reprimanded, “Now, after the funeral, there will be a ceremony where you’ll be named as the Crown Prince. It is essential that you are there, Draconis, showing your commitment to your planet, what with all these preposterous rumors about your involvement in the anti-slavery movement.”
McGonagall sighed. “It could,” she conceded, “but it will help Harlan in the end. His past torments him still, after all these years. Going back as he is now should lessen their effect on him.”
“So,” the Healer started, “Introductions first. My name is Cormac McLaggen. I am the assistant director of the Trauma unit.” He glanced at her.
Harry ducked his head, subtly leaning into the affectionate touch. He thought of the other Knight like a father, and he knew the man thought of him as a son. “I am alright,” he muttered.
Draco saw red. This perfect man … thought he deserved to be hit. To be hurt. Draco shook his head at that. He wanted to protect his man. This … servant. Dieu, this was too much. He could not handle his feelings at the moment. Not for a servant. A voice cleared behind him, jarring Draco out of his thoughts.
Lyra huffed in annoyance. Draco had felt the same when he had found the document. Who would make an incomplete copy in the first place? Let alone one that went into the royal archives?
It's done, though these last three chapters are more like epilogues/glimpses of the future and are not really important to the plot of the story.
A grizzled old man stood right behind them. He snatched the linen out of Lyra’s hand. With a stool he had brought with him, he rehung the fabric over the painting, covering the couple up again. He gave a satisfied hum, and then turned to face the siblings, angry expression on his face.
Draco straightened, his grief reigned in behind a mask of indifference. The blond walked back over to Harry to stand shoulder to shoulder as they waited for the group to reach them.
---.---.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--.---.---.---.---.---.---.--
When they reach the Minister’s box, they were greeted by a large group of redheads. Instantly, both Lucius and Draco scowled. Slowly, in the midst of the mayhem, the four were noticed by the group. The faces all changed: disdain, anger, confusion, and two identical faces of intrigue.
Draco designed was simplistic. Three metals braided together: bronze, gold, and silver. Intermitted in the design, several small emeralds were nestled in the braid. The stones matched the man’s eyes. Now, he just needed the right moment to give it to Harry, and ask the man to be his consort.
Draco brought the ship down gently. The ship jostled only slightly as the landing gear made contact with the pad. He turned to look at Severus, grinning smugly. “Perfect,” he declared.
“That’s illegal. The potion itself would get you a life sentence in Azkaban.” He said when Hadrian gave him a curious look.
Draco smiled. “Wonderful,” he said, turning back to the woman, “You’ll be a scullery maid in Duc Zabini’s household.”
Alexei nodded with a grimace. Their full uniforms consisted of the regular maroon turtleneck, brown trousers, and knee-high, black dragon hide boots, plus red, military-like jackets and matching fur-lined capes. The cape was very bothersome, mostly due to the fact that it had to be slung over one shoulder. It made doing the most standard things difficult.
Vaguely, Harry heard the other man grumbling under his breath as they left the planet’s atmosphere. “I cannot believe them. Siri died not even a day ago and they’ve already moved onto the next thing. They could at least pretend to be sad he’s gone.” The blond glanced towards Harry. “I guess I should explain.”
Besides all the magically creatures, normal animals also inhabited the grounds. Like horses, wolves, alligators, squirrels, rabbits … Rabbits … That brought back a fond memory from Draco’s childhood …
“Sirius deferred the throne to his younger brother,” Draco continued, “Except, Regulus was an idiot and got himself killed during an illegal space speeder race. Sirius was the only one left, unless one of his cousins had a son. Bellatrix found to be infertile when she and her husband failed to conceive.” Draco chuckled. “Good thing, too, because Aunt Bella is certifiably insane. No one wants her to reproduce and pass on the crazy genes.
Regarding that, Felidae was odd, at least in Draco’s opinion. Their senator actually has a role in how the plant runs. A small role, but a role nonetheless. He, the senator of Čarobnjačkom, had no power in his planet’s government. His planet was ruled by an absolute monarchy. Even as the Crown Prince, Draco had no power. That would change when his Grandfather, King Orion, died, may his soul burn in the fires of
The sound of clapping startled the pair; they had been the only ones in the training courtyard. Draco was leaning against the archway with a smile. His attendant nobles stood just behind his shoulder: Marquis Longbottom, Vicomte Thomas, the visiting Duc Zabini from Italy, and the Barons Crabbe and Goyle. Apparently, her brother had not been able to shake them. Draco pushed away from the wall and walked over to Harry. He reached out to fix the man’s hair; the ponytail had come loose and messy throughout the practice.
At the moment, a thestral made its presence known by flying above the canopy of trees, circling for a minute before plunging back into the darkness beneath. Had Draco mentioned good old Taurus' obsession with magical beasts? That was the reason for the sprawling, magically-enhanced land surrounding the manor in the first place. So, over the years, each generation of Malfoy had brought new species to the grounds. Now, there were more species than Draco could count. Though, there was a record of all the animals every brought here; it was the beast tamer's cottage.
Draco had headed to the planet’s capital, Cadmus, located in the rainforest. There were only five large cities on Felidae: Cadmus in the rainforest, Tikino in the savanna, Mueget in the swampy marshland, Domia in the wooded hills, and Jazip in the snowy mountains. Cadmus is the largest of them. Of the populous of the planet, what did not live in the cities was spread out in small communities in between.
Severus walked passed and gave Draco’s shoulder a squeeze. Draco followed, the wall sliding back into place behind them. Harlan was already outside when Draco and Severus reached the end of the hall. They paused to listen before leaving the passage.
“What do you mean Dumbledore has Pettigrew in his pocket? Pettigrew was working for your bloody dark lord.” Sirius snapped.
When they pulled apart, Remus smiled as he fixed Harry’s head scarf, making sure the marks were still covered like the younger man wanted. “You look well, Harlan,” the Knight said, “How was the trip?” The unspoken question was, ‘How are you holding up after the recruiting mission?’ Remus knew it would dredge up old, painful memories for the raven-haired Knight.
Right as expected, the Baron started to shout, “Lies! All lies!” The obese spun to face the crowd of courtiers, pointing a pudgy finger at them; Harry ducked a little, making sure to be behind a taller man, the Marquis Longbottom, he thought. “Which one of you is spreading these vicious lies about me and my family?!”
“Destri.” His matchbox morphed as well and when it was done he had a small metal box that had three overlapping infinity signs carved into the top. When he opened it moonlight sonata started to play. Quietly he closed it and smiled.
It was a shame, since Harry remembered how popular the apples were. People were always so eager for them. A couple times, Harry swore he thought he saw what looked like royal servants buying some. He smiled faintly at the memory. Their apples may have been served in the palace. What a thought!
The young Baron, who had just looked stupidly confused throughout the proceedings, finally spoke up. “Who?” he asked. Draco barely refrained from rolling his eyes.
They completely changed Harry’s appearance. It was not all that hard because he had a rather feminine figure and facial structure. Since Harry’s black hair had grown to be quite shaggy, they just needed to style it into a sleek bob. Pansy had wanted to add highlights, but Hermione said that would look tacky and distract from its raven wing quality. They taught him how to tastefully apply make-up. He found he was fond of silver, blue, and purple shades of eyeshadow. Harry got a girl’s school uniform, as well as many skirts, dresses, blouses, sweaters, and jeans. He also got a few pairs of heels to make him taller than his normal five foot six. The finishing touch was his name. Harry changed his name from Harry James Black to Harriet Lily Black. Since he was still underage, he needed a parent’s approval. Sirius readily agreed, wanting his adopted son to be happy.
“Great. Just great,” the other man murmured, before turning to Harry. “Brace yourself. It’s my mother.” He reached to answer the call. “Hello, Mother dear.”
“Of course. Sit, no one will mind.” Hadrian said and Draco slid beside him with Theo on his other side. Hadrian waited for the other two to go around the table and sit across from them before beginning the levitation charm
Harlan stepped around Draco and headed towards the light. “I’ll check to make see if the coast is clear,” the Knight stated, “and give us some cover. You two head quickly for the ship.” Draco nodded.
* I've never written a story with a happy ending, and this story has a happy ending. I don't have experience and I lacked the motivation to write a happy ending. (But I'm now feeling more optimistic about a lot of things, including romantic relationships -> I'm now engaged!!!)
Hermione blushed and covered her eyes when she realized Remus was getting dressed. He must have forgotten they were still connected. “Remus!” she squeaked, “I’m still here!”
When they entered the Mess Hall, there was a noticeable change. The normal seven student tables had been moved to make room for two more tables, one for each of the visiting schools.* Draco and Alexei walked to their table, sitting down. Once everyone was settled, Karkaroff rose from his seat. The hall was instantly silent. All the focus was on the headmaster.
“Mother, I am leaving as we speak,” the man said. More words were spoken, but they were lost to Harry. His mind had frozen when the woman said the senator’s name: Draconis.
They all walked silently, stopping at an open door. The Healer went in, the other man right behind. Hermione paused, looking back at Ronald. The ginger nodded. Hermione stepped through, and Ronald pulled the door closed. A soft thud let her know that her bodyguard was now leaning against the door. She then faced the room. The Healer sat at his desk, and the other man sat in front. There was an empty chair, which Hermione assumed was for her. She made her way over to it.
“You have to imagine it becoming a needle, hold the thought clearly in your head and preform the spell and it should do as you want. The clearer the though is the easier it will be.” he explained to Draco in a soft voice. Draco nodded and tried again, succeeding this time.
“He’s on route to Felidae,” Hermione answered. She wiped at her eyes, careful of her claws that were still extended. “They’re coming from Čarobnjačkom.”
“Do you really think I would lead us somewhere I could not navigate? Insolent brat,” the older man snapped. For the moment, Draco though he saw a sheepish look  on the Knight’s face, but it was gone too quickly for him to be sure. Severus continued, “I can get us to the other wall, very close to the landing pad.”
“Are you sure? Tell me everything.” He demanded and She took a deep breath before relaying everything she had heard.
Draco watched as the three stared blankly at Harry. Everyone waited for the recognition to hit. This was not part of their plan, but Draco would follow Harry’s lead. He was the injured part in this situation; whatever he wanted to do, they would do.
“The burn is more difficult, because of the nature of a blaster,” the Healer continued, “Wounds inflicted by one ooze, take a long time to heal, and scar horribly. We’ve wrapped the burn up with a mixed paste:
The Baroness paled, but the Baron’s face grew red with anger at Draco’s words. Harry nearly sighed. He recognized that look. There would be shouting, and normally hitting, but the Baron would not dare to strike the Dauphin.
Hermione barely had time to nod in answer before Remus cut the connection. Since that was now taken care of, she had nothing to distract from her own panic and anxiety. Maybe her guard would be interested in a spare. She had the strong urge to claw something.
The Healer nodded at the words. Hermione tried to reign in her emotions. She was mostly successful, except her claws kept flexing. She buried them in the material of her skirt to hide the reaction from the men in the room.
Dr Piers cleared his throat, drawing the girl’s attention from the ground. “You can go, Mary,” he said with a sigh, “We can finish our discussion another day. Jones here needs help with his senior project.” He clasped a hand on Draco’s shoulder in comradery. Apparently, the man had gained back some confidence at the girl’s cowed appearance. The girl grabbed her bag and practically ran from the apartment, never looking at Draco. Good.
Draco smiled, leaning against the doorframe. It was a wonderful, touching moment. He felt privileged to be a part of it, even if only from the sidelines. His Harry was slowly coming to accept his new place in life, and this reunion was a large jump in the right direction for them to be together.
“Enthused,” Draco answered in a deadpan, offering her his arm. With a pinch to his side, she accepted it.
At the end are some pieces of my reasonings/background that are important but not explicitly stated in the text of the story.
Those thoughts were derailed when Draco reached his quarters. The guards opened the door without prompting. Draco entered and went to lay Harry on the bed. He knew there were suites for the courtiers in a different wing of the castle, but Draco wanted to keep him close. He did not want the other man out of his sight. One of his attendants, the Marquis Neville Longbottom, appeared at his shoulder.
“Dumbledore had come in and out of our house several times since July. He’s planning on feeding you a potion that will make you a puppet for him.” George said softly as not to be overheard. Draco sucked a breath in sharply
The rest of the break passed uneventfully for the group. They had finished their assignments within the first few days, so everyone was working on individual projects now. Well, some were projects. Hadrian rolled his eyes at Draco, who’s nose was buried, once again, in a romance novel. The twins were researching potion composition, specifically how to combine potions and sugar without altering the potions or the mix tasting awful. They wanted to make prank sweets. Hadrian shuddered at the thought if the pair succeeded; no one would be safe. Theo was settled between them, looking so content as he flipped through a book on druidic rituals. Blaise was diligently taking notes from a journal written by an Italian crusader, which outlined how he combined spellcasting and weaponry.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
charm revealed that it was time for him to head down to Pansy’s torture, masquerading as a party. Draco did not want to go because the men he had loved and lost were not there.
Also, I can't remember if I stated how old Lyra was ... if I did, please remind me, because I can't find it (either I'm just struggling or I embedded it so well it's hiding or I did it in a note and thus it's not in my story document).
Remus frowned as he sat down next to Harry, across the bed from Severus. “You knew I was coming,” he said. It was a statement more than a question.
Harry stood a respectful distance away from the pair. He did not want to intrude on their moment of grief. He stood at rest, watching the palace for anyone’s approach. He cleared his throat a few minutes later, alerting the pair to their surroundings again. A group of people had appeared out from under the arches of the palace and were making their way down to where they three of them stood. One of the men had the same platinum blond hair as Draco, so Harry guessed it was the man’s father.
The new Baron Dursley looked around at the courtiers. “That would be greatly appreciated,” he replied. Harry figured the man did not want to spend any more time in court at the moment than he had to.
Harry could not breathe. Not because of pain but panic. He was in the palace. In the Dauphin’s room. In the man’s
Draco started to protest, because there was no way he would leave the Knight behind. Not with so many unanswered questions between them. Harlan cut him off with a look and a smirk.
Wolfe looked bewildered at those words, but thankfully not disgusted. Draco had seen enough bigots in his lifetime. He was glad the Jedi wasn’t one.
Right now seemed to be that perfect moment. They were alone, walking through the gardens. Arm in arm, with Harry leaning his head down on Draco’s shoulder. He treasured these moments alone, few and far between that they were. They leisurely strolled down one of the paths. Soon, they arrived at the weeping willow, with the bench shielded by its hanging branches. Perfect.
Draco turned to look at the closed door, finally interested. He wanted to see what the school had in store. His mother had wanted him to go to Hogwarts, to be closer to home, but his father had the final say in his education. Draco was glad he was going to Durmstrang; he never would have learned the things he did in the English school.
Harry walked deep into the trees, munching on an apple he picked. His eyes drifted halfway closed as he let everything soak into him. The orchard was always so peaceful. Harry loved it. Just the wind gently rustling the leaves of the canopy, birds occasionally twittering. Which is why he frowned when he heard something odd. A noise out of place. It almost sounded like a horse snorting. A twig snapped, as if by a hoof pawing the ground. Harry blinked his eyes fully open and looked around.
“What about the movements? Professor Flitwick made it seem like they were really important." one of the Ravenclaws listening in asked
"I'm so glad you came. I want to show you everything. We'll start in the stables. Father keeps most of the undead there but those like the elves stay in the cellar and the wolves roam around the woods most the time." Harry chattered as they entered the house. There was a gray skinned house elf doing the dishes and when it turned towards them Draco saw it had only one eye.
Draco sighed once the door closed behind the pair, leaving just him and his sister in the room. He turned to look at her. “So, I had an idea,” he began to say, but Lyra interrupted.
The hatched touched down on the pad with a muffled thud, and Draco got a first look at his welcoming party. A group of bureaucrats. Goodie. Granger and her bodyguard. Better. A medical team with a hover stretcher. Thank
Hermione blinked at that, surprised. She was not expecting the man to have those titles. Two doctorates. Consort to Prince … Oh, Draco had gone to
Draco narrowed his eyes as he watched the woman. He did not trust that smirk, but since he was getting his way, he would not argue. He bowed slightly to the Chancellor. “Thank you,” he said, “I am ready to leave whenever my Jedi protector is ready.” With that, he left the room.
Cas bit back a groan. This was torture. The blond man was killing him. Pulling away a bit, he turned around to face the man. Lucius was smirking, of course he was. The man was getting exactly what he wanted. Lucius pulled him closer, their bodies flush. Cas let the man.
“Well done Mr. Malfoy. Ten points to Slytherin for getting it correct and twenty for making it so unique.” McGonagall said. Hadrian grinned and looked at his before whispering
That same year, Harry fully realized his sexuality. He was gay. He had inklings that he preferred boys to girls, but it really hit him at the Yule Ball. His date and friend, Pansy Parkinson, forced him under the mistletoe and kissed him for a few long minutes. The experience was horrifying, and those thoughts had obviously shown on his face. Pansy had smiled and patted his cheek. “You, my dear, are gay,” she had said. Harry had to agree with her. She was one of the most attractive females at the school and had most of the other guys drooling after her. Since he felt nothing but horror at kissing her, he figured that his affections lay strongly with boys instead of girls. After that, Pansy and he became closer, and she joined Hermione as one of his best friends.
The body next to her was responsible for the death's of so many, people she new, people she had loved--he'd killed her parents right in front of her. He'd taken everything from her. Her childhood, a normal life. And now what? What was she now?
"Hey, 'mione. She's fine, right, she's here. Nothing happened. Give her a break, it's a tough day--" he held up a hand as she opened her mouth to cut him off, "--for all of us, it's a tough day," he looked pointedly at Harriet who nodded in agreement and quelled the urge to argue with Hermione.
Harry shook her head and laughed gently over Hermione's shoulder as Ron mimed that she was cut off, "Ron was right. It's a tough day. Merlin, when did he get so wise?" Ron pretended to be offended as he offered his arms to both of them before leading them back into the Great Hall.
Malfoy left before she could answer, but she found it that she didn’t want to say no anyway. This new information, the whole PI side to Malfoy—it was intriguing and ultimately not what she expected from him. It shed new light and added another layer to someone that was surely becoming more impossible to read than ever.
Malfoy stared at her like she had three heads, "I would imagine for the same reason you are, Potter."
"Mr. Malfoy, please report," Kingsley instructed upon entering the room, ignoring Weasley's open mouth and clear indignation. Kingsley's eyes flicked over Harriet who lay impossibly still on the makeshift cot Malfoy had transfigured for her while they'd waited. He cast a cooling charm before delivering. They were the only thing that could dull the pain so early on in the curse.
The other didn't push it any further. Instead he dropped his eyes to the body next to them, the monster they were both suddenly free from. Draco shifted and raised his sleeve, baring his Dark Mark, "It's already faded slightly. It no longer moves," Malfoy whispered as if he couldn't believe it were true himself. He still sounded afraid. She stared at it, and for the first time didn't feel anything. No revulsion. No fear. Just...nothing.
“I’ve been working on a few things I want to speak with Healer Entwhistle about, we should be able to break it by tomorrow and get you out of here...though, from what the Minister’s been saying, I think you’ve been put on a temporary leave.”
“The curse that was used on you was a curse created for Voldemort. A torture method used in the first and second war,” Hermione informed her. If she knew how much it would hurt to scoff bitterly, Harriet might’ve tried a bit harder to restrain herself.
Harry started and nearly slipped out of her chair entirely upon hearing the Minister's voice above her.
"You faithless swine--I'm a Private Investigator, I'm the one who bloody well found them here and told Kingsley, Merlin, you're a pigheaded prat--" That seemed to shut Ron up, but the red head still wouldn't allow Malfoy to pick Harriet up and instead took it upon himself to determine they were going back to the Ministry. Begrudgingly, Malfoy followed and watched as the thoughtless, foolhardy Gryffidiots blundered about trying to determine what to do next.
"Will someone please tell me what the bloody fuck is going on?" Ron wondered incredulously, taking the pause in conversation as an invitation to interject. He'd watched the casual exchange between Malfoy and the Minister long enough, and still wasn't sure why everyone was looking at him like he had three heads.
Today, she felt eyes on her--but that was typical. Every year the Gala was the same. Speakers gave a speech and she was expected to lead them all in a toast before they were supposed to eat, drink, and be some form of merry. This year, her "toast" had consisted of her raising her glass with a "To those we've lost" and leaving the dais as quickly as they'd pulled her onto it. Kingsley never minded her short toasts, she knew that he thought this whole pomp and circus act was ridiculous and an absolute waste of time. But as Minister, he had certain expectations to uphold.
His hand-writing was exactly as she pictured it. Small, tidy script that ran like water, rippling over the parchment the same way water ripples over tiny pebbles at the edge of a stream.
Malfoy had waited for them to disappear before he reemerged from the dungeons, the ghost of a frown on his face. Now, there was something eating away at him. It was all he would be able to think about.
Kingsley nodded, "Of course. It's no matter. We've got eyes on them again, a near miss--but near enough to make them nervous. Or, to encourage them to come out of hiding again. They want to remain relevant, after all. I expect attacking Miss Potter was too tempting to resist."
"I'm sure even you can imagine why my name can't publicly be tied to this investigation, Weasley," Malfoy sneered.
"Oh my god--I can't believe--" she tried to catch her breath and straighten up, the arm around her waist was instead used to wipe the tears in her eyes, "--I felt so horrible about it all this time. I've never told anyone...can you believe that?" She sighed and straightened up fully, only then realizing that she still had her hand on Malfoy's arm and was gripping it gently. She was no longer grabbing it for stabilization, but for...comfort.
The Minister was still chuckling slightly as he spoke, "We received an anonymous tip that Dolohov, Greyback, and possibly Mulciber--"
After stuffing it into her bag, Harriet pinched her cheeks for a bit of color and used the back of her hand to wipe the lip gloss off her mouth before she made her way to the street and looked up at the sign above the awning.
"-rriet, Harry? Can you hear me?" Hermione's voice broke through, pulling her back to the surface, "They want to know what you want to do with V-Voldemort's b-body."
All she could think about was seeing Malfoy again. If only because she was curious. Curious about what he'd been up to. Curious about what he wanted from a friendship with her. Curious as to how easy it had been for her to trust him at the Gala with something she'd considered a nasty secret. Especially considering their extensive history--none of which had ever really been pleasant.
Before she opened her eyes, Harriet already knew she was at St. Mungo’s—a place she hated even more than the Hospital Wing, in part due to the fact that it was far more public, far more crowded and the Healers had far less bedside manner than Madam Pomfrey. She could hear the bloody beeping and whirring of magically run machines, could hear someone whispering, just out of earshot. Merlin, if it was Hermione she already knew what was coming. Suggesting an extended vacation, a leave of absence to focus on herself.
Harriet had lifted her wand in an attempt to cast another spell, to track the fourth but the simple movement alone brought her too her knees and a scream tore from her lips before she could stop it.
"Oh, piss off," Harriet muttered with a roll of her eyes, though her lips were turned upwards, "Why did we hate each other so much?" It was a stupid question, but warranted.
to come here, Malfoy. You're the one who asked if it was possible for us to be friends. I came here because I wanted to, Merlin knows why after this shit--I'm trying this new thing, see, where I don't go around fucking
“Come off it, Ron, this is the closest you’ve been in months to grabbing them. You have to admit he knows what he’s doing. And he did compromise himself to help Harriet.”
It was ironic, Harry thought, how after years of wanting the spotlight and attention, Malfoy had now become someone that was comfortable staying away from the public eye, especially when it came to his good deeds. She’d wondered what Malfoy had been up to—briefly of course. It wasn’t like he had to work, what with the sizable vault the Malfoy family owned in Gringotts. It reeked something like retribution, and Harriet felt an unwarranted surge of anger and annoyance. Here Malfoy was, trying to redeem himself for no one but himself—and yet, their meeting the other night had left her certain that he was still the same poncy git he’d been to her in school. It was horribly annoying that she cared so much. Especially since she’d promised herself that she was going to write him off entirely. How could she do that now, what with him helping them track down the same monsters they were looking for.
"This doesn't feel right to me," she admitted, biting her lip and scanning the faces that walked past them. It was a small town, very easy for them to draw attention to themselves, "C'mon, let's pop into the pub for a pint. If anyone's seen them, it'll have been the barman. Or the town drunk," she suggested and led the way.
They were nearing the outskirts of town, Harriet was seemingly entirely alone, but her wand was in her hand and she new, though she couldn't see them, the others were close enough to come to her aid if needed. They'd walked nearly every cobble-stone street in the village, casting detection charms and searching for magical signatures. She'd even resorted to using the "point me!" spell, despite Robards telling them it was next to useless and not efficient enough to trust, but well, it told her to keep moving straight, in the direction of an abandoned manor she could only see if she lifted her hand to shield the glare of the sun from her eyes.
Hermione chimed in, “Quite ingenious, really. With his...personal experience and insight. Of course, for publicity reasons, his name can’t be formally attached to the Ministry but, well, he doesn’t seem to care about that at all.”
She smiled crookedly and inwardly accepted what was about as close to an apology as she was like to get. Instead of holding a grudge, she picked up where their pleasant conversation had left off, "It's because of "everything" that I don't hate you, Malfoy."
"You've got to be joking," she muttered to herself, her hand instinctively reaching to clasp the locket around her neck. The Stag--was this for real? Of all pubs in London that Malfoy could have picked...this was the one? She'd never been much for Divination--but this should have been a good sign. Or, it could have been a sign that this was an utterly terrible idea. Harriet shook her head and stepped inside. With a brief pause by the door, she surveyed the mild crowd and moved immediately to the platinum blonde head of hair at a table for two.
Malfoy looked wary, hesitant to take her word for it, but he put up his mask again as he spoke, "Even after everything--you're a strange creature, Potter."
All she could think about was how she still desperately missed Remus and the way Tonks seemed to make him smile brighter than she'd ever seen before. How George seemed to be overcompensating for the loss of his other half, but the light in his eyes seemed entirely extinguished.
