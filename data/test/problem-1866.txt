He woke up to his someone banging on his bedroom door "Harry get your ass up!!" someone said harry could smell the cigarette smoke threw the door.
"Uh.." Ron started sweating his mouth dry
Draco pouted pulling harry closer to him "Let go of me!" Harry shouted
"I don't even know who you are?!" Harry shouted
Realizing this, Harry shook his head with a smile. It was pretty funny, after all, and he’d never been the type to become bashful at his own misfortune.
His fingers gripped tendrils of raven hair by the handful, tugging him impossibly closer. Harry only responded by mashing himself against his body, yearning for every piece of their essence to become matched. The Gryffindor seemed to lurch forward, teeth clicking against Draco’s as he allowed his mouth to succumb fully to their kiss. His hands were warm and left tingles as they wrapped around the bare skin of Draco’s neck.
“You are pathetic.” The voice of his father shakes the walls, breaks the foundation. Rips open the fortress of his solitude, jagged lines coursing through his very being and down to his core.
Harry laughed. “I suppose that’s a compliment, hm?”
“Your memory charms were surprisingly astute, Mr. Black. But nonetheless illegal, and hazardous. I am very thankful that you did not inflict everlasting damage on your fellow classmates, regardless of the wrongs they committed. I am very disappointed in you all.”
They laughed hysterically when Daphne left the room.
It most definitely had NOTHING to do with his sexuality. But somehow... Malfoy had found another of his irritating, sensitive spots. And Harry all but snapped.
And then Sirius was leaning toward his ear, the brush of his words a hot breath against his neck.
Harry isn’t here. Here, it’s a Malfoy’s paradise, and Draco’s skin crawls at the realistic image of his father before him. He’s so fucking life-like, the drawl of his criticism dripping with the poison of a basilisk. He’s smiling, and that hurts. It’s malicious.
This isn’t right. Harry was supposed to die, yes. But not Malfoy. Even an arch nemesis’s demise is oddly unsettling after so many lives had been claimed.
“Tired?” He asked casually, taking in their surroundings.
Harry chuckles. Draco swallows, and it’s a hard knot in the back of his throat.
Draco wasn’t sure if his tears were visible, or obvious at all, but something in him didn’t care. He was done with feeling pathetic. He needed a win. An out. An answer.
“If you are alive, you will be shunned from the Malfoy name. Take this knowledge with you as you move forward.”
“Are you fucking kidding me? Don’t you two lovebirds realize there are people trying to fucking WALK here?” The sarcastic drawl of Malfoy had all but killed what little mood there was for Harry, and he’d hated him for it at the time. Especially because he was still fighting through his struggling sexuality, and hadn’t come to terms with the fact that it wasn’t Ginny or himself that was the problem.
“Who let you in, father? Who arranged for this?”
“Your father was a very brave man, you know. I didn’t have to live back then to see that.”
Daphne was clearly at a loss for words, and Draco seized the opportunity flawlessly.
And suddenly Harry was thinking about his lips, and how they might taste like that certain kind of redemption that flips the world upside down. And he knew he was drunk, because when had he ever thought about snogging Malfoy? If he was really honest with himself, he’d find that this wasn’t the first time.
It was one of his own silent spells that broke Harry’s defense, and within microseconds both boys were on the ground. They didn’t appear to be wounded severely; the aftermath of the shield must have deflected some of the power from each curse.
Draco swallows.
"I fancy you."
“That’s the thing.” Harry pressed the mug into his shaking hands, letting out a shuddering exhale. “That’s what
"I don't—I'm fine, Potter," Draco mumbles, "you really don't need to stay here."
They do start training together.
"You get all the dates you want," Harry says tiredly. "Just please try not to jump in front of more lethal curses anytime soon, yeah?"
. The sad thing is, for once, Draco actually agrees with it. He doesn’t want to. He doesn’t want to go back there, but he can’t help it: he’s
It’s either that, or the bottles Potter paid for, or perhaps the touching, or sitting together on the couch. Or the way he treats him. It definitely has to be
"You might have noticed if you'd ever bothered trying to talk to me."
, though he has to admit all of that does cross his mind once or twice. “I was just thinking that this here is pretty close to that.”
"Is this your weird way of asking me out on a date?" Draco quipped, only to instantly regret his words.
. He definitely doesn’t say,
Draco's head snaps up. His muscles tense up so fast he has to let go of the cup to hide the shaking in his hands because he can almost hear the silent 'to you' at the end of that sentence—he's always been special to you, hasn't he?—and
“The ghosts?” she asked, and at Harry’s nod she said, “Yes, all right,” followed by an extremely long sigh. She closed the door, and after that Harry heard some rambling inside, metal on metal and who knows what else. The door opened again, only this time it opened fully. “Sooo... um,” Hermione began, “would you like some...”
Draco leans back in his chair, rubbing a hand across his face. "He did come back."
Draco's heart crashes like the glacial shard it is. This is why he didn't want to come. This is why he'd told Pansy he'd do best to stay at home.
“Alas, all my time spent trying to fool you. You hear that? Time, spent. You could have
"I think you should take a holiday," Pansy tells him as she walks in. She slings her cloak across Draco's worktable, knocking aside several volumes on numerology. Draco stares at them morosely, but doesn't move to pick them up.
“Somehow, I doubt he needs them.” He already
,” Draco interrupts, “like you and me. And they’re quite nice, too.” Even nicer than most wizards, in spite of their trolls on YouTube and their Mr. Trololo. Draco still doesn’t get that last one, but Muggles seem to think he’s hilarious. “I mean that, Pans. Insult them not.”
"Merlin! What's up with you?" Potter asks, casting a wandless
"Harry!" Granger calls.
“No,” Draco says. “You’re a shag, and that’s that.”
Harry cast a
But somehow, as days go by, he’s less and less convinced by his own mind. Perhaps he should get a new one, clearly the one he owns is broken.
Potter stays out of his way through the rest of the day, but drops by his lab again once his work day is over. He sits on one of the long tables near the door, watching quietly as Draco checks his potions and pours his Antidote to Uncommon Poisons into tiny vials.
"No, I meant . . . now." Potter chews on his bottom lip. "Would you be willing to come back to the UK now?"
Potter looks up at him and smiles. “Shut up,” he says, a thread of amusement in his tone.
useless; the Dark Lord was
to be. He has a long list of people he’s slept with; Potter is definitely not one of them, but to have him wriggle against him, pressing their hips tight together whenever Draco finds a good spot to suck on, Merlin. It’s pretty much like heaven rediscovered, and Draco is quite pleased with that. He’s only just found out Potter likes having his neck kissed—did he know that already?
Meanwhile, Ron stared at Hermione. “Wait...” He stared at Harry. “... what ghost?”
Draco’s having none of it, clamping his hands around the newspaper in defiance and refusing to let go. What the hell is she on about now, the bint’s not playing with a full deck. “I should
But somehow, it works.
“It can’t be. I can’t be,” he murmurs. “I don’t—I can’t even remember the bond…”
The first touch of their mouths is soft, almost more of a brush than a kiss. But then Draco, who’s nothing if not determined when it comes to kissing Potter, leans forward, pressing his lips harder against Potter’s as he tilts his head slightly to one side.
Some of them notice anyway, and he once slips and tells one of them he's pregnant. The man seems shocked at first, but then he just laughs and slaps Draco's back like he's just heard a particularly good joke.
*   *   *
Their wands are cold against his skin, and their magic makes Draco's nerves twist and quiver in a way that feels both ticklish and unfriendly—
"Like it meant nothing," Potter adds quietly. "Like
Draco nods, ignoring the burning sensation behind his eyes. He knows this won't last forever, but he can't help wishing . . . Merlin, he used to be so good at hiding behind a mask, but these days it's as if he's this giant ball of hormones and mood swings, and it's so bloody tiresome, and he feels
What on Earth was going on?
Instead, Draco wakes up alone. He only knows he's in St Mungo's because it reeks of healing potions and disinfectant—the smell so strong it's beginning to make his nose itch. He's only alone for a few minutes before Harry walks in, holding a mug. He looks tired. He's still wearing his uniform, and there are black smudges under his eyes. Dry blood splattered on his chest. Draco's blood.
His brain loses the plot.
“No? You certainly looked like you were.”
Potter shakes his head. “One day, I’m telling you. One day you’ll stay.”
"They do when there's magic involved," Draco counters. "Besides, need I remind you that we went from hating each other to being linked at the hip, as you so nicely put it, as well? Because it happened just before what you just mentioned, and yet—"
"SHUT THE HELL UP!" Harry shouted from his room making draco and pansy snapped the head to see where the noise was coming from pansy eyes widen
"Oh I took it" Draco said leaning on the counter
"Draco?" Harry said rubbing his eyes making sure he wasn't crazy, Draco woke to harry starring at him with a glare
"Huh?" Harry head snapped to the door
"What do you want pansy" Draco crossed his arms
"Bodyguard's?" Harry was confused
"Haha" harry rolled his eyes and started walking away
"You smell like smoke" Harry rolled his eyes
"No your not"
"Rude...." Hermione said muttering and taking a shot at her glass
"Ow..." Harry said with his face on floor potter got up from the floor and yawned he left his to see draco sitting near the stairs
"Oh sorry" Harry pushed his hair back
Harry let out a groan "MOM!!!" harry slammed his foot down making the naked man wake up his mother didn't say anything
"I have some clothes for you"
"Sure come in..." Harry said backing away from the window
"Come on where not that far" Ron started to pull harry sleeves kind of aggressively
"Well you got a sassy one" Pansy said
"I forgot" Draco said giving harry a smile
"I'm going home call me if you want to come over..." Hermione said with hiccups and burps' coming out
______________
"Oh your up" The mystery man said
"You asked to come here" draco got closer to harry
"Master harry" Someone said knocking on the door
"Shush"
"This is draco boyfriend.." Ron pushed harry to Percy
"What where friends if you didn't hear me" Ron glared at Ginny
"Where are my clothes?" harry took of the green jacket
Harry opens the door to the tv on and his dad passed out on the couch and beer bottles on the floor and a very unsettling noise coming from his parents room he rolled his eyes he took off his shoes and threw them to the floor he started to walk threw beer bottles and the floor.
"Do want anything else?" the bartender ask looking at harry empty cup
"You forgot!?" Harry shouted
Percy gave harry and ron and dark glare "And who his the small person your holding?"
Harry grinned inexplicably wide, a wholesome addition to the excitement of the evening. “You ready?”
A cough turned into aching joints and belly cramps that Harry pretended didn’t exist and that Draco massaged in the evenings. The two were inseparable by now, making somewhat of an unspoken home at Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
There it was, lying innocently on one of the tables in the eighth year common room like some kind of sick joke. Harry approached it, alone and painfully curious as he bit his lip with apprehension.
When Lucius Malfoy turned to a pre-occupied Lupin and raised his wand, Draco felt his own pulse hammering beyond control. His body pulled forward instinctively, like every bone in his body was tied to the deepest level of his subconscious. The layer that up until detention had been safely tucked away without the light that it would need to inevitably flourish...
He quelled his Gryffindor instinct, however, when another idea crossed his mind. If Draco wouldn’t wake, he’d just have to get him out of there on his own.
He couldn’t stand, he could hardly move as the fire traveled into his toes and up his hamstrings. he knew things were getting close to the end, or something like it, when a shadow above him signaled the very presence of his captor.
“I guess,” was the reply, muffled slightly by the end of his yawn. “It must be getting late. Time seems different here.”
Regardless, he refused to let Draco Malfoy suffer another moment. As long as he lived, he vowed to himself that Draco Malfoy would be safe.
They could’ve stayed like that forever, but why would they? There was an entire world outside of the pensieve waiting to be conquered.
“You caN NOT tell me you’re enjoying this.”
“His tail is kinda wormy though.”
Harry was buried next to his parents in Godric’s Hollow. It was the first time that Ron Weasley held onto Draco like he’d never be able to stand on his own again. It was the first time Draco Malfoy had cried on Hermione’s shoulder. It was the day that his life would change forever, again.
They stepped in formally, approaching the center of the room with their wands drawn.
“Alright, we’re wrapping up! Let me check your work before I dismiss you all for winter break.” Slughorn starts making his rounds, and Malfoy’s shoulders slump disappointedly.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Hermione rolled her eyes. “She healed Harry by using the Liquid Luck. After consuming Felix Felicis, everything you attempt is more likely to succeed.”
The astronomy tower was far less elusive in the daylight, beams of sunshine flooding over the rails and banishing the shadows.
Around them, the bright white background began to form into shapes. Rows of beds. Nightstands with potions and healing salves. The infirmary.
The haughty scoff belonged to Draco’s father, and it caused a series of laughs to emerge from the group.
He heard it again. Voldemort’s confusion turned to anger as understanding washed over him.
Together they snuck out of the Great Hall, and Harry followed earnestly. It was much more entertaining than re-living his own experience at the Yule Ball.
“Please, Potter...” Harry pressed another kiss to the smooth skin of his neck. “The decor alone makes me want to vomit.”
“I have no doubt in my mind that you will do great things in my name,” He declared confidently, “but I must know that your intentions are pure. I have a few...challenges for you to endure.”
The moon was falling. And the wolf was howling, crying desperately as his bones broke again. Slowly, they shrank and blended into what would become Remus again.
Their next conquest settled in the library. It was mostly empty, the exception of which was Sirius and Remus perched across from each other at a back table.
“Sirius! Where’s your wand?”
“I’m a fucking traitor, that’s how.” He shakes his head at himself, as if he’s reliving his last choices. “But, want to know something completely mental? I don’t care.”
The next day, Teddy enters to find Draco drawing a picture of his family at the kitchen table.
“What the fuck is going on?”
A memory, broken against the floor, close enough that he was able to experience it. Images flashed in his mind’s eye, like a movie playing against the backdrop of his vision loss.
Potter had approached him in the library. He’d been peacefully studying for his NEWTs until a familiarly annoying presence slid into the seat across from him.
Draco rolled his eyes with a smile. “Of course not. We’re prettier than all of them combined.”
“Wha... what are you talking about? You can’t be there with me. I’ll hurt you all.” His gaze fell to the floor, ashamed.
Harry shook his head in a somber form of agreement. This was definitely not good. Horrible. The end, quite possibly.
He jolts back to look at him, but his lids have come to a gentle close. His chest rises and falls in a shallow rhythm, and Harry notices the amount of blood that’s pooled around them.
Draco’s cheeks were scarlet; Harry’s ears a bright crimson.
“Harry,” She called. But his name sounded foreign, like it had never belonged to him. He tried to respond, but his voice was lost somewhere in the craze. He stared at her, squinting as her image finally quit swaying.
“Goddamn reptile.”
After the funeral, Draco couldn’t figure out what sick, masochistic part of him led his body to the same muggle park where they’d swung together on that fateful day.
“Draco, darling, what’s wrong? Haven’t gotten anything to eat yet?” His sour expression was an obvious indicator to his circumstances.
It cracked, and shattered against the floor. And Harry was confused. Why was this happening...
James shared a knowing glance with Sirius and Peter before speaking.
“You’re kidding, right?” He laughed dryly. “You saved the fucking world, Harry. You saved me. And all I was was a coward. I didn’t do the right thing. I don’t deserve you.”
The edges of such utopia began to fade into the darkest of charcoals, scratching closer and closer to the image’s center. Harry squinted, straining to see the smiling faces before him. He didn’t want them to leave, but they were fading rapidly, clouded by the chalky black substance that was his mind moving to another place, another time.
It’s midnight when Draco feels the gentle presence of Harry slumped against his shoulder, his quiet snores a rhythm that he begins to memorize.
“He completely betrayed you and the rest of us. There’s no other way they could’ve found out where you were. I hope you’re not thinking about forgiving him!”
Harry let go into the nothingness as it consumed them.
Harry cocked his head stupidly before getting frustrated at the circular logic.
Harry marveled at the boy before him. He was absolutely beautiful, and, somehow, he was his. The entire prospect was almost unbelievable. Almost.
“What do you mean, Ginny? Of course I do.”
This was the least of his worries at the moment, however. The look on Malfoy’s face revealed that he felt similarly, fear eating them from the inside. Would they be expelled? Punished? Never allowed to return?
Falling in love. Knowing that the boy before him was good and wholesome. Having faith in someone like he’d never had before. Wanting to keep him forever.
Draco, for a split second, appeared as if he might cry. Pansy, with a satisfied smile, began stirring counter clockwise.
They waited for class to end, and Draco tapped his foot dramatically.
“Better, actually. It’s amazing what a few healing spells and a bottle of Skele-gro can do for a fracture.” His words were ominous, but there was something about the way the silver of his eyes glinted. He was humored by something.
“Secondly,” he continued, still doubled over with laughter, “If Peter can do it, we can. Come on.”
“This is Felix Felicis,” he announced, and Draco’s eyes widened. “Or, as some call it, liquid luck.”
“Not much,” Remus eyed the window. “My ribs already hurt. The moon’s rising.”
With a determined face, Sirius furrowed his brow and began his own transformation.
“Draco, I don’t know fucking how, but when the fiendfyre caught your leg… it must have reversed the effects of the snake bite.” He’s smiling, a wide, wholesome grin, and Draco finally catches his breath.
A doe.
“Shall we continue?” Nott asked aloud as the giggling died down.
Things became eerily quiet and still as the creatures held a scrutinizing gaze with them both.
“My son, standing defensively next to Harry Potter. I never thought I’d see the day. But, then again, I was wrong.”
Sirius Black, falling through the other side. Losing him forever. Feeling like he had no one left in the world.
“It’s... coming. I’m having some trouble with the staircases.”
“Thank you.” His eyes were full of honesty, and Sirius was sure his stomach was going to flutter away. Instead, he decided to anchor himself to the boy in front of him by pulling him in for another kiss.
All he knew, all he could think about, was how his heart broke in several places for the boy before him. And that somehow, that boy grew up to be Draco Malfoy. And suddenly everything was very clear and understandable, and Harry felt like a git for ever picking a fight with the bloke.
“Let’s get it over with, Theo.”
“Don’t tell me you’ve decided to follow in Moony’s foot steps?”
Silence. How was he supposed to answer to that? Was he even required to?
“But you can’t be this person, Draco! I need you to be better than this! I need you to beat Voldemort. I- I can’t do it without you.”
Harry could fight it no longer. The grin that spread across his cheeks was involuntarily giddy. He laughed, shaking his head as his eyes met Draco’s. Again.
“Weak,” Blaise commented, and Draco rebutted playfully: “just trying to keep things interesting, my friend.”
Harry was frozen in his current state, unable to form words, let alone sentences. Out of nowhere, his instinct kicked in, took over, and answered what he knew to be hiding all along.
“This is none of your goddamn business, Malfoy. Put your head back up your own arse where it belongs and stay out of what you can’t begin to understand.”
“And why is that?”
Regulus, on the other hand, came forward. He slowly approached the large dog before him, eyes narrowed with sudden certainty. The growling increased, throaty and louder with each inch he came closer.
But that’s not what happened. And Weasley still won. And would always win. With his happy family, and his hand-me-down robes... why was he suddenly jealous of the Weasel?
“Harry,” the soft whisper of Draco snapped him from his reverie. “It’s time to fight the real enemy here.”
There was no sign of Wormtail or Prongs anywhere. Harry’s eyes darted about, determined to land on him but coming up vastly empty. Where the fuck were the others? Had they run? That would’ve been smart, but not quite in the style of James Potter. He’d have to be around there. Somewhere.
“Forgive me, returning to an empty home sounds rather appealing, doesn’t it?”
“Hey, Pans, want to be my date to the Yule ball?”
He laughed maniacally, and Harry attempted to pull himself toward the sound. His attempts were futile; they went unnoticed.
“Look around you. What do you see?”
“Holy shit, Sirius, you’re huge!” James gaped, giving his friend a pat between the ears.
“We know. It’s okay, Peter. Let’s just try to start fresh.” Remus smiled softly, in that mature, open minded wya of his that Sirius both loved and hated.
“What do you say we... sneak some of the adult beverages?”
Harry knew it was bad, but a very own personal torcher chamber in their basement? It was a whole new level of unsettling. Suddenly he wondered if being the Chosen One was the burden he’d claimed that it once was. He’d never known that life on the other side of the coin could be just as heavy and dark.
There was a hint of anxiety in Draco’s voice as he followed the Gryffindor. Turns out he wasn’t as confident as he made himself sound, Harry thought with an internal smirk.
He felt both chillingly irate and sorry for him.
“Of course, how could I forget? My husband winning the Savior of the Wizarding World award a few years ago.”
Was it evident in his face that his heart had skipped a beat? It must’ve been clear that he wasn’t expecting this question with the silence that followed as he formulated a response.
“What should we have felt?”
“So, you and James, huh?” Remus speculated when they were in the distance. Lily chuckled.
Or what he wanted to do next.
“We’re going to become animagi.”
He came to a standing position, statuesque in his determination to see his father, and consequently his past, falter.
They were in the familiarity of the Gryffindor dormitory. All were present except Remus, and Harry noticed Draco cock his head observantly.
Voldemort smiled. “Yes, the grand Harry Potter is about to be extinguished. And in your death, only then can I truly... survive.”
Finally, Blaise broke the silence.
“I told you! I heard him on the train! He’s plotting something! He told Pansy that he’d spoken with Voldemort himself!”
“It was the killing curse, don’t you see? Some rather dark magic. Right up my alley, if I say so myself. It couldn’t take your life, as it was merely a memory. And so, it sent you here, Within the depths of your own mind. Awful things have happened to wizards who have attempted to alter memories, you know.”
“I... I want in. I’m tired of being the little guy. I want to be a part of something big. Something powerful.”
“No, silly, we kiss.”
His once cool facade had crumbled into someone desperate and manic with desire. Draco looked at him, really allowed himself to sink into the character of his housemate. The boy he thought was his friend, his fellow snake.
“You don’t have the guts to kill me,” he spat as the war continued all around them.
From beside him, Sirius felt a gentle squeeze of his right hand.
Snape, Zabini, and Dumbledore continued to attack while Pansy remained crouched beside Potter.
“Well, if I were you, I would make sure of it.” His words hung in the air between them as he turned on one foot and led the gang of Slytherins away.
“Let’s hang it on the fridge!” Teddy exclaims, grasping it and running to attach it to the front of the surface.
And in a sense, he has. Thanks to Draco Malfoy.
Pansy parted her lips, and he followed out of curiosity. The way she moved was normal, expected even, but he was chaste against her. He brought a hand to her cheek, attempting to pull themselves deeper into the kiss. His gesture was a raw attempt at forcing the pieces to fit regardless of his own inhibition.
“I’m going to get you all out of here,” he’d said as he released Ollivander and Lovegood from the cell. “Even Hermione.”
“Crabbe. Truth or dare?” Blaise turned to Pansy’s left as he resumed his spot next to Greengrass, who somewhat reluctantly placed her head right where it had been.
He placed his arm against the wall above his head, leaning in as suavely as he was able.
They were on their way to sixth year, just a few months prior to the present. He knew this because he saw his own figure spying on Malfoy’s compartment in the distance. He watched as he adorned the invisibility cloak, inconspicuous to anyone who didn’t know better.
A fucking doe.
It reminded him far too much of Snape’s old potion classroom for his liking.
“I cannot believe you actually got one.” Harry’s stomach leapt at the sound of his mother.
He doesn’t have a lot of time; he’s figured that much out. Even if he manages to outrun Voldemort, the poison will still inevitably travel through his circulatory system. He’s already broken into a cold sweat as he approaches his destination.
The white wisp he was used to seeing morphed like smoke into a bright shape that contrasted brightly against the night sky. At first, he couldn’t tell what it was, squinting his eyes from the light.
“Malfoy? What are you doing here?”
A knock on the door interrupted his cries, and he quickly wiped his tears with the back of his hand while stifling a sniffle.
Before, Lily would have rolled her eyes, stalking away as she judged his intentions. Not anymore.
And not a smirk, or a sneer, or anything so characteristically Malfoy. It was a true, genuine, honest grin.
Pansy sighed before meeting eyes with her best friend. “Draco, honey, are you gay?”
“Especially you, Draco. You deserve much more than that. You deserve... you deserve the world.”
“A little,” Pansy admitted with a smile. He couldn’t help but chuckle at her honesty. When silence befell them, Pansy leaned forward.
They were visited by another scene. Before them, a visibly bothered Remus Lupin was trying to focus on a much younger McGonnagal’s transfiguration lecture.
He squinted, attempting to focus his vision . He had to know who was speaking, who was casting a healing charm...
He gapes stupidly, breath heading as he grasps the fact that he’s suddenly fucking alive and his leg doesn’t hurt and there’s no bite. And Harry fucking Potter is still holding him, and it’s so much that he can’t handle it.
“Well, what do you say we find out?”
Voldemort had spoken the words himself, in the foyer of Malfoy manor. He was repulsed by the snake-like manner of his body; the red of his eyes was horrifying. Draco wanted no part of this.
A sigh from the other Marauder, who briefly folded his head in his hands before turning back to Remus.
Somehow, it seemed eerily identical. The only noise was the soft squeak of the rusted chains he held onto as he swung softly again, alone this time.
Harry couldn’t make out where the door led, only that it was the most glaring opposition of darkness.
All of these thoughts seemed to fly through his brain within fractions of a second.
James had promised Lily that although she had to end their “date” early to go study, he’d catch up with her later. She rolled her eyes at his arrogance, as always, but Remus had caught the subtle smile that pulled at her lips as she walked away.
As if he didn’t have enough to deal with already.
“Well, would you look at that? Loony Lupin and the Blood traitor are in love.” Lucius Malfoy stepped forward, adding his two cents to the already blooming confrontation.
Suddenly, he noticed that the voice was farther back than it had initially been, and a quick look over his shoulder revealed that Lucius Malfoy had quit following him.
He chuckled softly before silently replying:  “of course.”
“Where are Black’s hands, Harry? Are they- oh my god- is he-?”
Malfoy’s eyes never lost their humor. Not as the world settled. Not even as the memory cleared to reveal another scene before them. His lips bore a slightly puzzled smirk, like he was trying to stifle a laugh. Harry’s head reeled.
Harry both cursed and worshiped his father for the sudden interruption.
They observed the tears begin to fall down Regulus’s cheeks, the red-rimmed look of regret tainting his eyes. They watched as he turned and punched the wall, upset at no one other than himself, before entering the Slytherin common room alone.
“Is that jealousy, I hear from your virginal arse?” Blaise flashed him a grin as Greengrass returned with her drink.
He’d never had to pretend. He’d never had the weight of his parent’s lives toppling against his shoulders; Voldemort had already robbed them from him.
“Glad to hear it.” Blaise smiled, but quickly turned his attention to the lifeless figure of Harry Potter.
He could feel the embarrassment flood his face as he was sure that Draco was about to step away awkwardly. Completely freaked. He’d finish detention silently, standing by until his first opportunity to ditch.
He felt a tongue glide smoothly against his own, and it was one of the most intriguing sensations he’d ever felt. Draco was unable to control the soft moan that escaped his throat as he reciprocated.
What if there was a sword that he could use to slay the dragon? Once and for all?
Harry started, for some reason completely floored yet enchanted by the continuous change in character.
This wasn’t fair. This wasn’t right. This was far worse than anything Harry had experienced with the Dursley’s, and he would’ve never guessed that Lucius Malfoy’s number one fan would be at the receiving end of such magic.
“I can’t believe you two are out-Slytherining me.”
“Malfoy, what’s-“
When they emerged through the trap door, the sight before them was almost indescribable. There was no sound; only the pounding of Harry’s heart in his own ears as every detail registered and came to life.
“I cannot take you to him, I’m afraid. I don’t have that kind of... power. I am merely a concentration of all of Draco’s bad memories, embarrassments, failures, and, of course... fears.”
Unsure of exactly which world they had stumbled into.
He could see the doorway ahead, a looming entrance beyond that fueled his exhausted legs. He only now realized that he was sweating, droplets rolling off the back of his neck from the anticipation.
“The monster.”
Before Sirius could object, the bloke was already seating himself next to the solitary redhead, whose nose was vested in a book.
And Draco was laughing now, and they both were sharing in some kind of undiscovered release of tension between them. Like everything beyond this moment would figure itself out on its own.
“Sorry, Darling.”
Remus Lupin was pale. He didn’t move a muscle, didn’t twitch an inch. There was a greenish hue to his cheeks, like he might just up and vomit at any second.
The common room twisted and comforted into a starry night sky. Two boys at the rail, gazing forward after a long day of detention.
Twirling her fingers through her hair, Bellatrix stood laughing next to a confident Regulus Black. His shoulders were tall, square, and far unlike the boy Draco and Harry had seen crying outside of the Slytherin common room in the previous memory.
Harry’s patronus is a stag.
“Let’s go.” Malfoy led the way with Harry in tow. Pettigrew, it appeared, was meeting up with someone.
And he’d cheated his way through the entire time.
But it’s Potter who slides his hand from the wand and instead rests it on Draco’s hand.
When they entered the banquet hall, Draco paused to admire the sheer elegance of the decorations and setup.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it? He’s good. Bloody heroic. Spectacular. And my father is on the side of darkness. And now he’s in fucking prison because of it. And he’ll be lucky to be alive when he’s released...”
If you would’ve asked Harry a year ago, hell, a few months ago, if he’d ever have respect for a Malfoy, he would’ve laughed in your face.
“She’s right. Fuck what Potter thinks. We know what’s real, and that’s all that matters.” Blaise’s casual rationale caused a visible relaxation to overcome Draco’s rigid shoulders.
Beads of sweat were trailing from Draco’s brow, half from physical exertion but partly from fear and uncertainty. Harry couldn’t help but steal a glance in his direction as they ran. Even now, buried in a layer of subconscious and running from a gang of self-made demons... he was beautiful. And pure.
As she headed toward the refreshments, Draco shook his head playfully. “What in the hell were you thinking, Zabini?”
“Why should I?”
They approached the edge of town almost stealthily. When Harry reached the shrieking shack, Malfoy in tow, they were met by an appeased Dumbledore exiting into the open.
It came as genuine surprise the day he opened the bathroom door to find none other than Potter in his usual spot, a heap of robes and muffled sobs on the floor. He froze, unsure of what the fuck to do. Would it be smarter to leave unnoticed? Or ready his wand for a defensive brawl? He didn’t quite have the energy for the latter, and when Potter’s green stare snapped upward, he knew he’d be caught. Red-rimmed and desperate, Draco had never witnessed such a vulnerable state from the boy in front of him.
This time, she grinned in a way that showed just how much trust she placed in the young man next to her. She didn’t object, not even in the slightest, when he leaned in and pressed his lips to hers.
“Well, if it isn’t he famous Harry Potter,” he mocked, and Harry’s knees trembled slightly. This wasn’t how he remembered this going. What was happening?
Between breaths and bouts of lips pressed against each other, Sirius’s response sent chills up Remus’s spine:  “you’re worth it. You will always be worth it.”
His body was buckling, and Harry knew he was having some sort of panic attack. The trauma, it was far too much... Harry wouldn’t blame the boy for giving in, his father’s hold on him much like the kiss of a dementor...
Without further thought or hesitation, Harry scooped Draco up into his arms and, though his lanky, weighted form made it difficult to balance, began heading in the opposite direction. Maybe, if he could just get back to the door that had once connected to the library...
And if he was in Draco’s memory... what had become of him? Was he that much closer to finding him? Or was this all some kind of twisted, whimsical game of the pensieve?
“I understand why you hit me. I was being kind of an arsehole. I’m sorry you and the Weaselette didn’t work out.”
“Quite the deducer, now aren’t we? It’s a shame that you weren’t the one behind this extravaganza.” Lucius curled his lip, disgusted at what he somehow had found out about his son.
“To Draco, darling. For all of the wonderful things you’ve done.”
“Who else would I be talking to?” James raised a suspicious eyebrow, and Peter hiccuped.
“Never mind. You’ll see.”
“Need some tips on music, Potter? I’m just glad I haven’t lost the damned thing.” He extended his hand, and Harry cocked his head confusedly as he readied himself to hand it back.
“Fucking Potter,” he muttered instead, and Harry noticed his cover up as if it had slapped him across the face. “I’m just trying to walk and I run face first into him snogging the goddamn Weaselette outside in an open corridor.”
The knot in his gut untwisted into something more fuzzy.
Harry was both relieved and disappointed at the news. He was grateful to have the freedom to do all kinds of things- with Draco specifically- but there was a nagging feeling, sinking in his gut...
“Hey, Moons, How’s the map coming?” Sirius draped an arm around Lupin, who was bent over what appeared to be a sketch of the castle.
Harry dived toward his father, adrenaline pushing him forward without warning. Lily was absolutely flabbergasted and knelt with an attempt to tend to James.
Something was definitely off. And Draco was nowhere to be found. The silence rattled a sort of tenseness down his spine. A sense of impending dread prickled from his hair to his toes as he stepped forward, wandless and wondering what in the fuck was going to happen next.
“I- you-“ Harry stuttered, realizing that for some reason, Malfoy wasn’t going to hit him back. He shuffled confusedly, trying to make sense of what had happened. He didn’t get much farther before McGonnagal approached them.
“Wh- where are we? Potter? What in the hell is going on? Did you take us captive?” He immediately became defensive, and James raised his hands in an attempt to calm him.
“Levicorpus!” He cried, and Snape was instantly suspended upside down in mid-air. The others began drawing their wands, but Sirius was already disarming them one by one.
“Who’s a good boy, who’s a good boy?” Peter dramatically called, speaking in a high pitched whine that had Sirius growling and James giggling.
Oh. Oh. Fuck.
There was something slightly different about his face, though. It was as if a flash of genuine hurt had crossed his eyes, silver irises blending into the depth of a storm. In that moment, Harry felt nothing short of confusion.
As he passed where Harry stood, completely oblivious to his presence, the tightness in his stomach twisted. He fought the urge to cry, or scream at himself. He wasn’t sure which.
But on the contrary, he’d began to catch himself smiling more and more during their practice sessions. Potter would comment on their budding friendship; Draco would tell him to sod off.
He wasn’t drowning, or floating, but was suspended somewhere between the two. It wasn’t bliss, but it was far more tolerable than despair.
Their surroundings were dark, almost pitch black except the soft glow of the moonlight through a nearby window.
As soon as she realized who the wands were pointed at, she turned abruptly to focus at the Marauders.
And then, as if everything leading up to this moment wasn’t enough, Draco grasped Harry’s hand and led him through the classroom door.
“So, Evans, were sixth years now.” His eyebrows wiggled beneath his glasses.
Eighth year at Hogwarts was intended to be one of educational fulfillment, a chance to finish one’s goal of mastering NEWT level witchcraft and wizardry. What it had become, however, was quite the opposite.
“Are you Okay?” Malfoy’s voice caused him to start, drawing a solid line through his thoughts that so happened to be centered around the boy himself.
Dumbledore smiled. “Why, they were a combination of vials collected from myself, Professor Lupin, and mostly your Godfather, Harry.”
“Oh, Sod off.” He crossed his arms as Blaise shrugged with his inability to help himself as his excuse. And then, in an attempt to change the subject:  “Nott. Truth or dare.”
Potter grinned facetiously, and Malfoy responded with a light push on the shoulder.
At once, his father was vomiting. Lily was patting a gentle hand on his back, trying to prevent him from aspirating.
“I love you, too. Ferret.”
He allows his thoughts to consume him, until his leg is painless. He’s floating, flying… until he’s not.
He pulls his leg to the Room of Requirement, where he knows Potter will be. He’s known him far too long to guess his motives. His plans were like clockwork, a rhythmic and predictable rouse. Or maybe, Draco was just that keen at sensing his thoughts and ideas.
But that’s not what he wanted.
Every remark was chimed from a different individual, instilling the chilling effect of a full on chorus.
Draco was angry. And when he was mad, he was like fire.
How could he look Malfoy in the eye, when it turns out he was right?
Nott’s confident expression seemed to melt into one of disgust. “What the fuck, Dray?”
“Yes.” Remus smiled as he watched the boys coming into view along the skyline.
Regulus Black’s whiny demeanor suddenly shifted into something more maniacal. “When I get to the Headmaster first, and I tell him that you’re unregistered animagi... you’re all going to jail. You’re all going to rot!” He cackled loudly, almost on the brink of insanity himself. “And Lupin? He won’t make it that far. They’ll execute him before he gets to trial!”
Draco Malfoy slowly lifted himself from the ground, a bit wobbly but secure. He blocked each spell weakly but successfully.
“But what does that have to do with what woke me?” Harry interjected, and Draco shook his head playfully at how cute his ignorance was. Everyone else had figured it out, except him.
His thoughts drifted to happier times, and promises of I love you. And, as the breeze settled around him, he vowed to never let go of that. To forever hold onto that stupid, loony grin that made him fall head over heels for the Boy Who Lived. To never give up or relinquish that same hope that Harry held onto for most of his life.
The sound of triumphant joking bounced along the group as they returned to their post by the fire, resuming their same seating pattern.
“You deserve the world, Rem.”
“What the fuck are you?” Harry piped, swallowing his fear in favor for the traits that placed him in Gryffindor.
“The Dark Lord wants to know the progress of your plan. What have you done thus far to assure its completion?”
It was James’s turn to be on the receiving end of the growl. With a laugh from the others, Sirius morphed back. His face was beaming with excitement.
“Did it ever cross your mind that maybe I want friends, Harry? That maybe I would like to receive suspicious letters from someone else in the middle of the night?”
He landed in the tight embrace of Sirius Black, who instinctively jumped to catch him. His arms were wrapped warmly around him as his reality began to crumble in the form of sobs.
Malfoy’s silver eyes penetrated through him like a double edged sword, curiosity striking all other emotion. Neither dared break the stare that held them motionless to the floor of Gryffindor tower.
Harry lifts the invisibility cloak, revealing his secret. “I needed some fresh air.”
“Not much has changed, huh?”
“Go. Now. Trust me.” He spoke softly, and Harry was about to refuse, to plead that they enter together. But he saw a desperation there, hidden beneath steel, and he knew not to argue. That it had to be this way, somehow. And he gulped, nodding subtly before stepping through the door to the unknown.
Everything remained coated in pitch black darkness. He groaned, adjusting his glasses merely by touch as he pulled himself to a standing position. Extending his arms forward, he wondered what in the hell he was going to do next, when the world began to brighten.
They were lying on the ground together, Sirius’s dark fur meshing with the lighter brown of the wolf’s. His head was lying across he wolf’s neck; the wolf’s head was on the floor between his own paws.
One environment faded into another entirely, and Harry was interested to see that he’d landed in the midst of the Slytherin common room. It was dark, and the fire blazed an unlikely green flame.
Instantly, Lucius Malfoy was bound and completely debilitated as he hit the floor below him. He writhed and wriggled against the magical restraints burning orange-yellow on his wrists and ankles. Draco had never performed a binding spell so effective, so strong. So full of passion and intent.
“Oh-ok. But you guys better not be getting into trouble! Or I will get the Headmaster!”
“What happened?” Potter is close, too close, and Draco finds it hard to catch his breath. That’s what happens when you’re dying, right?
“You’re far more clever than I’ve ever given you credit for, Pansy.” Hermione admired as she listened to each detail keenly.
He was in what appeared to be the Department of Mysteries. Rows and rows of glowing white orbs lines shelves on either side of the room. He slowly stepped forward, brow creased as he wondered how the fuck Draco had any memory of this place. It couldn’t have been his own; his solitude lacked the necessary presence of those who had traveled with him to this place last year.
His pain was like the loudest screech to Harry, and now that he rested the room fell silent once more. A stark contrast against the relief washing over his insides was the menacing smile that pulled across Voldemort’s lips.
“We were both young when I first saw you...”
The cheers from the Gryffindors were deafening. Harry beamed with pride as he watched his father high five his team mates.
Tears resurfaced against sharp, desperate cheeks. “What the fuck are we going to do?”
“Fuck,” muttered James as they neared.
Draco shook his head with an amused twitch of his lips. Nott whistled.
Draco raised an arm, resting it around Potter’s shoulder. It was an awkward gesture, but when the boy continued to cry harder, Draco knew it hadn’t been in vain. His thoughts floated to his own experiences, and he came to realize quickly that he and Potter were not far unlike each other. Had Harry ever been held? Without parents, who had been there to comfort him? His friends were nowhere to be found at the moment, and that let Draco know that he was battling far more on his own than he’d let on.
He made up his mind that day. From then on, he’d be nobody’s pawn. He was going to prosper, and not even the Dark Lord would stop him.
“Yes. I’m surprised I haven’t gotten kicked out yet, to be honest. I guess they can’t control me if I don’t officially live with them. The Potter’s have been great to me, though. They told me I’m always welcome here.”
Draco knelt by Harry, a protective arm looped beneath his biceps for support. As they stared motionlessly above them, Draco felt helpless. And that’s when he had an epiphany.
A sigh of relief escaped as a small consequence of a much bigger picture. He was alive, and that was something.
“Isn’t it your name?”
With this in mind, Harry began to sift through the objects on his desk, searching for anything that might be a clue. He turned to the bookshelf, running his hand along the spine of several works, eyeing the titles for anything regarding memories or the pensieve. Failure seemed imminent, and he turned to make sure that nothing around him had changed.
“I thought we were going to be expelled, for sure.”
“I know this is probably not the way you’d imagine this moment, but I just- I want to make you mine. Forever. I want the world to know how I’ve felt about you for years.”
Blaise and Pansy giggled excitedly before taking the bottle into their own hands.
In the next moment, Draco had buckled to his knees, teeth gritted and eyelids squeezed uncomfortably shut. His muscles quivered and jerked beneath the magic, unable to cope with the pain.
“Harry! Thank God You’re Alright!” The worried exclamation of Hermione pierced the atmosphere as she rushed to hug him. Beside her, Ron scrambled to make it to his side. Confused but grateful, Harry held on tightly until she retracted.
“I-I’m dying. My life, it flashed- I’m dying.” He stuttered, and suddenly the air was heavy and thick like fog. Images of Death Eaters, and Draco, and sparks flying in his direction...
“Okay, Okay, guys, I’m sure you’re all wondering why we’ve gathered you here today.” At the forefront of the Potter Estate living room was James, giving some sort of speech to a den full of people.
Draco stood silently while he continued.
For the first time, Harry shifted his focus to the boy in front of him. He appeared almost scared, a few shades paler than his normal vampiric tone. Suddenly, he felt sick to his own stomach. What if Draco didn’t want this? What if Zabini’s  intervention was only pious?
A peering look from his spot adjacent to him. Skepticism at its finest.
Remus Lupin, with a silly smile, had placed a peck to Sirius’s left cheek. In response, the more dramatic of the two pulled him in for full on mouth to mouth.
“Oh my gosh! I’d almost forgotten,” Remus admitted, “I hope you all didn’t go too far out of your way for me.”
“You think Potter is going to defeat the Dark Lord?” Draco asked skeptically, hanging on by the edge of his thoughts.
She was humored, if nothing else.
“What?” Harry’s brow furrows, and Malfoy’s gazing at him like he knows something.
“You are one of my only servants that has access to the school of Hogwarts Witchcraft and Wizardry. As you know, some of my greatest enemies dwell in its corridors.” He paused, waiting for comment.
“Remus Lupin, is that an invitation to run away together?” His soft tone inevitably lightened the entire mood.
Now, the moment felt private even for them.
“Well, I’m sorry to inform you that the rumors have already started, darling. Apparently you and Potter had quite the row.”
But before he could react any further, he was already tossing his wand to the boy. “Potter! Here!” He called, and Harry caught it mid-air with a beaming grin.
“You’re right. Prongs will come too. And Wormtail, if he can face his fear of spiders.”
Pansy’s wave suggested that they join them, and as they headed in their direction Blaise and Ron arrived via floo.
Harry would leave. They all leave eventually. His father left. His mother refused to protect him from the man that abused him most.
“Mr. Malfoy’s discovery of a new and improved form of Wolfsbane has already been put into practice for many of those suffering from Lycanthropy. It has not only lessened their symptoms, but has allowed several of its victims to become functioning members of society. His craft has revolutionized the idea of Lycanthropy and will only continue to make improvements to not only the individuals directly affected but also to society as a whole. And with that being said, I gladly present to you this personal award on behalf of the Ministry of Magic. Thank you for all that you have done, Mr. Malfoy.” He shook his hand, and Draco smiled brightly before Shacklebolt handed him a golden plaque.
“We never did come up with a nickname for you.” The proclamation was contemplative as he continued to lace his fingers. Sirius closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall, reveling in his canine tendency to enjoy a good rub between the ears.
This is what drives him to sneak out, throwing the covers from his insomniatic body and frustratingly stalking from the common room. He doesn’t know where he’s going, just that he needs some fresh air.
Eventually, Potter took back to human form, still cackling as he morphed.
Is that what this was?
Behind them, a loud whispering brought them back to reality.
Harry took a moment to notice the obvious similarity between the Slytherins and the Marauders. They were different in most ways, but something about their closeness...their laughter...was eerily alike.
“You really would be better off with Ginny Weasley!” He called, the wind whipping his hair, and it was a miracle that he didn’t choke on the words as they escaped his mouth.
The serpent’s attention is diverted to the trio as they halt and sharply turn backward. Weasley’s grumbling is barely audible above the high-pitched whine of the fire, and Draco begins to cough as smoke chokes the air.
“Do you have any questions?”
As if by a miracle, Draco glanced upward at the very last second. Green eyes met gray, and the very substance of this moment, no matter how coincidental, was enough to steal Harry’s breath away.
Maybe he was just confused.
“You don’t have a choice, Harry Potter.” His malicious grin turned into a loud laugh that barked in waves that seemed to shake the entire world around them.
Sirius didn’t say a word, but flashed them a friendly gesture with his hand.
He laughs at the sentiment, rolling his eyes facetiously.
Even if his life depended on it, he was tired of running. Of allowing his helplessness to ruin him.
“Okay, Potter. Let’s be fair. When you stop being such an egotistical, selfish prat, I’ll go to Hogsmeade with you.” She glanced down at her page, ending the conversation with her lack of attention.
“You like that, don’t you?” He smiles, playfully amused as he trails a path down Draco’s chest. The caress is heaven, and in his semiconscious state Draco feels whole. Green eyes flicker down to his lips, pale but smooth despite his current state. Harry knows this is it, and it’s all or nothing. There is no longer right and wrong; light or darkness. It’s only Draco, and himself, and everything that he’d thought he’d known to be true snowing gently in broken bits all around them.
“You’re the darkness in me. You are the representation of my downfall. You were Draco’s father in his subconscious, but for me... you’re Voldemort.”
His grin quickly faded and was replaced with a pout and puppy dog eyes.
Their eyes were fixed as Draco’s face came closer, closer, until it hovered mere inches from Harry’s. He then proceeded to lift a hand, brushing his fingertips against his temple, trailing them inferiorly, tracing a line along his cheekbones and jaw.
He’s staring up and down, patting himself in disbelief. Eyes wide with confusion. It’s hard for Harry not to smile. It worked. If anyone deserved a second chance, it was Draco Malfoy.
“So are you.”
Beside him was Padfoot, appearing not far different from his mate. He was a bit smaller, but just as vicious, and slobber dripped in webs from his curled, growling lips. Regardless of size, he placed his paws forward in a symbol of dominance to the intruders across from them. A symbol of his willingness to protect the wolf next to him.
In the next few seconds, he’d conjured a Patronus that flitted gracefully from the room to deliver a message.
Pansy Parkinson’s figure seemed to pulsate, focus fluctuating in and out in a pattern that almost made Harry sick as the world began to come into view.
His hands are drifting into the atmosphere, like grains of sand dissipating toward the floor. His expression morphs into utter fear, and, for once, Draco feels powerful.
“I... me? But I’m a person... I’m...”
“You’ve put in a long day’s work,” he stated almost proudly. “I know that visiting memories is no easy feat, and I admire your willingness to get along for this task. With that being said, it is after curfew so I recommend you both go get some sleep. Tomorrow we will continue.”
It must’ve been obvious, completely and utterly blatant that he’d been so engrossed in the couple before them that it quite literally took his breath away. Because Malfoy, instead of performing the Heimlich Maneuver or spelling him some air, stood their laughing.
“It’s a memory, Harry. You won’t be able to stop him.” The whisper was caring and concerned and the silky flow of his words lead Harry to stop in his tracks.
“The Room of Requirement.” Draco finished as they took steps by the few.
“Is Moony still in the library?” James asked nonchalantly, twisting and tossing the snitch between hands.
“About what? How pure your blood is? Or how pure your stupidity is?”
“Evans, Evans, Evans, that’s all you’re ever on about.” Sirius mocked Potter with a kissy face and turned to a chuckling Remus.
The Dragon was silenced. And it was no more.
“You know, I don’t have the scar anymore.” He’d flashed a facetious grin, lifting up tendrils of hair from his forehead.
“You’re just mad because my tail is bigger.” Sirius wiggled his eyebrows playfully, but Remus felt his blush come in with another round of heat.
He began to walk away, until the man called after him.
Peter Pettigrew had fled the scene before conflict could take place.
“We only broke about 50 laws to get here. We’ll be lucky if the prefect himself doesn’t give us detention.” James winked, and Peter looked up concernedly.
Adrenaline was sparking through every nerve in Draco Malfoy’s rigid body. The world was cast in an odd shade of yellow, like he was in shock or something. Time seemed to slow indefinitely. Beside him, Harry was motionless. This ached more than he could’ve ever known, but it was a dull throb that hadn’t really set in yet.
“Draco.” The word was a statement, and Malfoy’s eyes widened significantly. He was going to say it- to say that his name was Harry Potter and the real reason he’d been so bothered yesterday was because he really was gay and now he sorta fancies you- Okay, really fancies this detention version of you- and how he wants to taste your lips and tell you that he loves...
When the eighth year common room lit up that Friday night with the anticipatory mood of another soiree, Harry wasn’t surprised to see the silver trio enter suavely. Seamus was already drunk, and with Dean in tow he marched right up to Malfoy and gave him quite the uncomfortable hug.
What the fuck was happening? Where was Remus? His father? Sirius?
But the clomping of their followers was growing louder, and louder, and as they drew near their reprieve Harry couldn’t help but steal a backward glance in their direction.
Suddenly feeling a strong absence without his touch, Harry instinctively reached for his hand and took hold. Slightly startled, Draco looked down before peering sideways with that crooked smile in place.
“I know you’ve been avoiding me. I’ve missed you.”
Potter’s already there, rummaging through stacks of decade old-belongings that only the Room of Hidden Things would hold. He’s clearly searching for something.
Draco was invested more than Harry had ever seen him before. It was like potions class, or the middle of a quidditch match, when his eyes were peeled for the snitch. He was so focused, so concentrated, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder what was going on in his head.
The cheers began to fade into the background as the stands morphed into another place entirely.
Applause rang energetically amongst the crowd; hoops and hollers were sounded from their own table. Draco humbly excused himself, making his way to the stage.
“You’re not pissed that I was about to go through your things?”
“Well, whatever it is, I’m sure I’ll love it. As long as you guys didn’t go too crazy for me.”
“To clean up! Wait- are you telling me you never casted the silencing charms?”
And then he wasn’t. He was speaking words that were incoherent, something about stopping... and don’t hurt him?
The part of this memory that he’d yet to see, however, was what happened after Draco departed the train. Harry left himself on the floor as he rushed past his petrified body toward the blonde.
Malfoy still winces a bit at the name. His eyes are focused on the cauldron.
He seized it ruthlessly.
Every tear Draco had shed on his behalf seemed to fall in vain as the man refused to linger his gaze upon his son for long.
When Harry does come to life, startling everyone and sparking the light of hope and retribution, it’s Draco Malfoy who throws Harry his wand. They share a knowing glance, a brief stare that holds an eternity of secrets and new beginnings. Like anything could happen. Like they could win.
Harry’s heart began to pound erratically, anticipation flooding his being as he realized that there was no doubt of Draco Malfoy reciprocating these feelings. He felt a sudden urge to leap forward, to scoop him in his arms as the memory began to fade around them.
It reached his trunk, and arms, and legs, and finally his head. He took Draco’s hand and rose from the ground cautiously. What the fuck was happening?
And it hurts. And it’s funny Harry says that now, when they’re over, especially when he never had the guts to say it before. The closer he got was ‘I
Draco would dream Harry went to Pansy's wedding—to Longbottom, of all people—on his own.
, before it hurts, before it breaks his façade of nonchalance, his true feelings pouring forwards.
, Draco thinks, looking up at him, admiring the green in Potter’s eyes.
, Pans. None of them worked fine.”
seems to be holding a grudge against me. I mean look at this,” he says, pointing towards the paper’s cover.
“All can be forgiven,” Pansy says.
Draco shivers, recalls the curse cast on that name. Recalls
He figures he might as well continue to do so.
(A child Naomi seems to have a rather large sweet spot for. She keeps offering to stroll him around the park at noon, when she takes her midday break.)
"Oh, that's a good one!" he says, so Draco never mentions it again. Instead, he tells them he's got some sort of hormonal problem, and entertains himself by coming up with names for it.
"Have you been to Sant'Agostino?" his mother asks him one evening, while they're dining.
"But all your friends hate me," Draco spluttered. "Merlin, they'll probably try to murder me while I'm there!"
"Have you thought about how long you'll be staying?" Narcissa asks.
"I do take my work seriously," Draco says. His voice comes out strained, but at least he's managed to keep the 'you irksome little prat' he'd been planning to add near the end a silent one. He figures he ought to congratulate himself for that.
In Draco's dreams, they'd be paired together for their very first assignment.
Draco stands—quite proudly, he has to say—in the middle of the Ministry’s ballroom.
“It’s quite a bit like Muggle’s programming,” she said.
beside Draco, holding him close while pressing a line of kisses down his temple, and Draco . . . Draco is so exhausted. He's far too exhausted to even brush Potter away.
He doesn't look up. He carefully examines his fingernails as his mother's face flickers silently in the fireplace. He doesn't want to see the disappointment in her eyes. He feels as though he's sat through enough pitying looks from Pansy to last him a lifetime—and he's just fine, he's not broken, he doesn't even want to get married, for fuck's sake.
"Just—" Draco takes a deep breath, "—just leave me the fuck alone."
. “I’m really, really sorry. I didn’t mean to,” but he did. “You just assumed,” and Draco fed it gladly. “I’m sorry,” and he truly is. “Harry, please wait.”
“Are you deaf or are you dense? On your hands and knees. I imagine you know how it’s done, don’t you?”
Weasel turns to him with a grim expression, his fists tight by his sides.
"I don't have a girlfriend." Harry bites his lip, looking down into his mug. "Ginny is just… a good friend. That's all."
In the end, Draco asks for nothing. Doesn’t even contemplate it. He has to admit that inside him, his mind is still chuckling at the mess his life is. It would be so easy to give in, yet he’s too scared to lose Potter once again, given how last time nearly destroyed him. Given that he’s still alive now mostly thanks to Scorpius, the tiny human growing in his belly all those months ago. On the outside, he just picks up Scorpius and leaves.
* * *
“—all heated up and willing to grab your ankles in a moment—”
It’s pointless, isn’t it? Mostly because there’s no future.
Draco is doing up the buttons on his shirt. He’s kind of marveling he fucked Potter over the couch. Now,
Potter shrugged. "Sort of. It's some sort of potion, apparently—Neville's potion. They just don't know what it was, not exactly."
He gets up quite early the following morning, even though he forgot to set his wand to ring at six.
that’s not Potter’s choice. Potter has principles and all that. All he wants is Draco’s opinion and he’ll take it over anything else. “Do you want to have it?”
"When?"

That’s pretty much how the whole date goes, with Miller calling him unpleasant things, and treating him like he’s rubbish taken out of someone else’s can, and it keeps going like that until Miller tries to tie him to the bed. “I’m sorry,” Draco says. “I don’t do that.”
Draco dreamt Harry would be there when he woke up.
"I still don't think it's a—" Draco started, but Harry was faster, "Please?" he begged, gazing up at Draco with wide eyes. "Please, I haven't been able to go to Hogsmeade with them for months now, it'd be nice to—"
“Of course I don’t,” he sneers. “Sixth year was ages ago!” And a rather long time to be able to remember anything at all. She’s going to have to be a bit more specific.
“Oh man, seriously? To hell with her. I told her I’d tell you.”
“Why would I even—?”
It's not as if Draco needs the money after all—despite all the fines and sanctions and reparations he's had to pay since the war, the Malfoy coffers are still comfortably full. The shop is just something for him to do, and right now, he doesn't feel like doing it. So he turns over and goes back to sleep.
They’re all memories of things he should never recall, for his own good.
Draco swallowed against the taste of bile in his mouth. He felt empty, as if his insides had been carved right out and he couldn't
Fenrir’s eyes shone with evil darkness. “Can I…”
Whatever, Draco thinks, mostly because at least he’s not the one trying to pull one on someone here. Love-hate, he thinks. Lean towards love, Zen is the way to go, he thinks. Do not kill her, she’s still your friend. Be Nice to Your Friends is his new motto. It’s a shame he doesn’t have one of those ‘webcams’, he’d likely be quite proud of his troll video right now. Still, he goes to the Albany the next day, mostly because it’s either that or spreading his legs for Patterson, whose breath smells like a farting Kneazle.
"I doubt it. Last time I checked I wasn't the right gender to pass off as anyone's girlfriend."
Potter shrugged, sitting on the other end of the bed—just across from Draco. He was eating treacle tart again; Draco thought it was quite a marvel his teeth hadn't fallen off so far, what with the amount of golden syrup he must have ingested on a daily basis.
He turns around, knowing, just knowing, because that voice is still etched into his memory as if he’d heard it yesterday, even though it’s been six flipping months since the last time he did. If he’s quite honest here, he’s not looking forwards to hearing it ever again. He’s quite aware why he kept Flooing: just another way to show he could, holding his power over Draco’s head.
Still, he tells Harry afterwards, as soon as he gets back. "Yes," he says, "I'll go back with you."
“I know you’re not, you pillock,” says Harry, massive eye-roll included, all while Draco dodges the popcorn thrown at him. “I wouldn’t be dating you if you were anything like you were back at school.”
These days, Draco is not exactly looking to get laid—too little time, too much to do. Then again, it’s been a long time since ‘getting laid’ held any kind of promise for him. He’s already bonded to someone who quite mattered to him. None of them, sadly, will ever be able to replace the exact amount of love Draco had for Harry. Even the stars are too close to reach it.
Besides, undoing that might land him back at Pansy’s, and surely without Harry by his side.
"I know you will." Harry grinned back at him. "I'm counting on it."
On the short walk from the Ministry to the nearest Starbucks, Hermione kept talking about this new thing they had her doing all the way down there, in the Department of Mysteries.
Draco can’t stop thinking about Granger’s visit on the way home. All through the night, it repeats endlessly in his head. He’s wearily conscious of every single second in it. It happens once and again, over and over despite his constant attempts to sleep. She removed her curse. She apologised miserably. “He asked me to erase your feelings for him.” A well-cast
“You can stay at Grimmauld for a while,” Potter offers. “Just until you’re back on your feet.” He looks a bit nervous, from the awkward tilt of his hips, to the anxious way he’s holding Draco’s chart. “I don’t know if you can cook, there’s a kitchen there… or, I guess, you can ask Kreacher to make you something edible,” he says, face screwed up. “Though I have to admit he’s not exactly good at it, most of what
"No, listen to me," she demands. "He does travel a lot, and there are, what, hundreds of different magical illnesses? Thousands?"
Pansy handles the logistics of their enterprise, managing their bookings and calls while Draco… well, Draco mostly brews tea, occasionally makes Pans coffee in the morning, and plays
Draco blinked, looking down at where Harry's fingers were pulling at his jumper. They were stretching the sleeve over his hand, and just a few months ago Draco would have punched him for that. He was momentarily puzzled by how comfortable they'd become around each other, and that was probably the reason why all Draco managed to say was, "You must be mental."
"Yeah, yeah." Draco shakily rose to his feet. It was quite hard to maintain his dignity when he was still clutching his head like it was about to explode, but in all honesty, he thought he'd been doing a fairly good job. He was certainly doing a better job than Potter, who was just standing there with his arms crossed, looking for all the world like his soul had been sucked out. "Do feel free to bore me with your laments some other time, Potter. I'm out of here."
When Harry comes back, he's looking everywhere but at Draco.
He could fall asleep in a heartbeat, and it occurs to him that perhaps Pansy is right after all. Perhaps he really is sick. He's so drained it doesn't even feel
The next time he wakes up it’s because his hair is tickling his nose, and there’s a constant noise in the background that sounds quite a bit like the scribbling of a quill on parchment, so he rolls on his back, stretches, and sits up. The floor feels cold beneath his naked feet.
Draco swallows. His throat feels dry, and the tingle of excitement is making his face burn. "Let's hear it, then."
Pansy looks up at him. She chews thoughtfully. "I'm not telling you," she says, and then sticks her tongue out at him before taking another bite of her peach. "If you want to know, you'll just have to owl him and ask."
“No.” She shrugs. “What I’m trying to say here is, you’ll never know if you don’t try.”
out of his hands.
Draco doesn't, not that week. Though he does ask eventually and receives a variety of answers, some of them easier to believe than others. He guesses they were built to show off, that every well off family in town built their own tower, that they work as a symbol of power of sorts—or at least worked as one, in the past.
, he’s not sure how he feels about that. A pregnant Malfoy, indeed: laugh or shame or both at once.
(It’s definitely not Potter he spends all day thinking about. There are other people up there, definitely. It’s not like Potter is his wank fantasy, though he has to admit he’s actually a great fantasy. He’s definitely thinking of other people, too. It’s just a shame they all happen to look quite a bit like Potter. Or,

in Potter's arms.
“Oh, I did notice. But that’s his problem, not yours.” She leans back comfortably on her chair. He pictures her carefully examining her nails again. Alas, it doesn’t happen, she just says, “Most of your clients are married anyway.”
"Merlin, will you just . . . fuck me already . . ."
Draco glances up, but otherwise doesn't reply. Yes, he knows what she means, but whatever. It's not as if he's here for her entertainment.
“I’ll be back tomorrow,” says Potter, looking a bit puzzled, a little lost.

"Who knew Slytherins could be such hopeless romantics?"
One night, Granger and Weasel drop by for dinner. Draco spends half the evening trying to talk to her, mostly because she seems easier to deal with than Weasel. Besides Potter wouldn’t be, say, extremely pleased, if he decided to leave the room. Or punch Weasel’s nose, like that evening.
"None of this would have happened if you hadn't pushed me into Longbottom's cauldron!"
“You’re always going to feel like a part of you is—”
And then Draco’s jaw snaps shut as a fist crushes the side of his face. He falls to the floor, cradling his chin. Stunned, wounded. Drained.
"Seriou—"
“I mean we are too different. I mean it’s just not working. I don’t really know why. I tried, you know? It’s just

must have been messing with his mind at some point, and he can’t say who. It’s a blank spot, but a blank spot that
Draco smiled into his pillow, a flicker of hope burning bright in his chest. For the first time since this whole thing had started, Draco couldn't honestly say he minded being bonded to Harry. They were better together than they ever were apart.
A stroke of luck, Draco thinks, that thing he lacks. He can hardly believe it. So he ponders and ponders, breathes in and breathes out, and concludes… well, nothing particularly relevant, except that he probably should follow Potter. It’s pretty much the dumbest conclusion he’s ever reached in his whole life, but it kind of, sort of makes sense? It’s not like it’s going to get any better than this, and at least he knows Potter is alone in there—which is really not
"Malfoy," Potter calls from the door, "would you mind taking look at this—"
A small piece of his heart dies in his chest every time, and Draco knows, deep down, that he should have tried harder to talk to Harry. Only he never knew what to say or how to act around him, because Harry has always been far too important to risk.
"No," Draco said.
So, point here? None at all. Mister Potter, all hail him, knows no fear and knows no danger, and apparently knows nothing at all. It’s not like adding tiny lies to that massive one is going to somehow unbalance their universe.
“Hm, perhaps.”
And Draco does. He waits one hour, two. Potter is gone. He’s not even sure he’ll come back. He doesn’t know if he’s…
At least until Potter grabs his cock, and doesn’t let him get there. They fuck, afterwards, and then they go upstairs and do it again.
He casts a last glance at the mirror and thinks,
me, thank you very much!”
? He’s useless and he knows it, he knows it now better than anytime before. He swears that to himself over a hundred times: promises and promises and promises, until the liquor puts him to sleep.
Draco thought about all the things he wanted from Harry—his cloak, his map, his friendship . . . a kiss. Not that he'd ever ask for one, but hell, yes, he wanted one.
"Er, Draco? Where are you?"
Later that evening, Draco lays back against the door to his room. The flashbacks, it’s been weeks since he’s had them.
Harry stays put for a while, glancing up at the bottle. Likely seeing nothing, Draco thinks. He’s just opened his heart here, he hopes Harry can see that much. He hopes he’s seeing the
too. Dismally enough, the paper comes time after time with his whimpers, and their accusative matching head shake. Potter’s whines seem to oscillate between “I honestly can’t believe I’m doing this,” and “Seriously…” Draco finds the first one side-splitting, especially since Potter seems to be purposely evading the ‘for you’ that often ends that sentence. Once, Potter even goes as far as to venture an, “I don’t even get what grabs your interest, when all they publish is crap.”
, considering everyone else has left. And he’s gone over this: he’s been practising at home, he can do it. Sure, the toilet may not be the sexiest place when picking out a place to flirt, but it is at least a place, isn’t it?
Draco nods. "I can be there at seven," he says, before bidding Potter goodbye and ending the call. He can hear Pansy tapping her foot by the door.
by a raid of rogue Death Eaters.
"Merlin, just—just shut up. It's not like it's my first time, for fuck's—" Draco starts, but Potter leans forward and kisses him, swallowing the rest of his words—and it's sweet, it's oddly sweet, not at all like Potter's kisses back at work. It's soft and tender and quite possibly driving Draco insane, and it's only made much better by the feeling of Potter's hard length finally—
“Why? I don’t know why,” Potter says, amused. “Because I want you to?”
Is there a single reporter left with an imagination, or has all of journalism devolved into one giant Rita Skeeter exposé?
, not against the Dark Lord. He doesn’t even want to imagine a world where the Dark Lord wins the war. The Dark Lord
"God, I hate you," Harry breathes out, slumping down against the wall as if it were the only thing holding him up. As if the whole world were crumbling around them. "I really fucking hate you."
He knows Robards is talking to him. He knows he's been speaking for a while. He knows he's missed most of the actual explanation because his mind was still trying to come to terms with Robards' first two demented sentences:

fight”—Draco leaves the glasses on the nearest shelf—“or just an argument?”
It's still the closest to love he's ever been.
And so while Pansy makes him a cup of tea, Draco sits up and puts on the blue cashmere V-neck Mother sent him last Yule, and a pair of dark trousers that now feel several sizes too tight at the waist—it's been happening so often lately that he's actually become pretty adept at ignoring it. The kitchen's floor is cold under his naked feet and yet his eyelids still feel heavy, so heavy, almost as though they're weighed down by boulders.
"Well," Potter's voice comes over Draco's shoulder, "good to know you're still alive. To be honest, I was beginning to doubt it."
Fuck fuck fuck,
He takes Harry's cock into his mouth and bobs his head a few times, experimentally, gazing up at Harry the whole time. There's something stormy and unreadable in Harry's eyes, and Draco can't seem to look away from them. His own cock is impossibly hard, pushing against the fabric of his trousers, and he wonders momentarily if he could come just from this. If he could come in his pants like a teenager having his first time just from watching Harry getting closer. From knowing he's the one doing this to Harry, from turning Harry into this mess of a person who can only speak in strings of swear words.
That it corrupts his soul, leaves it shy and scant, because emptiness will be the death of him when all this is gone, forever.
“Let’s meet up then, huh?” It was kind of hilarious how Malfoy’s mouth got stuck between a ‘What’ and a ‘Huh’. “Don’t worry,” Harry said, “you’ll get it later, likely when I come pick you up,” and winked at him on the way out.
Choices are such tricky business though. Every day brings new ones, and even now, Draco keeps making all the wrong ones.
“Does your wife make you happy? Are you still… glad she chose you, and not someone else?”
"Oh, come on, Harry, it can't actually be—"
“I…” Merlin, if he gets it wrong once more, he’ll want to bang his head against the wall, painfully. Yet no one here will be particularly entertained by another display of lack of graciousness. Not him. Certainly not Potter. And besides, the wall is far too close. How did he end up there, anyway? Slouching against the loo’s wall, bathed in sweat…
Draco writes half a dozen letters to his mother, then
It seems like Potter has some issues when it comes to broadcasting Draco’s gayness to the whole floor, and it’s funny, because Potter also appears to think he’s got nothing left to go back to but that bloke. Potter actually thinks
Potter turns around. A forceful kiss, just what Draco kept wanting for the past two months. Somehow it feels oddly familiar, like they’ve done this before, though Draco can’t recall when exactly since they’ve always been enemies. Even if Draco sometimes thinks he’d have liked things to go differently between them, if only Potter had said ‘Hello’ that day, back on first year…
“Malfoy?” he said. His waiter stood still, then looked up, tense around the edges. “Potter.”
“And besides—” Draco shrugs again “—it’s not like there’s that much talking going on.”
that. He fucking hates that.
*   *   *
Their kiss turn sloppy, fiery and stormy. Potter slides a hand up Draco’s t-shirt, meeting flesh with his palm, gliding his nails across Draco’s rib cage in a way that feels somewhere between marvellous and heart-stopping.
Orgasm is one breath away.
"Yes," Draco hisses,
As he leaves, he’s not thinking it bloody hurts that Potter is willing to settle for Scorpius over him. He doesn’t feel battered and bruised from being Potter’s second best. Not at all.
But then Potter pulls back, forcefully pushing Draco into the wall. His eyes are dark, an odd mix of anger and want turning them a cloudy shade of green, and Draco feels himself grow even harder as Potter wipes a hand across his face.
“What the fuck—” and both the eff and the kay of his ‘fuck’ seem to come out rather strong sounding, “—was
and he plasters a smile on his face. “How do you want us to start?”
. It’s as good a time as any to test her theories; she’s always been best out of them two, regarding what people want. In several strenuous efforts, Draco grits his teeth, swallows his jibes, and offers Weasel a cup of tea. Or a sandwich. Or anything else edible that’s at least somewhat close to him, day after day after day. By now he thinks he rather knows Weasel, and what he’s learnt is he likes food.
“Trollop.”
“What, here?”
Time seems to slow down—
that and is actually glad it’s happened. Draco is rather glad too. Exhausted but glad, because love still lives in him and this moment here is the closest to perfect any time in his life has ever been—“are having a baby.”
Draco stares at him, indecision clouding through his thoughts.
A thought keeps creeping into his mind: it’s not his fault he’s here today. Draco chuckles lowly, like the maddest of the mad—it makes his back hurt a bit when he moves, he’s not sure why. Frankly, he’s not sure it’s anyone’s fault that he’s here, except perhaps Miller’s, and Miller is not here, the bastard.
“I thought you might want me to…” Draco wonders if—
It might restore their credibility.
Harry just stares down at him, breathing hard, his eyes half-lidded and dark. So dark Draco would never guess their colour if it weren't already burnt into his mind—green like Slytherin, green like the glowing sparks of
Hermione is mumbling something under her breath, something that makes Draco pause and ask, “What did you just say?”
Partly glad, partly humiliated too. He doesn’t want to tell Potter that though, so he goes with, “Alive.” And a bit awkward, a bit confused. “Nothing hurts if I stay put,” he says, in doubt, figuring that might be the spell the woman cast on him downstairs. Then, he recalls reading Potter worked at Spell Damage and adds, “I guess you’re not too bad at this whole healing thing you do for a living.”
"It's a nice film," Harry said, "well, Hermione said so anyway. She and Ron went to watch it last week, during the . . . well, when they were supposed to be in Hogsmeade."
working) he’s not too sure he’d be able to defend himself. For a moment there, Draco thinks things might be turning towards good. Perhaps. It seems likely. “I guess this whole thing has given me the push to sign the arrangement.”
"It's . . ."
"Will you at least tell me who the father is?"
“Well, I wasn’t exactly cheap…” And there he goes again, making this all better. Go on, Draco. Why can’t he stay quiet when it matters? “… as he put it,” the last bit comes in a mumble, barely even audible to himself.
“Crawl over here,” he repeats, a cold smirk on his face, “like the whore you are.”
Draco smiles, shaking his head slowly. He's had enough to keep him awake all weekend.
“I think I may love you.” Harry pushes the hair out of Draco’s eyes.
“Remember what, Pans?” Draco tries, his world is crumbling around him, falling down in a turmoil he doesn’t know how to stop.
over the Weasel. They'd still end up in different houses, and Draco's heart would clench miserably during the Sorting ceremony with the looming threat of estrangement, but it wouldn't last. Harry would still sit next to him in Potions every week, and his thigh would press warm against Draco's as he leant in closer to copy his notes.
(Only perhaps he does, a tiny bit.)
If he had, he might have gone about it a bit differently. There might have been apologies and late night dinners at expensive restaurants, getting to know each other—birthday presents, valentines, mistletoe kisses. There might have been, most importantly, a brief period called dating before the actual falling into bed together. Because Draco is most definitely not a cock slut. Even if he's feeling a lot like one at the moment because there hasn't been any of that.
Her eyes are fixed on Draco's face as if she were trying to read his thoughts—and if Draco didn't know she's always been pants at Legilimency, he might have been a tiny bit scared. As it is though, he's merely tired—tired of keeping secrets, tired of lying to his friends—to his
He’s obviously not going to tell Potter that he does have someone after all.
“I think you’re liking this quite a bit,” Draco says.
“I wasn’t expecting you,” he begins to say, but something about Potter’s posture looks… wrong. He’s too tense, too strained. “What happened?”
And it's Harry. The boy who keeps refusing to die. Of course they're sending him back.
"You bloody bastard," Draco snaps at him. "That was—
"And now you don't?"
Potter smiles a small smile at him, and for a moment there, Draco feels so aroused, so desperately aroused it's almost surreal, and all he wants to do is bend closer for a second kiss—and likely a third and a fourth and a fifth.
“Suit yourself.” She taps the ash off her cigarette into the small ashtray standing between them. Shoots him a grim grin while explaining, “It’s just, it’s never going to get better, you know? You’re still bonded to him…”
“I confessed to you that night, knowing that there was nearly a hundred percent chance of you rejecting me. I guess, deep inside me, there was a tiny part who wanted to believe you wouldn’t.” She pauses, snorting. Draco doesn’t find it in him to laugh. Nothing out of what she’s telling him feels like it should be a laughing matter. “You did, though,” she goes on. “You even gave me a reason why. A good reason, too, I thought. I honestly felt I couldn’t compete with
It didn’t seem incredibly relevant at the time though, so he moved on. “Hi, Fred,” he said to the ghost that (everyone else said) wasn’t but was often there. Or had been for quite a while. “Have a good night?”
“Really,” Pansy deadpans, all the while holding his gaze. “He spoke in your favour during your trial.”

called him a liar. Instead, he summons a glass of water from the kitchen. He fetches a blanket from the bedroom to wrap around Draco's shoulders, he
“Quite often,” Potter says. His breath comes in shallow gasps. He looks thoroughly unhinged, his hands still resting on Draco’s hips, his thumbs unconsciously rubbing small circles into his sides.
Harry’s arm curls around Draco’s waist. “No, it’s not fine. It’s not fine at all. I care about you. You know that, don’t you?”
,” Draco says, ignoring shame poking its head in the back of his brain, “and you

(The Dark Lord was right. He
"Good. She can't be your girlfriend. You can't…"
Potter. Frankly, something good had to come out of all those years at school, sneaking glances at him across the hallway. Out of rivalry, of course—it’s not like he’d been drawn in by Potter’s charm, since Potter’s charm was never quite, never there. But anyway, the point here is he knows Potter, and he knows how he works. He’s remarkably easy to manipulate: present yourself as a victim, and he’ll set all else aside to help you, because he desperately loves being a hero.
There's a blast of white light headed straight for Harry, and Draco knows that shade—he knows it well; he remembers it from sixth year. There's no time to counter it, and Harry's looking the other way. Harry hasn't even noticed the curse flying towards him.
And from then on, from time to time, Potter brings him a new bottle.
“Wait…” For a moment Potter tenses up, like he’s about to move away. Then, he settles, concentration showing on his face. “It’s not you, I just… I don’t think we should do this, not when she doesn’t know.”

“I’m sorry, I’m truly sorry,” Potter tells him, when he finally goes back to bed.
place—slowly spinning a lowball glass between his forefinger and thumb. He'd thought Potter looked great before, but now he's stunning—the way his tousled hair draws attention to his face, how even the light frown line between his eyebrows makes Draco want nothing more than to smooth it over . . .
Draco chokes back a sob.
And in his dreams, Draco wouldn't.
Draco gasps. Potter’s hips roll forward, seeking friction.
It's probably just his luck that he's in the process of getting fairly intimately acquainted with his loo the next time Potter shows up.
Potter shrugs. "The Blacks used to live here," he admits. "I guess this might have gone to you, if Sirius hadn't left a will."
“I don’t see why not.” Pansy frowned, looking quite stern. “It opens the portal to the Muggle world, doesn’t it?”
Draco contemplates the greenish potion on his sink. It’s been standing there since yesterday. Why indeed wait longer? He grabs the bottle, all while his mirror self cringes and shows him an extremely emphatic thumb down. Draco, of course, pokes his tongue out at it.
"Sure," Harry said quickly, "whatever you want, it's yours."
"Shut up, Harry."
"—I was stupid—"
Or, most commonly, when Pansy walked into the shop in the middle of the afternoon carrying a battered copy of the
he finds out?
can’t he remember it?
*   *   *
"Can't, sorry. We're going to Blaise's birthday and it's invitation only," Draco replies. He can tell Pansy is still gaping at him from the kitchen, likely because he's on the Floo with his school-time enemy—who was sort of his boyfriend for a day back in eighth year, who's now back to being his enemy—and they're actually just . . . chatting. Like old friends would. "Tomorrow, maybe?"
“The ghost,” Hermione asked, “again?”
Draco clenches his hands into fists so hard his nails dig into his palms. "Mother, there will be no wedding."
“I see,” Draco says, his voice somewhere between disbelief and disappointment. Her Reducto used to be quite powerful. “So, an argument.”
Draco can’t help laughing, rather incredulous. “You’re on a power-trip here, Potter, because you
“I had a short break between two dates, so I went into the Albany. I was about to order a cocktail, but when I looked up though, there he was! Potter, having lunch…”
Pansy did ask him how it had gone after the first time, but Draco had simply shrugged, unwilling to give too much away. He guesses she must have thought it went wrong. Draco, on the other hand, thinks it went all too well.
"I know she'd look after you, you great twat, and it's not as though she'd force you into a marriage you don't want. You can always say no," Pansy says, throwing her hands up. "Your life, your choices."
Draco nods, answering with a final, “Good.”
“He doesn’t know?” Blaise asks, looking quite fixedly at Potter. Then, he turns to Draco, mischief glinting in his eyes. “You haven’t even told him, have you?”
"I'm sorry," Potter says at last. "I didn't mean that, what I said to you earlier—I do know you take your work seriously. I was just . . ." He trails off, gesturing vaguely.
"If only the Dark Lord had known all he needed to do to take you out of commission was to give you endless supplies of treacle tart . . ." Draco trailed off then, he pressed his lips together into a tight line—it was just a stupid comment, words he didn't think through, but he'd heard them now and he could see how they could be taken the wrong way. And that was what they all thought about him, wasn't it? That Draco wanted the Dark Lord to win—only they knew nothing.
“Useless. Even more useless than your father,” the Dark Lord said. “Perhaps I’ll let Fenrir have a little fun with you. Wouldn’t you like that, Fenrir?”
The next time he wakes up it's to Pansy shaking his shoulder like the world is ending outside, calling his name in a sort of panicked voice that has Draco reaching for his wand before he can even process the thought, before his eyes are all the way open—a leftover memory from the war, he guesses.
He guesses he should have, what with all the worrying he's been doing about this the past few weeks—at night, when Potter tiptoed around the flat; some mornings, when Draco caught him rummaging through the drawers in his potion cabinet, looking for a Hangover Remedy or a Headache Banishing Potion. And Draco took extra care to keep the cabinet well-stocked. He even went as far as to cast a Disillusionment Charm on every single one of the vials he got from the mediwizards at St Mungo's—even the ones that were just vitamins.
"No," Draco says softly.
there is doing something. Quite a shame he’s still not sure if this something is good or not. “A third chance, actually,” he answers. “You’ve had two already, and you blew them both.”
He didn’t know why. It just made sense: a cuppa, a fry-up, and the
, which might be true, but really… Potter?
My, my. Malfoy did get quite red on the face.
"That's all right, it doesn't have to be right now," Potter says quickly. "Just . . . give me your address and I'll Floo you?"
As if. But Potter nods, and that prompts Draco to keep going.
“Yep.”
He tries as an escort, the first time.
It doesn't work that way.
, he seems to be saying.
“Are you—” said Malfoy, and then, lowering his voice til it was barely above a whisper, “—on something?”
"So, what is going on?" she repeats.
“Programm—?” Ron glanced at Harry, both eyebrows raised in his best
They'd have to follow the ringleader of a potions' smuggling operation all through London. Tailing people would turn out to be incredibly boring work: lots of sitting around in the dark, with nothing to do but watch and wait; lots and lots of free time that Draco would gleefully fill by, among other things, ogling Harry's delectable arse.
Draco can’t stop himself on time, blowing air loudly through his mouth.
Draco's mouth tightens. "Perhaps, but not right now."
,” Potter tells him. “I do miss you.”
"And yet you let yourself in." Draco steps closer—closer still until he's standing between Potter's legs, feeling Potter's warmth through the fabric of his jeans as it radiates across his skin. "Why is that?" he asks, watching goosebumps rise along Potter's arms.
“Moving here, with me?”
"I have a proposal for you," Potter says.
Except it’s not.
"Merlin, Harry," Pansy says, "take it easy, will you?"
Pansy however, has no intentions of relenting, pinning him with her trademark smirk. “Not a chance.”
Potter raises an eyebrow. Rather mockingly, he does mention, “You seemed to like it quite a bit.”
“Yeah, okay, sorry. Go on.”
“… as if it were the most common thing for a wizard, as reverently famous as he is, to have lunch at a Muggle place—”
to skim the sports section before leaving it open on Draco's counter. "Doesn't this bother you in the slightest?"
to know what Potter meant. "What were you going to say earlier?"
“Indeed,” he says. They both say their goodbyes, and she leaves. A while after she’s disappeared into the distance, Draco walks past the station and into the loos, where he Apparates to Potter’s doorstep.
“Fine.” Potter’s look is subtle enough. Draco does catch it, though. Up and down, but not derisive. “Much better than before.”
“He’s always been your weak spot, hasn’t he?” Pansy says, gently. He feels her arms enclosing him. They pull him down a little, closer to her, cradling him in her arms. Cradling him while all he can do is fight to hold on to sobs, to hold on to tears that threaten and to happiness, at war with terror. For a moment there he recalls the last time he felt like this, when
"It's a church though."
"Were you just staring at my feet?"
why he's here now, that he wants that feeling again and again because at least that's something Draco is willing to give. Something he wants to give.
“Potter, get your hand off me.”
As Potter lowers his glass to the floor, Draco fervently hopes it's not answers that Potter's come looking for. He hopes the other night felt as otherworldly to him as it did to Draco—that
Potter on the other hand looked almost delighted as they approached the house, which made Draco’s desire to punch him in the nose grow stronger. Flitch must have noticed Potters smile as well, he commented
“One hundred percent” Draco said,
“My brothers say it won’t be that good because Slytherin won the cup,” he said bleakly  “but the food will still be good, oh and you missed the final quidditch match, Slytherin kicked our arse without you, it was pretty depressing actually” added Ron.
“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,” his father replied coldly and Borgin resumed looking at his father’s list and discussing whatever it was they were saying about blood purity and muggles in the Mistry. Draco made his way mesmerized by the various shelves deeper into the shop. Stopping to take a better peak at a supposed cursed neckless when he heard a whisper coming from the cabinet behind him.
“So, Mr. potter, Draco has told me you are a fair quidditch player” his father said again.
He rushed to follow the queue of Gryffindor, but, he was planning to get out of it as soon as he could. Ducking down he took off in the opposite direction merging into a group of Hufflepuffs. Draco kept turning corridors quietly when he noticed Potter and Weasley seemed to have had the same idea as him.
“I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy, it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” Draco didn’t think he heard correctly, the forest, the actual forbidden forest, there was no way, no way they would make a couple of first years go into the forbidden forest with only Hagrid’s dumbass to protect them. Draco had never heard of students being send into the forest as punishment, he positively started to panic and it must have shown on his face. He attempted to compose himself he could not give Potter the satisfaction.
’!” he read the back of the card practically bouncing whit joy. Hermione jumped to her feet.
“Pleasure is mine Mr. potter, Lucius Malfoy” his father said returning Harry shaky hand shake
After lunch he went back out to the gardens and was sitting by the green houses when a disheveled looking elf Draco noted looked strangely agitated, told him he was needed at his father’s office. This was unusual as Draco was rarely ever allowed inside no matter how many times he had begged as a child to be let in.
They knocked on Hagrid’s door,
“You coming or not?” said Blaise, he looked back at his two friends standing in the door of the compartment looking at him and was pulled out of his trance. He took a deep breath and picked up his stuff.
“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ dormitories.The boys hardly had time to exchange looks before she was dashing back, a gigantic old book in her arms.
“is it – dead?” she spoke first.
“You’re insane! you can’t do that” Weasley intervened.
(From the text: Hermione "book's and cleverness like" (I though about adding the ONCE I MAKE MY MOVE line but I couldn't not laugh)
“I’d like to apologize son” his father began leaving Draco startled “I’ve been very busy and haven’t been able to see much of you this summer,”
Their foots steps echoed as they walked. They reached an old oak door, Draco heard the sound of light fluttering, almost wing like inside and they all drew their wands, as they pushed it open.
Hermione did take Ron's worlds to heart, and with determination she spent the following week trying to talk Hagrid into giving the dragon away. Draco could honestly care less what happened to Hagrid, he didn’t really like him much unlike the rest of his friends and the hole Dragon ordeal was really starting to bother him.
(Taken from the text: Filch's lines, as well as doumbledore's, hermione's hearing voices line is from the movies and so is Mcgonagall's speech about the legend of the chamber of secrets)
“I’ll stay with him you go on,” Hermione said with determination.
“So, you actually don’t hate Granger,” pansy finally broke the silence. Draco though for a moment.
“so rude,” the lady said and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, into a sofa.
“I don’t hate them that much,” Draco finally said as they reached the seventh floor.
But there was one key difference, to Draco it didn’t seem like a distant event, but a thing of the present. He wasn’t as naïve as Weasley who regarded the war a something long gone. He knew first hand since he was little that the muffled conversations he had been hearing and the scary things they promised where real and were happening now. If he had learned one thing for sure from his family was that ambition for victory knew no bounds, and you needed it to win, He had absolutely no doubt Dumbledore knew it too.
“Mr. Weasley, Miss granger and Mr. potter are all okay” she repeated herself.
“good night” harry said absentmindedly and keep staring out the window.
His father resolved to take him to diagonally the following weekend being he had some business to attend to, and Draco was ecstatic with joy about getting to follow his father along to do anything. By the time Sunday finally rolled around Draco had memorized all the books he needed, and looked over the catalog of
The day after was unpleasant, the other people in Gryffindor shot them angry looks all day, they had managed to lose their lead on house points. Draco spend most of the day taking his anger out on any idiot who would allow it. He jinxed together the legs of some first year Hufflepuff and made Neville’s potion explode on his face just because of his dreadful mood. He even made a Ravenclaw idiot who got in his way end up crying. Hermione was felling so dreadful and guilty she didn’t even call him out about this behavior as she often did. In fact, even pansy asked him if he was okay when she saw him dinner, and noted he hadn’t acted that way since the beginning of the year, Draco just told her to piss off and mind her own business. Draco could not care less about their opinions he was just determined to make others miserable. It got so bad that Potter even commented about it clearly putting on the ‘goody two shoes it’s not right to bother people’ attitude towards him that Draco so despised.
“Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothing’ of the sort,” Said Hagrid.
“very well, your mothers told me after the initial days your first term at Hogwarts was amicable,”
“it was all thanks to Malfoy” and this made his blood boil.
“yes sir,” he simply responded.
“Maybe, I don’t know as I said Dumbledore is a funny man, I don’t think we will ever really know what he intended unless he wants us to know” Harry said simply,
You gladly chose to fake a life where none of that existed
here but not this, do not tell him the—“might be”—truth, for Salazar’s sake. Just shut the hell up—“true.”
Belatedly, he answers, “Sorry, you saw whom?”
When they come back from their holidays, Harry is even colder to him, and Draco has no idea how to fix that. Their eyes meet occasionally, across the room, but Harry's gaze is guarded now and there's a small frown between his brows. Draco can't read him anymore.
It was him. It was
“Does this mean,” Potter asks, afterwards, “that I get a second chance, then?”
"Come on, please? Just this once."
. He feels like he can't think, like he can't even breathe properly when every shiver, every single moan that escapes Potter's mouth is driving him wilder and wilder.
Sometimes, Draco dances around the corridors, singing to himself Madonna’s
Pans never asks again.
The Dark Lord was right.
, the same green that shoots Draco’s heart dead. Except there’s a scar on his forehead, and it just happens to be lightning-shaped.
One year later, Draco is working at Morden Superstore, a small coffee shop in Muggle London, way after he’s finally managed to get his freaking passport.
Potter though… Potter could help with that, couldn’t he?
Fenrir looked at him, a vicious smile twisting his lips. “You heard that, little one? We’re gonna have a bit of fun here…”
, yet again.
. The Dark Lord laughs. Somewhere within his brain, Draco recalls the sound of grinding bones in Snape’s class—crash, crank, crash-crank-
for it, since it would bring up questions he can’t answer.
"Oh, dear, I never . . ." His mother pushes back her plate. "I wasn't running away from you, you must know that. I was exiled," she says. She sounds sad, but that's hardly surprising. "There's a difference."
It’s nothing but a suggestion. But somehow a suggestion that’s now stuck in his mind, and no matter how hard he shakes his head it’s not leaving. “I am not falling for your words of advice again. Honestly, keep your tip-offs to yourself.”
“Go then, he must be hoping you get there. Save him from that lass.” She smiles a smile tanged with sweetness, all while Draco tries his hardest to mutter the chuckle that comes with that image: Harry Potter, come buy now a new lady version of everyone’s favourite hero! “He’s a tiny little cherub, your son…”
Potter's muscles feel tense under Draco's hand, but they soften marginally as his mouth brushes Potter's, and a lot more when his lips part. Draco does his best to pour everything he's felt these past few months into this kiss—all his hate, all his anger, all the love Pansy claims he feels. He thinks, when he pulls away, that he must have done a fairly good job—Potter is just standing there, panting, looking for all the world like he's just been handed a puzzle he's not sure he can solve.
to do this," Draco tells her, and eventually she agrees it might be good for the family.
Honestly, with her hairstyle, a shoulder-length bob of bluish black, she’d look great in some of them. The horn-rimmed ones he saw this morning would make her look rather sexy, a bit like those Muggle teachers that came up when he searched Google for porn—he’s learned quite a bit since then, now he types ‘gay porn’, because it’s all great and fab when fannies are for others but, Merlin, they’re seriously not for him. He’s about to mention that, but then he remembers where exactly he saw them, and that Potter’s ugly face stood behind them. With a frown, he decides he’s much better quiet—Pans already thinks, silly of her, that he has a crush on Potter; far better not to give her more ammo, she’s done enough bad as it is.
All things considered, it might be for the best.
Draco moved closer then, he moved until their lips were barely inches from each other. "So do Slytherins," he whispered, "we just like to call them threats."
— and then it’s gone. Another moment; another moment gone. Passed. As in: past tense.
“Do you think there are ice rinks in Hades?” Draco asks.
"I can assure you, Potter, the feeling's entirely mutual."
"It's my fault," Potter says quietly, and Draco moves still closer to the door, pressing his face against it in an effort to hear better—he wishes he had an Extendable Ear, but sadly, this is the best he can do. "It's all my bloody fault."
Draco’s glance, in turn, drops venom. “So sorry for not being up to your magnificent standards,” he sneers. He’s really quite affronted. He doesn’t think he’s any of that, not anymore. In fact, he’s not even sure he’s ever been both at the same time, especially when those terms are basically opposites.
“No,” she interrupts. “No,
Draco used to read the

“Are you sure?”
He’s been introduced as Harry’s date. Few things, he thinks, can even compare to that. He’s now the freaking hero’s boyfriend; swallow

to suggest it, Draco is so out of here.
Potter might have been brave and all of that, but guiltless is stretching the word a bit too far.
Draco's stitching spell catches his finger, and he glares up at Pansy. "We didn't break up."
"Oh."
, left unsaid. This is hard for Draco, but he’s really bloody hoping so.
, which Potter has somehow managed to get them to play even though it's been ages since its release—Draco guesses it might have involved a lot of cash or a lot of friends, or perhaps even both. Either way, he doesn't ask.
“we will go too”  Ron said Hermione nodded, and so it was settled.
The trapdoor above was the only source of dim light in the otherwise pitch-black room, it was small no bigger than Hagrid’s hut. It didn’t take Draco long to realize they weren’t really on the floor, whatever it was they were sitting on had blocked the fall. He also didn’t take long to realize it was moving beneath him. It felt cold, and for a horrible second Draco though they had landed on some sort of snake creature. Before Ron pointed out it was in fact some sort of plant he had never heard of before. The plant had started to twist its snakelike vines around his ankles, and as he tried to get away the grip only got tighter.
What had happened? Was he alive? Was he okay? Did he get the stone? questions assaulted him.
“Stop, stop, stop! You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's LeviOsa, not LeviosAR!” Draco heard Granger screech at Weasley in exasperation. He smirked.
“Weasley levitate on tree” he shouted, Weasley only nodded. “one, two tree … wingardium leviosa” they both yelled The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose into the air “let go on three” Draco instructed and dropped, with a crack, onto the trolls head making the creature sway on the spot and then fall flat on its face. Potter got up whipping his robes, he was out of breath. Draco was shaking and Hermione still stood in the corner of the room next to Weasley.
‘what is?’ he though
“Father,” Draco responded simply taking a sit.
He still acted like his usual self-bothering other students and doing everything in his power to make Longbottom’s and Potters life’s misery. But Pansy often questioned why he had laid off on Granger when they saw each other on weekends. He didn’t really say it was because she was already being casted out by the other Gryffindor’s, and he felt kind of bad making her life misery too. He also didn’t say that she made him feel a little less alone in the time he could not see them. He instead said he hadn’t even noticed because she was irrelevant. He had an incline that Pansy had not fully bought his lie. But she kept quiet about it, she knew better than to question the matter further.
That was until Potter suddenly jumped up accidentally kicking one of Hemione's books at his ribcage.
It was two of days before the big Malfoy Christmas celebration held every year at the manor, and Draco was excited to see his friends again he was starting to get lonely spending hours roaming the halls. That morning when Draco woke up the gardens where completely coated in snow for the first time that year. The white peacocks had been let out to roam freely in the garden, and the house elves where busy putting up the decorations in the back yard, it looked like a scene out of a Christmas card out his window. He was in a good mood, having finally managed to wear off the exhaustion of the term; he was felling energized and had even spend time in the library searching form Flamel. By lunch time he was still sitting in his pajama’s books splayed out across the floor. When his mother came in and let him know he better change; his father was arriving that afternoon. His face must have dropped on accident because she gave him an apologetic look and rushed out the room.
“What are you up to then,” he asked.
“He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance.” He said thougfully after a while
“Mm?” Potter muttered in response with his mouth full of food
“keep to the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in different directions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around, so me, Ron, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Harry , an’ Fang’ll go the other” he finished, bloody perfect, he had to be paired with Potter and the drooling dog going into the forest. He didn’t not say anything as the panic he was currently feeling would surely make his tongue betray him.
So, they did.
(The line alluding to harry knowing flitch is a squib refers to a scene from the book's where he get's detention and finds Filch's Kwikspell letters (a course designed to help adult witches and wizards brush up on their magical skills) of course harry didn't understand what the letters meant or why it matters that filch is a squib.)
“Thank you so much for looking over him” Mrs. Weasley said sincerely and pushed Harry back to the inside of the shop with her adding him to the bunch of Weasley’s around her.
“This is certainly not how I thought we would be meeting,” Snape said still focused on his potions. “does your father know already,” he asked as if he could read Draco’s thoughts, Draco had always had the impression he could.
“I just worry about you” she said, Draco was desperate for the topic to die so he interjected with a different thing.
“I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading,” She said plummeting the book on the table knocking of all the chess pisses that scoffed annoyedly at her
“yeah...”
“who is it?” he shouted from inside.
“Brilliant” he exclaimed, it was a logic puzzle his favorite, he had always loved a riddle.
“what?” Draco asked, Potter just stared at the back of the card and then looked up to him.
“I got lost” Harry whispered. He was covered in dust and his glasses where broken. “I was with the Weasley’s and they had me use Floo and I never had used it before and --  I don’t know why but I ended up here” potter whispered and Draco thought it was too much of a strange story to be made up.
“I’ve found him!” he said trying and falling to keep his voice low “I’ve found Flamel! I knew I’d read the name somewhere already, listen to this” he explained getting the immediate attention of both Weasley and Hermione. “
After the game they all headed to Hagrid’s hut. Draco had never been, but Hermione encouraged him to come. It was awkward at first, he didn’t know what to do or where to sit, Potter on the other hand casually plummeted into one of the chairs and Hagrid offered to make strong tea for him. he just nodded.
“I would ask you the same,” Draco shoot back with disdain. Ron was about to say something when a foul smell made them all turn their heads back. Walking through the opposite corridor they saw the troll, it was about 12 feet tall and was dragging a wooden club on the floor, and they all realized at the same time in terror it was headed directly to the girl’s bathroom.
“Sorry,” he murmured once he was up on his feet, Harry just nodded. They turned back to the centaur.
“Hermione!” Draco beamed before remembering his father was around somewhere and he should not be acting so delighted. He stiffened and just in time his father walked towards them.
Draco didn’t hear much of the rest of the conversation he only knew he found himself standing in a court yard in the castle a few minutes later.
“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on he ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by something We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have to put it out of its misery.”
There was a fire lit, and his father sat behind his oak desk that over the years had started to look a little less daunting, a glass of scotch twinkling in his hand. Draco couldn’t help but remark looked awfully like does mob bosses on Hermione’s muggle novels.
He saw in the corner of his eye professor Dumbledore stood up
Draco had barely managed to get some carrots in his plate when professor Quirrell barged running into the room.
“here,” she said as she read out loud “
“Bet you loved that didn’t you?” Draco smiled sympathetically,
Finally after what felt like the longest break ever, on the 3
“aren’t you cold,” said pansy looking up at him, he was not wearing his robes and was indeed cold. “what you think,” he teased, and made Blaise giggle at the dramatics. Pansy rolled her eyes.
They hadn’t been thought since birth that muggle-borns where the disease of magical society.
"Get me some Gryffindor robes," he said with disgust
“Now you want to talk,” Draco said indignantly pansy didn’t answer but rather got to work on the potion and Draco followed suit.
“We’ve got to catch the key to the door!” Harry followed understating. he din't wait, or consider the possibility it could be a trap at all, instead  immediately took off on the broom following a specific key he had somehow spotted among the crowd. After just a few short minutes he managed to catch it and open the door.
He opened his own bottle and walked into the flames on the opposite direction.  He found himself one again the chess chamber, no sing of Hermione or Weasley, he hoped they had gotten out safely somehow.  He ran back to the key room and took off on the broom just as Harry had said. He didn’t think twice and instead of going all the way back he vanished the glass on the celling of the key chamber and flew outside.
“Malfoy,” he heard Snape call his voice was not as cold as usual.
“I don’t know, but it must be something very valuable”
“yes Pans, as far as he knows everything is smooth sailing,  I'll tell him that I have Potter's trust, you know, just according to then plan,” he said reassuring her,
“Hagrid -- what’s that?” Potter suddenly asked looking directly at the fire, a black metal cauldron hung over the flame, inside Draco could se the outline of a giant black egg. He knew immediately it was a dragon egg. Hagrid started fidgeting with his beard,
“But it makes sense think about it,” Harry finally managed.
years in the common room a couple weeks ago.
“Yeah, you are right,” he simply said.
“What?” he said more defensively than he meant, He didn’t believe her.
The warmth of the summer sun wasn’t enough to make the endless cold hallways of Malfoy manor feel inviting.
“Sorry to disappoint lads, still here” Draco said starting to feel like himself again, they all laughed. “But I might be soon if I don’t get something to eat come on” he said, and the rest of the group Longbottom included followed him out the common room.
By Friday he felt more relaxed, the stress from exams was gone and with Dumbledore at the school and no near death experiences in nearly two weeks he was feeling positive. That was of course until that night at the great hall when Dumbledore didn’t show up to dinner.
“Not fully, from what I can tell he’s basically living of anything that he can, he’s not really capable of doing anything on his own” Draco explained.
(taken from the text - again Hagrids lines, and snape cus every line he ever said It's Just iconic. :))
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter” Draco whispered to Harry making and effort to stay behind so that his father would hear him. “I think it’s better if you go now” he whispered so only Harry could hear.
“This is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I if my father knew I was doing this, he’d —” Draco protested again he notices a note of panic in his own voice. Hagrid just looked at him strangely, it was rather hard to read the man’s face.
It was dark out when the train pulled into kings’ cross station. The windows fogged up scarcely allowing them to see what was going on outside as the train slowed down. The air filled with sounds of goodbyes and bags being dragged around by people eager to get down as soon as the train came to a halt. Draco wiped the fog out the window hoping to spot his parents in the crowd before having to leave the warm interior and venture into the cold night. There he saw his mother, turned back talking to Blaise’s mother. She was laughing, that fake polite laugh Draco knew so well but hadn’t seen in a while, he smiled. He had actually missed her a lot, but the void in his stomach only grew.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked, after a while, Draco notices the note of panic in Potters voice with delight, he also noticed the fact that Potter was trying to make conversation because he was scared.
He gulped and opened the window; his hands were shaking as he recognized his father’s elegant hand writing in the back of the envelope. He fiddled around with the envelope for a few seconds and then threw it onto his bed in frustration, he could not bring himself to open it. He sat on his bed fidgeting with the envelope, for a while, his hands still trembling.  he count take the dread anymore and carefully broke the engraved seal in half. And opened up the letter.
“I guess,” he said she took this as cue to keep speaking
“Yes sir, it’s me Malfoy” Draco said rushing his words “could I have a word?” he asked.
“at least my family doesn’t like me conditionally,” Weasley said
“I must get back to work now,” said his father, suddenly a stack of papers materializing between them. Draco got up from his chair felling slightly light headed and turned for the door.
“So cute thinks they stand a chance,” pansy teased. Draco just rolled his eyes
“He didn’t I’m telling you it’s not Snape,” Draco said again.
“Malfoy, pst -- Malfoy” he turned around looking at the triangular cabinet behind him and wondered if it was some sort of spell. “Draco” he heard a whisper again, Draco though he was losing his mind it sounded like potter, but how could it be? “Malfoy it’s me” this time he was almost certain it was potter but it didn’t make sense.
“Ah, Hagrid, the last trees, put them in the far corner, would you?” Professor McGonagall bellowed form the other edge of the hall as she saw Hagrid come in.
“I don’t know,” Potter said.
“Look its exams week and Dumbledore has an obligation to be here at all times until OWLS and NEWTS are finished, is a ministry rule or something,” Draco said recalling overhearing McGonagall talking about it to some 5
How he had managed to get through his history of magic, herbology and transfiguration finals was a mystery to him, as he found himself out in the grounds the next Friday evening. They still had four more exams to go and Draco felt exhausted, couldn't wait till next Thursday evening when everything would be done.
“Professor, its Harry, the stone, and he went in all alone and it be dead, he thinks Snape is involved, and the dark lord and -- and -- and" he said frantically,
“So, I’ve been thinking” Hermione began, Weasley tried and failed no to look annoyed.
How could this have happened, he was practically raised a Slytherin, he even had the robes already, and more importantly, what would his father say about this?
The day went by slowly in an excruciating history of magic class Draco prayed wouldn’t be tested next term because he could hardly focus on a quarter of what professor bins was saying. By late afternoon he wasn’t sure he had even paid attention to any of his classes that day, his brain still running over the lines he had been preparing for his parents the last couple of weeks. Later that afternoon the group found themselves walking around the halls, taking some of time to really do nothing for the first time in a while. They were talking about the embarrassing defeat of Gryffindor to the Ravenclaw team the week prior, to which Harry argued had only been a mistake because his glassed had fogged up because of the cold. They were turning a corner when the found Hagrid who was dragging two large Christmas trees leaving a trail of steps on the floor.
Friday evening exams results were finally posted and to Draco’s delight he had managed to beat out granger not only in potions but in charms and History of magic. She of course still got top of the class on everything else but he couldn’t really bring himself to be angry or envious about it, he surprised himself by even managing to be happy for her, even if he was a little disappointed he hadn’t managed to beat her out for the top spot.
“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” Questioned Weasley.
They talked for what felt like ages to Draco, until his mother finally interrupted letting his father know food was ready. they Both left the room and as soon as his parents were out of sight Draco let his shoulders relax and he slumped in the couch thinking bitterly that if it hadn’t been in Gryffindor he probably would have told his dad everything. His father could be distant and cold, and was annoyingly old fashioned in terms of manners, always reminding Draco of all the old pureblood customs he was supposed to uphold as the Malfoy heir, but he also always cared to listen to Draco, and Draco wanted nothing but to make him proud ever since he could remember. The pit in his stomach grew thinking about letting his father down even further when he found out for sure that Potter was indeed never going to be on their side. Or the fact that his father would never approve his growing friendship with Granger and surprisingly Weasley. Yet for the first time and almost despite what he had believed he didn’t feel and overwhelming urge to cut ties with them after having spoken to his father, he was sure he hadn’t done much wrong yet and wished in that moment he had someone other than his family around to talk to.
It was a cold morning the grounds where fully covered in snow from the night before, and Draco had dragged himself out of his warm bed with great effort, it was only two days left and midterms where officially over. Hermione was beaming when he got to the great hall that morning, the stress of exams she had been carrying for the past couple of weeks had vanished and managed to turn her into a completely different person. She greeted Draco, wide smile and cheery voice, like she was determined to have the best day of her life, Draco could only wonder where she got her energy that early in the morning, he just groaned and took a sit.
"I’m going back to bed, good night Potter” he said ending desperate to end the awkward conversation
“Its Devil’s Snare!” granger said, Draco had never heard that name before. definitely hadn’t been covered in their herbology lessons that year. He cursed himself for never doing any of the extra reading.
“That as uncalled for,” she complained and Draco simply laughed, they walked in silence for a while “Thank you,” Draco finally said as they exited the school and headed towards the quidditch pitch. Pansy smiled.
“No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?” Hagrid asked,
“Done,” Draco suddenly heard his father say. “Come, Draco —” Draco panicked now knowing what to do.
Back at Hogwarts he surprised himself being much happier to see Potter and Weasley again that he thought he would be, but of course he would never admit that to anyone. He instead kept up his usual too good for their antics attitude, as he happily went back into his routine of classes and Flamel investigation. It was clear to him the boys hadn’t done much progress just as he had expected. He was also quick to brag about his new nimbus 2001, it was still such a delight to see Weasley green with envy but trying not to look it as he described the features and facts he had discovered about his new broom.
“It will probably be fine, It's jut a house,” pansy said to him probably for like the millionth time that year.
"How the hell did you know that” Draco asked as he managed to stand up and wipe the dust off his shirt.
“Draco, I - err assume you know what you are going to tell you father when you get back” she said timidly,
“maybe” she said but she didn’t sound convinced at all, Draco was starting to give up.
“They are all okay” she finally said.
“And I thought your family could sink no lower —” his father said glancing at Hermione’s parents.
Draco though he was losing his mind for a couple of weeks, as he started to slowly come to believe the only other person with some common sense in the entire house of Gryffindor was Granger. As of lately she seemed equally as displeased with Potter and the weasel as him. Draco noticed she had completely stopped talking to them, and while him and Granger barley exchanged any words. They now normally sat together in class as neither of them felt particularly keen of their house mates. Plus they made good partners for assignments as they were equally committed, and normally placed first and second in tasks. Although it could not be said they were friends, they were not by any means, they now greeted each other in the mornings out of common courtesy.
The rest of the weekend was slow, Potter was on edge since the forest. Draco noticed he had begun to wake up multiple times in the middle of the night. He heard him breathing heavily and sometimes even muttering incomprehensibly in his sleep before he jumped awake. He was constantly rubbing his forehead and complaining of a headache, but was somehow still managing to study for most of the time. Presumably to keep himself occupied and away from the thought that the dark lord himself might barge in at any minute and try to kill him. This knowledge of course wasn’t doing Draco any favors either, and between the stress of exams, the looming fear of a murderous mad man, and Potters anxiousness he found himself on edge as well.
“None of you have even looked my way all week,” he finally said
“If anything happens to me, go straight to the owlery get Dumbledore” Draco wondered in that moment why they hadn't done that before hand but it was too late harry had disappeared  into the dark pit.
The weeks went by and the rain was getting unbearable. But perhaps most annoying was the fact that even though exams where months away Hermione had already started to panic over them, to Draco it seemed a bit over kill, after all it was only first year. The fifth years appeared less worried about O.W.L.S than Hermione and though Draco had grown quite frond of her he was finding her constant nagging really annoying. Potter was gone most of the time to quidditch practice the defining match against Hufflepuff being just days away. Draco spend most of his time doing boring assignments and making them as perfect as he could to beat Granger out on them or reading in the common room, he was so bored that he even picked up one of  Hermione’s muggle novels.
“Well then,” he said, Hermione laughed. “see you tomorrow, we won’t forget to say goodbye,” she promised and they went on their way. Of course, as the days before they found absolutely nothing and went back to the common room defeated.
“Well, well, well,” flitch ridiculed as he walked towards them. “you are in trouble.”
“We are fine!” Harry shouted, but Draco felt anything but fine. “The unicorn is dead Hagrid” Harry said, Draco didn’t know how Harry was managing to speak, his head felt like it was swimming, he felt dizzy and disoriented, his knees ached with pain, and his eyes struggled to focus. Draco noticed Harry looked as horrible as he felt but he couldn’t think properly.
“Let go get your robes, wouldn’t want you to catch a cold and then miss Gryffindor’s defeat,” pansy said as she signaled Draco to follow her inside leaving Blaise with Bulstrode.
Granger didn’t turn up for the next class, or the one after it, she wasn’t seen at lunch and Draco could not help but worry about her. She heard from one the Patil twins that she had been crying on the girl’s bathroom most of the day and just wanted to be left alone. Draco though about going to look for her but he brushed the thought off thinking it would be a strange thing to do considering they were not friends. So, till diner time he debated with himself on how to proceed. He went down to great hall for the Halloween celebration worry still in his mind and resulted that if Granger didn’t show after 20 minutes he would go look for her.
“You are not dead!” Finnegan exclaimed as he saw him.
“piss off,” Weasley said.
“Touch nothing, Draco.” His father turned back to say to him before walking inside. “— ah, Mr. Borgin.” His father said greeting the tiny old man perched behind the counter,
They though he was insane, they had blind trust in Dumbledore. Draco didn’t really blame them, he knew his perspective on the matter was completely different. They hadn’t been around speculation about Potter their hole life’s, they hadn’t grown up listing to adults talk about the dark lord in whispers when they though he couldn’t hear, they hadn’t grown up going to events filled with sympathizers of the cause.
When he was done pansy looked at him in disbelief
The car slowed down as the lines of tress gave way and the full manor came into view. The towering windows and dark exterior gave the manor and ominous look. It, never the less looked smaller that Draco remembered, yet equally as intimidating as before. It was a strange felling to be home. He looked up to his window the curtains where drawn shut. The car came to a halt right in front of the porch. The doors of the car flew open letting on the cold air of the night. Draco shivered and stepped out of the car. He walked slowly up the marvel stairs to the craved front door that sung open as soon as he approached.
“she needs to sort out her priorities” Ron said Draco found himself agreeing
“MR. POTTER” she yelled at the crowd. Draco smiled to his friends and was satisfied as they took Potter away hopefully to expel him. The rest of the class was, well, boring madam hootch returned after a while and though the more inexperienced people the basics of flying. It was terribly boring to Draco, never the less his success in getting Potter in trouble had put him in a good mood that could not possibly be broken.
“Hi,” she said timidly as if she hadn’t known Draco for years before hand. Draco couldn’t help but look jealously at her tie
“You know my parents pans,” he sighted and tough to himself that Hogwarts really had way too many stairs.
“not me, the twins wanted to prank you, and found your little letter, I would not have brought it up but you had to mention my family didn’t you,” Draco could tell Weasley was losing the confidence he was appearing to have. Never the less he was too angry to think rationally, so before his emotions could take a hold of him and make him do something he would regret he headed for the door.
“Just tomorrow,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — we’ve been out for a while we should be in the library.” She said. Ron rolled his eyes.
“Now, if you three don't mind, I'm going to bed before any of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled.” They all looked at her in bewilderment. As she stormed out.
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, “Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.”
“Come on, run, run!” Draco yelled at Hermione but she was still frozen against the wall.
“We don’t know yet” she sighted rubbing her temples as she stirred her tea. “Mr. potter had lost consciousness by the time professor Dumbledore found him. We don’t know how but he somehow managed to stop Quirrell from getting the stone” Draco sat up confused,
“Friends again” pansy asked after the whole ordeal was over and they were leaving the points classroom
“So?” pansy asked
“Well — yeah how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, eh? So I told him, Fluffy’s apiece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep ” Draco’s face dropped at the same time as Hagrid’s. The image of the dark lord knowing exactly how to get past the 3 headed dog materialized in his mind.
He decided it was best to go to bed as soon as possible, he didn’t want to be part of any conversations. Just alone with his thoughts. So, he put on his pajamas and closed the scarlet curtains around his bed as soon as he could and cursed his luck. He heard the rest of the boys in the room chatting for a while, and learned the names of Seamus and Dean, not that that was important him of course, but it was impossible not to over hear them. He also found it strange Potter had also appeared to have gone to bed early.
“It was Snape,” Weasley was explaining, “we all saw him. He was cursing your broomstick,”
“don’t you reckon it’s a bit strange all the curtains are drawn at Hagrid’s, ” Weasley pointed out mid conversation
“Just walking,” Hermione said.
“you figured it out didn’t you” said Ron unfazed.
“Confuse it!” Potter yelled desperately Draco without really thinking started picking scraps form the floor and swinging them with all his forces at the head of the troll and soon enough harry followed suit. They clearly didn’t think their next move through as the troll turned around and slowly started to approach them. Weasley made a run for the other side of the bathroom
“Sir,”
“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” Hermione took Hagrid’s binoculars of his hands.
“Fine” Harry took the vial from his hand.
She shifted on her chair, and fixed her hair carefully, Draco wasn’t quite sure what to do, she must have noticed him awkwardly standing by the couch and signaled so he sat I the chair opposite to her. She sighted, and started to fidget with her ring, as Draco knew she often did when she was nervous. They heard the front door open, and the *crack* of elves materializing and disappearing presumably to receive his dads coat or other belongings he might be carrying. A few moments later he stepped into the room Draco and his mother where in.
“Fluffy?!” Draco exclaimed “the dog, the huge dog?”
“I – Surely did not think this is how we would be meting – yet Draco has told me all about you, where were you headed to next Mr. potter?”  his father asked, Draco ignored his phrasing implied he hadn’t really believed it was just an accident Harry had been at Borgin and Burkes.
“Idiot” he sneered to what thought was only to himself but he heard pansy laugh with him.
He sat there for what feel like an eternity, until he felt someone tap him on the back. he got of the stool, The hall was early quiet, his friends stared at him form the Slytherin table, there were no cheers like there had been for the other students just silence. He felt like the world was spinning around him.
“Yes” Draco smiled. Perhaps it wasn’t all bad.
That weekend was considerably better. Now that him and pansy where friends again he stared to hang out around her and her new friends more. Crab and Goyle where nowhere to be seen they had apparently found someone else to follow around, and Draco though it was better that way. He spent most of his time with Blaise and pansy and some other occasional first year but having friends to finally rant about Potter’s stupidity was amazing. Pansy agreed on his opinions about Potter's incompetence and Draco felt his old confidence slowly coming back. He wasn’t in Slytherin; but that did not mean he could not make Potters life hell. After all the friend idea was pointless at that point, in his mind it was over as soon as Potter had rejected him before the sorting ceremony. It didn’t take long for Draco to be back to his former self, making himself heard where ever he went, and being mean to others.
The rest of their time was spent either hunting for hard to come by chairs by the fire place, or searching the endless rows of books of the Hogwarts library for any clue about Nicolas Flamel. Though there weren’t any closer than before, and not knowing where to start but being afraid to ask, it was entirely up to luck whether they were ever going to find anything at all. The trio seemed to be completely driven to find out what the object was on the basis of a fear of it being stolen. Draco on the other hand could only say that he was contributing heavily to the search of Flamel because curiosity got the best of him, and because he kind of wanted to prove to them that it wasn’t Snape. A second quidditch Mach and the last for the year made them see Potter less and less. He often only had time to crash into bed. Which of course made him not able to contribute much to their search efforts. So, him Granger and Weasley where the ones spending long hours in the library when their duties for the day where done. Often it was mostly him and Granger doing the searching while Weasley complained, but they got the job done.
“what the hell do you plan on doing with a dragon,” he finally snapped, Hagrid look at him displeased.
“maybe he’s just not home,” suggested Weasley, Draco looked up from his book.
“I need to make sure no one would listen”
“How many days you got left until holidays?” Hagrid asked. As he joined them again.
“Get me out of here” Harry begged
“Son,” said his father setting the glass on the table in front of him and shifting in his chair
"for what?” Draco asked suddenly sounding like a helpless child.
“They can’t expect you to just ignore everyone in your house and pretend that they don’t exits that would just be hell,” she said Draco wasn’t so sure, but he didn’t refute her.
“I’m going to go guarantee my Slytherin pals that we will give them the defeat of the century, so, you better not let me down Potter,” Draco said pretending to be really mad, over exaggerating the expressions he typically used to show disdain.  Potter gave him a half smile as headed out of the great hall to find Pansy.
“I didn’t say that!” he said laying down a cup of tea on the table and refrained from speaking the rest of the evening.
“Listen to me, get back and get the broom from the flying-key room, it will get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, I might be able to hold off for a while, but if its Voldemort behind that door --” Harry stopped,
“But Harry, ” Hermione tried to interfere.
"I can’t in good conscience put you in Slytherin, you will see I’m right with time you are for sure a “GRYFFINDOR,” the hat shouted, Draco couldn’t believe his ears. It could not be right.
"FINE” he shouted again the door flew open
“Just tell me now” he said waiting to hear that Harry had died and that Voldemort was on the loose. The professor sat in front of him and took off her glasses and set them on the table she let out a heavy sigh, She looked in some way older, the lines on her face looked deeper than Draco had ever cared to notice.
“Harry , you can do this, you are a great wizard you know” she said with a sudden change her tone, Draco didn’t want to think about it but it sounded almost goodbye like.
“it called being friends but you wouldn’t know about that would you Malfoy,” Weasley said.
“Is that so Potter?” Draco interrupted walking down the stairs. Harry stopped talking, looked at him suspired for a second.
“What’s brilliant,” asked Harry.
It was knockturn alley, Draco had never been allowed before, but diligently followed his father to the dark alleyway.
“You can possibly be serious,” he said with all the confidence he managed to put in his voice, noticing that a note of fear still had slipped through. “I’m not going into the forest,” he said with resolve.
“whatever, it's getting late, better get ready for the feast” she said. The sun was setting in the horizon over the great lake. Draco felt a little sting in his heart as he realized his first year at Hogwarts was almost officially over.
“I was thinking of what you said back earlier” Draco said sitting up straight to face Potter who mimicked him and sat cross legged on his own bed. “about Dumbledore” he clarified “I told Hermione the other night that I though he had somehow wanted us to go down there, and she looked at me like I had gone completely mental” Harry looked at him as if his pondering on his words for a few seconds
The feast was grand as always, and Slytherin took the house cup. Draco encouraged his friends to cheer in the spirit of companionship or something stupid like that. He laughed the entire time and Hermione made him swear he would write during the summer, he thought it was unlikely but he would certainly try, and after that it was done, and he was in his dorm packing the last of his robes and scarfs into his trunk, full to the brim in crimson red, it didn’t look strange anymore.
“Snape is trying to steal it,” Hermione chimed in, Draco rolled his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now that you mention it, I did think it was a bit strange he hasn’t invited us over for tea in a while,” Potter commented looking at the hut.
“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked
Then like a switch had flipped his face turned back to normal his features softening. Draco notices for the first time it was almost night out.
“HERMIONE, THE GIT NEEDS YOU”
“Won it,” said Hagrid.
“Before school Hagrid took a little package out of a vault,” “what was it?” Ron asked still stuffing his mouth with more food.
“You mention nothing of this to your mother” his father said as they made their way through the crowd and back to the Leaky Cauldron.
“Mr. Malfoy” Harry muttered. “I – thank you for leading me all the way here but I better head off now Mrs. Weasley must be terribly worried” Harry said.
“How do you know about Fluffy?”
“how did you get it, Hagrid?” Ron interrupted.
“Come on Potter, if you don’t eat and you faint mid game how do you think that is going to make everyone like you,” Draco pointed out
In the morning, He woke early finding Potter and Weasley already in the common room playing chess on some old and very beaten set. Draco was never a fan of the game, yet he watched them play for almost an hour till Hermione came down and convinced them to go to breakfast. Draco didn’t eat much he  also didn’t pay much attention at Hermione seemingly endless rant about the strategy to find Flamel. But finally, at around 11 Draco was boarding the train accompanied by Pansy, Granger had gone with Neville for the day, as she didn’t really like pansy much. He steeled into one of the compartments and soon Blaise joined in and the train left the Hogwarts grounds he felt a sudden panic that stayed for the rest of the trip back home. He didn’t speak much just listened in on pansy’s and Blaise’s conversation. Most of the time they talked about holiday plans, exams, and reminisced on things Draco had not been there for, like fights in the Slytherin common room, or a terrible charms class they had two days ago when a Hufflepuff knocked professor Flitwick off his book stack by accident. Draco thought to himself in another universe he would have been with them and known exactly what they were talking about, and it hurt him just a little.
“but of course he is, look at the chimney,” he said. “weird day to have the chimney on if you ask me, it’s the only good weather we gotten in months,” he added.
“Mr. Borgin, I think we are quite done here” his father said dryly and walked out the shop. His father looked at them both and guided Draco and Harry to the corner behind the shop.
“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”  Granger said
“I’m glad to see you ” he said, and, he actually really meant it.
“Hey on the bright side we only have like 3 more weeks till schools out” Blaise said. Draco wasn’t sure that was a complete positive, quite the opposite, he was even stating to feel a bit jealous of Potter for staying at school for the holidays.
“Apparently not if they are made by something magical, or well that’s what Pomfrey said” there was silence for a moment “how else am I supposed to show everyone that I survived again anyway” he said mockingly, Draco chuckled.
“I - I’m glad you are okay to” he muttered but hoped she got that he actually really did mean it. He cleared his throat “I saw both of them, they said they’ll be fine” he said this time louder  “Potter might not wake up for a couple of days still”  he noticed saying potter felt strangely different,
Draco didn’t get more that 3 hours of sleep that night with all the overthinking he did. This was definitely not the way to start his first proper day of classes at Hogwarts.
“Well yeah you are allowed to make friends,” pansy said Draco could tell she wanted badly to ask the question that was on her mind.
“er – yes sir” he hesitated.
“The?” asked to Harry eagerly. “I can’t tell you, “He said.
Snape wasn’t pleasant to be around when Potter was involved on that Draco was clear. The disdain for each other was very much mutual. Despite that Draco could bring himself to believe it was him behind all  the stuff  Harry, Ron and Hermione  where trying to pin on him.
“That’s er …”
“I am aware my son, but is the mudblood really necessary company,” he inquired
“PIG SNOUT,” Weasley shouted
“Well, take care of it of course,” Hagrid said.
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” peeves then started to shout.
“Having a jolly time Mr. Malfoy,” she teased using her posh accent she used to talk to adults.
“let’s go,” he whispered to Hermione before they could get in trouble, and they ran down back to the Gryffindor stands, just in time to see Potter speeding directly towards the ground following the little snitch. Hermione covered his eyes, it looked like Potter was going to crash directly into the ground for a second.  Draco saw him clasp his hand to his mouth as he motioned to pull his broom, he thought was about to be sick, as he rolled onto the field. Potter then coughed and the snitch fell onto his hand.  He then started frantically waving the ball around. It took a second to sink in they had won!
“I. don’t” Hermione began
They turned a few corners and finally reached a dead end, with a closed door.
The ending of the school year was looming over Draco like a cloud, and every day he got a little more jealous of Potter and Weasley who were staying back at Hogwarts for the holidays. In another life he probably would have been insulting Potter, and telling him it was so sad he had to stay behind because no one wanted him home, or that it was pathetic that the Weasley’s could only afford to go on vacations of two; that they had had more children that they could manage and breed like thoughtless rabbits. Yet he felt nothing of this sort, instead, the feeling in his gut as the holidays loomed closer was nothing but dread of going back home and a complete certainty that Potter was for sure going to have a better holiday than him whether he got any presents or not, as he had said he wouldn’t.
