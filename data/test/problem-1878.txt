“Drink.” He told Harry holding the vial up in the air as if to pour it directly into his mouth.
“Can go.” George confirmed with a twinkling glint.
much less be told. Harry shuddered with acknowledgment of his ignorance, unable to look up at where she sat, poised and pretty at her desk. “You can punish me however you want.” He whispered, unwilling to let the tears welling in his eyes to fall. Harry braced himself, back straight, legs planted and arms hanging loose at his side no matter how much he wanted to protect himself. Uncle Vernon had hated when Harry tried to shield his body.
They landed inside the wards of the estate with an echoing bang. “Easy there, Ms. Granger.” Narcissa smoothed a loose curl from the girl’s flushed cheek. “If you are going to vomit, I suggest the grass.” Hermione laughed despite the very real possibility she might lose her dinner. “Or, if you would rather, just inside, there is a hideous vase from my mother-in-law. Absolutely terrible taste.” Narcissa led them to the warmth of the Manor.
Allies and Enemies 7: Narcissa on the war path
“Harry. Harry, stop. Stop please.” Draco said softly. “Its’ not like that anymore.” Draco visibly geared himself up. Harry held himself perfectly still, willing to listen. “All that pureblood bullshit doesn’t mean anything to me.” Draco announced, face like stone. “It’s arbitrary to measure power by bloodlines. The Dark Lord was a mudblood and raised by muggles. He is one of the most powerful wizards in the world. And Granger,” Draco looked her right in the eye, “is definitely smarter than any pureblood I’ve ever met. Except my mother, of course.” He said with loyalty. “I meant,” Draco turned his gaze back to a contemplative Harry. “she literally drew my blood.” He touched a pale hand to his still crooked nose sheepishly.
Tonight, leading Harry to his rooms, Draco had never felt warmer. A stray thought, sudden and stark, shook Draco to his core.
“I see.” Professor Umbridge tsked. “Well, that certainly changes things.” Hermione found herself face to face with Delores Umbridge's short Birchwood wand. “One simple little Forgetfulness charm and no harm done.”
“Why is that Ravenclaw girl staring at you and crying?” Draco sounded genuinely perplexed. Harry looked up quick then back down at his still full plate. Odd. He was sure he had already eaten some apple slices. Draco nudged him for an answer. Harry had none to give.
His words went unheard. Only Narcissa’s gentle crooning eventually pulled the boy out of his own mind. She cuddled him close, slowly, and gently laying the petite teenager against her torso. Thin arms that had been hanging limply at his sides reached up to wrap around the posh witch. A trickle of sweat glittered at Harry’s hairline. Clearly, Severus had pushed the boy too hard. Guilt warred with shame sitting in his belly unacceptably uncomfortable.
“Severus.” Narcissa spoke first, her voice hoarse as she acknowledged her guest with a strained smile. She was barely holding herself in check. He could literally see the struggle across her fine features.
apologies for the delay. recovering from covid left me weak, limp, and listless. it was two weeks before i could even contemplate writing. even then, typing this took the whole day and several naps. i hope everyone out there is staying safe and happy and please, please, please wear your masks.
“No sir.” Subdued and quiet, Harry slumped with exhaustion. Narcissa shifted to take some of his insubstantial weight.
“No one is saying you are.” Draco stated, glaring at Pansy.

“Ms. Granger.” Professor Umbridge chirped in a wholly unpleasant manner, “You’ll be serving detention with me tonight.”
“It’s all about the vanilla.” Harry said with all seriousness. He followed her down the corridor.
“But… why?” Professor McGonagall asked with pure confusion. She seemed to be the only one not upset, just perplexed.
“Lady Malfoy, an honour.”
asshole. At least not physically.
to wake you.” He sassed back.
“I believe it is.” Professor Snape’s dark voice joined in. Harry let out his pent-up breath. “You two better get started.” He said to the boys. “Perhaps, Mr. Weasley could explain his objections.” Ron visibly swallowed, shaking his head ‘no’. “No objections he mumbled to the stone floor before taking his abandoned seat between Dean and Seamus.
Draco's Pov of certain things
“Draco, dear, come sit. I will call for some tea. I’m afraid no one else is awake yet.” Narcissa waved to the loveseat near her desk. It was gray velour with an unusual sheen gleaming in the evening light. Draco sat first while Harry, still stone faced, fidgeted nearby. Draco huffed at the smaller boy, exasperated, and rolling his eyes.
“No one beats your blueberry pancakes, Harry.” She said pulling away to wander down the stairwell.
“Yes, Lady Malfoy.” the house elf appeared.
“Hmmmmmm.” Draco rumbled. “Cuz you are. Little.” His warm breath ghosted over Harry’s cheek. “Sweet and cuddly.” Draco slurred and settled further into his pillows. He was very nearly asleep. “Want to kiss you again.” He murmured right before breathing out a soft snore.
“Not particularly.” Draco answered with full honesty. His hand left the dark head to trace a delicate path down the length of Harry’s spine, leaving goosebumps in his wake.

Narcissa was not sure if it had all been a ruse. Lucius’s devotion after the Dark Lord’s misfortunes. A way to pass the time before his return? A passing fancy? Lucius had spent considerable time and attention on both his wife and son. The Malfoy’s were a tight little family soaking in the gregarious devotion of a doting father and husband. The kind of husband every little witch wished upon stars for.
More than pleased with the result, Draco lifted his head. “Come sit with me.” He demanded in a whisper, ignoring Pansy and Blaise as they cooed behind his back. He was also blatantly ignoring the giggling Loo… Luna and the Twins exchanging money. Surprisingly, Longbottom remained stoic and vigilant.

“Be that as it may, the pain could prevent you from sleeping and the Unburdening, as we well know, lowers your inhibitions. If you are tempted to utilize your magic… this could reverse any progress you’ve made.” Severus explained. “I’m going to recommend meditation exercises during the day and then after supper, a half dose of the Standard Pain Reliever. If needed.”
Luna now found herself in a new situation with no experience on how to extract herself from her companions without disturbing them. Not that there wasn’t enough room in the bed, it’s luxuriousness matched it’s massiveness. Since she could not leave and the demands of her body functions were not dire, Luna took the time to think about how Pansy had said they should stick together even though trust between houses was nonexistent. Luna
“It’s not safe.” Said Absolutely Fred fiercely.
This kind of attention was

“Harry,” Severus used that tone. The one that never failed to get the attention of the most negligent student. He waited until the panicked eyes latched onto his face. “You are safe here.”

“To best the beastie yourself!” This time it was Probably Fred laying a surprisingly tender kiss on her still wet cheek.

always having to be so proper all the bloody time. “Are you alright?” Granger plowed on in true Gryffindor style, blundering and worried. Any sleepiness the other girl might’ve felt was absent beneath her laser focus on the boy-who-live. Harry, the liar, nodded he was fine but went into a hug with clear and blissful relief. The boy was starved for affection. Pansy did not blame him as she could relate.
“Harry came up with a plan!” George said helpfully.
“I know, I just, you’re up… and I missed you.” She blushed in her excitement.
greeting Narcissa
at the end of Second Year. Before Dobby had intervened, Lucius had had every intention on finishing what the Dark Lord started.
“I was wondering…” Harry paused again, biting his chapped bottom lip. Narcissa was please to not the skin was now pinker as his health recovered. “Is there a spell…” again he paused as if searching for the right words to use. Narcissa was fascinated by the embarrassment covering his face and concerned by the shadows of guilt lingering in his lowered head. The poor child did not even know how to express his needs. “The words are so small.” He explained finally as he looked everywhere but her face.
“What the hell, Malfoy?” Ron yelled again, ignoring the hastily approaching Professor McGonagall in favor of causing an even bigger scene, complete with Professor Umbridge squawking from her perch at the Head Table.
“Take these.” Severus shrunk the fully packed case for Draco to pocket. “Fire call when you get there. I will visit as soon as I am able.” Snape promised. Draco sighed in defeat. “Winter Solstice is coming soon. You will see me then. Plus, your young man will need a continuous supply of my work to overcome the long-term malnourishment.”
A whimper slid out of his mouth that he quickly stifled with his knuckles. Harry stared at the dark wood of the closed door and only the sound of a flush had him scurrying back into the bed. His limbs were fumbling and his heart racing. His dick, an unwelcome by product of his thoughts. It was hard and insistent against his threadbare boxers. Harry hurried to cover himself with blankets and willed his heat into beating at a more normal pace.
“I’m not surprised you and my son have had a falling out. I am surprised by the swiftness of its occurrence. Draco has always been so sensitive. He gets that from me I’m afraid.” She announced with a soft yet sly smile.
“Harry!” Ron yelled. “You’re injured!” as if he were unaware. His friend thoughtlessly grabbed the bandaged hand. Harry could no hold back the pained gasp which morphed into an embarrassingly loud squeak when a certain blonde Slytherin reached around Harry, squeezing Ron’s arm right above the wrist until Harry was free. Then somehow Harry was twirled around to find himself staring at Draco’s broad shoulders. When did they get so large? Harry thought, luckily not letting the words spill out of his lips.
What ever Draco saw on Harry’s face curbed his questions. He crawled into the bed and did not hesitate to crowd Harry even with all the space of a mattress bigger than the smallest Dursley bedroom. Draco pulled the soft gray duvet out of Harry’s sweaty palms and smoothed it down with long fingers.
“Yes, Draco.” Harry rolled his eyes dramatically. “You are not wrong even though you sound more and more like Snape.”
“But you are still in pain.” Lady Malfoy questioned with a sharp voice and eyebrow raised. Her light sent of roses incongruent with deep burgundy lipstick.
“Has already made his position clear.” Draco interrupted. He took the blue vial, slipping it easily into his pocket and headed for the exit, conversation over.
Eventually, she relented. “Alright Harry,” Narcissa said. “Draco, wont you show your friend to the kitchens for an early supper. The others should be waking soon.” She glanced at the ornate clock on the mantel. “Severus will be arriving tonight. Hopefully, he will be willing to share what he knows about depleted cores. In the meantime, young man, you are to rest.” Relieved she was giving him a break, Harry nodded quickly. “That means no magic.” She instructed. “Draco can help you should you need him.”
I also have several other projects I’m working on: catching up/finishing up/palette cleansing/self indulgence but…
“You’ll tell me when you do?” Harry said, confident Draco would agree.
Harry settled lightly on his shoulders, a responsibility he would gladly acquire. The Gryffindor’s wardrobe had much to be desired, though, in hindsight, Draco realized it was not Harry’s fault.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m so glad,” she continued at a more normal level of noise. “So, you came back for a visit then?”
Draco hummed noncommittal and moved up, adjusting his pillows to lay back down on his side. He curled into Harry making him feel
“They have.” Harry hurried to assure him before the residual despair and self-loathing could tie his tongue. “I’m sorry I’m such a freak.”

Chapter 2
“Are you questioning my authority, missy?” Professor Umbridge implored, cocking her head to the side like a curious, heinous little kitten. Hermione felt a violence rage up inside. She palmed the quill as if it were a dagger.
Do not accidently open tikkytok in the middle of writing a chapter.
“Then I should hold a grudge too.” Harry said thoughtfully, cocking his head to the side unknowing how adorable the movement made him.
his current actions. His responses to this environment were instinctual as they were unhelpful. Harry wanted to keep his magic. He wanted to get better, and he knew that Snape was an asshole. He also
“I remember.” He said congenially, perfectly aware she was the guardian of Gryffindor Tower. However, his regret was instant when she squealed with delight. The noise was piercing. Several of the other painting shushed her reproachfully.
“Believe me when I tell you,” Lady Malfoy caught his eye, held them there with her intense focus. “You will find justice.” She promised. “And” she used a sharp pointed black lacquered nail to lift his chin. “I will keep you safe.” Her eyes remained wide and unblinking. Hypnotic. Staring deep into Harry’s very soul. Something dark and cold unfurled with the warmth her words provoked.
“Unless you want detention for the entirety of your Hogwarts career, I suggest you take you punishment without further argument.” Snape warned.
“Harry, I don’t think you even know what that word means.” Draco said in complete exasperation.
“You denied Voldemort is back. You are member of the Order. You know the facts and still, you acted like I was a liar. Just like everyone else.” Harry finished, ignored the burning tears on his cheeks. He did not try to stop them. Could not even imagine acknowledging their presence by wiping the wet away.
“But you have used magic. I’ve seen it.” Draco was positive Harry had lit up the tunnel on the way to Hogsmeade.
“Perhaps it would be best if you wait outside.” Professor Snape said before she could answer.
“Saturday.” Pansy’s gaze swung to Harry, voice laced with disbelief.
“Harry dear,” Narcissa spoke softly. “It’s time for rest.” Unburdened and clearly exhausted, the Gryffindor grinned appreciatively. “Draco will show you to bed. You don’t mind sharing, my Dragon?” she addressed her son. Draco had to spend the rest of his energy schooling the surprise away from his face. He had assumed his mother would place them in separate bedrooms, knowing his inclinations as she did and correctly guessing his unexplored feelings towards the other boy. Those of the romantic variety. Draco nodded his assent to his mother before bidding her goodnight.
“Thursday.” Draco said flatly. His face was just as stormy as his eyes. A veritable thundercloud. Harry did not want to continue the conversation. He just did not see the point. “Are you telling me you haven’t slept since Thursday, Harry.” Harry, not Potter. The way Draco said his name caused goosebumps to rise beneath the borrowed supple green shirt.
“I see.” Snape arched his brows when Narcissa shot Harry a particular look. That furious face morphed, the mouth opening and closing without any intelligence spilling out. Then snapped shut with resolution. Harry shook his head decidedly not expanding on his answer.
“Ok… I’m up, I’m up.” Harry held out both of his arms for Hermione to help pull him to standing. “This sucks.” he admitted breathlessly, panting into her shoulder as she waited for him to find his feet.
Pansy felt a great well of pity for her friend. Clueless, the boy was clueless. Loving Harry Potter was going to be a difficult undertaking. Keeping them together… even more so.
“But you can’t know that for certain.” Harry asked hesitantly. Hopefully.
“Draco, dear, you’re seething.” She observed to lighten her own dark thoughts. Not that it worked on either of their ends. Still, Draco straightened out his façade, unclenched his fist, leaned into the cool marbled walls. “This does not explain why he wont let you touch him.” She pounced once her friend relaxed.
“Harry! What are you doing down here by yourself?” His friend was crouched in front of him in a half abortive hug. She had relit the fire and was looking concerned, reaching up to feel Harry’s forehead with her cool delicate hand. Usually, she hugged him full force. Harry was grateful she was showing restraint just as much as he was sad to not feel her slim compact body slam into him. To feel her surprisingly strong arms around his torso. The softest of vise. Harry loved Hermione’s hugs. Loved the surprise each time and her general accepted of his
“Oh. That’s just Cho.” Hermione answered for him. “She likes Harry.” She added dismissively, still reading and daintily eating fruit slices.
, was the desperate thought resounding in his brain with he gasped for breath, bent over in the dank and dirty Riddle Manor. The Dark Lord realized another piece of his soul was in jeopardy right before he blacked out, crumpling to the floor like a sack of flesh and bone. Lucius found him unconscious on the dingy carpet and levitated him into a freshly made bed where he remained for days before he had the strength to rise. To eat. To bathe. The smallest of actions causing a wave of pain to ripple from his sternum to each of his extremities.
“Though we’ve always known.” George said with a conspirator’s wink.
“Hermione!” yelped Ron.
“You will see.” Luna said mysteriously rising to a sitting position, completely unoffended by Pansy’s skepticism and Pansy refrained from scoffing, as was her habit, to be polite. Instead, she asked about Granger.
She slipped it around the boy, smoothing the unseen material into place. “Hurry back dear boy.” Narcissa ordered. She softened the demand with an impromptu kiss to his temple, surprising both the Gryffindors. “before my son worries himself to despair.”
“Interesting.” Mused Fred.
“Draco, dear, come sit.” Narcissa patted the plush sofa, smoothing the crushed fabric with her capable manicured hands.
Harry protested with widened miserable eyes. “We must help them!” he demanded with all the sanctimonious self-righteous and indignant emphasis that grated on Severus’s nerves. Snape’s gaze hardened at the display to pin the boy in place before he could fly off half-cocked to rally the troops.
“That won’t be necessary.” Luna’s airy voice informed her in a whisper. “There is no danger here.”
“You are a smart wizard, Lucius, I’m sure you already know.” Done with his theatrics, Narcissa turned back to her letters.
The thing was… Harry knew he was safe. He did not know how he knew. It wasn’t like Divination had taught him anything. And he had not picked up Luna’s
“What are you talking about?” The clueless boy asked.
down his spine.
“With such a severely deplete magical core, you would be causing more damage.” She instructed firmly. Her dark berry lips thinned at the thought.
The first two days, Harry had done as Snape had suggested and slept. For the most part. His body was unaccustomed to such rest and he had to fight the impulse to jump up and just… do something. Anything. Lady Malfoy suggested, when the impulse was too strong, he should concentrate on his breathing. And doing so was dull enough for the exhaustion to catch up to him, sending Harry into a deep slumber for several hours until he woke up and started all over again. He was enjoying the sleep especially when night came, with Draco’s warm body and light snoring, Harry found his nightmares suspiciously absent.
“Oh no.” he sassed “we wouldn’t want that!”
“Professor Snape gave Harry and I a project to work on. For extra credit.” Draco lied.
the loneliness and fear in the other girl’s aura so Luna had taken both girls to her room and offered for Pansy and Hermione to stay.
“I can’t.” Hermione cried out. This was all just too much. “I can’t just abandon my friends! Or my education! Oh! You just wouldn’t understand!”
. Pott…
this popped out faster than expected on accident. I might still post a smaller chapter on Sunday.
“Cissssa.” Lucius, fury all over his face, hissed her name as if saying it calmly or rationally was shameful. His blue eyes were narrowed with burning red rims and his blonde hair, always so perfectly straight was tangled unlike she had ever seen. “What is the meaning of this?”
It was grander than the Great Hall with high ceilings and floating chandeliers, each lit like the students were honored guests. The House Elves had laid out a feast for the teenagers. Luna was the first to dive into her sticky toffee pudding out of the bone fine, gold embellished dish. Harry winced when a crumb found its way onto the magically white linens. Luna sent him an ethereal smile, the kind where he
Harry longed to sit next to Draco. To feel his body heat. The strength. The
“I’ll walk you back to your tower.” Draco said before Harry could ask him. Pansy cooed at the two, teasing without malice. As a whole, the Slytherin table had been decent to Harry. Nosy but decent. Never once was he called a liar or a coward or a ponce. It was the smoothest meal Harry had experienced in a long time.
Without a second thought, Harry showed them the first wordless, wandless spell he had mastered. The orb of light grew in his palm casting shadows on all their faces. Harry let it grow, then changed the color from pale yellow to a light shimmery blue. He held his breath as it died out slow and purposefully until with a bit of mischief, he threw the orb into the air to watch it explode into a chaotic shower of smaller beams of light.
“And you, Mr. Weasley, will be sure to keep your hands off other students as well. Detention tomorrow night for physically removing Ms. Granger from her seat without her explicit permission.”
“No. I mean yes. It’s just…” he trailed off as he was prone to do. A bad habit she was intent on rectifying.
“Delightful.” She exclaimed.
“I see.” Harry said slowly, trying not to let out his latent temper. A million thoughts flooded his brain overwhelming the need to say anything at all.
of his wiggling growing under his thighs.
“I’m not going to lie to you, Little One. I am not the most patient of people. But if the past five years of animosity has not pushed me away then I doubt much else will.” Draco shifted his bulk, once again leaning over Harry’s chest, peering down at him.
Luna had tuned the others out. She wasn’t prone to panic with the
“Harry’s injuries are healed, however,” she continued with a worried frown, “he is experiencing pain.”
. Harry, after all, was nothing but trouble.
Draco’s mother sighed, plopping back down on the couch and slumping, inelegantly, back into the cushions. “That man wears me out.” She admitted. Out loud. Draco could only gape at her, completely scandalized.
Draco came back to bed and stood looking down at Harry with a sleepy smile. Harry watched him with tension. He kept his mouth shut afraid he might betray his thoughts if he said anything. Draco cocked his head to one side, a question on his handsome face. Harry had no answers. He waited, holding his breath, and desperately thinking about other things instead of Draco’s slightly parted lips and glass cutting cheekbones and the way his Adam’s apple bobbed when he swallowed. And he absolutely did not look below his clavicle.
“Yeah.” Harry agreed sheepishly. “He accused me of being in Voldemort’s pocket last night. As if I would side with the man who killed my parents.”
“That would be a no.” Harry said, face smushed against Draco’s sweaty neck.
“Is it possible to be assigned to another dorm room, Professor?” he finally asked, again adding a hasty “Please,” in case her human form was like her Animagus one. McGonagall began shaking her gray coiled bun before he finished. “Please, Professor.” He pleaded, interrupting before she could speak. “I haven’t slept in days.”
&&&&&
The frustration bloodied Draco’s high cheekbones, staining them red just as his eyes narrowed. “As I said, Parkinson, I. don’t. Know.”
“Ms. Granger!” exclaimed a fast-approaching Professor Snape.
“Harry,” she held out one pale perfectly manicured hand for him to take. “This way please.”
“I don’t know, Panse. He’s hurt worse than we thought.” Draco admitted. “I think he’s scared.”
“And there is this thing. A potion.” He added. “Snape makes good potion.” Harry paused gauging her reaction. When she only looked on curiously, he continued. “It’s called the Unburdening. Works as a pain reliever but there are some… side effects.”
“Draco, I think this important.” Hermione said, leaning forward in her seat. Everyone knew how little she valued Divination. Her interest yielded his reluctance.
“Leaving would be suicide.” Pansy muttered darkly when she opened her dorm room door to see an empty hall. Draco snorted beneath the invisibility cloak and gently pushed their way inside. Like Blaise, Pansy had been told what was going on during the desperate race to fire call Draco’s mother. Pansy had been the one to console Harry before the Gryffindor finally lost control of the Unburdening. She had a soft spot for the boy-who-captured-all-their-hearts. He was adorable and sweet and so very
“I just… just…” Harry could not find the words. His emotions were caught up, captured in the back of his voice box. Draco putting any amount of distance between them was the

“Are you questioning my authority, missy?” Professor Umbridge implored, cocking her head to the side like a curious, heinous little kitten. Hermione felt a violence rage up inside. She palmed the quill as if it were a dagger.
“I should have realized.” Narcissa Malfoy said, baffled and besieged with guilt. “I only checked for physical damage. Honestly, I have no idea who you are even standing up.”
“Indeed.” Narcissa said behind rattled teeth. She raised her brows at his audacity. “breaking them should not be a new experience for you then.”
in the last few days was not lost on the Malfoy heir.
“Three days ago, we could hardly stand in the same room together.” Harry said flatly with a little inelegant snort.
“I take it this is part of the side effects?” she mused with pursed lips. Harry found his cheeks hot, burning with embarrassment. He had no idea why.
… but I will try to be whatever you need me to be.” Draco’s sincerity was like another warm blanket.

locking charms on the door. No one dared to question her caution and Luna felt comforted by the fact that Pansy had included her and Hermione in her vigilance.
“Hermione, can you just stop arguing and let me keep you safe?” Harry blurted out, huffing, and blowing his unruly hair off his face since both of his hands were occupied.
After they were dressed, Draco handed Harry a Nutrition Potion from the chest Snape had provided. It set atop Draco’s dresser like an impromptu apothecary. Harry eyed it curiously but otherwise wished for Draco to remain in charge of its contents.
Spoils of War (or: Harry Potter gets spoiled [as he should]): Remedies or just an excuse to Read?
So basically, par for the course that was Harry’s life. He held back from rolling his eyes out of respect for her and her expertise. Mostly because Harry felt extremely lucky Lady Malfoy was willing to share her knowledge with him. And her home. He did not deserve either. Uncle Vernon’s lesson about freaks using the furniture reverberated in his head on the way to the spacious dining room.
.  “I am not used to sharing my bed.” Draco admitted a tad sheepish.
“Narcissa…” Lucius interrupted.
“What about expulsion?” Hermione hated that her voice trembled like her hands.
Chapter one:
Harry shot her a mischievous grin. “Now I know where he gets it from.” The imp said before disappearing entirely.

“I will always accept you Harry. You’re my friend.” Hermione gently held both of his hands, taking care not to jostle his bandaged one. “You must be smelling my shampoo.” She speculated. “And you’re exhausted. Why are you not in bed? Have you been to the infirmary? This bandaging was done well.” She rambled, inspecting his hand with delicate fingers.
“Your mother says my magic core is empty.” Harry said in a dull flat voice. Magic had been his saving grace and now, Lady Malfoy was saying his gift was gone.
Harry awoke the next morning feeling refreshed. More so than he had expected, what with the fleeing into the morning light and the sharing of a bed with a boy he had previously only thought of as “prat” and “git” rather than “friend”. Much less the
“Professor Umbridge was siphoning Harry’s magic.” She told Severus firmly, daring him to argue. “I’m surprised he is even able to walk much less cast a spell. I am…” she paused, “hesitant to test his abilities.”
“Yeah.” Harry said, small and quiet, remembering the powerless rage he had endured during Marge’s tirade before magic exploded out of him.
Though, Draco recalled Hermione’s school record. And her wicked right cross. He concluded both girls could take care of themselves. Harry’s worries were unfounded. A personality trait, Draco suspected. A weakness, he had once thought. Now, the Slytherin was not so sure. He marveled at Harry’s ability to care about any person at all with how often he had been betrayed.
“Oh Harry!” Hermione exclaimed. “You should have sent for me right away.”
“Thank you, Fred.” She patted the muscly forearm absently yet appreciatively.
“I won’t let him hurt you.” Draco promised. His storm gray eyes were trained on Ron, unblinkingly focused. Harry nodded.
“This would be the Weasley twins?” Narcissa arched her smooth blonde brow.
“Now, now,” the other one said, and she was pretty sure he was Fred. “none of that.” He admonished wiping a tear off her cheek. She had not even been aware she was crying.
“That’s my line.” Hermione laughed. No one commented on the tears they could hear in her voice. “Please be careful.” She cautioned. “Let Draco help.” She did demand with conviction.
“50 points from Gryffindor.” Snape intervened before the twins could anything more than growl menacingly.
“Whyyyyyy.” Harry whined forlornly when his arms trembled with the effort to lift the water to his lips. And his hand was on absolute fire sitting limp in his lap. Even breathing hurt with his ribs protesting each inhale, each exhale.
Fingers crossing
“Why?” Harry did not mean to pout. He hated the idea of not having access to the greatest (and worst) thing that had ever happened to him.
“Harsh.” Harry had pointed out with no heat and slipped the thing over his head before Draco could yank the offending garment out of his hands. An action he was now regretting. He wanted to feel the cool of Draco’s silk sheets on his skin again. They had felt so nice… so decadent. He debated shimmying out of the tee before discarding the idea. Harry did not want to wake Draco. The other boy had knocked out flat on his stomach as soon as Harry settled into bed. Draco had latched onto his wrist like a manacle of flesh. His grip was loose enough for Harry to disengage anytime he wished. He did not wish. The feel of Draco intentional touch was thrilling, sending flickers of
Allies and Enemies 8: The Twins
“I’m glad you told me Harry.” She sniffled. “Drink this.” Hermione said, holding a gray metal canister. The kind muggles use to camp. “Drink as much as you like, it’s charmed to never run out.”
Draco, true to his word, had not abandoned Harry. He had even come to his defense with a new calmer approach. Completely different then just a few hours earlier. It was mind boggling. Just as watching Draco build Harry a plate of food was outside of the realm of reasonable possibilities. The world had become even stranger than when Harry had been told he was a wizard. Harry, in a moment of insight, decided everyone else could go stuff it. Draco was way more interesting than the nosy student body and the ominous teaching staff. Even when he was being bossy.
“Easy there little one.” Draco warned playfully. “Before you embarrass us both.” But it was too late. Harry could feel the
“Of course, ‘Mione.” Harry replied with the sweetest reassuring smile. “You can’t get rid of me that easily.”
A soft cliffhanger
Harry wanted to believe her. To trust. It always came down to trust. Harry dropped his gaze back to the floor, unable to look her in the eye when he could not take her at her word. She should not make promises she could not keep.
“Are you always this handsy?” Hermione asked objectively. She was looking at the pair of them up and down, like they were one of Luna’s invisible mystical creatures. She did not look impressed. Draco shrugged in response instead of bristling. He did not pull away, much to Harry’s surprise.
“Harry.” Luna, fully cloaked and waiting outside of Ravenclaw territory, said with her breathy light voice. “You should rest before we leave. No one will be by here for a few minutes.” Harry understood not to question how she knew or why she was prepared.
“You’re an arsehole.” Harry said calmly, unbandaged hand clutching his forehead.
So very, very bored.
“Oh dear.” She fluttered a hand to her chest. Harry finally noticed she was out of her school robes, wearing a white pearl buttoned blouse and crisp gray wide leg trousers.
“New developments, I see.” Said Fred.
“Harry’s magical core is nearly depleted.” She flicked her eyes back to the boy and then again to Severus.
“I believe you might want privacy. There are some hard questions that require answers young man.” She warned him just shy of stern.
“Will not reflect any choices you have made. My son will find his own destiny. I will support him, and his decisions and you will have no say in the matter.” Narcissa flared her power at her husband, something she was never prone to do in all the years they had been married. It shone in her eyes, as gray and stormy as her son’s could ever be. Lucius gasped at the quiet display and took a step back. Good, she had his full attention. “You will also destroy that nasty bit of parchment you had drawn up after your conversation with Draco at the end of summer.”
“Harry.” Lady Malfoy said his name softly on a sob, which in his opinion, was worse than Uncle Vernon’s fist. “Harry Potter look at me.” She demanded in a tone that broke no argument. Again, Harry could only obey. Not because of any compulsions or spells, but because he naturally wanted to
“Who doesn’t?” Fred Weasley said jovially and with an exaggerated hazel wink. He plopped down on one side of Hermione.
“Fineeee.” Harry slurred into his pillow as he snuggled back into Draco like a kitten demanding snuggles. Draco stifled his groan when the movement elicited
Snape POV
Narcissa held herself perfectly still, not saying anything until she was sure her surprise and subsequent fury would not be present in her tone. Of course. It made perfect sense. If the Dursleys could not provide basic needs and a safe environment for young Harry, it proved they would not provide adequate eyewear for the boy.
“Maybe you didn’t feel the need to ‘Unburden’ to a table full of strangers.”
Hermione finds Harry in the Gryffindor common room.
Harry Potter was his final Horcrux.
Harry straightened away from Draco’s warmth, reluctantly. “I can stand on my own.” He assured the other boy. Draco sneered at Hermione, all the while gently easing Harry back under his arm. Harry did not resist, too comforted by Draco’s presence.
“Not the first time I’ve heard that.” Harry scoffed mostly to himself running shaking fingers through his short hair. “What does this mean?” he asked her, completely unaware he was squeezing Draco’s hand. Lady Malfoy gave him a look reminiscent of Professor McGonagall. Baffled and amused with a hint of reproach. She ran the spell again, twisting her wrist this way and that. Frowning at what she saw in his aura.
“Awwwwww, lookit that blush Forge.” Fred said.
“No, my Dragon, his pain may seem centered there but, his ribs are fully healed.” She assured him. “This is the reason blood quills were banned. They can be charmed to act as a siphon. The user essentially being drained of magic with extreme side effects. The worst case becoming a squib. I did not even think…” Lady Malfoy trailed off, her porcelain skin flaring red high on her cheekbones. “… to use one on a child.” She finished, horrified.
“Yes, Pansy.” Draco lazily agreed, staring Harry dead on. “A regular kitten.”
Narcissa’s mouth pursed as she watched the poorly hidden animosity play out. “Thank you for coming Severus. Did you have any trouble?” She latched her gaze onto his profile like a lifeline, watching for a lead into how to proceed. Severus basked under her undivided attention even as he strained to keep Pott… Harry’s pale little face trained on him.
“Please Ron, I’m hungry.” Harry urged with a whisper. Hoping against hope his friend would drop the dramatics. A confrontation was low on Harry’s list of priorities.
“Gross.” Harry muttered darkly, renewing his efforts to move away.
“To be fair,” Said Hermione, a little dizzy from the twin speak. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to get out of that.”
“Harry.” Neville, unsurprised, groaned.
Harry’s head. “I do not like not knowing.” He continued petulantly reminiscent of a younger Draco. Harry looked up at him in the dim light and could barely make out the glint of stormy gray eyes. It was too much, Harry quickly buried his head back down, rubbing his nose on the soft skin near Draco’s pebbled nipple.
“He had been detained by mysterious circumstances.” Snarked his brother.
“Ok. Harry.” She acquiesced, following him without protest to the other side.
To fret.
What would it be like to hug someone without fear of being stabbed in the back? Or pushed away? Pansy was not sure which scenario would be worse. She shrugged off her contemplation by blatantly cracking her neck and rounding up the Gryffindor duo, a budding seer and her snake brethren. “Draco,” she half whined. “I’m starved.”
“No Mother, I am not.” Draco addressed her while staring at Harry with soft stormy eyes. “I am upset by the Gryffindor Martyr Mentality.” He clipped in explanation as Harry dropped his eyes back down to the floor. Narcissa could hardly believe how the teenager tried to make himself smaller as Draco continued. “Harry seems to think your efforts will be wasteful and unnecessary.” He spat.
“Weasel… er… Weasley…” Draco hastily corrected with an apologetic look when Fred threw a scone at his head. “… is an idiot.”
“I can’t fucking believe you are going to run to McGonagall about this.” Ron yelled. “You fucking coward.” He yelled to Harry’s retreating back.
“Is this true, Harry?” Professor McGonagall’s voice quavered in a strange, strangled way. Harry focused on his perspective, trying to outwit the Unburdening. The goal was to get his weight up. The instructions had come from Lady Malfoy. But… Snape was there. And… Draco was aware. His former nemesis was already invoking a truce by helping him dress and not taking advantage of Harry’s weakened state. Sure, there was no grade involved. Harry would end up with better health. Which could theoretically help him concentrate on his classes thus raising his grades. The conundrum, Draco had nothing to gain.
“You can cast a corporeal Patronus wandless and wordlessly.” Lady Malfoy did not hide her surprise or her delight.
Draco did not understand the
“Get him to
Luna Lovegood woke up slowly, blinking her blue eyes open to be blinded by the dark. She did not panic, instead she used her other senses to take stock of her surroundings, as her mother had taught her; with an open mind which she had learned from her father. The room smelled like wood polish and citrus and the bed beneath her was soft. Luxurious. Which was not a concept she was terribly familiar with. The Hogwarts dormitory beds more akin to castle stone than a cloud. And, while the luxuriousness of her surroundings made her uncomfortable, she
witch of her age.” Luna quoted leaving him to wonder when his friends had become so sassy. First Neville and now Luna?
“Don’t worry Harry,” Draco said conspiratorially. “Morning will come soon.”
Lucky for him, he had safeguards in place. They had also caused him pain. Each separation like a cool blade against his very soul, which was nothing compared to the thought of a never-ending death. His biggest fear. His greatest flaw.
Harry lifted his head slowly. Scared but also hesitant to remove himself from Lady Malfoy’s embrace. She reminded him of Draco. Kind underneath all that Purebred behavior. He smiled at her tremulously. She smiled back at him much the way she looked at Draco. He did not know what to do with that realization, so he pushed it down and sat up a little straighter. Snape was looking at him with a blank parchment face.
“I didn’t hurt her.” Ron argued. He was oblivious to his brothers' glaring eyes. The only thing holding the twins back was Hermione. She had grabbed a hand of each older boy, tugging when they clearly wanted to do some manhandling of their own. To teach their little brother respect. Harry waited with bated breath, appreciating Draco’s solid body. The air was thinning with each tense moment. Snape’s looming presence was a comfort amidst the unresolved hostility hovering at the Slytherin table.
Spoils chapter 5
up next: Voldemort makes an appearance? there might be some kind of plot happening? no one knows.
“The promise,” Narcissa stared into Lucius’s confused face, searching. She did not know what she hoped to find. “was to protect Draco at all costs.” She reminded him, pleased when the angry red faded to a sweaty pallor. Narcissa hated to do it, but at times like these, needs must. “which you have failed to do.”
Outside, the student’s stood as one circling Harry and Narcissa’s brooch. “Portus” Draco said through clenched teeth, bracing for what was about to come. The world spun into a jumble of chaos and noise and Harry as they hurtled through the air until they landed with cacophony of grunts and curses. Draco had kept a tight grip on his… on Harry, as to not let the fragile boy land on the ground. He took the impact of Harry’s body with renewed surprise by how little the other teenager weighed. Draco snuck in a quick hug before pulling Harry to his feet.
Previously: “The blood quill has severely depleted your magical core.” She told him somberly. “You shouldn’t even be alive.”
“It sucks.” Harry admitted, shoving a brussels sprout in his mouth to keep from saying anything else. Soon dinner was over. Harry was glad, he felt ready to drop.
“Yes ma’am.” He took the small serpentine broach with bare pale fingers. Two snakes intertwined in a wreath of silver. Each with emerald eyes. It was the prettiest thing Harry had ever held in his hand.
Draco lifted Harry’s face with one knuckle under his chin. “We can speak of it later.” He promised with a soft kiss directly above the accursed scar. To his surprise, Draco’s lips tingled after for long minutes.
be deliciously cautious. And for the most part, Severus enjoyed the battle of wills even if the brat ruined the fun by letting his temper outweigh his self-preservation. Snape glared back at the brat as per their habit, purposefully ignoring the memory of the tiny broken and hurting boy trembling on his office settee. His feelings may have changed regarding the Potter spawn, but his methods had not.
“Only you.” He teased back finally showing some life. He could not help but smile when she preened at him. “You’re so smart. Why were you not sorted into Ravenclaw?” He asked out of the blue. He also reached out to slide her loose bang behind her ear. “Pretty.”
Harry remained skeptical. The Ministry had instituted Dolores Umbridge into Hogwarts. There was no way they would acknowledge any wrongdoing. They wanted to keep their jobs.
“No.” Harry said more firmly but with a clear plea to be heard. “I’m
in the best of ways. Draco’s slim cut suits had been hiding his new bulk.
“I can assure you, young lady, I do not joke about detention.” Professor Umbridge was not amused by Hermione’s behavior. Her beady little eyes narrowed further. “If you will gather your things and follow me.”
“I can’t take this anymore.” Draco announced as he cancelled the silencing bubble. “Why are you freaking out?” He asked Harry, turning the smaller boy’s attention.
Harry has a conversation with McGonagall, it goes about as well as expected
“You have not idea.” The girl said emphatically.
Harry calmed down significantly after hearing it, even allowing Draco to pull him close to join the call. Her son always had been prone to cuddling. Narcissa was glad Lucius’s influence had not drummed the instinct out. Her son deserved whatever happiness he could find in this mad, dark world.
“You may return when you have proven yourself worthy of the property.” Narcissa paused. “Or reached enlightenment. Honestly, the goblinspeak gets a little wordy.”
“Where did you learn to do that?” Draco asked sounding equal parts scandalized and impressed.
“Mr. Potter!” His Head of House rose her voice in surprise. “A request of that nature,” she paused scanning him from head to toe. “Is there something more I should know?”
“I do hope he is careful.” Miss Granger said to no one in particular.
Draco’s turn
“Are you not aware of how gifted you are?” Lady Malfoy asked in a near whisper.
“My mother is different.” Draco said kindly. “You should tell Snape about this. He will want to catalog the side-effects when he takes it on the market.
“Yeah.” Harry agreed. He gave her the password to enter. She harrumped, clearly annoyed but swung open to let him through.
Harry was a light bundle of “oomph” when he barreled into Draco with a complete lack of grace. His thin arms like bands under Draco’s armpits, cold nose pressed firmly into Draco’s sternum blatantly inhaling his scent. Luckily, Draco had enough grace for both and caught the smaller boy before any damage could occur.
Harry gets his second dose of Unburdening. A truce is called.
“Apologies, Godfather.” Draco said respectfully.
Draco was no help, silently watching the struggle with a quirked brow. He was close enough for Harry to see the clenching of his mandibles, to feel his body heat. Harry was surprised to feel warmth. He had always viewed Draco Malfoy as cold. Like Ice. Maybe it was the hair.
“Oh.” Lady Malfoy said with genteel surprise. “I’m sorry, Harry.” She apologized with a worried frown and no other explanations.
Next chapter should be done by late Sunday
“And no one wants to cross McGonagall.” The twins said in unison. Harry nodded in agreement refusing to meet anyone’s eye. Draco lifted the stubborn chin with a pale finger, eyes boring into the lowered lids until finally, with great reluctance, Harry’s green orbs stared back. They were full of a swirling mess of emotions. Draco wished he had already mastered Legilimency. He wanted to push as hard and relentless as it took until he extracted each and every thought of the trembling young boy.
“Could you…” Draco began, to convince her to wake someone up to get Harry, but the portrait squeaked in surprise and swung open revealing a disheveled Hermione Granger dragging a bleary eyed and grimacing boy-who-lived-to-be-adorable. Harry stumbled right into Draco’s arms immediately soothing the apprehension away. The turbulent noise replaced by a quiet calm. With Harry in reach, Draco acknowledged the weight of his new need to be so near the other boy and waved it away. This was not a burden to Draco. Strange yes, but not a burden.
“You’re vexing me, witch.” He snarled. “what does that have anything to do with what you are about to bring down upon our heads?”
she could
“Why?” Pansy demanded. Her chocolate eyes were laser beams trying to dissect him.
Lying in bed with his companion, safe and warm, he should have been drifting off like Harry. Instead, Draco was keyed up and
“I see.” Professor Umbridge tsked. “Well, that certainly changes things.” Hermione found herself face to face with Dolores Umbridge's short Birchwood wand. “One simple little Forgetfulness charm and no harm done.”
against Draco. “Don’t worry. I’m a fast learner.”
“Please, Severus, call me Narcissa.” Lady Malfoy sat on the sofa next to Harry, her skirt touching his skinny thigh even though there was enough room for three people on the furniture. She gestured for Snape to take her matching desk chair, her smile was secret and small before her visage turned grave. “The blood quill did more damage than we thought.”
Harry slowly made his way to Gryffindor Tower. The corridors were occupied with Umbridge’s Inquisitorial squad, even with the lateness of the hour. Harry did his best to stay quiet and
“Pretty.” Narcissa commented, clearly impressed, and struggling to not clap with giddy delight. She reformed her raised brows and gave Harry and admonishing squeeze. “And exactly what I meant by refraining from using magic.” She reprimanded, sounding so much like Professor Snape, Harry had to check the corners of the room to see if the man was
“It should not be necessary.” She clarified. “You have three days to pack any belongings you require. The house elves have been instructed to assist. After 3 day, mother magic will invoke her right and you will be forcibly removed from the premises.”
When Harry awoke the next morning, it was clear the Unburdoning had worn off. The groan he let out was involuntary and unwelcome.
Harry rushed down the steps, dizzy with the effort. The pain was growing. His dose of the Unburdening wearing off leaving him gasping for each breath. Harry grit his teeth and cast a wordless, wandless Silencio. There was no time to linger. Fetching Neville had taken the better part of an hour.
“What?” Draco’s voice rose an octave. “Mother? Because of his ribs?” He asked guiltily.
“Oh good, you’re both up.” Narcissa Malfoy said when she spied her visitors hovering outside her office. The two boys were complete dichotomies of the other. One stood tall like his father, body flirting with adulthood. Draco was blond and confident, almost bordering on arrogant. Her son was handsome, resembling the fae of old. Harry, on the other hand was dark and pretty. Small of stature, and, if she did not know any better, rather timid compared to the stories she had heard of his exploits over the years.
“Well yes, he would have.” Hermione acknowledge trying not to make eye contact and lose her train of thought.
“You have broken your vows.” Narcissa reminded him coldly. “I can assure you it’s all perfectly legal. The manor is still yours. And will remain yours until your inevitable demise. After which, Draco will inherit.”
“With all your… extra-curricular activities.” Snape’s sneer held no malice. “You should welcome the vacation.”
“Harry, look at me.” Narcissa told him when she could trust her voice again. She waited until those emerald eyes were fixed solely on her and smiled reassuringly. “Thank you for coming to me with this.” She said first because she knew it had to be hard for him with his background and absolute lack of self-esteem. This was progress and
“Where, if I may inquire, are your new… house guests?” Severus asked, ignoring the delightfully seething boy, “And Draco?”
“It’s fine.” He whispered, surprised to say it.
“You need actual rest.” Snape explained more fully with a kindness that was rare to see. Draco idly wondered what had transpired before he arrived to illicit such a behavior from the usually snappish wizard. Hopefully, Harry would tell him later. “The more sleep, the better.” Snape said.
Draco needed to keep Harry’s prize possession safe just as he felt the need to keep the boy safe. Added to all that, the bulk of the three silent nearly full-grown teenagers made maneuvering down the castle corridors tricky. Then there was the distance from the dungeons to the seventh story walk up on the other side of Hogwarts, their travel time took longer than previous two trips combined. Still, they arrived just after 5 a.m. with plenty of time to rest before entering the tunnels which lead to Hog’s Head Tavern.
, which was such an alien feeling he wondered if he was not in a parallel universe. Accepting magic as real was less disconcerting than the change in their relationship. Not that Harry felt the need to fight it. He was full on
“It sure feels like it.” She whispered.
Now… healing magics… that was more her style. That and Herbology. Neville had proved quite the delight bringing her new methods to cultivate the rare (read: deadly) garden. He was positively gleeful to have access to the more delicately dangerous plants in her greenhouse and fearless when it came to diving into investigating their properties firsthand. Plants he would not have access to at Hogwarts. He had been so excited to dig in Narcissa had to remind the boy to don his dragonhide gloves on more than one occasion.
“That’s bullshit.” Pansy declared.
“Fled Hogwarts?”
“I know your relationship with Mr. Weasley is… rocky.” Professor McGonagall’s brogue was laced with compassion. Understanding. “This does not constitute a need for reassignment.”
Draco did not hesitate to enter as he had spent many hours with Snape after class. Learning. Observing. And absolutely not touching anything after the first accidental dose of Alihotsy Draught. Hysterical laughter was not a state Draco preferred. Quite the opposite, in fact. Why anyone would brew the damn thing, Draco would never know.
beyond his current capabilities.
Severus frowned with no answer. Draco watches as a duel of eyebrows commenced between his mother and his godfather before Severus frowned fiercely at Narcissa. “Harry should rest for the next few days and then he can continue his studies with theory until he is strong enough for practical applications.” The Potion Master said.
“If it weren’t true, I’d demand you take that back.” Harry responded, too sleepy to take real offense. Pansy openly laughed.
Draco scowled briefly before turning the full force of his attention on Hermione. “My mother will be meeting you on the far side of Hogsmeade. There is a small cottage with blue shutters. You must stay hidden the whole way. Harry will go with you.” Draco spit out. “against my better judgement.”
“I missed you too.” Harry said shyly before he caught Narcissa’s eye. She nodded to him and gestured to the empty seat next to her on the sofa. Harry rushed over after disengaging from his friend.
“Harry’s clothing is… hostage.” She said hesitantly. Her pretty brown eyes were darting around the corridor before landing on Draco. Harry could practically see her apply steel to spine. His poor friend had no idea how to deal with an enemy turned ally. “No. I don’t.” Hermione admitted to Harry. “I’ll have to follow your lead in this Harry.” She smirked, waving a hand to where he was still
“Mr. Potter, please, try to stay out of trouble.” She said with hesitation.
He found out later, much later, Lucius had devised a plan to bring him back. Really, it had been the only thing to save Lord Malfoy from an untimely death. Doubly, it proved all along Lucius had been a faithful servant. More faithful than Pettigrew and his simpering fear-based pandering. And when Voldemort learned it was the boy to destroy his soul piece? Well, honestly, it was only fitting. The boy was proving his mettle just as he was ensuring his ultimate demise. The Dark Lord could only admire a boy so adept to surviving, wasn’t that exactly what he had done himself? And to defeat a fully grown Basilisk at a mere 12 years? Astounding. It was clear why the Potter brat was marked as his
“Hmmghhm” Professor Umbridge cleared her throat to gain Hermione’s attention. “Perhaps, we could travel at a speed faster than a snail.” She said helpfully in the most threatening of ways.
“Does this mean you’ll be a part of Dumbledore’s army?”
“Where is Ron?” Neville asked out of the blue.
“Yes Ma’am.” Harry said all the while wondering why he was always so damned obedient.
“Harry, I know my son.” Lady Malfoy said indulgently.
Having been close to her sister for nearly two decades before the most unfortunate of circumstance, Narcissa knew when her sister was acting cagey. “Dromeda, this is important.” Hopefully, her older sister had learned some wisdom during her time away from the Black family. “You might not know of his exact location, but your daughter may.”
still i hope you like.
“Yes.” Harry answered, rubbing his arms to chase away the tingling.
“I just wanted to talk!” Ron whined in a wail. Harry almost felt sorry for him. The feeling was short-lived when Ron continued. “Now, I don’t even know why. Malfoy was right about one thing. You are a filthy mudblood with no manners.” He spat; his freckled face was distorted in rage.
“Expelliarmus!” forcefully enough to knock the pink toad backward and over her chair.
“You were saying.” Hermione rallied. After all, knowledge was power. For the first time since learning she was a witch, Hermione felt powerless. Even after all the adventures as one third of the Golden Trio. Umbridge’s insidious control over the school terrified Hermione. Her heart was still racing, and her brain felt clogged with residual fear.
It took all of Pansy’s will to hold in a gasp. She did not gasp. This was not some turn of the century muggle gothic novel. She was a Slytherin tried and true even if her stomach was doing flips and her heart was fluttering in her throat. To siphon’s another person’s magic was the darkest of dark. The amount of power one could gain… Well, for the world’s sake Pansy hoped such a device would never land in the hands of her father. He would burn the world for more power.
Allies and Enemies 6:
Harry would know what to do.
Before Ron could erupt again, Harry peaked around the unmoving Draco. “I’m really, very hungry.” he blurted out, enjoying the way his head of house’s mouth hung slack and surprised. Harry, as close as he was, felt more than heard Draco huff out a laugh. Harry caught sight of his friend and went back to the position between Draco’s shoulder blades. Ron’s angry face was just too much to bear. Harry recognized the stubborn, unreasonable freckled set of features having seen them far too often. Once again, Harry had somehow betrayed his friend.
“Oh!” he gasped in surprise, equal parts fascinated and disgusted.
Perhaps it was a trick of the soot, a shifting in the ash making her older sister’s sharp angled face soften. Narcissa would not know. “I have to go, Cissa.” Dromeda announced. “It was nice to hear from you after all this time.” With that, the fire-call ended. On a better note than expected. No one flung veiled insults. And her sister never refused to help. A blossom of hope bloomed in Narcissa’s heart.
It had been three days.
“Must be nice.” Harry sassed unable to see anything other than light and dark and shapes.
“I can assure you Mr. Potter, the student body is more than ok with the present situation. Those prone to… frivolous behavior are partaking in merry making and those more dedicated to their studies are taking the time to
“You can’t stay here.” Said Definitely George.
.” Harry stressed the word. He could not even begin to describe the chasm of emotion he refused to acknowledge. “If a resorting is not possible, I will find another way.” He assured her with a mask of confidence built from years of having his life in danger.
Narcissa knew now she had been a fool for believing she had found love with her husband. He would never love anything more than his power and influence. Maybe for a time he had loved her. that was all in the past now. Lucius was slowly going mad. Slow enough, Narcissa had not seen the signs until it was nearly too late. She was unwilling to allow Lucius’s madness to spill over onto her son.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Harry asked curiously.
this is long and unedited (as usual)
. In spite of the permanent blush on his face.
I'm actual facts worried I'm going to lose some readers over this but this is what my brain did and there is no going back now because the whole story is written (scribbled) in the notebook and to change it now would probably kill my own soul a little so... here it is.
Sharing a bed with another human being was… hot, and not in the sexy way. Harry felt damp with sweat and thirsty for a cool glass of water. Still, the rise and fall of Draco’s chest was how Harry imagined swimming in the ocean felt. And the warm skin beneath his fingertips was like silk with Draco’s heartbeat was a strong and steady, unlike Harry’s own, which always threatened to race or skip or stop with each new adventure.
Harry Potter was miserable. And on top of that misery was disgust. At himself. A great river of revulsion roaring along his veins. Hot and bothersome boiling and burning him from the inside out. The Dursleys had been right labeling him a freak at such a young age. They would be positively gleeful if they knew exactly how far his abnormalities extended. How could anyone bare to look at him? Much less
types of looks on the Malfoy faces. The horrified ones. It was best they truly know Harry as the total abomination he was now.
“Brilliant,” Harry smiled at her when his thirst was quenched by cool clean water. He giggled, pleased when she blushed at the compliment. “What are you thinking?” He asked a little more soberly.
Harry said nothing and the whole room could hear his stubborn refusal to take the Potion. A moment passed before the tense shoulder under Draco’s warm palm, released and Harry lifted his head to nod to Snape.
“Contrary to popular belief, I do know how to share.” Draco said dryly. Harry gave him a dubious look. In the end, he needed to jump to get into the bed. He was all awkward limbs and blushes while Draco helped him get settled beneath the covers. Draco joined him, ignoring the squawking when Harry was made the small spoon.
Some more Narcissa and Harry
The Slytherin groaned, loud and long and frustrated. “Still not a freak, Little One.” He stressed behind his teeth in a hiss. Harry would have bolted if it were not for Draco’s gentle caressing (read: petting) hand. Instead of running, his breathing sped up just as he tried to stay very, very still.
“We would.” Harry said before sharply shutting his mouth. He would not look her in the eye. Draco sighed dramatically.
. And that knowledge was devastating.
Draco fortified his mind against the influence of that small mean voice of pride. His heart, aching to cross whatever invisible, undefined chasm Harry had dug, was louder and stronger than ever.
“I won’t be rescinding the offer anytime soon.” Draco assured him. Harry hummed happily distracted only to have their little bubble broken by a thundering crack and a cacophony of yelling.
Harry agreed. The time had come to recognize, Ron was not a very good friend.
“Draco I cannot eat like this.” Harry tried using logic. The Malfoys were fans of logic. To which Draco countered by popping a square of cheese in his protesting mouth. Which defied all logic. It seemed Harry could eat like that.
No. He did not want to continue this type of existence. This unforeseen side effect of his beloved Horcruxes was most unwelcome. As was the lack of knowledge about soul magic. There were very few books on the subject and even the ones he had accessed were so old and crumbling he doubted their authenticity. Since his reign of terror, the darker books were banned and, in some cases, destroyed. Which was ignorant because dark did not necessarily mean evil. Most blood magic was considered dark just as it was best utilized to heal and not hurt.
Ron got the hint. He shut his mouth and lowered his arrogant stance. Professor Snape said nothing, nor did he move until Ron made his way over to the Gryffindor table. Harry let out his breath only to hold it once again when Ron caught his eye. There was only malice, no glimmer of their former friendship, and it pierced Harry deep. Deeper than he ever thought possible.
Harry was not buying their protests. A deep soaking tiredness penetrated his bones. He felt more than tired, he felt weary. And hungry. And his ribs (but not his ribs because they were healed) still ached deep inside. Harry nodded at Lady Malfoy while she stared him down. Not as an agreement to what she said, more as an acknowledgement that he had heard her even if he did disagree.
Professor McGonagall thinned her lips, the skin above them turning white with the effort. “A resorting requires the Headmaster’s authority. You well know he is indisposed at this time. Do you think the current atmosphere is the right time to be… jumping ship?” she clipped the words in a way he had only ever heard toward the most delinquent.
“Very true.” Harry agreed trying to ignore the way his hands shook and his weak knees.
“Revelio.” Narcissa cast with a whisper. She pointed her wand toward the approaching invisible persons, who clearly needed more lessons on
“You cannot do this!” Lucius cried out grasping his wife’s arms and shaking her like she was some kind of frail thing to behold. “I have made promises!”
“They are necessary for travel.” She told him enigmatically.
(and now chapter nine: a daring rescue)
“Damn.” Harry cursed. “At least I didn’t say anything too embarrassing.”
Draco shook his head amusement littered his smile. “Good night, Potter.”
Which did nothing to appease the worry. And really just
“Be careful there.” Snape warned ominously. “Your mother will not mind, but your father…”
“Ah.” Severus said with new understanding. Something had occurred between the two boys. A stow over from their days of opposition. “And Harry,” he addressed the name politely with a less derisive sneer now that he had accomplished his mission. “How are your injuries?”
Sometime during the night one or both of them had yanked that ratty old tee shirt off of Harry in a flurry of strong limbs and grumbling protest. The thing disappeared into the dark cave of the room. And, unbeknownst to the boys, was retrieved by a house elf to be burned with the refuse. It would not be missed.
“I have clothes.” Harry protested.
Rage. Red blind rage. The breathtaking mind-numbing kind. Rage that Harry truly believed he was a freak. The Unburdening prevented him from telling a lie, so Harry had to believe to his very core. With temper fueled added strength, Draco tore the beloved green sweater off Harry.
Beyond the door was his mother, looking worse for wear, sitting on the sofa he had occupied earlier that very evening. In her lap was a tear-streaked Harry Potter. His jewel toned eyes as wide and ethereal as ever more so with the unshed liquid threatening to spill. Draco stood tall, seemingly impassive to the sight of the smaller, emotionally compromised boy. Less than six months ago, Draco would have given anything to see the Golden Boy of Gryffindor brought so low. And a small part, the part where his pride resided in all of it’s hurt and petulant glory (echoing with Lucius Malfoy’s malicious rhetoric) reveled in the sight.
Pansy turned her attention back to Malfoy. He was studying Harry like he was one of Professor Snape’s newest untested potions. Apprehension mixed with a heady amount of glee. Pansy groaned internally. Draco was making her question her justifications for leaving the school and subsequently, her inheritance behind. Her best friend had already fucked up. She did not know how or why but to her, it was pretty clear she was going to have to work to keep him on track with his new companion.
The table was also laid out with roast beef sandwiches, fish and chips, and a charcuterie board of apple slices and cheese which Draco glared at when he wasn’t trying to catch Harry’s eye. Lady Malfoy urged her son to eat his favorite snack only leaving him be when she saw Harry was also not eating.
The Great Escape Round Four
“Did you not almost get expelled for underage magic at the beginning of the year?” Draco asked out of pure curiosity.
“I require a house.”
There was a time she would have given into her husband’s authority. She certainly had when it came to the Dark Lord. She too, believed in the old ways. In propriety. In manners. And the importance of family. It was the discrimination of the muggles and the muggleborns she had not agreed with. The fanaticism so slow in revealing true intentions. The insanity of pureblood lust. And the plot to murder an infant.
“You’re feverish.” Draco said with a worried murmur.
“Yes, well…” clearly Snape had not expected Draco to address him thusly. He had, if fact, expected an argument. Or, at least, an impertinent sneer. When none came his entire thought process halted, however, he rallied quickly. “Harry requires bedrest for the time being. Absolutely no use of magic.” Snape said to his little nemesis firmly.
Harry studied her for a moment out of curiosity, accepting the cup of tea she poured with a murmured “Thanks.” Professor McGonagall stayed cool under his scrutiny. Her austere face was relaxed in her own territory. Harry had a bad feeling he was going to change that.
“Meow.” The painted feline queried. Harry wondered if he was imagining the Scottish burr.
“That you did brother, that you did.” George admitted.
“He stayed.” Harry said while wiping his eyes free of tears with his bandage. Whatever had kept Lady Malfoy in her seat passed. She reached for Harry only to abort the movement when he flinched.
“Where are you going?” Draco mumbled when Harry wiggled out of his arms to go to the bathroom. “’spose to stay in my bed ‘lil one.” He said still half asleep and patting the empty warm sheet.
“Did I scare you?” Harry asked still under the cloak waving the book ghost-like.
Harry felt pressure on his scalp when Draco smoothed a fine boned hand over his unruly dark hair. The sensation sent shivers down his spine just as it was soothing his discordant mind. Harry relaxed into the caress and clung tighter to Draco’s torso. Again, Harry wondered when the other boy had grown so
“Why do you call me that? Little One?” Harry asked too tired to be embarrassed and too awake to not be curious.
Essentially, Harry
“Let me down.” Harry demanded a little frantically. His voice was strangled. Honestly, the whole evening had been a trial of fire burning his face. First with Lady Malfoy and now with his Draco.
“Good Boy.” Draco said quietly, enjoying the shudder that ran through Harry. He was positive the involuntary movement had nothing to do with the cold.
“The light bulb in my cupboard at the Dursley’s went out and they refused to replace it. Some nights it was too… dark to sleep. For a long time, I thought I was imagining it, the way kids do. It made more sense after Hagrid found me.”
Severus was not surprised by the misery drenched all over Harry’s pinched face. He was more concerned as to why the boy was not firmly tucked away in bed. He went as far as to ask Narcissa why Harry was up and about.
Now that she was awake, Luna plotted which was also something unfamiliar to her. With her gifts she had learned to go along with fate and destiny. Things happened, most things beyond her control so Luna had learned to not desire control, instead she could adapt, in her own way, to her surroundings.
“Yeah.” Harry answered honestly. He could always be honest with Neville even without the Unburdening. “Doesn’t matter,” he added quickly when Neville frowned fiercely. And it did not matter. Not when time was a factor. “Grab what you need. We’re getting out of here.” Harry instructed brusquely. Neville stared him down, disbelief and something that looked like anger crossing his uncommonly handsome face. The silence lasted a moment. Long enough for Harry to remember First year and cringe because the Trio had had to stupefy the young Gryffindor.
Narcissa sighed and leveled her husband of 17 years with an unfeeling and impassive stare. “You threatened to disinherit out son.”
“I’ll be quick.” Harry promised. He was stubbornly ignoring their protests. “We have less than 8 hours.” He reminded his companions. “I have the most experience with this.”
“He will not do that,” the blonde waved her hand over to Pansy’s best friend and his captured Gryffindor. “Unless you ask. And only if you ask.” Luna said, alternately vague and informative. Pansy did not ask whom she was speaking of. Luna had her sky-blue eyes trained on her other Slytherin brethren. Blaise Zambini, the quiet, studious,
“I will not oust a boy from his bed this late.” She said adamantly. McGonagall sighed dropping the mask of patience. “Mr. Potter, at your age, I would have thought you had learnt to deal with the problems one in your position faces. You have learnt to navigate the peculiarities of the Wizarding World fairly easily. Young boys and disagreements go hand in hand. You’ll feel differently after a good night’s rest.” She assured him, smiling.
his supposed death in a way that they had never appreciated his life.
Besides, Harry was still in his pajamas, he couldn’t just
“Oh, I bet.” Hermione giggled into her cup.
Allies and Enemies:  A Great Hall Confrontation
“How is he to ever learn to wield the Malfoy name if he always comes running to mommy with every little trivial thing. You do nothing good catering to his every whim, Cissa.”
Harry flushed under her piercing gray gaze. “Yeah.” He answered dutifully. He flushed harder when he found he could not pull his hand away from her grasp. Lady Malfoy flashed him an amused smirk much akin to Draco’s while she slowly, gently finished unwinding his bindings. “It’s my ribs.” He finally answered, mainly to distract from looking at his exposed flesh. He peeked to Lady Malfoy, then to the herringbone inlay in the wood floor. Then to Draco, who was sitting completely still on the sofa not even pretending to read his potion tome. Harry locked eyes with him instead of examining the wound with her. The silence was unnerving and sweat broke out on his brow line. Harry did not want to look until curiosity got the best of him.
“Don’t you want to be healthy?” Draco asked unmaliciously but scowling.
“They are necessary, Narcissa. He must know how to protect his mind if he is going to flourish in the future.”
. Draco realized. He quickly pushed the thought away. He was too tired and too keyed up to make time for that now. Harry was stumbling against Draco very nearly asleep on his feet. The Malfoy Heir would rather concentrate on making sure his former nemesis arrived safely to bed.
The worst of all, this pain was
“So… you do know.” Harry relaxed his spine with the relief. “You look nice.” He added without preamble.
“She wants to spoil you too.” Draco informed him with another shrug. “You should hear her plans to clothe you once you are feeling better. It’s frightening.” The Slytherin said cheerfully.
“Well,” Draco hedged. He eyed her surreptitiously, trying to gauge the words to convince her to let him in. “My friend…” he started.
Round Two:
“I d…” Hermione started to say only to pause and rethink, “thank…” she trailed off again. That was not right either. “Um…” again, the words failed her. She shrugged helplessly before sitting on the ground. The room was empty, only stone and mortar and one lone portrait of a young girl in a maze of gothic hallways not unlike the older parts of the castle.
“You might be a mite confused.” Probably Fred smirked.
Harry was positive he would not be able to sleep no matter how exhausted his mind and body were. But, he enjoyed listening to the screetch of the quill tips and the quiet mutters of his studious friend. It was nice to be able to rely on a friend on a cold dark winter night.
“As if you care about proper.” Harry snarked, wiggling in place.
“Noted.” Draco said cheekily with a jaunty little wave out the door. The corridor portraits were starting to wake up. The castle herself flexing with each slow move of a staircase. The halls were still quiet as the Slytherin navigated his way to Gryffindor Tower. It was not until he arrived, he realized he had no way to get in. Instantly, the anxiety returned.
“Figures I’d be abnormal about this too. Sorry I’m just so… freaky.” Harry apologized.
“My duty is here.” Severus was well versed in Draco’s attempts at manipulation.
Malfoy house elf. Draco dismissed her with a polite “thank you.” Before teasing his companion.
“Feeling weak?” Lady Malfoy asked with a healer’s interest. Harry nodded quickly. “And your ribs are hurting?” Harry nodded
Draco knew better than to react. Still, he could feel his blood rise and pool in his high cheekbones.
“Severus is impressed with their new line of practical jokes. If I’m not mistaken, he is very proud.” The shock on the young witch’s face was enough to have Narcissa hiding her own giggles behind porcelain.
“It’s not your fault.” Harry rushed to say, blatantly ignoring the child remark. He had never felt like a child. Harry shifted forward, reluctantly letting go of Draco’s hand to lean against Lady Malfoy’s lap. He hugged her quickly, letting go lest she take offense. She made a soft coo of a sound, not letting him step away from her own embrace.
“Interesting question, Mr. Potter.” His Professor barked out a laugh in surprise.
Lady Malfoy had a peculiar look on her aristocratic face. Harry could not name it because he did not recognize the gentle caring and motherly concern. Petunia had certainly never sported such a look toward Dudley, much less thrown anything resembling Harry’s way. Only a sick sort of pride to his cousin and a backhanded burning hot skillet to Harry.
A mistake, she could see now.
Mere moments passed before Hermione was seated in the disgustingly pink room, at the delicate little desk with a piece of parchment and a black quill in hand.
“Mate, they aren’t funny if we have to explain.” Said Fred.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mr. Potter, tis barely 9 pm, you are not bothering me, young man. Would you like to come in?” She gestured gregariously beyond the door to a small sitting area on a deep burgundy rug, the tea service already set and steaming.
Fun fact: one week to go until things calm down and then it will be the Holidays and the Crafting extravaganza! I'm excited. Are y'all excited? luckily I have several chapters handwritten just need to keep up the typing. process is progress right?
“This is a surprise.” Andromeda Tonks said in that unnaturally jovial way of muggles. A trait she must have picked up from her husband. The fire-call had been answered immediately by Narcissa’s older sister even though over twenty years had passed since they last talked.
Getting out of the Tower was easy. The trek back to the Room of Requirement less so. Neville was very uncomfortable with the lack of personal space while Harry was conscious of every wheezing breath he took. His ribs were protesting with each step and more than once he could not help but whimper. Still, his injuries were not important. Not when there was so much at stake. Umbridge was on the warpath, searching the entire castle for Hermione, the twins and Harry. Harry knew his friends were not safe.
“Password.” Hermione interrupted, explaining with her hands on her hips when Harry caught her eye in confusion. “This was kind of you.” She told Draco. “Thank you. He’s been groaning in his sleep for the last half hour.”
“The signs were all there Harry. I had all night to think about it.” She was not yelling but her frustration was evident. “And I’m the brightest witch of my age.” She quoted derisively.
“Potter!” she pushed against his windpipe just enough to make him uncomfortable. “I go to sleep, and you are joined at the hip. Hell, you instigated a breakout from Hogwarts on his behalf! And NOW.” She raised her whispers for emphasis eliciting a delicious flinch from Drama Queen Draco. “Now, he wont even look at you!” she fell back to whispering for privacy’s sake.
of Harry snug in his arms. The enormity of how swiftly his life had
At dawn Harry’s eyes popped open in surprise and pleasure. He had slept nearly the whole night and peacefully for the second time in a row. A record. Draco still held him close, his bigger body a veritable furnace with the light blonde chest hairs tickling the scars on Harry’s back.
The arrival of Hermione was not chaotic as much as it was rushed. Draco had vehemently insisted the young woman leave the school tonight. Narcissa knew this was for Harry’s benefit and not any regard her son held for the intelligent muggleborn. Harry could be heard voicing one horrible possibility after another, having lost complete control of the Unburdening and his imagination. Draco had ordered him multiple times to stop pacing Severus’s office. Her son had a worried, pinched face, distorting his aristocratic angles, his attention mostly on the unseen boy-who-lived. Narcissa insisted he not worry and outlined the quick modification to the original plan.
Aunt Petunia too, had often used a sweet voice to obscure the coming violence. Harry flinched, violent when Lady Malfoy started to rise from her perch. Panic and Pain and Misery clouded his thoughts in a rumbling roar of
“Draco,” his Godfather interrupted his musings. “May we help you?” Which in Snape’s tone roughly translated as ‘why are you interrupting?’ Severus never got an explanation (Luna Lovegood told him to come) because not a moment later, Harry Potter was clinging to Draco’s middle with two thin arms, muttering apologies.
“It’s not your fault, Hermione. I never…” he trailed off when she laughed humorously.
“I care about you Harry!” Ron screamed, spittle spraying from his lips.
“Merlin forbid.” Draco spat. Blaise laughed his deep dark laugh. It was rare but it was rich, and Draco felt more than a little bit of pride to hear it. “Alright. Time to get Pansy.” To which, Blaise groaned. Their next task would not be easy.
Had the Dark Lord not been incapacitated that night, Narcissa would have fled with Draco.
“Ok, Ron.” Harry sagged, curving his spine. It wasn’t comfortable. He was defeated. Arguing would not solve anything. Ron was not listening and had no intention of being anything other than right. Perhaps Ron had a point. It was selfish of Harry to subject his roommates to sleepless nights. Harry looked at his clothing in heaps on the floor. Bending down would be too much at this point. He walked toward the door.
Allies and Enemies: chapter 2
“Damn.” Harry mumbled to himself.
Narcissa starts a plan in motion
“I’d rather not.” Her son said as polite as could be, adapting his mood to what suited best. He was just as in tune with her emotions as she with his. Hesitation and doubt clouded his handsome face while Harry looked completely torn up by the idea of Draco leaving.
, Harry thought with a dulled sense of wonder.
“Are the books not to your liking, Darling?” She asked, curious as to what would interest the boy.
“I’m ready.” He said, reverting to the familiar, the acquiesce of punishment so often doled out at the Dursleys. He no longer had the stone walls of Hogwarts to protect him. Not that he had ever been truly safe within the corridors. Still, before Umbridge, punishment for infractions had been detention. Meaningless time-consuming task,
“Go.” She pushed him back toward Hog’s Head tavern.
“Ease up, haven’t you ever had a piggyback ride?” Draco asked with some exasperation. The poor boy was holding on for dear life.
Draco’s mother was doting on the teenagers. Her face was uncharacteristically open with indulgent smiles and reassurances. She feed them pastries and tea until they were drowsy, patiently fielding questions until the adrenaline wore off and the food filled their anxious bellies. The future was unknown but, for now, they were safe at the Manor. Narcissa Black Malfoy would make it so.
and knowing that
Soon, Harry found himself seated at the farthest table amid a sea of green insignia and suspicious yet blank faces. He could also feel the heavy stares from the Gryfindor table and the ever-watchful eyes of Head Table.
No one knew that Voldemort had once been a handsome half blood orphan. And the ones that did were dead. Except for Dumbledore. No one would recognize him. Especially since his face was once again his own, if somewhat aged. It was the nose that would make them doubt he had anything to do with Voldemort. The nose and the hair. People were so blind when it came to seeing what they wanted to see. Not that anyone believed he was back, Dark Lord or Voldemort or no. The ministry was throwing heavy denials to Potter’s proclamations of his return.
Harry’s heart thudded heavily. “I… I can…” and no, he could not even utter the words offering to leave.
“Go to sleep silly, I’ll wake you up if anything happens.”
“Not that you.” Fred butted in.
There was no mixture of admiration with disappointment like Professor McGonagall or twinkling obfuscation akin to Dumbledore. And she definitely did not resemble Umbridge’s curiously disdainful countenance. No, if Harry had to compare, Lady Malfoy’s expression hovered closer to Madam Pomfrey’s concern with a splash of Snape’s unamused Potion’s lab stare.
“Er…” Harry hesitated.
, the Dark Lord was blindsided. This pain was a throbbing ache, emanating from the inside, draining, and burning and breaking every store of magic he possessed. It left him weak and breathless and just shy of sobbing.
“You are pleased.” Luna said airily next to Pansy across from the
“Wouldn’t have figured out a way.” George scowled.
Intimate moments between Draco and Harry
The Dark Lord’s original intentions had been to guide the wizarding world with a firm hand, teaching the influx of muggleborns how to survive and save them from the influence of hateful muggles. To keep them safe and away from the fear and pain and derision of the outside world. Away from wars and weapons and death. Instead, he had created an intolerable existence, he became the very thing he abhorred most. A tyrant. A violent murderer. A soulless beast of a madman who preyed upon children.
Harry knew full well not to trust any adult

Hermione nodded in agreement. Her mind raced. This was not good. This was, in fact, very bad. Dolores Umbridge was dangerous. Hermione had not seen the damage done to Harry’s hand, still, she knew not to go to Umbridge’s office alone. Hermione was at war. Her nature was against outwardly disobeying a teacher. Her survival instinct was screaming for her to run as far and as fast as she could to safety. The trek from the cool classrooms in the base of the castle was silent in the empty halls. Professor Umbridge’s heels clacked loudly against the stone, interrupted only by the worn carpet runners. Hermione held onto her impulses and tried to think her way out of the situation.
&&&&&
“Blast the tea.” Lucius cursed. He neared her perch with purpose. “What have you done?!”
“Oh!” Hermione snapped out of her silence. “No. Lady Malfoy. The twins got to me in time.”
“Narcissa, I will leave the newest batch of Nutrient Potions for you to administer. The ones I brewed this morning are more potent than the ones in Draco’s possession. They should be taken with every meal.”
“Are you up for this? I know you and… Mr. Potter have not seen eye to eye in the past.”
Pott… Harry, true to form, narrowed his wet eyes at Snape, full of distrust. It was as if the last few days had not happened at all as the gaze was so familiar to them both. This Snape could work with.
“Mother wants to discuss his condition with everyone at once.” Draco stalled.
“You can’t make that promise.” Harry said, using logic to put space between them.
“We understand.” Said George. Hermione was almost positive he was George. The posture was a smidge different and his tone gentler than Fred’s.
. Harry scoffed. Umbridge had succeeded in making his life miserable. The fear of losing his magic was greater than any instance where Uncle Vernon had come at him screaming obscenities and waving a leather belt. At least with his uncle, Harry knew what the punishment entailed. Umbridge could give
“Harry!” Draco’s mother yelped in the most dignified of ways. “You are a wonderful, strong wizard. You have no idea the power it takes to cast without a wand to direct or a word to control. Even the Dark Lord could not cast wandless.” Lady Malfoy said fervently.
“Running away solves nothing. We need to report her!”
“A week!” Harry yelped in horror.
Narcissa Black Malfoy watched her husband as he sat behind his aged oak desk. He was buried in parchment up to his strained eyeballs. The ministry with their galleons influence, was overflowing his desk with requests. Propaganda against Harry Potter. Denials of the Dark Lord. Lies and obfuscations with Lucius Malfoy at the center of it.
“Harry.” Narcissa said with concern and caring. “He will have to know.”
“I’ll be back shortly with Pansy and Blaise. Don’t do anything stupid like

“Shhhhhhh.” Draco soothed his rising anxiety. “I’m not going anywhere unless you say.”
call me the kudosmonster cuz i need some nom nom nom please
he was.

“As a compliment!” crowed his twin.
Pansy POV
“He was with me.” Draco spoke up. Harry could not help but feel rescued. Ron’s face did not bode well, it turned red then mottled purple, a clear indication he was about to explode.
The twins had proven to be a lively distraction as they had an excellent command of debate with their practice of twin speak. Luna’s airy voice was unwelcome. His indecision was short lived when both twins and surprisingly, Longbottom, sent him scowls. Draco scoffed. Loony Lovegood might be a seer,
“I’m not lying.” Harry shrank back away from the other Slytherin. Away from Draco. He rubbed absently at his bandaged hand.
“It’s fine.” Harry was quick to interrupt. “I can handle it.”
“What was that for?” Harry did not pull away while Hermione shook her head, lips pinched tightly shut.
. A concept, I’m sure, you are unfamiliar with.”
“I can’t believe your mother is letting you get away with this.” Harry hissed from his perch on Draco’s hard lap. The taller boy shrugged nearly dislodging his captive. Harry yelped and wrapped his arms tighter around Draco’s neck.

Draco’s newfound kindness was an entirely different animal. Harry felt
often giving her comfort and the lessons from her no-nonsense mother still flickering flames in the back of her mind. But now, as she lay as still as possible she felt a frisson of shivers dancing up and down her spine, unfamiliar and
“I need to speak with Professor McGonagall.” Harry spoke softly to not disturb the other portraits. “Please.” He hastily added when the cat ignored him to lick her paw. The speckled Animagus purred at him for his manners then disappeared.
“Do you want to talk about this?” Harry’s voice was small and quiet and on the verge of reedy. He held his breath after giving voice to the question.
“Eat.” Draco commanded under his breath pulling Harry’s plate closer to the smaller boy.
That hurt, mean whisper of Draco’s pride was silenced entirely and his heart felt full to bursting. Draco returned the embrace, wrapping Harry up, relishing how he could tuck the smaller boy in close and smell his own shampoo wafting off the dark unruly hair. Following instinct, Draco bent his neck and kissed the soft tufts. Harry shivered and clung tighter.
“Nice one.” Remarked Fred.
“Harry, we need to talk.” Ron opened.
“Eat, Potter.” Draco ordered.
“What did you hear?” Ron asked suspiciously, his face flushing from the neck up. A clear sign of his guilt.
he concluded, but hurt.
Instead, he leaned down, eyes wide open keeping Harry trapped. Draco kissed him sweetly, gently, with a curious tongue tracing the seam of Harry’s pouting lips. Surprise drowned out all the other emotions in the green depths, which then morphed to pleasure. His pale eyelids fluttered closed as he let out a small noise Draco could only identify as a moan.
“I need to speak with our cousin.” Narcissa said directly. Time was of the essence. She had not liked leaving the boys at Hogwarts. Snape would protect them as best he could, but even Severus could not devote the time and care needed in this delicate situation.
Home field 9:
“You wont leave?” Harry worried his chapped bottom lip, halfway to climbing the mattress.
“Are you certain?” Hermione blurted out before she could restrain herself.
“In fact, I insist.” Professor McGonagall commanded with steel behind her deep voice. She was staring at his bandaged hand suspiciously.
Their jaunt to the professor’s storeroom was a quick walk. The halls at such an early hour were dark and empty with only the sounds of their heels echoing down the hall. Even the paintings were quiet. Snape used wandless magic to unlock the new wards. Draco knew Snape had installed them after the Triwizard Tournament. The door swung open in a ghostly manner.
“Earmuffs?” Narcissa asked amused giving a sly grin.
“Things change?” Harry scoffed. “You beat me up!” He lightly pinched the soft skin on the far side of Draco’s chest. Draco’s hand settled against Harry’s head and the Gryffindor wished he had never opened his damn mouth.
“Quoting Muggle authors now, are we?” Draco teased.
“You need your sleep too!” Harry protested using her favorite tool, logic. No way would he ever want Hermione to resent him the way Ron did.

“Yes! Let one of the devils go!” Draco exclaimed throwing his arms into the air as if Harry were being
“Were they?” Narcissa mused. “I look forward to meeting them. Both Draco and Severus have spoken of them… often.”
I feel like Pansy had so much more depth than she was afforded in the story. I never really understood why all these great characters were so overlooked.
“You will stay right where you are.” Draco growled.
Draco thought dully. The complexity of his potential disinheritance was another thing he was unprepared to deal with. For now, he was safe in his mother’s house with the former bane of his existence cuddled in close.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s done is done.” Lady Malfoy stood, turning to look down at Harry in a way Draco was unfamiliar with. If he had to guess, he would have said she resembled one of the Valkyrie in the old stories. “You’re under my care now, Harry and you’ll be treated like the gift you are.” To which the brave little Gryffindor tucked his face back into Draco’s chest, breath hot and panting against his shirt.
Harry did not know how to respond. Draco was staring at him curiously, face blank and passive yet somehow catching every detail, like a lazy cat gearing up to pounce on it’s prey.
“No harm will come to them.” She assured her friend. “Professor Snape takes his duties seriously.”
“Draco.” Snape said kindly, before he could reach the door. “Stay close to Potter but try to keep your distance. For now, at least. And make sure he drinks these every two hours.” Several more vials, a murky tan this time, floated to Draco. He snatched them out of the air and pocket them as well.
. Like you always do. I can’t help you trapped here with Umbitch breathing breathing down our necks.”
Not sure if I’m crazy and seeing things but there are 8 chapters? Not seven? So confusion
“Please sister,” Narcissa dropped her cool façade. She was not above pleading. Not when it came to her Draco. ”My son is in danger, as is Harry Potter.”
“If you are quite done.” Snape said impatiently. “I need to return before morning.”
Draco rumbled a laugh, amused more by the snort than the comment. “You’re not wrong.” He agreed. “Things changed this summer.”
Home field 7
me from my own house!” He roared.
&&&&&
“Something troubles you.” She asked in that way of hers, quietly but more of a statement than a question. Immediately, Harry’s eyes burned without his permission. He shot a glance to Draco across the table. The older boy’s face had morphed from ferociously frowning to frozen stone. The Slytherin was blatantly ignoring a hissing Pansy.
“I have not broken any vows!” Lucius grit out between shining teeth.
Bushy hair erupted out of the darkness followed by a pretty and intelligent face. A face, drawn pale from the frozen air. Narcissa tsked, the sound amplified down the empty village alley. They would have to hurry before anyone came to investigate. Narcissa reaffirmed her determination when Harry Potter’s unruly hair floated alongside Ms. Granger’s. He smiled shyly at Narcissa, warming her heart just like he had in Severus’ office.
“Cissa.” Her sister admonished. “You should know better. Sirius Black is a wanted criminal. I do not know of his whereabouts.”
“Yes Sir.” Draco assented.
“No!” Harry denied loudly, which sounded like an affirmative to them both.
“Sassy.” retorted Probably Fred.
“As you should.” Draco shot them a grateful grimacing look with undertones of smugness. The Malfoy Heir was a complex man, in their opinion. “You’re freezing.” Draco said, taking Harry’s hands, being extra careful not to put too much pressure on the injured one.
“What a handsome boy.” The Fat Lady said with interest. She was straining to watch Draco’s lithe figure descend the stairwell.
“Try not to keep me in suspense… Narcissa.” Severus urged when she refrained from continuing. Harry had visibly tensed, his thin hands turning into fists with white knuckles. Narcissa ran her concerned gaze over her companion before turning her attention back to Severus like she was a flower seeking the sun. A shiver ran down his spine.
“The little one.” She interrupted, overly helpful. She continued with some judgment. “How he’s the savior of the wizarding world is beyond me. As tiny as a third year! And at his age!” she was back to speaking in exclamations.
“You are not ‘fine’ Mr. Potter.” Severus flat out told the stubborn little boy with a particularly vicious sneer. Harry had no idea the sneer was not for him but for the ignorant abusive muggles who seemed to have brainwashed the boy into ignoring his needs. “No one doubts your abilities…” he continued when he had the attention of those unnaturally green eyes, “aside from your intelligence.” He snapped when the teenager perked up to argue. This time, Severus meant it. “Foolish and stubborn.” Snape accused aloud. “Far be it for you to actually listen to anyone who
The eight students waited, mostly in silence until dawn crept unseen beyond the castle walls. The time stretched until all too soon the group went one by one into the tunnel. Harry lit the way, leading them in the dark and Draco wondered if this was what his new life would entail. Following Harry Potter into the unknown. He did not have time to dwell. The Portkey started buzzing just as the burst through to a sleepy Hog’s Head tavern. The morning light flittering in from the dirty windows highlighting the warped wooden floor in a dance of dust and sunlight.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter.” She responded looking positively shocked by the compliment, though she quickly rallied. “What may I help you with?”
The twins watched, narrow eyed, at their surrogate brother. “We could not…”
“They’re early.” Luna cocked her head to the side with a mild look of alarm effectively distracting Harry. She hurried to hide them both beneath the invisibility cloak. Luna placed her small hand over his loud gasping breath when she accidently elbowed him in the torso.
“You are wrong, Ron.” Harry told him without looking back. “I’m going to give you what you want. To be free from my shadow.”
“No.” Harry said, the truth dawning on him. She had seen his withdrawal. “No.” He repeated as the implications set in. “It’s me. It’s my fault. I don’t…” the words would not come. Panic was a live octopus closing his throat. And Lady Malfoy was frowning down at Harry, and he just could not find the word to keep Draco from trouble. This was his own fault, not Draco’s. A flash of Professor Umbridge’s sadist smirk superimposed over Lady Malfoy’s aristocratic face in his mind. Harry struggled to speak before slumping and sighing, the fight leaving him because he knew he deserved this.
It wasn’t until after they collected a sleepy-eyed Blaise, the Twins and Neville, did Pansy find an opportunity to pull Draco into an unlit alcove on the way to the dining room.
“Time is wasted arguing.” Harry tried throwing out some logic. “I’ll be right back!” and with that, he disappeared beneath the ever so handy cloak, armed with his father’s map and an unflappable determination to succeed. The same resolve that made him so successful at catching the snitch.
“You leave my daughter out of this!” Andromeda’s face spat little burst of flame in the ash.
“Good Evening Professor. Sorry to bother you so late.” He apologized with some embarrassment. Harry knew all too well how badly adults needed alone time away from children. Not that Harry considered himself a child. Still, he did not want to burden her.
“No. She can’t.”
Not edited: my time is limited. I promise to get to any mistakes if and when necessary. please enjoy!
Three days in bed with weird meals and house elves administering snacks until he was feeling bloated and sleepy but also anxious to get up and out. Three nervous days with no word on what was happening at Hogwarts. Lady Malfoy was tight lipped each morning she came to greet him. Draco was mulish and Hermione was hesitant to deny him. Even Neville guiltily shrugged and said:
“Where have you been?” Ron was on Harry as soon as they entered the massive dining hall. Ron’s whining voice echoed throughout, turning each head of the student body.
that caused the problems.
“I want to tell you all of the things, Harry.” Draco announced sincerely. “When I find the words.”
next up: a conversation with McGonagall.
Blaise, Neville and the Twins raced ahead in an impromptu competition. The group was energetic with pent up energy from the long wait through the night. Luna and Pansy had more reservation, keeping pace with Draco, taking care not to slip on the frozen ground. Luna spent the journey pointing out real estate for dabberblimps to lounge when the snow thawed, and the pond became a humid murky swamp. Apparently, Malfoy Manor grounds were prime for an infestation. Unsure what she was prattling on about, Draco spent the trip enjoying Harry’s stifled giggles of hot breath near his ear. Draco was so focused on each puff; he did not even realize they had reached the front of the Manor until his mother called out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Another thing she was unfamiliar with, were the two Hogwarts students sharing her bed, breathing softly. Hermione Granger  lay curled on her side facing Luna, still sleeping peacefully. The poor thing had been a nervous wreck by the time morning had come. And with that came the restless energy before the  adrenaline crashed. And tears. Luna had never seen another girl cry before. It was as beautiful as it was curious, the way the candlelight had sparkled in Hermione’s tear tracks.
George fluttered his eyelashes at the younger boy, flirtatious and teasing. Harry could not be sure if Draco moved closer to him or if it were a trick of the imagination.
“Yes ma’am.” Harry said again, only this time his voice was filled with some type of wonder.
“Understatement.” Hermione snarked.
Allies and Enemies 5:
Draco Malfoy readied himself outside of his mother’s study. He squared his broad shoulder and lifted his slightly pointed chin up with his nose in the air in a close imitation of his father, having seen the man do so his entire life. Draco took a deep breath. And then another. And then another, clenching and relaxing his long-fingered hands until finally, he knocked on the door as etiquette dictates.
“No!”
Allies and Enemies: Chapter four: An Old Friend.
Professor McGonagall’s door was just as normal as any other carved wooden door in Hogwarts. Harry had not expected it’s plainness as he had never intentionally set out to speak to his Head of House in her private quarters. The hallway was dim and lined with sleeping, quiet portraits of previous Gryffindor alumni. Her entrance was guarded by a portrait of her Animagus form. Harry recognized the cat from his first bumbling day of Transfiguration.
“You sound just like Harry.” Draco accused with no little anger. “You cannot save everyone.”
“I did not
No. Harry could not trust Ron. Not at this point anyway. And Harry could not be sure Ron would not rat them out to Umbridge’s minions for the notoriety and house points. Decision made; Harry climbed the steps to the Fifth-year dorm. Maybe it was sheer dumb luck or maybe it was Mother Magic looking down on him favorably for the first time ever that found Neville Longbottom alone in the dorm studying on his bed.
Pansy agreed with a shrewd look and several
“Perhaps you would like to discuss your concerns in private.” Lady Malfoy decided, to which Harry gave a tight but perceptible nod. “Alright children.” She addressed the table. “Your studies will resume tomorrow morning. I recommend you spend the rest of the day enjoying the free time.” She announced with one arched brow. None of the students protested.
, he thought.
it because she could see him struggle against the Unburdening Potion with each eyeroll and neck twitch.
“There is a problem.” She deduced.
“All you had to do was ask.” Finished Fred.
hope you enjoy!
“I love you too, Harry.” Hermione was not going to cry. She was a strong independent female and yes, she had just suffered a scare but no lasting damage and so what if her friend just casually threw out the “L” word. And
“Yes Madam.” He agreed, exasperation clear in his gravel voice. Griphook took her to his office bypassing the tunnels. He sat above her at his massive gold and marble desk expectantly and with very little patience.
“Hey.” Harry automatically said back. Draco smirked and brushed past to the bathroom. The light flickered back on, illuminating Draco’s bare back and the way his black sleep pants hung low on his trim hips. Harry nearly stumbled back with the way his stomach clenched in
“I’m sorry.” He apologized quickly. “I know Professor Snape said a week. I just… couldn’t…” His bright eyes looked around the room for the words. “couldn’t be alone anymore.” Harry found Draco in the room and locked his stare on her son.
“I didn’t know where you were.” Harry said forlornly.
“No doubt.” The twins said in unison.
“Good, we are all here.” She said with the mystery of the universe in her soft breathy voice. Only the three Slytherins eyed her with concern. Harry and the other Gryffindors had more experience with her enigmatic statements. Harry turned in Draco’s arms to regard Luna despondently.
“Aren’t you going to dress, Potter?” Draco teased quietly. “Did you sleep in my sweater?” Amusement sparked lightening in his quicksilver eyes. Hermione, again, made that unusual little squeaking noise.
Harry’s only respite were when his friends would come to check on him. Or during Lunch and Dinner where Draco would make a fun picnic atmosphere in the middle of the bed and feed him crackers and fruit pieces and slices of meat. By hand. With people there. And really only Blaise and Pansy gave them strange looks while the twins cooed and Hermione look eminently pleased with herself. Luna and Neville smiled at him reassuringly. Because it was abundantly clear Harry had no idea what to make of the whole situation. And he was definitely not going to question anything when he
The Great Escape Round Three
“Hermione, I’m ok. I promise. You saw me at lunch.”
“Exactly.” Harry was nodding his shaggy head as he hugged his friend, bumping his head into her cheek. “I say we all call truce. Even to our own selves.” He added. “And then go see if there are pancakes.” Harry squeezed her again because she seemed to need it. Sure enough, she laughed and gifted him a dazzling smile.
“Godfather, please.” The young Slytherin resorted to his best wide-eyed expression, similar to puppy dog eyes, just, not as pathetic.
“Draco,” Luna said, interrupting the chatter around the dining room table. The low key quarrel between the Slytherins and the Twins about the merit of protective gear during Quidditch practices fell silent like a sheet over furniture. The rest of the table following suit to turn their attention to the white haired seer. Draco debated ignoring the witch. He was moody and upset over Harry’s odd behavior. And he really did not like
Making it to the Slytherin common room undetected was no trouble. Why would two Gryffindors be caught in enemy territory? Draco stayed under the cloak until he reached the dorm room he shared with Blaise.
“Ugh. Stupid ribs.” Harry muttered.
Chapter six
Draco shifted on his end of the sofa, leaning back into the cushions and manhandling Harry’s slight body into a more comfortable position. Harry’s head was a solid weight against his chest once again and Draco draped one arm over his back, anchoring him in place, in a wildly inappropriate way to lounge in front of his mother and professor.
The next part is mostly written (ok so four chapters definitely written and a fifth that is being a huge bastard because I did a thing even my tender heart was like "no but why tho?") I need to start tiptaptypening them up.
Draco scowled harder. “He thinks I am upset with him, Mother.”
. The attention being from Draco even more so. And the complete lack of censorship from his classmates kept the echos of Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon quiet. Because being hand feed from a boy who had been your nemesis for four years was not
Draco’s patience began to wane. “Right. Well, he’s hurt and needs a potion. Professor Snape sent me. I have it right here.” Draco held out the swirling blue vial. It glowed faintly, illuminating Draco’s face in mystery.
“Of course, Severus.” Lady Malfoy replied with only the barest hints of a secret smile. Draco watched with interest when his Godfather’s deathly pale cheeks flared with color.
“If that is all, I’ll see myself out.” Severus bowed to the room departing with billowing robes. He left behind a rather large wooden case full of potions.
“I explained why that is a bad idea.” Harry argued.
“Try me.” Draco smirked, finally looking down with the same self-assuredness Harry had always mistook as arrogance. Harry did not argue further. He could not. Not when he
Luna pulled Harry to the floor, rolling them both to the other side of the hallway where they stayed until Umbridge found nothing and lost interest. By the time the woman was gone, Harry’s whole body was on fire from staying so still and his nerves were an absolute wreck. Thankfully, Luna had her wits about her. They travelled onward and when the two reached the R.O.R, Luna had to literally drag Harry inside since he could no longer stand on his own.
“A small cat only.” Harry qualified looking queasy and miserable at the confession.
Hope Y'all enjoy!
. Just over two years ago, when he was still recovering for the second time because the Potter brat had knocked him out of a body, he had felt a similar pain. Poisonous and sharp like teeth rending flesh from bone. The Dark Lord felt a piece of himself die. A horcrux. His first soul piece. The one he had entrusted with his Right Hand, Lucius Malfoy. It was just… gone. Painfully gone. Dead.
“Sometimes the only option is to retreat.”
&&&&&
Who knew the brat-who-lived could nearly knock Severus Snape off his feet? The boy, small and underweight, barreled into Severus like one of Hela’s hounds were after him. Snape caught Harry by his skinny shoulders and magically kept them both from falling. Wide, tear-filled emerald eyes stared up at Severus in horror and fear. Snape immediately let go of the trembling teenager only to watch him scramble back, falling on his bottom in haste. Potter then physically scoot on the ground until his back was covered by the sofa. Silent tears ran down his pale cheeks. It was an interesting tableau with Lady Malfoy standing and covering her mouth after she cried out when the boy landed on the floor. Snape let the silence settle before clearing his throat. He, himself, was having trouble with his own façade of indifference.
thing he wanted.
“What I’m requesting must be held in the strictest confidence.”
Adventure. Ha. What a joke. Harry was fully aware his life was a parody of bad luck and blind manipulations. His choices were not his own and he was hard pressed to ever remember feeling safe. Not the way he was feeling here, in the dark with Draco. Safe and cared for, in a way Molly Weasley could not compare to with her overwhelming mother instincts lumping him in with her children and never
It was no wonder the Longbottom boy had been sorted into Gryffindor. Narcissa wondered if Lady Longbottom was aware of Neville’s aptitude for magical flora. The elderly matron had dropped some distinctly disparaging comments in regard to her grandson’s abilities prior to the arrival of his Hogwarts acceptance letter. How the tides had turned, Narcissa mused.
“Knowledge is power Parkinson.” Luna said with innocently wide blue eyes. The troll.
“What did you do?” she hissed at him furiously with no warning once the others had passed. She enjoyed how his eyes clouded with fear and he audibly gulped beneath the small hand she had clenching his throat.
“You cannot
Only Snape showed any disapproval of the cuddling while his mother observed indulgently. Draco suspected she was catering more to Harry’s desire for close contact than Draco’s greedy, possessive grasp on the Gryffindor.
“I’m not very good at sleeping.” Harry snarked with a cute little snort. “My worst subject really.”
Breakfast progressed smoothly after that. Hermione’s cheeks were flush for most of it, being jostled by the twins were wont to do that to a person. Harry knew. They were both hard bodied and handsome. Harry was wondering if this was the first time Hermione had noticed. And she was noticing, if her quiet surprised gasps and furtive glances were anything to go by. Harry felt ultimate sympathy for her. The twins could be… overwhelming.
“It was my room until I was eleven. Now I’m only put there for punishments. Or if Uncle Vernon is particularly tired of seeing my freak face.” Harry did not recognize his own voice. He had not intended to divulge that particular route of information. Nor had he ever wanted to see
Harry, seemingly unaware of the other students, was focused solely on Draco’s smirking lips. It took no effort to lead the boy to the fire. Draco sat, pulling Harry down to lean against him. Draco debated giving him an early dose of the Unburdening. Unfortunately, there was nothing substantial to eat with the potion. Instead, he pressed a Nutrient vial into Harry’s uninjured hand. The Gryffindor kept silent though he did grimace at the taste.
“Harry,” Lady Malfoy finally spoke during a lull in conversation. “You should eat something, darling.” She was watching him with that certain look. The one he wasn’t sure how to name. It wasn’t disgust which had often graced Aunt Petunia’s face. Nor was it malice like Uncle Vernon. Lady Malfoy’s face was calm but not indifferent like Dudley and no where close to gleefully sadistic like Aunt Marge.
Three days.
“Sleep, Harry, I’ll be right here when you wake up.” She sighed when he stubbornly blinked at her. “At least lay down. Even if you don’t sleep your body will get some rest. I’m going to be right here.” With that, Hermione slipped to the rug in front of the couch. Harry watched as she emptied her book bag, precisely setting each book, each roll of parchment, each quill neatly around her.
“You cannot be serious.” Ron spat vitriolically. “I’ve been there for you. Every year.” He emphasized. “Every year I’ve had your back. On the chessboard. With Lockhart. When you thought Sirius was going to kill you. And the Dragons!” Ron ranted. “I told you about the dragons!”
“You speak lies!”
“As for pain management…” Severus started.
Hermione spent the next hour patiently listening, curled up next to him on the battered sofa. She had one knee up and the other dangling so she could see him better. Hermione was horrified by the fight with Draco, surprised by Lady Malfoy’s kindness, and had no objections to Professor Snape’s assistance. When he told her about the Dursleys, she cried, wetly hiccuping each time she pressed her plump lips firmly together to allow him to keep going. Her tears stopped completely when he spoke of Ron. Her usually warm brown eyes turned hard as stone. Still, she did not say anything, just let him continue. At the end of Harry’s account, he laid his head back, dizzy with the rush of relief from all the things he never thought he would say out loud to his best friend.
from their search. By the time he made it, the common room only held a few upperclassmen studying and a crowd of fifth years with one angry, ranting Ronald Weasley. Harry hesitated, listening to the vitriol his first friend was spitting out. It was the same old drivel. Harry Potter is a miniature Dark Lord. Harry Potter is selfish. A traitor. A liar. It was the last one that decided Harry’s next actions. Ron may have invited Harry into his home, into his family, but this betrayal was worse than anything the Dursley’s had ever done.
Again, he looked to Draco only to be stared down with the coldest look since before their fight three days ago. Harry could not say
Her father understood the unseen magics Luna had been gifted by her Mother. And Harry. Blessed Harry, her only true friend.  Everyone else was too afraid of her differentness and it was fear they felt because not only could she
“Don’t worry, mate.”
“Sweet innocent little Harrykins!” Fred cooed making Harry’s face
“To rescue fair damsel.” Possibly George took Hermione’s still trembling hand to land a gentle, sweet kiss on her knuckles.
During the half hour it took to rouse their friends, both old and new, Harry was carefully avoiding Draco Malfoy and his intoxicatingly presence. Each accidental connection of fingers to his hand was like lightening. Brilliant and bright and devastating because Harry
I’m taking requests… you know, if there is something out there in the realm of possibilities that you, dear readers, would like to see. Soft ball it my way and I will do my best.
“Sorry.” His apology was forced and only referring to the embarrassment on both their faces, not on his instinct to protect. Hermione waved him off, this time hugging Harry with far greater restraint. Harry hugged her back emphatically, his eyes closed tight with relief. Draco knew his little Gryffindor had been profoundly worried about the girl.
“For Merlin sake Pansy, what took so long?” Draco drawled at the doorway, not entering. Instead, he leaned against the door jamb with his patent pending unaffected aire. Pansy rolled her eyes at him before she zoned in. Behind her Slytherin brethren stood a morose Harry Potter, head down, body language small and unassuming. Not that he had ever exhibited great joy, his victories always clouded by personal injury. Now he stood away from Draco as if there were a great chasm between the previously inseparable boys.
“By this, you mean…?” Draco prodded somewhat sharply, though his hand did not stop the slow soothing petting motion.
while I’m gone.” Draco ordered with his long-fingered hand cradling Harry’s pale dumbfounded face. Once more he kissed Harry, this time on his damp forehead and with that Draco was gone.
Snape had, in fact, saved Harry’s life multiple times. First with Quirrel and the bewitched broom. Then again with Lupin. Snape had stood between three Gryffindors and a werewolf even when Harry had done what he had done to get to the truth, leaving Snape injured and more than angry. Not to mention the numerous occasions when Snape caught Harry out after curfew and not once had the man laid a violent hand on him. Still, it was hard to think past the pain and the loud angry voice. Flashes of Vernon’s purple rage bombarded Harry’s prevalent thought like bombs making Harry revert to a time when he was helpless and
“Harry.” Ron bit out. “can speak for himself.”
“What he means to say, is your exodus from Hogwarts will not be alone. Mother is bringing a portkey for us to use. There are several other students who wish to leave. You’re just the one in immediate danger.”
“Fuck.” Harry swore, unconsciously leaning into Draco, eyes never leaving the youngest male Weasley.
Only now… she did not know what to do. And the
“No one likes blurting out their innermost thoughts, Harry” Hermione reassured him with logic.
“Harry,” Draco’s voice was closer than the Gryffindor had expected him to be. A puff of warm air on the shell of Harry’s ear. A shifting of warm torso, sturdily supplying support for Harry to lean against. The wooden bench seat had plenty of room to spread out. Breakfast of a Sunday morning in the middle of winter was generally a quiet affair in the Great Hall with bleary eyed and often pajama clad students lolling in and out. Some lingered using the space to study. Some rushed in, just before the dishes were magically cleared, snagging enough food to hoard back to the dorms. Harry, himself, preferred to squirrel his food into his cloak to eat in the privacy of the Astronomy tower, or sneak special treats to Hedwig.
“Magical Mediterranean Water Plants and Their Properties.” Harry picked up the book from under the cloak giving it the illusion of floating.
“He will disinherit me.” It was a lie. He would kill her. Still, the threat could be used as a valid argument.
Travelling back through the length of the castle was long and arduous. Luna led them on multiple detours to avoid the Squad with only one close encounter with Umbridge herself. The Pink Toad was looking more and more mad by the minute. Her eyes were beady and wild and her perfectly quaffed hair showed signs of abuse. Harry held his breath the entire time they shared the same corridor. Panic threatening to darken his vision. Luna in her infinite wisdom, pinched Harry in the thigh. He let out an involuntary squeak catching the High Inquisitor’s attention. Umbridge zeroed in on their location and rose her wand.
“I’m afraid not.” A familiar voice agreed.
wasn’t right, which, was more irritating than painful. So, Harry lay on his back on the softest mattress he had ever experienced, wide awake and counting Draco’s light snores. He wore one of Dudley’s oversized tee shirts after a row with Draco.
Once they were settled, Hermione had begged for a play by play of occurrences after she had left. Neither Luna nor Pansy had much information and it wasn’t long before sleep claimed them. Luna was the last awake, experiencing this new kind of tired. The one that did not shut off her brain but caused her body to feel heavy and stiff. She was trying to absorb this overload of information which had never been a problem for her before. She often binged new information in her own placid way. Only tiring when she fully explored each rabbit hole.
“Aha Forge! I told you she needed us!” exclaimed Fred.
The twin’s attention turned from teasing Harry to the proximity of the formally antagonistic Slytherin propping Harry up on at the table. Both Fred and George began filling their plates and sometimes the others plate, reaching across Hermione to give one eggs or the other sausage. It was a flurry of long limbs never once bumping hands or spilling. Handy. The whole while, the twins were watching Draco nudge the distracted Harry into nibbling on the goopy oatmeal or popping a blueberry into his mouth.
“You really have so much to learn.” The Malfoy Heir smirked. “Now, what to wear?” He stood in front of his closet, tapping a finger to his chin.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Ron yelled, heading straight into attack. “Has Voldemort finally taken possession of you? I know you have a connection to him. Have you finally turned traitor?” With that, Ron thumped him right on the scar.
“I knew that little brat would come running to his mother! Really, Cissa, you have spoiled that boy rotten.” Disgust colored Lucius’s voice. His posture changing from very nearly defeated to his complete aristocratic spine stiff pomp. Lucius’s smile turned Chesire, assured as he was to gain the upper hand. He was in for an unpleasant surprise.
“Sure,” Hermione acknowledged. “And you would be right to be concerned if you were alone.” When Harry looked on dubiously, she continued. “But Harry, that’s the thing, you are not alone. I’m here. Go to sleep. I’ll keep watch.” She promised.
“Are you in pain?” Neville asked, clearly concerned.
“The chills should pass soon.” Narcissa commented. “Are there…” she paused, unsure exactly how to proceed. The moment passed. Narcissa forged ahead, manners were one thing, her duty as a healer another. “Are you injured in any way?”
Pain was nothing new to Voldemort. He had grown up with it as Tom Riddle in the orphanage before he had learned to control his magic. And after his first third Horcrux, had employed it as his own favorite weapon as the Dark Lord. Then, ultimately, pain had been his constant companion once he was obliterated into a wraith of a being.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You need to eat.” Draco announced, straightening to his full authority. “Mother said you should eat more. You barely ate enough to feed an owl last night.” Draco scowled in memory. “And Snape gave me these to give to you to take every two hours between meals.” He read the instructions on the mud-colored potion, to double check the directions.
“You don’t believe me.” Lady Malfoy said plainly.
“You didn’t like him either.” Draco pointed out.
Harry smiled at them, both fond and relieved. A weight lifted. There had been a real fear Harry could lose the Weasley’s friendship.
Harry snapped his mouth shut tightly. He shook his head ‘no’. She sighed in disappointment. “I see. I am afraid there is nothing I can do to help you. Try to get some sleep if you can.” Harry recognized the look on her face as one he had seen many times in the mirror. Resignation. Her hands were tied.
“And what exactly is this plan?” she asked.
“Come on,” she rolled her eyes when he pouted at her, this time dragging him out of the common room and straight into the waiting arms of Draco Malfoy.
“You don’t understand.” Ron plead. “You cannot possibly know what’s it like in your shadow. I can’t ever relax. I just wanted to have a little fun with the guys and not think about how the whole world is such a mess.”
Hope you all are doing well!
Narcissa left him to his work. She had her own to do. First and foremost, she needed to speak with Sirius Black. Tracking the man down was sure to be a task. Narcissa was not afraid to put in the work.
