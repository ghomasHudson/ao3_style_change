“What task, Draco?” Harry asked, wiping away the salt trails before they could dry on his delicate skin.
“Then why say it?” Harry demanded.
“No, sir. I’d like you to remain my magical guardian, please,” he whispered. Draco exhaled in relief next to him and Severus graced him with a faint smile.
Waving goodbye, Harry waited until they were far enough from the other Gryffindors to whisper, “Still with me?”
There was an uncomfortable silence as the others chewed on the implications behind the logic before Krum grumbled darkly in Bulgarian and Fleur hissed in rapid-fire French.
Bill Weasley, cursebreaker and brother of the hooligans responsible, flooed in and was collaborating with Professor Snape on how to undo the magic tethered to Harry’s core. Though, by day three, it wasn’t looking too promising. And no matter what revitalizing potions or spells Madam Pomfrey tried on her comatose patient, Harry slept on without a care for the chaos outside the hospital doors.
Cautiously, the elf reached out a hand and patted his shoulder. “Dobby is sad that Harry Potter is crying,” he whispered. “Is Harry Potter needing anything?”
“Knowing Harry didn’t feel comfortable in the tower and was likely sleep-deprived, I offered him Sanctuary in Slytherin House. He spent most of yesterday catching up on sleep, but this morning Theo found a passage in
Smiling kindly at her friend, she said, “Draco darling, you’ve been fixated on Harry for years. As Theo said, none of us are surprised and now that I know him a bit better, I understand the appeal. He’s genuine and caring and quite sweet. You could do with some of that in your life.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Harry murmured, face flushing in embarrassment at the insinuation and the subsequent rescue, feeling like a damsel in distress instead of a wizard capable of handling nosy reporters. But, he reminded himself, looking out for one another was what it meant to be a Slytherin. Merlin, he’d never been so grateful.
“Potter’s one of mine now,” he announced without preamble. “He’s under my protection, which means he’s under all of ours. If you have questions, direct them to me. But know this: I may not deign to answer and you’ll just have to accept that. We’ve struck an accord and I won’t tolerate any bullshit about it.”
Dumbledore’s speech at breakfast resulted in fewer obvious hexes thrown his way during the day, but the venomous whispers of “traitor,” “cheat,” and “snake” were impossible to pinpoint in the crush of students. A few tripping jinxes from his friends at the more blatant gossips, however, made their attackers wary and granted them a bit of a reprieve by mid-afternoon.
“Of course we do,” Harry insisted. “I never meant to steal your thunder, Cedric. I was excited for you when you were announced. Why would I want to take that away from any of you?”
His godfather’s features softened infinitesimally, and Draco smiled to himself. “You’re welcome. Good night, Draco.”
An incredulous puff of air escaped Harry as the wall slid open. Such a simple word, really; one he’d never fully appreciated because he hadn’t understood the depth of it until a few days ago. He blinked away the tears filling his eyes as Pansy squeezed his arm and the lads clapped him lightly on the back. Their kindness further buoyed the new sense of belonging as they passed through the common room toward the dorms.
“There’s no harm in admitting how you feel,” Blaise said. “You’re among friends, Draco. None of us are going to rat you out to your father.”
His opinion of the man reached an all-time low after the gut-wrenching revelations from the night before; leaving Harry defenceless at the hands of cruel muggles was irresponsible and utterly reprehensible. Discovering that Dumbledore pushed him toward Gryffindor by not-so-subtly placing Molly at the platform when a lost Harry needed rescuing, combined with Hagrid’s ham-handed warnings against Slytherin, was the last straw.
Draco grinned to hear them claim Harry—a brother in all but blood. Joy bubbled in his chest and spilled past his lips with a laugh as he tossed a wadded pair of socks to the bed opposite him.
“‘Course, mate,” Ron replied, a little too cheerily, but he counted the relieved smile on Harry’s face as a win.
“Thank you, Harry. I shall endeavour to maintain your trust and ensure it is not misplaced.” Furrowing his brows at the mediwitch, he said, “Poppy, it goes without saying that even the Headmaster is not to see this document. It contains highly sensitive information and I believe the fewer people who are aware of it, the better.”
Flopping against his seat with a dramatic sigh, Draco said, “I’m still trying to replace the fairy wings and make the potion viable. Fairies are notoriously hard to catch, first of all, and I don’t enjoy leaving them without the ability to fly just for some crone to slather potion on her face.” Draco wrinkled his nose in distaste and Harry’s estimation of him increased exponentially.
“Do you even need to ask?” Draco teased, secretly delighted when Harry’s blush deepened. Brushing their lips in a featherlight caress, he murmured, “Yes, Harry. We’re boyfriends.”
Shifting uncomfortably at the betrayal in her voice, he stammered, “It’s, uh, a bit more than unhappy, Professor.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “I don’t mean to be a nuisance.”
Sufficiently cowed by Draco’s protective stance, their housemates backed off. Harry blew out a relieved breath when they returned to their games and homework with sheepish smiles. As grateful as he was for their acceptance, the day’s events had drained him and he didn’t feel like socializing.
A heavy silence descended as their stoic leader broke down in a rare moment of vulnerability. Having known one another since they could walk, the six of them were thick as thieves. There had been plenty of opportunities when they’d skived off their private lessons to fly their brooms or searched the darkest nooks and crannies of their manors, despite their parents’ warnings, to see the pampered heir crumble. Yet, this was only the fifth time in ten years that any of them saw Draco cry.
So Draco does the only thing he can. He withdraws. He shies away from Potter’s touch and he hides in his bedroom each evening. He tries to put space between them now, so that when he’s gone, perhaps it won’t hurt Potter quite so much.
And that lined up pretty well with what Harry had been thinking, so maybe he did look at Draco like that? Oh god,
“Someone would. They
before handing it back.
Harry shrugged, which meant that he hadn’t. “Can’t be anything worse than having my eyeballs melted,” he said sullenly.
The coloured strips decorating the cuffs and hem of the jumper have changed from silver and green, to red and gold. Malfoy blinks, then looks down into the box and blinks again. Around the room, the shelves have suddenly emptied, the coffee table cleared of clutter. Harry’s telly is wrapped securely in an old quilt. In the box by Harry, the books and dragon are gone, replaced by that hideously ugly ceramic statue of a cat in a Victorian gown that Ginny had given him as a housewarming gift, cushioned in a colourful knitted afghan. Harry tucks the afghan more securely around the statue so it doesn’t break.
Harry startles backwards and knocks into the coat with Draco’s wand sticking through the buttonhole, sending it swinging wildly. In the lurching shadows, Harry’s able to make out that the container Draco’s holding is in fact a small tin of lube.
, and Draco climbs into his cot, tugs the blankets over himself, and stares at the vague shapes of his wall in the near-darkness until he slides into sleep.
“You’ve got your cock up my arse, I’m not sure I can really be far away,” Draco points out, but Potter’s stroking him, urging him to move again.
“Harry, have you seen—”
They have a somewhat larger argument over who gets the more spacious of the two bedrooms, with each of them insisting the other take it. Draco wins by pointing out that the elm tree hides the smaller bedroom’s window from view, and that’ll make it easier for him to transform and fly away unnoticed. Potter doesn’t have anything to say to that, so he ends up with the larger room.
“And furthermore! This isn’t even the first time it’s happened! Last time I lost my entire crop of begonias when those bloody nogtails of his ate them! Not just any begonias, either, I specially charm them to grow all year. Have you got any idea how hard it is to get begonias to grow in England in the winter?”
Draco shrugged and set down his own glass. “Well, what big, irreconcilable differences have we got that we can work with?”
And Potter smiles and takes it.
according to that cow,” he grumbles, and Weasley looks up at him.
“But money can’t buy the thrill of making off with it from right under the Ministry’s nose,” Harry said, leaning in. “I know your type. Young and rich and bored, looking for any excuse to break the monotony of your precious pampered life. Probably pocketed sweets from Honeydukes on Hogsmeade weekends—”
When Draco steps out of her Floo, he’s greeted with indecently loud music and Pansy singing along to it.  He finds it an immediate comfort.  He remembers Daphne Greengrass complaining that Pansy used to put on the Weird Sisters every morning while she got dressed before class. So at least some things haven’t changed.
“Herbs,” Draco says. “Lamb’s ear, and dill weed, and rosemary, and peppermint to start with, I think. I might put in a few catmint plants. Maybe some tarragon or thyme.”
“—banging on my ceiling with that Merlin-forsaken
He takes a slow, deep breath through his nose because even the memory of that cold is enough to make him appreciative of the simple joy of clear sinuses.
And Draco looks at him.
“Exactly,” he says, smirking at her. “So would you like to be the kettle or the cauldron?”
“Hey,” Harry protested. “I got used to spending a certain amount of time in bed with a rather fantastic bloke. And since we called it off I’ve had sex once. So, yeah, that’s where my mind went.”
He keeps expecting Potter to confront him about how little work Draco’s doing to research his curse, but it never comes. He keeps catching Potter casting sidelong glances at him. He looks almost as if he wants to say something to Draco, but he closes his mouth and looks away, turns his attention back to his files or whichever book he’s buried his nose in that evening.
The cuts are deep, bleeding freely. One of them slashes straight across the eyes of the skull on his Dark Mark, and it turns Draco’s stomach how the flesh beneath the scarred skin is mottled grey. “No,” he says quietly. “It’s not as bad as it looks. I’ll take care of it here.”
There was Harry, wearing that same determined expression he got right before he flung himself into danger on a mission.
And Draco decides that maybe it’s for the best he didn’t play against Potter. Not when him winning has got Potter smiling at him like that.
The way it was building, Harry expected his orgasm to be a violent, explosive sort of thing, an overwhelming rush of pleasure that blasted through him like a bolt of lightning. Instead, it built and built, higher and tighter, but then instead of a sudden drop, it felt more like a gentle nudge over the edge, a small sweet step from
“Tapas,” Park said, and grinned when Harry looked conflicted. “I know, I know, we’ve still got more work to get through and it’s not as good without the sangria. But we’re going out later, right? I’ll buy you a drink then to make up for it.”
Malfoy’s cold fingers were a shocking counterpoint to the heat of his mouth as he slid them around the back of Harry’s neck and up into his hair. His other hand slipped around the small of Harry’s back, urging him in close, and Harry went to him, his own arms going around Malfoy, his hands sliding up the warm expanse of his back. The Warming Charms Harry had cast on each of them fused in a small shimmer of magic, like two soap bubbles merging.
“So answer it.”
His voice has an edge to it that Draco hasn’t heard before. Something helpless and desperate. He shakes off his drowsiness immediately. Potter’s eyes are fixed on him, intense and predatory. Draco suppresses a shiver as an intoxicating mix of arousal and nerves courses through him. He wonders if Potter can smell it.
And besides. She looks absolutely bloody ridiculous. It’s a small enough irritation, but Draco’s emotional state these days is such that he finds even the smallest annoyances nearly unbearable. With his nerves scraped raw, it doesn’t take much to push him over the edge.
He’d woken up and begun his day in an astonishingly good mood. The previous day, Sunday, had been easier than he’d thought it would be after Saturday evening with Harry. He’d gone to visit his parents in the morning and stayed at the Manor for lunch, and then got some more work done in the afternoon. He’d slept easily that night and woke up this morning feeling wonderfully rested. His 8:00 a.m. class had gone smoothly, and one of his trainees had brought him one of those enormous sugary coffee drinks in an attempt to put him in a good mood. It was something of an open secret that Draco loved those things, but could rarely be bothered to make the trip into Muggle London for them. But all of his trainees were under the impression that fancy coffee drinks put him a good mood and made him less likely to shout at them when they fucked up, and so far Draco had done nothing to disabuse them of that notion.
“Thanks,” Harry mumbled. “I, erm. He’s pretty great.” He felt he should say more than that, but fuck it. He’d never liked talking about his feelings. All the blushing and fumbling for words he was doing probably did more to convince his friends than anything else he could possibly say.
Draco glanced down at himself, then glared at Harry. “Obviously,” he sneered.
Weasley was nodding along like she’d said something wonderfully insightful. “She’s got a point, you know. The only reason Harry doesn’t get into nearly as much trouble as your partner because half the time you beat him to it.”
He cast, and then screwed up his face at the way it tingled through him.
They eat in silence, and then Potter puts on the wireless and hums a little to himself as they do the washing up. When Draco’s down to scouring the last pan, Potter puts on the kettle. Draco rinses the pan and takes up Potter’s abandoned tea towel, wipes it dry, and goes to put it away in the cupboard.
“Merlin’s fucking tits,” Harry said. “Do you ever fucking shut up?”
“But you don’t,” Draco said smugly even though Harry would almost certainly make him pay for that once he did have his wand again. The last time Draco had blatantly poked fun at Harry, in retaliation Harry had Transfigured each and every one of Draco’s quills into a flock of brightly-colored parakeets. They’d all come bursting out in a big flapping, squawking cloud as soon as Draco opened up his desk drawer, and it’d taken him half the morning to collect them again, and of course his favorite golden pheasant feather quill was the very last one he found and un-Transfigured. To this day, Harry denied having any hand in it, but Draco knew better.
Malfoy gives him a sour look and shoves his lighter back into his pocket like he expects Harry to swipe it straight out of his hand and set the mansion on fire right here and now. “Why is that your solution to everything?”
“Why would you do this for me? What do you want in return?” he asked.
“It does happen occasionally,” Ron said cheerfully, toasting Harry with his bottle. “Oh, are you going to do an accent?”
“That,” Potter says, “was one of the most fucked-up things I’ve seen in my life.” He meets Draco’s eyes and very seriously adds, “And I have seen some shit.”
“And would you be all right with a long engagement?”
. So much fun it ought to be illegal. Especially since then Harry, as an Auror-in-training, would be duty-bound to arrest him. There’d be restraints, oh,
“See you at mine?” he asked, even though Harry had already stepped close to him. He shuffled half a step back.
Harry, who’d been drinking his pint and watching the exchange with some amusement, grinned and looked at Draco. “Did you really?”
Tielman takes the list and scans over it, nodded distractedly to himself as he reads. “I believe I’ll be able to help you with all but one of these. The unicorn blood I’ll have to special order for you, but I can have it by—”
“Oh,” says Draco. He hadn’t known, but that certainly explains why it’s so precious to Potter. He’s even more glad, now, that he didn’t go mucking around with the enchantments on it when he added the Notice-Me-Not Charm.
His movements are all small enough that Draco wonders whether Potter’s even aware he’s dancing at all. The thought warms him, that Potter’s relaxed enough around him to—Draco takes a quick peek over his shoulder—oh good Merlin, to shake his arse in time to ridiculous Muggle music. Well, he’s certainly not being subtle anymore, and Draco has to fight to keep himself from grinning as he rinses out the last pot and shuts off the water, because the idea that Potter’s comfortable enough around Draco to dance in front of him warms him even more.
“Good morning,” he says as he let the door fall shut after himself.
Potter snickers. “That was very convincing,” he says.
Draco frowned. “Look, when I put myself in dangerous situations, it’s a calculated risk—”
Harry will never ever—not even if he lives to be a thousand years old—be able to thank the universe enough for allowing Hermione to be part of his life. She’s saved his arse more times than he can count by this point, both literally and figuratively.
It’s so unexpected that Harry just barely clamps down on a wild burst of laughter that would certainly have given them away.
“Malfoy,” Potter says from where he’s half-crouched, peering up at the man’s back. “Take a look at this.”
Draco reached out and fumbled on the nightstand for the jar of lube that quite never seemed to make it back into the drawer. He managed to get the lid off and slicked his fingers, but Harry noticed when Draco shifted to reach down.
“Frances is in St Mungo’s,” Weasley says. “She’ll be fine, but she won’t be out until Monday at the earliest.”
had published a couple dozen or so articles over the years in their own gossip pages: that Malfoy was locked away in the Janus Thickey Ward at St Mungo’s, that Malfoy was off living secretly as a Muggle under an assumed identity with a Muggle wife and a job as a Muggle insurance adjuster, that Malfoy was dead and had been for years.
Harry looked up at her. “It’s February.”
Sometimes it felt as though everyone except for him had managed to move on. To rebuild their lives and move forward. To leave the War behind. Ron had been accepted into the Auror program at the Ministry and was busy with training. Hermione had tracked down her parents in Australia and brought them home again. George had brought Lee in as a partner for his joke shop and they were working on expanding the business, and Ginny had been invited to attend the Holyhead Harpies summer training camp, and Luna and her father were busy rebuilding their home, and Neville and Hannah had surprised everyone by eloping. They’d returned a few weeks ago from their honeymoon in Spain and were just days away from the grand opening of their own little flower shop in Hogsmeade.
“Draco, I’m gonna…”
To keep himself busy, Harry took up the rag Desmond had abandoned on the counter and picked up where he’d left off, polishing the butter knife and nestling it neatly away into its red-velvet-padded slot in the polished mahogany box of silver.
Weasley starts to say something else, but a flash of light across the street catches their attention and instantly both of them are all business. The light above the shop door has just turned on.
Several rounds later, the hopelessness and despair that Draco had been worried about earlier had caught up with him and set in. If anything, the drinks had made it worse, had sharpened his longing into something huge and painful, had made it even more difficult for him to keep himself from being so bloody obvious about it. He was trying, Merlin he was trying. But Harry was also
A shadow fell over the page of the book. “I’m not sure what you’ve been learning in that anatomy class of yours, but I’m pretty sure that last one’s not part of the skull.”
portion of their friendship, when he’d brought some of his work home with him, and Harry had nearly thrown up his dinner the minute they’d come tumbling out of the Floo. Malfoy had locked down the cursed object under heavy-duty Dampening Spells, and they’d had their first Occlumency lesson that very night.
“I just can?” he says, faintly surprised that Potter can’t feel the strange thread of magic reverberating through the body like a wrong note. “Some people are more sensitive to magic than others.”
“Harry, you—” He blinked rapidly. The paper bag tilted dangerously in his grasp. “How the bloody hell did you—”
“I’m off now,” Ron said, lingering in the doorway. “Are you sure you don’t want to come.”
Ron shrugged. “I don’t know what a Hubert looks like, to be honest. Mostly I think you still just look like a Harry. Even with…” He paused, gesturing vaguely to Harry’s person, “…all that.”
In his wildest fantasies, Harry rolls over and presses a sleepy kiss to Malfoy’s mouth. He wouldn’t have done that this morning, of course, but Harry’s also had a whole series of fantasies about the slope where Malfoy’s neck and shoulder meet, about how soft and warm it would feel beneath a gentle brush of his lips, and how Harry would tuck his nose in and breathe in the smell of his sleepy skin. Kissing his way along Malfoy’s collarbones was perfectly fine, as per their rules, and Harry would have tugged the V-neck of his sweater aside and taken full advantage of that. He
It was close to supper when he finally cleared out the last shelf.
be, according to my great-great-aunt Esther.”
“No,” Harry sighed. “Hermione already offered, anyhow.”
Somehow, even with an arrow sticking out of him, it hadn’t quite seemed real until he’d said the words aloud just now.
“Like an unexpected orgy?” Malfoy sounds deeply amused, damn him.
His cock flopped heavily against his belly, flushed dark pink and glistening with precome at the tip. Harry dragged his fingers up the underside, reveling in the feel of how hard it was, how hot, how soft and delicate the skin felt. He heard Malfoy's breath catch, and Harry wrapped his hand around the hard length of his cock and gave it a nice firm squeeze.
It’s cold inside the tent, and even under Draco’s enchanted blanket he’s still chilly.
Draco eyes the bed dubiously, because right now the alternative is eyeing Potter as he strips off his shirt and pulls on the clean one, and he’s pretty sure that way lies madness. “I’m fairly certain this qualifies.” There’s a black spot on the comforter that looks like a cigarette burn, and he suspects that might be the nicest of what’s on it.
on the pillow behind him so he can sit up a little higher. He settles against it, mindful of the injuries on his back.
Potter gives him a glance over his shoulder. “What?”
Draco’s wrapped around himself and catches him square in the chest.
“I wish I could remember,” Potter says, then then looks startled by his admission.
“Draco?”
He opens his eyes, watches Potter’s toes flex, the tendons standing out stark as they stretch over his instep, then curl against the tile floor.
“Sure,” Potter says, and taps each one with his wand while muttering the spell. “Do you, erm. Do you need help bathing?”
“Won’t get you sent home,” he says.
It’s not until after Potter says, very eloquently, “Oh,” that Draco realises what a stupid thing that was to say. Potter’s only lost the last two years of his memories; Draco has owned his shop for nearly four.
Abruptly, Malfoy releases the collar of Harry’s jumper only to snag the hem and ruck it up. A moment later he sets to work sucking a series of biting kisses down Harry’s spine while his hands slip around to work the button and zip of Harry’s fly open. Harry reaches down to try to help, and Malfoy slaps his hands away before doing it himself, and his mouth reaches Harry’s waistband just in time for him to tug the trousers down to Harry’s thighs.
Sucking in a furious breath through his teeth, Harry shook his head and tucked Draco’s face into the crook of his neck. The implication was clear without saying the words aloud. Lucius meant for him to take the Mark.
But it was so much worse now. He made a promise — a promise he never intended to break because it would break the man to whom he’d made it. It was the promise Harry clung to in the Forest of Dean, in Gringotts and the Ministry. The promise that kept him going when he felt like giving up during the interminable months wearing that damned locket. The promise that encouraged his magic to burn Nagini’s venom from his body, even as visions of blond hair and bright smiles filled his mind in delirium.
The cup flared again and absolutely no one was surprised by Viktor Krum’s appointment as Durmstrang’s champion. An electric hum of magic buzzed in Harry’s ears as the crowd waited on tenterhooks for the last announcement.
“Why?” he whispered, worrying his ragged cuticles. “Why did you help me this summer? Why help me now?”
“Headmaster, Mr. Potter is here to request a re-sort. If you would like an abbreviated version of events, I’m certain Professor McGonagall or myself can provide it. Though, I’m fairly certain you’re already aware of the events that have culminated in the necessity for such drastic action,” he said, lip curling in a snarl.
Humming in approval when she finished, Hermione said, “Okay, let’s test it out real quick. Send me a message, Harry.”
Severus handed him a glass of water, glaring daggers at McGonagall when he downed it in seconds. “Mr. Potter, are you able to explain the reason for your panic attack?” Severus asked kindly.
Shooting him a strained smile, he said, “That’s alright, Professor. I appreciate the thought, though my problems with Gryffindor are exactly why we’re all here. Um, Theo, can you tell him what you found?”
Resisting the urge to roll his eyes at his godfather’s dramatics, he trailed obediently in his wake. Once they were a safe distance from the Great Hall, they surreptitiously ducked into an empty classroom. Severus instantly warded the chamber for privacy but held up a hand to forestall Draco’s questions.
“Of course, ve vill. Dey ‘ave lost zeir minds, dere iz no doubt,” Fleur hissed, her accent more pronounced after her tirade.
supposedly stronger and...why are you laughing?” Draco demanded, whirling around to glare at him.
Arching a perfectly shaped eyebrow at him, she drawled, “Or would you rather marry me simply because our fathers wish it? What about the Greengrass girls? I heard a rumour they were candidates for the Malfoy heir, as well.”
He suddenly doubted Albus was ever unaware of Sirius Black’s innocence, which might be why Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump Dumbledore never pressed for a trial. Veritaserum would’ve easily proven Black’s story about Pettigrew and granted him custody of Harry, instead of the Dursleys, making the boy less malleable for Albus’ schemes.
Swallowing hard against the lump in his throat, Draco rasped, “Health exam.”
“But?” Draco coaxed gently, his stomach tying itself in knots over the crushing fear flooding the soul bond.
The icy glares and jeers of their classmates were immediate, but his re-emergence into Hogwarts society flanked by Slytherins made things worse. He should have expected it, especially after disappearing for an entire day following his announcement as the fourth champion, but after being safely sequestered for the afternoon the furor caused by his arrival unnerved him.
“Of course, dear,” she replied, enlarging the space further to accommodate four people as Severus entered. Noticing Harry’s lip-biting habit with a frown, Pomfrey added a robust silencing spell to ensure the boy’s privacy.
Holding them as requested, the small group watched with bated breath as the witch carefully layered the spells. Draco’s eyes widened under the cloak as she activated them with a Protean Charm, then added a flagrante spell, and finally sealed an intricate communication charm into the metal without even breaking a sweat.
everything he gave him. Gripping him lightly by the hips, Draco shuffled him closer, swallowing his soulmate’s needy whimpers with pride. When Harry unconsciously rocked against his thigh, revealing his excitement however, Draco leapt back as though burned.
Severus noted the slight tremble of the boy’s hand when he took a steadying sip of the amber liquid before crossing the room and taking a seat. They sat quietly for a while, lost in thought and alcohol, before Severus spoke.
“Bathroom’s down the hall, if you need it,” Draco informed him. “I can either stay here and do homework or guard the room against unwanted visitors in the commons. Your choice. I want you to feel comfortable enough that you can get some decent sleep.”
“Madam Pomfrey, I assume that because of patient-healer confidentiality you cannot share the results of this with anyone, is that correct?” Severus asked, tone rigid as steel.
“I could say the same for you,” Harry admitted with a grin. “It’s a miracle I ever caught the Snitch when you were in the air with me.” Leaning back slightly he drank in the sight of Draco flushed and panting and aching against his thigh. “God, you’re gorgeous, especially like this. Because of me,
“Thank you,” Harry murmured, drinking deeply. Dumbledore nodded and gestured to the pitcher in question to Draco, who mutely declined.
Shuffling to the common room, he caught Blaise’s eye and jerked his head before retreating to the hall to wait. In mere moments, his friends met him in the corridor and obediently followed him to Crabbe and Goyle’s room. The other occupants took one look at Draco’s face and scattered, clicking the door shut behind them.
magic awoke to heal the bruised and battered body of a child who suffered daily at the hands of those meant to love him.
“Think he’ll talk about it?” Blaise asked.
“That is positively Slytherin,” Draco smirked.
“That’s the most likely,” Draco nodded. “Severus hasn’t named anyone he believes is suspicious yet, but he’s keeping an ear to the ground.”
“I lied,” he replied with a dismissive shrug.
“So, when I was face-to-face with a cute boy without my father around, I fell into old habits because I didn’t know how else to behave. I stupidly thought my name would be enough to convince you I was worth knowing because it worked with my other friends. Every time I’ve goaded you into a fight was a desperate plea for your attention. Even your animosity was better than nothing. I just wanted you to see me,” Draco whispered forlornly.
“Yes,” Draco said, dragging out the word with a frown. “Does Gryffindor not offer Sanctuary to those who need it?” Harry shrugged helplessly and Draco scowled, muttering darkly under his breath.
Harry’s lips twitched and Draco snorted until their composure crumbled and they crowed with laughter, burning off the residual unease that came with any discussion of Voldemort. Harry watched the boy he once considered an enemy double over, the sound of his genuine amusement filling up the cavernous room. It was deep and rich when it wasn’t laced with malicious intent, and to finally hear it up close instead of in broken snippets across a crowded hall felt like the beginning of something foundational between them.
“I’m alive, baby. I had a promise to keep,” Harry soothed through his sniffles.
The rush of excited whispers died under Snape’s quelling glare.
Harry held it out to him with a broad grin. “Well, you get to wear it this time. I reckon it wouldn’t be wise for people to see us walking to the Headmaster’s office together. You might have to crouch a bit to hide your feet, but it will do the job.”
The delicate cup rattled on its saucer when Narcissa set it down with a tad too much force. “Is that a problem, Lucius?” she asked coldly. Waving her hand to the pair, she bit out, “Is it too much to hope you might be happy for our son?”
Angry splotches of color bloomed on Ginny’s face, and she quivered with rage. “What the
Silver eyes flashed when Draco abruptly leaned forward with a sneer. “Did you know Gryffindor House doesn’t offer Sanctuary? I asked because it shocked him to learn Slytherin would take in outsiders. He’d never heard of it.”
Malfoy looked at him suspiciously. Had Harry said that too quickly? He’d probably said that too quickly. But Malfoy shook his head and went back to his tea, and Harry let it go.
“Hey,” Draco said, catching Harry’s attention. He nodded at a small cafe tucked between a stationery shop and an apothecary. “Fancy a cup of coffee to help us sober up?”
Draco’s mind flashed back to how casually Harper had picked out the ruby ring on display in the counter, or how he’d gone after each of the objects in the shop one by one, as unerringly as if they were singing out his name. “Of course I haven’t forgotten any of that,” he said, keeping his voice low through sheer effort of will alone. “But I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself, thank you.”
“For fuck’s sake, Draco,” Pansy shouts back as she comes stomping into view. She’s wearing Muggle jeans and a black jumper, her hair pulled back into a loose bun. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen her dressed so casual, including when he walked in on her in her underthings the other night, and for a moment it distracts him from the irritation writ plain across her face. That doesn’t last long because then she opens her mouth. “It’s the middle of the bloody day, and shouldn’t you be at work? I was in the middle of—” She breaks off when she gets a look at his face, sees something that makes her sigh. “Fine. Come on through.”

Draco took a deep breath and pushed the button for the Atrium. “Before we do any of that, I think I should tell you… My name isn’t really Desmond…”
He’s been so busy over the past few months trying to hide his own feelings that he’d never once stopped to think about Potter’s. But now that he’s paying attention, it’s as obvious as that framed photograph they’ve put in the entryway. Potter hadn’t suddenly gone so strained and awkward because he’d seen how painfully and blatantly obvious Draco’s feelings for him were. He’d gone strained and awkward because his own feelings were just as plain.
—has sunk in deep, swelling up so big inside you that you feel you can’t contain it, warmth and shivery excitement spiked with sharp bursts of fear that he’s wrong, what if he’s wrong?
And sometimes—not often, and only for an instant—Harry caught Malfoy looking at him like maybe he was thinking the same.
The moment passes. Pansy finishes up her drink and Potter holds out a menu to her and offers to buy the next round.
Twenty minutes put Harry still in decontamination, exactly as Draco had expected. “Thanks. Oh,” He hefted his bag. “These are the things Potter was wearing when he was exposed, is there somewhere I should take them?”
“No,” Draco says quickly, putting one hand over Potter’s thigh. Part of him is irritated that Potter thinks so little of Draco, but he swallows it down. Potter is sensitive about this. And it’s going to take a while for him to get past the way Draco reacted in the kitchen that first night. “I just don’t want to hurt you. That’s all.”
This is his favourite part of brewing. There’s something deeply soothing about reducing a stack of ingredients to small, uniform pieces. He finishes dicing just as the cauldron’s beginning to release faint curls of tangy steam. Draco dumps the mushrooms in, gives them a good stir, and when they’re just beginning to sweat he quickly adds the rest of the ingredients, finishing with a generous glug of flobberworm mucus. The recipe doesn’t call for it, but he finds it thickens the brew up quite nicely. He turns up the heat and takes a breath.
But that was all right with Draco.
“That leaves me at least fifteen percent?” Harry murmurs, leaning in to nip at Draco’s bottom lip, then grins at him and waggles his eyebrows. “I can work with that.”
, and it’d be a thousand different sorts of stupid to start anything with him. Potter’s a killer and Draco’s not exactly a saint himself. The two of them together would be like iron oxide and aluminium powder. All it’d take is one spark to set off an uncontrollable fire. And the way he and Potter clash, they’re nothing
“It’s toast I didn’t have to make for myself. That makes all the difference,” Draco corrects, and that gets a laugh out of Potter.
Harry dropped his hands. His fingers had left a smudge on the right lens of his glasses. “I reckon you’d know all about moaning and swooning properly.”
A few minutes later, the hooded figure exits the shop, lingers in the doorway for a moment. A sudden gust of wind catches the hem of his cloak, revealing the bottom few inches of the gaudy yellow robes he wears beneath in the instant before he Disapparates.
Unmitigated.
Hermione and Draco exchanged a look, then Hermione shook her head and shrugged at him and turned away to make herself a mug of tea.
Zelda goes back out into the front of the shop, and Draco follows her, still frowning. He’d known that Jewish people couldn’t eat certain things, but he’d never connected the dots and thought that some of those things might be in potions.
, of course.”
"Seeing how well you take
It’s such a blatant lie that Harry nearly laughs. He knows for a fact that Draco doesn’t hate his friends. He and Ron just got together on their own for a pint earlier this week, and Harry knows that Draco and Hermione have become pen pals of a sort, owling each other long debates on the finer points of magical theory because it turns out the two of them are a couple of giant nerds. It hasn’t been that long since the War, but Draco has worked hard to make amends. His friendship with Harry’s friends, in fact, predates his relationship with Harry by a significant number of months.
“My snake is plenty enormous,” Harry said mildly. “Or so you’ve told me. Just last night, I believe.” And while Draco was rendered utterly speechless by the sheer
“I’m going to go get another cuppa. Can I get you one, too?”
Draco thinks they ought to have given Van Middlesworth the open seat, but Lovegood presents a surprisingly good case for Downer, and they debate the point until Potter comes back from getting his arse kicked at darts. He squeezes in between Draco and Lovegood and steals the rest of Draco’s drink.
Malfoy reaches down and wraps a hand around his cock, working him in firm, quick strokes just the way Harry likes, and Harry’s pleasure mounts higher, higher, higher. He whines low in his throat. The instant before he comes, he thinks inanely,
“Shut up,” Draco says. “It could happen.”
After breakfast, the four of them cleaned up the kitchen, and then Ron and Hermione went upstairs, leaving Draco and Harry to the part of the day that Harry had been sort of dreading.
“He’s in St Mungo’s,” Weasley says. “Hermione just contacted me. She and Clarke and Elise caught his case.”
As he watches the door fall shut behind her, Draco sighs and shakes his head a little to himself. First Potter, now Granger. There’s only one left of the Golden Trio, and despite his surprisingly civil interactions with the two so far, Draco can’t quite bring himself to picture the same happening with the Weasel. In fact, Draco wonders whether Granger even intends to tell him where the potions she just purchased came from, because he’d bet his last dented Knut that Weasley will refuse to take them if she does. And wouldn’t Draco just love to be a fly on the wall for
He’d only just finished when Celene tapped lightly on the door and pushed it open. “He’s here,” she said.
“Sorry,” he says, taking his hand away from Potter’s head. “But sleeping on the sofa will give you a crick in your neck.”
Potter leads the way to the pub, and they find they’re among the last to arrive.
“What about the ones you gave me?” Harry asked. “Did those mean something?”
“Hermione’s not horrible,” Harry said. Because she wasn’t, mostly. At least when compared to Pansy. “Pansy’s the horrible one. Hermione’s just convinced she’s always right.”
“All right,” Ron says, standing, and Harry can hear that same patient, gentle, pitying tone in his voice that he heard in Felicity’s. He loops an arm over Harry’s shoulders, ushering him out of the cubicle down the corridor. “Why don’t we take a break, get a cuppa?”
“Thank Merlin,” Malfoy said with such heartfelt relief that it made Harry laugh. “I’m rubbish at that sort of thing.”
“All right,” Draco says.
* * * * *
When the table had overturned, everything on it had gone flying. Including the cauldrons. From the splash patterns on the floor, Draco guessed that it had rebounded off the inside of Harry’s Shield Charm, dousing him from head to toe in cobalt blue in the process.
“Please,” Draco says, a bit desperately.
No, the point of contention between them is the cooking. More precisely, Potter’s cooking. Somewhere over the years, he’s become some sort of health-obsessed nutter in the kitchen, which is absolutely ridiculous because Draco clearly remembers him loading up his plate with bacon every morning at Hogwarts, and god, Draco would just about kill for bacon right now. But Potter’s the one who organized their food supply and there’s none to be found.
And then he’d pulled himself together, decided to open his shop, and had been in motion ever since.
After dinner, everyone pitches in to clean up. The kitchen is crowded, everyone talking and laughing as they trip over each other and fall into their tasks of clearing the table and washing and drying and putting away. Draco lingers awkwardly on the outskirts of the action, until Arthur invites him into the living room where Percy and Audrey are already at work, sorting through the presents piled beneath the tree, getting them organised and ready to hand out.
“I’ve already called for a cab for us. I hope you don’t mind,” Potter says as he wipes his hands dry on a tea towel. He glances up at the clock. “It should be here soon."
And Draco thinks of their cosy little home and the baked chicken he’s got planned for dinner and an evening spent in quiet companionship on the sofa, and how getting there will take a long motorcycle ride with his arms wrapped snug around Potter’s waist. And he wants to get to that now. He flicks his wand, and the door locks and the sign flips from
, anyone, worth loving—
“What was that?” Malfoy asked from behind Harry.
To complicate matters, Draco was in training to become a Healer, and his training program was every bit as rigorous as Harry’s. They’d moved in together after just a couple of months, more to be able to see each other than because they’d reached that point in their relationship. And yeah, they’d probably rushed into it a bit, but somehow it hadn’t blown up in their faces.
Ron held out his elbows—of the three of them, he was the best at Blind Apparition—and Harry and Malfoy each took an arm. Harry took a moment to cast a temporary ward around the shop, and then they were gone.
“That’s not why I’m up here,” he says.
Harry groaned and put his head down. “Trade you,” he said into the table. “It’s someone else’s turn to deal with this. I don’t care that they had to send back…” He lifted his head and squinted down at the papers before him. “...seventy-two vials of contaminated nogtail blood on November 6th. Knowing that isn’t helpful at all, it’s not worth being blinded over.” He put his head back down.
He turns to her, alarmed. “You’re not going to say—”
Draco scowls at Pansy. There’s no doubt in his mind that she’s going to tell him all about it the moment Draco’s out of earshot.
right then and there, doesn't even bother to read the rest of the list, which is rather a shame because the whole thing is wonderful. Potter's brain truly is a thing of terrifying beauty.
“Well, I did say you’d have to ask nicely, first off,” Malfoy said with an expectant lift of his eyebrows.
Malfoy pushed Harry gently back again. “Ready to go home?” he asked.
“I wasn’t even thinking of that,” Harry said, pausing in the middle of the room. “But now I am.”
“I don’t understand why anyone would think it’s appropriate to use on Ministry forms,” Harry said miserably.
Molly looked over at him. “Did it work?” she asked, even though he could tell from the half-smile on her face that she knew that it had.
Even with Myrtle he can’t risk speaking plainly about his assignment. Instead he’s forced to talk in circles around the topic, hinting at it here, alluding to it there. Not that he’s afraid she’d let it slip to someone by accident—even the other ghosts don’t seem to want anything to do with her so who would she tell?—but a secret is only truly
The clock strikes nine. Draco flips the sign in his window to
, Draco thinks desperately and then, too late, Potter’s gone. He turns back to face Potter’s friends. Weasley’s still watching Draco suspiciously, so he turns to Granger.
And on and on and on.
As soon as he gets his trousers up and his flies fastened, Draco wheels on him and gives Harry a shove that nearly knocks him off the stoop. “We. Are. OUTSIDE.”
Harry smiled to himself in the darkness. “Deal,” he said.
But Draco had no idea how to make it stop.
While he dragged them on, Draco fiddled with his Emergency Portkey, a very small pewter picture frame missing the glass and the backing. It gave a pulse of magic, letting him know it was ready and counting down.
The frown smooths away. “And this has happened three times so far?” Potter asks. He picks up his wine for the first time and takes a sip, then makes a face when he swallows, sucking his tongue against the roof of his mouth.
Well. At least Harry hadn’t done anything wonderfully brave and foolish to earn himself a stay in St Mungo’s this time. If anything, this time Draco was forced to put a large part of the blame on himself for not simply
Honestly, he had no idea why he even bothered to read the
“No,” Harry said, laughing a little now. “Really? They both picked up on it?”
Draco stares at Potter, because he doesn’t know Granger all that well, but he knows enough to recognise that she could be danger. She’s wickedly smart, and the very minute she gets the slightest inkling that something’s off, she’s like a crup with a bone. She won’t stop until she’s reached the truth.
“Get my bag,” Harry tells him. Like Hermione, he’s prepared for almost every eventuality. He’s got enough healing potions stashed away to supply a small hospital.
He tries to keep himself occupied until then, but doesn’t succeed very well. He tends to his herb garden and chats briefly with Mrs Field before he pleads a headache and goes back inside. He casts a few charms to straighten up the place, and washes all the dishes Potter left in the sink. He makes a cup of tea, forgets about it for thirty minutes, tosses out the overbrewed mess, and then makes another and doesn’t drink it. Since he’s home, he might as well make something nice for dinner, yeah? Something that takes a little more time than he’s usually got. He and Potter will both deserve something nice after the terrible conversation they’re about to have. But he’ll have to go to the store, he hasn’t got anything here, and—
“Erm,” he said as Malfoy came a few steps closer.
“I’d like to point out that we found you,” Draco says, laying a restraining hand on Potter’s arm.
“Can I have your sword?” Potter asks.
- - - - -
to illume the dim room, chasing back the shadows to reveal a basement-cum-potions lab so cluttered and messy and
He goes into the downstairs toilet and locks the door after himself before he sinks down onto the closed lid of the toilet and slumps forward, face in his hands. For long minutes, he breathes. In, and out, and in, and out. The tile floor is cold beneath his socked feet, and he presses down with his toes and lets it ground him.
Potter stares at him, then sighs. “Christ, you’d feel like a right arsehole if you were wrong, wouldn’t you?” he says, but goes over to the coffee table and reaches under it, murmurs a
Draco stares at him. “They won’t question it. My parents know I’m gay.”
“I’m plenty agreeable,” Harry protested. “I’ve agreed with you about plenty of things before.”
Harper grinned. “I’d be disappointed if you didn’t.”
“Harry?”
Facing himself in the spotty mirror above the dingy little sink, Draco drew his wand. The threads of magic holding his Glamour together were easy enough to unravel and he could do so with one quick yank of intent, but he always preferred to do it facing a mirror, to do it slowly, to see for himself as Desmond Dwyer melted away and Draco Malfoy once more took his place.
“No,” he said. “I want to feel you opening me up. I want to feel this tomorrow.” If tonight was all he got, he wanted to hold onto the feel of it for as long as he could.
Potter shrugs. “Does it matter?”
Draco’s gaze flickered back to the doorway. “I need to notify my IUMC contact. And I think that you ought to come with me when I do.”
“Oh,” Harry groaned, head dropping forward. “Oh, fuck.
, and you’d take it as a challenge.”
“Ugh,” Harry said, flopping back against the pillows after she left again. He tapped Draco’s wand idly against his thigh, setting off little puffs of silvery sparks. “I can’t wait to get out of here.”
, that his father loves him. He loves Draco, and he supported him through opening his apothecary, and he has accepted that one day Draco will fall in love with another man and marry him. But a shopkeeper is a
“I don’t owe you anything,” Potter says very seriously. “I’m not here out of obligation, Malfoy. After everything we’ve been through, haven’t you figured that out yet?”
Harry tells himself firmly, and runs through the list at top speed of all the things he has done to it and would like to do to it again.
Potter shrugs. “I was pretty drained from Apparating. Spells barely worked at all, didn’t have enough extra magic in ‘em to fuck with anything. Didn’t leave enough of a trail for anyone to track.”
. Draco wonders if it’s because of him that Potter’s like this, or if Potter’s just like this around everyone now. For a moment he’s tempted to push him—he bets Potter would have an absolute fit if Draco tried to have a cigarette right now—but instead Draco gropes beneath his seat, finds the lever, and slides the seat back as far as it’ll go, both to give himself some extra legroom, and also to get himself out of Potter’s peripheral vision.
Potter looks even more amused. “In that case, I’m sure we haven’t got anything to worry about.”
He nudges his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, peruses the neat row of labels, and pulls out the last folder he needs and tucks it into his bag, then eases the filing drawer closed. He turns to leave. He’s done everything here he’d meant to.
. He wasn’t sure he was successful, but he shrugged. “Just tired.”
. And it’s Draco’s fault. He dragged Potter into this, selfishly hoping that Potter would save him, and all he’d succeeded in doing was handing over another victim to whoever’s trying to kill him. And the only reason they were able to get to Potter was because Draco tried to kiss him, Draco tried to press for more and then Potter had been distracted and upset when he went outside. If Draco hadn’t tried to kiss him, this wouldn’t have happened. His breath hitches.
, there he was fantasizing about Harry in Draco’s bedroom, not even a run-of-the-mill sex fantasy, just Harry wearing soft clothes and being comfortable in Draco’s private space. Honestly, he thought he’d be able to handle this better if it
Potter taps his wand to the book and murmurs the spell again, and Draco leans over to see where they are. And then blinks at where the dot’s turned up.
"Surprises?" Harry asked, exchanging a look with Ron.
, because Draco was about to hex him senseless.
“What?”
He shouldn’t be thinking that. He shouldn’t be thinking like that at all, but fuck it. It was late, Draco was a little bit drunk, and that was all it was. Tomorrow, when he was sober and rested and his head was clear, it’d all become simple again. Fake flirtation for the sake of the investigation. That’s all it was.
Then Dean set Harry up with Sheila, who thought Harry was very nice but said she was moving to Canada next month and didn’t want to carry on a long-distance relationship with a man she’d just met. Next, Dean set Harry up on a date with James, with whom Harry had a very nice evening, shared a very nice goodnight kiss, and who then never called him back. After James came Francis, a friend of a friend of Hannah Abbott, who shouted at the waitress during dinner and made her cry. Harry apologized to the waitress, and walked out on his date then and there, and poor Hannah was mortified when he later told her what’d happened.
Draco swallows against his dry throat and looks from his mother to his father and back again, curls his fingers into his thigh and presses hard. Why did he say anything? He shouldn’t have said anything at all about his preferences. He should have told his parents he was moving to London and left it at that. He’s made it this long without breathing a whisper about how he likes men, and it’s not as if he has anyone special in his life to force the matter. He should have let this sleeping crup lie.
Harry moved out of the Burrow at the end of the year. He’d resisted at first, but Ron was moving out. Even though Molly and Arthur had both assured Harry that he was more than welcome to live with them as long as he liked, he still felt a bit as though he’d be imposing on them to stay at the Burrow when all of their own children had moved out.
So he hasn’t asked, but that doesn’t stop him from wondering. Constantly wondering. Obsessing, really, if he’s being perfectly honest about it. Not that
Potter gives Draco a perplexed look over his shoulder. “All right, but you do realise that makes no—You’re dressed.”
Draco’s job is simple: he’s to go inside and make contact with the proprietor, buy something as illegal as he can get away with, and then leave.
It might be the decor; though there wasn't a single stone block or hanging tapestry in sight, something about the place had always reminded Harry of Hogwarts. Or maybe it was just that Malfoy's place wasn't Grimmauld. Harry had lived there for eight years now, but had never quite settled. Sometimes he thought about moving, but it seemed a bit silly to own a whole house and then go live somewhere else. Plus, Harry had seen what Ron and Hermione went through when they were looking for a place of their own, and he had no desire whatsoever to face the London real estate market himself.
To balance that out, Pansy got a small bottle of hellishly expensive perfume and he sent along a colourful silk scarf for Luna. Lucy’s still sulking in her alcove from being forced to make the delivery for him.
“Don’t press your luck,” he replies, and it gives him no small measure of satisfaction to shout it down the stairs at her.
“Twice in a row!” Draco crowed, smiling bright enough to practically outshine the sun. “I had no idea you could be so agreeable, Potter!”
He’s only spoken to Potter once since then, the morning after. Madam Pomfrey had cleared them both to return to class. Draco had taken his time dressing, hoping that Potter would be gone by the time he finished. Instead he’d found Potter waiting for him by the door.
“Might’ve been,” Weasley said easily, putting the milk away. “And even if it wasn’t, I’m willing to take that one. At least the car didn’t breathe fire,
And then Potter asks him, “How was your day?” with just a touch of awkwardness, as if they’re a pair of old acquaintances who’d unexpectedly bumped into each other and didn’t know what else to say. They’ll probably end up discussing the weather, next.
“Yes, your robes are fine,” Draco says, eyeing the way Potter’s hair flops over his forehead. “I suppose your hair’s fine, too. I doubt anyone would even recognise you if you changed it.” He breathes out. “Come along. We might as well get this over with.”
There’s a scar nestled in the slight hollow between his Achilles tendon and the bony knob of his ankle. It’s shiny pink and shaped like a small lightning bolt. Draco’s only seen one other scar like it in his lifetime, and everyone in the Wizarding world knows exactly what spell made it.
“Brilliant,” Harry said, gaze going momentarily distant, and Draco didn’t need Legilimency to know that Harry was envisioning it.
“You’ve got a bloody code for it?” Harry stared at them in disbelief. A bloody
Draco tosses the letter onto the top of his file cabinets, and opens the cupboard above them to look through his own personal stash of potions. He gets down a little jar of medicinal paste that accelerates the healing of minor cuts. Draco brews it himself and keeps it handy for owl-inflicted injuries. He rubs a smear of it over his thumb and puts the jar away. It tingles intensely, but it’ll subside in a minute or two, and when he wipes it off five minutes later the cut will be gone.
Draco slanted him a glare. “Really? Because I distinctly remember rather a lot of talking when you—” He broke off with a sudden horrified look, and Harry, who had a pretty good idea of which occasion exactly Draco was referring to, felt himself blush hotly.
Which she did, eventually. She gave him a smile, then stole a spring roll and wandered out of the room.
“I’ve been looking for you for ten years,” Malfoy says, pulling his feet up under him on the couch. “Did you know?”
Potter snorts and doesn’t look up from his book. “No you won’t.”
“So,” he says. “How do you want to do this? From here? From your shop?”
“Draco’s team can have Hermione as their extra player,” Weasley says. “She can barely hold onto the broom.”
Malfoy looks over at him. “What do you mean?”
Draco realises with a start that he’s been caught staring. “Oh. Ah, no thank you. I’m fine,” he says, toasting Potter with his half-eaten sandwich. “That smells good is all.”
Harry was especially looking forward to that part. It’d been at least a few weeks since they’d attempted anything more energetic than half-asleep morning handjobs, and Harry couldn’t wait to have a go at Malfoy’s arse. Or for Malfoy have a go at his. Harry knew he’d get a fantastic orgasm out of it either way, so he’d probably let Malfoy choose; he usually had a stronger preference than Harry did about whether he felt like topping or bottoming at any given moment.
“What’s all this?” Harry asked when he opened the door to Draco standing on his doorstep with an armload of flowers and chocolate and wine. “I told you that you didn’t need to bring anything.”
“Ten minutes, okay?” Potter says. He doesn’t turn around. He doesn’t take his hand off the doorknob. “I just need some air. Give me ten minutes and we’ll talk about this. Okay?”
“So what did you find out, aside from how paperwork flows through the Ministry?” Draco asks.
When Zelda comes back, he leaves her to mind the front and goes into his lab. For a moment he’s tempted to slip through the doorway to his secondary space, but several of the ingredients he needs are non-kosher and he can’t bring himself to contaminate that space. It’s not immediately obvious that the potion he’s brewing involves blood magic until the very end; if Zelda interrupts him, she won’t be able to tell he’s doing anything suspicious.
And Merlin help him, forging friendships with Gryffindors. If his sixteen-year-old self could see him now he’d probably faint dead away.
It occurred to him in a sudden rush that Desmond was an Unspeakable. Which, yes, obviously, but if Desmond was an Unspeakable then that meant that he was one of the good guys. He and Harry were on the same team here. Harry had spent the last week or so wrestling down his burgeoning attraction to Desmond and wallowing in conflict over feeling attracted to a criminal in the first place, and when he’d completely fucked up last night and kissed him, he’d spent today beating himself up over it for much the same reason. But if Desmond—or whoever he truly was—was an Unspeakable, then that meant that
But his voice was warm and affectionate, and his fingers were rubbing over that spot just behind Harry’s ear that felt so good, so Harry let it go. “Say whatever you want about me so long as you keep doing that,” he mumbled, turning his face into his pillow to give Draco better access to his hair.
Malfoy made a very convenient target for that anger. But as much as Harry wished that he could blame him for everything wrong in his life, it wasn’t Malfoy’s fault that after that final battle, Harry had felt like a car that’d run out of road. His whole life up to that point had been clearly laid out before him, and when he’d found himself finished with no prophesy and no war to further guide his way, he’d come to a stop. And by the time he’d been able to make himself start moving forward again, it felt like everyone else had moved on so far ahead of him he’d never catch up.
Malfoy smiled at him, big and bright and a little muzzy, and toasted Harry with his wine glass. Harry suspected that this wasn’t his first glass of blood. “Pumpkin,” he said with an elegant little nod in greeting.
Draco reaches into his pocket and feels around until his fingers find a small bit of metal. He shouldn’t be doing this, but curiosity overrides logic. He stares hard at a spot on the back of Potter’s chair that’s mostly in shadow and
All Harry knew for sure was that Malfoy kept the Manor in good repair, paid his taxes each year, and so far as anyone could tell, didn’t venture out in public at all.
“I see,” Cartwright said. He set his quill aside and tapped the memo with his wand. The square of paper folded itself up into a paper aeroplane and zoomed out of the office. “It’s unfortunate that you found yourself mixed up in this. But I’m sure you’ll understand that in an operation as crucial as this one, we can’t allow any loose threads.”
“Pressure,” Malfoy says in warning.
Because—
“She’s fine,” Malfoy says again. “She’s okay.”
If he’s got to do this, he hopes that at least he can spare Malfoy from having to stand right here as he does.
“Williams is a tattle-tale. He’ll tell me the minute I come back if anyone skives off.” He carefully settles the goggles over his glasses, and moves his head in a slow turn to look around the room. “Whoa.”
Harry focused on his breakfast for a slow count of five, then very casually let himself look at Draco as Draco stood at the counter to serve himself crepes and tea. He wore robes today, his hair still a little damp from his shower, neatly parted on the left and swept to the side. His feet were bare and very pale against the dark tile floor. Harry looked away as Draco finished serving himself and rounded the table to sit by Hermione. Harry glanced up at him out of habit as he approached, because they always exchanged chaste kisses in front of any audience, and then froze when he realized what he was waiting for. But Draco only hesitated an instant before giving him a kiss as he passed by.
They’ve come to a stop. Harry’s shaking, a fine series of tremors running through him and he can’t stop. He wraps his arms around himself and tries to force himself still. It’s dark here, so dark. Harry can’t see a thing.
“Ah,” says Granger while Weasley looks one step away from getting up and walking out of the pub. “Still in the honeymoon phase, I take it?”
By Monday, he’s given up. He’s accepted that there’s nothing he can do before tomorrow night to stop this from happening again. He’s going to transform again. He gets out of bed just long enough to drag himself over to the Floo and call the Manor. He asks a house-elf to tell his parents he’s fallen ill, it’s nothing serious, don’t worry, but he won’t be over today.
“Well, I suppose that’s a reasonable assumption,” Draco says. “But you could have asked me about it.”
Harry bristles at the statement about him being
He made the mistake of glancing back to their table, and his stomach fluttered at the sight of Harper leaning casually back in his chair, long legs stretched out under the table
As if to prove that he’s up to the task, Malfoy picks up an unfamiliar wand and Summons a spare blanket from where it’s folded over the arm of the visitor’s chair and shakes it out, then tosses it around Harry to cover his arse, which Harry abruptly realises is prominently on display to anyone who happens to wander past the open door, and is actually a bit chilly.
Minutiae taken care of, Robards and Draco leave the Head Auror’s office and Robards guides him on a tour of the DMLE. There’s a bustling canteen. A small infirmary staffed by a single Mediwitch who’s authorised to treat injuries and ailments too minor to warrant a trip to St Mungo’s. The training wing on the Ministry’s lowest level, which consists of about a dozen classrooms, several enormous physical training rooms, each complete with complex charmwork to adjust their size as needed, and two locker rooms, one for men and one for women. Draco meets Auror Casey, but the Auror with whom Draco will be working doesn’t have a class first thing Monday mornings and hasn’t come in yet. They go down the hall to a spare training room that will temporarily house Draco’s lab until Maintenance can shuffle things around upstairs to make space for him, which probably won’t happen until after the holidays, Robards warns him. Then they go back upstairs and Draco is shown through Filing, the temporary holding cells, the interrogation rooms, and finally, the offices.
Another crunch of leaves forces him to open his eyes, and he’s so hopped up on pain and adrenaline that he could probably tear some fucker’s head from his shoulders right now, but it’s just Malfoy, standing at the edge of the gorge with Harry’s spare Glock in his hands, holding it like a fucking twat who has no idea how to hold a gun.
Cool air floods into the room, and Draco’s skin erupts in goosepimples as he disrobes. It’s windy that night, the branches of the elm tree outside his window making strange shapes, backlit by the sodium-yellow of the streetlight across the street. Draco casts a spell over the floor that will clean up the blood he knows he’s going to get on it, then he ties his Portkey around his wrist and tucks his wand beneath his pillow for safekeeping.
Potter is already downstairs, waiting for Draco in the kitchen with tea and a plate of slightly-undertoasted toast.
Draco, who’d never been in contact with enough of his extended family to ever bother learning, nods. “Of course,” he says.
“Where on earth did you get that?” Draco asked, surprised, as he joined him.
There’s a perfectly timed crack of thunder that exactly matches the way his heart jolts at Ron’s words.
He’s lucky that it’s easy enough that doesn’t take much thought because he’s having difficulty concentrating. His hands tremble as he measures out two cups of purified water and grinds up moonstone with his mortar and pestle. He finishes adding ingredients to the cauldron and brings the mixture to a rolling boil before he fetches the saucer from upstairs.
“Good, because you’re going to have your chance,” Malfoy says. “If your handler is the focus for this spell, we’ll both be getting in magical range.”
“Harry. It’s nice to meet you,” Potter says politely.
“The way I see it, you’ve got two choices, haven’t you?” she said, leaning in close. “Tell him, or don’t tell him.”
Strong hands clamp around Draco’s arms and Potter spins him around, slams him backward so hard that the back of Draco’s skull bounces off the door with enough force to make him see stars. And then Potter’s hot mouth crushes over his own. For a single stunned second, Draco lets himself be kissed. The revoltingly bitter taste of the misbrewed potion lingering on Potter’s tongue kicks him back to reality and he wrenches his head to the side. Potter growls and pushes closer to him, rubbing his face against Draco’s neck, thrusting his hard cock against Draco’s hip. His clothing is still soaked with the botched potion, and Draco can feel it seeping through his own clothing, cold and wet against his skin, can feel it smearing along his neck from where Potter’s hair is drenched with it. He tells himself that’s why he shivers as Potter makes a low and desperate sound and presses closer.
“Fuck off,” Harry groaned, squinting in the too-bright lights of the Auror Department. Where in the fucking fuck did he leave his potions?
And perhaps that’s what Draco should have warned him of. Lucy can’t abide smugness. She leans into Potter’s touch, lets him stroke her feathers twice more, and then bites his fingers.
The top photo in the stack shows his empty living room, the sheer white curtains hung by the window twitching slightly in the faint breeze. So does the second, and the third.
“What I don’t understand,” Potter says nearly an hour later as he tosses a file on top of the stack on the coffee table, “is how there’s no report of any of this happening in the Muggle news.”
“We’re not friends.”
Malfoy goggles at him. “The
“We’re not talking about this,” says Potter.
He works until the small hours of the morning, parsing through theory and calculating probabilities before he gives up, slams his books shut, puts them back into their places on the shelves, and goes to bed.
"Bloody hell," Malfoy echoed, sounding absolutely delighted. He set his case down just inside the doorway and popped it open, and took out his gloves. "Well then, let's get to work."
“Or unless we feel like it, or it’s a day ending in the letter Y—”
The only way to break the curse, Draco reads, will come from within Draco himself.
“But you don’t want to, do you?”
Potter’s not looking at him, gaze fixed so intently on the doorway across the street that for a moment Draco thinks he’s seen something. But nothing’s there, just the closed door and dark window. He sighs and settles back against the wall of their alcove and tries to focus on the stakeout rather than the way he can still feel Potter’s magic tingling over his skin.
“Hm,” Lucius says, and leaves the room.
His vision is greying around the edges, and still he’s being dragged stumbling along the pavement, even though they’re around the corner and safe for the moment.
“Have we figured out where we’re going?” he asked, starting to stack up his things.
When she finishes, she looks him straight in the eye and tears the papers right in half.
Draco stares at her. “How on earth do you know that?”
“I’ve no need to read your mind, it’s written all over your face.” Tea. He needs tea. He’d skipped his morning cuppa in the interest of an earlier Portkey, though it turns out he needn’t have, as the shop is deserted. Lucius has wanted Draco to stay and have breakfast with him, and Draco rather wishes he had. “Have you had any trouble this morning? Have many customers been in?”
Harry flops to one side and shifts, watching sleepily as Malfoy expertly tugs the condom off his cock and knots it, then tucks it into the handkerchief. After a moment of obvious indecision, he sets it on the floor beside his coat. There’s some shuffling around as they both pull their trousers and pants back up and get themselves under the sheet and blanket. Malfoy shakes the second blanket out and tugs it up over both of them. There’s some more shuffling around as they both figure out how to fit together on the narrow mattress.
It doesn’t take long to lay in the spellwork: a broad woven net of Accelerant Charms, usually used to start campfires, and several strong shields to keep the Muggles away until the job is done. Malfoy weaves one final spell, another Accelerant Charm that he loops into the rest and draws back out to the pavement, so that they won’t even have to set foot on the property, never mind inside the mansion itself. Harry spares a moment’s regret for what they left inside. Their wands, his jacket, his glasses, Malfoy’s coat. But things can be replaced, and he doesn’t dare risk trying to go back inside for them. The only thing that truly matters is standing right here beside him.
It’s not much to look at, but in the short time since he’s moved in, it’s grown on him. It’s small, but it feels cosy rather than cramped. There’s a tiny bathroom tucked off to one side, with the kitchenette beside it. The rest of the flat is one large room, aside from a second alcove at the front of the shop. It looks like it may have been a window seat once upon a time, but somewhere along the line a very industrious wizard had layered the space with careful Extension Charms and created a little nook just deep enough to hold a double bed. It reminds Draco of the Hogwarts dormitories, and in a fit of nostalgia he’d purchased a set of emerald green curtains to hang in the archway, closing it off from the rest of the flat.
Pansy takes the drink menu Potter offers her, then digs in her clutch for a moment before withdrawing a pair of black cats-eye glasses. She puts them on and flips the menu open. Pansy Parkinson. Wearing glasses. For years, he’d told her to admit she needed them and she always flat-out refused. And now she not only owns a pair, but they’re a flashy pair and she’s wearing them in public.
And then he looks down at where he still holds Potter’s keys clutched in one hand.
They’re quiet as they pass through the Leaky Cauldron and out into Muggle London. This isn’t the first time Draco’s been out of the wizarding sections of the city. He’s passed through a handful of times in his adolescence, and he’d just been again with Potter when they went shopping and then met the estate agent to look for a house. But it’s worse, now, than it was then. It’s busier on a Thursday evening, and it’s loud and overwhelming and there are Muggles absolutely everywhere, hurrying this way and that. Some of them are holding odd little rectangles of metal to their ears or poking at them in their hands and they’re not watching where they’re going. He nearly collides with one, jumps out of the way and knocks into another.
“Entirely possible,” Harry said with a shrug. He lifted the mug and took another long drink, and winked at Draco just as the cock ejaculated a second time.
Draco had just finished eating his dinner when he remembered that he’d left his hat in the back room at the shop. It didn’t matter to him, Draco Malfoy, that he’d left the hat, but it certainly mattered to Desmond Dwyer. Desmond was never seen out in public without the stupid thing, and he had a few errands that he needed to run tomorrow morning to keep up his cover.
“Cheers, then,” Draco says, and taps the rim of his paper cup against hers before he takes a sip.
A part of Harry wants to argue, but the rest of him is so preoccupied by the pain that he takes the dose of potion that Malfoy pours for him without complaint. Malfoy helps him settle back into bed, tucks the blankets around him and even fluffs his goddamn pillow.
Draco rolls over to face him. Doesn’t say a word because there’s nothing to say about it. He’d have said no if he’d had a choice about it, but he understands how affected Potter is by the full moon, and saying that Draco wouldn’t have agreed to this if he’d been asked about it would only upset Potter. Instead, Draco kisses him, warm and slow, runs his hands over every inch of Potter’s body he can reach while Potter holds him close and rocks his hips against Draco’s until they’re both hard again.
The metal lid of the jar rattles as Malfoy screws it back into place. “I didn’t use magic.”
He can feel himself starting to panic. That bubble of fear in his chest is expanding, pressing on his ribs and making it hard to breathe.
“How on earth did you…” Harry began, and trailed off when it belatedly clicked what Malfoy had meant when he’d said that he’d barely gone out of his way to get it. “Oh no. Oh my god. You stole this, didn’t you?”
Tonight would be enough.
- - - - -
He gets his mouth back on Draco, pressing his parted lips to the tip and licking up the bead of precome that’s welled up on the slit. Draco’s hands return to his hair, weaving through the strands and tugging gently.
“You’re an adult. You don’t owe us any explanation for your choices. But,” She reaches out and pats the back of his hand, “you will always be my child. And all that matters to us is that you are happy.”
Weasley doesn’t come in, as it turns out, not that week nor any week after, to Draco’s ongoing relief. Granger continues to come in every couple of months to pick up a few things, and the smalltalk they make is polite, albeit a bit stilted. She picks out a few potions, and pays, and then she leaves. And it’s rather nice, Draco thinks. They’ll never be anything like friends, but there’s something about the civility of their interactions that fills him with an odd sense of pride. It makes him feel very grown-up and mature, which is ridiculous because he’s twenty-one years-old, and owns his own shop, and oughtn’t that be the measure of his capability rather than having a short chat about the unseasonably warm weather with Granger?
“That’s my line,” Harry said. “Which, I’d like to point out, for all that you say is terrible, it
thing just as appalling as Draco does. He talks a bit more about Potter, and Draco shares a few childhood stories about Pansy. He makes sure they’re really embarrassing ones, to make up for the ones she’s undoubtedly shared about him.
As before, his bed is neatly made with one corner folded invitingly back. Everything else is perfectly in order and there’s no sign of blood. The curtains on the window are pulled back, and five crows are perched in the tree outside, all of them staring in. As Draco watches, a sixth one flutters up, landing on the windowsill. One of them caws, and Draco turns away.
“Dunno,” Harry shrugged. “He just seems above it, is all. Like, hasn’t he got better things to do with his time?”
“If you’re going to gawk at me, at least hand over those socks,” Harry said. “My feet are bloody
Draco smiles and rolls his eyes. “My hero,” he says dryly.
them. But he doesn’t have a clear mental picture of what they look like, and sometimes Summoning Spells go awry in unpredictable ways when used without a clear line of sight, or at least a precise location.
“That one was not a joke,” Potter says helpfully. “I really do pick them based on the pictures. My favourite’s the one with the little bats on it. It’s a very nice pink one.”
The bells on the door tinkle just then, and Draco steps to the side to see who’s come in. And oh thank Merlin, Zelda’s back, bringing with her a much-appreciated end to this conversation.
“Oh,” Draco said, several beats too late.
“But we need—” Potter begins, breaking off the kiss, glancing back at the bloody olive oil.
“Nngggh,” Harry said and clasped a hand over his face as a wave of cringey shame washed over him.
for seven years.
“All right,” he says.
The back room was empty as far as he could tell, the door to the main part of the shop shut tight. Quickly, Harry wriggled through the window and dropped as quietly as he could to the floor. Another couple of charms preserved the bloody footprints tracked across the floor, the blood smeared on the doorknob.
“Are you talking about purposely committing fouls?” Ginny asks. She looks him up and down. “Because I am employed by the Department of Magical Games and Sports, and as such I am duty-bound to maintain my professional integrity and remain entirely impartial for the duration of this match.” She glances around and lowers her voice. “That said, the match hasn’t started yet and Harper’s an arse. You should know that Harry tends to look the other way for most of the roughing fouls. Just don’t try anything in front of me or Kielson, we’ll both call you on it.” She winks at him and strides off down the pitch.
There’s a shout from overhead and the sound of someone clattering down the stairs, and all Harry can think is that he isn’t done kissing Draco yet. He fumbles behind them, wrenches open the door of the narrow coat closet, and drags Draco inside.
“Like your boyfriend’s being unreasonable and kind of an arse?” Harry suggested, rubbing at his shoulder.
Which left the fake flirtation avenue of the investigation. That, at least, was coming along nicely. Draco had to hope that as things progressed, Harper would soon confide in him more directly about what he hoped to get out of Malfoy. And then Draco would know once and for all whether he was affiliated with Pura or not. But even that had its difficulties. Harper seemed open enough when they were alone, but he’d jump whenever the door opened, disrupting their flow of conversation. Or if Celene was around, which was more days than not, he’d become reluctant to say much of anything of consequence. He and Draco would have long conversations about Quidditch or whatever bits of overblown nonsense were currently cluttering up the front page of the
“You know,” Draco says, straightening up again. “We have the most bizarre conversations when we’re about to have sex.”
. But before then was the War, and the less said about that, the better.
Malfoy moves slowly, deliberately, sliding his hand down Harry’s arm, across his hip, and then cups firmly between his legs. Harry’s breath hitches, and Malfoy leans closer, his eyes so pale in the dim light spilling in from the hall. Harry can’t believe Malfoy’s doing this, can’t believe how much he
,” Malfoy cuts him off. “It’s tied into the wards of the Ministry. And into those bullshit ‘security spells’ they’ve got all over everything.” His hands leap up to form air quotes as he speaks, then flutter back down, quick and jerky like sparrows. “And now no one there can see what’s right in front of their noses. They forget things that ought to make them suspicious. It keeps everybody nice and calm and following orders like good little pawns. Lets them keep peace and order by killing anyone who looks like they might make waves, and no one bats an eyelash. They’re trying to make sure another Dark Lord never arises, and in doing so they’ve stepped into the void he left and become something just as terrible.”
Malfoy finally removed his hand from Harry’s leg, leaving it suddenly cold. Harry rubbed at the place where Malfoy’s palm had been pressed, trying to erase the feeling. He’d finished his own pint a few minutes ago, and Malfoy picked up his own glass to drain the last bit. Harry tried to not stare at the way Malfoy’s throat worked as he swallowed, and failed miserably.
“Malfoy,” Harry says. “Nothing about you is straight.”
He’d been looking forward to seeing her again, but by the time Wednesday night rolls around, he begs off. He’s still exhausted. Even though he’s sleeping a full eight hours each night, and despite the sleeping potions he’s started taking each evening, he wakes up each morning just as tired as he’d been when he went to bed the previous evening. He’s irritable, temper on a hair-trigger, and the bruises beneath his eyes have darkened and spread, the purple bleeding into a greenish tinge that he’s started covering with a Blemish Concealer lest his mother pop in to see him at work. That bloody sparrow has finally let him alone, at least. Draco hasn’t seen it since Wednesday, thank Merlin for small mercies.
“The worst,” Draco repeats.
“I need you to get on the Floo to Henri.” He shoulders her aside and pulls the door open to peek out into the shop. Other than a witch with an enormous feathered pink hat browsing through vials of potions, it’s deserted. “Right now. It’s an emergency.”
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco mutters, and casts a Muffling Charm on the glass before turning for his bed.
She’s smiling at him. And her smile isn’t flimsy, forced, or fake. If anything, it’s that blandly polite smile most people who’ve been in customer services for a while tend to wear while on the job, and it strikes him that she probably has no idea who he is. He’d been afraid that the moment he appeared back in London, thirteen years’ worth of escaped hatred would crash down on him at once. But this girl doesn’t even recognise him.
It’s wonderful, and Harry’s still wrapping his brain around the idea that he gets to have this
The soulbond Malfoy cast in the dream state is still there.
A spray of liquid hits Draco’s face, temporarily blinding him, and then a cauldron slams into his head.
Harry’s broomstick shudders—
when he’s only trying to make sure that everyone is doing everything they possibly can for Potter—
Well. Too late for that now. And before he could dwell on that any further, Harper was kissing him again. In any case, Draco likely needn’t have bothered putting away the few things that he had, as Harper had barely spared a glance around the room before focusing in on Draco.
the bowl being placed on the little mahogany table, and then the cheerful jingle of Potter dropping his keys into it. Then Potter comes back.
Thankfully, they’re not going much farther. Potter turns to the second building down from the corner and leads Draco up to it.
“It’s in August, Draco. Surely two months is enough time.” He waves one hand dismissively before Draco can protest again. “Think about it, you don’t have to decide right away.”
She’s gone for longer than Draco expected, so he opens the shop himself, flips the sign in the window to
“And you shouldn’t be. You should be talking about this with Pots.”
“Right,” Ron said. “And no one would be surprised by it, or anything. You and Malfoy have been giving each other looks when the other isn’t watching for a while now. We all figured it was only a matter of time.”
Malfoy’s not moving in; Harry’s moving out.
“First off,” Harry said. He took a breath, and then went on much more calmly. “We’ve just been over this. I’m not really young, Malfoy, I know what I want. And second, it’s not taking advantage if I want you to do it.” He frowned, studying Draco’s face intently. “I mean, if me looking like this genuinely makes you uncomfortable, I don’t mind waiting. They’ll have me back to normal in a couple of weeks, a month at the longest. That’s not so long to wait.”
Potter squints at him. “People hiding the fact that they’re working together because one of them keeps sprouting wings and disappearing for days on end is a common trope?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Do you remember the Yule Ball in fourth year?”
—and he hits the ground of a pitch he’s never seen before hard, and his leg snaps—
Draco looks up at him “You’ve found out what curse it is?”
- - - - - -
“Right,” he says. “So they know I’m still alive. And that means the scene we set up yesterday tipped them off that you’ve gone rogue.” And there’s his answer. If they know Potter’s not on their side, then Potter’s got nothing to go back to. Killing Draco at this point wouldn’t solve anything. The coffee feels like it’s eating at his stomach, and he pushes the cup away. “Do they know where I am? Can they tell that through the Trace, I mean?”
(“Continuing education? More like
He’d meant it as an invitation for Potter to leave so he can get on with it, but instead Potter insists on turning on the water for him, testing it with his hand to make sure it’s the proper temperature, then helps him to his feet.
“You enchanted a motorcycle to fly?” Draco asks, ignoring her. “That’s all sorts of illegal.”
“Where are you going?” Draco calls after him, and Potter doesn’t answer.
He leans in, breathes warm over Potter’s arsehole, feels him shiver.
Knockturn Alley during the day had nothing on Knockturn at night. Wrapped up in a dark cloak, Harry was just one among many who didn’t want to be noticed. He kept his head down, and everyone he passed did the same. He reached Ashby’s Antiques & Imports without incident, and hesitated the barest instant before passing it by, peering sidelong from beneath his hood as he did. The windows were dark and everything was quiet. Harry went to the end of the street before he turned around and went back, pacing himself so that he arrived at it with no one else around. With one furtive glance up and down the street to ensure that he was as alone as he could be, he slipped down the narrow gap between the shop and the building beside it.
“I’ll drink to that,” Weasley said. He hid his wand and the pink hearts popped like soap bubbles.
As far as blood magic goes, this isn’t even a terribly dangerous bit of spellwork. But it would raise all sorts of questions that Draco would rather not have to answer.
Draco turns his attention to the wizard behind the counter, a tall and thin man with brown hair and the greenest eyes Draco’s seen this side of the Boy Who Lived. Draco recognises him instantly from his case files. Alexander Tielman, three arrests for trafficking in illegals—one for potions ingredients and two for dark artefacts—but never anything serious enough to earn him time in Azkaban. He’d served a total of ten months of community service and then (presumably) gone right back to what he’d been doing. No known criminal associations, including Death Eaters. In fact, like Draco, Tielman had left the country during the War. He’d stayed out until after the post-War crackdown on Knockturn Alley, then waltzed right in and set up shop in the void that remained.
The potion isn’t all that complicated—the oldest ones never are—but it requires more stirring than most, boiling for a long time over a hot flame until the color leaches from it in big puffs of steam that slowly fade from red to pink to white. When the potion is as clear as crystal and the steam coming off it is as stark as freshly-fallen snow, Draco removes it from the heat and lets it cool for an interminable forty-five minutes, during which he does a lot of pacing, a lot of worrying, and completely botches a Headache Potion.
and props open the door because it’s a nice day outside, pleasantly warm with a bit of a breeze. He packages up the two potions to be sent by post that he’s got ready and writes out the addresses on top, and then Zelda returns with the Sickles. A quick swish of Draco’s wand has them sorted into tidy stacks of seventeen and lined up in their drawer beneath the counter, which he locks with a small key he keeps in his pocket. He makes a mental note to duplicate it so Zelda can have a copy while she works.
Frowning, Harry returned his attention to the conversation, where Seamus was shouting, “Boris Karloff!” over and over, and oh good. The negotiations for what they would watch tonight had begun. Harry didn’t much care, so he leaned back in his chair and watched the debate unfold.
“When you’re what?” Draco asked, continuing to stroke him. He rubbed his thumb under the head of Harry’s cock, and Harry’s hips jerked, a drop of precome welling up at the tip. “Come on, tell me.”
Draco shrugs and flips a page. “This way they look nice.”
Harry gasped into Draco’s mouth, and Draco kissed the corner of Harry’s mouth, Harry’s neck, Harry’s shoulder.
Malfoy gives the front door a longing look. “I suppose we ought to stick together, considering.”
Draco tells her, and she motions to a row of uncomfortable-looking chairs in the corner, along with a small table and a stack of battered magazines, and invites him to wait there. Draco goes over and settles on the chair closest to the desk while the reception witch disappears off into the labyrinth of  cubicles. The seat is every bit as uncomfortable as it looks, the seat cushion lumpy, and if Draco’s posture were worse, he bets that the wooden slats comprising the back of the chair would dig painfully into his spine. He allows himself to slouch, curious, and oh yes, he was right. It’s quite horrible. He straightens up again and looks around idly as he waits.
“Hermione,” Harry says, putting his arm back over his eyes. “This jacket was a gift from Hermione. She worries about me, wants me to be prepared for anything.”
, followed by an insistent hoot.
Draco nods. That’s how they’d done it back in New York. He’d instruct the trainees on the uses of his devices, then pass them along to the Stealth instructor where the students would put the devices to use in training simulations.
“Hey, Malfoy,” Potter says when he walks in. “How’d it go with Agnes?”
More footsteps come down the stairs, and then the oldest Weasley sibling—Bill, Draco remembers after a moment—appears with a strawberry-blonde baby in his arms. He looks around, and makes a beeline for Weasley.
‘Nice’ is not a word Draco would ever apply to Blaise Zabini, but at this point he just lets it go because he doesn’t think pointing it out will do any good. And anyhow, he’s still trying to unravel the mystery of what Potter’s doing in his office. Inviting him out, it would seem, but there’s no reason Potter couldn’t have waited until Draco joined him down in Tactical Spellwork this afternoon to tell him this. But he goes along with it.
And Draco blinks, because here he’s been bracing himself for outright rejection, and Molly Weasley is offering him drinks.
“That’s because it’s not a
“Sure,” Potter says. He doesn’t quite grimace, but it’s a near thing.
“Pansy,” he says again in warning.
The potion for muscle aches is done, so Draco extinguishes the flame beneath it and decants it into several vials. Some he labels and puts price stickers on and sets aside to be put out in the shop for sale, and some he labels and sets aside to take with him tomorrow. He puts the cauldron in the sink and runs water into it. He blinks blearily and watches the water rise, watches the dregs of the muscle ache potion lift off the bottom of the cauldron and float free. Going upstairs and climbing into bed is all he can think about. He’s finally reached the point where he wants to sleep more than anything else in the world.
He debates whether he should seek her out, uncertain about what state of dress he might find her in, then remembers that this is
“All right,” he murmured to himself as he scooped up a handful of Floo powder. “Here we go.”
She’s on the covers of magazines all the time; somehow, in the months after the War, she became a femme fatale in the eyes of the wizarding world, and that title never really went away. Pureblood girls copy whatever cloak she wears during the season; Muggle girls wear her brand of jeans; all of them spell their hair like Hermione’s when they aren’t around their parents. The name Hermione has turned up seven times in the Magical Birth Registry in this year alone. So it really shouldn’t have surprised any of them that when a couple of pureblood girls saw her chatting on a ‘Mobile Floo’, they needed one, too.

“Because different potions call for different ingredients. There’s a difference between sliced and diced and minced, and organic ingredients that have been deliquisced blend better at low temperatures when you’re brewing—Did you not learn
Potter laughs, a big, happy sound, and he gives Draco another grin as he leads the way up to the front porch. The worn wooden steps creak as they climb them, their footfalls echoing hollowly on the sagging wood porch. Potter lets himself in without knocking, and Draco follows him inside.
“Got nothing to do with trust,” Potter says. “There’s a Trace on you.”
Draco shrugs helplessly. “Did you check the Ministry’s records for recent Obliviations?”
“Yes, that’s right. Well.” Dorothea leans forward, eyes sparkling with barely-restrained glee, and lowers her voice as she continues, “I heard from Charlotte down the street who heard from Katherine’s mother herself that they eloped! Apparently they had a great big fight with—Oh!” Dorothea breaks off, looking across the shop as the bells above the door ring and a customer comes in. “There she is, Draco, you do remember the young lady I mentioned to you the other day, don’t you? Hello again, dear, I’m so glad you found your way over.” Dorothea gives her an enthusiastic wave.
He’s not hard yet, his dick only just beginning to perk up. Harry sucks delicately at it, and can’t help the little hum of pleasure he makes at the soft weight of it on his tongue. It’s rare that Harry gets Draco’s cock in his mouth like this. They usually have a little more foreplay before their dicks get involved, and there’s something almost unbearably intimate about it. It’s no secret that Harry likes the soft, hidden parts of Draco best—his belly, his throat, the tender, ticklish insides of his thighs—but his limp cock feels vulnerable in a way that the other bits of him don’t.
“Close?” he murmurs into the back of Harry’s jumper.
He glanced over his shoulder at the table where his pint sat half-full and waiting for him. Malfoy and Ron were talking, neither one of them looking entirely comfortable with the other, though they both seemed to be making an effort. Malfoy sat with his back to the wall again, as he’d done the previous two times Harry had brought him out since they’d been bonded, and every so often his sharp gaze swept over the Muggles around him. The bright cyan glow of a neon sign mounted on the wall above him bathed him in cool light and tinted his hair pale blue, made it look very soft and fine, and Harry's fingertips itched so badly to touch it that for an instant he thought it was the bond pulling at him. But no, he’d only just touched Malfoy’s hand; this was all Harry.
“Make yourself useful, you arsehole, and open up the wine. The riesling, I think, will go nicely with this.” Draco touches his hand gently to Potter’s back as he squeezes by him. He opens a drawer and gets out spoons and forks and knives, waiting for Potter to see the wine bottle he’d bought. That should do nicely for a distraction.
He’s feeling so good about it that he makes a little detour over to Name and Moniker Establishment on his way down. He demands to speak to Mr Ingham and refuses to leave until he’s done so. Eventually the secretary relents and takes him to a small office where a short man with a puckered frown and a truly unfortunate comb-over looks up and glares at the interruption.
“We… We’re not real, Harry,” Draco repeats.
curses, you’d want a go at it since they’re so old. This place has been abandoned for close to a century now, and the disappearances go back pretty much the whole way, as far as we can tell. PC Waters went through the cold case files for us and flagged anything suspicious. There’s about two dozen. Likely more than that, but two dozen’s what he was able to dig out.”
“Did you help Draco Malfoy?” he asked breathlessly.
* * * * *
Potter visibly reins in his anger. Takes a deep breath and says, “Look, I know you’re probably not thrilled to be working with me. I’m not thrilled about it either—”
“I don’t give two shits about the fucking Statute,” Harry says, practically dragging him through the fence, and grabbing at his wand to snap, “
“Good,” she said. “Let them. Maybe tomorrow there’ll be an article about how we’re a threesome.”
“No, but I’m so close—“ Draco began, elbow jerking as he wanked himself.
, Harry can hear in his mind as clearly as if Malfoy is speaking aloud.
“You live in the old Black place, don’t you?” Malfoy asked, looking down his nose. “Absolutely not. We’ll be staying in my flat.”
Harry felt a little flutter of pride well up in his chest as he stood back and surveyed the scene he’d set. Perfect. This would be wonderfully romantic.
“Ha!” Zelda scoffs, gesturing with the broomstick. “You’d be lost without me. And if you want to talk about demolishing your shop,
Harry, being the difficult fucking
“No,” Draco says. Is Potter being deliberately thick about this? “The bit where we’re pretending to have a relationship. That always happens for whatever flimsy reason. And then somewhere along the line, they end up in a position where they’re forced to kiss.”
Harry took a deep breath in, and let it out slowly. “Ron. I’m fine. I was fine the whole time. If you have any objections with how I’m conducting myself on this case, you can take it up with Robards at our meeting tonight. Until then, I really haven’t got time to stand here and argue with you. I need to get to work.”
Blaise chuckled as he placed a setting spell on Harry’s tamed waves. “Yes. We have a reputation of excellence to maintain in the House. We tutor one another in our studies and keep our appearance immaculate.”
Tightening his hold on the coin, Draco swallowed hard. For all that Harry circled him, he had genuine friends in Granger and Weasley. And while Draco was jealous of their bond, he was immensely grateful that whatever the future held for Harry, he wouldn’t face it alone. With Granger’s brilliance and Ron’s loyalty to curb Harry’s brashness, he would win the coming war.
“Tomorrow all eyes will be upon us as never before, but no matter what the rest of the castle believes about us,
Mumbling in acquiescence, he hastily polished off his tea and rose from the table. “Thank you for an illuminating conversation, Cissa. I fear the rest of my afternoon shall pale in comparison,” he said stiffly.
Harry chuckled. “No, I much prefer Draco to Lucius. I’m willing to bet the rest of the world will, too,” he said, idly thumbing the soft knuckles cupped in his hands. “You’re not him, you know. You will never be him. I keep my promises, Draco.”
“Dunno, but it wouldn’t be me.” Tilting his chair on its back legs, he crossed his arms as he thought about potential blokes while Hermione began working on a shortlist.
“Teekey,” he called.
“Yes,” Draco agreed hoarsely as he dove in for a kiss. Unlike Harry’s rather chaste one, this was passion and heat and quickly found them shoved against a wall as Harry pressed their bodies flush.
Draco joined Blaise, tension present in every line of his body as angry splotches of colour bloomed on his cheekbones. Staring at the far wall, he said, “Severus will speak to Dumbledore about the incident. It should be enough to have her banned from school grounds. She was told not to interrupt students during class time and defied the order on day three.”
“No,” Malfoy said, bringing Harry up short. “We’re not going.”
“You Apparated. All the way from here to London? In one jump?” Potter asks, his eyes widening. He glances down at the map in the book, and then back up at Draco.
Harry very much does not want to keep puking. “I didn’t,” he says instead, and Merlin help him, he actually gestures to the wildly overgrown flowerbed which he very much did
“It’s from earlier this week,” he blurts out. He doesn’t want her to think he’s taking advantage of Potter.
“Is something wrong?” Draco asked, aiming for casual as he opened the register and swept a handful of Knuts out into his waiting palm.
“And we knew you were the one sending the DMLE those anonymous tips on rogue Hit Wizards, too. Everyone’s got a job, Harry. Yours was to take out the rubbish; ours was to take care of you. Now get the fuck out of the Ministry before Rosier shows up.”
It’s more than a little terrifying how much he thinks about Potter. The dirty fantasies are one thing, and he definitely spends a lot of time thinking of those. Of them twined together, sweaty and thrusting, of sucking Potter’s cock and Potter sucking his, of Potter’s fingers pushing into him and stretching him open. By this point he can say with reasonable confidence that he’s pictured himself and Potter having sex in every position imaginable. He wants to lick every inch of Potter’s naked body.
Draco blinks up at him. Then he fumbles for the arrow’s shaft with numbed fingers, grabs hold and yanks it out.
Last week, Potter wouldn’t have hesitated to tell Draco he looks like shit. “I have trouble sleeping sometimes,” Draco tells him. He can’t look at Potter without thinking of that dream. The phantom feel of liver sliding over his tongue, smooth and body-warm, makes his stomach twist.
“For the last time, you are not helping,” he snapped, while Ron only looked more amused.
“Shit,” he said, jogging a few steps and catching Malfoy by the sleeve. “Malfoy, wait.”
“Yes, that bit,” Harry said. He liked the way Draco had said ‘severity of the infraction’ more than he probably should, but blamed that on being forced to listen to Draco drone on about inappropriate workplace relations was starting to addle Harry’s brain a bit. “Perhaps you could help me tell the difference between the, ah, severities?”
Everything is ready and brought out shortly after that, and Draco ends up seated between Potter and George. They spend most of the meal deep in conversation complaining about the proposed changes to the process for having potion formulas approved. Halfway through, Percy, who’s seated across from George, jumps in and argues in defence of the changes. And Draco’s been listening to the pair of them argue for long enough that he’s half-convinced that most of the time Percy takes the opposing side just because he loves debating so much. He’s got to be. No-one can love paperwork as this argument would have Draco believe he does.
” she’s saying, her voice rhythmic and lilting, and Draco remains silent as her voice drops to an unintelligble murmur, then picks up again. “
“I did not sound like I was being murdered,” Draco says sullenly. “And anyhow, you told me it was a noise complaint, not a someone-being-murdered complaint.”
And all right, yeah, maybe Potter was right. This is much more fun than a broom, and they haven’t even left the ground yet.
The door closes behind her. Draco lets the smile slip off his face, and lays his head down on his worktable.
“Brilliant,” Draco says, entirely unsure if he’s referring to the ride or to the way Potter’s smiling at him right now. “Absolutely brilliant.”
afterward. And then the chocolate cake thing had happened, and it hit Harry like a bolt of lightning that it wasn’t just convenience that made him not interested in sleeping with anyone but Malfoy. And by then it was too late, he was already in it too deep to get back out again.
Draco makes it across the city in record time, and circles the street twice before he spots where Weasley lives. He brings the motorcycle down, landing with a sharp jounce as he slams it into a parking spot and leaps off. A horrified Muggle looks on as Draco and a motorcycle suddenly pop into sight, and Draco lashes out with an
A pair of witches come in just then, and Draco steps away to help them. Their questions about bat blood take long enough that Dorothea goes back to her own shop, and doesn’t get a chance to come back over before Draco closes up, which is a shame because at one point a wizard comes into his shop grumbling about ‘indecent displays’ and Draco’s fairly certain that means Mr and Mrs Hobbs have made up again. But the mystery will have to wait until tomorrow.
The idea of leaving Potter feels like leaving something very important left undone. Like not checking off the last item on a list, like not tying up the final loose end. He doesn’t want to go, of course he doesn’t. But the sheer depth of this unexplored
A woman’s voice suddenly become clear as the door opens a fraction, and Draco can see her hand curled round the edge of it, short nails, no nail varnish, no jewelry. Practical. He takes out his wand and aims carefully. There’s no way this isn’t going to leave a magical trace, but what choice has he got?
Ron’s disapproving look intensified. “You went out last night, alone, with a suspect in an active investigation, and got drunk enough with him to be hungover the next morning. Do you have any idea how bloody dangerous that is?”
. But if he argues, then Potter will keep arguing, and he’s already going to be opening his shop late for the day, he doesn’t need to waste any more time with this pointless conversation.
Every now and then, Malfoy will slide past Harry in the tight confines of the tent and his hand will land on the lower part of Harry’s back as he does it. It sends weird shivers up Harry’s spine. Weird shivers he hasn’t felt in a hell of a long time, and certainly not for a Malfoy and certainly not for a man, so it can’t possibly mean what he first thinks it means. That’s just stupid.
It’s driving him mad.
”Right,” Draco sighs. He leans his head against the window. The coolness of the glass feels wonderful against his skin but it’s uncomfortably hard against the tender skin of his temple, and painful every time the car hits a bump. Draco doesn’t move; this small pain is less than he deserves, but at least it’s something.
Harry scooped a dollop of the white paste out and gingerly applied it to his fingers, and minute later, the burns had been healed entirely, leaving Harry’s hands faintly greasy and smelling sharply and most unpleasantly of arm-pits. He couldn’t wait to wash off this gunk, but the label on the jar said to leave it alone for at least fifteen minutes.
when we landed!”
Smiling to himself a little and fully planning to make full use of that bottle of lube again this morning for that promised second round, Harry pushed himself up onto his elbows and dragged himself the few inches across the mattress it took to reach the drawer, hooking his fingers into the handle and tugging it open.
“I don’t live with anyone,” Malfoy countered.
Potter nips at the back of Draco’s neck, then again, harder. Draco moans and lets his head loll forward. Potter bites him and doesn’t let go, tightens the arm he has wrapped around Draco’s middle, speeds up stroking Draco’s cock. His knot is stretching Draco to the point where he feels wonderfully, intensely full as it locks them together. Draco rolls his hips, the thrusts shallow but the friction is amazing. He speeds up his motions, keeping up with the rhythm Potter’s set with wanking him in firm, strong strokes. He can feel himself getting close.
Weasley smiled at Draco, looking terribly smug for someone who was in serious danger of getting his bollocks hexed off.
“Oh, not very long at all,” Myrtle says, and by the darkening of her face Draco can tell that this topic isn’t going to be any more pleasant. “I didn’t have any friends, you see. It’s a very efficient thing, not having friends. I’ve
“A ridiculous one,” Draco tells him. “Or do you know how to speak whatever language they use in wherever it is that Potters come from?” Draco tries to look to the side without being obvious about it. “Is that couple staring at us? I feel like we’re being stared at.” Potter turns his whole head to look, and Draco tries to kick him under the table, “Merlin, don’t
“Aren’t you?” Malfoy says, sneering. “Can’t even keep yourself from killing an innocent man because you’re too scared to examine your own fucked up life choices.”
especially was fascinated with them, going on about the glimpses they managed to catch in photographs and speculating wildly about how many more there were—and where exactly the rest might be. Harry was always in a particularly grumpy mood on the days those articles ran.
“Not a priority for most wizards, is it?” she points out. “There aren’t enough of us to make it worthwhile, I suppose. It’s not exactly profitable.” She rubs at her temples. “Can we have this chat later when I’m not feeling like death?”
“Sort of bonded,” Potter corrects.
Both the sudden shift in conversation and the depth of concern in her voice surprise Draco.
“Haven’t come up with a name for it yet,” Draco says. He strips off his gloves and drops them onto the table, pulls the goggles off and tosses them on top.
side of their friendship. But he’s like that everywhere, even in the Muggle world where they don’t know anyone and no one knows them, so by now Harry’s pretty sure it’s just how Malfoy is. But still. Now that Harry knows what sorts of things Malfoy gets up to in private, Harry wouldn't be able to stop imagining it even if Malfoy and his new partner never so much as kiss in front of him.
He’s saved from any further anxious what-ifs by Zelda herself. She pushes inside, wincing a little as the bells strung up on the door cheerfully herald her arrival.
“I’m going to murder all of them,” Harry said.
Harry blinked at him. His mouth was very pink and wet from kissing, and Draco was struck all over again how bloody
Pansy rolls her eyes. “You brought it up.”
Draco hadn’t pressed the point when Potter escorted him downstairs and out of St Mungo’s and bundled him into the waiting cab. Potter had run interference when Mrs Field tried to chat, and now standing in the entryway of their home feels like walking into someone else's life. The house is too quiet, the steady tick-tick-tick of the clock in the kitchen echoing oddly in the silence. The flowers in the vase have begun to drop petals all over the table. Draco ought to clean that up. Put in fresh ones.
He sped up his strokes gradually, each a little quicker, a little harder than the last, until he was slamming into Harry with each thrust, and it was all Harry could do to hang on so that he didn’t slam face-first into the wall behind the sofa. He gasped, whimpering as Malfoy found the perfect angle to hit his prostate each time he pushed inside.
And in that moment, Harry knows.
Draco didn’t have an answer to that, because honestly he had no idea. He’d had a whole array of reasons for why not, but in the wake of what had just happened, knowing now that Harry felt the same, every single reason he’d told himself suddenly seemed like flimsy excuses. The long and the short of it was, he’d been afraid.
and had never managed to break the habit—and have a Shield Charm ready and waiting for it. The curse hit and dissipated with a loud
. For the rest of his life, even! Assuming Malfoy wants to put up with Harry for that long, but if Harry’s tendency to leave his dirty pants lying forgotten on the bathmat after he showers hasn’t driven Malfoy off by now, Harry’s pretty confident that nothing will.
And Draco’s got a jar of it in his secondary lab space.
“To new connections,” Harper echoed and clinked his glass with Draco’s.
He turns around in the tight embrace of Potter’s arms, lets Potter bend him over the nearest worktable. Potter shoves Draco’s clothing out of the way, and Draco wriggles until the fabric of his robes no longer bunches uncomfortably beneath his stomach. Potter presses him down, one hand warm against the small of his back, and that’s when it clicks in Draco’s mind: Potter’s about to take him dry. For the first time, Draco feels a frissure of real fear sweep through him, sharp enough to pierce the thick haze of desire. He squirms away, one hand reaching for his wand.
ready and waiting on the tip of his tongue to catch the bird before it flies away.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry said.
Malfoy’s hand closes around the Snitch, Harry’s fingers caught between them. There’s a little spark, almost like static electricity, and Harry jolts. It’s the same thing Harry felt this morning in his—their?—bedroom. Malfoy’s grip on him tightens, but before he can say anything else, Ginny interrupts.
Draco makes his sixth transformation and comes home with an arrow sunk deep into the meat of his thigh. But he comes home. That’s the important part, that he comes home.
At close to an hour in, the score is 50-40 with MLEP in the lead, and there’s still no sign of the Snitch. Draco’s shivering constantly now, his Warming Charms fading. He’s just debating whether to risk a foul by taking out his wand to refresh them when a burst of magic curls around him, sinks into his clothes and slides over his skin. Draco loses himself in it for a moment, then blinks open his eyes just in time to see Potter slipping his wand back up his sleeve. No one else appears to have noticed him cast, and Potter doesn’t acknowledge what he’s done in any way as he steers his broom in a wide curve along the boundary of the pitch.
Harry hesitated, then slipped out of bed to retrieve his robes, wrapping them quickly around himself and doing up all the fastenings with a quick spell. His pants were… somewhere. He scooped up his socks and jammed them into his pockets, crammed his feet into his shoes, and then had to turn back to the bed to get his wand.
in his fucking life to not let him down, and he hates her, and he hates his parents, and he hates Potter, Merlin how he
“Are you going over to the Burrow?” he asks.
The rush of pleasure at that one small lick felt like a punch to the stomach. “
“If that’s what it takes. I know how hard it was with Liam, and your relationship with him wasn’t half as complicated as yours is with Draco.”
“A habit I’m afraid you’ll have to break here,” Draco said, aiming for apologetic as he willed his heart to stop thumping quite so quickly. “Mr Malfoy frowns on idleness, and if he catches you at it, well…”
The little corner of his mind hasn’t got anything to say to that.
It was early enough that there were only a handful of other patrons scattered throughout the pub, and a mild Muggle-Repelling Charm cast around their corner ensured that anyone who came near would suddenly decide that a table on the other side of the room looked much more appealing. Harry wasn’t entirely sure it was necessary, but he didn’t quite trust Malfoy to behave himself amongst Muggles.
- - - - - -
Draco supposes that he really can't blame Potter for that. He glances at what he thinks of as his wall, though it takes up nearly two: photographs and newspaper clippings, incident reports and witness statements and performance reviews pilfered from hundreds of Ministry files, the whole mess dotted with Draco's own scribbled notes on scraps of parchment and then crisscrossed with dozens of coloured strings, tying all of it together like some sort of mad spider's web. Yeah, he doesn't blame Potter at all for thinking he's nuts. But luckily for Draco, Potter at least seems to think that he’s a fucking lunatic who’s maybe onto something, because he has yet to pull the trigger. Instead, he followed Draco into the bedroom and looked at his wall and listened to Draco’s explanations. And even if he’s now looking at Draco like he suspects him of having gone entirely off his trolley, Potter thinks what Draco told him had enough merit to warrant coming up with a plan to keep him alive.
Potter peers up at him dubiously. “What, like a were-bird?”
“Oh, Zelda mentioned something about that, I think,” Granger says. “And how is she doing? We didn’t have much of a chance to chat last time I stopped in. I was in a bit of a rush.”
“Oh,” says Potter around his first mouthful. He chews and swallows. “Malfoy, this is really good.”
that; of course an ex-Death Eater isn’t good enough for the Chosen One. Weasley certainly doesn’t need to point that out every other second.
Pansy rolls her eyes but hands it over. “Why Draco, you’re such a treasure to work with. I’ve got no idea why we’re not partners all the time because you’re a ray of sunshine in this dreary—”
,” Harry sighed. “You beautiful bastard.”
A sudden lightness fluttered in his chest as he walked down the broad aisle that split the room in two, and Draco bit back a smile. Sometimes it struck him anew just how lucky he was to belong here. He hadn’t felt like that at first, especially during his first year here, where he made the long walks to and from his cubicle with his chin up and his spine stiff, wary and half-braced for mistrustful looks or suspicious murmurs from his colleagues as he passed by. How he’d received them, more often than not.
“From the way no one will talk about it in any detail, I’m assuming it’s something you’re not comfortable with me knowing,” Draco says. “Weasley did mention something about an illegal potions case and some rulebreaking, but that’s as much as I know.”
Draco makes it to the final drawer on his list, marked Ros-Ryz, and has just slid it open when he feels the faint prickling of the Locator Charm wash over his skin. He shivers and the hair on his arms rises into goosepimples.
But it’s all right. Draco’s sofa is wide and comfortable, and the room is quite cosy with a fire roaring in the fireplace. And he’s finally got Potter back in his arms, right where he belongs.
- - - - -
Age: 30
“Great, I’ll be right back, then,” Potter says, and is up and out of his chair before Draco can protest.
“Warming Charms that automatically switch off once you’re indoors. Water-Repelling Charms. Sticking Charms, so it never slips once you put it on,” Draco lists. “And you know how when you pull it up over your nose and breathe through it when it’s really cold, but then it starts to smell a bit odd? There’s a charm to warm and freshen the air that comes through it. I’ve also added a rather neat little charm that activates if you ever forget it somewhere—” And then he can’t keep talking because Potter yanks off the goggles and kisses him. “But there’s more.”
Potter just looks at him, then gives him a curt nod. He finishes the last of his coffee, then takes his cup and Draco’s to the sink where he cleans them with a few spells and puts them back in the cabinet.
Irritated with himself all over again, Draco ignores the ache in his chest and twists the knobs to turn off the water, snags his towel and roughly dries himself. Tucks it around his waist and flings open his curtain. His Marked arms gets a few lingering glances but most of the students ignore it entirely by now. Draco gives Adams a pointed frown, and the boy looks away. Draco strides to his locker and dresses quickly, then lingers, waiting for Potter while trying to not make it obvious he’s waiting. Merlin, this is ridiculous. He’s behaving like a first-year with a crush. And he can’t seem to stop himself.
“So I’m… not an Auror anymore?”
“Harry!” Ginny shouts. She runs up and tackles him in an enormous hug, and he bends back to lift her off her feet for a second before setting her back down. “Happy early birthday!”
Harry barely has time to brace himself, but it’s like trying to fight gravity, or the ocean. It’s so much bigger than he is, and it’s angry that he’s trying to get away.
“It is not fine,” Fleur says. “It was difficult at first with Bill. Zey all think zat no-one can care for one of zeir own as much as zey care for each other. Zat you must somehow
He goes through the rest of the questions, and her answers are all exceedingly satisfactory. But given her exemplary Potions scores, he expected nothing less. He goes over what he’d expect from her, and in the middle of him rattling off the shop’s hours, she looks like she wants to say something.
“Right,” Draco says awkwardly. His hands are still shaking. He tucks them into the pockets of his trousers.
Twenty seconds.
Ingham sputters a bit more, goes all flushed and indignant, and Draco's forced to pull out his second list and hand it over. He watches the blood drain from Ingham's face as he works through the first name—Very Innovative Complex Inventions Organised Using Supremely Creative Or Complicated Key Magics Or Necessary Spellwork To Ensure Results—and he can see the exact moment when Ingham comes up with
Malfoy rolled his eyes a little, but he was smiling. “Well, when you put it like that,” he said. “Your place or mine?”
It’s a woodpecker.
“How are we doing this?” Harry asked. He reached out and slid his hand up Draco’s thigh, and Draco shivered, his legs falling open.
“I don’t blame him,” Dean said, squeezing by Ron and Hermione to help Hannah begin unloading foil containers of takeaway and arrange them on the table. “Malfoy’s fit as any Quidditch player.”
“Yeah, pretty much,” Harry said miserably. “And for the love of god, don’t let him hear you call him that. The next month is going to be difficult enough to get through without the two of you at each other’s throats.”
Pansy turns abruptly away from him and picks up her clutch from the table. “But lucky for you, I’ve grown up. I’m not the same girl you knew at Hogwarts.” She twists the lipstick down in one quick motion and recaps it with a sharp click before she drops the tube into her clutch. “I understand you were in a horrible situation. And I’ve forgiven you.” She snaps her clutch shut with a decisive clack.
. He goes on for an entire chapter about how he gets his hair so shiny.”
“You wanted to live,” Harry says. “You made the decision to come back when the Muggles shocked you. They can start your body up again, but they can’t force you to live. You chose to live.”
“What’s that?” Draco asks, partly from curiosity, partly to cover his nerves.
- - - - - -
The incredulous look Potter gives him at that is almost comical, the butter knife dangling from his fingers as he gapes at Draco. “What? No! Malfoy, you nearly died. I don’t think you should even be out of bed, much less going to work.”
“I’m not the one with an enchanted motorcycle in the shed,” Draco says with a shrug.
He escapes the drawing room and heads back to the entrance hall. There are still ten minutes before Potter should arrive, but Draco doesn’t mind that. Confronting his parents turned out to be tremendously anticlimactic, and now he’s got this knot of anxiety tightening in the pit of his stomach because what if the worst is yet to come?
He doesn’t stomp as he goes up the stairs and locks himself in the bathroom. He turns up the water as hot as he can stand it, then takes off his clothes and gets into the shower. His skin stings and turns pink, and Draco stays under it until thick clouds of steam swirl against the ceiling, and the worst of his anger has been washed away.
“Ah, no,” Draco admits. “But it’s, I can assure you it’s quite important. I’m afraid I can’t tell you more than that.”
“Malfoy, fuck, Malfoy,” Potter gasps out against Draco’s mouth just before his cock throbs in Draco’s hand, spurting long white streaks over his fingers.
“I’m glad,” Draco says, and means it.
but really is her stopping by to pass along all the most recent goings-on of their small stretch of Diagon Alley. Dorothea is a shameless gossip, but Draco doesn’t mind too much. He’s careful to keep the details of his own life as bland and uninteresting as possible, so as not to become the subject of her gossiping. But he likes hearing about other people. Especially the ongoing saga of Mr and Mrs Hobbs—they own the flower shop two doors down—which is a bigger source of entertainment than any of the radio dramas Draco plays on the wireless in the evenings. They’re on the same side of the street as Draco, so Dorothea’s got a better view from her shop of their goings-on.
And Draco shrugs helplessly. “I think this is where I was two mornings ago. But it’s hard to say for certain.” He looks around again. “It was darker then, and I was…” He presses a palm over his ribs where the arrow went in.
Draco arched an eyebrow, practically daring Harry to call him on it. Distantly, Harry knew he was being manipulated. The fact that Draco knew him so well was as much a curse as it was a blessing. Draco had always had a knack for finding Harry’s buttons and knowing exactly how hard to push them to get what he wanted. He’d been good at it when they were children, and had only got better at it the longer he spent with Harry.
Hermione gives his arm a tug and Harry stumbles over the kerb. It’s daytime. He’s in the middle of Diagon Alley. He yanks his arm free, and Hermione whirls around to face him.
,” Malfoy casts again, and his grip on Harry’s wrist goes slick with blood. His wand clatters to the floor of the lift and he wrenches Harry’s hand around until their bloody palms are pressed against each other. He’s squeezing Harry’s hand so hard it makes the bones ache, and their blood drips onto the floor of the lift.
Harry picked up the spring form pan and turned toward the oven, and made it two steps before the bottom fell out. Cheesecake batter splattered across the floor, oozing cold and sticky across Harry’s bare toes and spattering the cuffs of his jeans, leaving him standing and staring dumbly down at the mess, still holding uselessly to the empty ring.
Privately, Draco would bet his last dented Knut that they offered him a discount because he’s the Boy Who Lived. But he knows money can be a touchy subject with the Weasleys, and even splitting the cost of the cauldron a dozen ways, it’s still a bit pricier than he’s comfortable with them spending on him.
“I feel fine,” Draco insists, which is entirely true. The pain potion is still doing its job admirably, and Draco can’t quite suppress a touch of pride at that. He is quite good at brewing.
“He’s fine, Draco,” Blaise drawled in a bored tone, though Harry didn’t miss the amusement lighting up his features. Neither did Draco, though he held his tongue and settled for rolling his eyes with a huff.
“Karkaroff, maybe?” Crabbe offered, brows pinched in thought.
“Take care of him, Malfoy.”
“Draco.”
Chuckling in disbelief, Draco said, “You’re not. An annoying git with a smart mouth maybe, but I like that about you,” he teased before sobering. “The Dark Lord attacked you when you were an infant and placed a target on your back, but that was never any fault of yours, Harry.”
It hummed in consideration. “Would you prefer this conversation take place in your head?”
Toasting him with his goblet, Theo said, “Congratulations. You’ve been adopted by our mother hens.”
“Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine. Go enjoy your evening.” Noting the ring of concerned faces, he said, “I think I’ll call it an early night, actually. Thanks again for everything, guys. See you in the morning.”
Sipping his water to cool the heat rising along his face, he hoped the man couldn’t see his flush in the dim light. “I was merely proving a point.”
Draco frowned as the bond between them flooded with a rush of anxiety and a hefty dose of fear. Since the acknowledgement of their connection was new, the influx of each other's emotions was more keenly felt, and Draco didn’t like the boulder taking up residence in his intestines that mirrored the weight in Harry’s.
Draco collapsed on Vince’s bed while Pansy warded the room. Sighing heavily from his spot on Goyle’s trunk, Theo said, “I told them about the panic attack in McGonagall’s office and the confrontation with Dumbledore.” Draco shot him a tired thumbs up from his sprawled position.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mr. Creevey, why have you interrupted my lesson?” Colin swallowed hard and shifted nervously.
Draco frowned slightly as he digested the information. Raising her hands in a placating gesture, Hermione continued, “I’m simply trying to prepare you, should something asinine fall out of his mouth. Just...don’t run, Malfoy. Give him a chance to process, if he needs it. That’s all I’m asking. Is that fair?”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry lamented.
A blinding flash of light flooded the room, washing his rain-scented magic across all present, leaving the cool tingling of his indignation prickling their skin.
“It’s not just you,” Harry rushed to say, desperate to remove the insecurity casting shadows in his eyes. He was wholly unprepared for the return of Draco’s adoring gaze with his impulsive admission and blushed furiously.
would never...He’s like a brother, Ronald!”
Draco coughed to break the stunned silence that followed his pronouncement and shuffled closer to the boy next to him.
Hermione grinned as they entered the hushed hospital ward. “I agree. I dearly wish Umbridge had fallen for it instead of Harry, but even I can admire its brilliance.”
“Heir Potter, it is a pleasure to meet you officially,” she said, her voice surprisingly kind, yet commanding.
With no after dinner speech from Dumbledore to keep them, they hurried through the hall after dessert to avoid a confrontation. No one in the group spoke as Draco steered them toward the dungeons rather than Gryffindor tower, their eyes piercing the shadows and scanning the alcoves for signs of trouble. Reaching the common room miraculously unscathed, they draped themselves dramatically across the leather furniture and Harry resisted the urge to snort at their theatrics.
Flashing him a smirk, Draco stretched out his legs and crossed them genteelly at the ankle. “We ally with him, of course. Well, the Slytherins and myself, anyway. You can maintain your disdain for him to keep up appearances if you prefer.”
Spinning to face Harry with a manufactured sneer, Snape growled. “Get your things and go. I want twelve inches on how peppermint counteracts the deadly effects of belladonna to make up for missing class, Potter.” He turned away after Harry mumbled an affirmative and snapped his fingers imperiously.
Exhaling raggedly, he sighed. “I do. The reasons are simple. Girls don’t interest me. I’ve tried; it was a disappointment for all parties involved.” Hermione frowned disapprovingly but didn’t interrupt.
“Oh, Merlin,” he sighed as an explosion of vanilla and caramelized sugar melted in his mouth, sending the group into a chorus of delighted laughter as they dug into their crème brûlée.
Harry quickly turned away from his taller, broader frame with a furious blush. His gut churned with inadequacy when he realized he was surrounded by blokes appropriately proportioned for their age. They were growing into their jawlines and filling out their clothes as they packed on muscle and gained inches overnight, but he was “stunted.” Cursed to never reach his full potential; doomed to remain the runt of their year.
I hope you like it because as I said, I have some revising to do on what I have currently written and then I have to finish it, as well. So updates will be sporadic, but they will happen. Thank you so much to everyone reading! I appreciate it so much and I love your comments and kudos. They mean so very much to me!
Stepping out of his hiding place in the far bookshelves with wide eyes, Draco hurried to the table and snatched the list of names Granger had been working on. His heart skipped several beats when he read his name at the top. Shoving the list in his robes, he quickly gathered his things from a nearby table and hurried out.
Not only did Draco look at him like he mattered, but he took care of him. It wasn’t something he was used to after years of conditioning to be independent and then three years amongst Gryffindors who never quite understood his oddities or how to handle them. But it was definitely something he appreciated, though he lacked the words to express it.
Grabbing the empty glass on the table, Draco cast an
Ice settled in Harry’s gut when he realized who Malfoy meant. There couldn’t be anyone else capable of reducing the proud scion of pureblood elitism to this shocking display of emotion. Shame coursed hot up his throat as he watched him break. Instead of assuming the worst and stalking him, he should have shown compassion and offered to help.
A choked whine slipped past his lips without permission as he cupped Draco’s face. “I promise,” he swore. “But you must promise me, no matter what you hear, no matter how long it takes, that you will stay safe. I can’t fight a war if I’m worried about you.”
“Oh, nicely done, Blaise! That shape enhances your face and makes your eyes more visible,” Theo said, tilting his head and checking the angles.
Ignorant of the boys’ power struggle, Severus heaved a sigh at the floor. “I’ve made many mistakes in my life, but the way I’ve treated you is one of my biggest.”
It was an accident: a simple graze as he shifted their position, nothing more. Though the traitorous heat coiling in his abdomen and the uptick of his pulse gave away how much he wished it had been a conscious action. Stamping down his desire, he continued to inch off the bed, affection warring with his protective instincts when he cast a final glance to Harry at the door.
“Harry,” Draco protested weakly. He didn’t deserve the effort the stubborn Gryffindor was going through for his sorry hide.
OMG GUYS! The response to this story has been amazing. Thank you for every lovely comment and kudo. They keep me going!
Pansy burst into giggles at the image. It set the rest of them off and snapped the strange tension that had steadily increased since Snape’s confession. When they finally calmed down, she dabbed her eyes to make sure she didn’t need a cosmetic charm to fix her makeup.
Tipping his face up by his chin, Harry smiled warmly at the boy he was supposed to hate. A brilliant bloke with his whole life ahead of him; a life full of promise and light and love. A life he wouldn’t allow Lucius to rob him of, branded forever as one of Voldemort’s followers.
“I know, Draco, so am I, but it’s okay,” he reassured him.
Crabbe choked on his bacon, and Goyle clapped him on the back. “And Snape just gave us its location?” he asked incredulously when he could speak again.
“Hey, hey. It’s okay, Harry, you’re safe. I need you to breathe with me.”
Sliding his free hand behind Harry’s neck, Draco adjusted the angle and dipped his face to meet him. “I love you,” he sighed against his lips.
Harry, worry his fingers to the bone and shoot uncertain glances in his direction. He read every fear, clear as day, on his pale, pinched features and his heart clenched painfully. Harry was supposed to be indestructible, an untouchable force against the Dark. He hated seeing him so lost.
Clutching the front of Harry’s shirt to remain upright as he trembled in fear, Draco’s mouth dipped to his ear.
After a long moment of uncomfortable silence, Harry unloosed his tongue. “My mother?” he whispered.
“I-I didn’t,” Harry argued. “It wasn’t me.”
Rolling his tumbler between his palms, Draco gathered his scattered thoughts before explaining what he’d learned about the Gryffindors’ gaslighting. When he reached the part of the story detailing Harry’s panic attacks, he slammed back the rest of his whisky and forced the sordid details of the boy’s childhood abuse through clenched teeth.
Once the door closed behind them, Cho rocked on her heels anxiously, though her voice was steady when she spoke. “How may I help you, Professor?”
“Shit,” Cedric sighed, pinching his forehead with a hand. “You’re certain?”
Spinning on her heel, she stormed out of the library. Dithering for a moment with indecision, Ron swore under his breath and grabbed his bag to chase after the witch.
As the feast wound down, everyone’s attention turned to the Goblet as the flames flared blue. The sconces along the wall immediately dimmed and Dumbledore strode forward as the first singed piece of paper flew out of the magical fire.
“The famed Come and Go room,” Draco breathed, finishing Theo’s sentence. “Yes, I think it is.”
Flashing him a shy smile, Harry disappeared behind the green velvet curtains and tried to catch his breath. So much had happened in a few scant hours, but he honestly didn’t regret any of it. Accepting his former rival into the fold and spilling his darkest secrets to him didn’t feel wrong after what Draco did for him over the summer. If that didn’t prove where his loyalties truly lied, then Harry didn’t know what would.
“May I say something?” Draco searched her face for a moment before nodding. “Harry is a wonderful person, as you’ve already mentioned, but he’s a bit dense regarding feelings. There is a high possibility he returns your affection, but he doesn’t know it himself.”
Harry nodded again, his eyes slipping shut to concentrate on synching their respirations to the steady four-count, filling Draco with pride at Harry’s implicit trust and reaffirming his oath to never break it. Hearing footsteps and murmurs as the adults approached, Draco cast a quick muffling charm to prevent Harry from becoming distracted. When Madam Pomfrey and Severus peeked around the curtain, he shook his head and they ducked out without a word.
Harry’s heart slammed against his ribs as Draco’s words settled over him like a comforting blanket, shattering any lingering doubt of their suitability. Touched by his chivalry, Harry pressed his chest against his back and wrapped his arms around him, smiling when Draco melted into the embrace and relief hummed through their connection.
“So, cousins?” Krum rumbled, asking the question on the other Champions’ minds.
, and I couldn’t find any fault in it.”
He didn’t know what to think anymore, except that he didn’t regret his choice. The sheer multitude of unanswered questions regarding his former housemates proved he never knew them at all.
“I hate asking a student to do such a thing, especially when the other is incapacitated, but it seems we have little choice.”
“Bloody unbelievable,” Cedric muttered after exhausting his more colourful curses.
“Teekey,” he called. A petite house-elf in a sunshine yellow pillowcase instantly appeared with the summons.
“Could be his ticket back in, perhaps?” Pansy said tentatively. The group hummed in consideration while Harry struggled to absorb the fact that Krum’s headmaster was a former Death Eater.
“Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall said primly, forcing him to let go of Draco far sooner than he liked.
Severus listened with admiration as Theodore Nott—son of a Death Eater serving a life sentence in Azkaban—explained he’d found a way for the poster child of the Light to be re-sorted into a House known for Dark wizards. The
“I could ask you the same,” Hermione quipped, careful to keep her tone light, so he knew she was teasing. He chuckled, buoyant and bright, untainted by his cruel sneer, and she was struck by the difference between this Malfoy and the one she was familiar with. This boy was surprisingly likeable, and he’d mustered a great deal of courage to willingly bare his vulnerabilities. But she had to be sure this wasn’t a way to get close to Harry on someone’s orders and leave him brokenhearted in the end.
“Where are you going?” he asked curiously.
Pressing a soft kiss to his throat, Draco whispered, “I love you, too, and I have my own promises to keep, you know?” His lips curled into a wicked smirk when Harry’s breath hitched.
A shrill cry yanked Harry out of his mindless rage. Breaking eye contact with the Headmaster, he grinned when Fawkes swooped down from Dumbledore’s private quarters upstairs, depositing the Sorting Hat with a soft
A strangled whimper reached Harry’s ears, and he spun with a gasp, dropping to his knees in front of Draco as he struggled to breathe. “Draco, listen to my voice. You need to breathe.”
Spinning on her heel, she raced back and launched into his arms with a laugh. “Oh my god, Harry James Potter! Why am I friends with you, you insufferable prat?”
Harry shook his head. “No, I do. I really do.”
Theo’s blue eyes sparkled with triumph, and Draco clapped him on the shoulder. Turning to Harry, Draco furrowed his brow. “Is this what you want? A re-sort? Another chance to be a Slytherin?”
Draco chuckled weakly as he tugged Harry’s hair, the answering groan of approval travelling straight to his cock. “I hate this bird’s nest atop your head unless my fingers are buried in it or the wind is whipping it when you fly.” He moaned when Harry nipped his earlobe. “It should be illegal to let you on a broom. No one should look that delicious in Quidditch leathers.”
The fierceness etched on Draco’s features crumbled Severus’ resolve. His godson wasn’t wrong about any of it. The tournament was dangerous and someone entered Potter’s name for reasons unknown, though they certainly weren’t benign. And yes, they needed to keep the blasted boy alive if they were to have a hope and a prayer of surviving the coming war.
As they left the room, they discussed the ingenuity of the Weasley’s curse, picking apart the intricate spellwork and complicated potioneering with enthusiasm. Hermione admired Malfoy’s intelligence. It was incredibly refreshing to break down the components and gush over the layering technique without having to stop and explain the finer points along the way.
The elf’s saucer-sized eyes were even larger as he stared, and Harry couldn’t help laughing when he kneeled on the ground and opened his arms in invitation. Dobby squealed through his excited tears and launched himself into the offered embrace.
“Hermione,” he pleaded, “please tell me you’ve found something.”
care for you. Else he wouldn’t talk about you incessantly and worry if you’re getting enough to eat.”
“Ah, Mr. Potter, we meet again,” the Hat chuckled.
Mouth agape and cheeks flaming, Draco shuffled his feet, expecting a reprimand, but Harry linked their hands with a shy smile. “If I didn’t want to kiss you, Draco, I would’ve said no.”
“My boy —”
“It’s really that bad, then?” Crabbe asked, voice gentler than Harry had ever heard it. He screwed his eyes shut to stem the prickle of tears in response to the larger boy’s concern.
While Draco cared how the public viewed him, here—in the privacy of his dorm—he was free to roll up his trousers and work the custard-like cream into his toned calves without fear of judgement. Knowing that he was included in the select few Draco trusted, lit a bonfire in Harry’s chest and he hoarded the vision of the carefree Prince like a niffler.
“I’ll help,” Blaise growled, thumbing his wand.
His godfather shook his head with a faint smile. “Easier than falling asleep.”
“Oh, Draco,” Myrtle sniffled.
Taking the hint with a huff, McGonagall broke the seal and hastily read it. Her eyes stopped moving when she reached the end, but they watched as she thoroughly read it a second time, carefully absorbing every word. Lowering the parchment with trembling hands, McGonagall stared at him with a mixture of shock and confusion.
“My boy, we could use —”
Draco’s heart fluttered in response to his bold declaration, forcing him to grip the chair to keep from launching himself into Harry’s lap for a heady snog.
Snorting in amusement, McGonagall said, “It was fool-proof and I would be lying if I said she didn’t deserve it.” Flicking her eyes to the ward, she sighed. “It’s terrible to see Mr. Potter in her place, however. Poor lad.”
about the Dursleys and the basilisk, but he’d done nothing. And he dared call himself an advocate for the Light.
“I’d just discovered an entire universe hidden in the heart of London,” Harry continued. “A world I should have grown up in but was wholly ignorant of. Dumbledore tasked Hagrid with taking me shopping for supplies and during one of his rambling explanations about Hogwarts, he said Slytherin House had a reputation for producing Dark wizards.” He shook his head sadly. “The idea that something could tarnish this new world terrified me. And yeah, you didn’t help your case when you insulted the first person who was ever nice to me and then proudly announced before our sorting which House you wanted.”
Pansy winked at Harry when they reached the hall. “Shall we dine, darlings?”
Smiling softly to allay her fear, she said, “I’m sure you’ve heard of Mr. Potter’s…predicament.” The girl flushed slightly and nodded.
“Thank you,” Harry muttered. Residual shame from the encounter had him wishing for a hole to open up and swallow him for being a nuisance.
Toeing off his trainers, he stood up and nudged them under the bed, sadly releasing Draco’s steadying hand for the first scan. A scroll appeared and automatically filled in the blank page with his information.
Squeezing their joined hands, Draco asked uncertainly, “Did you hear what I said while you were sleeping?”
What did that say about him? Was he no better than the one responsible for Malfoy’s anguish? That was a sobering comparison and one Harry truly didn’t want to dwell on.
Pulling back sadly, Draco suppressed the bitter sob lodged in his throat. He wouldn’t cry here—it was too open. Swiping his thumb along Harry’s cheekbone in goodbye, he gasped when his eyelids fluttered, slowly revealing a pair of piercing green eyes.
“But what
“He has potential, I will admit,” Phineas Black’s unsilenced portrait said. For whatever reason, the half-arsed endorsement of the man he cared about from one of his distant relatives broke Draco’s composure.
to? How many nights had he lain awake in the tower, staring at the hand that rejected the first wizard he met any time things soured between his housemates and wondered “What if?” before burying those traitorous thoughts in the darkest part of his heart?
He shifted on the settee and said, “It’s a stag. Like my dad’s.”
“Good. Now, return to the dormitory. Find me after you’ve spoken to Potter. Good night, Draco.” Nodding formally, Draco wished him good evening and exited the chambers with far less flair than earlier, leaving the man to his thoughts.
Breaking apart bashfully, they scurried toward her, and she greeted them with a dazzling smile. “Hello, boys. Did you enjoy your fly?”
“Good day, Ms. Skeeter,” Blaise replied coolly, trailing his friends at a leisurely pace to give the others ample time to flee while acting as a buffer against the foul woman. When he strolled into the classroom a few moments after them, he found Draco in whispered conversation with Professor Snape and Harry squished between Theo and Pansy, his expression set in an unsettlingly blank mask.
As though reading his mind, silver eyes met his across the hall and Harry’s grin slipped. A mixture of uncertainty and hope bubbled in his chest as Malfoy’s laugh trailed off when their gazes locked.
“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, might I borrow Ms. Chang?” McGonagall asked in the middle of third period. The man blinked in surprise at the unexpected interruption but readily agreed.
Meeting Harry’s gaze, he held it earnestly. “I know words will not be enough, but I am so very sorry. I haven’t been fair to you in the past, however, if I’m to be your new Head of House I need you to understand that I
Pomfrey pursed her lips but maintained her professionalism when she informed Harry that she would place him on a nutrition potion regimen. On top of three square meals a day, the potions would help him reach an average weight. His Head of House readily agreed, reminding Harry that the additional rigours of the tournament required him to be as healthy as possible.
With a wan smile, Severus smoothed his robes and summoned a self-inking quill and parchment. No one dared speak as the nib scratched across the page. A few minutes later, he cast a quick dry spell on the page and moved to his desk to drip sealing wax on the folded parchment. After pressing his serpent seal into the green wax, he returned his attention to them.
“Thank you, Pansy. I will,” he said.
Leaning into the gentle touch, Harry’s eyelids fluttered as affection washed over him. He could feel the protectiveness in Draco’s actions and he knew, despite rumours to the contrary, that the Slytherin’s heart wasn’t cold.
Severus had a point. Assuring students were safe in the castle was the Headmaster’s job and it rankled that the man didn’t seem to care about Harry’s tenuous position within his House.
A hand snagged her hooded robe as she passed an empty room, but another clamped over her mouth before she could scream.
Leaving his shirt undone, Draco shrugged nonchalantly to disguise his nerves and pretended he didn’t notice Harry’s eyes lingering on his torso while he fought the urge to preen.
He laughed as her Irish accent tickled his ears. “I definitely will, Miss Davis.”
Inclining his head a fraction, Snape said, “I suggest you find a tutor to stay abreast of your studies. The tournament is not an excuse to slack off, Mr. Potter. However, the first task is in three weeks, and you will need time to master new spells in preparation. If you check the back of your timetable, I’m sure you’ll find the information illuminating,” he drawled before sweeping out of the hall.
With difficulty, Harry shoved down the overwhelming emotions attempting to claw out of his chest and rasped. “I-I know I have no right to ask, but can you...can you promise not to leave? People have a habit of abandoning me. My parents, my godfather, the Weasleys, Hermione, even Dumbledore. I’m not strong enough to be alone, not after years spent —”
His cheeks flushed prettily and Hermione smirked. “Come on, Prince Charming. Time to wake Snow White.”
Steeling himself for the awful truth of what the diagnostic spells would reveal, he nodded. “I’d like Draco and Professor Snape to be present, if that’s alright.”
“I’m listening, Draco. Don’t keep me in suspense,” Severus warned.
Jerking his head to him in surprise, Draco asked, “You knew?”
Shaking his head violently, Draco doubled over and focused on choking down the bile scorching his esophagus. Scrambling off the desk with a gasp, Harry dashed to his side, hands hovering to offer help in case he became sick.
“But, I thought...you said these were for Dumbledore?”
“Harry!” They both suppressed a groan as Hermione appeared looking mildly panicked with Ron pulling up the rear. “Where have you been? We’ve searched everywhere for you, but we couldn’t find the map —”
Covering his face in his hands, Harry whined, “I just want one normal year. Is that too much to ask?”
He shrugged again. “Won’t know ‘til you try.”
“The Lady has accepted his oath,” Cedric piped up from the corner. “I have no problem with Malfoy attending the proceedings.”
Their reaction mystified the adults and left them more than a little curious of what the Hat had gleaned about the new dynamic between the former rivals. While Severus was prudent enough to not push the issue now, his narrowed eyes told Draco he had some explaining to do later.
at me and I’m not so stupid to realize it’s not the way a grown man should look at a boy, especially a boy he’s related to. I’m scared of what will happen when I go back.”
Cradling her head in her hands in her private quarters, Pomfrey sighed in exhaustion. “I don’t know what else to do, Minerva. I’ve done all I can and researched every restricted tome I could get my hands on about poison and curses.”
When he left, Harry spun to Draco with wide, frightened eyes. “What’s going on?”
“We’re all guilty of bullying, though,” Blaise said.
the Hat where to put you?”
Draco’s scowl deepened with each shake of his head as a myriad of questions danced in his head. Why hadn’t his Head of House come for him? Or Dumbledore, for that matter? They knew where he’d taken refuge. Unless...the Gryffindors hadn’t informed McGonagall he was staying outside the tower. But why wouldn’t they tell her? Surely they could twist the story to their benefit and make Harry out to be the villain; it would be believable enough with the rumours swirling that he cheated his way into the tournament. Yet none of those questions explained why the Headmaster hadn’t swooped in to rescue his favourite student from Slytherin’s evil clutches. The man had house-elves spying on him, for fuck’s sake.
Clearing his throat with a blush, Draco slid his hands from Harry’s and rose elegantly to his feet. “I’ll be back in an hour or so. Pansy and the lads will keep you occupied.”
Running a hand across the opulent duvet in the quiet, Harry spoke first. “Without you, none of this would be possible. I don’t have the words to properly thank you, but I hope you know how much this means to me.”
Tumbling out of the Pensieve with a scream, Harry clutched the desk and gasped through his earth-shattering sobs. His entire life was a lie. The past year on the run destroying Horcruxes and slowly starving in a cramped tent hadn’t led to the end of Voldemort alone. While he’d always been willing to lay down his life without a thought, knowing that Dumbledore groomed him for death gutted him.
Merlin, how long had he wanted someone to see him? Better yet, how long had he wanted
He trembled uncontrollably and his breaths turned shallow as fear overrode his brain. Flicking his eyes around the curtained space, his heart rate spiked. It was too small, too tight, too close. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t breathe. Why couldn’t he breathe?
“Flibbertigibbet,” Harry mumbled to the portrait. He grimaced when the Fat Lady sniffed disapprovingly at him but said nothing in his defence as it swung open.
His throat closed when he recalled his friend’s reactions and those of his other housemates. Plopping on the floor, he sighed heavily and curled his arms around his knees, burying his face in the little hollow as tears spilled across his cheeks.
Fiddling with the coverlet, Draco’s chest tightened when he caught sight of the scar on Harry’s left hand. Trailing his fingertips over the words etched in a familiar scrawl, he cursed the vile toad for maring him. Taking a steadying breath with difficulty, he slotted his fingers through Harry’s and barreled on.
where he is.” Severus frowned contemplatively as the boy worked out his theory. “Surely the Headmaster is also aware the Goblet was tampered with and that he didn’t put his name in there by choice. The only reason he’s left Harry with us is because —”
The explosion of their magic throughout the room didn’t shock either of them, but they moaned in unison when their individual signatures tangled and combined into something new. Something uniquely
Harry holds up his hand and tugs his cuff back, showing off a braided leather cord knotted around his wrist. “Got it.”
For someone who had gone through a tremendous amount of training and fulfilled endless lists of strict certification requirements for his career, Draco certainly liked to play fast and loose with basic lab safety. That had been one of the first rules Snape had pounded into their tender adolescent skulls back at Hogwarts: never eat or drink anything in a potions lab. The risk of accidentally consuming ingredients or half-brewed potions could have disastrous results, to say nothing of what might happen if the food contaminated the potion and upset the delicate balance of ingredients and magic. Snape had driven the point home by telling them in grisly detail what had happened to a former student of his who’d smuggled food into the classroom, and one of his Chocolate Frogs hopped into his cauldron. Harry shuddered just thinking of it now.
Draco thinks it over for a moment. They told Zelda already, and Draco hasn’t spoken to his other friends in, Merlin, has it really been half a year since the last time he’d met Pansy for drinks? “No,” he says. “I’ll need to tell my parents tomorrow. That’s another thing I wanted to speak to you about. Every Monday I go to the Manor for dinner. If I’m in a serious relationship with someone…”
“Here’s hoping,” Potter says, picking up a book and flipping it open before closing it again and setting it aside. “The other morning I was nearly desperate enough to
of drinking,” Park put in.
“I don’t know,” Harry said with a shrug. “I sort of like getting you all riled up like this.”
“What did you bring me today?” he asked, already leaning over to unfold the top of the bag.
“Bludger, cauldron. They’re both made of iron,” Potter says, and Draco considers pointing out that cauldrons aren’t made of iron, most of them are made of pewter. But frankly it feels like too much effort, and he’s not sure he’d be able to tell the difference between getting knocked over the head with one or knocked over the head with the other, so it’s probably a moot point. And he’d already known how terrible Potter is at Potions, no need to point it out again. “I’m sure your Healer will be in with something for it in a moment.”
