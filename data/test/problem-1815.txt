, which at least meant he was now free to return to his earlier pursuit: trying to look at Potter while pretending he wasn’t looking at Potter.
Draco would linger longest on those dark circles. By most measures, Potter was the picture of a well-adjusted survivor, always smiling at meals and busy chatting and laughing with his friends in the common room, all with an ease that Draco envied. But those dark circles told the truth behind the cheer – they were the one crack in the façade, the damning evidence that not all could be as rosy as it seemed in the Chosen One’s world.
“Calm down, Pans,” he grumbled, trying to extricate himself from her embrace as the pain in his side became too much to bear. “I’m not dead yet, you just said it yourself. Now get off, will you? You’re hurting me.”
But there were voices now, faint but growing closer. He could hear the reality that existed beyond this room, beyond this moment. Hard as he tried to will it away, he knew that any second now, whatever private world they had created would cease to exist.
Things shifted slightly after that. The change wasn’t dramatic, or instantaneous. Time went on as it had before, the days filled with a repeating pattern of classes, studying, potion experiments, and hidden kisses. And somewhere in the routine of it all, there were small moments in which the difference could be felt.
It was all Potter’s fault, he concluded, shaking himself out of his daze and heading across the hall to the showers. It was Potter’s fault that he had felt so weird and unsettled since coming back to Hogwarts, Potter’s fault that Pansy had started insinuating crazy things, Potter’s fault that he was now doubting his own sanity.
Potter looked caught between a laugh and a frown, like he wasn’t sure if it was okay to find it funny or not. The result was a sad, conflicted sort of half-smile. After a second, more pointed glare from Granger, Weasley gave a murmured apology in Potter’s direction. Draco wasn’t sure why he was apologising to Potter of all people for making a joke about Snape, but Potter just waved it away.
Draco swallowed. Aside from his Mark, the only other scars he had were on his chest, and he knew not even the largest of bowls would be able to soak his entire torso. There was only one valid alternative he could think of, but the suggestion seemed to stick in his throat.
Weasley didn’t seem keen to let the subject drop. “Alright, sure, let’s say he is. I just don’t see why you have to be involved with it.” Draco tried to get a better angle, but Weasley’s back filled his view. All he could see of Potter was the edge of his right shoulder and a few particularly wild locks of hair.
The key final ingredient, and it was something he had never even considered, something he never would have found without Potter.
She brushed past him, reaching the door just before Potter. The dark-haired boy stepped back to let her pass, turning slightly towards Draco as he did.
“Well, I think I might have some answers for you. First of all, you should know what we have identified the person who attacked you—it was a third year Hufflepuff, named Miranda McKinnon. Do you know her?”
“I swear, what was even the point of coming back to finish your N.E.W.T.s if you two can’t even be bothered to put in a minimal amount of effort?” Granger shook her head in exasperation, looking thoroughly put out as she began to put back all the belongings she had just dumped out of her bag.
He snatched his wand from the bedside table. One simple spell later and all of the décor in the room had turned a muted shade of aubergine. The effect was quite ugly, but Draco sat back, satisfied. Aubergine he could live with.
, repeating it in an endless and unproductive litany. “We should—we should keep working, though. We might be able to come up with something before then.”
“Then it would have been well deserved, wouldn’t it?” Draco kept his tone light, although it felt like anything but a joke.
Perhaps he was overreacting. It was hardly his fault that everyone had chosen to stay and watch their quarrel rather than heed the bell; they hadn’t even drawn their wands, after all, and even the insults they’d exchanged had been rather tame. Not to mention, if they were in trouble, surely Slughorn would have asked Weasley to stay as well.
“What are you talking about?” Blaise put a hand over his heart in mock outrage. “I loved that guy! Remember all those lovely letters he used to send?” Blaise adopted a simpering voice. “’Oh Pansy, my dearest, I simply cannot wait another minute until we are together! I long for the day I can take your precious and definitely-still-intact virginity!’”
Flustered, he parted his legs, trying to move them away from all the places on Potter’s body that were far too close, and yet somehow not close enough. He saw his mistake almost instantly as Potter stepped forward into the open space between Draco’s knees, as far as the ledge would allow him to go. His hand slid from where Draco still held it loosely against his chest, up to the space just beneath Draco’s jaw, right over the pounding of his pulse.
“Yeah, sure.” Potter smiled, leaning forward to rest his elbows on the table. “So, with these potions – you want to try and make a better one, that can actually heal scars from dark magic?”
Draco passed the stirring rod to Potter. “I think it might help amplify the transfigurative properties of the potion,” he explained, making note of the ingredient’s effects in the small leather-bound journal balanced on his knee. “I was inspired by my recent brush with petrification. We’re just lucky Slughorn still had some mature Mandrakes left over.”
Mercifully, Pansy released him, although the look of concern on her face remained. “You’re in pain?” she fretted, taking hold of his left hand, which rested limply against the bedcovers. It was odd, Draco noticed, but he could not quite feel his fingers as she interlaced them with hers. “Should I get Madam Pomfrey?”
Potter and his clingy friends were nearing the door. This was his chance. “I’ll be there, Pans, I promise,” Draco insisted. “Just give me ten minutes, alright?”
“Oh, er.” Potter instinctively pulled the parchment he was holding closer to himself, as if to hide it. For the first time, Draco noticed that there was also a book open on Potter’s lap, which seemed to be serving a dual purpose as a writing surface while Potter took notes. Upon closer inspection, the page of the book that wasn’t covered by Potter’s notes did appear to be a list of instructions for a potion, complete with tiny sketches of the ingredients. “It’s not for class. It’s just… some research.”
Pansy pushed herself up from the chair that she had made her home over the last few days. “I’m not remanding you to your room or anything,” she said, reaching for his discarded pyjamas. Draco winced as he watched her shove them unceremoniously into his bookbag. “I just don’t want to end up right back here tomorrow morning, alright?”
He had been startled when the door of the empty potions classroom he was working in opened not half an hour later, Potter’s eyes bright and face still somewhat red as he came to sit across from Draco.
Draco swatted Potter’s hand away from the piece of synthetic skin that rested on the table between them, although he could understand the Gryffindor’s impatience. After Potter had vanished the remnants of the potion that had spilled over Draco’s legs last week, they’d had to start from scratch, and replicating the exact mishap that had somehow led to a moment of success turned out to be much more complex than either of them anticipated. It had taken them nearly three days of work to find the right timing and temperature, and finally,
“I’ve been taking it easy for three and a half days,” he told her as he pulled on his shirt. “Even I have my limits on how many hours I can spend reading alone in bed.”
Draco didn’t have to ask what he meant. He had wondered the same thing, after all, about whether defending Potter might have just been a convenient excuse to attack him. It wasn’t as if the students at Hogwarts made it a secret how unwanted he was—how unwanted all the Slytherin eighth years were, but most especially him, the Death Eater who had never paid for his crimes.
It was only as their hips met, Potter’s hands wrapping around his waist to hold Draco against him, that Draco realized just how hard he still was. The slight pressure was enough to make him sigh in relief, his body desperate for any kind of friction. By the time Potter had undone his belt and trousers, Draco was clutching at Potter’s arms with a kind of desperation that, if he could have seen himself just then, he might have sneered at.
On a selfish level, Draco had also thought about the Mark on his arm, forever a relic of all of his failings. It had faded since Voldemort’s death, but he knew he would never be free of the ugly scar, just as he would never be free of the crimes it represented. But he had to try—if not for himself, then for everyone else who didn’t deserve the scars the war had left them with. And so he had started brewing.
“I don’t even know who all is on the team this year, to be honest,” Draco said. “Even if we have some new players that are strong on their own, they probably haven’t had enough time practicing together to play well as a team.”
, Draco wouldn’t ignore that. He watched Potter’s lips, red and slightly swollen from kissing, waiting for them to form the words that would put an end to all of this.
But the reality was this: he was eighteen years old and standing in front of Potter, chafing against every thorn-covered vine tying them together, and Draco couldn’t do it.
When he finished, Pansy rolled onto her side, propping her head up on her hand. “So this Potions thing is a big deal to you.” Draco nodded. “And Potter has agreed to do it.” Draco nodded again. “So then what’s the problem?”
“The Headmistress is right,” Madam Pomfrey agreed, shooting pointed looks at the two students sitting on either side of Draco’s bed. “Rest is the best medicine. I will give you all another few minutes, but then Mr. Malfoy needs his sleep.”
Lying in bed that night, he could feel the nausea roiling in his stomach, as it always did when it was late, and dark, and he was alone with his thoughts. On the precipice of sleep, his mind lashed out at him, the words and images that he tried so hard to suppress throughout the day forcing themselves to be seen and heard.  The sickness built, seeping through his body, infecting him like a disease. He pushed back at the thoughts that threatened to overwhelm him, struggling to lock them away, but they were persistent.
“Will you tell me sometime?” His voice did not sound like his own. When those green eyes fixed on him, bright with surprise, his breath caught in his throat.
“Perhaps not,” he conceded, mulling over his words before he spoke. He hadn’t imagined Potter would pry this far into his motivations. How much of the truth did Draco have to give before he was convinced? “If you must know, I don’t have a lot of opportunities open to me anymore. The prestige is nice in itself, of course. But if I were to win…” He hesitated only a moment, then ploughed on, “I might actually have a chance of being hired after I leave here.”
Potter’s expression betrayed only a moment of surprise before shifting into a maddening smirk. “I was only looking at your tie,” he replied coolly, nodding his head at Draco’s chest. “What happened, Malfoy? Slytherin not want you anymore? Did you have to create your own House?”
Draco nodded in agreement. Little though he liked the Muggle-born girl, no one could deny she was skilled. Not as good as Draco when it came to Potions, of course, but talented enough, and certainly more so than Potter.
“I only stopped stirring for five seconds!” Potter reached for the stirring rod again. This time, Draco pulled it from the cauldron and held it behind his back, out of Potter’s reach. It was childish, he knew, but in that moment, Draco didn’t care. All he cared about was not letting Potter win whatever fight it was they were having.
After a moment, Potter’s eyes opened, and although he looked slightly dazed, Draco was surprised to see that his gaze had not lost any of its heat. There was something new in the way he was looking at Draco, an intensity almost, but he barely had time to spare it a thought before Potter was reaching out to pull him close once more.
“Obviously,” Draco replied, although that wasn’t really what meant he had meant. In fairness to other students, the eighth years weren’t allowed to participate on their House teams, so neither Draco nor Potter were playing that year. But the Slytherin team had been gutted even beyond that. Across all years, a large number of Slytherins had chosen not to return to Hogwarts, in some cases because their families had had ties to the Dark Lord and in other cases because their families worried about how they might be treated, regardless of their actual allegiances in the war.
Draco shook his head. “Gods, no.” His mother had enough on her plate to worry about. Even though her house arrest had been lifted after Potter spoke on her behalf at her trial, just as he had at Draco’s, she hardly ever left the manor. She seemed permanently on edge these days, always tense and jumpy, and with Lucius locked up in Azkaban for another three years, the only people she spoke to anymore were Draco and the family house elves.
Annoyed by the unexpected teasing, Draco dragged his clouded focus away from the heat of Potter’s thigh, placed so enticingly between his own. There was an odd hesitancy to the sudden change in Potter’s actions that he couldn’t quite interpret. He could feel the desire in Potter’s touch, the eagerness in the movement of his hips. But if Potter wanted this, then what was the problem?
The word—so unfamiliar on Draco’s tongue—fell between them with an unnatural weight. Potter’s eyes went wide, mouth hanging open in a comical expression of disbelief.
Potter sighed. “Fine,” he conceded, glancing at Draco’s still-bare chest. “Do you want to heal the rest of those scars first?”
“Does it seem like it’s working?” Potter frowned at the potion. His hair really needed a trim, Draco thought; the dark locks kept falling into his eyes in a distracting way, and Draco itched to push them back from his face.
Sorry if it feels like not a lot happens in this chapter, the next scene was originally going to be a part of this chapter but I haven't finished it yet and I wanted to post an update just so everyone would know the story hasn't been abandoned or anything. I figured short was better than nothing!
Potter swore and scrambled for his wand, careful to avoid touching any of the spilled liquid as he quickly vanished the potion and came to kneel at Draco’s side, his face lined with worry.
“I don’t know.” Draco pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, trying to organize the chaos in his head. “I haven’t really hated him for a long time, I guess. I’m not so sure anymore that I ever did.”
“I’m getting tired of asking why you’re always here, Potter.” Draco did not look up as he spoke, hoping that his cold tone would be enough to mask his embarrassment.
In that moment, Draco hated her more than ever. It wasn’t a choice at all, not really. Not with the entire class looking at Potter, waiting, the weight of everyone’s expectations dropped on his shoulders. Perfect Potter – golden boy Potter – would never shirk that burden, no matter how much he didn’t want to do it. Draco didn’t need Legilimency to know the debate happening in Potter’s mind, the fight between his own discomfort and the demands of others; he could read it in the stiff line of Potter’s shoulders and the way he shifted in his seat, the bob of his throat as he swallowed before smothering his needs, martyring his feelings for the sake of the role required of him.
Draco took a deep breath before he spoke. “It’s not a problem,” he said, as much to reassure himself as to convince Potter. “We’ll just try soaking it in the potion instead. That should work.”
22 hours and 43 minutes ago – once he was back in the safety of his room, his clothes and skin damp, his heart still pounding from his desperate sprint through the halls and from the arousal still lingering in his body – a singular thought had begun to take over his mind. As the events in the prefects’ bathroom replayed in his head, over and over and over again, the thought only grew harder to ignore. His denials no longer worked; his refusals were beaten back; his wilful obliviousness had been so thoroughly shattered that there was no spell that could save it. The thought had entrenched itself, taking root in his very soul. Or maybe it had always been there, somewhere, buried beneath stiff layers of veneer.
“Don’t get him too worked up, Potter, or Madam Pomfrey will have your head,” she said with a breezy wave. Draco glared at her back as she departed, her shiny dark hair seeming to laugh at him as it disappeared beyond the doors of the Hospital Wing, leaving him alone with Potter.
Draco had been so caught off guard by Potter’s familiarity with his potion-making habits that he hadn’t been able to think of a comeback, and so in the end they had pushed back the tables and spread out their supplies and ingredients on the stone floor. If Potter found it uncomfortable that they were sitting almost knee-to-knee, he made no indication of it. His nonchalance about what had happened—or almost happened—between them should have been a source of relief, considering how anxious Draco was to put the whole thing behind them. But even so, he couldn’t help the slight quickening of his pulse every time Potter leaned forward over the cauldron, his mind automatically calculating the distance left between them.
Draco wrapped his hand around the one that was trying to push him away, pressing it against his face as he took Potter as deep as he could without choking, not breaking his rhythm. For just a second, his eyes flickered up to Potter’s face, meeting his gaze just before Potter gave one last moan, throwing his head back against the wall as he came.
And maybe that was only fair. Maybe he didn’t deserve to like Potter. It had sounded so simple when Potter had said it. It had sounded like a possibility. But that was a cruel hope, when in reality whatever was happening between them was tenuous at best, dangerous at worst. Nothing about it was simple.
“That is quite a relief.” Everyone’s immense relief was beginning to get on Draco’s nerves, seeing as no one had yet bothered to explain why they were all so concerned in the first place. How bad could this curse have been, exactly? “I’m sure you have a few questions.”
Draco thought back to the moments just before the curse had hit him. He knew he had been furious, but he could no longer summon the kind of blood-boiling anger that had driven him then. What exactly had he wanted to say to Potter?
Draco wanted to wipe that shit-eating grin off his stupid freckled face. His wand was halfway drawn when he remembered that he was supposed to be staying out of trouble. Cursing Potter and his friends into oblivion would definitely count as stepping out of line.
They’d reached the main street almost without Draco even noticing. Without the bustle of students, the village was much quieter than he was used to seeing it, almost subdued. Or perhaps the residents had decided to preemptively take shelter, sensing the oncoming rain. Draco steered them towards the apothecary, the dingy glass of its windows and faded sign a familiar sight.
The whole situation felt a bit surreal as Draco passed her his notes, watching the way her shoulders relaxed as she saw his meticulous notetaking. He could feel eyes on him — Potter’s or Pansy’s, or maybe both — but he just went back to his essay, still six inches short of what he needed. They didn’t need to make a big deal about it. He might not have wanted to be in this situation in the first place, but now that they were here, he found it was easier to just pretend everything was fine.
“Yeah, and then what?” Draco folded up the letter, tucking it away in his bookbag along with his neatly folded pyjamas. “She’d be forcing me come home the very next day.”
Pansy and Potter both nodded, looking appropriately chagrined, but Madam Pomfrey was now too busy muttering a series of spells over Draco’s bandaged ribs to notice. At first, the pain seemed to worsen as a powerful burning sensation spread up to his shoulder and down his arm, and Draco had to bite his tongue to keep from crying out. But after a few moments, the pain began to dull, replaced by a mild prickling sensation. Madam Pomfrey stepped back, her lips thin.
It wasn’t a particularly witty or cutting reply, but for a few long seconds, Draco almost thought he’d managed to render Potter speechless. There was a beat of silence, and then abruptly Potter stood, pulling his jumper over his head without ceremony and tossing it aside before beginning to undo his shirt.
“That seems to be the general consensus, yes,” Draco snapped, seizing hold of the books in Potter’s hands. “But I’m not a complete
“What do you mean?” A handful of other students were already in the corridor. He and Blaise had managed to arrive just a few minutes before the bell. “You’re the one who said we were going to be late!”
Draco’s stomach dropped, and he wished more than anything that he could take the question back. “Oh.”
The suggestiveness in her tone was enough to make Draco’s jaw drop. He wanted to protest her offensive statement in some way, but that would require acknowledging the implication, which Draco could not bring himself to do.
When he returned, Potter was just as Draco had left him, although his gaze was now fixed on the slow swirl of the potion as he stirred. Draco resumed his position on the floor, laying out the variety of potions ingredients they now had at their disposal. Potter’s question had rattled him, but the strong, familiar odour of the supply cupboard—an odd mix of verbena, armadillo bile, and the pungent scent of pickled bat spleens—had helped him refocus.
“No, they’re free.” Granger gave them a tentative smile which Pansy returned with a bright smile of her own, immediately making herself comfortable on the sofa. Draco hesitated a moment longer before giving in and taking a seat in the armchair, settling his bookbag at his feet. Like this, he was situated directly across from Potter, simultaneously too close and much too far.
“Just for the record, I don’t hate you.” The words were out of his mouth before the more rational part of his brain could stop him, and immediately he felt the need to explain. “I just mean, you said that I hated you, and that’s not true.” Draco bit down on his tongue, silently chastising himself for how stupid he sounded.
“I’m sorry.” Potter’s fingers pressed softly against his chest, and the scars he had left patterned there. It felt like a lifetime ago that they were in that bathroom, so different than the one they were in now. A lifetime ago that he was the boy full of rage and fear, bleeding on the floor.
With some difficulty, Draco managed to suppress his surging anger, cornering it into a little box in the back of his mind along with the hideous sensation of embarrassment. When he spoke, all that remained was a kind of cold contempt.
“Madam Pomfrey has assured me that you will make a full recovery.” The Headmistress gave him a tight smile. “And Ms. McKinnon will receive appropriate punishment.”
Potter frowned and looked away. “Like I said this morning, I’m not really interested, Malfoy. I don’t even like Potions.”
While Potter was occupied, Draco quickly rid himself of the rest of his clothes, only relaxing a little once he was submerged up to his chest in the warm, cloudy water, deep enough to cover the faded scars across his chest, the ones he hoped Potter hadn’t gotten too good of a look at. A moment later, there was a small splash as Potter slid into the water, mercifully choosing to stay towards the opposite end of the tub from Draco. Although it was quite large, more a small pool than a bathtub, the scant meters between their bare bodies still felt far too close. It was just for twenty minutes, he reminded himself, only twenty minutes to let the potion do its work and then this whole insane evening could be over.
He grabbed a squat glass bottle off the shelf, holding it up briefly to examine the contents before placing it back where it had been wedged above a minuscule label reading
“If those are too heavy for you, maybe we should just go back to the dorms,” he suggested, watching with amusement as she attempted to cram the books into her own bag.
“I guess I still forget, sometimes.” Draco could feel the warmth of his breath as he spoke, a contrast to the chill touch of their damp clothes. “All the things magic can do.”
Draco fell back onto his four-poster, weighed down with the memories he had tried so hard to shut away. He could still see the courtroom in his mind, with its dark stone walls and looming benches. He could feel the chill, both the physical cold and the icy wave of hatred emanating from every person in the room as they looked down on him, sneering at the proud Malfoy family brought so low.
Draco could not help feeling that maybe he had been tricked, but Pansy was now reaching for her copy of the
At the sound of his shout, Madam Pomfrey was out the door of her office in an instant.  Immediately, Potter pulled away, stepping back from the bed as the matron rushed over.
“Let me just buy this and we can get out of here,” Draco said. “Save your poor delicate nose from the
Draco leaned back, staring up at the bed’s canopy. A moment later, he felt Pansy lay down beside him so that they were shoulder to shoulder. It was the same familiar position in which they had spent countless hours in his old Slytherin dormitory, sometimes laughing and sharing secrets and sometimes, when everything seemed too awful for words, just laying there in silence.
Draco stayed in the Charms classroom long after Potter had left, sitting on a desk and staring off into space as he went over their last exchange in his mind again and again. After everything that had happened between them, he never would have believed that he and Potter could have such a benign interaction, let alone one where Potter smiled at him with such unambiguous sincerity. And he definitely never would have believed he would feel so flustered about it.
“Well, it’s not exploding, so that’s a start.” Draco reached for an empty vial, filling it with a small quantity of the brown-coloured concoction. “Let’s test it.”
“Together?” he asked, eyes flickering in Potter’s direction. That one little word was stuck in his mind, the only snag in an otherwise ideal situation. “Do we really have to work together?”
The corridor was quiet, most students still in class. He wasn’t surprised by the sound of footsteps behind, nor did he need to turn to know who it was. He was surprised, though, by the hand on his arm, the touch far too gentle.
Fortunately, Blaise wasn’t the interrogative type, and neither Pansy nor Goyle had continued on to N.E.W.T.-level Potions, which meant Draco was saved from any further prying about his desperate sprint to class.
Their eyes met in the mirror, the icy grey gaze softened with sleep and confusion and the vivid green frozen wide in surprise and something close to fear. His glasses were askew. For a moment, Draco wondered if Potter had been crying; his face was flushed and his cheeks looked damp. But then he noticed the wet strands of hair sticking to his forehead and decided it was much more likely that Potter had just splashed his face with water from the sink before slumping to the floor.
Draco was reaching for his wand when Potter’s hand closed around his arm, pulling him towards the alley between two nearby shops, just barely shielded from the rain by the eaves of the buildings. Too surprised to do anything else, Draco allowed Potter to guide him until they were face to face beneath the meagre shelter, only a handsbreadth between them in the narrow space.
The silence between them stretched like a rubber band, tense and quivering, ready to either snap or break. Potter seemed caught in some sort of internal conflict, chewing on his bottom lip as he watched Draco, turmoil in his eyes. After a long moment, the Gryffindor pushed away from his side of the bath, moving slowly through the water towards Draco.
Draco felt the scrape of teeth as their lips clashed, searching for a rhythm, and this was new, mostly, but it didn’t feel strange. Draco’s right hand was fisted in the fabric of Potter’s shirt, and when he mirrored the gesture with his left, soft dark hair tangling between his fingers, Potter let out a quiet groan and broke away from the kiss, moving only far enough to put a few centimetres of distance between their lips.
“Right,” Potter replied, already moving towards the door. As their eyes met one last time, Potter flashed him a small smile. “See you later, Malfoy.”
to have your help.” He spoke with exaggerated politeness, glaring daggers all the while. “Why don’t we meet tomorrow evening to discuss
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy.” The timely arrival of Madam Pomfrey came as a tremendous relief.  “I am glad to see you awake, although I cannot say I’m surprised, what with all this noise,” the matronly witch admonished as she motioned Pansy out of her way with an impatient gesture. She leaned over the bed to examine Draco’s left side, which for the first time he noticed was rather heavily bandaged. “Ms. Parkinson, Mr. Potter, you both should know better than to raise your voices here, of all places. Next time, take your bickering outside.”
He let his hand fall away from his chest, lifting his gaze to meet Draco’s. His expression was open in a way Draco had not seen before, almost vulnerable, and although he still didn’t quite understand what Potter was saying, not really, Draco didn’t push any further.
“She would,” Potter insisted, either unaware or uncaring of the perilous line he was treading. “And Teddy, he’s great, you’d—”
“If you can’t apologise and act civilly towards one another for the remainder of the lesson, then you can go explain to your Heads of House why both Slytherin and Gryffindor have suddenly lost fifty points.”
, it’s feminine. But if you’re really so bothered, I can take my shrill voice elsewhere.” She looked over at Potter, who had so far showed no signs of leaving, a wicked glint in her eyes. “I’m sure you and
It was only a matter of time really before someone brought it up, and Draco knew better than to expect anyone to express concern about his wellbeing. That didn’t make Finnigan’s harassment any less irritating, though.
He might never have understood the real depth of Potter’s pretence had he not gotten up late one night to go to the bathroom, long after everyone else was asleep. He didn’t notice Potter right away; after the darkness of his dormitory, the light of the bathroom was almost blinding, and he was halfway to the toilets before the reflection in the mirror caught his eye.
Determined not to have another conversation like the one that had left him so confused the other night, Draco murmured his thanks to the Potions Professor and left the room quickly, hurrying to get to the Great Hall where he knew Pansy would be waiting for him at dinner. Unfortunately, he didn’t move fast enough.
“Mr. Malfoy?” He could feel Professor Hayward looking at him, along with the rest of the class. He didn’t take his eyes off Potter.
Two photos accompanied the story: the first was of Potter, looking uncomfortable and yet still somehow noble as he accepted his Order of Merlin, First Class from Kingsley Shacklebolt. The second one was of Draco at his trial.
“No, I will not let you help.” Draco pulled his arm out of Potter’s grasp, which had grown lax. He supposed he could have left then, with Potter no longer holding him in place, or at least he could have put some space between them, seeing how they were standing barely a step apart in the narrow stairwell. But he did neither, only reaching to rub absently at the place on his arm where Potter’s hand had been.
“Can’t tell you boys how thrilled I am you’ll be competing! I think we have a great shot, I really do,” Slughorn beamed, leaning across his desk towards them as he spoke. “I’ve submitted students’ names before, of course, and I remember when Damocles Belby…”
Potter just laughed, the sound echoing off the stone walls of the potions classroom as Draco went to the store cupboard in search of a bowl. Potter was still grinning to himself when Draco returned, although he at least managed to stay quiet as Draco went about filling the shallow bowl with potion and carefully placing the skin in it to soak.
Pansy sighed. They both knew the food was not the issue, but at that moment, Blaise leaned across the table to ask her something, saving Draco from further scrutiny. Uninterested in whatever banal topic his friends had launched into discussing, Draco let his gaze wander.
He could see the tangle of black hair, tinged red and gold in the light of the fire, partially obscured by a stack of books on the table beside him.
The emerald canopy above Draco’s bed was more vibrant than ever. It seemed to stare back at him, disgustingly, painfully, mockingly, enticingly green. A green so intense it absorbed everything around it, until he was no longer sure if other colours existed. A deep, drowning sort of green.
They were sitting cross-legged on the floor of the potions room with the cauldron set up between them, which was Potter’s idea of taking it easy. Draco had never expected him to take Pansy’s directive so seriously, but Potter had been adamant. The suggestion had seemed silly, at first—how was sitting on the floor really that different from sitting at the table? But Potter had argued that when they worked at the table, Draco never actually sat still; he always ended up on his feet after a few minutes, pacing up and down the room every time he got frustrated, which was often.
“I changed my mind,” Potter repeated, cutting him off midsentence. Draco waited for him to illuminate further, but somehow it seemed that Potter thought this response was sufficient, despite the fact that it answered exactly zero of Draco’s questions.
After much deliberation – Draco quipping in unhelpfully to suggest he just buy some Cockroach Clusters and be done with it – Potter finally decided on a large bar of chocolate. Draco hung back while Potter went to buy it, staring idly at a display of Acid Pops while he waited.
That was the question, wasn’t it? What did he want? To just pretend nothing had ever happened, to act as if nothing had changed? It was the easier choice, certainly. Enmity was something Draco understood, the texture of it well-worn and familiar. Anger and hate, those were things he knew. Leaving that behind was like shedding his skin. He feared that without it, he would be too raw, and more than that, that he would be unrecognizable. But then again, maybe the person he recognized was no longer the person he wanted to be.
“You don’t remember?” Pansy asked, eyebrows furrowing as she leaned forward to take his hand once more. His fingers still felt numb. “You were hexed, in the Great Hall. Remember?”
“Well,” Draco mused, leaning over to examine the golden taps nearest him. “Not necessarily, I suppose. If it really were just plain soap bubbles, probably not, because that’s still a neutral base. But from what I recall, most of these taps are actually charmed in some way or another, or have some sort of bath potion mixed in, and anything magical like that could mess ours up.” He traced his finger along the curved neck of one of the taps, which was decorated with a single purple jewel. It was hard to tell which ones might be enchanted, since they didn’t exactly come with clear markings. “You would think someone would have bothered to label these things better. How did you even know that one was just plain water?”
“I have a very good feeling about this,” Slughorn went on, too wrapped up in his own excitement to pay any real mind to what his students had said. He seemed to be talking almost to himself now, a faraway gleam in his eye. "Obviously, there’s no way to be certain, but with your combined talent, and coming from the Chosen One no less… yes, I think the odds are very good.”
“If you say so.” He leaned over the potion, expecting to see some effect from the Wormwood Essence, but so far, it looked as if nothing had changed. He frowned and reached for his wand. He had read once that, in rare cases, plant essences had the potential to raise the boiling point of a potion; perhaps that was the problem.
Nights like this were almost a routine. The fragmented nightmares, jolting him awake; the long moments of disorientation and fear; the splash of water on his face and neck to rinse the clammy feeling of sweat from his skin; the soft light from his wand as he stayed up the rest of the night reading, choosing a day of exhaustion over the terrifying prospect of having to close his eyes again.
, Potter. Using those kinds of curses would get us expelled before we could so much as wave our wands. But by all means,” he made an open-handed gesture, “if you know of some dark spell that’s safe to cast in a school building full of children and won’t get us thrown in Azkaban, I’m all ears.” When Potter didn’t immediately answer, Draco went on, “Or are you suggesting that you’ve secretly been keeping a very well-trained class XXXXX creature as a pet?”
Granted, Draco hadn’t had much of an appetite for many months now, but at least tonight he could claim an easier excuse.
As always, thank you for all of your comments ♡ I love hearing what people think of the story so far!
It was all new to Draco, equal parts thrilling and nerve-wracking. He was inexperienced, to say the least; his only previous experience with another man had been nearly two years ago, and it had been nothing like this. That encounter had been clumsy and desperate, the awkward experiment of two teenagers.
He was supposed to meet with Potter again later that afternoon to work on their potion, which was part of the reason why he hadn't been able to sleep. It wasn’t strictly Potter’s fault, Draco knew, although he wished he could blame it on the Gryffindor. He just couldn’t explain what it was that had him tossing and turning even more than usual at night, or why he felt like someone had hexed him every time Potter looked his way. Maybe Potter
Draco extracted himself from her too-tight grip, not bothering to answer what he could only assume was a rhetorical question. How in Merlin’s name was he supposed to know what Potter wanted?
“Get away from me, Potter!” He struck out with his right arm this time, shoving the other boy roughly back. “Don’t touch me!”
The first time that Draco had looked in a mirror after the battle at Hogwarts had been the day of his trial. He’d returned to the family manor that same night upon his conditional release, exchanging Azkaban for three months of house arrest. Though he had stood in the same bathroom that he’d used since childhood, everything had felt alien to him, from the white marble floors to the serpentine taps of the sink to the gaunt white face reflected in the mirror. Draco remembered looking at that skeletal stranger with the dirty, overgrown hair and the flat grey eyes and wondering how much farther he could whittle himself down before the skin cracked and revealed that he had been hollow all along.
Potter answered slowly, as if searching for the right words. “My scars… they’re sort of like my history. They’re not exactly great memories, but…” Almost unconsciously, he reached up to touch a spot on his chest as he spoke. Draco wondered what kind of scar must be hidden there, just below the collar of his shirt. Knowing Potter, it was probably from some great heroic feat. “Getting rid of them feels almost like forgetting. And I don’t want to forget. I don’t want to erase the past, not after everything that’s happened.”
puts out a call for papers around this time every year for their Innovations in Potion-Making issue, and they always include an amateur section. It’s a competition of sorts, to encourage young potioneers.”
Even if their potion was selected, would it really have anything to do with his own merit? If he thought about it rationally, he supposed that it wouldn’t be the worst thing. Regardless of the politics behind it, the fact that he was accepted for publication in
“It is working, the potion is just absorbing too quickly.” He traced his finger along the ridge of scar tissue at the centre of the synthetic skin, drawing Potter’s attention to the jagged edges. “See here? The edges are beginning to smooth—that means it’s working. We just have to reapply it.”
He was satisfied to see that he had managed to wipe the smirk from Potter’s lips. “I’m the pathetic one?” Potter bit back, eyes flashing. “Tell me, Malfoy, do you eavesdrop on everyone, or is it just me that you get off spying on?
“Professor Snape always insisted you were the best in your year, and I have to say I quite agree. I think you have what it takes to win this competition.” In that moment, the praise felt like a knife to Draco’s gut. “But, unfortunately, the judging isn’t blind. I thought that, perhaps, with Harry…”
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that. Just there, just then, Draco didn’t want to think about anything else. All that mattered was the two of them, together, and the faint sound of the rain.
“I am also happy to welcome back those students who have returned for an eighth year in order to complete their N.E.W.T.s.”
A simple charm, but effective enough. Draco didn’t look long enough to see what other scars Potter might want to protect further down his body, although he could hear Potter murmuring the spell over a few different spots.
They stood there like two people stupefied, caught in mutual shock and wordless understanding. Draco didn’t have to ask what Potter was doing there; on some level, he knew. But the silence was too much, and after seconds that seemed to last years, he finally dared to break it.
Potter set aside the stirring rod he’d used to sample the potion, shrugging. “I had some help from Dumbledore’s phoenix, Fawkes. It’s kind of a long story.”
Draco shifted slightly away from Potter’s intent gaze, angling his shoulder so that he wouldn’t feel quite so exposed as he undid first one button, then two, his actions uncharacteristically clumsy. It wasn’t until he reached the last button that he chanced a glance at Potter, who was watching him with an odd expression on his face.
The flashes of memory were more difficult to interpret now, fragments without context, some more recognizable than others: an untidy house in the countryside, full of laughter and the sounds of cooking; the inside of a tent in the middle of a dark forest, the atmosphere tense; the astronomy tower at night, and Dumbledore falling; scarlet eyes in a monstrous face, stepping towards him across a graveyard, the looming inevitability of torture and death; the chaos of a battle, masked Death Eaters on all sides; a quiet muggle neighbourhood and a fat boy with an unpleasant face, no more than ten years old, pushing him to the ground; a heavy hand shoving him into a tiny room hidden under a staircase, the man’s moustache quivering and his face red as he screamed—
Eventually, they ended up at Honeydukes, toffee-scented warmth enveloping them as they escaped the cold wind outside. Rather than looking at the sweets, Draco chose to watch Potter browse, unexpectedly endeared by the simple, innocent joy in the Gryffindor’s eyes as he gazed at the colourful jars of Jelly Slugs and Fizzing Whizzbees, seeming much younger than Draco was used to.
If it weren’t for Pansy’s sharp elbow to his ribs just then, Draco would never have noticed that he was being asked a question. Everyone in the class had turned to look at him, watching silently as he scrambled to figure out what Flitwick had just said. Something about simultaneous Adhering and Colour Change Charms, maybe?
“Alright.” Draco looked away, pretending to write down another note on the potion just to have something to do, anything to keep himself from dwelling too long on the grief he had seen in Potter’s eyes. “We’ll make do, I suppose.”
– trying to focus on removing his own clothes so they could get back to the real matter at hand of testing the potion.
Trying his best to look supremely unperturbed, he cast a glance over at the knot of students standing a few yards away. He wasn’t looking for anyone in particular, of course; it was just a cursory look. It was only by chance that his gaze immediately landed on Potter, who he was infuriated to realize was already watching him.
Potter bit his lip, trailing his fingers over the rising water. For such a large tub, it was amazing how quickly it filled. Draco pulled the stopper out of the first vial, tipping it over the edge of the bath. The potion was so deep a grey that it was almost black, and the colour hardly seemed to dilute at all as it mixed with the water. By the time Draco had poured in the last bottle, the whole tub had darkened to a nearly opaque shade of charcoal.
“Draco’s been working with Potter for that potion competition,” Pansy answered for him, seeing his hesitation. “They’re friends now. Right Draco?” Draco gave a noncommittal gesture somewhere between a nod and a shrug, breathing a sigh of relief. He really didn’t know what he’d do without Pansy. Every time he began to overthink things and the anxiety started to set in, she knew exactly how to help.
“I don’t need your help,” Draco growled, jerking the pillow away from Potter’s grasp. Potter drew back, watching silently as Draco managed to shove himself up and prop a pillow behind his back. It took more effort than Draco cared to admit, and his side was throbbing by the time he finally settled into a half-reclined position.
“Just a bit.” Pansy glanced over his shoulder, then added, “You also might want to be fully dressed before you talk to Potter.”
For a second, Draco almost thought Potter was going to laugh. His lips quirked up at the corners, halfway to a grin before he seemed to catch himself and his expression quickly smoothed. Draco felt an inexplicable twinge of disappointment.
Three days was more than enough. Draco was done with avoiding and being avoided by Potter. It was silly and childish and by Merlin, he was not about to let all of the stress and confusion Potter had caused him be for nothing just because of a few awkward moments. And if Potter decided that he didn’t want to be associated with a Death Eater anymore now that it was all over the
Draco perched on the stool he’d pushed aside earlier, watching Potter rather than the cauldron. Thinking that Potter was good-looking, he’d already decided, did not mean anything. It wasn’t as if Draco was attracted to him; it was just an objective fact that he’d ignored for many years. He could set aside enough of their childhood animosity to admit that Potter was, by most measures, handsome. Frustrating and annoying and in need of a hairbrush, but handsome. And if Potter was going to spend so much time staring at Draco, as he had clearly resolved to do, it was only fair for Draco to look at him a little bit more often than usual as well. No big deal.
Just a note to say that I have updated the final chapter count! How I have it planned out right now, there will be two more chapters plus an epilogue.
would reflect positively on him. It would hopefully be enough to keep St. Mungo’s from discarding his application to the Healer Training Program outright, and that’s what really mattered. Still, the unpleasant feeling lingered.
Across all of their experiments, every single potion that they had tested without exception had produced some sort of undesirable side effect, ranging from bizarre to deadly. But this potion had done nothing. Ugly and foul-smelling though it was, aside from some superficial burns, Draco’s legs were perfectly fine.
That was a vast oversimplification of what had happened, in Draco’s opinion. Potter seemed to be omitting the part where he had all but forced his unnecessary potion-making assistance on Draco, although this only served to arouse Draco’s curiosity further. Potter had been maddeningly unforthcoming about his motivations when Draco had asked, but he had never imagined that there was something secret enough about it that Potter wouldn’t even tell his closest friends.
He attempted to grip Pansy’s hand, which was still wrapped around his own, but the petrified muscles in his side prevented him from doing anything more than twitching his fingers. Pansy smirked and pulled her hand away.
Potter shook his head. “Not really. I guess I was sort of turned off from it after the first time I came here.”
He started from the beginning, with the meeting with Slughorn that morning after Potions class. Pansy was quiet as he talked, only turning her head to look at him when he reached the end, hesitantly describing the surreal moment less than an hour ago in the Charms classroom when Potter had smiled and said he didn’t hate him.
“Good gods, no,” Draco answered. It was peculiar, but he could have sworn Potter looked relieved. “Why, are you interested? Looking to dabble with a Slytherin now that the Weasel girl has left you?”
The first press of Potter’s lips was soft, still hesitant despite the boldness of the gesture. He tasted sweet, somehow, almost like treacle, and without thinking, Draco felt himself leaning forward, seeking more.
“Malfoy…” Draco could feel the warmth of his uneven breath. Draco knew that he wanted to say something more, probably to try and drag them back towards a conversation that Draco wasn’t ready for. But if Potter said
“Well, it should,” Draco muttered as he slit open the wax seal and scanned his mother’s letter. He knew he probably should have written to her sooner to tell her about the potions competition, and about working with Potter, but he had hardly expected it to make the papers. And then, well…
By the time Draco’s tossing and turning had finally lulled into a fitful sleep, Blaise’s apathetic voice was telling him he had missed breakfast and was going to be late to class.
“You tested that potion on your arm a couple of weeks ago,” Draco reminded him, his eyebrows raised. “On that Basilisk scar. How was that any different?”
The confusion and uncertainty that had plagued him since their first kiss disappeared under Potter’s touch. Suddenly, it was all too simple to give in to the slide of their tongues and the firmness of Potter’s body beneath his hands. He wanted to map Potter’s shoulders, the planes of his chest, the muscles of his stomach. He wanted to kiss, to touch; he wanted more, wanted everything.
him. He quickly looked away, hoping in vain that Potter wouldn’t see the incriminating heat rising on his cheeks.
The furious hammering stopped as the door flew open. “Bloody hell, Pans, keep it down, will you?” Draco griped as his best friend shoved past him into his room. “I wasn’t ignoring you. Just knock like a normal person next time.”
Draco squinted. “Wasn’t that also the year that your potions skills underwent a rather miraculous transformation?”
Draco’s meticulous control wavered, all of the thoughts and emotions he had been trying to suppress flooding back into his mind. He had been so sure that he would be the one put on the defensive, and now Potter was… freely offering up his own thoughts? What was he after?
Draco froze. He knew immediately which day Potter was referring to. It was the first time that either of them had ever mentioned the trial; Draco had never dared to bring it up.
“This is it.” One of the bottles he was holding fell from his grasp as he took the Murtlap tentacles from Potter, rolling across the floor and out of sight. Draco paid it no attention. All he could do was stare in awe at the wriggling tentacles through the midnight tint of the bottle’s glass, mind reeling with the thought that this was it, the final missing piece for their potion, it
“You have a real talent for Potions, Mr. Malfoy,” Slughorn continued, looking at him with that same sad glimmer in his eyes.
The whole reason he had asked for Potter’s help in the first place had been to balance out the weight of his own name, but he had been so focused on the possibility of their entry being discounted even with Potter as his partner that he hadn’t stopped to consider the opposite, that their entry in the competition might be unduly favoured because of who Potter was.
“It’s not like that.” There was anger in Potter’s voice now. Or was it frustration? As Draco watched, Potter sidestepped past his friend, moving right in Draco’s direction. Judging from the set of his jaw, he wasn’t happy with the way the conversation was going. “We’re not kids anymore, Ron. Things have changed. And if I’m able to—”
, Draco reminded himself – but with that task now accomplished, Draco found he wasn’t keen to return to the castle just yet.
That stopped Draco in his tracks. “What do you mean, you changed your mind?” They were standing quite close, Draco couldn’t help noticing, with Potter’s hand resting just above his elbow. Even through his robes, Draco could feel the warmth of his grip.
“I’m not saying that you can’t be friends with Potter,” Draco insisted, although to be honest, he wasn’t thrilled at that prospect either. Merlin only knew the things Pansy would say to Potter about him. “I
This announcement was met with a chorus of triumphant shouts from the sixth years and a smattering of general applause across the room. McGonagall’s soft smile as she looked out at the students over her spectacles reminded Draco forcibly of Dumbledore, and he found he had to clench his hands together in his lap to keep them from shaking.
?” He might’ve laughed, in another circumstance. “You’re the one that cornered me into this ridiculous demonstration, this was
Draco’s breath caught in his throat as Potter reached towards him, his fingers hovering near Draco’s collarbone. Potter seemed to hesitate then, swallowing hard as he stared at his own hand extended between them.
He had nearly reached the top of the stairs when, with a sudden burst of speed, Potter cut him off, blocking him from reaching the Entrance Hall. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Seamus Finnigan’s voice, already twice as loud and twice as annoying as a normal person’s, silenced all conversation as he raised it to address Draco. A hush fell over the eighth years who stood grouped around the classroom door, awaiting the arrival of Professor Flitwick.
Pansy's eyes were shrewd as she continued without answering his question, “People are saying he wasn’t interested in her anymore. That maybe he’s, you know…”
adults, and if I hear that you are behaving otherwise, the consequences will not be so lenient.” On that note, McGonagall bade them all a goodnight.
“Yeah, from Ginny.” Potter turned to face the nondescript door to his left, addressing it as he said, “
“He seemed worried that I might upset your delicate sensibilities with my harassment,” Draco drawled, all too happy to fall back into their familiar rapport of insults and gibes. “I, however, had no such concerns.”
“I, um.” Draco cleared his throat, subtly attempting to bunch the blankets up further around his waist. He would rather die right then and there than have Potter become aware of his current predicament. “I wanted to tell you to stop being such a
Yes, he thought as he let the cascade of water soothe the tension in his shoulders, it was Potter’s fault, and nothing else. He needed to relax, and to forget this paranoia. A good wank, he figured, was the best way to achieve that. It was only because Potter was to blame for so much of Draco’s confusion and stress that day that he thought of him while he did it, unable to avoid those damned green eyes even in his fantasies.
“I’ll take a look at this later,” he patted the recipe they had given him along with the sample of the potion, which Draco had spent the previous night writing out in precise, painstaking detail. “I’ll see if there are any tweaks we can make, just to put the finishing touches on it. But I’m sure there won’t be much to change.” He gazed fondly between them, absently patting at the potion recipe again, as if it were a prized pet. “I had faith in you two. Brilliant, the both of you. I knew you could do it.”
For a long moment, Potter just stared at him. The intensity of his gaze was such that Draco thought he might as well be standing there naked for how exposed he felt. “Why does this matter so much to you? This competition?”
Purely by chance, his Colour Change Charm had turned the fabric a vibrant shade of green. Someone towards the front of the classroom snickered.
Most days, he and Pansy did their homework together, finding a secluded table in the back of the library and claiming it as their own for a few hours. Somewhere out of the way, somewhere quiet. It was what they had always done, ever since their very first year. So it was highly unusual when Pansy paused halfway across the eight-year common room one night while on their way to the library, her eyes fixed on a group of students sitting near the fireplace.
Potter shrugged. “I didn’t do anything, really. They asked if it was mine, I said no. They asked what I planned to do with it, and I said that I just wanted to return it to its owner.”
Pansy was looking at Potter directly now, the façade of indifference dropped. Her eyes were narrowed, assessing. “And this newfound interest of yours,” she said, holding Potter’s gaze, “Is it just a temporary pastime? Or do you think it’s going to last?”
Potter lunged forward, stretching to try and grab the stirring rod that Draco had hidden behind his back. As he moved, his knee collided with the side of the cauldron, and Draco watched as if in slow motion as it wobbled and then tipped over, spilling the potion across his legs. He yelped and scrambled backwards, trying to avoid the worst of it, but it was too late: the potion was everywhere, scalding his skin as it soaked through his socks and trousers.
The rain continued through the night. It was still drumming against the windows when Draco awoke with his heart racing, not knowing where he was. The room was dark, familiar, ringing with screams. The sound was like a knife to his lungs, piercing them and stealing his oxygen. His stomach twisted, a feeling that went beyond nausea, a kind of sickness deep in his bones. The screams were growing louder and louder and he couldn’t breathe, everything around him like broken glass, high-pitched and jagged.
He leaned over the cauldron and jabbed angrily at the ruined potion, which was now the colour of charcoal and smelled like spoilt milk. Potter had relinquished the stirring rod without question, but he had not otherwise moved; his expression was distant and unreadable.
“I’m sure you are all wondering where you will be staying,” she began. “Since an eighth year class is unprecedented, and you are all now adults, we have decided to assign you your own common room.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. Either Potter’s powers of deduction were much better than Draco gave him credit for, or he had inside knowledge of Draco’s conditions for returning to Hogwarts. It was not at all beyond the realm of possibility to think that either McGonagall or the Board of Governors had asked for Potter’s opinion on letting Draco return to the school, although if that were true, it would be just another line on the list of debts he owed to the green-eyed git.
Draco was out of bed in seconds, throwing on his clothes with uncharacteristic haste. Ignoring whatever question Blaise was in the middle of asking him, he snatched up his book bag and sprinted out the door, very nearly tripping when he reached the stairs. They had double Potions first period and Draco was accustomed to being much closer to the dungeons; he had forgotten that their new common room was on the third floor.
It took three days before the Mandrake draught was ready, although Draco would swear it was much longer. Partial petrification, as it turned out, might as well have been his own personal form of torture. With the upper left side of his torso turned to stone, accomplishing almost anything beyond lying quietly in his bed proved to be either painful, degrading, or both at once, given the level of assistance he required to even so much as use the bathroom. After one attempt to get out of bed on his own resulted in a rather nasty fall, Madam Pomfrey kept such a close eye on him that Draco soon began to feel more like a prisoner than a patient.
“Dark creature injuries, huh?” Potter leaned over the cauldron. The potion was no longer boiling, but it was still warm enough that tendrils of steam curled from the surface. Potter reached for the set of silver brewing tools that Draco had laid out earlier, selecting a shorter stirring rod that ended in a shallow spoon. “May I?” He gestured towards the potion.
Draco responded, “Yes, of course, sir” at the exact same moment that Potter replied with a hesitant, “Er, no.”
“Neither of you took notes in class?” Granger demanded, glaring between the two of them. Weasley and Potter both shook their heads, at least having the decency to look sheepish about it.
For Draco, the prospect of having his research included in one of the most prestigious academic publications in the wizarding world, of potentially having a potion of his own invention seen and evaluated and maybe even
Caught by surprise, Potter took the vial with clumsy fingers, only barely managing not to spill it, but he hesitated only a few seconds before following Draco’s directions. As he added the potion to the cauldron and gave it a slow swirl, Draco could’ve sworn he saw him smile.
The potion had become more viscous with the addition of the Murtlap tentacles, although it was still too liquid to be able to easily apply as a topical solution without making a mess. Later, once they managed to get the potion to work properly, they could worry about making it into a more usable consistency, like an ointment. For now, Draco just used his wand to transfer a small amount of the potion to his skin, not minding that some of it ended up dripping down his chest.
“So…” Potter’s voice caught up to Draco on the stairs. Resigned, Draco slowed his pace, but didn’t stop. “What ideas do you have, for the potion?”
“I needed a change. Luckily, I look good in everything. It’s a shame you two will never know what that’s like.”
your tie purple?” Blaise finally asked once Slughorn had settled behind his desk, leaving the class to follow the complex set of instructions written on the blackboard. “And more importantly, why is our entire bloody dormitory purple?”
“I will take that into consideration,” McGonagall said after a long moment, a curious look in her eye. “But hexing other students is never allowed. She will at the very least receive several weeks of detention with her Head of House.”
“I didn’t, really. I just...” Potter hesitated. “I just knew I wasn’t going to let them take you back to Azkaban. You never should have been there.”
The variables were seemingly infinite. Their time, however, was not. Their submission was due by the first of December, allowing sufficient time for the entries to be reviewed before the finalists were selected for publication in
There, across from the sinks, sat a figure, hunched with his back against the wall and arms wrapped tightly around his knees. The dark, messy hair was unmistakably Potter’s, and yet Draco could hardly believe that was who he was seeing. The man in the reflection – curled into himself like he wanted nothing more than to disappear – looked almost like a child.
He scowled and turned away, doing his best to pay attention as Slughorn described the dreadfully tricky process of brewing the Wolfsbane Potion.
Draco. Thank Merlin, really, that Madam Pomfrey had interrupted them, or else who knew what regrettable things might have happened? He was foolish to have misjudged Potter’s intentions, and even more foolish to have nearly given in to the absurd urge to lean in and kiss him.
Pansy made a vague noise of response, not looking up from the copy of Witch Weekly she was idly perusing as she lounged on the floor.
The black-haired boy still had that inquisitive look on his face, like he wanted to ask yet another unnecessary and invasive question. Before he could, Draco pressed, “So will you help me out or not?”
“Seamus.” Potter’s voice was low but firm. Draco hadn’t even noticed his arrival until the dark-haired boy stepped in front of Finnigan, placing a restraining hand on his fellow Gryffindor’s shoulder. “Leave it.”
Draco threw himself down beside Blaise in a huff. Though he tried not to, he couldn’t help stealing a quick glance in Potter’s direction. The Gryffindor trio had their heads together at a table on the opposite side of the room, whispering and gesturing in a way that Draco was sure meant they were talking about him.
“You don’t have to be here,” Draco had said as he stirred the half-finished potion in the cauldron. “You can go back to drinking with your friends.”
Pansy rolled her eyes as Madam Pomfrey disappeared back into her office. “That woman always assumes the worst of everyone. What does she think, we’re going to refuse to let you sleep or something?
Instead, he shook his head at Pansy, muttering something dismissive to Goyle about wanting to rest before he turned his back on the room, heading down the hallway McGonagall had indicated earlier. It split off into two separate passageways, one labelled for men and another for women. Further along the corridor, Draco found the door draped in Slytherin green and quickly slammed it shut behind him, silencing the sounds of laughter and conversation that carried from the common room.
Potter’s expression was so determined and so earnest that Draco almost gave in. If there was one thing he loved, it was talking about potions, especially his own experimentations, and on some level he thought it might actually be of use to have Potter’s help, if only to have someone to listen and bounce his ideas off of. But his suspicion ran too deep, and Potter’s responses were far too lacking for Draco to even begin to believe he had spontaneously developed a passion for the subject.
Potter was leaning heavily against the wall, eyes closed and cheeks flushed. As the Gryffindor tried to catch his breath, Draco found himself fixated on the details he knew he would not soon forget: the faint sheen of sweat on Potter’s neck; the curve of his bottom lip, reddened from the too-hard bite of teeth; the artful tangle of his hair, messy even on the best of days, made somehow much more beautiful by the knowledge that it was Draco’s hands that had tousled it. The images engraved themselves in his mind, etching into places both seen and unseen, promising to linger equally in his waking thoughts and his dreams.
“No,” he said, turning back to Pansy in sudden understanding. “No, whatever you’re thinking right now, just stop. We are not going over there, not a chance.”
“Well enough,” Draco answered, which was more or less true—the pain in his side was certainly not the worst he had endured. As if to verify his response, McGonagall glanced at Madam Pomfrey, who gave a small, terse nod.
Luckily, Draco didn’t have to worry about following through on any half-baked threats; this time, it was obvious to both of them that the potion was working. After ten minutes of soaking in the solution, the scar on their test skin had smoothed into a narrow line, and after twenty minutes, it had disappeared altogether.
Draco nodded, somewhat chagrined, and shoved the green gloves out of sight. Though he kept his eyes averted, he imagined he could feel Potter watching him even after most of the class had turned to focus on their own piles of fabric.
“Granger and Weasley aren’t so bad.” Pansy shrugged. “The past is the past, right? Why shouldn’t we be friends with them?”
He had not been able to stop thinking about the kiss for even a single minute since it happened. A full 22 hours and 43 minutes had passed and yet he could not so much as brush his teeth without remembering the way Potter had tasted on his tongue. The steam of the bath seemed to cling to him, the warmth like a fever. He could see the canopy above him; he knew that he was in his room, sprawled out on his bed, nowhere near the fifth floor bathroom, and yet he could clearly feel the bare skin of Potter’s hips pressed against the inside of his legs. It was as if his nerves were frozen in time, unwilling to let go of the sensation.
He wanted to believe that the Draco Malfoy the other students glared at, the one they hated, was a different person; that the Draco Malfoy that liked Potter was someone new, someone better. He wanted to believe it so badly, but most days, the past felt far too close, and much too painful.
my girlfriend.” He shuddered at the thought. They had shared a brief flirtation when they were younger, sure, but that had mostly been a product of convenience and their family’s expectations rather than out of any real romantic interest. Nowadays, Draco thought of Pansy more like a sister.
Whoever had been charged with overseeing the school’s reconstruction had done a good job. Draco’s last memory of Hogwarts was of crashing stones and spilled blood, copious amounts of smoke engulfing the earsplitting screams and equally deafening silences. But when he had stepped into the Entrance Hall earlier that evening, it was almost as if nothing had changed. Pansy had held his hand, her shrieking giggle echoing off the same familiar walls as Blaise and Goyle argued about Quidditch, and for a few blissful moments, Draco had dared to think that maybe it really could be just another year at Hogwarts.
Draco sighed. It didn’t seem like there was any chance of avoiding this conversation now that Pansy had so kindly abandoned him. He tried to push himself up into a sitting position, hoping that might help him regain some sense of dignity, but with only one functional arm and the heavy weight of his petrified ribcage, it proved to be quite a challenge.
“Are you sure you don’t want anything?” Potter asked him when he returned, tucking his purchase into his coat pocket.
– but just as they had before, the words stuck in his throat. And maybe, in the end, it was better to just show him anyway.
He didn’t know if Weasley had been the one to break it off or not, but judging by Potter’s face, he seemed to have struck a nerve. The Gryffindor’s cheeks reddened but, surprisingly, he didn’t look away, and the boldness in his gaze struck Draco with nearly as much force as his response.
Draco struggled to speak. Potter wasn’t wrong, exactly—after all, those were the same excuses that Draco had used time and again to assuage his own guilt. He had never regretted trying to protect his family, and he never would, but he also knew that those justifications were not enough to absolve him for his actions. Underage or not, he’d known full well what it meant when he took the Mark; when he’d sent that necklace and poisoned that mead and raised his wand at Dumbledore. He’d tortured people, no matter how unwillingly. He’d nearly tortured Potter, even. But by the time he opened his mouth to point all of that out, Potter had already started talking again.
“I do say so.” She pressed a quick kiss to his temple before flouncing off the bed to retrieve her magazine. “But just so you know, this doesn’t get you out of marrying me. You already promised. I don’t care how much you like cock—” Pansy continued on even as Draco spluttered “—if my mum brings up Marcus Flint as a prospective husband again, I swear, you and I are eloping.”
Though shorter than Draco when they were on equal footing, Potter seemed to tower now as he stood over the bed. His hands had come to rest against the sheets only centimetres from where Draco’s arm lay, and there was something dangerous in his gaze that sent a thrill down Draco’s spine.
Potter chewed his lip, not meeting Draco’s gaze. “Honestly, I didn’t really think about it before. But now that I have…” He took a deep breath. “If our potion works, I don’t want to use it on myself. I don’t want to get rid of any of my scars.”
Potter’s eyes followed the movement of his wand as he coaxed the flames beneath the cauldron higher.
“Or… I guess not.” Blaise sounded confused. Draco watched through lowered lashes as Potter wavered near the end of the Ravenclaw table, too distant for Draco to read his expression, then made an awkward turn to leave the hall instead. Once he was out of sight, Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
He knew if he looked at Potter then, it would be too obvious how much he really meant it. If they were alone, maybe he would have let their eyes meet, would have allowed Potter to see the truth there, the vulnerability. But for now, he just watched Potter out of the corner of his eye, catching only a flash of the small, pleased smile that flickered across his lips.
“Pansy…” he warned, trying to convey with his eyes what he couldn’t say out loud. What did she think she was playing at? Potter sat up in his chair, watching with interest as Pansy patted Draco’s hand and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, pointedly ignoring his threatening glower.
Goyle and Draco both laughed but Pansy seemed unamused. “I’m glad this is all such a great joke to you guys,” she snapped, snatching the photo back from Goyle and crumpling it in her fist. “It’s not like it’s my life or anything.”
Draco was so absorbed in his thoughts that he didn’t even stop to think about how much time had passed until his back began to hurt from how long he had been crouched down to inspect the lower shelves. He straightened up with a slight groan, rolling his shoulders to relieve some of the stiffness. He’d amassed a collection of about four different bottles of ingredients he wanted to test, although any true stroke of genius had sadly evaded him.
Draco sat up, tearing his eyes away from the dreadful green of the canopy to stare instead at his best friend’s profile as she continued to flip through the pages of the magazine. “What does that mean?”
The Gryffindor dried his wrist off using the edge of his shirt, apparently satisfied that the potion wasn’t imminently dangerous. “I just spent a lot of time with my godson this summer, is all.”
A weight that Draco had not even realized he was carrying seemed to lift. He had already resolved that his very fleeting desire to lean in and kiss Potter had been a moment of pure insanity brought on by the trauma of the attack and the effects of too much pain potion. But what was worse, Draco felt almost certain that Potter had never intended to kiss him in the first place, and somehow in his addled state of mind he had misconstrued a completely innocent situation. Which meant it was quite possible that Potter now thought—mistakenly, of course—that Draco
“What makes you so sure of that?” Draco demanded, too loud. A group of students walking by gave them a curious look, but when they saw Draco’s glare, they quickly hurried off.
“I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our sixth years in particular for their flexibility and determination. I know you all studied very hard over the summer in order to take your O.W.L. exams before the beginning of term, and I was very pleased with all of your results.”
Draco glanced down at where their hands were caught between their bodies, as if that might clarify the issue, but it proved unhelpful. The sight of Potter pressed against him was distractingly arousing, but not at all enlightening. When he looked up again, Potter was watching him.
Realizing that Draco hadn’t pushed him away, Potter became more assured, lips pressing against Draco more firmly. His free hand came up to cradle the back of Draco’s neck, the gentle touch enough to make Draco shiver, even despite the heat. As he returned the kiss with more fervor, Draco’s mind grew curiously blank, filled with nothing except the overwhelming taste of all the things he had for too long pretended he didn’t crave.
Pansy gave a dramatic sniff. “No, all she can do is disinherit me.” To their mutual horror, Pansy’s lip began to quiver, looking for all the world like she was on the brink of tears as she stared morosely into her pumpkin juice.
The quiet exertion of flying had done him some good. By the time he came to sit near the edge of the Black Lake, arms wrapped around his knees as he watched the sky over the water fade into a pale, cloudless blue, his thoughts were no longer racing, the breath in his lungs no longer constricted by the weight of anxiety.
The next day, when Potter refused to meet his eyes, Draco focused on his hands. Did Potter dream about the fire too? Or was it something else, something much worse, that left him huddled cold and alone on the bathroom floor?
was gay, and that’s why she had told him. Which would be a completely absurd and baseless assumption, of course, except…
Draco felt an instant surge of regret. Potter was doing him a favour, after all; it would be wrong to leave it on such a sour note.
Draco slung his bookbag over his shoulder and grabbed the three volumes he hadn’t managed to fit in with the others, thrusting them into Pansy’s surprised hands.
Draco had to admit, if it weren’t for the frizzy mane of hair, he could almost have imagined that it was Pansy speaking, reminding him for the thousandth time that he should eat something.
In the past, Draco supposed that he would have felt a sense of vindication knowing that he had been right all along to suspect Potter’s sixth year potions performance. But now, the whole thing seemed trivial. “I knew you couldn’t have gotten better marks than me without cheating.” Draco shook his head.
The dread in his stomach turned to ice. Somehow, he managed to keep his hands steady as he folded the paper and carefully set it aside. His friends were quiet, waiting to see what he would say, but Draco wasn’t looking at them. His eyes searched across the hall for the one person whose reaction mattered to him at that moment, and this time, he found Potter already looking back.
This time, Potter looked up as Draco sat down beside him, the tile floor cold under their bare feet. He said nothing when Draco put his arm around him, silently moving closer to lean his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Which dream was it this time?” Granger’s voice was gentle, but Draco wanted to hex her; he certainly would have if any of his friends dared ask him that question. Didn’t she know it was better to never bring it up, to never even think about the nightmares beyond those few minutes when you first woke up and couldn’t remember what was real and what was not?
The kiss was cold and sweet with rainwater. Draco wrapped his arms around Potter, holding tight against him as the thunder rumbled overhead. It wasn’t as passionate as their last kiss, far less fire in the way that Potter nipped at his lip and chased his tongue, but Draco liked it all the more for it. It was an unhurried kiss, light and breathless, soft at its edges.
Potter seemed to understand the unspoken meaning behind his words. He hesitated slightly, then said, “Those memories, at the manor…”
He shook away the thoughts, not wanting to let them sour his mood. “Come on, we should probably head back before it starts to rain.”
He made a vague gesture, but Draco didn’t need to hear the end of that sentence. He had thought that Slughorn had only picked Potter because of his own reverential affection for the precious Boy Who Lived. Now, Draco realized Slughorn had hoped that with Harry Potter’s name attached, it might just be enough to cancel out the horrible weight of his own.
He could hear Pansy saying his name, a soft question tinged with that familiar note of concern. He ignored her, ignored the curious stares of all of his classmates, barely pausing to snatch up his bookbag before he left the room.
“Oi! I was using that!” he insisted, although it was possible that he and Pansy had different ideas of what “using” meant. True, he hadn’t taken a single bite of the pie on his plate, but he
After passing through a short corridor, they found themselves in a spacious, warmly lit room furnished with an assortment of armchairs and two very large, plush sofas. The walls were lined with bookshelves, broken up only by a massive crackling fireplace. It was much cosier than the Slytherin common room, Draco thought, but they had obviously made an effort to not make it seem partial to any one house. The colours were mostly neutral, aside from a jumble of bright blue, green, red, and yellow pillows piled on the sofa and a large flag emblazoned with the Hogwarts crest that hung over the mantel.
“I’m supposed to be taking it easy, remember?” Draco smirked, stepping past her before she could protest any further. He could hear Pansy grumbling under her breath as he headed towards the door, but when he realized that she wasn’t following him, he turned back.
Vaguely panicked, still all too conscious of their nudity, Draco tried to flee from his unexpected approach, but his back was already pressed against the smooth tiles of the sunken pool. The best he could do was sidestep towards the corner, where his retreat was quickly hindered by a narrow ledge at about hip height under the water, a sort of seat that ran the length of one side of the tub.
The ringing of the bell marking the end of the class period was a unique kind of cruelty. Immediately, both of them stilled, listening over their hushed breathing for the tell-tale sound of footsteps in the hallway. Although he knew it was in vain, Draco wished that the sound would never come, for he knew that then the spell would be broken, and he wanted more than anything to hold on to it for just a few minutes longer.
He glanced around the room as Potter began filling the tub with water. The Prefects’ Bathroom had been the obvious choice—the only choice, really—since the eighth year bathrooms only had showers, not tubs. They could have conjured one, he supposed, but then they would’ve run the risk of someone walking in on them, and even if all they were doing was a simple potions experiment, it was for the best that people didn’t see him and Potter together like that; neither of them needed more rumours.
Draco spared a glance at the picture of an unsmiling, square-jawed young man wearing heavy bloodred robes. “He’s certainly not the worst-looking one she’s found.”
Concentrating back on his notes, Draco was horrified to find that he had drawn a rather familiar-looking lightning bolt in the bottom corner of his parchment. He hastily scribbled it out, hoping to Merlin that Potter hadn’t seen, silently chastising himself for his foolishness. It was high time he started focusing on what really mattered, which was the potion. It wouldn’t do to keep getting distracted like this, not when the stakes were so high for him.
“I was hoping to give a brief demonstration, just so you all can see what it’s like in practice, although only if someone is willing to volunteer.” Draco tried to look as if he were paying attention, despite not having heard anything the professor had said. “Is there anyone interested? Anyone, by chance, who might have some experience in this area?”
As she smothered him with a hug, Draco felt a throb of pain through his ribcage, but he ignored it, allowing her a moment to fuss.
“Malfoy…” Draco looked up as Potter stepped closer, his breath hitching as he felt his knees brush against the bare skin of Potter’s legs underwater. A flash of heat coursed through him, his mind suddenly racing at the thought of what other exposed parts he might brush against.
Draco’s scowl returned. “Hardly. I’m just tired of your pathetic attempts to pretend you don’t see me every time we pass in the hallway, as if catching you snivelling in a bathroom wasn’t pitiful enough.”
“I see.” He waited, knowing there must be something else Potter wanted to say, but Potter hesitated.
He was ready to settle in for a long night of research to try and find a method of stabilizing the potion, or perhaps a replacement for the Bubotuber pus, when the sound of a familiar voice drew his attention.
“Please, with your obsessive need to save everyone you see, what else would you do?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Besides, it was all over the papers this summer that Kingsley Shacklebolt offered you a position in the training program. Merlin knows why you even came back here at all.”
“Yes.” Draco looked away from the sugary display, not even slightly tempted by it. “I don’t like sweets much.”
Though he said none of this out loud, the Gryffindor boy was staring at him like he’d never quite seen him before. After a prolonged silence, Draco couldn’t take it anymore. “So what do you think?” As much as he had claimed he didn’t need or care about Potter’s opinion, the lack of response was making him nervous.
“This is ridiculous,” Draco muttered, finally daring to look at Potter now that they were both mostly hidden beneath the potion-darkened water.
“Well we got here on time, didn’t we?” Draco insisted, hoping the relief he felt wasn’t visible on his face.
“No, I really don’t.” Draco cursed silently to himself. With the way the Weasel was leaning forward, it was almost impossible now to see Potter’s expression. “I think he’s just… trying to move on. Like we all are.”
“You know…” Draco willed him to stop, knowing that it could lead nowhere good, but his silent plea went unanswered as Potter continued, “You could probably come meet him sometime. I think Andromeda would like that.”
The only good thing about being watched was that it made it easier for Draco to justify how much he watched Potter in return. He would steal glances in class and across the Great Hall, and in those moments when Potter was busy stirring and Draco was ostensibly taking notes, he would catalogue the curls of hair around Potter’s ears, the way he sometimes bit his lip as he worked, and the dark bruise of the circles under his eyes that never seemed to fade.
In truth, Draco didn’t know; that bit of domestic knowledge was entirely new to him, having never spent much time around young children if he could avoid it. He was generally of the opinion that babies were much too loud and dirty and needy to be anything more than a nuisance. He had never taken Potter for the kind of person who loved babies, either, but he wasn’t certain why the revelation surprised him so much. It wasn’t as if he kept a catalogue of all of Potter’s interests or anything.
Draco spun around, the books slipping from his arms and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Any hope he might have had that Pansy was joking quickly evaporated. There, indeed, was Potter, standing near the doors of the Hospital Wing and watching them both with mild amusement. As Draco turned, Potter’s eyes flickered down, lingering on the pale skin of Draco’s exposed collarbones.
There was hardly a foot of unused space in the shop, which made it somewhat difficult to navigate. Though everything was meticulously labelled, the narrow cursive lettering and dim light made deciphering many of the labels a challenge. The air was also much closer and warmer than outside, adding to the cramped, claustrophobic feeling of the place.
Potter hummed in understanding. The shops and cottages at the edge of the village had come into view, just a bit further down the road.
, he thought, ignoring his friends’ looks of confusion as he strode down the length of the Slytherin table.
And the longer they stayed there, warmed by the glow of the fire as the night sky slowly darkened, the less Draco had to pretend.
“Oh, er…” Draco had nearly forgotten what they had been talking about in the first place. At Potter’s question, he shifted in his seat, straightening up and away from the table where he had been leaning like Potter was now. “Yes. I’ve been working on it myself already, so I’ve got some ideas to go off of, and I figure it fits the theme, you know, ‘recovery and reconstruction,’” he quoted. “The war left a lot of scars that can’t be healed, at least not yet. I think it could help a lot of people to move forward. It might not be possible, but it’s worth trying.”
After two months of work filled with late nights and countless experiments, they had finally succeeded.
“Billywig.” Hardly a second passed after McGonagall spoke before the bust nodded its head once and the door swung inwards.
“Er…” Potter ran a distracted hand through his already untidy hair, making it stand on end. “I’m not sure, Professor. I don’t really know if I want to take on something like that. I’m just trying to get through my N.E.W.T.s.”
“What exactly do you think our alternative is?” he asked slowly, as if he were speaking to a child. “We’re trying to fix scars from
“That’s not— we’re not—” Draco floundered. He wasn’t sure how to answer without denying it outright. Pansy wasn’t wrong, exactly, and she’d never believe such a blatant lie. Better to keep it simple and just stick to the main point. “We’re not going to sit with them. You don’t even like them, especially not Granger and Weasley.”
“I doubt you’re going to be very helpful to me drunk.” Potter had pouted at that, childish in his inebriation, and Draco had hidden his smile, feeling fond.
Potter’s hair had already been mussed by the wind. Or perhaps that’s just how it had been since he first woke up, it was impossible to tell. Draco shoved his hands deeper into his pockets, suppressing the urge to do something stupid, like run his fingers through it.
“Well…” Weasley and Potter shared a helpless look. “We were sort of counting on being able to borrow yours,” Weasley admitted, scratching the back of his neck. It was hard not to laugh at the pathetically guilty look on Potter’s face, but Draco didn’t think Granger would find the situation very funny just now, and he didn’t want to risk her turning her fury on him.
I've said it before and I'll say it again - thank you so much for your comments, they really mean the world to me ♡ And to any silent readers, thank you for sticking with this story!
Draco wanted to ask Pansy what the bloody hell had just happened, but he knew he’d have to save the interrogation for later when they were alone. Instead, Draco somehow ended up making eye contact with Granger, who raised her eyebrows at him, clearly wondering the same thing. Draco just shook his head.
“I’m quite sure, Harry,” Slughorn replied with a fond smile. “I think the two of you should work together. The theme this year is ‘recovery and reconstruction.’ The idea is to invent your own potion — something related to the theme, however you want to interpret it — and then you will submit a sample accompanied by a written explanation of the process and its effects and interactions and so forth,” he explained, one hand gesturing in time with his words as he spoke. “So, what do you think?”
“And it was mostly an accident, anyway,” Draco added with a dismissive shrug. “You heard McGonagall—she just thought she was defending you. As if the Chosen One needs a thirteen-year-old girl to protect him.”
Weasley shared a glance with Potter. The redhead must have known that what he was about to say wasn’t going to go over well with Granger, because he reached out a preemptively placating hand as he began, “See, Hermione, the thing is—”
“Keep stirring,” he instructed, heading towards the supply cupboard. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for, exactly, but it gave him an excuse to escape Potter’s scrutiny, if only for a minute.
“I just got tired of those same silly furnishings, it’s like we’re still first years,” Draco muttered, focused on the precise movement of his knife as he started dicing his aconite root. What else was he supposed to tell Blaise? That the green had reminded him too much of Potter’s eyes and he couldn’t stand it? It sounded mad even to Draco, and he was certain that Blaise would misunderstand. His friends liked to read too much into everything Draco did recently.
“Oh.” The shift in Potter’s demeanour was palpable, all the tension fading from his posture with that one syllable, the airy sound of it both surprised and relieved. “Okay. Great. How about this weekend, then?”
Finnigan flushed red, an angry vein standing out on his neck as his jaw tightened.  “Oh yeah?” He plunged his hand into the pocket of his robes, drawing his wand. “Want to test that theory, Death Eater?”
“I thought it should be obvious, Mr. Malfoy.” Slughorn readjusted the quill in his hand, having nearly dropped it in his surprise, and reached for a stack of parchment.
He threw himself into his Arithmancy homework, which was always his most difficult and therefore the most effective source of distraction. And for a while, it worked. Lost amid complicated numerical charts, the thoughts inside his head — the ones that were cold and cruel, the ones that hissed the words
“Give me the paper, Pansy.” Draco held out his hand, voice deadly calm. She hesitated, glancing over at Blaise, and then with great reluctance handed it over.
When Slughorn finally came around to check on their progress, Draco was sticky with sweat and teary-eyed from the bitter fumes that filled the room, but he was satisfied.  Slughorn’s approving nod only served to confirm what Draco already knew: his potion was flawless. The mist on the surface was a pale silver, perfectly primed to begin the ageing process. It was far better than Blaise’s potion with its dark grey vapours, and whoever’s potion had filled the room with a strange orange fog was so far off base that Draco would have failed them on their N.E.W.T. right then and there if it were up to him.
Draco ignored the rapt attention of his classmates as he went to the front of the room, leaving a couple metres of space between them as he turned to face Potter. His grip tightened around his wand, not yet raised. He had already begun the process of emptying his mind, tucking away all hint of emotion like one might store coins in a vault, carefully stacked and locked behind a heavy door where they would be impenetrable, safe. There was a comfort in Occlumency that he had always liked, a sense of control. He could sort out the images and ideas that cluttered his brain, clean up the messy feelings he’d left strewn about and place them all under lock and key, just for a while.
And yet here Potter was, asking when they could get back to work. Perhaps the situation was not so dire as Draco had thought.
The soft sound of the bathroom door as he pushed it open seemed loud in the early morning quiet. It was almost like déjà vu, finding that he wasn’t alone. Just like the last time, Potter sat with his back against the wall across from the sinks, arms wrapped loosely around his knees. The last time the two of them had been here, Draco had stared at him in the mirror, frozen in a moment of understanding that neither of them knew what to do with.
He gestured for Potter to pass him what appeared to be a small stack of flesh-coloured fabric that he had set out earlier, but which were actually pieces of Mr. Mulpepper’s Multi-Purpose Synthetic Skin. While it was next to impossible to truly replicate a scar caused by dark magic, they had decided that the best course of action was to first see if their experiments were safe for human skin before they began testing anything on themselves.
Potter squinted at him. “Why not just do it yourself then, or get someone else? I don’t know what Slughorn was on about, honestly,” he said, shaking his head. “I’m really not that good at Potions. I’m sure he’d change his mind if you asked.”
“Careful.” Draco stepped around the barrels separating them, gently taking hold of Potter’s wrist and pulling his hand back. “Even dead, Bundimun secretions can be quite dangerous.”
Draco did remember then. He closed his eyes, thinking back to that flash of blue light with a growing sense of unease. He recalled the excruciating pain, much sharper then than it was now, but the memory that caused him the most distress was of a dark-haired figure leaning over him as he lay on the stone floor, saying his name over and over again. Someone with round glasses and very green eyes.
Draco swallowed hard, determined to keep his voice steady. “I understand, sir.” He turned away. “Thank you for trying.”
Still, when Blaise and Goyle finally brought it up, Draco blanched. Ignoring the glares of random Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs was one thing, but he couldn’t just brush off the questions from his friends. It had been easier with Pansy, who always seemed to understand the things he didn’t know how to say just as easily as the things he did.  It wasn’t like that with Blaise and Goyle; he had to tell them something, but the right words evaded him.
Potter shrugged. “I guess it’s a good thing I know better, then.” He was no longer smiling, but the assurance with which he spoke annoyed Draco just as much as when he had told McGonagall that Draco hadn’t intended to attack him.
If Draco hadn’t known better, he could’ve sworn Potter was even enjoying himself. He’d catch the Gryffindor smiling sometimes as he chopped up ginger root or measured out nettles or whatever else Draco had instructed him to do that day. And Draco had been very motivated to keep him busy, because every moment that Potter’s hands were free—and even sometimes when he probably should have been paying attention to the toxic ingredient or sharp knife he was holding—he occupied himself with watching Draco.
They grouped around her in a loose semicircle, numbering about two dozen in total. Draco was careful to stand as far away from Potter as possible.
McGonagall continued to regard them both, eyebrows raised, and after a moment, Draco realized she expected a response.
He looked up at the Gryffindor, eyes wide. “I never thought I’d say this to you Potter, but I think you might be a genius.”
“Well, Snape croaked, for one thing,” Weasley muttered before Potter could answer, earning him a sharp jab in the shin from Granger. “What? It’s true!”
McGonagall paused, anticipating the cheers that arose. Draco knew better than to think the enthusiasm extended to him. Nearly everyone had turned to look towards the Gryffindor table, and shouts of “Harry! Harry!” rang across the hall.
Draco, curious as to what Potter could possibly be doing, gave a nod, watching as Potter pushed up the sleeve of his shirt and then dipped the spoon into the potion. Draco moved closer, having to lean around the cauldron to see what Potter was doing. With his forearm now exposed, Draco could see a large circular scar just below his elbow, pale against his skin. Intrigued, he watched as Potter carefully dripped a small amount of the potion onto the scar, the rose-coloured liquid absorbing the moment it made contact with his skin. They were both silent, waiting, and as they watched, the colour of the scar shifted just a shade closer to Potter’s regular skin tone, and the edges of the mark seemed to blur a little. It was an almost imperceptible change, but it was something.
“It was when I was trying to figure out the clue for the second task, the one in the lake, do you remember?” Draco gave a small nod. “The clue was this big golden dragon’s egg, the one we retrieved from the first task, and it made this awful screeching noise when you opened it. I couldn’t figure out for the life of me what it meant. Then Cedric told me I should try taking it to the Prefects’ Bathroom. He gave me the password.”
Right. The potion. The whole reason they were there. Definitely not the time to be thinking about Potter’s lips or his hands or any of his other highly appealing body parts. “I’m not entirely sure, to be honest.”
Draco said nothing as Potter left. The pain in his side was beginning to recede, replaced by a heavy, drowsy feeling. It might have been his imagination, but the scent of spice and cedarwood seemed to linger.
“Yes, let’s go.” He grabbed hold of Pansy’s arm and all but dragged her towards the door, sparing only the briefest of glances over his shoulder at the dark-haired Gryffindor.
He cast a pointed glance towards the sole Hufflepuff in the class, Macmillan, whose empty cauldron and sheepish expression suggested he was the source of the awful orange smog. Slughorn gave him a small, patronising smile.
“Back off, Potter,” Draco commanded, shoving at Potter’s bony knee. They were sitting quite close together, having both gravitated toward the cauldron as they worked. Although it hadn’t bothered Draco until then, he now found everything about Potter’s presence a source of irritation.
“Er.” Potter blinked, looking caught off guard by this simple request. Granger’s frown deepened. Draco could practically feel her distress as she turned instead to her boyfriend, her voice now somewhat desperate.
There was no one else in the shop to overhear them, not even the owner, who Draco assumed must be somewhere in the back room. Still, something about the weighted silence of the place made him want to whisper.
“I know it’s not part of a typical Defence Against the Dark Arts curriculum, but this isn’t a typical class, is it?” Professor Hayward smiled, just a shade too cheerful for Draco’s liking. He didn’t know if it was her demeanour or just the simple fact that Draco tended to dislike more people than not, but he found the woman irritating. She was quite young, although that bothered him less than the fact that she seemed to scorn the textbooks, often deviating randomly from any semblance of a coherent lesson plan. He supposed it hadn’t been an easy job to fill, not with the lingering rumours that the position was cursed, but she barely seemed qualified.
“Well, you figured correctly.” Draco held out his hands for the books, but Potter made no move to return them.
Slughorn’s voice followed Draco as he fled from the room, that same loathsome note of pity colouring every word.
In his periphery, he could see Blaise and Pansy both reaching for their wands, and he could only hope that they knew better than to cast the first spell. Even if his friends had not had to fight quite as hard as Draco to return to Hogwarts, initiating a duel with the Gryffindors seemed like a pretty sure-fire way to get them all a one-way ticket home.
“You have been assigned dormitories with your same housemates, but you all will have a shared common space, which I will show you to now.”
When Pansy just smiled, brushing off his silent pleas, Draco turned to Potter, hoping to convey to the Gryffindor that this was not his idea in the slightest and to please, please help them get out of this situation as soon as possible. Unfortunately, it was hard to know whether Potter actually understood anything of what he was trying to express. The Gryffindor still looked hopelessly confused by the whole situation, which was very unhelpful, albeit kind of endearing.
“It wasn’t cheating, exactly,” Potter defended. “I had a second-hand textbook that had all kinds of notes written in it, about the ingredients and how to brew the potions and stuff, and it was really helpful. I didn’t know back then, but it was actually Snape’s old book, from when he was a student.”
“More than you’re capable of, I’m sure. But that’s not saying very much is it?” Draco drawled, a hint of a smirk on his lips. “Considering you can’t even cast the simplest of charms without it blowing up in your face.”
“It wasn’t right.” Potter watched the cauldron as he stirred. When he spoke again, his voice was low. “You were sixteen when you took the Mark. Your family was in danger. And He would’ve killed you. You didn’t have a choice.”
Draco hadn’t known exactly what to expect the next time he saw Potter. He had assumed it would be awkward, at the very least. Maybe Potter would regret what had happened, or maybe he would expect something of Draco now, something Draco wasn’t sure he could give him. Maybe Potter would kiss him in front of everyone. Maybe they would never touch again. Maybe the memory of what had happened in the classroom would sit like fallen fruit between them, easy to ignore at first but festering grotesquely with time.
“Who’s a troll?” Blaise asked, grabbing the photo out of Draco’s hand as he sat down next to him. Goyle, having just taken the open seat next to Pansy, leaned across the table to try and get a look at the picture Blaise was now examining. “Well, I wouldn’t call him a
He glanced over at Potter, who was sitting cross-legged on the edge of the massive sunken tub, watching it slowly fill with water. “There’s no bubble bath in that tap, is there?”
“Is there something you want?” Draco demanded, his voice faltering slightly on the last word. He wondered if Potter would realize how it echoed his question from the other night, the one Draco had asked as Potter leaned over him, eyes wild.
