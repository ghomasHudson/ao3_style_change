He took off, not quite skipping but almost, all worries and thoughts about Harry and blokes and anything really, far away from his mind.
yep, i am indeed
Draco tried to hide the pain that Harry’s stern words had caused him under a layer of coldness. “No. I was just going to ask you to let me deal with this. Those are my grades, after all.”
He didn’t like it. He didn’t like it in the least. Why in the Earth, of all the people who could have been his potions partner, had he have to get sorted with Potter? Really, with all the people who actually
Slughorn sternly watched them as Draco dragged Harry to their table.
“But I don’t want to,” Draco whinnied as he unwillingly sat. He discovered that, to his disappointment, he still had his robes on, crumpled by a night of restless sleep. “If I do, I’ll melt into the water and disappear.”
When they were seated and Draco was sure Harry wasn’t going to shout, he uncovered his mouth.
He sat in the border of his bed as he made a gesture for Harry to sit with him.
“Nothing. It was just that, a nightmare. You know, the war and stuff.”
freaking
Draco studied him for a few seconds, trying to take in as much details as possible and ending his inspection as he quietly muttered an “I guess you didn’t sleep so well either.” Draco extended a hand toward Harry and shook his shoulder slightly. Harry flinched at the touch before he was fully awake and saw where he was.
) that had provoked such reaction.
Whatever
He stood up and then he reached down to shake Harry, saying more to himself than to him, “Hey, Sleeping Beauty, I’d like to see you sleep for the rest of my life but as you said we have to go to class.”
Draco looked at his face, so open and sincere as he said that, and felt how tears swelled up his eyes. He shook his head half in disbelief, half in an attempt to clear his eyes.
As Harry entered the bedroom Draco turned to see him carrying a load of food in his arms.
When Madame Pomfrey threatened him with a curse, Harry had no choice but to leave. However, he went straight to their room to get his Invisibility Cloak and quickly came back to Draco’s side. He hadn’t even gone to dinner, afraid that the slightest hesitation on his part would make a difference on Draco’s state. Which hadn’t really changed all that much since he had fainted, except for a couple times his fever had come back. Harry had taken upon himself to make sure the wet cloth in his forehead remained fresh and the covers were up to his chin. Sometimes the blonde’s brow furrowed and Harry worried he might be having a nightmare, but Draco’s face promptly smoothed out when Harry held his hand, or brushed aside a lock from his face.
They tidied their room for hours with no stop until suddenly Draco’s stomach grumbled with hunger. Draco stopped midsentence, embarrassed. Harry looked surprised for a second before asking Draco softly if he wanted to go to the Great Hall to grab some dinner.
against his thigh. “Oh– oh, I guess it wasn’t a nightmare after all?”
but hey, i've been writing this since 2017 and since then i finished highschool, moved to costa rica for two years, finished a second highschool diploma, and now i'm about to start uni.
Draco was blushing furiously at the memory of Harry’s arms warm around him, his strong scent enveloping him and his steady breathing lulling him into sleep.
“Crucio.”
“What?”
As Draco said it, he could see Harry’s disappointed look, as if he really had wanted to go with him.
“I’m back!” Harry shouted from the other room.
“So,” Draco started to say as he tore away from the bathroom’s doorframe, suddenly very aware of his almost complete lack of clothes. “We should get ready.”
When Draco turned to face Harry’s bed he met an intense green gaze.
“Harry, I have Charms too! Why don’t we go together? Hermione has it also and we can take a shortcut through the yard.”
) long enough it would be ok. It would be like practicing with a spider or a rat.
When he reached his table he found Harry looking at him with the same expression of sadness he had sported at the beginning of the period.
, he reminded himself.
look at this, now it only took me like two months to update!!
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco barely noticed that he had passed the Hall gates until he was seated and talking to Granger about the Whistling Piper that their class was growing in Herbology.
“I’m glad you decided to come, Draco.”
“All right, Mister Potter. I’m going to let it go this time but if your partner wants a grade then he better make sure his name stays in its place.”
The nurse stepped towards Draco, starting to run the basic checks, flashing a Lumos in front of Draco’s eyes and snapping her fingers close to his face.
Draco choked in an attempt to swallow the tears before Harry saw them but failed as he helped him on his feet.
“You have to move it for ten minutes without letting it boil any other way and it’ll be ruined. Now, you do it.” Draco handed the spoon to Harry, who took it and started carelessly moving the poison.
Harry reached towards a rug in the wall, and tickled an elf in it. The elf let out a hushed laugh and let them in to one of the most beautiful rooms he had ever been into.
The same eyes that he had seen filled with pain just minutes ago now were full of a hatred more intense than anything Draco had seen or felt never. If he could, he would have sagged to his knees right there and then, as he realized his wish had been granted: Harry would never look at him as anything but a foe and with nothing in those emerald eyes but the fire of loath.
“Madammme Pomfrey, has there beeeeen other cases like, like, like me?” Draco was slurring his words, but the message seemed to get across.
i think the pwp will be another work entirely, i just dont think it fits in this story as well, but i'll link it when i post it
Malfoy turned to her, a blank stare in his eyes.
“I can’t go in there.” Draco whispered, his words little more than a breath as he caressed the old wood of the doors. His face was even paler than his already ashen tone, provided by the lack of sleep. “I can’t.”
Harry was blushing as he put Draco’s arm around his neck, trying to avoid looking down. “Draco, come out, I’m gonna get you in bed.”
“No, no, that’s wrong. Seriously Harry?” Draco blushed intensely as he covered his mouth.
WHERE IS THE ANGST??????
The most beautiful boy in this school, in the Wizarding World (
“So,” Harry said, “did you sleep well last night?”
“What?” Draco asked, with his walls already raised.
) pronounced those two words effortlessly, soft honey in a fly trap. He was as dangerous as he seemed.
“Draco”
) had apologized. He sensed when Harry laid down beside him, the mattress sinking with his weight and making him lie on his back.
“Oh, um, y’know, I was just wondering if you would mind helping me with potions since, as you already said, I’m a disaster in this class.”
“It was from my father… but you know that, don’t you Draco?” The girl stared at him with her deep blue eyes, silently accusing him.
Except.
“Who said that I’m into girls anyway?”
He hadn’t heard the room they were assigned.
) at Draco.
“Come on, you’ll feel better after a nice warm bath.”
“Because,” Draco said slowly, like he was explaining magic to a toddler “you are the fucking Chosen One, you killed He Who Shall Not Be Named and you are the motherswiner who I had been trying to severely damage since our first year.”
Ahem. If you like it, leave kudos and comments!
“Are you ok?” Harry leant back just enough to see Draco nodding as he gulped down a sob.
And possibly missing Potions.
“Draco. Draco, it’s ok, it’s only a dream…”
know.
“Hey.” Harry reached for Draco when he didn’t answer. “Hey. Stop.” He grasped Draco’s shoulder and forced him to face him, concern written in his features. “I don’t know what’s up but don’t worry about it.”
“And finally, but not surprising, Mister Potter got a perfect grade!” Slughorn looked like he had already recovered from Harry’s insolence earlier. “However, Mister Malfoy seems to think he’s too good for team work and didn’t present a sample of his work. Consequently, he has no grade in this assignment and will have to do extra work.” Draco thought he saw an evil glint in Slughorn’s eyes as he gave his sentence.
Once he was done dressing and rehearsed his best I-don’t-fucking-care-motherfuckers face in front of the mirror, Draco was ready to go.
“What are you doing?”
“I didn’t feel like eating,” said Harry and, for the way Granger’s eyes flashed with worry, Draco knew this wasn’t the first time Harry pulled up something like this.
Draco’s master narrowed his eyes at him, as if trying to decipher his deepest thoughts. “It is true that maintaining him alive can become a nuisance in the future, but I haven’t seen your curses in a while.” He waited for Draco to answer. “Are you refusing?” His master’s voice was as cold and calm as ice, just waiting for him to make a mistake to break under his feet and drag him to the bottomless darkness.
(See the end of the chapter for
) tightened his grip on his shoulders as a glint of worry shot through his eyes. Then he tentatively embraced the thin frame of Draco’s body, and Draco felt the last remnants of the cold fade away. He returned the hug, his hands wandering a little towards the lower back of the other boy (
) bedroom to change his uniform to something more comfortable, a plain shirt and jeans. As he took out the clothes from the wardrobe he inhaled the same aroma he had smelled that morning, a sad reminder of the cheerful star of day he had had, especially depressive compared to what the day had turned out to be.
) Draco turned, suddenly aware of the cold the white irradiated. He curled into himself, trying to maintain as much warmth as possible. His teeth started chattering and he couldn’t feel his fingertips anymore.
“What do you mean?”
“I’m just asking, did you sleep well last night?” Draco could almost swear that he saw a smirk in Harry’s face. “Because I didn’t have nightmares for the first night in a long time.”
relationship
“Hello, aunt Bella.” His voice had sounded more cracked than he had expected. “Has my Master summoned me yet?”
Hello, guys... sorry for not posting on time, it's a hard time right now as it is my last month of school and I have to work on a lot of stuff.... this isn't a true update but I promise it was going to be part of it... this happens the first night in their new room. Enjoy!
it's been a crazy two years, and this fic is kinda the onw thing i can always go back to.
“So do you think there will be scones for breakfast today?” Draco asked.
The tears started streaming down his cheeks as the mass in the floor struggled to stop the pain.
Harry sat through his Spells class without paying any attention. His mind was on more important things.
“Hi…”
Wasn’t it enough that he had been stuck in Hogwarts after the war because his dad was exiled in France and his mother had chosen to go with him? Leaving him all on his own in stupid Hogwarts, where the other students were always ignoring him. Not that it bothered him at all. He would be rather ignored than mocked or worse, as it had been just a few days back, when a group of Gryffindors found him distracted in one of the gardens and decided they’d like to have a little fun with him.
“And what are you going to do with these, hm, Harry?” Harry heard the sound of wet cloth against skin and couldn’t help but to look down. Draco was still wearing his boxers, he noted, a bit worried about the connotations of the boy getting in the tub with clothes.
Draco found the honey and stashed them in one of his pockets. Then, just for fun, he walked right through the crowd and watched as they hurried away from his path.
Harry was going to say something to Draco when Professor Slughorn entered the classroom with a handful of parchment pieces and his usual folder of papers.
Draco watched Harry storm out the room with a little smile in his lips.
he thought as he slide awkwardly to make room to fucking Potter,
When they reached the tapestry that hid the entrance to their room Harry tickled the elf while explaining to Draco how to know which one to tickle. After that, they entered and Draco was surprised again to see the beauty of their common room. Under the evening sun it seemed like a completely different chamber and Draco started to figure it out, awed by the skill of the designers as they had been able to capture a season with no more than the natural illumination of the various times of the day and a little magic, making winter the night and the blue shades the moonlight casted, spring with the way the morning sun lightened the colours of the draperies, summer with the noon sun and its almost unbearable intensity and lastly, as he was currently watching, autumn with the soft evening sun and the way its orange glow made the painted trees look like they were shedding leaves.
Draco nodded, not capable of restrain his eyes from pouring those stupid tears as he hear Harry offer something not even his family had given him. Support. Hope. Friendship.
The doors opened, blinding Draco with the sudden light.
Draco raised an eyebrow in surprise.
“Look. I appreciate that you think it’s unfair, but the only thing you’ll do is to make things worse for me because he’ll think I tattletale and everyone hates a tattletale, ok?”
The breakfast passed by with a light conversation between Hermione and Draco, Harry gulping down incredible amounts of food and Ron scornfully playing with his food.
“Well, possibly someone has erased it.” Draco was losing his coolness rapidly.
Questions follow
“I was totally capable of winning that argument without your help!”
“He’s right, Professor.” Harry stepped near the desk. “We both work on that potion and I myself wrote both our names in the vial.”
He stepped into the light, discovering a patio brightly illuminated by the summer sun, the water from the fountain singing as the butterflies flew across the air.
“Anyways, you should get dressed, unless you want to skip breakfast.” Harry glanced quickly at Draco, still in bed with only boxers and an oversized shirt.
When Draco finished turning his stomach inside out and there was no more puke in him at least for the next five years he washed his face and rinsed his mouth. As he peered into the mirror he found his pale face returning the glare with a stupid, half crazed grin in his mouth. He was happy, if he had to be honest. But he also was worried as fuck. How was he supposed to live through this without either killing himself or Harry or worse, embarrass himself while making Harry hate him?
“I wasn’t sure what do you like so I brought a little of everything.” Harry said as explanation for the banquet he was placing on Draco’s bed.
Two girls stood facing Draco, while a guy was mixing a very not-friendly looking potion in a boiling cauldron.
Professor McGonagall was calling the letter G, and the know-it-all Granger was paired with Padma Patil, and they were already sat together chatting about facts that only they cared about and Draco couldn’t breathe and there were so much less students than in the Sorting Ceremony and he knew why and he was going to get sick if he wasn’t already and Professor McGonagall was already calling the letter J and it was a relief because that meant he had another letter yet but then she was calling fucking Macmillan and why the fuck hadn’t survived any students with last names with letter K or L and then she was calling him and that meant he actually had a roommate and he wanted to go to the front but he couldn’t because he was frozen with panic and then there it was, Harry was holding his hand squeezing it and telling him to go and that it would be fine and his feet moved on their own an then he was in the front confronting the students’ faces filled with hate and despise and hearing them mutter about him and everything was so much, too much and then Professor McGonagall said the name of his new roommate and then there was silence because no one could believe it and even the Hufflepuffs couldn’t cheer this time when Harry walked slowly to the front and smiled at him and said in a low voice: “I’m glad it was you, aren’t you glad too?” And he was but he couldn’t say he couldn’t speak and he just wished they were away far far away with no one near so he could tell Harry how relieved and thankful he was for this but also he wanted to go to the bathroom to throw up and that’s what he did, he jumped in a crazy sprint toward the hall door trying to beat the nausea to the restroom, barely making it.
After that hideous duel between Potter and He Who Shall Not Be Named, after the teachers had counted the dead and the wounded, the students that had survived were told to sleep in the Great Hall with promises that they would have rooms soon. A week had passed and they had gone to regular classes, if there was still such a thing. They didn’t have got dorms yet and the former Slytherins were being harassed day and night, accused of evilness, got beaten, scared to death with death threats murmured to their ears at night, received in howlers at the morning (how did the owls act as if nothing had happened?), their properties destroyed. The first and second years were the most susceptible to these shenanigans, sometimes even breaking into tears at the breakfast when they received an anonymous letter fearing, not without reason, that this time it would be them the mocked, the abused, the tortured one.
“Ok, ok, stop babbling, I can’t understand what you say if you talk that fast.” Harry held his nose bridge in a gesture so familiar to Draco that he could see it in his dreams.
Draco was sitting in his bed profusely sweating and panting, tears streaming down his face as he stared into pools of emerald. He didn’t know what time it was, all he knew was that for some reason Harry was shaking him by his shoulders, telling him that it was ok, that it was just a dream, that it couldn’t hurt him…
“Could you… c-couldyoupleasestaywithme?”
They ate the rest of their dinner like that, Harry sat next to Draco in his bed, and Draco’s heart was breaking for the pain but at the same time beaming for being that close to Harry; and then there was only a little pumpkin pie left and Harry took it and broke it in half and gave one to Draco
Harry’s face lit up with the thought of spending time with Draco, even if it meant watching over some stupid concoction.
“You were having a nightmare…?” Harry’s sentence –no, his very train of thought was interrupted by the feeling of
“But why would you wait me?” Draco cursed his voice as it broke with the last word.
), and asked. “So, who’s the lucky bird?”
“Yeah… you know where our room is?”
“I don’t want to,” whinnied Harry, startling Draco. “You can see me sleep the rest of your life if you want to because I want to sleep the rest of mine.”
hi sorry for updating once every thousand years school (ib) is killing me
He was examining the dark haired boy trying to figure why was he there when he noticed the food in his pockets and under his arm.
When Draco started tossing and gasping in his sleep, Harry knew he was having a nightmare. He held his hand, but it seemed that the dream was too disturbing. Instinctively, Harry climbed beside him and cradled the thin frame of the other boy in his arms. He felt his heart might break. Harry had never expected to find himself in this situation, embracing the love of his life in an infirmary bed while said love was waning quickly.
“Fuck you, Malfoy, I thought we agreed to at least try to be friends.” Now Harry looked like he was really angry, and Draco was surprised that he had managed to make fucking Potter snap.
“Ok.” Harry didn’t look happy at all but Draco knew it was better that way.
Harry had finished dressing and now he stood in front of Draco, oozing that intoxicating scent of his and expelling those “fuck me” vibes that Draco was trying very hard to ignore.
One minute he had been walking to Potions and the next he knew, someone had stunned him from behind, telling him to disappear already.
HERE IS THE ANGST!!!!!!!!
“It’s gorgeous, isn’t it?” Draco said softly as he admired the room and the lace curtains moving with the autumn breeze.
Draco drifted through the rest of his classes doing his best to ignore fucking Potter, though it turned out to be a hell of a work as he seemed to be trying his best to fill his I’m-being-friendly roll. He let out a sigh of relief as he listened to the bell marking the end of classes and the call to lunch.
“You were going to give up.”
pls re read the previous chapter bc i added a bit at the end.
“Why?”
“Yes, Mister Malfoy, and I’m afraid it’s only happened to Slytherin students.  We still don’t know what is wrong, and they’re fading quickly. So if you remember anything, please, Mister Malfoy, tell me.”
The heads of every soul in the room turned to see the focus of the ruckus and saw what they never had thought possible: the Chosen One whining as the Death Eater dragged him into the class, though the last showed a hint of a smile, which was soon replaced by a scowl when he noticed the attention he was the centre of.
Draco could hear Harry rummaging in his closet and felt his anger and embarrassment fade away. After all, stupid Potter (
Draco was sitting in one of the infirmary beds, not really sure about anything except that Harry had brought him there, and now he was talking to an increasingly concerned Madame Pomfrey, but he couldn’t hear what they were saying, he felt as if someone had submerged his head into a fishbowl.
“Are you sure you’re all right?” Granger sounded unsure about letting the topic slide and Draco couldn’t help but to finish his farce and straighten in his seat.
Two meters.
And now he was sitting in a corner of his bed, dumbfounded, his little problem fading quickly at the thought of having to have
He looked as if in a dream (
When Draco woke up gasping desperately for air he didn’t recognize where he was. After a few moments of panic he remembered: His dorm. His
“Anyway, you heard Granger, right? It seems that our potion was fine!” Draco tried to change the topic to more cheerful ways.
“Well, give me that, it’s time to put it in.” Draco snatched the bowl from Harry’s hands and emptied it into the steaming cauldron.
“Anyway, Potter, where are your groupies?”
“I said it’s unf---”
“All right, all right, I forgive you, ok? Now can we end this conversation? I’m tired as fuck.” Draco flopped down in his bed, his back towards Harry.
“Let’s go.”
“Sorry to keep you waiting.”
) pleading, “Is there no chance? Not even a tiny, tiny chance?”
“What can I do for you?” Draco bowed slightly as he answered his Master.
“Potter.” Draco forced himself to look at his eyes instead of staring at the tent in Harry’s pants. “You really should take a cold shower.”
“Oh, seems like the snake is finally awake!” Draco heard a sneering voice approaching and realized that making himself known might not have been such a good idea.
Draco headed to his (
sorry, i still have a fuckton of work to do so next update is when it is???
“Ah, well, I don’t know…” The look in Harry’s eyes was definitively painful. Like he was betraying him. Which he wasn’t. Absolutely. “Why don’t we wait to see who we get as roommate and then we talk about it?”
As he strode through the empty hallways he tried to maintain his anxiety under control, to avoid looking like prey. When he reached the Great Hall he discovered a human form leaning on the doorframe. He automatically put up his shields and walls, only to drop them as he recognized the figure as fucking Potter.
Draco got up and ready, whining all the way to the Hall that it didn’t matter if he got breakfast today because he had a free hour. Privately, though, he was glad he had an excuse to spend some more time with Harry, since they didn’t have the first class together.
One meter.
But he couldn’t. No, he couldn’t, not after what he had told him in the Great Hall, those stupid little words that made him have the hope he shouldn’t have. But he had. Maybe the only thing he could do was play along the Destiny, bid whatever orders it sent his way. So Destiny gave him a chance. Well, he would take it. For the better or the worse.
They walked side by side joking lightly like they were afraid of letting the other see how they truly were inside, afraid of scaring each other off. Draco started to mock Harry’s hair and he defended himself arguing that he couldn’t control it. After teasing him, Draco dared to extend his arm and actually touch his hair, a little surprised to find it was feathery soft instead of wiry, as he had imagined it.
“Professor, that’s unfair.” Draco turned to see Harry in the middle of the way, facing Slughorn.
“I’m not saying it isn’t but you can’t win this battle and the only thing you are going to get is to scrub some dirty cauldrons or something. So cool down, anyway it doesn’t affect you.”
“Harry, where were you this morning? We didn’t see you at the Hall.” Exclaimed the redhead while throwing an untrusty look towards Draco.
They were seated by the ancient tree by the lake, setting the food Harry had smuggled out the Great Hall in Draco’s cape after they found the perfect spot to eat. Autumn painted Hogwarts landscape with shades of orange and brown, the wind sweeping the leaves the trees let go. There was just the right amount of sun to be comfortable, not too much to start sweating but not too little to freeze with the morning breeze.
Malfoy sat up and buried his face in his hands, now fully awake and embarrassed. “Ohhh my God. Ohhhhh my fucking God. Fuck. Fuck.
“Madame Pomfrey? What did he say? Is he going to be alright?” Harry was so worried he was practically trembling, squeezing his hands hard.
) by the corner had proved pretty hard against his mind.
Slughorn let out a vexed sigh, obviously defeated by the Boy Who Lived.
Draco woke up in the darkness. He couldn’t see anything, feel anything. He could only smell the stink of rot that was caused by humidity held sealed too much time. Draco, despite the blindness and the numbness that seized his body, knew where he was. The dungeons of the Malfoy Manor, so familiar he could feel the bars of the gate in front of him without even touching them. Familiar, yes. He could go with familiar, but never comfortable in there. He had gotten this familiar to the cells in the eternal periods he had spent down here, when his Master, his aunt or even his Father sent him in punishment for neglecting an order delivered to him. He didn’t disobey their orders often, though. However, when he did, the ones in his charge usually fared a worse destiny than it had been ordered before, just to make him suffer. He knew. Oh, his mother had tried to hide it from him, but he knew. He knew he had the fault of many deaths and the Dead would accompany him to the grave. And Draco was ok with that. He had accepted it, the pain of guilt threatening to overwhelm him every moment of his day. And night. But what was he doing here? He dreamed of dead people, (it was normal by now, almost like greeting old friends every night) but this? He had only dreamt of something alike once, and he trembled only to the memory of it. Could this be the same? He wished he could wake, that Harry woke him, that anyone saved him from the horrors to come…
He sat beside him, pondering everything.
“Can we stay here today?” Draco hoped that didn’t sound too much like begging. He knew he hadn’t succeeded by the look in Harry’s face, so he just keep talking, waiting for Harry to reject him. “You know, we could arrange our things and stuff and decorate and I don’t know, maybe I can help a little with your tower of homework and by the way why don’t you organize your time better, you’re such a mess…” Draco covered his mouth in an attempt of retrieving those last words he had let out, afraid he had angered Harry.
in his arms. Still, Harry was sure that if he stayed there for just a moment longer he would probably have the same problem, so he rose from the bed (
“Yes, ma’am. Sorry.” Harry saw the anger in the nurse’s eyes disappear, replaced by concerned understanding.
Ok that's it. I cried blood tears when writing this and my beta wanted to kill me but here is it: the angst you people were waiting for.
Draco took out his wand and pointed to the mass of flesh on the floor. If he ignored the fact that it was human (
“Yeah.” Harry was looking still not awake at all, blinking as he made a move toward the shower.
went to a clinic for a while (which fucking sucked)
“I guess you have. Well, we obviously don’t want to kill you…. Yet. Plus it would mean a lot of legal trouble for us. We just want you gone for a while! So, this is a diluted solution of the poison. As I said, it won’t kill you but it will give you a bad time for a while.”
him. However, it would have been less depressive if he had stayed with his own house’s students. He would have been understood. Wanted. Useful. What if the little ones did get harassed as he was? Who was going to fend for them? Nobody, that’s it. He had been the only one who cared about how they were feeling when the war started and the other kids started to call names at the first years Slytherins. And now all his work was destroyed. The littluns would not have a friend in their new dorms and they probably wouldn’t be able to talk to their peers without getting accused of plotting to get a new dark mage to power. They wouldn’t make any friends until at least another month or two, if they kept trying. They had to. Draco wouldn’t let them give up. Because if there could be one good thing to get out of this horrible mess it would be that there weren’t house prejudices anymore. He wanted to see that. Or at least, if he couldn’t be a part of it, hear about it from the first years. That they had friends. That they had created new families. That they had people who loved them. That they could feel the world was a place worth to live for. To fight and die for.
Draco heard their steps resonating along the empty corridors as he and his aunt hurried to the dining hall of the Malfoy Manor, where He Who Shall Not Be Named had established his headquarters.
“I-I-I-I don’t know w-what you’re t-t-t-talking about” Draco stammered as he turned to check on their cauldron’s fire temperature.
hi hello hi
Draco thought as he snug into Harry’s chest, humming low when he felt Harry’s arm hug his shoulders.
“We should better get at it now, it probably will take us all the afternoon.”
“No, I’m fine.” Draco tried to keep on attaching the poster he was trying to put over his headboard without looking too nervous.
“What?” Slughorn stared harshly at Harry, as unable to believe he had dared to reply to him.
Draco pushed the door, waiting for Slughorn’s scolding, but it never came. Instead, there was a collective gasp and then the class was spinning and he was dropping and Harry was rushing towards him, pulling him out of the class and maybe Draco was still not fully himself, since he couldn’t really make sense out of any of this.
“Harry?” Draco blinked, startled by the very real boy holding him close.
But here it is!
“With all due respect, why don’t you just kill him?” Draco assumed the role of bratty heir to the maximum length he could, risking not only his family’s life and him self’s but also Harry’s. “Wouldn’t be better for your plans to have him dead? Every second he is still alive is a threat for the cause.”
“Mister Potter!” Madame Pomfrey swatted at Harry’s head, full of indignation. “Didn’t I tell you to leave yesterday?”
“Then it’s fine, think about it, but tell me how can I help. Please.” Harry was looking at him with those stray puppy eyes again and Draco just wanted to shout that he
Harry turned a deep red as he sat back down. “Nothing, professor, I apologize.”
I've been very busy but in compensation this is a very long chapter and it has just a teeny tiny bit of angst so I hope you enjoy it! Also I may or may not be posting more frecuently since I graduated and now I have more free time! Enjoy!
Draco was standing in a white… space? He didn’t have any other word to describe it, just an interminable extension of white not exactly surrounding him, since this was not oppressive, but rather expanding farther than his eyes showed him. He felt peace, a strange thing for him since his dreams were normally populated by the horrors of his past recombined in the monstrous ways his warped imagination deemed right.
When people seated at last and Professor McGonagall announced how the thing was going to be, it seemed to be the Sorting Ceremony all over again. As he watched his fellow Slytherins sent with people, Draco started to hold his breath unconsciously. Only when Potter touched his shoulder he let out a shaky breath, wondering why had Harry just did that. As it seemed, the only ones happy with this new forced mixed life were the Hufflepuffs, as always cheering to everyone who got claimed.
“Ah, Potter. I can’t tell you yet, it’s just so…” Harry watched as the nurse walked mindlessly to her office, as if something was troubling her deeply. He could swear he heard her mutter to herself something along the lines of “
“What a wonderful idea!” Maggie took the gag from Draco’s mouth.
“Fuck.” Harry’s surprise was muffled by the door, but it was still loud enough for Draco to hear it. His smile turned to an evil smirk.
” He spat the name as if it were poison. “I should think you would like to have a little fun with him.” The Dark Lord stopped dead in front of Draco, no more than two feet apart. He stared at him with those inhuman eyes and Draco knew his mind was being examined.
“Why not? Oh, never mind I get it.” Harry had an understanding look that if it were plastered in anyone else’s face Draco would have tried to punch them. “I’ll go, do you want me to bring something for you?”
) they realized that it was very late in the night and they should go to sleep. So they went to their respective beds and Draco whispered
“Why won’t you take care of that, Harry?” Harry blushed even more violently, if it was possible, and turned his head away.
“Because I know you suck at potions and if you think you can drag me with you to the bottom you got to be even more stupid than I thought.”
And now he was trapped who knows where.
“Sorry, I’m hungry.” Draco had his mouth almost too stuffed to talk, but he managed to gulp and started to eat more calmly.
Draco couldn’t believe his ears. Did Harry Fucking Potter just apologized to him? To him, the Death Eater that killed Dumbledore? Maybe he was still dreaming?
“I’m… I’m sorry, Potter. It’s just… It’s been a long day.” Draco stammered a whispered apology and saw, relieved, as Harry’s eyes softened.
Ahhhhh...... Guys, sorry for not posting......
“Well…” Harry looked unsure as he started to phrase his question. “What were you dreaming last night?”
“I’m going to go to sleep again, ok?” He started to climb down Draco’s bed but stopped when he felt Draco tugging at his shirt. He turned to see him looking down at his bedsheets.
He realized that his surprise might be taken as something else and quickly stammered, “Oh, really? Well, that’s fine… I mean, it’s cool? I guess? –I um, I’m into both?”
) senses when he felt Harry’s mouth at his neck. He bit back a moan and dug his fingers into Harry’s hair.
“What did you say, Mister Potter?” Slughorn was clearly angry, a vein pulsing in his forhead.
“Yes. I heard you made some really good Licroatan yesterday. I was wondering, no offense Harry, how did you manage to accomplish it with him as a partner?” Draco smiled a little at Granger’s joke, happily answering with a smirk towards Harry.
Between the disturbance and the command, Draco pointed his wand down. As he turned to look to the cause of the uproar, his body was seized by a curse. A brown head and a ginger head stormed through the opening in the window casting spells at anything moving. The Dark Lord had fled when he saw the pair accompanied by a squad of aurors, leaving his minions behind to clean his mess. Draco couldn’t move a muscle as he saw his father and mother being arrested and their wands snatched from their hands. He couldn’t do anything to stop the tears from keep rolling down his face as Potter’s friends started throwing healing spells at Harry’s wounds.
“So,” Harry said slowly, as if trying to unscramble what Draco had said, “you want us to stay here today?” Draco’s heart caught in the way Harry said
“Well?”
Draco stomped through the hallways in the long way to Charms, as he knew Potter would be using the shortcut. It also gave him time to think how the hell was he going to make it through the rest of the year with Harry for roommate, Potions partner and pseudo friend, not to forget all the hate the rest of his classmates would be directing to him for that closeness to the fucking hero of the Wizarding World and being the Death Eater and being Draco Malfoy and in summary, for being the fucking prat he was, or at least he had been.
He brushed off the pang of hurt he felt as he told Draco to get ready. They didn’t have first block together, so he wanted to enjoy their breakfast and then disappear.
Draco was already there, cutting Harry midsentence while pulling him to their table and apologizing to Professor Slughorn.
am i a tease?
“You’re right, Maggie… Maybe he’s not fully awake yet” With that, the subordinate slapped Draco across the face hard enough to make him turn his head. “Hey snakey, are you awake?”
Harry (
“Others, Mister Malfoy? What do you mean?”
Draco was angry with Harry, so angry that he didn’t care about what he was doing. He walked to the one place he felt safe in. The old Slytherin common room, now used as dorms for the second years. He stormed through the door and ran to his secret place, a small room which door was hidden behind a tapestry. When he was inside, he reached for the window, sitting beside and distractedly observing the underwater sight, fishes swimming and algae dancing with the current.
), no one with whom he could be himself (
He stood in the same place he had been that very morning, though now it seemed like years ago. Remembering that nice breakfast by the lake and the smile Harry had given him then, Draco braced himself and opened the doors of the Great Hall.
Draco thought,
He went to his bed and lied down. When Harry didn’t come, he turned to see him.
“But why would someone do that, Mister Malfoy?” Now Draco was sure that Slughorn knew that was his sample too, he just loved to torture him too much to give up now.
Draco wakes up in Harry's arms with a boner.
“You want to talk?” He shook his head.
Harry shot him an amused look at the evidence that Draco had been watching him before and let out a grave chuckle. Draco looked down embarrassed, a slight pink painting his cheeks.
The younger boy opened his eyes and there was a moment before Harry saw recognition in the silver pools his irises were.
“Yes?”
“I– um– this– uh…” stammered a now fully awake Draco, blushing hard and moving as far from
By the middle of the class, Longbottom had had been carried to the infirmary as his potion had suddenly seemed to break into boil and one of the bubbles splashed Neville as it exploded. Draco, seeing this, had double checked the fire beneath the cauldron, not wanting to hurt himself or worse Harry, considering the possibility that if Harry got injured while being his partner, everyone would think he made it on purpose.
“Don’t play fool with me, Potter. Why did you interfere?”
“Sorry, I don’t know what’s wrong with me today, I have the head on the clouds. What were you saying?”
“Even I have to eat, Potter.” Draco saw, once again, how the sparkles in Harry’s eyes died as he noticed Draco’s stern tone.
heyyyy
Draco tried to ignore the whimpers in the corner of the room, a human suffering and nothing he could do to help.
“Are you now, Harry? Are you taking me to bed?” Draco’s eyes were still closed but he was lifting his eyebrows in a way that suggested an evil glint if his eyes were open. They were in the bedroom now, and Harry walked with Malfoy to the space between the beds.
) less than three feet apart from him.
His hair was all mussed and there was a light blush where the sunlight had bathed him.
but here we are now, and i am determined to finish this :)
They finished the poison successfully and in time, much to Draco’s relief and Harry’s amazement. Draco filled a bottle with a sample and labelled it with their names before taking it to the professor’s desk.
“With all I would like to take the offer, Draco”
now i'm rambling
“Sure, let’s go.”
All he knew was that there was darkness all around him.
“Well, I hope you don’t mind, but it’s in the first floor, near the greenhouses exit.”
“Fuck you.”
They walked the rest of the way to the dungeons in a calm pace, dismissing the fact that they were running late and enjoying the loneliness of the hallways this allowed.
“Yeah, that’s fine, that’s a great idea!” (Fucking) Potter was actually fucking bouncing in his seat.
“I wasn’t!”
Draco let out a frustrated huff before preparing the cauldron and pouring the water needed to let it boil. Then he told Harry to finely cut the belladonna root under his meticulous glare while he grinded to dust the dried leaves of verbena. After all, with all he was the Chosen One and the source of all his pains, Harry couldn’t make a simple potion without fucking something up, and Draco wasn’t going to let him ruin his one good grade.
“Well, now you can come to the Great Hall anytime you want.” Harry was walking more slowly now that Draco was with him.
The leader grabbed Draco by the shirt, dragging him out of the closet and closer to the fire.
also ye i know this is late but thats kinda expected at this point???
“Tell us, snake, has your class done the Licroatan poison yet?” Draco’s eyes almost popped out of their orbits.
They opened the doors with a smile in their faces, though it didn’t last long on Draco’s as he rapidly scanned the room for any empty space. Harry saw the worry take over Draco’s features and started moving towards where he had seen Ron and Hermione.
Draco picked up his bag and prepared to leave when Harry asked him if he could wait for him, as they had the next class together too. Draco was about to agree when Weasley interrupted.
“Hey guys… this is Draco, he’s a new friend and I want him to eat with us.”
Again, Draco went to get the materials for the task assigned, but now Harry was at his heels with the excuse of “wanting to know what they were doing”. Draco was a little glad for this as they were able to pick first again but now he didn’t feel like a plague carrier.
“Are you going to come here or are you willing to spend tonight on your own with the nightmares?” Draco was still facing the other way, but Harry could hear the pout in his voice.
“Anyways, I’ll say it again, so listen. I’m sorry for what I did. But I do care and want to help, so tell me how?”
“What? I’m not angry, moron. I was just surprised.”
“Well then, may I ask why do you have food out of the Great Hall?”
Draco smoothed his face into a mask, covering the emotions that attempted to spill if he looked long enough at the lump at his feet.
“Why? I’m sure there are more important things that occupy you and I don’t really mind, actually. I mean, of course I don’t like it but at least it’s not so bad as at the beginning and the worse just happens to the upper graders and we can deal with it, we can. I just told you because you asked. You shouldn’t worry.” Draco finished his speech softly, with a hidden plead in his voice as he looked up at Harry’s eyes.
“What?” Draco just realized he must have been daydreaming in potions or else he would have known what was Potter talking about.
“Mister Malfoy” When he didn’t respond, she shook his shoulder lightly. “Mister Malfoy, do you have any idea what happened to you?”
“Draco, Draco, look what we found!”
“Oh, um, yeah, I’m fine. A bit tired, that’s all.” Harry quickly put away his stuff. “So, what do we have now?”
also!!
“So? Who’s the lucky gal?”
“Oh, really? Well, that’s fine… I mean, it’s cool? I guess?”
Draco raised an eyebrow in what Harry could only guess was exasperation. He could practically hear him:
“Hi.” Draco said under his breath, noting that he was still too close to Harry, not having moved since he touched his lips.
Harry’s gaze was colder than the icebergs as he replied.
“Well, let’s eat.” Draco spoke, breaking the spell that their eyes had created between them as he casted an incantation in the food to heat it again as it had become cold with the wind.
“Well,” Draco spat, “you should, because I
This time however, it was just white. No noise, no smells, no nothing but the sensory peace Draco craved so
“Shut your gob, Draco.” His aunt had a vicious glint in her eyes. “The Dark Lord has his plans and it is futile for a brat like you to try to understand His designs. Pull yourself up and clean as best as you can, He indeed has called you to His presence. Behave.”
Which was bad, because he now had time to notice the little details of the moment, like how he and Potter were the only ones outdoors and the way the sun put flashes of blue in Potter’s dark hair or how if Potter looked at him the sun reflected in his eyes making them almost luminescent themselves and the way fucking Potter swallowed was so fucking sexy and he wanted to bite his Adam’s apple and how the way Potter nibbled at his food was such a turn on and he was having another attack but this one was different because it felt so good, so good to be here with Potter and just pretend the rest of the world didn’t exist, at least for a while.
They climbed the stairs in silence, only the sound of their breath interrupting the calmness of the night. As they reached the bedroom Draco saw two beds with curtains and raced to one, flopping into them without bothering to cover himself as he fell asleep at the moment his head touched the pillow. Harry threw a blanket over him, smiling to himself as he saw his new roommate’s face relax in his sleep.
to turn the lights off.
) and that Harry liked Draco. More than like a friend. If he hadn’t told him that he was gay, Harry would have resigned himself to a life of longing looks from across the room and wishing for what he couldn’t have. But. This changed everything.
“No, nothing, nothing at all…” Harry continued to grind the stems.
awake alright, maybe he’s just not feeling so well”
He had been too closed, too curt to act like a friend of him but still he wanted, he longed to be not exactly friends, but something even closer, deeper.
Draco suddenly returned to his (
“You were going to get into trouble.” Draco rested his head in his hands, letting out a sigh of fatigue. “You know, Potter, you can’t just go around telling people when they are being unfair. Especially not teachers.”
“I was wondering when would you go out” Harry smirked at Draco in a way that made his knees wobble and remember his last conversation with himself.
Usually, however, Draco would stick to reality and accept that he would be stuck with someone who probably feared or despised him for the rest of the year. If he made it to the graduation. Anyway, Draco wished that he got paired with a Hufflepuff, that way it would be easy to get by.
Stupid fucking Potter. Stupid
Draco snatched his hand from Harry’s as if this was on fire and with an expression of horror in his features, though he tried to soften his face when he saw Harry’s hurt look.
“A potion is not only the most difficult part, it’s all the parts, and you made the disgusting part of it.”
Draco discreetly smelled his armpit until he noticed his aunt’s eyes were on him.
“Ohhhhh, Potter, you have girly hair.” Draco exclaimed as he buried both his hands in Harry’s hair from the back.
Draco listened to the children’s laughs as he tried to cover his ears.
Remembering the times when his samples had been intriguingly broken or altered, Draco placed their work beside the others’. By the time he was back to their (
Draco watched Harry speechlessly as he took him by the arm and guided him to a corner of a mostly empty table.
Draco blushed furiously and shoved him away to Harry’s surprise.
All the conversations suddenly died as Draco stepped into the Hall. Not only he was the Death Eater and had dared to present himself at lunch but also he was late to the meal. Draco stared at the mixed tables, not knowing where to sit anymore. There were Hufflepuffs everywhere and a noticeable quantity of Ravenclaws too, though most of the Gryffindors kept to themselves.
He stood in the darkness with his hand on his ears. He was wearing his trademark black suit, and he could see nothing in front of him. The darkness, though, was a light kind of black, the kind one would think it exists in a room painted so fluidly that you can’t distinguish the corners, not the oppressive, invade-it-all kind of darkness that Draco thought was the space. He tilted his head pensively as he tried to guess if the laughs were still there. As he didn’t hear anything he uncovered his ears, just to find the same bright yet macabre laughs of little kids.
“It’s okay for me.”
And when they finished eating and cleaning the mess they had done with the food (
Harry’s eyes darkened before he set his jaw in what Draco knew was a gesture of determination and answered.
“I’m going, just let me put on something more comfortable.”
Draco was struggling to decide what he was going to wear on the D-ceremony when it dawned on him that people probably wouldn’t thought of how was he going. Or if he was going at all.
Harry hummed and gently pushed him back until he was laying back in a soft bed (
“Well, it’s true it was hard, but if you tell him slowly what you want him to do sometimes he understands you. I can lend you a dog training manual if you want to.” Harry flipped him off, his mouth too stuffed for him to talk.
“As I was saying before Mister Malfoy interrupted us, today we’re going to study another poison, this is the Skinner poison which, curiously, doesn’t kill the victim but turns them into wood. Now, the wood in which person turns changes from person to person. I must not remind you that the secondary effects of an incorrect proportion of the ingredients can be fatal for the subject. As this is an immediate effect and, if well done, not lethal poison you will test it in your partners. Now, to work.” Professor Slughorn seemed nastily satisfied with himself.
“Potter.” Draco called Harry, not daring to call him by his name just yet.
“So, can I ask you something?” Harry inquired tentatively after a while, as if trying not to scare Draco.
… be b-broken anymore…” Draco said as a new wave of tears trailed down his cheeks.
… Draco lost his train of thought as Harry nibbled his earlobe.
“Please, Madame Pomfrey, please.” Draco’s eyes were closing, and he didn’t have enough strength to do anything but whisper. “
As Draco fought to breathe he felt a hand on his shoulder and heard a voice asking him if he was ok. He gasped for air and his ears cleared.
Harry turned his head so fast that it hurt Draco. He saw confusion for a moment and then… was that acceptance? relief? Draco couldn’t say, but he was glad that it wasn’t disgust.
“Thanks for waiting for me, Malfoy” Harry said loud enough for anyone in a three-metres-radius range to hear.
“And why is that, Mister Malfoy?” Draco was so sick of the game they all played he was going to drop this, at least he had tried.
“I don’t know how you sneaked back in, but if I catch you again during off-visitors hours I’ll just have to banish you permanently, do you understand?”
“Wow, Malfoy, leave me something.” Harry was eating more slowly, probably because he had been eating a little more continuously than Draco, though not
“Crucio.”
“Yeah, me too.”
“I said” Potter uttered with an exasperated look, “that I don’t mind being your partner.”
he thought,
“Wow Potter, you really know how to sneak food out of the Hall, don’t you?” Draco exclaimed as he watched amazed the amount of food in his bed. “Shall we?”
Harry approached Draco inch by inch, getting closer to him until he was next to him and he put an arm over his shoulders.
So Harry made his way under the covers and hugged Draco, cradled his head as he thought of all the different ways in which he was too deep into this. After a while, Harry could hear the peaceful breathing Draco made now he was asleep, and he wondered if ever existed a better sedative than seeing this beautiful silver haired boy sleep.
voice.
i can't believe it has been half a year since i updated this
) and walked to the bathroom.
Harry watched intently Draco’s livid face, searching for something even though he couldn’t say what he was looking for. He gently raised his hand to take the other boy’s hand and started to rub circles in it with his thumb. Harry didn’t really know what he was doing but he figured if he got the other boy to relax then it would be ok. Draco tore his gaze from the doors slowly, just to let it land on their intertwined hands and specially Harry’s thumb, as if he didn’t understand what it was doing there. Gradually, the blank stare he had in his eyes disappeared, replaced by concern.
“I just was wondering what was that about?”
i did my best
Harry felt his face grow hot as he stepped down the bed and hurriedly put on shoes.
“But you came, even if it’s late, so let’s go.”
“Stop being so jealous, you ass,” Harry muttered, rolling his eyes. “What do you mean it’s about time?” he asked Seamus.
“I know,” Draco said softly. His agreement knocked some of the anger out of Neville. “I know he’s too good for me. I’ve done so many… terrible, terrible things. I don’t deserve someone as good and kind as Harry. I know I don’t. But I want to. I want to do great things so that I can be someone that deserves him.”
“You were serious about the library?”
“How long have you two been a couple?”
“I wanted to know if you’ll go with me to the Yule Ball.”
“Yea. I do. So, what do you want?” Harry huffed.
“It really is, isn’t it?” Hermione agreed. “Maybe we should go get breakfast.”
“I just want tonight to be perfect,” Harry said, running a hand through his hair. “Hermione deserves it. She’s worked so hard to get that promotion.” He looked up at Draco, his face serious. “I don’t want the focus to be on me and I know Molly is going to question me about who I’m dating.”
Ron’s mood seemed to improve once food was in front of him and the tension eased out as Hermione started talking to Blaise about their N.E.W.T.S. Everyone seemed to enjoy the meal and by the end of it they were laughing and joking together.
“Keep telling yourself that, Potter,” Malfoy said as he entered the room. Harry could hear him moving around for a moment before the lights went out and he crawled into the bed, as well.
“I’ve seen him down before,” Granger added, “Like when Sirius died and after the battle, but I’ve always been able to reach him. It’s like we can’t get through.” She sighed and put her head in her hands.
“There aren’t extra dorm rooms for the returning students so we’re all in rooms that used to be for professors when the school had a bigger population,” Malfoy said over his shoulder.
They all changed into pajamas before laying around in Pansy’s room to eat their snacks, giggling and joking with each other. It had been such a great evening, no one wanted it to end, but since they had to catch the train in the morning, it had to. Greg walked Hermione to her room while Harry and Draco went to Harry’s. Ron hung back, saying he wanted to tell Pansy goodnight properly.
“Are we ready?” Draco asked, resting his head on Harry’s.
“Yea,” he nodded. “Draco found me just in time.”
He looked around the forest, which proved to be a bad idea because he started thinking of all the bad things that had happened to him in this very forest. The pressure of the past week and the memories that surfaced in the familiar surroundings were a bit too much for him and he soon regretted the fact that he was currently all alone. Tears formed in his eyes and he found himself struggling to get to his feet as his surroundings grew darker.
“I imagine that if she had known that we could cast spells with the swords, she wouldn’t have taught us how to use them,” Draco agreed. They lay together in silence for several moments before Draco asked, “Do we have an end goal in mind for this? I do enjoy it, but is there a reason we’re doing it?”
“Who knows why the ministry makes the choices they do,” Draco shrugged. “I’m not going to question it. I’m just planning on enjoying it.”
“You could always marry a Muggle girl that doesn’t know your past.”
Harry pulled at his tie as he paced the parlour. He stopped at the tables that were set up and adjusted the food trays before resuming his pacing. When he had done this around five times, strong hands gripped his shoulders, spinning him around.
“Did Ron come out?” Draco asked, looking around at the slowly emptying area.
“Oh, my goodness,” Pansy gasped. “What exactly were the two of you up to?”
As he topped the first flight of stairs, he thought he might faint. He was so winded and so much more tired than usual. He wanted to stop and catch his breath, but he could hear them coming. He had to keep moving. He didn’t know what he would do if anyone caught him.
“Lead the way,” Draco said and followed him up the stairs.
“You want children?” Draco was genuinely curious.
“You’re no help at all, do you know that?” Draco growled. Grabbing Harry around the waist, he flopped him onto his back in the middle of the bed and rolled on top of him. “I already have what I wanted for Christmas,” he said as he leaned in to kiss Harry. He was only able to get a brief peck on the lips before Harry pushed him up.
Draco seemed to think for a moment, taking Harry’s question seriously. “I don’t particularly need anything,” he shrugged after a few moments. “I like chocolate, good coffee, cakes, and sweets. Apples.” He glanced at Harry and shook his head. “None of that is really helpful is it?” he chuckled.
“I wish I could relax,” Potter sighed, scrubbing his hands over his face. “I think I’ve forgotten how.”
“Well, I have been spying on you since we were eleven,” he shrugged.
“If you had seen,” he shook his head and rubbed a hand over his face. “Last night, it wasn’t nothing that I saw.”
“You deserve to be celebrated,” Harry hugged her tightly for a moment. “You’re the youngest person to ever be appointed as the head of non-magical relations. Don’t be modest about it.”
“I don’t think I want to talk to the professor about it,” Harry said, sprawling out next to Draco. “I doubt she knows much more than us.”
“Yea, why not,” Ron shrugged. “It’s her money. If she wants to spend it, who am I to stop her?”
“No, he may be right,” Granger interrupted. “If anyone can get to Harry, it’s him. He’s never failed to provoke a response. It just might work.”
A strong hand stopped him before he could turn away. “I want to see you,” Malfoy said, his voice having gotten deeper and raspy. He laid him on his back and pressed between his legs. “Has your slick started leaking yet?” he asked as he pressed a finger against Harry’s asshole.
When he entered the living area, Malfoy was sitting on the sofa with a mug of coffee as he read. A smirk was the only response Harry got when he entered the room. Crossing to the kitchenette, he started looking through the few cabinets to find a mug. He jumped when an arm slid around his waist.
“You did have an alpha,” Malfoy said, his voice sounding a little dangerous. “I’ve known you were mine since I presented alpha. I know everyone thinks you’re oblivious, but even you had to notice that I’ve been keeping a closer proximity to you than usual.”
He continued down the path, finding another fork. He could hear fighting in one direction and it sounded close. Sticking to the treeline, he walked closer, crouching to hide in the bushes as he watched Ron and Theo Nott fight. ‘Theo should have chosen magic,’ Draco thought as he watched Ron easily overpower him. It was never a good decision to physically fight someone with five older brothers.
“You’re completely determined to keep me from reading, aren’t you?” Malfoy sighed as he stood and crossed the room. He stopped just in front of Harry, “Would you like to step aside or are you going to continue doing this odd impersonation of a door?” Harry glared up at him, but stepped to the side letting him pass. He went to one of the wardrobes and shuffled through his hangers. Turning he handed Harry a grey jumper and a pair of shorts. “You can borrow this for tonight.” He left the room giving Harry privacy to change.
Draco grabbed his wrists and held them over his head while using his hips to pin down Harry’s. “Stop fighting, you little monster,” Draco growled. Harry tried in vain to free himself, quickly realizing that Draco was physically strong enough to keep him in place. “Why do you have to be so difficult? We could be having breakfast. I haven’t even had my coffee yet.”
Harry opened his mouth to answer and a yawn slipped out before he could speak. He chuckled and shrugged, “Sorry. Tea would be nice, but I’d like to get some rest for tomorrow.”
When he moved under the blankets, Harry saw that he wasn’t wearing a shirt and the bed suddenly felt much smaller. He definitely needed some distance. “Scoot over,” he huffed, giving Malfoy a little shove.
“Honestly, I have no idea,” Potter shrugged. “I think maybe the drawing room and then the dining room. Those are the places that would be used the most often. Hermione and Ron helped me clean up a lot when…” he trailed off and glanced at Draco. “When we were hiding from Voldemort.” He shrugged again and shook his head as if to clear it. “Anyways, it’s pretty clean, but everything just looks so old and worn. You can tell that it was nice at one point, but it’s all faded and…”
“Yes,” she nodded. “I need to get a few books for Arithmancy and Transfiguration. I’m hoping to get a head start so I won’t be playing catch up after Christmas break.”
“Yea, I will,” she nodded and looked at her watch. “Oh, shit! I have to run or I’ll be late. I love you, take care, come see me,” she called over her shoulder as she ran out the door.
He checked his surroundings to make sure he wouldn’t be ambushed before checking the forked path McLaggen had been sniffing. He could smell Harry in both directions. One strong, the other very faint. He decided the stronger scent was too obvious and headed down the other path. He was walking slowly, checking the other scents in the area as he moved. Ron had been through here at some point, but his scent veered off into the trees. It was hard to track Harry’s scent because it seemed to be fading. Hermione must have taught him some camouflaging spells.
Draco grinned at him, “I like it, as well.” He stepped close to Harry and ran his thumb across Harry’s lips. Leaning forward, he kissed him gently. His lips barely ghosting across Harry’s before pulling away and leaving him wanting more. “Let’s get something to eat,” he chuckled as he took Harry’s hand and led him out into the corridor.
Narcissa gives some advice about how she would proceed.
“Pansy is used to traditional things,” Ron whined. “She’s going to hate it.”
Not backing away, Draco sneered down at him, “I might have if you had bothered to ask me.”
He gripped Harry’s hips and pulled him backwards, fucking him hard as Harry slumped forward, his moans muffled by his pillow. “Harder or slower?” Draco growled, barely hanging onto his control by a thin thread.
“I’ve already started investing money in different places since I was able to take control of the family vault,” Draco shrugged. “I do have a few other things I’m considering at the moment though.”
-------------------------------------A few hours later---------------------------------------
“I doubt it,” Harry sighed. “I have nightmares.”
“If she suspects anything, she won’t mention it,” Draco said. “She’s been avoiding set ups just as long as we have.”
Just as they were finishing up, Seamus and Dean stopped behind Harry. “So it’s true then,” Seamus spoke quickly. “You two are actually an item? It’s about damn time,” he laughed.
