"It's his signature move, not exactly a secret," Granger tosses over her shoulder. "Harry, don't forget about next Sunday. We're meeting at seven and you'll need to have it all sorted by then."
“On the contrary, I’ve hear Hangingbone’s eager to try again," says Theo. "Draco’s little misstep meant she couldn’t get a read on Potter. Holed herself up in her chambers the past two days, trying to figure out what went wrong. Personally, I suspect the whole ordeal is an attempt to get to him. Probe Potter's mind,” Theo muses. “As it were—”
Apparently muggles have fairy lights too, but he finds the name wildly misleading. There are no actual fairies involved like he’s used to, but multi-colored bulbs that blink, powered by something called electricity. Draco’s not sure how Professor Hangingbone’s managed to make any of it work at Hogwarts, but he suspects complicated charms work is involved.
“I’m close,” Draco rasps. He wants to take his prick out so he can get off properly. Even better, he wants Potter’s out — to feel the solid weight of his prick in his hand, to feel the precum dribble from the tip and slick it up, nice and wet with his fingers. To press the pad of his thumb into the slit the way Draco does when he’s alone. But there’s no time for that as Potter buries his head in Draco’s neck, and the feel of his soft lips, the hot puffs of air and the knowledge that Potter is just as turned on, that Draco is the one who’s made him so hard, is too much and the coil wound tight in his belly, snaps, hot and dizzying.
“Are you alright?” Potter rolls off of him into the snow, still panting as he turns his head to look at Draco.
"You know," says Romilda, "I should’ve known you had a thing for Wizards when you failed to invite me to the Slug Club."
A warm glow spilled from the sitting room out onto the floor, the fairy lights of the tree twinkling merrily in the twilight period just before sunrise. Harry stood, tall and glorious before the tree without a stitch of clothing on.
“..Sensitive?” Draco increases the pressure of his lips, teasing with little nips that he soothes with the pad of his tongue as Potter trembles. Moves his hand from Draco’s arm to his waist. The darkness of the room makes Draco feel braver as he pushes Potter back onto his bed and straddles his lap. Potter’s bites out a command and the curtains full shut around them, enclosing them in the space of Potter’s bed, as he bucks his hips up.
Gathering his courage, Draco stares up at the plaster ceiling. "Harry," he murmurs into the dimly lit room.
"I’ve never made you feel like anything other than what you already felt about yourself." Potter draws back with a sigh and Draco immediately feels the distance
Draco would much rather ignore the situation entirely. The idea that he has any kind of connection to Potter, especially after how miserable they’ve been making each other lately, feels like the icing on top of a perfectly
“Budge over, Potter.” Draco licks his lips as he removes his dress shoes and neatly slides them with one stockinged foot under the bed. He waits until he’s sitting on the bed to remove his robe, hoping the room is too dim to make the press against his zip noticeable.
Draco’s mouth pulls into a smile. He slides a hand onto Harry’s hip, resting his chin in the crook of his shoulder. “I think you forgot something.”
"Good?" asks Draco, focusing on the way Potter's adam's apple bobs when he swallows, faintly aware he's supposed to be checking for signs of sleeping draught.
"Your probation is almost over and these suppers are being presented as neutral ground. If I were expected to re-enter wizarding society and ferret my way into everyone's good graces, it would a good place to start."
Draco takes a shaky breath. Their lips barely brush, nothing like the last time they kissed, and yet he feels arousal shot through him, flooding his body head to toe with promising heat. "Stop," he breathes against Potter's lips, "I can't."
Professor Hangingbone’s classroom is located on the first floor in Classroom Eleven, a room Draco briefly remembers hearing Pansy mention in passing during fifth year, when she'd taken Divination with the exiled centaur from the Forbidden Forest. Years later, the room no longer resembled a mossy forest floor now, but a classroom not unlike those Draco’s seen in images of muggle primary schools: individual wooden desks, a large green chalkboard, and impressively, a telly attached to a steel arm in one corner of the ceiling that Hangingbone has rigged to work, despite the lack of electrical wiring within the castle.
"Really?" Finnigan's face is a mixture of disturbed and surprised. Draco considers whether he ought to feel insulted on behalf of his friend. While not beautiful in a conventional sense, Millicent exudes a confidence that makes her far more attractive than many of the girls Draco's ever known, romantically or otherwise. He'd once been tempted to express this idea to Pansy, but rightly judged that she'd take it as a personal slight. Blaise had unknowingly been the one to fall upon that particular sword and Pansy had returned to them two weeks later, not with a renewed sense of assurance, but a newfound appreciation of muggle rhinoplasty.
An image of the two professors scrambling after the bulbous shrooms flashes unbidden in Draco’s head, and he snorts, helpless. Ernie grins back, flipping his blond hair. “Can you imagine?”
Draco examines the spread before him with a critical eye. It'd been difficult to put together, even with the entire network of people he'd reached out to. Somehow he'd been able to track down more of those horrid frozen pizzas, using a strange telly box Chang said muggles were crazy about. Neville had helped him track down the ingredients used for Potter's favorite dessert, and strangely Weasley's mother, through Weasley, had shown him how to make it. In another twist of fate, it was Romilda Vane who'd helped him track down a box of crazy straws, and Lovegood who'd known just what to do with the information he'd sent her.
The few moments that she’s gone feel like an eternity as Draco grips his satchel, entirely too conscious of his posture and his surroundings.
“So, err, have you asked for anything special this year?” Potter pauses near the entrance to Honeydukes as they pass, and they both take a moment to breath in the warm vanilla scent of sweets and toffee as it wafts towards them.
"I'd like to speak for myself, if I may." Harry says roughly, the drink in his hand heavy with condensation. "And I don't think it's really anyone's business since I'm not seeing anyone right now. Can we stop talking about my love life now? Please?"
Potter softly clears his throat, "Karrey, could you bring us something to drink, please? Draco likes apples. Perhaps you can make something?"
“Fucking hell!” Weasley howls. He grips an arse cheek in one hand and fumbles for his wand with the other. Draco hand goes to his thigh.
“Well whatever the case," Harry says, "we'd rather be on her good side. We still need to talk to her about the curse and she won’t stop looking at you.”
A quick pat to his head assures Draco that his hair is just as artfully tousled as he intended it to be. Potter had seemed fond enough of it last night. “Bite your tongue, I look as immaculate as ever. Just because no one’s ever taught you a grooming charm.”
“You’re already touching me,” Potter breathes, amused.  “You don’t have to ask, Malfoy. I want it. I want to watch you do it.”
“Are we back on speaking terms already?” His deep baritone makes the words ooze like honey, slow moving and heavy with intent. “I thought I had until New Years at least, for one of us to issue a formal apology.”
“How enterprising of her,” Draco muses as he ties his skates. As far as he’s concerned, Anthony Goldstein is the most oblivious wizard
"Be well, Draco," Lovegood says, darting forward for a quick hug. Blaise grabs a handful of floo powder off the mantle and throws it into the fire. "Ministry of Magic, Head Auror Gawain Robards office."
“Or them,” Theo says through a mouthful of eggs, directing his gaze at the miniature fleet of reindeer Professor Flickwick has charmed to soar above their heads, sleigh bells jingling merrily. “I think Peeves considers them competition. Who can spread the most cheer.”
Slipping it into his pocket, Draco doesn’t bother to answer, tearing into the envelope to remove the slip of parchment folded neatly in two. His eyes race over the page, his mother’s handwriting feminine and precise as she expresses her surprise at the contents of the morning’s paper, as well as Draco’s failure to bring any of it to her attention. He exhales through his nose, draws another shaky breath. He’d expected as much.
Hangingbone takes another step closer this time and Draco startles to realize he doesn’t have enough room to take anymore back, unless he plans to jump into the water. It’s not a terrible plan; he’s a decent enough swimmer after many summers on the beaches of France. But the water tonight is black and angry. He’s seen enough of their depth from the other side of the dungeon’s thick glass and understands why Potter had to face it to become a Triwizard champion.
“Um, is everything alright?” Ernie looks uncertain as his eyes dart between them, lowering his arm. “I thought it was a little strange you two were together, but if you’re making a go at friendship, we should try to enjoy the game, yeah?”
"Auror training must keep you busy, Harry." This comes from Boot, finally pulling himself away from Draco's side to say goodbye to the rest of their companions. "Have you found another flat?"
From the depths of the bag she removes a red velvet cap trimmed with fur and topped with a fluffy pom. “Here we are!”
"I never made you feel like a peasant, Draco." The use of his name leaves Draco momentarily stunned, his mouth moving stupidly, gaping, as he tries to find words to brandish against the assault.
It seems to happen in slow-motion. A branch in a neighboring tree, directly over Blaise’s head comes loose. Draco barely has time to open his mouth when Potter, quick as a flash, lashes his wand at the branch and it explodes into a shower of wood chips and splinters.
“Oh?” Harry doesn’t start, just melts into him as he relaxes his stance. Draco brings his other hand around, bringing the red hat it’s white trim into Harry’s field of vision.
Fuck. Dark and lean, Potter looks positively edible. Doing his best to stay on track, Draco nods. “I’ve been thinking about our situation. How going out of our way to be nice to each other hasn’t changed the effects.”
Carefully Draco slips his shoes off and puts his bag down. He’s shrunk the presents and slipped them inside for safekeeping, a cushioning charm on Blaise’s records so that they don’t bend. Draco can feel the weight of Potter’s gaze as he approaches the bed. Wipes his damp palms on his expensive slim-fit trousers. Feels his cock twitch.
it is, goes both ways, Potter make have some insight into Draco’s thoughts that he’d rather he not, at all.
“Crisis?” Potter reels back. “I’d thank you not to assume things just because Gin and I have broken up and you and I have been-- been getting along.” His eyes move uncertainly to Hagrid who doesn’t seem to pick up on what Potter’s not saying, the way Draco does.
“No one blames you, darling,” Pansy lowers her voice, darting her eyes towards the other end of the table. Draco cranes his neck to follows her gaze.
“Yeah.” Harry tilts his head, thoughtfully. There are smudges on the lens of his glasses. “Besides, something tells me it’ll be much more entertaining if I stay here. I’m sure Parkinson has read the article by now.”
Keeping his chin raised, Draco sets his shoulders and wills himself not to quake. “I’m looking for Potter.”
“What is it McGonagall’s always going on about? Inter-house cooperation?” Draco agrees, grateful for Granger’s tactful assist. “If Potter’s finally come around to my glowing personality and insists on befriending me, I suppose I’ll have to be a good sport about it.”
Potter speaks suddenly from behind Draco. He hadn't even noticed his approach. "I didn't know you liked flowers."
"Here." Harry hands him a glass of something cool and slushy that looks like a sunset. A thin plastic tube is set inside, curling and bending in several loops, almost as tall as the glass itself. Harry lifts his own almost identical drink to his mouth, hollows his cheeks and sucks.
“Don’t talk to her like that,” Potter snaps. His dark curls fall across his forehead as he whips his head around.
With a shaky breath, Draco opens his eyes. He isn’t aware he’d even shut them until now. Around the circle, everyone stares back, looking, if possible, even more expectant than when he’d began.
Jaw clenched, Draco hoists himself up, swinging his legs over the side of the bin to jump down "Hello, Lovegood."
“Just until Hangingbone gets back,” Potter murmurs, his voice thick. He stares at Draco from under impossibly long lashes and this close up, his eyes smolder. There’s a dull roar in Draco’s ears, the anticipation stuttering his breath as Potter’s hand slides over his waist, digs into the flesh of his side.
Just because they share the sentiment doesn’t mean Draco has to tell him as much. “So no cause of the week? You’re usually self-righteous about something.”
“Move along, Potter,” Draco sighs, suddenly as tired as he looks. “Surely you have better places to stick you nose than up my arse.”
Lately it feels like he can’t tell if any of his feelings or subsequent moods are his own. After fleeing the stationary store, Draco hadn’t bothered to make any of his other stops except
"Hilarious," Draco mutters, and takes a sip from his water glass to have something to do with his hands.
,’ but they would take a few days to develop, which was fine. Draco certainly didn’t need a photo to remember how the Harry’s rough whiskers had felt against his skin when they’d kissed goodnight at the bottom of the dungeon stairs. And Draco had recalled them again, with great accuracy, later that night, when he’d brought himself off to the thought of that same stubble burn marking the inside of his thighs.
Draco and Ernie both start. The movement startles a squirrel on the trunk of the tree nearest them. Harry’s behind their bench, hands in the pocket of his robes. Saying he looks displeased would be an understatement.
"Don't make fun of him Pansy, I imagine Draco thinks himself a martyr." Theo rubs Persephone’s muzzle affectionately one final time, before leaving her to graze freely, strolling over to seat himself on the end of Pansy’s chair. "He’s finally braving the outside world. Something we’ve all had to do, mind you, without the most influential wizard in the world personally pleading on our behalf."
Draco shakes his head. “I don’t think we need it anymore.” He allows himself to shook Harry a knowing smirk. “You’re so transparent, I can read you like a book.”
“Then spend the hols with Harry. He has a place to himself, doesn’t he?” Ernie bites at a hangnail on his pinky as Draco makes a face. “I don’t mean for
“A Santa hat?” Dean Thomas asks incredulously. A few students turn to blink at him, then Hangingbone, seeking confirmation.
Draco stalks back to the plot of dirt he'd left overturned. He picks up his trowel and thrusts it into the soil with unnecessary force, relishing in the minor violence. He can’t exactly blame any of them for any of this, he knows, but the knowledge doesn’t do much against quelling the urge.
It’s just like Potter to make a scene because he can’t control his temper like a normal person. If the worse he’s managed is a scratch on his face or a bruised ego, Draco thinks smugly, then it serves the git right.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco snaps, feeling his face heat. Beside him, Potter leans forward.
dragged his name through the mud. Draco couldn’t begin to imagine the looks of shock he’d receive if he donned the hat and ended up on the good side of things.
That left one empty bed in which the three of them used as a catch all — games of exploding snap, laying out clothes, even the occasional pillow fort, which was a fact sworn to secrecy and never to leave the room.
The first week of July brings with it the third gathering of Squill & Spoon. Draco apparates into the middle of a clearing-- the grass is high and springy, coming up to his knees. The evening air smells fresh and the sun is on the horizon, painting the sky a brilliant orange. A sense of calm suddenly comes over Draco, despite the isolation of the current location, and he closes his eyes, feeling the sun on his face. The arrival of another person is brought on by a shift in the air. His eyes track across the expanse, looking for the source, spotting Blaise Zabini heading on a rather direct course across the grass his way.
"Says you," Pansy says, leaning over the side of her deck chair. "Mind healing is a form of treatment, Draco. Meditation. Counseling. All things you’ve done because the Ministry led you to believe it would help your case." She pulls her shades off entirely, mouth pinched. "And now these dinners?"
Draco rolls his eyes at the comment, and almost misses the way Lovegood shakes her head. "Ron's your best friend, Harry. They can’t place you together all the time. The point is to get to know new people."
His head whips around, eyes bugged behind the lens of his hideous glasses as Potter cranes his neck to look up at him. “How did you get in here??” He leans his torso around Draco to check the door behind him. Like he’s invited everyone in his house to accompany him. The memory of the cabinets prickles uncomfortably in his memory, and Potter’s agitation hits him.
Draco feels his face burn. He wouldn't say miserable, thank you so. That's a bit much even from Granger.
A low, rough, voice surprises him. “Has he died in there?” Theo sounds as if the idea tickles him immensely. “Draco Malfoy,” he intones gravely, “if you’ve passed to the other side,
to,” Parvati corrects, her olive skin flushing prettily. “Padma hasn’t decided what she wants to do and it’s likely to be our only chance to see each other now that she’s on the continent.”
“Being nasty to each other hasn’t particularly gotten us anywhere either,” Potter says. “Even before the curse.”
Draco shakes his head. "So I’m another of your sycophants, am I? Lord Potter, reigning over Wizarding Britain like the King of everything while us peasants fall to our knees and lick your boots."
"Spoken just like a Squib." Malfoy walked the length of the room, his Chimera-lined boots erasing each footprint as he went. "You said the others are on their way?"
Despite her understanding and her warnings, there’s nothing that really prepares them for the reaction of their friends.
“Cheers. I always said Potter was a man of taste,” Theo tells the room at large, only looking up a moment from the game of Exploding Snap he’s playing with Daphne Greengrass. “Just because Father Christmas has a beard the size of Greenland doesn’t mean the rest of us have to.”
repeats, roused from his thoughts. He takes a good look around. Sometime during his tangent, Potter spelled the bed-hangings shut.
“Thank you Potter for repeating exactly what I said right back to me,” Draco scoffs. “Is your animagus a parrot?” The withering look Potter gives him makes Draco smirk. “I just mean,” he continues, “that we’ve been looking at things in terms of black and white. Maybe we should be examining the gray area.”
"You’re the one who asked." Right now, Draco doesn’t mind the comparison to Granger. It’s reassuring to have some confirmation that he hasn’t completely lost his mind. "Wasn’t it your idea to be open-minded?"
?’ Others have been asking you see, and I’d like to have an official statement prepared.” Blaise continues to give them his most charming smile, but Draco can hear the seriousness that underlies his words.
"At first I thought it may not have reached you. So I wrote another. And another. But I--" Draco wants to throttle himself for how idiotic he's being. "I just thought if you'd gotten them, you would have written back."
"No one informed me of that." If they had, Draco thinks resentfully, he probably wouldn't have come. He's only just gotten his wand back, a fact Potter is certainly well aware of. "Why wasn't it on the invitation?"
"We're in a garden, with bees. And we're eating little finger sandwiches full of honey which are basically their life blood."
"It doesn’t have to make sense. Nothing involving you ever does." Draco throws him a haughty look. "That’s how I know that I’m right."
with Father Christmas,” Draco begins, careful to staunch his sarcasm. “I notice you’ve brought the hat with you." Hangingbone glances down at it, the thin hand bracing her desk curling into a fist. "If you don’t mind, I’d like to try again. I think there’s may have been something wrong with it the first time.”
"I wasn't spying on you!" Harry shouts back, sitting up. "Everything isn't always about you, believe it or not! Have you ever considered that
“But she’s bringing the hat?” Draco leaps down from the alcove’s raised bench to shrug his robes back on, hurriedly threading one arm, then the other through the sleeves while grabbing for his bag.
"Of course my dear," Blaise says smoothly, and it doesn't sound as even half as patronizing as it should. "Right after we straighten Draco out."
As if he can hear him, Harry pulls off and sits back on his haunches, chest rising and falling. Sweat slick hair stick to his forehead, his lips deliciously plump like Draco's cock is all he could ever want.
“Don’t phrase it like that,” Potter grouses, his chin in hand. A few yards away, someone has built a snowman, the snow packed unevenly making him lop-sided. Potter swishes his wand and the carrot moves from the center of it’s face to the top of it’s head, like a unicorn.
“The only charms work you’ve planned is Anthony Goldstein,” sniffs Draco, curling his lip. “I hardly think that’s worth half a bottle of
Draco holds up his hands, palms out in deference. Ugh. The things he has to do sometimes. “Believe me Potter, I wouldn’t step foot into this
Draco nods. "Yes, you see, Harry doesn't mind if the house elves are out to poison anyone, so long as it's not him."
Draco blinks. Disappoint wells up within him like he’s submerged himself in the lake. He doesn’t understand. He was so sure that his theory was right.
The problem with Slytherins, Draco muses as he queues inside Sugarplum’s Sweets a few minutes later, is that they’re too adept at reading other people—particularly other Slytherins. Not a flaw in itself, but it’s terribly hard to resist pressing an advantage once it’s been spotted. It’s also hard not to take the bait when the payoff is something as arbitrary as baked goods. Feisty old Opal’s adherence to house customs is adorably archaic. He probably would have brought her sweets anyway, if he could move freely, just for the amusement of rousing her suspicions. The real inconvenience of the exchange was having to stand in line.
"Not quite." Draco produces a handsome flask from inside his blazer pocket and flexes his wrist. The contents inside don’t make a single sound, filled to the brim as it is.
"I'm a very giving person, Harry. You'd know that if you took the time. Those Potter Stinks badges weren't cheap."
? But Harry can throw that off! I’ve seen him do it.” There’s a note of pride in Weasley’s voice as if it wasn’t Potter but
The sky remains a stark, grey, backdrop as the players zip through the sky in their yellow jerseys, like bees in a hive. Draco glances for a seat, the corner of his mouth ticking up when Ernie spots him from high in the bleachers and motions with a friendly wave.
“Oh I think we all know who Malfoy is referring to,” Blaise drawls, somehow both mocking and fond. “He’s only been glancing at this table every five minutes.”
"Which suits you fine enough, since you’re too cowardly to do anything but play games! You assume everyone else is too. I wasn’t trying to lie to you!"
“My hand slipped,” Potter starts to explain, raising his chin. But Malfoy’s not going to play that game.
Draco blinks down at his knees. He wants to go back to the fun playful way they’d spoken to each other before. It was just a few minutes ago and now it feels like hours. Days. Would every conversation they tried to have eventually spiral into something like this? Good intentions dissipating like smoke and revealing a chasm too daunting to build a bridge across?
Draco’s fingers slide under his shirt to stroke the hard muscle of Potter’s stomach that clenches at his touch, breathless when Potter pulls him down on top of him. Draco straddles Potter’s leg, ruts his hip so that Potter can feel the swell of his prick, hard and insistent against his thigh.
“Why not use your wand?” Potter asks, pushy as ever. He doesn’t appear surprised in the slightest to see Draco cast without one, despite asking. “The new one,” he clarifies like a total berk.
A reward? A threat? Draco’s not sure what to make of it. If his mother’s sent it to him, surely his father would know, and if his father’s heard what’s going on despite an entire ocean situated between them, Draco has a lot more to process than whether or not he plans to have the loss of his virginity forced upon him by his parents of all people. “Just something she thinks will be helpful.”
“And why,” Draco asks, with what he knows is a near perfect impression of Narcissa Malfoy’s icy distain, “would you think I have any interest in something like this?”
Draco nods. He can feel it too. His magic crackles like static electricity, making the fine hair of his arms stand on end, even beneath the sleeves his turtleneck. “That’s because you haven’t done anything more productive than fix your hair in a store window.” He reaches up to pat Potter’s curls for emphasis, lingering just a little before letting go. They’re in public, after all. “It’ll never work, give up.”
Draco scowls, applying more pressure. He ought to have recalibrated the damned thing weeks ago, but that meant a trip into Diagon Alley, and as far as he was concerned, Diagon Alley remained off-limits.
“You’ve just missed Anders pass the bludger to Wilson. Wilson, clever lad that he is, hit it through his own team’s goal.”
Touching his wand to the stone wall, the craggy rocks slides back to reveal the entrance to the common room. They aren’t even through the hole before a loud BANG! Causes Draco to stumble back into Harry as silver and green confetti rains down on them. Draco looks around in utter confusion.
Draco turns onto his side and snuggles into his pillows, already feeling sleep settle over him, pulling at him down into its depths. “Clean yourself up,” he mumbles as his eyes close. “And don’t get caught.”
"But I’ve suspected for a while now and have only just confirmed it. Karrey, in particular, but the others too— no, don’t look!" Draco snatches Potter’s chin. The rasp of stubble lingers on his fingers when he releases it. Potter hasn't shaved today. "Are you mad? You can’t let on that you know! Then they’ll know that I know."
The light is faint down here, just a few torches set into the walls. Their flames reflect on the dark water and cast strange shadows across her face. Still, Draco can see that’s she’s still drawn and pale compared to how healthy she’d looked earlier in the term, so enthused about her lessons and Christmas traditions.
"You lack emotional resonance?" Theo finishes for her, never failing to slip a knife between Draco’s ribs when presented with the opportunity.
Draco bites his cheek. Trust Pansy to withhold that pertinent piece of information from no one but him. Draco had indeed had lunch with in the Ministry Atrium with Terry Boot after he'd cornered Draco coming out of his Mind Healer's office. Boot had even talked his Auror detail into sitting at another table where they'd be well within his eye line. When Draco had risen to leave, Boot pulled him into an alcove and kissed him, a tepid experience that left Draco feeling as if he'd dragged slimy murtlap tentacles across his mouth.
“Enjoy your drink!” he shouts, and turns to follow Madam Pomfrey as she levitates Ernie off the pitch.
Draco feels something inside him wither. "Right." He steps around Potter and stalks away, ignoring the way Opal tries to flag him down. He's almost to the elevator when his arm is yanked back.
The next dish arrives and it’s a succulent white fish topped with a white wine reduction and fresh greens on the side. The fish is perfectly cooked, flaky and moist when he pares it with his fork. It’s even better when he tastes it, melting like butter on his tongue.
Draco swallows hard. He wasn't sure what he expected, but he'd be lying if he said he didn't feel pleasantly surprised. Draco doesn't even mind that Harry's speaking for both of them, because it's a perfect reflection of his own feelings. He probably couldn't speak now anyway, with how his heart is racing. When Harry subtly rests his hand on Draco's thigh, Draco realizes that Harry must be feeling just as amazed as Draco by his own daring.
“Do you miss it?” Harry asks. He’s leading them up the staircase that will connects to the fourth floor, where they can take the nearest flight of stairs to the Prefects bathroom.
“Done something,” Potter repeats, eyebrows raised. He huffs loudly, taken back. “You’re out of your mind.”
"Mr. Draco, Miss Luna." He rises, blinking his large brown eyes. "Karrey is to be taking your wands, please."
“Yeah, Malfoy,” adds another boy with a slight overbite. “Get out of here before we tell the Headmistress!”
Ernie shrugs. “No one knows. It basically disintegrated on top of Harry’s head. Hangingbone suspects it has something to do with his magic signature. He got upset and it went haywire. No one’s seen him since.”
Draco bites his lip as he climbs to his feet. Behind him, he can hear Hangingbone continuing to thump and flail as he holds out his hand to help Harry up. “And I just wanted to say,” Draco says, tightening his grip on the warmth of Potter as he levers his weight, “Is I hope you know a good drying charm.”
“It was only supposed to be you, Draco.” Hangingbone steps closer, and he takes a step back. “The Sorting Hat reads emotions, but it uses magical energy to do it. Stores it up. That’s why Father Christmas can check his list — he has so much joy and peace stored up, it wouldn’t be a drain to his body.”
The day is flat and grey outside, making the horizon hard to distinguish between the snow and the sky as he crosses the courtyard. He’d been to the Owlery to send a letter off to his mother, since she’s being unusually stubborn. Stopped by the kitchens for some biscuits, and all manner of meaningless errands to put off the inevitable. He needs to talk to Potter and for once, he doesn’t want to do it while the entire school is watching.
"Pureblood homes are always built on land rich in magical attributes," He tries not to take Harry’s confused expression as a personal offense. "There’s enough nutrients in the grounds of Malfoy Manor to replicate the Forbidden Forest if we wanted." Draco shakes his head. "As it were, we’ve been selling what we grow as a way to recoup some of our losses."
Ernie throws an arm around Draco’s shoulder, pulling him in as he pumps his other fist. “Yeah! I knew they’d do it! We’re going to crush Gryffindor next week!”
"He didn't have to," Blaise scoffs. "Do you have any idea how obvious either of you are? I saw your faces when you got out of that carriage. Your hair was a mess and Potter looked like a sad crup. I asked around and Luna confirmed he's been pouting all week. Like you!"
“How about, how did you sleep last night?” Malfoy bites the inside of cheek, doing his best to sound casual as he keeps his eyes forward.
Draco casts her a sideways glance, entirely sure nothing good can come of her casual tone. "Did she? I’m sure it was a glowing review. Don’t leave out any of the interesting bits."
"You asked?" Draco vaguely registers that they're heading towards the corridor that leads down to the seventh-floor. He stops short. "Where are we going?"
“Sex is a grey area, Malfoy. Think about it: it can be naughty and it can be nice all at once. It’s a way for people to communicate physically. It’s enjoyable?” Potter lists his points with growing fervor. “It could be a way to curb the need for satisfaction we feel when the curse flairs up!”
"Are you? You look a bit peaky." Pansy nods to Karrey when he appears and begins heaping scrambled eggs onto their plates.
“And how about you, Draco?” Blaise asks, as if he and everyone else at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Misery couldn’t already guess. “Any plans yet? I hear traveling alone can be quite rewarding. Sailing, perhaps. There’s one island in particular I know you’d just
"Are you asking me if the house elves are targeting former Slytherins by poisoning their food?" Potter's eyes narrow, and Draco has a fleeting thought of Dobby. Of course the thought would make him angry if he thought it were a serious one.
“It was that or hiding out in Gryffindor Tower with Potter.” Pansy stands to her feet, throwing her bushy beard over her shoulder to keep it out of her drink. “I was
Draco flushes from the base of his neck to the tip of his ears. Was he imagining it or was Potter flirting with him? “That not possible,” Draco leans forward so that a lock of pale hair fall into his eyes. He bites his lip. “The Headmistress bought all the mattresses wholesale for a reduced price.”
Draco draws a sharp breath just as Abernathy appears to collect him. The moment gone, Draco spins on his heel, heading in the other direction. His stomach swoops unpleasantly.
The thought of stroked egos makes Draco think of other things. He subtly rearranges himself, spreading his napkin over his lap. His shoulder bumps into Potter, and Potter turns to smile at Draco, bumping him back. Weasley distracts Potter’s attentions away with a tray of bacon; Draco silently curls his fingers into fists under the table, inhaling through his nose.
Reaching down, Draco slips his wand from his holster and spells himself clean. Rolls his neck and feels the bones click. “Well, Potter,” Draco purrs. “I assume you can find your own way back?”
The old man steps back. If he looked alarmed before, he’s positively frightened now. Frantically he paws beneath the counter. Draco’s certain he’s searching for his wand. “I don’t know what you’re up to, but I’ve had just about enough!”
“N-no!” Draco howls, his knees buckling. “I’m— I need to buy —hehehe!” Shaking his head, Draco reaches for the bag of goods, dragging it as he falls to the floor. Lying on his side, Draco reaches shakily into his robes, down now to hiccuping snorts, to produce his money pouch.
He’s also grown use to the way people grow quiet when he enters a space. At least this time Potter is suffering the same. It must be strange, after the news of their Muggle Studies brawl spread around the school, to see the two them walking side by side, voluntarily in each other’s presence with no wands drawn.
Draco can feel the anchor of sleep pulling him down, down. There’s something about a hard won happiness that works as strong as a sleeping draught. Giving in, Draco nods, his eyes closed. Even Christmas Eve with a gaggle of redheads doesn’t seem as daunting. Idly he wonders when Harry’s mattress became so soft. “Yes,” Draco sighs happily and doesn’t even get the
he’s ever met, after Potter. He pulls his laces tighter and makes a concentrated effort not to watch the dark head as it circles the ice. “Apparently the helpless damsel routine hasn’t lost its touch.”
Headland spells the jellybeans into his wastebasket. "Of course it is, Draco," he says, exasperated. "Anyone can be nasty. it doesn't require any effort, just ignorance."
“I said I know,” Potter laughs, the berk. “I really don’t mind if you think I’m a freak Draco.  You’re one too. I’m starting to like it.”
“I didn’t know you were a fan,” Potter’s face lights up like the tree behind him and Draco feels his breath catch. He looks from Potter’s face back down to the album, flustered as heat rises in his face.
He’s absolutely not, but Draco jerks his head anyway, squeezing his eyes shut against a guffaw. Puffs of air hit his palm, making a squelching noise that sounds suspiciously like he’s made wind. Scrivenshaft leans forward.
There's a loud crack and Karrey appears with a tray of drinks, taking the mention of ice-breaking quite literally: the glasses are brimming with crushed ice and a mixture of pineapple, ginger, and lime. He reaches for his glass as it’s placed in front of him, and noting everyone doing the same, he takes a sip. The tartness bursts on his tongue, sweet and refreshing.
“I see. You might like them, as far as muggle groups go. They’re very catchy.” Potter smiles at him, a true heartstopping smile that Draco suspects might actually be the death of him if he manages to survive the afternoon. “You’re definitely a Posh.”
“Malfoy!” Potter sounds breathless, his arms full of paper and bows as he rounds the corner with Ginny, Weasley, and Granger in tow. “Sorry, we got caught up talking about some stuff. Over here.” He leads them towards the squishy sofa and low table in front of the fireplace. It’s occupied by two second years girls who depart without a word at Potter’s arrival, one grateful smile from him enough to send them giggling to the other side of the room. Draco drops his bag onto the table with a thud.
"Get out of here Malfoy." Ron shakes his heads. "Next time I promise to ignore you and we'll call it a day."
He’s grateful when the plates of hot, delicious food appears in front of them on the table. He tucks in, relieved to concentrate on something else.
"If it helps, I don’t hate Weasley anymore," Draco says, rather dryly. "He's actually a bit of a laugh once he's got a drink in him. But we're never going to be best mates, you know that. After I wrote those letters, met with all those people... well, I never thought it would be easy, but I didn't exactly think it would be this hard either." He lies back, tucking his hands under one of Harry's fluffy pillows. Harry says nothing, settling back to watch Draco's face. "I'm trying."
"Is that so? I mean, when I ran into you the other day, you were coming down the corridor on level three. And what’s up there? I mean, I know the Mind Healers and such, but why would you be there?"
“Perhaps it’s why you’re so fair. Hermione suspected there might be Veelas in your family, but I didn’t think there were any--” Potter stops short as a stately looking Eagle owl soars towards them, its wings extended as it enters a smooth glide. Even after so long, Draco recognizes his mother’s owl Bellero instantly and while his stomach swoops at the thought of what could possibly be in the envelope she clutches, he’s more relieved to know his mother has finally broken their silent standoff.
Potter nods. “You were an asshole, Malfoy. You were a coward, a bigot, and a bully, who made a lot of bad decisions that you weren’t forced into and you realize it until you were in too deep to get out.” Draco watches Potter’s eyes, green as glass, as he searches Draco’s face. “But you’ve made a lot of decisions I never expected either. Ones that cost you something. Ones you still don’t think anyone notices.”
Draco shakes his head. He doesn’t know what any of that has to do with him. His face must say as much. Hangingbone continues. “Do you remember what I said that day, Draco? I passed the hat around and I told you all to think of strong,
Draco fling the door to Abernathy's office open and almost collides into Harry Potter, who jumps back as if he's seen a ghost. The color drains from his face as he looks at him, eyes wide. "Draco."
“Oh yeah,” Ernie lilts. “With your mum. She told me to let you know that you’re staying home for the hols, and I forgot. Sorry mate. But we’ll have a good view of Uranus from up there.”
"He's exaggerating. As usual." Draco rolls his eyes. "Pansy says she saw you having lunch with some mystery man just this week."
"I've been talking to quite a lot of people. Theo, sure. Ran into Finnigan at the bar and he had some pleasant words to say about you, not that he remembers much about the night. My connections in Headland's office Geminio'd some files that made for a very interesting nighttime read."
“They’re much more temperamental.” The words are out before Draco can catch them. “That is to say,” he clears his throat, “That we can at least control our thoughts. Emotions just overtake you sometimes. Feeling angry doesn’t make you an angry person.”
Potter rolls his eyes, but carves a small piece all the same and brings it to his mouth. The fork slides between his lips and his head tips back, eyes fluttering as they slide closed.
On Sunday Morning in the Village of Hogsmeade, witnesses report that young hero and defeater of Voldemort, Harry James Potter, was seen Christmas shopping with none other than son of convicted Death Eater and heir to the Malfoy fortune, Draco Malfoy. According to witnesses, the two appeared to be very close, canoodling shamelessly and engaging in all sorts of public displays that are too graphic in nature to be reported at this time.
Draco emerges from the bedroom to check around the doorway. Peer down the empty hallway. He could have sworn he’d left Harry asleep under the covers.
“He touched the hat before you put it on,” Hangingbone snaps, her face twisted in a nasty scowl. “Which wouldn’t have meant anything if you two weren’t already connected. It severed the the load. Made him take on half of it!” Spittle flies from her mouth as she becomes more agitated. “I thought I could reverse it if I made him put it on, but then
His hand shoots up almost immediately. Around him, his classmates turn to look, and even the sensation of their eyes boring into him doesn’t serve to make him hesitate. “Professor!”
Mean laughter breaks out across the table as Draco ignores it. Madam Pince will swoop down on them soon enough. The thought of cancelled plans and holidays spent alone aren’t all that funny to him at the moment.
“Malfoy…” Potter’s hands pull his hips down, holds Draco in place as he rocks up, in search of friction. The hard line of Potter’s erection drags along Draco’s leg, the shape of it alone making him salivate. A warm hand moves under Draco’s jumper to splay over his back, down the back of his trousers to grope and squeeze his arse. Draco keens, angling down so that his prick thrusts against Potter again and again.
“Draco!” Pansy falls to her knees in the snow, strands of dark hair stuck to her face like she’d just been running.
“In one! Though we must call him ‘Father Christmas’ Mr. Thomas, as it’s the proper term in our region.
"Potter has shown up twice now. It could be a coincidence, but given your history, and who both of you are, you'd have to be naive to think so. I’ve been looking into who's behind this Supper Club, and have also asked a few people help me dig further. So just," Theo makes a face of utter disgust, "be careful."
The blue-haired reception-witch doesn’t look up when Draco reaches her desk. He clears his throat. He watches her shuffle through some papers and sharpen a quill. When she continues to ignore him, he casually tips the inkwell sitting precariously on the edge of her desk, spilling its contents across the official-looking document she’s currently reading. Her head snaps up.
Unlike the Sorting Hat of their first year, there’s no whispering voice inside Draco’s head. What there is, is a pouring warmth, followed by a cooling sensation -- like being submerged in an icy bath or the icy brush of Dementors robes.
Draco snorts. "I'll bet! Does it mean more to you that they're happy as long as I'm miserable?" Draco swipes a small bowl of Bertie Bott's
"Like your newfound love of pizza?" Pansy turns onto her side. "Or the fact that you’ve failed to mention the most interesting part of your night?"
Draco goes still. Maybe? It is almost Potter’s birthday. Certainly friends celebrate those types of occasions together. And if he can’t move freely, it doesn’t mean that Potter can’t. He’s allowed to break all kinds of rules. In his pocket, Draco fingers the gold watch.
Draco exhales, slowly. He’d been so caught up in chasing his own pleasure, he/’d completely missed it. He’s strangely disappointed, but Potter’s wash of satisfaction — and the damp spot on the front of his trousers — doesn’t allow the feeling to linger. And while the sensation of cooling spunk should be unpleasant, Draco’s chuffed to know he lasted longer. The whole affair couldn’t have taken more than a few minutes at best, but as he rolled off of Potter, Draco felt floaty, languid, and at peace in a way he hadn’t felt in days, if not
"Mmm," Draco murmurs noncommittally. Personally he feels there’s nothing wrong with maintaining some traditions; the post-war climate seemed to breed a new brand of overcompensation. Traditions could be good as long as they weren’t hurting anyone. "I’m not used to being around you like this." He extends the admission like an olive branch. "You know. Nice."
“We were wondering if we’d have to go looking for you,” Theo calls from his seat in front of the fire. “Pansy put ten galleons on you sulking in that alcove you like so much.”
He glances once more around the circle. All eyes were on him, even Hangingbone’s. They’re slightly manic and he feels hunted as he puts the cap on.
"I may have spent one year following you around Hogwarts, but that doesn’t discredit the fact that you spent five of them following me."
“Funny you should say that.” Draco waits for Harry to elaborate but he doesn’t, just turns back to the front as Hangingbone begins the day’s lesson. Draco sighs and starts on his apology letter. There’s only a few more days before hols. If  he and Harry going to get the situation sorted before then, it seems like the most practical place to start.
Draco grabs Harry's wrist and pulls it towards his aching cock. A few strokes and he’s spilling over Harry’s fingers, thick strips, and Draco wants to cry, he’s so grateful for release.
Blaise smiles. "If we're honest, I've forgotten what I ate for breakfast last Tuesday. I could hardly be bothered to keep track of Draco's every move at Hogwarts. That requires true dedication and I'm too selfish for that."
“Which is better than the alternative,” Potter says quickly when Hermione’s lips tighten. “Professor Hangingbone isn’t here, so there’s no point going to McGonagall until she’s back, because she’s the one who charmed the hat. And if we tell anyone else, the others will think Malfoy’s done it on purpose.”
The skeptical look he receives is not completely unwarranted. "This is starting to become a habit with you."
Auror Abernathy fails to make an appearance on Wednesday for Draco's weekly mind healer appointment, which doesn't much surprise Draco, but clearly comes as one to
Scrivenshaft stands behind him, bent over his cane as his eyes dart to the pockets of Draco’s robes. He fights not to roll his eyes. Three years ago his father would have purchased this entire store if Draco asked, and used the space to store his dress shoes. It would be nothing to give this older wizard a dressing down to which he would never recover and, for a moment, he misses being the Draco who had the freedom to do so.
"Hullo, Blaise. Draco." Cho Chang is wearing a red summer dress, her dark hair pulled back at the nape of her neck. It's simple, but elegant. He supposes she looks beautiful if you like that sort of thing. Draco scowls as his eyes dart once more to the fountain.
“He says he’s not coming out,” Parvati answers, sounding far more used to his moods than their brief period of tentative friendship would belie. Her delivery is flippant, and Draco imagines she’s more annoyed with him than anything else, standing in the middle of the fifth floor hallway while her schoolbag digs into her shoulder.
It’s hard not to just stand and admire someone like Harry Potter. Even with the frown and the slight slouch as he buries his hands in his pockets, Potter cuts a striking figure. It’s not just his dark hair and bright eyes - it’s his broad shoulders, the dip of his waist, the way his denim hugs the curve of his arse just right -- he seems to exude a brooding confidence, a strength, that draws the eye. Draco notices as others stand on Potter’s perimeter, gesturing to him when they think he’s not looking, debating whether to approach him for a picture. It’s something he’ll probably have to deal with his whole life, the public scrutinizing his every move to filter his actions through the lens of their own morals.
"And the DMLE doesn't care enough to investigate?" asks Millicent. Draco cranes his neck for a better look. Beef Wellington, a safe choice, if a little predictable. "Sounds like they aren't pulling their weight."
Lovegood plucks a red box from the shelf and tears it open without pretense. Draco can only watch from somewhere outside himself, the experience even more surreal in it’s mundanity. It certainly did nothing to improve his opinion of muggles, faced with their casual disregard for small defenseless fish. Lovegood motions for Draco to hold out his hand, which he does as a mechanical response, and she pours several orange crackers into his open palm before taking some for herself.
"No," he answers without looking up. There’s ink on his fingers and dotting his cheek, a left over childhood habit of gnawing on his quills.
The path that leads into Hogsmeade is lined by great trees on each side, their branches heavy with snow. They arch overhead like joined hands, opening up the sky the nearer Draco gets to town. He makes a mental list of where he needs to stop:
Potter steps forward with a curious sort of reverence that Draco chalks up to Potter’s general curiosity of his surroundings. Draco tries to view the room through Potter’s eyes, like the common room, his heart skipping a traitorous beat when Potter approaches the bed on the far end. His fingers splay over the sheets. “This is your bed.” The statement books no room for argument.
“I haven’t the vaguest idea what you’re on about.” The Mercury quill happily makes ribbons of his Runes essay in an attempt to cross several ’Ts’ at once. “You must think I’m desperate.”
Draco shakes his head. “Not tonight.” It’s silly, but Draco feels content bringing Potter off. He’d wanted to do it, got off on the way Potter had squirmed and panted, the way he’d tasted. Draco was already anticipating the next time. The chance to feel the weight of Potter’s prick on his tongue. “You don’t have to.”
Pansy shakes her head. "None of that explains why the Ministry insists that you do this. You’re in no danger of energy loss if you barely touch your wand." She stares intently at Draco, watching his face for confirmation. "So that does mean …"
"Potter?" Draco blurts gracelessly. He could kick himself. Instead he crosses his arms tightly, willing himself not to fidget. He shrugs nonchalantly in the face of Weasley’s knit eyebrows. "He always did like keeping track of my whereabouts."
Draco holds it up to the light, the sun hitting the platinum sharp and bright. The engraved M curves at the ends, ornate and grand. “My father’s signet ring.”
Above their heads, the canopy of trees sway gently. Theo’s hands continue their measured strokes along the Granian’s pale coat.
Potter’s eyes gleam with furious satisfaction when Draco wheels on him. He shoves his shoulder hard, and Potter stumbles back. “You did that on purpose!”
Thoroughly irritated, Draco endures the whispers and pointed glares of the elevator for a second time, and descends back to the third level. He’s just reached the corridor leading to Headland’s office when he nearly collides into Potter coming out.
“Why Potter, then?” Draco blurts. “If you wanted to target me, drain my magic, make me miserable. Why did it effect him?”
"The terms of your probation say you need to have an escort should you leave the grounds," Pansy reminds them. "Are aurors accompanying you to these dinner as well? Robards hasn’t mentioned anything."
"Karrey?" says Draco, voice echoing around the empty room. The elf appears right away. He has an old-fashioned night cap on his head, crooked jauntily to the side.
“Oh, yes, Saint Potter! Never a dull moment around you and your savior complex!” Draco spits, his tone venomous. “You just love lording it over everyone, don’t you!”
"I could ask you the same, mate!" Ron glances at Draco and Pansy, his smile dimming a bit before he focuses back on Potter. Without a word Potter scoots a bit to make room for Weasley on his other side, so that Draco is forced to set directly across from him and complete their little square. A low table is set the middle of their cushions, and it produces another mimosa, an empty coffee mug, and an entire tea setting in front of Weasley, waiting for him to make his selection, though Draco suspects the uncultured glutton may partake in them all.
"It makes sense, doesn’t it?" Pansy draws her legs up, the question sounding anything but. "You're a terror when you've gone too long without a wand, or a wank."
Focusing his magic in order to ignore Potter’s, Draco takes a deep breath, trailing his fingers along the shelves. Every book in his path hastily moves to crowd amongst themselves, going so far as to rearrange the letters on their spines, despite his stasis incantation. Draco drops his hand. The titles are now all indecipherable gibberish. He’s still not fast enough.
Blaise stands. Lovegood does as well, wandering around the room to check under the chaise and behind the side tables. Draco assumes she's still on about the rocks.
Draco's had time to mull it over. The more he thought about it, the more his instincts seemed all but scream in the direction of Hangingbone’s Sorting Hat and the way it had backfired, leaving him with no response at all. Superstitious or not, it made sense to connect his wild fluctuations in mood to the unspoken pronouncement that he may be stuck in some kind of morality limbo.
“Fred and George charmed them to burp the carols,” his sister picks up, laughing at the memory. “Mum was so mad, she made them weed the entire garden before she’d let them having any pudding.”
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic,” Blaise croons. “Look, I even have an early present for you, Malfoy. Consider this a truce.” Reaching into his own satchel, Blaise pulls out what looks like a thin leaflet with several pages. Draco leans in for a closer look. “A.. calendar?”
"Been keeping busy, Potter?" Blaise cuts in, his posture straight as a line and the smile on his face perfectly charming. "Auror training and all that?"
Draco looks somewhere off to Potter’s left as the words leave his mouth, more to gauge Potter’s response than to set any ground rules. Just because it was his idea doesn’t mean Potter actually
“But that’s not her!” Pansy fumes, crossing her arms. “She’s trying to seduce him with who she thinks he wants, not who she actually is! What’s the point if you can’t keep up the act?”
Draco’s still trying to piece together what’s going on as Blaise leads him with Potter in tow over to the corner they’ve commandeered as their own. Potter’s looks around with interest.
"Too true," she say quickly, fluttering her lashes. Tossing her long, dark hair over her shoulder, Romilda's gaze drifts to Draco. "Speaking of which, how do, Malfoy? Harry’s being here isn’t much of a surprise but I can’t say the same for you." She pauses for effect. "I’d heard you were laying low for the time being."
"I don’t know why you mentioned it at all," says Pansy, her voice curling stiffly around every word. "A nice meal once a week isn’t about to clear your conscious. If it could, darling, I’d expect every Pureblood from here to Albania to be in far better shape."
"Harry's always had stubborn focus," Chang says, in a winning attempt to keep the cheer in her voice from sounding too forced. "I think it's a bit of a seeker trait. Makes sense that he has a thing for them."
All heads turn towards the back of the room to Potter, who focuses his scathing look on Draco alone. It sends a delicious thrill of malice through him. There was something so disingenuous about
"That’s funny." Potter doesn't lower his voice, despite sounding annoyed. "Considering I didn’t know myself until a year ago."
Feeling overcome, he shifts his attention back to Mr. December and his shiny red bulge. Draco folds the image over, pressing one sharp crease, then another. “What happened to the hat?”
“That’s why you wouldn’t talk to anyone yesterday?” Pansy asks, her brows raised. “That dumb sorting hat? You were in such a foul mood when you got back from Hogsmeade, you practically radiated a stink. The first years were casting coins to see who could sit closest to you without passing out from nerves.”
The sight of Potter on his bed does things to Draco’s head. They’re alone in his room and suddenly it feels as if the entire atmosphere changes around them, a tension that fills the air. Draco can feel the way his body responds to the idea, the arousal that makes his prick swell in this trousers.
“Fuck, wait.. wait.” Withdrawing a shaky hand, Potter guides Draco to straddle both his legs, so that when he arches, a delicious frisson of heat shoots down Draco’s spine as their cocks move together. Potter shudders. “Shit.”
Draco decides it's time he take a walk around the gardens, maybe give himself a little space away from the group to focus on his thoughts. He heads towards bank of hedges and rose bushes, examining the blooms as he slowly makes his way along the grounds. His mother would love it here. The beds aren't as artfully arranged as what they've worked on at the manor, but he can still see that a lot of care has gone into the grounds. There's several species of trees and magical insects that he has yet to see anywhere near the manor, and he wonders if it's possible that the yellow rot that Longbottom has successfully helped him conquer has anything to do with the variation of creatures.
“Oh, ah..” He turns wide eyes to Potter, and Potter, the great tosser, only manages to shrug back. Clearly he’s used to Hagrid’s aggressive friendliness and doesn’t think that this particular proposal is a hill worth dying on.
"You'll have to forgive Bulstrode," he says, setting the champagne back down and pushing it away with distaste. He's not a fan of fizzy drinks. "Barely out of school and the details of her love life are already too sordid to repeat in polite company."
In bed, it was even worse. Draco had lain wide awake, alone with his thoughts and resentful of the bright green that glittered angrily before him whenever he tried to close his eyes. Desperation had him casting a silencing charm in order to pull himself off -- a method he knew to be quite effective -- except the thought that those eyes and the urge to wank could in
A stiff breeze moves across the surface of the lake as Draco drapes his scarf around his neck and knots it, nuzzling down into fabric that’s been spelled to be soft as a cloud. The ripples work their way towards them, Draco with his arms wrapped around his knees and Potter, on the other end of the blanket, crossed-legged. The light glinting off Potter’s lens’ obscures his eyes, which is just as well - he doesn’t want to know in what direction he’s looking as Hermione repeats herself.
Having successfully lured him out of hiding with valuable information, Draco follows the others down the corridor line with portraits, to the staircase that connects to the other side of the third floor. As another staircase thunks into place above their heads, Draco is lost in thought. Even if he tried to answer Pansy’s question, he’s not sure he would have had one for her that didn't make him sound as mad as he’d felt lying on Scrivenshaft’s floor.
sentence.” Ernie flashes a joking smile from beneath his knit hat. “You don’t have to send it today.”
the one who cast that spell and you should be glad, because it’d probably have been twice as strong had
“That’s it.” Draco rolls his hips again, lifting off slightly to relish the delicious burn. His cock, damp with lube and pre-cum, slides along the clenched ridges of Harry’s stomach. He feels the way Harry’s thighs flex beneath Draco’s own as he brings his hips off the bed, the way Harry huffs, trying not to cry out as Draco takes him deeper. “Split me wide with that prick of yours.”
Shaking her head, Parvati slips her hand back. Curls it into the sleeve of her robes. She clears her throat. “We’ll talk about it later.” Her eyes dart to Draco with something like guilt, before turning back to Pansy. “So, about this Greg. How does your mum plan to get around the statute on
"You know, I’m almost relieved to know you’re as hypocritical as I am. Climb down from your fucking pedestal for once."
Soon the clearing transforms into a tree-lined path. The sun continues to slip behind the horizon and Draco can't help feeling nostalgic – the surroundings remind him a bit of Wiltshire and the Manor, before when the Dark Lord had been nothing more than a whisper of a name. The path at the end opens up to a giant glass Conservatory, complete with a large circular drive and huge fountain sitting in the middle. There are flower bushes and topiaries, giant hedges and gorgeous fruit trees everywhere Draco looks. It's beautiful.
” Draco says, turning away to walk the length of the aisle. “Rebelling against the dangers of regular sleep or defending your right to insomnia?”
“This is me.” Potter slips out of his trainers and sits on the edge with a bounce. “Feel for yourself.”
Potter's laugh surrounds Draco. It's a deep warm timber that travels down his back like a shiver. In comparison, Boot's laugh doesn't even register.
"That we coordinate our outfits." Draco indicates his own emerald dress robes, flecked with silver. "I knew you were obsessed with me, Potter, but if overcoming our differences requires a matching wardrobe, I'll pass. Solidarity only extends so far..."
Potter stops at a four poster with drawn curtains and Draco wants to laugh - their beds were both in the far corner of their respective rooms. No wonder Potter was able to pick his out with such certainty.
Draco comes, jerking with each pulse of his release as he groans, low in his throat until he’s he spent, and sags. Potter’s moist breath cools the flush of his neck., the prickle of sweat at his nape. When his heartbeat steadies, Draco pulls back just enough to look down.
Not that the tower is much better, but Draco feels catching Potter off guard will be to his advantage. He won’t expect Draco to come anywhere near him after yesterday and because it’s the weekend, there won’t be as many people around. Deep down, Draco’s honestly a little curious to see what the inside of the famed house common room looks like. It’s probably a disgusting mass of red and gold that will sear his retinas and offend his sensibilities.
That night, Draco has a strange dream. He’s seated in the Great Hall, a golden plate placed on the long table before him. Draco swallows mouthful after mouthful of coal until his mouth turns black. He can’t stop, even as tears prick the corners of his eyes and stream down his face. Out of the darkness, Potter appears before him, dancing in nothing but Father Christmas’ well-placed red hat and urgently shouting something Draco can’t hear. Potter’s eyes become increasingly panicked as he reaches out, but it’s too late and Draco can’t, he can’t..
Draco checks his shoulder, brushing for the hairs he can’t see, before her words register. "A pogrebin?"
Potter pulls out the chair next to Draco and drops into it without so much as a glance towards the place card. "We meet again."
Draco turns towards Theo who was sprawled across his bed, furiously scratching at a bit of parchment. "Are you expecting an owl from anyone?"
“Oi, Death Eater, scum! Should have gone to Azkaban, like your father!” The man’s face is blotchy with angry, purple robes swamping his thin frame. “Potter’s been through enough without having to put up with the likes of you!”
"No. According to Headland’s records, others have reported I’m quite demonstrative. It’s just not as," Draco pauses, considering, "positive," he decides, "as they'd like it to be. Which is why he refuses to sign off on any of my release forms until I can prove otherwise."
Now fully awake, Draco bathes and dresses. Once he’s done he gathers his things and heads into the common room in an attempt to catch up with his remaining school work, and more importantly, distract himself. A well-placed
“Mmm,” Pansy hums over the rim of her drink, her eyes twinkling. “So this is what all that bickering has been about, eh?”
Outside the tall, thin windows, the weather is frightful for early December — snow coming down so thick that even the best owl would be waylaid by it. It’s a perfectly reasonable excuse as to why his mother has yet to communicate any definite plans. Last year’s celebrations hadn’t exactly left them in the mood for a repeat.
From the corner of his eye, he spies a quill inching towards his inkpot. Frowning, Draco slides the bottle just out of Parvati’s reach.
True to form, Potter steps further into the aisle. Responding to his movement, several books slide towards him in an attempt to gain attention. “You didn’t mention they were still doing that.”
"Blaise?" Draco scrambles out of the chair and falls to his knees in front of the fireplace. "How are you getting through, our floo is monitored!"
The fresh snow had glittered in the darkness, crystalline like stars, and Draco spent the evening admiring them both, tracing the constellations he knew by heart with his wand as he waited for dinner to be over. It was hours before Peeves stumbled across him, fleeing a run-in with the Baron, and chased him with shrieking laughter back to the Dungeons.
"I didn’t say I’d read it." Romilda pouts. "I said I’d heard. What’s good journalism without sources?"
“Oi!” Weasley shouts, though he’s smiling. “That’s my best mate you’re talking about it. And his head is as hard as ever, with or without the ferret around.”
“I think you’ve earned this,” Blaise says, slipping a piece of paper face down across the table. Draco picks it up. It’s another calendar page, this one of a thin, but toned, dark haired man with nothing on but a stylized reindeer thong covering his bits. He’s much more Draco’s type, but like hell he’ll let Blaise know that. “Why does your calendar have two Decembers?”
“Is that The Spice Girls?” Granger points to the topmost album in Draco’s stack. “That’s their new record isn’t it? I’d meant to pick up a copy over the summer.”
Behind them, Theo snorts loudly. He’s leading his horse through the garden, careful to avoid the newly planted snapdragons, who gnash their teeth as he passes. Draco whirls to face him. "I'm not!" he insists.
hot chocolate and pours it into Weasley’s lap. Shocked, Draco watches as Potter deliberately lets the mug drain, shaking off the dregs before putting it down. Weasley shakes off his stupor and jumps to his feet. His entire crotch is soaked. “Harry!?” He shrieks with the indignation of someone who enjoys having a prick and wants to use it again one day.
with distaste. "She’s one of my dearest friends. Imagine how surprised I was when she mentioned you."
With Headland’s reception-witch taken care of, it doesn’t take long for Draco to get and out of his Mind Healer’s office. He keeps his responses vague, unwilling to give Headland any ammunition in terms of his thoughts on Potter. They finish earlier than expected, and with time to spare before he’s due back, Draco detours to the Atrium to visit the tea cart for a drink.
"Do you?" Draco turns now, shouldering the wall. "Because you looked like you had an appetite a few minutes ago."
“How about some cushions,” Granger interrupts, elbowing him with a sharp look as she summons them with her wand. They settle on the floor while the Weasley girl throws herself onto the couch, socked feet dangling over the arm of the chair.
The team have charmed their jerseys different shades of yellow in order to tell each side apart. The Hufflepuff player Draco favors, is a small boy with pin straight dark hair named Amiro, also the team’s seeker. He’s wearing a mustard colored top and so Draco pulls for his side, he and Ernie leaping to their feet when one of Amiro’s teammates manages to whack the quaffle through the hoop so fast, the keeper on the other end actually spins a full 360 degrees.
“What about at night, when we’re sleeping?” Potter insists on invading Draco’s space, however subtle as he slides closer to him on the bench. Draco eyes flit around, but no one seems to be watching them as Potter continues. “You kicked me out last night but I think we ought to try sleeping in the same bed. Just to see how it affects things. Maybe it will-- why are you mad?!”
We just feel the other’s mood?” He looks to Draco, who shrugs, playing his best at nonchalance while his heart pounds in his chest.
"Have you been to any games this season?" Potter jerks his head at the empty cushion beside him. There's really no way to assign seats tonight.
Lips no longer moving, Malfoy spoke again, and Harry could hear his voice, clipped snatches, as if it were coming from inside him.
Potter appears from somewhere at the other end of the aisle. It's only years of failed attempts to bring him down a peg or two, that makes him woefully familiar with Potter's dumb cloak and keeps Draco from being startled. At least outwardly. His heart, on the other hand, has leapt into his throat and is doing somersaults.
"I suppose you’ve sold the Black Home," says Draco's mouth, wholly and entirely without his permission.
"I assume you mean the muggle way," scoffed Malfoy, one eyebrow raised. Sidestepping the overturned chair in the middle of the room, he ignored the furious woman flailing against her constraints, as if she too were another piece of furniture face down on the carpet. "We're not so desperate as all that."
His eyes never leaving Draco’s, Potter summons a house elf and asks it to bring Draco a steaming mug of hot chocolate. It’s mere seconds later that it arrives, Potter adding a few marshmallows before sliding it towards him. Draco takes it with nervous excitement. Blows on it for a moment, then takes a sip. He waits for the compulsion to rise in him, the one that will make him react before he has time to register what he’s doing.
Still, the words are out of Draco’s mouth before he can put sense to them. Gryffindor recklessness seems to be catching. Perhaps he’s picked it up through osmosis alone.
She hefts her handbag onto the table before her, busily rummaging inside. “And while many of those traditions are familiar to you, I thought today’s lesson could do with a bit of fun.”
Draco squeezes a bit of lemon juice onto his greens. "I have to admit I wasn’t expecting it to be quite this good."
"Don't you tell me to calm down!" Draco wants to throw something. He waits when people try to soothe him out of a proper rage. "I told you there was a problem! These pointless dinners are only making things worse!"
“The hell you didn’t!” Blaise roars. “You’ve been a moody tit all week!” Parvati, her long dark braid sliding over her shoulder, scoop a handful of snow into her glove and holds it to Blaise’s cheek. He bristles irritably, pushing her hand away. His face is already starting to swell. “I don’t know what you’re playing at, but leave me out of it.” Turning on his dragonhide boots, he stomps back towards the castle, snow crunching noisily under his feet. Parvati gives Draco a wary look before going after him.
!” Harry’s voice rings out loud and clear as Hangingbone’s wand goes flying. She spins, her arm flailing, and Draco barely ducks in time to avoid toppling into the water. Instead he grabs his wand, casting the first defensive spell he can think of that won’t be deemed by an outside party as anything but innocent tailoring gone wrong.
“Go away?” Draco tilts his head with interest. “I never figured you for the jetsetter type, Potter.”
Harry seems to be thinking along the same lines, as he gives Draco a flat look, rolling his eyes when Draco mirrors the look back at him. “You’re a Slytherin. You know greasing the wheels won’t hurt.”
Several people wince as Draco shoots up from his chair, the legs making an unpleasant screech. “Book,” he grounds out, holding himself erect until he turns a corner, walks several feet and sags.
Draco exits the bakery and crosses the street, walking briskly back towards the Ministry. He tries to stop himself from thinking about the exchange that just took place. Why was Potter talking about him? How did his name come up and what else might he have said? It was enough to drive Draco mad if he allowed himself think on it too long. Potter was an Auror — of course news of his release would have crossed his desk. But did Potter know the terms of his sentence? The idea of it sent a hot flush of embarrassment up Draco's neck.
In Hogsmeade, the open plot of land next to Madam Puddifoot’s shop had been fashioned into a brand new attraction for couples to indulge their romantic overtones. In the warm months, it was to be a lake upon swan boats would glide while cupids sang, surrounded by benches and picnic blankets for those who wanted to eat their cakes and drink their tea while watching the sun on the water. But in the winter, it functioned as a skating rink, ideal for couples’ skating, set amongst a glittering gold gazebo and enchanted hearts that bobbed beneath the surface of the ice.
Draco stops pulling books from his shelf long enough to fix Pansy with a dour look. "Do make yourself comfortable." The following Wednesday finds her strolling through his floo once again, accompanied by a sleeve of chocolate biscuits and a request to hear a full report of his weekend. Theo, unwilling to endure anything beyond the most basic notions of friendship (unless there was something in it for him), had hurriedly eaten his sweets and extracted himself, leaving Draco to bear the full brunt of Pansy’s questioning.
Draco plays with his porridge, glancing around until he spots Potter across the room. Unknown entities, indeed. He’d grimaced at Draco on his way into the Great Hall as Draco emerged from the Dungeons. He assumes Potter must be off to a bad start, himself. He has to realize what he looks like with his rumpled clothes and his black hair sleep tousled like he’s only just come down to bless them with his presence before heading back upstairs to make another go of it. The dark circles are still under his eyes, and as Potter moodily bites down on another rasher of bacon, it’s obvious whatever stick is lodged in his arse hasn’t been removed.
“Better watch out, then,” Harry says as he guides Draco’s mouth to his own. “I think we’re all of the above.”
Potter’s hand hovers over the spot Draco knows he keeps his wand, but he doesn’t draw it. Not that he’d really need to - Draco’s seen what he can do without one. Weasley, moves the popcorn to the floor, warily. Apparently they’ve been stringing popcorn for the garish tree sitting in the corner behind them.
"It’s not my fault the offerings were so poor. Standards must be lower than I thought if that was what passes for gourmet."
It’s not until once again, Draco stands gazing up at the portrait of The Fat Lady, his palms sweaty, that he stops to think about just how ludicrous this idea truly is. He’s about to willingly enter the lion’s den, surround himself with a room full of brash, reckless Gryffindors to something as cozy as wrap presents together. There was offering the proverbial olive branch and  then there was offering oneself to be eaten alive.
Eyes wide, Harry and Draco watch together as Hangingbone’s robes tighten around her body, ribboning before she keels over in a full body bind. She hits the wood of the dock with a satisfying thud, the scarf muffling her enraged shrieks.
Wouldn’t it be nice to be perfect Potter, the lauded hero who would never have to worry about being deemed as anything but that. Heroic deed after heroic deed absolving him of all the times
filling out paperwork. And while he'd never be as calm as Harry during a crisis, in the year and a half since they'd first been assigned to each other, he'd become someone Harry could rely on.
,” Draco says delicately. “You skate rather well, Potter. It takes a lot to be able to keep up with me.”
The scratching of nibs on parchment ebbs and flows, a gentle rhythm broken occasionally by soft laughter or the hollow thud of a book split wide against the hard surface of a desk. Madam Pince skulks the aisles, her sharp *tut* of disapproval following the noises without fail, or any sound above a whisper.
Unfurling his fist, Draco grimaces. He’s still holding Parvati’s monstrous quill, the shaft snapped a third of the way down.
“When we get back.” Draco tells himself he needs time to collect himself, but he’s pretty sure he’s procrastinating. “Since when do you take Narcissa Malfoy’s best interests into consideration?”
“Thank you for having me,” Draco says with complete sincerity, looking at each Gryffindor in turn. He hadn’t expected to have as good a time as he did, but he won’t be as foolish as to lie about it. Draco’s eyes linger on Potter, who wears an unreadable expression. “I had a really good time.”
“Yes. Alright.” Draco purses his lips. He wants to ask why Potter is being so forward, but figures now is not the time to push his luck. He’s trying to get along with Potter, be something close to friends, even if it’s just for appearances. Draco rises from the table. “I’ll come by later. And I expect hot chocolate.”
He draws back and her eyes remain trained on his, darting with frequency towards Abernathy’s direction. Draco offers nothing more than a vacant smile as he wordlessly continues to admire her silk robes, though he does feel a pang in his chest at the way her mouth tightens.
To his horror, Draco’s vision goes blurry, the elderly man obscuring into smears of colors as fat tears roll down his cheeks. He feels his chest hitch and a moment later, he’s crying in earnest.
that there may be times Potter goes off by himself to have a good cry over things from his past that he can’t change, and the people he loved that he can never get back. Draco feels uncomfortable when he thinks about it, so he doesn’t. Instead he pushes it to the back of him mind, along with the thought that if this,
"Just leave it alone, would you?" Draco takes an angry bite, a sour expression on his face that transforms the moment his mind registers the taste of the eggs. They're perfectly cooked fluffy and light, the perfect amount of salt. Bless these bloody house elves. "I'll have to proposition Karrey if he keeps this up," Draco says around a moan.
On the edge of their group, Potter fidgets. Draco feels an almost odd detachment as he watches him from the corner of his eye. Potter looks just as out of it as Draco feels, standing with his hands buried in his pockets, dark hair falling into his eyes. Distantly, Longbottom motions for Blaise to come help, asks him to aim his wand at a knot high in the tree while they attempt a severing charm at the base.
“Yes, I’m—” There’s a dull ache all down his back, his right shoulder throbbing when he tries to move it. Draco hisses as he sits up. “I’m fine. You?”
Deep in Draco, an alarm goes off. There’s something about the woman in front of him that’s become unsettling, and they’ve left the topic of conversation without even properly broaching it. “You said you read my note, Professor. Potter and I were both affected by that Sorting Hat. It didn’t fall on a decision of
“You didn’t,” Potter says with obvious shock. Spots of color appear high in his cheeks, practically giving him away. “You might have said something to me!”
"Not yet," Draco says as he sits and stretches his legs out in front of them. "The terms of my parole doesn't particularly allow for recreational activities."
By Wednesday he’s picked all the fruit in the orchard, re-soiled all the pots, and has pulled all the weeds from between the blooms. He changes the spell work on the fountain so that the spray is iridescent, light illuminating the roses it blooms at night, petals floating on the water.
"How'd you manage to get Granger to let you off your leash for a night?" Pansy takes a delicate sip from her tea. She's charmed her lipstick so that it doesn't leave so much as a speck on the rim.
"Of course. If you can brave the public’s hostility, the least I can do is extend an olive branch to my own sister. She returns the pressure of his hand with her own. "Take care tonight. Summon Coopey if you need anything."
Harry starts with a suddenness that suggests his mind was very far away. “No, that’s okay. I think they suspected something was up anyway.”
Draco climbs in first, his blood thundering when Harry seats himself beside Draco instead of across, bumping his knee. "I like to see where I'm going," Harry explains. Draco nods, wondering why he would volunteer such innocuous information. "How observant of you."
"Please don't underestimate me." Blaise sniffs. He mouth transforms into a smug smile. "We only have about ten minutes, so Luna and I are coming through. Step back."
Draco snorts into his tea, doing his best to drowned out their bickering, the bells, and the chains as he keeps his eyes trained on the double doors. He expects Potter chose to sleep in this morning, as rested from the previous night’s activities as Draco is. He’d tried to sense Potter when he’d first sat down, but all Draco found in return was a general sense of relaxation, and  that had been good enough for him.
Draco nods. The Abernathy's letter includes the necessary provisions. The location spells are temporarily lifted. Draco walks out onto the front lawn, takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes.
He doesn’t allow either of them to close the distances. Instead Draco dips his head and brushes his lips to Potter’s neck.
“Well, tell Padma if she doesn’t favor Pansy’s, she’s welcome to stay at mine,” Blaise winks, settling back. “Bit low on bed space though, so we’d have to share.”
"We know of each other," Boot glances at Draco. "But it might help if we break the ice a little. Maybe a round of drinks?"
instead of anger at the assumption, or annoyance at the approach — even fear, in light of the sexuality he had yet to fully step into and claim for what it was? What it might mean for his future?
He bites the inside of his cheek. He doesn’t want to answer with Potter next to him in case he’s overstepping his boundaries. Maybe he thinks it’s one think when Harry thinks its something else, and to find that out while receiving the third degree from his friends an idea that Draco finds beyond mortifying.
"I’m perfectly fine, thank you." Draco finishes his glass of water. He doesn't want to get drunk tonight. If anything's going to happen, he wants to be sober so he can remember it.
"Have you ever stopped to consider this from the other direction?" Blaise props his elbows on his knees. "Potter only joined Squill & Spoon the week before you did. Since his first supper with you, you continue to show up in his rotation like clockwork."
A thick silence descends. He feels he ought to say something to fill it. On the other hand, why make the effort of polite conversation when they both knew there was nothing to say? He’s sure Weasley would appreciate the honesty and lack of pretense. Draco turns back around to the display.
Instead of heading back to the dungeons, Draco heads across the foyer to the Great Hall for dinner. He’s tired of feeling like he has to avoid the space and the prying eyes of his classmates every time something happens. Potter attacked
“Here now, there’s no need to be upset! I just wanted to make sure you weren’t doing anything you shouldn’t!” Draco can barely make out the sound of Scrivenshaft’s cane as he taps it against the floor. “Stop all that crying! Drat!” The cane clatters as he drops it. “Now see what you’ve done??”
Potter’s face softens. He takes one and pops it into his mouth. “Sorry,” he shoots Draco a grateful look as he takes a few more. “I’ve forgotten what it’s like when Hogsmeade gets busy like this. I’ve been kind of on edge.”
"Don't make fun of me, o chosen one. I'm not the one in that shirt," Draco says, nodding at Potter’s chest. "Let’s talk about your far more amusing preference for underdogs that seems to extend to your supporting the worst team in the league."
“You asked me to leave you alone, didn’t you?” Potter asks in the same pleading voice. He extends his legs as he turns and Draco idly notices that Potter’s woolen socks have little stags on them.
Abernathy is late. Draco paces the foyer, stopping every few turns to pull a curtain aside and gazing out into the darkness. The invitation that arrived for tonight's dinner, Draco's fourth, advises he dress for bed. It's a bit strange, but Draco has learned to go along with it. He pulls the sash of his silver robe tighter, letting the curtain fall back into place.
“So,” Granger begins, doing a terrible job at faking her casual tone. “You and Harry are… getting along?”
Draco turns several times in place. Judging from the view he must be in one of the towers. He can see the night sky, stars spread across the dark like spilled salt.
"Fuck," he breathes, watching Harry from under heavy-lidded eyes. Draco brings his hips up. "Do you know how good you look?"
"Well," Potter says, tersely, "tell your sources that was just an assignment, and the assignment is over."
"I practically threw myself at you," she continues. Draco reminds himself to nod to whatever Boot is currently saying. "The last I heard, you were gallivanting around the continent with that dashing Quidditch player. The pierced one."
"Mmm, yes. Adequate company, substandard food, harassed by house elves. Karrey has it out for me, I'm sure of it."
Potter cups his cheek, his elbow digging into one of several squishy pillows. “So you said you wanted to talk in private?”
“Oh yeah!” Potter jumps to his feet as Weasley sputters. “I almost forgot! I’ll be right back.” Draco watches as Potter climbs through the Portrait Hole as if he’s being chased. When he turns back, both Weasleys and Granger are staring him in various states of curiosity and discomfort.
In the evenings, the stone walls of the Dungeon are tinged emerald from the ornate lamps that sit on the smooth, dark, side tables and the flames that roar pleasantly in the hearth. The fire is charmed to remain Slytherin green, even without Floo powder, and as it burns, the light creates sinuous shadows in the room that undulate with serpentine curves, thrown into stark relief.
“Yeah,” Potter agrees cryptically, lowering himself onto the bleachers to perch on the end of it. “Say Ernie, how’s a hot drink sound? Some butterbeer?” Draco darts to grab Potter’s wrist, but he’s already summoned a house elf. “Two butter beers, Minzy, please. That is, unless Malfoy— would you like one?” Potter offers, turning to him.
"Sorry, sorry, I know I’m late." Potter climbs through the circular door of the vault, wearing that sheepish smile Draco hates the most. He hates it so much, it’s the first one his mind usually supplies him when he works himself in the middle of the night, careful to bite back his moans now that he can no longer cast silencing spells on his doors.
"I thought you weren't so desperate as all that." Harry shivered as Malfoy's warm breath fanned across his lips.
,” she indicates the hat again with obvious excitement, “is that Father Christmas’ red hat is actually a
Oh well, Draco thinks, as he clears his throat and offers the password Potter had given him as they parted that morning. “Peppermint Toad!”
Instead of answering, Potter grips his wand and points it at him. Draco feels the warm pulse of Potter’s magic, shivering involuntarily as it slides like a caress down his back, spreads radial heat through his groin. Behind him, the bookshelf ripples until the engraved lettering of each book shines golden and pristine.
Draco snaps to attention following the direction of the voice. Strange lighting makes his vision swim, and Draco blinks rapidly, shielding his eyes until they can adjust. The light recedes to reveal Luna Lovegood staring back at him, her moony eyes wide with concern. Abernathy, all but forgotten, appears at her side looking entirely too amused by his display for Draco’s liking.
Draco falls forward, jerks as Harry removes his fist, so that each pulse is caught, slick and wet, between their stomachs. Biting his bottom lip, Draco curls in hand into Harry’s hair, let’s him fuck up into him, whines when as hot pulses of spunk fill him up.
The assessing look Bellero gives Potter says she greatly doubts this, but she goes obediently, Draco wincing as her talons dig once again into his shoulder as she takes off.
But tonight, the decision isn't in his hand. He doesn't regret taking those first steps. Sending that first letter. He never did.
"I knew you were upset about that!" Potter twists to face him, tamping down on a disbelieving laugh that almost sounds fond. He jostles
“It looks different than the last time I was here,” Potter murmurs, almost to himself before turning to look up at Draco. “It’s.. nice.”
“Is he ill?” Pansy again. She’s moved closer, the curtain bulging as her body comes into contact with the
home if that’s what she’s afraid of. My mum and Greg the Muggle™, have a place in Islington that is perfectly on the up and up.” She rolls her eyes. “Goodness, I thought Ravenclaws were supposed to be the smart ones.”
“What?” Draco eyes dart back and forth. “What’s happened?” He rips the hat from his head, frenzied and frightened.
“Oh, uh, hey!” He says a bit too cheerful, his eyes wide behind the frame of his glasses. Draco’s seen horses during a thunderstorm that looked less spooked than Potter does in this moment.
“Luna did say I’d have made a good Ravenclaw,” Potter muses, as they pass the runaway crup once again, tearing the opposite way up the road. “But she also regularly reports that my Aura would benefit from a good bowl of boiled gillyweed and cabbage for regularity.”
"That's not—" Potter jerks his head, rubbing right where Draco knows his scar lies hidden beneath his fringe. "I don’t expect you to understand."
Abernathy escorts Draco into London the next Saturday. Squill & Spoon has chosen another muggle location to host their dinner, far more opulent than the last: a bank. Entering the building, a large chandelier gleams overhead and his dress shoes sink pleasantly into the plush red carpet. The familiarity of it all has a calming effect on Draco, until he’s led by Karrey the house elf to the place where the vaults are kept. There are no goblins, no carts. Just a large steel door with a circular latch that any idiot capable of a decent Alohomora! could unlock. It’s terribly disappointing, a fact he shares with Karrey as he opens the safe to reveal access to another room.
“She’s all over him!” Pansy juts her chin towards the center of the rink where Parvati has an arm draped over Anthony’s shoulder, giggling nervously as he takes the lead and guides them slowly across the ice. “You know she knows how to skate? She and Padma took lessons! Her uncle negotiated the deal for the rink at Rockefeller Center!”
up, they’d just manage to lip read the conversation. Since Hogwarts was built, generations have passed through this house in hopes of emulating their Founder’s parseltongue skills and as the obsession passed down the line, so did a growing fetish: lips. mouths, tongues. It’s a running gag that one can tell how just how adept their partner is with their tongue by the curve of their cupid’s bow. It’s also made several Slytherins, bi- and tri- lingual, which meant that there was really no means of communication that would be safe for them to have without leaving the room completely. “We’re going to my dorm so we can speak in private.”
Draco blinks. The suddenness of the invitation takes him by surprise. “I— Cheers, McMillan, but I couldn’t impose. I don’t think your family is as forgiving and I wouldn’t want to risk it, considering.” He gestures vaguely between them, grateful when Ernie interprets what he’s said with an understanding nod.
What a strange choice of words. He'd already forgiven Malfoy of much worse. The thought of it made his chest grow tight. "Am I keeping you?" Harry rose to his feet. Congratulated himself on sounding casual when impulse made him add, "Hot date?"
They reach the familiar tapestry, which Draco takes his time examining, chewing his lip. In a lot of ways, this is far worse than the Astronomy Tower.
The warm feeling in Draco’s stomach dims and sinks like a stone. Potter’s giving Ernie a very cool look indeed, and despite his efforts to fight it, Draco immediately registers the irritation in his clenched fists and narrowed brows. There’s also a flash of something unexpected, but it’s gone so fast that Draco doesn’t register it. He’s focused on Ernie’s straight white teeth and his blonde hair and his smug happy pleased smile, who does he even think he is with his hands all over—
Draco's stomach flutters uncomfortably. He looks down at his empty plate, Karrey should be coming to clear it away soon. The beater for the Wasps has pierced ears, but that hardly seems exciting.
"Has he?" Draco takes his mother’s hands in his own, smoothening his thumb over the delicate ridge of her knuckles. When her eyes soften, he can’t resist giving her hands a gentle squeeze. "Are you sure that's a good idea? The two of you have only been on speaking terms for a few weeks."
“Harry, what’s he talking about?” Weasley still looks traumatized and the talk of figuratively getting off isn’t helping.
Draco doesn't want to be late, tonight of all nights. What if Potter thinks he's scared him off? Or that Draco doesn't want to see him?
They’d been up late last night, wrapping the last of their gifts in order to make the rounds this morning: The Burrow. The Manor. Teddy. Hogwarts. But of course, mistletoe had materialized out of nowhere, and they’d gotten distracted. Draco was learning he was particularly randy during the Holidays, looking for any excuse to shed his clothes.
The words don’t echo off the cavernous stones, or hang in the air between them. It’s exactly the opposite. They sink like a stone beneath the surface of the water. Like a heavy object dropped unceremoniously at Draco’s feet. “The plan?”
"It's the B Team," Harry said gruffly, wetting his lips. "The ones on the Russia case. We just have to hold things down while they make the jump."
In actuality they’re too exhausted to allow for much more than furtive touches and slow, deep kisses up to their necks in the warm, soapy water of the Prefect’s bath. It doesn’t stop Draco from feeling contentment sink into his bones, the solid weight of Harry’s arms around his waist as their lips meet over and over, making Draco feel as light as a feather.
"That makes sense." And it does. It's one of the reasons Draco encouraged Theo to come stay with him once their fathers were sentenced, despite knowing Auror Abernathy would be another one of the conditions. Loneliness is a great motivator.
"He says he doesn't want to see you." Opal was never one to mince words. "But. If you were to return in, let’s say, twenty minutes time, with a pumpkin pasty from that place in Diagon Alley, you may find me away from my desk. Just around the time Headland takes his midday nap."
“Figured that out, did you?” Draco sneers, gritting his teeth. He’d like to start from the other end this time, but suspects the results will be much the same if Potter doesn’t stop hovering. “I’ll be done in a moment if you’d like to go.” The dismissal is as polite as Draco can muster, given that they both know he’ll refuse it.
There's a strange intensity to Harry's eyes as he lifts his glass, studying Draco. "To overcoming differences."
Once they're all seated, Lovegood takes it upon herself to lead the conversation by stating the obvious. "Tonight’s supper is your first, isn’t it Draco? It’s funny that you and Harry would be tabled together, tonight of all nights."
It had been a very, very long night. They would be leaving for holidays the following morning. With the promise that she would talk to the Ministry on Draco’s behalf, and have supper sent up to them once they were ready for bed, McGonagall finally sent them off, rubbing at her temples.
“He is,” Draco answers slowly, wondering why he feels a prickle of anxiety. “But he’s getting behind on his classes thanks to you, so I’m going to help him revise in the meantime.”
“What are we looking at,” Draco whispers, bumping his shoulder against Potter’s as he joins him in front of the window.
Potter wears an expression that clearly states he remembers his last experience with Romilda and her drinks. He feels something akin to satisfaction watching Potter lean away from her. "I think they’ve got it right.. Never know what someone might be up to."
“I--” Weasley looks down as the mass of snowflake covered paper he’s crushed up and tied with a bow. “Oi, I never claimed to be good at this!”
Potter nods. His eyes seem to burn in the near-darkness, a single, lonely torch the only source of light. Shadows play across his face as he moves closer to Draco. "I know what you mean."
He gets the zip on Potter’s jeans down in record time, massages the shape of Potter’s prick through the cotton of his pants. He’s long and thick, responsive to Draco’s touch in the way his stomach flutters when Draco slips his fingers under the elastic to grip him properly. Potter cries out, a guttural groan that makes Draco’s own pants tighten as he traces his fingers over the veins.
"Are all Gryffindors so quick to stereotype?" Draco makes a nasty face. "The whole purpose of Squill & Spoon is so that we move past our assumptions of one another. But I know how you work, Potter. It’s just like you to make me your little pet case and assign house elves and who knows who else to keep an eye on me."
The elf is back in a flash, and again, Draco tries to elbow Potter out of the way and take the bottles for himself. At least if he hands it to Ernie, the curse may misconstrue the action and credit it to him. But as usual, Potter’s reflexes are quick, and when Draco move left, he moves right, handing Ernie the uncapped bottle of warm, frothy, liquid over Draco’s head.
It’s with great reluctance when Draco finally rises onto his knees, stretching his arms over his head. He has to get back to the dungeons soon for a quick shower before bed. If he’s lucky he’ll avoid Theo and Blaise, who are just as bad as Pansy when it comes to gossip and will undoubtedly want an account of his entire afternoon.
he’d be under was ending. Out of the corner of his eye, as the chortling subsides, something pulls Draco eye to the other end of the table. Potter is laughing too, Weasley gesturing with his hands. He smiles, and as he does, Draco feels a flutter of warm content in his belly.
.” Draco claps a hand to his forehead. He can feel Potter watching him. He turns his head in his direction. “Potter, this not just my problem, it’s yours too. You don’t want to go to back to a life without magic, do you?”
“And your sticking charms would be more efficient if you applied one to the center first,” Draco continues turning to Granger. Watching her fumble was giving him a headache. Potter had better come back soon or he’d unwrap all their presents and fix them himself. “If you want the folds to lay properly, you’ll need to start again. Here, let me show you.”
And yes, maybe Draco’s anger makes him feel a little reckless. There’d been no sign of Potter when Draco’d finished being examined and he’s hungry to finish what the Chosen One started.
The shops hum with activity this close to Christmas, shoppers bustling from store to store with their bags floating before them, boughs of holly draped around their shoulders, drinking warmed bottles of butterbeer, children enchanting sparkling bobbles to dance in the air before them as they eat peppermint flavored ice creams. Draco pays a merchant for a rolled newspaper full of roasted chestnuts sprinkled with salt and cinnamon and drizzled with honey. He’ll knows for a fact that Potter’s sweet tooth is as bad as his own, and figures they can share the snack between them.
He jolts upright, gasping for air as perspiration slides down his back. Hair sticks to his temples as Draco feels for his wand, pulling it from the holster on his thigh to cool himself down. Wearing the holster has second nature to him now, despite how strange it’d felt when he’d first bought it, the way he’d chided himself for his paranoia as he tried it on. It was justified, considering what happened to the Hawthorne.
Harry throws an arm over his eyes, gasping, and even then Draco doesn't stop, sucking and lapping until Harry has to push him away, his arm trembling.
Draco smirks. "It was certainly a shock to Longbottom to find we have something in common, I assure you."
Potter and Malfoy were said to have entered several stores, including Honeydukes (as it is wildly know that Potter has a rather large sweet tooth), The Alchemist’s Secret Wares, and Creature Comforts to name a few. When asked to comment, Potter reportedly shouted obscenities at the crowd, telling them several times that while not in his right mind, he believed himself capable of making his own decisions.
Draco launches himself at Harry before he can think better of it, pressing his mouth to his with a ferocity that feels urgent, wild. It feels crazy when Harry doesn't rebuff him, dizzying when he returns Draco's kiss with an intensity that matches his own.
The elevator dings. The doors spring open, but neither one of them steps back despite the interruption. Potter closes his eyes, leaning his forehead to Draco's temple. He allows it until the doors slide shut again, leaving them alone in the corridor. Then he pushes Potter back.
The three of them are led to the table and seated just as the remaining guests arrive: Terry Boot, who Draco remembers as being agreeable enough at school, and Romilda Vane, remembered almost exclusively for her obnoxious attempts to garner Potter's attentions.
“…and it might even be a way to calibrate our magic,” Draco says, shaking his head as if in a daze. Was he really suggesting they fool around in order to preserve their magical ability?
In December, the merpeople tend to hibernate in their underwater caves, deep in the center of the lake, and there’s not much to watch in the water outside the dungeon’s windows except the gillyweed that bobs and ebbs with the current and the occasional curl of the great squid’s tentacles. Occasionally, he’ll tap them against the glass in a rhythm Draco’s come to understand as
Which is why he needs to try the hat on again. Whether it pronounces him NAUGHTY or NICE, at least he’ll have his answer. And if he tries it on again and it says nothing at all.. well, that’ll be an answer of sorts, too.
“You look like a drowned rat,” Harry said affectionately, bumping Draco’s shoulder as they walked down from the Headmistress’ office.
"I'm not the one who plans the table settings!" Headland stops frantically flipping through his planner to look up. "Wait. Something like what? What happened, Draco?"
"Pretty sure staying out of it counts as 'something’ And I'm already suffering." The corners of Theo’s lips twitch once, twice, before they finally bleed over into a smirk that stretches across his face. "I’ve been here over a month and yet still not a one of your house elves has revealed themselves to know how to make a decent cuppa."
"A friend who's been staying at mine for a few weeks. Ginny finally managed to kicked me out, so I'm back at Grimmauld Place but that house is too large for one person. Figured I could use the company."
Draco watches through his fingers as the Hufflepuff takes a sip. Nothing immediately happens and Ernie takes another long swig before Draco feels his shoulders start to relax.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you,” quips Parvati, taking a generous dunk of ink. Draco mentally adds her name to the small list of obnoxious people in his life. It’s also the list of people in his life at all.
"You ought to come out with us sometime, then. Bring Blaise and Pansy, we'll make a night of it. You too Harry, now that you've rid yourself of that last bloke. What a knob he was. No offense," Finnigan adds quickly, looking sheepish.
to browse for heavier robes — thought he much prefers the fabrics at Twillfits and the tailor, who was discreet — and finally,
"They're doing just fine if you ask me." Potter makes no effort to hide the bite in his voice. Another predictable choice, Draco thinks, but one that has much more potential to be entertaining.
"Malfoy." Ron Weasley scrunches his long nose as if something foul wafts beneath it. Draco mirrors his posture, squaring his shoulders. "Weasley."
“I’m not!” Draco says through clenched teeth, turning to face forward again. Fucking Potter. He should have known he’d have some kind of ulterior motive for insisting they spend time together. But to suggest something like this just because he wasn’t able to have his way last night, was too much.
Hangingbone’s eyes are overly bright, as she looks from Draco’s face down into the water. “Do you think so, Mr. Malfoy?” Her voice is low. “I’ve found true nature will always show itself in one way or another.”
Karrey appears to lead them into the conservatory and seat them at a long table. Everyone is on the same side, like a wedding party or the head table at Hogwarts, but somehow Potter's place seating is has been placed next to his once again. Karrey stares up at Draco with wide unblinking eyes as he takes his wand. He continues to stare for so long that Draco finds himself looking around to make sure he's not imagining things. Did someone cast a freezing charm?
Pansy nods, her lips mischievous. “Practically tied at the waist.” She shakes her head. “The hip? Whatever.”
However, can’t stay in the dungeons right now. It’s not because Blaise is giving him the cold shoulder — he’s dealt with that before, and Pansy and Theo have been very good about keeping him company, doing their best to ignore his occasional giggles or his curtness when he grows impatient with them. He’ll have to make it up to them this holiday for sure. Neither of them celebrate Christmas but love presents, and he makes a note to order something by owl mail, as he’s hesitant to attempt Hogsmeade again.
“Yeah?” Draco shuts his eyes tight, feels the way the arousal coils low in his belly, tension building as he arches his back before it snaps, carrying him over the edge in an intense wave of pleasure.
He inclines his head, gives her his most charming smile — the one he used to ask Pansy to the Yule Ball even when he knew he wasn’t attracted to her (or anyone with a fanny). The one that had gotten him his first kiss afterwards, hidden in the bushes, with a dark haired Drumstrang boy.
Karrey blinks, his eyes flat. He closes the box with a snap that almost takes Draco's fingers with it. "This way."
Eventually a small girl, whose tie identifies her as a second-year, climbs through the portrait hole, and Draco glimpses a shocking amount of fairy lights and tinsel, inside. She starts, when she sees him, still holding the door open.
Harry rolls onto his side and brings his hand to his mouth. Slowly, he licks Draco's come from his fingers, and it’s so hot that Draco feels his cock give a weak twitch of interest. If he had his way he would do it. Draco wants to push Harry down and rut inside him, bury his cock into his arse until they both black out. But for now, he settles with kissing Harry hungrily, the taste of his come still on Harry's lips.
“Tell the Headmistress what?” says the cool, confident voice of Ginny Weasley. “That he’s threatened you all with a roll of Christmas paper? Threatened to hogtie Harry with ribbon?” She snorts. “At least Malfoy’s got gifts to wrap - now that Marie’s dumped you, your shopping list is lighter, isn’t it Simon?”
"I expect you need to swallow them whole if you want them to swim in your stomach," she muses, gazing towards the ceiling as she chews thoughtfully. "But they crunch so pleasantly, I haven't managed it yet."
“Nothing happened,” says Weasley, stating the obvious. He crosses his arms, looking smug. “I figured he was making it up, mate. Doesn’t have anything better to do than try to pull one over on you.”
“I told you so,” Potter smirks, obviously in favor of lightening the mood. “I’m starting to rethink the idea of beds altogether. We ought to sleep standing up. Take a note from the vampires and get ourselves some coffins.”
Potter is as Draco works his fist to bring him off properly. Potter’s hand finds its way into his Draco’s hair, threading his fingers to grip lightly as Draco kisses along the flat of his stomach, the jut of his hip.
“It’s some arsehole spouting off. Sorry to say, but it’s bound to happen if you’re out with me. I should have warned you.” Draco runs a hand over his face, through his windswept hair. “Honestly, they’re bottom feeders with nothing better to do. It probably won’t even make the back page.”
“Tch!” Potter turns to leave and slips on the an icy patch, falling onto his arse in the snow. Draco doesn’t bother to hide his mocking laughter. But then Potter begins to laugh too, rubbing his behind in pain as his shoulders continue to shake. It’s like he can’t help it, which is strange. It’s strange because he’d been so angry just a moment ago, and while it’s perfectly natural for Draco to laugh at him, Potter has
His stomach nowhere near full, Draco chucks his spoon back into his bowl and rises from the table, glowering at everyone who crosses his path until he reaches the doors. He has no classes until late afternoon, and suddenly the idea of leaving the castle for a few hours feels extremely tempting.
“And what about me? I have to put up with Potter,” Draco tries to joke, but it doesn’t work for either of them. He can feel Potter’s anger, made worse by the fear that roils in Draco’s stomach as he feels the eyes of the crowd upon him. “If you have a problem sir, I suggest you take it up with the Ministry. They’re the ones who made the final decision.”
The corner of Malfoy's mouth twitched, the ghost of a smile. "So you can conjure up three syllable words, but can't manage a decent silencing charm?"
to the hospital wing. She has her damn tree.” He juts his chin towards the Christmas tree standing tall and proud in the corner, and doesn’t mention that they hadn’t been able to participate in the tree’s preparation due to the Blaise incident.
Potter’s face clouds over and Draco instantly frowns. Not this again. “He is my friend you know, it’s not as if I’m never going to talk about him. Thanks to your bloody trick, he’s been keeping his distance from me, so don’t start.”
Draco feels his face heat as Harry turns back to the table to speak to the elf. Then he and Hermione are crossing the courtyard.
Draco can feel his heart hammering in his chest, but he doesn’t dare cower under Potter’s intensity. Instead, he matches it with his own, leaning in just as close to lower his voice to a hiss. "Yes, that’s exactly what I think. Because you know me too."
"Who?" Draco wrinkles his nose, reaching for the linen napkin in front of him and draping it across his lap.
"If you're referring to Harry's hunch about Malfoy’s behaviour being correct," Granger continues without missing a beat, "I'm likely to agree with you. Because I'd hate to think you've forgotten the five years prior that Malfoy spent making Harry's life miserable."
Granger is quick to come to Harry's defense. "Harry's obvious when he likes someone, but that isn't his fault. He's just more expressive than most."
Draco shrugs as he stands, testing his weight. He’s annoyed and he can’t tell if the feel is coming from Potter or himself. He knows Potter knows he’s here by the way he won’t look anywhere in their direction and it rankles his nerves. Without another word to Pansy, he pushes out onto the ice and does a lap around the rink, taking pleasure in the way his blades slice into the surface of the ice and the way the cold air burns his cheeks, whips his hair. There’s a shadow of flying to it if he moves fast enough. Draco angles his body low to reduce drag and increases his speed.
“You’re a pig,” Pansy scowls, though her words hold no real bite. “I swear I don’t know who’s worse, you or that succubus that spawned you.” Pansy’s turns back to Parvati, who wears a solemn expression. “I could write her if you’d like?” Pansy offers softly, her voice gentling as she reaches across the table to place a hand over Parvati’s. “I wouldn’t mind, you know. I don’t want you to be alone.”
“And howlers, I suspect,” scowls Potter. His voice softens as he turns to Draco. “I’ll talk to McGonagall. See if she can have them turned back or re-routed. You should probably contact your Mother and.. warn her, I guess?”
Draco bites his lip. He doesn’t know what to think of that. His heart and his libido are running away with their own thoughts as it is. “Tell them you needed time alone to wank or something?”
"Yes, yes, you're very noble and heroic," Draco laughs, rolling his eyes. "Let's both be grateful it's not the other way around. Pansy, Blaise and Theo have been pushing me towards you for years. Now that I've finally managed it, I'll never hear the end of it."
"Hmm." There were quite a few delicious looking chocolate eclairs with his name on them. He buys them, along with Opal’s Pumpkin Pasty, and a few apple tarts for Theo as a last minute impulse. He does not think about Potter’s circumstances or the fact that there are no treacle tarts in the display case. "I guess this is where we make our pleasant goodbye."
At the end of the summer his house arrest would be over. He's already decided he's going to continue seeing Mind Healer Headland. He's going to warm up to Auror Abernathy's constant presence in his home. He may even continue weekly suppers with Squill & Spoon.
say that everyone would have a turn. I believe there’s still a few of your classmates who haven’t had a chance. Mr. Potter, for instance.”
They continue on, turning another corner, and Draco takes in what he can. The part of him that always seeks to hold an advantage is storing as much information as possible for future use. He supposes it’s not very different from the magically preserved pantries of the Manor: there’s baked breads and butchered meats, biscuits, wine, cheese - hey pass a tall display of various juices and Draco wants to stops and examine them, their contents like something out of a potions class.
A pair of feet appears before them. Draco’s eyes trail up from the neatly laced oxfords to the face of one Hermione Granger, who looks shell-shocked to see him sitting next amongst her best friends in front of the fire Gryffindor Common Room. She seems to push that aside, pushes herself to ask, “Do about what?”
Draco opens the latch and the small brown owl flew in, landing on his bureau and holds its leg out expectantly. Draco takes the small roll and unfurls it, his eyes moving rapidly across the page.
Draco's cheeks flush deeply. "Not many are, I'm afraid. You should count yourself lucky, ensnaring my affections is quite a feat, even for the likes of
Karrey opens the door and indicates Draco should pass through. By route, he pulls out his wand and hands it to Karrey, who has yet to produce his box. He fumbles with Draco's wand, almost dropping it, before recovering. Karrey's bat-like ears stand to attention. "Mr. Draco..."
“I think they’ve finally reached some kind of agreement. Hangingbone’s free to stake her claim as long as she dedicates herself to helping Sprout harvest the next batch of leaping toadstools.”
Harry's head shot up, blinking wildly as color and sound came back into focus. Malfoy looked shocked, his entire face red, hands still pressed to his ears. At some point Harry had fallen to his knees.
as he beelines for the other end of the shop. The quills are kept towards the back of the room in a giant display on the wall. Staring at the different models, he attempts to collect himself. Slowly he lowers his hands, watching his reflection in the glass as the urge subsides. His eyes feel damp and Draco wipes at them.
“Of course.” Draco gathers his things, ignoring the way Potter tries to catch his eye. It’s not until he tries to fall into step behind them that not Draco, but Hangingbone takes it upon herself to dismiss him. “I’d really like to speak to Malfoy privately, Mr. Potter. You should finish your packing. Have your trucks ready for the train.”
On and on it went. Draco felt a roiling sense of panic. It was all well and good to be pronounced naughty when no one had cause to believe it was actually valid. There weren’t many standing amongst them that had actually tortured someone. Had been forced to see the things Draco had. Almost two years after the war, he’d finally begun to bridge the gap. Why remind everyone of the past he was trying to get away from?
Harry's hand on his body has stopped moving. It feels heavy on Draco's side, the digits of Harry's hand molding themselves to his skin as his grip tightens ever so slightly. "I wanted to." His voice is thick. Harry coughs to clear it. "I started so many times. Then I told myself it we were ever going to apologize to each other -- really apologize -- we'd have to do it in person."
Draco makes a concentrated effort to keep his gaze from straying to the other side of the table from that moment on. The main course arrives: something Karry calls, "Frozen Pizza," despite the fact that from what Draco can see, not a single ingredient adorning it looks to be at room temperature, let alone frozen. None of the others look to be familiar with it, save Potter, who looks rather bemused. Once everyone has been served, Draco lifts his fork and knife.
From the back of the classroom, a chair scraps the floor with a metallic sound that draws every eye. Just five minutes into class and with the two of them at odds, it was resembling Wimbledon.
“Wrapping presents?” Draco bites back a grin. At the Manor, the elves were in charge of wrapping all the gifts. However Pippi, one of the elves who’d spoiled Draco the most, allowed him to fold the sharp creases when his parents were not looking, to hold the corners while she performed sticking charms. He supposes it’s one of the reasons he loves folding paper so much. “I manage.”
“Fair enough,” Blaise says with a shrug. Pansy looks like she has more to add to that but Blaise stops her with a subtle shake of the head. She frowns but seemingly drops the subject. Instead she turns to Harry, a mischievous smile curving her lips.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco answers. “But it might do you better to ask Potter, than me. All I can offer is that you’re cutting way more paper than you need, and if you were to just fold that corner over the other, your wrapping wouldn’t be anywhere near as abysmal.”
takes a turn and you are no exception. Pass the hat along, then, the sun will set eventually.” She sings with a claps her hands.
A few minutes later, Potter returns: he’d ducked down to the kitchens to bring them all piping hot mugs of hot chocolate, decorated lovingly by the elves with marshmallows that looked like snowmen, smiling up at them as they drank. There were sprigs of cinnamon in each cup and perfectly sweetened.
The house elf -- Corey? Cappy? -- holds out the box for a second time. "Please Mr.Draco, Karrey will be in trouble if he can not verify all wands are present."
as allowed without risking spell damage, and your Bubble-head Charm broke as soon as she opened her mouth." Crouching on his knees, he tore a large strip of the silver adhesive. Considered the enraged expression of their Siren captive and tore another. "It's lucky for us the
Weasley grins as the others hoot and cheer. Potter, who still seemed to be in a mood, offers a small grin, clapping Weasley on the back.
Draco slaps his hand down on the counter as a belly laugh knocks him off his feet. His stomach actually hurts he’s laughing so hard. He has to grip the smooth wood to keep himself upright. Still gripping Scrivenshaft’s soiled handkerchief in one hand.
The thirty-first of July finds Draco sitting at the Manor's kitchen table, staring out the window. The sky outside is a fiery orange turning blue, bleeding into the night. It reminds Draco of the night at the conservatory, the night he'd first kissed Harry Potter.
Because, well, the Potter in front of him is... fit. Better than he'd been in school. Better than the last time he'd seen him, right after the mission when they'd hesitantly parted ways at the Ministry, Draco lingering at the end of the hall, too stupid to form the words with his mouth that he’d eventually forced himself to write down . Now, Potter's dark hair falls haphazardly over his forehead to cover his scar, searching Draco’s face with a vaguely impatient expression. . Draco clears his throat.
It’s like his touch trips a wire, unleashing something wild in Draco that has his hands on Potter at once, rucking up his jumper to pull the tails from his trousers.
“I thought it might be better to discuss your situation somewhere others wouldn’t overhear. You’ve been the topic of conversation long enough, wouldn’t you say?”
The satisfaction Draco entertains, at the idea of watching Potter get booted from tonight’s proceedings on account of obviously being in the wrong location, is short-lived; Karrey arrives mere seconds later to collect Potter’s wand, all but confirming that yes, it is in fact Harry Potter's seat, and yes, thank you Mr. Draco,there is nothing wrong with Karrey’s eyesight, please sit down.
Above their heads, Peeves continues to rattle his chains, cackling one last time before swooping through the opens doors to take his mischief elsewhere.
Pansy leans in, whispering under her breath. "I think there's someone who wants to proposition you first."
"I wouldn’t want to bore you." Draco spies Potter watching him out of the corner of his eye, his shoulders tense. The sight of it is like a challenge to Draco, his own muscles growing tight as irritation lances down his spine. "This supper club came highly recommended. I suppose I’ve’ never been opposed to keeping good company."
Harry looks confused. "But your sentence was only one year. I remember from the trial. How could you grow all those things?"
