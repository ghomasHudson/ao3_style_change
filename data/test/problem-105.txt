She got up from her seat, coming to me and tug my sleeves. I frowned at her as I was still angry at her for that incident.
Shaking, I inhaled deeply and realize that my every encounter of the house-elves that I tried to save clearly fear it and I am angry with my ignorance and arrogance. Now, I know what was Malfoy was talking about. I was only seeing the light side, My own point of view.
"Hungry, that much?" Finally, Malfoy spoke as he smirks in my direction.
Then the wall of barrier came crashing down.
-----------------------------------------------
"Harry. I prefer a 'thank you' than of 'a sorry'," He said, titled his head down as I look up at him.
"I guess, Harry already knows that not all is simple, right?" Draco said as he kneaded my knuckles and laid his head on one of the shoulders.
What a great way to start the day, Ugh!
Shit!!! I couldn't stand this...not knowing any longer what to do.
Chapter 17: Warm Hope
"Wicked!" Ron gasped loudly as his mouth open wide with awe and eyes bulging from amazement. I grinned back at his comment. Indeed it is.

"Call me Hermione."
'Ugly, Mudblood'
Chapter 20: WATER from your Eyes (PART 1)
"Don't go gussy up about those snacks. They are not that good" Mrs. Weasley abashed by those words of compliment.
"What did you say?!" He growled at me.
'Where was Harry? Was he safe?'
I roll my eyes. A Malfoy is still a Malfoy. A Slytherin is still Slytherin. And he is both of those.
We headed right thru the thick woods not waiting for our barrier to be completely be broken by the Acromantulas. Abandoning our tent, we were only armed by our wands and with Hermione is the beaded bag. We run like wolves, skidding and leaping over rocks and overgrown roots of the trees, not longer than two minutes, a crashing sound was heard.
"Have you thought of talking to them?" He probed forward as he laid his hand over mine.
"A Hemotropic butterfly is a crimson-colored butterfly that lived in the deepest part of the forbidden forest or could be found in Zevil Island. They are harmless insects that are attracted to the scent of blood and feed on the wounds of bigger creatures." Hermione said in an exasperated voice.
"Of course, Mate. We're best mates." Ron smiled at me. "After all, we're called Golden Trio"
I stared at him as my eyes widen and whispered, "Yes."
I saw what she meant, at the table in front of Malfoy, is a single flower - a white lily tied with a silk black ribbon. A symbol of mourning. I totally forgotten my sinking feeling of disappointment for Sirius' letter not arriving, it was nothing to what Malfoy should be feeling right now. His brother, who died long ago. Murder unjustly by a group of muggles. Then now somebody disrespected his brother's grave and even had the tenacity to steal his body.
"Gulon can control-l its shape...hah..hahaha...and size to...enter any spa-space." Hermione huffs her sentence as her breath was still ragged and gasping for air.
"What happened, Harry?" She shouted, outside the stall that I was in.
I closed my eyes.
'Hehehe... have you forgotten about me?' The female voice asked. A very familiar one. It came to me, all suddenly as I recognized her voice. My Demon!
Okay, I got it. I am in love with Draco Freaking Malfoy. My ex-enemy, an arrogant prick, a pureblood, and finally, a male. Hey! There's nothing wrong with being gay but in my entire life, up to this point, I thought I was straight not until Draco.
"Hell!" I answered with a grunt. "Surprise that I am in control for the first time but still disgustingly hungry."
"Just insulted me?" Malfoy repeated in a whisper.
"Shut up, Granger." He said in a very unusual calm manner then brought the knife to his left hand and slice across it. He cut up his own hand! "Malfoy! What hell are doing?!" I said as the blood drained off my face. Ignoring me, the blood from his hand was dripping fast but as soon as Malfoy did cut his hand, Harry started to struggle more. "What is happening? You are making it worst, Malfoy!"
"Both of you are late," Hermione said as we sat down. "You almost missed dinner."
"I'm fine, Ron." I said as I leaned away from him. To avoid being spit on. "She just spoke that's why the pain came."
"Sorry about that,  Harry. I want to make sure to keep us both safe. Don't worry, I will remove those chains when I am sure that you are in full control of your urges." Hermione said she came sitting beside me.
"Okay, then sleep after drinking this." He offered the teacup again.
"Mind your own business, Malfoy" Sirius barked.
And as I waved the snitch to the Gryffindors, loud cheers burst from the crowd. I slowly landed on the ground as my teammates' run-up to surround me. Almost breaking my neck as the twins lunged at me than settling their arms on my shoulder. Ron also came with a wide grin as if it was about to slip his face into two from being too wide. Ginny slide between the cheering guys and landed a kiss on my cheek that invited teasing yaps from them. The festive vibe erupted in the middle of the field as gleeful shouts, merry hollers, and delighted squalls can be heard from the distance.
"AH...That would make sense." I agreed with her.
"Draco..." I snapped from my dazed then controlled the flames to stop until it vaporized. I stood panting, clenching my hands as I tried to relaxed. Exhaustion washed over me like I was weak from not eating for a week. My knees buckled and I slammed to the ground as my conscience started to fade.
"And what it was, Mr. Malfoy?" Professor Dumbledore asked with sympathy.
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Weasley. Lyra will be grateful for it" Draco said with content.
"Bloody Hell, Malfoy!" Ron bellowed as he witnessed Malfoy tearing his own hand.
"Maybe. I should really stop, Harry. You don't look so good." She mumbled as she looks at me in concern.
I sighed again. Hermione really knows all of it.
Wait a minute. A bed!
Hermione suddenly sat up straight then lean forward the table as she tries to reach my fidgeting hands. "What do you mean 'getting worse', Harry? You said that they have been subsiding? How worse? What kind of nightmares?"
"Yes. She just keeps on visiting and urging me to eat." I continue.
"That's odd" She spoke. Her voice was laced with surprise and confusion.
“Then. Why?” I asked him.
“I would! I like to!” I answered with so much vigor that made him, laugh at my antics. Yet, his laughter made me feel so hazy from its sound, and a small electric tingle passes by my whole body with so much glee. ‘Shit! I feel like I just like those squealing girls. This is so embarrassing!!!’
Ron and I went down the stairs, yawning. As we reached the kitchen - dining area, Mrs. Weasley had panic and a grave look on her face as she was talking to someone with the use of a two-way mirror. I can't hear the words but her tone of voice was shaking as if something extremely bad had happened.
Shrieking and growling as I snap my jaws, as I force my body to twist against the ropes, breaking my skin and making me bleed. Raking my claws against the tree as they got tore.
'You're dying, Harry.' She spoke, gently. 'Don't you want to live, Harry?'
I silence myself as I bowed my head down, afraid that he would notice my flushed face and my ogling.
"How are you feeling?" She asked.
My mind can't seem to process what had just happened. Especially, the part where Draco smiled at us or even the part he apologized. And what so weird is the part that both Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Remus, and even Sirius seem to understand the whole situation.
Before me,  was a shocked Hermione as she realized that I was awake. I felt extremely awkward and scared as I remember the way I have singularly chased after my best friend to murder her and, even I want to justify myself as I was not in my right mind when I did it. I still did it intending to harm her. I felt ashamed and disgusted with myself. Lowering my head as I couldn't bear to look at her, in guilt.
Blushing the both of us, as we stumbled in our feet. "Don't you dare say or do anything?" Ginny grumbled as she glared at her brothers.
"Bastard!" Ron hollered in anger. His whole face turns red, making him look like a tomato. "Are you saying I am selling my sister to Harry?!"
' Just as I said I am seeing the things that you see through your eyes' She said in a bored manner as if she was explaining something to an elementary child.
"I see." He said sternly. "You all shouldn't be here. After all, the quidditch field had been scheduled to be preserved to us Gryffindor for our practices. If you wish to confront some issues. You should do it in another place."
"As the owner of this house, I have to see to myself if somebody is trying to wretch my things, even if it's only a mirror." He uttered as he raised one of his eyebrows at me.
My thoughts and my disobedient heart that had gone wild that got me so distracted and I didn't notice the other person's action. Suddenly, Draco tackles me and firmly hugged me. Caught off guard, I was first shocked, and then slowly, my face turned red.
"Harry." Hermione whispered. "Stop."
"You're in a daze again, Harry." Hermione whispered at me.
------------------------------------------------------------------
"Oops" Sirius jokingly said in a sing-song tone.
Chapter 20: Water from you Eyes (PART 02)
I don't exactly know what happened after the first two acromantulas rush onto us, clicking their pincers rapidly but what I do know is before any of them was able to touch Hermione, I got to them first. And I also know that for the first time after being condemned in this hellish situation, I am free at last.
Could I really die in my sleep? Will this ever stop? Could I still wake up? Will I ever have peace? Please stop. Please.
"Cough it out, Malfoy!" Ron grumbled as he too had arrived and had been watching the whole exchange up until now. "What got Harry to do with you or the notebook that you are holding? You're disturbing the whole practice."
"I'm..." I stuttered as I searched in my block mind for any excuse. "- just not that hungry but the food is great, Mrs. Weasley."
Who is the real Draco Malfoy? Cold to every stranger, a kind brother to his dead brother, obedient child to his parents, and brutal and cuel to his enemies...
"What?" I dumbfounded uttered. Then I realized that my legs were shaking and Harry was already laid on a white soft-looking couch.
"Yes, Of course," I said with much vigor. Her being had given me much courage to live on.
Draco and I cried "Hermione!" in unison.
According to Hermione and based on the books that they have researched on, along with Malfoy's apparent testimony with the pureblood's heritage, a Strigoi is a creature that has risen from the dark side, akin to the ancient vampires and werewolves as they have bottomless lust for blood and flesh of any being and losing their sanity for the unbearable hunger that curses them.
"Harry." He whispered as he gazed at me and slowly stood up, waltz towards me. "Are you okay?"
Realizing that he was voicing out his concern for me, it was Malfoy's turn for his whole face to turn red. His face became more alluring as his face is being beautified by his blush. Oh, God, I must be going out of my mind!
"It was all a coincidence, Harry. No need for any guilt or what-so-ever that is running in your head. I was sent here by my parents as a vacation. For me to clear my mind because of my misconduct behavior by cutting somebody's tongue. That's all to it," He grinned at me.
"Really?" I asked as my curiosity took my interest. "What's your theory?"
I screamed in my head as hot tears fell from my eyes as hatred, anger, and remorse flooded and almost sweep me away. This is not fair, my life and everything!
I flew back and slammed to the ground as I grunted in pain. The creature stood over me, leering at me. The monster was tall, grayish in color with bulging muscles over his shoulders to his arms and thighs to his legs. Nails so sharp that they can tear flesh with ease. His powerful handheld a wooden club.
“How? Where?” Hermione asked in a surprised tone. She was just as bewildered as me at the thought of us hunting in the deep forest.
I smiled slowly as she laughs but the happiness doesn't reach my heart. Is it really that simple?
A smile on my face appeared as I raised the Snitch up in the air, waving it with vigor. The palpable fear within me had vanished as soon as the match started, being in the air really soothes me.
Settling down on the cushion chairs, laid on the table where a pot of steaming chicken soup and a basket full of warm bread. I sat beside Hermione while across us is Draco, and yet again shocking me out from my system, sitting beside him, is his House-elf, Tiffany.
"Harry, mate. Are you alright?" Ron asked as he entered the room. I look up to him from my staring, out the window. I could see his pale face, freckles standing out as he looks at me with concern.
"Yes, I do," Malfoy said. "After all, I didn't take her by force. She chose me as her king"
Draco spoke to us that, it was fine for us to use his tiny manor since no one can enter except for him and his bonded house-elf, Tiffany. He also told us that the manor is surrounded by anti-detection, anti-trespassing, and protective barriers. He assured us that we are welcome to stay. He even gave us the password and key for us to able to access the place.
"Ah," I said. 'Just like me'
I saw uncertainty in Michael's eyes as he gazes upon at Ginny's pained expression but soon disappeared as he saw me walking up to Ginny's side and wrapping both my arms around her waist to comfort her. He growled as soon as Ginny snuggled at my neck. His face morphed into something else, a mixture of anger and jealousy.
Hanging my head in defeat, I finally uttered. "I have no idea, Malfoy."
"Harry, what are you doing dilly dally on the corridor? March to the field, Potter!!" He shouted at my right ear. Pain erupted in my ear as his voice had seemed to have broken my right eardrum. Hermione tried to fight the hold that Oliver had on me. Both of us protesting but can't seem to reach the determined Oliver as he shouted more to us "We have matched to WIN! So stop whining, Potter! Granger!"
Pain and anger crawled around my chest on all fours until I was panting from the ugly, familiar feeling. Then in vengeance, my hunger kicks me in the guts, hard and fast. With the swirl of anger, pain, and hunger, I swayed then shifted as fast I can to maintain my balance.
I cried.
"I..." I began but couldn't continue.
Harry understands the pain of the Malfoys and his troubles with appearance of the female demon.
Even with my dazed mind and Hermione's chattering of 'now we are safe', deep down I know that we are cornered with no option to escape from the Acromantulas, and in the way of Hermione's grim facial expression, I also know the barrier won't last long before the Acromantulas could actually break through it.
Someone nudged me. "Harry, it's almost finished. The sorting" Ron smiled at me. "Food please hurry up"
Looking over at him, he was wearing a turtle neck white sweater, gray khaki pants and to my surprise, he was bare-footed. My face must have looked ridiculous as Malfoy raised an eyebrow at me and Hermione giggled at my side. I started to get embarrassed as I realize that my mouth was wide open from being caught off guard. Then suddenly, I remembered Malfoy's hand.
The mystery of the beginning of a tale starts to unfold as Harry is submerged in his dreams and reality mixing.
"You say it only came to me?" I asked for further. I couldn't believe my luck! All along with the explanation to my problem is just within my reach.
Then, suddenly my ears picked up a rustling sound. I stood up, alarmed. "Guys, I think it's not the right time to think about this stuff right now."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"It's fine, Harry. I know that you are still having problems with whatever that is bothering you. Nightmares? That's suck." Ron said as he was hovering beside me with his broom. I can see he was trying to understand my current situation. "Hermione had told me, all about it. Just remember, we're here for you. For always."
I stood up slowly and laid a hand on her back to comfort her. We were having the same problems.
I’ve never thought of him dying, that right now the pain is unbearable. I would not have imagined it to be like this.
Malfoy stood few feet away from us, wand out and lowered as he finishes firing the Incarcerous spell. I stood there, staring at him as I was a complete shock and at the same time, weirdly mesmerized by the way he looks and that he, in fact, defended me from Michael.
"BASTARD!" Michael growled at Malfoy, tensing with every muscle in his body. I can see that he really wanted to attack Malfoy if it weren't for the damage he received from my punch.
'The over-grown bat!!!'
I couldn't mask the pained expression that had surfaced from my face as I was also attacked with remorse and sadness as I remember the way - Ginny, Ron, and everybody's reaction to Harry's transformation. I couldn't defend them to Malfoy's accusation for I know too well that they did push Harry away.
"Please leave some of Harry for me" Another spoke with gentle raspiness in his voice.
"Did Ron passed his pig-virus on you?" Ginny said with a disturbed look on her face. "Because that would be bad."
'Thank you, Hermione. Thank you, Malfoy.'
I tensed as I heard him. My heart slam against my chest and my throat dried up, almost immediately. "What have I become, Draco?"
"Potter." Said a quiet, calm, and confident voice behind me. As I felt the tug on my shirt, I turn towards Malfoy, who was standing near me.
"This had been going on for the past two weeks, Harry." She gingerly whispered. "It's worsening. It's odd."
Ron and I tried to come up with different meanings to the wobble and disfigured shapes of our own tea leaves - interpreting it with the doom and gloom depictions. As boring as Divination is - loads of gibberish - at least, it wasn't as heavy as Ancient Runes that could make our heads bleed from thinking. That's why even Divination is my second least favorite subject - is a passable versus potion.
Just hungry.
I slowly walk out with both of my hands up in the air as a way of non-verbal communicating that I meant no harm. As soon as Malfoy saw me, he relaxes his stance but still had his guard up.
"Severus." A familiar voice called out.
"Darah Naga" I muttered, quietly. As I felt a tinge of jealousy directed to the Queen butterfly. 'Good for you! Someone is caring for you, unconditionally' I whispered to the butterfly on Malfoy's head.
"Your intention is good but the result will be devastating." He said seriously. "Your goal will cause death for the house-elves. Their extinction."
-------------------------------------------------
"Yes, I did," Malfoy answered cooly, not denying anything.
"Are you done?" A voice came from behind me. I turned immediately and saw  Draco Malfoy from the door.
Still, dazed, I look at the tray - a bowl of porridge and a glass of milk and I look at the vial at my lap, I smiled. Would you look at that! Who might have guessed that there was a cute side on Malfoy?
"You bet, Seam-" Ron got interrupted as the compartment door slid open with force.
"I..." I started but I couldn't find words to continue. "I..."
A smile managed to slip out my lips as I grumbled at myself because even I want to prevent myself from investing more feelings for him because of my non-closure relationship with Ginny but I guess I already damned to be a sinner cause I know I already deeply interested with Draco.
"Diffindo!" I cried out and the spider that was near me was hit. I blinked rapidly, staggering to my feet as I strained myself to stand and shaking away the pain that is pulsing on my shoulder from the attack of the smaller acromantula and from the hunger pains that are steadily erupting in my stomach.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
"What news?" I glanced at her.
Nothing mattered. But my hunger and his blood. My mouth watered and my throat burned like fire. My stomach twisted and my muscles coiled ready to spring at my prey.
Trying to calm down my instinct, I kept myself from fighting the chains but instead settled down to sit up as I tried to gaze upon Hermione, now my only friend. "It's alright, Hermione. I understand."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slowly glancing at the other person in the room, as my curiosity and my short-lived courage urge me, my body froze as soon as I caught a glimpse of him. He was staring at me with such intensity and a lazy and pleased smile appeared on his pink and plum lips. A hot rush spread throughout my body, I felt too warm underneath my skin and a chill electrifies me to the bones. I told myself to breathe as I become nervous and giddy at the same time.
"Huh?" I uttered as I raised my head to look at him with complete shock embedded on my face.
Both Ron and Hermione's faces had gone pale as they indeed recall it. They slowly both nodded, knowing that I am to say something very serious and terrifying. Especially, Hermione. Since both I and Hermione were the most affected ones in that accident.
How can they not fear me?
There was a rustling sound from somewhere as I slowly woke from my nap.  I must have been too tired to had to sneak asleep. I stood up and began to search for the source of the sound. Cautionary, walking through the bushes, I spotted the source. A person with blond hair. It appears to be a male. I hid behind the leaves of the trees as I watch. As he turns, I recognized him - Malfoy. The irony, the most annoying person to me suddenly is making my day a bit better more recently and now he is popping out when you least expect him to show up.
"H-Ha-Harry?" Someone called out.
"Harry, what took you so long?" Hermione said as soon as she saw me.
"NO!!! That's mine." Michael shouted as he losses his temper and made a charge towards Malfoy. Making an angry sound in his throat as he went for the dive.
As I open eyes after finishing that delectable dish, I realized everybody was staring at me, with an exception of Tiffany, with a mixture of relief and amusement on their expression.
Blushing, the house-elf returns to her seat as she continued with her breakfast. Draco took his time into cutting the meat into length-wise strips then placed some on my croissant then pass it on to me.
Hermione's whole face turned to crimson shade as she looked down and murmured. "I'm sorry, Professor." Apparently, being caught breaking the rules really do get  Hermione. It was really our fault but he didn't have to take a jab at Hermione.
I burst to a run, without anything on my mind as I leaped away. My only thought is to seek safety from the hypocrites that ones had called themselves as my friend. Focusing only on running far away from where they couldn't follow me anymore, in where I can't hear their voices that scream 'Monster' nor where I can't see their faces that show disgust and fear.
"That's good and all but that doesn't explain why are you tampering with my food," I said, still confused with the whole situation.
5. Werewolf (This could have been a better option by Harry) (transformation per full moon, eats raw blood and meat, enhance senses - so its a NO by Hermione)
"I say it like that because usually, half-borns don't get any Inheritance even they are at the right age." He answered me willingly.
"And under the ancient wizardly law, it is the right punishment that the owner of the locket of inheritance should do. If Draco did not do so, then Ms. Vane should have been called to a court to be imprisoned in the Azkaban for, let say 5-10 years." Snape spoke in a droning manner.
We stayed like that, in each other's arms, crying in relief that we did not lose each other.
"We're fine, Professor McGonagall," I said as I stood up to approach her.
----------------------------------------
"Hi Luna," Harry said awkwardly as he sat beside her while Ron and Hermione sat on the other side.
She was smiling friendly at me like she was fascinated by the view. The view of me, soaked with blood. Me, who is becoming addicted to the taste of blood in my mouth.
"Really, Ron" Hermione scowled as she stomps on Ron's foot.
‘Shit! Shit! Stop, Harry! You have Ginny! Stop crushing on Draco Malfoy!’
Draco's poised posture and his elegance made me swallow as my mouth, which was full of spit as I was salivating from the site that I was seeing. Then, suddenly, he took a sprint - his steps were so light and soundless - and on his hand, he has his wand ready to strike at any time - like a sharp dagger.
"I am not an idiot, Granger. Please do be reminded of that. You might be the most intelligent witch in our year but I am the most cunning wizard of our batch." He spoke in a smug manner as he arrogantly eyed me. "I know Potter was turned away from Hogwarts. If not, why do the two of you have been hiding in the forest away from Harry Potter's so-called friends and protectors?"
'Gurg...GURGG...'
"They left earlier but they will be back. Unfinished business they say." Ginny smiled, sweetly at me as caress my hand under the table. I smiled back as well as I squeezed her back. Ginny fluttered her eyelids at me, which made me wish we were alone instead of eating breakfast together with her family and offered me pumpkin juice which I accepted. The twins hooting and whistling as they saw us, making both of us blushed.
I grin at her.
I had to freshen up and dressed before I could go down for breakfast that day. I left Ron snoring on his bed in a deep sleep. Hearing the commotion from the first floor, happy voices sounded out, I went down the stairs.
He shrugged both of his shoulders in a relaxed and arrogant manner, which frustrates me to no end.
Hagrid took a step back as Malfoy finished his speech. "But the blade, Mr. Malfoy!"
01. Eccentric Encounter
I hope too, Hermione. I do hope so...
I felt peace for the first time since my unfortunate transformation. My body felt free with no pain or unquenching hunger.
"Ahmmm...." Ron turned to hot red then pale-grey as he was directed by the glare of Snape.
"I see..." Hermione finally said after a long silence reign between us. Then she suddenly snapped out of it. "I have a theory for that but before anything else, Harry. Let's get out of here."
Do strong-founded relationship are easy to build?
"What do mean 'you can't' ?" Malfoy asked as he slowly turns to me, curious about what I have to say.
You two told me that I am part of your family. FRED! GEORGE!
"You look better." Ginny commented as she stared at my face. She looks so beautiful. Her chocolate brown eyes to her cheeks adored by freckles - a trait that eventually is handed down to all Weasleys. Her flaming red hair that she keeps long.
Beautiful creatures can be dangerous. Be careful. Harry...
"A success on what?" I asked as I was trying to understand them.
Malcolm Baddock took off the hat and went straight to the Slytherin table where the occupants applauded as he took his seat. I could see Malfoy clapping in a regal manner as Baddock joined them but something was odd. The way that Baddock head first to Malfoy, giving him a slight bow was kind of...unnerving. Maybe in the Slytherin, you have to acknowledge the senior first before you can be a part of them but that would be nonsense since if that is supposed to be then why Malfoy? It should have been the 6th years or even the 7th years, that Baddock should offer his respect, right?
"What now, POTTER. Getting your gang to defend you." Michael snared as he looks up to see Ron, Fred and George slowly approached him.
I grow pale as he explains to me everything and dread grew within me. 'What have I done?'
And that's what had happened that morning.
----------------------------------------------------------------
I can taste it – metallic- addictive, exquisite, and…
"Yes. Mr. Corner." Pomfrey spoke. "Mr. Potter is dead."
"Who's there?" Malfoy shouted as his whole body made a stance, guarded, and ready to fight. The queen also hovers, ready to protect Malfoy for any threat.
"You should give it up as I did, Harry," Hermione said as she pointed her fork at me then took some jam and started spreading on her toast. "It's a nonsense subject. You should get some sensible ones like Arithmancy or Advance Alchemy."
"So, this case closed." Headmaster Dumbledore said as he stood up.
A stoic man, long pale blond hair, dressed in what seems to be expensive black dress robes, Mr. Lucius Malfoy and behind him, was a mini version of him, shoulder-length and almost white hair, also clothed with expensive robes but instead of black, his was White to silver in color, Draco Malfoy.
“I want to compare them from the previous data, there might be another development in terms of skills or feature that might have to escape your notice.” He explained in his cool and alluring voice.
An unfamiliar room. I try to search through my memory for any clue as to where I was. For the moment, I was safe but panic started to erupt in my chest as an urgent question pop out from my head.
I sighed again as I climbed down the stairs and reached the living room while I re-arrange my dark grey shirt, black baggy cargo pants, and laced up high cut hunting boots.
"What are you all laughing about?"
"That's another thing!" Hermione hollered suddenly. "And those men that were following us, who they were?" Realizing that she was shouting at the top of voice, she blushed then turns to me. "Sorry... I just got a bit of..."
Draco looked at my eyes as he seems to search for answers but I couldn't wait for any more seconds, I just want his lips on mine then I pull him and devour those tempting lips.
But alas, I was caught off guard by the rush of emotions as I felt tears fall from my eyes.
"I don't know, Ron," Hermione said seriously. "I need to research that locket even Britain's old council of wizards and witches."
So I run and tears fell.
“HARRY!” somebody shouted.
"Mom! Stop smoldering Harry." George said as he stood at the door frame.
"Anyway, I would want to say my 'thanks' to you, Malfoy, for helping us." I desperately trying to change the direction of his gaze. "Thank you," I said, sincerely as I looked at his eyes.
"Immature brat." He coughed out as he steps a little closer to me. My hand went straight to my wand hidden under my pants' pocket, ready to pull it out to cast a spell against him.
The first thing that I did hear was crying. No. That was wrong. It was more than crying, it was the kind of desolate sobbing that comes from a person drained of all hope. But who? I still feel heavy and I can't open my eyes. So I waited and listened more. Beside me, I heard some footsteps near my head then a warm hand resting on the side of my neck, like this person was feeling my pulse.
----------------------------------------------
' I did say you were dead but now you're alive. I made you possible to be alive. After all, we made a deal.'
I can feel it, all over my skin: thick and cold.
"We are tampering your food to finally see if all the theories we had come up with, so far, were true and as we saw your reaction to the soup that you are eating then that concludes that our experiment is a success." This time, Hermione answered my question.
"Then, we will go tomorrow" I sighed with relief. "Thanks, guys"
"Mr. Malfoy!" Hagrid also shouted in panic.
"Immaturity?!" I roared at him. "That's my Godfather. That is missing!"
"Yes," Hermione answered, slowly. "It's fine now. I have been having a few but it gradually decreasing. How about you, Harry?"
Before I could take a bite, Draco called out for my attention. “Yes?” I asked as I was holding the croissant before my lips. I was seriously hungry.
Speaking about serious stuff, I remember that I need to ask about those ruins. After all, it had been the start of my nightmares, and it's where my demon came from.
3. Jiangshi (I am not hopping around, Moine by Harry) (Stop that, Harry. not to Undead that hops, I don't know with the taking life force from the living creature by Hermione)
“Hunt?!” Both Hermione and I asked at the same time with flabbergasted expressions on our faces.
------------------------------------------------------------------
"No. I  haven't any. Thanks to the Dreamless potion." I replied. Instead of nightmares, I was having another problem.
"What are you going to do with that knife to Harry, Malfoy?" I shouted, loudly.
Laughing, Hermione with her good nature, patted me at my shoulder – reassuring me that I look just fine and making me relax. I glanced at Malfoy with great anticipation.
He smirked at me. "Why, Granger. Even if I did, Do you have proof even if it might all be true?"
I felt it - an icy feeling engulf me from head to toe, like a bucket of ice water had been throw at me. I looked back. Dread came at me and fear started to sink in as I saw it. It wasn’t water that has drenched me.
That morning, the sun came through the clouds lighting the window of the Great Hall as we descended and arrived at our table, examining our schedule at breakfast. A few seats from us were the twins and their friend, Lee Jordan whispering secretly about something - maybe about their new planned prank that we are going to find out sooner or later.
'Ah, Yes indeed." I thought as I spend a lingering stare at the way they have gone off to.
"What was that Mr. Weasley?" Snape asked acidly at us.
After a minute of silence, I murmured. "Yes, Headmaster."
"Harry lay down for a bit," George said as he stood outside the comfort room. There was a gentle patting on my back, Ginny was already by my side, comforting me.

"Thanks, Ron" I smiled at him. "And yeah, your right. It sucks!"
"Harry." Hermione gently called out to me.
Before Hermione could reach me, Ron came in front of her, trying to protect her from something. As Ron's eyes blazed, I realize that he was protecting Hermione from me. Me!
"CORNER!" I growled as I landed with a loud thud, two meters away from them. Surprising them, with my sudden appearance as they jolted with panic upon seeing me. They haven't expected to be discovered by someone as they look like deers caught in the middle of the road by a rushing car.
I sat between Ginny and Hermione, then greeted the others - Good morning, and they greeted back. Ron, later on, stumbled from our room, still sleepy that resulted in being reprimanded by his mother. The twins usually teased their brother with their favorite nickname of him - Ronnikins. I joined with the laughing as he was also teased by his sister, Ginny. I took some of the strips of beacons and an egg, as the breakfast begins.
Ron dived to grabbed the plates of food and he took a huge bite on one of the chicken legs. Meanwhile, Hermione was scolding him for shouting while her face was red - clearly embarrassed by Ron praising her. Really, if the two of them could stop dancing around from each other. It will be a lot better.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"It's n-not Harry's fault" Still trembling, as I spoke and unsuccessfully trying to control my eagerness to help my friend and my fear from my not so long time ago terrifying experience. "He just went out of control from the Acromantulas' attack."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"It seems to be a Jade..." Professor Trelawney said in awe. "Well, that's is something!"
Anything.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What are you going to do with that knife to Harry, Malfoy?!" The female shouted.
Sighing, I slowly got up and followed after her. When Hermione is determined, no one can stop her. Upon arriving at Myrtle's bathroom, we entered. It seems to be Myrtle wasn't there to bothered us, I went to a stall and open my shirt, to see if there was still damage but as I reached the buttons in the middle of my shirt, I froze and started to gasp as I panic. My gasping was heard as Hermione pounded on the stall's door.
Draco was already panting in pain and anger as he stops in his mid-sentence. It was too much for him to relay to us - the pain was there I could see it too well and I could understand it very much.
But alas, I was caught off guard by the rush of emotions as I felt tears fall from my eyes.
There's definitely something wrong about me.
"What do the Young Miss needs?" A small voice asked out from no-where.
"Let's do that," I said as I hurriedly march in front of her, trying to find an area to camp as soon as possible.
Oh shit! Bad Harry!
Thank you for being here, Hermione!
"Yes..." I lied. "Just tried."
"Ah! Tod'y, Mr. Malfoy w'll bring it!" Hagrid said excitedly. "He said he had one."
--------------------------------------------
"What is it?" Hermione turned towards us, as she eyeing our join hands with mischievousness and amusement. I coughed out in embarrassment.
"Don't call me that." I scowled at him, indignified from being called cute. "...And stop hugging me, it might lead me to assume something else," I whispered the last part.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
Recognizing the voice, I woke up from my dazed state as I stood up and scramble to my feet as I look at our savior.
"I guess?" I answered with a question. I seriously have forgotten that I was injured since it wasn't hurting that much.
'Deal? What kind of?'
Seeing him uptight with my inquiring, a dreadful feeling bloomed inside my chest. My ignorance of the situation hurt his feelings. "I didn't mean to upset you. It's just very unusual."
From the previous chapter:
I have bent the knee as I surrender to my heart and to the walking temptation, which is Draco.
Sweat poured out profusely, soaking my skin. I could hear my heart beats loudly in my ribcage. As my nerves wreak havoc within me.
Sighing heavily, he took his coffee-sipping silently before speaking again. "Granger, some people are a strong believer of light and dark.  For them, there is no space for the gray side. If you are evil then you're only evil. If you are good, for them, you are only good. There is no neutral. For them, there is only black and white. Do you get what I mean, Granger? That is the philosophy of the society that we are living with, today."
Rejection.
"I have been researching these past few days before I escape from Hogwarts. In those books, there have been clues on what might have happened and what have you become, Harry." Hermione stated as she absent-mindedly reminisces her facts hunting in the library. "I tried feeding you fresh animal blood and it seems like it kind of work out. And I am here because I am your friend, Harry. What a silly question!"
After putting the pie in the oven, he took a step back as if admiring his work then also sat down in one of the chairs, opposite to me.
INCARCEROUS!!!"
Said a quiet musical and child-like voice. The way my name was spoken was sensual, soft, and spine-chilling. As if a child had mingled her voice with a snake – hissing like a soft satin. “I see that you are relishing my gift to you.”
"Okay," I replied. The six of us made our way out of the Great hall towards our classes.
She fears me.
"It's fine." He said with an amused tone. "I lived, right?"
No rejection.
"Do you regret it? Will you apologize?" Professor McGonagall asked further.
I couldn't tell him the reason because only a lunatic can see another person in the mirror and even hear voices in one's head.
"Shit!!!" I cursed out loud.
Waiting for him to stop his hysterical moment, I stared at him, annoyingly. Then, he stops as he wipes the tears from his eyes from too much laughing.
I almost smile at Hermione's chattering. Trust Hermione to be calm in these kinds of situations. "I am not silly, Hermione." Then I froze. "Escape?"
Then, a burst of well profound laughter sounded from him as he found my situation funny, clutching his side from laughing too hard.
He slowly took the newspaper from my hands as he remains by my side and his eyes run all over the article as he finishes reading, a flash of disdain and grimace was etched across his face.
"So, I guess it's not about the blood." He contemplates then continue after a minute. "but it's the act of taking from us - is what you are disturbed about, right?" He asked with a calm and understanding tone that surprise me so much as I could not help but openly gawk at him with an unabashed expression on my face.
Unable to believe my own eyes as I saw who was it. I walk up to him, slowly. "Malfoy?"
But the last words that he left, still linger in my head. "Just because her nature is to eat flesh and drink blood, should I abandon her? Even if she never inflicted any pain to others, should I fear her? It's just a part of her and not her whole being."
"Hmmp...that's not the reason, why I am worried about it." Hermione gave a nasty glare at Ron, which made her almost lose her footing.
"What was it?" Ginny sat beside me as she looks up to her, waiting for her answer. Hermione then sat across me and began loading her plate with a piece of bread before paying attention to the conversation.
"I am not accusing of anything!!!" The feeling of panic still racing under my skin, as I shook my head and wave my arms.
"Draco." Hermione, who has been quiet this whole ordeal, spoke at last. "Thus, this means Harry can only replenish himself by eating creatures with magical abilities?"
Giving in as I pulled his face over and kissed him deeply, pushing my tongue into his mouth aggressively. Draco moaned softly in the back of his throat, as I lightly chew on his lips and suck on his tongue. Eagerly responding to my touch and kissing, tangling his tongue with mine.
I rush to face the door as I saw Hermione there, looking over and contemplating on the scene she just witnessed with curiosity and amusement. "Apparently, it's the kind of dining which, I should not be invited."
"W-what?" She asked in dazed.
I stared at the cup as I debated if I should take it or decline the offer more gently.
'So, I still do care...'
"I don't know," I answer with honesty. Ginny, even though she had shunned me, was still my girlfriend. "I still need to have a talk and a closure from Ginny. I can't just let her hanging there."
"What?" I asked bewildered at him.
' That incident in the ruins!' I thought with realization.
"Silly, Harry! No. You're alive.'
"Ginny, the question." I teased her.
"Ah...Well, they left me with no choice, so I run for it." Hermione blushed as she sheepishly twirls a bit of her hair.
Yes, guys.
"Oh! Are you near your inheritance age or It came early?" Malfoy simply asked after my revelation.
"He can't breathe if you suffocate him in your bosom, Mom." Fred teased as he too appears next to his brother.
"Are you not happy, Harry?" Hermione asked as she saw my expression.
I shook my head, not wanting to look so weak. "Please continue, Moine."
I couldn't answer Hermione's question. Panting hard, I steadied myself as I took a deep breath and waited to see if the drunken sensation would pass. Instead, the mere act of breathing in, cause me intense pain as I realize in grief that I carve for blood and flesh
I sighed. Typical Hermione…
I felt blazed with embarrassment and I silently was calling myself - Idiot - inside my head but soon as I saw Malfoy's face, all my flustering vanished. Draco Malfoy gave me a tiny smile at the corner of his lips then he quickly made a u-turn towards the dungeon, leaving as fast as he can.
Crouching down in all fours, as I position myself to attack. I let out a growl to intimidate my prey. Low and quiet but deadly. The echoes of hunger inside me, spread faster as I leaped over the human girl.
My black hair was messier than before, my face looks like lost its tan color instead replaced by a sick pale color tinged with green. And most of all, green eyes that were so tired and packed of eyebags.
'Live?' She asked. 'Can you hear your heartbeat? It's becoming weak. Your breath, can you feel yourself gasping? Are sure you're going to live, Harry - darling?'
I thought we will stay friends forever whatever may happen. RON!
"Wrong, Malfoy?" Michael glared at Malfoy as he tries to stand up but seems to be failing as he staggered a bit.
On the second day of Harry's seemingly coma state, I began to worry as there were no signs of him waking but Malfoy has a different option.
"I will try" Malfoy muttered.
I held him tightly, afraid that once I let him go, he’ll vanish before me. I loved him so much that it hurts whenever the thought of him dying passes my mind. I took a glimpse of him, he had that angelic face as ever, that at this moment possessed that stern but pained look.
Then, unexpectedly, a knock comes from the door, which eventually snapped me from my worrying. As the door opens, Malfoy steps in as he looks up to me.
Chapter 14: What Have I Become?
'Then accept me, Harry.' She said in her most seductive tone. Tempting me in giving in to her. 'If not, you're going to die. As every blood is dripping from your body and your insides spill out for the world to see.'
"Harry, Mate?" Ron said in a questioning tone. "Are you alright?"
Shutting my mouth closed, I continue to stare at them, trying to snap out from my dream. This is a dream, right? A weird dream, where Hermione and Draco are having friendly banter in front of me about my health. Maybe I should also check my mental health.
"What?!" Hermione snapped.
07.  The Living and the Dead
A booming bell echoed through the castle signaling the start of the classes, the three of us, went to our first class, which is Care of Magic Creature. We headed to Hagrid's small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden forest.
"Shall we go?" Draco said as he heads outside.
As I grew accustomed to the fleeting sensation of peace within me when the memories slowly immersed from my cerebrum - like an old telly flips its scene before me.
"What's the big idea of hitting people" I snapped at him. "That hurts."
“Give it to me.” He said as he took look at my face. Maybe, he saw the defeat on my expression as he whispered to me.
"So, what creature did you bring in Malfoy?" Ron snapped. "The Dragon! We all have seen it this morning when you were probably bragging it around."
"So, It was Today," Sirius said, calmly and with an apologetic look on his face.
"I know! But Harry is HARRY!" Hermione shouted more as she put more force but she was held by the twins as they also came running to restrain Hermione.
As soon I heard that it took all my attention and I began to listen to the discussion more intently. Ron and Hermione were also listening with more interest.
"You two! Stop teasing Harry. All you do the two of you are fool around." Mrs. Weasley gritted her teeth as she marched towards them. "If THE BOTH OF YOU put your time to study more than do those pranks and those... stuff then I would be happier."
"Your welcome, Harry." She said after a while.
"What's odd?" I asked. "My death?"
"Female demon?"
"So, what questions you might have for me, Granger?" He asked as he arranged himself then made a cue at Tiffany to get him some tea.
"You remember when the time we tried to rescue Sirius around when he went missing for three months and stumbled upon the runes in that...cave? Where I and Hermione got...?" I mumbled and stop as I didn't want to reminisce that particular scene again.
As I have cooled down from my rage, I let myself walk for a while as I return to the Burrow. I wanted time to think before I would make my decision. I going to find Sirius whether the Order would agree or not.
I hated that. When did I become a coward? Have I become a hindrance to them?
Bitterness came dwelling within my heart.
"Thank God!!! You're  awake, Harry." She cried out in my arms.
My whole body was shaking as my stomach felt empty when I just had eaten something so delicious. As I reach out, slowly I pulled the blood-soaked cloth as I saw what underneath it.
But instead, Hermione lowered her head, feeling sorry for him. Ron looked even ashamed and awkward. Neville, Seamus, and Dean took the moment to slide to the edge of the room and quiet down.
"I thought I stop caring, Hermione." I sobbed as I enclose my face with both my hands, unable to stop the painful assault of the unexpected emotions that just burst into my chest, like a shotgun - fast and deadly. "In all of those years, how can they leave me because of a single moment? Was our relationship was up to this point? Replaceable? Meant to be abandoned? Was our friendship has an expiration date to suddenly disappear just like that?"
The rain still poured as the carriage had arrived at the vicinity of Hogwarts castle. Leaning against the window, the castle had its windows lighted and shimmering - a welcoming sight. Our carriage slowed and halted before the great oak doors, which stood above the plight of stone steps. Its magnificent size and features that were oozing with mystery and magic always left me - wondering and smiling. Me, Ron, Hermione, and Luna quickly jumped from the carriage and run up the stairs, away from the rain and under the shade. Inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its grandiose marble staircase.
"Malfoy!" Ron grumbled, quietly. "Another one."
He leaned close to me as his face was an inch away from me. "Harry, If you don't like this, just push me away." He muttered as his lips descended on my own. Soft and sweet with a hint of mint to it, that was Draco's taste as he kissed me into total oblivion.
"Yeah," I replied then hesitantly, I walk towards my room. "Good night, Draco." As I turn to him, not wanting to actually leave him.
"Really, Weasley!" Michael snapped at him. "Your pretty good at playing suck up, Huh?! Sucking up to Potter even now. When you have already used your sister!"
"I guess I have start all over?" I asked them as I also took a serious stance and then leaned back on my seat, trying to relax as much as it simply allows.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yeah" I answered as the blush formed on my cheeks. "Sorry, I was into my thoughts"
But instead of bullying me as usual, Draco just stared at me, from my feet to my thighs then to my face, that had made me feel so squishy inside and I fidgeted from his leering.
"Why, Granger! Do you have to ask? That would be the ancient Dragons and the Great snakes." He guffawed mockingly.
Only Draco's few quiet hums were heard as he continuously squeezes my hand, in reassurance.
“Yes, Harry… Call me, Draco.” He said in a very savvy tone. “Of course, that is if you don’t like to?”
I froze upon hearing that name.
To all your questions regarding the time and actions of each character. I'll answer some of it:
Leaning against the door, with his blonde hair free-falling from his head, was the immaculate Draco Malfoy.
"Sorry! I was kind' an off, yesterday." I said sheepishly at her. "I was too relief to actually think about that stuff that I end up sleeping during our conversation."
I mined my head with anything, I could reply with. I was still in mid-daze as no thoughts came at me. Then in a panic, I found myself muttering: "Thanks."
Anger flooded me, charged towards her. My hands grabbed hard the edged of the sink, as the hands turn white from the force of my clutch. I feel sudden fierce hate towards her washing through me.
Out of nowhere, ropes encircle me, bounding me to the nearest tree, strong and tight. I snarl in frustration as I snap my jaws at the newcomer. Angry for hindering my mealtime.
"Harry" Hermione whispered.
The rain began to pour outside as the splattering sound was heard,  the raindrops falling on the glass window of their compartment as the train moved farther north. The sky was dark as the grey clouds covered the sun. The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and I, Ron, and Hermione bought some snacks.
From the previous chapter:
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and, revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
1. The time zone of this tale is between the end of the 3rd year and the starting of 4th year, obviously, the Triwizard Tournament didn't happen in this universe.
"Hmmph." He smirked evilly at us. "Being a Golden boy really has its benefits. When you need something you think that it will be granted immediately without giving any request first because you think you too important and eventually it will be granted anyway because it's your privilege. Really too arrogant, just like your father."
"Yeah..." I said, absent-mindedly as I followed him as he took his undetected wand and cast the levitation charm on Hermione and we took her to her bed. We took off her slippers and put her comforter on her but Hermione did not even wake up from all the movement. "She must have been too tired."
The station that she turns into was airing an old classic song, with its flute, piano, and drums - it was a lively one. Maybe because of the drastic situation that we are in, had made my brain gone hare-wire, I took Hermione's hand and pulled her in the middle of the tent.
Ron's face went to a great color of red as he went on and left. I shut my eyes. I felt the uneased feeling started to fade. I slowly got up to look at myself in the mirror.
I turn to the intruder.
"Yes, we do need to." Professor McGonagall pinched both of her lips intensely patient. Then she saw us in the corner of the room.
Michael's whole face turns red as he balled his fist, angered by my lack of attention. "Nightmares. I heard that you have been having them. I guess you're getting scared of our match next week. ha!?"
"Run." Draco hissed harshly, as he pulled Hermione spurring towards the direction of his tiny manor. I followed after as I jammed my feet from the ground to help me have a good kick start. Draco suddenly whips his wand with a spell, firring, "Bombarda." with such accuracy, killing off, one of the Hobgoblin and injuring another.
As we all have reached the Burrow, home of the Weasleys, after an exhausting day at Diagon Alley. Obviously, almost all of us were all unbelieving of what happens between the Malfoys and us.

"I do insist Harry, to be sure" She scowled intensely. "A checked up like Hermione had"
"Okay, please follow me." She said as she leads the way.
Anyone.
Ron returns the grin. It's really good to have my best friend by my side.
"We need to talk about those but first, we need to find a perfect spot to put the tent and set-up alarms, concealing charms and maybe - add a bit more of anti-detection charms." She breathed as she grew tired from the hike.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You say that the house-elves are mistreated unfairly." He spoke calmly.
I can go on and on if I really want to.
Headmaster then turned to Hermione and Ron. "When the two of you have found Harry did you notice anything?" He asked.
That I might lose everything that I cared for.'
"Molly" Mr. Weasley beckoned, breathlessly. "I have to go. They need me there. I have to stop him before he does something drastic from his anger."
"The reason for living and the source of their power." He said. "House-elves have been in slavery for too long, Granger. As you are trying to change the whole reason for their existence and the rules of their society. It is a vast and heavy blow in their history and the way of their living. What do you expect for them to do after attaining their freedom when they don't know where to go or what to do after being put out on the streets without any home, food, and, water? There are only a few who would hire a house-elf, Granger. Especially, in our today's and perspective view.  Luckily, Dobby was put in Hogwarts and that is only one, house-elf. What about the rest, Granger? Will you able to support them? Provide food, water, and shelter? Along with it, is their source power, which is very unknown by a lot. Especially those, who isn't a pureblood - that an ancestor house has a magic core which also provides power and vitality to the house-elves that serve the masters of the home. No home, no magic, and no power. So, basically, you are sending them to an early death, Granger."
Reaching out her hand to me. She called out. "Harry, it's me - Hermione!"
'The grim is here.'
‘God-damn it!’
It's kinda hard to visualize that once a good relationship could change drastically. Losing someone is cruel. All that sadness, guilt, bitterness, hatred, and pain.
“So, our agenda for this day are 2 main points. Firstly, we’re going to test your abilities.” Draco spoke as his eyes wander from the greenery of the lush forest to my very own emerald eyes, making me conscious as his silvery gaze stared at me with interest and intensity.
I straighten from my crouched and release Michael, who was beneath me. He had scratches from my nails but I was stopped by Hermione from doing more damage.
"Let me see." Professor Trelawney said she took the cup from Ron's hand. She turned the cup and push her slipping eyeglasses towards her eyes for better vision but as she moved the cup closer to her face, her eyes larger. It even doubles in size in appearance because of his magnified eyeglasses.
It took for a while for all of us - to realize that the Gulon already gave up chasing us. Sighing in relief, Ron weakly fall to his knees and Hermione slumped her bottom to the ground as she was trying to catch her breath but even with the Gulon gone, I couldn't help but feel intense fear. The Gulon didn't leave because it gave up chasing us but instead, it runs away from something else that was inside this part of the cave. Something so frightening that scare the shit out of that said monster. Meaning this something is far more dangerous than the Gulon itself. The hair on my whole body started to stand as I search for that creature with my weak eyes.
Then...
Hermione upon seeing our questioning faces sighed. "The two of you need to read more."
---------------------------------------------------------------
I held up my hands cause I didn't know where to put them in case, I might accidentally place them somewhere inappropriate.
Malfoy silently waited for me as Tiffany served him tea.
"Yeah, I'm fine now." I smiled at her, feeling bashful.
"Hey! That's unfair. I have lived most of my life in the muggle society and don't compare a genius to me." I said in defense. "No offense, Hermione but you are really a genius." I continued as I saw Hermione started to open her mouth to deny my statement.
"Ah, what?" Ron said as he eyed the statue with disgust. "Whatever it is, it does look a bit like Crookshanks."
"Harry." The blonde said in a gentle tone that took all my attention. "You don't have to suffer anymore. You can eat my flesh and drink my blood. Go on, eat."
'The boy who lived, Mr. Harry James Potter, son of the late Mr. James Potter and Mrs. Lily Evans-Potter might have a secret that finally been discovered when he accidentally transformed into a hideous dark creature triggered by his injured during the last Quidditch match of Gryffindors vs. Ravenclaw. Some say that Mr. Potter's true-form was the reason why he had defeated the Dark Lord as he was the next Dark Lord to rise!'
"Fred and George, huh..." I mumbled as I slowly give out a small smile.
"Mom, Its summer. Let them relax a little bit." Ginny came out as she walks to me. "Are alright now, Harry?"
Hermione froze as well. Her back was straight as a rod, her fists clench so tight that it turns her knuckles' white and her face promise a clear sign of pain for Corner.
'Yes, that's is correct.' She said sensually. 'Its good thing your too stubborn not to let others check you when you started having your nightmares and now I almost completely merge with you. Only what is left is half of your mind and the soul. Hehehehehehe...' She triumphs said with such vigor and happiness that made me hate her so much and at the same time made me feel terrified of what she said.
"Bloody hell! What just had happened?" Ron gasped out.
"Shut up," I grumbled at him without any bite on it. I was already embarrassed enough.
I felt my breath left me in a harsh gasp as I could feel his warmth, his skin touches mine.
-----------------------------------------------
"Then it is my responsibility to also explain to the Vanes. To let them understand the situation." Professor McGonagall spoke in a regal manner. "And Mr. Malfoy, please tell us first before doing any action so that there will be no trouble in your part. Some families and people do not understand the old ways now. Please be more understanding."
"I take it, with your purring over that bowl of soup, that you are enjoying my recipe," Draco uttered as he was observing my reaction. "I guess, our experiment is a success, Hermione."
Feeling hunger and relax, I looked down on the bowl of soup, that was in front of me. My soup, which was different from them, it was composed of chop up lean meat, reddish from being not cooked. As unappetizing as it must-have look, I know that this is now my diet and I must accept this.
"The result of our experiment meant you are most likely to hunt and eat beings that have high magical power, as the soup was from a horned rabbit, a magical creature of the east. That would also include us, wizards, and witches along with other magical creatures." Draco replied with seriousness in his voice. "With it, we also concluded what creature you might have become."
----------------------------------------
"Hide. Where d-do we...hi-hide?" I pant as I was still running beside her and Ron.
"Hmm...resting in one of the rooms." He answered slowly in a relaxing manner which helps me release the tension in my shoulders that I didn't know I had.
“Thank you, Tiffany.” He spoke with such gentleness. “Let’s eat.” Smiling at us as he led us and took out some plates while Hermione also arranges the utensils on the table. I went on by helping by setting the mugs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So, its a funny looking creature. Not a big deal." Ron snorted. "It is really sad to look so ugly."
"Really?" Draco said as his curiosity got him. "What could it be?"
"Draco!!!" Mr. Malfoy appalled by his son, interference. He reached out and grabbed Draco's shoulder turning him. "What are you doing?"
"Yes..." Hermione answered but came to a stop as soon as she saw my expression. "Is something wrong, Harry?"
As I stepped in I watched my shadow submerged with the surrounding darkness. Total darkness and the absence of light made me trip over the loose small stones that littered around the cave's floor. Hermione cast Lumos beside me with her wand then I and Ron followed her as she also cast the spell Lumos. As our light lighted the inside the cave with bright light, we noticed that at the wall was a statue made of the cave's wall - it was carved it a being that I couldn't recognize.
As I turn to her.  The one who has spoken wasn’t a child, not even a tiny bit. She was a teenager, maybe in her 17’s or 18’s. She had long midnight hair, pale skin like the snow that surrounds us. A petite body but hidden beneath her black satin dress- indicate more muscle than it might hint and eyes, that I could never look away from. Eyes with iris colored like the blood that covered me.
Startled by her call, I flinched but was able to control the shudder that threatens to surface from my body. Not wanting to offend her, I immediately sat up erect and squirmed on my seat as I felt the pressure from her stare and inhaled the strong smell of cooked meat that awhile ago had me hungry but is now making me feel nauseated.
——————————————————
With my enhanced vision, I saw him muttered a spell as a gush of wind slice the great moose's neck killing it instantly as it fell.
"Don't!" I screamed as I tried to scramble from my weak legs, standing in front of Harry trying to protect him then I took a run to grab onto Malfoy's arm. "Malfoy, what should I do? I have done all the things that the books had to describe, ones that I got from Hogwarts. Some of their suggestions have worked! But this...I just don't know what to do anymore! Please, Malfoy help us!"
I stood there, mesmerized and nervous as I clasped my hands together, staying like that for a while. Draco finally stirred from his seat.
"Then she is very dangerous, Malfoy." I said to him "Why do you keep her?"
'Do you like the improvement, Harry?' My demon uttered. She was back again.
"Sets of the solution? Does it had to do with the letter, you just receive?" Hermione asked.
Blushing, Hermione shakes her head. "I'm sorry, Headmaster. It was too dark so I wasn't able to see it clearly."
"My nightmares took a sudden turn these last few weeks. Recently, a demon had invaded my dreams." I whispered.
I saw Hermione lays awake as soon as I reach her, upon seeing me, she immediately put a finger on her lips - signaling me to be quiet. She began to slowly rose from her bed and took her beaded bag, her long coat and, her wand.
"What about them?" Sirius asked as he looks at me. I was quiet for a while as I gather my thoughts on how I could explain this to Sirius. My reasons are kinda off.
It's been more than a month ever since 'that incident' happen at Hogwarts, Hermione and I have been able to settle down here at Draco's tiny manor.  A lot has happened since then. Doing trial and error of what to expect from my change or speculating where did this curse come from for me to change but there's one thing for certain: it's high time now that Draco goes back to school.
"Okay!" I said as I followed her.
"I already voice out my opinion on this matter, Harry. When you disappeared from Hogwarts and I was left behind, I saw their reactions towards you and I was completely baffled on how they seem to treat and abandon you even of all those years being around you and being your friend." She was in a rage as she stomped her foot and clench her fist in anger. "Ginny and Ron were unbelievable! How can they do this to you?! It's a good thing the twins were on your side as they were the ones, who help me escape Hogwarts."
Draco was wearing a black satin bathrobe that seems cling to the shape of his body as the belt loosely tied around his waist making it possible of a gap between the robe, showing a  bit of his flushed white chest while he gently rubbed a white cotton towel over his hair which was still wet as I could see droplets of water on some the strands of his hair.
"But it's true. Very true" Sirius jolly blabbers. Mrs. Weasley's face was adorned by blush as she smiled brightly.
The great door opens as the first years entered followed by Professor McGonagall as she leads them in. They marched toward the front where a four-legged stool was placed and on it is an extremely, old battered hat. Everyone stared and waited for the hat to do its doing. The sorting hat began to sing a song. Its hoarse voice filled the whole hall, with its perfect pitch. And as it ended the Great hall was filled with applause.
For now, adios!
The owls encircle the tables searching for their owners or to the person they are to deliver. On the other side of the hall, there was fussing that was going about, instead of his usual eagle owl that had delivered the parcels and some sort of letter to Draco Malfoy. It was a small albino dragon sitting comfortably on his shoulder. Malfoy, unabashed by the commotion, he stoically started opening his letter and disposing some of his sweets to Crabbe and Goyle. The miniature dragon started to eat on his plate that he had abandoned.
"Brat," I whispered under my breath.
"Your welcome, Hermione." He spoke in an uncertain voice.
As soon I heard her voice, I turn to her. Staring at her pale face, as she forces a smile. I asked her. "Are you alright?"
