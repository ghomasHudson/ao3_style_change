“Wait, why can’t Harry stay with us?” His parents stilled. They avoided his eye contact and were breathing heavily. It took a while before they replied.
As he jumped into the logistics of the sport with James, Remus noticed Sirius gazing at him unflinchingly out of the corner of his eye.
A smiley face, a heart, a snowflake. He had to scare off a few fully fingered rats along the way until finally,
He was slowly getting more and more irritated. “But Draco and Harry could defeat him in two seconds, if they had the proper training!”
Draco huffed and shook his head ruefully. “If that man knows even the slightest thing about the Chamber of Secrets, I will shave my head.”
The rest of the day passed by at a dreadfully slow pace. He felt like he was walking through cement with every step he took, and it became increasingly difficult to hide the wince every time he trod on his bad leg. The second that dinner was over, Remus staggered as quickly and painlessly as he could to his dorm where he didn’t even bother putting on pyjamas before he collapsed onto his bed. Thankfully, none of his roommates decided to disturb him, not even Sirius, who gave him a detailed play-by-play of all of his antics religiously, every night before bed.
“Draco, Hermione doesn’t know there’s a troll!” Draco stopped in his tracks and seemed conflicted. But, after a moment's hesitation, nodded.
“I want to talk to you, Draco, because we haven’t really mentioned it since the beginning of term, about well… I think you know. I just want to make sure that you are okay.” Draco stilled slightly before his eyes softened.
He explained that the creature rattling the wardrobe was a Boggart, which made Draco feel a little queasy.
Harry nervously glanced at the pale faced boy in front of him. He was very pretty, he noted. Which was something he had never thought about another person before. His eyes were molten gray and his hair was white gold. When their eyes met, Harry felt his face heat up again. He shouldn’t have been staring.
“Oh, so this is about blood.” Harry had heard quite a bit of the blood status debate in his time at Hogwarts and it seemed a little ridiculous. He didn’t know much about magic, but he knew that his mother was a muggle born witch and that she was an incredible witch. He also knew Hermione, who was the smartest in their year, and she was a muggleborn!
“Anytime.” Ron was still giving him evils, but it was a process. Harry rushed up to him and gave him a tight, but short, hug and then released. “Harry, I think that was the least of what we’ll be facing tonight.” The other boy shook himself and put on what Draco now called his ‘Hero’ mask, the face he used to make everyone around him automatically feel safer. He felt that maybe they should unpack his need to calm people down and save the day at some point, but now was not that point. “Let’s go, shall we?”
When they finally landed, Harry dismounted and thanked the creature heartily, only now remembering its name to be Buckbeak.
“Oh, Harry, there you are.” she said, darting around her office. It had become routine for Harry to come and fetch her every morning for breakfast before he went down so he wouldn’t have to eat alone.
“We could use this map to look for Lucius.” was Harry’s final thought, just before sleep consumed him.
“What?” said Draco with an irritated expression. It irritated Harry sometimes that he didn’t know what he and Draco were. They had kissed before, rather, Draco had kissed him. But they never talked about it. He was perfectly happy with that at the time, but now he was filled with a strange possessiveness over the boy, as though he were his and his only. Still, he didn’t to tell Draco, out of fear that he wouldn’t feel the same.
“You’re dead, Harry Potter. Dead. Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you see what he’s doing, Potter? He’s crying.” Draco knew about Phoenixes from Moony, who kept up to date with most magical creatures. They also visited the Scamanders once, which was an eventful experience. But he was shocked, overall, that Tom Riddle, or Voldemort himself, didn’t know about the Phoenix Tears. Harry clearly didn’t either because he looked as though he was writing his will in his head. But Draco daren’t say anything now, for fear that Riddle would overhear. He was still rambling on about his defeat of the Boy Who Lived, when Draco noticed something by the Phoenix’s feet - the diary.
They should have Barbie movies on Netflix because I kid you not Barbie The Princess and The Pauper is one of my favourite movies ever and I'm sick of having to put in a DVD everytime I want to watch it.
“Come in!” The old wizard was sitting behind his desk with his regular black mask set in place, but the usual twinkle was dimmed. “Draco! Sit down, boy, while we wait for your fathers. Jelly Slug?” Draco watched as the gummy slugs writhed and wriggled over one another. He always thought that they never looked to appetizing, so he declined with as polite a smile as he could muster. Draco knew that the only way to get his answer was to ask Dumbledore now, he couldn’t trust that his dads wouldn’t try to sugar coat it.
“I’m so sorry, dad, the entrance was sealed off and we didn’t know what to do, I know it was unsafe I’m so, so sorry.” Draco rambled, now on the verge of sobbing. Remus looked like he wanted to reach out and give him a hug, but was restraining himself. Instead, he pried a paper out of Snape’s clenched fist and showed them the headline.
“Okay, open it!” Harry tore the paper off to reveal a dark, wooden box with Golden Snitches painted on the side. He traced the engravings reverently and opened it, marvelling at the decorated interior. “This is a secrecy box. You can put anything in it but to the rest of the world it will look empty.” Harry gasped.
Surprisingly, the Sytherins had taken very kindly to the events of the Quidditch match, and treated him not dissimilarly to how they would treat the Minister for Magic were he at the table, with awe and reverence. Draco immediately snapped at them to stop their ‘spineless ass-kissing’ and they had, but it was clear that they all thought Draco was an all powerful, dark warlock now, which angered Harry immensely.
“I feel like I have aged twenty years in the last two alone.” Sirius moaned as he collapsed into a chair hastily conjured by Dumbledore.
“Hi, Hagrid. We just wanted to ask you something?” Harry felt Draco’s eyes burning holes into the back of his skull. Hagrid gestured for him to continue. “You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger look like?”
“Okay, so you wanted her to get suspicious?” They were actually arguing, now, it was comical. Draco did have a terrible habit of getting too heated and talking back to his superiors, but as far as he was concerned, this was just a memory of some man who had done some horrible things. How dangerous could a memory be?
I NEED HELP! I want to put Pansmione in this but I really don't know, please tell me what ships you want to see in this, I want you guys to enjoy it! I can't decide, Luna and Ginny, Pansy and Ginny, Pansy and Luna, Pansy and Hermione, Blaise and Ron, maybe even Crabbe and Goyle, or I might just do Romione, maybe some hetero couples for a change lol
They spent the night pouring over the map. Draco was fascinated by it, especially because his fathers had had a hand in creating it.
“On the evening of the 31st October 1981, Harry Potter managed to survive the killing curse at the hands of Voldemort. On that night, he was also left orphaned, but still had two people of whom he could still call family, by law. One of them,” he said, with a pointed look at Sirius. “Was about to be put in Azkaban for a crime he did not commit. The other was his aunt, a Mrs Petunia Dursley.”
“The adventure ends here, boys! I shall take a bit of this skin up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her -”
Draco nodded and crouched down until he was sitting on the floor. He didn’t know quite how long he would have to wait for Wormtail, but if he was as hungry as Remus said he’d be, it likely wouldn’t be long.
Marcus Flint, the team captain, awarded him the position, and made Draco an alternate. All of a sudden, Harry felt the overwhelming guilt at what he had just done. He had beaten Draco, and was happy about it. He apologised to the other boy repeatedly, being only met with scoffs and lighthearted jokes, but Harry could see the flicker of resentment in those molten eyes that he loved so very much. Draco was talented, but nobody ever noticed because they were scared of him for some reason. They seemed either scared of him, or in awe of his prowess in school, he was the best in the class at Potions, and second best, only to Hermione, at everything else. And now he was second best at Quidditch too, something he genuinely loved.
“Harry, I think this is the worst idea you’ve ever had.” said Draco, as he nervously seated himself on the bike.
Okay so this chapter is MUCH shorter than the others so I might post the next one later today idk. Also, I've given Hogwarts an Easter holiday, I don't think they had that in the books but I wanted to give them one because Hogwarts Easter Egg Hunts would be EPIC.
Molly was lovely. She was a total mother hen and fussed around him in a way that made his heart long for his own mother, but he still welcomed it nonetheless, even though the rest of the Weasleys seemed to resent it.
“I don’t know. Rockstar, maybe?” That managed to get a low chuckle out of Remus. “Hey. We’ll figure it out. One step at a time, okay?”
When he reached it, he could barely catch enough light to see the map in front of his eyes, so he tentatively cast a
As Remus got to the altar, Minerva leaned forward and muttered “You take care of him now, Mr Lupin.”
Draco hurriedly flipped to page three to finish the article but, before he could, another owl landed in front of him, their family owl, Eddie. He held in his talon a rolled up piece of parchment. Draco untied it, almost ignoring Harry’s inquiries over his wellbeing. Unable to find words, he shoved the newspaper over to him, hoping he understood. The parchment, however, read;
“You two have displayed stupidity and foolishness, traits that may be celebrated in other houses,” He spat out the last two words with a pointed look at McGonagall, who looked rather put-out. “but are not celebrated in Slytherin. However, you have also shown incentive, which is admirable. For that, and sheer dumb luck, you will each be awarded 10 points. Now, get back to the dungeons, eat dinner and go straight to bed.” Harry and Draco were about to leave when Snape stopped them, for just a moment. “Draco, don’t think your parents won’t be notified.” Draco nodded, grabbed Harry’s hand and dragged him down the corridor until they were both playfully bumping into each other on their way down the stairs, exchanging sentiments of disbelief.
“Minerva,” her eyes, dark as Cho’s, twinkled when they fell upon the Headmistress of Hogwarts. “It’s been a while since I last saw you. The International Educators Conference…eight years ago, I believe? Before that nasty rumour of a monster petrifying students nearly closed your school down. I hope you’re well,” her smile looked more intimate than courteous. “Congratulations once again for your promotion.” Her English was slightly accented. The lack of sensation of magic told Harry no translation spell was being used.
“Oh, she’s killing it in Goryeo,” Zabini looked pleased as punch, “If you need any spices for your engagement party, we would be happy to supply you with high grade pepper! We’ll throw in chillies as well!”
“Our School has the space. The declining birth rate in Japan has lowered intake drastically, unfortunately.” The woman who must be the Headmistress of Mahoutokoro, despite how
“Oh?” He straightened up, putting a tiny bit more of distance away from Harry’s fiance. “Let’s have it, then,” he gestured.
300+ hits on chapter 3's release! Arigatou gozai masu! I'll be even happier if you can leave kudos and comments ^^
“I wonder if they use wands? Their branch of magic rely much more heavily on channeling the powers of familiars and spirits-”
Zabini snorted. “Your gifts were so cheap, though! Even the chilies can’t compare to my jade and Cor Lapis-”
Yet, since Lucius Malfoy fell from King Voldemort’s grace because of his defeat in a guerilla attack from the Order of the Phoenix, Harry began to see Draco Malfoy as just a scared boy, trapped in a war that he did not truly want to be a part of, same as Harry.
Harry opened the doors that would lead him to his guests nervously. He took a deep breath, and steeled his nerves.
Cantankerous Nott was still in house arrest. “... You mean his father?” Neville looked ill at ease. Like Theodore Nott, he only had one elderly living family left, that same elderly relative having raised him up from childhood. The idea of someone using his grandmother against him made him feel queasy.
The carriage jerked as the thestrals took off. Malfoy looked calm as he replied. “I thought friendship with Lord Zhongli is no skin off your back.”
Malfoy didn’t nod. He merely kept an eye on the redhead, who was prowling around the room like a big cat closing in on a prey.
Harry himself couldn’t help the bubble of joy that had formed in the pit of his stomach. He loved children dearly and he’d always wanted a big family. “...and I’m going to be a father,” the realisation stunned him. “Oh my God!”
Harry knew it; she was questioning why he didn’t come back earlier. Her approach had gotten softer, though. Less accusatory.
The knowledge spread through the entire Royal Castle within less than a day, and through the entire Kingdom the next day, after the news were covered in the Daily Prophet newspapers.
The rage was gone as soon as it came, suddenly replaced with melancholy. “If we have to wage another war… What did Dumbledore die for? What did Sirius, Remus and Tonks die for? What did Teddy lose his parents for!?” Harry choked, his chest heaving painfully as he sobbed. He couldn’t stop the tears from falling. “What did your brother die for!?”
“Your Majesty,” the King of Kasha’s smile looked strained. “Please forgive us… I’m afraid we have to decline your kind offer.” The middle-aged man leaned over to caress the choker on the blonde’s neck. “We are expecting.”
‘Eye-opening,’ if he were to be truly honest. Zhongli was a pleasant host and rubbing shoulders with him wasn’t such an unusual experience, but the ten minutes he’d spent with the Harbinger, without the amber-eyed man, ranked quite high in the list of things Harry didn’t want to experience again.
Slughorn shook his head. “House Bulstrode is one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but Miss Milicent is a half blood. So is Miss Tracey Davies.”
“We understand that Petra had gone through much turmoil in the past few decades, and indeed Kasha was eager to reinstate trade between the two Kingdoms…” The past tense made Harry wince inwardly.
Everyone heaved a sigh of relief inwardly when the redhead moved away to the windowsill. He stood there watching what Harry assumed to be Zhongli, outside in the garden. For once, his blue eyes did not look cold; it was as though the permafrost had thawed. The King stood to attention again when Tartaglia shifted his gaze to Hermione. “I accept your down payment, Lord Malfoy.”
“You’re too generous, Cousin-in-law.” Malfoy seemed happy that Zhongli was pleased with his gifts. Viscount Nott looked visibly relieved to be out of the woods. “Please, do stay over for lunch.”
Hermione grimaced as she made a suggestion. “Millicent Bulstrode.” She didn’t know many conservative purebloods their age.
Zabini sat back down and raised his wine glass in response, humming approvingly after he sipped his beverage. The kitchen’s budget had more than doubled since Harry let Malfoy manage it, but it seemed to be money well spent. The hall was almost always filled to the brim with aristocrats nowadays, a stark contrast from when half of the invitations Harry sent out were declined.
“Of course, my bo- Your Majesty,” Count Slughorn readily acceded to Harry’s request to ask him a few questions. The King was staying in the Estate of Count Nott’s neighbour while he was deciding on the elderly pureblood wizard’s fate. Cantankerus Nott was suspected of being Macnair’s accomplice instead of an unwilling victim.
Hermione blinked. “The same House Li that was the ruling family in the Tang dynasty almost a thousand years ago?”
“Jueyun chilli,” Zhongli muttered. Unlike with other gifts, he seemed as though grief had swallowed him. “Xiangling loved to cook with Jueyun chilli…” his gold eyes looked like they were heartbroken.
Malfoy twitched infinitesimally, but he remained silent. “Prophecy?” It was Harry who voiced the question. He was really not fond of prophecies that turned people’s lives upside down.
“Time flew by so fast,” Zhongli said sincerely as he was sending his guests off at the entrance hall. It was unbelievable how well Tartaglia behaved when he was with the amber-eyed man; like he was a harmless kitten, instead of the tiger he was.
Nobody said anything when the King didn’t get off as they passed by Count Moody’s home, and accompanied his fiance all the way till they reached Petra’s Royal Castle.
Meanwhile, Zhongli was staring at Malfoy in surprise, as though he wasn’t expecting to see such a familiar face. “You are.. Yelan’s son’s fiance. Or… former fiance, rather.” Those amber eyes zeroed in on the prominently displayed peridot choker, and then dropped to Malfoy’s protruding belly. “The child you’re carrying… is still of Li blood.”
Hermione, as usual, was the first to offer her thoughts. “I won’t deny that the skirmishes at the border regions are a concern… but the proposal is rather drastic. There are plenty of purebloods in the court,” she gestured at Neville and Luna. “Both of you are from pureblood Houses. The Sacred Twenty-Eight are represented as well… Other than Houses Weasley and Longbottom, we have Abbot, Shacklebolt, Prewett…”
It seemed fishy, but Hermione was excited, nevertheless. “Thank you, Lord Malfoy. I’ll be sure to join.”
“Greetings, Your Majesty and Lord Malfoy,” Viscount Theodore Nott spoke respectfully from his knees, the familiar features of ash blonde hair and dark blue eyes barely registering into Harry’s mind.
A part of Harry felt pleased that Malfoy finally learned his place and lost his arrogance, but at the same time, Harry just felt tired. They were all just boys, caught in the adults’ war. Malfoy seemed to have suffered enough, detained in Azkaban throughout summer before his trials were finalised. Many might have resented that the Malfoys escaped sentences in Azkaban, and Lucius was cowardly for trading his freedom with that of his former comrades, but by doing so the man had made enough enemies to watch his back his entire life. It was a punishment in itself.
Hermione looked pensive. The carriage was silent for a while before she nodded to herself. “I see… not a bad trade. I forgive you.”
Malfoy declined the offer with a shake of his head, his loose hair hanging limply around him. “Thanks, Blaise. But I have no appetite.”
“I’m sorry,” the King didn’t know what else to say. “Malfoy didn’t look well.” It wasn’t technically a lie.
Harry’s first knee-jerk reaction was, ‘No!’ He took a deep breath to calm himself. If he didn’t allow for it, Malfoy might eventually think of murdering Harry just to leave him. The current Malfoy may be incapable of murder, but people change. Harry did. “Yes,” he answered after a moment, “but it will be unilateral. You will have to convince me.” Harry raised his hand to stop the arguments forming in the blonde’s mouth. “I hope you are aware that the job of the Second Consort I am legalised to marry is to represent the interests of the conservative pureblood faction. The long-term goal is to remove the divide between Petra’s citizens, so that we can all live harmoniously without breaking into another civil war. Only after this duty is reasonably fulfilled, can the Second Consort divorce the King.”
Harry turned to his right, where the brunette was still excitedly babbling to an obliging Neville all she’d managed to cram into her brains on the Japanese wizarding community (except the Toyohashi Tengu, the only thing Harry knew about Japan).
The blonde only bowed with his head. “I will discuss the draft contract with my parents, Your Majesty. I’m sure you need to go through it with your subjects as well.”
When the blonde looked up again, his gaze was firmer. “I request for one of my children to be appointed to be the heir of House Malfoy.”
The rest of the room turned their gazes to the man sitting next to the fuming pair of mother and daughter, the man who had a circlet of rubies and gold resting on his messy black hair. His green eyes were dull and unfocused.
Harry and Malfoy stared at each other fixedly, neither side budging, before Harry decided to be the one taking a step back. There was still a few weeks’ margin to Ginny’s due date. “I’ll trust you this time, Draco.”
Cold sweat began to drip from Slughorn’s temple. “Yes, he is! Quentin has a sweetheart there; he’s been writing so much about her in his owls to me…”
The beautiful man turned to his companion. “What does it say?” His voice was deep and slightly husky, as wise and timeless as his gaze. He trusted the redhead enough to let him open his letters.
“She is…from a conservative pureblood family, I think.” Slughorn rubbed his chin. “But her family isn’t… exactly influential.”
Theodore Nott remained on his knees. “Your Majesty, I am aware that my reply was far too late and I have slighted your goodwill. I come to you to remedy my mistakes,” when he finally raised his head, he sent his imploring gaze straight at Malfoy. “Lord Malfoy, you do not have an aide yet, do you? I offer everything, absolutely everything at my disposal to be of service to you.”
His reply to Harry’s letter had come months too late, requesting for a meeting with Harry and Malfoy. The King thought unkindly that Theodore only made a move because he had to; it had just been decided that Count Cantankerus Nott would be administered a dose of veritaserum for his case to move along. It was still a highly unpopular decision and Malfoy had received some of the dirtiest looks he’d ever received from the pureblood faction.
After the sheer loss of lives in the war, babies were good news. For a moment, everyone just seemed purely happy.
“Gin!” Harry quickly shot a spell to slow down her descent and cushion her fall. The Queen had fainted.
“Your Majesty, please,” Malfoy’s voice trembled. Harry was shocked by his pleading gaze. In the months they worked together in governing Petra, Malfoy had never begged Harry for anything, not even for allowing Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy to return. “With portkeys, it’ll only be a day-trip at most…”
Hermione didn’t let herself be deflected. “It’s true, but that’s not my point,” the witch was a capable negotiator, always determined and logical in her persuasions.
Arthur Weasley was an impoverished lord whose ancestors had lost their county lands. House Weasley lived in the neighbourhood. One day, Arthur had met Harry in a terrible storm when the boy was out on an errand. The kind redhead had sheltered Harry in his cramped, badly-in-need-of-renovation, warm home. That was how Harry’s friendship with Arthur’s youngest son Ron began.
The King succumbed to his bad habit of running his hand through his hair when he was stressing over something, messing the bird nest even further. “Aren’t there other people? Zabini or Nott?”
“About Lord Zhongli,” the King quickly interrupted before his friend blathered on and on. When Hermione got into this mode, he could give her a 3-hour guest lecturer slot at Hogwarts and she would still have things to say by the end of it.
Theodore’s dark blue eyes looked feverish even as he reported with fake calmness, “Lord Malfoy, your former great-uncle-in-law to be… Zhongli and his lover… They are in Petra! [2]”
Tartaglia walked to the chest of gifts and picked up the Noctilucous jade with disinterest on his face. He’d abandoned all notions of pretense. “Such a fine gem must be expensive, huh?” the redhead sneered. “Zhongli xian sheng has an eye for quality but he does not know the value of money. He’s never had to use money; he’s lived his life exchanging favours with the powerful and the rich, who take care of all his expenses for him. You know that, don’t you, Draco Malfoy?”
The second wave of a long-drawn war Harry had feared didn’t come to fruition; Walden Macnair’s army was quickly subjugated.
Harry was paranoid that there were other fanatic, smarter former Death Eaters who infiltrated Durmstrang’s court or even allied with some of the ‘neutral bystanders’ pureblood families who did not flee to other Kingdoms, and were simply biding their time, plotting their revenge like the Order of the Phoenix did.
It didn’t take too long for someone to notice that Harry was almost a carbon copy of the late James Potter, the last heir of the duchy of Gryffindor, who had famously eloped with Librarian muggle-born Lily Evans. James’ and Lily’s lives had perished in the hands of the reigning terror of a dictator, the last heir of the duchy of Slytherin, King Tom “Voldemort” Riddle.
Hermione blinked profusely when Harry showed her the letter. She gaped, her mouth opening and closing like a goldfish. “Wha- H-how dare she-!”
Ginny smiled wanly, before she crossed her arms and huffed. “That’s what you get for travelling in a carriage for one whole day!” She stuck her tongue out to let him know she was joking. “Let’s sleep, then!” She lifted the blanket and patted the mattress.
“Cor Lapis is itself hard to gather… It must have taken true skill indeed to unearth two pieces so alike…” [1]
Before the mood turned strange, Harry blurted. “Was it true that Wormtail lost an arm during Voldemort’s meeting with Zhongli and Tartaglia?”
“Your Majesty, stop,” Malfoy’s voice was shaky, and his face was pale, but he never averted his eyes from the red-haired monster in front of him. “You’re right, Lord Tartaglia. There is something we would like to ask of you.”
“Snezhnaya collapsed over a decade ago right?” Harry didn’t understand. “If Snezhnaya had such powerful protectors, just how did it collapse?”
Malfoy looked composed in his exquisitely-made garnet-coloured robes, the large sleeves draped over his lap, his fine shoulder-length hair braided in silver beads decorated with rubies. With a start, Harry realised it had been a while since he had looked at the blonde closely. Malfoy was finally visibly pregnant, his lower stomach protruding in an unmistakable way. The distasteful peridot choker remained an eyesore, but that did not detract from how much Malfoy looked like an Ice Queen.
As Harry and everyone else in the hall frowned in confusion, all traces of anger and resentment left Malfoy’s face.
“Congratulations, Your Majesty,” his paranoia was interrupted by a beaming felicitation from the Healer. “Her Majesty is pregnant!”
“That’s after curfew,” Hermione frowned as the Headmistress stepped down from the podium. Her face changed soon after, though. “Must be because of the time difference.”
“Cousin-in-law has brought such marvellous gifts,” the amber-eyed man showed them off one by one. “Isn’t he just so thoughtful?”
Ginny’s face had lighted up when she laid her eyes on the trolley. “Breakfast in bed? Wow, Harry, you’re so nice…” she was warm as she wrapped her arms around him and gave him a smooch on the cheek.
Harry thought that Hermione would use the portkey back home like Zabini, Nott and Luna, but he didn’t mind riding in the same carriage as her, too.
Harry gave Hermione, who was all packed and ready to go, a grateful smile. “How do I live without you, Hermione?”
Draco Malfoy. The mere mention of the name used to be able to make him angry, even before Harry hit puberty and went through a phase where everything incensed him. The snobbish blonde boy had been a thorn in Harry’s side after the green-eyed boy was made Seeker in his first year in Hogwarts. The rivalry only intensified after the former Marquess Lucius Malfoy secured his only son and heir the Seeker position of Draco’s House through bribing the Quidditch team with luxury brooms.
Hermione merely studied him with her penetrating gaze, as always, before speaking, in a small voice, after they were safely
Harry blinked. This was the first time he’d heard this. “...I see.” In any case, stipulating the minimum number of heirs for the respective Houses in the contract was enough. If Malfoy wanted to bear Harry more children, Harry would not complain.
Only after the entire Weasley clan departed from the meeting room and the 4 of them remained, Harry slumped into the chair at the head of the table. He casually gestured at his friends to take a seat. “What do you think of the proposal?”
“I know you don’t need me to spell it out loud, Lady Granger,” Malfoy carded his fingers through his hair, bringing the pale locks away from his face. The skin around his eyes were starting to turn puffy.
Harry was unable to tell whether this error was deliberate or not. The elderly wizard appeared really shaken. “I still want to know
“Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness… No, I’m sorry. Greetings, Lord Malfoy,” Blaise Zabini gave a short bow, his voice cokesure, Cupid bow’s lips curled in a confident smirk.
Viscount Nott’s voice was calm, but the undercurrent was filled with annoyance. “Thankfully he was pleased with the vase and the perfume.”
Harry blinked again. “I don’t know, Hermione,” he stared at his hands unseeingly. “I kinda want to spend one last year in Hogwarts. Ride on Hogwarts Express one final time, lounge around the Great Lake and catch a glimpse of a tentacle of the Giant Squid, feast in the Great Hall…. Going to this…this Maha-
“Welcome, Your Majesty,” a gravelly deep voice spoke, and Malfoy dropped into a curtsy straight away, followed by the other two purebloods.
Zhongli tilted his head too, causing the tassel earring on his left ear to brush his cheek. “Childe?”
, who else are you sending it to?” Irritation filled her voice. Despite that, she began to paw at the tunic he wore to sleep.
“Yes way, look.” He pointed at the letter which clearly stated that Harry had said something to snake and that it had understood. That it had sounded like hissing.
Once they had allowed him to sidestep his way from the closet, Harry immediately ran through the castle in search of Draco, and was about halfway to the Great Hall, when he remembered how much easier this job would be now. Harry ducked into an empty classroom and muttered under his breath, “
“What’s that supposed to mean?” the other boy demanded, and started puffing out his chest in an intimidating motion.
“I’m sure he’d like to go too. I know Madame Maxine is an oddball, but she’s less of an oddball that Dumby. And I don’t think she’s a dangerous one.”
“Ron’s just being dramatic.” Draco said to Harry after finding out about the incident. “He never really liked Scabbers anyway, and I reckon it’s a good thing anyway. Pads said we should be wary of it, for all we know it’s a mass murderer animagus hiding under the disguise of a family rat.” He said this with a wry smile. “At least it’s dead now. We don’t have to hear from it again.”
“Dumbledore! Minnie! What a surprise, come in, come in!” Sirius ushered the pair inside and led them to the kitchen where Remus offered them tea and took the baby off of Dumbledore’s hands.
“My dads said that Dumbledore wouldn’t tell anyone where you were. Apparently it was some big secret. They won’t tell me anything. All I know about you was that you survived the killing curse when you were a baby, but that’s just common knowledge around here.” Harry squirmed at the onslaught of knowledge and didn’t quite know how to reply. His time at the Dursley's was awful and he honestly wasn’t excited to meet this ‘Dumbledore’ that everyone kept mentioning. Even if Hagrid had worshipped him, he can’t be that wonderful if he kept him from his godfather and the life they had. Harry couldn’t quite stop himself from being jealous of Draco. He seemed to have lived the ideal life up until this point. Thankfully, he didn’t have to reply because an elderly woman stopped by their compartment with a trolley, loaded with colourful sweets. “Ooh! Pads gave me money for this! Would you like anything?”
The next morning, while sitting in the Great Hall, thousands of owls swooped down from the ceiling, among them Draco’s own owl, the black-feathered Perseus, carrying his subscription from the Daily Prophet. As he landed, he managed just to avoid knocking over any glasses, but landed his foot in the strawberry jam. Harry giggled.
“But then I explained to Sirius that Dumbledore would be doing something about it, if that were the case.” Remus exhaled, but seized up again when he realised that they were still building up to something.
“Sorry, Draco. I’ll try to be less stupid.” He couldn’t keep the hint of sarcasm out of his voice, but turned back to the fire, ending the conversation, anyway.
When they were finally in their headmaster’s office, both of them rushed forward to be embraced by Moony and Pads, who were already in there, waiting for them. Draco couldn’t stop himself from crying in relief, he didn’t think he would ever see his dads again.
“... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right on top of my head.” She gestured to a small, leather diary on the floor, drenched in toilet water. Harry moved to pick it up but Draco stopped him.
“What was your long-term plan with the stone? You couldn’t keep it in Gringotts, clearly, but you clearly couldn’t keep it here forever. What were you going to do?” Dumbledore paused and stroked his chin.
As he walked down the aisle, Sirius couldn’t see what he was so worried about in the first place. While Moony hadn’t arrived yet, there were other things in the room he could use as anchors. McGonagall’s stead weight on the crook of his elbow, guiding him down the path, the two empty seats on his side of the room in the front row, reserved for Euphemia and Fleamont Potter, who he missed sorely, and James grinning at him like a loon and bouncing on the balls of his feet.
The three wizards sat in contemplative silence. The magnitude of what they had been running from for years was finally catching up with them, and the Wizarding World was once again in danger, even though most of them were blissfully unaware of it.
“No. That wrinkled grape must be lying to you. There is no way.” Harry was baffled, perhaps Draco wasn’t honest about what he had seen either.
“How- how…” He coughed and tried again, paying no heed to the hot tears spilling from his eyes. “How did you know?”
“Back in Binn’s class - saw you were sleeping, Rem, don’t blame you. That was definitely one of his more boring classes.” Sirius panted, grinning like a loon.
“Over the next few days you may start to feel fuzzy in your head but that’s just the Nargles leaving.”
Harry passed him a gift box tied with a green, Slytherin ribbon. “If you don’t like it, you can return it. I only got it a few days ago because I didn’t know what to get you but then I had an idea but I can give it back if you don’t like it…” He carried on rambling but Draco wasn’t listening, instead focusing on the shiny, fiddly contraption in his hands.
Ron was just as he remembered him, after he apologised for making such a snap judgement about him, they ended up becoming really close, closer than they were before, even.
Harry all at once remembered what he saw and sat up straight in his chair. “No! I saw Pettigrew on the map! And when I got to the hallway he was in, I saw Scabbers!”
“Stop punishing yourself.” said Pads. “Can you tell us any more than what you have told us?” Dobby shook his head, beyond words. “Go home, then, and
Draco slapped Ron as he snorted and shook his head fervently. “Not at all. I’m genuinely grateful that you’re so kind to me about all of this. I know it looks really bad.”
“Somewhere there.” she pointed vaguely towards one of the sinks and both of the boys rushed over it and scanned it for anything unusual. At last, Harry saw it: a tiny snake engraved on the side of one of the copper taps.
“So, wait, that Colin kid’s been Petrified?” Draco was sat attentively listening to Harry recounting his eventful night.
“Yeah, just like Mrs Norris!” Harry whisper-shouted. “It’s scary, isn’t it? Something is going on, Draco!”
I may need to start uploading a little less regularly, I don't know, it depends on the next few weeks really.
“I’m really happy, Draco. Thank you for inviting me here.” Draco could sense that there was more weight in that sentence that he let on, but could also tell that Harry wanted to change the conversation.
Quidditch tryouts were approaching and Draco seemed to be very excited. As did Harry, who knew how talented Draco was at flying and wanted him to be on the team. So he practised with him whenever they could, which wasn’t often, but he didn’t really need much training. When the actual day came around, it was clear that Draco would be the best Slytherin had to offer.
Because of both of their Firebolts, Draco and Harry weren’t allowed to be on the same team, people said it was too much of an advantage. The game was intense and exciting. Draco seemed very happy to be utilising his Chaser skills, and Charlie was a very worthy opponent as Seeker. Ron seemed to be decent enough at keeping, and Sirius seemed to be in his element, slamming bludgers back and forth with the Weasley twins, which wasn’t even the aim of the game. Harry had never seen him happier, as though he were twenty years younger. Remus took over commentating duties and Harry was shocked by how hilarious the man was. He almost fell off his broom at one point after a particularly funny comment about McGonagall and Sirius, when they were locked in a high speed chase. He had said something about how tiresome cats and dogs could be, which was only understood by those who knew about Sirius’s animagus form, which made it all the more hilarious.
“We should meet up next Hogsmeade weekend!” he suggested. “We didn’t get to really enjoy it last time.”
“Look! Draco! Stockings! And there’s one with my name on it!” Leaping off from the bed where he was ruthlessly attacking Remus and Sirius with pillows, Draco squealed. He always became a child again when Christmas came. The two boys settled themselves in front of the tree with a stocking each on their lap, and the two men wandered in, eyes puffy with sleep.
Draco felt numb. Lycanthrope? What did that even mean? He continued reading the article, urgent for some explanation.
Nobody said anything for what seemed like a really long time, but was probably only a few seconds, before the ball rang and Remus dismissed everyone, including Harry, but keeping Draco behind and taking him to his office, where he fed him chocolate and biscuits until he felt better. Draco didn’t say anything, because there was no need to. There was nothing he could say that would make it any better for him, or make the worrying crease between Remus’s eyebrows smooth out. Whatever the hell that was, it probably wasn’t a fantasy. A fantasy is never that vivid.
Draco shook his head ruefully. “I’m scared.” His voice was weak, wavering and trembling tearfully. Harry engulfed him in a hug and allowed him to bury his head in his chest, listening to his heartbeat. He probably could have cried, but he’d done enough of that and it made him feel like he was on display. Instead, he just told Harry what he was scared to tell his dads. “I’m scared because I look just like him. I’m scared because I think he’s going to come after me. I’m scared because I think I let him out. I’m scared because the dream felt so real.”
“I love it. I love it so much, thank you.” It was the most incredible gift he had ever received. “Let’s take a photo right now.” He started inspecting the buttons and switches, utterly baffled. “How does it work?”
“I don’t feel anything.” Draco shot him a look of disbelief before continuing with his spellwork. Harry, however, was still confused. He was cold, very cold. So cold that he felt it to his bones. He reached out for Draco’s knitted blanket and wrapped it around himself like a cocoon. He felt minutely better, if only for the smell of Draco that now surrounded him. Harry rubbed his hands together and held them closer to the fire, still no difference.
“If you don’t like it we can return it, Harry.” Remus assured him. “You are under no obligation to keep it!”
“Yes, but I’m not angry about it. I just had to pay a fine for keeping it a secret.” Draco nodded, and then opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted by a soft knock came from the door. “Come in!”
I might not post another chapter until after Christmas so Merry Christmas to those that celebrate it! To everyone else, Happy Holidays! I hope everyone is making the most of it in these trying times ❤️❄️🎁
“Nonsense, nonsense. I will have this done in one moment.” The stupid man seemed adamant. “Hold still, Harry.”
“I don’t have an answer. But I think that, right now, we need to owl Draco and tell him not to sneak out again. You forget that the poor boy is only eleven, we have time.” Padfoot seemed resigned, his anger now dissipated. He dragged his feet into the study and found himself a quill and some parchment, started writing a response, and then tied it to the leg of Draco’s bird. Once it took off, Sirius meandered his way over to Remus and buried his face in his neck. “Everything will be alright, Pads. I promise. One step at a time?”
He turned and watched his friend wade through the sea of children before coming up onto the platform. His face was a fiery as before, if not more so. Harry was unnerved.
Draco didn’t know what to say. For the first time in his life, he was truly paralysed with fear. But Harry spoke up for him.
“So should I get a constellation tattoo? If we’re all getting one?” asked Draco, smiling contentedly.
Harry hesitated before he answered, knowing that his suggestion was a crazy one. “Do you know how to ride your dad’s motorbike?”
“He’s currently experiencing massive outbursts of anger, Professor. We’ve been observing his behaviour over the past few weeks and it seems that he just needs release every now and then.”
The boggart transformed into a similar image of Sirius, Draco and Harry dead instead and shouted, “Riddikulus.” The bodies were now asleep and had mustaches and monocles drawn on their faces.
“‘Course, Harry. Just watch carefully!” With that, he raced at the wall with his luggage as Harry glared in wonder.
“What are you doing? Get - off - me!” Harry struggled out between breaths, kicking his legs frantically and trying to pull himself from the twins grip. They didn’t reply, and before Harry knew it, the solid oak door to a broom cupboard was flung open, and he was being tossed inside. He put his hands out to stop his fall, and scrambled to his feet frantically, looking at the twins with a mix of anger and curiosity. Fred pulled the door shut, and turned to Harry, beaming.
Harry quickly sealed the map with a few whispered words and turned to face Snape. “Professor.” he greeted.
“I dragged you into this, I’ll go on.” Draco didn’t like that idea. Not one bit. But Harry needed to do this, he’d been on about it all year. Maybe this had a lot more baggage than he was letting on, maybe it didn’t. All Draco knew was that Harry was strong enough to withstand anything.
Once they made it to the Professor’s office, they were both panting, but Harry summed up the energy to pound on his door. They could hear banging and crashing but eventually it opened up to show a sliver of the man’s face.
“Here comes the tricky part, due to-” he coughed. “circumstances, you cannot stay with us on every holiday-” Sirius interrupted.
“Are you okay, Harry?” Draco whispered, even though he knew that the figure could hear them. At Harry’s name, the shadow-man stood up and loomed towards them. Draco shrieked and ran, sensing that the best thing he could do was find Hagrid to tell him what was happening. When he found him, the man looked more scared of him than of the story of the mysterious figure, but followed him nonetheless. They didn’t need to go far, though, because Harry was delivered to them on the back of a man with a horse’s body. “Harry!” Draco rushed forward and embraced him as he dismounted the centaur. “Are you okay?”
“I’m okay, dad. I don’t see you any differently, if that’s what you’re worried about. And I understand why you didn’t tell me. I just want you to know that I love you, no matter what.” Remus’s eyes were prickling. Truly, he was worried about Draco seeing him differently. But, the person he saw before him was not a boy anymore, he was growing into a man. Remus was proud that he and Sirius had managed to raise him to be good.
When Draco was sorted, there wasn’t silence, but their faces screamed expectancy, that they knew it was coming. He didn’t completely understand why but chalked it down to the fact that he just looked the part. With Harry, however, you could hear a pin drop. Draco was reluctant to even start clapping since it seemed like no one else was doing it but, catching sight of Harry’s face made him sure that he should support him, so he did, but nobody joined in. Dumbledore’s usually blank mask had fallen into one of polite confusion and worry, and the expression of everyone else varied from outraged to downright bewildered.
“Dunno. He wouldn’ take his cloak off.” Harry inwardly groaned, that’s what he was afraid of. “It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s head - that’s one of the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mighn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”
So, upon finding himself unable to sleep for the hundredth time in a row, Draco welcomed it, and began his silky tresses of the air, manipulating it into a cold breeze, and a light sprinkling of snow.
Draco was stunned. He locked eyes with Harry, who looked like the culmination of all of his hopes and dreams had manifested in a moment, and smiled.
“Very good. Emotional significance, genuine emotion…” He carried on his head bobbing as his eyebrows furrowed. “I wonder why it isn’t working, have you tried other memories?”
- Thirdly, hears to the end of lockdown! I see it on the horizon I think. I'm going back to real school tomorrow, I've been in online school since the christmas holidays. I think it's gonna be good, seeing real people again. It's been so long.
The article itself just said that he disappeared early in the morning under mysterious circumstances.
“Look, I’m sorry.” Harry piped up. “It was my fault, I persuaded Draco to do it, I should have been more responsible.” Draco whipped his head around to Harry’s and stared at him in bewilderment. Why was he putting himself on the line? Maybe he thinks that he’s got some kind of pass because he saved the school for Voldemort last year?
“We don’t quite know yet.” Moony’s features were drawn and distant, something he did when he was trying not to worry people with his emotions. He started listing families who may take Harry in but Draco was still focused on the word ‘circumstances’. He interrupted his father, something he never did, distressed.
.” Snape brandished the map, which only looked like a scrap of old parchment with some names written across the top. Harry watched on as the dawning of understanding crested on Remus’s face. “Do you know anything about it?”
Draco seemed to grit his teeth. “An animagus can transform on command. A werewolf cannot.” It was the most succinct answer he could give. The class held their breath as they wondered how their teacher would twist his words.
His train of thought was shattered by an ear-splitting cry coming from the Basilisk. Draco looked closer, both of the terrifying amber eyes had been punctured by what was apparently the Phoenix. He grinned and ran over to where Harry was standing, which was in one of the corners, ducked out of the way. Riddle seemed to be yelling at the beast in its native tongue, all to little avail.
“Professor Dumbledore would like to see you in his office.” he snapped. “Be quick.” With that, he exited in a flurry of black robes.
Sirius grinned in that mischievous way he often did when he was trying to persuade someone to do something. “Of course you can, Harry. You’re family.” That was enough to make the tears fall in buckets. He accepted the big group hug when it was offered and nuzzled his face into Remus’s jumper, and then Draco’s hair.
At first, all it seemed to be was an image of him, Harry, Sirius and Remus, all older, smiling and laughing good contentedly, exactly as he’d seen in the Mirror all those years ago, but he knew what came next. Dread burning a hole in the pit of his stomach, Draco couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, neither could anyone else it seemed, they all just watched as boggart-Draco’s happy grin morphed into a sickly grimace, and it’s right hand raised slightly. Draco could just see the small flurry of something white that circled the boggart’s hand before it sent shards of a glass-like substance, that looked strangely like ice, into the hearts, eyes, skin of his family. Around boggart-Draco, there now lay three bodies, choking on their own blood, convulsing grossly. This was where Remus stepped in.
Dumbledore summoned a glowing, misty orb and let it hover just in front of Draco and Harry’s illuminated faces. They were in awe. They could not look away and were unable to speak.
“Yeah. I know.” They spent the rest of the morning in a comfortable silence, only breaking it for brief moments to ask the other to pass something, or to suggest telling Dumbledore. They did, around the middle of the afternoon. Not that it made any difference. There was nothing that any of them could do. Just wait for the storm to arrive.
“That’s right, Gilderoy.” said Sprout. “Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?”
“Interesting. I wonder what this Mirror does?” Their conversation was interrupted by a sudden shuffle of footsteps outside the room.
“I think Draco needs a place to practise his powers, and Harry too for that matter. We can’t have them holed up in the castle day-in, day-out, they’ll end up hurting someone.”
“Yes, I could’ve, Draco. But my object isn’t to kill muggleborns anymore, it’s to kill you two. And, just my luck, you’ve wandered into my web.” He held up his hands triumphantly as if to show off the room, it was sick. “You see, Ginny saw her ickle crush, Harry, with her diary! Her fascination with you, Harry, was interesting, actually. Hogwarts resident good boy turned bad, the saviour they all thought they had, best friends with Death Eater spawn? Her family were cautious before, but then, as I learned when she got the book back, the object of her affections was a Parseltongue! Possibly the Heir of Slytherin! How interesting! And from what I knew about you already, I realised that you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery, and that you would bring your boyfriend with you.”
“Thanks, son. I’ll get on with explaining shall I?” Draco nodded and Moony steeled himself before forging on. “There has been a lot of rumour and speculation surrounding your adoption into our family, especially seeing as your father and I don’t seem like respectable candidates. I am sure you saw in the article that I am referred to as a ‘Werewolf’?” Draco nodded again, listening raptly. “Well, I wanted to tell you this when you were a little older but, I suppose now is as good a time as any, that is true.” The young boy gasped. A werewolf? But weren’t they meant to be savages? They killed people. Draco knew, he had read it once in an article. But then something clicked - Moony always went away for the weekend, once a month. Pads had always told Draco that it was for work, but maybe that wasn’t it? “Now, I am sure, like the smart kid you are, you’re putting two and two together. I’ll tell you everything. Today. Seeing as you are excused from lessons.”
“Someone’s messed with this bludger!” grunted Bole. One of the Weasley twins had come over now and tried to tackle the ball. Marcus called for a time out and everyone came down to the ground.
- Fourthly, I just want to apologise to anybody who is waiting for a sex scene in a later instalment (like in the fifth or sixth book) I just... I don't think I can do it. I tried but it was really difficult and it didn't sound right. If anyone is good at writing sex scenes, I issue an open invitation to try because I seriously don't know how people do it.
Draco couldn’t help it when a laugh escaped his lips at the incredulity of his situation. “Yeah, I think there are!” Harry’s taste for adventure was never something that he understood, but being up in the sky, blatantly breaking the rules, tempting death itself, was the most liberated he had felt in years. Maybe ever. He allowed the wind to whip in his face as he grinned. “This is incredible.”
It was actually going pretty well. They decided to follow the railway track that the Hogwarts Express would be running on from a distance. It was difficult to talk, but Draco welcomed the peace. Being with Harry was usually so chaotic, he liked the fact that they were comfortable enough with each other that they didn’t need to constantly be talking. That silence could be comfortable rather than uncomfortable.
“Oh my gosh! Harry, I’m so sorry!” She was fumbling around, trying desperately to gather her belongings.
“Moony, Pads, I missed you.” he cried, as Harry silently burrowed closer, allowing himself to be fully sheltered by his family.
“I’ll firecall Dumbledore.” she said, crossing over to the fireplace. “Although it seems to be that we have a very convenient place right on the school grounds that Mr Lupin-Black used when he was in school.”
“Hello! This is my friend Draco.” Draco was shoved forward. Neither he nor Ron offered a hand. Draco was still wary of him, the judgy glances he had received before were nothing to the pure horror that painted Ron’s features now. He was used to this expression coming from people he didn’t know, Pads and Moony had explained it by saying that they were just scared of Pads for once being locked up in Azkaban, or Moony because of his scars. But that didn’t explain it now. Clearly, Draco was scaring the boy.
Sirius coughed pointedly. “When you two are finished.” he smirked, eyes glittering. The pair separated with a blush and giggled nervously. “The twins and I are going to go and annoy Peeves, do you want to come?” Suddenly, Draco felt lighter, more carefree, and he agreed, dragging Harry along with him.
He felt a warm hand on his shoulder and looked up to see the warm face of James Potter grinning down at him.
“Harry, let’s go, we shouldn’t be seen here.” Draco tugged on Harry’s arm persistently. “Harry, come on!” But he couldn’t move. His feet seemed glued to the ground. “Harry!” The other boy’s warning was fruitless, however, because Peeves was hovering above their heads, ready to blow.
“Of course, take as much time as you need.” Dumbledore and Minevra left the kitchen, taking Draco, and settled themselves in the lounge, sharing a look of hope. With the tuition of two of the most powerful wizards in the generation, Draco would be sure to grow up to be a worthy opponent of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Both Professors knew that they hadn’t seen that last of the Dark Lord. And that it was only a matter of time.
The flames fell to reveal a crimson bird the size of a swan, carrying a bundle of what looked like old clothes. It swooped down, dropped the heap at Harry’s feet, and landed on Harry’s shoulder.
Malfoy proceeded to introduce the rest of their entourage, before Zabini and Nott brought out the chests. “Great-uncle-in-law, I’ve brought some gifts that reminded me of you. I hope you’ll like them,” the hope in the blonde’s face and voice was genuine.
For once, concern entered Zabini’s face. “You can’t face two hours of morning assembly with an empty stomach… Maybe just have some toasts...”
“That would really help us,” Malfoy looked pleased too. One of his first few tasks was organising his own engagement party. Judging from how he had planned for and hosted his banquets so far, Harry wasn’t worried. “Shall we expect another happy announcement from your mother soon?”
Half an hour later, when they were enjoying their desert, almond tofu - mildly sweet and really smooth in the mouth - Zhongli was still engrossed in discussions with Hermione.
At Harry’s answer, the Queen was filled with anger. She stepped away, her face contorting in fury. “If you’re that afraid of them, confiscate their wealth! Strip them off their lands and titles! You are the king, aren’t you!?”
The strange moment was broken when Luna arrived. “I’m sorry I’m late.” For once, the witch was dressed not in whimsical bright coloured robes and her favourite pink armadillo earrings. She wore form-fitting baby blue dress-robes that matched her eyes, and her flowy pale blonde hair was loosely braided and secured with a gold pin. She looked like a doll.
“Wait, what?” if the carriage wasn’t airborne, Harry would have stood up. “Explain,” he commanded irately.
On the King’s right, his Queen was glaring hatefully at the man who was to be her husband’s second spouse.
The delegations from Kasha hightailed it back to their territories the next day, and a migraine had formed behind Harry’s eyes.
Harry squinted at the blonde who was currently sitting so closely to Mahoutokoro’s Head Boy they were almost in each other’s lap.
The messenger inhaled sharply. “This early morning, Durmstrang attacked Count Nott’s fiefdom… and the Count has surrendered!”
“Oh?” Zhongli looked delighted. His face didn’t let out much, but somehow, he wore his heart on his sleeves. “That’s so thoughtful of you, Cousin-in-law.”
Harry couldn’t help but think that if Ron were there, the redhead would have groaned and said something along the line of, “Really? How desperate are we?”
A comfortable silence dawned upon the small committee which had been formed to select Harry’s Second Consort. Harry initially thought there was no need for a committee with such a ridiculous purpose, but the moment Hermione asked him who he would propose to, Harry came up with a blank. The committee had proved very useful indeed.
“I am so sorry, Your Majesty!” The messenger dropped to his knees. He was sweating bullets. “Lord Shacklebolt has a very urgent and important message for you!”
Coming from another person, Zabini might have found the question so rude and intrusive, but Zabini only laughed at his childhood friend. “Thankfully, not for the moment, no,” the handsome wizard shuddered.
Childe Tartaglia picked up his chopsticks, which were lacquered in gold and looked very different from the ones Malfoy, Zabini and Nott were using, with relish. The redhead put the red scarf that had looked like a bloody wound across his torso out of the way. He clapped his hands together and exclaimed. “I will partake!”
instead of rejoicing that all his wet dreams were coming true. (Come to think of it, he didn’t have wet dreams of her. He didn’t have wet dreams, period. His subconscious was, unfortunately, filled with nightmares still.) Since then, they had barely talked.
“Greetings, Your Majesties. I am honoured to meet you. This humble subject wishes the Great Kingdom of Petra everlasting glory,” the pureblood wizard blithely carried on, purposely ignoring the stares from Harry’s wife and busybody courtiers.
Harry blinked… the striking man was… Zhongli himself!? Harry had thought he was the butler, or another guest of Zhongli. From all accounts, Zhongli should be at least seventy years old, but the man in front of them only appeared to be in his twenties… Even early thirties was stretching it.
The letter it carried was subjected to a variety of spells to test for curses and hexes, before it was declared safe and handed to the male monarch.
Although they had lost their political power, those conservative purebloods had wealth and network. They still had influence on people who were loyal to them. Their grip on various institutions across the Kingdom wasn’t inconsiderable either. Alienating the entire group would only prove to be harmful.
Charlie Weasley uncrossed his leg and made to get up, but he was startled when Ronald Weasley banged his fist on the round table. “How about us?”
Harry was startled off his deep thoughts as he was reading through the tax reports Percy had compiled for him. The green-eyed wizard saw his wife standing by the door of his bedchamber in a thin nightgown.
“Glad you like it,” Harry squashed the guilt in his heart and forced a smile on his face. “Let’s eat.”
Harry stepped closer to his fiance, his arms flapping about, not sure what to do. But Zhongli beat Harry to it. “Sshh,” he took the blonde into his arms, and rubbed his back kindly.
Harry gave it to his owl without giving himself the opportunity to crumple the letter. By this point, he just wanted it over and done with.
“Not at all, Your Majesty!” Harry felt slightly guilty that his acting had made the elderly wizard drop to his knees, his bones creaking audibly. “I am loyal to Your Majesty! Never have I harboured the thought of having anyone else on the throne!” He suddenly turned and snapped his fingers. “Lizzy!”
The door opened slightly wider, and Harry could see Malfoy slowly rising to his feet, weighted down by velvet midnight blue robes with silver embroideries of a crane on the chest. He raised his hand and left it hanging in the air.
McGonagall cleared her throat. “I need to…pre-empt you that our counterparts are exceedingly polite, and it is in their culture to never show outright rejection and contempt. You are all old enough to be considered adults, and we are already imposing on them. I do NOT want to hear any news of you causing trouble, am I clear?”
Harry had come to rely on Hermione tremendously over the war. He didn’t want to be with such a dangerous person without her.
“Come on,” Hermione scowled, but her eyes were filled with delight. “You’re Gryffindors, aren’t you? Where’s your courage? Your spirit of adventure?”
“Rise,” Harry remarked indifferently before Malfoy could say anything. He didn’t want the blonde to be too lenient. Nott was one of Malfoy’s closest friends in Hogwarts. Not lackeys like Goyle or the late Crabbe, but a real friend. “Say what you have come to say.”
“No!!!” Ginny’s reaction wasn’t any less intense the second time around. If anything, it was the opposite. Her chair toppled as she shot to her feet. “I thought you said you don’t want to!”
Even without being able to see half his face, Harry knew Malfoy was queasy. “You know King Riddle was… obsessed with the idea of immortality, right?”
Two years ago, Harry had no eye for quality at all, but after ascending the throne, and especially months of Malfoy dragging Harry into trade negotiations with merchants of goods, luxury items and commodities alike, the King would like to think that he was now at least able to tell apart expensive and cheap things.
In the end, they settled for a platinum ring with watermelon tourmaline teardrop cut and tiny diamonds, the pink so dark it looked red. Unlike most tourmalines, there was no clear separation between the green and the pink colours [1]. The precious stone carried with it Harry’s wish for the future of Petra.
the thought crossed Harry’s mind, but he couldn’t help it. Malfoy always had the ability to turn Harry into his worst self.
Ron had, with flaming cheeks, told Harry that Harry had his blessing to ‘move his relationship with Ginny forward’, before fleeing the Burrow with the excuse of helping George in the shop.
“You made the right decision,” McGonagall reassured him. “Petra has always been a divided Kingdom. Now, and a hundred years ago. There was a reason Tom Riddle was able to worm into the hearts of those purebloods… he exploited their fears. Power will continuously swing between the two factions until something is done to bridge the differences.”
The panic in the older wizard’s face was unmistakable, before the emotion was quickly extinguished and replaced with a wide smile.
Harry imagined the memories weren’t all that pleasant for the elderly witch… they were memories she’d rather buried, and he wasn’t going to force her to dig them back out…
“I, on the other hand, understand very well the value of money,” Harry tensed when Tartaglia leaned over the blonde. “And I know… expensive gifts are
Harry stopped eavesdropping and walked away carefully, quiet as a mouse. He looked down at the food on his trolley. What was he going to do with these?
“Especially about Durmstrang, where the Snezhnaya empire used to be,” Hermione crossed her arms. “Lord Tartaglia is obviously fond of Lord Zhongli. For some reason, Lord Zhongli can’t - or won’t, I don’t know - stay in Han. The two can’t live in Yamato anymore and it’s more… comfortable for them to move somewhere they’re welcome in the King’s court. So that is what we are offering them. Did I cover everything?” she asked the blonde.
“In the class we did tea, so that’s what you have to do.” Harry said simply, as though it explained everything.
There wasn’t a dry eye in the house, and Sirius regretted deciding not to bring a handkerchief because the tears were trickling down his cheeks. He felt, however, the pad of Remus’s thumb wipe them away. He met eyes with his soon-to-be husband and felt such a wave of emotion that he had never felt before. Could it be - hope? Just like James was talking about?
The Basilisk flailed around in pain, thrashing and crashing into stone pillars, knocking them over. But Harry seemed to use this to his advantage, randomly swinging at it, missing it completely for the most part. That was, until he seemed to use the rest of his strength to plunge the sword into the roof of the beast's mouth, and getting one long, poisonous fang speared into his forearm in the process.
After marvelling at the decor, which was odd but strangely welcoming, they sat themselves down on the sofa by the stove and watched as Luna poured some misty, steaming liquid into six cups.
Sirius was momentarily taken aback by the statement and had to think about it for a few seconds. It took him just about that long to realise that his friend was referring to the crush he had confided in him half a year before over a game of Truth or Dare, with veritaserum stolen from Slughorn’s cupboard, on their curly haired friend. But he wouldn’t be stupid enough to get a tattoo for Moony! He leaned back in his chair with an air of nonchalance and watched his werewolf friend take a deep drink from his butterbeer and lick his lips clean of residue. The dark honey eyes latching onto his own and holding the gaze, daring him to look away. Suddenly, Sirius didn’t see any objections to the obsessive crush tattoo.
against his lips, exactly like he did they first time they said it. If only things were still that simple.
“We could use the Charms classroom on the second floor?” Draco suggested, but Sirius interrupted him.
Harry smiled excitedly and raised his wand to quickly disarm his Professor, before looking over at Draco who was casting some spell Harry didn’t know.
The girl nodded. “And you’re Draco.” She paused and watched him intensely for a few prolonged seconds, in which Ron started exploring the garden, which seemed to be growing some kind of plant that Draco had never heard of. “Your head looks like a Nargle hive.”
, Harry thought to himself, directing the beam of light at the ground to find the scampering rodent at his feet.
“Thank you, Buckbeak.” he said. It tilted it’s head in response and Harry returned to the group to find Draco as white a sheet.
Madame Pomfrey did arrive, carefully hiding her shock at the gouges in his arms. He didn’t really pay her much attention, even though he should. The poor woman had her work cut out for her tonight. Instead, he just let her levitate his body down the passage, which cleverly led directly into her office, and then to the Hospital Wing.
“The Dementors will be under strict orders to bring him to us. The Wizengamot will decide his fate from there.” Fudge replied instead.
Arthur was probably Harry’s favourite, though. He was absolutely fascinated by muggle objects, and spent ages getting Harry to explain things to him in the most adorable way. Harry actually really liked it, it made him feel smart and he loved seeing the look of utter wonder in the man’s face when he saw a paperclip or a clicky pen in action.
“Ha. Yes, your father and he were best friends.” Harry considered this for a moment, watching Pads with curious eyes.
They all smiled warmly and crowded around his side of the bed. “Remus,” Sirius started. “If you’re a monster, then so am I. And so is James, and Pete. We’re best friends, we stick together through anything.”
They opened it to reveal some sickles and a few knuts, but ignored them in favour of carefully folding up the sock and making sure it was secure.
It was all shattered however when he woke up one morning to find McGonagall in distress and disarray.
Harry thought about this. “Nah. You guys keep a hold of the other one, I’ll just keep running away from it. I’ll be fine.” The other boy didn’t look to reassured, but did what Harry said nonetheless. It was good, because Harry had seen a glint of gold near the bottom of the teacher’s stand. He raced towards it, a bludger on his tail, but had to turn around when he realised that the glint was just someone’s lost watch.
“You say it just enough, I think. I love you too.” Sirius turned himself so that he was lying on his side, and Draco mirrored him, invested in the seriousness of the discussion.
Exam revision had momentarily put a pause on Harry, Ron, Draco and Hermione’s investigation. The latter two immersed themselves in piles of work, testing each other night and day, and the former simple did their best to keep up. Occasionally, though, when they weren’t feeling too up to Potions or Transfiguration, Ron and Harry speculated over Snape’s nefarious intentions. Draco didn’t like it all that much, and reminded them continuously that exams should be their top priority, but they didn’t listen and instead decided that they would go and have tea with the gamekeeper, of all things, to ‘try and find out some more information’. While they were there, Draco took a break from studying and talked with Hermione.
The Slytherin Common room was cooler than Draco had expected. There were skulls carved into the walls and the windows peered into a murky green lake. Upon entrance, he and Harry raced to the window, hoping to catch a glimpse of the giant squid, before being told by a Slytherin Prefect that the slippery thing hardly ever visited.
“I know but my little star won’t want to be embarrassed by his dad!” Sirius replied, finally placing Draco back on the floor.
Hope you're having a lovely day! I just wanted to say a quick thank you for all of the love and support on this series. Thank you to everyone who has given this a kudos or bookmarked it or ever commented on it, thank you even more if you comment regularly I see who you all are and I'm so grateful <3<3 And thank you for keeping up with my inconsistent upload schedule lol
Harry didn’t quite know what he wanted, it had been so hectic, his mind was buzzing. He didn’t know the Weasley family very well at all, and he had been looking forward to spending three weeks with McGonagall, who had since alluded to their having a few Quidditch matches. Still, Hogwarts wasn’t really as magical as it was before, and he could do with a break.
“I understand that Draco and Harry are going to develop, and grow stronger and that they cannot be kept in close quarters all year long. I really do. But Harry isn’t going back there, we promised him that. I have a suggestion.”
“I think the better question is, can we help you?” George said mysteriously, sharing a look with Fred and smirking. Harry furrowed his brow, and was about to ask what they were on about, when George grabbed his right arm while Fred grabbed the left, and he was being dragged down the stairs roughly.
Thank you guys again for all the kudos, comments, bookmarks literally anything it makes me so happy all of it ❤️❤️
“Oh Merlin. Moony look!” Remus watched as his husband turned a sickly yellow before following his line of vision to take in the boy. He was a carbon copy of James, couldn’t be mistaken, it was unnerving. And that scar proved what he already knew to be true.
Harry and Draco were lying next to each other on Draco’s bed, staring up at the ceiling, slowly processing the events of the previous night, when the door slammed wide open to reveal their head of house glaring at them thunderously. They both sat up to talk to him properly, but he didn’t stay very long.
Once it was finally over, he fell, like a paper doll onto the floor, choking on the bitter taste of his own blood, and the saltiness of tears. He never usually cried. Somewhere along the line, he became numb to the pain. He wept now for the loss of his childhood, the normal life he could have had, for the secret he held onto with everything he had, the disappointment in his father’s eyes when they saw each other, the confusion in Sirius’s when he explained his monthly disappearances, the knowledge that disgust could so easily replace it with one slip of the tongue. He wept out of exhaustion. Sheer, brutal, raw exhaustion that made his teeth chatter, jaw ache and bones shiver. He wept because he didn’t see much left to live for, and for the knowledge that he could never bring himself to lose hope that someday there would be.
Remus sniffled. “It’s just - I know what it’s like to be powerful and it’s not fun. It’s painful and upsetting and I know it’ll feel the same, if not worse for them.”
The Phoenix swooped down, perched itself on Harry’s leg and seemed to cry. Wait - no - it actually was crying, golden tears. Draco watched in disbelief - healing tears, how could he have forgotten?
So, over the Easter break, which he was forced to spend at Hogwarts, Harry spent night upon night in the restricted section, all to result in absolutely nothing new.
“Oh, son of a Hippogriff, seriously?” said Draco, rolling his eyes. Of course they now had to deal with a dragon. “Weasley, isn’t your brother a dragon expert or something? Can’t we just get him over here to take the dragon?”
“Now, why don’t you try, Draco? Meet Pads on the other side.” said Remus, trying to keep his voice calm.
Sirius did actually find a boggart in one of the upstairs cabinets and brought it to Hogwarts, following Remus’s instruction and putting it in one of the unused classrooms, so that Harry and Remus could practice. Draco refused to attend on the principle that the vision would be too much for him if he had to suffer it again, but that was okay. Harry felt sure that his friend would produce a Patronus in no time.
Draco was sitting in Potions when his owl finally returned to him. With Professor Snape’s permission, he took the letter from the bird, gave it a treat and sent it back to the Owlery. The actual note contained little important information, only to keep his nose out of the matter and that Dumbledore probably had a good reason, which didn’t sound like Pads which suggested that Moony had calmed him down. When he returned to his seat, Draco passed the letter to Harry, who let out a huff of indignation that sounded like he was annoyed at the lack of content the letter provided, but the pair turned their attention back to the board and Snape, who had just started assigning them partners from the other house which was, in this case, Gryffindor.
“You’re human, Draco, nobody deserves that kind of treatment.” Draco smiled at her, she really did seem to know it all.
, and I didn’t want to imagine what Harry was going through.” He breathed, in and out, Remus’s hand on his shoulder. “But, seeing his face when I told him he would never have to see them again...it just... I can’t understand what went through your mind. It’s sick.” Sirius finally stopped. Remus could see the horrors he had been through flicking across his mind, Harry’s face being a constant. He could only imagine what the poor boy’s face had looked like, but judging from Sirius’s reaction, it wasn’t good.
“Hey! I’m totally trustworthy…” Remus watched as his wonderful son and husband argued playfully and smiled. When he first was bitten, he didn’t even know if he could have a family let alone one so incredible as this one. The universe was clearly making up for the huge injustice they did him before. The only word that could be used to describe his emotions in that moment was
It was agony, every time. Like his heart didn’t quite fit in his chest and was trying to break free, as though it were trying to escape the horror that was his body. Screaming out in agony did nothing to relieve the pain, but he couldn’t help it.
A warm weight on his shoulder brought Draco into consciousness. He was in bed, at home, lying in a pool of cold sweat. Moony and Pads were crouched next to him, checking him over with worried glances.
Draco had spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to get Harry. He knew that the boy was reckless and caring, and loved learning new things, but only when it was something that interested him. Eventually, Draco came to the decision of getting Harry a book. But not just any book, one that he had found the last time he visited Grimmauld Place, which had been a few days prior to because Sirius had wanted to fetch the old photographs. The book was unassuming from the outside, but within was an Encyclopedia of all things wizard. Harry simply needed to wave his wand over it and it would show him all the information it could find. He loved it. He raved on and on, once they had made it back to Draco’s room, about how useful it would be for learning about the Wizarding World, and also their research on Nicolas Flamel.
Not wanting to be left out (and not having a Marauders’ Map for this Castle), Harry tried to excuse himself to the toilet and follow them. Until he was caught.
Slughorn perked up as well. “An excellent suggestion,” he rubbed his chin. “If I recalled correctly, he had considerable influence even before he became a prefect… He could even be said to be the leader of his peers…”
Two students, a pretty girl with long black hair and lovely fair skin and a lean, slightly tanned boy with wild dark brown hair stepped up to her. “These are my Head Girl and my Head Boy, Miss Daidouji Tomoyo, and Mr-”
But recently, Harry had been observing Malfoy eating a lot of proteins the mornings they ate together - sausages, scrambled eggs, sometimes even fish - Harry didn’t know if the blonde’s tastes had simply changed, or he just ate with consideration of what his baby needed.
Ginny visibly twitched. Harry forced a wide smile onto his face. He’d only been in the stifling red and gold robes that he was forced into for less than an hour, and his entire body already itched. His official crown was heavy too. “We are happy to have you as well.”
Students were streaming past them in the opposite direction as they walked through the hallways, chattering to each other in excitement for the day or groaning over homework or tests. Since the air was abuzz with magic, Harry assumed there was translation spell weaved into the wards. The boys were wearing a high-collared black uniform with gold brass buttons and long black trousers, while the girls, including the Head Girl, were wearing navy pleated skirts and shirts with sailor-style navy collars which had two white stripes and red neckerchiefs. The younger girls wore white shirts, while older girls’ shirts were the same dark navy blue as their collars. Most of them also wore robes which had baggy sleeves, the younger students’ robes mostly faint pink, and older ones in various shades of peach, salmon, and gradually, pale yellow, and some gold.
Dean and Neville stared as Seamus cut a huge portion of Shepherd pie for himself. “Leave some for us, mate!”
Harry blanched. “All the more this proposition has no merit for him,”  he began to pace around the room. The King paled when he remembered about Draco’s mother. “Narcissa Malfoy… I owed her a Life Debt, too. She demanded that I pardoned House Malfoy…”
The wizarding world has always struck Harry as conservative. The fact that ‘proper’ wizards dressed like they were in 1920s and Harry rarely heard news about other wizarding communities helped. Before Harry left the Dursleys, he remembered muggle TV had begun covering globalisation more frequently. He also remembered Dudley buying a ‘laptop’ and chatting with people from the other side of the globe using the ‘internet’. By necessity and their secretive nature, wizarding communities tended to be isolationists; ideas did not travel across communities that well. Why, no other communities had interfered in Britain’s second wizarding war, despite the fact that muggle USA was known for foreign interventions.
The blonde began to appear indignant, but Harry’s intuition was not wrong. Li looked apologetic as he stated his demands. “House Li does not wish for any money… but House Li also wishes for a child to be born from House Li and House Malfoy.”
A tiny frown appeared on her face. “You’ve let the korekore clouds hang all over you, Harry. It’s making you sick.”
“It’s nothing,” the redhead swaggered to the beautiful man and wrapped his arm around that slender black-clad waist. “We ought to spruce this mansion up a bit.”
But the dizziness quickly disappeared due to the sight that greeted him: a majestic Castle at the top of a mountain, illuminated by golden rays of a sun barely risen from the horizon, shining on red pillars and green mutton-fat jade of the roof. The same curling roof which were etched on the stone door. The sky was a myriad of purple and dark orange, clouds lined in yellow edges so bright Harry had to look away.
Harry straightened up immediately. Count Shacklebolt was the elected ‘Hand of the King’, the leader of a small council whose job was to oversee the House of Lords. Harry respected the wizard immensely. “Speak,” he commanded.
Harry sighed inwardly. Their relationship had been tense since the bespectacled boy’s birthday, when Ginny had offered herself to Harry – organising a night out without Molly Weasley knowing was no mean feat – and Harry
“Good morning to you too, Harry,” the brunette said idly. She’d always been saying that Harry had gotten more and more rude the longer he’d been King. “Did you have a good sleep?”
Harry could literally hear everyone stop talking. Other guests turned to them discreetly, their curiosity plenty visible, although not to the point of being rude.
Harry sighed inwardly. The conversation to let her know not to show her displeasures so openly would not be fun...
Malfoy himself had opined that the Aurors’ decision was unwise, but did nothing else when Harry didn’t budge. He came to morning assemblies as usual, accompanied Harry to functions with overseas dignitaries as usual and cooperated with Harry in managing various internal affairs and the Castle’s household matters as usual.
Harry sighed inwardly. “Gin,” he reached out for her hand. “I’ve promised you that I won’t give my heart to anyone else, haven’t I?” His voice was placating.
Harry cleared his throat. “I’ll leave it to you, Draco.” They had agreed privately that Harry should call the blonde by his given name in public.
“I understand, Tim,” Francis sounded relieved. The entire delegations of Kasha rose to their feet as Harry looked up from his bow. “King Harold, I’m afraid we would have to retire early tonight. I hope you understand.”
As Harry raised his eyebrow, the other wizard continued. “As Your Majesty is aware, currently I am the only son of House Malfoy. My bloodline will end if I do not produce any heir for House Malfoy. Sure, Mother is still fertile, but she is getting on in years… pregnancy will be tough on her…”
[2] Xiao Long means little dragon. Syaoran means little wolf, and Draco means dragon… so that’s their endearment for each other.
Harry put down his cup with a clink against the porcelain saucer. “Yes,” he leaned back casually against his chair, every inch the King of a powerful Kingdom he was. “Well, I’m sure you didn’t need me to spell it out loud.”
When Harry was sixteen, King Tom learned of Harry’s existence, and the Order of the Phoenix was forced to strike.
It was a beautiful piece of jewelry. The oval peridot that made its centrepiece was as big as a grape, vibrant and brilliant in its lustre, the warm olive green colour blending well with the rectangular diamond petals that surrounded the peridot in a ring, as well as the gold-plated ivies design of the velvet choker. The symbol of ‘李’ could be seen faintly through the clear jewel.
But her husband wasn’t letting go of her hand. The King turned to her and met her eyes. Finally, a spark of life entered those green eyes. “Ginny, I’m not keen either,” he said sincerely. “Believe me.”
Indeed, the Slytherin table had almost halved in population, with the newly sorted first-years and the lower years making up the majority. They huddled at the end close to the door, and upon hearing McGonagall address them, seemed to impossibly cling to each other even closer.
Luna looked pleasantly surprised to be invited. “Sure, Draco,” she replied casually. Luna claimed that Malfoy had been kind to her during her captivity in Malfoy Manor and she had treated him like a friend since he joined Harry’s court. It was Malfoy who maintained a distance with her, seemingly afraid of the dreamy former Ravenclaw student. Harry didn’t care as long as Malfoy treated Luna with respect.
The King of Kasha, Francis d’Aumont, was a middle-aged man with chestnut blonde hair and an amiable smile. His voice was pleasant as he greeted Harry. “Thank you very much for the invitation, King Harold and Queen Ginerva. We are so happy that Petra has decided to open her borders to us again, after 30 years.” He gestured at his company, a dark-haired woman who was decked to the nines in shiny precious stones and luxurious purple silk robes, and a blonde blue-eyed man whose somber, dark robes couldn’t hide how gorgeous he was. He wore a bejeweled choker that one really couldn’t miss, a diamond almost as big as a pebble adorning its centre. “Please let me introduce you to my Queen, Maria Carolina, and my Maîtresse-en-titre, Timothée Clement.”
The blonde caught it, but he did not appear perturbed. He merely turned to Daphne Greengrass to respond to what she said, as though what had transpired between him and Ginny didn’t occur.
The bespectacled boy shook his head. “I prefer them fried, too,” he chimed as he piled fish and chips onto his plate.
“Mahoutokoro,” Hermione corrected reflexively as she squinted at two robes in her hands, murmuring, “What’s the climate like in Minami Iwo Jima?”
Harry raised his eyebrow. “... I have fully pardoned you for the…” He hesitated to release the word into the air again. The knowledge of horcruxes was better off fully exterminated from the world.
Malfoy stopped scratching Li’s hands and was openly crying now. The couple had forgotten Harry’s existence entirely. “W-wolf,” the blonde hiccoughed, “w-what if the child won’t have… it hasn't showed up in Mother and me… despite my name-”
The dark skinned wizard dropped his persona and shook his head. “I can’t get over how fast you tie yourself down. I myself probably won’t have a child until I’m thirty, at least,” he leaned back on his chair languidly.
“And of course, I am very, very grateful for the amnesty, Your Majesty,” Slughorn was quick to follow up. “Perhaps… ‘safe’ isn’t the most appropriate word… more like… ‘respected’?” He murmured.
Zabini stood quietly at the sideline with a smile on his own face, like he was glad his previous Housemates reconciled and he didn’t just pour oil into the fire a few minutes ago. After the two blondes stepped back and recomposed themselves, the handsome wizard clapped his hands. “Now, who’s up for some breakfast? I have some blueberry scones."
Harry’s eyes widened. He’d been part of the wizarding world for eight years, but it was the first time he heard that wizards could get pregnant. There was always something new to discover, it seemed impossible to catch up.
“Please forgive me for my rudeness earlier. Nice to meet you. I am Harry, son of James and Lily Potter,” the King gave a polite nod.
“Never.” Harry was watching him with the same wide-eyed adoration that he wore whenever Draco did something to impress him, or was anticipating that Draco would do something to impress him. The look that Draco could never resist. He sighed, pressed the button that turned the thing invisible for Muggles and started the engine.
“Ser-i-ous is really my godfather?” Remus chuckled at Harry’s slight mispronunciation of his husband's name.
Although he’d not had a lesson himself yet, Draco had heard wonderful things about his Moony and was very proud, boasting about it to anyone who would listen. He’d heard Harry call him ‘cute’ but chose to ignore it. In the fleeting moments Draco and Remus actually got to see each other, it was evident that the man enjoyed his job exceedingly, which was something his son was very happy about.
Harry fumbled with the key a little before it clicked in the lock and opened the door. Behind it, was a large room filled with a giant chess set. All eyes immediately turned to Ron, who was probably the best player in the room.
“I was going to keep it here. You must understand, Harry, that this place is even safer than Gringotts.”
“Yeah.” said Draco breathlessly. “Just… a lot of emotion, y’know?” Draco reached for Harry’s hand and weaved their fingers together. “It hasn’t been that bad since the Quidditch match, usually I can calm it down.”
“No.” Remus whispered, low and deafening. “They don’t need the burden just yet, let them enjoy being children for just a little longer.”
- I say this all the time, but I'm tired. If you see any spelling mistakes I miss, I won't be offended if you tell me in the comments, in fact, I'll be grateful. I know you think it might sound rude if you tell me, but I promise you won't, you'll just be doing me a favour.
“Doesn’t know what he’s saying.” said Lockhart, whipping out his wand. “Not to worry, Harry. I’m about to fix your arm.”
“I am. Just because we have managed to keep it under wraps for such a long time doesn’t mean it's not real. For all we know, that dog is just another one of the misfits Dumbledore has to keep safe.” Remus’s voice was soft now, gentle but firm. “Even if we don’t trust Dumbledore, we trust Minerva, don’t we? She’ll keep them safe.”
As they kissed, Sirius could feel the Earth’s curve beneath his feet. The dawning of a new hope settled in his chest like the coming of a fresh day, but an ominous tugging of apprehension toyed with his gut. He batted it away, however, and focused solely on his husband, and the little family he was growing for himself.
Remus groaned slightly and sat down, spreading the chocolate out on the table for everyone to enjoy. Draco immediately snatched up a large chunk.
Everyone helped cleaning the dishes, exchanging very small amounts of speech for designating tasks, until Harry was scrubbing at a plate a little harder than was necessary and Remus engulfed him in a hug, followed by Sirius, followed by Draco, who burrowed under his father’s arms to the centre, where he, too, wrapped his arms around Harry. The best thing about his family, Draco thought, was that they didn’t need to exchange words in order to know that they were there for each other.
“Please, they did way worse stuff when they were at school. And Dumbledore won’t care, we’ll just tell them why we originally did it. He’ll be sympathetic and won’t tell on us to Filch. Now please, Harry, can we go to bed?” Harry felt better now that he knew adults would be getting involved, and not in a bad way. But it still didn’t help the irking in his chest that told him to go back and see what it really was. Although, he reminded himself, he wouldn’t get anywhere without Draco.
“And you.” The man’s steely gaze was fixed on him now. “Draco Malfoy. Death Eater spawn, child of legend. I have been looking for you, too.”
“Where did you get it?” he pressed. When Harry wouldn’t answer, however, he receded. “What were you looking for? Lucius?”
Filch delivered the pair to Hagrid, who was standing outside the entrance to the forbidden forest with a large crossbow on his arm and a dozen arrows. It wasn’t the most comforting sight. It was clear that they would be going into the forest, but Draco wasn’t that afraid. He knew the stories of what his dad’s got up to in school better than anyone, and the forbidden forest was the least of his worries. Maybe if he explained to the creatures that he was the son of their werewolf and wiry dog friends they would understand? Harry, Draco and Fangs, Hagrid’s other dog, were sent off to one side of the woods to look for the dead unicorn and Hagrid was on his own, but Draco had no doubt that the man would defend himself. As they walked, Harry began explaining the strange conversation that he had heard earlier.
“I don’t know. I think he doesn’t really like Draco, he warned me to stay away from him.” Ron paused, looking wary.
“Who is he most excited to see? Or have you already seen them?” Blaise quickly glanced at Draco and gave Harry a pointed look.
“I’m sorry we can’t tell you, I wish we could.” She reached under her desk and pulled out a tin, which she opened to reveal an array of shortbreads. “Biscuit?” Harry chose one that resembled a dog and nodded to her in thanks. “I wanted to talk to you today because we have to come up with a place for you to go for the first half of the Summer holidays. I must say that when I heard about Dumbledore keeping you with those awful people, I was outraged.” Harry’s eyes widened, he had never heard McGonagall angry at someone who wasn’t a student, to someone who was her boss not less. “It seems that you will be staying at Hogwarts for that period of time, unless we can find someone to take you in. I will be here too, to keep an eye on you.”
“How about I talk first, Draco, would you like that?” His father’s voice was so icy, so persuasive, it reminded him of his own. The now greasy, silver hair was the exact shade of his own, the nose, the mouth, almost everything on the face, besides the eyes, which weren’t as silvery as his own, more flat and lifeless, but that could be down to the dementors more than anything else.
“Now who’s the child, Moony?” Sirius had mostly recovered from his previous shock, and was now holding Draco as though he would never let go while his song struggled in his iron grasp.
“The Grim! I got it in class, and Trelawny made a big deal out of it, because she said it meant I was going to die, but now you’ve got it too!” Draco couldn’t tell if Harry looked worried, because it would be ridiculous to be worried about a stupid fortune, Tea Leaves shouldn’t control anyone’s lives, much less his, but there did seem to be a certain tension around his jaw that suggested certain stress.
“Rem!” James called, prancing down the halls, followed by Sirius, who was bounding after him like a dog.
“Only for you, Harry Potter. And there is something I know.” Harry’s eyes lit up and suddenly everything was worth it.
“Oh yeah, Drake. Which school are you most excited about. The pretty girls from Beauxbatons or the strong, feisty ones from Durmstrang?” Blaise asked, smirking.
However, that night on the Marauders Map, Harry noticed something strange. He was only doing his nightly sweep of the castle for the name ‘Lucius Malfoy’ when another appeared right under his nose. ‘Peter Pettigrew’.
It started off with some kids from older years, who were very slow and had messy turns, and a second year, who dropped the ball after five seconds of being in possession of it. When Draco lifted off, Harry could feel his confidence from his place in the stands, and he cheered even louder than Ron and Hermione, who had come to support Draco, seeing as they had all gotten closer over the summer.
Peter was the one who actually said something. “Are you a werewolf?” he asked, expression as pure and oblivious as the day he was born.
As Remus got older, the gaps between the transformations seemed to get shorter. In no time, he was making his way down to the shack with Madame Pomfrey at his side, through the secret tunnel Dumbledore had built. They were a little off with the timing though, because the changing started halfway down.
He caught the Snitch within twenty minutes. He tried to explain it away, citing that it was just dumb luck, but he knew that he had been trying to beat his friend with every ounce of his being.
So I'm considering this their first kiss, I know they've kissed before but I thought this was too epic!!!
“Look, we think that Snape is trying to steal whatever Fluffy is guarding! Please, help usssss…” Harry had turned on the puppy eyes that Draco simply couldn’t resist. They were terrifyingly green. Suddenly, a light bulb switched on in his head and he watched Harry beg for a few more seconds before huffing indignantly.
Thankfully, Dumbledore saved him, and sent the dementors running straight after, but it was a miracle that Harry was okay, that his broom was the only thing that had broken.
“I cannot be telling yous. I is not meant to be here.” The elf then tried to start hitting his head against the desk then, by Sirius grabbed him by the collar and hoisted him up again.
“HARRY!” Draco was in the front garden of his house, waiting for Pads to arrive with Harry. It had been too long, three weeks was the longest the pair had been separated since they met, and letters didn’t quite cover it. The second Draco saw Harry’s face, he charged forward and wrapped him in a hug, nearly knocking the boy off his feet.
The Weasleys and Hermione said their goodbyes at about eight, and Hagrid excused himself as he had to go and feed some animal he was currently trying to breed. McGonagall herself stayed for a little longer, but had to get up to the castle for an urgent meeting with Dumbledore about the positioning for the Dementors, something that Harry had learned about from Sirius and Remus, something Harry had learned wasn’t very nice. But the Professor had told them that they were welcome to stay as long as they wanted.
With Ron, Hermione and Ginny in tow, Harry and Draco walked down the trail that led to the Lovegood’s house and knocked on the door, for it to be opened by a girl with platinum blonde hair and sparkly, purple earrings.
That was a good question. Draco had been offered by Moony and Pads countless times to change his name to Draco Lupin-Black, and he wanted to, but never did.
Draco could see Harry nodding in the sidecar. Neither of them said anything else until they landed on Hogwarts grounds, on which they were greeted with a group of Professors with thunderous expressions on their faces, and Draco’s parents, equally, if not more, furious. The boys shared a nervous look and took each other’s hands for support.
“Horace,” Harry used the permission straight away. It was Slughorn’s loss. “I have missed you, your brilliance and keen insight. Wouldn’t you come to my court?”
Harry couldn’t see anything beyond the door as it was opened – just mist – and McGonagall disappeared through it the moment she stepped through. A part of Harry’s mind was frozen in fear by how much the door reminded him of
Hermione continued to observe the blonde keenly. “Your target wasn’t your ‘Great uncle’, was it?” Harry could literally hear the air quotes.
The King felt the tap of a wand on his temple, and a cooling sensation helped reduce the sharp aches.
“Really?” As he turned to the Ravenclaw, he saw a glimpse of the red hair of the girl walking on the other side of Luna. Blue eyes met his briefly before Ginny gave a curt nod, and looked away quickly.
“Not quite…” Harry went along with his best friend’s antics. She wasn’t wrong either. “How about you?”
Harry caressed Teddy’s smooth cheeks. He had always loved children. “It’s our fault for not consulting you about the menu. We didn’t think of it. Besides,” he smiled when baby Teddy scrunched his nose, “You’ve not been following those customs for so long… It’s natural you forgot a lot of them.”
The King was about to discuss other terms and conditions of the marriage, when Li cleared his throat.
“You know that Durmstrang was born from the ashes of the Snezhnaya empire, right?” Malfoy began, the chilled handkerchief still covering his face. “And the Harbingers were the elites of the Fatui, the highest of the high. Even now, they still control intelligence networks all over the world. There is nothing they don’t know.”
Other gifts were appreciated more enthusiastically, each accompanied with bright eyes and a monologue.
The owl was caught by the guards before it could reach Harry, however. The majestic owl hooted indignantly as it perched on one of the chairs and fixed its ruffled feathers. The owl also helped itself to a plate of crispy bacon, golden eyes glaring at the guard who stepped forward to move it away from the dining hall.
“It’s almost time,” Harry picked up a long wooden cane, the portkey that had been prepared for the trip. “Let’s go,” he said brusquely.
“Greetings, Your Majesty, I am so sorry to intrude upon Your Kingdom,” Lord Li said pleasantly in a slightly husky voice. His Petran wasn’t accented at all. Every part of his speech, mannerism and demeanor screamed high-class, privileged conservative pureblood. “I merely worry for my betrothed,” Li peered at Malfoy visibly.
Only then, the King noticed that Malfoy wasn’t wearing just any green robes; he was wearing the green robes he’d worn when he brought Lord Li along to meet with Harry for the first time all those months ago, the high-necked silk with golden dragon and wolf embroideries. Now that Harry was aware that Syaoran meant ‘little wolf’, he strongly objected to this attire.
“Harry,” hands searched his face, touching all over, “you won’t give your heart to anyone else, won’t you?” Her eyes were bright in the dimly lit air, candle flames flickering in the background.
Harry blinked. He was about to open his mouth when Malfoy shot his childhood friend a deadpan stare. “Blaise…” he said warningly.
Malfoy rose to his feet and began to pace around the small dais. It was rare to see him this agitated. “What… how… why? Last time I heard, Great-uncle-in-law and Childe are in Yamato…”
As Ginny spoke, Harry could see Fleur cringing from the other side of the long dining table. She made some abortive movements with her hands, and the blonde part-Veela sighed at the end of Ginny’s questions.
needed to follow Timothée back to the rooms Harry had arranged for his royal guests, but it wasn’t a point worth arguing. “Of course,” the green-eyed man smiled. “We wish you a good rest, Your Majesties.”
Harry wanted to rub his temples. Another one of those customs only the secretive pureblood society knew. “I see,” he remarked curtly. “I will also require you to produce an heir for my dynasty. Let’s put into the contract that your first child will carry on the duchy of Gryffindor line, and your second child-”
There were no replies from Flint and Nott, but one morning, a majestic Eagle owl flew in from the window of his dining hall when Harry was having breakfast with Ginny, and swooped down, flapping its wide wings over plates of eggs, toasts and bacon.
Silence dawned upon young and older magicians alike. They were all recalling when the young woman spoke up in favour of turning Harry over to King Voldemort toward the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, where they were all huddling for shelter in the bombarded fortress.
The meal was a banquet fit for a King, indeed. Courses upon courses of delicious, sumptuous dishes were heaped onto Harry’s plate… shrimp dumplings, roasted boar, a soup of bamboo shoots and slices of pork belly that melted in one’s mouth… another soup with really rich broth made of crab, shrimps, ham and the most fragrant mushrooms… a consomme made of thinly sliced layers of ham, flavourful shredded chicken and mushrooms… fried rice made of… berries? And crunchy pieces of a type of nuts-
Tartaglia’s smile as he leaned on the windowsill still looked like it could devour Malfoy whole. “I look forward to your invitation.”
The tension broke in the worst possible way when Timothée took a sniff of the piece of meat he was served. “Is this… pork!?” he sounded very indignant.
Any other day, she would be his picture perfect image of home, her loosely braided hair resting on her left shoulder, her lap and stomach covered in a cozy blanket. Harry would press closer to her, tucking his cold feet under her calves. She would shriek and smack him before they both huddled under the covers, and Harry would rub her stomach and chat with the baby.
The group of people who had been making their way to the gate with the two winged boars, stopped moving.
“Yes,” Childe didn’t even spare a thought at his wallet. He was used to it by now. They had been together for a long, long time after all.
They sat in silence in a little alcove in the library, where a sofa and a wooden table for two had been set up. Draco took in the scent of ink and old parchments, the sight of scrolls tightly stacked together, before Little Wolf pulled him out of his musing. “You know, I’m sure by now you should be able to pronounce my name correctly,” he sounded amused.
As they continued to eat, Zhongli noticed Hermione eying the huge kite hung on the wall. It was bird-shaped and made of colourful silk, not the usual paper. “There are many debates about the origins of kites,” he started conversationally. Whenever he spoke, he always held the ladies’ rapt attention. Harry understood why; the man was just so knowledgeable. He was like a walking encyclopedia with a soothing deep voice. “However, there was a common folklore from the southern continents…”
Harry did not receive any reply. The next he checked, Lord and Lady Greengrass had followed their daughters and settled down in Kasha, leaving their fiefdom to be managed by their half-blood distant relatives.
“Raw fish dishes are called sashimi!” Hermione wagged her finger, “I heard they’re usually prepared by chef who have trained for years, so they are safe.”
Malfoy’s gaze turned soft. “Theo, I know you’re afraid of childbirth because of what happened with your birth father.” The blonde held the other pureblood’s white-knucked hand. “I know… yet I still took my revenge… Would you please forgive me?”
“No can do,” the Irish managed before shoving a large spoonful to his mouth, “you know, I heard they eat food raw there. Raw fish, raw horse meat, raw dog meat-”
“Is there anything I can hide from you, Draco?” Zabini flirted openly, his voice silky smooth like butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth.
“You screwed up really badly, Theo,” Zabini’s proud voice could be heard from the gap between the wall and the door. “You were lucky Lord Tartaglia interrupted when he did. It’s akin to stumbling out of the frying pan into the fire, though!”
“Lord Zhongli and Lord Tartaglia?” Both Harry and Hermione seemed surprised. Voldemort wasn’t someone who made social visits. “Why?”
“Your Majesty,” Harry counted it as his victory that Malfoy caved in first, “I believe you mentioned in your letter that you would like to discuss about the settlement…”
Barely fifteen minutes into the banquet, something had already turned out wrong. “Milord,” Ginny addressed Timothée for the first time that night, her smile stiff. Harry knew that the presence of the chief mistress only reminded her of yesterday’s argument. “How do you like your Merlot? Would you prefer other types of wine?”
Syaoran’s smile widened. “Me too,” his callous hand gave another squeeze. “Just drop the ‘little’, may be. We’re not so little anymore… Dragon.”
Technically, they weren’t family anymore, if ever at all. Zhongli is a childless widower of House Li who had left, and Malfoy didn’t even marry into House Li.
It was Malfoy who saved him. “Your Majesty, maybe you heard wrongly,” the blonde pasted a smile on his face. Harry recognised that mask; he’d seen it not budge under the onslaught of threats and insults. “Great-uncle-in-law, I would like to introduce you to the King of Petra.”
Zabini spluttered. He made some vague noises of protest, which died down soon. “Is there anything I can hide from you, Draco?”
“But I’m so weak-” Malfoy buried his face against Li’s shoulder and hid more of himself underneath the wide sleeves of Li’s robes.
It was so quiet one could hear a pin drop. Harry himself felt like he was sizzling in fire, like there was so much pressure against his skin his body couldn’t contain it all. He felt like he was going to burst. The air around him crackled with energy.
A tense silence descended upon the room again. As Harry berated himself in shame for losing his temper, a hand rubbed his shoulder.
Understanding finally dawned upon Malfoy’s expression. “Of course…” He sat back down on his throne like his knees had lost the strength to carry his weight. “Of course that led to a succession crisis. His heir isn't exactly…”
“Oh,” the blonde woman who was halfway to the door tilted her head in that characteristically absent-minded way of hers. “Of course, Your Majesty,” she responded in her lilting, lyrical voice. The tall dark-haired young man trailed behind her.
“The most beautiful Cor Lapis and Noctilucous Jade I’ve seen, right? No worries, I’ll bring them to you by tomorrow,” Zabini responded timely like clockwork, his mind in tune with his former classmates’. “If you’ll excuse me,” he departed from the hall then, headed for the closest apparition point it seems.
“What do you think about James Fred-” Ginny tried to reopen the topic on potential names for their child, but Harry interrupted her by grabbing her hand.
“I’ve prepared the necessary gifts,” Viscount Nott snapped to attention. A House Elf popped into existence next to him, carrying an open chest with glass bottles of clear liquids and a well-shaped turquoise vase inside it. “I have procured the Silk Flower Three Poignant Perfumes from Scent of Spring shop in Han, as well as the most beautiful Glaze Lily imprinted porcelain I’ve seen.” He handed the chest over to Malfoy for his inspection.
Thankfully, the urge seemed to have passed quickly. “Do tell, Blaise,” Malfoy continued as he fidgeted to a more comfortable position, that straight-backed posture discarded.
The atmosphere of the dinner changed. There was some tension in the air. Harry was threading through the conversations more carefully than he’d ever been, always keeping Fleur’s expression in view. Whenever the blonde woman started to frown, Harry was quick to change the topic.
Ginny’s eyes turned glossy with tears, too, but Harry’s thoughts and emotions still didn’t come across. “The deaths are their fault, Harry! All the more we shouldn’t forgiv-”
“...I see,” judging from the dumbfounded expression on his wife’s face, this must not have been common knowledge.
“It’s an honour to receive you in my home, Your Majesty.” Harry noticed Zhongli’s eyes straying to the lily brooch on his lapels when the monarch introduced himself, and those amber eyes turned soft.
For some reasons, Harry’s cheeks felt warm. He didn’t know why; it wasn’t the first time Malfoy made some modifications to Harry’s outfit. Whenever they had to attend an event hosted by conservative purebloods or foreigners with strong pureblood culture, Harry always had Malfoy check the appropriateness of what he wore.
Regardless, the outcome favoured Harry. “I echo Draco’s sentiment, Lord Zabini. We’re happy to have you here,” he raised his glass for an informal toast.
Malfoy did not even spare the ring two seconds of his attention. He immediately curtsied, the shimmery midnight blue of his long robes gathered in pale milky hands. Harry’s eyes fixated on the top of his head as Malfoy replied, “Thank you, Your Majesty. I hope I can meet your expectations.”
In turn, Harry took the sight in slowly, happy to note that the gaunt cheeks and black splotches were gone from the young man’s pale skin. It seemed he had recovered from the war… at least physically.
Harry fought the blush that was threatening to invade his cheeks at being caught trying to eavesdrop. “Yes, I must have,” he mumbled.
“It wasn’t mentioned,” Hermione shrugged. “This sometimes happens in pureblood Houses. I’m not sure why.”
” Li kissed Malfoy’s temple as he caressed the other man’s platinum blonde hair. His touch was so tender. “I told you I don’t believe that it skipped you. I have faith-”
Of course, Daphne and Astoria had been transferred to Beauxbaton during the very early stages of the war, when the Order was still only engaging in guerilla attacks. Like Theodore Nott, they never returned to Petra, so Harry couldn't exactly pop in for a visit to meet them. So he sent an official letter to Lord and Lady Greengrass, requesting for their daughter’s hand.
But there was something about the man’s aura that reminded Harry of Dumbledore. It was timeless… and there was also a tiredness to him, something that had seeped into the bones and weighted down his posture.
The golden light of the sunset streamed into the room, illuminating them. The smile on Zhongli’s face looked so precious it could stop someone’s heart. “It’s been a while since I enjoyed myself like this.”
The Malfoy he remembered from school had a huge sweet tooth. Harry thought he saw scones, muffins, or croissants with jam on the blonde’s breakfast plate often in Hogwarts; sometimes even pancakes, drenched in golden, syrupy honey. Not to mention, the care packages Narcissa Malfoy sent were notoriously famous for being filled to the brim with chocolates, and only about half were shared with Crabbe and Goyle.
The meeting didn’t go that badly. In fact, Harry managed to accomplish most of the things that he wanted to.
Zabini grinned rakishly, his eyes glimmering with amusement. The Ladies stopped what they were doing for a moment and just stared. The only son of Mrs Zabini was really good looking - his jaw, his nose, his cheekbones, his brows, those lips - they were perfect. He was as chiseled as a statue.  Even Hermione was staring, before she cleared her throat and looked down, cheeks turning pink. The sound of a glass being knocked came from Harry’s right.
A group of people were standing in front of the Castle, the gold of some of their robes reflecting the sunlight. A woman stood in front of them, dark hair coiffed in a bun at her nape, her robe seemingly the most golden of them all, the layers of the oriental dress beneath them a muted black. What seemed like white foxes with red-tipped tails were embroidered on the hems. She bowed deeply from the waist, and the entire congregation behind her followed, like a perfectly choreographed performance.
“Little dragon, please!” Big, tanned hands cupped Malfoy’s pale and pointed face and held it close, foreheads pressing against one another. Tears were also streaming down Li’s face. “I’m sorry I have to protect the interest of my House.

On one hand, he wanted to see the light at the end of the tunnel. To not feel the tension of quiet resentment and hostilities between the two factions anymore. On the other hand, the idea of marrying any of the Slytherin wizards they had identified was not appealing to him.
“You can’t,” The brilliant witch smiled wryly and shrugged, “Come, Harry, we have a war council meeting to attend.”
Harry put aside his papers with an inward sigh. There was no stopping his wife once she’d set her mind to have sex with him. Not that he was particularly opposed. Ginny had been strangely horny quite often recently. Once she had settled on top of him, he answered her question. “Pansy Parkinson.”
Count Slughorn, whose assistance had been requested in the endeavor, endorsed Shacklebolt’s choice readily.
Harry tensed when a gloved hand moved to Malfoy’s face, but Tartaglia was only patting Malfoy's head. “You’re as smart as they say.”
Harry frowned. There were so many things he wanted to ask. “Lady Ningguang inherited the title even though she had older siblings? Was Lady Guizhong… ill?”
“…Li Syaoran,” Shiroharu finished, as the Head Boy crossed the distance between the two student bodies like he had fire on his heels and threw his arms around Malfoy. “Well, I’m glad some of you know each other already.”
1) Something like this? https://www.shinyjunglejewellery.com/listing/620184760/watermelon-tourmaline-ring-bi-color
Malfoy blinked profusely, but the effort was futile. The sobs quickly turned to waterfall. He curled into himself. “T-thank you. I-I si-simply c-can’t th-thank you enough-”
Malfoy’s grey eyes flickered as they met Harry’s. Perhaps, Malfoy was still not used to seeing Harry with black hair and having such a square face. Harry had looked a little different when he was in disguise in Hogwarts.
Harry wanted to snarl. Something simmered under his skin when he spied Malfoy and Li sharing worried looks, again communicating without words. Before Harry entered the drawing room, he had been very reluctant to invoke the Life Debt, preferring to wait for a response from Nott. Harry didn’t understand where all these came from… He didn’t still have any remnants of horcruxes in him, did he?
“Lord Tartaglia,” Malfoy greeted the newcomer from his feet, one hand cradling his stomach protectively. His stance was wary, despite the way he kept straightening himself to hide his nervousness.
“Viscount Nott,” Malfoy interrupted, his voice colder than Harry anticipated. “You seem to be very confident that I even want you as my aide in the future.”
The green-eyed wizard turned to his best friend. At first, she looked equally lost, but as Malfoy went on, understanding began to dawn on her.
“Little Wolf,” Malfoy replied the boy, his face less shocked than the Asian boy’s but grimmer, his grey eyes haunted.
The man standing at the door frame was tall and gangly. He had orange hair and blue eyes. At one glance, he did not look all that different from a Weasley - like Bill, or Charlie, maybe - but once Harry looked closer, he realised the man’s blue eyes were darker, and they hid monstrous darkness within. Not unlike the stormy seas, where Hydra and Kraken lurked. All of Harry’s senses were working overtime.
The peaceful afternoon was interrupted when a messenger barged into the Castle apartment Harry had designated permanently for his godson’s family. The messenger looked harried.
Malfoy smiled as he deftly brought the thin slices of bamboo shoots to his mouth with his chopsticks (unlike Harry, who had to ask for a fork and a knife). He looked like things had gone according to his plans.
All the tension leaving his body, Malfoy appeared to have lost the strength to remain on his feet. He dropped to his chair, his breathing laboured. As the blonde clutched his chest, he forced out through his lips. “Thank you, Lord Tartaglia.”
Li looked alarmed, while Malfoy took a sharp breath. Malfoy’s expression changed, like he had seen Harry in a different light. For once, the blonde’s mind was clear for Harry to read, even without any legilimency whatsoever. ‘
[1] ‘Petra’ and ‘Kasha’ are from the manga ‘The Biography of Queen Bertha’. It’s an interesting manga about a royal family reigning over a divided kingdom - the reigning Aryan foreign invaders and the natives. There are also some blood supremacy issues. I have thought of this fanfic’s plot line LONG ago but reading the manga made me want to write this.
“I’m sure you know, Lord Li,” Harry interrupted, flaunting that he feared no threat of war from the Han Kingdom, although deep in his heart, he truly didn’t want another war. Malfoy and Li didn’t know it was a bluff, though. “That the Life Debt gives no leeway with respect to such provisions. If Draco Malfoy is to refuse, you will be married to a dead fiance.”
[1] Because Harry was kinda in hiding when he attended Hogwarts, he used the name Harry Dursley. Harry wasn’t famous like in canon, but he still developed a rivalry against Draco for being an opposing Seeker his age.
“Can we leave Malfoy’s and Nott’s letters to you, Harry?” Hermione stretched as she got up. “It’s great that we had a productive meeting today!”
“I can still be your fiance while I’m carrying the child, Your Majesty. The pureblood faction will understand the importance of properly ending a betrothal, while still maintaining good relationships between the Houses.”
Malfoy’s owl was considerably more difficult to write. Harry mulled over it for days, words forming and disintegrating in the back of his mind even as he attended morning assemblies and meetings with his subjects on various national issues…
Malfoy’s fists retreated under the wide brim of his sleeves. Harry suspected the blonde was clenching them tightly out of view. “Yes, Your Majesty,” his reply was calm and even. “Han’s temperate climate has always suited Mother better.”
Although, it was clear from the moment he stepped down from the carriage and gave the Thestral which pulled his carriage a pat on his snout, why McGonagall arranged to have them board and attend lessons at Mahoutokoro for a while. The restoration of Hogwarts was far from complete. Towers and whole chunks of the Castle still remained in various state of disrepair, utterly inhabitable. Even from this far away, Harry could sense some kind of…wrongness. Dark magic and hatred and remnants of whatever energy leaked out of curses having seeped into the ground. What McGonagall had achieved over the summer was already amazing.
“Harry?” Hermione touched his arm, snapping Harry off from the memory of his Godfather falling through the curtain, never to come back, repeating like in a loop. He looked around, and realised that he was nearly alone. His other schoolmates had passed through. Luna was waiting ahead of them, and Malfoy was standing by the door, one hand on the frame. Harry noted an odd set of tension in his back, before he too, disappeared in the mist.
Harry began to fret. He’d expected that the blonde would spew indignities and insult him like Lady Parkinson did, but the reply was just as short and cold as Harry’s owl. If anything, the blonde sounded… resigned. Like Harry was going to bid for his life.
‘Mind what?’ Harry wanted to ask, but Malfoy didn’t wait for an answer in the first place. Harry felt the blonde’s deft fingers pinning something onto his collar, near his breast pocket.
Other than Malfoy and Nott, the committee also identified other eligible pureblood bachelors such as Marcus Flint, Terrence Higgs and Adrian Pucey. Slughorn strongly stressed that the Sacred Twenty-Eight was his preference, however. Specifically, Malfoy, to Harry’s chagrin.
The next morning saw Harry walking toward Malfoy’s quarters, pushing a trolley overflowing with food.
The King wrapped his fingers around his wand in his pocket, and Tartaglia snapped his head at Harry with a hiss, his teeth bared. The air around him was highly charged with magic, so dense with it that blue sparkles were starting to form-
“Right,” the Japanese witch turned to address them. “Welcome to Mahoutokoro School of Magic. I am Shiroharu Yura, the Headmistress of this School. You may call me Professor Shiroharu, Shiroharu-kyoju, or Shiroharu-sensei. We are very pleased to have you here.”
Malfoy shot up to his feet. He looked positively broken from the betrayal. “I knew it,” his voice was breathy as he forced his words between his sobs and heavy breathing. “There is no way the Most Noble and Ancient House Li and the great Marchioness Yelan wanted to accept my tarnished family with open arms! Since the beginning, you have only been eyeing for my blood, the blessings of the stars running through House Bl-”
To minimise travelling by portkey for Malfoy, it had been decided that he would ride a carriage back home. Flown by thestrals, it would take less than a day’s travel. Harry only planned to accompany him till they passed the nearest mansion of a noble from the liberal faction, who could lend him their floo without raising an eyebrow at the fact that Malfoy and he were travelling separately.
,” the brown-haired boy interrupted her with a whisper, his brown eyes widening until a ring of white could be seen around his irises. A few Mahoutokoro students shot him disbelieving dark looks – it seemed they truly upheld politeness in high regards – but the Head Boy didn’t seem to notice. No, he only had eyes for-
“We must meet again!” Hermione looked at the older man with bright eyes. She looked like she was on the verge of just grabbing his hands. “How about I invite you to my house for tea?”
The King gave his wife a wan smile before he addressed the rest of the Order of the Phoenix. “Please leave.”
“I wasn’t lying, Gin. I don’t want to if we can avoid it.” Harry turned his pleading gaze to his wife. It was far too public to be having this argument in front of their courtiers, regardless of the fact that only members of the Order of the Phoenix were in the room.
Harry longed to press his fingers against his temple. But he still had an audience. “I hear you,” the monarch settled with that response. “Thank you, Horace. Your opinion is valuable.”
“Childe,” Zhongli’s face transformed at the sight of the newcomer. He cheered up, all previous melancholy gone. “I’ve saved them for you, of course. Xiao!”
came clean to Harry about their intention to make him King all along, Harry knew that it wasn’t going to be an easy journey. Harry knew, but…
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “Do we even know whether he’s…” His cheeks turned red from embarrassment. “Whether he… likes...men?”
Slughorn looked reluctant too. “Young mister Nott is certainly clever, but he has always preferred to be solitary. I do not think he has the social abilities to represent the pureblood faction… and I frankly think the boy will be happier not to.” He rubbed his temple, “And please do not suggest Gregory Goyle. Just… don’t.”
Harry groaned and covered his face with his palm. “How many times must I tell you that I was only suspicious that he was plotting something! I was right, wasn’t I?” The fight fled from Harry when he remembered that the chain of events leading to Dumbledore’s death. He slumped like an unbearable weight was unloaded on his shoulders.
Harry’s eyebrows rose to his hairline. There were still… 1 hour to morning assembly. Just how early did the blonde’s days start?
A House Elf appeared in the drawing room, wrinkled and stooping. Harry suspected she wasn’t that much younger than Kreacher. “Master call Lizzy?”
Stepping through the threshold felt very much like the familiar sensation of being forced through a very tight rubber tube. Harry landed shakily on his feet on the other side, his face slightly green with nausea.
Neville hesitated, before he ploughed through, “It is slightly concerning that some of the Sacred Twenty-Eight Houses which were not deeply involved with the former King… chose not to return to the court. Like Houses Slughorn, Greengrass or Nott… They are just Counts, well liked by the residents of their fiefs...”
Young Nott looked relieved to be having Malfoy’s attention. “Of course, the suburbs of the city with the best climate in Petra… Mesaro.”
she looked, gave a dismissive gesture. “Ilvermorny would have been more ideal; they also have four houses, and less cultural distance.”
“Oh, Harry…” the green-eyed boy didn’t need to look up to know what kind of expression his best friend of seven years was sporting. Slender arms wrapped around his shoulder, and soon enough his face was buried in locks of bushy brown hair. “The people will still be the same… isn’t it a good way to gradually move on?”
Malfoy exhaled slowly, not in a hurry to talk. The conservative purebloods faction was always saying that the liberals were too direct.
Harry and Hermione were looking around with wide eyes. Luna looked absently fascinated, as she always did. Malfoy, Zabini and Theodore Nott were expressionless.
“I barely slept at all,” Hermione’s cheerful tone was at odds with her words. “There is just so much to read about Snezhnaya, I could only skim the surface-.”
For the first eleven years of his life, Harold “Harry” Dursley was an orphan raised in a small village in Surrey.
Hermione exchanged a glance with the King. The witch pursed her lips. She seemed torn. “I’d like to stay...”
“You wouldn’t even have the chance to brag about your oh-so-precious stones without my intel-” Theodore Nott stopped trying to hide his anger.
Harry smiled wryly in his mind. Everything was a calculate move for Professor Slughorn, his former Potion teacher for a brief period in Hogwarts. Harry didn’t believe Slughorn made a genuine mistake when he was addressing Harry.
“I am very thankful for the high-quality gifts you prepared, of course… and your presence in the court,” sounds of furniture scraping against the floor and fabric swishing could be heard, followed by high-pitched clinking of metal and porcelain. The familiar aroma of earl grey wafted out of the room.
Cold fury was ablaze in his grey eyes, his gaze so frosty it seemed if he could cause Nott’s limbs to drop off from frostbite with a look, he would.
“Maybe it's never been done in the Kingdom of Petra [1],” Lord Flitwick calmly interjected from his perch across the round table. “But I heard in Oriental Kingdoms, having several Consorts is the norm.”
.” Out of his wand erupted a lithe, prancing figure. A reindeer, was it? Harry didn’t have a chance to tell because it was gone in a flash, but that didn’t make it any less real. Remus’s eyes were shiny and his smile was watery.
When Draco had stopped seething, they loosened their grip and just held onto his forearms firmly. They were escorting him to McGonagall’s office, it seemed, and when they finally sat him down on her office settee, McGonagall looked as though she’d aged about ten more years.
His eyes were filled with too much admiration to say no. “Okay.” He focused his attention on the specific memory of the light in Harry’s eyes when he realised that he didn’t have to accept death so soon, mainly on the colour. The bright, emerald green that Draco now realised he probably wouldn’t be able to live without. Feeling suddenly light and powerful, he cast the spell, and from his wand emerged a silver creature, with elegant limbs and a graceful canter, that danced around him before swiftly leaving.
“See you at the bottom!” said Harry, as he gave him a push. He then waited a few seconds for his teacher to reach the bottom, although he didn’t know exactly where that would be, and allowed himself to slide down too, for that was what it really was, a slide. A strange, dark and murky slide, but a slide all the same. He could just make out the murky walls and other paths branching out in different directions. He didn’t have much time to wonder if the landing would be painful, as the tube levelled out and he was spouted out the bottom on a grimy floor.
Remus looked towards the two innocent, kind boys sitting together on the sofa in each other’s comforting embrace and sighed.
“Well the actual box cost me nothing.” said Draco offhandedly “Another amazing find from Grimmauld Place. I only had to pay for the engravings. See, if you look closeley.” He pointed at the shiny clasp on the side which said:
“Dumbledore, I don’t think that’s a good idea! Everyone knows about it, I don’t think it will ease the parent’s minds.” Remus sighed. Sirius really did feel sorry for him, he really did love teaching and it would make keeping an eye on Draco and Harry a lot easier.
“I will never be like you.” Draco screamed, throat raw from holding back tears, which now flooded free. “Ever.”
Dumbledore insisted that no one should know about Harry’s powers until he had them under control. He believed that if the public knew there were two children of prophecy living in the world, one being the son of a Death Eater and the other being The Boy Who Lived, there would be public outrage.
Harry blushed. “Yeah. It’s Muggle. I just thought that you might want to add some more photos onto your wall.” He was now staring at his knees, uncomfortable.
“I’ll go over there, dad.” said Draco quietly. Sirius nodded and stayed in his spot, watching the interaction closely.
“Do you know how much I love you, kid? I don’t think I say it enough.” Draco watched as his breath made patterns in the air.
“Well, I just sent a letter to the Lupin-Blacks to check in, so we’ll see.” McGonagall started arranging her knives and forks in a specific pattern. “Harry, I am sure that Draco has told you why his father was arrested.” Harry nodded. “Well, a few years ago, some Aurors discovered that, along with association with You-Know-You, and probably under his orders, Lucius Malfoy murdered three muggles and a witch while they were in their house.”
Briefly, Harry wondered what the worst case scenario here was. Surely nothing much could happen from a simple healing charm. How wrong he was. Slowly, the strangest, most unpleasant sensation was spreading up Harry’s arm, or at least what used to feel like Harry’s arm, for it didn’t feel like an arm at all anymore. Draco shrieked.
Which was true, but Harry hated watching Draco wince every morning as he saw the birds land on the window. He was pretending it didn’t bother him but it clearly did.
Silently, the boys slipped on their shoes and started swiftly walking down the hall, hand in hand. Since they left the Chamber, no more than three words had been spoken between them, by silent agreement, but they held each other tight and close, not allowing the other to go anywhere without them, except to the toilet every now and then.
“Before we get started, I would like to ask you some questions, Harry Potter.” Tom sauntered forward, eyeing Harry like prey, but never getting close enough to touch. “Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk, the longer you and your little friend will survive.”
“Maybe he’s worried you’ll kill him, Draco.” suggested Blaise, which earned him a kick in the side. “
“You’re in the Hospital Wing.” All of a sudden, Draco rushed towards him in a blur of blonde and hugged him tightly around the neck, he embraced it and hugged back to the best of his ability.
“You don’t have to buy me anything! I think I’ve got enough!” Harry grinned at the prospect of Wizard Sweets and scanned the assortment with Draco who carried a handful of chocolate frogs and one pumpkin pasty, Harry chose one of each of the sweets on display and they both sat down and began devouring their selections. At Harry’s questioning, Draco explained every sweet Harry had picked up.
The greaseball plucked the map from Harry’s stunned hands and examined it with suspicion. “May I ask why you are wandering the halls at night? When you are supposed to be in bed?”
.” the boy said, pointing up to the sky. Harry hadn’t seen it before, so followed his hand. There it was, glittering and beautiful, just like the human named after it. Draco moved his hand to point at a different section of the sky. “And that one’s
“Horace, do I look stupid to you?” Harry let some of his temper and magical powers show. He’d been told that he was so powerful, his magic shimmered around him like hot steam when he was truly angry. The King wasn’t really angry now, but it was a useful intimidation tool. “Are you secretly one of those people who lament the end of the Ravenclaw’s and Hufflepuff’s lines?”
“We are presented with enchanted robes upon enrollment. The robes will change in size according to the wearer and change colour as the learning of the wearer increases, beginning a faint pink colour and becoming gold if top grades are achieved in every magical subject,” [4] the Head Girl elaborated patiently.
The pureblood wizard was not the kind to make such a simple mistake, but this wasn’t really the first time Harry heard others address the blonde as such. Harry let them go unpunished, because there was no point in disturbing the sense of ‘it was only a matter of time’ that was perpetuating amongst his subjects.
“...I noticed there were no spicy dishes,” Nott spoke. Malfoy looked alarmed. “I heard you like them. If you don’t mind, may I please give you these?” He opened a box of red peppers which flared out at the bottom like flower petals.
“It’s fine. We know that you didn’t mean to harm us,” Francis’ reply was warm, but Harry could sense that the gazes of his courtiers turned more judgmental.
Harry knew the blonde would be enjoying his tea with a lot of cream. It was the way he always took his tea.
“Yes, but…” Harry didn’t expect Malfoy would willingly brave an encounter with the former Eleventh Harbinger of the Fatui, a soldier infamous for his hitcount, just for the sake of ‘his job’. Being in the presence of Tartaglia’s murderous intention was akin to having sharp blades pressed to the skin of one’s neck. The man was as volatile as an unstable Blasting curse.
A huge door, almost as big as the door leading to the Entrance Hall, had been installed next to the gate. It was made of stone instead of wood, and instead of the emblems of the four houses carved onto the surface, it was filled by runes and what Harry assumed to be the Japanese writing system, along with images of waves, the sun, clouds and a castle with curling roofs, a snake with a dragon’s head hovering protectively around it.
Harry blanched. “To visit this... former Great-uncle-in-law of yours?” He asked incredulously. Ginny was so close to giving birth; he didn’t want to be away from
Harry followed her lead, but after all the Lumos charms were extinguished, sleep evaded him for a long time.
“Gin,” he lifted his blankets and beckoned her closer. These days, the nights were unusually cold, too cold for such outfits. True enough, Harry could see the outline of her nipples against the fabric, stiff from the chilly air.
Harry peered at Malfoy discreetly, worried that she was being too forward, but the blonde only looked on with approval.
“Pasting a glaze lily to wet glaze before it was fired in the kiln? Fascinating. The flower turned to ash, but its shape is forever retained. Such genius…”
Harry let the older wizard ramble. “It’s not that I believe in pureblood superiority - I’ve had many muggle-borns and half bloods in my Slug Club, you know this, Your Majesty - it’s just… this old wizard is used to certain… lifestyle and practices… and it’s hard to change…”
