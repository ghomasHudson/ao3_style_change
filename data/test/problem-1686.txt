“Hey, Draco?” Harry asked, walking back into the kitchen area. “Wow, it looks great in here. I’ve been coming to Charlie’s for years, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen it like this.”
“Really?” Harry bit back a smile as he started on the washing up. Not that he didn’t agree, but hearing it coming from Draco of all people…
“Harry, tomorrow… Well, tomorrow everything’s going to change, and…” He closed his eyes, unable to look at Harry if he ever wanted to get this out. “And I want you to know that I really consider you a good friend, as unlikely as that seems.”
“I’m trying, you know. I’m trying to make better choices, to make the wizarding world a better place than what it’s been, but I’m really just still me — short-tempered, privileged, sarcastic. I even yelled at Hannah Abbott, for Salazar’s sake. Who the hell yells at a Hufflepuff?”
“I want you all to know that I will truly cherish the time I spent with you, and even though it was only for a short time, you’ll always be in my heart.” A tear finally fell down his cheek. “I’m really sorry,” he added, and his voice was rough and quiet.
He’d never thought of it quite like that. He’d always been too focused on the running-away-with-the-tail-between-his-legs part of it. And here Harry was — noble, honourable Harry — as always, seeing the good and positive in everyone around him. Even Draco. Even though Draco had never done anything to deserve his kindness.
He moved to undo the buttons before pulling Draco's trousers and pants down in one swift move, then sat on the bed to kick off his shoes. Draco groaned when Harry leant back, shimmying out of the rest of his clothes before scooting back on the bed, meeting Draco's heated gaze.
“I-I have to go,” Harry said abruptly and turned before stalking to the door. He paused with his hand on the doorknob. “I’m sure you and Charlie will be very happy.”
our friends to not go running to the Prophet if they knew, just, I don’t know, I guess I just like the idea of having
Draco wanted to do what he was told, but it felt wrong; he wasn’t anyone whose voice would comfort Charlie. He wasn’t family. Hannah seemed to misunderstand, though, and shooed him forwards. “It’ll do you both some good, I reckon.”
Draco’s eyes widen at the implication and Harry smiles, ignoring his racing heart. “You deserve more too, you know,” he continues, recalling Draco’s words; his rambling apology. “You’re trying to make amends, to be more than what your father raised you to be. I feel like I already know you from the dreams, but I want to know you for real too, Draco. The real you. I want to know you, and remember.”
Only one problem, though. Denim. The sturdy fabric meeting him at the small of Harry’s back reminded Draco of the man’s current state of non-undress. Before he’d even made a conscious decision, Draco had rolled them over, surprising Harry enough that he broke their kiss to stare up at Draco, dark eyes wide and chest heaving.
have, he had reckoned it being sort of a given. However, between the ridiculously thorough prep and the excessive amount of lube Draco had slicked himself up with, Draco sunk into him as naturally as if he’d always belonged; as if he was always meant to be inside Harry’s body; as if he was the missing piece Harry had been lacking all along.
“I had planned to come in earlier, but the shop has been awfully busy all day,” Madam Malkin said as she waited for Draco to retrieve her change from the cash register. (This part had taken far longer to get used to than Draco had anticipated; the twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, seventeen Sickles to a Galleon just didn’t make sense anymore. Not to mention, why did these magic folk still rely on cash —
Narcissa got away pretty much the same way you did, actually. She risked her life to save mine, and once the Wizengamot found out about that, they seemed to calm down enough to take that into account before they reached their verdict. I never told them she only did it out of fear of losing you in the battle, but maybe it would comfort you to know that. She does love you, you know, more than anything.
Harry’s mouth twitched at the corner. “That’s what they all thought. But then, they didn’t factor in your brilliant brain.”
Draco felt sick as he laid eyes on the limp body in Hagrid’s arms. He looked so small lying against the half-giant’s door-sized frame, so vulnerable with his head thrown back over one thigh-thick forearm, his throat bared for anyone to slash like a sacrificial lamb. So utterly defenceless.
Harry shrugged. "He'll learn eventually. Anyway, I was just thinking how nice this all is. How peaceful."
“And that’s just the average. Some years it’s more. Sometimes they use wands passed down from family members, and sometimes their parents have to try to find other economical ways of obtaining them. For students with non-magical families, we’ve even found people selling them fraudulent wands. The student and parents don’t know how to tell the difference.”
The thoughts had swirled around in his mind the entire night and most of the morning. He’d found himself staring at the shower wall for Merlin-knew-how-long or chewing a bite of his breakfast until there was nothing left to chew, his mind unable to focus on what he was readying himself for.
“Uh, no. I’m doing my homework. Something you’re usually nagging me to do.” He raised an eyebrow, waiting on her retort.
The sound of running water reaches him from the bathroom and Harry fights the images popping up in his head without his consent. A wet, naked Draco is the last thing he needs to occupy his mind right now. If his gut isn’t totally out of tune, Draco is in need of a friend tonight, not a horny pervert.
“No, it is. I’ve not helped friends who I knew needed it, simply because I couldn’t be bothered. And I’ve ignored many of the values I was raised with because they weren’t convenient.”
look the part. Every last inch of him. Not that Harry had met too many Santas throughout his life — the Dursleys had seen to that — but Draco was the spitting image of how he’d always pictured jolly old St Nick. A cute blonde toddler was sitting on his lap, giggling at something he’d just said, and Harry had to remind himself how to breathe.
Draco reluctantly let go of Harry’s cock and kissed his way up Harry’s happy trail, pausing at the navel, dipping his tongue inside before continuing, up across smooth bronze skin, following the hills and valleys of his well-defined muscles until he reached a pebbled, cocoa-coloured nipple too tempting to ignore. The involuntary noises coming from Harry’s mouth provided the perfect soundtrack as Draco flicked it teasingly with the tip of his tongue while simultaneously circling the other with the pad of his thumb.
Harry testified on Malfoy’s behalf, and as he did, he noticed confusion swirling in those eyes. Confusion, and a slight glimmer of hope breaking through the stormy grey. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to satisfy his conscience that he’d done the right thing, and he left the other boy in the courtroom, ready to go on and live his life.
“Draco, I—” was all he managed to get out before Draco pressed their lips together, silencing Harry with a searing kiss.
Smaug, sensing Draco’s distress, pawed at his shirt and tucked his head into the crook of Draco’s arm, purring. Grateful for the support, Draco did his best to relax. “Sirius says—”
I should’ve guessed you wanted to go into potions. With the way Snape always made it sound like you were some fucking wonderchild, of course a praise-hungry prick like you would suck it up like a dry sponge and take it as a sign you were destined for brewing. I do get your concerns, though, most people aren’t as tolerant and forgiving as they’d have you believe. But if you decide potions is what you want to do, I’m sure
Draco choked and quickly turned it into a little cough. “Yes, well, opposites attract and all that.”
Draco doubted it’d be as easy as Sirius professed, but he didn’t have it in him to argue the point any further. At least for the time being. “So now what?”
"Merlin, Harry, you're incorrigible. Now, I'm here, and there's not a book or study sheet in sight. What did you have planned?"
Her hug was so tight, and Draco had no idea how she had enough energy to hug him like this after that long monologue without a single breath. But the hug…
If any of their friends had any initial reservations about them living together, their worries had been unnecessary, if not unjustified. They used to hate each other, after all, but people change. They’ve both grown up, moved on from their black-or-white outlook on life and learnt to appreciate the broad spectrum of colours in between. Just like the world around them, they’ve reached a new level of tolerance and respect, a sentiment shared with most witches and wizards within the British magical community today.
“That’s not what I…” Harry stopped himself from finishing the sentence. Whiny and petulant was not how he wished for Draco to remember him while away in France over the holidays. “Of course not. According to ‘Dromeda, he’s not been able to talk about anything else the entire week.”
And it certainly didn’t bother him to think about Harry and Charlie in some past relationship. Or if it did, it was only because of his crush on Charlie.
Hannah looked up from her charts and smiled. “He’s healing, but no major changes. How are you holding up?” She looked around, making sure they were alone. “Have you told them yet?”
And I can’t help it, I burst into a laugh that has me doubled over in tears within moments. “Y-you’re insane,” I wheeze as soon as I’m able to breathe again. “You’re insane and adorable and…” I straighten up and look at him across the table. “I love you so much.”
He’d imagined it so often, fantasised about what it would be like, and yet… reality was nothing like the visions his mind had ever been able to conjure up. Not only because Draco currently sported a beard that tickled Harry’s chin and a pouting belly that prevented their chests from pressing against each other the way Harry wanted them to, but because it was
“I mean…” Harry croaked, stopping to clear his throat before continuing. “Yes, I’m sure I’ll manage until you get back.”
Not that I couldn’t have gotten a date if I wanted to. I could have. It’s just… Dating freaks me out, okay. I just don’t know how to be around girls. No matter how sweet or lovely they are, I always feel awkward around them and end up saying the wrong thing. Nothing you’ve ever experienced, I’m sure. You’ve always been quite popular with the girls, right? Care to tell a dating dork like me how you do it?
It went on like that, two fingers, three, four, interlaced with Draco’s complementing words, spoken in his deep, soothing baritone. Harry lost track of time, lost track of everything except Draco’s touch, Draco’s voice, Draco’s scent. At one point, Draco leaned in behind him, bracing himself on his elbow to kiss Harry’s shoulder. As he did, Harry felt Draco’s rock-hard cock prod his thigh and smear pre-come over his skin.
Draco opened his mouth to argue, then closed it when he realised he had no retort. Smaug jumped up onto his lap and licked his cheek, making him smile.
. And the man nodded as he lowered his hand again, “But…” It didn’t make sense. “Y-you’re supposed to be my age?”
When Draco glanced over this time, the bloke was already composing his next message, seemingly unaware of his friend shaking her head fondly at him before returning her focus to her revision notes.
Draco dropped down into the chair, staring at the snowglobe in his hands and then the door, in turns.
So I make an effort to stay positive whenever they’re around, which works fine, I guess, as long as it’s not for hours on end. Sometimes when I’m with them, I even fool myself into believing my life really is as good as I claim it to be. But they don’t know how listless I feel once I’m back in my empty house. They don’t know about how I’m constantly questioning every part of my life, or the total lack of enthusiasm I feel for my chosen auror career.
Ginny had mentioned it the other day; that her brother was coming up from Romania to substitute for Hagrid whilst he was in France visiting Madame Maxime over the holidays. This was the first Harry’d seen of him, though, and before he knew it, he was already running over to meet him, chatting and laughing amicably like they’d done all summer.
Once he was back at school, the dreams became more frequent and, if possible, grew even more intense. Now, each time he woke, the scent of something sweet lingered in his memory. Vanilla, maybe? Or toffee?
The conversation veered again, this time revolving around Quidditch, Celestina Warbeck, and quiche. Draco let it all roll over him like waves on a beach, the tips of each conversation tickling his toes as they crashed over him.
Harry laughed and gently pushed Draco away, stepping over to the table and pulling out a seat. "Best get started then."
So, care to tell me when you suddenly decided to become such a blooody romantic? Because I sure as hell can’t remember ever seeing any signs of you being one before? In all the years
“So…” Draco hesitates, distracted, his gaze straying to Harry’s damp chest before shooting up to meet Harry’s eyes again. “What do you plan on wearing?”
Harry glanced over and smiled, and his face lit up in a way that made Draco’s heart swell. “I was on a business trip to the states. I visited this old museum where people were in old-fashioned costumes and did all these traditional trades: pottery, blacksmithing, glassblowing. It was all really interesting, but the glassblowing was what really caught my attention. They were offering a seminar the next day, so I cleared my schedule and went.”
“I hate him,” Draco spat, gripping the sink with both hands as he stared himself in the eye. He stood like that for several long, defiant moments before he capitulated to his fatigue, letting his head fall forward as a fresh bout of tears threatened to burst forth. He wasn’t strong. He wasn’t resilient. He was a weak fucking coward, a worthless failure who didn’t seem able to stop crying.
“Yes, you are. And you deserve to be happy, Harry. You, if anyone, deserve someone who can make you happy. How are you ever supposed to find someone like that if you don’t get out there and—”
,” Harry groans and thrusts back, closing his eyes and letting his head fall back as he blindly grabs Draco’s shoulders for leverage. Draco apparently takes Harry’s bared throat as an invitation because his mouth latches onto his neck with fervour, sucking, biting, licking his way over Harry’s skin with the hunger of a starving man. His pleased humming and the wet sounds of his sloppy kisses join Harry’s panting breaths, filling the silence with the most erotic soundtrack Harry’s ever heard.
“What do you want?” A breathless whisper, a wet tongue flicking his earlobe before it got sucked in between soft lips and stinging teeth.
His eye caught on Charlie Weasley’s little hut and the two rocking chairs on the small, covered porch that welcomed friendly visitors. Not that Draco had ever been invited to use them. For all of his pining for the man, Charlie barely knew Draco existed. He’d smile at him when they crossed paths, and Draco was sure the other man knew he was a Malfoy — it’d be hard not to — but it was always the same. A friendly smile and a nod on Charlie’s end, and an evening of ginger-flavoured dreams awaiting Draco once he got home to his flat.
I think we can both agree on all the classrooms we shared throughout the years, the Great Hall, and the quidditch pitch, of course. The library, the hospital wing, and the corridor outside the Room of Requirement. (I haven’t dared try to conjure it since I came back. You know some speculate the fiendfyre might still be raging in there?) I still can’t help smiling every time I cross the courtyard where you were once turned into a furry little ferret, and I still roll my eyes every time I walk past the paddock where you insulted
However, he does recognise Draco’s questions for the verbal landmines they are, and so he answers them in the only way he can think of: with a question of his own.
Potter’s voice was dry and made Draco immediately defensive. Fighting his reaction, he took a deep breath, schooled his features, and turned. “Harry.”
Draco couldn’t help chuckling at the man’s antics as he turned to the espresso machine and started in on his over-specific coffee order. Just like that, his good mood was back, an excitement that only increased when he felt his phone vibrate in his trouser pocket. There was no time to check it right then, but he didn’t have to. He had a feeling he already knew who the text was from.
But Harry needed more. He needed Draco, needed him in ways he hadn't ever done before. He needed something new, something he was almost afraid to verbalise. Deciding to let his actions speak for him instead, he grabbed onto Draco's hips, barely giving his mate a moment to brace himself before he turned on his heel, Apparating them both to their rented cottage and the bedroom awaiting them inside.
Now, how to explain the telly… Well, it’s like the wireless but with images, I guess. Like, imagine those moving pictures you see in the papers, but in colour and not on a loop. Instead, they’re transmitted in real-time so you can watch it from your home as it happens. And, yeah, with accompanying sound. Sorry, I’ve never been particularly good at explaining these kinds of technical stuff so I don’t know how much of that made any sense to you. I guess I’d better just show you sometime instead. If you’re not opposed to the idea of watching a muggle sport, that is, because it obviously doesn’t carry quidditch.
“I’m sorry,” Harry’s soft voice came with the cold rush of air from the doorway behind him. “You’re right. I was going to say that’s not what I meant, but maybe it was. I just… I’m having a hard time reconciling what I knew of you before to who you are now.” Harry stepped closer, rounding Draco and pausing only a foot in front of him. He tilted his head to meet Draco’s gaze and stuck out his hand with a conciliatory smile.
in this heap of parchment? Honestly, Ernie, I’m only here twice a week. I can’t be expected to reorganise your office every time.”
There’s a man standing next to me, trying to attract my attention, leaning in close to my ear to make himself heard over the booming music. I couldn’t care less about him, whoever he is. Wild Thestrals couldn’t possibly make me tear my eyes away from the sight of you. Of you, moving with the beat, surrendering to the moment, thriving in the throng of undulating bodies under the multi-coloured lights.
“Well…” Draco swallowed. “When I was lying in bed that night — little more than a bundle of nerves, tossing and turning and unable to fall asleep — someone came to see me. An… unexpected, late-night visitor.”
"Harry," Draco gasped, moving to kneel above him, his wings keeping him afloat as his hands roamed over sun-kissed skin, his feather-light touches making Harry's heart sing. "Tell me what you want. Anything. I want to make you feel so good."
“Great. Well, when you get here, just come knock on the door to the office. You’ll find it on the back wall next to the Muggle games’ display.”
“Maybe…” Draco pursed his lips in thought and Harry’s eyes were helplessly drawn to them like moths to a flame. “I could probably persuade him if you…”
Harry cringed. “I’m sorry. That’s a common side effect of being seen together with me. Are you sure you’re up for that?”
Draco frowned, leaning back against the kitchen counter as Harry turned to put away the left-over tart in the fridge. They’d cleared the table together, and when Harry had started washing up, Draco had grabbed a towel and begun drying the dishes without even thinking. Standing there, working together side by side had felt so domestic, so natural. As if it was something they did every day.
His heart sped up the instant he caught sight of the messy mop of raven-black hair in the doorway. It had been twenty-four hours and seventeen minutes since The Note had first touched his skin; The Note that was currently burning a hole in the back pocket of his suddenly tighter-than-usual, black trousers. Piercing emerald eyes found his, and Draco had to look away before he made an absolute fool of himself.
“Fucking check.” Draco finally lost the last bit of temper and stopped his pacing to face her. “Dammit, Pansy,” he spat, gesturing uncharacteristically with his arms as he continued. “I told you I’ve gone through this list at least three times already. Everything is in place. We’re ready. The florist will be here on the morning of the event, the band will arrive to set up their stuff at three, and the caterers have confirmed the menu and the dietary requests. Do we honestly have to go through all this again?”
“How many times do I have to point out — to all of you,” he added with an exasperated look around the table, “that it’s not an obsession if the thing you’re worried about is actually an issue. I was
Draco looked like he was about to leave, and Harry scrambled for something to say, anything that might make him remain in the office just a few moments longer. What had they been talking about again? Ah, yes…
Nearly every conversation — and there were at least three going on at any given time — included Draco in some way. They asked his opinion or told him a story, everyone making sure he knew the backstory behind the family lore or more information about the person being discussed. It was overwhelming, and insane, and…absolutely perfect.
Charlie looked good. Someone had obviously helped him get cleaned up because his copper-red hair fell in lush waves around his face and the grime coming from days in a hospital bed was all gone. He was smiling and talking to Arthur and Bill as Draco slid in quietly behind Molly and tried to hide on the other side of the room.
I’m glad to hear Narcissa is recovering. I get if you feel like it’s going too slow, but I bet it would’ve been even worse if you hadn’t been there to care for her. I can’t say she’s given me the best impression on the few occasions our paths have met, but I must admit, reading about her in your words makes her sound more ‘human’ than I’ve ever given her credit for in the past. From what I gather, it seems her gardening fills much the same function in her life as cooking does for Molly, and with that in mind, it’s not hard for me to imagine how much being in that sunroom surrounded by her precious plants means to Narcissa. I never would’ve pegged her as the artistic type, but now you’ve got me all curious about her drawings. You make them sound rather remarkable. Please tell me there are pictures of baby you in that stack too? I bet toddler Malfoy from his adoring mother’s point of view would be a sight to behold. Do you draw too?
A challenge Malfoy seems to take literally because what follows is nothing but a constant string of dates as unpredictable as the man himself.
Draco chuckled at the joke. “Well, I mean, it’s the least she could do after trying to fry you up for dinner.”
Guilt cut at Draco’s stomach, and he withdrew his hand, the moment effectively ruined by the harsh reality of his deceit. Without another glance Harry’s way, he turned towards the hearth and threw in the Floo powder, stepping through to the Wheezes for the second round.
look like attraction, or infatuation, or…whatever the hell she thought she saw. Draco knew better, though. He’d been the target for those inquisitive eyes before.
“What’s wrong?” The slight tremble in Draco’s voice throws Harry for a loop. He sounds so insecure, so unlike the confident and sassy man Harry knows so well. Harry has no idea what to do with that fact right now. Trying to gather his thoughts and scramble them into coherent words is hard enough as it is, what with Draco’s delicious scent surrounding him like this.
“You’re not evil,” Harry hastens to say, head suddenly swimming with the mental images of the both of them together under the spray, all naked and wet and— Harry’s cock twitches in the cramped space between them, and it’s all Harry can do not to combust as Draco tightens his grip on Harry’s thigh, hissing quietly.
“I hate you,” he said again, his voice now nothing more than a weak and tired mumble against the warm skin on Potter’s neck.
Sitting up on his heels, he carefully levitated the object from under the piece of furniture, nearly dropping it to the floor as he realised what it was.
“My friends know, yes, and my mother, of course. I don’t mind if you tell your friends, but please tell them not to spread it around. I have enough to deal with without this getting out.” Harry nods; it only makes sense. Draco offers Harry his hand, and he takes it, marvelling at the strangeness of the simple act. It feels…
“Mm-hmm, dreams. Been having them for quite some time now; ever since my birthday. I just couldn’t remember them after I woke up. But they made me want more. They showed me what I was missing, and—” He moves his hand over Draco’s soft skin, sliding his palm along the length of his arm, over tense muscle and up to Draco’s shoulder. He should be freezing cold, standing half-naked and barefoot in the brisk November night, but he isn’t. He’s warm, warm and glowing, and so, so gorgeous. “—and I want that. I want you. Please.”
Harry leans in and captures Draco's mouth, running his tongue along the delicious lower lip before sucking it into his mouth. "I want you to fly us somewhere private."
I manage to stay away for all of twenty-three minutes before the mix of curiosity and concern gets the better of me. Heart pounding, I approach your closed door with caution, not sure of what I expect to find inside.
Her eyes sparkled with anger, but then suddenly, they went soft and Draco wanted to run away. “What happened with Harry?”
“Oh. Well, in that case.” He sounded so pleased that the pixies fluttering around in Draco’s stomach burst into spontaneous backflips. “Here, let me just…”
The dog cocked its head, listening in the same way Smaug usually did, and Draco let out a little laugh. “Tell you what. I’ll sit right here, and if you come over, I’ll share my sandwich with you. Maybe your family will come back looking for you.”
This is home. This is how it's supposed to be; Draco inside him, them merging their bodies, binding their souls, blending their lives. Draco is his, and he's inside him entirely, filling Harry's body like he fills his life. It feels brilliant. Perfect.
Myrtle understood him, though. Loud and whiny as she was, she listened. She cared. Which was more than could be said about most people in his life these days.
“No, I—” Harry said faintly even as he tilted his head to give the man better access to his heated skin.
They had made it home from the Burrow much later than he’d intended, and even though it was already long past Teddy’s bedtime, Harry had suggested a cup of hot chocolate in front of the fire before tucking him in. “Just because it’s Christmas,” Harry had said. “I think we ought to savour the day for as long as we possibly can.”
“Oh, fuck yes.” That was exactly what Draco had been craving, the missing ingredient to make this rich, luscious blend go from amazing to sublime. Harry’s hard length rubbing against him, his tight fist meeting their every thrust, hot and slick, chasing them both to new, dizzying heights.
Your laughter subsides and you take a sip from your champagne flute. I can’t help but watch the movement of your Adam’s apple as you swallow. The sight of it, bobbing along your throat, sends an inappropriate thrill down my spine. And then, as Nott starts in on another tale, you frown and let your silver-grey eyes scan the room.
Harry considered. He did like the way Malfoy looked these days, so much better than that day at his trial. His hair practically glowed with health now, and his skin looked so soft, so smooth that Harry itched to reach out and touch it, just to find out if it felt as perfect as it looked. And the one or two times they’d bumped into each other in the hallway between classes, Malfoy had smelled of caramel and oranges and tea; a most intriguing smell.
“The other one — the one you weren’t about to marry — that’s the man I saw coming over to visit the other day, isn’t it?” Draco nodded silently. “He’s quite handsome. Those green eyes; I can see why you’re so confused.”
With Draco’s fairly decent size, Harry had been prepared for at least some discomfort. Not that he had too much experience with this kind of thing, but with the limited experience Harry
“That’s not the point. If you want this to work, you’ll have to pretend that this is real. You need to treat me as if I were the girl of your dreams.”
you." Gods, the mere idea makes Harry's cock begin to harden. "Please," he adds with what can only be described as a needy whine.
She smiled sweetly. “You’re in shock, I think. Were you burned, too?” She helped him stand and walk over to an open bed, where he collapsed in relief.
“As if I didn’t already know.” Draco scoffed, and before Harry had time to blink, the man was pinning him against the door, trapping both his hands above his head. “As if I cared. I—”
Harry shakes his head with a wry smile, watching as the photo version of Draco squeezes Photo Harry’s shoulder, tugging him closer without ever taking his sparkling eyes off the photographer. Photo Harry readily leans against his friend’s side and chances a furtive glance at the man, the corner of his mouth twitching before his gaze returns to the camera.
“Don’t do anything?” Sirius argued. “They float and they squeak. You know, when Harry was a baby, it was the only thing he ever wanted to play with while in the bath. He had a dozen, at least.”
However, escaping Draco’s clutches without waking him proved to be a futile endeavour. As Harry tried to slide out from his embrace, Draco merely tightened his hold on him and muttered something unintelligible against his shoulder. With some difficulty, Harry eventually managed to turn around to face him, allowing himself a moment to appreciate his peaceful features before attempting anything else.
Fire that never came, however, as Charlie’s body pushed Draco into an unconscious retreat, back through the wards. When the flame approached, bright and hot, Draco could feel the hair on his head and face rise, but it stopped, crashing into the wards only centimetres from where their bodies had fallen outside the paddock. It took the dragon a few moments before she appeared to realise she could no longer reach them,  huffing out a frustrated cloud of smoke as she turned her back to them, settling herself in the opposite corner of the paddock and ignoring their presence.
You want us to go to an Arrows-Falcons match together? Merlin, how will we ever keep from hexing each other senseless once the game heats up? But if you think we could manage it, sure, bring it on. Honestly though, I kind of like the idea of going to a match with you sometime. I bet you’d be able to appreciate a good seekers' duel just as much as I do, i.e. way better than any of my other friends, Ron and Ginny included.
“Okay,” he continued, taking a deep breath, then he turned back to Molly and Arthur. “So, that day at the hospital when we brought Charlie in—”
Harry returns to the view, contemplating Malfoy’s words as he watches the constant stream of tiny people moving along the streets below. He wonders what it means that Malfoy decided to take him here; if he’d anticipated an awkward silence to stretch out between them — just to give Harry a practical example of his point — or if he actually thought them ‘compatible and comfortable enough’ to enjoy it. Thing is, the current silence doesn’t feel uncomfortable at all, and when Harry eventually decides to break it, it’s solely out of sheer curiosity.
Potter would return tomorrow. Well, that gave Draco a deadline, at least. He’d have to figure this all out by tomorrow.
“Don’t ask me,” he said on a nervous chuckle, hoping the amusement would be enough to veil the sudden squeakiness to his voice. “But apparently she’s holding me responsible for your exam results now, so I thought I’d—”
And then he leans forward, supporting himself with one hand on either side of Harry's head. His wings fall to the side for a moment, and this time when he thrusts, Harry's world explodes.
“Circe, that was…” Draco pants, resting his head atop the back of the couch, his face turned towards the ceiling.
“Bullshit,” Ginny yapped, unaware of the way her mother’s eyes widened at the word choice. There were children at the table, after all. “You hate it when a man is taller than you, Harry. Or too much shorter.”
“That’s it.” Harry slumps down in his chair and hides his face in his hands. “I officially suck at dating.”
And fuck, what was Draco doing, checking Harry out like a horny teenager? Decidedly tearing his eyes off the man, he turned around to put his own hands onto the icy patch beneath him and crawled to the side where the grass gave him more traction.
“Wait,” Harry pants, regretting the word as soon as it leaves his mouth. Draco stiffens under him but doesn’t loosen his grip on Harry’s arse, as if afraid Harry would bolt if given half the chance. To be frank, Harry’s not sure that he wouldn’t, but Draco’s strong hands keep him grounded, assuring him Draco wants him to stay put. At least for now.
Harry led him several feet away and used his wand to erect a Privacy Charm around them. The murmurs of the room dimmed and the surrounding guests grew foggy, as though looked at through frosted glass. Draco could still make them out, though, and it seemed the entire room was looking on in interest.
Draco regretted the barb before it even passed his lips. He was better than that these days, he really was, but sometimes his defensive vulnerability still managed to catch him off guard.
“I know. And I do understand if you don’t want to believe me right now, but even so…” Potter drew back, prompting Draco to lift his head from Potter’s shoulder, urging him to meet his warm, green eyes. “Please have faith it will turn out okay. Eventually.”
Draco drew a deep breath, willing himself to calm the fuck down. A colossal mistake, since it only resulted in a fresh assault of his senses by the heady scent permeating the bedding — the scent of Harry. Earthy, spicy, sexy, safe.
“You know what?” she said when he refused to humour her taunting. “Get out of here. Go take a walk or something, then take the rest of the day off to get your head in working order.”
When Harry remained silent, Draco opened his eyes to find something dark troubling Harry’s features, something Draco wasn’t able to make out. Regret? Sadness? No, it didn’t seem likely. Maybe Harry’s face was only reflecting Draco’s own mood.
“Harry,” Hermione said, taking a seat next to him in the Gryffindor common room. “Maybe you should just try to become his friend?”
“So, Draco,” Molly said from her place two seats down on Draco’s right, drawing his attention, “do you have any other nice friends you could introduce to Harry, here? We’d so like for him to settle down with a lovely boy like yourself.”
The smell of the wings — the light caramel scent Harry associated with his beloved long before he knew his identity — is heady, and the cock now in front of him suddenly seems larger than it ever felt wrapped in his hand in a dark classroom or broom closet. It's pale and pink, and Draco is looking down at him, eyes dark and intense as he awaits Harry's next action, making it easy for Harry to let his instincts take over, stick out his tongue, and taste.
Harry’s chest heaves with his shallow breaths, his heart pounding furiously as he struggles to understand. Has Draco been hiding these feelings all along? Just like Harry? No, surely that’s impossi—
“True.” Harry tears his gaze from the stunning view of London to take in Malfoy’s equally stunning profile. “So, what to avoid then? Any examples?”
"Dinner?" Harry turned to face him, finally taking in the cottage behind them. It was quaint and rather charming, the warm glow spilling out from the windows welcoming its guests to step inside, only… Harry's eyes widened and he smiled. Next to them on the cobblestone veranda, a table was laid out under the evening sky, candles lit and wine poured, waiting just for them.
Concern. And worry. That’s what they convey. Mixed with a desire so fervent it sends a shiver down Harry’s spine.
At that, Draco couldn’t hold back his curiosity anymore. He turned around and sat up, trying to get his eyes to focus in the dim light from his floating night orb. “You have a son that’s going to Hogwarts too?”
“No! That’s okay.” The room erupted in laughter, and Ginny’s face turned red. “We agreed to forget that ever happened.”
It’d gone nearly an hour since the text was sent, and now that he finally got a chance to read it, Draco felt light-headed. True, he’d been powering through the afternoon rush on an empty stomach, his sandwich forgotten in the break room as the queue had only continued to grow, but he was fairly sure this wasn’t the reason for his current state.
Draco gave the elderly man an affirmative nod. “Certainly, sir. Would you like some whipped cream on top of the chocolate?”
The first time Draco’s childhood nemesis entered Beans & Serendipitea, Draco had been sure of two things.
Taking his refuge preoccupying himself with the espresso machine, he started in on Ginger’s order, relying on muscle memory alone as the mental whirlwind picked up speed in his brain yet again. It had been relentless ever since he first laid eyes on The Note, tossing his thoughts around in his mind much the same way as the brisk gusts of wind played with the autumn leaves on the street outside.
Soft, wet lips brushed the curve of Draco’s nape and he shuddered, his skin tingling under Harry’s ministrations as Harry slid his strong, warm hands along Draco’s arms, his fingers coming up to interlace with Draco’s where they still clutched at the abused bedsheet.
“Yeah.” Teddy smiled, wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist as he let himself be enveloped in a tight cuddle. “Thank you for taking me, Uncle Harry.”
To that end, he’d got in contact with Madam Rosmerta and, after apologising profusely for what he put her through during that awful Sixth Year, persuaded her to create and produce a new Butterbeer essence to complement the usual Muggle syrups on offer. (A wise move, as it turned out, considering how many Butterbeer lattes Draco and his staff already had on their tally this opening day.) He also reached out to Florean Fortescue’s daughter Florence (who, George had told him, had taken over her father’s ice cream parlour after the war), initiating a collaboration that resulted in Draco’s shop now being able to offer a weekly special pick of ice cream to flavour his chilled coffee drinks. The greatest conundrum to date, however, had proven to be finding a Muggle supplier able to provide the seasonal pumpkin spice syrup on a year-round basis; something Draco hoped he’d now been able to accomplish, although he really couldn’t say anything for certain until this year’s Hallowe’en was over and the deliveries would keep on coming. Or not.
Adjusting to the rhythm, Harry takes in the mesmerising sight before him. Draco's eyes are closed, his lips parted, and his head is thrown back as he loses himself in the pleasure of moving inside Harry. Oddly enough, it's not the low glow of Draco's skin cutting through the glamour he'd forgotten to remove that tears Harry apart. It's not Draco's beautiful, tumultuous wings, outstretched to their full span, contracting slightly each time Draco's hips meet Harry's arse.
Left with little option, Draco stepped past Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Arthur to have a seat next to Molly. Bill and Fleur stood near the wall on the other side of the bed smiling, Fleur occasionally reaching down to brush Charlie’s hair out of his face.
No, he needed to get over this crush. And he would, eventually, Harry was certain he could do it. But it would take time, more time than the universe seemed willing to give him. Because Draco wasn’t where he should be, a safe distance away in France. He was here, standing in Harry’s hallway, chatting with Teddy, and—
Like the time in Fourth Year when he refused to speak a single word to me in nearly a month because he thought I’d lied to him about not having put my name in the Goblet of Fire. He’s matured since then, thank Godric, so he can at least hold a somewhat normal conversation now (even if his resentment is still palpable), but unlike Fourth Year, this time I have actually been lying to him — well, lying by omission, but same difference — and not about something trivial either, but the fact that I’ve been making friends with you; the heir of his family’s generations-old adversaries. It’s like, well, let’s just say he’s not one for accepting monumental changes in his life lightly.
"Hey, no fair!" Hermione complains from behind them. "Draco's far worse about this than I am. I had a date night with Ron just last Saturday."
Being at the Burrow is not even half as bad as you make it sound. And the same goes for the family. I’m not ‘enduring’ my time with them, as you so nicely put it. I really do like being here, and I like them too — all of them — even if they tend to be a noisy, nosy bunch at times. Also, I think having me around seems to keep them distracted from the fact that Fred isn’t, and if that’s the case, I’m only happy to be of help. But yes, my astute friend, I’m probably procrastinating too.
Well, that explains why Ron hasn’t snuck out tonight. Harry refrains from commenting on the matter and wills himself not to think about what his best mates have been doing with him asleep in the same room. He looks down at the Marauders’ Map in his hands and knows Hermoine will insist on getting herself involved if he tells her what he’d been searching for. “Sorry. It’s nothing. Just looking for a jumper.”
Scowling, Draco entered his kitchen not waiting for Harry to follow him. “Right, well, I haven’t wanted to live in the manor for a decade, so I suppose I’ve changed.”
Harry frowns, sweeping his gaze around the bistro he’d chosen for their ‘date’. “Why? I come here all the time, and none of my dates has ever complained about it before. I like that it’s Muggle; that, here, I can be just Harry. I know the staff; I like the food. It’s a perfectly good place for a date.”
Naively, Draco had thought that would be it, but then he’d forgotten just how stubborn and insistent Gryffindors could be when they put their minds to something. It wasn’t even two weeks before Ron was back, this time with his jokester brother in tow, waxing lyrical about the idea to him before they were even seated in the armchairs in the cosy living-room-ish corner. George had taken one sip of his hazelnut latte, groaned in delight, and that was all it took for him. He was sold on the idea, claiming he’d do almost anything to have access to a place like Beans & Serendipitea within walking distance from his shop.
“Oh, yeah, sorry, I—” Harry gestured vaguely towards the coffee table. Draco glanced over at the ruby bowl in its centre and bit his lip, ignoring the nervous flutter in his stomach as he waited for Harry to elaborate. “You’ve got… It’s mine.”
Charlie gave Draco a tiny smile, showing off a crooked tooth Draco had never noticed before. It made him look like a naughty little boy always getting into trouble.
Sirius ducked in right after him but managed to avoid Draco. When he met Draco’s eyes, however, he grinned, shrugged, and then mouthed,
You’re dangling a bright green shot in front of my eyes and I realise my mind has wandered off, my gaze still fixed on your pouting lower lip. I blink, feeling heat rise on my cheeks, a poor imitation of the excited, rosy flush colouring yours. Your skin glistens in the light from the bar, sparkling like frost under a bright winter sun, and the amused smile curving your lips reaches all the way to your warm, grey eyes.
When they ended the call a few moments later, Draco still had no clue how he was supposed to help out studying for the exam. Surely, this not-knowing must be the cause of the flutter of anticipation suddenly itching under his skin.
Draco nodded, but Molly was smiling again. “Well, I didn’t need to know about…that” — she gestured to the bed — “but I’m glad that’s settled. Now, where’s that Healer with the update?”
Draco did get the message. He groaned and shuffled between Harry’s legs, adjusting his position to allow for him to tease Harry’s waiting hole. And teased he did, the wanker; licking and kissing and flicking his tongue over Harry’s pucker until Harry was a writhing mess underneath him, drawing back every time Harry thrust up against him, soaking his crease with enough saliva for Harry to feel it trickling down his perineum and wetting his balls.
“Draco?” Harry’s voice was soft, and when Draco looked up, Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand in his. Warm, strong, calloused. Reassuring. “Don’t worry about tomorrow, okay? You’ll love Hogwarts, I promise. You’ll make lots of friends, and you’ll learn magic, and play Quidditch, and have a brilliant time.”
had loved staying at Hogwarts for months on end without seeing their parents, without coming home. And now they just expected him to feel the same?
Harry rolls his eyes towards the ceiling, sighing in defeat at the all but lost cause. The first few months after Draco started calling him that, he tried to fight it, asking him to stop. The more Harry brought it up, though, the more Draco insisted and, after a while, Harry caught on and changed tactics, figuring if he only managed to act unbothered by the moniker, Draco would grow bored of using it. So far, it hasn’t helped matters much, but it’s an ongoing battle. A battle Harry is still hopeful he’ll come out of victorious.
“I bet.” Draco’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes this time, and Harry found himself wondering why. “You’re good with him, you know. I’m certain you’ll be a brilliant father one day.”
With other girls, I always feel like I have all these expectations to live up to, expectations I already know I’m never going to meet because they have this idolised image of me — this ‘hero’ — and despite what you called me a few letters ago, even you know that’s not who I really am. That I’m just Harry, an ordinary boy who only did what he had to do, and put plenty of people in mortal danger as he did.
And he did. The two of them came in almost every day after classes, occupying the small corner table in the back, spreading out their textbooks and essays and lecture notes all over its surface until the tabletop seemed to be made out of paper rather than wood. At first, Draco had assumed the two of them were together, but as the days passed and he never caught them kissing, or even touching, he wasn’t all that sure anymore. They felt close, though, as if they were the kind of friends who shared a flat and occasionally fell asleep next to each other in front of the telly. The kind of friendship Draco sometimes wished he had with someone too. Not that he minded living alone, it was pretty nice not to have to compromise and adjust to other people the way he’d had to do in the Slytherin dorms. It was just… well, sometimes alone turned into lonely, and when it did…
Sometimes I wish I were more apt for politics, but as you say, I would never make a good Minister for Magic. I don’t have the patience or diplomacy skills Shacklebolt has, and as long as he’s doing a great job, there’s no need for me or anyone else to challenge him for the post.
Harry needs Draco to capitulate. He needs Draco to come with him, to leave the studying behind, if just for a few hours, so they can spend some time alone. Hell, Harry just needs him. And Draco's birthday is special, dammit. Harry needs to show his mate how much he loves having him in his life.
Harry pinches one of Draco’s pebbled nipples, efficiently transforming Draco’s too sensible words into another delicious moan.
Draco’s heart sank. He knew what she was asking. And it wasn’t like he had anything special planned, just watching old holiday movies on the telly all day.
Draco closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, then nods. “Then let’s just tell people we’re dating, all right? Would you mind? Dating me?”
The room suddenly felt like someone had sucked all the air out of it, and every head turned to stare at Draco. Hell, he’d practically turned to stare at himself, it was so unplanned.
Don’t you have any music to listen to, at least, or does your record player crave magic too? I wish I could send you other things too, not only letters. If I could, I’d send you some muggle music to liven up your days. Or would you have preferred Celestina Warbeck?
“Witches and wizards, thank you for coming here today to bear witness to the union of Charles Cadmus Weasley and Draco Lucius Malfoy. A union between two souls is—”
You say it casually, in a hushed voice and with a playful twinkle in your eye, but I know the significance of what you’re saying. We’ve talked about it before, the distinct possibility of them disapproving of your sexuality, of them expecting you to disregard it, to hide it. The possibility of them disowning you if you insist on staying true to yourself.
“Well, yeah.” Harry’s smirk served as a shot of espresso to Draco’s stirring arousal. “You see, you’ll never be ‘just anybody’ to me.”
— for fashion advice?” I raise my brows and the corner of your mouth twitches in amusement. Good. My words seem to do the trick so I blab on, heedlessly. “You have impeccable taste; you always look as if you just walked straight out of a glossy magazine. You don’t need me to tell you what to wear to look pretty, Malfoy; you always do.”
. In fact, he’s the worst friend ever. Surely, no good man would lust for his best friend or fantasise about doing devious things to him, in the shower or otherwise. No good man would sit here, drinking tea with his flatmate while secretly longing to lean in and kiss him, or heck, just hold him. Maybe cuddle him a little before falling asleep in his arms?
“So… You really want this?” he says, searching Draco’s face warily. “It’s not just a spur-of-the-moment thing? Because I wouldn’t want to wake up tomorrow with a ruined friendship and a broken heart.”
“Is it now?” she drawled, her eyebrows hidden far up beneath her bangs. “Because in this entire conversation, you haven’t mentioned being worried about Charlie once.”
On the national level, I’m sure you’d be happy to know the Arrows are currently in the lead, closely followed by the Falcons and the Wasps. They still have three rounds to go before the season is over, and from the looks of it, almost any team still has a shot at the cup (except for maybe the Cannons, as per usual). You’re an Arrows fan, right? Better bask in the leading position now then, before my Falcons swoop in and steal your thunder from under your nose.
“Yeah?” Harry breathes, hoping against hope for an extra-curricular masterclass in the wonders of passionate lip-locking.
That thought kept running through his mind as he brushed his teeth, applied his moisturisers, and changed into his pyjamas. He didn’t mind being alone. It suited him just fine.
Harry’s mind is whirling, trying to make sense of Draco’s words, of any of it. But it’s awfully hard, impossible really, when Draco’s standing there before him, all shimmering wings and perfect skin and soft, silver-blond hair. He’s beautiful, ethereal, almost too much to take in, a sight too precious for his simple human eyes. For a fleeting moment, Harry thinks he shouldn’t be here, that he shouldn’t be allowed to witness this. That he probably should turn around and leave.
“Thanks. I—” Harry licks his lips. “How about you? Any hot date waiting for you now that you don’t have to entertain me anymore?”
He had no idea how Draco could possibly know. He’d never told anyone. Hell, he’d barely even admitted it to himself. But Draco knew. He seemed to know exactly what his praise did to Harry, how it made him shudder and melt, how it spiked his arousal nearly as much as Draco’s physical ministrations did.
Narcissa didn’t counter her sister’s dig at her husband, but her momentary silence spoke volumes. “Well, since Draco isn’t here, how about you join me for a nice cup of tea in the Purple Parlour instead? I think the elves just made a fresh batch of those cranberry biscuits you like so much.”
Harry peers down at Orion, enjoying the way his beautiful emerald scales gleam in the early June sunshine. It's a beautiful day, but Harry is too nervous to really enjoy it, too keyed up about his evening plans for his boyfriend's nineteenth birthday.
Amusement still fizzling through his body, Draco grinned and looked down into Harry’s deep green eyes, their joint laughter combining and forming a little cloud that hovered between them. Harry blinked up at him, and Draco realised he could discern every individual eyelash fluttering, despite the surrounding darkness. Circe, they were close. So close the tips of their noses were nearly touching. So close he could feel Harry’s hot breath against his skin, on his lips. So close.
He opened the window and stuck his head out into the spitting rain. Hell, it wasn’t even rain, but some sort of half-frozen sleety mess that stuck to his face in wet clumps as it fell.
And apart from defence and flying, there’s really not much I’m actually good at. I don’t have the brains Hermione does, nor the potions skills you do. I’m not a strategist like Ron or an entrepreneur like George. I don’t even know a fraction of what Nev knows about plants, and no matter what Luna says, I certainly shouldn’t be trusted taking care of any creatures, not when I can’t even seem to take care of myself. I can’t deny a quidditch career might have crossed my mind at some point, but how would I ever know if I was drafted for my talent and not for the marketing value of my name?
"Well, more of a light evening tea. Molly's food is a bit heavy. This is just something small to keep us going for the night." Draco flicked his wand and some gentle violin began to play through the cottage's open window.
Next weekend’s the last quidditch match of the season; Gryffindor-Ravenclaw. Poor Gin and her team need to not only win but score at least 330 points to defend the cup. I swear they wouldn’t have been in this hopeless position if they’d only let me play. At least we’re not the only ones suffering this year; your old team could’ve really used your talent last week against Hufflepuff. If you’d been there, I’m sure the badgers wouldn’t be in the lead right now.
Did you know your mother sent her sister a painting of you last week? One with you sitting in an armchair, reading in front of the fire? Andromeda showed it to me that same afternoon after your letters arrived. She really is talented, your mum. Every detail was stunning, every curve of your face, every line of your clothes, and Merlin, the lighting — I barely restrained the urge to trace my fingers over the picture to double-check if the warmth I saw licking your skin was as real as it looked. As for the sight of you, I must say I’m pleased you seem to be doing all right, all things considered. Sure, you’re paler than usual, but who wouldn’t be after spending almost a year and a half indoors? Apart from that, though, you look
“…and that’s basically it,” Draco says as they approach Harry’s front door. “Because I hope to Merlin I won’t have to teach you about the birds and the bees too.”
Harry rolls his eyes. "But then what would you complain about?" He glances over to see Ron and Hermione busy arguing over their evening's revision schedule, then lowers his voice. "Don't forget I made plans for us tonight. The Owlery, ten o'clock."
“Pretty sure, yeah.” Harry darts out his tongue to lick the pulse point at the base of Draco’s neck, rocking his hips suggestively to gauge the potential of another round sometime in the near future. Not that he’d ever doubt his own interest, but two is always more fun than one, right?
So he’d come. But between meals, he’d so far spent all his waking hours in here, in the vast family library, going through endless shelves of wisdom and nonsense, in search of… nothing in particular, really. Just anything to keep himself occupied and as far away as possible from the Dark Lord and his snake and…
“Why the fuck did you lie to me?” There it was, the question Draco had been asking himself for years.
The room fell quiet and all eyes turned to Draco in unison. It was a rather comical sight, reminding Draco of a pack of meerkats on the lookout. It might have even made him laugh, had he not been genuinely afraid half the people in the room wouldn’t hesitate to attack him if given half the chance.
The head of Draco's prick is softer than Harry expected it to be as it connects with his tongue. He wraps his hand around the base and runs his nose along the length, nuzzling it and leaving a trail of soft, wet kisses as he goes. Draco's whimper encourages Harry to run his tongue along the foreskin, licking and sucking, unhurriedly following the vein that runs along the bottom of Draco's cock, back to the end where he sucks the knob into his mouth.
Draco’s arms tightened around him. “About New Year’s Eve,” he whispered, against the sensitive spot right under Harry’s ear. “I don’t care where I am as long as I get to kiss you at midnight.”
It had then taken quite a lot of persuasion by the Weasley brothers, paired with a steady stream of silent encouragement from Harry, before Draco even allowed himself to entertain the idea, let alone think of it as a viable option for his own future — despite its undeniable business potential.
Blondie looked sceptical, which prompted Draco to add, “How about you take one of those and one double chocolate to share? I’m positive she’ll prefer the ginger one, but this way you’ll leave the ultimate choice up to her, doubling your chances to leave her satisfied.”
As soon as Harry’s lips were on him, Draco’s every intention was turned to ash, incinerated by the blazing heat of their mutual desire. Soon, Harry was devouring him, his tongue hot and wet as it surged inside, greedily exploring every corner of Draco’s mouth. And Draco let him, eagerly giving as good as he got, one hand tangled in Harry’s messy — but oh so silky soft — hair, the other venturing down the ridge of Harry’s spine on a quest for that perfectly rounded arse he’d been lusting after for so long.
"And the brightest witch of our age," Ron boasted, resting his chin over her shoulder. "But of course you want to study first. You wouldn't be our Hermione if you didn't."
Draco’s strong hands found their way back to Harry’s arse, grabbing it eagerly and pressing their bodies even closer together with every thrust. Without breaking their kiss, Harry reached up to relieve Draco of his coat, pushing it over his shoulders and revelling in the feel of bared skin under his palms as he followed its path down Draco’s upper arms. It got stuck at his elbows, of course, what with Draco’s hands being occupied where they were, and Harry tugged on the garment until Draco got the message and reluctantly let go of his hold.
Maybe now’s not the best time to divulge the fact that he once declined an invitation to their grand opening.
Draco’s heart rate slowly returned to something resembling normal, and he glared. “Well, you certainly let me know, didn’t you? What are you doing here?”
Harry frowned, reaching out for the half-empty wine bottle to top off their glasses as he seemed to ponder Draco’s words. “Wanting to hide, huh?”
Harry, who didn’t seem to have any limitations when it came to sugar, closed his lips around another spoonful of the sweet dessert and moaned as he savoured it with half-lidded eyes. Draco felt his blood rush south at the mere sight of him, imagining that same blissed-out face, that same sinful sound in a whole other setting. A setting that involved a bed, tangled sheets, sweat-glistening skin, and much fewer clothes. The thought was so distracting, he nearly missed Harry’s next words as they fell out of his mouth, sounding more casual and innocent than they ever had a right to, considering the revelation they carried.
However, when he placed the two coffees on the counter between them, her curious expression was still there. She cocked her head towards their table, a subtle motion that could have easily gone unnoticed by anyone. A gesture Draco knew he’d do better to ignore. Yet, he was powerless to resist a quick glance in the suggested direction.
“I-I am?” Heat rushes to Harry’s cheeks, effectively ruining his intended casual, teasing demeanour.
Apparently, I’d been acting a bit distracted all morning, because when we all gathered in the kitchen for a short snack break, Luna pointed out I supposedly was the victim of a major nargle infestation. Her signature out-of-the-blue comment might as well have been a Silencio for how quickly everyone stopped talking to turn their attention my way, concerned frowns all around — until Blaise, the nitwit, shared an amused look with Theo, shrugged, and said, and I quote, ‘Nah, it’s just his usual Saturday bug.’
What the hell made you think I’d ever be interested in becoming Minister for Magic? Godric, your brain really works in mysterious ways sometimes. And not that I have any idea how you know about my auror aspirations, but surely you would know me well enough to know I’d never use my name like that to get ahead. If I ever get the chance to be an auror, I want it to be because I have the right skills and abilities to do it, not because of my fucking name.
Buckbeak. Hagrid’s hut, that you set on fire just before I caught up with you and Snape after Dumbledore was killed. Even the trophy room, to which you once invited me to a wizard’s duel but later proved to be too much of a coward to ever show up. Every bathroom in the castle.
He took a deep breath and stood up, rubbing his hands over his face. He bent over and picked up the canvas bag from the floor.
“Yeah, but…” Just because Harry was helplessly smitten by his gorgeous roommate didn’t mean Malfoy would ever feel the same.
It’s okay. Love is only meant for some; I know that. And I am happy for you. I must be. Because you’re happy, and that’s the only thing that really matters.
“Your friend gave it to me,” he said. Then, once he realised how that must have sounded, he quickly added, “I— I didn’t ask her for it or anything. She just…gave it to me. Yesterday. I—”
I curse to myself and take a long swallow from my forgotten bottle of ale, decidedly tearing my eyes away from you and your striking beauty. As I do, the music returns to my awareness —
The sound of the gulls and the lapping of waves in the distance, not to mention the smell of the sea, gave Harry a pretty damned good idea of where they were. Well, not like, where on a map, but definitely somewhere near the sea.
Harry takes a deep breath through his nose, willing his heart to slow down. His fingers are itching to run through his hair, but he manages to resist the urge at the last minute. Instead, he hastens to clench his fist and knock on the door before his courage leaves him.
Draco cocked an eyebrow but did his best not to imagine Charlie Weasley off debauching himself, or anyone else for that matter. “How do you know that’s what he was up to? He may have been spending the weekend with his saint of a mother.”
“Pardon,” muttered a middle-aged woman who rammed him with her shoulder, too busy perusing the shopfronts to look where she was going.
I can’t say I’ve received all that many birthday presents in my life, but Merlin, Malfoy. You wrote me a song? And maybe I should wait until I’ve heard it played before I say anything, because I know there’s a chance you’re just messing with me and the song will turn out to be a right torture to listen to, but for some reason, I get the feeling that’s not the case. I’ve contemplated asking Fleur to play it for me, but for some reason, I don’t want my first time hearing it to be in a house full of curious Weasleys who’ll want to know what it is and where I got it from. But I have a plan. I’ll be staying with Andromeda and Teddy next weekend, and I know she has a piano in her living room. I don’t know if she plays herself or if the piano was her husband’s or daughter’s, but if she does, I’m going to ask her to play it for me when I’m there. Godric, I still can’t believe you did that. That’s probably the most personal gift I’ve ever gotten. Thank you.
Harry’s brain simply refused to cooperate, leaving him to fight his rambunctious emotions alone. Draco was here, standing on his doorstep, and Harry didn’t know what to— He swallowed, reminded himself he was a Gryffindor, and croaked, “Then, I guess you’d better let him in...”
But Fleur simply smiled. “It’s fine. Oui, that’s how it is with Bill and me. But don’t forget I’m Veela, which makes it a bit different for us, too. See, my magic helped me find the person I was most compatible with. It pulled us together.”
to have a good time. It’s only when they’re comfortable and relaxed in your company that they will be able to focus on getting to know you and, even more importantly, able to start showing you their true self. You want to sweep them off their feet, and that’s not done through awkward silences or anxious tension. You’ll both be jittery enough as it is, without that extra level of nervousness.”
However, when Draco entered the bathroom, Myrtle wasn’t the one there to greet him. Instead, standing in the corner, hands deep in his jeans pockets, leaning against one of the sinks, was…
You seem to think I like this whole celebrity nonsense… And now that I think about it, maybe you always have? Well, I don’t. In fact, nothing can be farther from the truth. Did you know I have to polyjuice myself every time I want to visit Diagon Alley without being overrun by
The man had regained a little colour, so that was good, and the bandages covering the burns on his arms had been removed, exposing new, pink skin shiny with potions. Draco set the gift bag he’d brought on the rolling hospital table and took a seat next to Charlie.
“I am?” The boy turned to look at him, then Draco, then the steps before his gaze returned to Draco once more, a huge grin on his face.
Stepping into the letter room, Harry’s eyes are inevitably drawn to the door leading out to the roost. It’s open just a crack, and through the gap he can discern the subtle movement of something light in the surrounding darkness, something shimmering like stardust in the pale radiance of the moon. A large wing, nearly six feet in height, obscuring the view of a man standing in the window, overlooking the grounds. Harry can’t see the man’s features, but he doesn’t have to. He already knows his name. He’s read it on the map.
“All right then.” They come to a standstill on Harry’s doorstep, turning towards each other. Harry can feel the anticipation gathering in the pit of his stomach, a swirl of jittery heat pulsing at his core. “In that case, I think you just passed the exam, Potter. I have nothing more to teach you.”
“I don’t like to hide. I’ve hidden enough in my life, and…honestly, I’m not sure I could keep this —
The rest of the collection faded into nothingness as soon as Draco’s gaze fell on the majestic piece in the middle. It was several feet tall and flowed up like fountains of spun sugar twisted around one another, the rich blues, yellows, and teals so vivid that Draco could have sworn they were moving, undulating against one another. It was beautiful. Sensuous. Arousing.
But Draco didn’t give Harry a chance to finish. Instead, he pulled the man to him again and plunged.
“It’s so strange to see him like this, so quiet and still. Charlie’s always been one of the most active of Molly’s sons, constantly running around and full of life. This is…unsettling.”
Draco missed whatever Ernie was saying as the door slammed shut, cutting off the sound. Hurrying across the grounds, Draco scolded himself for not checking the bag sooner. Or checking with the other keepers. Or
They find me, of course, almost immediately, catching me watching you across the room long before I have time to avert my gaze. You smile and raise your glass in greeting, unknowingly sending my heart into overdrive with your amused wink. As you turn back to your conversation a moment later, I can only hope you never noticed the heat burning on my cheeks.
And yeah, staying away from that wine cellar is probably a wise choice. Like you, I haven’t had many opportunities to get properly drunk throughout the years, and after Ron’s birthday bash, I felt so crap it took me several days to get back to normal. (Professor Silverberry was decidedly not impressed by the lot of us and had plenty to say about it the following day, stressing the importance of adults showing responsibility and being good role-models for the kids, etc.)
He’s almost afraid to raise his head to meet Draco’s eyes, uncertain of what he’ll find in those silver-grey depths. Then he reminds himself he’s a Gryffindor. He can do this. How bad can it be?
“I’m sorry, Mr Potter,” he said quietly. “I can’t.” Harry’s face fell, and his green eyes suddenly lost their sparkle. It was a devastating sight, and Draco wouldn’t have been able to torture the man any longer even if he’d wanted to. He cleared his throat. “My time here tonight is for people who purchased a ticket.”
Harry takes a moment to focus on the intricate matter of measuring the loose leaf tea into their mugs, knowing Draco will notice — and complain — if he fails to get the water-tea ratio just right. The man is a finicky one to live with, to say the least, not that it came as any surprise to Harry when he moved in. What did surprise him, though, is how much Harry doesn’t mind.
Harry felt his cock harden at the thought, and Draco must have felt it too because he let out an intriguing little groan and nudged into Harry's hips with his own.
Harry lost track of time, looking into those twinkling grey eyes. He was dimly aware of the conversation between child and elf going on beside him, but it wasn’t until Draco nodded pointedly in Teddy’s direction that Harry hastened to return his attention to the boy. Unfortunately not before catching Draco winking at him, turning Harry’s knees to jelly with a casual dip of his long eyelashes.
Ernie grinned and shrugged, his hunched shoulders and rounded face making him look like the guileless Hufflepuff he was. “Sorry, mate, but there’s a lot to do just keeping this place running. By the time I get back here most days, I don’t have enough energy to do more than just throw everything down and hope for the best.” Something seemed to catch the man’s eye, and he leant forwards across the desk to withdraw a wrinkled piece of parchment from the dustbin next to it. “Is this it?”
Sirius conjured a chair next to Draco and took a seat, his graceful movements betraying his pure-blood upbringing. Draco recognised it from his own childhood, and he suddenly realised that this man, who he didn’t even know, had numerous memories of Narcissa that Draco didn’t.
It still looked the same, everything still as neat and polished as it’s always been, every piece of furniture in the same spot, every tapestry on the same wall, every ornament where it’s always been. Yet, it didn’t feel like home anymore. It was no longer the safe haven he’d been homesick for those first few months — well, okay then, years — after leaving for Hogwarts.
Draco’s observations were soon proved incorrect, though, as Harry caught sight of him and that brilliant smile of his evaporated before Draco’s eyes.
Harry and Janie had come in at half ten (not that Draco was keeping track), and they’d both been deeply immersed in their studies ever since. Janie had placed their orders, just as usual, and Harry hadn’t texted him once. It was as if the last week had never happened, and by the time Lady Grey and her husband had entered the shop for their weekly fix, Draco was all but convinced The Note, and everything related to it, had only been a creation of his wildest fantasies.
“Hey! I’m not even two months older than you,” Draco exclaimed, giving Harry’s shoulder a half-hearted shove even as his insides buzzed with excitement. The promise of more to come was certainly more than he’d ever dared hope for, but so was this; the two of them together, lying side by side, bantering like old friends.
The look on Malfoy’s face tells him all there is to know. If Harry were to return with only one purchased item from this shopping spree, this would be it.
“That’s… I—” Malfoy clears his throat and licks his lips, then frowns. “Hmm, try…” Harry shivers as the gentle ripple of wandless magic wafts over him, unfastening the two uppermost buttons of the shirt, allowing him to breathe. “There. Better?”
“Please forgive me.” Potter’s eyes were drawn with… concern? Empathy? Regret? Draco didn’t know, and he never got the chance to ask. He was still trying to make sense of the kiss, still trying to remember how to breathe when Potter blinked into nothingness before his eyes.
“No. Yes, I—” He really should take the out Harry was offering, if for no other reason, then for his own sanity’s sake. But even as he tried to form the words, to make this torture stop, he found himself incapable of doing so. The truth was, Draco didn’t want this to end… He didn’t want Harry to stop touching him ever again.
Unable to voice any reply, Draco went for a slight nod instead, then drew back to look at her. “I have to tell him.”
“Well, Charlie suggested it. Something about second chances and making things right.” Draco averted his eyes, but he didn’t miss Harry’s shoulders tensing in his peripheral vision.
When he returned to the sitting room, the armchair Draco had been sitting in was empty and it took Harry a moment before he noticed the man standing off in the corner perusing the Christmas tree. It really did look chaotic, just like you’d expect from a tree decorated by an over-excited five-year-old and their very indulgent godfather. Harry liked it, though. Not that it was all that aesthetically pleasing to look at — it definitely wasn’t — but because it reminded him of how enjoyable Christmas could be for a kid who’d never had to experience the kind of childhood he himself had. Every time he looked at it, it made him love the holiday even more.
“A pumpkin spice latte and a cauldron cake, please.” The squat, older witch peered up at Draco with curious eyes, her mauve-tinted lips twitching with a million unvoiced questions.
There was a bit of commotion as a young girl, no more than a toddler, broke into tears just as she was about to climb the steps. Apparently, the idea of approaching the bearded stranger had become more frightening as reality caught up with her. It wasn’t until her dad suggested she and her older sister go together that she agreed to leave his safe embrace. Draco seemed to take it all in stride, lifting up one girl onto each knee and coaxing broad smiles out of the pair of them in no time.
“M’not.” Teddy’s voice was firm and… much closer than it had been only moments before. Harry looked over his shoulder to find the boy standing in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest. “It’s really him.”
Harry reaches for Draco's fly and begins to work it open as Draco tries to distract him, capturing Harry's mouth. The taste of Draco infuses his senses but doesn't stop him from expertly shoving the man's trousers aside to reach his goal. On Draco's long moan, Harry drops to his knees, the soft grass cool under him as it cushions his weight. He runs his hands up Draco's thighs and marvels as Draco's wings unexpectedly come around to caress Harry's back.
He approached the entrance, hearing the murmurs within, and slowly unwound his formal cloak from his shoulders and draped it over his arm. He was wearing a set of his best silvery-grey dress robes and he knew they looked good on him. He’d taken the time to arrange his still-too-long hair just so but hadn’t had the heart or the energy to apply the finishing touches around his eyes. Eyeliner was probably too much for a morning wedding, anyway.
“It’s complicated. But what about you?” Harry shot back. “Would your mother be pleased to know that you’re terrified of your own happiness? To know that you keep coming up with excuses not to go back to a place that was so special to you both?”
Harry moves to sit down by the kitchen table while the tea steeps, sighing as he tilts his head towards the ceiling. He wishes there were something he could do to help, something more productive than brewing tea and volunteering his perfected bantering skills, but he knows that’s not how life works.
Fuck. Why must I always leave evreything til the last minute? I fucking knew we were going out last night, and yet… You see, it was Ron’s b-day the othre day, so of course we had to go to the 3Bs to celebrate him porperly as soon as weekend struck. And I knew there’d be alcohol, but fuck, I’ve never been so plastered in my life… Have yuo ever been drunk, M? Ever woken up the next day feeling like you’re heads about to explode and you’re stomach is about to turn inside out if you so much as open your eyes? Merlin, I don’t even know if I’m hungover or still drunk… How’d you know that?
“Er…” Draco hesitated, cheeks turning pink. “You’ve got some…” he mumbled, gesturing vaguely, “…on your neck…”
Draco's still mumbling, leaning over Harry, his muscular arms now holding him above Harry as he snaps their hips together.
Draco could barely breathe, waiting for Bellatrix’s response. Out of all things about his aunt, her unpredictability was what scared him the most. Her constant whims made it impossible to anticipate her next move, her mind just as unpredictable as a box of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans.
Fleur sighed and wrapped herself around Bill, laying her head onto his shoulder. “Was it love at first sight?”
The low rumble of Draco’s baritone reached him from the hallway, reawakening the sodding pixies in the pit of Harry’s stomach.
“Fuck,” he mutters, breathing heavily. Harry tries to catch his breath, gaze fixed on the man in front of him, his kiss-swollen lips, his flushed skin, his heavy-lidded eyes.
Thanks to Potter’s need to chat up the Dragon-Weasel, there was only one sledge left waiting for them once they finally reached the top of the hill. Draco offered to cast a Doubling Charm on it, but Potter called him silly and insisted they’d share it. So here he was, arms wrapped around Potter’s torso, nose buried in Potter’s soft knitted scarf, groin alarmingly close to Potter’s arse. It was like the Room of Requirement all over again and Draco’s heart beat wildly in his chest as they rushed down the slope.
You actually don’t know what a shared patronus form means, do you? Yes, in its original state it represents the caster’s innermost personality, but as it happens, it can change. If the caster falls in eternal, unchanging love, it’s not unusual for their patronus form to change to match their loved one’s. Yes, Snape was in love with my mum, probably ever since before they went to Hogwarts, and once Riddle threatened to kill her, he went to Dumbledore for help, swearing loyalty to him as a way to try to save her. It’s astounding what you’re willing to do for the ones you love, isn’t it?
Harry’s eyes crinkled in laughter. “Several times. So can we talk? Please? I have something I wanted to ask you.”
“Oh, shut up,” Ernie said, laughing at the pun. The sound of the front door slamming shut out in the reception area reminded them both that others might be listening to their conversation. Ernie lowered his voice. “Evidently that’s
He gathered his resolve and took a deep breath, unintentionally inhaling a lungful of the smoke still lingering in the fabric of his clothes. It clawed at his windpipe and made his eyes water, but he didn’t care. He was too preoccupied trying to make his trembling legs hold his weight as he scrambled to stand.
His rational voice, the one that still insisted on sounding like Snape, tried to remind him of his initial concerns. What if Harry really was out to get him? Draco had no means of knowing what the man had in store for him tonight. Who in their right mind would agree to go alone to an unknown address, entering their old nemesis’ private den?
He reluctantly broke the kiss, not quite sure how to voice his rapidly growing desperation but compelled to try anyway. Before he could, though, Harry threw him off track by murmuring something under his breath, something Draco had no way of catching, what with all the sensations currently assaulting him. A wandless spell, Draco soon realised, as, suddenly, Harry’s palm was slick with magically conjured lube.
He hadn’t wanted to go back for Easter, but just as with everything else in his life, he hadn’t had a say in the matter. Not showing up at the manor would have looked suspicious, and the Dark Lord’s suspicion was the last thing his family needed right now. They were still recuperating from Father’s failure at the Department of Mysteries almost two years ago; anything but total compliance now would be utterly foolish.
“Yeah, well, maybe someday.” The noncommittal tone in Harry’s voice made Draco want to smack him over the head and talk some sense into him. He didn’t. Instead, he focused on the piece before him, his gaze following the mesmerising swirls and twists of the glass. “That one’s spoken for, though, so don’t get too attached.”
“Waiting for me to…? Wait,” Draco raised an eyebrow, “you’re trying to blame me for your blue balls?”
PS Dragon Dust? I’ve never listened to them before but apparently, Hannah’s a big fan and when I asked her about it, she lent me that third album you mentioned. It’s quite all right, I guess, but if you hadn’t told me, I never would’ve guessed you were into them. Now that I know, though, I figure it makes sense; the moody melancholy in some of those songs is bloody brutal. Based on them, I bet you’d love muggle artists like Tracy Chapman, Sade, and maybe Alanis Morissette.
Harry winced at the sharp metallic sound of his whisk beating the inside of the saucepan. It felt awfully loud in the otherwise quiet kitchen, and Harry almost regretted being the cause of it. Almost. He did have a good reason for producing it, after all.
Harry smiles at that. They have time to figure this out, to make it work. The idea excites him more than anything else.
Draco had no idea how time-turners worked, but he’d figure it out. Heck, if nothing else, he’d become an Unspeakable, just to be able to get access to the secrets hidden deep within the Department of Mysteries. It wasn’t the first time he’d considered it. After all, Potter had once called him a mystery-solver, and Draco had to admit the implication had always intrigued him. He already knew he’d ace the N.E.W.T.s needed to qualify for the training, and while his work on the vanishing cabinet was something he’d rather not think about if he could help it, his success fixing it would make for an outstanding accomplishment on his CV if he ever were to apply.
A young woman in blue Mediwitch robes approached him, frowning as she hunched down in front of him. “Malfoy? Are you okay? Do you need help too?”
And just like that, he’s gone, whisked away by the magic of Disapparition, leaving Harry and his futilely waiting lips behind in the chilly February night.
His fingers were stiff, chilled to the bone from the unforgiving climate of the season. Although the temperature rarely crept below zero out here, the proximity to the ocean brought a rawness to the air that no known warming charm was ever able to stave off for long. No, the Hebridean winter was certainly not a pleasant experience by any means, but the dragons favoured the humidity — or at least their scales did — and that was really all that mattered.
With only one week left before the end of the term, they really shouldn’t let anything distract them from their studies; Harry knew that, even without having Hermione mentioning it in every single letter she sent. Yet, when Goyle pointed out how lovely the grounds looked all dressed in white, sparkling in the sun like a luxurious wedding gown, Harry couldn’t help looking up from his Potions essay.
PPS Don’t worry about Theo and me, that kiss was just a one-time thing, I promise. Merlin, if I had known you were still so hung up on him, I never would have let him do it. Any other blokes in your past that I should know about, just so I don’t accidentally step on your precious toes again?
“What’s up?” Your voice, deep and hot by my ear, soothes my rising irritation in a heartbeat. Your familiar lemony scent is mingled with heavy notes of vodka and sweat, and I relax as I feel your body heat against my back, reaching out to me from where you stand somewhere close behind me.
Harry stepped closer to shake Mr Champon’s outstretched hand, and Draco found his gaze turning towards the man of its own volition. Harry was as gorgeous as ever, dressed in a charcoal-grey suit that hugged his torso perfectly. His hand had barely left Mr Champon’s grasp before he turned to Draco, his vibrant, green eyes meeting Draco’s for the first time in nearly a week.
“No, but seriously,” Harry said a few moments later as he tried to regain control of his features. “Put like that, it does sound scary as fuck. Do you think that’s what Sirius is going through too?”
I don’t…” Harry followed Charlie’s gaze to where Malfoy stood glaring at them from under the edge of his purple bobble hat. “We’re not…”
You open your mouth to try again, but no words come out. Not that I need to hear them; that distraught expression can only mean one thing.
One of Draco’s hands is resting on Harry’s thigh, its warmth seeping through the fabric of Harry’s joggers. The other moves lazily over Harry’s back, trailing random patterns up and down his spine. Harry is pretty sure Draco’s not even aware of doing it, that he has no fucking clue how every featherlight touch of those fingertips sends pleasant shivers across Harry’s skin.
Ginny knows this, she knows me, and she still likes spending time with me. And I like her too, so I’m not really sure why we haven’t gotten back together yet. Unlike you, I actually like children, and I do long for a family of my own someday. I’m not saying it has to happen straight away, I’m fully aware I’m only 18 (although it sometimes feels like I’ve aged two decades in the past two years), but I do want it. I want it with someone who feels like an equal, not anyone who started out as an avid fan. And I honestly have no idea who that’d be, if not Ginny. Plus, you know, at least with her, I wouldn’t have to worry about being accepted by my future in-laws, right?
Draco's lips moved from Harry's mouth, following Harry's jawline, leaving a trail of barely-there kisses down his neck. The oral exploration reached fabric much too soon, and Harry stifled a whimper as Draco drew back, his skin already missing the touch. But then Draco pulled Harry's collar aside and stopped to stare at Harry's soul mark.
Draco usually didn’t care much for half-arsed undressing during sex, but there was no way he’d break their skin-on-skin action now just to wriggle out of his pants. Not that it mattered much. Those pants were all but forgotten the moment Harry draped his legs around Draco’s hips and thrust up against him, their hard cocks finally able to come together with no barriers separating them.
“Er, sure.” Harry waited in the living room as Draco went to serve Smaug his dinner. When he returned, Draco found him with a thoughtful look on his face. “So, who is this Slyvia character? I passed her on my way up. She’s…” — He paused, looking like he searched for an appropriate word choice — “pretty.”
And his eyes… His eyes had been bleak, and when they’d turned to meet Harry’s, there had been no hope to find in their misty-grey depths. Harry will never forget them. They reminded him of how Sirius’s had looked that first time they met.
He surreptitiously wiped his brow with the back of his hand before pushing a stray lock of hair behind his ear. The loose bun at the nape of his neck was in dire need of a re-do, but it just had to wait. Instead, he kept his attention on the task at hand, using a pair of tongs to transfer a scone from the display case onto a waiting plate. “Any spreads with that?”
Draco turned his gaze towards its source and frowned. It was impossible to make out a recognisable object from the shape lingering in the shadows, covered by years’ worth of dust. And having grown up in a house filled with old cursed artefacts, he knew better than to just extend his hand and grab an unknown object without further examination.
"Draco," Harry breathes, trying to hold on to his sanity. But it's futile, all he can do is go along for the ride.
You are chatting, Richard is appraising, Michael is smiling — none of you aware of the heart breaking in my chest.
Draco turned away. He couldn’t do this anymore. He was exhausted, and his head hurt, not to mention his heart. “No, you’re right, she wouldn’t. But you have no idea what it’s like to be alone.”
No, silly, our house wasn’t all that tiny. In fact, there were four bedrooms on the second floor, the master, the guestroom, and Dudley’s two rooms. After my aunt and uncle realised Dumbledore knew about our sleeping arrangements (my Hogwarts letter was literally addressed to ‘the cupboard under the stairs’), they were quick to give me my cousin’s 2nd bedroom, much to his chagrin. That’s more or less how it always was, me taking over Dudley’s discarded stuff; toys, books, clothes… even though he was several sizes bigger than I was. The first piece of clothing I owned that was bought just for me and actually fit was my school robes, the ones I was measured for when I first met you.
“Yup.” Harry smiled and reached over to tuck a stray lock behind Draco’s ear. “But I’ll give you a minute or two to catch your breath first, old man, before—”
“Oh, pish-posh,” she said, a slight tinge of rose spreading over her cheeks. “I did most of it, yes, but I love it. There’s nothing better than watching people eat the food you made them.”
Okay, so let me get this straight. If I trust you about Grimmauld Place being a petulant, resentful bitch, you’ll trust me about Sev being on our side in the war; is that what you’re saying? Because, then, hell yes, I’ll trust you. I know what I saw in that pensieve, and as much as I didn’t want to believe it, it didn’t really leave much room for doubt.
I can’t imagine you ever knew Glyn Raywood, the new Transfiguration Professor. Although he’s a Slytherin — your new Head of House, in fact, since Slughorn retired — he’s a half-blood and has been abroad for his research since before we were born. Apparently, he and McGonagall have known each other since their own Hogwarts days, and I totally get why she chose him for the post. You see, she’s been very adamant on breaking up old house prejudices this year, and he’s a good choice for a Slytherin representative to remind people that being sorted into Slytherin doesn’t automatically mean you have to become an unreliable, wicked git. He’s an inspiring role model for your fellow housemates and a good reminder for the rest of us not to judge a snake by its colour alone.
“Draco,” Sirius said as they approached the lifts. “I think I’d like a cup of tea. Would you mind joining me? We can just go up to the tearoom?”
“Oh, the baby,” she cooed at Smaug. “Give him to Auntie Slyvia, please.” She reached for the fox who let out a laughing bark as Slyvia picked him out of Draco’s arms and immediately began to rub his stomach. Draco smiled and went back to his tree, Slyvia following behind him.
“It is to the dragons who need you. And you’re always kind to people, stopping and smiling and saying something nice, even when you’re in a hurry.”
“Of course,” I say, smiling, bumping your shoulder just for something to do to ease the pressure on my yearning heart.
“Hermione. Seriously. Stop. It’s fine. And if he wanted to, he could have talked to me too, you know, any of those times we’ve bumped into each other. The fact that he hasn’t just goes to show that he’s not interested in being my friend. Besides…” Harry stopped himself, thinking better of it.
“Sure, he does.” Just then, a small, grey and black tabby cat emerged from Charlie’s bedroom and rubbed along Draco’s leg, trying to get at the food in his hand. Draco grinned and leaned over to pick it up, brushing past Harry to enter the kitchen area. “This is, uh, Mushu,” he made up on the spot, remembering a Muggle film he’d watched a few years back.
PS I think Snape disliked me mostly because of how much I reminded him of my dad. To say there was no love lost between them would be putting it mildly, and Snape surely had his reasons for hating my father’s guts. (And not only because the love of his life chose James instead of him.) Of course, I didn’t know any of that when we first met, but now that I do, and considering how much I’ve always resembled my father, I can understand why Snape barely tolerated the sight of me.
“All right.” Warily, Draco stepped across the room, searching Charlie’s features for any signs of the man having been hit with an overpowered Cheering Charm. He took the seat next to the bed and looked around for something to say. The silence stretched on for what felt like several minutes while Charlie just stared at Draco with a curious expression. Eventually, Draco’s self-consciousness got the best of him.
“Ahh,” Draco smirked. No wonder she was nervous. “The chai latte is for her?” The girl nodded expectantly. “Well then, may I suggest a caramel ginger cookie?” The oversized biscuits were sweet — something she obviously liked — but not too sweet. The added ginger usually balanced it out perfectly, plus it paired well with the ginger in the chai spice mix.
“As I thought. Nature videos it is.” He crossed over to Smaug’s room and put on the video, smiling as the hushed tones of David Attenborough’s narration filled the room. He took a moment to watch the intro of the video but was soon interrupted by a loud knock at the door.
“Drop it. Leave your checklist and expectations at home. You should be in discovery mode, not ticking off items from a list. You’re getting to know someone, someone real, not expecting them to be someone you’ve never even met.” Harry nods. When put like that, it does make sense. “Don’t worry if they’re ‘the one’ or not, don’t think that far ahead. Just enjoy the moment and appreciate the person in front of you for who they are.”
"Fuck. Merlin, Harry, you feel so good. I need you. I want you. I love you. You're so perfect, Harry. So fucking perfect for me."
Merlin, that was a long walk. And they had to make it twice? Draco sighed. “Yes, I know it. So where do you want me to meet you?”
Taking after his father’s gesture, Ron conjured another chair for his own wife, who sat carefully, shooting her husband a thankful smile and began talking quietly with Molly. Ron looked up and scanned the room, his eyes widening as they landed on Draco. “What’s
, Harry’s brain dutifully reels off — “you should always be honest. You should always strive to show yourself for who you are. Otherwise, you’re just setting yourself up for disappointment later. Don’t try and be perfect—”
“Yeah, I know.” Teddy’s murmur was all but inaudible in the lively square, and his eyes didn’t quite manage to meet Harry’s as Teddy bit his bottom lip and fiddled with his scarf. “I’m sorry.”
You stand in front of the mirror, one hanger in each hand, holding up one shirt and then the other in front of your bare chest. Your lower lip is caught between your teeth and your brow is furrowed, both innocent victims of your uncharacteristic uncertainty. You light up as you catch my reflection in the mirror, turning around with a bright smile.
“A friend,” said a low, deep voice, cradling Draco in its warm embrace. “Don’t worry, Draco. I’m not here to hurt you. I merely want to talk, if that’s all right with you.”
“Is it really so hard to imagine? A young boy who’s lived his whole life on a secluded estate with no one but his parents and their house-elves, leaving the only world he’s ever known to travel across the country to a place he’s never been, living with kids and grown-ups he’s never met, knowing he won’t be seeing his parents for several months? Believe me. At the time, boarding that train was about the scariest thing I’d ever done in my entire life.”
He straightens up in Draco’s lap, keeping the steady rhythm of his hips as he takes in Draco’s dishevelled state. His brow is furrowed and his jaw clenched, his nostrils flaring around a shuddering breath. If it weren’t for the pleased noises and the feel of Draco’s erection thrusting against his own, Harry’d almost think the man wasn’t enjoying himself. He is, though, he definitely is, and Harry is suddenly overwhelmed by the surge of emotions in his chest.
But to clear up your confusion, you should be grateful, of course. Or would you’ve preferred not getting any letter at all from me that week? I don’t know, seeing as you still seemed so offended by it a whole week later, maybe you would. Maybe you would’ve preferred it if I’d never replied to you at all, way back in January? Now that you know what it’s like to be quill pals with me, I bet you regret ever writing that initial letter to me in the first place, don’t you?. Well, tough luck, Malfoy. You’re stuck with me now. Me, and all my linguistic flaws.
Smaug started pawing at his pointy ears, the red fur that feathered from the sides fluttering as he groomed.
I’ve been trying to keep up with the conversations all night, trying to stay alert enough to put in my two Sickles’ worth every now and again, to appear as if nothing’s the matter. But you’re seated right next to me, making it impossible for me to focus on anything but your nearness. Our friends speak of Quidditch, and all I can think about is your knee mere inches from mine, your shoulder almost touching mine, your muscular forearm, bare after you rolled your sleeves up half an hour ago, close enough to brush against mine if I only moved my elbow the slightest bit. I can even sense your body heat caressing my skin, and for the umpteenth time tonight, I tear my eyes from where your elegant fingers move distractedly along the delicate stem of your wine glass.
He passed a snickering George, scowled at his overt mirth, and hurried back out into the night. The sounds of the party quickly died down behind him, and the sudden silence felt like a comforting hug as it encompassed him on his way back to the office building. It was soon broken, though, as Harry’s voice reached him, winded and pleading.
Evenings like these, with all their fineries, everyone enjoying themselves dancing, eating, drinking, laughing…these evenings always left Draco with a hollow feeling in his chest. Maybe because they reminded him of his childhood, of his parents — sparkling, laughing, joyful…and together. His mother would look up at his father and positively glow, and Draco would watch, sure that everyone in the room wished they were as happy as the Malfoys.
Draco’s shoulders started to relax at the sound of two sets of footsteps on the hardwood floor. A door clicked open and Draco let out a breath he hadn’t been aware of holding. He wasn’t safe yet, wouldn’t be until he was back on the Hogwarts Express, but for now, thanks to his mother, he could—
“Draco, relax. I was teasing.” Harry had pulled off his coat, tying it around his waist to cover his backside. “You know,” he continued, voice softer now, “generally I quite like it when men want to look at my naked arse. It was just a joke.”
“And you’re cute.” Harry waggled his eyebrows, making Draco shake his head in fond exasperation. “Any of those for me?”
Draco gave in and laughed through the tears in his throat. “No. Yes. All of you. I fell in love with all of you.” He gestured with his hand across the sea of red hair before him. “I went from being all alone, and then suddenly I had parents and siblings and nieces and nephews.” He met Sirius’ eyes behind the rest. “Even a godfather.”
Harry gestured with his shoulder and turned to head deeper into the premises. Draco definitely didn’t watch the movements of the man’s firm arse as he asked, “The
“I have to work,” Draco said stiffly, annoyed that Harry was at least a little bit correct in his censure. “I left Molly a note, but I need to get a few things done so I can visit St Mungo’s later.”
It was a lovely sound; that laugh. And Draco had been the one eliciting it. The notion spread a pleasant warmth through his body. He swallowed. “Anyway, I don’t mind doing it. I like the neat and orderly columns of it all. It soothes me, I suppose.”
A glimpse of black hair raised his hopes until he realised it wasn’t his cousin’s long, glossy tresses but Harry’s shorter, perpetually dishevelled curls. Harry stood talking with Ron and George, a hopeful smile spreading on his face as the brothers grinned and slapped him on the back. Draco’s stomach fluttered instinctively at the sight, and he stifled a groan. Apparently, his body seemed to have forgotten all about the disaster of last night’s events already. Much like Harry, Draco observed, who looked as cheerful as ever, like last night never happened in the first place.
Draco nodded, finding himself unable to respond to that. Throwing a fistful of Floo Powder into the fire, he mumbled his destination and departed.
“Malfoy, everything okay? Did you find the invoice?” Ernie Macmillan’s nasal tones came from the other side of Draco’s desk. Well, their shared desk, really. Draco didn’t work here full time, after all, he just volunteered his time.
He wasn’t sure what he had expected when he arrived on the fourth level of the Ministry of Magic and approached the Office of Civil Affairs where the ceremony would take place, but a room full of people was not it.
“You don’t have to,” Harry heard himself saying. “I quite like the thought of being marked by your mouth.”
Harry takes a sip. "He's cold and ready for us to be done so he can come up here and exploit our body heat."
Harry smirked and reached under the collar of his shirt to fish up a circular bronze pendant hanging from a long chain around his neck. “Have you ever seen one of these before?”
“You know…” Draco said, lifting his gaze to give Harry a mischievous hint of a smirk, “I was thinking…”
“I know. Anyway,” she drawled, sending him a quizzical look Draco did not appreciate. “You saved him and got him to St Mungo’s, but then Hannah Abbott heard you mumbling while you were in shock and thought you were engaged, so she announced it to everyone and now they’ve all but adopted you?”
Draco simply rolled his eyes at him and grabbed his quill, getting back to his neat and orderly columns.
“Is that what you do with your son too? Try to cheer him up by not letting him know he means something to you? Because it’s not working.”
I did go to Sunday brunch. Just as you said, it was the right thing to do. But Merlin, it was weird. Don’t get me wrong; it was all perfectly nice and no one broke down crying, just… It just felt like everyone was walking on eggshells, you know, like we all tried too hard. As if forced smiles and strained laughter could ever hide the crushing sadness filling up every inch of that house. By the end of the evening, I was so tense I couldn’t wait to get back to Scotland, and once I did, it took me two hours on my broom before I was anywhere near ready to go to sleep.
Draco didn’t wait for Harry to follow as he went in search of his friends. He probably had better things to do than hang around with Draco all night anyway. Unfortunately. As predicted, Draco found Pansy and Ernie close to the bar, surrounded by a handful of other people Draco knew through his work for the foundation. “Pans!”
It all feels smaller now than it used to and maybe that shouldn’t surprise me; it’s been almost two decades since I was last here, after all, a young boy eager to explore everything the world had to offer. Merlin, two decades. Where did the time go? And why haven’t I come back until now?
Molly looked satisfied at winning a point and turned back to Draco, her face melting into a soft smile. “Draco, dear, what drew you to our Charlie?”
“I don’t mind if you don’t.” His cocky grin catches me off guard; his reaction so far from the ones I usually get that it takes me a moment to gather my wits.
“You know I’d never miss your big day, your triumphant return”— Harry winked and Draco rolled his eyes —”and believe it or not, my darling; as long as you’re here, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.”
“I see a man walking blindly into a whole new, unfamiliar world, armed with nothing but determination and pure survival instinct. I see a man open to reevaluating his beliefs, to befriend the people he was once taught to despise and learn how to live among them, as one of them. I see a man who managed to navigate a society he up 'til then knew nothing about, making a new life for himself, a home, a profession, a future — against all odds. I can’t even imagine the amount of courage it must have taken to do what you did.”
Blinking his eyes open, he had a moment to wonder about his state of undress and the unusual clammy heat before he noticed the… — Harry frowned — …the weight of an arm thrown around his waist?
"So, we're decided then? Hogsmeade," Harry said, excited at the plans they'd been making finally solidifying.
"He's really eager to get some changes through the Ministry, and he thinks you'd be brilliant at it."
Draco groaned and turned to lie on his side again, getting his legs tangled in his sheets, again. Merlin. Never had this bed felt so uncomfortable. It was simply impossible to find a position that didn’t make his body squirm. Not that he really wanted to fall asleep. If he did, next thing he knew, it’d be morning, and that meant…
"Not yet," Draco says, capturing Harry's mouth with his again and taking away what is left of Harry's breath. His unconcealed hunger is intoxicating as he greedily laps up every moan and whimper escaping Harry's throat, kissing Harry like he'd never need air again. He pulls back after a moment, panting as he lets his forehead drop to Harry's. "You're still too tight. I don't want to hurt you."
“Honestly,” Draco said slowly, still feeling a bit off-kilter by Harry’s admission, “I didn’t think I’d see you either. None of you, I mean. Any magic folk. Or, at least I hoped I wouldn’t.”
With only a few days to go before Christmas, Diagon Alley was just as crammed as Harry had feared it might be. He rarely ventured into the heart of Wizarding London anymore, and when he eventually did, he always planned to avoid the peak hours to evade the crowds as much as possible. Not that he didn’t like people, per se, it was just… Too many at once had a tendency to hinder him from living his life with any semblance of normalcy. And if there was anything he craved after the war, it was normalcy.
“Nope. Too late.” Sirius backed away, spreading his arms as he exited the room. “See you tomorrow, little cousin!”
He took a deep breath, letting the cold air fill his lungs and willing it to improve his spirits. He did enjoy the fresh, crisp mountain air, so far from London’s stale smog. Maybe what he needed was a walk to clear his head? He could remind himself of what he had, and perhaps, recentre himself a bit.
“Well, I never heard of such nonsense,” the wizard gasped. “Mildred and I will certainly be making a donation on top of whatever we purchase tonight at the auction.” He held out his hand for Draco to shake. “Thank you for helping the children, young man.”
“Harry?” Draco’s whisper is so quiet Harry almost doesn’t hear it from all the blood rushing through his ears. A featherlight kiss grazes Harry’s temple, followed by others. His jawline, the sensitive spot under his ear, along his throat, the throbbing vein next to his collarbone. Draco’s gentle touch is almost unbearable. How is Harry supposed to resist this when all he wants is to give in, to give Draco everything? He’s been wanting this for so long, hoping and dreaming for Draco to show any sign of feeling the same way Harry does. The fact that he hasn’t is the only thing holding Harry back now.
Luna reached out and patted his hand. “It’s okay, Harry. You’ll figure it out soon enough. I have faith in you.”
“Merlin, I miss them so much.” The dog let out a low whine and dropped its chin onto Draco’s knee. Draco smiled down at it and stroked his palm over the silky soft fur on its head. “All of them.”
“Oh, Gods,” Draco moans, and Harry stops himself from burying his face in the feathers like he wants to, eager to smell them up close, to feel them caress his face.
.” Draco winks and takes a sip of his sparkling water. “As in, show interest in what your date is telling you, listen, ask questions, make eye contact, don’t glance at your watch, and do throw in a compliment or two when you see fit.”
“Well, you know me,” Harry eventually offered, shrugging sheepishly, “theory’s not really my thing. Words on paper don’t do it for me, I— I’ve always learnt best from a more…hands-on approach.”
Love bites. So many love bites. It practically looked like he’d been mauled by a wild beast. He probably should have been appalled by the sight, but for some reason, Harry found that he wasn’t.
"Harry!" several voices echoed as he and Draco stepped into the chaos. Everyone was there, even George who was looking better than Harry had seen him in ages.
Draco sighed in relief. He would be forever grateful to his mother for taking all that time teaching him Occlumency the summer after Fourth Year, but Bellatrix was said to be a talented Legilimens, one of the best even. If she decided to read him, Draco had no idea how long he’d be able to resist her mental onslaught.
Oh, just one more thing. The other day, as I was perusing the study, I found this pot of ink that I suspect might be similar to the one you use. What did you call it again? Ancestry ink? Anyway, it’s black instead of your dark green, but it shimmers just as yours does, and when I tried to write with it, it just disappeared from the page. I remember you saying something about it being an identification thing, that only family members could use it, right? So I’m guessing it must be the Blacks’ ink? Makes me wonder if my family ever had this kind of ink too, and what colour it would have been.
Harry swallowed, powerless against the flush rising on his cheeks. “Y-yeah, I know. He told me… I’m…”
. I don’t get it. What could possibly be so important that it can’t wait until tomorrow? You’ve been staying at his place the entire week for Circe’s sake; surely you must’ve had time to talk your hearts out during all that time. Unless you were too preoccupied doing oth—
Even after fifteen years, Draco was still humbled by the effect something as simple as a cup of tea could have on this man. It was as if Harry never would be able to get used to the fact that someone would want to care for him, to love him the way he deserved to be loved. It was only one of the many reasons Draco still wasn’t able to think about the Dursleys without wanting to punch something, but also one of the
Harry takes him to The Golden Cauldron; because sometimes it’s actually warranted to use your fame to get ahead in life, like when you want to take your boyfriend to the most exclusive restaurant in wizarding Britain on Valentine’s Day.
Ernie was the actual manager, though, and more than half of this mess was his fault, so Draco shot him a glare, hoping to hide his rising embarrassment over his momentary lapse of attention. “How do you expect me to find
“Thirty per cent of students that enter Hogwarts each year are using substandard wands or had monetary difficulties obtaining one.”
Harry let out a little huff and began picking up the clothes lying around the room, carrying them to the laundry hamper. Back in the kitchen, Draco cast a spell to get the dishes washing, then noticed a putrid smell coming from the small cooling cupboard. He opened it and groaned. There were nearly fifteen containers of Indian takeaway, all in varying states of decay. The man hadn’t even bothered to cast decent Preservation Charms on his leftovers. How long had they been here?
Oliver Wood, Captain of the Wimbourne Wasps, strode into the room looking just as windswept and handsome as he did on the covers of Quidditch Weekly. He glanced at Draco, who was already standing up and gathering his things.
The common room erupted in cheers at Seamus’s proposition. Apparently, Harry wasn’t the only one in need of a study break.
“I know. I know, I just…” Potter reached out and pushed a lock of hair from Draco’s face, hand lingering as fingertips traced the side of Draco’s face. Draco was vaguely aware of how red-rimmed and puffy his eyes must be, how flushed and blotchy his skin must be, but Potter didn’t seem to notice. Instead, he kept his eyes on Draco’s as he brushed the pad of his thumb over Draco’s cheekbone, cupped his jaw, and… leaned in.
No, Potter had lied. And yet, despite the bitter truth of reality, despite all evidence to the contrary, something within Draco refused to let go of the notion that what Potter had said could… could have been the truth. That in some parallel universe, they actually could have been friends. A possible future that Draco had somehow managed to obliterate somewhere along the road.
The intervening years since Draco had least seen Harry Potter in person had treated the man well. He was taller now, maybe an inch taller than Draco, but not quite six feet. His body had filled out slightly as well, his lean frame healthy and lithe, and his shoulders broad. He leaned against the doorframe, his arms crossed casually before him, but the expression on his face made Draco nervous: scrutiny.
you supposed to say to an unconscious man? To an unconscious man who you happened to have a major crush on? Charlie looked so peaceful like this, as if he were only sleeping. As if his clear blue eyes might flutter open at any second. Around them, the spells continued to beep quietly, urging Draco to break the awkward silence.
I’m sorry if my last letter made it sound like I’m walking around here all day missing you. I’m definitely not. More like all the memories of you insisting on creeping up on me and getting on my nerves at every opportunity. Much like you yourself did when you were still around. Of course you want to know which places make me think of you, you self-centred twat. Well, honestly, after spending six years with you in this castle, I’m not sure there’s any place around here that doesn’t hold a memory or two that involves you in one way or another. (And don’t even try to tell me the reverse doesn’t hold true for you too!)
Harry watched Draco sit down at the Slytherin table, Zabini and Davis taking the vacant seats on either side of him. They didn’t talk to anyone else, just ate their breakfast while speaking quietly to one another over eggs, toast, and steaming cups of tea.
Draco’s gaze dropped to the floor, noticing Harry’s bare feet and taking it as a sign to toe off his own shoes. As he did, he gestured at the door behind him. “How did you…?”
“Just need to take Charlie’s things back to his cottage,” Draco said, already on his way out the door. “Don’t mind me.”
The familiar voice, deep and delicious, poured down Draco’s spine like melted chocolate, pooling hot and sweet in his groin.
Oh, I almost forgot. Luna says hi, and, ‘Of course, Draco. Anytime,” and, “Don’t let the wrackspurts get to you.’ She’s been staying here for a few days while her dad is out of the country, supposedly to be closer to work, but I suspect she just doesn’t want to be left alone in their house. She told me what you did for her and the others that last week, after you got home and before we rescued them. That was really sweet and considerate of you. Not to mention, courageous, considering what could have happened had Bellatrix or any of the others ever found out. It seems Lucy will never cease to impress me; maybe you should let him out to play more often?
He waggled his eyebrows, and Draco groaned. “Oh, Merlin.” He wondered if Charlie had freckles on his cock.
They all filed out of the hospital room after the Healer left, the atmosphere between them lightened further by his general assurances that Charlie was improving steadily and was just unconscious as his body replenished his magic. Draco trailed behind, trying to figure out what to do. It was only a matter of time until Charlie woke up. He needed a solution.
George stilled, and Draco watched his eyes widen a fraction just before the man shook his head slightly and huffed a laugh. “Merlin, Draco, I never thought I’d see the day that ol’ Charlie decided to get married. And to see him shack up with you, well, it does a jokester’s heart good. It reminds me that humour does exist in this world.” Draco took it in the spirit it was intended — it would’ve been hard not to, considering the ridiculous grin that accompanied it — but he didn’t miss Ernie’s sharp intake of breath.
I’m not entirely sure how to feel about it, to be honest. A part of me is genuinely happy for him. He’s always looked up to his older brothers, and even though they’ve always teased and taunted him, I also know they all love each other very much. With Fred gone, I reckon it’ll be good for both of them to have each other close, especially for George. Not that Ron could ever replace Fred, but because having Ron by his side will hopefully make him feel less abandoned and alone.
Draco looked up at her, incredulous. “But this has nothing to do with him, other than he’s part of the family? I mean, this is about Charlie.”
“Harry.” Charlie gave him a wry smile. “I distinctly remember you telling me over the summer just how much you wanted to close the book on the war. How you wanted a fresh start, a blank page.”
“Nngh,” Draco offers and Harry grins, pleased to finally have found a way to render Draco incoherent.
“No, I can do this.” Draco stepped back and gave her a little smile. “I just hope they won’t all hate me afterwards. It was one thing before I knew them, back during and after the war, you know? But now?”
“Yes.” It was time. Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco beat him to it. “Here. Why don’t you have a look at it?”
Draco thrusts his hips, clearly done with Harry’s passive ogling. The motion causes their hard cocks to brush against each other, and even through several layers of fabric, the sensation is enough to make Harry dizzy.
Draco smiled and pointed to the northern sky. “Over there. Do you see Ursa Minor? It sort of does a little hump over the Little Dipper and scoops up towards Vega.”
Draco stared down at his phone, heart fluttering furiously in his throat. What the hell was he doing? What was he thinking? He’d known from the start — ever since this blast from the past barged into his new, blissfully magic-free life — that this could never end well for him. Nothing involving this bloke ever had. He’d known he had better stay as far away as possible from those captivating emerald eyes. He’d known. And yet, here he was, texting the—
“Fuck…” Harry moaned again as his palms moved over the soft, thin fabric of Draco’s vest, detecting well-defined muscle underneath. “I want… I need…”
Harry reaches down and picks up his now oddly-shaped companion while Draco summons their clothing from the top of the tower. Harry pulls on his hoodie and returns the snake to his pouch.
Draco stops again and Harry's skin tingles as feathers begin to caress the contours of his face, trailing whiffs of caramel and citrus in their wake.
“Draco…” Harry whimpered. Because, apparently, whimpering was his thing now. He probably would have felt embarrassed about it, had it not been for the effect it seemed to have on Draco.
They approached the treeline, and the Security Shed finally came into view. “This is it. Did they give you the key?”
Because Harry Potter wasn’t dead. He was moving, for Salazar’s sake, and no one but Draco seemed to notice. They were all too preoccupied with the imminent arrival of reinforcements — whose, Draco had no idea — to witness Potter rise like a Phoenix from the ashes and… disappear.
Two weeks ago, he would have been spending the evening with Pansy at some restaurant, or he’d be hosting some charity event for the homeless. He’d come home to his fox, tidy up the flat, then settle into bed with a good book. It was predictable, as predictable as the sounds of Slyvia’s grooming routines, and there used to be comfort in that.
“I’m really sorry about what happened, Draco,” she said after making herself comfortable on the sofa with a heap of cuddle-greedy Smaug in her lap. “Your friend Pansy came to see my show last night and told me all about it. I have to admit I’m a bit confused.”
Draco stepped through the Floo on Saturday morning and breezed right into Pansy’s open office. Her assistant was gone for the weekend, but Draco knew he’d find his best friend at her desk. It was only another week until the Wands for Wixen event, and they both had too much to do to completely blow off the entire weekend.
Believe it or not, I actually didn’t intend to be ‘cryptic’ about the creator behind the Sectumsempra curse. And I assure you there’s no need to start preparing for a murder mission as the poor man is already dead. Well, even if he wasn’t, I’m still quite sure you wouldn’t want to kill him, no matter how many wicked curses he managed to create in his life. Because I know how much you liked him, how much he liked you. I’m sorry, but there’s really no easy way to tell you this. The curse was Snape’s.
Draco looked down at the wadded parchment in his hand, the words ‘Malfoy’ and ‘Charles’ peeking out through the folds. “Uh, yes. I messed this one up, though, obviously.”
Malfoy chuckles. “Not quite, but let me ask you this. When you go on a date, do you bring a mental checklist? A list of traits and characteristics you’re looking for in a future partner?”
And wasn’t that the problem? Because as Charlie scanned the room with a pleased smile, greeting each of his family members in turn, his eyes finally landed on Draco. He froze, frowned, and Draco’s heart pounded.
"Probably a good idea for my first time doing this," Harry chuckles against Draco's heated skin. "I wouldn't want you to drop me."
“Okay.” Harry manages to keep his reply level, even while it threatens to rise in the end and morph into a question. Something’s up, he knows it is, but he won’t pry. Draco will tell him when he’s ready. He always does. “Tea after?”
Not that he was in any way turned on by seeing Draco as a wrinkled oldie — truly, he wasn’t — it was just… Harry just loved the idea of an old Draco looking so happy and content with his life. He hoped the man would one day, many years from now, look like that for real. Most of all, Harry wished he’d be the one to be there by Draco’s side making it happen.
“Coming right up,” Draco chirped, high on rush hour adrenaline and far too much espresso. He seldom took advantage of his easy access to decent coffee, but he certainly wasn’t a morning person, even on the best of days, and having to force himself out of bed at silly o’clock after barely sleeping a wink… Well, let’s just say that, sometimes, a perfect shot of espresso really was the only remedy.
“Do you usually deal with the difficult business connections?” Draco asked as he moved in the proffered direction, the curiosity beating out the polite disinterest that was his default.
“He didn’t do anything,” Draco was quick to interrupt before any one of them could direct any ire at the man. “It was me. It was all me.”
“Reasonable? Why the fuck would that seem reasonable? Why? Because I’m a Malfoy? Because there’s no way Charlie Weasley would ever want to marry an ex-Death Eater like me unless I was knocked up?”
He prayed Harry didn’t notice the slight tremble in his hand as he brought the glass to his lips. His mouth felt parched, his throat sore, and the sip of wine did nothing to remedy that. Harry’s voice was soft and warm as he spoke, a comforting blanket draping over Draco’s shoulders.
“Pansy’s Pantry,” he said clearly, then stepped through the green flames and into Pansy’s clean, crisp outer-office at the Park Foundation headquarters.
Draco froze and steadfastly kept his eyes on her, refusing to even glance Harry’s way. “Uh, well, I mean, I don’t really know Harry’s type or anything.”
“Yeah.” Harry glanced at him through those long, inky lashes and fuck if his cheeks weren’t turning a darker shade of pink. “Even got so far as to begin composing a letter. But the words failed me, and then the gossip started, about you being missing. I didn’t believe it at first — you know how the rumour mill that is The Daily Prophet works — but when week after week went by without a single sighting of you, speculations deviating from implausible to plain ridiculous, I—” He shrugged. “I thought I’d never see you again.”
“Woah, aren’t you a sweet-talker?” Harry crooned. His glorious fingers were back on Draco’s chest, trailing patterns across his pecs, and Draco could hear the shit-eating grin even as he refused to look Harry’s way. “Now, tell me, Draco, are you wheedling for a post-sex cuddle, or are you already trying to butter me up for round two?”
Draco draws back — with his breath and his warmth and his stupid, heady scent. Harry shivers at the loss, trying but failing to clear his muddled brain.
“Yes,” the man chuckled. “I don’t know how I’ll survive without him, but I wouldn’t let him miss it for the world. Starting Hogwarts is still one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.”
“Here, let me…” Draco flicked his wand and cast a succession of Concealment Charms over the bruises, making them fade from view. “I can get you a Healing salve later, but—”
?” In Draco’s imagination, impossibly green eyes widened almost comically behind their signature round glasses.
“So fucking gorgeous…” he mumbled, mostly to himself, and Harry wanted to hit him on the head saying
Now, don’t let this get to your head. It’s already bigger than could ever be healthy, and I’d hate for it to explode one day when you least expect it. (With my usual luck, it’d probably happen on a day when I’m on call too, so I’d be appointed your very own clean-up crew…)
Draco trails off, but Harry doesn’t need to hear the end of that sentence. He remembers it all too clearly.
nocturne. I finally got to hear it last weekend when Andromeda played it for me, and then she helped me record it magically into some kind of glass sphere so I could take it home with me. It’s
Harry reached behind Draco to close the door, leaning in close enough for their shoulders to brush against each other in the cramped space that was Harry’s hallway. Draco made an effort to continue breathing like a normal person for once, only to instantly regret it. Harry’s scent rushed through him like a tidal wave, invading every cell in his body, making him tremble all over. Merlin, what was wrong with him? He hadn’t been here even a minute, and Draco could already feel the heat rise up his neck, reddening his cursed Malfoy skin. For being an evening of two ex-enemies-turned-not-really-friends-yet-but-maybe-someday just hanging out studying, this felt an awful lot like a date. Not that Draco had been on many of those in his life so far. Maybe he was wrong; maybe he was just being silly.
Teddy’s hand slipped from his grip, and Harry blinked back to reality just in time to watch him run off towards the scene.
Belatedly, Draco took a seat in the chair across from Harry. He only hesitated for a second before sliding one of the cups over the tabletop towards his boyfriend. Merlin, if only his heart could stop hammering so furiously… “H-here you go, love. One large coffee, black as midnight and sweet as treacle tart.”
“That’s terrible,” Mrs Champon gasped, and her husband put his arm around her. “I can’t imagine. Those poor children.”
“Oh, I feel you.” Harry said it with such candour Draco had to look at him then, disbelief quirking his eyebrow.
“…your hero is gone…” “…the battle is won…” “…kneel before me…” The Dark Lord’s voice continued unperturbed. As if the world hadn’t just ended. As if all hope wasn’t suddenly lost.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry said, forcing himself to look straight into Draco’s beautiful eyes. He only lasted for a short moment, though hopefully long enough to get his earnestness across, before he had to avert his gaze. The abandoned cups on the coffee table provided a momentary reprieve, and Harry gratefully went over to gather them as he continued. “And you enjoyed it too. Don’t even try to deny it.”
Draco hated that he was so weak, letting Potter lead him on like that. Hated Potter for giving him hope, for making him want. He hated Potter for making him dream. Hated him.
Harry took a step closer, getting into Draco’s personal space. Draco’s heart skipped a beat as Harry’s scent wafted over him, warm and male and mouth-watering, but he didn’t step back.
Something soft and warm and refreshing runs along the top of Harry's thigh. "I'm going to take care of you. I'm cleaning you up, and then, if you want, I thought I might draw us a bath in that delightfully large tub."
“I’m taken.” Merlin knows I’m not, but since we started coming here, I’ve found it to be the easiest way to get rid of the likes of him; the ones who decide to try their luck with the lonely, silent man by the bar.
Perhaps he was most confused by Sirius’ silence. The man had known the truth all along, had encouraged the lie and sworn he would help fix the situation, but where was he now? Why had he abandoned Draco?
Harry can barely comprehend any more than that. Wings. Everything else — Draco standing bare-chested in the cold night air; his pale skin glowing in the moonlight, literally glowing — is all secondary.
Cynthia had seemed really into him when they met a few weeks ago at Seamus and Dean’s New Year’s party. And yet, it only took her three dates for the usual ‘I’m sorry, Harry, I don’t think we should see each other anymore,’ to escape her lips.
Harry nodded and stepped back down off the porch and into the night, heading back towards the offices. “Be careful. It’s icy,” he muttered to Draco and waited on him to follow. Draco did, breathing through the dull ache the memories had brought on, ready to put them back into the far corner of his mind where they belonged. As they began to walk, though, Harry picked the conversation back up. “I suppose you can go now that you have Charlie, then.” His voice sounded strained. “To Florence, that is.”
“It’s Christmas Day,” Draco said smugly, “and I’m Santa Claus.” He bumped the tip of his nose gently against Harry’s before placing a soft kiss on his lips. “If you’ve been a good boy, your wish is my command.”
But here you are, soaked by the pouring rain, coatless and shivering in the chilly February night. My heart clenches at the sight, and your greeting — not “Sorry to bother you,” or “Can I come in?” or even a “Hi,” but simply, “
For those of you following this story in real-time: This week, I'm crazy excited to finally be able to reveal the results of a secret collab I've been working on for this fic for over a month now 🥳🎉✨
“So will you,” Harry hastened to assure him. “I saw you with the kids last week. They all adored you.”
. The intensity of Draco’s gaze is making Harry dizzy and now the man expects him to find words? Construct sentences? Answer questions?
“Really?” I turn to look at you fully, meeting your silver-grey eyes. They hold all the proof I need to know you’re telling the truth, that you’ve made up your mind, that you’re going to see this through whatever may come. “That’s—”
What felt like hours later, but according to Hannah Abbott was only forty-five minutes — the max amount of time the family had been allowed to stay for visiting — everybody filed out of Charlie’s room.
Draco took in the face he’d once known so well. The famous scar was mostly faded, though still cut through that dark eyebrow in the same way it always had. He’d lost the look of childhood, as was to be expected in his late twenties; his jaw was well-defined, dark from an extended five o’clock shadow, and his cheekbones prominent. As always, though, his eyes drew the most attention, and now more than ever. No longer hidden behind glasses, the emerald green positively glowed in the low firelight from the hearth.
Harry follows Draco’s gaze, suddenly wondering the same. “No idea.” On the screen, some weird-looking insect is climbing a long blade of grass, making it buckle under its weight. “Want to join me?”
Apparently, this is how his life is going to be from now on, then, with the two of them ganging up on him at every opportunity. Strangely enough, the thought doesn’t annoy Harry like it probably should have. Rather, it ignites a warm feeling of affection in his chest.
needed to change his sheets a few times after waking up, so he figured it only made sense that he smelled like “mating” to his snake.
Harry thanked the cold weather for excusing his blush when first Draco and then Teddy turned to look at him. They seemed to be talking about him, Harry realised as Teddy gave him an enthusiastic wave. Warily, Harry extracted a hand from his pocket and waved back, only to feel his stomach lurch when Draco, too, lifted a glove-covered hand to wiggle his fingers at him with an amused smirk.
Draco moans when Harry settles in his lap, straddling him without ever breaking their scorching kiss. This new position is way better, because now Draco is right there, right in front of him, right under him, gripping Harry’s hips with both hands, thrusting up against him as if on pure instinct alone. Harry’s fingers get entangled in Draco’s long, damp locks, pulling his head back to expose that glorious neck for Harry’s questing mouth.
Because as it turns out, all it takes is a fucking date in a fucking calendar and suddenly I’m back where I was. And I haven’t been able to sleep all week. The sun is just now crawling up over the horizon and I’ve been out here for hours already, hoping to exhaust myself enough to fall into bed later even though I’m rather sure that’s not going to happen. My eyes are not too happy about being forced to chase the Snitch in the dark for hours on end, but I don’t know what else to do. Hermione wants me to go to Pomfrey for Dreamless Sleep, but I’m not all that sure that’d be a viable solution. I don’t want to end up with a potions addiction, and if I start taking it, I fear I’ll never be able to live without.
“Well, we can Floo to the Reserve, but then we’ll need to carry them to someplace called the ‘Security Shed’? Do you know it? Ron’s the one who set this all up when the order came in.”
The air shifted around him and Draco held his breath. He’d been antsy all day, apprehension crawling under his skin, unease stirring in his belly. Yet, when he felt the prickle at the nape of his neck now, he knew the sensation had nothing to do with his inner turmoil. No, this was something else. Someone was in his room, standing behind him, watching him.
PPS So you decided to let me help you with your Patronus Charm, then? Great! Sooo looking forward to finding out what form it will take. And good luck trying to teach me how to dance. I’m pretty sure I’m a hopeless case, but I wouldn’t mind watching you pop your cork trying.
I’m sorry to confirm that the War Memorial Ceremony turned out to be just as dreadful as I had anticipated. People, so many people, all dressed in black, mourning and sobbing while listening to droning speeches and depressing funeral music. I still don’t know why they all insisted on me being there. Frankly, if I’d had any say in the matter, I’d rather have been anywhere but.
He sighed and took a seat in the chair beside the bed, looking down at the burnt hand laying out on the sheet. Charlie already looked better than he had in the paddock, the skin beginning to heal. Draco cleared his throat as Hannah stepped out of the room.
Harry doesn’t need to be told twice. Whatever strange alternate universe he’s just entered, there’s no chance he’d ever pass up the opportunity to finally find out what Draco tastes like. Heat rushing through his veins, Harry closes the distance between them.
And Draco’s wand was safely tucked away in its box over in the corner by his trunk. Not that he’d be able to do much with it had it been in his hand, but still.
She nodded then opened her brown eyes, meeting his gaze and cocking her head to the side. She seemed to be considering him.
Harry’s eyes are drawn to the wings spread out on the floor behind the kneeling Draco, and Draco tenses, pulling them in closer against his body. Harry wants, no,
Harry swallowed down a sudden bout of arousal and groaned as he felt a flush rise on his cheeks. Draco snickered quietly and hugged him closer, leaning in to rest his chin on Harry’s shoulder. And that’s how Teddy found them as he turned around to check on the muffled noises behind him.
Hannah led Draco down the hallway to a private room. The lights were turned down low, and the hum of the monitoring spells echoed in the background. “He’s in a coma while his body and magic heal,” she said quietly, “but some believe comatose people can still hear subconsciously, so sit down, let him hear your voice.”
Draco stands on the ledge, the toes on his bare feet not even an inch from a deadly fall. With one step, he’d plummet into the night. But then, Harry realises, he wouldn’t fall.
Draco had come here to start over, to give himself a second chance at life after everything he’d been through in his teens. Two years ago, he’d broken ties with everything he once knew. He’d left the Wizarding world and all its inhabitants behind, exiting the front door of the Leaky Cauldron for the very first time. It had been scary, if not terrifying, to venture out into the great unknown like that. But he’d done it, and he’d made it. He now had a flat, small but cosy. He had a job, unglamorous but paying the rent. He even had friends. Well, mostly colleagues, really, and some neighbours, and the occasional hookup. But at least he called them by their first names — which was more than could be said about the people he used to hang around with in school.
Hermione says the sight of me apparently brings people hope. Now don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I don’t want people to feel hopeful — I really do — but do they really need an eyeful of me to be able to do that? If so, that might be the most depressing thing I’ve ever heard.
Harry shot her a pointed look and ran a hand through his hair, clearly frustrated. “Something isn’t right, Hermione. He’s obviously up to something.”
Can’t really see who’d be interested in marrying you, tho, but I’m sure there must be someone out there for you, just waiting to be swept off their feet by you’re unparalleled charm and scatting wit. At least
He picked up the bowl and started wandering the rest of the cottage. He passed a filthy bathroom with a toilet that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages. He couldn’t resist hitting it with a quick Scourgify as he continued on to the bedroom.
“I didn’t expect company…” Harry blurted a moment later when they’d eventually made it to his bedroom door. His hand fumbled blindly for the handle, left to its own devices while the rest of him refused to focus on anything but Draco.
lovely. And you were right, it is soothing. The perfect winding-down soundtrack after another crazy day of training. It seems no matter how many times I listen to it, I can’t get enough. And Teddy likes it too; brought him to sleep in no time when it was time for his nap. So, again, thank you (now that I truly know what I’m thanking you for).
When he returns two minutes later, he’s managed to collect himself somewhat, shrugging on his coat without much fuss and complementing it with a steel-blue scarf and black leather gloves.
“Right, well, enough of that. I’ll take your things home and hopefully, you’ll wake up tomorrow, and we can get this all cleared up.” He took a step closer to the door then hesitated, glancing back. “You’re a lucky man, Charlie Weasley. I hope you realise that.”
He had no idea how long he’d been sitting here like this, his bony arse on the cold stone floor, knees hugged close to his chest, rocking slowly back and forth while trying to block out the bedlam on the other side of the flimsy tapestry — his only shield against the rest of the world.
Draco hadn’t seen such gorgeous glassware in his life. Ever. Shelf after shelf of useful, everyday items like bowls, goblets, platters, and vases nearly took his breath away with their unique shapes and vibrant, eye-catching colours. What really drew Draco’s attention, though, was the sculpture.
Harry’s still not sure what made him agree to have that picture framed and placed on the mantle for everyone to see. Draco’s persuasive nature, most likely; Harry’s had a hard time denying the man anything as of late.
“It’s not that I don’t want them to be happy; of course, I do. It’s just…” Harry stares unseeingly at the remains of their shared dinner, a traditional Swiss cheese fondue Draco claimed he’d always wanted to try. “It’s hard, you know, to see them together and being reminded of my own loneliness…”
“Merlin, Potter, breathe,” Draco says, shaking his head in an exasperated ‘what-the-hell-have-I-gotten-myself-into’ manner. “You’re such a Gryffindor. Just have to rush into everything, don’t you?”
“I deal with most of the suppliers, actually,” Harry said from behind him. “That includes the difficult ones.”
Now, any self-respecting Slytherin would have run in the other direction. Draco reminded himself of this repeatedly over the hours that followed and, had it been any other circumstance, he probably would have, too. As it was, though, this was apparently the moment Draco decided to abandon any self-respect he might have still possessed and ran
The Minister smiled, his eyes bright with enjoyment. “I’m exceedingly well, thank you. I hear you’re the mastermind behind this entire event. Might I say, well done, sir. It’s very impressive.”
“Very well. Maybe another time.” Draco winked, silently commiserating with the man before turning to the silver-haired lady by his side. “And you, ma’am? How can I serve your tastebuds this fine autumn day?”
But let me start from the beginning, okay. So, remember how I told you Ginny was crushing on someone else? Well, I finally found out who it was; your dear old friend
Still, he leaned into her, grateful for her acceptance of the changes in his life. He'd been worried about Draco's reception in the Weasley family, but although there'd been some initial confusion and hesitation, they'd eventually greeted Harry's chosen mate with cordial politeness, if not eager delight.
Anyway, you wanted to know about school. It’s all right, I guess. Many new teachers, of course, after everything. McGonagall has done a great job recruiting them too, and she’s even managed to persuade Binns to retire (finally!). Feels strange without you here, though. You might have been a royal pain in the arse since day one, but… I guess Hogwarts just isn’t the same without your haughty sneer to get on my nerves.
Aww, there’s the prat we all love to hate. Phew, what a relief! You know, I was a bit concerned there for a while after reading your first letter, but I feel sooo much better now that I know you’re still you, and not some overly courteous impostor or mind-altered shadow of the good old Malfoy I once used to know.
“But of course, cutie cub. Anything for you.” Harry didn’t know why — maybe it was the sight of Draco’s tentative smile as he took a moment to glance Harry’s way before lifting up the next child on his lap — but as he drew back from their hug to catch his godson’s eye, he asked, “But why did you both turn and wave? Did you two talk about me?”
I hadn’t planned to, it just came out. Like, we were just getting ready to leave when someone, I don’t even remember who, declared they had a few phials of Sober-Up on offer. I naturally jumped at the chance, thinking I wouldn’t want to upset you with another hungover mess of a letter in the morning. (Yes, go figure. The reckless Gryffindor is
“Fuck,” Draco said as he came up for air, sounding dazed and awed and husky beyond measure. “Fuck,” he said again as he pushed a long, slender finger into Harry’s panting hole. “Fuck, Harry,” he breathed as he started fucking Harry with it, slowly, thoroughly. “Do you have any idea how sexy you are like this? Giving yourself to me so willingly, so eagerly? So open and pliant and utterly delectable.”
“No. You’re staying here, my little dragon. Fireworks and foxes don’t mix.” He dug a small bite of liver out of his refrigerator and held it out then ran a hand over Smaug’s head as he inhaled the treat. “An entire evening alone with Potter, huh?” Draco thought back to his eighth year at Hogwarts when he’d been hopelessly pining for the Gryffindor’s attention. “You’d better wish me luck.”
Not until you’ve left the flat for your date, cheerful and bloody gorgeous, leaving me here, a pathetic mess of a man curled up on the couch with no one but Ben and Jerry and Michael Aspel to keep me company throughout the evening.
“Some friend you are,” he grumbles, rising to his feet just as the timer beeps over by the counter. Thankful for the distraction, Harry draws his wand and spells the leaves out of their tea, sending them swirling in the air above their mugs. They look like autumn leaves trapped in a capricious whirlwind, reminding Harry of his own inner turmoil.
“Yes, but…” Draco closed his eyes and willed himself not to scream in frustration. “Not by accident, you blithering idiot. It takes months of potions and a fuck-ton of magic to make it happen, and even then, it’s rare because adoption is so much easier. Merlin, Potter. Why the hell would you think I’m pregnant?”
Draco paused and considered, until Smaug nudged his hand with his cool snout, urging him to continue the petting. Draco did, taking a sip of his tea with his other hand before nodding. “Yes, that about covers it.”
Without warning, a burst of red shot by him, mere inches from his left shoulder, hitting the back wall with a blinding crash.
No, it’s true. I honestly didn’t even know what our crest looked like — until just the other day when curiosity finally got the better of me. I don’t know what made me do it. Usually, just the thought of venturing inside the remains of my parents’ cottage is enough to turn my stomach. Odd that the first time I do, it’s in search of something as trivial as a pot of ink.
She stilled and studied him a moment; searching his face for Merlin knew what. Draco could see the wheels turning in her head.
“Harry,” Draco says softly, cupping Harry’s face with both hands and lifting his head, forcing Harry to look him straight in the eye. “I’ve wanted you for years.”
No, scratch that. He didn’t hate it, per se. It was still the same house he grew up in, after all, the place he’d loved so much as a kid, back when it still felt like home.
Draco laughed, feeling the man’s excitement fuel his own. “I’m looking forward to it. Do you need any help?”
“Temporary, short-term amnesia is not uncommon in cases of extreme magical trauma like the one Charlie’s endured,” the Healer recited. “His magic will likely heal him up in a few more days, but if that’s not the case for whatever reason, there are potions we can administer at that time to help him finish the process. The best thing you can do is to spend time with him and keep him comfortable.”
Draco took a breath, opened his mouth, and— His brain screeched to a halt. “What? You know I have to tell you something, or you know what I’m going to tell you?”
“I know, Uncle Harry.” Teddy looked up at him with an encouraging smile, his large, blue eyes filled with concern. “Don’t worry, I’ll be back before you know it.”
“And dragons, and war veterans, and the homeless. Yes.” Draco knew he sounded petty, but it was hardly his fault. He kept his gaze straight ahead, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes as he felt embarrassment heating his face.
Draco barely slept all night. He tossed and turned as random flashes from the previous days jumped out at him, small things that all seemed unrelated, but when put together, pushed him to question his choices.
“How fortunate,” Draco purred, his eager wet mouth never leaving Harry’s skin. “Would’ve hated to come all the way from France just to walk in on you with someone else…”
Harry looked guilty, his eyes shifting away and his shoulders hunching. “I dunno. Something like Malfoy Manor, I guess? This looks really comfortable, though.”
“What is?” Harry looks up to find Malfoy smiling gleefully at him as he places a fresh round of drinks on the table.
“Yes, Draco, to talk.” Draco swore he could hear a smile in those words. “I know you’re feeling worried about going to Hogwarts tomorrow, and I thought…”
He looks down at the feather in his hand and smells it again, letting out a subconscious hum of pleasure that catches him by surprise.
“It’s nothing like that,” Harry professed, even as he felt a flush rise on his cheeks. “I mean, it’s
The room let out a collective gasp, but Draco refused to look away from Arthur, eyes pleading for his understanding.
. The slight rise and fall with each flap of Draco's wings reminds Harry of the beauty and strength of the man in his arms.
Draco’s strong hands slide under the waistband of Harry’s joggers and boxer briefs, making Harry gasp as they grip his arse cheeks firmly and pulls him even closer. Draco’s palms are hot against Harry’s skin and the fingers dig into the flesh hard enough to bruise. Harry doesn’t mind. On the contrary, the thought of Draco marking him like this — claiming him — is hot. So fucking hot.
Draco wished he knew what she’d said to her friend to make such a fierce blush spread over the bloke’s cheeks. The notion that, whatever it was, it must have somehow been about him, set off a warm fluttery feeling in the pit of Draco’s stomach, a sparkling sensation that rose up his torso like bubbles in a champagne flute and soon threatened to burst out of his mouth in giggle form. Grinning, he turned back to the hopeful man by the counter.
As they approached the office building, Draco was laughing hysterically at Harry acting out story after story of Weasley antics. “So, Charlie was running from gnomes, his hands flailing from the firework,” Harry managed to get out, throwing his arms around in imitation.
“One flat white and two cappuccinos, please. And…” The redhead frowned at the cake display as if the baked goods were somehow trying to goad her into submission. She always did this, conducting an inner battle of instinct versus reason, seemingly counting calories and pennies before weighing the result against her current guilt tally. The outcome, Draco had soon learnt, was always the same. “…and that’ll be all.”
Sirius chuckled. “Perhaps, or so I’ve been told. Everything I’ve said is true, though. Your presence has brought every single one of us comfort. Everyone’s so pleased that Charlie’s found someone, and the fact that it’s you, well, it’s vastly amusing.”
Draco clenched his jaw and looked over to where Sirius was standing, an inscrutable look on his face.
Leaving Hogwarts was kind of bittersweet, though. It’s the first and only real home I’ve ever had so it’s going to take a while to get used to the fact that I’ll not be going back in the autumn. Sure, I’m welcome here at the Burrow, and I probably should start calling Grimmauld Place my home one of these days, but they’re not the same. Don’t think they ever will be.
Draco sighs and leans back, placing his head in Harry's lap. For all the world, he seems relaxed, but Harry notices the tension in Draco's shoulders. "I just have a lot more to prove with my scores than you guys do. And if word of my…condition…is made known—"
Eventually, it was time for young mister Finch-Fletchley to climb the steps. As he followed one of the elves to where Draco was seated next to the oversized Christmas tree, Harry squeezed his godson’s shoulder.
Also, Harry admitted to himself as he watched Draco greet his unsuspecting cousin, he wouldn’t have minded one last chance of being close to Draco before he left for France.
It won’t be easy, keeping these walls from falling down, but I promise I’ll succeed. I have to. For you. For us. For our friendship.
“I— I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Harry argued, stepping closer and getting into Draco’s space.
He wanted to roll his eyes, because for Merlin’s sake, of course, he’d changed. Hadn’t everyone? Who spent fifteen years being the same person they were as a schoolboy? Who emerged from a war the same as how they’d entered it? But then, maybe she was right. Maybe his upbringing was something he’d always have to fight against.
I haven’t talked to her about my issues with the house, though. She has enough worries as it is without me bothering her about this too, what with Teddy and the start of the new school year and everything that entails. Plus, one really should be able to handle one’s own home, right? Call me proud, but I kind of want to be able to manage this without external help if at all possible. (Well, apart from yours, of course. I’m quite sure I’d never be able to do this without your insightful advice.)
Harry frowns and bends down to pick one up. It’s larger than the others, nearly twice the length of his hand, and something encourages him to raise it to his nose. Caramel.
Draco usually made a show of teasing him about those wrinkles, pointing out his old age (even as Draco was, and always would be, eight weeks his elder). Secretly, though, Draco loved those wrinkles, maybe even more than the sprinkle of silver at his temples. They spoke of a full life seasoned with joy and laughter, a reality none of them would’ve even dared to anticipate twenty years before.
“Huh?” Harry frowned, seemingly thrown by the unexpected topic change. Draco couldn’t really blame him; he’d probably suffer from mental whiplash too, had the roles been reversed.
He’d dressed perfectly for the part he wanted to portray for the evening: elegant, academic wizard with ties to the Muggle world. It was like casting himself in a play. He’d carefully chosen a tailored pair of black trousers, a tight-fitting white dress shirt with a high-neck collar that he’d left unbuttoned with no tie. Over that, he’d layered two complementary waist-coats: one in a dark-taupe Prince of Wales check fabric, and one in rich, brown satin on top, both with matching onyx buttons. To complete the look, in place of a tie, he’d draped a silver chain with a fox-shaped pendant around his neck.
“I’d think he’d be here tonight,” Draco said quietly, hoping she wouldn’t detect the nervousness in his voice. Merlin, how would Potter react to Draco’s sudden presence in the family?
Draco proceeded to change his mind no less than ten times as he showered and dressed for the day. Staring at the soft glow of the fairy lights, he decided he needed to clear his mind. That could only mean one thing.
Harry looked genuinely curious now, and Draco guessed he really couldn’t blame him. They’d never talked about this before. Draco had made sure of that.
“Huh?” Draco blinked, dumbfounded, before realising Harry was referring to the drinks he apparently still clutched in his hands. “Oh. Y-yeah, I—”
“I do.” Harry sighs and leans down to rest his forehead against Draco’s, lowering his gaze, no longer able to meet Draco’s questioning eyes. “Merlin, help me, but I do.”
I found the matching wax and seal stamp as well (as you may have noticed already), all neatly tucked away in a polished wooden case with ornate inlays and purple velvet lining. Considering where I found it, pushed to the back of the bottommost desk drawer, I’m guessing my parents didn’t use it all that often, most likely preferring the regular muggle bic pens they seem to have kept close at hand in a tatty
“Er,” I say — oh, so eloquently — trying my level best not to acknowledge the sinewy thighs screaming for attention or the glimpses of black peeking out behind the garments as you move them right to left, left to right. “The blue one?”
Come to think of it, you probably know it, don’t you? Grimmauld Place? It’s the Black’s ancestral home, after all, so it’d only make sense if you did. Well, it’s mine now, crazy as it sounds; Sirius left it to me in his will. I’m just not sure I’m ready to go over there yet. You see, I spent a lot of time in that house during the war (since it used to be the Order’s head-quarters) and I never liked the place much to start with — all old and dingy, reeking with dark magic and self-righteous contempt. And now it’s been abandoned for so long, almost two years, I fear it will feel even more depressing and inhospitable than it ever did before.
“You…? But…” Draco drew back, not much, but far enough for Harry to see the concern in his dark eyes. “I thought you…”
No, hateful avengers and avid fans might not be the same thing, not by a long shot, but even so… Had Harry really experienced the same yearning for anonymity as Draco had? The same need to escape the world they once used to be such an important part of? He was here, after all, living among the Muggles the same way Draco did… Maybe Draco wasn’t the only wizard who had migrated into the non-magical world in search of a new start? Maybe they had more in common than he’d first thought.
PS And fuck off, Malfoy. Your handwriting looks as neat and perfect as it ever has. I bet you just added that PS for a chance to criticise my ‘chicken scratches’. If you must know, I’ve never held a quill until I came to Hogwarts at age 11, and you have no idea how much harder it is to write with a quill than a regular muggle pen.
Narcissa sounded certain, but Draco knew she was lying. Because he was a coward, wasn’t he? Hiding here in the depths of the library instead of going over there, confronting his aunt and defending his mother and his own honour. Careful not to make a sound, Draco raised his hands close to his waist, the left still clutching the coin while the right slowly reached for the wand hidden in his left sleeve. He had no idea what he’d do once he held it, but he had to do something, right?
Everyone else got back yesterday, and it already feels like these last two weeks never happened. Except something’s up with Ron, and I can’t figure out what it is. It’s not like he’s avoiding me or anything, he still talks and jokes like always, but it’s forced somehow, like he’s hiding something. It’s probably nothing. He’s been with his grieving family for two weeks, after all, so it wouldn’t be strange if he came back a little rattled, would it? And maybe it’s just the sorrow he’s trying to hide, but I still can’t shake the feeling there’s something else he’s not telling me.
Which is why Harry opens his front door to greet Malfoy at two o’clock the following day, ready to take the Erumpent by its horn.
“She doesn’t have to find out,” he drawls, cocking a challenging eyebrow. “After all, you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t—”
As Harry opened his eyes and returned to the present, it was just in time to see Teddy being lowered to the ground by Draco’s strong, secure arms.
Each ornament Draco lifted off the tree, he wrapped carefully and placed back in the box. These decorations had belonged to his mother, and some of them they’d purchased together in their travels. It was the main reason Draco loved decorating for the holidays so much; it was like having his mother back for just a little while every year.
“I love it.” Draco glanced back at the thoughtful gift before returning his eyes to Harry. “Thank you.”
“Oh, he’s fine.” Harry grinned behind the rim of his cup. “It’s mostly adrenaline, I think. Not every day you start a whole new era of your life.”
Draco smiled and slipped a furtive hand into his pocket. The band of metal was cool to the touch as he wrapped his fingers around it and settled in for a nerve-wracking wait.
Molly looked surprised, but her smile grew easier as she took the gift from Draco. "You didn't need to do this, but thank you."
Parkinson doesn’t seem to agree with him. Has she ever? She just laughs off Ron’s arguments and shakes her head, starting in on her own conversion crusade as soon as Ron pauses to gulp down the rest of his pint. Around them, Seamus, Dean, Zabini, and Bulstrode all fight for a chance to get their say in the matter — whatever it is they’re arguing about — and beyond them, at the other end of our long table, Hermione, Nott, Daphne, and Ginny are immersed in a deep, albeit calmer, discussion of their own.
“It felt really damned good to be part of a family again. I haven’t had that in a long time, and even when I did, it wasn’t like
Just one thing, though. I get that your cocky confidence must have taken a nosedive this past year, but seriously? A flobberworm? You know your patronus is supposed to reflect your innermost personality, right? And you may be a lot of things, Malfoy, but you’re certainly not a flobberworm so there’s no need to worry about that. Surely you must have some good memories we could try. It doesn’t have to be a recent one, as long as it’s happy. And if it turns out you don’t have any that are strong enough, well, I guess we’ll just have to make some new ones for you to use, right? Because I can’t wait to find out what form your patronus will take. And don’t even try telling me you’re not curious to know too.
No. Although all parts of the man he loves, they aren't what obliterates any final barriers Harry may have held around his heart. What finally does it is the little sobs that escape Draco's lips, the soft moans, the litany of words spilling from Draco's now unfiltered mouth.
When October rolled around, and Harry’s trips to the Owlery increased, he began to dream about feathers. Unsurprisingly — there were feathers strewn everywhere up here. But unlike regular owl feathers, the feathers in his dreams were large and soft, gorgeous, almost shimmering. And they begged Harry to reach out and stroke them, to run his fingertips along their shafts.
Harry nods. “So what does this mean? I mean...” He leans down to pick up his cloak, then extends his arm for Orion to climb and wrap around. “ For us? Do we tell everyone we’re together? Does anyone know you’re Veela? Can I tell Ron and Hermione? What—”
“She was right,” Draco told the dog. “I’m a right miserable, old sod. People will come to this event, ready to spend lots of money to help students all afford new wands and books before going off to Hogwarts, and I’ll be there, scaring them all away with my brooding.”
Smaug began yipping and running towards the door about twenty seconds before a knock came, pulling Draco from his thoughts. By the lack of heels clacking on his ceiling, he knew who it was.
