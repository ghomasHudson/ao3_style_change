“Harry!” Teddy giggles when Harry swoops him up. Remus gives him a grateful smile, glad to have his ankles back.
“Can you describe it for me? It’d be easier if we knew what we’re making.”
“Draco used to pull on my hair when he was little. I’m quite used to it.” Sirius hoped his look conveyed,
“You give me too much credit babe, after all, I am only a dog.”
“I find the best way to get rid of your Wrackspurts is to face them head-on. They’re quite nice once you get to know them.” Luna had advised sagely.
The boy’s face lit up when he saw the few sandwiches and bottles of water packed in there. “Thank you.” He smiled, the colour already returning to his cheeks. Then, he sneezed.
Harry had to catch his breath before speaking. “I have to, Mrs Weasely. I'm the only one that can.”
The Shakshouka bursts up in flames and the hand leaves Harry’s back.
“Right,” he faked a cheery tone. “Thank you for having me, Mrs Weasley. I’m very grateful.” Don’t run away. Don’t run away.
And Sirius had replied so kindly, telling Harry he and Moony were glad he was okay. That Teddy missed him very much. That they understood that he needed space and that their door was always open for him when he was ready.
“I realize now that it’s not the things we do that makes Christmas perfect.” Harry continued. “It's the people we spend it with. And the memories you make with them.”
Della looks monotonous, but Draco can see the tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.
Sirius felt the same for Remus.
“Draco,” Harry said, trying to get rid of the funny punching feel in his gut. “It’s so much fun to say. Draco, Draco, Draco.”
Harry couldn’t help but say, “but I thought you loved me?”
Grimmo comes to life.
“I used to live in a cupboard, under the stairs. Dumbledore left me with my muggle aunt and uncle.”
Just realized the chapter title rhymes. Didn't mean to do that so... Good for me?
Sirius pulls his knees to his chest, bracing himself for what he was about to say next. “I ran away when I was sixteen.”
“Now remember students,” Professor Sprout was saying, “the Controlled Reproduction Draught may seem similar to a contraception potion-” Ha! Harry was totally going to pass Herbology this year. “But it is nothing like it.” Oh.
"Rebellious streak my flat arse." Ron had rolled his eyes.
Mismatched and barely holding on to a few seams, but still together, a bit like their little makeshift family.
Instinctively, Harry hit the snowglobe under his sweater. “Yeah. Yeah, I have, actually.” He smiled in what he hoped was an innocent way. “You done?” Harry motioned at the pile of books under the Slytherin’s arm. They all looked the same to him. Ugly and torn.
Probably not rescue another Black, that’s for sure.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah.” Draco shrugged. “What’s the catch? Do I have to take an unbreakable vow? Must I be your personal slave for the next century? What is it?”
“I’m from a place where magic is real. There are witches and wizards. I’ve lived there my whole life.” Oh, the boy was talking. “There’s been some conflict. War.” He swallowed the same time Sirius winced at the word.
"Come on, Nev. Back me up on this?" Harry pouts at the other Gryffindor.
"Right. That is exactly what happened." Harry stalks into the room and flounces on the hideously Home Alone themed bed that obviously belonged to Kevin Entwhistle.
“Stay with him tonight.” Remus says suddenly.
Harry was pulled out of his uneasy thoughts by the same person that plagued them.
"Hullo Draco," he said, wiping something off his cheek. "I hope you don't mind me borrowing this kitchen for a while. It's not like Sirius makes anything but toaster pastries anyway."
Dean doesn’t reply, but Harry knows he’s probably smothering a laugh. Harry thinks this is a good chance to ask Dean again. He figures another try wouldn’t hurt. Much.
“I told you I take my sweater competitions very seriously.”
“Babe?" He continued when Remus hummed in acknowledgement. "D’you know any Blacks around Harry’s age?”
was something you should be afraid of. That would end up in a conversation much more mind-boggling than the thing about spoons.
Wimbledon turns a shade of puce that matches his robes. The exact shade and everything. “Who asked you,
it’s not safe. The only reason Sirius stayed back was that the Battle of Hogwarts was a night before the full moon. He stayed back for Remus.
Dumbledore let Sirius rot in Azkaban instead of handing Harry to him. That was no one’s fault but his. Yet there was no sense in blaming the dead. “The stars look awfully beautiful tonight.” He says instead.
"Yes,” he said. And he meant it. “Yes. I’d love to be Teddy’s godfather.”
“What?”
It was nice to see her looking so pretty and happy. She and Millie deserved a fun night.
“Trying to get us off of this muggle torture contraption alive, if you would.” Malfoy replied. He seemed to be gritting his teeth. And his knuckles were white from how tight he was holding on. Huh. At least Harry wasn’t the only one scared shitless. “Working it like I would a broom seems to help.”
"Marry me," Draco said dreamily.
He let go and pretended to brush the snow off his (
"She's just like you," Harry turns to Draco. "Absolutely adorable."
“That,” Harry tries to ignore the warmth in his cheeks, “that was hogwash advice ‘Mione. Absolute bollocks.”
"- or fighting." Neville sounded disappointed.
"Right." Ron's ears are red enough to be mistaken for hair. "Thanks Harry. I'll see you?" The  way he left the room could only be described as 'skedaddling'.
Harry left the day after Draco did, heart still clutched in his hand. He had yet to return to No.12 Grimmauld Place.
“Krystal kills Becca in the end.” He told her snarkily.
“Okay… I’ll try.” Now he had
That was a low blow, even for Harry. It worked though.
That explained the tiredness then. Harry remembered the full moon was two nights ago.
Draco’s face was a deep red, probably from staying under the hot water for too long. “Still want me to fuck off?”
“Harry…”
“Yes you do,” Harry pointed out. “A bit like a peacock actually.”
The knight drops his sword and then gets on his knees. He lifts his helmet and presses his lips against the dragon’s forehead. The snow swirls around them both and when it recedes, it reveals a prince in the place of the dragon, blond and beautiful. It had been hard to put Draco’s features on the tiny figure, but luckily the books in Draco’s trunk had been about the very thing.
Some would say that it wasn’t lying at all. Half-truths. Leaving out the bits that don’t matter. Except those were things that
Draco decided he hated it here already.
Presently, they walked down one of the snow covered streets. Warmly lit shops illuminated the otherwise monochrome district. There were wreaths on every door, and ornaments of every colour. Christmas lights hung from door to door.
Draco snorts. “That’s because Molly’s been
“Okay, okay,” grinned Lav, who was really getting on Harry’s nerves. “So the bad news is that one of the Controlled Reproduction draughts exploded in Herbology (which may or may not have been my fault haha) and some of it went on you and now you can’t go five feet away from Malfoy because you guys are now stuck in a bubble thing you can't get out of and no one can get into.” she said all in one breath.
Malfoy was not a fun person in the morning. Well,
Also Draco's POV is harder to write than I thought. I ended up with an absolute disaster of a kid lmao.
Draco was at his left, and had blatantly refused to show Harry what he was making.
Sirius wiped tears from his eyes, which Harry thought a bit unnecessary. Then again, this was his godfather they were talking about. “Well,” Sirius sputtered, still laughing. “It’s just that-that…” He wheezed.
“We get it,” says Ron, finally. “You’re irreplaceable.” He made jazz hand motions as he said it.
“I knew mum would forgive him, but
sound boring."
Fleur nods and takes baby Rosie. “Come, Vikor.” She orders. “Your goddaughter needs you.”
how you guys got together?" Lyra gagged, her long blond hair flowing around her shoulders. She had Draco's hair and nose. Everything else was Harry. "You guys are such dorks." Except maybe the attitude.
“Is that you?” Came Draco’s excited voice from somewhere. “I think I've finally got the hang of making fires."
“And I don’t know what
Harry couldn’t blame her. As blindly in love as she was, even Ginny could see that they weren’t working. There was too much going on. You can’t engage in teenage romance with death looming over every step, right?
Harry and Malfoy looked up from their spot on Harry's bed. They had assembled a portable telly in front of the bed. Jacques Milano could be heard singing the theme song of his show.
The map, a whole month of silence to become Animagi, James chasing after Lily like deer after doe; all of it made Harry very happy, but also quite barren. Bare. Because listening to the stories would never be the same. He’d never be able to experience it. To feel what they felt. To feel like they were with him.
There were sparks around them - maybe from the magic mistletoe, maybe from something else. And then they were as far from each other as the Controlled Reproduction Draught allowed them.
or something. No wonder Harry fell asleep.
“Of course you can! Anyone can! provided they can persevere. It won’t be easy, but we’ll be here for you, okay?”
The Hawthorn buzzed in his grip, sending silvery wisps into him. Every time he used it, Harry felt Draco’s magic. He was forced to acknowledge how everything had gone so horribly wrong.
? Harry had to battle a nose-less man and his henchman who could turn into a rat at will. Heck, Harry was the son of a deer. Stag. Whatever. How hard could this be?
And then there was more crying and comforting and spilling Shakshouka. Some more crying, a little bit of alcohol and then all four of them were cuddled on the too-small sofa. The quilt Draco used when Harry first came to No.12 was draped over them as they watched the Cradocks on the telly.
Sirius was taking care of himself more. It was as if his health had a direct effect on the house. If he was gloomy, the house felt gloomy. On a good day, it might as well have fireworks, which is much better than it sounds.
“No.” Sirius replied bitterly. “I’d never let that happen.” He turned to face the teen to find him staring, mouth agape.
Bathroom time was probably the most awkward. Both of them were badly in need of a shower, and the bathroom was far too small. They tried staying outside, but as soon as Malfoy closed the bathroom door, the horrible feeling of emptiness, a kind of pain that wanted him to throw up, washed over him. Malfoy opened the door, looking green, and they sat together, against the wall for a while, to feel better.
“I can’t be sure.” He’d said, barely above a whisper. “It doesn’t look like him.” Speaking seemed to pain him.
Stupid bigoted prat. Harry was a fool for thinking he’d somehow changed. What was Sirius thinking, bring a death eater home? Well, someone who is most
“If you die, I had no involvement and it was all your idea!” Luanne called after them.
Blaise is yanking at a string of fairy lights, with Pansy mouthing the occasional obscenity while pulling back. In other words, they were being their normal, snarky selves.
“We should get up.”
“You should pack it.” Malfoy tossed it back to him.
It was time for a survivor to help another survivor. James taught him to swim when he started to drown. Sirius would do the same for Draco.
Who was he to hope he could become better?
Dean had been pining over Seamus for what felt like forever. Harry couldn’t understand why  he couldn’t ask the other bloke out. They were practically a married couple!
Potter.
The ten year old inside him, the one who hid amongst the shadows was laughing. Harry hated that child. It always made him feel worthless and unwanted. He didn’t listen to the sound of breaking glass ringing in his ears.
“Well,” she twirled a bit of her hair - a sign she was nervous. Wait, Harry didn’t some sort of incurable dick disease, did he? She said something like that a few weeks ago, except it was a prank that time.
“And why would I let you? For all, I know you’d try to hurt him.”
EEEEEP! The closure you've all been waiting for is finally here!
Where was Draco?
shouldn’t have overreacted.”
“Yeah, you do that.”
Harry sighed. The last time he and Malfoy had been in a lavatory together, Harry cut him into ribbons and let him stain the floor red. Now, it was the walls that bled. His mind started to wonder if Malfoy really wasn’t bothered by the bathroom and the blood, or if he’d been pretending.
“Like you did.” He mumbled, and he could somehow see it. Malfoy huddling in a dark corner, on the brink of death and oh so very stubborn.
Yeah, Harry thought. He was just waiting for the right moment. He wasn’t exactly
Harry laughed. “Not much actually. We meet up every Saturday to watch Bollywood movies and... sometimes Padma goes off into her rants. I think you know how well that goes.”
That was probably how they ended up having a massive pillow fight (Harry and Ron) and then passed out on the floor (also Harry and Ron). Let’s just say Ernie was not pleased.
Harry can feel Draco’s breath against his neck. This time, Harry knows, he won’t wake alone.
Luanne harrumphed. “Just sit down,” Harry enjoyed the way she practically forced him to sit on the little sled. Thankfully she had the good sense to put Malfoy in front. That way Harry could get minimal brain damage. I mean, why damage an already faulty product? Malfoy could do with a little shaking in the thinker.
Trying for a counter attack, Harry throws the pillow back at Dean. It lands on Blaise's bed,  though. Four beds from his target. So much for perfect aim, Harry thinks. No wonder he  never got chosen to be a Chaser.
He couldn’t even ask Hermione, because she’s in Australia, and Ron went with her.
She was right. He had to go back.
His rambling was cut short by a comforting hand on his shoulder. Molly Weasley stared at him with kind brown eyes.
“Looks like you’ve got yourself a replacement.” Remus laughed, nudging Sirius. The shorter male just sulked until Remus kissed his cheek.
“Something’s forcing you to go,” Sirius concludes. He wraps his hands around Draco’s icy cold ones. “Is it something you can’t tell me?”
Harry felt his obstinate heart hammering against his chest. Do it. It says. Where’s your Gryffindor courage?
Hermione beamed at Harry when she saw his gift – an authentic, autographed copy of
" Harry says, hoping he sounds like the disproving mother-in-law character from his  favourite aristocratic soap.
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Harry tangles his fingers with Draco’s.  He feels a little squeeze and sighs in content.
Because it
“What’s the occasion?” Harry asks, instead of where Draco was. He didn’t think Curiosity would kill this cat. Probably
The Black sisters and Sirius and Regulus, all glaring at one another. Orion and Cygnus Black shaking their heads in the background. Their wives locked in fierce staring-contest.
“What was the pattern on it before?” Harry leans his face closer, enjoying the way Malfoy couldn’t look him in the eye.
says I’m fine, and
It wasn't unheard of for their movie nights to get a bit messy. In fact, most of the time
“Oh. You’re back.”
Teddy slept in Ocean Boudoir, where Andromeda Black once resided. The lines on the wallpaper seemed to move, like gentle waves tugging along a flat sea. Sometimes you could hear the sea breeze, lulling you into dreams of seagrass meadows.
Draco who was not speaking to him. Draco who was probably revolted by the kiss. Draco who was only standing next to him because of the potion.
He had to
“Even to Harry?” Ginny says viciously.
The owner, an elderly woman, made no move to greet or show them around. She had her face buried in an erotica novel Harry was embarrassed to admit he recognized.
Neville was doing an apprenticeship under professor Sprout, while Luna was doing the same for Care of Magical Creatures, under Hagrid.
It took the wind out of him, poor Harry. The sight made him nonplussed. Befuddled beyond words because
Harry’s brain short-circuited. So he

“What are you waiting for, Harry?”
to hand over her shopping to Draco. Really, the woman looks all too pleased to dump it all on him. Though, Draco can’t say she was smiling when Molly told her to take Draco’s trunk upstairs if the shout of "but
Then Draco showed him the magic.
Her voice is soft, but stern. She sits next to him, not quite touching. Molly Weasley is a comforting presence, though.
It’s just that Lavender had a very very bad habit of being very very nosy. Especially when it came to Harry’s love life. Or lack thereof.
“That’s the first time you said anything remotely close.”
Draco gathers up whatever courage he’s managed to keep after four months of Azkaban. “Della?”
He grips Draco’s shoulders and forces the boy to stare him in the eye. “Look into my eyes, and say it again.”
…Not have time to figure out an alternative and stand there looking like a quacking duck. Of course, he went with option B.
“That’s right, dear. I only want what’s best for you. If not for yourself, do it to make me happy.”
Harry was not above begging for his life. He did not come back from the fucking dead for this sort of treatment! "No Dean, please don't lock the door. Please. Please. Please."
“Don’t think too much,” muttered Malfoy, sneaking some pudding off Harry’s plate. He let him, knowing the sweet-toothed thing Malfoy was. “You look like your brain might pop out onto the plate any moment.”
Harry turns to Neville. "Too much?"
“Muggle or animagi or whatever.” Moony’s lips trembled. “I worried for you.”
Draco looked up to meet the striking green eyes of one Harry Potter. Of course, he should have expected the man to be here. Potter was practically a Weasley, even without his hanky panky with Weaslette. Ginevra.
The aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts left the old school reduced to a pile of rubble. Harry was one of the students who offered to stay and help with repairs.
Harry decides to shout out "I've had tea with your auntie Matilda, Dean. That was a  compliment.” Because there was less chance of him losing anymore of his dignity. Well,  whatever dignity Harry had left after nearly seven years with the Gryffindor’s.
Harry frowned. Why would Sirius find that funny? They were surprised to see each other is all.
“I said might be.”
What Harry is going to do this time, is not going to be stupid. Because it’s going to work. Operation Deamus was a go!
"Oh!" Harry grinned." We can do it the way Clarisse and Abram did! With the-"
"You're pretty good at this doorman thing, Potter." He hums approvingly. "Aren't you coming  in? Weasley told me you and Longbottom got kicked out."
“You know you love it.”
After all, Sirius and Remus have been Messrs Lupin-Black for nearly 16 years. They deserved all the happiness in the world.
"Well," Harry gestures at No.12 Grimmauld Place's landing. "What do you think?"
Draco felt heat creep up his cheeks. “Actually, I… You said I could help?”
Potter was standing right next to him. “When did you get here?” Draco demanded. He wasn’t going to admit Potter scared the living daylights out of him.
It took him a moment to register what the boy was apologizing for.
"-okay they're fine. Let's go!" Ron puts his hands on his ears. "If I hear another word  about
“Really?” Sirius blurted out. He couldn’t believe it actually
“And here I was thinking you enjoyed her company.”
“Hey, Harry?” Said Draco, pulling him out of his thoughts.
“It’s a fork?” Harry said, sounding unsure.
"Why does everyone keep saying that?" he moans. Everyone had taken up hobbies after the  war. There was Ron with his baking, Luna and her tattoos, Theodore Nott’s obsession with swimming in the Great Lake and so on. Neville didn’t have much right to speak either, because all he did nowadays was swoon over his mystery boyfriend.
“Here,” Harry said, not entirely disagreeing with the existence of a 'secret method'. “I’ll do it. You man the cooking station.” He quoted something he heard from an American restaurant show. It was about food trucks.
You don’t get much company in a cupboard, for example.
he returned it. Harry thought miserably, because what were the odds Draco would want to see him again?
Zabini flashed another smile. At both of them this time. “You guys should try it out.”
“Well, we’d be at each other’s throats had both of us been awake, I think.” Draco quipped. “
Potter finished off for her, very much off-key. “-to summon your magic with a Christmas song!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Then came a whisper of, "He might be straight…"
Harry remembered the Harpies were playing their semi-finals today. If they won, they’d be facing Puddlemere in the finals. Then again, the Harpies were facing the Magpies this time…
Tonks and Teddy racing on a broom while Sirius followed on his motorbike, shouting obscenities.
Happiness could be found in the darkest of places, if only one remembers to turn on the light, said Dumbledore.
Malfoy jabbed his finger against the window. “There’s a flock of them waddling by right now!”
The silence becomes unbearable, before Draco speaks up. “Maybe you can teach me more about muggles someday.”
It took everything in him not to cry when the bite mark on Draco’s wrist began to bleed, mixed with a terrible, puce-like violet poison.
kiss him if it weren’t for one Ginevra Molly Weasley.
“I’d like to try doing it without magic,” Draco told him, looking very soft and not at all like a pointy git.
Harry felt his ears go red. “Uhm… yeah. I guess I am, just a bit.”
"Because once someone said 'come on snake, let's rattle' and I body-slammed them into the  pool. Turns out they wanted to dance." That was how Neville got laid. By body-slamming his  crush into a pool. Harry could only wish he were that successful.
"It's not really a sleepover, Seamus." Harry grits his teeth as his shin was attacked yet again. He made a mental reminder never to sit next to Dean. Ever.
Shakshouka was special.
“So what’s the special thing that happened to us
At that moment Draco looked very much like a sleepy ferret - and it made Harry’s heart do loop-de-loops.
“Please, can you put your hand on my head?” He said, so soft Harry almost didn’t hear.
The memories come to him in patches, and not in the proper order, like he’d had one too many bottles of firewhiskey before bed.
The explosion that broke out was immediate. Within seconds Hermione and Blaise were brawling on Mrs Dabney’s polished floors. It gave Harry a chance to look at Hermione’s get up. She was wearing a patchwork jumper - and get this, the colours actually
The sound of leaves rustling outside lulled him into a dreamless sleep. Better, perhaps, than what you get from the potion. And believe Draco when he says he’s had plenty of those the last few years.
“What?”
"Harry?"
A different sort of rage bubbled inside him. Why would he think that?
Then Padma turned to Harry. “Just pack the kurta.” And just like that, she was gone.
“You go first.” Harry said weakly. He’d rather have his heart crushed first, rather than lay his feelings bare and have them walked on.
Harry turns to Hermione, eyes sparkling. He'd spent a fat load of Divination lessons daydreaming about the perfect Christmas.
Sirius smirked. “Toaster pastries, of course.”
Viktor sighs but makes no further comment before scooping up Teddy and Victorie. “Who wants to play hide-and-go-seek?” He says in his thickest accent because Viktor knows how much the kids love it.
Teddy, Harry and Draco wrapped up in the tacky old quilt.
“Can I at least put on a Santa hat?” Harry pouted. Hopefully his puppy dog face was just as strong as Draco’s.
Draco tries. He tries to look at him with those wide, mismatched eyes, but he looks away at the last minute.
“Oh.”
Well, at least Harry got to go in the hot tub.
True to his word, Potter came back. This time, he was holding a bright green ribbon.
Before Harry could reply, Mrs Dabney (the owner) announced  a light supper and then time for bed. He wasn’t able to talk to either of his best friends, but he did run into Lavender and Parvathi, the former of whom told him she was happy he’d finally found himself a bed warmer (much to both Harry and Malfoy’s chagrin) Parvathi just wanted to know if Harry's packed his kurta.
He wondered what Draco was doing and turned to look, only to find that Draco, red faced as usual, had taken his own sweater and slacks and was sitting at the edge of the pool.
It was funny how just two years of Azkaban had left him so disjointed. Melin, Sirius Black spent
Draco seems to be staring him. Harry doesn’t acknowledge the look. “I didn’t know about magic until Hagrid kicked down our door and handed me my letter. My aunt and uncle always acted like I was a freak. At least I finally knew why.”
“They are
Silence.
Ron looks like he doesn’t know whether to gag or dive into the sock portal to look for Krum's  socks. "You didn’t
So much for looking before you leap.
Malfoy believed what he was taught because they’d been taught to him by someone he trusted. Someone he’d looked up to.
The hair? The air of aristocracy they carried? Was it their looks? Well, whatever it was, it helped Sirius figure out that the shivering boy huddling in an alleyway was a Black.
“Okay.” Maybe he’d wear his red robes over it for a festive look. Subtle Slythergryff anyone? Gryffrin? Slytherdor? Slythegryffrindor?
"Fuck you." This time, Harry does throw dirty socks at his friend.
Neville was gallivanting with his beu whose name he’d refused to disclose. “Find out yourself, if you want to,” he’d said,  rather smugly. And while Harry had every intention of doing so, he felt Dean’s dilemma couldn’t wait.
“I have the mark.” He clenches his fists.
“Padfoot’s not here,” Harry called out, a bit too lazy to get up. “He went shopping I think.” What for, Harry would never know.
“I know this isn’t the best time, but you’re going to be leaving in a couple of days and we… Remus and I… we’d like you to be his godfather, Harry."
“Yeah?” Harry answered though he sounded two octaves higher. Like a schoolgirl. Okay, that was stupid of him. Like a dunce then.
“Did it not hurt?” came Draco’s hesitant voice from somewhere beside him. “When they made you feel invisible?”
He remembered that quilt now. The tacky, mismatched old thing.
Draco swallowed. One of the conditions of his host family was having a child his age. He really didn’t want to spend four years with either Morag
. “But-” He stopped when he saw the look Draco was giving him. “Okay fine.” Darn Draco’s adorable glare. Angry ferret was irresistible.
“Shut up, Potter.”
"Ron and I need tutoring in Herbology and since Terry and Kevin are on that Bulgarian exchange programme we thought it might be easier to do it in Ron's dorm." He explains, hoping Seamus wouldn’t see through him like Dean did.
Longer than usual chapter for y'all because I love you. Also I can't believe I wrote three chapters without a single curse word in them? Amazing. Well, two actually, because Sirius swore in this one. Still a record for me.
Harry wished he could say the rest of the skin was unmarred. It wasn’t.
He bumped into a broad chest. “Sorry,” Draco says, offhandedly. “Didn’t mean to.”
Christmas in Grimmo was tradition, after all.
- Harry, waking up to a weight on his chest.
Harry? Did you forget what he did?” Girl Weasley had tears shining in her eyes. She turned around, like a blood-red tornado, and stalked out. Her red hair seemed like it was rising with every angry step that she took. Potter shot Draco an apologetic look before running after his girlfriend.
“Trying new things is Gryffindor culture. I refuse to-”
Harry grinned. "I bet you'd love to have Malfoy's face on your chest. Close to your heart, innit?"
And all three of them looked at Harry, and he realized they were waiting for his answer. He’d been a bit shocked by Draco’s whole ‘queer aunt’ thing. He wondered if he meant what he said, or if it was just more forks and spoons. Metaphors and riddles weaved together to boggle Harry’s mind.
Harry thought, but didn’t say. He daren’t wake the blond, whose breathing had evened the moment his eyes fluttered shut. He’d fallen asleep as quick as the seasons changed from autumn to winter.
Cue more tears from Drunk Ron™. Dron. Maybe Harry should stop doing that.
Malfoy gagged from beside him. "I
Sirius led her to the Rose Bedroom.
possible in the way that you’re implying, but Moony and I, we chose the easy way.”
that was uncharacteristic. But it was.
“The inventor of toaster strudel will hear about this. Yes, yes, we know the drill.” The price of interrupting was Harry being pelted by magical throw-pillows.
Draco made a beeline towards a shelf full of dusty tomes, the predictable bastard.
You screamed first! And that too like a bloody banshee.”
Sirius felt awkward, standing there, not being able to do anything. This was something he could only stand and watch. Giving support from the side-lines. The revelation opened many of Remus’ old wounds. Sirius would be the one to stitch those up. For now, he let Moony take care of the broken boy before them.
you mean. This was Draco's third trial. The first one had him put in house arrest with mother. The second had him being dragged to Azkaban with chains on his wrists and ankles. Now, two years later, Wimbledon seems to have forgotten that.
His eyes lit up, though, when Harry turned. Sirius pulled him in for a tight hug. “Harry! You came.”
There was a trickle of warm breath on his throat. “The boat’s here,” Malfoy looked apologetic and a bit awkward. He seemed to want to say something else. “And uh…” He produced a parka, very red, with fur lined around the hood.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. Harry thought it looked peculiar, Malfoy and him standing inside a bathroom with bleeding walls. The former wearing one of Remus’ muggle band shirts and his hair fluffy and loose for once. Harry hated the gelled-back look he used to sport.
Harry turned to Draco, who had his eyes pressed shut. Was he disgusted at the prospect of kissing Harry? He certainly didn’t look excited. “Are you scared?” He said, voice low enough for only Draco to hear.
“Figured that’s the part you’d fixate on,” snorted Ron, walking into the infirmary with Hermione. “And before you accuse us, Pomfrey only let one person enter before and
They got access to all six floors, each with their own unique personalities.
Lavender stuck her tongue out at him. “Rude but it’s you so-”
. You offered him protection, Paddy and Moony, please. I…”
It was just that Grimmo had too many memories.
"Sounds fun."
“Sirius. May I come in?” Sirius remembered the melodic voice of Narcissa Black. Like a nightingale.
"Fine." Harry snaps. "If I arrange this, that too
“It's got warming charms weaved in and… you didn't have a coat or anything so I thought…” He trailed, looking away. “I couldn’t be seen with a parka-less peasant like you!” Malfoy snapped at the last minute, remembering himself at last.
There was nothing wrong with giving back, but giving back because you automatically assume they’ll take advantage of you is toxic.
“So,” Ron grinned ear-to-ear. “You’re going to have to spend Christmas with Malfoy as your personal cocksleeve. Puts one heck of a dent on your Christmas plans eh, old chap?”
Padma nearly gave Harry a heart attack when he walked into his and Neville’s shared bedroom. She stepped out of the shadows behind Harry and cleared her throat so loud he nearly jumped into Malfoy’s arms. Malfoy, who had to come with him because of the whole five feet thing.
"Right." Harry said, trying not to make himself look any more like the lovesick fool he was.  "Sorry." He let Malfoy in. And he might’ve stared at the Slytherin’s arse. Harry wasn’t going  to tell.
Draco nudged him, scone in hand. “Was that one of your Christmas activities? Baking?”
It started subtly. Inconspicuously. As all wondrous things do. Right under their noses.
“You looked like you needed a cuddle.” Harry said, matter-of-factly.
“What?”
The memory is still fresh in his mind, but fresher still is the sudden decision Draco had made;
Harry saw red. “
The sky, as always, was littered with stars too close for something too far to touch. Like Draco. The winter air made their breath curl white like smoke from a dragon. Like Draco. The gentle shower of snow was too delicate to have made an impact, yet it left Harry shiverin all the same. Like Draco.
He knew what he had to do.
Harry shrugged. That made sense, but he slipped a pair in anyway because you never know when a heatwave might come in and all the ice melts so they have to swim to safety.
Had Draco a wand he would have Disapparated right there and then. Fuck his pride. But since he hadn’t, he was forced to smile when Mrs Weasley greeted him.
“And here I thought you were actually doing something worthwhile.” Harry turned around to find Malfoy holding a tray of toaster pastries and tea.
And then it was done. They were done. Fingers tangled, sitting close. The stars shimmering above them.
The sound of a jingling bell pulled Harry out of his thoughts. He followed Draco into the tiny space. Instantly, Harry felt a whole lot warmer.
Sirius smelled the shakshouka even before he saw Remus fumbling around in their makeshift kitchen. He was stress-cooking again.
There was more fumbling from the kitchen and Sirius tried not to wince when he heard some Tupperware crash. Remus popped his head out and beamed at Draco, who was hiding behind Sirius.
You need to break before you can become whole.
“So why
He tried to be gentle, because Ginny once said that firsts were supposed to be memorable, but that wasn’t easy when you have long fingers treading through your hair.
"Thanks Ron. You're a good friend.” Harry hugs him, and then adds, “I'll find Viktor's socks for you."
It took them a good ten minutes to get Ron away from the alcohol and get him cleaned up. He kept crying about how unfair it was that the one time Ron went to Bulgaria, Krum was in London. “It’s like they don’t want us to see each other.” He told Draco.
Harry feels two hands wrap around his waist. Draco presses his face against Harry’s neck.
Draco snorted, almost seeming the boy Harry enjoyed picking fights with. “Could’ve fooled me.”
“Do you think it might be the full moon?” Sirius motions to the way Draco’s face contorts in pain.
She hugged Harry when he came near. “You look awesome Potster. I’m so glad you decided to wear that after all.”
He had the boy’s attention now. Sirius heard him drop the stick he was drawing dragons on the ground with. “You know my mother, Walburga.” He saw Draco nod in his peripheral vision. “She practically disowned me the moment they put me in Gryffindor. Acted like I didn’t exist and my brother Regulus became her only son.”
“Watch where you step, watch where you go!” Pansy shouted, giggling. “Harry and Draco are under the mistletoe!”
“Good.” And somehow that single word was worth more than all the praise he’d ever received. “If you’ve managed to earn dislike, you can earn everyone’s love too. I want to help you learn from your mistakes and grow up to be a better person.”
Lets just say Padfoot was not pleased.
Another silence followed. This one enhanced with the sound of dripping water Sirius hadn't noticed before. Must be from a leaky pipe.
"Neville?"
There was a soft groan from Harry’s right, which could only be-
(See the end of the chapter for
“Im trying.” He muttered. Malfoy’s eyes were shining, tears withheld. He shook tremendously and he had a trembling hand on his left arm. Was he alright?
“It’s okay,” Remus said soothingly. “We let you in knowing fully that they might have marked you. It doesn't change what we think of you.”
“You smell like treacle tart,” Harry says.
. That forks are something different.” He was rambling now, voice shrill and shaking terribly.
The boy kept slipping in and out of consciousness, often mumbling nonsense when he was awake.
This wasn’t the way Sirius pictured their happy ending.
The look on Ron and Jumper Malfoy’s faces were worth it though.
wakes you up by yanking your quilt off?” Malfoy retorted.
Those words made him stop stalling. Kiss the boy, he did.
Kinda rushed this chapter but I think it's OK.
“Yeah, I guess we should.”
"Hey, Harry did you find Krum's- oh my gods what the bloody hell is going on. Which one of  you killed the other?" Ron screamed. “I knew this would be a bad idea! What with your crush on-“
“I’d like that.” Draco turned back to his scone.
Oh. So that’s why neither of them was home very often. Harry didn’t think Sirius would leave him alone with Draco after the toaster incident without a valid reason. This was more than a valid reason. They had a
It hurt for Harry to hear this. It hurt him to think that Malfoy was afraid he’d say the wrong thing, and had to replace them. With forks and spoons.
Draco chokes. He looks as if breathing caused him pain.
Harry sighed and went to pick up the package from his trunk. He tried to ignore Malfoy hovering behind him and tore the paper away. The green fabric was soft to the touch, with a faint shimmer to it. The edges were lined with golden thread and there were intricate spirals drawn across the whole thing.
“If it’s the wrong person, it wouldn’t be the right time.”
Harry groans. "Please, Neville, don’t make
Remus glared daggers at him, though his eyes were fragile and weary. “You know you aren’t supposed to go outside. You could have been found out.”
Sirius goes for a run and discovers a young Black hiding among the wheelie bins in a muggle alley?
Was he alright? Was Malfoy going to cry? Was it Harry’s fault Malfoy was crying? Had Harry ever made anyone cry? Probably. But never Malfoy. Right? A thousand questions flooded Harry’s brain, but he couldn’t answer a single one.
Hermione opened her mouth, (most probably to complain about the mess) but before she could say anything, there was a scratching on the window. It was an owl. Or perhaps a fuzzy mop of sorts. Hard to tell.
…Which provided great opportunities for Harry to corner Dean about his crush on Seamus.
Heck, he’s living in a Victorian-era house hydro-dipped in dark magic. He’s got a dog and a werewolf for parents, a metamorphmagus godson, friends who fought over movies and Christmas lights and a godawfully poncey boyfriend. Life really couldn’t get any better than that.
Draco rolls his eyes. “No, I’m chopping strawberries. Honestly, Potter, maybe its time you got yourself some new glasses.”
“Harry.”
Harry hears a scoff from his left. Draco. “You have the exact same view from the Astronomer’s Room.”
"Sirius, where did you put the cans of tomato paste?”
“You forget that Moony is a werewolf. You forget that he is one of the kindest people in the world. You forget that he would die for a
Maybe it was the way his eyelashes brushed his cheeks. Maybe it was the bleak winter sun against his pale hair. Perhaps it was his breath, warm on Harry’s arm. No. It had to be the faintest dusting of freckles on the other boy’s nose, that Harry made a mental note to tease Malfoy about later.
And their lips pressed together again, and all was good. All was perfect. He could spend all eternity like this.
He shrugged, ’Cissa’s boy. “I think I’d rather die at my cousin’s house than an alleyway. Now let’s go before I change my mind.”
“Molly, please. And just thin enough you can still taste the crunch if you would. Ron doesn’t like it when they're too thick.”
Then he started laughing.
Malfoy made a disgusted sound and made to stomp towards the boats. Which meant Harry had to go too. “See you at the Burrow, Gin. And err... you too Pansy. See you on the train, maybe?” He waved at the couple before running after Malfoy.
Harry didn’t want to think about Draco, because thinking of Draco made him think about Malfoy Manor.
Draco grabbed a book, looking hesitant. “Do you mind if I…” He  motioned to Harry’s lap.
It hit way too close to home for Draco’s liking.
"No." Neville replies. "I think it was just the right amount of creepy. Oh, and you make a  great fanboy. Probably should stop watching so many soaps, though."
Harry remembered how he was in sixth year. Paler than a poltergeist and colder than death. Apprehension was always in his eyes. Always skipping meals and staying in the library until sunrise. Taking the company of a ghost.
was very wet, and by default, gross.
Yes. Grimmo was changing, and Harry had a feeling the occupants were as well.
Malfoy nodded. And then he did the most remarkable thing. He- he actually rested his head on Harry’s chest, and fell right asleep.
of a love story.
“Greyback.” Harry growled. His body acted on its own as he stood up and harshly pulled the blond into his arms. The scent of honey and roses mixed with something not unlike cinnamon wafted up his nose.
Ginny clears her throat. “I vote we watch Gilmore Girls.”
“Don’t say that.” Harry grumbled, feeling all that ‘getting along’ thing they’d been doing vanish into thin air.
Before sixth year, he was a patchwork of lies and pretences. Never once showing who he truly was on the inside. That might’ve been worse than when the mask finally slipped, because not even Harry was ready for the boy underneath.
Chattering amicably, and with her own hoard of shopping bags, followed Weaslette. Er… Ginevra.
"Guys. That doesn't sound like shagging. It sounds like Harry's getting strangled."
"Have
Harry knows he shouldn’t be surprised to see her here, smiling inhumanely wide. Ever since the Patil twins found out he was half-Indian (and subsequently formed
Molly Weasley takes her to leave, but not before telling him to get some rest. “You can come down to the kitchens to help me out in the afternoon.” She’d said.
“It doesn’t change anything.” Harry jutted his chin forward in defiance.
His parents’ first date.
Harry saw a light in the upstairs corridor. The Rose Bedroom.
I tried, to show how their relationship kind of improved. How they bonded over the week. But then it all went downhill and I came up with this.
"Good plan."
Remus doesn’t say, so Harry pulls out the big guns. “Where’s Draco?”
“May I?” Harry almost forgot about Malfoy, until he asked to touch the kurta. “”I’d like to have a look.”
No family is perfect. Harry understands that now.
Harry hates it when people apologize for his suffering. There was nothing they could have done to save him.
And here he was now, head buried deep into a thick tome. Sitting cross-cross on the carpet. Ghost of a smile on his face.
“Someday, yeah.”
Harry shrugged, definitely not thinking about walking in on Remus and Draco watching Jamie Oliver at four in the morning. “It doesn’t sting as much once you’ve done it a few times.”
They were out on the veranda, leaning on the railings and avoiding each other.
Harry let Draco have all his scones, artfully avoiding both Lavender and Hermione’s questioning looks. That was a conversation he’d rather not have when Draco was attached to his hip.
“Kiss him if you ever want to go,” Lavender piped it. “On the lips to escape the magic mistletoe.”
I think we can establish by now that Draco has a weak spot for motherly figures :)
“Wizegamont had an early trial for Lucius.” She said crisply. Gone all business-like again. “I have no reason to believe I won’t be next.” It made sense. The black clothes. The dark circles. Lucius Malfoy was given the death trial.
Just so you know (i forgot to mention it earlier) this fic takes place just a little over two years after the War.
Lyra grins. “That was the worst advice ever.”
The living room, with its tacky old quilt, where they watched 3 AM movies. The kitchen, Shakshouka and the toaster incident. Astronomer’s Room had Draco’s constellation right above his bed. Harry would never be able to go on the roof without that kiss burning the back of his eyes.
"Yes." Potter laughed again. "Oh." Draco felt a bout of unwelcome warmth bubble in his chest. Oh, Merlin. He thought he’d gotten over that stupid crush years ago.
Anyways tell me what you think! I feed off your comments because I'm an attention whore, fight me
Harry didn’t put his present for Draco under the tree. It just… didn’t feel right.
Longbottom.
Sirius waited until Malfoy was out of earshot before putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Harry, love, I know the both of you don’t get along-“
He pulled Harry’s trunk close and sat down on the floor, flabbergasting Harry. Malfoy looks up at him. “Well?” He raised an eyebrow. “Make yourself useful and fold what I give you. We don’t have all day you know.”
“Excellent observation Potter. I’ve left mine at home and Sirius lent me one from the family crypt. Now can we get on with the situation at hand or do I have to recite my life story to you before that?”
,” Harry whispered back. Did he?
"What happened to the lights?" Malfoy asks. Like an idiot.
Malfoy looked like he would very much like to strangle Harry. Which was a more welcome Malfoy than the blushy one that gave him parkas and made Harry feel things he’d rather not.
“Get what?” Harry asked. “Oh wait, you mean that owl from last night? Was that you?”
Draco was sleeping soundly - if a potion-induced slumber could be sound, that is.
Sirius shakes his head. These were the morals drilled into their brains before they could walk. The morals that hunted them. The morals that kept them up at night.
His godson had owled a day after the war. “I’m OK.” Hastily scrawled on a tattered piece of parchment; the only connection he’d made at all.
He hadn’t meant to say it. But Remus did, and the horror that tainted his face pained him.
Harry is fun to write. He's ready to combust at any given minute. Well, my Harry is. (ヅ)
“Malfoy.” Potter didn’t look angry. Only… resigned. “Just…” He ran a hand through his hair, making Draco’s mouth go dry. “Just, try not to be too much of a git to your host family, will you?”
them before you…”
“I really do think the Weasleys are the best choice for you,” Della says, sounding very sincere.
“But I’ve already cut the all,” Draco said woefully. He looked up to find Potter had vanished. Probably gone to tell Weasel so they could laugh- “Ack!”
the wrong house, why would that terror of a portrait of Mrs Black be hanging right over the fireplace? And was she
But Harry doesn’t want that. He wants to stare into those mismatched eyes for as long as possible. To enjoy the way Draco gently tugged at his hair. To cherish the moment. Make the best of it.
The smell of fresh biscuits was so much more magical when you made those biscuits with people who you love.
"You too Blaise." Says Harry.
Draco motions at another group. “That’s the Dragon.”
"DEAN, NO!"
Girl Weasley… ahem… Ginevra was totally not buying it. Merlin, the woman was openly glaring daggers at him. He dares say Draco wanted to shrink into his black robes. But he relented. Because he was a Malfoy.
Just wanted to mention that I'm not British so my
"That's all you're going to say?" Harry mock-whines. "Just 'sounds fun'? You hurt my heart Hermione."
Sirius is standing on top of a ladder, frowning at the humongous Christmas tree. He seemed to be trying to choose between a creepy-looking angel figurine and a badly chewed star. Remus is holding onto the ladder, with five-year-old Teddy is clutching his trousers.
"That's not true, Dean's not going." Harry blurted. Immediately Dean stepped on his foot. Hard.
. I do try. I try to call it a fork. But- but when you’re told it’s a spoon for so long, it’s difficult to call it something else.”
If there was a word for someone who did things without proper thought, then that would probably describe Harry right about now.
He’d never fucked up apparition before. Then again, he was more or less sure this couldn’t be the gloomy, cobweb-ridden living room of No.12 Grimmauld Place.
“I never said I
“Surrogacy.”
Felt like a home, it did.
He casts a spell on the creepy figurine. Harry only sees it after Sirius sticks it on with a (potentially permanent) sticking charm;
It was way too early for Malfoy to look as chipper as he did. “Remember you said you’d never seen grebes before?” Yes. In fact, Harry remembered denying they existed.
"There's no one else since the Slytherins are going to a party and Justin is in the infirmary." Right. Justin had the  Dragon Pox. Not a serious case though. Harry made a mental note to visit him sometime.
Harry groans. "Fine. I'll try it on Ron."
“And your keeping calm would too, Potter.”
“You guys are no fun,” Tonks says. Andromeda just shakes her head and resignes tothe kitchen. Probably to chit-chat with Molly about Merlin knows what.
“Maybe we can try this again sometime?” She’d offered. “If neither of us is dead.”
“What?” Harry sweated. “You don’t like it?”
Draco tuts. “My father-“
Ron kept trying to convince Harry to join the Cannons, but Harry was far too loyal to Puddlemere to make the switch. “There’s also the tiny detail that the Cannons fucking
“Has he…?”
Harry laughed, and as he did, he felt the Gryffindor side of him winning. Merlin forbid this be the first time it's wrong.
Also, at that point he was certain this was the right house because;
She had been sentenced to house arrest and her wand broken. Widowed and banished from magic forever.
Sure, he was on a different bed, but considering they
“Sappy sod.”
“Well, onions do tend to do that.” Harry couldn't keep the amusement out of his tone.
This Christmas, they covered all the beds in wrapping paper. The harvest festival, on the other hand, was one feathery affair.
That’s the word Harry should have used.
“Latinas,” Ron groaned.
His body moved of his own accord. Like his mind had been shoved aside to let his heart take the reins. Sirius scoffed. As if that ever lead to anything good. Gryffindorism had its downsides.
Harry half-expected to see tuffs of blond hair peeking under the tacky quilt. There was no one in the living room, though. It hurts him more than it should.
It was the only Disney movie he had ever watched, and now it was coming back to haunt him.
Draco watched as Potter cast a spell, and the sides of the carrots peeled away. They even dropped into the waste bucket!
And he was supposed to focus on contraception potions for plants or whatever. Isn’t more baby plants the point of Herbology?
"If that's all," Harry yawned. "I'm going to go take a nap."
“Breakfast?”
Sirius saw that in the way Remus wouldn’t meet his eyes. He could see it in the way Remus flinched when he pushed a finger under his chin and made him look. In the way his shoulders slumped in relief when Sirius kissed him slow.
“They meant for me to kill Dumbledore last year. He’d picked me for a task he was sure I’d fail. To punish my father. To humiliate us. It didn't work out for some reason.” Draco said.
Malfoy pointed at the toaster and then shoved the Toaster Strudel box at him. "I don't know how to put this, in that."
And there goes that fantasy.
It’s tempting, because Ginny often has brilliant ideas. But at the same time, she was also one of those who knew who Harry liked. There was no doubt Ginny would try set them up again the moment Harry came within a ten feet radius of her. Thus, Harry was avoiding her, for now. You couldn't hide from Ginevra Weasley for long.
, at the right time?”
I don't think I'm good at prose tho ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Anyways comment, kudos and all that bc that's what keeps me going. Love y'all.
“And well,” Remus blushed. “Sirius and I, we’ve had a baby.”
smile when Draco talked to him. “Ron, ‘Mione and I were going to have a biscuit icing battle. You can join us if you’d like.”
In truth all Harry and Viktor did was play knife monopoly. And frankly that might've been  worse than shagging the Quidditch star because Harry nearly stabbed him once. Or three  times, to be exact. No one actually got stabbed because Hermione said no bloodshed after 12.  And it was 3AM when they began.
He flicked his eyes towards the changing area, where Sirius was criticizing the outfit Malfoy had chosen. The black turtleneck and a green jacket, unzipped partway. He’d paired it with a pair of black slacks that Sirius was trying to replace with ripped jeans.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, a faint smile on his face. “The horrible woman says she’ll think about it.”
When he got no reply, Draco turned around and froze, dropping a smoking stick on his arm. He winced and Sirius had to physically restrain himself from pulling the boy close to him.
"First door on the right."
.” The words felt foreign on his tongue. Sirius wouldn’t admit it, but he was hoping Andromeda had something to do with the alley boy.
“Yeah,” Harry glanced at his friend’s faces. Hermione gave him a tight-lipped smile while Ron nodded jerkily. Neither of them was keen on his going to Grimmauld Place.
Draco shakes his head.
Malfoy sighed heavily. He looked weary. All the excitement from before had left his cheeks flushed but his shoulders heavy. Drained. “What if, for all of my life, I’ve been taught that this is a spoon? If-if everyone around me has called this a spoon.” He stared at it strangely, like it might turn into a snake and strangle him.
The boy who lived. But at what cost?
“Potter?”
“Yeah?”
They were also holding hands, but let's not get too observant, people. "The chocolates were a nice touch, Harry, but I'm lactose intolerant."
about Regulus’ old room. It had royal blue walls with swirls of yellow. The same willowy curtains as the Rose Bedroom’s hung above the cypress bed, but pale white, like night-time clouds.
Harry couldn’t remember much about what happened after that. Just that there was a shout and then the sound of something shattering and something touching his forearm. He remembered thinking that
Tonks sending him Howlers to tell him about Weird Sisters concerts.
Even if he learnt Arabic or became an illegal deer, it just wouldn't be the same.
Lav pouts. “Aww, but then who’s gonna kiss Parvathi good morning, and flirt with Hermione, and get on your nerves, and piss off Ernie-”
2. Said Draco sodding Malfoy woke up and screamed like a bloody banshee.
) blue-with-tiny-sheep parka.
Their foreheads pressed together, and Harry can
“Yes! Yes, I am rather hungry, yes.”
Draco took a deep breath, trying to ease the shaking. He looked sick to the stomach as he said it, but like the weight of the world lifted off his shoulders when he did.
Those scars were there, yes. Silvery lines slashed against pale skin.
"Not if that means telling him the blood is actually his homemade jam."
parents. He was going to be so loved. Harry could see it already:
“Are you two murdering more of my kitchen appliances?” Sirius asked in lieu of a greeting.
Draco stares at him the same disjointed way he did on ‘the day of the fork and spoon’. Dissociated. Like he wasn’t actually there. Eyes glazed over and voice shallow when he says, “I have something to show you.”
It was weird to be sitting on the floor of his room, folding clothes with Malfoy. Weider still, was walking into the Great Hall with him. Having Malfoy sit with him at Gryffindor. Him eating his potatoes like it was the most natural thing to be doing right now. Well, it sort of was, considering it was dinner time but- why wasn't he panicking over the whole potion thing?
At the same time Harry knew that Dean was genuinely afraid. He was scared that his feelings would somehow ruin his friendship with Seamus. Harry understood how that felt. He remembered how scared he was when he finally came out to Ron and Hermione, only for them to go off about some bet. Hermione won, obviously.
What’s a dog to do for a breath of fresh air?
Della Archibald reaches over the desk to squeeze his hand.
"Not at all. In fact, it ticks the snow off my wish-list." said Harry. He really had put a lot of thought into the whole 'Perfect Christmas' thing.
“Are you sure you're not stealing any of this?”
“Harry?”
“I would like to see my son,” her face wore no expression, but her eyes gave her away. “Please.” Desperation. Raw and painful.
Neither of them dared to the other in the eye.
“Thanks… I err- I needed that.”
“As much as I would love to leave you guys to your moment- who am I kidding? Ha.- The train is going to leave soon, darlings.” Came Pansy’s sharp voice. The dark-haired girl had her arm snaked around Ginny’s hip, the latter’s tongue in her ear. She pulled out to wave at Harry and then went to nip Pansy’s neck.
Tell me what you think! Hope you liked this chapter and please comment cuz I need attention :P Also you owe me for all the frequent updates.
Well, he did
, it had taken him aback.
“-can’t believe the both of you!” Sirius, now cleaned up, thank Merlin, dragged a hand down his face. He lifted the spells off them.
Seamus turned to look at Dean. "But Dean is lactose intolerant too?"
Harry blinked. When had he fallen asleep? He remembered sitting on the train next to Malfoy. And realizing how tiny the seats were and over-analyzing his and Malfoy’s thighs being pressed so close. Then Malfoy started talking about
"One."
This was just like when Clarisse invited Abram to her house to get him to kiss her.
“Bathroom first though, right?”
It was set in the outskirts of the village. Hidden within a thicket of oaks and firs that reminded Draco of the forest behind the Manor, back in Wiltshire. The sharp smell of thyme flooded his senses as Draco opened the gate. There had to be a raspberry bush somewhere, he just knew it. Most likely basking in the late summer sun. Under the creek, where moorhens were probably resting.
It's the worst combination ever."
It felt like he was under the sea. Unable to breathe, but too entrapped by the ocean’s wonders to let go. They had to go back to the surface, for a breath of fresh air. And then, they went under again.
Now, Sirius truly understands what that meant.
Malfoy was still staring at the toaster like it was a twenty-headed Hydra or something. "Mmm. I think I got it." he mumbled, like he was in a trance.
“What is it?” Harry cast a quick Tempus. Six in the bloody morning. Of course.
"So?"
Draco lets out a painful howl just seconds before the full moon had risen. Sirius hears a different howl echo from the other side of the house. He bites his lip, keeping his eyes on the shaking figure.
Draco gave him a watery smile. “I cry a bit too much.” He sounds apologetic.
It shows in the way this teenage boy rocks himself back and forth, shivering despite being right at the crook of the now-lit fire.
“Who’s up for a corny Christmas rom-com?” Hermione perks up.
pushed their way in.” He narrowed his eyes at Lavender.
“Excuse me, what?” Said Malfoy, who hadn’t spoken a word after they left the infirmary. Harry imagined it was because he missed the gauzy pillows. “Boycott Christmas? Why would you want to do that?” He sounded genuinely concerned for Padma’s mental health. Which was funny because Padma looked a bit miffed by it.
“But I’d like to get some sleep before we reach the lodge.”
Malfoy looked at Harry like he’d sprouted two heads. “What are you doing?”
“Anything the matter, dear?” She asks, already turning back to her stew.
it over and over again, but heal it when it comes close to dying. Were they still talking about Curiosity and the cat?
“Merry Christmas.”
“Why are you guys talking in rhyme?”
Lavender piped up. “May Parv and I partake in your Christmas activity as well?” She asks solemnly, though it was easy to tell she was suppressing a giggle.
Tell me what you think.
Harry raised an eyebrow, trying (and failing) to subdue his laughter. Mini Malfoy projectile vomiting over Walburga was just too good to be true. He wondered if Sirius had heard that one. “Funny. I really thought she liked you.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. "Because you're laughing like that."
Draco felt the weight on his chest easing a little. He was
Ron still looks a bit sick, so Harry counts that as a win. It was always so much fun to rile up  his best friend. Even more fun than gossiping about boys with Dean and Ginny. Or even chatting with Malfoy with the paper cranes.
“You were announcing it to the masses at the Great Hall this morning.”
“Don’t worry,” Malfoy winked. “I used magic to heat them this time.”
Lord for Merlin’s sake!” Point taken.
“You should wear that suit Padma bought for you.” Draco told him. Harry’s Significant Annoyance was wearing a billowy sleeved shirt like the one he wore to the Yule ball in fourth year. Maybe because this was technically Yule and Lavender said the party would be a semi-formal one. Except unlike that time, Draco was wearing suspenders over them instead of just black slacks. Oh, and he was wearing a pilgrim hat. Because why the fuck not.
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe Harry could convince Dean to join the eighth year team he and Ron were trying to  make.
“You know what? Fuck it.” Sirius says from on top of the ladder.
“I did. I did, Harry. I came back.”
Then, there would be those injuries to heal.
Then, Sirius told him about Shakshouka.
Harry stared in wonder as a tiny little baby giggling in Sirius and Remus’ arms. A woman stood at the side, grinning at the couple.
Remus sniggers. “Snivellus looks rather festive up there, don’t you think?”
He didn’t know how it happened, but all of a sudden, they were on the roof.
“That’s Potter’s father right?” Draco whispered. “I’m sorry.”
Of course they were, coming from two different people but… Ginny was straight to the point, but also a bit morbid. Talking about death and all that.
“Oh, shit, sorry.” Ginny said when she saw the kids. And then she slapped herself on the forehead rather dramatically. “My bad.”
Right now, Draco’s pressed behind him, arms hugging Harry's middle so tight he could barely breathe. Harry thought it would be a nice way to die. Death by hug. He'd succumb to that sort of end willingly.
A worried Moony. Stressed Sirius. Soft, domestic wolfstar.
The Auror pushed him again, and Draco glared daggers at Potter until they reached the atrium. Back to Azkaban, then.
Harry rolls to his side so Draco could free his arm. They were facing each other now.
ᗜԅ(⇀︿⇀)ᓄ-¤]═────
“As I suspected. You do not.”
Draco and Remus covered in flour after a particularly sticky bake. They’d been inspired after a Julia Child binge one afternoon. The bake-fest lasted till midnight.
Draco sputtered. “But… but-” He flailed his hands – newly freed of shackles – and tried to get his point across. “Why
"Cute dorks, right?" Harry said. Draco leans on the doorway, watching his husband tease her.
He’s convinced he won’t survive a minute at The Burrow, and they’ll have to ship him off to the Maestroes or something. But seeing the joy on Della’s face made him want to try.
They'd been living in a flat near Diagon Alley for a while now, but all obligatory holidays spent at No.12. The house had become a sort of holiday hub since after the war. And now it was covered from head to toe in Christmas memorabilia.
Harry reached his free hand to… to do what? Touch his cheek? Push his hair back? Honestly, what was he thinking?
Harry turned around to late to ask “what are you-”
“Don’t tell him I told you this. Better. Pretend you don’t know.” His godfather instructed.
"I'll get it," announced Ron, taking a handful of peanuts. "You think owls like nuts?" He goes to open the window.
Harry panics. Seamus had explicitly told him not to mention his flirting to the oblivious  Gryffindor. Harry was stuck in between the two pining bastards, not able to say a thing. "I said he's always ogling you, you big dunderhead." Nailed it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry couldn’t see that happening though. Lucius and Narcissa would never willingly let their son sleep in an alleyway. Did Malfoy run from them, or from something else all-together.
Harry found himself begrudgingly led downstairs. In the kitchen, Remus was feeding Teddy. He waved at Harry. There was a new scar on his chin. It looked fairly recent.
Hermione seemed to be having trouble with hers, so Harry busied himself with helping her instead of wondering what on earth Draco could be up to. Well, to be fair, he did think about it, even when talking to ‘Mione.
“What’s wrong?” Draco peeks his head out from the shower curtain, hair dripping. It immediately makes the bathroom fog with steam.
The days after, clutching his chest and wondering if he would ever breathe normally again. Eyes catching his wand and wondering if it would be cowardly to end himself.
fair and just member of the jury, Madame Archibald speaks up. The woman had been in Wizengamot since before even Grandfather Malfoy was born. She was ancient and, as a rule, no one dared defy her word.
And there was a real, proper sofa, and a real, proper mop of white-blond hair peeking out of a real, proper blanket.
He could hear his cousin laughing even as he walked down the steps.
“He isn’t
Instead of what should have been the Dark Mark was a deep bite mark. Scarred beyond repair. What looked like claw marks spelled out the most sickening of words. There was no mistaking who did this.
Something inside him shattered.
Harry often had dreams in which he was some sort of alternate dimension. Sometimes his parents were alive. Sometimes he had a wife. Sometimes he was a fucking giant squid. It was another thing Dean mercilessly teased him about.
"Wait," Harry said, realizing something. "So what happened to those chocolates? The ones  from before?"
"Bye Harry." Neville all but runs away, but not before giving Harry a quick hug. Perhaps he wasn’t as heartless a troll as he made out to be.
6. There was more screaming at that.
It felt a bit like cutting dragon liver if he was being honest. A bit more orange, and with less blood.
The reasons might be a bit obscure at times, like why Draco promptly collapsed on him when Sirius opened the door, but they always reveal themselves. All in good time.
And for some reason, Draco did. “Come bring out the joy…”
Potter’s hands, which Draco didn’t realize were on his waist, flailed up as he tried to explain himself. “Gin, I-“
Sirius and Remus had asked all their guests to give them a bit of cloth during the wedding. After, they sewed them together to make the most amazing quilt of all. Harry’s mum and dad gave them a piece fabric with the pattern of a deer and doe charmed to jump from seam to seam. Baby Harry gave them a gift too - white cloth with tiny, colourful handprints on them.
“Oi, Potter.” Malfoy was poking him with his wand. The Hawthorn with the unicorn core. Wait…
“Err...I'll be going now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry runs a hand through his hair. It's one of those very rare days he managed to convince  Dean to go outside for 'nature sketching' or some shit. And here was Ron, wasting precious no-Dean time. "Do you have a better idea, Ron?"
If you liked it please comment. I'd love to hear what you think of this fic!
“Happy Yuletide.”
This wasn’t about forks and spoons. It was about how Malfoy had grown up conditioned to look down on muggles. How he was so desperate to please his parents that he never questioned it. How his world shattered when it all came crashing down.
do a lot of flustering the past couple days.
The dragon prince and the knight embrace once more.
Harry."
“How would you feel if you find an absolute casse-err..." Harry fumbled with the word a bit before deciding to fuck it. "-Prat sleeping on your godfather’s sofa?”
Harry smirked. "The 457th episode of
All the ‘I’ve done good’ feelings disappeared when Sirius realized he’d forgotten the most important thing. A blanket.
Anyone else would have taken one look at the boy’s soot covered cheeks and declare him inconsequential.
Harry felt arms wrap around him, and then a thank you whispered into his neck. He felt moisture next. Tiny droplets wetting the crook of his neck.
Ron gave him another Cannons jumper. Yay. “Thank you Ron, I love it.”
Vines ran across the pale pink walls, dotted with the odd rose. They part of the plaster, but often gave off the most delicious smell of rose and honey. You could feel tiny pricks when you ran your hands along the thorns.
Harry grinned. "I don't know.
“At least we don’t have to worry about finding you a roommate for the ski trip? That’s the good news.”
“It’s nice, how Shakshouka’s always present on important days,” Remus said, smiling at Harry. Then he turned to Draco. “Did you know James made Lily Shakshouka on their first date?”
“Be brave, Draco.” She says, already turning back to the pile of paperwork on her desk. “I know you’ll find happiness.”
There was no turning back now.
“I was the one that sentenced my daughter to Azkaban.” Draco knew the story.
They exchanged dirty looks and Harry stuck his tongue out at him, feeling petty. Draco did not get to look so fit and embarrass Harry at the same time. It was just too unfair.
"Bloody hell, my magazine got sucked into your black hole of dirty socks." Ron wailed.
Harry just drags fingers through Draco’s hair. Draco leans into the touch, facing him so he could see those mismatched eyes. You only ever noticed when you were in, say, kissing-distance. And Harry
He thought it was going well, Draco had chopped the potatoes quite nicely (of course he did, Harry told himself. He’s perfect at potions) and the oil was almost ready for the onions to be put in.
And that’s when Harry noticed something. Malfoy was straddling him. Oh Merlin, Malfoy was straddling him and Harry was enjoying it and he kind of wanted to kiss the frown off his face and all these realizations were hitting him on the head like a bell going gong, gong. It hurt his head. Or maybe Harry really had hit his head.
He wished that for once, things could be resolved without bloodshed.
Draco didn’t wait for any comforting words. He scurried up the stairs and locked himself in Weasel’s old room.
Sirius wondered how many more injuries he must have missed. The ones on the inside. He didn’t know any spell to heal those.
, you'll let Nev and me sleep in your dorm, right?"
Across him, Madame Archibald raised a thin eyebrow. “Would you,” she says calmly, “rather stay with the MacDougal's, whom I recall your family has been in bad terms with for years, or perhaps, with the Longbottoms? Didn’t your aunt torture Mr Longbottom’s parents?” Her tone is firm, even. Stating facts, not putting him down.
The moments between Harry’s waking and Malfoy’s were… interesting enough;
“Let’s get Moomy his soup, shall we?” Teddy giggled, turning his hair bright green. Sirius took that as a yes.
Tonks came by and returned Teddy in the afternoon. Something about meeting her boyfriend’s family. Sirius wished her all the best (and shooed her away from his toaster pastries). When she knocked, Sirius had gotten his hopes up, thinking it was Harry.
Sirius turned around and planted his arse on the alley floor, eyes and ears wide open.
Well… unless they riled up Walburga’s portrait.
Maybe it was the jealousy over her voice. Maybe it was the fact that she had come all this way for her son. Maybe it was the way her icy demeanour melted when she saw the gurgling baby. Maybe it was one Black understanding another.
Mind made up, he went into the kitchen. The packet of homemade chamomile and lavender tea caught his eye. Sirius knew Moony liked a cup of that after a particularly depressing day, or a bad full moon. It helped with anxiety and insomnia which Sirius knew his beau had a bad case of.
"No, I saw you both leaving the party. You looked pretty inebriated.” Malfoy had assumed a  conspiratorial air that had Harry in goosebumps.
Malfoy huffed. He then grabs Harry’s arm and... puts it around his neck? “Fine.” He said.
“And you’re a git. What’s new?” Harry grinned. This, he could handle. “It's getting dark. We should head back inside.”
“I was forced to take the Dark Mark. Physically restrained and Crucioed multiple times until I was too weak to resist.”
“Here,” Sirius puts the cup of tea to his chapped lips. “This will help. Breathe, Draco. Breathe.”
“Ernie and I just had a lovely soak in the hot tub.” Blaise Zabini said conversationally. “It’s just there on the deck, under the stars. It’s warm, Draco, and so, so
Luna and Neville tumbled out of the floo just as Ron was about to force the Chudley Cannons jersey on Harry. Draco seemed to have similar problems, with Pansy trying to force him into trying her new (and very pink) crop top.
Malfoy glared at him. “It’s blue with tiny sheep, okay?” There was hurt in his eyes, like he expected Harry to make fun of him or something stupid of the sort. Even though the emotion was one Harry was used to being directed at, the softness, the
“Is that- is that something we do now?”
“Toaster pastry?” The blond offers.
He nods, trying to hold in a panic attack.
“Damn.” Harry shuffled through the racks angrily.
. It might sound a bit scary, but if you  keep your eyes closed long enough I'm sure you can do it too." He says in an unbelievably condescending tone. Like he was talking to a
"This is stupid."
Potter. Celestial bodies. We didn’t name Sirius the dog star because it resembles a dog!”
Gormlessly vowing never to close his eyes again.
“I did my best to protect my son. Please, I wish to see him one last time.”
The twins grin devilishly when they catch Harry’s eye.
He had a trophy, this young Black tramping around muggle London. A stale loaf of bread that he held like it was one of Walburga’s distasteful but expensive china teacups. Sirius wrinkled his sensitive nose at the greenish tint on it. It was probably weeks old. Not suitable for consumption at all.
Harry was more or less sure Dean was blushing. That boy better be thankful his cheeks don’t  flame up like Harry's do. Dean always teased him about how his cheeks flared whenever his crush so much as walked by. Harry hated he couldn’t do the same back.
To which Harry sent a hastily folded… err… finger puppet toucan. ‘
Before Draco could reply, Ron interjected. “It’s pretty clear Malfoy helped Harry with his costume. It would be favouritism.”
All the others were already on the hills, just tiny figures skating or skiing or sledding. If they figured it out so easily, why on earth was Harry struggling? Malfoy too. He was supposed to be the smart one in this relationship. Oh Merlin, maybe Harry’s obliviousness was rubbing off on him.
He put his presents (Ron’s jumper, Mione’s reading glasses and Lavender and the twins’ DVD collection and some other gifts) away.
And that’s when Draco decided to throw the first snowball. Oh, it was on.
“Bold of you to assume I knew you could read.”
Draco’s lips were red from the snogging and Harry felt a surge of pride. I did that. Harry dragged his fingers on the blond’s back, relishing the way he arched closer. Draco rested his head in the crook of Harry’s neck, and within moments of mixed heartbeats, they fell asleep.
. He reminded himself.
“I don’t know,” Harry mused. “Can you?”
“What’s this?” He fingered the baggie, looking at Sirius expectantly. Like he should start talking any minute now.
the house come back to life. They’re both crying, on the floor of No.12 Grimmauld Place.
Harry felt shallow.
To his surprise, Potter actually laughed. “Ginny got me this shirt. Said she’d hex my balls off if I didn’t wear it.”
“I…I…” His words dissolve in a coughing fit.
“Shh… Calm down.” Her steady voice is comforting. It pulls him back to reality.
His mind drifted to what Sirius had told him, about Malfoy running away. Something big must have provoked it, because Malfoy adored his parents more than anything. It must be something to do with his impossible task. Surely he’d be punished for not killing Dumbledore. Maybe he’d shamed his family, and couldn’t bear it.
The sock part was true though. Ron might find sweaty Krum stockings if he dug deep  enough. They weren't hard to miss. Very radioactive green with purple polka-dots type.
“What if it’s the wrong
Harry knows that sort of dramatic behaviour always made his friend smile. Even if Dean  wouldn’t admit it, he loved theatrics as much as Harry did. It was one of the things they did  on Harry & Dean Nights… along with boy talk and baking cupcakes.
Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini don’t even look odd, standing in their respective ugly-sweaters, courtesy of Molly. Greg and Astoria got caught up in a big shipping deal and were very sorry not to attend.
She practically glowed. “You bet your fine arse I did!” Ginny plops herself down on the floor, lying down with her head on Luna’s lap. The latter immediately starts braiding.
Draco flushed. “There was a compliment in there somewhere. Thank you, Harry.”
“Not at all!” Harry said. In fact, he just might find something special there, right? In a lot of the books he’d read, antique shops held a lot of significance and-
was the bloke Harry went to school with. The one who asked a first-year to teach him sewing so he could make himself a dementor costume to 'scare' Harry. The one who stayed up all night to make those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges.
Even in the blistering cold he sat with his back ludicrously straight. The posture of someone forced to sit for hours strapped to a metal chair. A Black.
It was just the skull now. The snake had receded into it the moment Voldemort died. Draco tried to convince himself it was gone. That this was all a bad dream.
Fleur’s face the first time she tried Shakshouka (it was not a pretty sight).
Anyway, back to Dean's dilemma.
"Is your opinion of me that low, Ron?” Harry says. “No. Actually, don't answer that."
At least they had some sort of a correspondence going on, right?
interesting.
Sirius insisted Draco take the Rose Bedroom. It used to be Narcissa’s.
I will sick up on Harry's sock pile."
“Hermione Granger, you get third place.”
“Okay.”
And that’s when Harry realized something very, very important. If he couldn’t be five feet away from Malfoy that meant he was… “Oh my god, Malfoy is sleeping next to me.”
"But Ernie!" Ron yells. "You can't possibly keep us here forever."
Malfoy had been quick to point out Sirius had in fact, always been barmy and Harry was just too oblivious to notice.
“I believe everyone deserves a second chance.” Says Molly Weasley. “Yes, even the worst of people should be allowed to better themselves. And I don’t think you fall into the ‘worst’ category.”
“I don’t think I can wait twelve years for him, Sirius.” He chokes. “I just don’t have that willpower.”
“I just… two people who constantly have their wands at each other’s necks… they see each other and then… they fucking screech like-like little schoolgirls.”
Sirius glanced at Draco apologetically. Draco just reached out and gave his hand a squeeze. “Don’t worry Sirius,” he was grinning, canine-like teeth displayed. “I’d be more than happy to be that queer aunt that shows up late to Thanksgiving in drag.”
HARRY'S POV
“So,” Draco said, leaning back against Harry - a bit like they did that morning, except they weren’t sledding down the hill of death this time. “What exactly do you and the Patil twins do in your little… Indian club?”
Sirius turned and fled, wanting giving mother and son some privacy. In truth, he didn’t like seeing that sort of affection. It reminded him of Walburga. Teddy drooled on his shirt.
Sirius and Draco knew the names of each and every room; The Rose Bedroom. The White Hall. Magnolia Alcove.
Why had he not figured out that Draco was in turmoil the moment Harry saw him in Myrtle’s bathroom? Of course, he had to go and rip him up into pieces like a daft, impulsive thing he is.
Also, I'll be writing a shit-ton more Drarry (and wolfstar probably) so stay tuned :)
Harry started to feel a bit defensive. “What? Why are you laughing?”
"Sorry Harry, I have a date." Says the heartless troll known as Neville Longbottom.
“Found anything you like?” Draco was peering over his shoulder.
"Relax Ron," Harry hiccupped. Even in his drunk state, Harry was not about to let Ron blurt out his not-so-big secret. "Malfoy and I are just playing a- hic- good old game of -hic- knife  monopoly. Right Malfoy?"
There was nothing Harry could say to make him feel better because Harry didn’t know. He’d never had parents. He’d never needed to live up to impossible expectations. He’d never…
She’d given him a pair of self-cleaning dragon hide boots. “Because you never know when you need to go stomping around the Forbidden Forest,” she winked.
.” Draco had said, matter-of-factly.
Over the week he started looking better. His face gained colour and while his eyes still sunk in, they didn’t look as ghastly as before. No more blue lips, thanks to the blanket Sirius remembered to bring.
“I guess I sort of ruined your perfect Christmas plans, didn’t I?” Draco was leaning against Harry, his eyes glued to the dancing figures inside the snowglobe.
“Well, get on with it.” For once, Harry agreed with the git.
Harry thought it much better to stay in a living house than say, a cupboard under the stairs.
Draco finally spoke. After what felt like eternity and a half, he’d said, “What are you doing, Harry?” It was barely above a whisper, and the words turned to clouds of vapour in the winter air. They disappeared into the night sky, as ethereal as the person who’d spoken them.
Little Teddy made their lives even brighter, with the occasional sleepovers with Tonks adding to the cheer.
“Please, Mrs Weasley.” He said before he could chicken out. “I have to know. Why did you agree to let me stay? I mean, its obvious none of your children are happy about it. It’s horrible really, they don’t deserve to have to suffer after the war. They shouldn’t have to put up with my sorry arse…”
Percy holds up a bowl he’d been eating from. “Kale crisps?” he offers, looking bored.
Harry got Ron a special seat to Krum’s New Year special match. He hoped for a fun reaction from his best friend.
After an aeon-long staring contest, Narcissa sighed. “May I see my son?” She handed Teddy back to him.
Harry stared, bewildered. “No. I’d tell you that that is in fact a fork.” Because even someone as daft as Harry would know a spoon from a fork.
Sirius smiled. “Yeah. I think your hero-complex is rubbing off on me Harry.”
“Malfoy.”
"Dean, come on. You're better than this. Where's your Gryffindor courage?" Please work. Please work. Please work.
It’s enough.
“Notice how he didn’t insult
Malfoy yelps and leans back. All of a sudden, they were tumbling off the hill - also faster than the latest Nimbus model. The sled had long disappeared and all Harry could see was snow. Snow spinning around him as he and Malfoy rolled down, smushed together inside a gigantic snowball.
All of them crying as they send him off to Hogwarts and being so terribly proud.
Harry felt like a blinded man experiencing sight for the first time.
Yeah, the one his  grandmother gifted him last Christmas with a note saying 'you probably need a good pillow  after all that Nagini chopping' or something like that. Harry's not sure what exactly. Cursive  is hard to read.
Ron took off his extendable ears as Malfoy groaned again. "You think we should help them  out?"
Malfoy was currently in the middle of pulling a rather shiny knife out of his thigh. "Oh? Yeah, just some knife monopoly."
"Actually Viktor and I just played knife monopoly."
“I bet it does. You just have a secret method you don't want to tell me.” Draco said vehemently, casting a death glare at the onions.
Sixty seconds can’t be that hard, right?
He edged closer, the floorboards creaking under his trainers. Harry placed his hand on the doorknob.
Malfoy made eye-contact with Harry who turned back to bitterly sorting through sweaters. This was going to be a long day.
But it was there. Alive. Slithering inside the head. Occasionally poking her head out of an eye socket to nip at the skin under his shackles. It hurt. It always did. Even after two long years of rotting in a cell.
Of course, the resemblance was uncanny, even though ‘Cissa only had blonde hair because of albinism. Pureblood breeding did that sometimes. It created a motive too, for the boy to run away. Lucius Malfoy being a Death Eater and all.
“Where were you?”
Draco engaged in avid conversation with said wizard, something about the virtues of alchemy over potions. Sirius didn’t bother keeping up.
“She seems to have forgotten the whole throwing up incident.” Malfoy grins, baring his sharp teeth.
A sound, very much like crunching, could be heard from time to time.
"You're doing something stupid aren't you?" Dean narrows his eyes. It was at times like these  that Harry wished Dean didn’t know him so well.
"Now that you put it that way," Harry let his hopes get up at Dean's thoughtful face. "No."
He was the one that planted the idea into her head in the first place. He killed himself before the dementors could find him.
“Prat.”
Draco finally found his voice. “You really think I can do that?”
"Oh, hi guys. Draco and I are marathoning the last fourteen seasons of
or anything, but Draco still felt a pang echo in his chest.
They stood around the long kitchen island, a bit like during Herbology, actually. Recipe books lay open to different dishes on different parts of the table. Gingerbread, madeleines, shortbread and even stained glass window biscuits (though Harry couldn’t imagine putting icing on some of those).
"Half a minute, Harry," said Ron, going over to sit next to Hermione on the Ugly Green Loveseat. He throws a large, rectangular package at Harry. Must be another something from a fan, Harry tosses the box to a side for now. "We always wear my mum's jumpers on Christmas. It's tradition!"
Molly was in the kitchen. She had at least two kettles running on the large stove. The ginger-haired woman was humming what Draco recognized to be Celestina Warbeck’s A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.
“Hey, Harry.” Ron had grinned at him. “I managed to convince Mrs. Dabney to let us bake in her kitchen.”
One of the professor’s eyebrows disappears under her mop of fuzzy hair. “Well, unless you got married and didn’t think to inform us, I think we can all agree there is only one Potter. At least, in this room.”
Sirius patted him on the back, gently, like he did when Harry had nightmares. Draco smelled like Harry. Like his bedspreads. Draco had been with him.
Remus frowned, eyeing the marred flesh, red and purple. The burn mark from before stood stark against the fainting bruises. “Were you ever going to mention someone hurt you?”
Presently, Harry took in the scene around him and wondered if he somehow ended up in the wrong house.
He had to put the boy out of his misery somehow. The injuries would heal better if he slept. There wasn’t a single part of him that wasn’t covered in bandages.
She was clearly in her element, twirling around to put her meat in one pot and seasoning the other. Molly turned to put something in the freezer when she caught Draco loitering near the entrance.
“Sirius?” came Malfoy’s tentative voice from the kitchen.
Harry was too flabbergasted to call after him.
It was a medium-sized room with two beds on either side. One half of the room was covered from head to toe in bright orange Chudley Cannons memorabilia. Even on the bloody
Dean frowns. "That was oddly specific, mate you okay?" then he adds, “Did you get that  from another one of your weird dreams again?”
The fire cast dim shadows across the eighth year common room. From one corner of the room, flashes of light could be seen bouncing off the walls.
Harry was just about to leave when he saw Malfoy point something at the toaster. "Malfoy, no!"
He wrinkled his nose in distaste when Sirius threw it in the wheelie bin. “I can’t eat
"Practicing for your future career as a doorman, Potter?"
Heck, they’d even attended a funeral service for ‘little old Toasty’ with black suits and all. Harry was starting to think his godfather was a little barmy.
of all people, were building a gingerbread mansion, while Padma, Ron and Theo were squirting icing on some of the biscuits. Harry imagined they were in around the same state as the stained dick ones.
He knew what the soup with fork part was, Draco’s impossible task, but the knife? What was he trying to say? Did the death eaters hurt him? Was Draco not one of them after all?
“You know why Remus left his job.” He continued when he got a nod from the other male. “I’ll have you know I won’t tolerate a word against him. Family or no.”
“All right. All right. That’s about enough arguing for one day, don’t you think so boys?” Said Sirius, looking amused. “Draco, would you be a dear and put some pastries in the toaster?”
It was family. It was home.
Malfoy snorted, and Harry was glad the lights were off because he might have punched the git if they weren’t. “Shit.”
The memory of helping a half-asleep Draco into his pajamas was next. Harry could feel the other boy’s milky flesh even then. Draco’s head on his shoulder as Harry tired his level best to unbutton his jumper from the awkward angle. The smell of salted butterscotch and chocolate that occasionally drifted from Draco’s skin made Harry too delirious to focus anyhow.
Merlin. ‘Kiss the Girl’ is playing in his head, like a little red crab singing atop his brain.
Harry nods once. Tightly. Almost like he doesn’t want to know. Because he doesn't. Because if it was something Draco thought might ruin their this, Harry would rather not know.
“I mean, don’t you think it’s a bit excessive, calling each other by our last names? Especially after this particularly life-threatening event.”
If you liked it, please comment. It makes my day. :,)
If he couldn't keep the smug look off his face, that wasn't Harry's fault. "Much better. Now what do you want?"
James taught the Marauders Arabic and Tamil so they could talk about ‘stuff’ without other people hearing. Lily learnt it because she had to make sure they weren’t 'up to no good'.
magic. Like all old Victorian-era things, Grimmo had magic seeping right through its floorboards and furniture. Wouldn’t be wrong to say the house was alive.
Harry rolls his eyes and goes into the sitting room.
"Apparently you, since all his passes went over your head," Harry mutters under his breath. "What?"
Lying by omission.
Sirius faced the boy again. He was cooped up in a corner. Still shivering.
His cousin sat at the edge of the bed. She brushed a tentative hand against his bandaged cheek. Draco stirred, but didn’t wake. Narcissa let out a choked sob. “I’m sorry, darling.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The globe showed first a dragon and a knight in battle. Then the dragon lays its head down - a sign of concession, and the knight goes it, sword in hand.
Harry and Luna the very moment they slipped off of the Thesteral
The bite might have been part of the reason Draco decided to leave. Lucius and Narcissa might have been horrible people, being Voldemort’s disciples and all, but they were Draco’s parents. Ones whom he loved more than life. Their son not being pureblood anymore might have been a hard blow for them.
The only time Malfoy’s not pretending is when he’s insulting Harry. Or duelling him. He bet the first thing Malfoy thought up in the morning was the list of insults he’d be calling Harry that day.
The matriarch seemed to be humoured enough. “None of that.” She tuts. “Call me Molly, dear.” Her voice is so
Harry pressed a kiss on Draco’s forehead. A bit like the knight to the dragon. “What are you talking about? If anything, you made it all the more amazing.”
“It was nothing,” Harry smiled.
“Acceptable.” What? That was a brilliant explanation. How come Harry only got an ‘acceptable’ for it?
“- That’s what makes a perfect Christmas.”
The building was alright enough, he supposed. White walls and a red-brick roof.
“Like I said.
“Why are you saying all this to me? Just say thank you. It’s not hard y’ know.” Harry couldn't help it. He
Harry asked if they too could make and eat Shakshouka. Like a family. Like James and Lily and Sirius and Remus and Euphermia once did.
“If you want a reason, just think of it as me seeing myself in you. And wanting to sort of thank James for what he did for me. It’s all very selfish you see?” Sirius smiled. “I am but a selfish man who wants no debt from dead people on my head.”
Ron had been remarkably calm about the entire ordeal. “She’ll get over it.” He’d said sagely, patting his shoulder. They talked no more of it after.
“I thought I’d asked you to stop calling me that.” Remus smiled, soft again. Not fragile. Whole.
Harry fakes a laugh. The falsetto doesn't seem to work, despite Harry spending hours in front  of the mirror practicing. Just like Paolo from ‘The Heist’ to deceive him. The bastard. "Of  course I'm not. Why would you think that?"
“Yeah,” Draco was helping Harry ‘tame’ his hair. The latter of whom was still shirtless because “you don’t own anything that can be considered remotely formal except the kurta.”
“What happened to your Christmas boycott?”
“Oh, come off it you fuddy-duddy wanker.”
“It’s hard to find out something you’ve been taught by people you love is wrong. It hurts when the real fork comes back to stab you.”
No.12 Grimmauld Place was beginning to feel more like a home, and less like a grim, old Victorian-era house that aged badly.
“I never agreed to.” He smirked.
“It’s time for presents!” Said Parvathi. She was wearing a beautiful green and beige saree with lace that looked like delicate leaves.
This was another one of those things that start off subtly. Inconspiciously. One of the wondrous things.
Malfoy grabbed him by the elbow before Harry could storm out of the house. “Potter.” His voice was tentative.
“What if I told you it is a spoon, would you believe me?”
If you're on a trip, and you take the wrong road, does finding out you’re on the wrong road automatically take you to the right road?”
“Merlin, Padma! Are you trying to kill me?”
He was
Then something clicked. “We have to fix this before Sirius gets home.”
They were always, always shaken up by the ‘what ifs’. Possibilities weren’t something they dwelled much on after James passed.
Sirius remembered Remus telling him about a student’s boggart being his parents’ disappointment. Perhaps this was that particular student, huddled in Moony’s arms. Being comforted and patted on the back more times than the Malfoys probably did in a year.
"I've a wish-list, see," said Harry, pulling it out. "Snow, icing biscuits together, an ugly jumper competition-"
Harry hoped so. He really, really hoped so.
“Oh,” said Draco. “Don’t wear the red robes over it. Yellow would look better.”
Neville snaps his fingers. "So
It takes a moment for Harry to tear his mind from ogling the blond and register the question.  As soon as he does, however, Harry wishes he brought Neville's Hippogriff-feather pillow. It  muffled groans really well. "Did Ron tell you that?" He squeaks.
“Her son, Delaney grew up in my care. I always felt guilty for sending my daughter away. Luther made me out to be a monster. Said I was taking revenge for Martha having a child out of wedlock.”
“James was the mother-hen of our group – with Moony following not far behind, (that earned him a smack on the head from Remus) so he was always doing something or the other to make us feel nice. Imagine!” Here he laughed and looked at Remus with fond eyes.
Draco was still asleep. More comatose than asleep, really. Madame Pomfrey agreed to come to look at him the following afternoon. “Till then, let him rest. He’ll wake up when he’s ready.”
Oh, Harry was sure this was the bloody wrong house.
Seamus' eyes lit up. "Oh, okay. It's fine then. Bye." The Irishman scampered away faster than Neville did when he got owls from You Know Who. Harry cringed. Probably should have stuck with ‘Mystery Boyfriend’.
“Now whoever looks at you will see the most revolting thing possible - their own face.” He’d said.
The snow-capped towers of Hogwarts were fast asleep. All except the tallest, of which a single window shone bright with orangey light.
“You know what they said?
Neville is sprawled on the floor, surrounded by Quidditch manuals. Apparently, his mystery boyfriend was really into the sport.
Then, in a rush of madness, Malfoy summoned a fork. “What is this, Potter? What do you- what do you call this?” He brandished it in front of Harry, like a sword.
Harry could tell that Draco was going to launch into a full-blown Hermione-style lecture with the addition of Potter-bashing, so he gave in. To his impulses.
Sirius trying to feed him toaster pastries. Circa four months old.
stupid.
Harry asks when it goes oddly silent. He never did well in silences. They made his heart hammer. Harry didn't think he liked it much, when his heart started hammering.
“We didn’t know.” She whispered. “You’re right, it was his fifth birthday. We had a party. Everyone was there. Your mother, cousin Cassie and Bella.” She choked.
Or maybe he just hurt his wrists and you’re overthinking again. Harry’s brain helpfully supplied.
“He promised to go on a date with Luanne.” Hermione said, stirring her coffee.
Ron promptly fainted. Bless his poor, easily-frightened little heart.
Draco laughed at that and Sirius felt his heart fill with joy. Things were going to be okay. They were going to be okay.
They dragged him back to his chair and the rest of the session whizzed by in a blur. Mother testified, and so did Potter, but Draco didn't hear a word.
Draco lies on his chest, fingers tangled in Harry’s hair. At some point, his eyes flutter shut and a warm quilt is draped over them.
That was almost a decade ago.
Alive and asleep. Now it was waking up, one brick at a time.
But that meant-
“Viktor got him the same thing!” Hermione giggled.
Draco nodded fervently. Mrs Weasley shot him a warm smile.
“Trying something new.” He shrugged, just as Harry had that afternoon.
Harry made a show of pretending to look out for Sirius. Couldn’t have his godfather find them eating contraband.
Harry saw Seamus and Dean sneaking out to hang some of the biscuits on the tree (the ones where the glass bit looked like penises) and Hannah running after them with more normal-looking ones.
Harry didn't even know
“I’m trying not to say things like that. I’m trying not to be like them but no one understands how hard it is.” It seemed like Malfoy was talking to himself more than Harry. Harry wondered if he should go. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy would like his company. It was all very awkward. It made him feel off-kilter.
Sirius wanted to strangle whoever made this boy so brutally cynical in the worst way. “There’s no catch. I just... I just want you to…” Live a happy life? Not have to look back every step? Was this Sirius seeing himself in the boy and selfishly wanting to rescue him to make up for his lost childhood? He faltered. Where was his Gryffindor bravery when he needed it?
were supposed to protect
“You don’t even like plastic!”
Harry put him up to cut the vegetables while he heated up the oil and cumin.
Harry  chanted the mantra until he felt ill.
Malfoy turned a very satisfying shade of pink. “You're very loud, okay.”
4. All the screaming and shouting made silk-bathrobe-clad Sirius Black run down the stairs.
intercouse.” Why were they learning this again? This wasn’t a Sex Ed class last time Harry checked. He says as much to Dean, on his right.
“But I
with his crush. Things were rocky and often awkward, but hey, at least they weren’t at each  other’s throats anymore.
"We don't have to wear ugly ones the whole time!"
"Now can we play or what?" Neville bristles, clearly disappointed Harry figured it out. How could he not? Even Harry wasn’t that oblivious. Most of the time.
"Harry." Dean gritted. "If you got that idea from a soap opera I swear-" And
“Harry, it’s okay…” Sirius might be saying. Harry doesn’t want to listen. He can’t listen – bells gonged in his ears, blocking every other sound.
Harry felt the need to fill the silence with something.
Remus glares at him, face green. “I’ll be fine. Remember when he left?” He gestures at Draco. “It was a few days before the full moon. There’s more to that bite than Draco lets on.”
Anyways if you enjoyed reading this chapter as much as I did writing it, leave a comment or kudos :D
"Come on, Dean." Harry shoves him in what he hopes is a natural, playful manner. "You
He wanted to tell the boy to stop acting so dramatic, but he knew what would happen if a dog started talking. Instead, Sirius pushed the plastic baggie at him.
Harry peered into every window, looking for something, anything, that he could buy and present to Draco. As a token of their new-found friendship, he could say. Or perhaps…
Fortunately, the stars aligned for Harry that day.
“G’night, Malfoy.” Harry muttered, putting a pillow on his head. It was so cold, even under such thick blankets.
that Draco had – so very admirable. Probably because Harry was shit at producing or recognising basic human emotion.
The next morning, Draco had yet to wake up. Remus’ explanation did little to help ease  Sirius’ conscience.
again.”
He was more like a book than ever. Appealing on the outside, yes, but the true wonder to be found within its pages.
She wiped at her eyes. “I don’t want that happening to you. So you see, my motive is very selfish.”
"Of course it is, Weasley. What do you think we are, cowards?"
Blatant favouritism is what Harry thinks it is.
“Alright, enough of that.” Sirius interrupted them before a major row could commence. “If I have to punish someone, I’ll be punishing the both of you. Right now I gotta focus on finding some light.”
"Shut up." Harry says, feeling a bit stupid. He only wants his friends to be happy. How was  he supposed to watch his friends dance around each other, so painfully in love, and not do anything about it?
He sniffled.
Sirius levitated Draco to the Rose Bedroom.
Draco looks up, hand still in the woman’s surprisingly gentle grip.
“Err…” Harry cleared his throat. “Draco and I, we made this for you. To uhh… thank you for being such bricks. We enjoyed these few days. Might’ve been some of the best days of my life.” He sounded weird, but that was the best Harry could do, being shit at emotions and all.
The warm light filtering through the rooms. Windows no longer looking like filter paper. Things appearing just when you need them.
Even Walburga was less horrible. Most of the time.
Hey! Thanks for reading :D
"Yeah." Harry's best friend shouts. He's glad he remembered the Mufflatio. "How about we leave Dean alone? Respect his privacy and all that shite?"
Draco plants a kiss on his nose. "Love you too, Harry."
) she’s been hanging out with him. And well, it’s not like she’s bad company. The opposite, actually.
“By your haphazard state,” says Draco smoothly. “I’m going to guess the Harpies won.”
He heard the crockpot boiling, and the distant sound of Teddy gurgling. Sirius let the woman in.
"Fuck you Potter." Malfoy grumbled. "May I ask of you to assist me in task for which I am inexperienced in doing?" He drawled. "Better?"
Fuck them. Draco thinks bitterly, trying to mask his fear. Hands clammy and cold. Draco could hear his heart hammering against his chest. He was shaking all over, face steeled into a monotonous look all Malfoys had mastered. His eyes gave him away, though. They always did.
“Draco.”
Sirius could almost hug him to death. Instead, he slid down to sit next to him, the fire crackling between them. An unbearable silence hung around them like a cold, wet blanket. Neither could look the other in the eye.
That didn’t look much like a dragon. And he said as much to the other boy.
They fell into a rather comfortable pace, with Draco chopping and Molly stirring. The only sounds were of the knife hitting the cutting board and the bubble of the pots. Draco had to brush his hair out of his face multiple times.
There was a silence, Malfoy hesitating. Thinking before he leapt. "Can you help me? Please?" He added for good measure.
“The wolf within him is faint but powerful. It will do anything in its power to break free on the full moon. Even if that means ripping him from the inside out. Even if it means he’ll have to go through each injury, every curse he’d suffered all over again. Until Draco is too weak to hold the wolf in.”
“Sorry we’re late!” Neville grins. “Someone pulled out a preemie Mandrake.”
Sure enough, there was the hot tub, right under the stars, as Zabini had promised.
“Just get on with it already!”
"Neville?"
“Draco disappeared halfway through the party. We thought he went up to play with his friends, but all of them were downstairs. They hadn’t seen him. We looked everywhere, and I… I found him in the basement.”
At first glance, the alleyway seemed empty. No shivering teenage boys carrying duffel bags in sight. A million thoughts raced his mind and the more logical part of his brain urged him to leave. Damn his heart. Why did he have to start feeling compassion
(See the end of the chapter for
Yes. Harry could see it. Between the four of them (and Tonks) Teddy was going to be the most loved baby in the world.
But then he does.
Soon it was time for them to board the train. Harry looked back at the castle. Really looked at it. Looked at the stone walls and those large, wooden doors. He tried, as he always did, to memorize every detail of the structure. Every crack, every bit of grime and every cobweb.
It’s okay to be vulnerable sometimes, he’d told Draco. Now he was having to take his own advice.
I thought writing Harry's POV would be easy because Harry's got fucked up feelings and I've got fucked up feelings... but the problem is that neither of us know how to express them. I don't even know
“You don’t want to have to lose your grandson again.” He words it carefully.
While the thicket and the sound of running water and such reminded him of his home, the infamous Burrow did nothing of the sort.
Sirius’ mouth went dry. Just what had Draco gone through?
“There must have been a power cut.” That was Remus.
“What?”
“Now,” he wrapped his arms around Remus, resting his head at the crook of his neck. “About those toaster pastries.”
Cooking with his grandmother.
It probably was. Harry really needed to learn to think before he leaps. Or yanks blankets in this case. Impulses. Impulses.
If this didn’t work, Dean was going to hand Harry’s pickeled head over to Hermione himself. And Harry did not want to see that day, thank you very much.
feel fine, can’t we go?” Harry didn’t like the way Millicent kept looking between him and Draco. The look on her face was unnerving. Like she knew something he didn’t.
Apparently,  Kevin McCallister was his favourite Kevin. Harry wondered if he should maybe have a  favourite Harry…
“I haven’t.”
“You can't expect to become a saint as soon as you find out you're on the wrong path. Think about this;
Sirius snorted. “Actually, James invited her home and they shagged and he made her breakfast that morning.”
"I left it at the Great Hall. Let me go get it so I can chuck it out the window." Harry  can
, if they ask. What right do you have to think you’d be less like him and more like… like
He was disappointed yet again. “Narcissa.”
Draco’s traitorous brain reminded him.
He rolls his eyes at the pining Gryffindor. "Dean, no one straight would stare a hole in your trousers. Believe me, I'm gay."
Padma swallowed. “You bring strong arguments, pasty boy.” Sure, insult the person actually dishing out sense for once. Lavender was having a bad influence on the twins.
"Too busy playing with a lifetime supply of rubber ducks to show up." Ron grumbles. "I'llhave you know mum's not pleased with your idea of an early Christmas-present."
"-as head of the boys dorm I simply must insist you take your… rebellious streak down a notch." Ernie told them off. Then, in a lower voice: "You're making me look bad in front of Lavender! I cannot afford to lose to her-"
Draco had to keep adjusting the jammies Sirius lent him. He made a mental note to take him shopping later.
"A bit jealous are we,
Sirius makes a face and goes after them, and by default, Remus does too. “Good riddance,” Tonks says poshly when Sirius leaves. She’s doing a spiffing impression of him. “That man’s worse than a PTA parent. Worst co-parent of the year.” Then she shudders. “Oh Merlin, he
"This is stupid!"
And now, Draco was asking Harry to help make it, for Moony and Padfoot. Because they deserved nothing but the best.
Sirius gestured vaguely with his hand, itching for a fag. “Don’t be. James is probably gloating about dying a hero right this moment. He’s a bastard like that.”
It took Sirius three trips before the boy started talking. Besides 'thank you' and 'sorry' I mean.
And dw. Gin is my girl and she is gonna come around soon.
Lying in bed facing each other, forcing their eyes to stay open. Draco’s cool fingers against Harry’s forehead, tracing his scar while the latter pressed his forehead against Draco’s death eater tattoo. It was too intimate a moment to have happened if they weren't half-asleep.
“So, Potter,” said Malfoy, nearly two hours after the triad left. Madam Pomfrey was keeping them because... actually, Harry didn't know why she was still making them stay. “How long do you think we’ll be stuck like this? Because I don’t think this would be very ideal for that perfect Christmas scheme of yours.”
Malfoy pulled Harry’s pillow from under his head and put it over his ears. “Must you Gryffindors be so loud?” His eyes fluttered shut.
"You can come down for breakfast when you become responsible members of society."
Neville grins, something undoubtedly Slytherin in his eyes. "Because it's true, Harry, and the truth is bitter."
watching too many soap operas. Curse Ginny and her telly. If only she  hadn't told him about Jacques and Maria, Harry wouldn't have fallen this deep. Not that he didn’t love it.
Malfoy propped his head up on an elbow and smiled at him sweetly. “It’s already been established that there is absolutely no way to reverse this, and we will have to wait it out. So I thought, why spend Christmas looking like the Dark Lord-”
Shakshouka is a family favourite and my go-to comfort food, so thought I might include that since my Harry's kinda Indian kinda Middle Eastern type idk. Also I was too lazy to find a song.
Filled with new resolve, Draco lifted his head. He didn’t turn to his Mother. He kept his eyes on Madame Archibald. Put all his energy into stopping his stammer.
“What?”
Sirius remembered to lock the door behind him before he changed back. He smelled ironically enough like a wet dog. He hoped he’d be able to shower and sneak out again before Remus woke up.
Dean rolling his eyes. And the man was four beds away!
Good news? “LAVENDER!”
“But babe,”
dirty socks.” Harry smirks. “I think I've got a pair of Krum's in there from when he and I got randy after Fleur's party."
Draco having a heart-to-heart with Molly because I want to get the awkwardness out asap to MAKE WAY FOR THE FALUFFF
“Sorry, Draco,” said Hermione before Lavender could open her mouth and once again, wreak havoc. “We were just about to leave, right Ron, Lavender?” She uses her Stern Voice, which makes the other two nod fervently. No one could fight Hermione’s Stern Voice. Not even Lavender.
Draco had his head leaned against one of the less mouldy areas of the wall. He looked almost normal in the warm clothes Remus insisted Sirius give him. That earned him a lot of questions about his 'owner' which Sirius dutifully ignored.
“Look,” Draco pointed at one of the stores. An antiques store. “Would you mind terribly if we made a quick stop there?” He made his eyes impossibly wide. It was irresistible.
Once again pulled out of his thoughts by he who plagues them. Harry chuckles. “Yeah?” He says, but the candence in his voice was hard to miss.
Mrs Weasley seemed to be leaving, so Draco pulled out whatever courage he had inside him and stopped her.
Neville places a hand on his heart. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
also I apologize for the carrot paragraphs. my inner housewife was showing :D
Tonks and Andromeda comes in through the fireplace. “Where’s my little Teddy Bear?” She spins Teddy around and round, both their hairs changing with every turn. “Guess what I’ve got for you?” Tonks says, a mischievous glint in her eyes.
“Goodnight, Potter.”
Sirius saw red.
"Come on Nev,” Harry groans. “You're supposed to say, 'what baby?'"
Harry narrowed his eyes. “How do you know about my perfect Christmas- it is not a scheme!” How dare he? It was a plan! A very well thought out, flawless plan if he did say so himself -which he did. Only, he didn't plan for a scenario where he and Malfoy would get attached at the hip. I mean, what were the odds of
Multiple pictures of the Marauders and Lily, back from when they were still at Hogwarts.
1. The sleeping figure turned out to be
Then he remembers carrying Draco back to their room after he’d fallen asleep in the lounge. The feel of Draco’s hands clutching his shirt and his sleepy warm breath against Harry’s face and neck. Mostly importantly though, the way Draco cracked an eye open and gave him a secret smile. Well, it
"I was going to insult you but right now I'm really interested in whatever this knife monopoly  is," Malfoy said.
“There.” The man has the ugliest smile. He’s addressing the court, very much like the villain in a play who monologues his greatest achievements. “The boy is guilty. Should be put in Azkaban with the rest of them.” Put
Because someone who loved you would never tell you forks are spoons.
Sirius sighs. “I promise, you won’t have to wait twelve years, Prongslet. He left to protect us. He said he doesn’t want to be the reason any of us get hurt.”
Draco stormed out, muttering curses under his breath.
It reminded him of when they went to the OB-GYN for the first time. She scanned Tonks, and Sirius had asked, in the same tone, “Is our baby…?” And the doctor nodded, causing all three parents to start crying.
“Someone convinced Padma it wasn’t such a good idea.” Parv winked at Draco and went to help her girlfriend distribute the gifts.
sleep with Krum, did you?" He grips Harry’s shirt, something scary in his blue eyes. Harry had only seen that type of look in his adoring fangirls. Thankfully Ron’s wasn’t directed at him.
And that’s how they ended up tangled in Harry’s bed, looking up at the enchanted ceiling.
Malfoy looked at him with knitted brows before saying, “did you hit your head?”
“Voldemort.”
What had Neville said? Oh, yeah. Close your eyes and keep them shut until you pass out. Maybe if Harry suffocated himself with a pillow…
Harry and Dean were alone in their dormitory – which was something that happened way too  much, considering how many others they shared the room with.
A smile tugged the corners of Harry’s lips. “You want to recreate it.”
They were just finishing up when Sirius and Remus came home.
“What do you mean?” One last time?
Draco followed the red-headed woman down the path, all the while trying not to collapse under the weight of Ginny’s shopping. The cheating bint was Levitating his trunk, and therefore had no trouble of the sort.
“Technically it was auntie Mena. We got you a kurta for when we boycott Christmas.” She said casually, as if talking about the weather.
“Neville cried,” Luna confirmed. She looks very pretty in her leather boots and sky blue jacket. There are harpies painted on the back, for her girlfriend. “Ginny’s coming straight from the game.”
"Yeah."
Then the Floo flared. “Oh, that must be Arthur. Won't be a while now,” she patted his shoulder before rushing out.
“Must you stride so fast?” Harry said when he caught up. He didn't have much far to go but still felt like whinging a bit. Just to get under Malfoy’s nerves.
“You mean the kurta?”
happening?
“Draco, I trust you.” He says, finally. “Any time you need to talk, we’ll be here.”
“It was still a thoughtful gift, Harry.” Ron hugged him. “Thanks mate.”
This was nothing like it. It was still musical and lilted, but not in the bright, summery way it used to. Narcissa’s voice was sorrowful, cold like the winter draught she’d brought in with her.
“I knew it was a bad idea – watching Mean Girls.” Draco grumbles, struggling in Harry’s grasp. “Quit it Potty. I’ll throw actual toaster strudel at you.”
Tonks had offered to do it, apparently. The Lupin-Black couple couldn’t bear to separate Teddy from her, so the three of them decided to raise him together. Teddy was going to have
could he have overlooked this? How could he have been so oblivious all this time?
“Well, you seem to rather enjoy bollocks these days,” Hermione said wryly.
Harry had said  this to Dean more times than he could count, but the Gryffindor wouldn’t budge, always coming up with some ridiculous excuse that made Harry want to bang his head on the headboard.
Draco comes home.
just a sarcastic seventeen year old after all.
“Why, thank you.”
She shrugged. “Just be yourself. He seems to like that.”
Sirius couldn’t help the smile on his face. This boy was a Black alright. Just like him.
Remus gave them a knowing smile as napkins were laid on their laps and wine filled their glasses.
Just a regular old Christmas at No.12 Grimmauld Place. Takes place five years later.
Harry sighs. "I promise."
, Draco’s brain supplied. The windows were rounded, and at least two vines were running up the walls, giving the place a rustic, Italian feel. It, like the forest around it, was revelling in end-of-summer warmth.
Cheeks full of colour and eyes gleaming with mischief. Wearing muggle clothes and spending time in the kitchen with Harry and gardening with Remus, learning to do things the muggle way. Singing to Teddy in French and bickering with Sirius about the house repairs.
Come to think of it, James would be fuming right about now. About Dumbledore’s stupid plans that put Harry in near-death situation and the likes.
For one thing, there was only one. And it was not big enough for them to build a pillow wall between them, and then not fall off the edge. In the end, they had to lie down side by side.. They agreed it was probably better to face one another than be kicked in the face.
The Gryffindor kept looking at their entangled arms,  and back to Seamus’ glowing face. Like he couldn’t quite believe it just yet.
He smelled like apples. Apples and snow. Harry was aware how crazy he was acting at that moment. But the important (and perhaps shocking) bit was that Draco had made no attempt to move away. No attempt to push Harry away.
Her shaky hand clutched Harry Potter’s green robes.
This changes nothing, Draco. How dare you think it does?” How dare he think that being bitten makes him any less human? Any less himself?
It was James looking after his friends.
Okay who cried? Because I did. Even though that makes me sound pretentious, crying over my own work like that. Oops.
“Seriously,” she huffed. “You’re so boring. Why do you always pick the bad news first?”
Harry remembers staying up trying to put the correct charms on his gift for Draco. And then nearly breaking the thing while trying to wrap it.
That’s when things get
Teddy changed his hair to match Narcissa’s salt-and-pepper locks. His eyes remained Remus’ honey brown.
She raised an eyebrow, before breaking out into smiles. “Did you get it?”
Ginny had been cool about it, but Harry later learned that she’d shut herself in the room and refused to come out. He’d caught her rummaging the fridge one nightmare ago and promptly gone back to Ron’s room.
“He’ll forgive you.” Says a voice from behind him. Luna, thankfully not upside-down this time, smiles at him. “He thinks he was protecting you. Don’t let his sacrifice go to waste. Go talk to him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sirius closed his eyes, awaiting the unavoidable ‘you escaped from Azkaban’ or ‘murderer’ that always followed his name.
“Oh Merlin, I can’t wait to tell Dean!" Harry says, just to annoy Nev.
He raised an eyebrow, Malfoy did, and slowly got off Harry. “Alright?
Sirius cleared his throat, never one to enjoy silence. “The dog that’s been helping you… he’s err... he’s my dog.”
Even after Neville leaves, Harry continues to stare down the dormitory door. He hoped that if  he stared at it long enough, maybe it would disappear. But it didn't. Which was unfair because Magic.
And thus, began a battle of pillow-throwing and whoever managed to shout the loudest.
Harry felt guilty leaving Draco out of his letters, but the less his friends knew about Draco, the better.
Ron is determined to stay un-understood, unfortunately.
“Harry?”
“Did you,” drawls Wimbledon, smug bastard. Hadn’t a hair on his head, he. “Or did you not take the Dark Mark.”
Things were finally working out! For the both of them! Harry couldn’t wait to tell Dean about  him and
. It was horrifying. Draco certainly didn’t deserve that sort of sentiment.
“What… what do you mean?” He asks. This felt like one of those instances where Curiosity would kill the cat. And yet, the cat goes into the den anyway.
Draco looks at her warily but sees nothing but genuine concern in her face. Somehow she managed to remind him of both his mother and Professor McGonagall. It was overwhelming.
Draco turned to enter when Sirius grabs his shoulder. "Yes?"
they were. Why, why couldn’t they lash out? Why can’t they demand to know why Harry didn’t reply to their owls? Why did they have to be such perfect parents?
If you liked this chapter, let me know! Also I am not sorry for procrastinating for thirteen whole days and then making y'all cry (I hope?)
“I’d always thought Shakshouka to be a breakfast thing.” He grinned evilly, adding an absurd amount of eggs to his plate. “This makes it even better!”
The couple went outside, but Draco could see from their animated gestures that it wasn’t just a lover’s quarrel.
“I know this is sudden… and probably peculiar,” Draco was saying. “But we’ve got along surprisingly well these few days.”
They were working on repairing the first-floor bathroom, which turned out to be a more difficult ordeal than Harry would’ve expected. Even with magic!
by Josephine Lyson.  “I’ll have you know I spent two hours sucking up to a hundred-year-old witch for this.” He’d told her. “All for Rosie.”
Well, I guess this is goodbye?
He’d been given a chance to start over, with a family that cared for him. Why should Draco be any different? Sirius was sure his parents would have been part of Voldemort's little coterie had they been alive. Would that have changed anything to the Marauders? He liked to think not.
Harry found he quite liked the new décor. Sirius mentioned Malfoy sweet-talking Walburga into letting them fix the house up. Yeah, Harry could see the ponce doing that. Disgusting. Ickle Draco and auntie Walburga.
“Well, how was I supposed to know that?” Malfoy hissed. "I was just trying to get the pastries out."
"Why don't I show you to the loo?" Said Sirius, leading his guest up the stairs. He didn’t think he could stand anymore teasing from Remus.
“Mother,” Draco says, finally. “Mother and father will be in grave danger if I don’t go back. I don’t want to be responsible for their sufferings.”
Hannah, from her spot on the yellow sofa the Hufflepuffs adopted as their own, giggled a little. She had a large magnifying glass and notepad beside her, which was odd. But not by Hannah standards.
It was obvious they had spotted him.
Harry figures if he runs fast enough he might be able to reach the apparition point and then  grab an international portkey to
"Only if you swear not to tell Ron it's his jam we're using."
"Right then, I reckon it can't be too hard to get Malfoy's face sewn on a sweater."
Harry blushed - partly because Ron was right and partly because everyone was staring at his sweater now. It was the Chudley Cannons one Ron gave him for his birthday and Harry thought he'd got rid of it, but somehow it ended up in the bottom of his trunk. Draco had used a sticking charm to attach a mirror to the front.
… right after he fixed his birds-nest of a hair.
“Are you really going to make me do that?” Malfoy made a face at the plastic board.
He had to cut the shirt. Peel the bloody cloth from Draco's tattered body.
This was a jambled mess. And I am not sorry.
It was a dusty old thing, covered in cobwebs he was far too familiar with. That was probably what drew him in. The thing was a snowglobe that, after a vigorous wipe with his sleeve, revealed a tiny knight and a dragon. They were in a field of snow, both braced for attack.
"Does it include making weird sounds so they think we're up to something?"
The scene played over and over in his head. The hungry looks Greyback kept sending him. Bellatrix's maniacal laughter and he writhed and screamed. Being shoved at Voldemort’s feet and forced to protstrate, to beg.
“You need to retrace your steps, meet every person you’ve met once more and walked past every building. Go back to the crossroad, back to the beginning. Then, you have to choose a path for yourself.”
“My father wanted me to join the dark faction. Like, how can you even think they’re right? The leader calls himself the
Harry nodded. It had been weird. He tried to think of Hermione and Ron’s reaction. It didn’t look good.
Harry grinned. “That’s a turtleneck. I think it might suit you.” He froze, thinking of what he had just said.
it was just worse a shriek.
“Only if you promise not to eat any batter.”  Molly admonishes him. “Draco. You can keep an eye on the little devil.”
“What?”
Sirius wondered what his godson’s reaction would be if Draco was gone by morn. Gone like a dream. A dream that turns into a nightmare when you wake up.
children. I called Granger a… I called her horrible things. I’m bigoted and a Death Eater and I…”
Draco winced at the mention of Dumbledore.
“Well,” Draco smiled and Harry's temper melted away instanty. “Professor Lupin made this really good curry thing the first day I was here. We had it with bread, on the floor with a palette box as a table. It was the best meal I’ve ever had.” He had a faraway look in his eyes, like he was already tasting it.
have an incurable dick disease?  “Draught… forcefield…
“You got that right, ‘lil Red.” and judging by the look on Ron’s face, he did not like the new nickname.
“I like him.” Harry blurts. They’ve coaxed him into the living room. “I like him the way you like Moony. I
Thanksgiving was still a Weasley affair, though.
“And that’s how you did, basically.” Luanne, the owner’s daughter smiled at them. “You understood, right?”
It wants him to rush in. Be rash. Hurry. Fast. Fast.
When Harry wakes up, he wakes up feeling cold. Empty.
“Wait here.” Said Potter. “I’ll be right back.”
"Ron, they're not shagging."
“Go away,” He said softly, not quite meeting Sirius’ eye. His skin blotched red in some places. Bruises only just starting to heal. The boy’s eyes sunk in and his cheeks were hollow.
Well, if turning on the light reveals a ginger-hell then Draco’s perfectly fine with living in the dark, thank you very much.
Harry didn’t feign surprise. In fact, he wondered why it took Hermione as long as she did to figure it out. “What do you think I should do about it.”
He curled up on the bed, far too used to taking up minimal space back at his cell.
When they made it down, they nearly crashed into Pansy and Lavender. The two girls were in the middle of a glaring match because they were both wearing the same sexy santa dresses (which even Harry was sure did not count as semi-formal. Maybe).
"Are you…" It was funny how easily Ron's face went green. He really was like a lanky, overly freckled chameleon. "Is that knife real?" Ron pointed at the knife Malfoy was holding.  The blond was running his fingers over the tip.
“I just think alchemy has a lot more potential than just the Philosophers Stone,” Draco said, dipping his bread into the shakshouka. He had to roll his sleeve up to stop any getting on them.
Ron cleared his throat, a funny expression on his face. “Sorry mate, but you do.”
“Right.” She says, still smiling. “I’ll get the paperwork sorted now. And remember I’ll be dropping in to check on from time to time. If I’m not available, it’ll have to be Wimbledon I’m afraid.”
Sirius was in the living room, bouncing Teddy on his lap. Remus was in the kitchen, making Shakshouka.
It was nearly dusk when the bus finally came to a stop.
His mind drifted the hours of putting up with verbal abuse. Hiding under his bed until she gone. James healing his bruises when he went back to Hogwarts.
Hermione waved them over to the snack table. “Can you guys watch Ron for a few minutes? Millie asked me to dance with her.” Mione was wearing a sparkly red dress that ended just below her knees, paired with heels that had Christmas lights twirled around her legs. There were some lights braided into her hair too.
“Since when are you a professional sledder?” Harry shouted, ducking his face behind Malfoy to avoid windburn or whatever it was. “You said you’ve never sled before.”
“You bastard.” He mumbled into Harry’s yellow robes. “You utter bastard, I hate you.”
At last, they hit a tree or something (another boulder?) and the snow broke away, freeing them from the ice cold vortex of death.
Harry was sure the fact that she was doing a handstand and painting the ceiling with her feet when she said it wouldn’t affect her judgment.
The pillow hits him square on the face. Somehow Harry ended up with a mouthful of pillow.  He can hear Dean’s guffaws as he sputters out a few stray feathers that managed to land in his  mouth. Fuck Neville for never mending that tear, Harry thinks fondly.
The house looked the same, with the teal walls and golden finishes, but somehow, it felt dimmer. Like darkness had found its way into the house. Covered it like smog, thick and suffocating.
Except this was Malfoy, and he definitely didn't want to kiss Harry. Clarisse might've gotten her dream snog, but Harry's was going to stay a fantasy. Well, Harry hoped not.
“I am not my mother, and I am not my father either. I’m sick of being told what to do. Made felt like everything I say is wrong. I didn't want to be defined by their actions… blamed for their mistakes...So I ran away.”
that distinguished them from other people. No one could be entirely sure what it was.
That seemed to be the last straw. Sirius had successfully cracked him. Now the dam overflowed.
“It’s okay, Draco. I’m here. You’re here. We’re both here and we’re okay. We’re safe. We don’t have anything to worry about. Safe, Draco. Safe. It’s okay to feel vulnerable sometimes.”
“Malfoy?”
“Tonks?” He says, recognizing her bright pink hair. “Tonks carried your baby?”
"So," Harry turned to Draco. "Should we tell them I asked you out during the knife monopoly  game or should we wait until they let us out? Which is never?" Trust the soap opera fanatic to be overdramatic.
He blanked. “I… uh…”
There was a sharp intake of breath as Remus took in the scars. The flesh was a ghastly puce from where the teeth had sunken in. Around it, claw marks, jagged and deep spelt words like
“That’s not even a movie!” Blaise launches the offensive. “Even Gregory’s Girl is better than that one.”
“Oh,” said Harry, leafing through his notes. He tried to ignore the heat in his cheeks, and the eyes of a certain blond (hint: it’s not Neville).
Harry drags a hand across his face. His heart pounds against his chest and something pulses in his head. He doesn’t want to feel this pathetic.
Draco flopped on the bed as soon as she closed the door. He didn’t even bother taking his robes off. Just toed off his shoes and socks.
Harry slipped his orange Chudley Cannons sweater (courtesy of Ron) over his shoulders and shrugged his trousers off. He folded them neatly before stepping into the warm waters. Wearing those swim trunks over his pants that morning was the best decision he’d probably made in like, ever.
Draco wiped his eyes. He looked at Harry meaningfully.
Sirius found ‘Them’ to be an awfully nostalgic word. He knew exactly who Draco was talking about and that hurt. To think that someone had to go through what he did, maybe even worse, made his shoulders feel heavy in a way they hadn’t in a long time.
Hermione and Ron came to sit with him, and Malfoy had turned to speak to Blaise. There was no one around to save Harry from his friends.
- The sight of Malfoy snoring on his chest, Harry’s jumper curled in his fists.
Harry couldn’t help but shout, “Then what the bloody hell are you doing?”
“Merlin forbid I ever have to go through

constellation?”
“With my entire being.” He answered readily.
And well, this might not have been the family Harry dreamed about as a child or the one he saw in the Mirror of Erised, but it was a family. And a darn good one at that.
Mother was in full black silk. She looked drawn and tired. Ancient. They only allowed Narcissa to attend his trial to testify.
Tell me what you guys think?
Sirius pulled him in for a hug. Worry was an emotion they felt constantly. It may be for Harry. For their relationship or even the war.
“Harry, wake up!”
Malfoy reddened and Harry knew he was holding back a snarky comment.Like he was going to explode. Then, he did something very uncharacteristic.
“Sleep well?”
“And then the wolf will break free, killing Draco in the process.”
Harry was so going to tease Dean later.
"GERONIMO!"
Harry glanced to his side to see Draco smiling, his face and hair lit in a warm glow from the fireplace. He looked very unreal, sitting at the dining table of No.!2 Grimmauld Place, wearing muggle clothes and a pair of Harry's woolly socks (that Draco doesn't know are his).
Harry turned to Ron. "Sorry, mate. An eye for an eye and all that bullshit." They locked the door in his face.
But before he could carry out any not-thought-out Foolish Action, Malfoy’s eyes fluttered open and they were suddenly as far from each other as they could get without the nausea.
Dean, on the other hand, was blatantly trying to avoid it. Thus the sticky situation they were  in.
It was well lit for one thing. Harry couldn’t see any dusty old windows. Just obscenely clean ones.
Draco made a sound of protest. All the laughter and jokes gone and a monotonous mask in its place. He looked distant, face paler than ever as he tugged at the sleeve. He quivered a little, Sirius noticed.
“Well, guess what? So do I.”
Or it just might’ve been the fact that Harry expected there to be more talking and teasing between them. Even after the whole potion fiasco.
Harry might only know these things because Parkinson liked to tease Draco about it in the hallways, but he found that vehemence – that burning

The boy in question swallowed thickly. “It’s true that I have a mark. Many actually, but not the kind you think I do.” He displayed his forearm, eyes closed.
And when Harry put his hand through Draco’s hair, everything in the world felt right. He couldn’t quite explain it, but it just did. He wouldn’t have minded spending the rest of eternity with Draco’s head in his lap, fingers curled in blond hair that resembled the snow, but was softer than it could ever hope to be.
the mark,” Draco says quietly.
“If you think it means I feel the same way for you, then yes. If not-'' Harry doesn't get a chance to finish his sentence as Draco pulls him into a bone-crushing embrace.
“It’s the bloody onions, Potter,” he sniffed. “They’re stinging my eyes.”
Harry wonders why it took him so long to realize that.
“You both have been dating since… since Teddy!”
“He’s fine?” Draco said, sounding shocked.
Loved and accepted. Being made to feel like he could change the world.
Dean, Neville and Ron bust into the room. The latter of which was covering his eyes. "Harry, I hope you're decent."
Harry could only imagine how sexy he’d look, covered in a sheen of sweat. His pale blond  hair sticking to his face. Fucking ethereal.
"I have just the thing."
He tiptoed over to the figure, accidentally got mud on the new-looking burgundy rug (which he felt pretty bad for), and pulled (more like roughly yanked) the blanket off.

than sleepy, but still. Mrs Weasley had asked him to help out. And since he was so susceptible to doing favours for matronly figures, he just had to help out.
whole years there and came out fine. Draco, on the other hand, could hardly speak a word without bursting into tears. All his emotions were in shambles. He found himself flinching every time someone came near. The Dementors weren’t there anymore, but he still relived every bad thing he’d ever done. Soaked in guilt and sweat every night until he passed out. A part of him knew he deserved it. But that didn’t mean he still didn’t hate it.
Draco snorts from beside him. He crosses his arms, hiding the ‘D’ Harry knew to be on his baby blue Weasley sweater. “This Christmas party is so cliché.” He drawls.
When he moved his hands, the chains around his wrists clanged. They made a sickening sound every time they made contact with the witness box.
“I wouldn’t go as far as to say Knife Monopoly gets you laid, but yes, Knife Monopoly gets you laid.” Says Draco, coming over to rest his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
“Sirius?” his voiced echoed in the hallway. The darkness seemed to push against him, cold grip tightening around his body.
“I’ll take it, thanks.” Okay, Malfoy, no need to be so crabby. “Here comes Pomfrey to say we can go.”
Of course she did. “Well, it suits you just fine, Potter.”
" Ron replied. "Don't worry, I'll let you kiss his arse a couple times after I win." It was a bit scary how like Malfoy he sounded then.

Harry could hear the ten year old monster now. It was growing stronger each second. “So this Shakshouka, it’s not for celebration, but for condolence?”
Draco had always been closer to Remus, than to Sirius himself, but now, with the blond boy in his arms, Sirius felt certain Draco trusted him just as much.
She just smiled and waved at Hermione, who blushed. “Sorry, but you can’t fight this ass, Ronnie-kins.” Lav shakes her hips to prove her point.
Harry grins widely. "You're dating Blaise!” He exclaims. “Of course, you are. Who else would love both Herbology and Quidditch?”
He sounded amused - like he couldn’t believe the both of them were fooling around in the kitchen again. Harry couldn’t quite wrap his mind around it either, this weird relationship he’d formed with Draco. What he did know was he would protect this bond with everything in his heart. It was stupid and Gryffindorish. But that was Harry - the lord of all things stupid.
Within seconds, Sirius is at his side. Arm around his shoulder. Comforting, Harry realizes with an angry shudder. They were trying to comfort him.
What do you guys think of Harry?
“G’mornin’ ‘arry.” He mumbled, rubbing his eyes.
Unaware of Harry’s apparent crisis, Malfoy continues. "Well didn’t anyone tell you doormen were supposed to let people

across the room. He runs to pick it up again, but physically recoils when he gets close to the pile of socks Harry kept at the foot of his bed. It was quite the collection, and Harry was rather proud of it.
“You know, sometimes love leaves you, even when it’s right.” Sirius put an arm around him. Harry let himself find refuge in the familiar and comforting smell of magnolia and dog Sirius carried.
“You’re a wizard Padfoot,” Remus said dryly. “You have a wand. And you learnt
Teddy squeals. “Chocolate!”
He shrugged and walked to the hot tub, Harry following, stunned. Draco Malfoy, not putting up a fight? This week just kept getting weirder and weirder.
Everyone was starting to dance again, so Harry and Draco decided to go out on the veranda for some quiet. Except-
Harry watches, mouth agape, as she climbs aboard a Thestral, disappearing into the night sky. He doesn’t know if she’s talking about Sirius or Draco. All he sees is what he’s been missing.
Well, Ron, Neville and the rest of the eighth years (and any younger students staying for Christmas) were looking at him weird.
Narcissa Malfoy was seated where he had left her. It was as if she hadn’t even blinked. Or breathed, for that matter. Her eyes flicked to Teddy, who was perched on Sirius’ hip. They softened.
"Two."
Draco leads them to the Rose Bedroom, on the topmost floor. The only thing above this floor was the rooftop, where Harry liked to climb when he had nightmares.
“You’re impossible, Potter.” Said Malfoy, shaking his head. “Do you even own a proper coat?” He starts filing through Harry’s things, throwing clothes and books everywhere.
Harry thinks the worst of it is over, but then it's not.
back by unpopular demand: me.
It’s all the dysfunctionality, the ability to get along even when they’re all so very different, that’s family. It’s staying together even when you have different ideas. Pulling each other out of trenches and making meals that bring back memories. Sharing quilts and secrets. Keeping the knives at bay.
Then he remembered.
Sirius found himself tackled by a very worried werewolf. Smiling gingerly, he dragged muddy fingers through Remus’ hair. “Moony, I-”
“Well,” The boy played with his dirty fingers. “He’s been great company. Thank you.”

Like that’s what-what… ” Draco choked, burying his face in Remus’ shoulder as the latter had pulled him for a hug.
Sirius found the boy huddled near the unlit fireplace when he came down to get milk for Teddy. He was muttering something about not being able to say goodbye. He looked so terribly distressed. “I do Sirius. I do need to thank you, and I need to give back.”
This place was nothing like his cell, obviously. For some reason, the pillows smelled like treacle tart. It was a welcome smell, and Draco found himself burying his nose deep into it.
Draco swallowed. He bit his lip and then glanced around as if waiting for masked maniacs to appear any second. “What’s the catch?”
Remus didn’t have dark circles around his eyes anymore. He didn’t look back after every step and he didn’t mind when Sirius jumped on his back whilst cooking.

my only son,” Narcissa said eloquently.
Harry had no problem telling him so either. "You idiot! You don't shove forks into toasters! You get electrocuted, and the power goes out." And if someone called Harry an idiot for stating the obvious, he'd let it slide.
