Draco dumped the box out onto their bed and quickly pulled out random potions and oils that had probably not aged well. “I don’t even want to see how old these are, and anything I made would be better anyway.”
“Hogwarts this year. Hermione and Neville are going back. Hannah Abbott and I think Ernie MacMillan too. Probably several Ravenclaws. Hermione almost cried when she got her letter. Ron was already refusing before he even opened it.” He grinned at the last, looking at Draco as if they had a joke to share.
like something straight out of fifteen twenty-five.”
on you. I just want to know what’s going on here.”
“Yes it is,” Draco said, still smiling. “That’s good too.” He laid down on his bed and patted the covers next to him. “Come lay down with me.”
“I’ll come with you,” Potter said. Draco nearly protested, but given the roiling in his stomach, perhaps supervision for safe travel wouldn’t go amiss.
“I feel like I should be embarrassed but that was… just about the hottest thing. Better than I imagined.”
Six months ago Draco thought he’d be dead by now. Instead, he had Harry Potter asking him if he had a pencil sharpener for his coloured pencils. Draco spelled all the pencils sharp and wondered if they should get an actual pencil sharpener the kids could use themselves.
Draco swept his hand across his remaining four cups, knocking them to the floor. “I win again!” He laughed so hard he had tears in his eyes. “Off with your pants, dearest husband!”
“Of course you can?” Draco raised one eyebrow, just to rile up his husband. “Bold words from a man that’s never been in this position before.”
But he was too distracted by the delicious mouthful of Draco’s cock to really care.
“I have my ways. Andromeda will be here any minute.”
“There’s a café near my flat that makes a delicious key lime pie, if you’d like to join me sometime?” Draco offered this up hesitantly, watching Ron and Harry for signs that he’d made the right move.
“It’s nothing unusual, of course. Three months of courtship following the traditional rules. In six weeks, I will return and see how you two are getting on.” She stared down her nose at Harry, despite being several inches shorter than him. “If you are deemed worthy of my son, we can begin discussions of a betrothal contract to follow.”
Daphne offered a soothing rub down Pansy’s back. “Of course it won’t. Draco’s going first and he can help the rest of us prepare.”
Harry waved that off. “It’s going to be fine.”
Draco on a date, to actually plan the thing.
“That’s what Draco said.” Harry crossed to his dresser and pulled out the flat jewellry box. “He said it was more of a ‘thank you for your kindness’ situation.” He held the box out to her. “So I bought this for you. To thank you.”
Harry nearly crashed them to the ground in his haste to get off the broom. “Yeah, so I changed my mind.”
Hopefully the suite would be suitable for the family until Leila’s parents felt healed and settled enough to find employment and a place of their own. Pansy had feelers out for potential jobs, depending on their mental health after a year of Azkaban. The dementors had fled but that didn’t mean the prison had improved in any way.
And Orion, bless his innocent heart, smiled his drooly smile and leaned into her hands. Ms Coddle plucked him from Jason’s hands and bounced him lightly. “You are such a big boy, aren’t you?”
“Not gonna lie,” Harry said, “but I
“We need to clean you,” Draco said softly, running a hand up Harry’s cock. A perfect distraction!
“Well, no, Draco. Actually, I
that drowned out the small lamps.
Behind him, Potter opened his mouth to speak but Auror Reed glared at him and he stayed silent. They probably blamed Potter for Draco’s freedom in the first place. He’d seen enough ugly stares to know there were many that shared his sentiments. But Draco was free, and didn’t have to cower when he’d done nothing wrong.
“Kinky sod,” Draco laughed as he straddled Harry’s hips. “It’s cold out here with no covers.”
“This list has been loads of fun. You’ve had fun with it, haven’t you?”
“The contract says I get to take Draco on outings and my only opportunity is once a week to Hogsmeade,” Harry insisted. “Again, you don’t get to decide these things. I do.”
“Of course it did,” Draco sighed. He tucked Harry into bed and said, “I’ll be right back.”
“Shall we owl them and see?”
Of course, how silly of him not to consider the list. He made a mental note to ask Harry for the rest of the list so he could read it all at once and not be surprised by shit anymore.
“I think he genuinely wants to play?” Draco answered. “Does that sound right?”
“Thanks for having me.” He reached out and pulled a flower from Draco’s hair. “This one came loose.” He twirled the flower in his fingers and then tucked it behind his own ear.
“I don’t understand what’s happening here.”
“No, it’s just… There’s a collection going around. For some of the kids left—you know—since May. And… you seem to have taken all the chocolate frogs.”
Pansy forced a smile to her face. “Wouldn’t you rather get a bath?”
Also, Draco rarely suggested activities for them to fill the hours and rather let Harry decide what they did with their free time. It reminded Harry more of their friendship before the life debt, when Draco simply enjoyed hanging out with Harry. Especially since Harry was back to mooning over Draco from across the eighth years’ common room and wishing he could snog Draco’s pretty face.
“You’re here early,” Draco laughed, rifling through the box.
Harry whooped and yanked his t-shirt off, throwing it in the general vicinity of their other dirty clothes on his way to the bathroom. Draco kicked the shirt into the pile and added his own t-shirt and jeans. Ugh, their hike had made him sweaty in the worst sort of way. He peeled off his damp socks with a shudder.
“Always. Forever.” Harry didn’t know where his jacket ended up and he’d lost the bowtie long ago. He began unbuttoning his shirt. “This feels so new. We’ve never been together like this.”
“The answer is yes. It’s always yes.”
“Hmm, seems duelling is sexier than we thought,” Draco whispered, nuzzling against Harry’s ear.
“Yes, well… circumstances and…” Ms Coddle adjusted her glasses, glancing over Draco’s shoulder at Greg, Jason, and Alex.
He tried not to crow at Theo’s sour look. “It’s fine,” Theo bit out. “I can skip it for a few weeks.”
He tried not to think about how it was his own fault Draco wasn’t with him now.
“Oh Merlin,” Hermione sighed, “is that the silhouette of two boys kissing on those lanterns?”
But Harry had been in plenty of stupid and impossible situations and he would find a way around it, just as he always did.
“Maybe for your birthday we can do both.”
“Tonight we play with…” Harry brandished a colourful tentacle dildo that Draco hadn’t seen in a million years. “The Giant Squid!”
With eyes blinded and hands tied behind his back, my beautiful, obedient lover sinks to his knees.
Draco gave him one last smile and whirled away.
“Sod off, it’s been fun,” Harry laughed. “I see now I was short-sighted…”
“The inspection? What the fuck does that have to do with anything? Why aren’t you getting in that pretty boy’s pants?”
Harry stood to wash out the shampoo, grinning as suds ran down his body. His fingers chased them over his chest. “Mm… sexy suds… Do I look like something out of a magazine?”
I hate displays of my vampire abilities and all the ways they point to me not being fully human. Although I might have to rethink that if it gets Simon this hot.
“You are so warm,” Draco murmured, nuzzling Harry’s neck.
Ron’s jaw dropped open in shock. He turned to Harry. “Not fair! ‘Mione and I helped you too!”
“No, of course not! But even
“We’re out of crisps,” Greg said from his spot splayed out on the floor.
“Right,” Draco said softly, hoping to set her at ease. “I’m sure it’s fine. Why don’t we go back to the house and get you two cleaned up. We’ll see if we can heal Robbie.”
“It’ll be dinner time when the train arrives. We’ll have most of the day.”
“You are so fucking gorgeous,” Harry said, moving a lock of wet hair off Draco’s face. “Just so…
“I’m sure they painted over it for resale value.”
“Me too.” Draco glanced over his shoulder at the pub, as if he might say more about Ginny, but then let it drop. “It was good to see you, Harry.”
Mrs Stokke harrumphed and made another note. Auror Blakely glared at Draco and Harry for the point in their favour.
burned in his raw throat. And in his broken heart, when he thought of his mother’s fate.
Draco swung the gate open and said, “Welcome to Malfoy Manor. Are you looking for a place to stay?”
After so long together, Harry knew Draco didn’t mean it to disparage muggles. He meant that muggle ceremonies had no place in the wizarding world. But that wasn’t entirely true.
“You took it with you?! Oh Merlin, I’m never going to hear the end of it now. I’m guessing there wasn’t much discussion of ‘The Magic in your Heart’ going on.”
Harry flicked his tongue out, almost feeling ridiculous for swirling it through air around Draco’s cock. But only almost, because Draco’s moans increased in pitch and his body began to tremble all over. Harry backed away just as a garbled yell tore itself from Draco’s throat and his hand pumped furiously at his throbbing cock, spilling come all over his hand and belly.
“Yes, good idea.”
“I don’t think this is a
“Do you do this often?” Potter asked, following him out of the ice cream shop.
because they hadn’t seen it in a while and because once the tea kicked in the terrible cinematography would be hilarious.
“Uh-uh,” Draco tsked as Harry ran a hand down Draco’s chest. “Wash first. I’m not sucking anything until it’s squeaky clean.”
“Harry!” Draco said in surprise.
“You saw me? When? I don’t—” Draco shook his head. “I don’t wear shit like this,” he added, throwing the panties to the floor.
(2:07 pm) I’ve given up on the kitten. I’ll save that drawing for an angrier story.
“And the Minister said—” Potter began, but Granger laid a hand on his arm to quiet him when that only made Blakely’s face a darker red.
--------
“Right, yes, of course. This was fun,” Draco said to their end of the table. “Thanks for inviting us. This is certainly not something fifteen year old me ever imagined occurring. But it was fun.”
“What was what?” Draco asked sleepily.
“Maybe next time,” Potter shrugged, dropping the ball and kicking it away. He glanced back with a look Draco didn’t understand.
“I wish I could kiss you.”
Dev and Niall blink at me a few times, then look at each other, and back to me.
“Good times,” Harry responded with as much calm as he could muster. The cycle always seemed to begin this way—with a reminder that they once had something special. He remembered their shared excitement over the first run of Molly Meow stuffed animals, and the picture of him in this hoodie with Molly. But after a week of texting Draco, he also remembered Ginny’s impatience with the pictures Harry continued taking for his blog, urging him to leave off and come to dinner instead.
“Yeah, no, of course I don’t want you to lie to her or anything. I already have a ring and everything so I can stage some kind of fun, public thing.”
“Yeah,” Harry rasped out. He cleared his throat. “Yeah, let’s give that a try.”
“Yeah, you too,” Harry lied. He focused his attention on his newspaper, hoping to hide the blush on his cheeks. He wanted to be grateful for this moment together, but embarrassment over their last encounter threatened to choke him. His brain, in a desperate bid to win Draco back, almost blurted out that he wasn’t
“Of course not. I’m looking at the long game.” But Draco couldn’t resist running a hand down Harry’s chest anyway. Damn, his husband was fit.
They argued back and forth until they’d reached an equilibrium neither of them liked - too cold for Harry, too hot for Draco.
It didn’t help that Draco gave him a wicked smile. “Oh Harry, don’t you know I think of you every time I play?”
Draco sat with his head in his hands, focusing on his breathing. In and out. Slow and steady. Fuck if he was going to have a breakdown in this shabby Ministry hallway. His lungs rattled in his chest on the inhale. His throat burned like fire on the exhale. Slow and steady. In and out.
“Ugh, I’m not doing homework on a Saturday morning. What do you normally do on Saturdays?”
Harry almost laughed at the formal language. Who the fuck said ‘post haste’ anymore? But Draco’s stomping off to his room without a goodnight to anyone didn’t bode well. Neither did Theo grinning with malicious glee.
a life debt? She turned a cold stare on him and offered her hand without a smile.
“He joined my book club,” Draco said smoothly, settling back in his chair so that his shoulder rested against Harry’s. “We’re discussing Jane Austen’s
“Theo,” Narcissa said curtly. “Just in time. They’ve finished signing the contract.”
“And anyway,” Ginny went on, “why would a dog and a cat get married? Aren’t dogs and cats supposed to hate each other?”
, that was hot. Harry was going to tease him until the end of time about this and Draco thought he might not care at all. He teased Harry often enough, he could give Harry this.
“Yes. Muggle clothes.” Draco handed out jeans and t-shirts, trousers and button-down shirts. “It’s easier to acquire.” He wrinkled his nose at a bright orange buttoned shirt. Pansy flicked her wand and transfigured it to a deep green. “I’m sure we’ll all adjust.”
Draco smiled widely. “Of course I am. Although I’m also wondering how I could fall in love with someone so utterly ridiculous as to have a memorial—”
“Unfortunately, no. Sorry,” he said, when Draco’s shoulders drooped. “But at least we’re alone, right? This’ll be nice? Without Theo hanging around. That prick.”
Draco, already in pyjamas, wondered if he should start getting naked, but then decided he’d rather have clothes on for whatever unexpected thing might happen next.
“And now we add the butter to the batter,” Simon almost sings, pointing vaguely behind him.
“Oh Annabelle absolutely did. It’s Christmas and they’re expecting a baby just after the new year. I did the maths and they can’t be expecting a baby in January unless they had some fun times during his service in April.”
Thanks in advance to CleopatraIsMyName for the beta of this project I decided to take on at the last minute!
“It’s Pansy’s favourite guilty pleasure. They report on social standings—who is dating who, what marriages are on the rocks, and who gets the galleons in the split. And they don’t care one whit about honesty and accuracy. It’s just the worst. Be glad you haven’t seen it.” He stumbled over nothing and leaned into Potter’s steadying hand. “You’re going to have to Apparate me home.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you sure that’s safe?”
Somewhere along the way, they managed to lose their wet t-shirts. Draco had purposefully not worn any pants under his joggers and the damp material clung to his cock in a way he knew distracted Harry. Duelling could be just as physical as it was magical, and so Draco crowded him to make it difficult to cast and knocked him off balance with a hard bump of his hips. Anything to rub his body along Harry’s.
“Fuck! Okay, it’s fine.” He scanned the parchment, but the words blurred. “We can get him back. Do you know where they took him?”
(5:55 pm) It will be.
“That has to be the worst euphemism I’ve ever heard.”
“That flush in your cheeks and the sweat in your hair. Who’s to say if it’s duelling or fucking, right? But it’s not quite the same in
They had to wait for everyone to head off to lunch. Draco rolled his hips provocatively, then turned in Harry’s lap so they sat facing each other. “Want to skip lunch and go to your room instead? I could take care of this for you.”
“There’s going to be repercussions,” Draco couldn’t help but caution.
“And why would I do that?”
“Then let me in. Please…”
“Just… brace yourself for disappointment, all right?” He sighed. “And I hope you enjoy celibacy,” he added with an eye roll.
“I will definitely keep it in mind.” Harry cleaned up their sticky mess, then noxed the lights. The covers rustled as they settled into their usual spooning positions, with Harry as the little spoon. He laced their fingers together against his chest. “I’m glad you’re having fun with this game.”

Harry preferred to sit diagonally back from Malfoy so it could
“Me too.” He patted her hand and kissed the top of her head. “Me too.
“Oh.” He twisted his hands in the hem of his jumper and then pointed vaguely down the hall. “I guess I’ll… go find the kids then.”
“Oh!” Harry perked up at the mention of the violin he rarely got to hear.
and so began an on-again-off again thing they’d been unable to escape.
Theo checked his pocket watch three times over the next ten minutes.
He reassured the others that it was fine, even if he couldn’t be sure that was true.
“We’re not werewolves!” Jane burst out, her face reddening.
“Right. Of course.” Draco parted his shirt and laid flat on his back. “Fuck, I knew you’d find a way.”
Draco shrugged, “Not much different from the others we’re caring for, right?” The Gibbon girls ran by at that moment. At six years old, the twins treated the seemingly endless halls and rooms in the Manor as a wondrous play place.
“I know it was a weird thing to do,” Harry said evenly. Draco didn’t ask but Harry felt the need to explain anyway. “The thing is… Everything, and I mean
“If he asks, we just sat and stared at each other in silence the whole time.”
Draco pulled their joined hands out. “What if you were tied to me?”
“I survived. And I won in the end because I have you. None of that matters anymore.”
“What?” Harry gasped, coughing up a bit of toast that caught in his throat. And was that—yes, Draco’s hand was on Harry’s
“I believe the situation is under control. The Aurors insisted on special paperwork being filed—which I’ve already taken care of—and special approval by the Wizengamot. There’s no reason to expect a rejection. It’s just all taking a bit longer than I anticipated.”
“After breakfast, I thought we could head to the library,” Hermione said, making both Ron and Harry groan. “Enough of that! Madam Pince said she’d set aside two books for me for our Transfiguration essay. They could be very helpful!”
But as they settled into bed, Harry pulled him close with a contented sigh. “This was the best day I’ve ever had.”
Potter.
Werewolf scratches.
Mid-June was entirely too hot for a fire, but Harry set extra cooling charms around the flat to make cosying up by the fireplace more enticing.
to Lucius and the pieces of Draco he tried to break.
“I want to. And anyway, I don’t have anything to do tomorrow so I can sleep all day. The others have the kids to look after. They deserve a full night’s rest.” He nudged Draco’s shoe with his own. “You do too, but I know you wouldn’t let me stay here alone.”
Harry rubbed his sweaty palms on his jeans and accepted one last encouraging nod from Ron. Easy, no big deal… he could do this.

“Has anything been
Still laughing like fools, they ran for the bedroom, peeling off their remaining clothes along the way.
Harry pulled Draco flush against his chest. “What are you doing?” he whispered in Draco’s ear. His hand tightened on Draco’s hip. “Not getting dressed are you?”
Slowly Potter rose from his chair and pointed at Draco’s seat. “Do you mind if I…? Can I sit with you?”
Draco sighed as he opened the last box of shrivelfigs in the storage room, and found four already missing. He made a mental note to remind Claudia and Gregory to add it to the order form as soon as they opened the last of anything, and then added shrivelfig to the order form in his hand.
“I, er, didn’t know anything was up?”
“I want to fuck you somewhere cheerier and brighter.”
When I caught him with a hand down his trackies, scrolling on his phone with the other, I thought I’d startle him with, “Starting without me?” But instead he kept stroking his cock without pause.
He heaved himself from the bench, trying to smooth the lank, oily strands of his hair and the fall of his school robes. His
But the best is when his hands close over mine as they grip the sheets and there’s no end and no beginning between us.
Harry gave a sweet, shuddering sigh. “I know you’re probably composing mental notes about invoices and the shopping list or whatever, but it’s still hot.”
home, and I get to make the decisions. And I promise you, you’ll be safe here.”
“Are you sure you wouldn’t rather be rolling around on the bed?” Draco asked, holding his violin and bow.
“You—you lunatic!” Draco said, pulling one out to try on. Harry already knew it would fit since he’d temporarily duplicated one of Draco’s favourite rings during his last service. “They were probably Potter family heirlooms!”
Curse this muggle hotel and this holiday’s subsequent lack of magic. “That’s just ridiculous. We know how to put out fires.” Draco rolled his eyes, even if Harry wasn’t looking at him. Standing around naked, waiting for the water to heat was even more ridiculous.
Muttering viciously under his breath, Auror Blakely tore his Auror robes off to shove into a pocket. Draco wondered if Granger’s interference was helpful or not. But at least now everyone wore plain, unremarkable clothes, and so he chose to be grateful. Opening the gate wide, he stood back to let them all in.
Reluctantly she nodded. Draco gingerly scooped up the boy and led them back to the house. “What did you say your name was?”
“Yes!” he whispered back theatrically.
Arousal, hot and thick, swirls inside me, making my fangs drop. There, on that throbbing pulse at the base of his neck, is where I would bite him if I could.
“You know, I’m free now,” Harry said, taking Draco by the hand.
Draco smoothed his own hair back. “Me too.”
The next time he looked up, he found Draco grinning at him. “That doesn’t look like work. Looks like number four, easily distracted.”
romantic sentiment. And rolled his eyes out of habit, even if Harry couldn’t see it. “I had a good day with you.”
he’d written in his note. And Draco acted the part perfectly.
“You have to stay very, very still,” Harry said.
to be hexed.”
Draco nearly choked on his shock. “The Minister?” Granger’s face revealed nothing, but Potter blushed a light pink. Interesting. “Very well,” Draco said slowly. He paused with his hand on the gate. “Auror Blakely, Potter. If you wouldn't mind removing your Auror robes. Some of the younger children find it… unsettling.”
“Surprise!” Draco planted a smacking kiss on Harry’s cheek. “I know it’s silly, but we’ve been married thirty-one days today. And I was just so excited, I thought we could celebrate with some chocolate cake.” He grinned. “Because I don’t have to leave.”
Leila Snyde’s parents were being released from Azkaban today.
“Oh my sweet husband, where would I go? All my stuff is here, my owl post comes here.” When Harry’s lips twisted in a suppressed smile, Draco added, “Do you know how much paperwork there is to change my floo address?”
“Not even remotely. But I am definitely a fan of sharing a broom with you.”
Young, beautiful, helpless. Draco didn’t want to think about what could have happened if he hadn’t found them.
“I’ve opened it several times this month.”
“What do I win?”
“What do
(2:12 pm) Or 5 hours.
“They don’t really want us back!”
He conjured a few useless, decorative bottles to arrange around the bathroom sink where Draco’s toiletries used to sit.
“I always feel like I’m meant to say yes when someone asks that question.” He tentatively reached out to move a lock of glossy black hair from Harry’s eye. “But I’ve wanted this forever.”
“We got a stack of them for the children. And even Jason and Alex—both of age, but both seventh years this year—but nothing for the rest of us.”
And that was that. Draco left. Harry wouldn’t have thought it could hurt so much after so short a time together. But then, he hadn’t expected this outcome at all.
“They won’t call the Ministry on you. I promise it. This—Malfoy Manor—is
“Unfortunately, about half an hour. Do you want to eat anything?”
...” Seconds later, his release splattered the window and Harry came with a harsh groan of his own.
Draco rolled his shoulders. “Mostly. I had to transfigure it a little, but I think it’s all right.” He turned a circle for Harry to see, and barely finished before Harry’s hands made their way inside to tease at Draco’s bare skin. “And you?” Draco slid his hands over Harry’s arse. “Did you work a little magic to get these jeans to fit?”
He wrapped a hand around his hard cock, agreeing completely with the sensible reasoning his mind laid out for him. In the tiny, cramped shower, there wasn’t much room to move about. Harry’s elbows kept knocking the walls, and pulling the curtain askew. He had to conjure lube twice before he managed to do so in a way that didn’t immediately get washed away by the water. He hadn’t bottomed in a long time, and found the angles awkward for prepping himself, so he resorted to a spell instead.
Harry hardly worried about their NEWT exams the last week of May. The eighth years were tested early so they could be dismissed from school, leaving the examiners free to concentrate on the fifth and seventh years on the usual schedule. That meant he only had one more week in early June to think of something to keep Draco by his side instead of losing him to Malfoy Manor.
If he’d been thinking more clearly, he might have suggested they get proper flying gear. But his second brain fixated on the idea of Draco plastered to his back with his thighs hugging Harry and didn’t let his first brain organise its thoughts.
But Harry already knew and he didn’t have to ask. As they necked on the sofa like horny teenagers, Draco could tell he’d be riddled with bruises and love bites tomorrow. But no one would question a decorative scarf in October and he would cherish the look and feel of every single one of them.
“It’s twenty-six,” Harry clarified.
Moments later, Andromeda Tonks came in looking every inch the well-bred, elegant witch in her expensive and flowing robes. She sat on Draco’s other side and rested her hand atop his while greeting Mrs Stokke. “Oh Hilde, it’s been ages, darling. How have you been? How is your Selma? Still causing mischief with her Oxford students, no doubt?”
places, is it?”
“A baby?”
“In a sad thought spiral. It’s all right, it happens to all of us from time to time. But our relationship is not anything you ever have to worry about.”
He almost cried in relief when Harry’s body reacted the same way to Hermione that it had to Ron hugging him. He hugged her a second time, bemused at the strange feel of her in these different arms.
“Untie it,” Ron said, pulling his wand out. “I know a spell.”
was getting hard at a stupid fucking smile and simple arm squeeze from Draco Malfoy.
Draco covered his mouth in surprise, then tentatively reached a finger out to trace over the rings. “Harry, these are gorgeous! When did you pick them out?”
The prompt was "based on a meme" and I chose the one about daring to kiss, except it's butter because it's Simon and that's funny. Especially when Cleo showed me a picture of how butter is sold in the UK.
All pretenses are dropped when one chilled finger slides along the cleft of my arse and he whispers, “Let me finger you open.”
“I told you it was stupid.” Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and buried his face in Draco’s neck.
the sort of dark ritual that would have my father spinning in his grave.”
Harry pulled a hexagonal glass bottle from his bag. He didn’t know
Daria’s brows drew down as she reluctantly shook her head.
And then the fun began. They enjoyed food and dancing in the large ballroom. Everyone laughed at Blaise’s toast, lamenting the end of his favourite soap opera now that Harry and Draco were a boring married couple. In Ron’s toast, he congratulated them for surviving not just one near death experience after another, but the annoying quirks of their personalities as well.
“Do you even have to ask?”
But I’ve certainly got his attention now.
(12:15 pm) No… well yes… but this one is a great idea my publisher loved.
“They’ve been on the streets for about a month. In one kind of trouble or another, with their parents in prison.”
“Cheers.” Harry closed his eyes when the tart, sweet lime hit his mouth. “Bloody hell, that’s delicious! Okay fine, you can have a little something for your efforts. I’ve got some preliminary Draco sketches for a Molly book. I’m not sure of the plot yet, but…” He shrugged and flipped back a few pages in his sketchbook.
Under the soft lumos of their bedroom, Harry held Draco in a thrall nearly as tangible as a real vampire would. Draco couldn’t look away and his body heated with every touch. Every so often Harry’s teeth would catch the light and Draco moaned anew at the sexy sight. When Harry, buried deep inside of Draco, traced his tongue along the bottom edge of each sharp point, Draco lost the plot completely. His body would have shattered into a million pieces but for the strong circle of Harry’s arms holding him together.
He winced when he saw Draco coming into Fortescue’s. Maybe he wouldn’t look—
When they finished eating, Harry blushed a little as he took Draco’s hand. He could get used to having a hand to hold. “Where should we go? It’s probably too early to head to Hogsmeade. Nothing will be open.”
I saw.
“I know.” Harry smiled against Draco’s sweet lips. “You are so beautiful.”
Draco stared down at the blue jeans and red t-shirt from the secondhand shop, both altered by Pansy’s wand to be comfortably form-fitting. “Because I can. Now fuck off my property.” He hopped on the broom and flew back to the house before Potter could badger him with more annoying questions.
They sat in silence for a while until Potter said, “You’re doing a really good thing here, you know?”
What an utterly brilliant evening, Harry thought as the warm water washed all his worries away.
“Malfoy wait, please. Just… who are they really? Why are you gathering the children of Death Eaters? Is this some kind of plot against the Ministry? They’re doing their best...” His words trailed off at the boiling rage on Draco’s face.
“And why
touch you so it must be okay.”
(12:14 pm) Ok don’t get mad…
“Close enough for the Ministry. You know how seriously magic weighs on a vow.” Harry turned the brochure over to point at the pertinent details. “They can host up to thirty people. We can invite our friends. Our family, if you think your parents would come.”
Harry wished he’d had time to fix his hair or neaten his school robes. Did he really need to be introduced to a woman he already knew? Although one could easily argue they didn’t know one another at all, aside from that brief meeting in the Forbidden Forest. Oh shit, did he owe
? Probably not.
“I’m a singer,” Pansy said, tilting her chin up as though begging someone to doubt her. “Mostly small, local gigs.” Harry noticed Draco’s eyebrow quirking up and the small smile he tried to hide. But he didn’t question Pansy’s line of work and Harry couldn’t be sure if it was a lie or not.
“Who’s ready for a game or two?” Harry asked, setting a basket of mysterious supplies on the coffee table. “Except we need to get changed first.”
“Still want to hang out with us?” Draco asked.
“Come back to bed with me.” Harry pulled the covers back for Draco.
Draco cupped Harry’s cheeks and kissed him soundly. “I’m going to bed. Please promise me you won’t sleep out there. You’re going to crash hard and I want you to do that in bed. Okay?”
But it was big and different and frightening. And Harry didn’t know if he could handle big and different and frightening right now.
Draco let out a shaky exhale when Daria made a nervous giggle. Ms Coddle stood and held a hand out to Daria. “Come, show me your room and your favourite toy. Do you have toys to share here? When I was your age, my auntie gave me a stuffed unicorn I always kept with me.”
Draco leaned back with a soft sigh. “We certainly wouldn’t want that.”
“It’s not my fault you prefer tea on the ground with the other boring old people!”
“Harry, you—you…” Draco spluttered. “We have these
Harry well knew their point of view by now. Getting Draco married to an appropriate witch was their only concern. He could do what he wanted with Harry after an heir came into the world. But neither Draco nor Harry could stand the thought of living that way.
“Ah, I see,” Draco said as understanding dawned and relief flooded through him. Harry was rubbish at controlling his thoughts and if he wanted to share something with Draco, he would
“Why are your knees so sharp?”
“I could knock you to the floor with a jelly-legs jinx and straddle your hips. Then I’d be the higher one.”
Humming pleasantly, Draco returned to his office, leaving the storeroom door open.
“Draco?” he heard Pansy call. She came running around the corner. “Draco! Orion. Oh my sweet baby, are you all right?” She cooed at the baby, taking him from Draco’s arms. “We’ve been so worried!”
“Only with you,” Harry said in a tone Draco could tell was
“Okay. So then you know… I know a lot about werewolves. And I can help you.”
Although he wasn’t sure why he bothered. The tiny bottle seemed determined to keep hold of whatever conditioner it held. But he managed to squeeze out enough and massaged it gently through Harry’s gorgeous locks. A few days without the products Draco bought for him wouldn’t cause much damage, but Draco missed the citrusy scent of their regular shampoo and conditioner.
She raised her chin and said, “I want to make it clear I’m not accepting the money. Not without a clearly worded contract between us.”
The words kept flowing, almost embarrassing Draco. But in the dark of night, he could no longer hold back all that the children made him feel. “These kids made me realise what it means to truly care for another person. My parents... they loved me, but not in the way I needed. Not in a way that would have made me better. It only made me selfish and hateful just like them. And if we can learn a better way—”
“Leave the scarf on,” Harry said a little breathlessly as he sank to his knees. He ran a hand down Draco’s bare stomach and pulled his pants down to free his cock.
“Some of them,” Draco replied. “Some have been in place for hundreds of years, and are updated periodically. It’s been quite a while since the wards were last seen to. We’re researching some updated options now; removing others that are no longer of use.”
“Anything my heart requires?” Draco asked with a laugh.
“No idea. And so few people speak it anyway… Ugh, I’m glad that part of me is gone forever.”
“Theo is a nightmare, and you know it.”
“A little light reading about life debts,” Draco said. He handed Harry the thinnest one first. “This one is not terribly exciting, but it’s fun to read because the man is the one that owes the debt, and that’s rare in this genre.”
Draco cupped Harry’s cheeks in his hands to cut off his worry. “It’s brilliant. Perfect. I love you and our life together.” He kissed Harry lightly, then let him go. “But this month has been… different. Fun and exciting, but also occasionally weird and challenging. This feels familiar.”
Harry paused in drying their wet t-shirts and looked at Draco in surprise.
“Oh Merlin, I am such an idiot.” Harry covered his face, which did indeed blush as tomato-like as the other Weasleys. Seeing his own face doing it’s regular thing was bizarre, enlightening, and hilarious for Ron.
“You’re a killjoy.” Harry reached for the buttons of Draco’s robe. “But fine. We can have clothes sometimes. For now, though… Let’s get you out of these robes.”
The Auror pulled a pile of envelopes from his pocket. “We were notified by the Hogwarts staff that several of this year's letters are meant to be delivered to Malfoy Manor. Do you know anything about that?”
Did Harry watch
They didn’t count the days. Not officially and not out loud. But a long-standing habit had Harry checking the calendar occasionally. And he couldn’t help but note when their marriage reached thirty-one days.
“Your parents didn’t support the Dark Lord, I thought,” Draco said with a frown.
“Perfect.”
“I’ve submitted the paperwork to turn it into a proper care home. But we need an adult on the board of directors. Not just of age, but someone with years on them.”
(5:58 pm) No, I meant you. Want to meet up? Be my steadfast support against 73 and the wedding talk?
of a questionable nature are occurring in certain areas so that they may be dealt with appropriately.”
“Even better.”
He twisted his hands in the ties of his pyjama bottoms. “If you forgot anything…”
“We absolutely drank too much. I couldn’t get it up if you paid me.”
“We’ll be vigilant for a few days,” Draco said, “although I don’t know how that’ll help if the Ministry’s decided to invade. We just need to hold on for two more weeks, then half of you will be safe at Hogwarts.”
“My mother’s probably on her way. Saturday was…”
“Commitment ceremonies?”
“Merlin preserve me,” Draco moaned as he buried his head in his hands. “Ugh, why did I let you do this to us?”
“Mr Potter, I hope you don’t mind the intrusion.” She held her hand out. “I’m Regina Davenport.”
“Gross!” Ron made a gagging sound. “No! I hid until it went away!” He waved his hands dramatically. “We’re getting off topic. Why didn’t you tell me?”
Her tiny face crumpled and more tears started to flow. Draco kissed each of her cheeks and picked her up, passing her to Pansy. Her crying escalated, but Pansy didn’t hesitate as she hurried to the house, leaving Draco and Potter in the empty garden.
Harry waited for him to bring up whatever was on his mind. Friends could share their worries and concerns, and offer advice if needed.
Draco smirked and stepped back, leaning against the small countertop where he’d set the pyjamas he’d brought in for Harry. He slipped his hand into his own pyjama bottoms, stroking himself lightly. “Go ahead, then.”
Despite his best efforts to deny the feeling, Harry felt a little sorry for Theo. Blaise’s words about their childhood had him patting Theo’s shoulder in sympathy. “This is sort of a weird situation, isn’t it? Courting while in school? Seems unreasonable they’d expect you to watch Draco at all hours of every day.”
This is inspired by my husband getting his first tattoo at the age of 41 and me giggling about it like a school girl at recess discussing her crush.
“I definitely was, but I kept away from you as much as possible.”
Draco made a non-committal sound and hugged Harry closer. “Well, I certainly enjoyed it. Perhaps my favourite so far.”
He brushed his teeth and splashed water on his face, then sought out Pansy to fill him in on what he’d missed.
There’s no sound at all.
Then a chorus of stomping could be heard coming down the stairs, their youngest chaperone yelling, “Did my letter arrive today?”
That turned Harry’s frown into a wide grin. Those updates were the highlight of his days sometimes. Draco flirted with Lisette constantly while he chaperoned their outings, and teased them both that one day he might steal her away entirely. Much to Theo’s continued annoyance, she laughed and played along, fully knowing Draco only had eyes for Harry.
Draco had stumbled near the top of the grand staircase and even if he wasn’t
“I don’t understand what just happened,” Harry said to Ron and Hermione.
He tried on some of the others, using a few small spells to make adjustments to the fabric so his dick wasn’t so squished. Some fabrics had more give than others. The black pair he’d tried on first remained his favourite of the lot. Boy shorts, just like Malfoy wore.
“No… I wasn’t. My parents worked hard to conceive a child. It took years to have me and they treated me like a little prince right from the beginning. It made me spoiled and rotten. Ungrateful. I didn’t understand family or love or anything like it at all.”
Draco’s eyes flashed with delight. “Me too.”
“Are you ready for this?” Draco asked, staring at the little treasure chest sitting on their bed.
Hours passed while Harry mourned on the shower floor. At some point he heard people outside, and in a desperate bid to maintain his self-imposed exile, he Disillusioned himself and lay as still as possible. When Ron peered into the showers calling, “Harry?” he held his breath and hoped the spell held well enough. A second later, Ron closed the door, continuing the search in the next changing room, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
!” Harry laughed. “Wait, we have to do this properly, yeah?” He shoved the coffee table out of the way and knelt next to the sofa. He pulled the ring box from his pocket and opened it for Draco to see. “Draco Malfoy, would you do me the great honour of becoming my husband?”
Harry came in from the back garden wearing a badly buttoned shirt and with eyebrows raised. “That good, eh?”
“Lock the door,” Harry whispered against the shell of his ear. His tongue darted out to tease Draco’s ear lobe. “We’ll be quick, I swear it.” He squeezed Draco’s arse, pressing their bodies even closer together.
It left Draco feeling bereft. Even if he knew it was the right thing to do, he couldn’t imagine any witch putting up with such a relationship. While his parents had high hopes for a marriage that would yield children through magical means, Draco believed he’d be alone forever, doomed to a lifetime of ‘friendship’ with the man he loved.
Draco clutched the basket tighter. “I’m allowed all the chocolate frogs I can pay for.”
“That’s adorable but I don’t care. You know I don’t. You want this, don’t you?”
“It worked!” Draco said, his voice heavy with disbelief. “It worked, Harry!”
Draco searched his memory, barely remembering the interaction at all. “The chocolate frogs, right? I used to take a Calming Draught before shopping because the crowds made me nervous. That was actually the day I met Daphne. The day that started it all.” Draco fidgeted in his seat. “It’s better now. I ran out of the potion and couldn’t get any more. Not without Pansy knowing and freaking out. I learned to cope.” He picked at his trousers again and said softly, “If it hadn’t been for them—how much they all needed me—I’d probably still be lost in it. Or on to worse things.”
Hermione had offered Ron and Harry more ideas than she considered for herself. As if her own life plan didn’t need tweaking, but clearly the two of them needed managing. Ron had hesitated over writing
“Well I can’t snog your face off so this is going to have to do.” Draco pulled a book out and it grew to full size. He flipped through it but shook his head. It shrunk down as he put it back on the shelf. He found two more and set them on the bed. “I think the other one is… ah, here it is.” The third one looked a little more worn than the other two.
Draco’s eyes flew open and he nodded vigorously, although he bit his lips with nerves. If Harry’s hand slipped, that would be a painful spot for a shock. But he unfastened his trousers anyway and shoved his pants and trousers down to his thighs. His cock, so beautiful and familiar and hard, bobbed briefly before settling against his stomach.
“It’s fine,” Draco whispered, brushing a light kiss against Harry’s smiling mouth. “Engaged couples can kiss and hold hands.” He bit his lip. “Everything else… it can wait, can’t it?”
“Yeah, no, I get it. Can I—can we go to yours? Talk a bit?”
is all right?”
“Yes…” Draco moaned softly as he rolled them so he covered Harry. “Is this okay? We’re ready for more than just kissing, right?”
“We’ll have fun tomorrow. Should I come by at eight?”
Pansy accompanied their visitors to Draco’s study to look over the paperwork. He kicked the toys into the corner, and banished the loose crayons to their storage box while Granger conjured some simple chairs for everyone. Potter helped tidy up with a few spells of his own. “It’s not hard,” he admonished with a grin as a line of soldiers marched into a box.
Another magpie flew off. What felt like an eternity later, a shimmery stag appeared. “I’m on my way. Stay right there.”
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck. His brain completely shut down for four or six seconds while he tried to process what
home, scare everyone half to death, demand answers that are none of your fucking business, and you think I should
“Are you naked under there?” Harry asked, even though he already knew the answer.
“After the Felix Felicis, I feel like I’m already living my best life. Nothing more I could want.” Harry stepped back and slapped Draco’s arse lightly. “Except you cleaned up and relaxed and ready for dinner. Afterwards I’ll rub your feet for you and seduce you in front of a large mirror hanging over our bed.”
“I love it! I’m going to frame it for my office.” Draco used his own wand to preserve the page against wrinkling before stowing them back in his bag. “Thank you!” He leaned in and batted his eyes playfully. “This might be a good time for a first kiss.”
“Theo is the fucking
For a few heart-stopping moments, Draco didn’t know where he was. The weight of his duvet hit him first, familiar and warm as he burrowed deeper into the covers. The soft lemony scent of Dowdy’s cleaning charms came next, and then the distant sound of shrieking laughter.
Harry’s face reddened and he sighed, “Yes, but I already know we don't want to do anything like that so…”
. And if he’d
Pickles watched avidly as Astoria came over with the baby. Orion squealed and batted his hands at the large Elf ears. Biting his lip, Pickles turned bulging eyes on Draco. Slowly he nodded and reached a trembling hand for the sock. His long fingers gripped it tight as he shivered and blinked rapidly.
“Hopefully before the Aurors come after us again.”
“I can’t trust Potter to do the paperwork!”
“Almost four.”
“Oh, it’s… Nothing. Just something about life debts. Research, sort of?”
“I’m just…
“Mm, no… I don’t think that’s going to happen, Harry.” He squeezed both of Harry’s wrists, then let him go, stepping back to put space between them. “Although it’s easy enough to pass off sex as exercise in a place like this, wouldn’t you say?”
Or maybe it was serendipity. After all, Draco’s flat wasn’t far from here.
Orion shrieked then and made a grab for the Lizzie’s cone. He missed and tugged on her hair instead. While Daphne untangled them, Chester started whining about needing a toilet. That sparked three other requests for the loo, as well as two for glasses of water. Draco could sense the approach to the chaos tipping point, and declared they would finish their ice cream on the walk back to the railway station.
“When are you going to start calling me Harry?”
he isn’t.” His words came fast now, pleading and desperate. “I need—I need a-an adult.” Draco wiped at his brow again, and felt a tremor in his hands. Fucking bad sign. “Ms Coddle said if we have someone older on our board, we can keep the baby. Please, you have to help us. Surely you know someone that is willing to sign on with us.”
need care.”
Harry shivered at the seductive tone, unsure of what the fuck was actually happening. He turned his head to glance at Draco from the corner of his eye. “I’m so sorry. I - it was just
Before it even started downloading, Draco knew which one Harry would choose. They were both laughing, staring off camera at whoever was giving a speech at their reception. The mobile photo remained still, but the real one looped on them looking lovingly at each other and sharing a chaste kiss.
“I’d prefer cashmere, you know.”
“Thank you.” Draco nodded at Potter and the sour-faced Weasley beside him. “Lovely as ever, Potter.”
As he stepped inside the lift, Draco’s potion-drenched mind raced. An adult. An adultier adult than him. He punched the wall of the lift in frustration.
“I’m not becoming an animagus and we’re not getting a pet. You know we’d be shit at training an animal.”
Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t have time to comment because the door to the office opened. Narcissa swept out, with Draco following slowly behind. She glared at the two boys, then left without a goodbye to Draco.
H. Who was
“Malfoy?”
Wasn’t there a secondhand shop in the village?
Draco’s breath left in a whoosh. A whole week of Harry with a tattoo across his chest. He’d offered to show Draco the designs he was considering, but Draco preferred to be surprised. And now the moment had come.
David, a boy of eleven years, called out, “Pickles!”
“Perhaps...” Harry said thoughtfully. It hadn’t been all doom and gloom with Ginny. They’d had wonderful memories too. But through it all, he could see the undercurrent of annoyance on Ginny’s part whenever Harry strayed from the carefree, adventurous version of himself. “She used to get excited with me over those little milestones. But now… I think she hates Molly Meow.”
“Damn, I knew she was still mad at me for missing her birthday party.”
“You see?” Potter said quietly. “It’s just a name, Dromeda. I promise. You won’t regret it.” He bit his lip, his eyes dropping to the baby with a sad smile.
Did this episode air the year after this fic is set? Yes it did.
“I just want you to consider
Draco went on to Diagon Alley and did a little shopping for the school room they were setting up at home. Actually, he may have gone overboard on the shopping. ‘My First Potions’ kits brought up fond memories of his childhood, so he snapped up four of them for the older children. And with the summer gardens fading, a flutterby sprouting kit seemed like a fun way to add colour and cheer. The smaller children would enjoy watering and trimming the young plant as it grew.
After lunch, Draco shared his chocolates with the other eighth years in the common room. Harry noticed Draco saved each wrapper, and his heart warmed at the subtle, romantic gesture. He’d have to keep that in mind for future gifts.
“Well… thank you. We’re floundering half the time, but we’re doing the best we can.”
“Muggle marriages are recognised by the Ministry.”
(6:06 pm) Incognito - you know it? It’s a muggle-wizard blend. Pretty casual.
“I-isn’t that a bit much?” Harry asked. “I mean, this is all rather new…” Not that he hadn’t already imagined Draco in bed. Naked. Too many times to count. But they’d only just started dating and surely they should build to that?
I have to admit that fucking in his Gothic childhood bed has some weird sex appeal, but then the second most precious voice in my life unexpectedly calls out, “Daddies, look what Grandma got me!” and we spring apart as though burned.
Draco snorted. “I’m pretty sure we’re not going to manage that.”
“I don’t want to be a dodo,” Draco whined, but took the book anyway.
Draco stopped walking. When Greg paused as well, Draco waved him on with the group. He turned to Potter. “This isn’t about whether muggles are good or bad. Or whether wizards are better or the same. It’s about the Statute of Secrecy keeping us from muggles, and war trauma keeping us from wizards. It’s about belonging nowhere except the place we make for ourselves. Now if you’ll excuse us… I can’t keep you from following us in public, but I can bar you from Malfoy Manor.”
Draco shrugged one shoulder, embarrassed at the praise. “I know. We’re all exhausted all the time but the kids are happy so it’s worth it. It’s good to see this place put to good use after…” He trailed off, knowing Potter could fill in his own details there. Thoughts of the war had Draco sinking his head into his hands. “They’re just so… innocent. All of them. I don’t think I was ever so innocent.”
Knowing what they were called didn’t help him sleep any better. And he had a hard time focusing at work after that. Stray images of Malfoy in those pink boy shorts popped up at odd times throughout the day. Results from his internet search brought to mind images of Malfoy in other sorts of panties—cheeky pants that emphasized the curve of his arse, low-rise hipsters that would show off his happy trail. Did he own any like that?
“What is this?” Draco asked. “Are you doing this out of some misplaced guilt?”
“All right. I want extra butter.”
“It’s fine. I’ll talk with Slughorn about it. How about we soak in the sunshine out by the lake?”
But his editor suggested Molly Meow go camping, so to the woods he would go for an afternoon so he could recreate the great outdoors for Molly and her animal friends. At least he was in good company. Draco didn’t fill the silence with unnecessary chatter and walked at an even pace that didn’t outstrip Harry’s own ambling.
“It’s going to be fine, Draco,” Andromeda said kindly, resting a hand on his arm. “The room is soundproof and calming. We have medications and first aid training. There’s fresh air and good food. They couldn’t ask for better.”
Potter trailed right along behind him. Suddenly the prickly feeling on the back of his neck made sense if he’d been followed here by the interfering git.
Harry slowed for Draco to catch up, but didn’t stop. “I’m really in a hurry. Jack is from the
Draco shrieked and fell back against the nearest shelf. “What the bloody fuck?!”
it’s happening, but not fast enough to stop it.
He already owned two telescopes so he didn’t bother looking at those. But he spent some time debating between a large chart of constellations to hang on the wall, or resin stars that could be charmed into various constellations on the ceiling. Might as well get both. No one had expressed an interest in runes, but he bought three different sets anyway, just in case.
“I heard.”
“Nope.” Draco shook his head vigorously. “No. Absolutely not. Mother, you
Draco pulled a copy of the
“We can’t have kids together, Harry,” Draco said softly. “That’s what they really care about. More than you or me.”
He stepped back and felt his muscles coiling in tighter and tighter knots as he waited for their reaction.
“Mm, layer upon layer of touch, reverberating through your whole body,” Draco whispered against Harry’s mouth. “Until you can’t tell what’s a real touch and what’s an echo of it, and you finally explode in pleasure.”
Harry giggled and nibbled Draco’s ear. “Hermione said the list was terrible and if I drank any love potions she would kill me but I said I just needed an extra glass of wine and it would be just as good as a love potion because you smell so nice and you’re so warm and your mouth is my favourite place and I love you so much.”
“We’re each going to wear a t-shirt, pants, pyjama bottoms, and socks. Keeps it even. Whoever loses each game has to strip off something. Last one with clothes wins.”
“Now then…” Mrs Stokke neatened her stack of parchments. “I see two sides to this story. We have children that need a home, and we have families of a questionable nature that might need extra surveillance. I have come to a decision.”
“You think we can take care of each other?” Potter’s hopeful smile lit a spark in Draco’s chest.
“If you think Harry Potter does anything in name only, you’re deluding yourself.”
“Did you see what we got from Netflix?” he asked, pressing the button for the lift.
“I really, really want to be flipping pancakes with you.”
With a nod, Harry said, “Go ahead.”
Draco pulled a pocket watch from his waistcoat and checked the time. “Let’s start tomorrow since today is nearly over.”
“I know you won’t believe me,” Theo said quietly, “but I did the best I could.”
Greg scrunched up his face. “Evaluations? Like exams? Are we going to be quizzed on shit? That sounds awful.”
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry said, glancing at Pansy. She looked cute enough—her pug face had rounded and softened these last few years and he loved her long, shiny hair. The snug v-neck jumper wasn’t bad either. School robes had kept that generous rack hidden too well.
Draco sat up with a disgruntled glare. “Will you please be serious? It’s not a birthday or anniversary or anything special. It’s because of a silly list.”
Finally he found Andromeda and Theo on the third floor east wing, putting the finishing touches on a small suite of rooms. “How are we doing?”
Draco’s jaw clenched. “An extended house party,” he bit out. “Relinquish our letters at once and expect to hear from my solicitor in the morning.”
“I—erm—it’s just the alcohol talking,” he said sheepishly, hating the rush of heat in his cheeks as their friends smothered their laughter. “Butterbeer has alcohol and it’s just—the butterbeer talking!”
(12:12 pm) Gregarious.
She kicked a rock with a shoe missing part of its sole but didn’t respond.
Draco’s intent to wake early and get to the shops before they filled with judgmental witches and wizards was blown all to hell by the usual array of nightmares. Green light, a landslide of junk and flames, his mother’s pale face streaked with tears and blood. It was almost noon before he finally woke up enough to splash some water on his face and prepare for a trip to the magical world.
“Malfoy?”
“Regina said Roxy’s definitely interested in carrying a baby. More than one, really. So we can see how that goes.”
Draco almost reached for Harry but let his hands drop with a confused frown. “What did you think it was?”
“Merlin, yes, Draco…”
“It must mean our application is moving through, right?” Pansy asked, scanning the letter one more time.
“That’s it, you beautiful creature, my sweet—fucking hell,
He leaned into a deep stretch and ruffled his hair. “Damn, I forget how heavy she is.” He fluffed the t-shirt that clung to his damp skin. “Hot, too. As soon as she wakes up, bring her to my study. I don’t want her panicking, all right?” Marrin nodded and sat with her book next to Annie’s pallet.
’ That’s it. No name or anything.”
“Rinse.”
And like a fucking numpty I say, “I don’t think I got any butter there.”
Draco laughed and kissed him lightly on the cheek. “I think it’s safe to assume we have explored quite freely this past decade and more.”
“The default is, ‘I lost a bet.’ Ron’ll back me up and then ask me about it later.”
impressive to be recognised out of the blue like that. I get a lot of praise at bookshops and libraries and schools. But that was the first time anyone approached me—me and not
near to falling down the steps, Harry used it as an excuse to grab Draco close. He’d completely spaced out during all of their Transfiguration class, thinking of Draco’s body pressed against his. Ron lost it and demanded Harry ask Draco on a date before the day was out or else he’d hang a banner that said ‘Harry fancies Draco’ above the door of their common room.
With two bright spots of colour on his cheeks, Malfoy threw on the new robes, grabbed a stack of folders from the corner of his desk, and ran out the door again.
“As it should be. This is all for fun, right?”
“Well there wasn’t really anywhere to take him while the approval process went on, which is how we ended up with him in the first place.” Draco met her gaze steadily. He had nothing to fear—he knew no one wanted the baby. No one but this ragtag family. “I have the letter he arrived with in his file.”
(5:04 pm) Why are there four mugs of tea on my desk?
“Why not? We both know how to be quiet. And quick.” Harry trapped Draco against the shelf. “We have before…”
“I think we’ll take two," Harry choked out, his eyes glued to the movement.
Draco twisted a lock of silky black hair in his fingers. “I love you,” he whispered.
The itching on the back of his neck began almost as soon as Draco locked the Manor gates behind him. The main road and surrounding forest appeared empty, so Draco got on his bicycle and headed into the village. But the itchy feeling of being watched remained.
“Malfoy,” Auror Blakely said flatly. “What a surprise to see you here. Doing some early morning shopping?”
Cautiously he approached Malfoy at pub night, settling himself in the vacant chair with a wide smile. “Malfoy,” he said with a nod.
“The wood. It dried out all that time in customs. I need to go soak it.”
“I want to stay here with you,” Draco whispered into the darkness.
What the fuck did Draco think he was doing here? How could he possibly help these children that had nothing and no one? Would they live the next few years in fear of Aurors taking them away? Of their parents dying in prison?
And then he had Potter showing off his phoenix colouring sheet and asking if he could hang it on the bulletin board with the other colouring sheets and watercolour paintings the children had done.
sorts of pictures before. Not of a real person at least.”
“Yeah I know. I bought some of those too.” Harry shuffled through the clothes and came up with a black mesh pair of tight pants, as well as a pair of white boxer briefs with a wide panel of sheer fabric on both sides. “Not as fun, though. Men’s pants don’t come in as many colours or—or styles.” He shrugged sheepishly, his words trailing off.
They followed the drive to the front door, and Draco sent up a mental plea that no one cried when the unexpected guests walked through it. Taking a deep breath, he opened the door with a calm smile. As expected, Pansy and Daphne were waiting to hear about the visitor or to welcome new guests. Nearby, a few of the littles sat on the school trunks, hoping to greet new friends.
“Sorry we—it was—it’s just kind of silly. How we met so…”
“But it wasn’t enough.” Harry ran a hand down Draco’s cheek and drew him in for a soft kiss. “I started planning a proposal that night.”
“Draco… I…” Harry blinked, completely bewildered. He let Draco pull him to the sofa and sat in a daze. Was he dreaming? Did Draco really kiss him?
He dropped one kiss to each corner of Harry’s mouth. “All I need is you.”
Every day.
Draco).
“Oh you’re definitely going to love that and then forever be sorry your nipples aren’t as sensitive.”
on his sweet, forty-one year old husband, but the fifteen year old inside him that spent every night wanking over the heavily tattooed Greek National Quidditch team desperately desired that very thing.
“Excited about you.” Draco kissed Harry on each cheek, and then on the lips. But that didn’t feel like enough so he ran his hands over Harry’s arse and deepened the kiss.
“Yeah, but we had to hear them
“I should collect Rose from Molly,” Hermione said, shaking her head at the two of them. “I wonder if she’d notice her dad and uncle Harry aren’t acting right.”
“I just transfigured my usual frames. You like it?”
“You look so gorgeous. So beautiful, Harry. Keep going.”
Ms Coddle refrained from rolling her eyes at his naiveté, but Draco could tell it was a near thing. He didn’t want to elaborate on the state of the vaults he inherited, knowing Death Eater galleons paying for Death Eater children to eat would be met with sneers. Or fear.
“Truth serum, as promised,” Draco said, setting the vial on the kitchen table. “It’s already mixed and ready to consume. Fifteen mils for each of us.”
“Isn’t familiar code for boring?”
Too late, I’m soaked to the skin, and haven’t really considered the consequences of being half-naked and drenched in butter in front of Simon Snow (known butter fiend).
“Ugh, not when you phrase it like that.”
Potter flashed his lopsided grin. “No, you’re right, he’s an arse.” He absently ran his thumb along the rim of his mug. “Makes it easier to leave the Aurors behind.”
“As you wish,” Draco said with an eager grin.
The boys got to work sorting, and within an hour had four trunks emptied. Theo ignored Draco’s warning and levitated anything that looked dangerous to a small wardrobe with a broken door. “What?” he shrugged. “It’s better to get it out of the way.”
He kicked the ball into the makeshift goal—a space between two large, ceramic planters—and cheered. He tossed Annie into the air and caught her. “You did it, Little Bit!”
“Some itty, bitty baby clothes,” Astoria said in a sing-song voice, making a silly face at the smiling baby. His wide eyes tracked her movements and his arms flailed wildly. “How old do we think he is?”
The rest of the day passed with Draco watching in bemusement as they did nearly everything exactly as they always did, just ramped up a tiny bit. Breakfast at the café instead of at home. Shopping at the farmer’s market down the road from the café, instead of the shops near home. An outdoor lunch in their back garden instead of their well-lit kitchen.
Likely he meant for Potter to follow him, but instead Potter wrapped his hands around the iron poles and pressed in as close as he could to the gate. “What’s going on in there, Malfoy?”
“Want to fuck in our back garden like we did when we first moved in?”
I yell, “No-no-no-no-no,” but it’s too late and his
Dressed and ready, he went to the kitchen to wait for Harry. He fiddled with the cat figurine that would serve as their portkey to London and debated making a cup of tea. But moments later, Harry stood in the doorway, looking every inch the Harry of fifteen years ago.
Draco rolled his eyes and plucked Harry’s hand away, saying, “I bought your drink and I can assure you it’s fine.”
(12:03 pm) I’m so sorry. I won’t bother you again.
“Yes,” Draco was forced to admit, “but we’re trying to look past that to the innocent children they’ve left behind. We’ve seen to it the older ones have returned to Hogwarts to finish their education, and given them a safe place to return during the holiday. Afterwards, we can help them find jobs and a new place to live. A future. What can the Ministry offer them?”
“At least—” He paused and Draco let curiosity override his good judgement by turning around to see what he wanted. Potter gave him a quick once over. “At least tell me why you’re in muggle clothes.”
Draco made a non-committal sound and followed Harry and Pansy to the table. The three of them shuffled awkwardly until Harry ended up in his original seat, flanked by Draco on his left at the head of the table and Pansy on his right. He made a quick round of introductions. “Ron, Ginny, you remember Draco and Pansy from school.”
“Fine, I guess.”
“You too Draco. And Pansy.”
“I told you I’m taken so,” Harry said calmly, silently
“Well, I’m nervous.” Draco twisted his hands in his sleeves before giving up and pulling Harry even closer for a hug. “I didn’t get through my first week or so without a heavy amount of alcohol.”
Draco giggled and signed his own name below Harry’s. A warm ribbon of magic swirled around them both and disappeared. Tentatively, Draco reached a finger out to caress the back of Harry’s hand.
Baz: Simon, truth or dare?
“This is my new favourite chair and I’m going to think of fucking you just like this every time I’m in here,” Harry panted, taking his cock in hand at long last.
He avoided Ginny’s eyes and the nostalgia that lay hidden there. Their on-again-off-again thing had been off-again for four months, and Harry intended to keep it that way.
Draco lined up the loaves of bread on the kitchen counter. “All of them? Leila’s what—thirteen or fourteen?”
“You look good enough to eat,” Harry said hoarsely. His own cock dribbled pre-come, which the water whisked away.
Theo’s back straightened a little. “Yes,” he said slowly as he considered it. “Right, because usually it would just be the occasional outing or dinner and this… This is definitely more than one person can handle.”
Draco rolled them to press Harry against the bed and peppered his face with tiny kisses. “I’ll have a witty reply in the morning.” He rested his head against Harry’s shoulder and sighed when Harry’s fingers lightly caressed his back. “Keep that spell for future reference.”
It was difficult to plan an escape from the party when everyone had rooms right upstairs. But around midnight, no one seemed to expect them to stay any longer. Clinking glasses and cheers chased them from the ballroom so they could make their way to the honeymoon suite together.
Harry smiled, “I saw you. One day, in your office. I overslept and you were there. With bright pink knickers. And I couldn’t get it out of my head. So…“ He shrugged, biting his lip.
“What? Did—are you… What?” He sat back on his heels as Harry wearily sat up.
Of course. The domesticity of it all. Harry Potter didn’t imagine himself in his
“And what do you propose to do about it?” Pansy huffed, crossing her arms angrily.
He didn’t know what else he could say to Potter, so he settled for unsticking a lock of Annie’s hair from her cheek and smoothing it over her ear. Perhaps some Aguamenti games in the garden would be a fun way to clean up.
“Okay.” Harry nodded. “Okay. Good.” He pressed his lips together. “It helps, somehow. Knowing that.” He took Draco’s hands. “Yeah, okay so…” He went up on his tip-toes and dropped back down. “You’re going to have to… I didn’t realise you were so much taller than me.”
“Not… not yet,” Harry said. He swallowed heavily and wrapped his arms tighter around Draco. “I mean, yeah, I’d like that. But just, not yet.”
“Money isn’t a problem,” Draco said, thinking of the vast Malfoy vaults the Ministry miraculously let him keep. Perhaps it helped that he gave them nearly all of the Lestrange vault. “It’s our reception in Diagon, and what the kids might face at school that worries me.”
(6:09 pm) Ooh, a real life enemies-to-friends. This is very exciting!
“We’re watching you, Mr Malfoy,” Auror Blakely said ominously before finally passing the letters through the gate. Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the annoying, repeated refrain. The Auror nodded at Potter, then stepped back to Disapparate.
“I don’t want to though.” Harry traced the back of Draco’s hand and up his wrist, teasing the sensitive skin there. “I like touching you and being touched by you. I don’t want either of us restrained like that and then it’s all… Disconnected.” Harry laced their fingers together and curled into Draco’s side.
Ah well, cuddling was nice too, even if so far this month they hadn’t had as much sex as he’d anticipated. He kissed the top of Harry’s head and rubbed his back as sleep overtook his inebriated husband.
“Not quite yet,” Pansy tried to say, but Draco interrupted with, “Off to the dining room, everyone!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’ll see what Kreacher can do. Can we please focus on the task at hand? I need to find Draco.”
“I’m a
“That’s very good news. I’m here to see everything is ship-shape so you can stay. Is your room tidy?”
There's no actual love potion here, but Harry gets *very* (and adorably) drunk. No sex, just caretaking going on!
“Theo’s spells worked on the windows and we’re confident they can’t be broken. And Harry just took the last box of breakables out,” Andromeda said, tugging the corner of the duvet once more. “I think we’re ready.”
“If you touch my dick I’m going to hex yours off before I leave this body, Harry!” Ron yelled back. “Remember that Christmas dinner when Aunt Muriel tripped over Crookshanks and we all saw her purple knickers?”
Draco hummed happily as he stirred his cauldron. Harry woke up in a much better mood today and they both felt better about moving forward with the list. Although Harry had a moment of doubt about today, given Draco’s “unfortunate teenage tattoo mishap.” That had to be the funniest way of phrasing those years. But truthfully, Draco couldn’t be more thrilled about today. He set his stirring rod aside with a wide smile as his mobile pinged with Harry’s ringtone.
Over the weekend, he finally decided he had to order a pair for himself. Or several pairs. Thank Merlin for the internet so he wouldn’t have to suffer the humiliation of buying them in person. Although waiting on the shipping was a bitch.
Draco, Theo, Greg, Alex, and Jason went to the vast Manor attic, looking for trunks that could be put to better use than storing old junk.
Draco sighed and pulled his hand away. “I suppose. But the offer stands, if you change your mind.”
Draco held a hand out to him. “Harry, please… You have to know you didn’t… That I wanted it too!”
For the next game, they stacked ten cups into a pyramid for each of them. They had to blow up a balloon and use the balloon’s escaping air to knock over all ten of their own cups. But they couldn’t stop giggling and pointing the balloons at each other, which led to play-fighting and jostling the table enough that the pyramids fell over mostly on their own.
Because Harry
“I see.” She nodded at her assistant and he made a note on his clipboard. “Are there many young children here?”
This pleased Blakely, but Draco didn’t mind. Just having Harry at his side encouraged him.
“What?” Draco laughed, trying to focus.
“Anything?” he asks, reaching for the button on his flies and raising one eyebrow at me.
--------
“Don’t get us kicked out,” Ron said, laying a hand on her arm. “Kreacher probably packed those little spinach tart things.” She rolled her eyes at him but stayed silent.
“Well it’s not like we’re going to… I mean… the chastity spells will only let us take it so far, right? I can’t
Tension nearly ate them all alive over the next few days. All the progress they’d made melted away as if it had never been. Annie and Libby reverted to wetting the bed at night. Yelling and fistfights broke out over stuffed animals and quaffles. The worst might have been Bryce having a panic attack that set the tablecloth on fire when little Libby innocently mentioned a camping trip with her parents. How would these kids manage if they found themselves on the streets again?
Harry waited a full minute to be sure Malfoy wouldn’t return unexpectedly before he cautiously slipped out of the office and through the Ministry to his own office in the Auror department. He collapsed at his desk, heart racing while he tried to decipher what he’d seen.
They both laughed, knowing Draco didn’t really have any spirit of adventure. But he would do anything for Harry. “Only for you, my dearest.”
“All right, that’s about what we guessed as well.” She handed him a scroll. “This has some aftercare instructions. Some things to look out for. Mainly the return of the rash, and any difficulty breathing. He’ll probably eat lightly over the next twenty-four hours, but his normal appetite will come back after that.”
wouldn’t run something like that.
Draco rolled his eyes. His thoughts floated through various scenarios, and his words formed slowly. “I think I like morning sex when we’ve got nowhere to go. I don’t like disrupting my weekday morning routine. I like sex before bed best because it’s a nice, relaxing way to end the day. What do you think?”
class, then?”
If Draco catches the snitch, there will be obnoxious gloating about who the better flyer really is and a condescending offer of a rematch. Draco will dole out backhanded compliments, biting kisses, and zealous charm that will lead to wild, hard fucking.
“As I said,” Draco said shakily, smoothing his hair once more, “he’s helping me with a project.” Draco turned his back on Weasley, pretending to survey the shop as if he didn’t almost start crying a moment ago.
Harry opened the larger box with delight at all the delicious pastries. “Erm, it looks like something is missing?” he said, pointing to an empty spot with a few crumbs.
Even Dowdy and Pickles joined them that night, nestling in piles of pillows and blankets with the children to watch
Draco smoothed back Harry’s damp hair and kissed along his temple and cheeks. “I love you too, Harry. More than anything. All of you.”
For a long moment, Harry couldn’t be bothered to move. But then Draco pulled away to find his wand and clean them up. They settled into bed curled around each other, as they had each night of their holiday.
Potter dragged a Healer along behind him. “Tell us what happened.”
Even as Harry opened his mouth to protest, the shriek of a small child sounded from nearby. He and Draco both turned to the sound to find a family of four entering the small clearing. Both children ran for the tree and immediately began climbing, while the parents waved at Draco and Harry.
“Perfect, cheers,” Draco said sarcastically. “All your dreams come true—me
But Madam Stokke pondered his words with the same care she did Ms Coddle’s. “I understand your concerns, Auror Blakely.” She flipped through the parchments until she found the list of names. “Some of these families do bear watching. Many of their parents are in Azkaban, yes?”
“It’s over,” Harry said. He tugged Draco into a rough hug and laughed loudly. “It’s over and I’m free.” Louder, to the room at large, he yelled, “I’m free! No more training or stupid uniforms!”
Only, later never arrived. When the group returned to the common room, Theo prevented Harry from pulling Draco aside (metaphorically, since he couldn’t actually
“Yeah… erm… let me think.” Potter glanced at Weasley, who was watching in morbid fascination.
Harry gave a nervous laugh. Where the fuck was this story going?
Everyone pitched in to help as the children started arriving, giving them a sense of purpose and direction. Now, he couldn’t imagine running things without their help and no one
“No idea. And even if we did, I feel like it would just show me fucking you just like this mirror would,” Harry said, gesturing to the ceiling.
A single floo call to the Ministry Department of Transportation was all it took to learn the Hogwarts Express would arrive at the station promptly at ten in the morning.
“Next game is mine!” Draco eyed the materials and snatched the bag of mini marshmallows. “Whatever uses marshmallows.”
Over time, Draco urged Harry to move the sofa this way, and add a shelf here. He brought artwork he thought Harry might enjoy, and knick-knacks and photos to remind him of dates they’d shared. Anything he could to make Harry’s flat a real home. Until finally Harry asked him to move in permanently.
He thought about the practicalities of it, one of them splayed out on the bed exposed and at the others mercy. It wasn’t that they didn’t trust each other enough, it was more that he wanted to be able to reach for Harry at will.
“This’ll be good for us, you’ll see.” Harry came up beside him and reached for Draco’s hand. Instantly, a sharp jolt of electricity shot through him. “Ow,
Was the floor tilting? Was Draco slipping into an alternate universe where Harry Potter
Draco ducked his head to nuzzle Harry’s cheek. “Could you still make it good for me, Harry?” he said softly. His tongue darted out to tease the sensitive skin below Harry’s ear. “If you only had one hand to tease me with?”
Pansy whirled on him, panic in her eyes, “Are you serious right now? How are we going to take care of an infant? What are we going to feed him?”
“Oh love,” Draco said, his smile widening at the elegant table setting. “It’s perfect!” He banished the trainee robes hanging over his arm to the sitting room and pulled Harry in for a kiss. “I love you.”
“Ease up, love,” Draco whispered, taking the quill and filling out the form.
They stood facing each other, wands in hand, and yet each hesitant to make the first move. But Draco had an agenda for the day and so started off by hitting Harry with an aguamenti.
Potter had to follow him. “You’re seeing the kids off? Hermione will look after them, you know. Neville too.”
He looked up from his notes in confusion as the door to the storage room swung shut with a tiny whine. “What the…”
Ginny and Ron watched this exchange, their heads going back and forth as though at a tennis match, growing more confused with each idea.
He turned the water on, so Draco wouldn’t get suspicious of what he might be doing. Had Draco left this here on purpose? Specifically for Harry to find? While that idea had appeal, he recognised the impracticality of it. Draco had no way of knowing Harry would be coming over, or that he would need a shower. Far more likely, Draco had been yanked from his home in the early hours of the morning, like Harry, when the case broke wide open.
On their third lap, when they were as far from Theo and Hermione as they could get, Harry darted across Draco’s flight path and knocked the tail of his Firebolt into Draco’s Nimbus hard enough to make them both wobble.
He hadn’t taken the time to text Harry so he was still in his workshop when Draco rolled through the floo. But seconds after the wards altered him, Harry emerged from the workshop with a smile and greeted Draco at the kitchen door.
He read
“Next we have Mr Evergreen. He is an independent contractor that does work for the Ministry regularly. He’ll be reviewing the wards and the changes you’ve made since our last inspection. Auror Sterling will be helping him.”
Over dinner, Ron and Harry filled Hermione in on the accident during the raid, and the cauldron that covered them both in a slimy potion. Several minutes later, Ron found himself looking out of Harry’s eyes and they left the crime scene for St Mungo’s.
Harry kicked at the ground. “Ron was just being an arse.”
Draco wasn’t terribly reassured by the addition of Mr Talpin, but Potter gave him a confident smile as he led them to the lifts. The address was right there in London, easy enough for them all to Apparate too. They took the stairs to the first floor, and Draco knocked loudly on the door. After waiting several moments, he knocked again, but there was no response.
“Auror Blakely. Potter. To what do I owe the pleasure this time?” Draco crossed his arms as he stared through the gates, determined to send them off once again.
“Have you eaten? I can still make you something.”
“Can’t,” Theo said, as Harry knew he would. “I have chess club on Saturday evenings.”
Sometimes our fingers brush as we walk, bringing a secret smile to my face. He’ll link one or two of our fingers for a few seconds until the other people on the pavement bump us apart.
Harry slumped on his sofa, wondering if he’d bollocksed everything up. Just to torture himself, he opened the small box of rings to examine them one more time.
That was the last straw for Auror Blakely. He shot to his feet, pulling his wand with a stunning spell on his lips.
She pulled away, wiping at her eyes and sniffing. “Theo’s in there now.”
(10:46 pm) Unfortunately I cannot blame this on alcohol.
And he did, flushed with arousal and eyes shining so brightly. Harry ran his hands up and down the tender skin of Draco’s thighs as Draco fucked into his own fist. His head dropped back, exposing the long column of his neck, dotted all over with tiny lovebites from their holiday fun.
“I’m not going home for the Easter holiday.”
Draco smiled into Harry’s neck. “Yes, perfect… I can do that. Anything else?”
to show me that fanart sometime.”
, not to Harry.
“Did you see any lights? Or sounds? Maybe a hot or cold bit of magic?”
Harry rolled onto his back with a defeated sigh. “Can I take my clothes off?”
Draco used his mouth in other ways, sucking a line of kisses down Harry’s jaw and whispering about the delicious heat of Harry’s mouth on his cock and how Harry would experience it soon enough for himself. That thought alone had Harry spilling over Draco’s fingers with a loud moan. He slumped against Draco’s shoulder and smiled when Draco’s arm came around him.
Grumbling under his breath, Draco dumped his suitcase next to Harry’s and joined him in the kitchen. Instead of sitting in his seat at the table, he straddled Harry’s lap and buried his head in Harry’s neck like a small child.
“Wait, what? You weren’t at that ball!” Draco searched his memory for that long ago event, struggling to remember if Harry had been there. But he’d always been a little obsessed and surely would remember if he’d seen Harry Potter there.
Daphne read over her shoulder. “It says a series of evaluations. That sounds like they’re taking our request seriously.”
“Er, no…” he lied. “It was...” In truth he’d replaced that orchid twice already, but couldn’t be bothered a
“Draco…” Harry whispered. He scooted a tiny bit closer, propping himself up on his elbow to see better, and moved his hand down Draco’s neck over the buttons of his shirt. “Do you trust me?”
Draco couldn’t help his glare, and tried to mould it into a smile. “How lovely.”
And he hated being stuck with Healer Malfoy. If he ever got here.
“I’d like it if we were more,” Potter whispered into the night air. “More than friends.”
“Right, yeah. Okay. I can do this.” But still, he hesitated.
, that’s exactly what we’re going for. We’re forty-one, Draco. We have the time and money to waste on ridiculous things like this and I didn’t know how much I wanted it until the list made me look for it. We are going to have a wonderful time and I’m already planning on doing it again.”
know that.” Harry crossed his arms defensively. “It’s not exactly fair if you can’t say no to anything I ask of you, now is it? Or even ask for anything in return?”
The square of parchment in Harry’s pocket weighed, at the very least, eight tonnes.
“It’s chastity charm
blocking the spray of water. It hit Draco square in the face, making him splutter over the sound of Harry’s laughing. Wretch. Draco shoved his hands into Harry’s hair, tugging aggressively in payback. A worthless effort, since Harry actually liked a little hair pulling. A few strands stuck to his fingers and he wrinkled his nose as he rinsed them away.
“We should fly more often if it ends like this,” Draco said, his thumb tracing across Harry’s cheekbone.
“But it’s raining,” Theo repeated.
“What do we do with this?” Harry asked, holding up the rubbish bin.
“Yeah.” Potter stacked his pots of paint in their storage box and sat next to it, apparently content to let Draco finish storing the rest. “It’s as if the Aurors don’t know what to do with us. Those of us that fought in the war. Kingsley wants us ushered in quickly based on experience. But Robards wants us going through the traditional three year training. And so we’re in some kind of limbo where we’re doing both—working as Aurors with an experienced partner, but also taking classes on the side. It’s… just really not working.”
A sick feeling stole over Harry. “There was… a cold draft… But it was just a draft!”
Harry rummaged in the picnic basket and pulled out a small box. He unshrunk the two paper lanterns he’d tucked inside and handed one to Draco. Then he lit tea light candles to set inside each of them.
He scowled when Potter followed right along, as though he were part of the group as well. But what could he say to keep Potter from coming with them? The train station, the city streets, the ice cream shop were all public places he had no business barring Potter from. Why must he be a scourge on Draco’s patience?
Harry wanted to hug him, but didn’t because he knew he could never manage the casual hug friends could share. And then found he didn’t need to because Draco grabbed him for a deep kiss.
, he’d overslept! Thank Merlin the Cloak kept him hidden. Just in case, he froze in Malfoy's chair while Malfoy bustled in, mumbling under his breath. Harry, on full alert now, waited for his chance to make an escape.
“What does Wiggenweld Potion do?”
“We’re in a shower! You can just rinse it off!”
“You definitely need to make her jealous,” Pansy interrupted. “I immediately volunteered. So we’ll flirt, and laugh, and at the end, I go home to Theo.”
Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head and caressed the bare skin of Draco’s waist. “Ready to head home?”
“Are you spying for the Ministry?” Chester asked. Beside him, Pansy stiffened and darted a panicked look at Draco. “Draco says we should—”
Harry spluttered, “You knew about that?”
With an absent-minded air that concerned Harry, Draco stared at the television and ate popcorn from their shared bowl. Friends could share popcorn, but not a blanket. Usually Draco talked over their film with tales of Healer training or some disgusting medical anomaly he’d read about.
Draco threw a stasis charm over the shopping bags. “They’ll keep. Let’s get naked and I’ll show you how much I need every last inch of you.”
“Yes,” Draco said quietly. “Even then.” His fingers crept ever closer to Harry’s. “I wish I could hold your hand.”
When Harry caught the snitch a second time, the others decided to call it and head into the warmth of the castle.
“Oh? Just catching up like old friends?”
There were generic platitudes —
Ginny interrupted, “Wait—I don’t understand. How did you two meet?”
(7:34 pm) Well isn’t that a fucking plot twist?
“Delicious!” he said, smiling as Harry sat across from him. “You went to so much trouble for tonight! But I love it!”
Heat rose up in Draco, flushing his cheeks and dampening his brow with sweat once again. And he
“Potter… you fucking hero, do you have to be everywhere, saving everyone?”
The awkward group trailed up the main staircase, silent but for Daria’s slow but steady chatter. The bedrooms underwent the same decluttering as the rest of the house when they filled with children. They housed two to a room, boys to the right of the main stairs, girls to the left. Ms Coddle oohed and aahed over the toys and books Daria and Libby showed off. She met with stern resistance from some of the others, particularly Bryce and Elyon, who had been literally dumped on the street by a Ministry official just like her.
“Even if it labels you as deviant and makes you feel like shit?”
“Right, how silly of me. Twenty-six days until there are forty-two more days,” Draco said with a small, secret smile for Harry. “The food better be amazing.”
pictures are always captioned with some kind of ‘friendship’ thing. The
That evening, the entire party had dinner on the outdoor covered patio. Small braziers were set around the perimeter to ward off the October chill. Harry thought he saw a few wands spreading warming charms but not flashing enough to catch the eye of the entirely muggle staff.
Draco kissed his cheek before flooing home.
“Feel how cold my hands are.”
Draco turned for the door and found Potter watching him once again. “Oh,” he said dumbly. “I thought you left with the others.”
With a sigh, Draco opened the door wider and crossed to his bed. Harry shut the door behind him and joined Draco, leaving ample space between their bodies as usual.
But thank Merlin, Harry’s grin said the water’s temperature had reached an acceptable level. He stepped into the tub and offered a hand to help Draco in.
here to spy on me.”
“Fine. But again, no one invited any of you.” Harry turned back to the water. “Here’s to living the rest of my life with regret and longing for the fun times I lost.”
“Whatever, it’s cute.” Theo gathered the brushes in a bucket. “I’ll take these to rinse clean. Why don’t you two store the leftover paint?” He winked at Draco behind Potter’s back, so Draco flipped him two fingers when Potter wasn’t looking.
kill him, he thought as he wrapped a hand around his aching cock.
on ‘la’” had Harry and Ron smothering yet another laugh.
(12:28 pm) [image: Harry Potter holding a ‘Molly Meow’ notepad with the message ‘Hey 37! #4 Honest!’ written on it]
“I don’t have to answer any of your questions,
Draco made some sort of incoherent sound, at a complete loss for words.
“It’s vanilla,” Harry repeated, before vanishing the whole thing and tucking his newspaper under his arm. “I’ve got—” he pointed vaguely. “I’ll see you later, Draco.” He nodded goodbye as he hurried away.
The children dispersed to their seats at the dining room table. After the older kids left for Hogwarts, Draco shrunk the table to better accommodate their smaller number, but there should still be room enough for one more.  He took his place at the head of the table, and Potter moved directly to his right.
“Nice,” Draco said. “Harry, you remember Pansy? Pansy, Harry Potter.”
grams. Which is ten grams above the legal limit.”
“I looked into some of the kids staying with you. At least the school aged ones I have names for. Several of them were rejected from Ministry-approved orphanages for one reason or other.”
The full moon was Sunday.
“Dragons are real.”
He had the courtesy, at least, of a patronus message that gave them approximately one hour to prepare, and was still a little vague on whether he would bring Andromeda with him or not. Draco had no way of contacting him to tell him it was a terrible idea or they didn’t have time or he still wasn’t recovered or any of the other hundred excuses he could have used to put Potter off, and perhaps that was Potter’s intention. How clever of him, unfortunately for Draco.
The common room sofa wasn’t as comfortable as Harry’s bed but had the added thrill of feeling illicit, even though they knew the eighth year suite was empty for the next five days.
“My sweet husband,” Draco sighed contentedly as Harry squeezed his arse with both hands. “Let’s do this one tiny thing. Shouldn’t take more than ten minutes. And then we’ll snog until you’re dizzy from it.”
There was the heat of Draco’s body melting Harry’s resistance. The soft moans that mingled on every breath. The months of fantasies slowly coming to life with each roll of Draco’s hips.
Harry laughed and pulled his sketchbook from his bag. “I’ll certainly keep you around long enough to get chocolate baklava.” He opened the sketchbook to a blank page as he took in their surroundings. “This looks so much better than what I found online. Everything looked too perfect to be real.”
For three seconds, Draco’s throat completely closed up. A prickling cascaded over his cheekbones and he drew in a deep breath to stave off his anxiety while he raced through his options. If Potter knew… Did that mean his paperwork was actually moving through the system? “I see you’ve done your research,” Draco said carefully.
Simon: Dare.
“Agreed.” Draco shuddered as he quickly shut down any thoughts of Nagini and Voldemort hissing at each other in the Manor’s dining hall. “Just thinking about it makes me… Nope, French is loads more fun.”
As he moved through the barrier, Draco cast a Notice-Me-Not charm so no one would notice the string of eleven children passing through. Daphne, wearing Orion in the sling, led them all, with Pansy and Theo walking on either side to help guide them. Greg brought up the rear, trying to keep Annie from getting distracted as she walked.
He rolled his eyes, but ruined it by smiling. “Because I love you and this was indeed fun. But we’re not doing it again. No more sex at work! We are too old for that!”
“You really are a son of a bitch, you complete
“This is going to be a nightmare,” Pansy groaned, throwing the letter on Draco’s desk.
“Come on, Little Bit, perhaps you can help me convince two whiny babies they have to go to school.”
Storytime with toddlers. What was his life becoming?
And as the month passed by, it continued to be easier not to say anything and to enjoy being with Draco. He was funny and warm, and his hand settled perfectly into Harry’s. He never complained about Potter Watch, and even laughed whenever he got a mention. His lips were soft and pliant, and Draco never pushed for too much. He took things as slowly as Harry, perhaps just as reluctant to have errant fingers caressing hidden bits of lace and ribbon.
“You look the part,” Harry said, almost reaching out to touch Draco’s platinum hair.
“Certainly,” the woman said with confidence, despite the worried glances at their tables. “How many do you need?”
“The worst moment?” Harry asked. Oh how he wished he could raise one eyebrow like Draco could. “Really?”
“A good option?” Harry asked.
Harry’s dodgy mumbling about saving two seats for a ‘new friend’ had Ginny narrowing her eyes and sitting across from him, instead of down the table to catch up with Hermione and the wedding plans. She reached over and tugged on the drawstring of Harry’s red hoodie.
“And your life seems to have settled somewhat.”
“Fine. But I need you to talk to Professor Slughorn when you have a free moment today to explain about the life debt.”
“Oh, okay.” Harry frowned, but didn’t let himself panic. He knew Draco wasn’t thinking of actually marrying her.
Just Harry and Draco and the open yearning in their bodies. The intensity of it made Harry feel strangely vulnerable. When Draco slid inside him at long last, Harry squeezed his thighs against Draco’s hips.
“Let’s make a pact to never speak about Simon Snow’s magic ever again,” Niall agrees and follows him out the door.
“I know.” Potter met his eyes, looking so lost and painfully open. “I don’t know what I am if I’m not vanquishing evil.”
Temper tantrums and fearful crying wouldn’t reflect well on them so they did their best to prepare the children for the arrival of Charity Commissions on Thursday. According to the Commission’s letter, a team of Ministry employees would evaluate the well-being of the children, the paperwork they’d collected thus far, the suitability of the house and surrounding grounds, and the wards they had in place. The part that worried Draco was the Aurors that would be accompanying them.
“What are you doing?”
—who cares if they see your huge dick up my arse, you son of a—keep going, just like that…”
“How was I to know?” Draco said immediately. “He’s in the paper with loads of women!”
Draco did his best to hide his own insecurities and anxiety. Some mornings he woke up frozen in his bed, his lungs seizing painfully. But he learned to box up those thoughts and seal them away, much as he had during the war. Today, they needed him to be strong.
“No, I know. Definitely not. But while I was planning what we’d do this month, I wondered what we’d do when we got here and…” Harry set a packet of butter and the cheese in the fridge.
Everyone stiffened when Ms Coddle and her assistant came in after Draco. Annie jumped off her trunk and ran at Draco full tilt. He picked her up, hugging her tight to reassure her silently as best he could.
Draco wanted to say something snarky like
Draco kissed his husband’s cheek in apology. “Who’s cock are we copying?”
“Then you’ll need to acquire a warrant,” Malfoy said, hiding his joy at the Auror’s discomfort while banishing the folder to his desk drawer once again.
By the time the game finished—which Harry let Draco win—Harry’s heart clamoured painfully in his chest from all the buzzed contact with Draco. It would probably take hours to calm down enough to sleep. But Draco was laughing when he left and that was all he cared about.
“Let me… Do you want… What do you want?” Draco whispered between tremulous, heated kisses. “Ask me for it. Tell me you want me.”
And of course Harry kept his promise.
“Did you even
want.”
Thankfully Orion was accustomed to being passed around. He made a grab for her eyeglasses, but Ms Coddle was no novice and held his hands away from her face. After several minutes of peering into his eyes and mouth, of testing the strength of his arms and legs, and cooing playfully with him, she passed Orion back to Jason.
Draco crossed his arms. “My solicitor says I don’t have to talk to you. And I’m sure he’d
“Thirty-four days,” Harry corrected on Friday. “It’s less depressing if you count down to when your mum is checking in with us.”
“I see. About your… staff.” She hesitated a hair too long, but Draco refused to be cowed by her obvious dismissal of their youthfulness. “What sort of training have they received in childcare?”
Hard sobs tore through him as he thought of every beautiful thing he’d shared with Draco over the last two weeks. Had Draco wanted any of it? At least some of it? There were times when… Sometimes he ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, or traced over his lips. Surely he wanted that, if Harry hadn’t asked for it and he gave it anyway.
“And lemons,” Pansy added.
“Yeah?” Harry asked with a growing smile. “Check everywhere?”
counts as a legitimate film adaptation.” His arm slid across the back of Harry’s chair.
What should he say to this fucking arse that set Draco free from a potential ten years in that hellhole?
“Don’t swear in front of the kids,” Potter responded automatically. “And I am. I just haven’t yet.” He scrubbed at his hair and sighed. “I don’t want to talk about it. Where’s my paintbrush?”
Harry tilted the vial back and forth, watching the golden liquid slosh around. “I think I’m mainly curious… About what it might give me now that I’m already so happy.”
Their next great adventure.
“Not going to happen,” Draco said, laughing outright at Harry. “Not after the last debacle.”
“No,” Jane said flatly. “We’ll be leaving as soon as he’s awake. It’s not safe here. Not really.” She tipped her chin at the others gathered behind Draco.
“Of course. Absolutely. Anything. We’re getting married. Draco, we’re getting
Draco smiled, “Pickles, I’m Draco Malfoy and this is—“
“I’m so glad we tromped all this way
“Sod off, Potter. These
He waited until they both nodded an agreement before addressing the rest of the kids. “As for the rest of you, I’m afraid we don’t really have a choice. If you lot are truant from school and are found here, it puts
.” Both their wands smacked his palm, and he dropped one at random to use the other to clean them up.
“Same. Although I’ve warded them against fire and water damage so if it happens while we’re gone, they should be fine.”
“Sure we can. Ron says incurrence of a life debt can negate other forms of contracts. Including courtship. We just need to notify your parents.”
“Here, you carry this.” Draco shoved the changing bag at Potter. “He weighs a tonne while he’s asleep. I wish Pansy had packed my sling.”
? Fuck off with you! And expect a restraining order to be filed tomorrow. Or will it? Probably can’t count on the Aurors enforcing
It took until almost dinnertime for Narcissa Malfoy to arrive. Harry, Draco, and Theo went to the Headmistress’s office but Harry and Theo had to wait outside while Narcissa and Draco spoke privately.
“Remember last month when we could fuck around whenever we wanted to?” Harry sighed into Draco’s spare pillow. “That was amazing.”
--------
He laughed when he held up the knee length tunic. The deep purple looked almost black, offset by a silver brocade. Harry always loved this one and so it was no surprise he’d kept it all these years. The slits up the sides ended a few inches above Draco’s waist and when paired with low rise trousers left quite a tantalising bit of his flanks exposed.
Harry’s whole body vibrated with the need to come. He didn’t know how much longer he could stand the tight, hot press of Draco all around his cock, and the soft moans Draco let out as he rested his head against the window.
“Good idea.” Hermione scrunched her nose up, clearly displeased with the thought of taking one of them home. “This is just bizarre!” She wished them both luck and left for the Burrow to pick up Rose.
Draco ducked his head but not enough that Harry could reach him to kiss. “I might like this game,” he whispered.
With a wide smile, Harry excused himself and met the new couple at the bar to order drinks. “Thirty-seven,” he said with a smile, holding a hand out to shake.
“Theo, you prick. Shut your stupid face. We all know he didn’t mean it.” Draco looked over Harry’s shoulder at Blaise. “Right Blaise?”
(See the end of the chapter for
With a little shifting, Potter managed to squeeze in between Jane and Gretchen. Jane didn’t look too happy with the arrangement, but stayed quiet so as not to draw attention to herself. Robbie didn’t have the same caution. He leaned around Jane and asked, “Are you going to be living here too?”
Because now Draco lived with him every day.
“Good idea.” And yet, Harry set the bin aside and pulled off his t-shirt with a wicked smile for Draco.
“Erm, no… it’s from last Wednesday. Potter Watch, about our break up. They used a picture from sometime when we were out and about.” Harry set the tray down and pulled the paper closer to look at it again. “It’s a good picture of us.”
Not really, but he didn’t want to faint from hunger at a key moment either so he accepted the chutney and cheese sandwich that Ron offered. He was just finishing his last bite when a knock sounded.
But of course, that wouldn’t be enough. “Are they taking me away?” she cried, wrapping her arms around his neck.
They all crammed into the lift for the most awkward ride of Draco’s life. He sighed in relief as he followed Andromeda and Ms Coddle to Charity Commissions to sign the necessary paperwork, leaving Harry and Auror Blakely to continue on to the Auror Department.
Ms Coddle took Andromeda to her office and questioned her for nearly an hour. Each passing minute made Draco more and more anxious. He checked his pocket watch again, growling when the minute hand hadn’t moved at all. “Why is this taking so long?”
does.” Harry saluted Ron, who helped him manage his account with a grocery delivery service.
Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and ignored Weasley entirely. “Any ideas? Time is of the essence.”
With one delicate finger, Draco pressed aside Harry’s collar, exposing a few black lines. “Did it hurt?”
“You know it’s not the fucking duel, you prick.”
“I remember those robes—with the silver clasps and the wide black cuffs?”
“I didn’t sleep last night. I—I’m a little…” He turned to Weasley. “Do you happen to have—I need something to wake me up. Do you have any Wide-eye or just—something like it?” He reached into his pocket and pulled out wizarding coins and a few muggle notes. “I can pay.”
“We’ve had a muggle first aid class, and Daphne Greengrass is taking a short course in early child care in Salisbury. Pansy Parkinson is looking into a correspondence course in business and accounting, to help with the financial aspects.”
“Yes, but that’s not the same as
“I drew this for you!” Annie said happily, thrusting a piece of paper in Draco’s face.
!” He shouted the last, grinning like a fool at Hermione. She blew him a kiss.
(12:32 pm) You think that will stop me from texting my new best friend? Doubtful!
“That’s fine,” Harry said. “I’ve got some homework to do anyway. I’ll see you tomorrow I guess.”
Harry turned the vial so it caught the light. “Why’s it blue? I thought veritaserum was clear.”
“Right but then he asked me a second time yesterday
Best hour of the week.
“Whatever I want,” Draco said with a smirk as he signed the payment slip with a flourish. He smiled at the saleswitch. “I’ll take this with me now,” he said, picking up the bag of small training brooms. “The rest will be delivered this afternoon?”
He didn’t wait to watch them walk away. Bursting into the shop, he called for Sherri and the box she’d set aside for him. He had to get home quickly, before the Aurors appeared. It broke his heart that Sherri had a hard time meeting his eye as he dumped the pharmacy bag inside and carried it to his bike.
He had a hopeful, expectant smile that filled Harry with joy. Harry nodded eagerly and managed two quick kisses before Draco got out of range. He winked at Harry and closed the door to the bathroom.
worked.
As soon as his body felt under his control again, he stormed into the room next door, determined to get some answers. He found Harry making faces in the mirror. Of course he was.
Everyone gathered on the picnic blankets and began passing out plates and containers of food. Kreacher had outdone himself with mini tarts both savoury and sweet, dainty sandwiches, fruits both plain and chocolate covered, and a feta and tomato pasta salad that Draco particularly enjoyed.
“We could have opened a bottle of wine with dinner,” Draco said hesitantly.
Orion looked at his slice of cake with entirely too much gleeful recognition, but Draco didn’t scold his friends for it. Their little boy deserved sweet treats. Idly he wondered how far off they were from Orion’s real birthday. Somewhere, was his mother thinking of him? Would they ever meet her? And what would she think of how they’d raised him? Would she ever want to take him back? Draco shook off morose thoughts of losing his sweet baby and accepted a piece of cake from Daphne.
“Thank you. It’s fine. Now. But if we’re going to do something like that again…”
! Who would ever believe that a few short months ago the echoing shrieks were terror and not laughter? The shrieking got louder as Jemma chased Annie past Draco and Daphne and into the smaller ballroom.
“As many as we need to.”
“Want to talk about the Aurors?”
“Just get on the broom. I’ll go easy on you, I promise. We can even charm the snitch so it doesn’t fly too high.”
“Whatever you’re most comfortable with.”
Harry’s cock throbbed at the hint of challenge in Draco’s voice. He’d never wanked for someone before, not like this. Which was a ridiculous thought as Harry had never been caught about to fuck himself on someone else’s dildo. But he couldn’t deny that the thought of Draco watching him sent a thrilling wave of desire through him.
“A Wiggenweld Potion. It’s not unusual for fostered children—”
“Why don’t we have a sobering potion? I want you to go get me one so I can fuck you on this sofa right now.”
“Gross, don’t call me that wearing Harry’s face,” she said quickly.
Potter pointed to the train. “Seeing Hermione off. She and Neville wanted to get here early to help monitor the children.”
“Yes, but David, here, can free you, right?”
“Come here,” Harry said softly, as an invitation. Draco set the violin on the bed and climbed up next to Harry. “Are you hard?” he asked uselessly with the answer tenting the front of Draco’s pyjamas.
“Think you’re ready to head home?” he asks, all false nonchalance, licking his lips clean.
Draco smiled at him. “I know… That vein in my father’s forehead almost exploded when I said that to him too. He wants an heir so the Manor will be cared for. I told him it will be, even if it’s by a different Malfoy. It’s going to be fine.”
Theo snapped his pocket watch shut with a relieved sigh and shot to his feet. “Thirty minutes are up.”
He only needed a sip. Maybe two sips. So he didn’t lose his shit as soon as he landed in Diagon Alley. Yes,
“Not yet. Right. Okay. There’s still time.” He kissed Harry slowly, delicately without the heated fervour of earlier. “Plenty of time.”
“Of course not! I got it yesterday when I visited you for lunch. Nicked it from storage and none-the-wiser.”
Unbelievable. Completely inconceivable. Harry had a crush on Malfoy. On
“No,” Draco said firmly. He peeked through the door at Annie, curled into a tight all on her pallet next to Draco’s spot. “That isn’t going to happen.”
Baz: I dare you to sing the—
With pursed lips, Draco tilted his head and thought about it. “Yes. That is categorically the worst moment of my life.” He handed Harry a chocolate covered strawberry. “And this is one of the best.”
Draco picked up a useless fork and tapped his glass to gain everyone’s attention. Twenty-one pairs of eyes turned to him curiously. “Is there anyone here that can summon a House Elf?”
“Come in,” Harry yelled from the floor where he struggled with the knots of his trainers.
Without bothering to respond, Draco returned to the lift. Fuck. Where could he find Potter? He’d seen him patrolling Diagon Alley several times. Perhaps that would be the place to start.
“Draco!” Sherri, the owner, greeted him with a smile. “How are things? Your guests?”
“It’s never going to be fixed. There will always be terrible people doing terrible things.”
(1:45 pm) You looked up lemon and limes, didn’t you?
flow from my lips as a soothing balm.
But this was courtship and the goal was to make Theo as miserable as possible.
But then Harry’s hand landed on Draco’s knee. “Is that so?” he said again.
Draco still had his Ministry robes on, dusted with floo powder. He winked and Harry felt a familiar fluttering in his belly. “The lab has a private floo, you know.”
Harry told the story of a sweet muggle recognising him—as James, not Harry—at Tesco, and regaling him with the tale of a mock wedding her granddaughter put on to marry Molly Meow to Peter Pup.
“This one’s got linens. Who wants hundred year old sheets?” Alex lifted the top sheet out and grimaced at the holes and stains in it.
“I want to fuck you,” Draco said, his words slurring together. He nuzzled Harry’s neck and kissed along his jaw. “I can. I know I can. I didn’t drink too much.”
“Maybe she miscounted the days,” Harry said.
Draco pushed the shirt off Harry’s shoulders. He kissed Harry’s collarbone and drew his vest off. “We’re together like this half the time.” He dragged his nails down Harry’s bare chest.
Especially since this one square opened his mind to a possibility he hadn’t had time to explore in the months and years before the war. Free of the horcrux and the influence of Voldemort in his soul and mind, Harry’s thoughts coalesced into a new shape. His blood hummed with this change, but he didn’t know where or how to explore it.
What an utterly shit day, Harry thought as the sky opened up and a deluge of rain soaked him to the skin. Walking home, which seemed like a good idea at the time, turned out to be a mistake of epic proportions.
It threw Harry off kilter to go down to breakfast alone. For two weeks, Draco had walked with him, but this morning Draco ate early and left for the Potions lab before Harry even got to the Great Hall.
“Same time next week?”
“What the fuck are you doing in my house?” Draco asked with as much steel as he could muster. “How did you get in? Should I make way for a team of Aurors too?”
“Beans and Toast?”
“Just checking,” Theo said snidely, “as chaperone. Can’t have you two plotting any secret meetings.” He opened it up and saw that it contained nothing but three truffles. He offered it to Draco.
“Some weird sort of baking tin we’ll have to hide from our friends?”
Potter slung the bag over his shoulder and held his hands out. “Want me to carry him?”
That, and cooking.
“These are the school things, for the older children.” Draco shifted Annie in his arms. “We’ve been collecting everything they need since the letters arrived.” Ms Coddle nodded once again at her assistant and he scribbled away on his clipboard. What the fuck did that mean? “If you’ll follow me, we can look over the paperwork we’ve gathered…”
Harry savoured each caress and kiss. He tried to memorise the feel of Draco’s body joining with his. He hoped each bite left a mark, every finger a bruise so he could remember this vividly tomorrow.
Daria was another matter entirely. She refused to set foot in either of the school rooms and cried so hard that it set off her accidental magic—melding the door with the wall so that
He reached for Draco but Draco leaned back, staring in confusion at the floor.
“You’re making her nervous, Potter. Go bother someone else.”
“I see.” Draco said, crossing his arms. This whole process reeked of ulterior motives. “We weren’t expecting an inspection.”
“You’re never getting rid of me now.”
(10:42 am) Undoubtedly. But I’ll survive. We have the same circle of friends so I’m used to it.
“It’s Sunday, Potter. Don’t you have some sort of Weasley gathering to be attending?”
“I thought you’d be happier. Twenty-four hours isn’t really so long. And you and Harry will probably be able to go home soon.”
“Mm, I missed you too.” Harry led him to the sofa with a smile, but Draco pursed his lips again and inclined his head down the hall to Harry’s bedroom. Harry’s smile widened into a wicked grin as he led the way. He shoved the basket of laundry off the bed, spilling his clothes everywhere, as he pushed Draco to the newly vacated space. “Much better idea.” Harry straddled Draco’s hips and bent down for another searing kiss.
And damn, he got caught by wicked, silvery eyes.
of an anonymous club hook-up has always sounded fun, while the
“It’s not so long.”
But Draco didn’t take it as he had a fork in one hand and toast in the other. “I’ll trust you that it’s appropriately kinky.” He leaned in for a quick kiss to Harry’s cheek. “If it’ll make you happy, I’m game for whatever. Except I’m not tying you up and calling you Daddy.”
Slowly he took Harry as deep as he could manage. Even though he didn’t taste like himself - too much bland water and weird soap - he certainly sounded like himself. He moaned, as Draco licked and sucked, with an array of sounds that finally had Draco enjoying himself enough to feel his own cock thickening.
“No, just offering an incentive to hurry it up.”

“I’d like it if you did. If we could be friends.”
“But you catch my meaning, yeah? Draco!” Harry could hardly contain his laughter. “You read
Harry hadn’t even opened his eyes on Saturday morning when he registered the rain splattering against the windows of his room.
She scoffed loudly.
“I think it’s blue?”
Jealousy
“Excellent come over here.” The four of them crowded around, looking at each other nervously. Draco smiled gently, well aware that many of the kids were still a little wary of the free food, clothing, and housing he’d provided. Kneeling down so he wasn’t looming over them, he said, “Can you call your Elves? I just want to talk to them and see if anyone wants to come work here. For us.” He pointed to the oldest boy. “David, would you go first, please?”
Maybe Harry shouldn’t have given up the last seventeen days of his life debt, he whined to himself as he thought of the beautiful flush of Draco’s skin and the sweet sighs that poured from his mouth.
“I’ll see you at dinner.”
“Who can I speak to about placing a large order?” Draco watched the two people behind the counter eyeing each other, neither willing to help him. “You work on commission? Because I can promise you it’ll be worth your while.”
“Welcome to Weasley—
Draco shoved his hand right into Harry’s pyjama bottoms to give his cock a squeeze and growled against his lips, “We’re going to fuck like mad right here on the dining room table instead of breakfast on the second of September.”
Harry laughed. “Oh I think he’ll like this one. I’m a proud gay man and even I was considering stripping my clothes off for her in that outfit. She…
He didn’t know what to make of Draco’s small gasp and his eyes widening in wild excitement. “You don’t mean…” Draco licked his lips. “I never imagined…” His grin leached the tension out of Harry. “Brilliant idea! Absolutely yes! For how long?”
“You’re getting butter on my pyjamas.”
On Monday night, their last before their friends returned, Harry couldn’t resist sticking his hand in his pyjama bottoms and lightly stroking his cock as the strains of song filled the room and woke the
“Yes... Yours, every day.”

Thursday morning they waved goodbye to their friends, then made a giggling, mad dash for the common room. With all twelve of the other eighth years gone, they had their run of the entire common room in addition to their two rooms. Harry sprawled across the sofa in front of the fireplace, dragging Draco over him.
Ron cast his patronus to send back, relieved to find his usual terrier. “
Draco’s eyes met Pansy’s as three other children mentioned lost or snapped wands. She gave him a sad smile and shrugged. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. “All right, I’ll make a list of everything we need from Diagon Alley. I’ll see what’s happening with Ollivander’s and let you know. But don’t worry, we’ll get wands somehow. Any other questions?” The kids mumbled to each other, but no one spoke up. “Okay then, everyone is dismissed.”
“Do you think they’ve set us free?”
“Doesn’t look like—”
“Dromeda, this is Draco. Er, Malfoy.”
Annie came barrelling at him. He scooped her into a twirling hug before she could knock them both over. “You were sleeping forever!” she said too loudly, right in his ear.
“Not a lot of animals begin with ‘D.’”
“Harry...“ Draco climbed off the bed, reaching for a green pair of knickers in the pile of spilled laundry. “What is this?”
Draco hoped his smile looked gentle enough. “All right. A meal perhaps? A bath?”
Instead of deepening the kiss, Draco said, “Ask me for it. Tell me what you want.”
For only a second, I imagine his blood coursing through me, filling my cock so I could fuck him senseless.
“Blakely isn’t going to let this go,” Draco said, indicating the slovenly uniform. “You’re probably going to get kicked out now.”
he silently asks.
shrivelfig that we can both share a single cup of. That should be enough for some giggly fun but still leave us functional for work tomorrow.”
Pansy’s eyes met Draco’s and he nodded. “Many of the parents will be out of Azkaban within five years,” she said shakily. Auror Blakely sneered, but she kept on. “We’ve included estimated expenses if anyone needs to stay here for a time. To get back on their feet.”
“Me either.”
That wasn’t what Draco meant, but it brought a smile to Potter’s face so he didn’t protest on their way to the dining room.
Draco stayed away for nine days. Nine very long, anxiety-filled days. Usually they exchanged owls or fire called one another. Draco came over for dinner at least once a week. But not this week. Not one connection in nine days.
going to offer to let you read it after I was done but now I’m not.” He stuck his tongue out at Ron for good measure. “But a picnic sounds like fun. Maybe Draco and I will do that for lunch on Saturday.”
“When you two become heads of your respective Houses, you’ll learn that the castle wards are set to alert you when
Simon, chest heaving from the fight, croaks, “Baz…” before pulling me into a searing kiss. “My Baz, so strong, so fast.”
“Is it definite then?” Pansy asked softly.
(5:57 pm) Definitely yes to the wedding. Not sure about the pub.
you, we might be fine.”
Auror Blakely sneered, “We’re here on behalf of the Ministry, Malfoy. We won’t be removing our uniforms.”
Draco’s frown deepened as he read. “Why does this sound familiar?”
Potter followed her, still pleading. “That’s the problem! No one else will either. Please, Dromeda, there aren’t a lot of people we can ask.”
was how Harry phrased it as they lay entwined in his bed. Draco agreed wholeheartedly, and had been waiting for an invitation like that for weeks. He’d moved the rest of his things over the next day.
“It’s not for your charity,” Draco said shortly and began walking away again.
He found a pendant in Hogsmeade of a dragon curled around a pearl. Kreacher made him mini fire drop biscuits to make Draco huff fire. And then, just to make Draco laugh, a hat and mittens set that had tiny dragon spikes running along the back.
“It’s fine,” Harry said as his mind whirred with a new plan. “I think I know how to make it better.”
“What life debt?”
“Please.”
“We’re about to eat lunch! They can’t go having sweets before lunch.”
“A new friend?” Pansy asked, her eyes shining in excitement. “With Pansy Panda!”
Harry laughed at that. “It’s only been two weeks!” Usually they waited six to eight weeks between plans. “Are you horny or did your parents offer up another potential bride?”
“It was just a fracture, Harry. I was able to heal it myself in no time.”
Draco took his husband’s hand and kissed the back of it, already thinking ahead to Harry’s body laid out for him to savour that evening. “Trop longtemps sans mes lèvres sur les tiennes…”
Draco shifted so he could take Potter by the hand. “No,” he said softly, “I don’t suppose I will. But that doesn’t mean I… I can still take care of you. While you take care of me.”
Again, keeping it light and there's not
Shocked whispers broke out, nearly making Draco laugh out loud. Why hadn’t it occurred to any of them to try earlier? Four tentative hands raised in the air.
I lick my lips and coyly look through my lashes at him. “Is it that obvious?”
“Harry, love, are those the decorative pillows from the bed in the spare room?”
And Draco said, “A good eleventh day,” as he had each night of their holiday.
they’re planning a remake-sequel thing, but production is held up because Desdemona Marchbanks might be pregnant.”
Draco’s hand joined Harry’s, tightening his grip. “I
! You want to know why Annie’s terrified of you? Because one day Aurors showed up and took her away ‘for her own safety’ while her father was questioned about his brother’s Death Eater activities. He hasn’t been heard from since. How’s that for a brave and helpful Ministry?”
“I’m not interested in sharing,” Blaise said to Neville as soon as he saw Harry.
“How’s the view from up there?” Ron asked, startling Harry.
“We’re all of age, all technically adults.”
“We’ve still got several weeks ahead of us.”
“Of course I did,” he grinned. “For an Auror, you aren’t very careful about catching
“It does, doesn’t it?” Draco shook his head. “She was so funny, rolling her eyes and saying she’d apparently do anything to get her degree and I said, ‘Even sell your firstborn?’ She snorted so loudly! Oh, it was hilarious.”
“I’d like that.” Harry gave him a hopeful smile as he held the pot of floo powder out. “You’re always welcome here. Always.”
Fuck, this was going to be a disaster. And Harry’s teasing didn’t help. In fact, it made Draco even
As they hurried into the house, giggling like fools, Draco made a mental note to go flying with Harry more often.
Seeing as Harry’s handwriting absolutely sucked, he got Blaise to write the invitation for him.
“Unbelievable, this twist of fate, yeah?” Pansy fiddled with the hem of her jumper again, but her nerves seemed to dissolve as her eyes scanned Harry’s friends. “Nearly all Gryffindors of course. Which one is Seventy-three?” She rolled her eyes. “Draco, how thick are you? It’s Ginny Weasley, isn’t it?”
on a few rocks and set them floating around the garden, now that the sun was on its way down.
For a long minute, Draco and Potter stared at one another through the gates. Should Draco thank him for helping? Did he want to acknowledge that he owed Potter once again? Why couldn’t the spectacled git leave Draco to muddle through alone?
“Right now? Harry it’s…” He glanced back but couldn’t see the clock from where he laid on the sofa. “Really late right now.”
“Excuse you, but you’re really fucking hot and I’ll admit I’m a little excited about watching me fuck you.”
Horrified, Harry’s tongue unfroze just enough for him to croak out, “We were—it was—just—how did you even find out?!”
“Me too,” Draco sighed.
They should develop a code, Harry thought as he went to bed that night. Maybe
could mean
“We already know each other after months and months of sharing classes and a common room. And ugh, time alone is so hard to come by in this stupid school. Can’t we fool around now and chat later?”
“Yes. At the gates. Someone chimed, then disappeared, leaving a warded basket behind.”
“So why haven’t you quit yet? You already know you want to.”
,” Draco said indignantly, secretly pleased they wouldn’t have to fly very high.
Harry laughed nervously and blurted out. “I fancy you.”
“I can,” Draco said softly, but desperately. “I will. I can. So still.”
“I’m sorry, Draco. But your father insisted.” She offered him a sad smile. “You know why.”
“Take me to your room,” Harry said. “So we can celebrate properly.”
“Alas, Potter, that was not part of the negotiations.” He nudged Harry’s hand away with a foot. “Get to it, I don’t have all night.”
“Harry could kill succulents.”
Harry stood to shimmy out of his pyjama bottoms and turned a circle for Draco. “Enjoy it while it lasts because I’m definitely winning the next one.”
And then came the dreaded question from Ron that Harry really should have anticipated. “How did you and Harry, erm, reconnect?”
Draco gave him an incredulous look. “I’m hunting erumpants. What do you think I’m doing in a robe shop?” He continued flicking robes along the rack, looking for some in a suitable size. But the pickings were slim.
“It’s not like that,” Potter said huffily. He shrunk the tunic and shoved it into a pocket. Sighing, he held up a hand. “Look, the Ministry is concerned about what might be happening over here, but after the last few—
He loved this ride into the village. Learning to ride the bike had been a challenge, but well worth it for trips into town. Moments alone and away from the cheerful chaos of his home were rare enough. And he suffered less anxiety in the muggle village than he did the wizarding areas.
“This is mine, next to Draco. You sit there.” She pointed across the table, but that made Libby start whining about losing her seat.
“Sometimes a married bloke needs company too,” the man said, leaning in with a wicked smile. For a second it looked like he might reach for Draco’s hip, but then he was knocked back by a hard shove.
Giggling like idiots, they ran to Harry’s room. Although he didn’t expect Ron back any time soon, Harry still warded the door. He pulled Draco to his bed and brushed their lips together.
“You are so cold. But I can heat you up well enough.”
“Okay Robbie,” Draco said, even though he didn’t think the boy could hear him. “I’m going to take a look at your arm.” He eased the muddy cloak off the boy’s shoulder and found a shredded robe underneath soaked in blood. And three large slashes crossed his upper arm and chest. “Huh,” Draco said in surprise. “That almost looks like…”
He didn’t want to think about their friends returning and real life coming between them once again. Instead he cast a breath freshening charm and kissed Draco as though they had an eternity to spend doing just that. He revelled in the feeling of Draco’s cock pressed against his, and lightly teased them both with light caresses until Draco made a whining, desperate sound. Only then did Harry take both their cocks in hand and stroke them firmly and steadily.
that contract? No physical contact during a courtship.”
As the rest of the week trailed on, Harry noted the differences between serving the life debt and the courtship. Obviously they didn’t hold hands or snog or anything remotely resembling anything physical. And they never got to spend a moment alone, thanks to Theo’s ever-present hovering.
“Harry,” Draco whispered softly, his eyes wide in amazed wonder. He gave up on stroking himself inside his clothes and pushed his pyjamas down his thighs to free his cock entirely. Lightly he ran his fingers up and down his length, almost as if he wanted to display it for Harry.
Flourish and Blotts had a sale on calligraphy and maths primers so he bought a collection of those as well. And even though the Manor library overflowed already, the large coffee-table books of fairy tales and full colour art would make reading aloud more fun. Pretty books with gold binding were just too hard to resist. He bought ink in a variety of colours and quills for the older children, but knew the younger ones would prefer their crayons and muggle felt tip pens.
It would be so easy to give in to the temptation. He could lace their fingers together. Tug Potter in for a kiss. Invite Potter for a moonlight stroll through the garden. Or to stay overnight.
. “I have letters to write.”
Harry made an indignant sound that only made Draco want to kiss him all the more. But Harry stepped away, kicking off his trainers and pulling his wand from his tracksuit bottoms. “All right, what’s the plan here? Beyond the ‘no expelliarmus’ we agreed to earlier.”
Today it felt like a ‘pro’ moment. Arriving at the pub early meant Harry could keep an eye on everyone that came in, and Draco wouldn’t be left awkwardly waiting on him.
“It’s nothing.” At her stern look, he held up his hands. “Nothing yet, anyway. We’re waiting for the results of the inspection.”
Draco choked on an olive halfway through Harry’s sentence. “Why would anyone find Parseltongue kinky? It’s all hissing and spitting. Not sexy at all.”
“I—I guess my trainee robes got me through the system?” Potter asked, not sounding nearly apologetic enough. “I just wanted to ask you a few questions. Casually. Off the record.”
Fucking hell. It figured Potter and Granger hadn’t spread tales of Draco’s good deeds. “Potter offered me help with a project I’m working on. Now is his chance to shine. Ask him yourself.”
“For the war orphans. They’re doing a clothing drive for the kids that lost their homes and stuff.”
“I honestly don’t know. Habit? Convenience? Most of the people I meet these days are parents of young children. She... means well, I think. Just… trying to keep me from being a workaholic?”
“No,” Harry said slowly. “I mean, yeah, this sucks. But I think we needed it. It’s like a great reset on everything.”
“Yeah, well…” Potter ruffled his stupid hair. “That’s not going so well?”
“I’m looking forward to it.”
“You said you didn’t want to fuck around in any more public loos.”
kicking at the same time. When Draco saw Chester coming in to steal the ball from her, he scooped a shrieking Annie up and kicked the ball ahead of him.
Harry giggled as he closed the door to one of the compartments. “Want to call me Potter and I’ll call you Malfoy?”
“Here’s some pyjamas -” Draco’s words cut off at the same time Harry realised the curtain had opened enough to show Draco entirely too much.
“Draco, don’t say ‘shit’ in front of the children.”
“Ooh, so special. What’s with the lights?”
runs something about us as a couple and Orion as our love child.”
“Draco is running an orphanage. Or foster home. In Malfoy Manor.”
Harry set the popcorn bowl on the coffee table and laid them both lengthwise on the sofa. “Well, I either need to run laps around the back garden or ride you like an unbroken abraxan.”
“I think you’ll find that I do.”
croquet, or did they just chase each other with mallets?
Something about the phrasing had Draco frowning. “Hasn’t anyone told you that you’ve done enough?”
Disconnected. A good way to describe the apprehensive feeling Draco had about the scenario. Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head and gave his fingers a squeeze. “That’s good, me too. We can just have a quiet evening as usual. Do you want to watch something? Or read something?”
Draco left the store but, of course, was followed out by Potter. “Hey! Malfoy! Wait!”
Because Harry did
“Okay, thanks Chester, that’s enough!” Draco said quickly, scared of what this little boy might say. They didn’t want to give Potter reason to return with a warrant.
That occupied both number five on the ‘pro’ list of attributes, and number two on the ‘con’ list of attributes that Draco had playfully put together about Harry.
How did he not realise Draco kept to such a strict schedule? Promptly at eight the next morning, he knocked on Harry and Ron’s door.
Rejection didn’t seem likely to Harry. After all, who would refuse
“There are others.”
Harry pulled out the contract and waved it at Theo. “It says that at both formal and casual ‘repast,’ we may sit next to one another, so long as we ‘leave a handbreadth of space for the honour of our ancestors’ between us.” Harry rolled his eyes at the wording. “That means I can sit next to Draco.”
He hated that his regular Healer was next door with Harry. Healer Jane had a sweet demeanor that never made Ron feel guilty for the scrapes Harry and the other Aurors got him into. And sometimes she snuck him a lolly like she used to when he was seven.
“Unless one of us is hiding a uterus up our arses, no.” Draco leaned back against the door with a warm smile. “Now… it’s just you and me here.” He sauntered forward and almost reached for Harry. “You brilliant boy. Have you figured a way around the chastity spells too?”
Harry thought he should complain about the cold tiles on one side and the shower curtain sticking to him on the other. Or Draco hogging the hot water so he only got cooled, leftover drips. Or the hard floor of their shower they forgot to cushion with a charm.
(1:46 pm) Literally speaking, I hate meringue unless it’s in a macaron so get key lime pie.
Potter followed, “No, it’s not my charity. I just help a lot because, er…” he blushed and Draco was silently thankful Potter didn’t go on about his ‘Saviour’ status and how helpful he was to an organization like that. As if Draco didn’t know the Golden Boy shone like the sun.
child.” Draco grinned and served himself a second helping of lasagne.
Draco took that as an invitation to bite Harry on the arse. He laughed at Harry’s tiny squeal. “Not likely!”
Draco yanked his hand away from Harry and they both wiped their faces, trying to look like it wasn’t the second of September already.
Potter smiled and bumped their shoulders together. “I’m glad you asked.” After a brief pause, he settled Teddy in the crook of his arm and pulled out his wand. “May I? You look like shit.”
“Any day now?” Draco asked with a laugh. How many times had he heard Potter say that?
But now, his brain reasoned, he could have this little piece of Draco. Have a sample of the toys Draco liked to play with. And then when Draco spluttered in embarrassment, maybe Harry could smoothly assure him it was all right, that he had similar tastes. Or that he could fill Draco better than any toy ever could. That they could be so, so good together.

“First there was this unexpected pressure that just pushed right into me and this
“We have the space and the resources—”
“All right, my drunken fool, let’s get you to bed.” Draco cast a featherweight charm on Harry to make him easier to guide through their cottage.
“Don’t get attached to people’s names. Undoubtedly your wife will have dated a Brad or an Andrew and will despise the name.”
Draco scoffed. “What on earth do I have to be nervous about? I’ve known you half my life! Do we even have secrets anymore?”
From his messenger bag he pulled out the first pair of shrunken trunks. “Alex and David,” he called out, looking at the nervous group. The two boys came forward as Draco enlarged the trunks. “Prepare for everyone to treat you with suspicion and remember it takes a special sort of bravery to stand strong against their hatred. But I swear if that bravery sorts you into Gryffindor, David, I will write a special song to mock you and teach it to all the children to sing in a Howler.” He gave the shaky boy a hug and nodded to Alex. “Stick close to Alex on the train ride. He’ll look out for you.”
He shook away his depressing thoughts as he opened the door to Another Man’s Treasure and almost collided with Auror Blakely.
“It builds suspense. And I think it’s funny. I hope you like it. Although it’s honestly okay if you don’t. Especially since it’s a silly thing and we just cleaned out the toy box.”
“Fuck, Harry, you should see yourself. I can’t believe this is real.” Draco wrapped his hand firmly around his cock and started to pull faster. “I’m right on the edge. I’m so close Harry. Tell me you’re close. Tell me you want it.”
She smiled and tapped at her register. Draco paid, then added an extra ten pound note. “For the poor person who has to clean up after us,” he said with a wink. The woman smiled at him gratefully as she took the money.
Draco’s mind filled with images of Greyback and Scabior and their disgusting pack of followers. All looking just as ragged and worn, filthy and ravenous as Jane. “We can’t just leave them to fend for themselves.”
“Oh Merlin,” Draco sighed, closing his eyes against a wave of lust. “Claudia sent me home early because I’m useless over that one photo. I can’t imagine what more might do to me.”
All the same, she wanted it in writing. Harry gave her the table the goblins created to show her potential expenses for two years of education and provided a statement that he expected nothing in return for the scholarship.
“Not to brag,” he said, “but I have loads of money. I won’t even miss it. But there’s only one Draco in my life and if you hadn’t met with him, he never would have agreed to marry me. This is thanks for opening his eyes and nothing else.”
“Indeed. Magic is brilliant for that.” He paused for a moment then said, “Well? Aren’t you going to give it a try?”
“I just—I noticed you’ve got a lot of kids sized equipment and I—is it for the W-O-F?”
Auror Blakely and Harry glared at each other, then Harry set Blakely’s wand in the centre of the table. Blakely snatched it up and holstered it with a huff.
next, and had to give the author credit for making Benedict, a viscount with an appropriately tragic backstory, far more creative with the life debt owed to him by Jocelyn, a snobby and entitled daughter of a duke that needed bringing down a peg or two.
“Are you?” She wore traditional dress robes, not even attempting muggle styling as the other guests had. But it could pass for an eccentric dress so Harry didn’t object. She eyed his black morning suit and mostly-tamed hair with a cold face. “I’m not sorry you lived. That day in the forest. Even if it’s caused us more trouble than we expected.”
He tried not to think about how they only had six days left.
“Let’s start tomorrow,” Draco laughed, the sparkle of mischief in his eye. “Since today is nearly over.”
She hugged Harry in Ron’s body as well and then it was Harry’s turn to look confused.
“Thank you!” He scanned the colourful art, searching for anything recognisable. “It’s so green. Did you know green is my favourite colour? I like this part best.” He pointed to a set of green slashes topped with red circles.
extra glasses...”
(5:56 pm) To the wedding, or to the pub?
“Harry!” Draco cooed. “This is… just so fucking cute!”
“He’s fine.
“It’s not!” the little girl blurted out. “We were attacked a few nights ago. But it wasn’t anything dangerous. Just a wild dog.”
“Not that kind of calm. Come on, let’s go sit down.” Harry sipped his tea and led Draco to their sitting room. They sat together on the sofa, with Harry sitting sideways to face him. “Today’s task is Legilimency.”
To add to the ridiculous sentimentality, he also pulled two pouches of red rose petals from the box and gave one to Draco. As they scattered petals on the water, Harry said, “Here’s to all the kisses I missed. The chance for a hand down my pants or a hot mouth on my—”
a dildo? As in a toy that gets inserted in places?”
Weasley’s scowl morphed into confusion as the Patronus dissolved. “I’ll be damned. He’s actually coming to help
“Oh Master Davie… you is getting Pickles in trouble!” The Elf twisted his hands in his tea towel.
And so Harry found an airy cashmere scarf in a grey that matched Draco’s eyes perfectly. As he wrapped it carefully around Draco, so as not to buzz either of them, he couldn’t help but imagine a day when he could bury his face in it and nuzzle along Draco’s neck.
“I know.”
Potter and Draco turned towards the shrill call.
He started with a black pair in an all over lace, similar to what Malfoy had been wearing. They had more stretch than he would have thought. He wiggled around, barely able to feel the lightweight fabric at all. He admired the look in the mirror and giggled nervously to himself. What was he doing?
A continuation of the last SnowBaz (ch 23)!
Astoria peeked inside and stroked the tiny fist resting on the blanket. “Who is ‘they’? The Ministry, I suppose.” She gathered the baby in her arms and nuzzled his cheek. “Oh sweet baby! What will we call you?”
It took a little elbowing but finally the witch came forward with a forced smile. Draco tried pulling her aside, out of Potter’s eavesdropping range, but that proved impossible when the spectacled git continued to follow him. Draco was forced to explain his desire to buy sixteen brooms, while at the same time refusing to explain who the brooms were for or why. It was no one’s business who lived at his house.
That didn’t sound like good news to Draco, but he didn’t want Greg to worry. He nodded his understanding and ushered Greg back to the lifts for the trip home.
She offered Draco a square chocolate with shimmery gold dust on top. “Here, on the house. Bourbon liquor truffle.” With efficient, practised movements she assembled her largest box. “You’ll be wanting to buy the larger box then?” she said to Harry.
It wasn’t unusual for Harry to stop by after work. And with all the chaos of the day, Draco probably
(7:37 pm) You do crossword puzzles on your lunch break.
Harry didn’t have anything special in mind for the day, aside from spending as much time together as they could. Draco suggested brewing again, but Harry hated the lab and thought that would be boring.
“Oh I’m definitely going to suck something,” Harry said with his typical sexy grin. The widened lips, definitely magicked a darker shade than usual, showed off his eye teeth. Draco’s breath caught when he noticed they were a little longer and sharper than usual. His blood began to rush south as Harry stalked closer.
“Ah, Draco…” Harry straightened a little more and teased the head of his cock. He rolled his hips until he found an angle that put a light, but constant pressure on his prostate. Heat rolled through his body, combining with the heat of the water to warm him inside and out. He tugged at his bollocks, adding another layer of pleasure that had his legs shaking.
“I don’t know.”
Nothing excited him anymore.
“I’m looking for Trainee Potter. Is he here?” Draco asked with as much meekness as he could muster.
A new wave of heat curled through Harry, making him groan as his cock gave a half-hearted twitch of support. Harry pushed Draco to the bed and straddled his hips. He ran a hand down Draco’s belly and tugged at his waistband. “Can I? Is it too much?”
“Want one?” Malfoy asked, showing Harry the large box of assorted flavours. “A gift from a secret admirer,” he smirked, as though Harry didn’t have admirers of his own.
Another excruciatingly silent half hour passed. About halfway through, Harry very nearly asked Draco if he wanted to play chess but thought that might be laying it on a little thick. Theo looked near enough to snapping and Harry probably didn’t need to poke that nundu much harder.
Harry laughed merrily and pinched Draco’s hips playfully. “There’s a sexy innuendo in there but I can’t quite catch it.”
“Wow, sticking with ‘number four honest,’ are we?” Draco asked, raising one eyebrow at Harry.
“Well,” she said, looking expectantly at Draco while tucking her phone away. “It’s late and we should be heading out.”
“You’re sure you don’t want to take some with me?” Harry asked, taking the vial.
“You don’t have to do this,” Draco said, his voice low enough only Harry could hear. “We could… could…”
Ms Coddle scanned the grounds. “The wards that are set—they were put in place by your father?”
) with a bright and hopeful smile for Draco.
Shrugging, Draco said, “Practice, I guess.”  Potter nodded, blushing down at his shoes, then turned to leave. Draco grabbed his arm to halt him. “Why did Shacklebolt send Granger?”
Although Draco had plenty of robes of his own, he also wore the muggle clothing occasionally in support of the other children. He would never admit it, but he loved the way the denim felt against his legs. Nor would he ever admit that tracksuit bottoms weren’t terribly different from his Quidditch practice gear and made chasing small children easier.
“I’m not planning on
kiss you when you say you love me.”
“Maybe you’ll be there as a plus one,” Ron said, winking theatrically at Harry. “Wouldn’t that be a hilarious thing to tell our past selves?”
They’d sent the potion sample from the accident to the lab ages ago. Or at least it felt like ages in this tiny room in a dumb hospital gown. Surely Malfoy had a chance to look at the report and was ready to come check on Ron. Or maybe Healer Jane would come see him after she finished with Harry.
That Friday Daphne went in for her evaluation, and Draco heaved a sigh of relief when she beamed that all had gone well. Draco’s good mood only lasted a minute and a half, because Harry Potter rolled through the floo as well, nearly knocking Draco and Daphne over.
“I do. I just got caught up in…”
“You saved me, Draco. I could have died.”
“Of course not. But we
“What?”
“Yes.”
As Draco banished Harry’s clothes to the laundry hamper, Harry cooed, “Ooh, so sexy using your sexy magic to get me naked.”
“You can’t put your arm there, my arm goes there.”
Aurors Blakely and Reed scowled at that. Behind them, Weasley and Potter began unbuttoning their robes without waiting for Draco to respond. It was a third Auror that Draco didn’t recognise that stopped them. “We’re required to be in uniform when on Ministry business.”
“Exactly. Nowhere else to go. So perhaps they’re looking for a way to let us keep them, seeing as no one else wants them.”
“You can’t mean that,” Harry said, using his foot to keep Draco’s bedroom door open. “You can’t possibly convince me you want to work on Herbology instead of spending some time with me without Theo and the others hovering around.”
“That’s another win for me,” Draco sang, plucking at Harry’s pyjama bottoms. “What’re you taking off next?”
“Where?” Draco asked, already pushing Harry’s shirt up to comply.
“I was hoping you would come to that conclusion.”
Draco was a complete and utter fool for miniature foods, and Harry knew it. Either it fitted the theme that Draco couldn’t discern yet, or else Harry wanted to butter him up for a ridiculous request. Draco took a sip of his wine and then ate a cube of sharp white cheddar, already knowing he’d say yes.
"Interesting,” Mrs Stokke said, evenly and without judgement. “Auror Blakely. If you could outline for me the objections the DMLE has concerning the application.”
But then he darts a glance at me and I know he’s done it all on purpose. Gaze locked on mine, he takes a long, slow lick of his cone, swirling his tongue at the top and sucking up a chocolate chip, leaving a smear of ice cream across his lips.
“Like, at all? Even innocent touches? That might be hard to work around.” He would have to look over the contract as soon as possible, and see what loopholes he could find.
We're halfway through the year!
Harry shuffled the hangers in the wardrobe again, to cover up the empty space where Draco’s clothes used to hang.
They both giggled and Harry licked at a bright red spot on Draco’s neck. “I love you fucked into incoherence.”
, Draco… that’s so good… Can I come on your face?”
My first glimpse was a tiny flash as he pulled off his school jumper, just there and gone before I even knew it. It took four days of scheming around his showering schedule to be in the right place at the right time to verify what I
in my body, did you?!”
“Theo Nott is your closest relative at Hogwarts.”
suggestion.”
“Oh that’s so sweet,” Ron cooed. “Except I know what sort of book that is, and it’s probably a
“I know, that’s why I set up warming charms. Come look!”
The first thing Harry did the next day was set up an account at Gringotts for Regina Davenport. He had no idea how much a Magical Law degree might cost, but the goblins helped him to estimate tuition, books, and incidentals, as well as the small addition of a stipend for living expenses. He transferred the lump sum to her new vault, along with a thank you note.
Draco had ‘I told you so’ written all over his face. “We get two supervised half hour visits per week in a private setting. Otherwise, we are to remain ‘in the public eye.’”
She frowned at him. “I was invited.”
Draco dropped his mock seduction and pouted. “You have
“Damn, Hermione,” Harry yelled from the bathroom. “You are one lucky girl. I can’t make it go away!”
“What else would it be?”
Something in his tone of voice made Harry look up. Draco sat on their dining room table, spreading his legs to make room for Harry.
Draco seemed to be the only one that objected to Potter’s continued visits. By Friday, Pansy had enough and begged him to please shut the fuck up about it. “Potter saved our arses and Orion—he can visit if he wants to!” She extended the invitation to Andromeda as well, without even asking Draco first.
“No, erm…” Harry glanced back at Ron. “No it’s fine… Erm, let me just… I’ll get dressed and we can get breakfast?”
“I thought we’d do mine first. You can have it inside you while I ride you. Then some other time we can reset it and try yours with me.”
It wouldn’t take much for Harry to close the distance between them and press their lips together. But it was entirely too early in their relationship for that. Wasn’t it? He didn’t want Draco thinking that was all Harry wanted, even if Draco seemed to want the same. How to let Draco down gently?
Draco bit back a smile and raised one eyebrow at him. “Is that so?”
“I wonder why they’d do that. He looked healthy before.”
He wanted to look at his Five Year Plan one more time. He got a tiny thrill when he saw it, even though it remained unsigned and no one even knew how brave he’d been to post it in the first place.
Draco paced by the fireplace and smiled as Harry entered the room. “What do you want to do first?” He offered his hand, palm up. “Want to hold hands?” As Harry took his hand, he whispered, “We could skip breakfast, and find somewhere more private to… to hang out.” He darted a glance around the common room. Although it was still empty at this hour, others would be waking up soon.
“And I want…”
Draco didn’t let his eyes stray to the nosy Ministry official or the angry Auror. “Actually yes.” He didn’t elaborate, and he noticed Mr Note-taker didn’t write down her question or his answer. “Most of them,” he added after an awkward pause.
The door opened, saving Draco from further confessions. He and Potter jumped to their feet to greet Ms Coddle and Andromeda as they exited, both smiling and laughing. Andromeda reached for Teddy, kissing his cheek as she rested him on her hip.
“For cutting our thirty days short?”
Draco directed Mr Evergreen and Mr Buckthorn to the side yard where Daphne and Theo waited. The rest of them split up inside the house. Draco sent up one last mental plea to whatever gods were listening and began to walk Ms Coddle through the house once again. Auror Blakely wasn’t the least bit subtle about casting detection spells in every room they passed through. Ms Coddle did her best to ignore him and praised Draco for the welcoming, cheery home he’d created for the children.
Carefully dressed in a long nightshirt, Robbie slept on a cushioned chaise in a corner of the conservatory wrapped in a warm blanket. Jane sat at his side, steadily downing sandwiches and watching them all suspiciously as they whispered in a tight group on the other side of the conservatory.
Four spoiled teens that grew up with House Elves knew fuck-all about preparing food. Although Theo and Draco could brew potion after potion, following a recipe for chicken alfredo ended up in a clotted mess of cream and burned chicken. How hard was it to boil pasta? Damn near impossible, as it turned out. They subsisted on cheese toasties, crisps, and the odd apple or banana.
“Chastity spells?” Harry hadn’t even known such a thing existed.
Harry wished Draco could rest his head in Harry’s lap so he could stroke Draco’s hair or feed him grapes. But alas, he had to smile from across the picnic blanket. “Are you having fun?” he asked quietly when it seemed everyone else was absorbed in their own conversations.
“Right, of course. Pickles,” Draco began again, “we were wondering if you’d like to come work for us.”
“Wrong, there’s plenty we can do in the woods. It’s just all more comfortable in the privacy of a bedroom.” He winked at Harry as he sat back. “It’s fine. You can be the killjoy this time. We can save a first kiss for later.”
Harry picked the popcorn off his t-shirt and shrugged, his pupils starting to dilate. “It’s sweet and tasty and rare. I don't think I’ve ever had shrivelfig tea before.”
As he got the hang of it, Draco’s hands tangled in the sheets to keep himself still against the pleasurable tingling all over his chest. Harry paused above the button of Draco’s trousers. Draco’s cock strained against the fabric and another soft moan fell from his lips.
Ron gestured with his beer. “If you want him to take better care of himself, you should have food delivered to his house, like his
Theo handed him a vial of Wide-Eye potion, jolting him awake for his meeting with the Charity Commision. Hopefully none of their ‘examinations’ involved a close look at his heart rate.
She shoved a roll of parchment into his hands, babbling frantically. “About an hour after you left. Aurors came—Blakely and—and—I can’t remember the other one. They said we didn’t have proper paperwork for an infant and… Draco, what are we going to do?”
“I would let you,” Harry said, offering him the mittens. “It’s still cool enough that you can wear them sometimes.”
“Especially since I already drank two while waiting for the popcorn to pop.”
“That’s because tonight… You’re going to woo me in French.” Harry waggled his eyebrows at Draco in a way that was meant to be seductive, but always looked adorably silly.
“Anything your heart requires that the hotel can provide. Which, judging from the brochure, is just about anything. Full service, a modern day Room of Requirement. Except better because there’s food provided.”
“My dearest, home from work early! Excited about this evening or you couldn’t stand one more minute at the shop?”
The suggestion surprised Draco. Usually when they went out for breakfast, they went down the road to the local café. They hadn’t been to Incredible Edibles in ages. Long enough that Draco had nearly forgotten the adorable café with more plants than a Hogwarts greenhouse and the best French toast Draco had ever had.
“No,” Pansy whined. “We can’t drink anymore. We’re out of hangover potions.”
“Do you want to floo home from here? Or… I was just about to order some take-away. I can find you some clean clothes if you’d like to join me.”
Harry struck a pose, his nose high in the air, and said, “What do you think?”
“I didn’t think you’d like it so much,” Harry whispered, his eyes twinkling merrily. “Should I think about making it permanent?”
“Yes.”
“I know, it’s just…” Harry looked around at the passing students on their way to their first lessons of the day. “I liked spending my day with you.” The light of mischief had him grinning. “Want to skive off classes and sneak into Hogsmeade?”
Harry stared down at his fingers curling in the hem of Draco’s sleeve. “What if you leave me?” he said quietly.
“Challenge accepted.” Harry stood, pulling Draco along with him. “Let’s get naked and we’ll use a light incarcerous to tie our hands together. My right to your left. I guarantee by the end, you’ll be screaming my name.”
Harry shook his head at the daily worry. “You’re worrying over nothing. It’s going to work out.” He smiled at Draco. “I wish I could hold your hand.”
“Yeah but… It’s for children in need? Do you think you could spare a few?” He lifted his own empty basket.
Harry’s shrug set him off balance enough that he stumbled. “Well it worked out all right in the end, didn’t it? Why are you so tall?”
Draco rolled his eyes but with a smile on his face. “It’s your turn.”
He knew that Draco would. If Harry really wanted to, Draco would go with him and they could spend the whole day together. But Draco never missed lessons and Harry couldn’t ask him to.
Draco didn’t know if it was good news or bad news that they were all being called, one at a time, to Matilda Coddle’s office in Charity Commissions.
“We’ll still be carrying on with the interviews of your staff, and there are other evaluations that need to be made before approval is met. But yes, for today, you can have Orion back.”
“I don’t have one anymore.”
Hannah Abbott? No, she worked with Draco sometimes in Herbology and she had a much more flowing cursive, typical of someone that grew up writing with a quill.
Draco arched his hips up into Harry. “It’s dark and cold out so I don’t think you want to be running around outside.”
“Bloody fucking…” Draco moaned, covering his face.
“Why don’t you have a jumper or coat? It’s freezing out!” Draco licked his lips, barely controlling the impulse to tear Harry’s shirt open.
want?”
“I have to get my jollies somehow, don’t I?” Draco said, his blush deepening. He scrunched up his nose at Harry’s snort of laughter. “I wish I could shove you right now!”
Draco laughed, “Please tell me you don’t want to take pictures.”
He could hear Harry’s laugh as he went out the kitchen door. And anyway, Draco had replaced those chocolates so he didn’t know why they needed to keep bringing it up. Moments later Harry returned with a box wrapped in shiny blue paper and tied with a ribbon.
“What if it still doesn’t work?” Simon asks as his hand hovers a few inches from the gate. “It didn’t at your Leavers Ball last year.”
“You are out of your fucking mind! There are twenty-seven of us, Draco! Twenty-seven people and two House Elves and you’re going to put all of us at risk for two mangy little—”
“As if anyone believes you ride that bike. Oh!” she snapped her fingers with a triumphant grin. “You contacted him through his Molly Meow blog.”
Trudging along to the Ministry Atrium, Harry flooed home and sat on his bed with a huff to bemoan his fate. But whining never filled his belly. He dug through the clean laundry basket he’d left on his bed for jeans and a t-shirt, then threw together a quick meal.
“That’s because I’m outside the spray of water,” Draco deadpanned.
“Thank you, I guess. Dean made it for me. Well, for you. I just told him what I wanted and…”
and make
“I would kiss you right now if I could.”
“Sure, as soon as you show up with some chocolate baklava.” Which reminded Harry that there were pastries to be had. He plucked a cream puff from the box and ate it in a single bite. “Mmm, these are delicious!”
“You—you didn’t? I thought everyone in our year did.”
...” He tucked the violin back under his chin and started a different song, one he could play from memory. The bow shook as it crossed the strings, but Harry didn’t mind the warbling. Not if it was a sign of Draco’s own arousal.
“It’s absolutely weird. But I’ve always been curious about what our sex life feels like for you.”
“You look like you need a hug,” Harry said quietly. “I wish it could come from me.”
“There’s no way you’ll be up in time for breakfast.” Draco stood and stretched, letting Harry enjoy the view. “Have fun soaking your wood.”

“That’s not—that can’t be it…” Harry said, his words trailing off uselessly. That sounded
“Really? You can’t tell by the moaning and writhing that it’s amazing?” Draco didn’t want to drop his hair in, afraid of the colour of the potion. But it turned a shimmery gold much like Harry’s had. Hopefully his exhale didn’t sound like a sigh of relief.
“Again, I’ll point out the moaning and writhing.”
“How’re you holding up?” Harry asked, resting his arm around Draco’s waist. “You’re looking a little pale.”
“Alex and Jason first,” Pansy said. She took Daphne’s hand. “Let’s get started, I suppose.”
“Catching up. I’m free today, and can’t you use the extra help?”
“Mother,” Draco said formally as the headmistress left. “May I present Mr Potter. Mr Potter, my mother, Lady Malfoy.”
And yet, neither of them are about father's day. Happy Father's Day to all the dads worth celebrating!
“Right, of course. As you wish.”
to Hermione! You know that!”
Draco. Inside him, where Harry longed to be more than anything. Sometimes he thought he had a shot at it, sharing smiles over take-away cartons and beer. He’d tried to wrangle the offer of an overnight on the sofa, but his own flat was a quick floo trip away, and he chickened out each time. What if Draco didn’t see him the same way and it ruined the friendship they’d developed?
But it really wasn’t. The marshmallows were heavy and awkward and getting them to stick to the straw was a lesson in laughing frustration. But he did it. He moved more marshmallows in a minute than Harry managed.
This is the end of the castle tour mini-series!
“Draco?” she asked hesitantly. “Is Harry really going to be spending more time here? Is he—he’s not going to tell? Is he? About me and Robbie?”
Draco took his hand and they started walking in the direction of Ron and Hermione. “Wait a minute. So when Ron said he lost that chess game to Victoire because he ‘lost a bet’ — you mean he
“You’re welcome?” Harry didn’t mean to sound questioning, but he didn’t expect the weird backhanded compliment. “I asked Draco once if I incurred a life debt with you that day.”
“That’s exactly what I said!” Harry responded with a grin.

Next to her, Chester bounced excitedly, “Can his room be next to mine?”
Harry gave Draco a quick once-over and didn’t think he’d mind flirting with him a bit. The idea of a ‘type’ seemed strange to him when people came in so many interesting shapes and sizes. But appearance mattered far less than intelligence and wit. And Harry already knew Draco was clever and funny. His soft, boring-office-job body looked enticing enough, as did the two or three inches of height he had on Harry. All good things.
“There’s loads I want to say but I won’t.” He winked at Harry and set his lantern on the water.
“Sorry,” Theo said, not looking sorry at all, “but the contract forbids private conversations.”
“You know what?” Harry said slowly. “It
“You did really well, Malfoy. I’m impressed.” Potter put his Trainee robes on but didn’t button them.
Thankfully he had friends willing to help with mischief. He wrote a short note to Draco and gave it to Ron to give to Hermione. She could slip it to Draco in Arithmancy, where Theo wouldn’t see.
“And the rest of our lives,” Draco said evasively. He still wasn’t sure about tomorrow’s plan either. Fuck, but the rest of the month better have more fun and less dubious morality.
Theo opened it with a tight smile. “Right on time.”
Grimmauld Place wasn’t exactly the pleasant haven either of them hoped for. With both Kreacher and Harry at Hogwarts full time, there wasn’t any reason or time to maintain it.
(7:36 pm) There is no job more boring than yours. Easy enough to see you aren’t up to anything nefarious.
(7:35 pm) After chance, fate, destiny brought us together again?! No way!
Harry waggled his eyebrows in a way Draco should not find attractive and said, “So we can have a wizard’s duel, of course.” He summoned their favourite lube with a grin, “First one to shoot white sparks from their wand loses.”
“Or maybe his girlfriend didn’t know him as well as she thought she did,” Draco said, causing dead silence at their end of the table. He paused with his beer halfway to his mouth. “What? Did I say something wrong?”
“Bonne idée, mon petit chou,” Draco said with a little wink.
Harry had the vague feeling he’d been to this forest before. But then, after the wretched Horcrux hunt, he tended to feel that way about all of the wooded outdoors and therefore avoided it whenever possible, even after all these years.
“I—I have your wand,” Potter said softly, pulling a familiar length of hawthorn from his pocket.
