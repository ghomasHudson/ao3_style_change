"Hermione, he's still not talking to us. It's been a week," Ron exclaimed as he flopped himself onto his bed.
He put the cloak on as he left the common room, whispering, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." The map appeared, and he searched for a single small dot in particular. He found it, in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. It was pacing the room, waiting for a certain raven-haired boy. Harry went as fast as he could while still being quiet. After five minutes, he was at the door that went into the bathroom.
So yes, he cried a lot that day. But you couldn't blame him, he bloody well deserved to be crying. So no one stopped him, and Harry probably could have filled an entire swimming pool with his tears. But eventually, he stopped. Not because he was done crying, he was simply exhausted. So the tears subsided, replaced with soft snores, head resting on Draco's chest.
"Looking for Draco?" Harry jumped, and turned around. Pansy stood behind him, a smirk painted across her face. He nodded. "Well, you won't find him there, since he basically moved out."
Because Harry was bi. Harry James Potter was The Bi Who Lived. And he didn't try to deny it, not even a little. He welcomed it, with open arms, because this was who he was.
Harry had invited them to dinner with the Weasley's, but he really just wanted to see his godson. "He's gotten so big!" Harry said, with a genuine smile on his face.
"Aren't I? I'm a freak. My stupid aunt and uncle were right. I'm a bloody freak, Hermione." A few tears had started to spill from his eyes.
When they got there, the searched the room thoroughly. Hermione found a note on Theo's pillow, but she quickly shoved it in her pocket before anyone else could read it. "I know where he is." Everyone turned to look at her. "He's in the Shrieking Shack."
"Oh, Master Draco, you is done waiting outside now? Pretzel has been worrying for you, what if yous gets too cold?" Draco gave a warm chuckle, and crouched down on his knees so he was level with the elf.
"Green, green apples, and you actually have no idea who his soulmate is, nor does he. Also, what is his obsession with green? Does he love his house that fucking much?" Pansy stood there with her mouth open, staring at the boy in front of her with wide eyes.
Harry couldn't handle it. Ron would talk to him, and they'd end up fighting. Hermione wasn't even trying anymore. This was it; the Golden Trio was coming to an end. He could tell Ron and Hermione had been fighting too, and he knew it was because of him. Harry ruined everything. He destroyed everything he touched.
Pansy had liked Hermione since their sixth year. She had never told anyone this, not even Draco. Although, he did know she was lesbian.
"You haven't been out of the house in a week! Merlin Harry, how are you not going insane," Pansy sighed, giving him a weird look. Harry muttered something under his breath, folding his arms and pouting like a child.
"Why are you trying to set us up anyway? I'm a death eater, and he's the bloody savior, it would never work out."
"Just follow me. We're apparating, but we need to be outside the gates first." Harry hesitated, but nodded, and the two continued walking along the stony pathway to the gates of Malfoy Manor. When they reached the gate, Draco used his wand to open them, smiling a bit as he did. It felt good, the familiar grip on his wand, and the warmth that spread through his fingertips whenever he used it.
There was a knock at the door. "I'll get it," Hermione said as she got up from the couch. She opened the door, and Zabini was standing there. "It's for you, Pansy."
"Well, Ronald thinks Harry's got a secret girlfriend now. I mean honestly, I think I would be able to tell if my bro-best friend had a girlfriend."
"Oh really, how interesting. It makes sense though. You know, last year he climbed a tree just to get my attention."
"First of all, you can't tell me that silence wasn't brutally awkward. And second, seeing as I'm going to be your boyfriend for the next little while, we should probably get to know each other a bit  better."
"Brilliant, she fancies you too." And with that, Pansy dragged Draco away, and Harry tried to ignore his feelings. Feelings that were pointless, and a waste of his time.
"I'll be right back," he told everyone, and went up the many flights of stairs. When he got to the room he was staying in, he went to his trunk, and opened it. When he found what he was looking for, he turned and sat on the bed. He took the Maurader's Map, and sat on the edge of the bed.
"Harry, give me your wrist." Harry looked up at him, quickly taking his hand off his wrist, and hiding his left arm behind his back.
The two parted ways, and Harry trudged over to where Ron and Hermione were, taking a seat next to Hermione, who was in the middle, and pulled out his Potions textbook.
"I got married," he said excitedly, pulling away suddenly, eyes darting between his mother and father eagerly. Lily chuckled under her breath while James gave the three-year-old a dorky smile. Toddlers really are adorable.
"Not a word about this, Malfoy," Harry growled, cutting him off. He cursed under his breath when he could feel himself going a bit red, and turned, swimming back to the bank where the judges were, Malfoy following behind him. He ignored the people in the stands, and Hermione giggling behind her hand, wrapped in a towel.
"Sorry bud, but your mom and I have to go to work. I'm sure you'll make tons of friends, and then when you come home we can celebrate with ice cream with Moony and Padfoot. That sound alright?" James questioned, ruffling the boy's hair, causing him to scramble away from where he was glued to his dad, and send a glare his way. As intimidating as Harry tried to be, his parents only laughed, causing the little boy to pout and cross his arms.
At Hogwarts, there are plenty of places connected with bad memories. Hermione wasn't sure Harry could handle it all. But Harry insisted he go, to finish his education. He had been offered a job as an auror a little while back, but turned it down. He had lost all interest in becoming one. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do, but he'd find something.
"Best friends." She smiled, and walked away. Ron watched her leave, his gaze lingering after she'd gone back inside the castle. Shame, really. She really was a beautiful girl. But he was no good for her, that much he knew. He let a single tear slip, before he said goodbye to the pain that was stabbing his heart. Hermione deserved better.
The blond gave a small smile. "Yeah, it's me." The other boy returned the smile. By now the others had realized that Harry was awake, and they rushed over. Madame Pomfrey shoved everyone out of the way while she did more tests on him, and handed him a glass of water. After he'd downed that, she gave him a potion. Instantly, the pain in his head lessened, though it didn't leave completely.
"Because I'm, well I don't know what I am actually, but I like Luna. So Harry and I had a mutual agreement to break up."
"It's not even that big of a deal, you're just turning it in to one," Harry said, finally looking up, but not at Draco.
Harry turned his head and made eye contact with the younger girl, forcing a small smile. "Neville, do you think I could talk to Harry alone for a bit?" Neville nodded, and grabbed his Herbology homework to do in the common room. Ginny sat down on the bed so she was facing Harry.
"No, I don't actually. I didn't ask what you smell, did I? No, because it's personal." Draco snapped, wanting Harry to just drop it.
If you ever wish to see Draco again, come to the Shrieking Shack, unarmed and alone, in the next twenty-four hours. A friend of mine has unfinished business with you, as do I. And don't expect to come back alive either. The longer you wait, the longer your stupid Slytherin boyfriend gets hurt. Don't show, and he dies.
Draco would admit he hadn't grown up in the best environment. His parents, more specifically his father, had taught him to believe in things he now knew to be false. But despite all that, he really did love his parents. He did feel that his father deserved Azkaban though. A man can make his own choices, and suffer the consequences to follow. His father had made his choices, and these were the consequences.
"But you'd be dead, Harry! Is that what you want? Don't act like you'd have wanted that instead of a little extra help from us all."
"No, but she was telling me about how she likes Draco, and I got really jealous. That has to mean something, right?" Ginny paused, before realization struck her like a kick in the head.
"Cissy?" Lily had been quite close to Narcissa, as Severus was usually hanging around her and some of the other Slytherins, but they'd drifted apart after Narcissa Black became Narcissa Malfoy and Lily Evans became Lily Potter.
"Harry, put the wand down," Draco stated, keeping his voice steady, though he was a bit frightened on the inside. Harry looked down at his hand, and he dropped the wand. His hands trembled, and he backed away. "S-sorry," he said, before running out of the room.
Draco looked at Madame Pomfrey, before looking at the glass covering the floor. He pulled out his wand, cleaning it up, before running after Harry.
"Oh, this was my Christmas present from Dobby last year. Brilliant, aren't they?" Draco laughed, and Harry got out of bed. The four of them left to the Christmas tree as Pretzel left to help with breakfast.
"Come on mate, let's go find a place to sit," Ron said in a soft voice, almost like it was fragile. Harry nodded, a solemn expression on his face. They found a compartment, and sat in silence for another ten minutes, Harry wrapped in Hermione's arms, her head resting on his shoulder, Ron on the other side of Hermione. The three stayed like that, not even noticing the compartment door opening. That is, until an all to familiar voice spoke.
"Draco Malfoy you sit back down this instant. At least here the plan before you decide whether or not to help."
The newfound silence made Harry's thoughts stop, and he realized that the two friends had finally stopped arguing. There was an uncomfortable tension in the air, and suddenly Harry felt he'd rather be anywhere else.
"Who in particular do you want notified?" This time it was Hermione who spoke up, in a small, broken voice.
Hermione's next guess, was that they were friends, but that didn't make sense either. As she had pointed out before, they hardly spoke.
Hermione, who had other matters on her mind, didn't hear what Ginny had said. She was thinking, and thinking hard. Suddenly, it came to her. "I have to go," she said, before sprinting out of the library.
"Of course it is. Have you even smelled the pages of a book before. It's calming, and it's just so...you wouldn't understand. I don't think I've ever seen you with a book when it wasn't necessary." Harry rolled his eyes, and started cleaning up the potion, leaving a small vile full of it to be graded.
Thoughts and emotions flooded Harry's mind until it became to much to bear, and he did the most sensible thing he could think of at the time. He ran away. All the way back to the castle, through the doors, and up to the eighth year dorms. He ran into his room, slamming the door as he collapsed on the ground, worn out from the running and, well, everything.
"It's Ron," he choked out. Reluctantly, tears started to escape, falling on his hands as he stared at his blurry lap.
Hermione trudged back to the castle along with the others, willing herself not to cry. She'd never truly lost someone this close to her before, and it was horrible. Honestly, she didn't know how Harry did it all of the time.
"I kissed you back though, then I kissed you again." Harry had undoubtedly felt guilty about it. He didn't deserve happiness, no matter what people kept telling him. He was too horrible for happiness, the kiss had only confirmed his selfishness. Because what decent person is happy just about an hour after their brother died? It still felt a bit weird calling him that, though Harry supposed he wouldn't need to anymore.
Draco stares at him, or, at least, Harry thinks he does. The rain is now blurring his glasses and making him effectively blind. He fumbles for his wand, shivering as the cold droplets pour down his back, and casts an
By the time they are halfway up the drive, he can see McGonagall on the front steps, and when they reach her, Harry doesn’t know whether to turn and run or give her a hug. In the end, he holds fast to Draco’s hand and says:
As Corrie, Danica and Ida do the same, several fine, gold numbers float towards Eilish and tangle in an elegant spell that Harry has never seen before.
“Are you sure these sleeves aren’t too short?” George asks, pulling at the fabric around his wrists and provoking a fierce look from Madam Malkin.
At the back of the room, Draco has become the most elegant teapot Luna has ever seen, but it is his glimmer that makes Luna stop in her tracks, almost colliding with a slowly-rotating Otis.
“I’m going to look at the stalls,” he says a little too loudly, leaving Draco and Mrs Purley behind and joining the others now milling around the newly snow-dotted section of the alley.
“They just came over a little bit happy,” Luna explains, smiling to herself as Harry and Draco finally stop looking at each other and turn their ridiculous grins on the rest of the team.
By the time August rolls around, many of the volunteers have dispersed. The castle is all but back to its usual self and most of the helpers are taking much-needed holidays with their families before resuming their normal schedules. The majority of the teachers are still in residence, along with a handful of students who have nowhere else to go. Harry remains because... not because he can’t go back to the Burrow, but because Hogwarts is his home. And because, on the third day of August, he looks down from the top of Ravenclaw Tower to see an unmistakeable white blond individual stalking up the drive, dragging his trunk behind him.
He buys himself hot coffee from a cart and wanders the cobbles, looking into all the shop windows and attempting to focus on his mission. His presents for family and old friends have been bought weeks ago in an uncharacteristic stroke of organisation, but now Christmas is almost upon them and he can’t, in good conscience, forget about the ladies of biddy club.
Harry opens the door, ruffles the snow from his hair and navigates his way through the crowded dining room. When a waiter starts to move towards him, he smiles and points into the corner, where Narcissa and Draco are sitting. Where Narcissa, Draco, and Needle are sitting, he realises, amused to see that the swan has climbed onto a third chair and is now chomping on a linen napkin. Harry approaches this bizarre party to a smile from Draco and a look of deep suspicion from Narcissa. Today’s cup is fluted and sea green, decorated with tiny fishes that shoal constantly around the handle. Narcissa grips it with pale, elegant fingers and continues to stare at Harry.
Puzzled, Draco joins her at the window and drops into the seat she has just vacated. Carefully, he takes the telescope and squints into it. When the image comes into focus, he lets out a bark of surprised laughter.
“It’s a nice day,” he says, because he has to say something, and Draco’s smile flickers at the corners.
“Love? Relationships?” Harry tries, feeling his skin heating yet again. “I just had a really good talk with Esmee and everything she said made sense, but I just can’t.”
“That was not a weather-related malfunction, everyone,” he murmurs, bending and attempting to poke her away from the telescope. “Pansy is actually lost for words, which is probably fortunate, as I doubt the ones she was looking for were suitable for broadcast.”
“Really?” Harry murmurs, scrambling over to his side and dropping to his knees to light the dark recess with his wand. “Do you think they’re all here?”
“I can see that,” Draco says, wondering why in the name of all that is logical he is having this conversation. He could just leave. He could just close his mouth and walk right out of this shop. Potter would think he’s an idiot, but Potter already thinks he’s an idiot and he has no idea why it matters anyway. “The thing is,” he says, because apparently he is still talking, “when someone is a shut-in, they’re usually just in one place. Shut in.”
Draco glances at him, eyes bright with amusement. “Good decision. When I asked I thought they were going to stab me with their knitting needles. It was a long time ago, though. I think they’ve forgiven me.”
“They sent me grapes,” Ida says, holding up a large bunch and a scrap of parchment. “Grapes, and a note saying it might be best for me to sell the house now.” She screws up her face. “They know I don’t like grapes.”
“Wonderful, isn’t it?” she says, glancing at the front page and then abandoning it altogether. “He’s always on Witch Weekly’s worst-dressed, but I can’t remember the Prophet having a pop at his fashion sense before.”
Miss Lister hurries to pick it up. She shakes her head. “It’s perfect, and I actually think the pearls are shinier than they were before. Thank you so much.”
They sit, when directed, without a word, and wait as the editor views Mr Fortuna’s memory. When he has finished, he sits carefully on the edge of his vast desk and gazes evenly at each of them in turn.
Harry shakes himself, grasping for the first aid training he hasn’t had to use since a campaign in India several years ago. He casts a basic diagnostic spell over her, staring at the flickering light and holding his breath until Draco drops down next to him and lays a hand on his shoulder.
“I talked to him. We talked about colours and how to make a rainbow,” Rose says solemnly. She turns to regard Draco with interest. “Are you Uncle Harry’s husband?”
Rose pulls herself up to her full height and adjusts her glittery reindeer antlers. They look rather better on her than they had on her dad, Harry decides, but keeps the thought to himself.
Granted, Harry is the one who is seeking him out now, hailing the Knight Bus and sitting in the conductor’s seat and… oh, god, he really needs to stop it. He’s not entirely sure what it is about Malfoy that makes him feel so churned up inside but whatever it is, he’s only making it worse.
“Of course, what this whole thing needs is music… and dancing!” her father cries, flinging cold tea down Ginny’s front in his enthusiasm. “Sorry, dear.”
“I’ll do it,” Harry offers, pulling his breathing under control and grabbing his wand. “Hold him up, Rose.”
“I will,” Rose says, taking off her coat-cape and standing on tiptoes to hang it on the lowest arm of the tall, ebony rack.
“Would it surprise you to know that this is not the first time I have heard about you and the Bembledacks?” Draco says.
,” he mutters, feeling his face heat. He lifts a hand to scrub at his skin and then drops it again, barely noticing the pain as his wrist bangs against the edge of the table.
“Did you even taste your food?” she asks, letting them surround her and pull gently at her dress and bag.
Suddenly feeling weary, Harry gets slowly to his feet and regards his decorated living room with a sigh. He puts out the fire, finishes his cocoa, and climbs the stairs.
Needle stretches out his long neck and rises to his full height, giving off an air of challenge. Harry sighs. He looks at the clock. It’s just after eleven. Sage must be open by now, and perhaps the swan has just followed one of the diners out of the restaurant and wandered off in search of adventure. Why he has chosen Borteg’s for that purpose remains a mystery, but Draco must be missing him.
Harry sighs at the thought of it, body aching with missing him. It’s been two days, that’s all, and it will only be two more, but he fucking hates it and he doesn’t think he’s slept more than a couple of hours since Draco left. He’s exhausted and on edge and he really doesn’t see why Gringotts should be allowed to yank his person to the other side of the world for ninety-six hours and leave him here in a house that suddenly seems far too big. It had been fine before; he’d rattled around quite happily for years, but now the silence feels oppressive and when he stretches out a hand across the mattress he finds nothing but the pyjamas he abandoned hours ago in a screwed up ball.
He closes his eyes and allows his mind to drift, settling on the image of snowflakes whirling around the table where he sat hours ago, surrounded by kind, open-hearted people who have folded Mr Borteg and the Malfoys into their midst without a second thought, and he silently wishes each of them a peaceful night. He smiles against Draco’s coat fabric and casts his thoughts out to Diagon Alley, thinking of Florean, who has always believed in him, Shan and Esmee, the best friends and neighbours anyone could hope for, of Jean and her owls and no-nonsense Mrs Purley and everyone else who helps to knit their little community together. They are safe now, and that knowledge seems to take Harry by the scruff of the neck and fill him with warm pride. He inhales Draco’s familiar clean scent and sighs, hoping that everyone he loves gets everything they didn’t know they wanted this Christmas.
, that’s the thing,” he says, feeling more stupid and more certain with every word. “You’re the thing that makes it all different, because I can’t think about anything else, and when I’m not with you, nothing feels right. I want to be your friend and your Watson and your… I just… I love you,” he finishes, hot and unsteady and ready to burst.
“You’ll never believe this,” Eilish says, thrusting a biscuit into Harry’s hand, “but Draco used to operate this bus all by himself. Night and day. We made him hire another driver. We said we wouldn’t come any more if he didn’t. That’s when he took on Mr Spain.”
“I can lend you some shoes,” Draco offers, sounding about as bewildered as Harry feels. “One moment.”
“None taken,” Luna says brightly, just as Sam emerges from behind his desk, allowing her to see his ensemble for the first time.
“A fisherman would no come out without his coat,” she says, staring down at Draco as though daring him to argue.
When he returns the next day with soup and toasted sandwiches, Harry is still busy with his stock take. He accepts the bag and steaming cup from Draco with a mixture of exasperation and gratitude, and other than a soft ‘thank you’, says nothing as he sips his soup and strides purposefully around the shop with a clipboard.
“Of course I want to,” Caroline says, pulling up her knees and curling into a protective ball. “But I won’t get in. I haven’t ever done any magic, not even by accident.”
By the time darkness falls on the next night, Harry is prepared. He writes the questions he wants to ask, the things he wants to say, on the back of his hand in ink. Draco stares at his pebbles as he answers, but when he turns to leave, he smiles, lit from behind by the sunrise, and grabs Harry’s wrist.
“Remind me why I continue to come here?” he sighs, dropping Sam’s safety form into the nearest chair and folding himself down on top of it.
“Ah.” Harry hesitates, trying to think of a way to tell his friend that he hasn’t tried it yet without mortally offending her.
“We can see Kingsley later, I promise,” Harry says. “We’ll go to Grandma and Grandad’s and we’ll eat loads of food and we’ll see Kingsley. If you like, we can probably see him trying to eat whatever Grandma has made for lunch. I think it’s roast beef this week. Would you like to see Kingsley eat a whole joint of roast beef?”
“Long enough. Fred and George are on their way,” he says stepping into the kitchen and shutting the door behind him.
“Sounds like a very weird promise,” Harry says, grabbing Draco by the wrist and yanking them both into the red armchair.
“I’ll have a look,” he says, flicking his wand and then pulling the brass lever that sends the till’s cash drawer springing open with a crash. “I can do change for a Galleon and…” He digs in his trouser pockets and dumps a pile of copper and silver out onto the counter. “Maybe two more.”
If he remembers correctly, tickets for the Knight Bus can still be bought at the Leaky Cauldron, and even in sodden shoes that squelch with every step, he can get there in less than ten minutes. As it turns out, he makes it less than halfway before the bus once more pulls up beside him, showering him with cold water for a second time.
It’s fine for Ginny to know about this part of the plan, she reminds herself. It’s not a secret that the children would love a piano, and it needn’t be a secret that she’s planning a pyjama day for the staff to raise for the funds for it. As long as no one knows about the Harry-Draco-embarrassment part of the plan, then everything will be fine and the Happiness Project will be safe.
The biddies applaud as though he has just successfully conducted a symphony and he nods graciously, deciding to pretend that he deserves their praise. He turns in the leather chair and flings his arms out with such drama that his left hand smacks against the dashboard.
“Why is it, then, that when I went to give Mrs Skower her potions yesterday evening, she told me all about how wonderful it was that her friends came to see her, and that one of them,” she hisses with a shudder, “was a sausage dog?”
Gertie gives him a brief, rare smile and then turns back to business. “Mrs Callaghan from Rose Cottage wants her gutters cleaning out. Are youse interested?”
Her burst of laughter sets off the other two, and despite his confusion, Harry is soon caught up in it with them.
He disappears from the fireplace and Harry heads for the shower, scrubbing away the day with a rough sponge and a bar of minty soap. He breathes in the steam and lets the water pound away at his skin, recalling a fragment of a dream involving Draco in the rain that settles in the pit of his stomach and won’t leave until he strokes himself hard and gasps his release against the warm, wet tiles.
“Isn’t it brilliant, Uncle Harry?” Rose sighs, grabbing his hand when he doesn’t respond. “Are you alright? You look sad.”
“Did Harry really say that?” Serafina asks, twirling around and accidentally banging into an old woman carrying a large lizard. “Ooh… sorry.”
She shakes the worst of the rain from her hair and then casts a neat little charm that has her looking dry and pristine within seconds. She also looks sickeningly healthy, Harry notes with some envy. She had put away just as much as everyone else. It’s just not fair.
The media are, of course, having an absolute field day, but Draco doesn’t break even when Witch Weekly runs a picture of Potter with his purple hair on the cover with the tagline: ‘When is too young for a midlife crisis?’
“The lonely swan wished for a family. He ’specially wanted two daddies and a big sister. The next day he went out looking for his wish, because when you wish for something, you have to work hard for it as well. The world was big and he didn’t feel brave but he pretended and he got into some fights,” Rose says, little face serious as she shows them a picture of a fountain and a box and what can only be Harry, with his glasses and his messy hair and his red jumper.
“Did you sneak in when that man was leaving?” Harry asks, almost expecting a reply. “You shouldn’t be over here on your own. You’re a naughty swan.”
“It was ages. It was long enough for me to go to the pub and buy these and come back,” Draco argues, sipping his drink. “And when I did, you were still talking to yourself.”
Harry gazes at her, bewildered. “Don’t you feel bad about Marius? I feel bad and none of this madness was my doing.”
Tearing his eyes away from Draco, he stows the file under the counter and then straightens up, catching his breath when he realises that the grey eyes are still burning into him.
“Did you steal this?” she asks, trying to sound stern and failing. The crow looks so pleased with himself that she can’t help laughing. “Well, I don’t suppose you’re going to take it back, are you?” she sighs. She puts the key in her bag and fishes out a cherry for him, knowing that she ought not to encourage such behaviour. Still, there’s no one here and Mr Abernathy won’t tell.
“What a wonderful thing to do,” says a tired-looking lady, rising from her seat beside her daughter’s bed. “Linnie has to stay asleep until the antidote is ready,” she explains. “She was bitten by a Polynesian Nailserpent in October. She’ll be so sad that’s she missed Christmas.”
“Does your mum live with you, then?” Harry asks, happy to get away from the topic of his glittery face. “Above the restaurant?”
“This is much more important than lunch, Harry. Diagon Alley is a place where people should feel safe, and what you and Draco are doing is going to help a lot of people,” she tells him, and then her expression softens. “Maybe he’s the right one for you after all.”
“Good afternoon, Harry,” she says, beaming at him as if he has addressed her, and then turning to Draco.
“I don’t know,” Dean says noncommittally. “I can see that he has a lot more to gain from all this than you do.”
Harry gazes at the presents. The paper wrappings have been torn in places, exposing brightly-coloured toys and soft things made of glittering wool. Most of the ribbons are frayed and many have slipped off completely, lying strewn and tangled at the bottom of the pile. Gathering his focus, he points his wand at the nearest package and casts, creating a soft yellow light that repairs the wrapping paper and sends a new scarlet ribbon snaking around it and tying itself in a bow.
“Drama, drama,” Draco mutters. “Anyway, I’m not against saying something but I thought we agreed...”
“She does that to me all the time,” Draco says, nudging Juno to the floor with a practised movement and catching Harry in an unexpectedly intense kiss. “I’ll go and let her out. She probably wants to play in the snow before it all disappears.”
Draco shakes off most of the boxes and sits up. His knee is throbbing and his pride is severely damaged, but other than that, he thinks it could have been worse. “Yes,” he mutters.
“Stop it,” Draco instructs, nudging the swan away and offering him some greens from his pocket. “My point is, why does everyone think I made him that way?”
“Well, we never open the restaurant on Christmas Day, but we’re always busy the week before, so there are lots of wonderful leftovers in the kitchen,” Draco says. “We each make up a plate and then we go up to my flat and watch a murder mystery on television. Mother likes Agatha Christie.”
Clean and warm and aching hard, Harry gives himself up to sensation, drifting in comfort and pleasure with no need for a rush to the finish line. He sprawls, feeling every brush of Draco’s damp skin against his as a thrill in his veins, every gentle creak of the bed and every press of rough, air-dried towel underneath him. He trails kisses over every inch of pale skin he can reach, closing his eyes when Draco leans over him and slides his cock into his mouth. He groans and lifts his hips and Draco just slows down, making heated, amused eye contact until Harry grabs his hips and pulls him closer, close enough to let Draco’s cock slide, heavy and leaking, against his tongue.
“Right,” Harry says, resting his chin on his arms and gazing out into the darkness. He wants to say ‘well done’ or ‘are you mad?’ or ‘fucking hell, Draco, I’m actually really impressed’ but his throat feels tight and dry and unable to let anything more than single syllables pass.
Fortunately, Draco has plenty of other things to discuss with Pansy, both during the hours of the show and on the occasions that she drags him out for drinks at one of a series of dark, noisy bars that all look and smell and sound exactly the same. He dislikes each of them equally, too, but he acquiesces to her needling at least once a week because it’s easier, and because Pansy is a very entertaining drunk, equal parts affectionate and acerbic, and wonderfully vulgar with it.
“All sorts come in these,” she says, when he hands her the sample. “They come from different companies but they’re all basically the same. Here, look.”
“Is this Mrs Purley’s robbery or Reuben’s?” Harry asks, looking up from the large piece of parchment they have spread along the counter, weighted at one end by a bottle of rum and at the other by his Orisha cube.
a jolly good fellow and fully deserves to be told so in song. He is getting married, and anyone choosing to do such a bizarre and wonderful thing should definitely have a party with antlers and fireworks and anything else they bloody well want. Of course, it has been Fred’s duty, as the best man, to organise the event, but Harry has helped with a few of the finer details and there will be no surprises for him tonight.
Draco arches an eyebrow. “Right. Well, if you decide to tell me what actually happened at any point, I’ll be driving the bus. No more charms on my curtains, do you understand?”
“Brought this whole thing out in the open, didn’t it? Secrets are dangerous, Harry,” he says, biting into a roast potato, and he looks so maddeningly sincere that Harry doesn’t know whether to laugh or spell the gravy pot over his head.
“So, it’s years later, but it doesn’t matter because it never stopped. It doesn’t matter what he does, they spin it and squash it to make it look scandalous. Because it doesn’t really matter if he looks like a hero or a villain or a lunatic, as long as there’s something to write about. They’re not all like that—if they were, it would be easier—but enough of them are to follow him around everywhere and make every little thing into a story.”
“Maybe he likes animals more than people,” Harry says, but he doesn’t want to believe it. Then again, he doesn’t want to believe that anyone he knows would do such a thing.
“He did have a sense of humour, you know,” Draco says, glancing at him. “He would have found it hilarious that I ended up driving a bus. He always said I wasn’t mechanically minded, but to be honest, I think that’s just made me more determined.”
“Lost your tongues, have ye?” Gertie says, and then she is stumping her way over to them and setting down the basket on a wooden table that Harry has just unearthed from the clutches of the thorny bush. “Never mind. I’ve brought youse a wee bit of lunch. Bring the basket back when ye come for youse dinner, won’t ye? Youse’re doing a grand job out here!”
“Maybe. Or maybe she’s always been cross. In my experience, people only seem to get crosser as they get older.”
“Alright, then,” he says very quietly, cheekbones flushed and shoulders tight. “Luna, I will see you at two o’clock.”
Hermione laughs. “You’d never know he’d been ill. His appetite has sort of exploded, but fortunately, Molly is in full-on baking mode and keeps sending us extra stuff. I left some bread and some cheese scones on your kitchen table.”
“Here’s a question,” he says, resting his omnivox against his chest. “What on earth is Harry Potter so furious about? Eye in the Sky has just spotted him raging up Diagon Alley from the Magical Menagerie—do you know what’s put a doxy in his drawers? If so, why not call Lofty Lee and let us know.”
Pansy drops the needle onto the record and stares at Draco and Harry in turn. She picks up her pastry and takes a bite, brushing icing sugar from her lips.
“You could be, if you’d turned up in time for lunch,” Mary Ann says mildly. “It’ll all have been gobbled up by now, though. Strawberry it was, as well.”
“And in our morning glory,” adds Fred, and his voice is so loud that it echoes around the bottom deck, as do the groans and cackles that follow.
When there is no answer, he lets out a painful cry and struggles free, already preparing to dive back into the water.
“Well, that’s an excellent thing to do,” Harry says, shrugging off his coat and taking the seat beside her at the table. “What’s your book about?”
With a sigh, Harry takes the letter from the owl and carries it back into the cabin, only mildly surprised when the bird swoops after him and settles on the back of an armchair.
“Alison, please can you take over for a moment?” he calls. “I need to speak to these gentlemen in the kitchen.”
Jean joins him at the window, and together they watch Kettleworth striding through the rain in his immaculate blue uniform.
“I didn’t mind,” he says at last. “Not really. It’s not as though I’ve had much time for a proper relationship and sometimes it was sort of nice to just be able to go out for a night with someone. I met some interesting people and everyone always seemed to get a kick out of my stories about the weird ones. You’re both mad but I don’t think I’d have changed any of it.”
Needle arranges his feathers importantly and follows them into the kitchen, where the chill and the scent of sugar hit Harry in a violent wave.
“Good morning to you, too,” he says, addressing the magpies, who are perching in the bare trees and continuing to yell their little heads off.
Draco grants him a serene smile and then turns to watch the bonfire. “Yes. And so is forcing someone to put up a tent before they get married, but I imagine that both things have their place in the world.”
Reuben and his team are present, as are a proud Felicity and her new fruit-selling boyfriend, and a whole group of pink-robed people from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. In fact, the only person Harry can’t spot is Mr Pike from the Magical Menagerie, and he is so distracted by that fact that Rose has to tug at his arm and whisper that he’s going to miss the kissing.
Seconds later, the dark room is licked by dancing flames, and when Harry turns on the wireless, soft carols fill the air. The streets beyond the window are empty and silent, but Harry can feel the spirit of the season in every string of lights he hangs, every Christmas card he displays and every bauble he adds to his spindly tree. His favourites are those collected on his travels and those made for him with such care by Rose, as well as a rather brilliant star given to him by Molly and Arthur several Christmases ago, carved from a single piece of wood and packed with enough warming and glowing magic to light the tree all on its own.
"Good morning everyone!" Harry exclaimed, a huge, bright smile plastered on his face. Everyone stopped eating and looked up at him for a few seconds, but they eventually went about their day, and continued to eat breakfast. Harry himself took a seat between Ron and Ginny. She held his hand under the table, rubbing circles with her thumb. For some reason, the touch made him feel...tense? He didn't know how to describe it.
Hermione looked over at Harry as the doctor explained everything. She couldn't think of how she hadn't realized any of this before. He had seemed so genuinely happy. Hermione felt terrible that she hadn't been there enough.
Ron stopped pacing and just collapsed on the floor, falling on his knees, tears streaming down his face. He'd screwed up, with everyone and everything. He always seemed to mess everything up. Ron had lost Harry, and now he'd lost Hermione too.
"Are you bloody stupid? She, as well as Ginny, is like a sister to me. And besides, I don't...I might...look, just forget it, ok? I know you're afraid Hermione and I will end up together, I remember that night in the Forest of Dean. But, really, there's nothing going on between us, and there never will be. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go meet Dr-er, Hagrid. Yes, I have to go meet Hagrid, and I'm late thanks to you." And with that, Harry left, but not to meet Hagrid.
A new voice spoke this time. "I'm afraid that's where you're wrong. You see, Draco writes me frequently, quite often about you. Naturally, he wrote about your kiss, and I was the one who told my sister, only moments ago when I heard you were here. It seems I forgot to mention the two of you hadn't made anything official." Draco wrote about him?
Hermione thought and thought, searching for some conclusion to the strange night. She came to multiple ends, none making much sense. First, she had thought they had been dueling, and something had happened triggering the attack. But she dismissed the thought. They had hardly spoken to each other all year, let alone break out in a fight.
"You're...one of them," he said shakily, staring at the mark that stood out against Draco's pale skin.
"You don't need to be labelled, 'Mione," Seamus said. "But if it really bothers you that much, we think you might be pansexual, or maybe even demisexual." Hermione nodded, grateful for the help.
"She's a nurse, Ronald. Honestly!" Hermione put her hands to her head for a second, before turning to Draco. "How did this happen?" Draco squirmed in his seat.
Hermione slowly made her way into the Great Hall, and she briefly wished Pansy was with her as she felt every eye on her. Of course everyone was watching her, her clothes were wrinkled, dirty, and torn. She had a slight limp that she'd been trying to hide before, and there were twigs sticking out of her hair.
"Hurry Harry Potter, you is supposed to be at the lake with the other champions," the house-elf squeaked, looking up at Harry.
The feeling came so sudden, and Harry found himself gasping for breath. He was suffocating, he thought. What in the name of Merlin did Dobby give him? But then he felt them, flapping in the wind.
He made his way to the second floor girl's bathroom, finding Draco in deep conversation with Myrtle. He looked at the corner of the bathroom where he had shed his blood, and then the spot where Draco had his. Really, it was anyone's guess why they met here, where Harry had almost killed the blond. It couldn't have brought back many good memories for the both of them. Regardless, this is where they had taken to meet most of the time.
"What, I can't visit my aunt?" Harry opened his mouth, before closing it again. He'd forgotten they were related, which is strange, because Andromeda really did look a lot like Narcissa. Though, Harry would definitely say she looked the most like Bellatrix. Once, Andromeda had woken Harry from one of his nightmares while he was staying over, and he'd mistaken her for Bellatrix at first, and may or may not have hexed her. Nothing fatal, of course, and he was quickly forgiven, though he still felt guilty about it, even now.
"This," Blaise said, holding up the black box, "is the muggle movie?" Ron nodded, taking the box from him.
"No. I'm not gay, 'Mione. At least, I don't think I am. You know what, I'm just going to stop talking now." So, Harry didn't like him yet, or maybe he didn't know he did. That meant the plan was officially starting. Time to make Harry as jealous as possible.
"I-I just got c-caught up in the moment, s-s-sorry." He mentally cursed himself for his voice being so shaky.
"Note? What note?" Hermione slowly reached into her pocket, and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. Sh handed it to Harry, and he quickly read through it.
There was a tug on Harry's pants, and he looked down to see a small boy sucking his thumb and looking up at him with big eyes. Harry laughed and scooped the child up in his arms, causing a small giggle to erupt from the teal haired boy.
"You has to eat this, sir," Dobby replied, opening his palms to reveal what looked like a slimy rat tail. "It is gillyweed!"
"Hold on...it's Christmas! Merlin, how could I forget," he said, throwing the covers off him. Draco scrunched up his nose.
"Oh, um, his grey eyes. Yes, and the hair, very...blond. Not to mention that smirk." Hermione gave a nervous laugh. She was a fairly good actor, but coming up with stuff on the spot made things a million times harder.
Harry opened his presents, the usual from Ron and Hermione along with a very concerning letter about Mr. Weasley, a used tissue from the Dursley's, and a mirror from Sirius. Dobby had sent him a very...interesting painting that Harry guessed he'd done himself. Draco had given him a book on Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry hummed, patiently waiting for-"What in the name of Merlin is this?" There it is.
"No Hermione, he won't. He's just angry right now. Give him time to cool off." She nodded, although she didn't stop crying. She didn't even stopped when she went back to her room.
"No, I'm sure he's fine. Sometimes, especially during sixth year, he would leave and just spend all night wandering the castle. He's most likely up in the astronomy tower right now." Ron only nodded, and the two started the movie.
Hermione glanced nervously at Pansy. She didn't want Pansy getting mad because they had to share a dorm or anything like that. But Pansy didn't seem to mind. Hermione let out a breath of relief, and went to sit on her bed. The material was a crimson red, and it was remarkably soft. Pansy's bed was the same, but the color was a dark, emerald green instead.
Pansy sighed. Just then, Hermione came back in tears. Pansy and Blaise were both shocked at this. What had happened?
“Good,” she says finally, and then she purses her lips. “Youse are welcome to come back any time, ye ken? That garden has never looked so organised. Youse’ve been useful.”
By his third attempt, the crowd is warmed up enough to join in with the spectacle, shouting words of encouragement along with the odd heckle.
Harry hesitates, knowing that Rose will be disappointed by the answer. As a lover of all animals, she has taken somewhat of a shine to the belligerent bird, and it’s possible that she will see his actions as more of an eviction than a rescue mission. Before he can open his mouth, though, someone taps him on the shoulder and the wind rushes down the alley, surrounding him with the sweet scents of chocolate and peanut butter and a tangle of fruit flavoured syrups. Florean Fortescue, the unofficial leader of their little shopkeepers’ community, seems to take his famous ice cream parlour with him wherever he goes, the scents of his trade worn into his person by decades of dedication.
Bill exchanges a significant glance with his father and then bows so low that the hat falls off his head.
“Nothing,” he says, returning the book with a sigh. “Except that they may have just one-upped me in rather spectacular style.”
“Hello, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says, startled to realise that her small corner table has been enlarged and transformed, with all craft materials swept away and places set for seven.
As if on cue, Mr Borteg emerges from the back room and flails into the shop on his spindly legs. He looks at the swan, at Harry and Draco and their piece of parchment and shakes his head.
“I think the problem is that you’re pointing at a chicken and telling him it’s a fish,” he suggests.
Harry leans forward and she opens the velvet box. Inside, resting on the prettiest tissue paper Harry has ever seen, is an oval shaped cameo brooch. Against a midnight blue background, a bouquet of exquisitely carved, cream-coloured flowers sits in relief and the whole thing has been edged with delicate silver. Harry is no expert on jewellery, but he has always been able to appreciate something beautiful, and he already knows that Shan will love it.
He sighs. It’s not that Draco didn’t lie, or that he isn’t a horrible pain in the arse, but Harry loves him, and what’s important now is finding a solution.
Harry casts a sidelong glance at Draco, who is looking between Rose’s drawing of him and Needle with obvious bewilderment.
, they have managed to remain clean and mostly presentable, but Harry has the strong feeling that a morning on the farm might be too much for even their very best efforts. Of course, all of this should have been done the previous night, but Draco had found a stash of board games in a cupboard and it really is amazing how many of them can be adapted to include a stripping element. After that, any attempts at planning had flown completely out of the window, and now Harry is standing naked in front of a wardrobe that still smells slightly of mothballs, guiltily willing the farmer to suffer a puncture or two on the country road that leads to the village.
Draco makes an impatient little noise. “Yes, well. Don’t you want to know what the three things are?”
For a moment, the coughing continues, and then the smoke clears and Ron’s head emerges from the flames.
“Because you were too busy trying to give us all an earworm this morning,” Deb says rather accusingly.
She looks down her the Kneazles on her nightie, a small smile tugging at her lips as she remembers her father’s words.
Harry just grins and follows him, locking the door behind them. He, too, is wearing a pair of the Transfigured tweed trousers, and his jumper is an alarming shade of mustard yellow that Draco had flat-out refused to wear.
“Well, we thought we’d share the news in person and we decided to take one side of the street each. She’s got the other side.”
“Horace is here!” someone bellows, and seconds later, Luna finds herself adrift in a tide of small children as every single one of them abandons their current activity and runs at him at once.
“It’s called enrichment,” Danica says, smiling proudly. “I’ve been reading up on mice and all the things they need.”
“Bugger that,” Sophie says loudly, and then, “Sorry… it’s just… you’re right, Es, that’s the important thing, but don’t you want to see some justice? I know I do.”
Draco laughs, and together they wander through the market, collecting sacks where they can and inspecting the goods for sale.
“I’m not going to tell you that you’re not an idiot because you won’t believe me. Just tell me what happened.”
“I think I need to bother you for a little bit longer,” Draco says, and his tone is so serious that Harry has to smother a snort of laughter against his shoulder.
“Harry, please tell me you’re joking,” Draco says, squinting at the fountain. “How did you get back in, you sneaky little fucker?”
Needle ignores him, leaving Harry to summon an empty glass jar and scoop the spider into it before it becomes a snack for a very naughty swan.
It’s working, she thinks. Ron hasn’t mentioned receiving the letters, but he does seem to be baking more often, and Luna thinks she saw a copy of a business lettings magazine poking out of his bag the last time she saw him. It’s not yet time for her to place a large purple tick next to his photograph, but things are progressing nicely, as are her efforts to have a recently-discovered species of exploding stink flower named after Fred Weasley. The campaign has had coverage in the last three issues of the
Harry thanks him and leaves, knowing he’s said all the wrong things. No doubt Draco is charming everyone on his side of the street without even trying. When he enters the café, Mrs Purley’s bright smile lifts his mood effortlessly.
“It’ll take me a long time to make another one,” Rose says seriously. “But that’s alright. I don’t have school for another two weeks.”
“BOOOO!” comes the response, along with the clanging of utensils, the rattling of buckets and the stamping of feet.
Molly and Arthur are waiting for him outside the restaurant, peering nervously into the window at the other diners. They are visibly relieved to see him and he doesn’t resist the urge to hug them both.
“Back already?” Molly laughs, hugging him tightly and clonking him on the head with her feather duster.
“I’m sure they are, and I’m also sure they don’t want someone like me at their table,” Draco says, and while his face is hard and unreadable, the words are sighed softly, and he shoots Harry a tiny smile before urging the bus into action again.
By the time he makes it down to the lake that night, it is late, almost one o’clock in the morning. One of his few remaining housemates had wanted to talk, and, much to his frustration, he still hasn’t really grasped the concept of saying
“Gertie mentioned youse might be looking for work and I need a wee bit of help on the farm tomorrow,” William says. “I’ve got the vet coming for testing at the same time as I need the goats in for milking... I can no be in two places at once, ye ken.”
As though from somewhere far away, Draco hears gasps and murmurs, perhaps for the shimmering colours, perhaps for them. Either way, he doesn’t care.
“They’re perfect, thank you,” Luna says. She sets down the crate and picks out a wooden spoon and a metal ladle, smacking them together in rhythm and producing a satisfying clanging sound.
“This is wonderful, isn’t it?” Marius says, and Harry smiles at him weakly. “I’d better just go and wash my hands, if you don’t mind?”
. When Draco finally stumbles and drags them both onto the ice with a crash, he just lies there, ignoring the pain in his knees and hauling Draco into a kiss with both hands fisted into his coat. Draco laughs against his lips and touches his face with ice cold fingertips.
Draco turns slowly, pinning Harry with eyes that seem to glow in the gloom. Harry opens his mouth and then shuts it again, eventually deciding to bite on his thumbnail in an effort to keep any further words in. When Draco crosses the stone floor in three strides and grabs his wrist, he forgets to breathe.
“Not with your words, no,” Esmee admits. “I know you, Harry, and I know him. Why don’t you just tell me what happened?”
Irritated, he sips his cocoa and looks out of the window, where the sun has almost completely risen. The light is pale and ghostly, illuminating the steam from his drink in spirals all the way to the ceiling.
“Word travels fast in big families,” Harry tells him as a giant of a man, possibly Angelina’s uncle, finally ambles away after a lengthy discussion. “And there aren’t any secrets. Believe me.”
“Wow,” he whispers, pressing his hands to his face and trying to calm his breathing. “That was…” He trails off, opting instead to roll over and reach for Draco and quickly finding himself nudged back into place.
Rose will love all of this, he thinks, making a mental note to let her loose on the new stalls as soon as she arrives on Monday afternoon. Hermione might not completely approve of him stuffing her daughter full of sugar on a semi-regular basis, but she knows as well as he does that it is his prerogative as an uncle to do so.
Harry gazes up at the lights and shrugs. “I don’t know. I keep focusing on the fact that it’s Shan and Esmee’s wedding tomorrow and… god, if they try to ruin it…”
“Reptiles,” Draco says absently, still peering through the Eye as Potter and his friend make their way along the rain-slicked cobbles. “Crocodiles are reptiles.”
Harry watches them with a little pang of sadness for all they have lost, and then they burst into such delighted laughter that Montague barks and demands to be let in on the joke. He doesn’t really know how to feel, so he breathes in the cold, clean air and continues to walk beside a man who is, he’s almost certain, just as confused as he is. Maybe it doesn’t matter that he doesn’t fully understand these tough old ladies, or that he has no real idea what he’s going to do about Draco. Maybe the important thing is that he wants to be with them, all of them, and that right now, in this place, he doesn’t feel alone.
Harry laughs. Throwing caution to the wind, he leans down and picks up Needle, holding him to his chest, reaching for Draco’s hand and Disapparating.
The house that sits at the top of a long, winding drive is unlike any Harry has seen before. An eccentric mix of old limestone and what appears to be hammered metal, it sprawls against the landscape like some sort of sleeping beast, full of rounded corners and circular windows and quirky little chimneys. The grounds are part-manicured and part wild, rows of neat winter blooms forming a tapestry with swaying meadows full of grasses. Harry is surprised only by the scale of the place; everything else seems to embody Ida’s character perfectly.
Taking a deep breath, he plunges under the water, scanning the murky depths even as his eyes sting and protest. He used to look at this place from his common room all the time. He knows where he is. He can do this, because Stanley needs him. At the sight of a tentacle, he turns, immediately becoming entangled in grasping weeds and losing all the air in his lungs in one terrifying gasp. He flails in the water, eyes still searching for Stanley as he tries to yank himself free. His chest burns and his vision begins to blur but he twists harder, contorting himself until he manages to wriggle free of his jeans and kick off his shoes. With a spike of triumph, he kicks for the surface and then everything turns black.
“There are worse things,” Harry says, just as Jean bustles into the room with a tray and sets it down besides Harry’s coffee cups. “Don’t drink anything Florean gives you, though. He’s great with ice cream but his tea is…”
“What’s this?” Potter asks, frowning and then wincing as the deep scratch on his face pulls tight along with his expression.
By the time term starts, Harry is heavy with anticipation, stomach lurching and heart pounding as they pass in the corridor, in uniform for the first time in months. Draco brushes past him with a covert half-smile and a drift of lemons and freshly-pressed robes, and Harry misses a step, stumbling and recovering himself against a rough stone wall and managing to graze his palm in the process. His friends are back—Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Ginny and Luna—and he is delighted to see them, but all he can really think about is nightfall.
“I just wanted to get here,” he mumbles, feeling of utter stupidity only heightened when the sound of ‘White Christmas’ echoes around the empty street. “Oh, good.”
When the applause has died down at last and the curtains have closed, Harry, Draco and the biddies follow the printed signs to a warm classroom, where everything seems to exist in miniature. The ladies have cups of tea and mince pies in their hands before Harry has time to take a breath, and quickly content themselves with their surroundings, admiring splotchy paintings and reminiscing about handwriting lessons and long division.
Harry woke up with a groan. Today they were leaving for Hogwarts. It had been a month since Harry's trip to the doctor, and nothing was any better. What's the point of being diagnosed if nothing changes?
"Ugh, Harry, you're not listening! I don't blame you for anything, it was all my fault." Harry stilled, looking at Draco with wide eyes. Draco furrowed his brows. "What?"
Hermione and Pansy walked into their shared dorm room. It was quite big, for only having two people in it. There were two beds on either side of the room, and couch in the middle, with a coffee table in front. There was another door, that Hermione assumed led to the bathroom. All in all, it was a pretty sweet dorm.
"Parkinson, wait up! Gryffindor and Slytherin have Potions together!" Pansy slowed her pace so the Gryffindor, that was surprisingly shorter than her, could catch up. Or maybe it wasn't surprising, she considered herself pretty tall, after all. No, this boy was definitely short.
Watching Malfoy now, he began to feel sorry for the guy. He watched as he silently, head still bowed, made his way onto the train.
"It's Malfoy." And, she was right. Of course she was, she was Pansy Parkinson. Pansy really had no idea what to do anymore, so she sat there with conflicting thoughts swirling around in her head.
Harry looked back, the roaring fire threatening to devour his ankles. He could just barely make out the blond struggling to climb up the top of one of the many piles of junk. As much as he wanted to hate him, he couldn't. He could never hate him.
Somewhere along the lines, Ginny came up. The only thing he could think was sister. Ginny was like a sister to him. He loved her, just not in that way. Didn't he? Everything was so confusing, he really had no idea what to do.
"Look at this," the blond said, setting it on the table as he hunched over and tried to catch his breath. Hermione picked it up, eyes widening as she read the title, a sound somewhere in between relief and shock escaping her. She continued reading, her eyes skimming the article.
"Come on, Lily, we're leaving." James gripped the redhead's wrist harshly, pulling her towards the entrance as Harry sobbed into his shoulder.
Emerging from his thoughts, Draco cleared his throat. "Can I sit in here?" Draco's voice was small, and he cringed just hearing it.
"Great, how about we head down to the library before class? I was about to read up on soulmates if you'd like to help me with that. Speaking of, do you know if there's a way to change or get rid of your soulmate?"
The day had been so crazy, he'd almost forgotten about his...truce? Can you even call it that? Sure they weren't going around hexing each other and throwing insults, but he was pretty sure that just meant they weren't going to bother with each other all year. Draco sighed, and went to his trunk. No specific reason, he just wanted something to do.
She had planned on telling Ron, but as she made her way to his room, she decided against it. Three knocks, and the door opened.
Harry, Hermione and Ron walked into the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning. Ron was still being sour about his room assignments, but Hermione didn't seem to mind. As they walked up to the Gryffindor table, Dean and Seamus were whispering about something, but stopped when the trio walked up and sat down next to them. Normally, Harry would have gotten suspicious and asked them about it or something along the lines, but he had hardly even noticed them. He was more focused on staying awake.
Harry James Potter, the boy who lived. The one that defeated Voldemort. A hero, some say. He begged to differ. Harry was nothing more than a broken, depressed murderer. A murderer. That's who he was. He was responsible for all those deaths. It was his fault that so many family are grieving. It was his fault that those people would never breathe again. Everything was his fault. No one else could see that, but he could. He knew.
Hermione watched as Harry ran out, still wrapped in Pansy's arms. It was torture, every minute that passed by. Ron was dead, Harry was probably going to do something stupid, and Blaise hadn't moved an inch. Not to mention the unconscious body on the ground that still needed to be dealt with. So, that being said, Hermione removed herself from Pansy's arms, and walked over to the blond. After a few spells, his eyes slowly opened. She carefully sat him up, conjuring a glass of water and handing it to him.
"Haha," Ron said dryly. "What am I supposed to do? My roommate is Zabini, Harry. Zabini." Harry rolled his eyes, and gave another chuckle.
It was obvious to both, that the best way to make this work, was to become friends. Or, acquaintances at least. Evidently, Hermione started up a conversation.
Professor Sprout started clapping, and so did Ron, Blaise, Draco, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and a few other teachers. Little by little, the students joined in, until nearly the entire hall was applauding and cheering. Some gave them glares, but that was to be expected. The four girls blushed, and Ginny hopped down, and walked over to the Ravenclaw table to sit with Luna. Pansy and Hermione got down too, and sat next to Draco and Blaise.
"What do you think I am?" She still hadn't figured it out, and it was bothering her more than she'd like to admit.
Both boys just stared at the other, Ron's face getting closer to the color of his hair by the second. It hadn't even been that big of a deal, they'd just watched a movie together, then fell asleep together, and...ok, so maybe it was a big deal, to them anyways.
Blaise cleared his throat, causing the Gryffindor to snap back into focus. Malfoy and Parkinson were staring at him, one smirking and the other quite flustered. Harry couldn't tear his eyes away from the blond, who was
"Yes, I had this whole thing planned out, I even made you all Canary Creams. They were essential, trust me. But alas, I have no need for them any longer. Here Teddy, would you like one?"
Ginny was with Hermione in the Library. She had planned on telling Hermione about the breakup and coming out to her, but now she was having second thoughts. After a few minutes, she just kind of blurted it out. "Harry and I broke up." She said, a little to fast.
It had been a week with the Weasley's, and a little over two months since the Battle of Hogwarts. Each day got worse for Harry. But, if it was this hard for him, he couldn't even begin to imagine what the Weasley's must be going through. So, naturally, he decided he was done with his stupid emotions. What good did they ever do anyone anyway? He was going to trap his own thoughts so deep inside himself, they wouldn't ever be able to get out. Wall after wall, built to protect him from himself.
When the entire class had finished their potions, they were allowed to take off the lids to smell it. Harry eagerly took the lid off, wanting to see if everything was the same as before. He took a whiff of the love potion, smelling the familiar broomstick handle, treacle tart, and...there was something new. Something he couldn't put his finger on at the moment.
"Because I couldn't take it anymore. I'm destructive, destroying everything I touch. I've ruined lives, and taken all the credit in the end. It wasn't just me, who saved everyone. It was all of us, and yet I get praised. Anyone else would love the attention, the fame, the  gifts. But I just want to be happy. I just want to be forgotten. Is that to much to ask, Draco?"
"Now, go on, dear. We'll be back before you know it, alright? I love you," Lily said, pulling her child close and giving him a kiss on the forehead.
"No. Is that what all this is about? A hoodie?" Harry turned around to look at her, clearly frustrated.
Ron and Hermione shared a look, and ran after the blond. They ran for a few more minutes, before they burst into the hospital wing, seeing Draco, Harry in his arms, looking around the room frantically.
"So, friends then?" Pansy nodded, still too shocked to speak. Harry didn't know what was so shocking, didn't everyone know these things about him? Sure it was weird to have a fruit be your favorite food, but anyone could see that he had one with every meal. And Harry knew he didn't know who his soulmate was because Harry was his soulmate.
"I just wore myself out, alright? It means nothing, I'm fine. I'm better already, see." At this Harry tried getting up from the couch, but as soon as he did he began feeling lightheaded again. He saw black for a few seconds, before his sight was returned, revealing a worried Draco right in front of him. Harry hadn't realized until then he'd been steadying himself against the blond.
For three days now Harry and Hermione had been reunited as friends. Ron couldn't help but feel extremely jealous, not that he realized that jealousy was all it was. In his eyes, the two were always together. Ron and Hermione may be fighting, but he was still her boyfriend, miraculously. And Ron wasn't blind, he saw the way Harry looked at Hermione.
"Don't worry, 'Mione. I don't think he's far enough gone to be absolutely heartbroken." He really, really hoped so. "A little hurt, yes. But not heartbroken."
"Harry, as much as it pains me to say this, I think it's best you and Draco don't continue seeing each other," James said in a monotone voice, glaring at Draco, who was hiding in his mother's embrace.
Draco looked at him now, his mouth open, but no words came out. There was a faint pink on his cheeks, though Harry didn't even notice. Finally, he said, "Wh-what?"
"Hope there are no hard feelings, Weasley. I know my father's a bit of an ass, but we aren't much alike anyway. He's much more tolerable at home, I can assure you. I mean, I'm not disowned or anything."
'Lucius, he's not even staying here. Look at our son, he's happy. Don't ruin everything by bringing up all this Dark Lord nonsense, especially around Draco." The man gave a stiff nod, before the two began the walk to the doors.
Harry was fifteen minutes late by the time he made it to the same spot as the day before. Ginny was there, sitting against the trunk as they had been the day before. "Thought you weren't gonna show," she said, smirking.
"So Hermione and Draco both knew, and didn't say anything to me!" The two continued walking to wherever Draco was, conversation easy between the two. Pansy took him all the way up to the Astronomy tower, where Draco stood. Harry tried to fight down the memories this place was bringing up, not wanting to remember them at all.
Blaise glared at his so-called friend, as he said, "The weasel." Draco and Theo laughed, and Blaise went back to his breakfast.
"Guys, I think I just found my soulmate," Harry whispered so the others couldn't hear. Hermione smiled at him while Ron looked curiously at him, waiting for Harry to say who it was.
"Before you all get excited, I will be choosing the groupings." The smiles dropped from the Golden Trio's faces. "Now, Miss Granger, why don't you work with Bulstrode and Zabini." Sighing, Hermione walked over to Millicent and dropped her books down on the table, Blaise joining the two.
"Just have him come here, if he wants. You know what, I'll invite Ginny and Luna as well. Remember the last time we forgot to invite the two." Both boys shuddered.
Harry nodded, because he couldn't really talk, seeing as his mouth was full of toothpaste and spit. He shoved to blond out of the bathroom, and finished brushing his teeth, before walking back out. "What are you doing here anyway?"
"Your a bloody freak, did you know? Why don't you just do us all a favor and throw yourself off the Astronomy tower?" Harry tensed at the word freak, a word he's heard all too much.
"Well Ron, even if your right, we shouldn't go about pestering him with it. Whoever this mystery girl is, is good for him."
As they were sitting down to watch the movie, Ron noticed a certain blond was nowhere to be seen. "Shouldn't Malfoy be back by now, it's kinda late?"
Draco didn't move. The two stared at him, before Ron said, "Come on mate, he'd probably want to see you least of all." Draco snorted again.
"Never mind that. Now, what were you saying? Something about a sexual identity crisis?" Ron could practically hear the smirk in Harry's voice. "Who was it?"
"Ron, stop overreacting. Now go back to your dorm." Harry shoved a complaining Ron out of the room, and closed the door before he and Neville started laughing again. They stopped when they heard a muffled voice on the other side of the door.
Hermione smiled, which Harry could tell was forced, now that he knew what he knew. "So tell me, what are your favourite things about Mr. Ferret?"
Harry's hands shook, so he hid them underneath the table. James turned his gaze sharply to him, and Harry gulped.
"Sorry," the blond said. "Didn't see you. Merlin Potter, are you ok?" He reached out his hand for the other to take. Harry was just about to do so, when a door opened. He mouthed a quick 'sorry' before yelling, "Watch where your going, Potter."
"There you go again." Harry rolled his eyes, and looked around. It was then that he noticed th other four students in the room. Ron looked confused, Dean and Seamus were smirking, and Hermione looked worried.
Hermione took a deep breath. This was it, no going back now. Once she said it out loud, it would be real.
They crept up to the crib, as silent as they could, and Harry peered over the edge. Teddy was still, eyes closed, thumb in his mouth. Harry was about to look away when Teddy's eyes opened, revealing purple irises.
Harry smiled, remembering fourth year. "What a lovely name. Shall we?" he asked, gesturing toward the castle.
"Oh...alright then. Did you want me to talk to him for you or something?" Hermione just stared at him, before remembering what she was supposed to be doing.
"Why did we steal this, again?" Pansy questioned, tilting her head to the side, still examining the cloth laid out before them.
Draco searched all of Hogwarts for the raven-haired, glasses-wearing, scar-faced git. He finally found him lying in the grass by the lake, eyes closed. His nose and cheeks were a bit pink from the chilly weather, and Draco wondered if the boy was sleeping. He was about to turn around when the boy sat up. They both seemed to jump.
It just after lunch, and they had a free period before their next class. Draco sat down on the stairs, waiting for Harry. The two had decided to switch it up, and were going to the Room of Requirements tonight.
"I KNEW IT, I FUCKING KNEW IT!!! YOU'RE CRUSHING ON POTTER, AREN'T YOU? IS THIS WHY YOU WANTED TO STEAL HIS-" Draco slammed his hand over his mouth before she could continue any further, already mortified enough.
Hermione had asked Draco  to meet her in the library, since they were on the best terms out of the three. Surprise it was, when Draco entered and found the three of them, devilish smirks.
"Mr. Potter, sit back down right now." Harry grunted, grabbed his wand, and started walking towards the door. "Mr. Potter, stop right there. I will get Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley if necessary." Harry stopped in his tracks. He took a few deep breaths, before turning back around, wand pointed out.
"Anyway, don't deny it, because we know. And it's your lucky day, because we're going to get you guys together," Seamus said.
"Easy, Defense Against the Dark Arts. But not with Umbridge teaching, she's bloody awful." Draco gave a small chuckle, which made Harry grin. "What about you, what's yours?"
Life for the ferret had changed immensely after the war. He had had his trial, and had been pardoned, though his mother had been put on house arrest. He, of course, had stayed with her, keeping her company in the empty, gloomy manor. As much as Draco loved his mother, he had hated his time there. It seemed every inch of Malfoy Manor had been infested with had memories. Just the feeling you would get being there was horrible. The Dark Lord had destroyed his one home; the place he'd once been happy in.
Dinner with everyone was better than Harry had expected. For once, it seemed, no one had to fake any smiles or laughs. Though it wouldn't last, they had that moment to be happy.
Pansy ran to her friend to comfort her, while Blaise stood there awkwardly. He was never good at comforting people, especially when they were in tears. He had no idea what to do, and he wasn't even friends with the girl.
Lily Potter was dead, and Harry was alone in this world. He vaguely remembered being held and crying himself to sleep that night, a soft hum present against his ear.
"No it doesn't, and mind your own business," she said, playing along. Pansy sighed, wishing the two got along better. "Now, as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted," she glared at Draco, "is that alright?"
"I don't need your help Hermione! I'm 18 for Merlin's sake!" They rode the rest of the way in silence.
"I'm not sure," Seamus responded, eyes still closed. "We could lock them in a room together, maybe play truth or dare. Then there's always spin the bottle, but that's not a guarantee unless we charm the bottle or something. There's that love potion thing, that smells like the stuff your attracted to, but I don't even know if Slughorn's doing that this year."
Pansy turned to her friends. "You guys better be nice, and not just to Hermione. Weasley and Potter too." Draco and Hermione held in knowing laughs, and Blaise's cheeks heated a bit, though not enough to be noticeable.
But then there were two bodies coming towards him, and then they were embracing him. Harry tensed up, but slowly relaxed, letting Pansy and Draco hold him. It was a strange hug, Harry's arms at his sides while he was squished by the two. Pansy let go with one final squeeze, stepping back to watch her ship happen.
"It's not right. Ron died, and it was my fault, and he should be alive right now, and I should be the one who's lying on the ground in the Shrieking Shack," Harry mumbled into Draco's shoulder.
"Why thank you, Pretzel. What a good house-elf you are," he said, patting her head. She squealed, letting go of his leg and with a crack, she was gone. Draco turned to see Harry with an amused expression.
They followed McGonagall through the castle to their new dorm. They stopped when they got to a portrait of a wizard with long, chocolate brown hair. The man had an even longer beard, braided all the way down to his waist. The headmaster said the password, and the portrait door opened. The students filed into the room, looking around as they did.
With a final wave goodbye, Lily and James apparated away from the daycare, already missing their child.
"Drink now, or we're going to have problems." The boys looked over to her and assumed they could trust her enough not to ask any serious questions. They were very wrong. Taking the small cup from Pansy's hand, Harry downed the potion, Draco doing the same. Pansy smirked.
"Right, thanks. See you, Professor." And with A handful of floo powder, and a call of his destination, he was gone. A small smile was on McGonagall's lips as she watched him leave.
He dumped the water all over Harry, who sat up abruptly, shouting, "I'm up! Hey...why am I all wet?" He glared at Draco, who was too busy laughing with Pretzel to notice.
"I suppose. Well, come on then Po-Harry." Harry grabbed his stuff, and followed Draco off the train. The look on his parents faces when Harry appeared with Draco was pure gold. It made the both of them start cracking up, and Narcissa smiled sweetly at the two, while Lucius pinched himself to make sure he wasn't dreaming.
"Well, I did. Now run along, I have things to do. And tell Harry I'm sorry about earlier today, would you?"
"Bye Harry Potter! Dobby wishes you good luck!" Harry nodded, and left the library, rushing to the lake as fast as he could. When he got there, he was out of breath and sweating slightly. He rolled his eyes as Percy told him off, and went with the other champions to take their places. He saw Ron in the stands, waving and cheering for him, but no Hermione. Odd.
"Hang on. You were Harry's secret girlfriend, weren't you?" Harry burst out laughing, and Draco flushed.
“She might,” Draco says. He shivers and tucks his hands into the ends of his sleeves. “It’s technically true, anyway.”
“I don’t know, Draco,” Harry says, spotting the school in the distance. To his relief, there are still plenty of children hanging around and waiting for their parents. It’s possible that Rose won’t even notice how late they are.
Draco stops, too, almost banging into an elderly gentleman with an eye-patch. “Sorry,” he murmurs. “What’s the matter?”
Harry sighs, sitting back in his chair as Jean pours the tea. He accepts his cup and the three of them drink in silence. It’s a very good cup of tea, strong and fragrant and served at just the right temperature. It deserves Harry’s attention and he is happy to give it, already tired of crime and the constant rehashing of yesterday’s conversation with Draco. He has already played out dozens of ways he could have handled the situation better, and he is left with nothing but self-loathing.
“Of course.” Harry turns the object in his hands and laughs, recognition hitting him in an unexpected place. “This is Snape.”
Ron and Hermione will, of course, be working, as will most of his other friends. Of course, if he were to hail the Knight Bus, he could be sitting in an armchair and drinking tea with the biddy club in minutes… but he’s not going to do that. Perhaps Rose’s school will be closed for the day. He could Apparate over and visit her at the Burrow, because… Harry sighs.
“Speak for yourself,” Ron says, reaching for the biscuit tin and stuffing two ginger nuts into his mouth in one bite. “No spider talk.”
“Not far,” Draco promises, and Harry is gratified to see that he is moving around the deck unsteadily, usual grace having apparently deserted him.
The source of the familiar smell now becomes blatantly obvious as Harry finds himself staring at an enormous fire, crouching on the river bank and licking at least twenty feet into the air. Around it, people are talking quietly, drinking from mugs and throwing pieces of wood into the flames as though concerned the whole thing might fizzle out at any moment. As he steps closer, a wall of heat hits him and forces him to close his eyes, tip his head back in submission and wait for his body to adjust. He inhales deeply, drawing in the aroma of burning, crackling wood and a hint of warm, spicy food that makes his stomach growl.
By the time she bids goodbye to Mr Abernathy and runs up to the house to change for work, she is brimming with optimism once more. Together, they have gone over the plan and looked through the pages of the book, noting successes, works in progress, and actions to be carried out at a later date. Despite Mr Abernathy’s enthusiasm for the idea, her plans regarding Harry and Draco are not yet ready to be implemented.
“You look happy, that’s all,” Eilish says, when he shows her the photographs. “You look a lot happier now than you did when you first came here.”
“That’s rich coming from you, darling,” Pansy had muttered the last time he had voiced this thought, and he had hexed the legs off her chair.
Harry allows himself a moment to picture Mr Borteg’s spindly figure lurching around in the multicoloured madness of George’s shop. He smiles.
Danica empties several biscuits out onto a plate and pushes the tin towards Harry. Carefully, he places the mouse inside as Danica punches air holes through the lid with her wand. Once everything is secure, he lifts the spell, allowing the mouse to dart in circles around the tin, picking up biscuit crumbs and nibbling on them contentedly, seemingly none the worse for his adventure.
After dinner, the eighth years stayed back, as told. Professor McGonagall stood yet again, addressing the students.
"Y-you do?" Harry asked. Draco pulled back horrified, and let out a small squeak. Both boys were quite red by now.
"You were crying. You were crying, so I hexed you. What in the name of Merlin is wrong with me?" Harry sat down, his eyes filling with the salty tears. Draco sat down next to him. He wrapped his arms around the smaller boy, and pulled him closer. Harry didn't even give a second thought as he laid his head on the other's shoulder, his tears falling silently.
"Well Harry's mad at us because we told Madame Pomfrey about...you know. And I apparently imagined Malfoy calling Harry Harry, and them hugging. Oh, and something about Harry running out of the hospital wing."
When the evil little ferret didn't look away, but merely raised an eyebrow, Harry felt his cheeks heat up (from the embarrassment, of course) and dropped his head onto his empty plate. He could only hope Malfoy hadn't seen how pink in the face he was.
The blonde woman turned at the sound of her nickname, though no one had called her that in quite a while. Standing behind her was Lily Potter, and she smiled at her old friend.
Draco flopped on his bed. He'd done it, he'd ruined everything. Harry would never look at him the same, all he would see were the scars. Draco groaned. Theo looked up.
And, now, his final year. One more year, and then who knows what. Harry had no idea what he was going to do after this.
"Accio Bambi," Blaise tried. They waited a few minutes, but gave up when nothing happened. Blaise was about to try something else when something flew in through an open window and hit Ron in the side of the head.
Harry turned to Hermione. "DID YOU TELL EVERYONE WHERE WE WENT!" Apparently he was talking to her again, though Hermione wasn't sure the yelling was any better.
"I'm hanging in there, just miss her sometimes." Harry nodded in understanding. Dora's daughter was Tonks, Teddy's mother.
She hesitated for a moment. It was a Saturday, and she and Pansy had planned to meet up and do some homework, just hanging out when they were finished. Figuring what the two needed couldn't possibly take all day, she gave a nod, agreeing to meet up. She then went back to her meal, also making sure that Harry had a small bit of food. Not too much though, he was supposed to ease back into a normal breakfast. The Gryffindor watched as her brother picked up a piece of toast, and paled as it reached his mouth. He set it back down, feeling a bit sick. Hermione sighed.
Harry huffed, and looked back at the shivering blond with Madame Pomfrey, who was practically forcing a potion down his throat. He turned back to Dumbledore and raised an eyebrow, to which the man responded by chuckled softly.
"I was thinking you and I could set aside our differences, and become, I don't know, friends?" Harry stared at her for a few moments, while Pansy stood there awkwardly, awaiting a response.
"My name's Harry Potter." This caused the blond to look up at him, and he stared at Harry for what felt like ages, before grabbing his picture and holding it up next to him. Sticking his tongue out a bit, the blond studied his drawing next to the boy, finally setting it down with a sigh.
Eventually his legs came to a stop, and he looked up from the ground. The place was all too familiar, for he had died here not even a year ago. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to die here again.
The rest of the week went by painfully slowly, and Harry got bored quite often. It seemed like years before Harry was standing out on the front porch, hugging Andromeda goodbye on Christmas morning. He then apparated to the gates just outside of Malfoy Manor, where Draco was waiting for him.
"Well, are you coming in?" Draco's head turned towards the soft voice, and a smile was quickly forming on his face. He walked in, and shut the door behind him.
"Oh, would you look at the time? I better get some sleep, night guys!" Harry practically ran to his room after that.
"I don't know, I'm dating Luna, so obviously I like girls. But I still think guys are hot, and I would still date them if Luna and I didn't work out. I don't really know if that counts as bi, but I'm definitely not lesbian. I guess I could be pansexual...or maybe-"
"Mr. Malfoy, I think that's enough. You as well, Mr. Nott," Madame Pomfrey glared at both boys. They both shut up, but there were daggers coming out of both of their eyes. Harry wanted out of the hospital wing, right then and there. It was uncomfortable, the amount of hateful tension in the room.
The sorting began. Harry remembered his sorting; he had almost been put in Slytherin. He watched as child after child got sorted. When the sorting ended, Professor McGonagall stood up. She was the new headmaster.
"I love you." Draco let out a sigh of relief, while Harry stood there, trying to hold in his laughter.
The blond sighed, closing the door behind them before walking back to his bed. His eyes darted around the room, making sure it was empty, before he picked it up. He ran his thumbs over the material as he held it in his hands, feeling its soft texture. Slowly, Draco brought it up to his nose. It
"Just get out," he whispered. Hermione scowled and stormed out, slamming the door behind her. Tears of anger and frustration prickled her eyes as she walked all the way to her room. She tried not to cry, she really did, but once to door to her room closed, she couldn't help the tears from falling. She slid down the door, leaning against it and sobbing. Pansy looked up from the book she was reading on the couch, and her face filled with worry. She shut the book, and ran over to Hermione, wrapping her arms around the crying girl before her.
“Where are we going?” he asks after several minutes of silence and an unexpected trip along the motorway.
The ladies exchange significant looks, leaning in and conducting a whispered discussion that provokes Eilish to shout ‘what?!’ no less than three times. Finally, they sit back and pick up their teacups again.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea,” Ginny says later that night, sitting on the bank of the stream and fending off the clouds of midges with a neat little charm Luna has never seen before.
“Everyone’s just happy that you’re happy,” Hermione says quietly, displaying the sort of perceptiveness that makes Harry want to hug her and shake her at the same time.
Potter-Harry smiles, holding onto a squirming lizard with strong, skilled hands. “Great. Now get off my sawdust.”
Draco shifts his hips and Harry bites his lip, tasting blood on his tongue. Slowly, he draws back almost all the way. Draco’s cock jerks and leaks against his belly.
He trails off into incoherent panting as Harry strokes a slick hand over his cock and then presses himself close, bracing himself against the mattress and sliding his belly against Draco’s straining hardness with every push, sliding inside him and then pulling back, rocking into him and letting out a low groan as Draco tightens around him and grips his arse with both hands, pulling him in deeper.
Pansy snorts and holds up the newspaper, and of course it’s a picture of Harry kissing Draco in the middle of Diagon Alley. Of course it is. And of course the accompanying headline is absolutely ridiculous.
With that, she walks away, taking their empty glasses with her. Harry gets to his feet, swaying slightly for a moment, and then weaves his way out of the pub and into the night. The rain is shocking against his skin and sort of wonderful all at once. Draco steps out onto the street and tips his face up into the downpour.
Draco opens one eye and sighs. Something is flinging itself against the door of his quarters, bumping and scrabbling and making an enormous racket. The noise itself is nothing new to him; he hears it all the time, but there is something about the way it has made itself a maddeningly incessant soundtrack to this day that is skittering all over his last nerve. Yes, it’s extremely hot, and yes, a silent room full of ineffectual Cooling Charms is probably a very unexciting place for a sociable beetle, but he’s far too sticky and pressed-down weary to do anything about it.
Draco gives him a rather odd look and Harry wants to hex his own mouth shut. Draco knows all of that. He knows. It’s been years. He has no idea why he would he say such a ridiculous thing.
William smiles and shakes his head. “My goats cannae stand being cooped up. It’ll take more time than I’ve got to clear up the mess they’ll make. If youse are interested, though, I’ve got fresh butter, cheese, milk, eggs... and I’ll slip youse a few bottles of Gertie’s brew as well.”
On Saturday morning, the Diagon Alley Winter Festival opens in style. Florean is at his most ebullient, coat tails flapping in the wind as he bows almost to the ground and then draws his wand in a theatrical arc to reveal three new stalls grouped around the fountain. The crowd of shoppers and workers murmur amongst themselves and gasp when Florean flicks his wand to the sky and sets off a fall of magical snow that settles on the pitched wooden tops of the stalls.
“Because I like you, alright?” Draco snaps, taking a step forward and then retreating to grab at the counter behind him. “I like you and I wanted to see you and the best thing I could think of was to come up with an excuse to come to your shop. That’s the truth, it’s ridiculous, I feel stupid, are you happy now?”
“I regret that I got so old without marrying the person I’ve loved for most of my life,” Esmee says, wistful expression seeming to reach out and tug at Harry’s heart. “Shan says it’s just a piece of paper and we don’t need it. She’s right, but sometimes it’s not just about what you need.”
Head spinning, he closes his eyes, rocking his hips to a new, more urgent pattern until Draco groans and holds onto him so tightly that his fingernails cut into Harry’s skin. Falling forward on his hands, Harry kisses his chest, tasting salt on his tongue and smiling wearily.
“They’ll be fine. They’re good people. I think you owe them a few apologies, but I’m sure you can cope.”
“No,” Harry says, rubbing his hot face with both hands. “After the war... everything was supposed to be different. It was supposed to be about acceptance... forgiveness... starting again. God knows every speech I had to make said so. And yet here we are... we find a little bit of peace and it gets ruined. Everything’s... aren’t you fed up, Draco? I’m fed up. I’m extremely fucking fed up.”
“Is she dangerous?” he asks eventually, dragging his eyes back to Potter, who now looks completely bedraggled but merely blinks the raindrops from his eyelashes and shrugs.
At the sound of these magic words, the sofas are vacated instantly and play is redirected onto the floor at a slightly more ear-friendly volume. Amused and impressed, Luna watches them for a moment or two before heading for the office to have a look at her colleague’s outfits. In honour of her father, she is wearing the Kneazle-print nightie that started it all, along with stripy tights, purple wellington boots and a floppy straw hat.
“That’s really not the point,” Draco says, but he is smiling as he sits and bites into his undamaged toastie.
“What would the biddies do?” he murmurs, mostly to himself. He scans the contents of the fridge. “Jam. Jam is good.”
They soon lose sight of the ladies and fall into a wandering pattern of their own, ducking into little shops and peering at window displays of artworks and chocolates and obscenely expensive things for the shower. In a delicious-smelling bakery, Harry finds pork pies of every variety he can imagine and buys a miniature version of every single one. In a tiny local gallery, Draco buys postcards to send to his mother and six delicate teacups, each painted with the image of a different winter plant.
Harry shakes his head, words swept away as his sideways mind takes him back to the Burrow’s kitchen and the baffled face of Ginny’s French boyfriend. Something had nagged him about the image at the time, and now it’s so horribly obvious that he wants to slap himself.
“That’s nice,” Luna smiles, but Caroline’s expression remains woebegone. “Why don’t you write back to her? We could go up to the barn and send it to her tonight. I know which is the fastest owl—it could be there in time for the breakfast post at Hogwarts tomorrow.”
“Just because you can’t go outside doesn’t mean you have to create havoc inside,” Draco says, and Harry isn’t sure which of them he’s speaking to so he just stays quiet and watches Draco vanish the ink. “Bad beetle,” he adds after a moment.
“Lies,” Pansy sings, resting her chin in one hand and smirking at him. “Let’s have some facts, shall we? It’s two minutes past six on Monday the eleventh of April, the sun hasn’t quite risen and yet for some reason I am awake, conditions are cloudy with rain expected later and a high of eighteen degrees. We’ll have the news in just a few minutes, for now, enjoy this song from Camel Chaos.”
“No, I’m not,” Harry mumbles, and then he’s lost in the landslide of hot, painful, relief that drops them both to their knees on the cold, shifting pebbles, clinging to each other and fighting to pour years of failed connection into a breathless kiss that leaves them both open and needing and shaken.
“Erm… apples are part of the rose family?” Harry offers, picking up a shiny Granny Smith and handing it to Draco.
Esmee and Shan exchange glances. “Reuben says there wasn’t much in the till,” Esmee says carefully. “But they did take a barrel of unicorn horn and all the presents from his charity tree.”
“There was a child present who isn’t even mentioned in this article,” Draco adds, holding out the newspaper.
Draco picks up another set of parchments and settles back into his red armchair. After a moment, his brow furrows and he reaches for his red ink. Idly, Harry gazes at the other, rarely-used pots of ink that dot the floor around Draco’s chair. All the pots are almost full, and he has green, blue, black, and even a rich sort of purple that glows warmly in the light from the fire. Amused, Harry thinks of the chewed ballpoint pen that sits in his jacket pocket and creates the spidery handwriting that makes Draco want to murder him a little bit.
and her old housemate Terry Boot, who had turned out to be Jayne’s second cousin, once removed. Ginny, of course, has no idea that her chance encounter was anything but, nor does she have any idea that Luna was hiding behind a cart full of cabbages, snapping a photograph for her book and making sure everything went just as planned. There is, after all, a possibility that she might think that was
The play, entitled ‘We Wish You a Feathery Christmas’ turns out to be both bizarre and compelling, and Harry can’t seem to take his eyes away from the stage, even when Ida starts handing out humbugs and Corrie goes one better with a flask of something steaming and spicy. The plot is a rather loose affair, shifting from the plains of Africa to the bottom of the sea and the wild Antarctic with little warning or explanation, but the birds, led by a beaming Rose in a papier mache blue tit costume, appear in almost every scene, telling the story of each group of animals in loud, confident voices.
“I’m a Weasley first,” she says, regarding Draco with her best no-nonsense expression, the one she saves for special occasions.
“They took the presents,” he says softly. “The new magic on our till seems to have outsmarted them.”
They settle themselves at a small round table near the fireplace, leaning towards the flames until steam begins to rise from their drenched clothes. Draco sips his beer and gazes at Harry, brow furrowed.
And then he stops, frowning into his half-empty cup. It’s four in the morning. There’s no one to distract him. Draco won’t be driving the Knight Bus for hours and the biddies, with the possible exception of Danica, will still be warm in their beds.
Ida’s stepchildren can neglect her, they can treat her shabbily and they can grasp at her possessions without a care, but they can’t touch the camaraderie and devotion of the biddy club. Were any one of them in the same situation, Harry knows that the others would be there to wait and fuss and throw cake at the problem until it ran away with its tail between its legs. They are as hard as nails and as soft as marshmallow and somehow, they have absorbed Draco into their midst, and are well on the way to claiming Harry, too. He doesn’t think he minds.
“I don’t know what you think I’m lying about, Pansy, but you’re very much mistaken,” he says, a little more crossly than he means to.
Draco eyes him sternly. “My schedule is top secret. Only me and the biddy club know where we are going, and that’s the way it’s going to stay.”
In a now-practised movement, Harry grabs his wand and touches it to the parchment, watching the map of Diagon Alley melt into a schematic of Mr Borteg’s distillery. It’s only the second day of the investigation, but he is already starting to feel like he knows what he’s doing. If he could only extend that confidence to anything concerning Draco, he’d be set. Unfortunately, with his pacing and his shirtsleeves and his fucking swan, Draco is proving even more of a challenge than usual.
“I saw the whole thing!” he booms, accent startlingly refined. “I don’t know what they want with that lovely family but they ought to be strung up! That poor little girl was terrified! Crying her eyes out! Her mother was furious, and who could blame her!”
“Well, they are pretty difficult to tell apart,” Ginny says, looking over her shoulder just in time to see Louis drop his end of the table on his foot and swear loudly in French.
“I know George and Angelina are staying in on Christmas Eve,” she muses. “Maybe they wouldn’t mind looking after the children. Have you called Molly yet?”
“I could stay here, you know,” he murmurs, not sure if he really means it, or even if he really cares.
By the time Harry finds Draco at the lake for a third night in a row, he no longer feels irritated or even unsettled. When he thinks about it, the whole thing makes sense, both of them wandering the grounds at night when they should be sleeping. Perhaps Draco can’t sleep. Perhaps he doesn’t want to. Harry doesn’t suppose it matters either way. The silence feels different now, and when Harry offers half of his ginger cake to throw to the squid, Draco takes it and almost smiles.
“I don’t have any right now,” Mr Jennings says, looking around anxiously as though someone might burst through the door and start smashing up his ink bottles again. “I’ll get a delivery in a day or two if you’d like to come back then.”
The ladies laugh delightedly, and it’s almost enough to stop Harry wondering how Draco is getting on with an unimpressed dachshund under his feet.
“Oh, you’re funny. About as funny as a big sack full of stolen Christmas presents, which, when I think about it, is sort of grim. What’s that children’s story about the monster that stole Christmas?”
Molly picks up the kettle and smiles at him, purpose seemingly restored. “Height isn’t everything, anyway,” she says. “Look at Ron—six foot four and built like a toothbrush.”
“And a large tea, please,” Harry says, intimidated and delighted at the same time. When Mrs Purley nods and turns away, he notices the little glowing glass cone on her counter. “I see you have one of these, too. Quite a saleswoman, isn’t she?”
“Not to worry, Mrs Purley, everything’s under control,” Harry says, forcing a smile and squashing his fingers between his knees in an attempt to control the shock of pain caused by the combination of swan beak and raw, bitten nail beds.
“Draco,” he mumbles to himself, forcing his way through the fog and tumbling easily to the ground when the bus swings and throws him against the luggage rack.
Despite his best efforts, Harry is the last to arrive at the Burrow for Christmas lunch. He throws as much self control as he can muster into getting out of bed at a reasonable hour, but Draco is warm and languorous and already seems to know exactly how to touch Harry to make him lose his higher brain functions. It’s not Harry’s fault, the man just makes him weak, and by the looks on the faces of everyone present in the Weasleys’ kitchen, every last one of them knows it, too.
“Well, that’s quite exciting,” Harry admits, and Draco smiles. “Don’t you cook? You seem to have quite a fancy little kitchen up there.”
Amused, Harry drinks his coffee, relishing the rich taste and the creeping warmth. When Draco sits and leans against him to sip his own drink, Harry smiles into his cup, caught in a rush of love that spreads right out to his fingertips.
“Can you swap with me today and do Movement to Music with the little ones?” Deb asks, twisting her shiny dark hair into a bun and pinning it in place. “I have to pick up Nola from her dad’s.”
“Children are much the same as they have ever been, I see,” he says, jigging Hugo gently and treating him to a ghoulish smile.
When it comes down to it, he chooses badly. He has let his friends try, and despite their best efforts, they have chosen badly, too. And it’s fine, because now that he’s in his thirties, he’s begun to appreciate the simple pleasure of being by himself and doing whatever the hell he wants to do. He sleeps better without the snores of a rhinoceros or the constant groping of drunken hands, and no one is sucking the joy out of his life because they can’t find their own.
As they reach the top of the alley, ready to make their way back down, Deb turns around at the head of the group and yells, “Let’s dance!”
The delight on their faces as they bounce up and down and hug each other lifts her like a Cheering Charm and she can’t help but laugh when Caroline’s excitement sets off yet another burst of accidental magic, this time causing all the chairs in the room to spin around in circles. Unsurprisingly, when given the option, the children vote to spend the extra money on a healthy percussion section, and, as Luna leaves the room, are gathered around owl-order catalogues, chattering and drawing circles around pictures of drums and tambourines and maracas.
I mentioned that Marie was trying to explode my brain with some of these prompts... this one was the most impressive of all. Sure, let's have a bonfire on the 23rd of December. For what it's worth, all the weird shit that goes on in this chapter is, according to my research, based on real festive tradition. Batshit brilliance :)
He picks up his dirty clothes, humming with anticipation as he does his best to spell them presentable. Still feeling gritty and uncomfortable, he strokes a grubby Needle and heads for the stairs, smiling when Draco’s voice drifts over the sound of running water.
Pansy lets out a snort of amusement. “I don’t know... I suppose it’s just that there’s something very odd about a man who keeps ducks. It’s not very sexy, is it?”
At the sound of his name, Needle rises from his crate and shambles across the shop. There is something about his awkward, pitching gait that reminds Harry of Mr Borteg, and he finds himself wondering if he, too, would be more graceful on water than on land.
“It’s beautiful out there,” she says. “Smells like summer.” He smiles wearily for her and listens to the others, their tentative ‘maybe we could’-s and ‘do you think Harry would want to...?’-s drifting up through the nooks and crannies of the old house.
“Harry… you’re amazing. I don’t know what you did… I don’t want to know. Thank you.” She looks at the clock. “Shouldn’t you be at the Burrow?”
After food, tea, and Pepper-up have chased away the worst of Harry’s symptoms, he cleans and folds his borrowed blanket and returns it to its hamper. Draco puts the
, Luna thinks. So, on Saturday... she closes her eyes, infuriated with herself. It’s obvious now exactly what Caroline saw during the eclipse. So obvious that she feels herself flush with shame at having missed it. She has been focused on her own agenda for these two, but still...
“Those were lies. Those innocent members of the public were a reporter and photographer from the Daily Prophet, who walked into Hermione Granger’s garden and starting questioning her daughter. They wanted information about Harry Potter. About his activities. Hermione Granger’s daughter is four years old. When they wouldn’t leave, she drew her wand. She shouted at them. She tried to protect her daughter. The editor of the Daily Prophet has seen a memory that proves her innocence, but they don’t care about her reputation. They don’t care, so someone else is going to have to care for them. I don’t know about any of you, but I am going to be watching them. I’m going to make it my business to watch them, and I’m going to be here every morning, telling you what I’ve seen. And if anyone from the Prophet has a problem with that, I’m at the WWN building, tenth floor, studio two. I’m here from six until twelve noon, Monday to Friday, and I’ve had enough.”
Dean and Seamus were going to stop by the hospital wing to say hello to Madame Pomfrey, who they both agreed wasn't appreciated enough. They stopped at the door, noticing laughs and voices coming from inside. They peeked open the door to see Harry sitting next to Malfoy in a hospital bed, with Hermione in a chair across from them. The three were laughing, and Harry and Hermione looked quite happy to be with their old enemy, Draco Malfoy. Dean and Seamus shared a devilish look, and quickly left to their room to discuss the new information, Madame Pomfrey forgotten.
Harry ran out of the room, and straight to his. He threw open his trunk, grabbed the invisibility cloak and Marauder's Map, then left as quickly as he'd came. The whole time, Neville was staring at him like he was insane. Harry hadn't even noticed he was there.
"I'm going to bed," he stated, and plopped onto his bed without another word, not even bothering to change. He didn't fall asleep though. He couldn't. He never wanted to sleep again.
Harry hadn't left his room since. Not for classes, not for meals, not to watch the Quidditch practices that Ginny had invited him to. It was as if he didn't even exist anymore. The only people who ever saw him anymore were Ginny, Hermione, Draco, and of course Neville, since they did share a room.
"Last one, I'll ask you both the same. Because I'm evil, what's something you've never told anybody in your entire life?"
"Haven't I already told you what it was? My soulmate, I want a new one. That's why we're going to the library, isn't it?" Pansy stopped walking and turned so she was facing him.
"Is he sleeping?" Arthur asked, though he knew he wasn't. George was looking at Ron, his breaths becoming quick and shallow. Ginny stared with wide eyes, before nodding and grasping Luna's hand tightly, eyes shut tight. Luna dropped her head down, shedding a few quiet tears, while Molly cried into her husband's shoulder. Bill started trembling, nearly dropping the baby. Fleur silently took her child from him, placing a light kiss on his cheek. Percy had to look away, as he tried not to think about the memories of him and his brother flooding his head.
"Oh right. Just needed to clear my head, I guess." They didn't talk for a little while, before Harry said, "Ginny, so you love me?"
"It doesn't matter, you still said what you said! You can't jus-" She stopped when she saw something, or rather someone, running towards them. The two had barely moved out of the way when the figure ran past them. Hermione looked towards them, about to yell at them too, when she saw it was Draco, carrying something in his arms. It looked like...oh my gosh.
Life was stupid. Living just to die in the end. Dying to cause pain to the living. It was an endless cycle of pain, just as it always had been.
"Don't lie Hermione. I know you and Ron have been fighting, and I know it's my fault. You guys are fighting because of me." Hermione hugged him tighted.
"Care to be more specific?" Harry laughed, before remembering that they "weren't friends." The class gave them odd looks, and Harry blushed from the sudden amount of attention. He grumbled, turning back to the potion. The lid was already back on, because love potions were dangerous. They ruined lives, with the false love, creating unhappiness for both sides, though not apparent at once.
"I was looking for Harry, because we had planned to finish the essay for Potions together later. I looked all over, and eventually went to the lake, because that's where he goes to clear his head and relax. This was how I found him when I got there," was what he had told everyone. This was obviously no help, so they had to wait for Harry to wake up for any real answers.
Mrs. Weasley seemed to notice him there, because she said, quite awkwardly, "Oh, Harry dear, your back. Come sit down and finish eating!" Hermione went red from embarrassment. Harry went back to wear he was sitting, and an uncomfortable silence filled the room for the rest of dinner.
"I'm doing great. Oh, Teddy will be so happy to see you! He's almost nine months old now. He can sit up, and he's even started crawling a bit." Wow, Harry had missed a lot. Would Teddy even remember him, it had been a few months since he saw Harry last.
"Let him go, he needs some time to himself right now. Besides, I need your help carrying Ron back to the school." Pansy sighed, and turned around. Blaise still hadn't moved, his eyes trained on the body beneath him. She walked to her friend, and put an arm around his shoulder. He was unbelievably tense, but he did turn his head to look at Pansy.
"Actually Dray, it's Harry. He absolutely hates his last name, so you are now forbidden to call him that ever again. Any disagreements and I'm afraid while have to work this out the hard way." She smiled innocently up at her blond housemate as if she hadn't just threatened him. Harry stared at her strangely, before turning his gaze to the floor.
"You didn't see it happen. You weren't...you weren't...it really was me this time, Draco." And Harry didn't even know he had it in him, but he started crying again. He just wanted everyone to leave. He wanted the pitiful looks to go away, and he wanted people to stop telling him it was going to be okay, that he was going to be okay. Because couldn't they see that he wasn't, and that he'd never be.
"Of course." Pansy smiled and watched as her girlfriend walked of. "You couldn't have been a bit nicer?" she asked the blond.
"I never tell anybody stuff like this," a muffled voice replied. Draco sighed, staring helplessly at Harry.
"Black, what are you doing here?" James started coldly, glaring at the old Slytherin. They had never gotten along, for Narcissa thought James was still a bit arrogant, even if his big head had deflated some. Oh, and there was the matter of the bullying. When Snape had told her about it, she marched off and gave the Gryffindor a good telling off, with maybe one or two well-deserved slaps to the face.
Pansy cleared her throat so everyone would be quiet. A few Slytherins turned to look, but that was it. "EVERYONE LISTEN UP!" Pansy yelled. The room fell silent, and all eyes fell on the two, who were holding hands, standing on a table. Even the teachers were quite interested with the matter.
"WHAT!" Nearly everyone in the room turned to stare at Ron, and he flushed out of embarrassment, now trying to seemingly hide, sinking in his chair.
James was baffled, to say the least. His son was friends with...a Malfoy. Out of everyone in the entire daycare, and there was quite an abundance of children, it had to be a Malfoy. He kept his mouth shut tight, watching as the three approached him and his wife.
"Not yet, want to take a stroll to the kitchen with me?" Draco was shocked, to say the least. What had Luna done to convince him to leave?
"I'm going to help with dinner. You can let the others in when they arrive." The two nodded, and Harry went into the kitchen, finding Draco tossing a salad. He stopped and looked up when Harry walked in.
Pansy rarely saw Draco anymore. She spent her time comforting Blaise and Hermione, for her time for mourning was gone. She hadn't spoken to Ron very much, but she had considered him a friend. He'd been great about her getting together with Hermione, and even found someone else for himself.
"Yeah Rose, you're not the boss of me," Teddy said, sticking his tongue. Rose returned the action, and Harry set Teddy back down on the ground. The two proceeded to run around the house, screaming and chasing each other.
"Me! You want me to be your boyfriend?" His face was one of horror, causing Draco to flinch slightly. Would it really be that bad?
"Well, I tried a few things. Auror wasn't for me, so Charlie invited me to Romania to see if I'd like working with dragons any better. I was there a few months, but I didn't like it any better, maybe even worse. So then I looked into being a healer, but at the time I was looking into adopting my godson, and I didn't have the time. So, once Teddy was adopted, I just decided to focus my life on raising him."
better," Draco said sarcastically, rolling his eyes as he lowered Harry back onto the couch. "Now tell me what's going on."
"Oh, um...Luna." Harry was quiet, too quiet. Maybe she shouldn't have told him. Maybe he wouldn't accept her. Oh gosh, she ruined everything. "Harry?"
"Blaise is just freaking out, he'll be here soon," George said, smirking. Harry nodded, inviting him in. Just seconds later, Blaise had apparated there, and Harry let him in as well.
Draco's eyes widened. "You got attacked? By who?" By then Harry seemed to have realized what he'd said, and he tried to cover it up.
"Ron, why don't you head to bed, and I'll figure this out myself?" Harry suggested after hearing the boy yawn yet again, something he seemed to be doing every few seconds.
"Attack? What does she mean attack?" Harry glared down in his lap, head still resting comfortably on his knees. Hermione looked at Harry in disbelief.
"Spells won't work. We have help him calm down, or we wait it out," Hermione said to Madame Pomfrey, who was still trying multiple spells. She stopped, and Hermione went and whispered something in her ear. Madame Pomfrey nodded, and left the room.
"My godfather has a house-elf, but the only ones I've ever known very well were Dobby and Winky." Draco froze.
Dean and Seamus arrived just before Hermione, admiring the comfortable beanbags the room had provided for them. There were three, but Dean and Seamus shared one, taking a seat as the door opened, revealing a concerned Hermione.
"Why me?" Harry wondered how many times he was going to be asked that today, because surely most people wouldn't miss their enemies.
Harry couldn't help but smile, despite all that's happened in the last couple hours. Draco laced Harry's fingers with his, and they walked hand in hand back to the school.
Harry hadn't slept in at least two weeks. He couldn't, he got nightmares every time, filling him with more guilt and grief than thought possible. The problem with not sleeping, was that he could hardly keep his eyes open anymore. Countless times, he'd almost fallen asleep during meals with the Weasley's.
"Hey!" So Draco grabbed Harry's potato man, and shoved it in the other boy's face. And then it was war, and food was flying everywhere. House-elves were scrambling to get out of the way, instead cowering in a far corner of the room, huddled together. Draco was covered in all sorts of food, but he couldn't care less. And then he was dumping a pitcher of pumpkin juice on Harry's head, and Harry was laughing again, a sound he hadn't heard in weeks.
"Harry relax. This is my other gift to you, remember. You'll thank me later." I hope, she added in her head. Harry just nodded, and took a seat next to her. They waited while Hermione filled out the forms. She would occasionally stop and ask him a random question, like, "How much do you weigh?" or something similar.
"No Harry, it's not your fault. Not everything is, you know." Harry nodded, but didn't actually believe what she'd said. Draco stood there awkwardly, shuffling his feet a bit. He knew that Harry and Hermione making up meant they wouldn't be spending as much time together, but he tried not to let that bother him. He was glad the two were friends again, Harry was bound to be happier now...right?
The whistle blew, and Harry scrambled to get his shoes and socks off, then stepped into the water. It was ice cold, sending a shiver up the Gryffindor's spine. He reached into his pocket, pulled out the gillyweed, and stuck it into his mouth, chewing quickly. Harry had no idea how
Harry looked up at Draco innocently as the blond held the stuffed ferret between two fingers, holding it out away from him. Harry burst into laughter, along with Narcissa and Lucius.
"Oh," was all Ron said before turning around, and walking to the Great Hall, hoping Harry would be there. On the way, he saw Malfoy, and called out. Malfoy turned around as Ron jogged toward him.
"Yes, well I believe it was rightfully justified, seeing as what you did to him was much worse," Draco replied, pointing at Harry. It was strange to think that they had been getting along so well just a few hours prior, while their eyes now showed so much hate towards one another.
Harry hurried to meet his friends in the Great Hall, grabbing his book bag and rushing out of the common room. He'd slept in again, and Ron apparently didn't have enough decency to wake him up. Turning the corner and practically running down the hall, he skidded to a halt when he heard the song. He dropped his bag when he saw who was humming it, books falling out and scattering the floor.
"I figured it's the most believable. I mean, it's not every day you start dating your enemy of four years." Harry chuckled softly.
"I presume Harry told you all what happened." They nodded. "He's in the Hospital Wing, and I'm headed there now. Would any of you like to come?" Dean and Seamus walked over to her, Neville following. Harry didn't move, except to sit up. Draco decided to stay with Harry, in case he tried anything again. Hermione stayed just a bit longer, hoping Harry would change his mind. "The Weasley's will be there, I'm sure they'd like to see you." This seemed to make things worse, so she gave up, and the four left.
. Draco forgot how to breathe, and all he could do was look into the emerald eyes, and Merlin, he was in love. It wasn't just some silly crush anymore. He was officially in love with Harry Potter.
"Maybe it's Neville. They share a room, and have you seen him without a shirt?" Seamus added, receiving a playful smack on the arm from Dean.
Lily crouched down so she was level with the small toddler that was cowering behind his father's leg. Reaching a hand out, she ran it through the boy's midnight black hair that was already starting to look as wild as his dad's.
"Harry Potter," he answered in a small voice, making Harry's eyes widen as he glanced over at Draco, who avoided looking at him, instead choosing to admire the ground.
The three Slytherins and Ginny talked, Draco glancing towards Harry's door every once in a while. Okay, so maybe it was every ten seconds, but at least he was being discreet!
Hermione stepped out of the fireplace, clearing away the mess she had made with a flick of her wand. She walked away, and up the stairs, to the room containing Mr. Harry James Potter himself. She sighed to herself when she saw him. He looked so...
"Purple, huh?" Harry smiles, tickling the small boy under his chin with his finger. Teddy giggled, grabbing Harry's finger and sticking it in his mouth, puffing his cheeks out. "Teddy, that's disgusting! You have no idea where my fingers have been!" Harry pulled his finger out, now wet and covered in saliva, laughing as Teddy started blowing raspberries.
"Alright class, today, we will be brewing amortentia. Since you all already know what this is and what it does, we are just going to get right into it. You may begin now."
"Draco, I know Potter looks great and all, but maybe instead of him, you could eat your dinner," she smirked, feeling satisfied when he turned red and grabbed the green apple off his plate.
"Hello, Malfoy," Deam smirked. "How's it going?" Assuming this was a trap of some sort, the blond pulled out his wand and pointed it at the three, betrayal in his eyes as he stared at Hermione.
Harry hadn't seen him since his trial, where he testified. It was only right, seeing as how he had saving Harry's life, that Harry saved is. Just the thought of Azkaban made him shudder slightly.
"Well, yes but-" They were interrupted by a knock on the door. Draco looked at Harry as if to ask permission to open it. Harry really didn't want visitors right now. He looked and felt much too awful for it. So he gave a weak shake of his head, and Draco nodded, getting up. He walked to the door, opening it slowly.
"Back already, Malfoy?" Ginny asked, raising an eyebrow. Everyone else dropped their conversation to look at him, though Luna seemed to be looking next to him rather than at him.
"Well, first off, I was looking for you to make sure you were okay. Second, did you and Malfoy just hug? And third," he turned to face Malfoy, "you called him Harry."
After bawling for about five more minutes, Harry collected himself, stood up, and continued on his way out of the passage. When he reached the tree, he didn't even try to suspend the tree. Miraculously, he wasn't hit, though Harry didn't notice. It was like his body, emotions and all, had shut off completely. He walked into the Forbidden Forest, not really sure where he was headed, just letting his legs take him wherever.
Harry arrived five minutes before eleven, not wanting to be late. Okay, so maybe it had been Hermione's idea in case something went wrong, but why did it matter? Besides, she didn't really know who he was meeting up with, and neither did Ron. Harry figured the situation didn't need to be shared with them, and that Draco probably didn't want them to know anyway. He just told his friends he needed to be at the station at eleven, and ignored the follow up questions he was asked.
"That's fine," she replied, and she pulled him into a long, deep kiss. Ron cleared his throat. Harry and Ginny pulled away after that. Harry couldn't help but think the kiss felt a bit...different.
"Well, looks like you dragged yourself into this mess too. Come on, we better go, she really will drag us by the ear, did it once to Percy when he wouldn't leave his room, too busy studying or something." The two walked into the house, and Draco looked around curiously. Harry led him out the back door, where a bunch of people were waiting. All the Weasleys, Luna and her father, Pansy and her parents, Hermione, Blaise, Andromeda and Teddy, even Narcissa was there. Harry and Draco quickly let go of each other's hands at Andromeda and Narcissa's knowing looks.
"I just...I don't know why I'm here actually," he muttered, rocking back and forth on his feet. Harry saw Dumbledore wink at him before returning to his conversation with Bagman, and he blushed despite himself.
"But why would he..." His voice trailed off as his eyes wandered to the unmoving body on the ground, and he inhaled sharply. "Is he..." Hermione nodded sadly, and Pansy once again encased the girl in her arms.
They reached the doors far too fast for Hermione's liking, and she dreaded actually stepping in. Most would be at lunch now, and she didn't really want to make a scene and announce it to the whole school. So they didn't go to the Great Hall. Instead they went to the hospital wing, though they knew nothing could be done.
