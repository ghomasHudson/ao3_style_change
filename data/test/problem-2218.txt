Draco shrugs. "Lots of things. My father, for one. I have always looked up to him, always wanted to make him proud, but he's never been particularly nice to me. It was lonely, growing up, I don't have any siblings, nor did I have any friends as there weren't many kids around. Dad always worked a lot, and Mum too. Mostly the only company I had were the house elves, and they were scared of me." Harry is starting to realise what Draco had meant by them being similar. No friends, no company or kindness during the earlier years of their lives.
Harry has to endure months of Hermione's encouragements regarding Cho, at the same time as he's trying to deal with Malfoy, Umbridge's detentions, the students' gossiping about him, his nightmares, not being able to talk to Sirius, the ever-growing mountains of homework, plus the regular DA meetings. He's almost thankful he doesn't have Quidditch to worry about on top of all that anymore, but at the same time he would do anything to be up on his broom again. Flying has proved a great stress reliever.
"I always thought," Draco continues, "that what my father taught me was right. I literally didn't know anything else. That's why I've been such a prick. He taught me that purebloods like ourselves are superior, and I believed it. I was just a kid, you know. And I know that doesn't excuse my behaviour, especially as I got older, but it hasn't exactly been easy. All I ever wanted to do as a kid was make my father proud. I thought, maybe if I was a good enough son he'd be less distant, maybe he'd hug me... I don't know." He pauses. Harry feels awful - all this time, he'd thought Draco bullied people because he enjoyed it. When really, much like Harry himself, he'd been lonely and insecure, just acting like he thought he was supposed to.
basically the battle of hogwarts only shortened and mainly focusing on the little bits where harry sees or thinks about draco (bc this is a drarry fic in case you haven't noticed yet) (yes, sarcasm) and also it's really short. whatta nice summary i really should be a published author huh? enjoy
"Fuck," Malfoy breathes. They're both close, so close, and then - way too soon in Harry's opinion - it's over. They stand still for a second, catching their breaths before Harry steps away and Malfoy takes out his wand to clean up. They put their clothes back on in an awkward silence. Harry doesn't know what to say, or if he even should say anything.
"Well," Malfoy says after a moment of awkward silence. "I think I have to take 5 points from Gryffindor just for wasting my time." He smirks.
That's what he'd said. Whatever it is Malfoy is up to, it doesn't seem like he wants to do it. He still isn't saying anything, so Harry decides to take a risk. He moves closer to Malfoy and puts an arm around him.
Soon Draco calms himself, frees himself from Harry’s grip, wipes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Then he clears his throat and mumbles out a small “I’m sorry.”
It's pitch black with the door closed and he can barely make out Malfoy's face. Malfoy lights his wand and puts it on an empty shelf before he turns to face Harry.
He scowls at the mental image of that. What would he do exactly? Run up to Malfoy after potions and shout loud enough for everyone to hear
responsibility. It's Harry's job to kill him. If he doesn't, and Voldemort ends up killing Draco it would definitely be Harry's fault.
“So, uh,” he starts, then silently scolds himself for sounding like an idiot. “Well, I guess I just wanted to tell you that if you ever need anything I’m here for you and you are not alone. I know we’ve never been that close but you’re a good guy and I’d like to be your friend if you’d let me,” he finishes, still feeling awkward since he genuinely doesn’t have a clue how Draco will respond. He keeps his eyes fixed on his hands in his lap while awaiting an answer, scared to look up.
“I want you to know,” Harry says after swallowing, “that I forgave you a long time ago.” He pauses for a second before continuing. “Even back at school, during our sixth year, I started viewing you more as a complex person. When you’re a kid, everything is so black and white. You had been mean to me, therefore you were a bad person. Obviously that isn’t necessarily the case. When you first talked to me about your upbringing is when I started seeing the bigger picture. That there were reasons behind your actions. It can’t have been easy for you.”
"I'm the one who's sorry," he says. "I never even stopped to think about why you behave the way you do. When I first came to Hogwarts, I'd been bullied my whole life, and you reminded me of that a bit. I guess I never really gave you a chance to begin with."
"I don't blame you," Draco says with an empty laugh. "I was a real jerk to you, from the start." Harry stays silent. Of course, what Draco is saying is absolutely true, but Harry understands him on a whole new level now, and he doesn't want to make him feel any worse.
Harry has always felt drawn to Draco Malfoy, in a way he can't quite explain. He always seems to find an excuse to talk to him, or rather, yell at him. That's what they do - they fight, they scream, they insult, threaten and hex each other. But if Harry's being honest with himself, he wouldn't know what to do without Malfoy. He hates the bloke, sure, and he would like nothing more than to punch him right in his stupid face when he starts attacking Ron and Hermione, but he provides entertainment. Harry can always count on Malfoy to keep him busy when he's bored.
"I...maybe...yeah," he mumbles. Poor, sweet Draco. Harry can't help but feel overwhelmed with sympathy towards him. Draco is trying, he's trying
"Get your bloody glasses out of the way, Potter," he says breathlessly and Harry takes them off immediately. Then he tears Malfoy's robes open and attacks his neck; kissing, sucking marks into the pale, sensitive skin and occasionally biting down hard causing Malfoy to shudder. Harry very much enjoys the way he can make his
somehow, it suits him so much better. Instead of pushing him away, like Harry had expected, Draco puts his arms around Harry and hides his face in Harry's neck. Harry can feel Draco's tears running down his own skin, but he really couldn't care less. He just holds the broken boy in his arms tighter and strokes his hair.
"Not that they're much better themselves," Malfoy continues, probably just trying to stir up Harry's temper. "Mudbloods and blood traitors - I'll never understand why you keep such lousy company."
Harry is beyond grateful, he knows how much strength it must take for Draco to lie to his father like this. Draco's eyes linger on Harry's for just a second, and Harry can't help but remember all of their moments together. He faintly recalls the feeling of Draco's soft lips on his skin, his strong arms wrapped around Harry, the taste of him, the sounds he made... He represses a shudder at the thoughts.
He'd only asked her to the Yule Ball last year because he didn't really have anyone else to ask. He realises that it's a perfect cover-up, though, since Hermione guessed it herself it won't be too forced. "Oh, yeah... Yeah, I suppose," he adds quickly, to cover up his previous question. Hermione's extremely good at reading people, but Harry hopes she'll only take his slight confusion for awkward nervousness.
Harry's too caught up in the previous change in Malfoy's behaviour to feel angry or upset at his words. There had been something in his eyes - pity? Understanding? Is it possible that there is another person underneath all of Malfoy's nasty exterior? Harry shakes his head and silently puts his focus back on the potion in front of him again. He's probably just imagining things.
The next time they're alone isn't until after one of the DA meetings. Dobby came to warn them about Umbridge, and now Harry's running as fast as he can to get away from her and the Inquisitorial squad. When Malfoy catches him with a Trip Jinx, he's angry and frustrated. The DA meetings were the one thing left at Hogwarts he was actually enjoying, and now Umbridge has taken that away, too. Malfoy hoists Harry up by the back of his robes and whispers in his ear: "Got you, Potter." Harry tries to ignore the way his voice sends chills down his spine.
Hundreds of thoughts start swirling around in Harry’s head at once - questioning his feelings towards Ginny and Draco respectively, memories of the intimate moments he’d shared with the man sitting opposite him, wondering whether this is the life he’d always pictured and whether he’s actually happy...
"So," Harry starts after a while, and clears his throat awkwardly. "Is it okay that I call you Draco, now?"
As for Snape, Harry doesn't care. Snape is essentially the reason Harry's parents are dead, and he doesn't mind having another reason to hate him.
"You can't help me," he says, voice almost a whisper. His arm is shaking even more at this point, and Harry thinks he can see it drop just a little. He's not going to do it after all.
before Malfoy can do anything to defend himself. Malfoy's wand slips out of his hand and right into Harry's.
When Harry checks the Marauder's map one day on his way to dinner, he's surprised to see Malfoy alone in the bathroom. As neither Hermione or Ron seem to be getting to dinner on time, Harry figures it might be worth the detour. Either he'll be able to find out something useful about Malfoy's supposed mission, or he might - if he's lucky - at least get a blowjob.
oh also an important thing!! I know this is supposed to be canon compliant but i just couldn't bring myself to let the sectumsempra thing happen... i know it fucks with the whole hbp plot but... ignore that. this is what i wished could've happened instead, i guess.
One day in Potions class, Harry notices something. Almost everyone is off taking their Apparition test, so it's just Harry, Malfoy and Ernie Macmillan in class. This gives Harry a better opportunity to stare at Malfoy without having to worry about anyone noticing, and what Harry realises worries him. Malfoy looks paler; his skin still has that greyish tinge, probably because he so rarely sees daylight these days. But there is no air of smugness, or excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort... Harry doesn't know why this bothers him so much. Surely it's a good thing, given that it probably means Malfoy still isn't succeeding with his mission. Harry's been trying to get Malfoy to tell him what it is whenever the two are alone, but so far he's had no luck. There is just something about seeing Malfoy being so...
Harry only catches one last glimpse of Draco's face - now showing a mix of fear, relief and sadness - before he disappears with the other Death Eaters. Harry feels the spell being lifted off his body, and he immediately sets off after them.
It's Snape, of course, that gives Harry detention for what feels like the hundredth time. Only, this time, it will be even worse because
When Dumbledore offers Draco their help, Harry feels relief flooding through him. Draco could join their side, he would be okay, and Dumbledore would be alive. He wants to hug Dumbledore, to thank him for being ready to forgive Draco and help him move on... But these feelings are cut short only a moment later with Draco's reply.
"What's up, Harry?" Hermione is sitting by the fire in the Gryffindor common room reading a book, and only glances up at Harry once before continuing to read.
"I'm well aware of my extraordinary talents in potions, there's no need to point it out for me," Malfoy snaps.
"Make me," Malfoy challenges. Harry's first thought is to take out his wand and cast a Silencing Charm on him, but he quickly realises that probably isn't what Malfoy intended. Instead he walks closer to the Slytherin and pushes him back against the wall while starting to kiss him again. Harry is surprised to hear Malfoy moan under his lips, and decides he's being too gentle. He presses Malfoy harder against the wall, grabbing his waist. Malfoy puts his hands on Harry's chest and shoves him, just hard enough for their lips to be forced apart.
Suddenly Albus is rushed again, “Yeah, thanks” he replies while turning around and running back towards the train.
“It’s not fair,” he says eventually. “It’s just not fair. She was so good, so kind, and she knew… She knew me and she didn’t care, she loved me anyway, and she shouldn’t have- She shouldn’t have died, she didn’t deserve that. It should have been me, it should have been me in there instead, that’s what would have made sense, and Scorp would have his mum, and Tori could’ve found herself a real husband, a better husband, someone worth her time and her love, I- I can’t,” he stops talking abruptly once again but this time he can’t stop the tears from falling. “I can’t do this without her.” He chokes out the last words in between sobs, breaking Harry’s heart.
Draco clears his throat again and continues with a somewhat steady voice. “I don’t know what to say to Scorpius. I don’t know how to raise him alone. I don’t know how to be his dad and his mum. I don’t-” his voice falters mid-sentence and he stays quiet, seemingly fighting back more tears.
“You’ll be fine”, he says in a low voice, trying his best to sound calm and comforting despite knowing that his words can’t possibly make anything better for Draco right now. “You’re not alone.”
Malfoy seems to come back to himself, and the sneer reappears as he speaks. "Ha, no wonder. Not even the
I have literally never written smut before, but i got to the point in this story where i couldn't figure out a way to go forward without it. so be gentle with me. i did keep it as short and vague as possible and i was cringing during the entire time i wrote it and i had to take breaks.
Dumbledore greets the new addition of people, and meanwhile all Harry can think of is Draco. Draco had referred to himself as a coward. And if he truly believes that, he isn't going to be able to resist the pressure that is on him to finish what he's started. Especially now with more people on his side, egging him on, telling him to hurry, taunting him...
Harry shakes his head and grabs Draco’s hands in his own. “Don’t.” He hesitates, “Look. I know I might not be the one you would want to talk to about all this, but I am here if you need me. Okay?”
When Draco finally speaks his voice is weak. "I can't- I can't be sure," he says, avoiding eye contact with not only Harry but with everyone, his eyes glued to the floor.
Now there is nothing to see but fire. The flames are circling them, coming closer. Harry can't believe his luck when he spots a couple of old broomsticks. He seizes them quickly and throws one of them to Ron while he climbs onto the other himself.
"The hell's so funny, Potter?" Malfoy questions immediately. "Just hurry the fuck up, don't wanna stay in here forever."
"Don't think it means anything to me either, git." He shoves Malfoy's shoulder a little, suddenly nervous. "I can't help it you're hot."
"You're wrong," he says quietly as he wipes his face dry with the sleeve of his robes. "It's not okay."
Harry feels his anger rising. "No, I was raised in a cupboard if you must know," he bites back and starts vigorously stirring the potion, this time according to the instructions in the book.
"Is this the best you can do, Scarhead?" Malfoy tries to keep up the taunting voice he always uses around Harry, but he's panting and has to bite down hard on his lip just to keep himself from moaning out loud, so Harry hardly takes his words seriously.
anything." Harry snorts. As if it did for him. "But I haven't gotten laid in a while," Malfoy continues, "and you seem willing enough." He smirks at him again.
It's like Harry had flipped a switch. Malfoy stops. The anger disappears from his face, replaced by something Harry can't identify. He lowers his arm and gets off Harry, his wand forgotten in Harry's hand. Malfoy sits on the floor next to Harry as Harry pushes himself up into a sitting position. Neither of them say anything. Harry notices that Malfoy is still shaking, his eyes fixed on the bathroom floor, arms hugging his knees to his chest.
"I'm sorry," Harry says in a low voice. He isn't sure what he's apologising for exactly, but he hates everything that just happened. For some reason his heart breaks seeing Malfoy so upset.
Harry feels awkward. "Well, uh, I was just wondering... you're usually good with, like, feelings and stuff, yeah?"
He doesn't understand how it happens. Everything is going so fast - one minute Harry is demanding to know what Malfoy is up to, where he sneaks off to and what he's planning, with Malfoy refusing to answer and raining down insults at Harry, and the next moment they're kissing. They're
Harry doesn't think he's ever been more aware of his heartbeat, as he feels it speeding up and threatening to break out of his chest.
Draco is looking rather nervous and uncomfortable, dressed in muggle clothing at Harry’s demand. It doesn’t matter whether people know who they are or not if he’s walking in there with bright green wizard’s robes - that’s bound to draw some attention. Draco is hanging behind letting Harry go first, almost like he’s hiding behind him, and Harry finds this very amusing. He orders at the counter for the both of them and goes to find a table in the back, Draco trailing behind him a little lost.
Harry laughs and shakes his head, and even Draco is smiling a little. They sit in silence for a bit longer, looking at each other and smiling, both trying to come up with something new to say.
They're just about to get physical, which sadly doesn't go unnoticed by Snape. He's just taken points from Gryffindor,
"Just, I always thought Snape only favoured you because you're a Slytherin, but you're actually really good at this and it pisses me off," Harry glances up at Malfoy, who's frowning. "Never mind," he adds with a sigh.
He decides to give it a shot with Cho, maybe it'll help him get over Malfoy. At their last DA meeting before Christmas, she actually kisses him and although it mostly feels wrong, he kisses her back.
“Why?” Hundreds of more thoughts has been added to the swirling mess in Harry’s head and he doesn’t know how to make sense of any one of them.
(also we're now onto cursed child territory which i dont fully consider to be canon #SueMe so im taking liberties and am kind of not even trying to make sure it lines up with the events of cursed child. sorry not sorry)
As far as funerals go, Harry’s been to plenty. After the war there had been many casualties, and he had been determined to attend each one. Some - most - of them had just been a memorial service without the burial, since there was no body to bury. And every single one had been equally painful, whether Harry had known the person now dead or not, because they all took him back. Back to the war, back to losing everyone he did know and love, back...
“Come.” Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s left hand and guides him over to a small wooden bench placed along the wall. They sit down in silence and Harry wonders if he should say anything else or if he should leave it up to Draco. Before he can make a decision Draco speaks up.
Draco clears his throat and runs his hand through his hair. “I... You.. What happened, at Hogwarts, you know, between us,” he seems to be struggling to find the words, and Harry has no idea what Draco’s about to tell him.
Harry squints to get a better look at Draco. His body is betraying his emotions, stark against the threatening words; the outstretched arm is shaking, his voice is angry but sounds forced and mixed with fear, and his face is contorted in an attempt to keep himself from crying. He is clearly scared, and reluctant to finish the task he was given. The task, which finally has been revealed to Harry. Draco is supposed to murder Albus Dumbledore.
Draco laughs a little. "Yeah," he says. "Everyone always does. Living in a big house, with a well-connected father and lots of money - how could I not be happy?"
Harry's first date with Cho ends in a disaster, and he can't help but think it never would've been so complicated with a bloke.
“The fact that you feel guilty,” Harry says, “Shows that you have changed. Maybe you did some bad things, but that doesn’t make you a bad person. Just as a few good acts don’t make you a good person. The thing is, you can’t go back in time and change everything. All you can do is apologize, and to be better now. And I have to believe that’s enough.”
Harry's staring up at familiar features through his swollen eyes. Draco is here. Right in front of him, being demanded by his father and Bellatrix to confirm Harry's identity. Harry knows just by looking into Draco's eyes that he immediately recognises Harry despite his deformed face. He tries to give Draco a pleading look, begging him not to give them away, but without making anyone else suspicious. He tries to deliver words with his look. Words aimed not at the person Draco thinks he has to be, but at the boy who had once cried in Harry's arms; the boy who had exposed something else hidden deep within him, a part of Draco that is nothing like his harsh exterior. That's who Harry is trying to reach, because he knows he's in there.
in any classes he shares with Slytherin. Perhaps it had only been Harry's imagination, but he could've sworn that over the past few weeks of them being "friends" - or at the very least
“I don’t know what to do,” he says, his voice barely more than a whisper. Harry squeezes his hand and waits for him to keep going.
In the days that follow Harry catches himself smiling at Draco whenever no one is looking. He never gets a smile in return, but Draco will keep eye contact for a few seconds, letting Harry know it's okay. This slight change in behaviour between the two leaves Harry feeling a bit awkward, not to mention confused. Is he actually starting to like Draco Malfoy - as something more than just a good shag? As something like a... friend? The thought seems ridiculous to Harry and yet the feelings are there. Though they're still insulting each other at any given time, he doesn't feel the same passion as before. There is no weight behind the ugly words. In fact, more and more frequently the nasty fights between them are being replaced with friendly banter. Maybe people around them are noticing, or maybe not. Either way, no one is mentioning it. Maybe they are simply too busy with their own lives to acknowledge a difference in the stupid interactions between Draco and himself. Harry sighs. Maybe there is no reason in dwelling on it.
The door to where the three are standing on the Astronomy tower bursts open suddenly, and Draco's face changes at the sound; hardens. His wand is back up, pointed again at Dumbledore's face with a now somewhat steady hand. But as the other Death Eaters join him, Harry can still see terror in his eyes.
And then there's a loud noise from behind the door, startling the group. Harry looks over and sees someone entering through the doorway - Snape.
Harry knows being rich doesn't equal happiness, he would rather give up all the money his parents had left him than give up his friendship with Ron and Hermione.
Harry feels something stirring up inside of him at that. Old feelings that haven’t resurfaced in a long time, feelings Harry didn’t know still existed. He suddenly feels like
for Godric's sake; just simple, physical attraction. And who can blame him - the git's handsome. It's really all Malfoy's own fault, strutting around like he does with those stupidly fitted robes showing off his perfect arse, and always wearing that ridiculous smirk on his face - what does he expect? After all, Harry has
"That's probably for the best," Draco gives Harry a small smile back. Seeing Draco's smile, and knowing that he was the cause of it, makes Harry feel inexplicably happy.
When Crabbe tries to use the Cruciatus curse on Harry, Draco shouts at him to STOP. He claims they can't kill Harry because "the Dark Lord" needs him alive, but Harry can't help but agree with Crabbe's objections about how that doesn't mean they can't hurt him at all. It warms his heart that Draco still seems to care.
Draco glances up a Harry, and then he continues. "At first I didn't understand why you didn't like me. I just wanted to be friends, and you rejected me. But as I've watched you over the years, I get it. I realised not everyone thinks the way my father does. But it wasn't as if I could just change. I'm a coward, I couldn't stand up to my dad, or anyone. So I kept it up. And I'm sorry." Harry realises his eyes are watery after listening to Draco talking.
There isn't even the smallest trace of happiness in Draco's face right now. His eyes look empty, hollow; and the bags under them deeper than ever. His skin is almost paler than usual and he's become thinner, causing his cheekbones to be even more prominent. It makes Harry want to take him into his arms and comfort him. Even though really, in the current situation, it is
Malfoy bites his lip as if he's concentrating on something, and it really just makes Harry want to kiss him. "Maybe I'm just bored," Malfoy finally says.
Ron and Crabbe are running towards them, away from a roaring fire which seems to have appeared out of nowhere. It quickly becomes apparent, though, that it's Crabbe who's caused the flames to erupt from his wand - evidently without thinking about how it might affect himself and his friends as well. He seems to have no control over the fire, and Harry's attempt to extinguish it with Augamenti seems pathetic. The only thing they can do is run, so they do. The fire keeps spreading; chasing Harry, Ron and Hermione through the maze of junk. Harry had seen Draco grab the Stunned Goyle before joining their sprint away from the fire, but now he's nowhere to be seen. The three must've been separated from Harry and the others somewhere along the way.
Draco shrugs. “It’s not like I was innocent. I should’ve known better. I was so nasty to so many people. I still feel guilty for it everyday.”
“Being gay in the wizarding world isn’t a big deal. But marrying someone with whom I wouldn’t be able to have a biological child… My father would’ve never accepted it. I’m their only kid and there is pressure on me to continue the bloodline. There was no other option for me.” At this point he’s rambling, the words are falling out of his mouth quickly. He licks his lips nervously and continues:
"What is it you have to do?" Harry asks, for what feels like the millionth time, thinking that he's finally going to get an answer.
Finding out it was Marietta Edgecombe who'd told Umbridge about the DA provided Harry with an excellent reason to finally put an end to his and Cho's bizarre relationship. Surely, they never would've lasted anyway; Harry knows he's just been acting as Cedric's replacement.
Harry knows he needs to get his shit together, this obviously can't continue. Malfoy might be hot, but nothing could ever happen between them due to him also being, well, a bully. A not-very-good person. Yeah, Harry has to get over his stupid crush immediately. The only question is, how?
“Dad!” Harry is pulled from his thoughts as his youngest son comes running back to him right before the train is supposed to leave. “Dad, I need you to take me to Scorpius’ mum’s funeral. I don’t know when it is, I’ll send an owl, but I need you to know that I’m going and I don’t care how much you hate the Malfoys because Scorpius is my friend and he needs me to be there.” The words are falling out of Albus’ mouth in one, rushed sentence, and by the end of it he’s out of breath.
Malfoy rolls his eyes at him. "Come on, how hard can it be?" he says with a condescending voice as he works with the potion to fix Harry's mistake."It's only a Sleeping Draught, Potter."
someone - gleefully celebrating something in the Room of Requirement, Harry is sure this someone has to be Draco. And he doesn't know whether he should be happy for Draco's sake; clearly he has succeeded in whatever it was he's been trying to do, which hopefully means he will no longer be on Voldemort's hit list; or if he should be worried for his own sake. Worried, or even scared. If Draco's task had really been something that would help Voldemort, Harry could be in danger. Not
It's at the beginning of Harry's fifth year that he understands the reason behind his odd attachment. Attraction. Not
Having completely abandoned the task of getting the diadem, Harry swoops down low towards the two Slytherins. Draco sees him coming and raises his one free arm towards Harry. Harry attempts to help them up onto his broom, but it's too hard with Goyle being stunned. Thankfully Ron and Hermione are coming to help, and together they drag Goyle onto their broom while Draco climbs up behind Harry. Harry's mind blanks for a split second as Draco's arms wrap around his waist and their bodies are suddenly pressed together.
Unlike the last vandalism incident, there was no clear evidence this time – other than the fact that the perpetuator had
"Oh please. I'm not ignorant, darling." Narcissa rolled her eyes at him and leaned back against her seat, taking a dainty bite of her food before dabbing primly at the side of her mouth with her table napkin. "I saw the newspaper articles; I read all about how you supposedly had a 'fling' with Aria Potter. Well, actually, if those tacky tabloids are to be believed, you and a lot of other boys from Hogwarts. But knowing Aria Potter, and knowing
Glancing around the room, Aria caught the disapproving look Hermione sent her from where the brunette was sitting with a small group of Ravenclaw girls. She gave her best friend a sheepish grin in response, to which Hermione responded by rolling her eyes and smiling slightly before she turned back to her conversation with her new housemates.
Aria considered her question for a few seconds; but she eventually let out a resigned sigh and slowly shook her head.
Blaise was in the middle of a rowdy, half-drunk group of Slytherins and Gryffindors when they got there. The minute he saw Draco and Aria walk in through the doors, a smug, lecherous grin broke out onto his face.
"N—no, it wasn't…It's not that." Aria was quick to reassure him, her shoulders still heaving as she shook her head and managed to give him a comforting smile. "You didn't do anything wrong, it's just…It's too fast. W—we're going too fast." She stammered weakly, biting her lip.
Instead of saying anything, he pulled her closer, burying his face into her neck to hide his reaction. It was a long time before either of them spoke again after that, but eventually, it was Draco who broke the silence first.
"But that's the fun part, isn't it?" Blaise joked again as he set his book aside and studied Draco closely. "Wow, I really hate to tell you this, Malfoy. But you absolutely
As soon as Madam Pomfrey came back, she set to work on pouring out the correct dosages of all the healing potions Aria would be taking, placing them on her bedside table. "You'll need to drink three ounces of these,
Nodding to herself in affirmation, Aria closed her locker and was just about to head to the showers when she couldn't help but overhear a few of the racy comments Harper (or was it Graham?) began making about her from the other side of the partition. Not surprisingly, Aria heard Draco cutting off the boys' inappropriate remarks, his angry voice recognizable even through the walls.
He caught a whiff of a light, coconut-y shampoo scent, and he hummed, pressing closer until his face was buried against a soft, silky mane of long hair. A few minutes later, when his mind finally began to wake up, Draco realized that he was back in his flat in London.
"Well, everyone but Zach, I think." Morag told her. "But Merlin knows how slow that git is, I doubt he'll figure it out on his own." She added with a scoff.
Draco rolled his eyes and watched as Blaise used the momentary silence of everyone else to suddenly round on Aria with a mischievous gleam in his eye.
Longbottom. I reckon we'll make a proper Slytherin out of you yet." Blaise drawled loudly, smirking as he raised his glass up to Neville in a flashy gesture of acknowledgment.
"But that's just it, actually." She said softly, her shoulders slumping in defeat as she lowered her gaze and stared at her clenched hands on her lap. "I'm not so sure the attraction
one who was nice to me back when everyone else thought I was crazy. You'd better not hurt her or take advantage of her."
"Okay, I desperately need your opinion on something. What do you think of these two colors? Which one of these gowns should I wear to the Yule Ball?" She asked urgently, focusing her attention solely on Aria, Pansy and Morag.
authorized to make that decision, Headmistress." Blaise averred loudly, grinning as he glanced at Aria from the corner of his eye and gave her a wink. "I can talk to the rest of our housemates. And I can guarantee that we can clean everything up in time for the Yule Ball this Sunday." He told her.
Draco walked over to stand in front of the window and took the time to stare out at Hogwarts for awhile before he turned and strolled into the adjacent room in the corner, which actually turned out to be Aria's walk-in closet.
would take advantage of a situation like that." Aria drawled, rolling her eyes at him. "Why don't you do your own homework? I mean, as nice as Goyle is, he's not exactly a model student in History." She pointed out.
" Fisher's eyes gleamed and he sneered spitefully at Ron again before he turned and shoved through the other Gryffindor team members as he made his way across the field.
His solemn, admiring gaze didn't waver, however, and eventually, the disbelieving expression on Aria's face faded away, and she smiled at him.
"Chosen a mate?" Blaise noticed the visible tenseness in her expression and gave her a reassuring grin. "Well to be fair, she did choose one – my
As everyone around them gasped and turned to stare at the scene, Draco's fingers twitched dangerously, summoning his wand from its holster into his hand.
"I like you in my bed too." Draco growled back in a low voice, tracing an arduous path of kisses down the curve of her neck.
associated with Voldemort, if we're being honest. No doubt, they'll jump at any opportunity to expel Slytherin students." She explained.
"We do, but I'll explain more on that later." Wood clarified with a cheeky grin. "Anyway, as I was saying, this bloke, Vladislav — or Dracula, if you prefer. Since he was also a wizard, he liked to play a lot of ridiculous pranks on the muggle villagers who lived near his castle. He liked to make himself invisible in mirrors; he transformed into a bat in front of them; he pretended he was afraid of garlic; that he needed an invitation before he could enter homes — he made up all sorts of rubbish, really. Eventually, all of his asinine pranks became so notorious to muggles that a lot of them wrote books about him. And so all of these false beliefs about vampires became immortalized." He explained.
Her green eyes blazed with righteous indignation. "Can you blame me for being cautious?! The war had just ended and we were
"You are so full of it, Malfoy. This gown is hideous on me, I'm even beginning to think Hermione made me wear it on purpose." She lifted her head and looked up at him, giving him an unimpressed glare. "And besides, I'm not even in my true form right now."
" Aria looked a little pale as she stood up shakily from the ground, wrapping her arms protectively over herself.
"'Did you tell Headmistress McGonagall all this, Hermione?" Ron interjected from where he was watching their exchange, his eyes darting back and forth between the two girls.
go about seducing Ernie if you were in my position right now?" She pressed again, completely relentless.
He actually had a chance with the girl who had haunted his dreams ever since they met at Madam Malkin's robe shop nearly eight years ago.
"About us not being together, obviously!" Draco snapped again, feeling another overwhelming surge of anger when he saw the genuine confusion on her face. "What's the matter, Potter? Does the very idea of being paired with me disgust you so much?" He sneered.
Draco cursed again, breaking their kiss so he could bury his face into her neck, kissing, licking and nipping at her soft skin.
Whoever this girl was, she was obviously a very secretive person. But if she wanted to keep the correspondence between them this way, Draco was more than willing to oblige for now – as long as it came with the promise of actually seeing her beautiful face again.
He heard how awkward the words sounded when he said them out loud and winced, looking away to hide his embarrassment.
Another voice spoke up, and Draco, Blaise and Pansy looked up to see Luna Lovegood making her way over towards them. She knelt down on the floor beside Blaise and continued. "They're all under Bentley's hypnosis. It's a vampire moon, after all, so it's logical to assume that his powers are strong enough tonight that he's able to bewitch more people for much longer than he normally could." She explained in a distant voice.
"Just finished actually. It's why I was late. Spent the whole bloody afternoon in the library." Aria answered, grateful for the chance to divert everyone's attention to something else. "Were you all here on time?" She asked, glancing around the table and noting that most of them were halfway through their drinks and snacks.
boring!" He raged loudly, causing Aria's eyes to widen in alarm and Hannah to choke on her drink. "And just what the hell do you think is wrong with monogamy?!"
"I was assigned to clean classrooms with Abbott." Draco shrugged and lowered his gaze, examining his fingernails. "Not only do I
Unfortunately, as it turns out, his fun would prove to be short-lived because within a few minutes of Fisher recovering from their little stunt, the Beater
"Because of their keen sense of smell, vampires usually have the ability to sense another magical being if he or she is close enough. In fact, the stronger the vampire is, the bigger his sensory radius." She answered.
A few feet behind them, Aria met Hermione's exasperated expression and tried to stifle the grin that was itching to break out on her face. She and Hermione watched helplessly as Ron continued to argue with Headmistress McGonagall about the new housing arrangements the school board had made for their eighth year at Hogwarts.
"So if you could please just take enough time out of your busy schedule to get the fuck off your precious high horse and stop judging me – and that goes for
Zach ignored the tone of her voice and continued, a self-satisfied smile lingering on his face. "After graduation, I plan to become a professional quidditch player." He finished.
She didn't wait for any of them to answer before she went on, deliberately ignoring Blaise and Draco's warning glares.
With a long-suffering sigh, Hermione bent down so she could whisper the next words directly into Aria's ear.
Draco watched as Aria's green eyes went unnaturally wide at his words and all of the blood seemed to drain from her face. She stared at him for a long moment, her expression frozen with horror before she finally snapped out of her stupor and yanked herself away from him, her lips twisting into an angry sneer.
"We have heard alarming rumors that a lot of politically influential vampires are trying to convince the Wizengamot to lighten Fisher's sentence. Obviously, we don't want this to happen as it might set a dangerous precedent for other, similar cases involving veelas in the future. So in short, we want you, as the Girl-Who-Lived, to use your political influence and push back against them." She explained.
But then, Bentley Fisher happened and all hell had broken loose before Draco could try to understand what it meant.
Phew. This is my longest chapter to date for this story. I broke my own record lol. This'll probably be my peak though, the remaining ones (maybe about 10 more left) won't be nearly as long.
To his dismay, the girl was already stepping up onto the train entrance. When she heard him calling out to her, she stopped and turned around slowly, giving him another strange, knowing smile.
Zach snickered at her affronted expression. He stood back up and patted her mockingly on the shoulder.
"There's nothing wrong with Hufflepuff." Greg pointed out in such a strange tone of voice that both Blaise and Draco arched an eyebrow at him, causing him to redden slightly. "I—it's just that, Astoria told me that she just got resorted into Hufflepuff too." He added, sounding a little defensive.
Aria's cold green eyes glinted as they flicked over to where Pansy was sprawled out on the ground a few feet in front of where she stood. Pansy stiffened at Aria's vacant stare and began crawling away, digging frantically for something inside her purse. Before she could find whatever it was she was looking for, Pansy screamed as she was yanked forward through the air, her feet dangling above the ground as she flew straight into Aria's outstretched hand.
"S—sorry, Instructor. I meant no offense." Corner winced at the glares he received not only from his housemates but also from most of the female students in the room. He ducked his head behind his textbook and sank down low into his seat to hide his face.
to what was committed. I mean, the paint they used wasn't even permanent." She mused out loud, more to herself than anyone else.
Aria sidestepped them around a group of star-struck witches who had congregated near the hospital entrance to stare at her. She hesitated and stopped them a few feet in front of the doors.
Unfortunately, it was too much, and when Draco tried to thrust into her mouth, Aria's eyes snapped open and she ended up gagging and coughing as she yanked herself away.
"Huh?" Draco paused and gave her an irritated look. "What the bloody hell are you on about now, Scar-head?"
stuck doing detention this week! Did you not see that I had everything under control back there?! I didn't need you to come swooping in to rescue me!" Pansy shouted, her voice sounding clipped with barely restrained anger.
"Sorry, Potter. But we had an agreement after all." Blaise didn't even bother trying to hide the smirk on his face as he reached out and offered her a hand to help her stand up. "Shall we?"
"It was my fault." He reached up, tugging his goggles off so he could give her a sheepish grin that matched her own. "I was too busy avoiding the bludgers that I wasn't watching where I was going—"
Fleur was smirking as she shook her head and began coiling her long blonde hair back up into her hands.
Aria gave them both one last smile before she finally waved her hand over the fireplace, effecively ending the call. She made another dismissive gesture with her hand to negate the silencing charm she placed on herself. Afterwards, she stood up, folllowing Pansy over to where the short-haired girl was cautiously making her way to the bathroom door at the other end of the room.
"Is that so?" He couldn't help but arch his eyebrow higher at her, a small knowing grin beginning to curve the corner of his lips.
After they flew back out to the quidditch pitch and joined the rest of their teammates in the air, Zach's next words caused Aria, Blaise, and the rest of the team to gape at him in alarm.
When she parted her lips even more and welcomed his bold entry into her mouth, Draco hummed in delight.
Aria looked up again to find Draco watching her with a worried frown on his face. Before she could answer, he stood up, removing the expensive-looking black cloak from around his shoulders. He ignored her halfhearted protests and leaned down, draping the cloak snugly over her form.
At the sound of Draco's voice, Corey seemed to snap out of his trance. He blinked a couple of times and stared up at Draco in confusion. "What do you mean?" He asked dumbly.
A collective gasp echoed through the crowd, and the reporter who had spoken waited patiently for everyone's excited whispers to quiet down before she continued.
Sighing in relief, Aria closed her eyes and took a few long minutes to herself as she enjoyed the warm, relaxing water rinsing the sweat and grime from her skin. After washing her hair, she made sure to rinse her wings out as well, flapping them a few more times to dry out the white feathers.
As always, reviews, comments and kudos are love! Not much longer till we reach the resolution to this story. :D
"Shut it, Blaise." Draco cut him off sharply, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. He placed a heavy hand on Blaise's shoulder and gave it a hard squeeze. "Or I'll tell the Hufflepuffs that the reason they had to walk backwards during the NEWTs was because you switched their plates with the Gryffindors that day."
" Madam Pomfrey's eyes narrowed at the sheepish smile Aria gave her. "If this injury is what I think it is, then you may be here for awhile. So I think it's better if you tell me the truth right now." She paused and stared accusingly down at her.
"Yes he is." He frowned to himself, eyebrows fusing together in thought. "I should probably warn you. That bloody git is so ridiculously obsessed with you that it's downright
The warmth grew stronger and stronger; until it radiated into a bright, yellowish glow that erupted from his chest and spread out over the rest of his body. When the glow finally faded away, Draco realized what Aria had done, and his heart stopped. He looked down, staring at the veelish symbols of Aria's veela name that began magically inscribing themselves along the back of his wrist.
Pansy met the surprised look on Aria's face with wry smile. "And I only just realized that I never really thanked you properly for your help so...well, thank you. I suppose you're not all that bad after all.
out of my goddamn uniform, for Merlin's sake!" Aria snapped back angrily at her, shoving her hands away.
She giggled at his disgruntled expression and tugged on his arm again, pulling him further down the sidewalk until they finally neared one of Aria's favorite food carts parked along the side of the street.
She snatched the tiny slip of parchment from Blaise's outstretched hand, growled at him and stomped moodily out of the common room.
As soon as the white feather burst into green flames, Aria felt all of the veela blood in her veins ignite with magic.
And since he couldn't really ask Aria directly about it, Draco resigned himself to the fact that she probably wouldn't want him there anyway.
Before Aria could think of a coherent retort, one of his hands slid down, snaking between her legs to stroke a finger against her dripping wet folds. She let out an embarrassingly girlish squeal and instinctively tried to move her hips so as to feel more of his finger inside her; but Draco just smirked again and pulled his hand away, causing her to let out a strangled cry of frustration. She pulled him closer and leaned down, licking her way up his neck and throat before stopping to suck at a sensitive spot just below his jaw.
If that wasn't libelous enough, Skeeter also went on to report about how Aria probably developed some kind of 'attention-seeking' disorder as an after effect of the war; and not only did she crave the attention, but that sleeping around with a lot of men was apparently Aria's way to 'cope' with all of the trauma she experienced in her life. Skeeter then compared Aria's hedonistic behavior to a lot of other high-profile, celebrity veelas; and she even went as far as making a poorly-masked reference to 6th-time divorcee Ilyana Zabini. She ended her article with a detailed rant about how veelas were an absolute menace and how she thought all of them should be cast out of magical society altogether.
"I'm just telling you what I remember." Corey answered in a shaky voice, biting his lip and wrapping his arms around himself. "I remember Draco talking to me, then his eyes got all red and weird, and then, the next thing I remember, I was waking up in my bed and my housemates were telling me that I was being summoned to the Headmistress' office." He added miserably.
He ignored her embarrassed protests and yanked her legs apart, leaning down and pressing a reassuring kiss onto the skin of her inner thigh. Then, without warning, he bent down and slowly gave her a curious lick, pausing for a few seconds afterwards to gauge her reaction. When Aria bit her lip but otherwise made no move to stop him, he pressed his mouth closer and inhaled the heady scent of her.
He looked up and watched as Aria clutched at her head with her hands and fell weakly to her knees in front of him. With a manic, deranged look in her eyes, she yanked the gloves off her hands and reached both of them up to cup his face.
"Have you both signed up for any of the elective classes yet?" She asked as she began emptying the contents of her bag and spreading her textbooks, quills, ink bottles, parchments out on the ground.
Rita Skeeter stood up, a sarcastic smile on her face as she sashayed her way through the crowd until she was standing directly in front of Aria.
Aria waited until Draco saw Ron and Hermione dancing a couple of feet away from them; the newly wedded couple looking so blissfully in love and completely engrossed with each other that they obviously weren't aware anymore of anyone else around them.
"Civil Magical Relations...So...Laws that govern the relationships between wizards, veelas, vampires, werewolves, and all other magical creatures?" She chuckled when she saw the way Draco reddened at the amusement in her voice. "Do you really find us freaks that fascinating?"
seat end everyone else here knows that!" He added in a low, threatening growl, nearly running a hand through his hair in his frustration.
"How did that bastard even get her veela name?" Blaise growled out loud, clenching his fist. "He even had the blasted symbols tattooed on his arm, that freak—"
disclose is that...Well, to be honest, I haven't really acquainted myself with the full extent of my abilities as a veela just yet; and I still have a lot to learn about how my being a veela will change how I interact with the rest of magical society."
Molly and Arthur Weasley weren't actually horrible either, but Molly tended to smother Draco with too much food and Arthur kept asking him so many questions about the different fields of magical laws he's studied that Draco didn't really enjoy spending too much time with them either.
Blaise cursed under his breath but he obliged, reluctantly crouching down and placing his wand by his feet. Beside him, Draco's eyes narrowed and he began to crouch down slowly, pretending to lower his wand. When Fisher's gaze flickered, Draco sprang back to his feet and made a sharp, jabbing movement with his wand, hurling a powerful blinding jinx into Fisher's face.
"Well, no, she didn't exactly reject me." Draco relented, looking away with a weary, downhearted sigh. "But I'm pretty sure she doesn't trust me. And to be honest, after everything that's happened between us, maybe I can't really blame her."
The brown-haired Ravenclaw couldn't help stifling a smile at the misery she heard in her best friend's voice.
Before either Aria or Ron could react, the thick curtains to the left of Aria's bed were suddenly drawn back and Aria turned to her side, staring in shock at the sight of Hermione lying down in the hospital bed beside hers. She noticed the paler color of Hermione's cheeks, the eerie glow of her eyes, and the two sharp fangs in her mouth where her canines should be.
"On second thought." Draco winced and turned to Aria again, giving her a slightly sheepish look. "Maybe it's better if we wait the storm out for a bit. That is, of course, assuming you don't plan on us getting ourselves electrocuted by lightning?"
Curious, Draco pulled away from Aria and turned his head to look at them, frowning at the object they were waving around in their hands.
"Oh gods...Aria." Draco looked down at his hands, and his fingers trembled when he saw them covered with blood. "Come on, I'll take you to Madam Pomfrey—" His voice broke as he pulled her gently to her feet, only for Aria to let out another sharp cry of pain.
Once he was gone and the common room was left in sudden, uncomfortable silence, Blaise finally let out the snicker he had been holding in and turned to grin roguishly at Draco.
slowly, Draco fought the urge to groan and lifted his newly refilled glass of scotch to his mouth, steeling himself for the shit-show that he knew was about to come.
couldn't break free. Bentley continued to ignore her reaction, his blue eyes glowing inhumanly bright as he spoke.
"Go ahead then." Aria challenged, her eyes glinting as she smiled coldly at him and leaned back against her bed. "Reject me and let's get this whole thing over with."
Draco blinked at that and glanced at his watch. "Then we should probably get going too. We still need to run a few drills and go over our strategy before the game starts."
(much less endure his mother's incessant questions about when he was going to start looking for a girlfriend) but he had never really been one to deny his mother anything, so he begrudgingly agreed.
"You'd be surprised." Aria laughed, shaking her head. "Malfoy's changed a lot since the war. He's not the loud-mouthed, obnoxious git he used to be. Mostly, he's just quiet and keeps to himself now. To be honest, he's not
up." Aria huffed at him, but Draco could tell she wasn't really all that bothered because there was a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips. "And I still meant what I said, you know. I really do think we have a good team and that we have a solid chance at winning the championship." She told him.
sleep with any of the young men she mentioned; nor did I seduce any of them with my veela allure. And if any of you don't believe me, you can question me under veritaserum or you can talk to any of those mentioned, and they can confirm that I'm telling the truth."
possible." Wood answered her with a slow nod. "And it happens quite often, actually. In fact, a fixation can be
"Oh sorry! Was that you?" Hannah let out an embarrassed giggle, followed by a hiccup before she hastily withdrew her foot and ended up accidentally kicking the table, nearly causing all of their drinks to spill.
"Don't mind him so much, Potter." He cajoled lightly, ignoring the way Draco was glaring at the back of his head. "To be completely honest, I don't even think this is about you. Malfoy's just not in the best of moods right now because he spent all morning looking for this
suggest that Luca and Olivert did it." Morag told them in a nonchalant tone of voice. "We can't deny that."
well." Luna answered, looking amused at his reaction. "My father says it's because I was possessed by woodland spirits when I was a child. Woodland spirits are known to be incredibly skilled empaths, you know."
, not exactly." Draco acquiesced, frowning. "But I'm pretty sure that's the case. Aria never wanted a mate before all this. She's always made that perfectly clear to me from the very beginning."
"No! What just happened?! I ordered you to kill him! Why did you stop?!" Fisher blurted out as he staggered over towards them. "Why are you just sitting there?! You were supposed to do as I said!"
Instead, both sets of eyes lowered shyly to the floor. When Aria looked up again and gave him another hesitant smile, scuffling her shoes awkwardly against the grass, Draco made a decision.
Draco's scowl darkened as he watched Aria smile in greeting at the other boy. He strode towards them and knocked Aria's gloved hand away before Greg could take it.
"It's not just the house we've been thinking about though. There's also 'Mione's big internship this summer at the Ministry to consider." Ron added, wincing and giving Aria a weary smile. "I have to tell you, mate, I know we survived a war and all but I never would have thought that all this 'adulting' stuff that came afterwards would be much more difficult." He sighed.
"You heard me, Parkinson." Neville's lips twitched as he rolled his eyes and gave her another pointed look. "You know, for a Slytherin, you're surprisingly ignorant. I've been trying to give you all sorts of signals for
"That certainly worked out well, didn't it?" Blaise commented wryly as he tore his gaze away from Greg and Astoria and gave Aria a conspiratorial wink. "Why exactly didn't Greg confess to her sooner? Astoria would have chosen him over this grumpy guy
"I rather like it actually." He whispered, kissing her fingers. "It's like a battle scar; and it makes me look sexier. Don't you think?" He teased.
"No it grew out on its own." Aria answered with a nervous laugh, pointedly avoiding Luna's gaze. "But that's fine, I've always wanted to have long hair, and I figured since the weather was getting cold anyway, now would be the perfect time to do it." She noticed that both Ron and Hermione had looked up and met her eyes but thankfully, neither of her two best friends said anything.
She waited until Draco acknowledged her with a friendly, albeit slightly confused look before she took a deep breath and continued, her eyes dropping shyly to the floor. "I er…I know this is a bit unorthodox, with the girl asking the guy and all, but I was hoping…Well, if you're not already going with someone that is, I was wondering if—"
As they trekked back up the stone path leading towards the castle, Draco noticed the way Aria kept glancing at him from the corner of her eye. When they reached the bottom of the steps that led directly to the castle entrance, Aria stopped and finally turned around to face him.
Draco took a deep inhale of breath to calm himself down before reaching up to massage his temples in frustration.
"It won't work anymore." Pansy spoke up from where she was trying to rouse Neville's unconscious form awake on her lap. She gave Fisher a mocking sneer. "She obviously broke the curse."
With all the feigned indifference of a true, well-bred pureblooded wizard, Blaise turned around and simply gave him a calm, perfectly composed smile.
"Aria, get away from him." Draco looked up at the moon above their heads. "It's the vampire moon. He's strong, too strong—"
Much to Aria's distress, Draco gritted his teeth and stilled again, suddenly pulling himself back out of her and pausing to catch his breath. Her eyes immediately snapped open and she growled up at him in frustration.
Draco scowled and shook his head at his own thoughts, withdrawing his gaze from Aria to glare accusingly at his hands.
Aria tried not to wince as she followed Draco up the sloping path from Hogsmeade on their way back to Hogwarts.
"Here are our class schedules and chore assignments for the week. I would have handed it to you earlier but apparently, you couldn't be bothered from your beauty sleep this morning." She said snidely.
When she nodded at him in understanding, he slanted his eyes over to hers again and gave her a curious look.
At his words, the uncertainty on Pansy's face finally began to clear away and she smiled back slowly at him, nodding.
"Malfoy knows, Malfoy doesn't know, does it really matter at this point?! It's not like we can keep hiding this secret of yours from everyone forever! Is this really that much of a big deal to you?!" She demanded.
as I was expecting it to be." Pansy flushed, coughing slightly and clearing her throat. "I certainly wasn't expecting
The language had sounded too foreign; the accent and intonation of the syllables so unique and unfamiliar to his ears that no matter how hard Draco tried to recreate the sounds, he couldn't enunciate her name the same way she had whispered it to him – at least not without actually reading up on Ancient Veelish first.
Her wings flared out again, the feathery appendages trembling as Draco reached out, reverently caressing the soft feathers along one wing with his fingers. When he began tracing the outer edges of her left wing, Aria shivered. He bent his head, placing a soothing kiss onto her bare shoulder.
Aria smiled at the thought, her gaze soft as they lingered on Draco's features. When he ducked his head and blushed under her stare, Aria hastily tore her eyes away and fidgeted with her hands.
When it looked as though both of her best friends barely seemed to have heard her and she recognized the tell-tale signs of another famous Ron - Hermione argument about to erupt, Aria shoved her things back into her bag and hastily made her way back towards the castle
"Draco's already on the Ministry's probationary watch list right now; having something like this on his record could reflect very
"I'm afraid that is a subject I will have to set aside for next week, as it is quite a lengthy and complicated discussion." She told them, smiling when she saw their looks of disappointment.
Estelle noticed his anxious grimace and left, still chuckling to herself as she proceeded down the hallway to begin her rounds. Unfortunately, Lewis picked up on where she had left off and continued to give Draco a serious look.
Having grown somewhat accustomed to dealing with the press that summer, Aria was careful to keep her expression completely neutral as she entered the Great Hall that morning.
She didn't voice her thoughts out but the tension on her face must have given her away because Bentley was smirking at her. He spoke again, drawing Aria's attention back to the triumphant look in his eyes.
Draco clenched his jaw and both of his hands automatically tightened into angry fists but he kept silent, refusing to take the bait. Beside him, Corey's eyes had grown as wide as saucers and he was glancing back and forth between the two older boys with a look of worried trepidation on his face.
"How wonderful for you, Hermione." Aria drawled sarcastically, not bothering to hide her irritation at the way Hermione's voice suddenly took on a high-pitched, 'cooing' tone at the mention of her cat.
Smirking at the former Gryffindor's confused expression, Draco was just about to answer him when, as they rounded the corner, a small group of nervous-looking students who had gathered around the entrance to the Great Hall suddenly caught their attention.
Sadly, Draco had no more leads to follow at that point – no hint of an address, no background, not even her bloody name.
Had Aria not just bit into another treacle tart, she would have argued against them; but before she could complain, Draco snatched her fork away and finished the rest of her treacle tart in one bite.
Aria glared back menacingly at him, and she raised her hand, hovering it directly in front of Draco's chest until a wave of powerful magic exploded from her palm, blasting Draco, Blaise and Pansy backwards in three separate directions.
find it, actually." Blaise answered wryly, smirking to himself. "But for some reason, she knew right away that it was meant for Aria and that I was just keeping it for you."
"They're veela names, Instructor. Actually, to be more specific, they're four notorious veelas whose names are often mentioned in a lot of our history textbooks." Pansy explained.
Fleur's comment just now (which she probably meant as a joke) but still, it was definitely something worth considering.
They finally reached the ground and Draco lowered them both gently, but when Aria made a move to separate herself from him, his grip tightened around her and he scooped her up into his arms instead, planting his feet firmly onto the grass.
"That is—I uh…" She managed a nervous laugh and shrugged, brushing a wayward lock of her black hair away from her face. "I didn't mean that—I wasn't judging you for your actions or anything that happened during the war." She lowered her gaze, drawing his attention to the lovely long lashes that framed her eyes.
Despite her screams, Aria's entire form was jerked upwards, as though propelled by some kind of invisible force, until she was back up on her feet. Draco paled and took a step back, watching as the expression on her face shuttered and her gaze became empty once more. She twitched her fingers and summoned her wand back to her hand before slowly turning her attention to him.
Pansy's left eye twitched at her jibe but she didn't take the bait, watching as Aria finished with her hair and walked back over to the windows to resume her cleaning.
Aria purposely avoided looking at Malfoy as she answered. "I'll admit, I'm still getting used to how you lot all seem so proper and disciplined compared to the Gryffindors but I do like the fact that the dungeons are
I though the sorting hat was pulling my leg back then!" He grumbled as he glanced back up, his eyes widening slightly when he and Aria locked gazes and he saw the similar colors displayed on her robes.
Draco didn't answer him, the expression on his face still tense as a strange feeling of foreboding continued to linger in his chest.
"We shouldn't even be doing this here anyway. Even if nobody comes down here, I still feel a little self-conscious having all of these house-elves around us." Aria pointed out, rolling her eyes when Draco just chuckled at her words and pulled her close again.
He started painfully slow, setting himself into a controlled pace as he pressed her down into the sheets and buried himself deep and rhythmically into her body. She arched her hips and tightened her legs around him to pull him closer, closing her eyes in pure bliss as her hands clutched tightly around his taut shoulders.
One thing was for certain. After everything Aria had been through in her life, she had absolutely no intention of being another unfortunate casualty to something like that.
Blaise let out a dramatic sigh and spoke up in a pretentious drawl from where he sat beside Aria. "You do realize that it's not that simple right? Clearly, you're forgetting about the politics of it all. The Ministry deciding about what to do with a vampire like Bentley Fisher could have significant repercussions among the vampire community. Not to mention the fact that, deciding
Aria finally looked up from her DADA textbook and stared at the three girls with a dumbfounded look on her face.
Once they reached the entrance to the castle and finally began making their way to the dungeons, Aria spoke up again in a soft, nonchalant tone of voice.
the one responsible for making the savior of the wizarding world join the Slytherin quidditch team! Are you blackmailing her somehow?! Or bullying her into it?! How
Her words seemed to be enough to reassure him, because the uneasiness on Draco's face vanished and he leaned back against his seat. Then, with a decidedly, feral grin, he beckoned her towards him and patted his lap again.
that first time." She gave Pansy a pointed look, suddenly calling to mind how she had suspected Pansy as being responsible for the first incident. Then, she frowned and glanced over Pansy's shoulder to stare at Blaise.
"I'd really like to get through our first potion together without setting off any explosions." He quipped.
...towards men, tend to cause tension and strife wherever they go. Wouldn't you agree?" She smiled sweetly.
He ignored the way her lips twitched with laughter as he pushed past her and all but ran, as fast he could, through the small herd of hippogriffs until he reached the other side of the clearing. When he got there, discreetly breathing out a sigh of relief, he scowled again when he saw Aria smirking at him, one of her eyebrows arched as she took in his disgruntled appearance.
" Firenze clarified as his gaze flicked back to Aria, oblivious to the way Draco blanched and seemed to shrink at his words. "I remember seeing him among their ranks. He was a supporter of the Dark One."
His two companions looked up at him in surprise, their attentions from each other momentarily diverted.
that. The icy tension between them now was becoming unbearable, and it was obviously palpable enough to their housemates that it made Pansy and Neville's little cold war at the start of the year look like child's play.
Draco deliberately ignored Zach's pathetic attempts to protest and continued, glancing to his left and nodding in acknowledgment at the two bulkiest members of their team. "Our beaters will be Harper Edgeworth and Graham Pritchard."
At his words, Aria's cheeks flushed slightly in embarrassment. "How the hell did you know about that?!"
Eventually, she found Draco, Blaise, and Morag sitting around a table near the windows and strode over to them, all the while continuing to ignore the flashing cameras and the trail of hushed whispers that followed her across the room. Like her, Draco and Blaise were already wearing their quidditch uniforms; both boys unusually reserved as they struggled to ignore the attention of the many reporters who continued to watch them.
"Hermione, of course." Aria smirked at her and gave her a look as though she thought the answer to her question was so glaringly obvious. "She helped me dig through some really old family records during the summer."
Grinning widely, Blaise looked as though he was about to answer her when another familiar voice behind them suddenly spoke, causing everyone around the table to glance up and stare in shock at the person approaching.
than I would have expected from you." Draco murmured into her neck, causing Aria to shiver at the touch of his lips against her skin. "Based on the design, I'd say this place cost a lot. I actually even think it's more expensive than my flat." He mused, chuckling.
Draco couldn't bring himself to look at her as he answered, his face white as he stared intently at the words written across the doors.
the fact that people went out of their way to avoid her now instead of crowding around her, but it was a little unsettling. Just the other day, while she had been on her way to the library, she had accidentally bumped into a Hufflepuff first year, sending the younger student sprawling to the ground.
"It's a Slytherin thing, trust me. There is no such thing as a good deed that doesn't need to be repaid." Aria cut him off with a firm shake of her head. "And I don't want that. Things are already so
Draco paused briefly and Aria followed his gaze to the handsome, dark-haired boy to his right. When he noticed her looking at him, Austin reddened but he greeted her with a friendly smile, causing Aria to blink and smile back hesitantly at him in return. If Draco noticed this little exchange between them, he didn't say anything - though his mouth twisted slightly into a sneer.
" Blaise answered, giving her an obnoxious wink. "I promise to keep your secret for as long as I continue to be entertained by your ridiculously inept efforts in trying to hide it." He ignored the furious glare she shot him and started working on another stack of wet dishes.
"Aria, I think your skirt may have snagged onto something when you bumped into that table. Look." She pointed out the very noticeable rip that ran down the length of Aria's skirt, inadvertently exposing an indecent amount of the smooth white skin of her legs.
Shaking his head, he averted his gaze and gestured vaguely to his own mouth. "Draco, you have a little bit of something on your er—" He cut himself off, unsure of how to continue, and glanced at Pansy for help.
He pressed his lips insistently against hers, obviously trying to get her to submit, until Aria relented and let him push her down onto the bed. She fell back against the pillows and wrapped her legs invitingly around his waist, grinding herself up against his erection until Draco growled and grabbed her hips to keep her still. He ignored her frustrated whimper and nibbled playfully at her ear before he leaned in close to whisper in a dangerous voice.
"I'm just saying." Aria laughed and held both of her hands up at them in a gesture of surrender. "You're in Paris! City of Love, and all that rubbish. Go and have fun. But not
It didn't help his mood that when he returned to Hogwarts later that afternoon to spend some time alone in the library, he was joined by an unwelcome pair – Greg Goyle and Astoria Greengrass.
Since he was seated on the other end of the table, Draco didn't hear much of their hushed conversation but judging from the nervous way the Ravenclaw kept stammering his words, Draco guessed that the pathetic simp was probably attempting to ask Aria to the Yule Ball — and from the politely disinterested tone of Aria's voice, Draco could also guess that she was probably turning him down. Eventually, the Ravenclaw boy walked away, dejected, and Aria turned back to her books, pretending not to notice the curious looks she was receiving from the other students occupying some of the nearby tables.
"Oh you know." Through no control of her own, Aria's eyes darkened and she felt the amusement on her face begin to drain away as she considered the answer to Pansy's question. "The muggle relatives who used to starve me, the evil bitch who killed my godfather and tortured my best friend, the disgusting, two-faced rat who sold my parents out, oh and let's not forget
For a second, he actually considered the possibility that it may have all just been a dream. He was terrified that the minute he woke up, he would find himself all alone in his bed just like he always did for the past few days.
She remembered all of her awkward encounters with Draco in the Slytherin Common Room, and how he walked away from her every time she tried to approach him, pretending as though nothing had happened between them.
to follow Madam Pomfrey's instructions anyway), Aria reluctantly leaned back against the pillows of her bed and slowly began to untwist her hair from its braid. Then, she took a long inhale of breath and closed her eyes. There was a brief, albeit very bright yellowish glow that wrapped around her entire form, causing Madam Pomfrey, Ron and Hermione to shield their eyes for a few seconds before the light instantly faded and all three of them opened their eyes again.
Draco didn't protest at that and soon, all three of them were quietly making their way down the stands.
Eventually, it was Aria who broke the spell first as she suddenly flinched and yanked her arm away from his grasp as though he had stung her, causing Draco to blink and move away.
As everyone broke out into loud cheers and applause, a happily glowing Ron and Hermione slowly made their way over to the very center of the reception area. The lights around them dimmed, and the spotlight shifted to focus directly on the newly married couple, illuminating their slow, romantic waltz along the dance floor.
Zach tried to glare at him, though it didn't really have its desired effect given the way he was squinting drunkenly at the other Slytherin.
He nodded wordlessly; and after a few minutes of awkward silence between them, the last few notes of the song they had been waltzing to finally faded out and they quietly began making their way back to their seats. As soon as they sat down, Greg turned to her and gave her a small, uncertain smile.
"This year is so much fun. Last week, it was you and Aria. This week, Pansy and Neville." He smirked at the irritated look on his friend's face and turned to give the rest of his housemates a playful wink.
"No, that's okay. I ate breakfast early." Neville gave her another smile before he turned to go, but not before giving Aria and the rest of their housemates a friendly wave. "See you in class, you lot."
The next morning, Aria was very careful not to let the amusement on her face show as she and Pansy entered the Great Hall together and made their way over to the Slytherin table.
As Aria remained silent and continued to lose herself in her thoughts, Hermione studied her closely and her brown eyes slowly began to dawn in understanding.
Aria felt the lingering stares of her housemates on her, obviously waiting for her reaction to Ron's statement but the throbbing in her head was beginning to intensify; and frankly, she was still too exhausted to think properly about everything that happened.
Aria laughed and leaned up again, interrupting his panicked barrage of questions by giving him a kiss on the cheek. She eventually pulled away and pressed the envelope encouragingly into his hands.
When he recognized her from several yards away, Bentley's eyes suddenly widened and a wide, ecstatic smile broke out onto his face. Oblivious to the dismayed look on Aria's face, he nearly knocked his friend over in his haste to reach her, scrambling across the remaining distance between them.
to Malfoy and Zabini all the time, you're suddenly too good to be associating with me now? You shouldn't think so highly of yourself, sweetheart. You're not that special." Corner mocked in a loud, sarcastic tone of voice.
Frowning, she and Draco slowly detached themselves from Neville and all three of them began to approach the group cautiously, taking in the strange expressions on everyone's face. When they reached the crowd, they were surprised to see Blaise, Morag, Hannah and Zach among the students who had gathered near the entrance, all four Slytherins frozen with shock.
"You look gorgeous, honey." Pansy rolled her eyes again, shooting a warning glare at Blaise and Zach when she saw how the two weren't even bothering to hide their snickers anymore. "Now come on, let's get going."
a virgin. Here, you need to drink some more of this." He ignored the glare she gave him and shoved another shot glass of firewhiskey towards her. "Go on then. Who's the lucky bloke who fires up your loins?" Blaise waggled his eyebrows up and down at her, causing Aria to make a disgusted face and everyone else to burst into drunken snickers.
Aria cast another worried look at Draco from the corner of her eye, biting her lip when she realized that the blond had finally stopped blushing and was now glaring accusingly at her and Blaise with a knowing scowl on his face.
"I know." Aria nodded in understanding and urged him to continue. "They're dating, right? He wrote to me a few days ago about it. I'm happy for him, you know. Angie's always been a good friend of his and she knows him
Draco chuckled but he didn't say anything as they eventually fell into another comfortable silence, both Slytherins taking great care not to wake Neville as they dragged him along.
"Well it was the only comfy seat left when I arrived! Everywhere else was full when I got here! Where else am I supposed to take a nap?" Potter complained with a scowl.
When Greg blinked and gaped at her, obviously not expecting her answer, Aria arched an eyebrow and gave him a teasing smirk. "Assuming, of course, that was what you were going to ask." She added playfully.
her since their afternoon together in the Forbidden Forest a few days ago, and other than the few times they'd been forced to participate in group conversations with their housemates, they hadn't spoken a single word to each other. Granted, they didn't fight or verbally antagonize each other the way they used to, but Aria realized that she would have actually
seen her annoyingly often that summer. Apparently, the flat he had purchased in London was near her house so it was unavoidable that they bump into each other pretty often. And he
"I'm curious, Instructor." Morag spoke up again, raising her hand. "If cutting off her wings basically 'frees' a veela from all these complications, why don't most veelas just do so? Cut off their wings, I mean?" She pointed out, looking confused.
"Demelza Robbins." Zach answered him just as Blaise (who looked annoyingly immaculate in an expensive set of black and gray dress robes) strode into the room.
Draco failed to catch the look of stunned surprise on both Blaise and Pansy's faces when he just took the letter from her hand and, instead of rushing to open it immediately like he usually did, he stuffed the small envelope distractedly into the pocket of his robes. When he glanced up at them again, he was a little confused at the way Blaise and Pansy continued to stare at him as though he had just confessed to being a squib.
Across the room, Aria winced when she saw how Pansy and Romilda Vane were barely able to keep from scratching each other's eyes out as they argued over which ingredients were supposed to go into the potion first. Behind them, Morag and a Hufflepuff girl named Susan Bones didn't look to be better off, both girls glaring daggers at each other as they fought over the weighing scale. Draco, on the other hand, was mostly working on his potion alone because his partner – a shy Gryffindor girl named Eloise Midgen – looked far too busy blushing and staring at him instead of actually helping him out.
"Besides, like I said, I haven't told anyone else about your little secret. And I won't – for as long as it continues to be in my best interest to do so, at least."
" Draco snapped angrily at her, his eyes flashing as he looked up and silenced the rest of her words with an infuriated glare. "You don't owe me any apologies, Potter!" He sneered.
"You say that like I actually give a shit about what other people will say about me." Aria retorted snidely as she glanced up and pointed her wand at the ceiling, silently casting a charm to get rid of all the residual dust and spiderwebs. "Get some new material, Parkinson."
"That's much better." She knelt down onto the ground beside the fire and began untangling her long, drenched hair from her braid.
"It's not like those sods in high positions in the Ministry weren't guilty of associating with Voldemort themselves." Ron snorted.
this week." Aria argued with an exasperated sigh as she slammed her thick potions textbook shut and gave him a pleading look. "Blaise, I have
She sneered, lifting her eyes and meeting Pansy's uncomfortable gaze with her own. After another long moment of tense, awkward silence, Pansy swallowed and spoke up again in a stubbornly defiant voice.
At the soft, comforting tone of Narcissa's voice, Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and forced himself to speak.
She didn't say anything else, but judging from the smirk he gave her in return, she knew Blaise was aware of what she was thanking him for. Frankly, if Blaise hadn't cut in to draw everyone else's attention from her and Draco the way he did, Aria was certain that the blond Slytherin would have continued asking her even more strange questions about her hair.
Draco ignored her comment and continued to watch her silently, his gray eyes soft as they roamed over her face, her hair, before his gaze lowered and he stared shamelessly at her scantily-clad body. When Aria just rolled her eyes at him and turned away, flopping sleepily back onto the bed, Draco chuckled. He leaned back against his chair and patted his lap in invitation.
Blaise sounded bored as he sauntered over to the Slytherin table, yawning as he plopped down into his usual seat. He ignored the irritated look Draco gave him and scooted over the bench, helping himself to a cup of tea. When Draco just grunted at him in reply, Blaise took a long sip from his cup and glanced down at Draco's blank parchment again.
whole seconds, while I ask you for a kiss." Morag told her, blinking once before giving Aria a calm, completely unfazed smile.
Unfortunately, Skeeter had delivered on her promise to tarnish Aria's reputation; and this time, the veela community had shared the brunt of her latest 'journalistic' endeavors. It was, by far, the
A part of Aria was almost convinced that the sorting hat was just a crazy old piece of junk pulling all their legs and sorting everyone into the most random houses just for a good laugh.
Her long black hair was tousled and lay delightfully tangled, all over the pillows above her head. Her perfect veela skin was all flushed and pink, no longer unblemished as he counted all of the bites from his teeth and the tiny little bruises from his hands.
Aria paused in the middle of wiping down one of the desks and glanced at Pansy in mild annoyance. "You certainly weren't lying when you said you did your research."
It has been my great pleasure being your Instructor. I look forward to meeting you all outside of Hogwarts after you graduate."
By the end of the day, as Draco was making his way out of the crowded elevator back into the Ministry's atrium, he stopped when he caught sight of the massive assembly of reporters sitting around the fountain in the very center of the hall. From the excited reactions of the other Ministry visitors who happened to pass by, it wasn't hard for Draco to guess who everyone was staring at.
Looking up, Aria felt all of the blood drain from her face when she saw the way the other girl had dropped the mop in her hand and was now staring intently at her hair with a completely bewildered look on her face.
okay?!" Zach hissed hysterically at her, wincing again and taking a long swig from his bottle of water. "I was just spewing hot air when I told you all that stuff about quidditch! I'm bloody terrible at it, alright?! Always have been! The only reason I got into this team was because my dad blackmailed Slughorn to let me join—"
It took Draco a few more seconds to come to terms with everything she actually said; but when he did, he frowned to himself and sighed. "You don't need to worry about any of that. I'm not Aria's mate anyway, and I don't really think she intends to change that anytime soon."
"Seriously, Abbott." Zach began wheezing with laughter at her reaction. "Tell us the truth. Are you actually a promiscuous little flirt under that innocent, virginal mask of yours? Please don't tell me you're just as horny as Morag."
"The trick is to look at the argument from Aria's point of view, darling." She spoke in a calm, soothing voice. "Think about it. Aria can never mate with anyone else ever again. You are 'it' for her; and unless she decides to sever the connection by cutting off her wings, she's bound to you for the rest of her life."
To his confusion, Narcissa's features softened and she answered him with a fond smile. "She was probably just overwhelmed by it all. And to be honest, I can't really blame her. I mean, you do realize the significance of this whole thing to a veela, don't you?"
Instead, she was wearing a long coat over a green turtle-neck dress that hugged her svelte figure perfectly, ending a few inches above her knees. As Draco gulped and unwittingly allowed his eyes to trail down, he noticed that she was wearing black tights underneath her dress, along with a pair of knee-high boots that matched the same tan color of the gloves on her hands.
It might have been Aria's imagination, but she could have sworn she saw McGonagall's lips twitch very briefly into a fond smile at her words.
"This is ridiculous." Draco growled under his breath, running a hand through his unusually disheveled blond hair. "Some asshole is obviously trying to pin this on us and isn't even bothering to be discreet about it." He snapped.
Blaise just arched an eyebrow at her, obviously amused by her reaction, but before he could do anything else, Draco surprised them both when he suddenly slipped out from behind the bookshelves. He sauntered lazily over to them, crouching down against the table opposite Blaise and imitating his position by leaning into Morag from behind, effectively sandwiching her in between them.
makes sense." Aria muttered her breath. "But I don't think he did this using an Imperius Curse though. If this guy is only going after
"It didn't ask me anything, to be honest." Aria admitted, trying not to react when she saw the surprise on their faces. "It just told me that I'd do well in Slytherin. But by then, I was already decided on Gryffindor so I told the hat to put me there instead." She finished.
"Alright, alright. I'm coming." Blaise quipped back as he grabbed his bag before turning to give Aria and Neville one last wink.
The voice Malfoy had used to speak with was soft but it apparently rang with enough authority that Pansy immediately backed off with a displeased scowl, looking annoyed but repentant for her actions. When she didn't say anything else, Malfoy turned, ignoring Aria's surprised expression, and gave Zabini an impatient look.
"Will you both just stop it?!" Aria interrupted angrily, green eyes flashing as she stormed over toward them and placed herself directly in the middle of the two boys. "Look, this is getting completely out of hand. Draco, Bentley…Both of you just…
." Pansy interrupted them, looking annoyed at their banter. "If this jerk was trying to frame Draco this time, shouldn't we tell him about this?" She pointed out.
"Weren't you going up there? Can you get lost now, Potter?" He snapped, desperate to change the subject as he glanced down and noted that she wasn't carrying any bag or letter with her.
"It's nothing." She removed her gloves and placed one hand on top of the one he had inside her shirt, her fingers tracing the back of his palm. "I was just lost in thought."
He tucked the letter away, suddenly angry with himself for letting the entire situation drag on for as long as it did.
Blaise suddenly broke him out of his thoughts when he plopped down onto the seat beside him and gave him a nudge to the side. Meanwhile, Pansy remained standing and stood in front of them, staring Draco down with a questioning look on her face.
As Aria's sharp, veela claws closed tightly around her throat, Pansy wheezed for breath and she struggled desperately to break free. In spite of Pansy's efforts, Aria just lifted her up and slammed her violently against the trunk of the tall tree behind her.
Just as Draco pulled away and was about to return his attention to Aria's mouth, the loud sound of a door violently slamming shut startled them both, and they pulled away from each other in alarm. Glancing across the room, they stared in confusion at the kitchen doors which, Draco distinctly remembered, had been wide open just a few minutes ago.
Despite herself, Aria noticed the lingering bitterness in Zach's voice and reached out, placing a gloved hand on his shoulder. "I'm not sure if anyone else has asked you this already but I'll ask anyway. And no, you don't have to answer if you don't want to."
"Anyway, I'll leave you two to it then." Pansy waited until Aria nodded at her before she gave Corey's shoulder one last squeeze and then excused herself, walking out of the empty classroom and closing the door quietly behind her.
for my condition and so long as I don't overexert myself and get enough rest, it should be fine." He explained.
She rushed into his arms, linking her hands around his neck and greeting him with a warm, eager kiss on the lips.
"What, would you rather I was some kind of unrefined cad?" Draco retorted sarcastically as he glanced at her from the corner of his eye.
Aria blinked a couple of times, and Draco felt a sickening rush of dread when he saw the way her expression suddenly grew cold and guarded.
Aria froze again, but instead of pulling her hand away, she glanced at him over her shoulder and gave him a dark look instead. "Didn't I warn you before about touching me without my consent?" She drawled.
Lastly, she remembered her DADA tutoring session with Corey that weekend. Not surprisingly, even the younger Slytherin had noticed her absent-mindedness, but that was probably because he kept having to shout at Aria to
Draco noticed that Neville and Greg were among the 8th years who were running around, struggling desperately to keep the fiendfyre under control.
He leaned over her, raising one of his hands and letting it hover over her skin in a ghost of a caress — not quite close enough to actually touch her, but apparently close enough that Aria felt it through their mate bond anyway. Her pale, creamy skin positively glowed everywhere his hand lingered, and each time a spark of pleasure ran through her, he felt it too — and it was magnifying his desire for her to unprecedented levels.
"Alright, so I lied." Draco admitted, rolling his eyes and giving her a sheepish look. "I actually know nothing about architecture. I just made that rubbish up as an excuse to go with you."
“Well I guess I can trust you to Floo them back to Hogwarts safely tomorrow morning?” Harry jokes, wanting to keep the mood light.
"Normally I wouldn't dare leave you with such a task," he says to Harry, "but I'm sure Draco will make sure it's brewed properly." Harry is furious, but not wanting to lose any more points, he bites his anger back. Then Snape turns to Malfoy.
"Of course," he says, "you're not to do all the work. Just stop him from making a mess out of it." Malfoy laughs, and Harry walks away, fuming.
But he knows he can't have that. Not until the war is over, anyway. However, that doesn't stop his heart from beating a little faster when his hands just moments later are touching Draco's as Harry's trying to take back the wands from Draco's grip. It's barely even a struggle, really, Draco is pretty much handing them to Harry. He lets his fingertips stay on Draco's skin for just the blink of an eye, trying to channel as much comfort as he can into that one, small touch.
"It's okay," Harry replies quickly, not wanting him to stop talking. "I'm not going to tell anyone if you don't want me to. I'll just listen."
Perhaps he could even have joined Harry and the others on their mission to hunt Horcruxes. Of course that would have been dangerous as well, but Harry would have been able to be there for him, to protect him. To hold him, hug him, kiss him...
"Sorry," Harry mutters and takes out his wand to gather the scattered bean pieces back in his hands.
I'm working and studying and battling depression still so it's been kind of hard to find the time to write. I have also recently moved so that's taken up some time as well. Hope you like the new chapter, feel free to give me feedback even if it's negative!!
"What?" Harry is confused for a moment. Is she talking about Cho Chang? Sure, she's pretty and sure Harry's noticed her, but -
will be with him. The two of them were getting into a quarrel outside of the Great Hall after Harry heard Malfoy loudly singing
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco pauses for a bit, frowning as he appears to consider whether he should say something else or not. “I, um, I just wondered if I could tell you one more thing about Astoria?” He’s fiddling with the sleeves of his jacket, as he looks nervously at Harry.
ok so harry's description of draco in this chapter is basically word for word stolen from the book, which first of all credit to j.k. and second of all it kind of proves how canon this shit really is when i'm able to use unedited content for a fanfic about their love. js. i mean. not that the description is erotic or anything but just the fact that he noticed. and tbh the words are so fucking sad they can't have been thought by harry in like a matter-of-factly way
The word about Ginny and Harry is spreading fast through the castle, and he can't help but notice a distance growing between himself and Draco Malfoy. It pains him. He really likes Ginny, and he doesn't want to feel guilty because of it. Ginny is fun. Her smile is bright, her energy matches his own, and she makes him smile. And there is no sneaking around necessary.
There are tears in Draco’s eyes now, and Harry sits as frozen in the chair listening intently to every word coming out of his mouth. This is not at all what Harry would have expected to hear. But Draco goes on:
Once up in the air Harry starts scanning the room from above, frantically trying to see where the diadem went in all the turmoil caused by the fire. Knowing his priority must be to defeat Voldemort, even though his eyes are desperately trying to find not only the diadem but also a certain blond boy lost among the flames, the thick smoke and the enormous piles of furniture and discarded things.
"I haven't got any options!" Draco exclaims, pulling Harry out of his thoughts. "I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!"
Harry immediately turns around at the sound of Draco's familiar voice. He's glad to see Draco is still alive, but now isn't exactly the ideal time for a reunion. Especially considering both Crabbe and Goyle are here, too, pointing their wands at him along with Draco. Harry needs to find Ravenclaw's lost diadem and defeat Voldemort. And he doesn't have much time.
"Fuck off," Malfoy snaps at him, but Harry doesn't mind; he's eager, too. In a moment their robes are on the floor, and their trousers around their ankles, as Harry fucks Malfoy against the wall.
“I never should have told you that story,” Harry tries to give Draco an angry look, and hits him playfully on the arm before bursting out in laughter. Draco joins him, and Harry is thinking that it was a long time since it had been this easy between them, if ever. Draco even looks happy, relaxed, less reserved than usual. Maybe they could become friends again. Maybe.
Once he's outside the bathroom he presses his ear against the door. He can't hear anything. Very quietly he pushes the door open to reveal Malfoy's back across the bathroom. His hands are clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed and his whole body shaking.
"I- I need to talk to Ginny," he manages to stutter out in a shaky voice. He sees Draco's face fall, but he can't think about that now. "Goodbye," he says and rushes out of the café.
Harry shakes his head, oblivious, too preoccupied with sorting out the mess in his head to be able to deduct any new information on his own.
“I think I will manage.” Draco smirks before adding: “That is, of course, unless Albus has inherited your inability to speak clearly. But that is something you can’t blame me for!”
