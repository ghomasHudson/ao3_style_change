“I’m not—”
It’s always the same with them: Hermione, ever the analytical researcher, is quick to look at the situation objectively, trying her best to understand and asking a hundred and one questions on her way. Once presented with enough facts and relevant arguments, she usually has no trouble accepting the truth and starts trying to make the best of it. Ron, on the other hand, is all feelings and action, quick to judge and stubborn as all hell. Once he’s drawn his rash conclusions, right or wrong, he’s hard to convince otherwise. Plus, he can hold a grudge like no other.
“I— Sorry, I shouldn’t have…” Harry gave him a sheepish smile. “Just, you know, in my head, eleven-year-old you is still a cocky little bastard with too much confidence for his own good. Homesick and insecure doesn’t really compute with that.”
“Merry Christmas, Draco.”
Can’t really see who’d be interested in marrying you, tho, but I’m sure there must be someone out there for you, just waiting to be swept off their feet by you’re unparalleled charm and scatting wit. At least
Divination had never been Draco’s strong suit, however, and when the bell attached to the door jingled the next day to announce not reporters, nor Aurors, but the man and his friend, Draco could only hope no one caught the surprise threatening to overtake his features.
And just because someone belonged to the winning side didn’t mean they were a saint either. Many zealous supporters of the Light had made it their mission to rid the world of anyone who had ever followed Voldemort, regardless of the Wizengamot’s — far too lenient, according to some — rulings, and Harry was reluctantly grateful for Draco’s festive disguise which made him unrecognisable to anyone who wasn’t already aware of his identity.
PS You? Dance? With that stiff posture of yours that makes it look like you have a stick up your arse 24/7? Please forgive my scepticism, but I really can’t see it. Maybe you’ll just have to show me sometime. Not that I’m any good at it or anything; I couldn’t dance if my life depended on it. Whenever I try, my body simply refuses to cooperate and I only end up feeling awkward and thoroughly embarrassed. So, no, there’ll be no dance floor at any party of mine if I can help it. But I can assure you there are lots of other ways to have fun.
“Er… Sure,” he said, not that there’d ever been any question about it. Mentally, Harry had been outside ever since Goyle first mentioned the snow.
Charlie cocked his head, a gentle smile on his face. “That’s a nice way to think about it. Thank you.”
And this infernal pull is getting bloody annoying.
With his lips against Harry's nape and Harry straddling his lap, Draco slowly eases Harry back down onto his cock.
His trunk was already packed, filled to the brim with his new school robes and textbooks and clothes and as many sweets as he’d been able to sneak out of the pantry without getting caught. He still hadn’t decided whether he should dare to bring Fayette along too. Father had said big boys don’t sleep with plush animals, and Draco really didn’t want to have anyone making fun of him over his ragged green dragon that had surely seen better days, but…
Instead, here he was, sitting alone at his Louis XIV desk, writing out wedding invitations in his best calligraphy for a wedding to a man he barely knew. Smaug was curled up on a cushion at his side, his gentle breathing and the scratch of Draco’s quill the only noises left to distract him from Slyvia above.
“I guess that’s one way to look at it,” Harry allowed, amusement tugging at the corner of his mouth, “but that’s not what I see.”
Well, shit. I’m properly cross-eyed now, thanks to you, so I better hit the sack before I actually fall asleep and bang my forehead on the desktop. Please pet your lion for me. (Does he have a name, by the way? For some reason, I want to call him Lucy.)
He wanted this. He wanted love; he wanted companionship; he wanted a family. And if the person he wanted it with didn’t want him back, then why shouldn’t he choose someone who
— creator of the legendary
Harry looked genuinely curious now, and Draco guessed he really couldn’t blame him. They’d never talked about this before. Draco had made sure of that.
The other part of me, the one that’s looked forward to Ron and me being auror partners and fighting evil together for the rest of our lives, is not as thrilled by the idea. I mean, I’m quite sure I still want to become an auror, but how will reality ever measure up to my expectations now? When I’ve imagined my future with the DMLE, I’ve always envisioned us doing it together, him and me, come rain or shine. Now what? What if I’m partnered with a jerk, or a total bore? Or even worse, a fawning fan… But it’s not like I have that many options, do I? I mean, what else is there for me to do? Fighting dark wixen is the only thing I’m good for, the only career I’ve ever considered. I don’t know, I guess I just need some time to adjust to the idea of doing it without him. What do you want to do when you grow up?
And just like that, Draco’s gone, continuing down the hall towards the bathroom. Harry’s gaze lingers on the now empty doorway, not shaking himself into action until the sound of the bathroom door closing reaches him. “Tea,” he mutters, then turns off the telly and rises to his feet.
“Nah, I’ll probably have enough of you eventually,” Harry shrugs, “in a century or so.”
Sirius caught his eye and though his face was grim, there was a twinkle in his eye.
“Thanks, Draco. Don’t know what I’d do without you.” He went back to the schedule he’d been working on. “Was that Weasley coming through the Floo?”
“O-kay?” Draco swallowed. Why did it feel like he was being lured into a trap? “What can I do?”
“Huh? Oh, the wards.” Harry waved the question off as he retreated further into the flat, supposedly towards the kitchen. “They told me someone was—”
-Harry
Harry takes Draco's hand and begins to lead him back towards the castle. "You're welcome."

“You have a
Draco shakes his head slowly, but he doesn’t move away. His eyes, gleaming like molten silver, stay firmly trained on Harry’s as he speaks. “They’re for my mate, Harry. Only my mate can ever touch them.”
Sitting up on his heels, he carefully levitated the object from under the piece of furniture, nearly dropping it to the floor as he realised what it was.
“Fuck, Draco…” Harry gasped. “I want
It’s almost a year since they graduated, almost a year they’ve been partners, and Harry’s not sure how much longer he can endure it. Not that they don’t work well together — they do — it’s just… hard, sometimes… to resist pinning the git to the ground and…
“I—” Harry’s voice was barely a whisper. “How?”
Incidentally, Crouch Jr is also the answer to satisfy your curiosity regarding the Goblet of Fire. On RIddle’s orders, he not only tinkered with the Goblet’s magic and entered my name, but also, once I had been proclaimed the fourth champion, made sure I had just enough help along the way to reach the cup first and win. It was a portkey, you see, set to deliver me to Riddle’s awaiting reincarnation ritual. Riddle needed my blood to perform the dark magic that brought him back to his human-ish form. If I hadn’t been such a chivalrous fool, insisting Cedric and I grip the cup together, Cedric wouldn’t have been killed. ‘Kill the spare,’ Riddle ordered as soon as he set eyes on him. As if the guy was nothing more than a pesky bug under his shoe. He died on the spot — the only blessing of an AK, it’s quick and painless — an innocent victim who just happened to catch Riddle’s eye. The first of many, all because of me.
Draco closed the window behind him before returning to the kitchen while unrolling the scroll.
“Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?”
“Bell-
“Thanks, buddy. Now, where’s your family?”
The chants and taunts grew louder, and Harry raised an eyebrow in question and grinned.
Sent: Ok, you clearly know who I am. Well done. Now fuck right off. I have better things to do than have people harass me in the middle of a perfectly enjoyable book.
Shit, I need to go. Apparently, de-gnoming cannot wait. I hope your mum is feeling better soon.
“Glad you could make it.” Harry ignores his racing heart as he turns around.
“He…?” That’s why you hadn’t worn your coat when you showed up, and why you’d been so thoroughly drowned? The bastard had made you walk all the way to the gate to get past the wards to be able to Disapparate. “In the driving rain?”
Draco doesn't even seem to be aware of them, lost in the moment.
He was really only here to be able to say someone was present. It was pointless.
“As long as you don’t mind,” Harry says, knowing full well what his suggestion implies; that he’s ready to go public with their relationship — a relationship that has never really existed…
“You…W-what…?” Harry’s brain short-circuited and there was no way for him to stop the flush rising high and proud on his cheeks.
“Yeah, well, maybe someday.” The noncommittal tone in Harry’s voice made Draco want to smack him over the head and talk some sense into him. He didn’t. Instead, he focused on the piece before him, his gaze following the mesmerising swirls and twists of the glass. “That one’s spoken for, though, so don’t get too attached.”
His cock had been rock hard for what felt like an eternity, throbbing where it laid pressed against Harry’s soft duvet. Every fibre of his body screamed for him to move, to thrust against the mattress, to seek out any form of friction available, chasing that sweet release rapidly pooling hot and fierce in his heavy balls. He swallowed down his embarrassment, acutely aware of the sticky mess soaking the fabric of his pants, pretty sure he’d be staining Harry’s sheets with his pre-come if he didn’t find a way to somehow fix the leak, and soon.
Certain his presence wouldn’t be welcomed by either side, Draco stuck his coin-clutching fist in his pocket and steeled himself for the worst.
"No, you won't." Harry reaches up to wrap a hand around Draco's nape, pushing himself up to place a reassuring kiss on those delicious, rosy lips. "And you're already halfway in, right? Just keep going this time. I'm ready for you now."
Saturday 17 April 1999
Do you ever miss it, Malfoy? Do you miss the thrill of the chase, the wind whipping in your hair as you soar through the sky, the swooping feeling in your stomach as you dive at breakneck speed towards the ground? I bet you do. And, shit… You don’t even get to go outside to taste the fresh air, let alone with a broom. Fuck, I’m sorry, okay? I shouldn’t have reminded you. That was…
Slyvia’s blue eyes were glassy as she beamed at him, then she tossed her long blonde waves over her shoulder and spun, the façade fully back into place. “I’m always happy, darling. Now, you know where to find me if you need…entertainment!”
“Harry…” Draco breathes, clutching Harry’s hips with both hands as Harry starts in on a fresh trail of wet, sloppy kisses up Draco’s throat while rolling his hips slowly over Draco’s crotch. “What are you doing? I thought we were going to—”
I want to scream. I want to break something. No, I want to go to Wiltshire. I want to pummel that fucking bastard into next week, or next year. Or why not the next century? I’m so livid I can’t see straight… until my eyes fall on you sitting on the edge of my guest bed, looking utterly lost.
Draco had come here to start over, to give himself a second chance at life after everything he’d been through in his teens. Two years ago, he’d broken ties with everything he once knew. He’d left the Wizarding world and all its inhabitants behind, exiting the front door of the Leaky Cauldron for the very first time. It had been scary, if not terrifying, to venture out into the great unknown like that. But he’d done it, and he’d made it. He now had a flat, small but cosy. He had a job, unglamorous but paying the rent. He even had friends. Well, mostly colleagues, really, and some neighbours, and the occasional hookup. But at least he called them by their first names — which was more than could be said about the people he used to hang around with in school.
“It’s
Smaug took that opportunity to run into the room, drawn out of hiding by the smell of his food, no doubt wondering why Draco hadn’t come into his room with it yet. As soon as he noticed Harry, he froze at Draco’s feet. Harry, seemingly eager for the distraction, squatted down and offered his hand for the little fox to smell.
I know you don’t open up easily, that exposing your vulnerability is the last thing you want. But if you can only hold on, lose your fear, I’ll try to keep the walls from falling down.
"Do it," Harry growled, suddenly craving the pleasure he knew Draco's touch on his mark would bring. "Please," he added more quietly, and it almost sounded like he was begging. Hell, maybe he was.
“You’ve got…?”
“Tell everybody what, Harry?” Draco snapped, spinning around. “That I’m pregnant? That Charlie’s somehow gotten me — a man — up the duff, and that I’m now expecting his child? Like, seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you?”
“Because I’ve barely ever spoken to the man. I’m not his fiancé, and they’re going to figure out that I’ve lied to them, and then Harry Potter will hunt me down and kill me like the mini-dark lord I apparently still am.” His voice was rising in pitch, but he couldn’t help it. “And in the meantime, Molly will have had a nervous breakdown and Hermione will have a miscarriage, and it’ll all be my fault for destroying this really rather lovely family.”
Sent: You're definitely not Pansy. She can at least spell 'though'.
There was a bit of commotion as a young girl, no more than a toddler, broke into tears just as she was about to climb the steps. Apparently, the idea of approaching the bearded stranger had become more frightening as reality caught up with her. It wasn’t until her dad suggested she and her older sister go together that she agreed to leave his safe embrace. Draco seemed to take it all in stride, lifting up one girl onto each knee and coaxing broad smiles out of the pair of them in no time.
Draco used his wand to turn on some music, pulled out his mixing bowls, and got started.
, his unhelpful brain provided —”is distracting you from your studies?”
“Oh. I see. Brilliant,” Draco says without conviction. “Are you nervous?”
Sent: Who are you?
Harry’s brows rose higher, positioning themselves in an unmistakable
“You wouldn’t…?” Bella’s peal of laughter echoed through the room, making Draco’s hairs stand on end. “As if you had any say in the matter, Cissy. I can do whatever the hell I want.”
“I know we haven’t spoken before, not really, but I’ve wanted to talk to you for ages. I just never knew how.” Draco paused, wondering if the man really could hear him. Probably not.
Draco didn’t believe them.
“2017?” he gasped. “But that’s…”
"Harry. Perfect. Harry. Love you. Harry."
As Harry opened his eyes and returned to the present, it was just in time to see Teddy being lowered to the ground by Draco’s strong, secure arms.
There’s no use denying that I know perfectly well what she’s talking about.
But let me start from the beginning, okay. So, remember how I told you Ginny was crushing on someone else? Well, I finally found out who it was; your dear old friend
Reckoning the coast clear for now, Harry wills his hands to stop trembling as he grabs the mugs and exits the kitchen. His eyes are inevitably drawn to Draco’s door, the sound of Draco moving around in there doing Godric knows what teasing him, tempting him, taunting him. The man is most likely just putting on some fresh clothes, but Harry’s imagination is currently having a field day.
“I may have.” Harry winks and leans down to place a soft kiss on my lips.
have had a futile, little (more like embarrassingly huge) crush on the guy once, but that was ages ago, back in school. Back in that mythical part of the world that he’d left behind. And yes, all right, he
The house-elf jumped skittishly, tearing her attention from the surrounding chaos. She looked up at him, biting her lower lip as she fiddled with the hem of her tea towel. “Mistress wishes Master Draco joining her in the drawing-room, sir.”
Harry trailed off, causing Draco to return his full attention to the man before him. The blush had deepened further, Draco noticed, and Harry worried his lip as he seemed to debate whether to elaborate or not. Amused by his flustered state, Draco smirked and raised a quizzical eyebrow his way, ignoring his urge to free that trapped, swollen lip with his tongue as he waited for Harry to cave.
As if sensing his approach, Harry looked up from his book with a bright smile on his face. “Hi, babe.”
Adjusting to the rhythm, Harry takes in the mesmerising sight before him. Draco's eyes are closed, his lips parted, and his head is thrown back as he loses himself in the pleasure of moving inside Harry. Oddly enough, it's not the low glow of Draco's skin cutting through the glamour he'd forgotten to remove that tears Harry apart. It's not Draco's beautiful, tumultuous wings, outstretched to their full span, contracting slightly each time Draco's hips meet Harry's arse.
— do something…about it?”
I clamp my mouth shut, horrified as my own words register in my mind. I force myself to hold your gaze, to not let my eyes wander over your all but naked body. I remind myself why we’re here in the first place, why you’re so nervous, why I shouldn’t care.
It had then taken quite a lot of persuasion by the Weasley brothers, paired with a steady stream of silent encouragement from Harry, before Draco even allowed himself to entertain the idea, let alone think of it as a viable option for his own future — despite its undeniable business potential.
“Yeah,” Harry wheezed through the last remnants of his laughter, “I’m really sorry about all that, though.” He paused for a moment and then grew more serious. “Listen, Draco. I really think you’re a great guy, and I’m glad you and Charlie found each other. Truly.”
But there were no Malfoys anymore. Just one Malfoy. Just him, alone in London at one in the morning on a Thursday night, impeccably dressed but with no one on his arm. Nobody to laugh with him, to share his joy.
They all filed out of the hospital room after the Healer left, the atmosphere between them lightened further by his general assurances that Charlie was improving steadily and was just unconscious as his body replenished his magic. Draco trailed behind, trying to figure out what to do. It was only a matter of time until Charlie woke up. He needed a solution.
Harry hastens to wipe the offending drop away, feeling heat rise on his cheeks. “Anything else?”
"Fuck!" Harry yells, throwing his head back into the pillow as his back arches from the bed. It's so much, so intense, and with each thrust, Draco reminds him of what they are to each other now.
His stomach-turning, Draco put them all into the rubbish bin and vanished the contents. An Air-Freshening Charm followed and, finally, Draco was able to breathe again.
“Right,” Draco muttered, casting a quick cleaning charm at the floor before cautiously stepping out of his shoes. He refused to use magic on the handcrafted footwear, afraid to weaken the natural oils in the material. Which meant he’d have to clean it by hand. He sighed.
Draco swallowed. “I don’t think that’s true.”
Harry groaned. He really shouldn’t complain. He’d spent the entire day with the extended Weasley family —
- Harry
Two hours later, Harry realises he doesn’t mind sucking at dating at all; at least not as long as he gets to do it the Malfoy way.
Draco frowned. “We do?”
“Really?” Harry asked, now holding his own box and pausing on his way out the door. “I had no idea. Well, good for her. It’s doing a lot of good.” He smiled and Draco followed him as he continued towards the Floo. “Kingsley’s the one who suggested I should donate one of my pieces after I gave him a vase for Christmas. And if the charity has impressed Kingsley, then, well, it’s impressive.”
“Malfoy, everything okay? Did you find the invoice?” Ernie Macmillan’s nasal tones came from the other side of Draco’s desk. Well, their shared desk, really. Draco didn’t work here full time, after all, he just volunteered his time.
A dark-haired man steps into your personal space and, as I watch him wrap his arms around your neck, something vicious growls in my chest. It’s the same beast that once used to rear its ugly head whenever I saw Gin together with Dean, the one I had all but forgotten about since then — until it suddenly stirred awake again a few weeks ago. I clench my jaw, willing the monster to calm down, knowing my only chance of survival is to eventually learn how to befriend it, to temper it, to tame it.
Fire that never came, however, as Charlie’s body pushed Draco into an unconscious retreat, back through the wards. When the flame approached, bright and hot, Draco could feel the hair on his head and face rise, but it stopped, crashing into the wards only centimetres from where their bodies had fallen outside the paddock. It took the dragon a few moments before she appeared to realise she could no longer reach them,  huffing out a frustrated cloud of smoke as she turned her back to them, settling herself in the opposite corner of the paddock and ignoring their presence.
Harry’s faint smile tugged at Draco’s heartstrings. “I’m really glad you’re not going to be alone anymore.”
Someone whimpers as their lips part. Harry’s unsure of who, but it doesn’t matter. The sound urges him to hurry his actions so they can resume their kissing as soon as humanly possible. Thankfully, Draco is quick to catch on, pulling Harry’s shirt over his head in one swift motion as if he’d been reading Harry’s thoughts. Draco’s shirt follows suit, and once they’re both discarded on the floor somewhere, Harry takes a moment to admire the sight before him.
And the boy’s current eagerness did help a lot with his anxiety. Harry couldn’t help but smile as he was dragged through the throng of people, guided towards the Main Square by a five-year-old with enough excitement in his tiny body to rival an entire Quidditch stadium during playoffs.
"Me too."
.” Draco’s drawn-out s makes the simple word sound like a prayer, a plea. His palms are on Harry’s arse now, pulling him closer, pressing Harry’s raging erection against Draco’s equally hard length.
It won’t be easy, keeping these walls from falling down, but I promise I’ll succeed. I have to. For you. For us. For our friendship.
family.”
“You can look, you know.” Harry’s rough voice shook Draco out of his trance.
He grabbed his mobile, but he didn’t recognise the number calling. “Hello?”
The mystery was solved on my eleventh birthday when Hagrid barged through the door with a homemade birthday cake — my first ever — and told me I was a wizard. Up ‘til then, wizards were nothing but the stuff of fairy tales, nothing more than characters in the type of books I’d never been allowed to read (because heaven forbid I’d get any ideas). The next morning, he took me to Diagon Alley, introducing me to our world, and that was the day I met you, the very first wix my own age, at Madam Malkin’s.
"Right. If he'd only quit trying to eat them, they'd leave him alone."
“Shut up. I’m trying to propose here.”
Thanks, by the way, for the image of you muggle-cleaning your way through that ginormous house of yours. (128 rooms? For a family of 3? That’s
He can’t think straight, not from this distance. He needs to get closer, needs to
“No, thanks.” I scoff, shaking my head. “You know I don’t dance.”
Draco let out a breath, cursing the twists of fate that had pulled him into this mess. Sitting up, he folded the blanket on the sofa and straightened his clothing, then turned, hoping to thank Molly and slip out before anybody else woke up. He gathered his things and cradled his new Weasley jumper in his arms. He really did love it.
Draco smiled and raised his hand, offering his glass in a toast. Harry met him halfway, clinking their glasses together before taking a sip of the ruby liquid. The moment felt significant somehow, momentous, and Draco grasped for something to say, anything that would diffuse the sudden tension in the air between them.
“Draco, please…”
. He’d completely forgotten about them there for a moment.
Come to think of it, you probably know it, don’t you? Grimmauld Place? It’s the Black’s ancestral home, after all, so it’d only make sense if you did. Well, it’s mine now, crazy as it sounds; Sirius left it to me in his will. I’m just not sure I’m ready to go over there yet. You see, I spent a lot of time in that house during the war (since it used to be the Order’s head-quarters) and I never liked the place much to start with — all old and dingy, reeking with dark magic and self-righteous contempt. And now it’s been abandoned for so long, almost two years, I fear it will feel even more depressing and inhospitable than it ever did before.
Moments later, Draco sat down with his subpar hospital tea and gathered his courage. “Sirius,” he started, his nerves bubbling in his stomach, “I have to tell you something.” He met the man’s silvery eyes, so like his own.
Draco stared down at his phone, heart fluttering furiously in his throat. What the hell was he doing? What was he thinking? He’d known from the start — ever since this blast from the past barged into his new, blissfully magic-free life — that this could never end well for him. Nothing involving this bloke ever had. He’d known he had better stay as far away as possible from those captivating emerald eyes. He’d known. And yet, here he was, texting the—
— ☕ —
“Thank you,” he said quietly, taking in her quiet look of understanding. She thought he was distraught over his fiancé, after all.
Draco fluttered his eyes closed and bit down on his bottom lip. “Can I…?”
“Did you arrive with Draco?” Sirius asked, a tone to his voice that Draco couldn’t place, but that had Harry narrowing his eyes at his godfather.
Sent: That would be 'roar'. Now, kindly fuck off.
His green eyes positively twinkled with laughter, and Draco forced a chuckle as he felt his cheeks flush hot.
“Oh, yeah, sorry, I—” Harry gestured vaguely towards the coffee table. Draco glanced over at the ruby bowl in its centre and bit his lip, ignoring the nervous flutter in his stomach as he waited for Harry to elaborate. “You’ve got… It’s mine.”
“It’s Christmas Day,” Draco said smugly, “and I’m Santa Claus.” He bumped the tip of his nose gently against Harry’s before placing a soft kiss on his lips. “If you’ve been a good boy, your wish is my command.”
“No thanks,” I say again, feeling like a broken record as I shake my head.
“Yes,” Draco said again, all but panting now. “Me too.”
them. Just put it on a toothbrush (you probably have one of those in that kit too, a plastic stick with bristles on one end?) and rub it against your teeth — all reachable sides — for at least two minutes, twice a day. It may sound tricky and tedious compared to a Mouth Freshening Charm, but I urge you to try it. Please. If you haven’t been able to clean your teeth all this time, I can’t even imagine how foul your breath must be by now. Your mouth must taste like… Oh, just do it, already. You were able to make fire, for Circe’s sake. You can do this too.
“Thanks,” you say again as you sit down and blink unseeingly towards the telly.
Harry made a little noise, and Draco glanced over.
“Pans,” Draco murmured, staring at it. “Have you seen the piece Harry is donating?”
“Yeah. A good friend,” Harry finally said. “And soon, a good brother too, huh? You and Charlie do make a beautiful couple.”
Harry huffed a laugh. “Hardly. I mean, I’m no professional or anything. I just work here at the Wheezes, you know?” Draco stared at him, incredulous, and Harry gave another shrug. “Sure, I’d love to branch out and do this a bit more, but it’s not like I’d ever leave them in a lurch. George and Ron count on me.”
“I do not!” Draco huffed into the empty room before he could stop himself. Oh, great. Because talking to oneself has always been such a tell-tale sign of sanity. The phone buzzed again, its vibrations bone-deep as they travelled up Draco’s arm. Cursing his jittery nerves, Draco pressed a palm to his chest and took a deep, calming breath before accepting the call. “Hel—”
It’s nice to know you’ve considered my state of mind, but don’t ever feel bad for unloading your shit on me. We all have days like that, and Godric knows I’ve contributed my fair share of misery to this exchange too these past few months. If anything, I’m honoured to know you find me trustworthy enough to share your inner musings, whatever they may be. And no matter how hard you try, I’m fairly sure no letter of yours could ever darken my mood. Not really.
He sat up and watched Charlie’s slow breathing.
Draco pulled his winter coat tighter around himself, shivering in the cold January wind. He wasn’t generally one to take a walk simply for the sake of walking, but Pansy was right and this park looked as good as any. He trudged down the path, barely noticing more than the pavement beneath his feet.
awake, cursing the sound of
“I’m confused. You saved Charlie—”
“Well,” Draco shrugged, averting his gaze as he pushed back the discomfiting memories. “Let’s just say, it’s hard to try and make a life for yourself when you can’t even step outside without being harassed at every turn.”
, his mind provided, and that thought alone was enough to set Harry’s mind reeling.
"Do you want me to stop?"
“How would you know?” Draco muttered.
And it certainly didn’t bother him to think about Harry and Charlie in some past relationship. Or if it did, it was only because of his crush on Charlie.
, and
It’s as if all the anger raging within me vanishes at the flick of a wand, leaving me with nothing but a yearning desire to make you feel safe, secure, loved. I take in your wretched form and swallow around the lump in my throat. I want to sit down beside you, to drape my arm around your shoulders and lay you down on the purple bedspread. I want to hug you close and stroke your hair, and hum soothing melodies in your ear until you eventually fall asleep. I want to kiss your eyelids, hot and wet from the tears I see reflected in the dim light. Want to kiss your rosy cheeks and the pale, pointy tip of your nose.
Draco turned, heart racing. This was the moment Charlie called him out on all this ridiculousness.
Harry swallows. It’s not that he’d never date a man, he just… hasn’t. Yet. But dating a friend? It just seems…
Harry looks up into Draco's eyes, just inches from his own, the steely-grey irises hardly visible due to the immense size of the blown pupils.
The fire halted again, and Draco managed to draw himself back to the moment. Laying on the ground in front of him, barely conscious but still managing to maintain his Shield Charm, was Charlie Weasley.
“I’d never,” Draco assured him with a satisfied grin. He might have just turned this guy down, but the blatant appreciation was still an encouraging ego boost. “So what was that? Double tall extra hot…?”
Harry’s eyes are drawn to the wings spread out on the floor behind the kneeling Draco, and Draco tenses, pulling them in closer against his body. Harry wants, no,
He’d imagined it so often, fantasised about what it would be like, and yet… reality was nothing like the visions his mind had ever been able to conjure up. Not only because Draco currently sported a beard that tickled Harry’s chin and a pouting belly that prevented their chests from pressing against each other the way Harry wanted them to, but because it was
Harry rolled his eyes and leaned in to give him a quick peck on the lips. All right, then, two. And a third, just because. And then another that went on for longer than he’d intended it to. Draco’s lips were so soft and pliant, his low purr like music to Harry’s ears. Draco’s hand moved lazily along Harry’s spine, making Harry’s cock twitch and his skin tingle in anticipation.
My retort is on the tip of my tongue when the waiter arrives and places two high-stemmed, metal dessert cups on the table between us. I peer curiously into mine and my mouth waters at the sight of the perfect sphere of pale-green granita glittering in the sun. I can’t deny I was a bit nervous letting Harry go inside to handle our order, his first time since we got here and he can still barely pull off a simple
Ravenclaw’s new seeker should be aiming for the league, though. Damn, but she’s good. She’s only a Fourth Year and she still has a lot to learn, of course, but Maxwell didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell against her last week. So, no, Hufflepuff didn’t bring home the cup in the end; the Claw’s did.
“Yes, I am. Come on in.”
Harry lifts his head to give Draco a glare. “First: Ow,” he admonishes before laying back down, snuggling even closer into Draco’s warm body than before. “Second: I don’t know. Maybe because you’re an evil person who’s out to deprive me of my perfectly brilliant napping spot?”
The intervening years since Draco had least seen Harry Potter in person had treated the man well. He was taller now, maybe an inch taller than Draco, but not quite six feet. His body had filled out slightly as well, his lean frame healthy and lithe, and his shoulders broad. He leaned against the doorframe, his arms crossed casually before him, but the expression on his face made Draco nervous: scrutiny.
“Open your eyes?”
needed to change his sheets a few times after waking up, so he figured it only made sense that he smelled like “mating” to his snake.
He had no idea how long he’d been sitting here like this, his bony arse on the cold stone floor, knees hugged close to his chest, rocking slowly back and forth while trying to block out the bedlam on the other side of the flimsy tapestry — his only shield against the rest of the world.
“Yes, you did. You said something about skating away.”
Molly looked around and met Draco’s eyes, then turned to her husband, horrified. “Oh, Arthur! He’s got amnesia!”
Disclos(et)ed Malfoy,
And now he was dead?
“Oh.” Harry looks down on his bare chest where stray droplets of water still cling to his dark curls. “Well, I just came out of the shower.”
"Happy birthday to meeeee…" Harry murmurs into the mattress, his face squished and distorting the sound.
because this time — maybe it's because Harry has relaxed, or because he's accidentally cast some kind of stretching magic, or maybe it's just because Draco is his, he doesn't know — but this time, Draco's progress isn't impeded and he manages to slide home.
Molly looked surprised, but her smile grew easier as she took the gift from Draco. "You didn't need to do this, but thank you."
Somewhere behind Draco, someone snorted, and he stood up, deciding this was it; this was his moment to spill the truth. But then, Sirius stepped in. “Harry, shut up.” He cuffed Harry upside the head, making the man scowl. “Draco here has done nothing wrong. In fact, his presence has made this entire episode less terrible for all of us. He saved Charlie’s life, for Godric’s sake, and he’s putting up with your unfounded accusations with remarkable aplomb. You should apologise.”
Harry considered. “Do you think there’s just one person for everyone?”
“Well, we can Floo to the Reserve, but then we’ll need to carry them to someplace called the ‘Security Shed’? Do you know it? Ron’s the one who set this all up when the order came in.”
Harry doesn't know how he finds the courage to say it out loud, but he does. "I want to feel your wings on my bare skin. I want to hold you as you fly. I want to taste you."
Draco’s groan is really all the answer he needs, not that he minds the confirmation from the stirring bulge in Draco’s pants. Harry kisses the spot of Draco-flavoured skin closest to his mouth, the one right by Draco’s protruding collarbone, savouring the man’s salty sweetness with relish.
“Hannah! We need you in room two!”
I don’t think I’ve told you about them yet, have I, but among McGonagall’s many post-war integration projects are the new inter-house study groups. Nowadays, we’re all grouped together in teams of four, one from each house whenever possible, and expected to meet on the daily after class to work on our assignments. Apparently, the intention is for us to learn to appreciate each other’s strengths, and to show that all teams benefit from having a mix of all houses contributing to the whole. I don’t know how much Zabini contributes to our study group, though. It mostly feels like he’s tagging along and letting the rest of us do all the hard work. You used to hang with him, right? Was he always like this? The only thing he really does during our study sessions is reminding me of you, which isn’t helpful in the least.
“Leave it to me, little cousin. I know the Weasleys.”
Draco, my champion,
“Oh fuck, Draco…” Harry gasped as Draco took him in his mouth, swirling his tongue around the swollen head before sucking him in deep. Harry was big, not quite as long as Draco’s, but thicker, heavier. Draco relished the size of it in his mouth, the weight of it on his tongue, and he couldn’t wait for it to fill him up in every possible way.
do is be there for Draco when the man needs him.
brain. You will find this one day you know, broken and discarded, and you’ll figure out a way to fix it, to make it better and more powerful than it ever was before.” Merlin. Harry sounded so proud. Of him. Of future him, but still. Proud as a preening peacock. “And you won’t do it to change history either, or even to correct a mistake. You’ll do it because it’s a challenge, a mystery you can’t resist solving. Because that’s who you are, Draco; a mystery-solver. And one of the most intelligent wizards I know.”
Shrugging, Draco gestured to the bag on the floor nearby. She summoned it to her and dumped it out onto the table, barely even giving Draco time to react and rescue his beloved glass art bowl from its pride of place at the centre of the dark wooden surface. The piece’s enthralling pattern of scarlet, crimson, and ruby swirling through the glass sent a thrill through his stomach even now, over a year after he procured it. Pansy snorted at his yelp, using her wand like a stick to push everything around on the tabletop. She nudged aside a set of keys, a wallet, the half-burnt clothes Charlie had been wearing, and an overcoat with several deep pockets.
Your all but seductive enchantress,
They’re seated in a quiet corner, out of sight from most probing eyes, and the hours fly by as they enjoy the evening, the delicious food, the delectable wine, and most of all, each other’s company. They talk and laugh, and they toast with champagne. They play footsie under the long tablecloth and share the chef’s special Valentine’s dessert.
Harry muttered something intelligible, and although it was hard to tell in the darkness, he seemed to be blushing.
Draco nodded, but Molly was smiling again. “Well, I didn’t need to know about…that” — she gestured to the bed — “but I’m glad that’s settled. Now, where’s that Healer with the update?”
“Do you need me to help instead of Ron?” Honestly, Harry could be quite daft sometimes. It was kind of interesting, actually, if Draco thought about it much. So he decided he wouldn’t.
Cancelling the spell around them, he picked up the bag and walked back into Charlie’s room. It felt even quieter now after the Weasley whirlwind had subsided, the low beeps of the monitoring spells now reassuring, like white noise. He sat down on the same chair as before, placing the bag on the floor beside him.
Doubter Malfoy,
And it’s not like a few extra study hours will make any difference in the grand scheme of things, right? By this stage, either you know it or you don’t. At least, that’s how it is for me. These last-minute revisions never manage to stick inside my head, no matter what I do. So, if anyone asks, these are my Charms notes, okay?
Draco stared at Harry, confused. “Why? I’m perfectly capable of Apparating myself, or taking the Floo.”
“If he had to prove it, he would. Wouldn’t you, Draco dear?” Molly patted Draco on the hand. “You must forgive him, Draco. He’s just a suspicious sort sometimes.” She leaned over with a conspiratorial whisper. “All that business with You-Know-Who.”
You’re asking about the new teachers. No, I don’t think you would have met any of them, except maybe for Elphias Doge, the new History Professor? He’s been working for the Wizengamot for ages, so I suppose your dad could have introduced you at some point. Although old and wrinkled, he’s very passionate about his subject, and his lessons can never be called boring. Such a change from Binns that it’s hard to think of it as the same subject really.
“Hi. I’m Harry Potter.” Draco couldn’t help smiling at that, at the offer to start over with the man he’d always wanted to be his friend. His skin tingled as he grabbed Harry’s outstretched hand with his own, squeezing it gently. “And you’re Draco Malfoy, Charlie’s fiancé. It’s nice to meet you.”
“That black Muggle suit we bought that time, with the purple shirt.”
“Great. Well, when you get here, just come knock on the door to the office. You’ll find it on the back wall next to the Muggle games’ display.”
— for fashion advice?” I raise my brows and the corner of your mouth twitches in amusement. Good. My words seem to do the trick so I blab on, heedlessly. “You have impeccable taste; you always look as if you just walked straight out of a glossy magazine. You don’t need me to tell you what to wear to look pretty, Malfoy; you always do.”
- Harry
When he finally settled on a response, he hoped it was good enough. “I wouldn’t do anything to hurt them.”
Received: Parkinson says you know where it is...
to tell you the truth, because the truth was, I’d fallen in love with you.”
Draco frowned, leaning back against the kitchen counter as Harry turned to put away the left-over tart in the fridge. They’d cleared the table together, and when Harry had started washing up, Draco had grabbed a towel and begun drying the dishes without even thinking. Standing there, working together side by side had felt so domestic, so natural. As if it was something they did every day.
“No,” he muttered. “No problem at all.”
And those lips. Those plump, rosy lips, shiny from sugary drinks and alluring like a Siren’s song.
useful dating advise. Now I know exactly how to do it once I figure out who to woo… Circe, your fucking useless, arn’t you?
His wife’s acceptance seemed to win Ron over, too, because he shrugged. “
Draco paused in front of the tapestry, cocking his ear to gauge the situation in the corridor outside. The Dark Lord had finally stopped talking, and from the sound of it, people had stopped fighting. For now. Where explosions and curses and heart-wrenching wails of pain and grief had resounded only moments earlier, Draco was now only able to pick up soft, sob-laced murmurs and the dull shuffle of leather soles against stone. People were moving, and if Draco’s ears didn’t deceive him completely, they were all headed towards the Entrance Hall.
Maybe it’s genetic? Sirius used to talk to himself all the time, and whenever someone caught him doing it, he always laughed it off saying it’s what always gave him the best answers. And each time he did, Remus told him ‘talking to yourself may get you the answers you want, but not the ones you need’. What do you talk to yourself about?
She winked, leaving Draco with an amused smile on his lips as he turned to open the cash register. It wasn’t until he was about to slide the banknote into its assigned compartment that he noticed the slip of paper that had been hiding underneath the money in his hand.
“What’s up?” Your voice, deep and hot by my ear, soothes my rising irritation in a heartbeat. Your familiar lemony scent is mingled with heavy notes of vodka and sweat, and I relax as I feel your body heat against my back, reaching out to me from where you stand somewhere close behind me.
“You mean, the only one without a family.”
“Darling?” Draco’s voice chimes through the house. “Do we have any cupcakes?”
Because Harry did. He looked, to use Slyvia’s phrasing, delicious. His weathered black, skinny jeans accentuated his defined legs, and although he only wore a red t-shirt under his sherpa-collared Burberry jacket, it looked festive and casual. Fun. And yes, delicious.
“I can always try.”
,” Harry cried out as Draco captured the nipple between his teeth and sucked, causing Harry to arch off the bed. “You’re such a fucking tease.”
“Oh, shut up,” Ernie said, laughing at the pun. The sound of the front door slamming shut out in the reception area reminded them both that others might be listening to their conversation. Ernie lowered his voice. “Evidently that’s
Blinking up into Draco’s grey eyes, Harry can hardly believe this is happening. But as soft feathers brush the back of his hand, he readily relaxes into the caress. “Please.”
“All right, well, I’ll see you then, Harry.”
“I thought we talked about this. I buy you special anti-hairball treats. You eat them and keep the piles of…of
It still feels like an impossible dream, an idealistic utopia worthy of the silver screen. Yet, here they are, doing it, living it.
Harry let out a little huff, but he nodded. “I suppose we’ll see you this afternoon, then.” He paused, then added stiffly, “Welcome to the family.”
You want us to go to an Arrows-Falcons match together? Merlin, how will we ever keep from hexing each other senseless once the game heats up? But if you think we could manage it, sure, bring it on. Honestly though, I kind of like the idea of going to a match with you sometime. I bet you’d be able to appreciate a good seekers' duel just as much as I do, i.e. way better than any of my other friends, Ron and Ginny included.
The man raised his left hand to brush a tangle of unruly locks from his forehead. “Do you recognise this?”
“Exactly. So, by supplying the wand for the student on their first day of Hogwarts, we ensure that every student has a quality wand and nobody has to be embarrassed or singled out. After all, sometimes it’s not even about economics; some families consider it tradition to use an ancestor’s wand.”
“We’ll have time for that.” Charlie looked so eager, so happy, that Draco couldn’t say anything.
“The marquee is out the door and to the right; you can’t miss it. Please do not wander away from the party areas. There are wards up to keep both you and the dragons safe, but if we see you trying to go too close, you will be evicted from the party and not invited back. At ten till midnight, everyone will gather in the viewing area and there will be fireworks and champagne on the hour. Please don’t litter, and remember that this is a wildlife refuge area, so treat it accordingly.”
“That was…” Harry begins before realising his vocabulary has been swept away in the flood of emotions.
Being at the Burrow is not even half as bad as you make it sound. And the same goes for the family. I’m not ‘enduring’ my time with them, as you so nicely put it. I really do like being here, and I like them too — all of them — even if they tend to be a noisy, nosy bunch at times. Also, I think having me around seems to keep them distracted from the fact that Fred isn’t, and if that’s the case, I’m only happy to be of help. But yes, my astute friend, I’m probably procrastinating too.
That’s all it takes. A brief second, a flutter of lashes; the wrecking ball to make Harry’s carefully erected walls come crashing down at his feet, obliterating his resistance in the flash of an eye — or rather, two eyes. Two beautiful, silver-grey eyes currently burning into his, darkening with emotions Harry has never dared hope for Draco to ever direct his way.
Harry turns to look at the boy sprawling beside him on the picnic blanket. “We’ll eat as soon as Cousin Draco gets here, alright?”
Harry gasps, feeling his eyes widen as a potent mix of alarm and desire gathers in the pit of his stomach. “Well, that sounds…intriguing.”
“Of course, dear,” Molly said. “If you can’t remember getting engaged to Draco, then surely something’s wrong in there. We’ll just wait for it to clear up, and you’ll be right as rain.” She stood up and took Arthur’s hand. “I’m going to go home and make you some soup so you don’t need to eat this horrid hospital stuff. Creamy chicken?”
“Yeah, but…” Harry found it hard to concentrate as the tip of Draco’s nose rubbed teasingly against his. “What if he wakes up?”
Draco was puzzled, but he approached the fireplace confidently and smiled at the young Healer-in-Training. “Yes, how can I help you?”
“Nothing. I just... I’m not ready yet.”
“Yes, Draco,
N.E.W.T.s went okay, I guess. Not as stellar as yours would have been, but at least they’ll be enough to get me into auror training on my own merits. The practical exams went better than the theoretical — not that that should be a surprise for anyone — but I managed, and I’m so relieved it’s all over and done with.
And then he leans forward, supporting himself with one hand on either side of Harry's head. His wings fall to the side for a moment, and this time when he thrusts, Harry's world explodes.
“Woah, aren’t you a sweet-talker?” Harry crooned. His glorious fingers were back on Draco’s chest, trailing patterns across his pecs, and Draco could hear the shit-eating grin even as he refused to look Harry’s way. “Now, tell me, Draco, are you wheedling for a post-sex cuddle, or are you already trying to butter me up for round two?”
Harry chuckled as he listened to the boy, pleased when he felt Draco’s warmth against his back. He wasn’t all that surprised when those strong arms wrapped themselves around his waist again.
Molly took the cake out of the bag and her eyes widened, filling with tears.
The sight of an old man being so good at handling children should
Draco hesitated, then held out the wrinkled mess. Harry took it and stared.
“Huh, I didn’t realise Park Foundation was behind it,” Harry said as he walked over to a stack of boxes in the corner and picked one up, handing it to Draco. It was heavier than it looked, but Draco adjusted it in his arms and waited. “That’s the one you work for, right? The one that runs the Reserve?”
“Florence.”
close to crashing straight into him. Frowning, he followed the boy’s gaze to the other end of the square. There, on a two-foot-high podium next to the gigantic Christmas tree, all dressed up in white-trimmed red, with shiny black boots and a long curly beard. Draco.
Draco obliged, but instead of touching the mark with his hand, he leant forward and covered it with his mouth, licking and sucking it, and Harry came undone. He was fully hard now, thrusting his erection against Draco's, grasping onto Draco's wings, burying his hands in Draco's sensitive feathers, the touch only egging Draco on further.
Harry grinned. “Thanks.”
Okay, so let me get this straight. If I trust you about Grimmauld Place being a petulant, resentful bitch, you’ll trust me about Sev being on our side in the war; is that what you’re saying? Because, then, hell yes, I’ll trust you. I know what I saw in that pensieve, and as much as I didn’t want to believe it, it didn’t really leave much room for doubt.
He could feel it; the soreness, the evidence of what had happened last night. The proof that it hadn’t all been just a dream. And Draco was still there, still asleep next to him. Harry could feel his body tucked snugly against his back, his hips, his thighs, could feel his morning erection pressing against his arse. Draco’s warm breaths wafted over the damp skin at the nape of Harry’s neck, deep and even, soothing to listen to. Harry wished he could lie like this forever, ensconced in the bliss of Draco’s nearness, far away from the world outside.
Draco groaned and turned to lie on his side again, getting his legs tangled in his sheets, again. Merlin. Never had this bed felt so uncomfortable. It was simply impossible to find a position that didn’t make his body squirm. Not that he really wanted to fall asleep. If he did, next thing he knew, it’d be morning, and that meant…
Actually, if I remember correctly, the resemblance between the two of you was one of the first things that crossed my mind during our first meeting at Madam Malkin’s. Do you remember, Draco? You talked about your parents almost as if they were your servants, always at the ready to be coaxed into doing and giving you anything you wanted. I think I already decided right then and there that I didn’t like you, after only a few minutes of conversation, and once you mentioned that you expected to be sorted into Slytherin, I instinctively knew I wanted to end up anywhere but.
Harry’s hasn’t been able to stop thinking about it all evening; what it’d feel like to kiss them.
Saturday 18 September 1999
“Cool.”
“Potter? What are you—”
Well, anyway, there you go; dare completed. Feel free to be proud of me at any time. I never would’ve done it if it weren’t for you.
“Marry me.”
Suddenly feeling bolder, he opens his eyes, meeting Draco's warm, silver-grey gaze. "Fill me up."
“Er, thank you, Slyvia.” Draco was taken aback, suddenly realising that he probably could consider Slyvia not only a neighbour but a friend. Huh. That thought would take some getting used to. And perhaps it was all the extra Weasley-ness that had rubbed off on him lately, but he stepped forward and put his arms around her, giving her a hug. “Really, thank you. I hope you’re happy, too.” He stepped back. “Happy New Year.”
Sirius smiled, and Draco realised his grey eyes resembled Draco’s own. “I don’t think you would, Draco. If I thought there was even a chance of that, I’d… Well, nevermind. You get the idea. I’m fairly sure you know better than anyone what a Black is capable of.”
lovely. And you were right, it is soothing. The perfect winding-down soundtrack after another crazy day of training. It seems no matter how many times I listen to it, I can’t get enough. And Teddy likes it too; brought him to sleep in no time when it was time for his nap. So, again, thank you (now that I truly know what I’m thanking you for).
Draco hesitated with his thumb over the send button, staring at the name he’d just typed out. It was strange, seeing it again after all this time, like a ghost from horrors past reminding him of all the wrongs and bads and evils he’d committed in a former life. The name belonged to another world, a world in which it would be quilled in ink on parchment and not made up from glowing pixels on a mobile screen. It felt wrong to use it now, and yet, Draco couldn’t quite bring himself to call the bloke by his first name either. It’d surely be too presumptuous, wouldn’t it, acting as if he had any right to first-name him like that? Too personal. Too intimate. No, this would just have to do.
Harry’s hand fell away as Draco finally turned and looked at him, genuinely perplexed. “Why do you ask that?”
Sirius smiled. “I
Draco nods approvingly. “Good choice, Potter. I’m proud of you. You’ll look absolutely stunning.”
“Yes, well,” his voice sounded strange to his own ears as he pulled back, thankful for Smaug’s interruption and eager to move before his body had time to betray him. “I get what you’re saying. Thank you so much for the demonstration.”
“Teddy?” Draco’s gaze flitted towards the ceiling. “But he’s asleep, isn’t he?”
“Black as midnight and sweet as treacle tart?” Draco crooked an eyebrow at the girl, who gave him a pleased smile in return.
Besides, sooner or later Lucius must realise disowning his only son won’t help with his obligations to his beloved heritage; if he’s not willing to take Draco back, the ancient Sacred-Twenty-Eight bloodline will die with him. Harry’s pretty sure not even a serious case of raging homophobia will be enough to make Lucius choose to exterminate the Malfoy family name from the face of the earth.
Draco buttons his trousers, then helps Harry up and runs his hands along the crease of Harry's arse before tugging up Harry's pants and jeans. He leans down and pushes his nose into Harry's neck, inhaling deeply. "Thank you."
Not until now.
“But it’s really late, darling, and you’re practically asleep already.” Harry combed his fingers through Teddy’s unruly locks, now back to the natural light brown he'd inherited from his father. “Come on, I can carry you if you want…”
“If they’ll hate you, they’re stupid. Now go on over there and get it over with.”
Draco wondered if he should mention the amount of work he was putting into the project, but he let it go. He really didn’t want to sound like he was boasting. Instead, he quietly followed Harry into the Floo and stepped through, emerging into the Reserve’s reception area, darkened and abandoned for the evening.
“What?”
Get one's thumb out of one's arse = Stop procrastinating
He wants to take it slow. He’s been fantasising about this moment for so long, and if this is real, if this is really happening, he wants to make it perfect. He wants to drag it out, to savour it. He wants to treasure it and etch it on his memory to keep forever.
Harry frowned. “The one you could never tell me anything about, just like everything else concerning your job?” Draco shrugged apologetically. Not being able to talk about his work with his spouse was about the only downside to being an Unspeakable. “Yeah, I remember you mentioning it once or twice.”
“So beautiful,” he mumbled. “So fucking sexy.” Harry’s praise, delivered with that same awe-struck reverence as before, was almost too much for Draco to bear. And it only got worse when Harry leaned in, his hot breath ghosting over Draco’s neck as he whispered close to Draco’s ear. “Do you have any idea what you do to me, Draco? Do you have any idea what the sight of you, naked in my bed, does to me?”
Because this is fucking torture.
Not that I couldn’t have gotten a date if I wanted to. I could have. It’s just… Dating freaks me out, okay. I just don’t know how to be around girls. No matter how sweet or lovely they are, I always feel awkward around them and end up saying the wrong thing. Nothing you’ve ever experienced, I’m sure. You’ve always been quite popular with the girls, right? Care to tell a dating dork like me how you do it?
“Teddy? Can you go see who that is?”
“I know. I know, I just…” Potter reached out and pushed a lock of hair from Draco’s face, hand lingering as fingertips traced the side of Draco’s face. Draco was vaguely aware of how red-rimmed and puffy his eyes must be, how flushed and blotchy his skin must be, but Potter didn’t seem to notice. Instead, he kept his eyes on Draco’s as he brushed the pad of his thumb over Draco’s cheekbone, cupped his jaw, and… leaned in.
Charlie, of course, remained silent, and Draco snorted.
Your jumper is soaking wet under my palm, your clothes dripping a trail on the hardwood floor. I summon my wand from the coffee table and you shiver as I cast a warm and gentle drying charm over you before guiding you to the couch.
Apparently, I’d been acting a bit distracted all morning, because when we all gathered in the kitchen for a short snack break, Luna pointed out I supposedly was the victim of a major nargle infestation. Her signature out-of-the-blue comment might as well have been a Silencio for how quickly everyone stopped talking to turn their attention my way, concerned frowns all around — until Blaise, the nitwit, shared an amused look with Theo, shrugged, and said, and I quote, ‘Nah, it’s just his usual Saturday bug.’
“James,” she confirmed with a smirk. “James Evans.”
Snape’s voice sneered at him.
“You,” Arthur interrupted. “
“As if I didn’t already know.” Draco scoffed, and before Harry had time to blink, the man was pinning him against the door, trapping both his hands above his head. “As if I cared. I—”
Harry smiles. "Move."
Orion told Harry one day after another encounter sometime in October.
“Dance floor and orchestra podium setup?”
“I—” Harry gasped as Draco started stroking his cock. “You… I want to…
Draco opened his mouth to argue, then closed it when he realised he had no retort. Smaug jumped up onto his lap and licked his cheek, making him smile.
“Mr Malfoy, the Head Healer was hoping to speak with you and Mr Weasley’s family this evening about his progress. Will you attend?”
Received: Drinking… 🍷
Draco forced a smile, nodded, then laid his cloak over the nearest chair.
“Hmm?”
Draco nodded stiffly. "Thank you for inviting me." He held out a bottle of wine. "This is for you."
When he exited the room, Harry didn’t follow him.
It was like nothing he’d ever experienced before, not even from his own mother. It was like everything he missed about his mum wrapped up in one single embrace: her acceptance, her pride, her love, her encouragement.
"I love you," Harry says quietly, and the truth of the words fills the room like Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
“You’re a good man, Draco Malfoy.”
“Please, I—” Potter slowly slid his hands out of his pockets, palms open and empty, raising them to eye level in a surrendering gesture. Leaving himself vulnerable. The fucking idiot. “I don’t want to—”
“Hi,” Draco breathed.
The look on Harry’s face made it impossible to get another word out. Draco needed to get away from him, from all of it. He needed to leave before he broke into a million pieces right here on the floor of the Ministry’s Office of Civil Affairs. He needed to get home.
“Of course he shouldn’t leave them. You need me, then?”
Harry stood up. “Sorry.”
“Thanks.”
Snape said, rolling his eyes in exasperation.
“You know what I think?” Draco’s voice is soft as he leans closer to place his hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing it gently. “I think you should go for it. You never know, maybe he’s…”
Of course people would be interested in reading about your life. If nothing else, then as a cautionary tale, hehe. No, but seriously. Offering up your story to the public might even gain you some understanding from those out there who still are thick enough to believe a young child can be solely responsible for its own values and beliefs. No, you weren’t a nice kid, Malfoy, far from it — at least not to me and my friends — but looking back, even I can realise those ideas of supremacy and bigotry you used to live by were not ones you conjured up by yourself but parts of the narrow-minded worldview you inherited from your parents growing up. I can’t speak for everyone, of course, but at least I, for one, would be most intrigued by the possibility to read — yes, I read, you insufferable git — about your view of it all, of your experience of the war and your part in it, provided the story is yours and not written by some scandal-seeking journalist like mine. (Yeah, you’re probably right. I wouldn’t have wanted to talk to them. And maybe I’m naive, but I still think I should have a say in what’s published about me, especially if it’s promoted as the ‘true tale’.)
. It’s really him. I should know, right?” he quickly added as Harry was about to protest again. “I just met him the other day, didn’t I?”
I don’t know why I keep forgetting that you’re all isolated and unknowing over there. Last year was different when you were all locked up in Azkaban and no one ever saw or heard from you. If I hadn’t been at Hogwarts, constantly being reminded of you by random glimpses of memories brought on by the sights of certain locations or people, I might’ve even forgotten you still existed. Now though, ever since we started this letter exchange thing, you suddenly feel so real again, as if you never left, as if you’re just a few floors down in the dungeons with your mates as usual. The feeling that you, at any time, could turn a corner into the corridor I’m walking through makes me forget that you’re not here, but there, and that I’m your only connection to the outside world. It’s fucking weird.
She smiled and walked up to him, settling down next to him on the worn wooden bench. Her presence was calming. They’d gone through so many of the same things: the Triwizard Tournament, losing Cedric, fighting in the war, being unceremoniously adopted into the Weasley family. Over the years, she’d become like the big sister he’d never had and he thought that, if anyone, she knew love. She was part Veela, after all. Weren’t they supposed to be experts?
Draco took a sip of his tea and tried not to spit it out. It was truly disgusting. Setting the cup back down, he straightened his shoulders. “I need to tell them. And besides, Harry doesn’t find this the least bit amusing.”
I can’t believe your having me up this blooody early… It’s only like — well, fuck me, it’s actually half ten, but we only got back a few hours ago and I’m so fucking tired I can’t even… Yet, here I am,
She furrowed her brow, looking concerned. “What’s wrong? Did something happen with Charlie?”
Draco chuckled ruefully, but he managed to force himself down the ward until he reached the family milling about outside Charlie’s room. He looked past all the redheads, seeking out Sirius.
“You didn’t have to, Harry. And if you did, you could have just brought it on Sunday.”
“Hi, Fleur. Have a seat.”
Just him.
Harry’s warm smile sent tingles down Draco’s spine. He was right, the evening
Teddy nodded and didn’t protest as Harry went to pick him up from the sofa, compliantly wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and leaning his warm head against Harry’s chest.
“Draco?” Bellatrix’s voice called out, stealing the air from Draco’s lungs. “If you’re in here, don’t think you can hide forever. I’ll find you. And when I do…”
“Wait,” he manages before his mind is clued in to the soft flesh under his touch, the smooth skin, the pleasant warmth. Without letting go, he hastily — and far from elegantly — gets to his feet, spreading his fingers over Draco’s skin as he takes a step closer. “I just need to know for sure.”
Harry nodded as he swallowed another sip of wine, his mind suddenly reeling. "We're going to do this, aren't we? Live together."
“But—”
Stop constantly fishing for confirmations about our friendship as if you still can’t believe it’s real. (Yes, I noticed you calling them that — my ‘real friends’ — as if what we have is somehow fake and you’re just an imaginary playmate the kind of which lonely kids like our younger selves make up when they’re bored out of their minds.) Stop talking as if I’m going to ditch you the moment someone asks me to. As if I had no integrity whatsoever. Do you really think that little of me? No, as far as I’m concerned, our friendship isn’t going anywhere, and you had better start believing it too before I get tired of convincing you about it and actually ditch you for being such an unbearable, daft prat.
surprising? His narrowed eyes were intent on the screen before him, his fingers flying over the keyboard as he typed. The clenched jaw, currently shadowed by a dark stubble, completed the look of irritation Draco readily recognised from their Hogwarts’ days.
Maybe now’s not the best time to divulge the fact that he once declined an invitation to their grand opening.
Draco swallowed, feeling a flush rising on his cheeks.
Draco frowned. It couldn’t be…
No, Ron and I are definitely not joined at the hip. (If his hips are joined with anyone else’s nowadays, it’s Hermione’s, and I really don’t want to imagine myself as any part of that equation, thank you very much.) We’ve had our fallouts before, and we’ll undoubtedly have them again, but he’s a good friend and I can’t deny his change of mind threw me for a loop.
Received: I can work with that.😉
“I guess…” Draco said hesitantly, because, yes, it did make sense. He’d just never thought Harry would actually be willing to ever forgive him his past wrongdoings.
"...and no house-elves," Harry added, laughing. Their attempts at the Manor had proven to be just as unsuccessful. He was pretty sure Narcissa was sending her house-elf Penny to spy on them and interrupt at inopportune moments. No elf could have that lousy timing on their own.
Draco met her gaze and realised he knew her somehow. Hufflepuff, his sluggish brain managed to supply. He dropped his eyes to her name tag. “Hannah Abbott,” he muttered. “Hufflepuff.”
Molly’s eyes widened comically large. “You fell in love with
The next time he saw Draco Malfoy, they were on the Hogwarts Express, two of the many eighth-year students ready to return to Scotland for a second chance to finish their education. Draco was one of only three Slytherins returning from their year, Blaise Zabini and Tracey Davis both close by his side. Over the next few weeks, the trio was never seen apart, banding together for support, safety or solidarity. Harry wasn’t sure what, but if he’d felt curious about Malfoy, if he had wanted to talk to him alone for Merlin knows what reason, he couldn’t.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this. You were supposed to be happy now, for Circe’s sake. He was supposed to make you happy. I can’t reach the pain you feel, can’t protect you from the hurting. But I can promise to always be here, to be your rock when your world falls apart, a shoulder to cry on when life comes crashing down around you.
So I do it. At late o’clock in the evening, in the middle of Nott’s pre-Christmas party, I begin the difficult task of raising the walls around my heart. Impenetrable walls to protect my inconvenient feelings towards you within a fortress of self-preservation, preventing them from ever seeing the light of day.
"Harry," Draco begins to argue, but Harry shakes his head.
“Wait,” Harry pants, regretting the word as soon as it leaves his mouth. Draco stiffens under him but doesn’t loosen his grip on Harry’s arse, as if afraid Harry would bolt if given half the chance. To be frank, Harry’s not sure that he wouldn’t, but Draco’s strong hands keep him grounded, assuring him Draco wants him to stay put. At least for now.
. Well, that’s helpful. “He would’ve died with nobody to take care of him. And I don’t know why I’m making excuses to you. You were the one all, ‘Oh, Draco, we can’t just leave him here,’ and, ‘You’ve always said you needed a roommate.’”
Sent: Scared? You wish, Mr I Can't Spell
“I know, Uncle Harry.” Teddy looked up at him with an encouraging smile, his large, blue eyes filled with concern. “Don’t worry, I’ll be back before you know it.”
He took a deep breath, letting the cold air fill his lungs and willing it to improve his spirits. He did enjoy the fresh, crisp mountain air, so far from London’s stale smog. Maybe what he needed was a walk to clear his head? He could remind himself of what he had, and perhaps, recentre himself a bit.
“Yes, love, we know,” Ron said, patting her hand. “So Charlie has a fiancé
Draco choked and quickly turned it into a little cough. “Yes, well, opposites attract and all that.”
Draco sucks in a sharp breath, then tries to look down at the tree which is now back in its previous, bare state. “I can’t— Let me see your neck, Harry. I want to see what it looks like.”
“Really?” Hermione asked, looking thrilled. “That’s wonderful. I always told him that just because Crookshanks hated him and treated him nastily didn’t mean other cats would. If he’d just give them a chance—”
Draco hesitated a moment before adding:
I have an exam next week, a really important one, and I know I should be studying for it like a maniac, but… I just can’t muster up the energy to care. It’s just so inexplicably boring. Paragraph upon paragraph of rules and regulations, most of which are downright idiotic. Even the dusty tome they’re listed in is boring me half to death. Maybe if I was 100% sure about wanting to become an auror, I would have been able to stomach it as a hurdle towards the main goal, but as it is…
He tried to draw his gaze away from the sculpture, but it seemed impossible — until his awe-addled brain caught Harry’s quiet reply.
Draco felt positively giddy as he went about his day.
“Yes?” he drawled, covering his growing apprehension with a familiar mask of disdain.
“Yes.” Draco cut him off, too impatient to wait for Harry to elaborate. “Please. Anything.”
“A pumpkin spice latte and a cauldron cake, please.” The squat, older witch peered up at Draco with curious eyes, her mauve-tinted lips twitching with a million unvoiced questions.
She threw her head back in laughter, accentuating her slender neck and exposed Adam’s apple. She really was beautiful. Her stunning, teal blue evening dress, covered in sequins for the night, clung to her body like a second skin, the cut showing off her smooth leg from thigh to ankle. Although she was already a good five inches taller than Draco, she wore two-inch heels with straps that wrapped around the lower part of her calf, effectively drawing any man’s eye down her leg.
. I don’t get it. What could possibly be so important that it can’t wait until tomorrow? You’ve been staying at his place the entire week for Circe’s sake; surely you must’ve had time to talk your hearts out during all that time. Unless you were too preoccupied doing oth—
“It’s Santa!”
And they did. Include Draco, that is.
“My pleasure, ma’am.” He winked, already retrieving one packet of each to add to her plate. He rang up the purchase, leaving her to deal with the credit card machine as he started preparing her tea and turned to the next customer in line. “What can I get you, sir?”
“Draco,” she called, her voice pleading, but he was already cutting his way through the crowd, the joy of the room now turned against him with the utter mortification of the moment.
“I sure hope not.” Harry chuckled as he rolled over on his side and propped himself up on his elbow to meet Draco’s eyes. “You see, I have plans for you, Draco Malfoy,” he drawled, his free hand stroking leisurely up Draco’s thigh, “and all of them require you being alive.”
“Salazar, you taste so good,” Draco murmurs against Harry’s skin, his voice low and rough, a bit breathless and
Harry’s smirk grew wider, ever smugger. “Good to know.”

Gryffindor Tower, Hogwarts
Still want to go to that quidditch match with you, though. We’ll just have to come up with a way to keep from hexing each other and I’m sure we’ll be fine. Oh, how about we turn it into a challenge? The first one to hex the other pays for drinks at the pub afterwards?
For a moment, Draco’s eyes were drawn to the plain golden wedding band on his finger. Then he saw it; the lightning bolt scar cutting through the brow over his right eye.
Draco runs a gentle hand up Harry's thigh, and that helps as Draco bites his lip and pushes in deeper, unbelievably slow and yet almost too fast. Almost. Harry closes his eyes and feels every centimetre of Draco's progress. They must be about halfway there when Harry begins to feel like he might actually crack in half. Surely he'll never make it. Draco is just so big.
His eyes are so dark, barely a sliver of grey framing the black pools of longing and desire, and Harry has to avert his gaze to keep from initiating another desperate kiss. In search of distraction, his attention is drawn to a small mark about the size of a Galleon that he, oddly enough, hasn’t noticed on Draco’s collarbone before. Squinting in the dim light, Harry takes a step closer.
The undisputable nearness of another man leaning close to him now, though, the heady whiff of earthy tones and sugary sweetness told him otherwise. Harry fucking Potter was invading his personal space, and Draco had to bite back a groan as he tried to remember why it wouldn’t be a great idea to bend over right then and there, begging Harry to take him against the counter.
“There you go.”
“Yes, Ernie, I’m pregnant. You found me out. First accidental male pregnancy ever. Whatever shall I do?”
Draco's heart did a double-take at that last piece of information, finding himself unable to keep his eyes away from Harry any longer. Looking over, he couldn’t help the smirk curving his mouth at the sight of Harry, face down in the palms of his hands, ears bright red.
Received: Pansy says these jeans make my arse look spectacular…
“Don’t ask me,” he said on a nervous chuckle, hoping the amusement would be enough to veil the sudden squeakiness to his voice. “But apparently she’s holding me responsible for your exam results now, so I thought I’d—”
“Harry,” Hermione said, taking a seat next to him in the Gryffindor common room. “Maybe you should just try to become his friend?”
“First a fox, then an owl, and now a comatose man. Next time, I really need to pick a conversation partner who can speak.”
And that’s why I simply can’t get why you shouldn’t be allowed to choose your own wife. Because, after what I witnessed on the night of the final battle, I have no doubt your parents love you more than anything in the world. Have you ever talked to them about it? Maybe if you did, they would let you choose for yourself? Come on, we’re at the brink of a new millennium, surely even the pure-bloods would be interested in getting with the times? Or do you plan to stay in the 19th century forever? What’s to say you couldn’t produce an heir with the love of your life? What are these repercussions you’re talking about? You are correct that I don’t get it; so tell me. I do want to understand.
“Certainly.”
have no say in the matter.”
Don’t be ridiculous! No one’s avoiding me because of you. As I said, everyone’s just busy, and I’m positive Ron’s the only one still taking his time getting used to the idea. Even Luna and Dean — who I thought would find it extra weird, considering they were once imprisoned in your manor’s cellar — have given me their blessing, so could you please shrug off that ill-fitting insecurity cloak now? It doesn’t suit you in the least, and I’d happily take your insufferable, sassy wit over it anytime. (And knowing how irritating I’ve always found that particular side of you, that’s really saying something.)
The challenging glint in Malfoy’s eye has the same effect on Harry as it’s always had.
“Please forgive me.” Potter’s eyes were drawn with… concern? Empathy? Regret? Draco didn’t know, and he never got the chance to ask. He was still trying to make sense of the kiss, still trying to remember how to breathe when Potter blinked into nothingness before his eyes.
. Harry’s almost convinced to dive right back in, no questions asked. Who cares about the future anyway? Harry used to think that he did, but the magnetic pull Draco has on him now — and honestly, always has — makes it hard to remember why.
“Wait, no…” Draco started, trying to interrupt, but everyone kept talking over him. Everyone but the mysterious, dark-haired man in the corner who simply grinned, as if enjoying himself.
Harry’s eyes flashed. “And what do you know about my family? Spending a week with them does not make you an expert.”
“I did,” Draco said to his back, following after Harry as he made for the kitchen. “It was highly entertaining to listen to all those spoiled brats talking about their extravagant wishes. Let me tell you, kids these days have no concept of money whatsoever.”
His suggestion was superfluous; Draco was already on it, working Harry’s fly open while laving Harry’s glorious torso with his lips and tongue, scooting down the bed to relieve Harry of the last of his pesky clothes.
Harry looked interested, so Draco continued.
- Harry
Draco kept his eyes locked on Harry’s the whole time, only closing them occasionally when Harry’s touches and needy sounds became too much for him to process without coming. Harry revelled in the beauty of them, the warm bluish-grey framing dark glittering pupils, enlargened by desire and softened by emotion.
Received: You know, like a lion... Rawrrrrrr 🦁
When Harry eventually tuned in to the conversation again, he realised Teddy had started repeating himself in his sleepiness, no longer making much sense but blabbering on nonetheless.
Guilt cut at Draco’s stomach, and he withdrew his hand, the moment effectively ruined by the harsh reality of his deceit. Without another glance Harry’s way, he turned towards the hearth and threw in the Floo powder, stepping through to the Wheezes for the second round.
“Hi, Draco,” he said eventually, his voice soft and tender. “Thank you for the compliment, though I’m not sure beautiful is the right word. I can’t say I’ve had the chance to check on the veracity of the angel-enchanting arse, but given the situation, I really think it’s best that we
Harry leans in and captures Draco's mouth, running his tongue along the delicious lower lip before sucking it into his mouth. "I want you to fly us somewhere private."

Received: Anyway. Thank you for taking care of me.
Draco’s jaw dropped. “What the hell?” He couldn’t help it; he burst out laughing again. “Oh, now I
“Well, yes, but…” Madam Malkin pursed her lips, unconvinced.
And then Draco is shooting into Harry's mouth, and it tastes hot and slightly sweet, but kind of bitter — sort of like Draco himself, Harry thinks, suppressing a chuckle — but then it's too much to swallow and it spills from the sides of Harry's mouth and the heat of it, the utter lewdness of it all, pushes Harry over the edge.
Well, fuck. Maybe that backfired.
Draco’s stomach twisted at the thought. Normal. Right.
“Yay!” Teddy flashed him a wide grin and rushed off in the direction of the front door.
“No reason. I like it. It suits you; makes your eyes look…nice.” Harry swallowed, and Draco’s gaze went straight to his bobbing Adam’s apple.  “Although, I must admit I’ve never considered a purple coat on a man before.”
"Are you okay?" Draco's eyes are closed and he's using Harry's outstretched leg as support, resting his head against Harry's calf.
“Now, look at him and tell me he’s not fuming with jealousy.”
This all just kept getting worse.
The grin Sirius gave him stretched from ear to ear as they walked out of the room and headed to the Visitor’s Floo. “Oh, Molly is going to
You don’t answer my greeting, an anomaly strange enough to make me sit up straighter, allowing me to throw a glance your way over the back of the couch. I only get a brief glimpse of you as you pass by the doorway, heading straight for your room without acknowledging me, wrapped securely in a world of your own. Before I even have time to process what’s going on, the door closes behind you; the sight of your face, pale and drawn, dancing before my eyes long after you’re gone.
Your hopeful friend,
Harry’s heart swelled. “I don’t know,” he said, “maybe if we’re lucky, he will.”
“Yeah. She’s the one who talked me into going. I guess she noticed how miserable I was…”
I turn around with a smile, the cocksure man instantly forgotten. “There you are. Having fun?”
Harry bobs his head faster, grasps firmer with his hands, and the ache in his jaw, the feel of saliva running down his chin, it's all worth it. It makes him even harder, knowing that he's doing this, that he's unravelling this beautiful man who so rarely lets himself be seen by others. He lets Harry see him, though — all of him — and Harry feels his own release coming closer at the thought.
“A-ageing potion.” Draco’s unsteady voice drew Harry’s attention back to his face, and when Harry looked up, it was to the sight of heavy-lidded eyes and a worried lower lip.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Excuse me,” a scowling man demanded, nearly knocking Teddy to the ground in his haste. “Excu— Oh, Mr Potter, sir. I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there.” The scowl morphed into a fawning smile so quickly Harry wanted to scream. Not that he didn’t think a sincere apology had been warranted, it most definitely had, rather because Harry was once again reminded that, most likely, the only reason he even received one was his unwanted celebrity status. “Have a good day, Mr Potter, and Happy Holi—”
He's lost, and in the back of his mind, he just knows there's no coming back from this.
Harry willed his eyes to leave Draco’s pert arse alone, but it was a losing battle. Gorgeous blokes shouldn’t be allowed to bend over like that. Especially not this one. And especially not in Harry’s office, for Circe’s sake. Even with the lab coat covering Draco’s snug trousers, Harry had no trouble imagining that delectable arse all too easily. And that was the real trouble, wasn’t it? Because imagining Draco’s naked arse was the last thing he ought to do. Not here. Not now. Not ever.
Received: So, prove it. Ditch that boring book and get your pretty arse over here.
“Are you even qualified to use that word, Potter? You know what, I’ll add it to my ever-growing TTTP list.”
PPS You’re seriously contemplating Esmeralda? As in Quasimodo’s seductive enchantress? How the hell do you figure that to be an appropriate name for my inner snake?
Received: Who knows? 😏
I called Kreacher home that same evening after reading your letter. I seriously hadn’t thought of his absence as a contributing factor in all of this, but yeah, when put like that it makes perfect sense. It’s strange, though, having him here, pottering around. I don’t know, it just feels weird for me to have someone doing stuff for me that I could just as easily have done myself — not to mention the guilt trip I have every time I even think of Hermione finding out I have him here, working for me. You don’t know this, of course, but she’s been fighting ferociously for house-elf rights for years; even started an organisation promoting house-elf liberation all the way back in Fourth Year, convinced all elves should be freed and paid for their work like everyone else. While an honourable mission, she never got much support from the elves themselves, not even from your old house-elf Dobby who loved being free ‘til the end.
“Ye— No, thank you,” the man amended solemnly after a withering look from his wife.
Harry blanched as the horror of that notion rushed through him. “So you didn’t have a choice?”
Harry’s still not sure what made him agree to have that picture framed and placed on the mantle for everyone to see. Draco’s persuasive nature, most likely; Harry’s had a hard time denying the man anything as of late.
“Food!” Harry blurts, squashing the mental image while reaching for the picnic basket.
Merlin, if anyone had told Draco ten years ago that he’d be smitten by a Weasley, he’d have questioned their sanity. But he was a different person now, and it was a different world. All of that old nonsense seemed so long ago, so ridiculous and unimportant.
A flicker of jealousy flared in Draco’s stomach. “You’ve been coming here for years?”
“You pegged him, did you?”
I swallow. You’re so fucking beautiful. I don’t know when I finally realised it; maybe on some level, I’ve always known. Because you’ve always been handsome, haven’t you? All tall and blond and bloody perfect. Though it wasn’t until after the war that I noticed it; when the constant threat to my life was gone and the pressure on me to save the world had finally been lifted from my shoulders. Then, when I was finally allowed to relax, finally free to open my eyes, our groups of friends had suddenly merged and… there you were. The best friend of my ex’s new boyfriend, my best friend’s new study buddy, my reliable Potions partner and constant Seekers’ game opponent.

When the clock finally struck seven, Draco couldn’t be out the door fast enough. Harry’s building wasn’t hard to find, it really
No, he walked. Briskly. As fast as his legs could carry him. Up the main staircase, around the corner, another four flights of stairs, and along the corridor leading to the only safe space he could think of that didn’t contain that fucking vanishing cabinet; the bane of his existence.
No one seemed to notice him as he joined the crowd pouring out onto the front steps of the castle, his gaze searching for—
PS And fuck off, Malfoy. Your handwriting looks as neat and perfect as it ever has. I bet you just added that PS for a chance to criticise my ‘chicken scratches’. If you must know, I’ve never held a quill until I came to Hogwarts at age 11, and you have no idea how much harder it is to write with a quill than a regular muggle pen.
“Yes, there is.” Teddy’s defiant glare was enough to wipe the last traces of amusement from Harry’s mind. Had the volunteers going around asking for donations really stooped so low as to…? On Christmas Day?
He presses closer, tilting his head to deepen the kiss, and Draco lets him in,
“You naughty, naughty boy,” he whispered.
Deranged Malfoy,
," Harry moans as Draco slides in deep, the burn from the stretch of the extra digit only momentary and quickly brushed aside as the feeling of Draco's fingers inside him intensifies.
Because behind him stood Harry. Harry, whose solemn, emerald eyes followed Draco’s every move as he walked down the aisle, approaching them. He looked like he wanted to say something, and for a futile moment, Draco wished that he would. Draco knew he wouldn’t, though. Harry had already made that perfectly clear the other day, despite the thoughtful gift. The gift he’d
“Not to my son.”
And every time we’re here, you ask me to dance. And every time you do, I decline, laughing it off as a ridiculous idea even though I can’t think of anything I’d rather do if I could. To be the one with my arms wrapped around your neck, or the one pressed against your back, moving my hips with yours. To be the one to pin you to the wall, snogging you senseless, or the one to drop to my knees before you and—
Draco chose not to answer as he grabbed a glass food container from the refrigerator and started scooping up Smaug’s dinner into a fresh bowl. Pursing his lips, he briefly considered whether he should treat Smaug to something extra tonight or not. It was New Year’s, after all, and Draco was about to leave him all alone again, the poor creature. Coming to a quick decision, he returned the container to the fridge and took out the jar of crumbled crispy bacon the fox loved more than anything else. Too bad Draco couldn’t stand the smell it made as he fried it up for him; but what could you do? It wasn’t like he could ever deny Smaug his favourite food.
Harry met him by the edge, welcoming his obvious joy with open arms. “Was it fun meeting Santa?”
Pansy shrugged, pulling off the coat and retaking her seat across from Draco. “So?”
“No, you—”
It was time. He had to do this.
The music is loud, its bassline pumping relentlessly from the speakers, pulsing across the sticky floor and reverberating through every fibre of my body. The spotlights cut through the darkness, their beams roaming in unpredictable patterns, splashing light in every colour of the rainbow over the dancing crowd below. It’s enough to make anyone dizzy, even without the aid of any alcohol, and I’m fairly sure that, if it weren’t for the sight of you in the middle of it all — a fixed focal point in the surrounding chaos, something solid to rest my eyes on, grounding me — my head would be spinning out of control.
A challenge Malfoy seems to take literally because what follows is nothing but a constant string of dates as unpredictable as the man himself.
“Just let me give you one last tip,” Draco says softly, the corner of his mouth twitching into a lopsided smile.
“A friend,” said a low, deep voice, cradling Draco in its warm embrace. “Don’t worry, Draco. I’m not here to hurt you. I merely want to talk, if that’s all right with you.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Come on, Malfoy, it’s

Draco took a breath, opened his mouth, and— His brain screeched to a halt. “What? You know I have to tell you something, or you know what I’m going to tell you?”
“Let it go, Hermione,” he insisted, then turned back to his textbook. “I need to get this spell right, so, with all due respect, stop bothering me.”

You see, my mother always used to say two things: “Whatever happens, we’ll always have Florence” — a phrase she often used to console me when it felt like the walls were closing in on me and life grew darker than I ever thought possible — and, “Life doesn’t always turn out the way we plan.”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it with a humph.
“Okay,” he continued, taking a deep breath, then he turned back to Molly and Arthur. “So, that day at the hospital when we brought Charlie in—”
PS If you call me the H-word one more time, I’ll never write you back again.
"Fuck. Merlin, Harry, you feel so good. I need you. I want you. I love you. You're so perfect, Harry. So fucking perfect for me."
What felt like hours later, but according to Hannah Abbott was only forty-five minutes — the max amount of time the family had been allowed to stay for visiting — everybody filed out of Charlie’s room.
Draco wants him. Has been wanting him for years. If that means Harry’s stuck with him for the foreseeable future, so be it. Frankly, if it means Harry’s stuck with Draco for always, that’d be okay too.
“So…” Draco leaned down to suck one of Harry’s hardened nipples into his mouth, bracing himself with one hand next to Harry’s shoulder while the other reached down to —
Draco’s heart sank. He knew what she was asking. And it wasn’t like he had anything special planned, just watching old holiday movies on the telly all day.
He knows better than to ask the man straight out, though. That’s not how you get Draco Malfoy to talk. Contemplating his options, Harry takes a generous gulp of his tea, hoping it will ease the ache burning in his throat.
are going out.”
“No, not at all. But I do think there are people that, once you choose them and they choose you, will become your one person.”
“Well,” Harry smirks, squeezing Draco’s hand, “seeing as how I’m your mate, dating sounds like a good first step to me.”
He reaches for the remote and mutes the telly that’s been running unseen before his eyes.
The unmistakable sound of Apparition echoed through the room, startling Draco enough to almost drop the device to the floor. He grabbed its chain in the nick of time, just before the malfunctioning gadget turned into worthless pieces of crap.
The endearment is unexpected, as is the eruption of heat it sets off in Harry’s chest. It only takes another couple of thrusts before Harry comes, hard enough to see stars, his hands clutching Draco’s biceps as Draco’s name falls from his lips like a prayer.
- Harry
I hadn’t expected my protective instinct to take over from there, hadn’t expected my stupid, possessive chest monster to force me to come back with you every time since. I tell myself it’s just because I’m a good friend, that I want to be there for you, to support you, to look after you. Truth is, I’d never be able to forgive myself if something ever happened to you on a night like this. Not that you’re not capable of taking care of yourself — I’m fairly sure that you are, you’re a competent wizard, and a powerful one at that — but in a place like this, surrounded by strangers, intoxicated and willingly making yourself vulnerable for people who… I mean, who knows which of these men are trustworthy and not? Who knows which have good intentions and which are only out to use and abuse you? I might not like witnessing what you get up to with them, but at least I’m here if you need me, ready to take you home whenever you decide to call it a night.
The hissing comes from Orion’s spot next to Harry’s pillow and Harry smiles at the sound.
“Merlin.” Draco chuckles softly, “I’m going to need another shower after this.”
Harry swallows.

“Well, believe it or not; it’s not that different from dating a woman.”
The fire died and Draco turned to Harry. “Guess we need to finish up here, then. I’ll come back tomorrow to do the bedroom, I suppose.”
His clothing was mostly burnt away and his skin was blistering. But he was alive. And he was conscious. Draco saw the dragon pull herself up again, ready for another attack, and Draco drew his wand.
She blushed. “Well, you
Her smile was just as jovial as ever, and since Draco was perfectly able to ignore the existence of their unspoken exchange the previous day, he didn’t notice the quizzical quirk of her eyebrow. At least that’s what he told himself. Because why would she look like she was bursting with the need to question him about whether or not he’d done something she’d never proposed he’d do in the first place?
Harry can feel the heat rushing to his face at Draco's words, and he's glad his lover is behind him and that the room is nearly dark now the sun has dipped below the horizon.
Just like any other Slytherin, Malfoy simply doesn’t want to lose that stupid bet.
Draco laughed, feeling the man’s excitement fuel his own. “I’m looking forward to it. Do you need any help?”
Draco still hadn’t been able to rule out the possibility that the man was here on a surveillance mission, posing as an innocent Muggle college student while taking notes to report back to the Ministry. Not that he could’ve gathered much of importance from sitting there watching Draco take orders, prepare drinks, and serve up brownies, but who knew what the Ministry considered important these days? They had always taken a special interest in the strangest things. Maybe they suspected Draco of a nefarious Death Eater plot, poisoning his Muggle patrons one mocha latte at a time?
dragon. Now, are you going to help me clean up or are you just going to get in my way?”
I was a little sceptical about getting a new Head of House, but as things turned out, I couldn’t have wished for a better replacement for McGonagall. Faith Silverberry, the new Potions Professor, is amazing — and not only because she happens to have been good friends with my mum, but because she’s a really good teacher too. She’s patient and kind, and more pedagogic than Snape could ever dream of becoming. And get this: she can explain stuff so it makes sense, not only to me but even to Nev and Seamus. Pretty impressive, huh? Apparently, she and my mum were Potions partners all through school, and so she seems to have an endless supply of stories to tell me about my parents. (Nothing you’d ever need to worry about, right Malfoy, relying on the tales of a stranger to get to know what your parents were like?)
“Draco? We weren’t expecting you today,” Ernie called from the next room. “Everything okay?”
Harry shakes his head and turns his attention to the mug in his lap, unable to meet Draco’s gaze. “There always is.”
Received: Nope.
“You work too much,” she said with a pout. “I thought you ran a charity. Surely, it shouldn’t have to take up so much of your time? There isn’t any way you could rearrange it, just this once? For me?”
"You are so beautiful," Draco says, his voice soft and reverent, as though he were looking at a panel of artfully stained glass or a sculpture in a gallery. Harry relaxes and reminds himself that this is Draco, his mate, his love. Their bodies are made to be together — he even has the mark on his shoulder to prove it.
Harry waggles his eyebrows and is rewarded with an exasperated eye-roll.
“Do you usually deal with the difficult business connections?” Draco asked as he moved in the proffered direction, the curiosity beating out the polite disinterest that was his default.
“No, Harry,” Draco interrupted. He couldn’t let Harry take the blame for this debacle. “
“Oh, fuck off.”
Harry shook his head. His voice was barely audible when he spoke. “This one’s just for you.”
I think it’s called. Maybe you’ve heard of it?”
“Mushu?”
The hum from the fridge was his only companion as he sat there in the dim light from the street below, thoughts swirling, heart racing, eyes fixed on the screen for what felt like hours. Fragments of an old saying, something about watching a cauldron, flitted through his mind without making a whit of sense. Then…
“Dark.” Harry’s voice was tight. “I like tall, dark, and burly.”
If I hadn’t just witnessed you spending your entire yearly quota of humble gratitude just a few weeks ago, I’d never even contemplate wasting another piece of parchment on a reply to that sarcastic rant of yours. Merlin, Malfoy, you’re such a fucking drama queen sometimes, I don’t even… But I know you, and I get it. Your oversized pride gets threatened and bam! Diva to the rescue. Just like when Buckbeak grazed your impeccable porcelain skin in Third Year. You do know pride is a sign of low self-esteem, right? Maybe you should work on that?
“Face the scariest thing you’d ever done in your life.”
“Oh, don’t start on me.” There was a slight note of panic mixed with the laughter in Ginny’s voice. “Mum knows I’m a lost cause at the moment. ‘A girl can’t settle down if she’s cavorting around the world on a broom,’” she mocked in a dead-on impersonation of Molly. “I have absolutely no interest in a relationship right now, and Mum has finally accepted this.”
Draco’s mind spun, struggling to get a grip of the situation. “What?”
Formal handshakes and polite conversation are usually more than I can handle on the best of days. Now imagine that, times a thousand, warped into overdrive, and taking place on the worst of days. After two weeks of no sleep. Merlin, it felt like every wix in Britain wanted to get ahold of me. In the end, my friends had to usher me out of there, ploughing through the frantic crowd of people who seemed to believe touching me would be their key to eternal salvation. Now, where was my wicked ex-death eater fan repellant when I needed him the most?
“A lot of what he said didn’t make much sense at the time, but it cheered me up all the same, making me relax enough to eventually fall asleep.” Draco took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. “When I woke up the next morning, I first thought it had all been a dream, but then I noticed the coin still clutched in my fist and I knew…”
you. Merlin, you can cook for her Charlie? You’re going to be her favourite.”
Draco laughed. “He thinks he’s a dragon sometimes, but no. He’s a fox.”
Ginny laughed, a repressed sob tinging her voice. “They were really good fireworks, though.”
PPS So you decided to let me help you with your Patronus Charm, then? Great! Sooo looking forward to finding out what form it will take. And good luck trying to teach me how to dance. I’m pretty sure I’m a hopeless case, but I wouldn’t mind watching you pop your cork trying.
Draco returned the smile, forcing himself to feel the cheer that seemed so elusive these days. “Yes, Merry Christmas, Ernie.”
His furry flatmate slid by him into the room and raced up onto the top branch of the floor-to-ceiling cat tree Draco had adapted for him, peering down at Draco imperiously.
“Sirius Black knows?”
should never be underestimated. It involves bodies and yearning and feelings. ”
Harry leaned to the side, squinting at the coin as he held it up in the light from the nearby reading lamp. “It’s—” Harry blinked, confused, then, “It’s… me,” he breathed. “But… Fuck, Draco. What the…?”
Draco grimaces. "Darling, as much as I love the idea of celebrating my birthday, can't we just save it until after our examinations? Please?"
“Draco!”
"That we look sated and should go to sleep. And that he ate a nice mouse."
A sticky mess of come, sweat, and lube coated both their stomachs as Draco eventually found the strength to leave Harry’s warm embrace and roll onto his back beside him. He blinked up at the ceiling and tried to focus his blurred vision, still blissed out, still panting, still struggling to rein in his racing heart.
wished he were as happy as the Malfoys.
And then he heard the humming.
“Yes, he overheard me or something, but he says I shouldn’t say anything to the others until Charlie wakes up.” He conjured an armchair and slumped into it, dropping his head in his hands. “What do I do, Pans? How did I get into this mess?”
“It’s going to be okay.”
“You’re welcome,” Draco answered and trudged off into the night, assuming Harry would follow.
necessary if they were ever going to get married, after all. Couldn’t have a crispy groom. Eyes still closed, he chuckled at the notion. They only needed to have a conversation first, and maybe a few dates.
Don’t be silly. If I hadn’t replied, you simply would’ve written to someone else. One of your actual friends, who, I’m sure, would’ve been happy to hear from you. Corresponding with them, you’d be updated on all the latest Slytherin gossip, and you could’ve slandered the rest of us, shared inside jokes, reminisced about good old times, and whatever else it is that you usually do together. I bet they’d be able to cheer you up just fine, making sure to keep you alive and sane till you eventually get out of there by the end of the year.
He fought the urge to do it again, figuring stroking his arse probably wouldn’t be the smartest thing to do with a line of customers waiting by the counter. Especially considering he was currently facing the espresso machine, his back to any questioning eyes.
“What is?” Harry looks up to find Malfoy smiling gleefully at him as he places a fresh round of drinks on the table.
Sent: Fine. Go on, then. What do you want for your birthday? A clue?
“I’m sure,” I chuckle.
“Want me to talk some sense into him?”
His eyes were drawn to the corner table in the back before he could help himself.
Pushing both hands through his hair — it’d have to do for now — Draco crossed his flat to the kitchen, turning on the hobs and starting to fill the kettle. Thoughts of the previous day swirled through his head as he went through the familiar motions of breakfast preparation, relying on his muscle memory to accomplish scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and buttered toast without his interference. He’d just poured the boiling water over his favourite loose-leaf breakfast tea when he heard a loud knocking coming from the other room.
Harry didn’t mind being totally ignored in favour of his godson. This was Teddy’s moment, and quite an important one at that, judging from the way the boy immediately straightened up and cleared his throat.
"What do you want, Harry?" Draco asks, his voice rough and deep.
Reading about your childhood, I also can’t help drawing parallels between you and my cousin Dudley. He was just the same as you, Draco: adored by his parents, spoiled rotten, and arrogant as fuck because of it. He was the worst bully, tormenting me 24/7, both at school and at home, and just like you, he had this entourage of loyal thugs who followed him wherever he went so he never had to face his victims one-on-one.
“Yes, Uncle Harry,” Teddy said on a long-suffering sigh, “I’m sure.”
“He’s not like that,” Draco growled.
“Me neither,” Harry said, breathless, looking up at the gorgeous vision before him. Draco looked like an angel; a true Christmas angel descended from the heavens to bring beauty and joy to the world.
And then finally —
“Hey,” Potter said softly, taking a tentative step forward. “It’s okay. I get that you’re upset with me, and I don’t blame you. You’re under a lot of stress right now, and I don’t expect you to believe me when I say I know what you’re going through, but… I do.” A sigh, another step, an outstretched hand. “Come here.”
A Summoning Charm would probably have been easiest, but Draco’s hands still trembled too much for him to trust his aim. Instead, he crawled over to the escritoire on all fours, laying down flat on his stomach to peer into the darkness.
Now, go brush your teeth, you fucking drama queen.
Draco shrugged. “Well, yes. I mean, it’d be nice to have some peace and quiet for me too, but I like my flat well enough. But he’s my family now. He deserves to be happy too.”
Fuck. Why must I always leave evreything til the last minute? I fucking knew we were going out last night, and yet… You see, it was Ron’s b-day the othre day, so of course we had to go to the 3Bs to celebrate him porperly as soon as weekend struck. And I knew there’d be alcohol, but fuck, I’ve never been so plastered in my life… Have yuo ever been drunk, M? Ever woken up the next day feeling like you’re heads about to explode and you’re stomach is about to turn inside out if you so much as open your eyes? Merlin, I don’t even know if I’m hungover or still drunk… How’d you know that?
“Maybe to some extent, but no, not really. He’ll have Rose there with him, which I think will make a huge difference. Sure, I had Theo, but we weren’t even remotely as close as they are. Sirius and Rose will always have each others’ backs, even if they don’t end up in the same house.”
Slyvia was… She was well-meaning, if overly boisterous for Draco’s taste, and her ridiculously over-the-top demeanour and style of dress, especially when preparing for one of her shows, tended to embarrass him — which, in turn, only seemed to encourage her flirting. Like now.
“How’s all that going, anyway? The fiancé thing?”
“No, I—” Harry gasped as Draco grabbed his arse possessively with both hands. It was awfully hard to think when Draco was nuzzling his neck like that. The soft hairs of his moustache were tickling his skin and— “I meant… n-neat and tidy isn’t rea—
Draco moaned; a delicious sound that reverberated through Harry’s body like wildfire. Harry’s common sense was quickly crumbling to dust, and he knew that if he didn’t do something now, they’d be shagging openly right there in the kitchen within minutes.
They lay like that for quite a while afterwards, with Draco collapsed over him, none of them willing or able to move. Harry could feel Draco’s heartbeat pulse with his own, no longer racing but still beating hard against his ribcage. Draco left sloppy kisses on Harry’s neck and shoulder, anywhere he could reach without having to lift his head. Harry let his fingertips wander absent-mindedly back and forth along Draco’s side and he smiled every time he hit a spot that made Draco twitch under his hand.
Wings. Pull. Caramel. Feathers. Tether. Dreams.
“Harry?” Molly asked, sounding upset. “What are you doing? Why are you talking to Draco like this?”
“Anyhow,” he said, finally handing her what he hoped was the correct combination of coins, “I’m pleased to hear everyone’s business seems to be booming. I wouldn’t have wanted to be the only one banking a profit tonight,” he added with a wink. “Now, let me fix that pumpkin spice latte for you.”
“No, I— I mean, yeah. I…”
“I— Yeah,” Harry manages, reminding himself for the gazillionth time that this was never supposed to be real, that he shouldn’t feel disappointed about it being over.
Oh, I almost forgot. Luna says hi, and, ‘Of course, Draco. Anytime,” and, “Don’t let the wrackspurts get to you.’ She’s been staying here for a few days while her dad is out of the country, supposedly to be closer to work, but I suspect she just doesn’t want to be left alone in their house. She told me what you did for her and the others that last week, after you got home and before we rescued them. That was really sweet and considerate of you. Not to mention, courageous, considering what could have happened had Bellatrix or any of the others ever found out. It seems Lucy will never cease to impress me; maybe you should let him out to play more often?
“Draco? Hi, it’s Harry.”
Against his better judgement, Draco nodded. “Fine.”
“And what are you, the happiness fairy? Are
Smaug slowly made his way closer to Harry, then sniffed his hand and gave it a little lick. Harry didn’t move, just waited, and finally, Smaug took the last few steps and pushed his head under Harry’s outstretched hand, nudging it.
Draco nodded again. He really, really liked them.
Sent: Pansy? Is this you trying to be funny?
“Wizarding London okay with you?” Harry asks, offering his arm for a Side-Along.
Provided I won’t have to strangle them for spilling the beans next time I see them, I’ll make sure to give them your love. Not sure when that will be, but if not sooner, they’ll probably be here for my b-day in a few weeks.
Harry wanted to get closer, wanted to touch, wanted to feel, wanted to inhale the Draco-scented air he knew was lingering only a few steps in front of him. But his knees had gone weak again, turned into jelly by the mere sight of Draco in his home, and so he opted for leaning against the doorframe instead, hopefully looking casual with his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets.
- Harry
When Harry woke up the next morning, it was to the sound of Teddy’s feet hurrying across the landing just outside his bedroom door.
“I know.”
“No, no, I’ll be fine, and Harry will be along tomorrow to give me a hand running it all. Usually, it’d be Ron, but with Hermione…”
time-turner.
They stepped into the tent and, Circe, the heat and noise and crowd of people hit them like a wall. The marquee was lit with fairy lights everywhere and a band played at the far end of the tent. From the outside, Draco hadn’t heard a thing, but in here, the din of voices and laughter lifted his soul. Yes, he really was an extrovert at heart, feeding off the energy of those around him. And this, this was simply wonderful.
“It’s okay, cutie cub,” Harry assured him, “just as long as you try not to do it again.”
“To talk?”
Ginny started laughing but stopped at her mother’s glare. “Right, no Mum, I’m sure Charlie was a virgin until he met sweet Draco here.”
going to tell them, but it just didn’t seem like the right time yet.”
Can you believe it? Our two houses sharing a table at the Three Broomsticks? If you weren’t stuck in that place, you might even have sat there with us, all haughty sneers and witty retorts. With that in mind, is it so hard to imagine that I sometimes expect you to show up as if you were just back from the loos? Or returning from the stacks with a book or two when we’re all at work in the library?
It doesn’t help that this particular train of thought has an actual, vivid memory to start from either.
Harry stared a moment, taking that in, and then changed tactics. “What is Charlie’s favourite food?”
“’Dromeda?”
“Yes, well, seeing as how I’m not about to go into labour anytime soon, I think we’ll be fine.”
Molly pulled back and everyone else surrounded him now, asking him questions.
“What?” His voice was defensive.
Harry looked around at the rapidly filling trash. “And you don’t mind that Charlie lives like this?”
“Thanks.” He nodded at the young man and breezed into Pansy’s office. She was sitting at her desk and on the phone, her back to him as she spoke, looking out the window. He grinned as she held up a finger to him over her head. There wasn’t much his best friend wasn’t aware of.
Draco rolled his eyes towards the ceiling. “I meant
Oh, just one more thing. The other day, as I was perusing the study, I found this pot of ink that I suspect might be similar to the one you use. What did you call it again? Ancestry ink? Anyway, it’s black instead of your dark green, but it shimmers just as yours does, and when I tried to write with it, it just disappeared from the page. I remember you saying something about it being an identification thing, that only family members could use it, right? So I’m guessing it must be the Blacks’ ink? Makes me wonder if my family ever had this kind of ink too, and what colour it would have been.
Harry grins and shrugs. “Absolutely. So…”
“So… You really want this?” he says, searching Draco’s face warily. “It’s not just a spur-of-the-moment thing? Because I wouldn’t want to wake up tomorrow with a ruined friendship and a broken heart.”
“And what about you?” The official asked Charlie with more than a hint of exasperation to his voice. “Do you object as well?”
Draco dropped down into the chair, staring at the snowglobe in his hands and then the door, in turns.
The framed picture on the mantle catches his eye as he passes the fireplace on his way to the kitchen. Two newfound friends grin back at him, Draco’s arm casually slung over Harry’s shoulders, Harry’s loosely encircling Draco’s waist.
Draco walked into the Wands for Wixen Ball with his head held high.
Harry sighs with pleasure as he sinks deeper into the cushioned chair, rolling his shoulders and breathing in the heavenly aroma of Vindaloo. Every muscle in his body aches from the exertion of their afternoon activity. “So, what’s today?”
No, it wasn’t the young gorgeous Draco that Harry was used to, but it was still Draco, and if Harry had ever doubted whether this was true love or just a crush, he had his answer now. Because he yearned for Draco even now, old and wrinkled as he was. Not because he was attractive, but because he was
“Well, yes.” Malfoy smirks. “You showed up ten minutes late—”
“Hello, little guy. Smaug, right?”
Draco barely had time to process what happened before another curse, on his right this time, whizzed past him at eye-level. A crystal vase exploded mere feet in front of him, jerking him out of his stupor. Heart pounding, Draco dropped to the floor just in time to avoid the next curse from grazing his hip.
For the same reason I don’t trust myself to drink anything stronger than tonic water these days: because I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you if I did.
Teddy frowned, bewildered. “Cousin Draco!”
PPS Ha, bloody ha. I’m glad I’m not superstitious then, because Monday night, I dreamt about you. Again. At least, this time, I didn’t have to try to save your sorry arse from mortal peril, so I guess that’s something. But you and me marrying? Godric, can you even imagine?
He hadn’t wanted to go back for Easter, but just as with everything else in his life, he hadn’t had a say in the matter. Not showing up at the manor would have looked suspicious, and the Dark Lord’s suspicion was the last thing his family needed right now. They were still recuperating from Father’s failure at the Department of Mysteries almost two years ago; anything but total compliance now would be utterly foolish.
“I do.” Harry sighs and leans down to rest his forehead against Draco’s, lowering his gaze, no longer able to meet Draco’s questioning eyes. “Merlin, help me, but I do.”
“She’s always busy, sir, but she’s not in a meeting. You can go in.”
“Free Friday night?”
“Yes,” Draco said. “Preferably a Camembert if you’re partial to tart, green apples like I am. If sweet reds are more your style, then I’d recommend you try it with a creamy Cheddar instead. The salty cheese will bring out the sweetness of the apple like nothing else.”
” Harry Potter’s unmistakable voice was suddenly high-pitched and strained. “Charlie’s not engaged.”
“You think I’m—?”
She glared at him. “This event
“You didn’t have to.”
A slow smile crossed Harry’s face and the corners of his eyes wrinkled as the smile reached them. Dipping two fingers into his breast pocket, he held up one of the silver pieces of paper Pansy had distributed as tickets for the evening.
And Draco’s wand was safely tucked away in its box over in the corner by his trunk. Not that he’d be able to do much with it had it been in his hand, but still.
“Today’s topic I’ve decided to call
“Thanks. I—” Harry licks his lips. “How about you? Any hot date waiting for you now that you don’t have to entertain me anymore?”
Draco had come here to catch a break, and possibly, very likely, to break down. Grown-up Potter, with his false concern and his fake pride — and his fucking entourage of futile childhood fantasies — was the last thing Draco needed right now.
My dismissive growl doesn’t seem to have any effect on him, though, apart from the flash of pure want in his clear blue eyes.
“You don’t have to,” Harry heard himself saying. “I quite like the thought of being marked by your mouth.”
“Yes, yes, you’re right. I miss
Draco keeps his eyes closed but presses his head into Harry's hand, reminding Harry of Orion doing the same.
“Here, kitty-kitty. I have food for you. Aren’t you hungry?”
“But I don’t have…” You hesitate, closing your eyes while taking a deep breath. When you look up again, you’re standing right in front of me, your stormy-grey eyes wet and pleading. “My vault… I don’t…”
“I know. We are a venomous species.” Malfoy’s silky voice is laden with amusement and, not for the first time, Harry curses his Auror partner’s superior stealth skills.
I lean back on my rickety chair, stretching out my aching legs and crossing my ankles as I watch the people milling around on the sun-soaked piazza. They’re mainly tourists, of course — this time of year, it’s only to be expected — but at least they’re mixed with a healthy dose of locals here, compared to the more famous sights like Piazza della Signorina or Ponte Vecchio. I’ve always preferred places like this, the hidden gems away from the most fervent crowds, but I figure we’ll probably have to tackle those too, sooner or later. Although I’ve been in this town enough times not to have to bother with the obligatory tourist attractions, I’m with a new travel companion now, one who’s never been here before, and it would be blasphemy to leave this place without ever having seen Il Duomo or Michelangelo’s David.
With a determination he didn’t feel, Draco steeled himself for the worst, summoned his resolve, and lifted his head to meet Potter’s gaze in the mirror.
The dark-haired man Draco had been ignoring smirked. “No compassion for
“Merry Christmas,” Teddy offered his idol in lieu of a goodbye, his enthusiasm evident not only in his sing-song voice and animated wave, but radiating from his entire being as he skipped over the podium floor towards Harry with a huge grin on his face.
“I’ll see you tomorrow. The Ministry. Eleven o’clock.” He turned and left Pansy stewing. He had too much to do.
before Potter pulled back again, leaving Draco stunned.
Draco gave in and laughed through the tears in his throat. “No. Yes. All of you. I fell in love with all of you.” He gestured with his hand across the sea of red hair before him. “I went from being all alone, and then suddenly I had parents and siblings and nieces and nephews.” He met Sirius’ eyes behind the rest. “Even a godfather.”
Although I’d never question your abilities for potions or bureaucracy, I have to say I am starting to get a bit concerned for your mental state after all. Maybe I was wrong, maybe you’re actually going insane over there after all. At least, that’s the only explanation I can come up with, because hell if I know why else you’d gush about my skills like that. Well, I guess you could have meant it as a joke, but it didn’t really read as one, and so far, insanity is the only other reason I can think of. Because you can’t seriously be out to compliment me, can you?
“Him? Which
Harry swallowed down a sudden bout of arousal and groaned as he felt a flush rise on his cheeks. Draco snickered quietly and hugged him closer, leaning in to rest his chin on Harry’s shoulder. And that’s how Teddy found them as he turned around to check on the muffled noises behind him.
"You won't," Harry insists, desperate now for more.
And that’s when it hit him: the two of them were having an actual conversation, quite possibly their first ever. And to his surprise, Draco not only found himself enjoying it but was starting to think the feeling might even be mutual. The only thing he knew for sure — he didn’t want it to end.
“Wow, I had no idea.” Draco could feel Harry’s curious eyes on him, but he kept his gaze on the coin, trying not to gauge Harry’s reaction to what was inevitably coming. “Where did you get it from?”
Only a few days left now before your mother joins you. Which also means you’ll be halfway through your house arrest. I bet that must feel good, knowing you've made it this far? Have you given any thought to what you’d want to do once you get out of there?
“I like it,” Draco declares. “Having it out of your face brings out your remarkable eyes.”
“Do you know what Teddy asked me to get you for Christmas?”
“Sirius? Sirius Black?” Pansy sounded interested now. “Wow.”
“I-I have to go,” Harry said abruptly and turned before stalking to the door. He paused with his hand on the doorknob. “I’m sure you and Charlie will be very happy.”
“What am I going to do, little dragon? He’s finally my friend, and I’m going to fuck it all up because of this whole Charlie thing.” The fox’s nose twitched as he studied Draco curiously. “And his glass. Oh, Smaug, you should see his glass!” Draco rolled over on his back, unable to keep his arm from gesticulating as he spoke. “It’s gorgeous and so intense, like looking into his soul or something.”
Received: Me wants it. Me needs it. Must have the precioussssssssssssss
“I see a man walking blindly into a whole new, unfamiliar world, armed with nothing but determination and pure survival instinct. I see a man open to reevaluating his beliefs, to befriend the people he was once taught to despise and learn how to live among them, as one of them. I see a man who managed to navigate a society he up 'til then knew nothing about, making a new life for himself, a home, a profession, a future — against all odds. I can’t even imagine the amount of courage it must have taken to do what you did.”
Because you’re not really here, are you? Physically, yes, but not mentally. Not emotionally. I haven’t seen you in days, and now that you’re home, instead of watching the show with me like you used to, you’re on the phone. With
Draco relaxed and nodded, then met Harry’s lips gently to cheers all around. It was quick, and it was chaste, but it seared through Draco’s every cell like lightning.
Surely, you see why I rather not think about it these days, much less talk about it, if I can help it. I know it all probably sounds like a fucking nightmare to you, but you must remember that since I really didn’t know anything else at the time, I wasn’t aware of it being anything out of the ordinary. It wasn’t until I heard my Gryffindor friends’ stories about their homes and saw the affectionate Weasleys in action that I realised something had been missing all this time. I appreciate your concern and your sudden urge to seek vengeance on my behalf — I really do — but please promise me you won’t. We wouldn’t want you to get imprisoned again once you’re finally out of there, now would we? Think of all the quidditch matches and patronus practices and dance lessons we already have lined up following your release. Not to mention, my dire need for your supposedly outstanding fan-repelling services. We won’t have time for you being locked away again anytime soon, my dragon, so go back to your cave and cool off for a while, all right? I’ve made my peace with my past and I’m ready to move on. Move on with me?
Draco stiffened and backed up. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“Hey, no need to get defensive…” Draco said, holding up his open palms in a placating gesture. “I never said I didn’t like it, did I?”
Harry lost track of time, looking into those twinkling grey eyes. He was dimly aware of the conversation between child and elf going on beside him, but it wasn’t until Draco nodded pointedly in Teddy’s direction that Harry hastened to return his attention to the boy. Unfortunately not before catching Draco winking at him, turning Harry’s knees to jelly with a casual dip of his long eyelashes.
Apparently, this is how his life is going to be from now on, then, with the two of them ganging up on him at every opportunity. Strangely enough, the thought doesn’t annoy Harry like it probably should have. Rather, it ignites a warm feeling of affection in his chest.
Now, don’t let this get to your head. It’s already bigger than could ever be healthy, and I’d hate for it to explode one day when you least expect it. (With my usual luck, it’d probably happen on a day when I’m on call too, so I’d be appointed your very own clean-up crew…)
“Shit. When did that happen?” Wood sounded amused.
“I’m sure he won’t,” Draco assured him, to which Harry quirked an eyebrow in question. ”Because he knows he’ll have to answer to me if he does.”
imply she’d hold me responsible for your success, and I wouldn’t want to be the target of her ire were you to fail that exam. But if you have everything under control, then—”
Harry set his jaw, finally coming to the decision he knew he should have made months ago. He would get over this stupid crush one way or another, or he’d die trying.
Fuck indeed. Draco thrust into Harry’s fist and leaned down to capture another delicious groan from Harry’s lips. He had started to realise turned-on Harry was a veritable buffet of tasty noises, and Merlin help him, but Draco was quickly becoming addicted to them all, feasting on every moan and savouring every whimper like a starving man.
Draco lets out a harsh laugh. “You’re such a prick, Potter,” he says with a strained voice and an exasperated headshake. “If you can’t tell I’m currently using every last bit of my restraint not to rip your clothes off your body, then you’re a blithering idiot.”
Draco paused and considered, until Smaug nudged his hand with his cool snout, urging him to continue the petting. Draco did, taking a sip of his tea with his other hand before nodding. “Yes, that about covers it.”
“Teddy? You’re next, cutie cub.”
He told Orion about it, hoping he might have an idea.
. And he cared. Harry’s heart swelled at the mere notion of it.
“They’re so soft,” Harry murmurs and spreads his hand just as he did on Draco’s arm. Under his splayed fingers, the feathers seem to fluff out, little bits of down poking out from underneath the long flight feathers on top, drawn to his skin as if by magnetism.

PS I include a second envelope with this letter — one that you’re

"Yes," Harry eventually manages to get out. "Fuck, Draco, yes. So good."
Draco closes his eyes, but the corner of his mouth twitches into a small smile on one side. “When I realised my magic was reaching out for you, that
Malfoy snorts, amusement dancing in his eyes. “No, thanks. It’s really not that big a deal; I’ve survived worse. Now, stop distracting me and watch as I show you how to shoot the perfect strike.”
Harry’s face flashed through Draco’s mind, but he pushed it away. Sirius, maybe. Sirius was friends with Shacklebolt, wasn’t he?

Draco felt alive. And all because he was lying to this man about being engaged to his surrogate brother. Or, Draco thought, confused, maybe not just a surrogate brother, if he’d understood Harry’s ramblings correctly — and didn’t that feel just a little bit…incestuous? Draco shuddered at the thought before reminding himself he was a pure-blood, and that some surrogate brother didn’t even hold up slightly to what could be found in his own family tree. He had no room to judge.
?” Not that he didn’t trust his abilities on a broom, but Sweet Salazar. “Will I become a Prefect too?”
And yeah, staying away from that wine cellar is probably a wise choice. Like you, I haven’t had many opportunities to get properly drunk throughout the years, and after Ron’s birthday bash, I felt so crap it took me several days to get back to normal. (Professor Silverberry was decidedly not impressed by the lot of us and had plenty to say about it the following day, stressing the importance of adults showing responsibility and being good role-models for the kids, etc.)
Draco had no idea what he was supposed to do now, only that he had to do
Eager hands venture under the hem of Harry’s t-shirt, setting Harry’s skin on fire wherever they roam. The shirt fabric gets bunched up at Harry’s armpits and although he’s reluctant to break their kiss, Harry makes the sacrifice at the prospect of feeling Draco’s bare chest against his own.

Draco twitched, only to be reminded of the warm, firm body under him, the press of chest against chest, stomach against stomach, hips against—
Draco pulls Harry's hips to his, lines himself up, and pushes inside his mate for the very first time.

It was a lovely sound; that laugh. And Draco had been the one eliciting it. The notion spread a pleasant warmth through his body. He swallowed. “Anyway, I don’t mind doing it. I like the neat and orderly columns of it all. It soothes me, I suppose.”
“And dragons, and war veterans, and the homeless. Yes.” Draco knew he sounded petty, but it was hardly his fault. He kept his gaze straight ahead, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes as he felt embarrassment heating his face.
I manage to stay away for all of twenty-three minutes before the mix of curiosity and concern gets the better of me. Heart pounding, I approach your closed door with caution, not sure of what I expect to find inside.
“Yeah. The man of my dreams, actually.”
.” It sounded as though he had to force the name past his lips. “It must be hard to spend the holiday with your fiancé in the hospital.”
Teddy’s hand slipped from his grip, and Harry blinked back to reality just in time to watch him run off towards the scene.
“Inside,” Draco demanded. “Now.” His voice was a low, deep rumble that went straight to Harry’s cock, making it twitch in anticipation.
Your guess is correct, Narcissa saved my life on the night of the final battle, lying straight to Riddle’s face, telling him I was dead when I wasn’t. If she hadn’t, he would’ve tried to kill me again, and although I should probably let her tell you about her motives herself, I know she did it because she was eager to get into the castle and find you, to make sure you were all right. Yes, I testified for her, but you don’t owe me anything, Malfoy. None of you does. Testifying for you both was the least I could do after you’ve both risked your lives to save mine. If anything, I’m the one indebted to you after what happened in that bathroom two years ago.
