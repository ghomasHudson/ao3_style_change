Hermione sighed. She knew that Harry and Malfoy had formed some type of bond in the few years they were Aurors together. While at first, she disapproved of their friendship, she also was not stupid to ignore that Harry had become less reckless ever since he was paired up with Malfoy. After two-week hospital stays became non-threatening bumps and bruises, she couldn't say that Malfoy's influence was bad. In fact, it was like Harry had been lifted out of a two-year slumber and had found something to live for again. It's why she too, prayed Malfoy made it through this, as she wasn't sure how Harry could take it, if anything happened.
"Mr. Potter... I really need to see the gash on your head.." the nervous healer stuttered "You'll probably need to stop by St. Mungos..."
-- he corrected himself in his head, Hermione's "he hasn't been elected yet Harry" ringing in his mind.
okay hopefully i update this in normal intervals
"Mr. Potter!!" a surprised healer said, "He won't calm down, we don't know what to do. We can't transport him like this" She started wringing her hands.
"So, are you going to do it?" Ron was eating an apple.
"I think so. At least it's accelerated for us, right? And Hermione will stop nagging me about staying home all day." Ron gave Hermione a pointed look.
NOVEMBER 13TH 2005 -- ST. MUNGOS HOSPITAL -- 5:47 AM
Hermione, sensing that she had gotten all she could from him thought for a moment. "Gold? That's unusual for a dark spell, if this was dark at all... I'll have to do some research, but in the meantime Harry, you need to get some rest. We're doing all we can to help him, but you can't help him in the state that you are. If we have any updates, I will call you.
Kingsley laughed, "Well anyway, I should get going. It was nice talking to you."
Tears started to form in Harry's eyes, "I know, but it'll be okay, okay? Just take some deep breaths, I'll be here the whole time. It'll be okay. Please Draco, you need to be okay." Harry knew the last statement was more of a plea, but he didn't know what he would do without him.
Hermione is on her way to being a campaign manager, and most likely second in command to the Minister, and probably Minister herself. Ginny has a coveted spot on her Quidditch team. Neville is the head of herbology research at Hogwarts, and Luna lectures at Hogwarts sometimes as well. What has he done?
"Hey... hey it's going to be okay." he brushed Draco's hair out of his eyes, and grabbed his hand, "Just take some deep breaths okay?"
Harry knew this was going to last either ten minutes or ten hours, and decided to call it a night. He texted Hermione-- she made them all get these new phones that worked in the wizarding world as well just in case they weren't able to contact each other in other ways-- and apparated to Grimmauld Place.
"Harry..." Hermione looked at him with something that bordered pity and concern, "You know I'm not allowed to tell you... patient confidentiality and all that"
"Well, if you're going to be working all the time with the campaign and the election that you're basically organizing yourself, then maybe it's better if I stay at home." Ron argued.
Omg... I cannot believe it has been 4 years to be honest I completely forgot I was even writing this (sorry Emma). This fic was supposed to be for my best friend... maybe I'll actually finish it now! I will say... I feel like my writing skills have declined in these 4 years :( Hopefully I can gain them back.
Draco squeezed his hand weakly, and Harry squeezed back harder. He took a few more minutes and had finally calmed down enough and had gotten control of his breathing.
"How is he?" Harry asked. His head was now bandaged, but he was still shaken by the events. All he saw was Malfoy-- no, Draco's blood. How did the case go so wrong?
“I’m going to … err, go see if Kreacher can bring us some biscuits? Perhaps an early tea?” Harry says unnecessarily loudly, his cheeks still red. He runs out of the room.
“Ugh, we have got to get out of here before I literally move all of my belongings into this beautiful home and demand that you raise me as your other child!” Jonathan exclaims, wiping at his eyes. “This family is simultaneously giving me life and taking it away with their adorable-ness!”
“Correct,” said Draco.
“Blimey, it’s hot in here!” He said, setting the bag down on one of the tables and taking off his coat.
I scoff. “I don’t suppose. I
“Call me Harry.” He grinned. “Please.”
Harry blushed and Draco rolled his eyes. “You have to promise to keep this a secret until tonight. I want you to swear an Unbreakable Vow, right now,” Draco declared.
“Just making sure the Notice-Me-Not charm is still up back there. It would cause a lot of questions if the neighbours noticed that we had a pet owl.”
Harry’s eyes rake over Draco and he clears his throat. “And you. Muggle clothing suits you.”
“Careful, Bobby,” Draco replies. “Harry might go into apoplectic shock at any talk of marriage.”
“Ugh,
“Holy fuck,
Harry thought,
“But Papa, if humans evolve to get rid of things that they don’t need on their bodies, then why do boys have nipples?” Draco was in the process of ushering Scorpius into the deli, and was relieved to find it empty, save for an elderly man and three children seated at a table near the window.
“Love you, Harry,” I say as he massages my poor, abused toes. Sometimes he makes it so easy for me to forget about the wet towels left on the bathroom floor and the half-drunk cups of tea strewn about our home.
“Oi, I’m right here!” Harry says, indignant. “And I think I’d quite like to marry you,
Draco looked up at Harry, his grey eyes shining in the moonlight. “I’m sure. Just go slowly.” Harry nodded and shuffled his knees up so that his cock was aligned with Draco’s hole, now shiny with lube. He pushed the tip in, just past the tight ring of muscle and into the warm depth of Draco. They both groaned, and Harry had to drop Draco’s legs so that he could lean forward and kiss him. Draco grabbed both of his legs behind the knees, opening himself further for Harry.
things, huh?]
“Shall we go see the rest?” Karamo asks, trying to herd Antoni, who is carrying Troglobite, towards the stairs. “We’ve got a lot more to show you!”
“They’re in your breast pocket. Anything noteworthy at school pickup, Saul?” Asked Harry, who had set about preparing tea.
“Love you, Draco.” Harry runs his fingers over the lace at the top of my stockings. “Hell of a Tuesday night.”
“Do you want me to stay?” Draco asked, his heart rate picking up at the idea of spending the afternoon with Potter.
Draco scoffed, suddenly remembering just how infuriating Potter could be. “Please. You literally saved not only the Wizarding World, but probably the muggle one as well. You made all the right decisions.”
Draco smiled at their reflections: he was on all fours, waiting for Harry to push into him. He bit his lip and watched as Harry took himself in hand and positioned his cock before entering him slowly.
Pansy had found Draco a new space for his potions laboratory, using her influence as one of the top grossing magi-realtors in London to net him “a truly magnificent loft in the trendiest part of London, darling. No one else has even heard the space is available for let, otherwise you’d not have a chance at it.” It was, much to Draco’s chagrin, absolutely perfect (and Pansy would never let him hear the end of it.) Hardwood floors with large windows well suited to ventilation, a direct Floo connection with his home office, and climate controlled storage. He’d had top of the line fixtures installed, and made sure to include a nook for his favourite muggle device: an espresso machine.
“I think I hate you,” Draco says. Jonathan just laughs loudly and Harry looks nervous.
“I need a second! I don’t know how these trousers are supposed to zip!” Harry calls.
“Stranger things, I suppose…” Draco says, smiling.
Potter finally turned to Draco, hand outstretched and eyebrows raised, a smile on his handsome face. Draco had watched in silence as his son interacted so easily with the man he’d been infatuated with since adolescence. But then, Scorpius hadn’t inherited any of his father’s neuroses; he could carry on a conversation with a brick wall.
Harry chuckled and bumped his shoulder against Draco’s. “Don’t do that. You don’t have to be an arse to cover up your discomfort,” Harry said, turning to look Draco fully in his eyes. “I mean all of it. I think you’re completely wonderful, yeah?”
, something I’ve only heard him do a few times in all our years together. He clears his throat and tries again. “So this is just...for me?”
“That’s our cue then!” Ron says. “Tedward, you and me and Hermione are going to the aquarium and then to Diagon to see what new gadgets your Uncle George has got on.”
“Allow me!” Draco says delightedly. He runs over to a wooden door and opens it dramatically. “Welcome to the cave of broken dreams. The worst-kept secret of the Wizarding World is Harry James Potter’s truly outrageous collection of old jumpers.”
“Fine. What do you want?”
“I’m an idiot, Draco.”
Draco shook his head. “Not romantic love. I love Astoria, but not in the way she loves her new wife.”
“To be fair, Harry, this is a common room, for all of us, so technically he’s allowed to be doing that here.” Hermione reached behind her and retied her hair into a bun at the nape of her neck. It was October, but the humidity had stuck around this year, causing her already unruly hair to further revolt from her attempts at reigning it in.
Albus walked over to Ginny and raised his arms, waiting for her to pick him up. She snuggled him close and Al leaned in, first giving her cheek a wet kiss and then moving to whisper in her ear. Ginny nodded at whatever Al had said, and gave him one more squeeze before setting him back down. “Listen to your father, my little monsters.”
“Harry, go make the spare mattress in the living room.”
Snape seemed to notice. “More Potter! Are you a delicate flower about to crumble over the easiest part of our job?”
They nod.
The old woman looked towards him.
“Not until we...
“Shut up Harry.”
“Just stay there, I’ll be an hour.”
“We can hear it in your voice.” Blaise drawled.
Harry seemed to grin mischievously.
“Not like that.” Ron pats at the dress and grumbles.
though. The one place that would have been suitable for friends and private enough for himself.
The last day of practise Ginny comes to watch him. She leans over the ropes as he practises.
Harry looks out the window. His first defence slips out. “...I’d never be good enough.”
Amos was the man Harry considered to be his actual dad. He's a miner too... or was one. It's hard to tell these days. Who walks the line, whose with the union. Big small words for big thing. Harry doesn't keep track of it. He kind of wished his Dad could go back into the mines, though he doesn't miss the actual consequences of Amos's job. There was too much yelling up top and a lot of police around.
There was a bonfire in those woods, had been before Draco and Potter had even arrived. The panic was slow to start, just the off smell of smoke had made him want to walk right back to the school alone and grumpy at his own hindrances.
“W—We go to a
Malfoy stood in his own internal debate before looking towards the other boy. “How did your mother die?”
Harry just rolls his eyes and smiles.
The other boy’s hair still somehow had that messy quality about it even with it snipped down tremendously. Draco’s eyes widened as he looked over Potter's forehead. Visible now Draco could see how like cracked porcelain the scar was jagged and eye catching and he couldn't find the sensibility to look away. Draco gulped and wondered how much it had hurt. Wondered what had happened.
Penny gasps before running over and smiling in relief. “Where were they?”
He looked at the shoes and back at Miss. He did like the shoes. They made him feel...elegant. He’d never say it out loud but there was a certain satisfaction in moving fast and walking silently.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had long since given up on trying to come to a conclusion about his opinions on the Malfoy boy. He was an annoying prat and he was almost sure they’d been close to becoming something along the lines of friends.
(I usually wouldn't include this as the chapter titles are songs but I really liked this selection so enjoy!)
Draco remembers the threat he’d told the other boy a year ago. He knows they’d both tried their weakest to avoid the other. Draco
“Harry! So good to see you— is everything alright! I hope everything's alright,
“She was sick.”
Potter was the child that made his blood boil the most. He looked so much like James. It made him sick to see. He was revolted in the fact that Harry wanted to be a dancer. Lilly never wanted to, so why was her son like this? Why was her son set on taking a passion his mother should have had?
Harry waited but no other boys came towards the door. “I better go up.”
“Hey!”
“Draco! You got tall.”
“You're not fooling anyone.” Snape drawled in his actual pretentious way that forced Harry to stillness around his corner.
“No...My Mother used to talk about it, about a lot of things. She liked old buildings, which is a good reason why she liked England so much.”
"No he wouldn't."
They practised the dance on weekends. He danced so much he felt as if his blood would burst from his body and his legs would cave under him. But they never did, and he never stopped. They played old time crap music and newer louder stuff. Classic and rock. Even some songs from musicals. Miss said it was broadening his musical palette.
He positioned his feet like he remembered and lifted his arms out. He was told to bend his knees and hold. He could feel them wobble slightly and he clenched his eyes shut.
(Going through some more editing. Didn't even realise my seventh chapter was still in the drafts. Rereading this makes me realise how fast paced the first two chapters are. I wont change this because I like the ballet school aspect of this story more but just beware. Go watch the movie if you want a better telling of this aspect of the story. Thanks if you enjoy though!)
Everington had a library. Well...It was more like a van filled with books but the sign in front did say library. He’d spent a few days looking at all the covers before finding a book about Ballet positions and movements. It seemed simple enough to follow so he tried to take it. Unfortunately he hadn’t been allowed to borrow it on a junior ticket.
Daniel nodded before leaning on the wall. “Tough.”
The man’s eyes went from Harry all along the line. It may have seemed normal to the other boys but Harry could tell he was looking from himself to Draco.
Ron looks at him through the mirror sadly. “When you going?”
He breathed out and did as he was told.
Draco's friends, that is true. The strings attaching the three boys together were completely conditional. They were
Malfoy seemed to scoff and Harry took that as a good sign.
Harry grinned despite his doubt.
“That makes no sense! I try just as hard as the others—”
“Oh sod off!”
The girl was maybe sixteen with straight blonde hair and rosy cheeks. She quickly overcame her surprise and produced a kind smile before bending down to grab her boxes. “Oh it’s alright, clumsy of me to walk around with these things in front of my face.”
It was nothing—just a particularly prominent event. The memory so to speak, moved.
“Yeah but like...Why?”
“What are you guys here for?”
The boy swivelled and Harry noticed his eyes start to water again and his shoulders start to quake. “That house Harry! I couldn’t stand to be there
The boy groaned before mumbling a “
don’t do the dancing. Not anymore.”
“Fred Astaire was your Mams favourite. Oh how we’d tap and dance our feet along with him to the tune.”
Warning: swearing- homophobic slurs (Not the F one) probably not historically accurate though I tried. I've never set foot in England and have no idea what the school was like in 1985 so oh well!
Draco had refused to follow into the clearing when they arrived. The flickering smokey monster kept by Blaise taunted him and Draco refused to even step where it’s horrible light touched.
“You should leave.”
She raised an eyebrow. Amusement clear. “Blob?”
She seemed to sniffle as well. “Harry, do you think you can promise one thing?”
“Those were my fathers gloves!”
Harry hurriedly walked off to fetch his water bottle letting his thoughts wander, during which he allowed his gaze shift to Draco. He wondered when the boy had taken the time to analyse his partner. He imagined Draco letting his own gaze wander just to describe the way
“I can
Dancers did a lot of hard work by the looks of it. It sounded like a pain. The body horror stories and warnings ever other page. Even so he couldn’t help but gaze in wonder at their elegant poses. Each dancer looked so defined and regal. Each photo was like a painting with perfect lighting and purposeful positions and Harry could only imagine the awe it must have been like in real life. He can picture how the movements would play out. It was breathtaking.
At the sound of his name, the dog lifts his head up and gives a little yip from where it’s laying on Jonathan’s lap.
Harry and Draco both open their mouths to speak, but Karamo holds up his hand. “Teddy, can you tell us more about that feeling?”
“Can Scorpius sleep over at our house?” Al asked Ginny, his hands clasped in front of him.
Scorpius’ expression brightened and he began, “I would like to give my time today to Albus Severus Potter, who will present the latest findings from our experiments regarding the growth of mold in a contained environment: in old jam jars underneath our beds.”
“Err…no?” Harry responds, unsure.
“Well I’d hope so, Mr. Potter-Lupin, you giant arse,” Jamie rolled his eyes and continued. “Well, DD found me crying in the kitchen. He asked what happened, and I was completely honest with him. He patted my hand, gave me a tissue, and left.”
Harry groaned and got to his feet, moving to bracket Draco’s lithe form with his own. “That’s right, Harry. I want you to cover my arse with your cum. Mark me. Make my arse yours.” The use of his first name, coupled with such filthy things coming out of that posh mouth made Harry groan and begin to pull on his cock in earnest. Malfoy pressed himself backwards, allowing Harry’s erection to slide between his spit-slicked cheeks.
[Jonathan confessional/interview: oh mama, that queen is spicy! Did you see the look Draco gave me when I called him Harold? Those two are as blind as their adorable little puppers Troggy if they honestly don’t think they’re both crazy in love with each other.]
Finally, Harry cast a mild cleaning charm over both of them and herded Draco over to his bed, leaving their discarded clothes in a mess on the floor.
His first morning in his new laboratory was spent carefully unpacking and painstakingly organising his ingredients into their proper order. He had a new order for his own variation on a Calming Draught to fill for St Mungo’s and the clippings from the tail of a Sphinx he’d managed to track down for the potion were exquisitely temperamental. A precise temperature and calm emotional environment were required to keep it stable: the mere suggestion of sarcasm or ill-timed pun and the delicate fur would burst into flames. Draco made sure to put up silencing charms around the package; he knew Pansy was likely to pop around at any moment and he was patently incapable of reigning in his snark around that woman.
Just then the doorbell rang. Harry took a deep, steadying breath. It was probably just Dudley, he told himself. He heard Saul make his way down the hallway to answer the door, so he returned to attempting to maintain the shape of the flourless chocolate cake he’d been trying to coax out of the pan.
“OK, papa. I want just a cheese toastie, then.”
“Eat your lunch, Draco,” Harry said as he began unpacking the contents of the bag he’d brought with him. He pulled out a styrofoam container and a spoon. “It’s matzo ball soup. I think you’re having a matzo ball soup emergency.”
I bite my lip and widen my stance, watching as Harry’s hands grip the robes even tighter.
“He said he would Jamie, and I’m sure he will.” Harry replied, wondering if the hero-worship that Jamie had for his godbrother would ever dissipate. “Now, give your mum kisses and hugs. You won’t see her until Thursday.”
Harry waved his hand dismissively. “Scorpius was perfectly well behaved. He even complimented my pancakes and told me that you’d should take cooking lessons from me.” He smiled.
“No! You know I like it a bit rough sometimes. Carry on.”
Harry smiled and shook his head. “I was jealous of you, then. You were so comfortable in the knowledge that you were a wizard, and that you were headed off to a boarding school that you’d been preparing for your whole life. And I just stood there, hoping you wouldn’t notice that I had no idea what was going on and that every time I saw someone perform magic I think I actually jumped a bit. And then we got to school, and you were a giant prat.” Everyone laughed. Draco blushed an even deeper shade of pink.
Draco blushed and he let a small, shy smile play at his lips. Harry walked forward and touched his fingertip to a drop of water that was clinging to a strand of Draco’s hair.
“You wish, Malfoy.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hips and thrust up, causing Draco to curse, “Oh, fuck!”
“Turns out, we’d both separately talked to Andy about taking custody of Teds, and she asked if we’d consider raising him together,” Harry interrupts. “She wanted him to be brought up with as much family around as possible. And so, six weeks later a toddler and two clueless idiots moved in here and somehow it worked out.”
Draco’s eyes shone with unshed tears and he nodded, slipping the band onto his left ring finger. “I love you, Harry Potter, you insufferable git. It’s been over two years now, so the oxytocin that filled your brain with lust has dissipated for the most part. I suppose if you’re still enamored of me, it must be true. Yes. Of course I’ll marry you.”
“I’m not sure how to sit in these trousers.” He replies. “Won’t I wrinkle them if I sit on the ground?”
“I mean, not really? Down in the training rooms, we keep it quite casual.”
, Potter. Chop chop!” Malfoy turned to grab his wand and pointed it at Harry, waiting for his approval to cast the charm.
“Are you joking? It’s better than OK! It’s brill! Getting you two to admit you’re in love was the secret reason that the Fab Five were here!”
. But yeah. Err, that’s great. For him. To wear those things.
“Hello, Harry,” Draco began, holding the wine out to him. “I thought we might turn up early and help you set up? I know the last time that mother hosted a dinner without the help of any House Elves she nearly had a nervous breakdown.” He smiled, and Harry melted.
“Err, I mean…” Harry’s eyes are open comically widely. “I forgot I have to...loo! Now!”
Cedric's friends call out to him. They ignore the noise.
For a quick moment, his mind ran faster than he could keep it in check. He pictured Draco. Draco in Penelope's place. The room dark with only one light on the dancer, an out line of shadows and beautiful movement and—
Draco hadn’t interacted with the girl much, he knew she was smart though. Top of all their general classes and seemed to take pride in how much of a teachers pet she could be, even though she seemed to break the rules when they didn’t suit her interest.
“Dad! What the fuck are you doing!”
"Yeah he would!"
Harry nodded to himself decidedly. Yes she was
! I just—”
girl. Harry could tell she knew how to dance, but only technically. She moved like a robot reciting words. She knew the moves, and could pull them off easily enough. it was as if she could remember how to do everything, but not why she had to do it, or as if she didn't understand. Hermione just always seemed so far away when she danced. It was like to her, this was just movement, a thing she had to do. She never seemed entirely present during the mixed gendered practise.
Draco wasn’t entirely cold hearted, there was an amount of respect for someone with no skills who still tried and had passion, but there was no passion in Hermione's eyes. No desire to dance and no desire to even be here. She offended the mere existence of his passion and that made Draco angry.
Harry made his way over to Ron’s house the next days afternoon. He didn’t know if his friend knew of the audition or not but he wanted to talk to him about it.
“Tiny curvature here.”
He waited until Cedric left the room before slowly following down the stairs.
He would practise next to Penelope nearly every day. She showed him the steps she was working on and he’d copy and fail and laugh. His steps weren't nearly as intricate and military as hers were but the dancing? The earth shook under them. With her it felt like the hopeful beginning he’d almost forgotten.
He remembered how sophisticated the classes had looked. There seemed to be no students with any faults. Brilliantly postured peers he was soon to meet.
The man peered at Harry for a moment before he reached into his trousers and pulled a handkerchief out. He passed it to Harry and said, “Matzo ball soup. That’s what you need.” He strode back over to the silver door and pushed it open, sticking his head in and shouting, “Sophia! We have a matzo ball emergency!” With the man’s back turned Harry took the opportunity to wipe at his eyes with the cloth, feeling both grateful and embarrassed. A moment later a petite old woman wearing a floral dress and a blue apron came rushing out of the door. She was wiping her hands on the apron as she came behind the counter, speaking a language Harry didn’t know. “Ton nit shrayen in mir alter kaker!”
[The Fab Five’s black SUV pulls up in front of row houses on a pleasant street in Islington. It’s a gray but dry London afternoon in early Spring. A sharply dressed woman with big, bushy hair bursting out of a messy bun stands next to a tall, lanky redhead. The two greet the Fab Five as they get out of the car.]
Had kissed him and then promptly apologised, looking horrified with himself for having stooped so low.
“Harold, my love, come to the bathroom!” Jonathan calls from outside the bedroom. “We need to talk about your beauty regimen.”
“Sure! Let’s go, little man,” Karamo says, leading Teddy to the table. “I prefer to chop veggies the no-maj way. I think they always have a funny taste if you use spells.”
“After I kissed you, you looked...well, you looked like you were in pain. You’d put your hand on my chest and drawn back, and I assumed you’d wanted me to stop. Honestly, Draco, you looked like you’d rather have been kissing a toad. And then I remembered what you’d told me last week, that you’d been in love with someone since you were fifteen. That you knew that you’d only ever fall in love once in your life, and you’d already done it. And then I’d gone and told you to just go for it before acting like a complete arse and kissing you.” Harry uncrossed his arms and looked at the floor. “In that moment, I thought that I’d crossed a line, that you’d made up your mind to pursue a relationship with this bloke and I’d kissed you without your permission.”
“Don’t mind him, Tan, he’s just cranky because he owns no Muggle clothing beyond the pajamas Teddy got him for Christmas last year and he’s been forced to wear my things,” Harry explains.
“You fiend.” Draco grabbed a clean mug and filled it, adding just a splash of milk. He handed it over with a wink.
Draco looks completely lost. “Is this a joke?”
Harry felt like he had completely lost the plot, and was a bit nervous that he had somehow walked into a situation that would lead to him sleeping on the pullout couch in the living room. “What are you on about? You had every right to be angry with me. When I got that owl, I should have immediately talked to you about it.”
“Al and Scorp said they needed to check on a ‘speriment when we got home, and Jamie is probably writing to Teddy,” Lily replied.
“You’re in Shoreditch, love,” replied Sophia, standing up with Harry. “I’ll pack you some more soup to take home with you and Saul is going to call you a taxi. You look dead on your feet!”
Ron swallowed. “Listen, mate,” he began, a serious expression on his face. “I know we’ve had our troubles in the past. I never liked you, and I’ve always been jealous of your easy friendship with Hermione. You two operate on a different field than the rest of us mere mortals.” Draco raised his eyebrows, taken aback at the honesty Ron was doling out.
Draco lifts one eyebrow and cocks his head. “You’ll do, I suppose.” A small smile plays at his lips despite his haughty expression.
“We’re not done yet!” Bobby responds. “Follow me, gentlemen!”
“I love him! He’s so adorable. We’re bonded for life.” Antoni continues to snuggle the dog, who is now licking his face excitedly.
He reaches his hand into the pile, grabbing at random. “Aha! Look at these…” Harry breaks off with a choking sound. He’s brandishing a pair of lacy red knickers.
Harry knew Saul and Sophia didn’t have children of their own, and he often wondered if he was filling a hole in their life as much as they were filling one in his.
“There were some, err, complicated things that happened during the war that let me see Draco in a different light.” Harry rubs the back of his neck. “And when I was outed by the press about two months after the trials ended, Draco was the only other gay person I knew of. He helped me deal with a lot of the fallout, and we got much closer.”
Tan makes a noise somewhere between a groan and a yelp. “Draco sodding Malfoy is the epitome of a bad boy. Incredibly posh with the cheekbones of a god, but his family was into some terribly dark business during the war eight years ago so he was persona non grata until Harry vouched for him over and over again in the press. I guess those two have gone from arch nemeses to forbidden lovers!” Tan puts the back of his hand to his forehead dramatically. “Honestly, this is like my teenage fantasy come to life! I get to make sure Harry Potter’s bum looks fantastic in a pair of trousers!”
things) she had decided she wanted to help mould young minds. And so, in the hottest April England had seen in generations, she led all twelve of her Eighth Years into the field to work on a dig aimed at identifying a wizarding burial ground from the tenth century CE. They were to use muggle archaeological methods, resorting to magic only when necessary to break through charms or curses placed on any graves.
“It’s not my fault that I come from such refined stock! You should be so lucky to have access to the sort of knowledge that’s been passed down to me from generations of Malfoys.”
Teddy smiles at Harry, who’s gone to sit on the sofa next to Draco. Harry grins back and motions for him to go on. “Remember to take a breath there, Teds.”
Ginny walked into the kitchen, eyebrows raised. “Malfoy! What’re you doing here?” Her tone wasn’t unkind, but it wasn’t quite warm, either.
work?”
“Oi! Mate! Ever heard of KNOCKING?!” Ron’s face was as red as Harry had ever seen it.
Antoni has several photos fanned out in his hands and tips them so Bobby can see. “I can see where Harry has room for improvement in his fashion choices… actually, it seems like they could both do with a wardrobe update, if the photos that Hermione sent along are anything to go by. Draco is sporting those old-fashioned robes that I’ve only seen septuagenarians wear in all of these pics!”
“Mazel tov to Harry and Draco!” Saul called out, raising his wine glass in the air.
“Erm, thanks, Malfoy.”
[Harry interview/confession: I’ve never given much thought to what I wear. But I do want to be taken seriously at work. There’s an opening once Lead Instructor Gerritson retires next year, and I don’t want to be passed over because of my ripped denims. I suppose Karamo and Tan have a point.
“What, pray tell, did you actually see in there?”
“The kids will be home any minute. You know we don’t have time,” Harry sighed and let the strands of Draco’s hair slide through his fingers, enjoying the texture and the contrast between the corn silk locks and his tan, calloused hand. He tried to straighten up from where Draco had him pinned against the counter, but his progress was hindered by long, insistent fingers that were wrapped around his narrow hips.
Harry tried to catch his oldest son’s eye, but Jamie kept his gaze resolutely on the table. Harry took a deep breath and began, “in any case, there isn’t anything wrong with being gay! Draco is gay. I’m bisexual. Auntie Luna is pansexual! We’ve talked about this before. Love is love, regardless of gender - or lack thereof - of those involved.”
our son.”
“Is that a wand in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?”
Harry’s hands were still on Draco’s hips, but his thumbs were tracing slow circles where his pelvic bone stuck out from his body. “Are you OK?”
Tan sits on a chair outside of the fitting rooms. “OK boys, time’s up! Show me your first outfit.”
Teddy giggles and jumps up, clapping. “Presents!” he shouts again, the sugar from the cake clearly fueling his sudden surge in energy.
Ron snorts. “A bit?”
Sophia rolled her eyes. “Saul doesn’t read The Prophet - and for good reason, look at the lies they print! - but I don’t live in the Wizarding World anymore so I had to get information from somewhere, fershtay? But we know. I told him all about you, about what a mensch you’ve been!”
Harry chuckles. “It’s been fantastic! I had the first positive clothes-shopping experience of my life yesterday, and I think my relationship with Teddy has already improved. Karamo is truly amazing.”
“Oh yes, mama! Someone call Brittney because oops I did it again!” Jonathan twirls the chair around so Harry can see the results of his cut.
Harry turns his head and gasps, then starts coughing. His cheeks darken.
“Well, I…” Draco looks at the camera, his expression morphing to cool indifference. “I don’t see how this is relevant! My relationship with Harry is between the two of us, not with all of the viewers of this ridiculous show.”
“Don’t ask stupid questions! Of course, they’re mine. They’re in my armoire, which you blasted open like the brute that you are!”
“Oh, sorry Mr. Harry! Thank you for having me. Can we go now?” Scorpius looked between the adults, who both nodded. Draco sighed.
“Well, I suppose we should begin with this ‘makeover,’ then. What exactly does this entail? I warn you, I have little patience for shenanigans and I won’t be signing any waivers without my solicitor’s consent.” Draco stands glaring at the four men who are still standing, his arms folded across his chest.
“Why else would you have sex if you can’t make a baby?” Lily had stopped her doodles to pose this question, giving the room her full attention.
Hermione threw her head back and laughed, her whole body shaking with mirth.
Harry pulls at the heels roughly, falling backwards slightly when they come off of my feet.
Harry put his head in his hands, completely mortified. Sharing a tent with Hermione last year had resulted in a few awkward naked moments - inevitable, really, given the size of the tent and the amount of time they’d spent in it.
Draco spins a bit and makes a pleased sound. “My arse does look fantastic in these trousers.”
“I have to admit, Malfoy, that’s not what I’d expected you to say. But if that’s all you have to say to me, then no, I don’t want to discuss anything with you. Please bugger off. I’ll look into the potions.”
Malfoy looked up from where he was viciously scrubbing some particularly resistant mud from a large ceramic fragment. “I… well, I suppose I could look into it…” Malfoy trailed off, looking both pensive and yet somewhat annoyed. “Of course you’d have some sort of idea. Bloody Saviour.” The left side of his mouth quirked up in a small smile, and he pointed his toothbrush at Harry. “You never answered my question about you and Girl Weasley. I thought you’d have struck up again with her by now.”
memories. No past. All he could possibly draw from is stills. His past lined up in images. Photographs of the mind though they all seem so distant.
Lucius Malfoy stood facing the window of his office and the early morning sun left nothing but his silhouette for Draco to see.
. We’re going to bow in front of a crowd and revel in applause, you got it?”
He played he kitchen like and instrument. A game he could predict with every move. He was quite proud of his ability to catch flying toast on a plate. He kept this particular skill to himself though. He was sure his Dad wouldn’t find it too funny and Cedric would just roll his eyes like he had better things to worry about.
Harry couldn’t help but speak. “My mother's name was
Ron smiled. ”I think that means she believes in you.”
“Draco.”
Harry grins before his eyes waver towards the clock, he’s supposed to be on stage in five minutes.
Harry met some of the girls eyes when he looked up and tried to back himself out. “Miss the keys.”
This struck as Harry’s curiosity and he promptly spoke into the phone. “Hello?”
“I’ll miss you.”
He frowned as he watched them dance. They were smooth and their eyes never left the other boys unless to turn, they worked together like a well oiled machine and they didn't even know it. Snape's not sure how it happened, He’d given them the hardest moves and somehow behind his back they’d formed an alliance, broken down each mistake they'd once made and eradicated them.
"Get over it old timer. The words changing and I won't be letting no pigs stop that."
Draco wondered if Dean regretted inviting him.
“You're still laughing!” Potter's voice didn’t waver of his annoyance which only prompted Draco’s fit more.
. There all too wuss, but loads of men do. Their proper athletes you know, much better than your boxing anyway.”
That was to be expected in most, children hardly remembered early childhood. Even expected things could not be embraced. This just made him feel odd. He was a puzzle with missing pieces. It was as if he had
in the dark though there was no actual evidence towards that.
seep into his bones like a prediction.
Harry tries to call the Weasleys. "Miss! I can't make the audition!"
Harry let himself smile and look up towards the ceiling. “Cause your stubborn, and you’d never miss an opportunity to watch me trip over my feet.”
“Don’t be mistaken. I’m talking to you about this for the benefit of my class, this school…and
Harry can’t remember a time he hadn’t danced with purpose or whatever his teacher meant.
“When's the letter gonna come?”
He found himself amongst the similar group of his year on the unused basketball court. Harry, Dean and Seamus were huddled in the shade from the basket hoop's back though every few minutes they were forced to move an inch as the shadow itself moved along.
Draco didn’t have time to sit confused before she walked off.
Letting this chapter into the world to never read again~
“You have a brother right?”
“Don’t sneak up on me like some stalker! Unless you plan on
“Now, I’m sure most of you all know who I am but I have a slight
Ron shrugged but answered.  “There using downstairs as a soup kitchen for the miners. Moody’s letting Mum have half of the boxing ‘all.”
She seemed to roll her eyes but he couldn’t see. “Not everything is about ballet you know. I swear you dancers only think about music and moves.”
Her head shot up. “What?”
“It's three o’clock.”
His mother said one of his cousins had done it. Picked up his uncle's empty beer bottle and smashed it right on Harry's toddler forehead. It was in the before times so he didn’t remember it but his mother had told him he was lucky to be alive. He was even luckier to still have his eyesight.
He pushes open the stall door to face her. “You don’t even have a proper dancing studio! You just pick on me because you fucked up your own life!”
Molly looked disapprovingly at both of them. “If you're not coming you can give me back those shoes.”
They stood outside the hall and turned to each other. She had a small grin on her face.
“Shove it.”
“You seem to not know a lot of shite.”
He didn't though, for reasons he could not quite explain he didn’t.
“Wha—”
“Bring Draco here then, this place will be free tomorrow. Bring the music an practise here.”
Holy shit this took me three weeks to write and I'm still not happy with it but I'm tired and can't progress until this is done. Sorry if there are any mistakes and I hope I didn't do Draco too dirty.
She continued. “As you all probably know. The number of students has increased so we will be having
He comes home to find everyone seated around the table. Even grandma seems aware of what’s happening. The letters there, leaned up against the salt shaker. He stares at it for a moment. Cedric wipes his sweaty hand on his apron and looks away. The letters unopened.
She sighed. “That’s just a matter about a trip to London. I can pay the fare.”
"I don't know yet." Harry sighed. "It's just... my life is so different from how I thought it would be... I don't know what I'm meant to do anymore." He thought of Ginny, they were still best friends, but they broke up about six months after the war, realizing they weren't really meant for each other. He thought of Hermione and Ron who were now engaged, he knew they were still "The Golden Trio" but he felt left out sometimes, was that a bad thing?
"I don't know... are you?" Harry countered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Kingsley sighed, "Well, you'll figure it out. Just know that I'd be honored to have you on my team."
Harry ignored him, and stumbled to the group of healers struggling with someone a little bit away. He saw the blond hair tainted by dirt, and immediately knew.
"Do you happen to remember what spell they used? The color of the spell?" Hermione asked Harry patiently. She knew this could trigger a meltdown, but she also knew any information could be the difference between life or death for Malfoy.
And then he remembered-- Draco.
He stares at the piles of letters on his dining table, and makes a decision. He knows he should probably think about it more, but it's the one thing that he'll be able to do that was "expected." He quickly pens the letter and sends it away,
"No.. I--" Harry thought for a moment. He closed his eyes, something he had been doing ever since Draco decided they would have daily mindfulness sessions to increase their focus (He'd have to tell Draco that they don't work, if-- no when-- he gets through this) and tried to gather himself. "It was gold... I just remember them saying something to me, and a jet of gold light hitting Draco... and then..." Harry held back tears. He can't think about this right now.
MAY 2ND 1999 -- LOCATION: HOGWARTS -- TIME: 11:00 PM
He had been hit by a spell he never had heard before and Harry had immediately called for backup. The wizards responsible had fled the scene, and the backup had arrived almost immediately after.
"Maybe you forgot Kingsley-- uh I mean sir-- that you're Minister of Magic, not Head Auror anymore." Ron had appeared out of nowhere, and had slung an arm around Harry's shoulder. Harry smiled at his friend's antics.
"So, have you considered the offer?" Kingsley pushed Harry out of his thoughts and handed him a drink. He was the Minister of Magic--
Draco looked at him and struggled some more with his breathing. "...Hurts." His breathing became less uneven, but it was still labored. Every breath was hard for him, and tears started rolling down his face. He struggled with his breathing again, and tried to even it out.
Minister of Magic" Hermione appeared as well, and slapped Ron's shoulder. She then noticed Kingsley, "Not that that's a bad thing by any means! Just that if we're to have any sort of democracy established it should be made clear that an election is going to--"
A healer had arrived to see him just then, but he still needed to see Draco.
Harry didn't want to go, but he knew Hermione was right. So he went back to Grimmauld Place, and for the first time in years, it seemed as dark as it was before the war.
Harry thinks about what he's done with his life since the war. Granted, it's only been a year, so he shouldn't feel bad if he hasn't done much, but why does he feel so useless then?
"I'm coming with you. I won't leave him." Harry said. The healer looked at him with understanding in her eyes, and they apparated away.
Harry watched the people laughing and dancing and drinking, and couldn't help but wonder how everyone else was able to move on so quickly when he was still stuck in the past. It was the first anniversary of the war, and the wizarding world had been steadily recovering from the war. Hogwarts didn't show a trace of the war-- save for the tributes in honor of those lost-- and everyone seemed to be recovering together. All funds from the gala would be donated to the "Children of the War Fund" that was set up by Hermione to help young kids who lost parents or family in the war.
Ron regained his composure. “Are you any good? Ginny won’t tell me.”
to stand out Draco.”
like sports days. He'd huff and turn red and once he'd even coughed up blood. This meant every time they ran on the grounds he'd pull them away to skip. Harry didn’t feel the need to force his only friend to go through any pain, so he followed.
“Speaking of seniors. Penelope Clearwater is waving at you.”
you dolt.
“I’m transferring...to Mayville’s School for Girls.”
Harry huffed but didn’t seem annoyed. “Don’t be a dick.”
He didn’t expect much. She wouldn’t be the only friend to give up on calls.
Dean smirked. “We'll most likely be doing some sports stuff and… Let's just say he’s not the most athletically inclined person.”
One of the twins giggled. “Aren’t you always?”
“She must have been pretty.”
He bent his knees. It was the balance he was sure. His balance was off.
Lucius had indulged Draco. Figured it was a phase or some obscure hobby. Draco barely left that room.
“Well, that too. Even so there some sort of niche in which you move, I’m sure learning in a class of girls and then practising with that senior last year added to it”
. The room was painted with old orange light which shone through the slow floating dust particles amongst the cold air. If any one else had seen them they might have yelled. Called them all sorts of names. Harry couldn't see the sight as anything less than it was. It was a warmth filled magnificence. The making of certain type of memory he knew would hold great nostalgia one day. Like when one first learns to ride a bike or feel the grass in spring. It was something that filled Harry with warmth and dread, knowing he may never feel like this again. Knowing he can never truly dance the way he craves.
Penelope seemed to turn from cheerful and fun to royal and cold in a matter of seconds. Harry hadn’t noticed the movements of the song until she performed.
“Harry Evans Potter Diggory... All these boys shall meet in room 14. The rest of you all 19 and 20.”
He was blonde with quite a pointed face and the greyest eyes Harry had ever seen. His body fit his leotard quite well and he seemed to have perfect posture. Harry almost despised it. He looked nothing like Harry.
, Skeeter Davis.”
Draco let himself hum and look at the reflection of Potter in the plastic he stared at.
She seemed to look afraid before looking offended. “What do you know? You're just some pompous rich kid thinking the world revolves around what you want.”

“I don’t know why people care so much.”
to take normal school classes to graduate but it did make him feel a little sour. Harry had never been an academic mind. Even still he did wonder what it would be like having dancing be his main activity of the day.
"No one would Harry it's hilarious."
Draco had stopped trying to keep his distance the moment he saw Harry walk up to the landline for the second time. He stopped trying to avoid sections of the rooms he knew Harry liked to dance in and ultimately Draco was aware he himself was the one to blame for their close proximity.
“Because you call me Potter.”
Harry had never met such a… posh kid before. He wondered what kind of thoughts he must have reasoned with to think that something so small before they were even accepted really mattered. But then again… Draco did seem to be knowledgeable about their art so maybe it
Draco seemed to find it within himself to intervene. “I doubt it, We've only just begun really. They’ll probably start that next year when they're convinced
Draco told the truth. “He was my dance partner this year. Things were a little amateurish at first but we really stepped up our game and he loves to dance just as much as I do. I can’t bear to go without my biggest competitor and equal. If there's a problem I’ll come to you but please Father, let it be.”
Cedric almost smiles. “The best.”
Harry can’t help but smile.
“—Just ask Harry.”
“There will be no abhorrent posture in my class Mr Potter. As such I expect proper manners and dance etiquette amongst all of you. Any
“Potter it’s fire. It’s a pretty normal thing to have distaste for. It's hot, it hurts and it’s dangerous. It’s like asking why you don't like...w—what don’t you like again?”
Ethereal... Harry found he could get used to hearing that.
He fell once again. Thankfully he was caught before his shoulder hit wood.
Harry doesn’t answer. “D—Do you think being a ballet dancer would be better than being a miner?”
He scrunched up his face but complied.
“Do you need bus fare?”
Cedric raised an eyebrow. “Audition?”
Dean groaned. “Already talking about dance strategies?
Cedric's friend had the sense to lend them a few blankets and he was glad when Harry had no objections to sharing the backseat.
Harry could flinch at his own thoughts. He blamed his newfound knack of analogies and big words a symptom of listening to Draco for two years. Harry was sure to keep these in the other boys words 'suspiciously poetic’ inner dwellings to himself as he was sure no one would find amusement in his false pretentiousness rubbed onto him like mud on his shoes.
He was almost four hours away from home and it was almost dark out.
They walked along in silence for a bit. Harry couldn’t tell if he liked Seamus or not. He seemed alright but he kind of reminded Harry of a happier upbeat oblivious Ron.
. The muscles in their legs were so defined and they were all very lean and could seem to easily pick up the ballerinas with their powerful arms. He started at the picture for a little longer than felt normal. Harry blushed.
Wistfully watching his classmates was fastly becoming a new hobby of Harry’s. He can’t say he had quite the knack for analysing that Draco did but he did find there was something to be gained from the act. His year was quick and fun, it seemed everyone was fast paced, goofy and determined. A mix that made Harry laugh and his new partner scoff. They were all different amongst their sameness, and it was nothing but peculiar. Harry could imagine the laughs Ron or Ginny would give him at the disclosure of his new hobby so he never spoke of it even though their calls fall rarely to twice a term.
reconnect the landline then."
He grew in anger in the fact that Harry barely flinched at his criticism anymore, never reacted with more than an eye roll when Draco pointed out a flaw.
. I heard your mother was quite successful in her prima days, money aplenty. Do us all a favour and stop trying to be her.”
Draco was almost sure Snape was trying to torture him. No, he was positive. Somehow any time a demonstration needed to be made the man never failed to pull up both Draco and Potter to the front to perform his instructions.
on. Ron looked side to side quickly before pulling him inside.
“I have a friend who puts on makeup and wears dresses.”
Daniel smiled proudly. “She’s good isn’t she.” It wasn’t a question.
“...Well I'd never miss an opportunity to watch Potter humiliate himself.”
to be utilised.
He’s allowed to join in on dance classes. Miss says that if he can help out the younger girls he can join in for free. She calls it an exchange. He calls her lazy.
Even with his new found company the halls of White lodge echoed inside Harry’s ears and called on him like an explorer to a tomb. Of course Harry was certain there was no hallway, no corner, no room of the lodge that he hadn’t encountered before. Nevertheless one doesn’t ignore the call of a siren.
“He stopped you from coming.”
“Fuck.”
“Mr Potter, could you please enlighten us. What does it feel like when you dance?”
The boy stood at the barre as he looked back and forth between each Patil twins. Padma looked stoic as Parvati seemed to be talking seriously, all the while Potter listened intently.
“I’m at the Cathedral. I don't know where to go.”
, He leaped like gravity was a mere word to him and his strawberry freckled limbs moved with such tremendous decorative movements Harry could blush.
Draco hit the floor in a dignified thud. The other boys didn’t hide their laughter as Draco wallowed in his own embarrassment.
Harry slowly picks it up. It's light.
He nodded. Amos side eyed him from his chair in front of the judges.
Malfoy frowned. He looked angry and Harry remembered he was supposed to look angry too.
“He’s a swan…” Draco’s eyes widened when he realised that he himself had spoken up.
She looked him up and down before speaking. “Harry.”
she mumbled her movements before speaking again.
A short series of scenes including Draco Malfoy's experiences during his second year.
“Draco? How'd you have this number?”
“What’s it about?” Potter asked.
It was her turn to scoff offhandedly.
He sits himself in the hall. His school bag forgotten on the ground next to him. He tears the envelope slowly open and braces himself before reading.
“It’s an emergency.”
Draco looked back confused. The woman didn’t spare him a look before speaking. “Follow me.”
Malfoy snapped his head up. “Snap in time with me! Not Dean!” he snapped his fingers for extra emphasis.
Malfoy pointed over towards the door. Harry looked to find that Penny was in fact waving him over frantically. He nodded quickly before muttering a “see you.” and rushing over to her.
He shook his head. “The school. You don’t want to be here. Leave.”
He sat down under the barre exhausted. He’d handed Miss his money and was sitting their huffing while tying his boots.
She didn’t though. She went back to class, laughed quietly at Seamus’s jokes, let Draco sit under her umbrella once more. He waited and she never spoke a word.
“That sounds really weird.”
“How do you know?”
Harry wonders if he could work in a joke shop, he likes jokes and maybe a fun filled life would be cool. He thinks about it long enough to find he hates the idea. The thought of dealing with business and customers and having his life revolve around juvenile jokes. He sighs. He's been thinking of other paths for his future and they all seem to repulse him.
Harry stepped on the boy’s shoe, though it was a bit of an awkward effort as they hadn’t been standing particularly close.
The book said what they were doing was a pirouette, or at least the kid version of one.
Seamus seemed to look Harry up and down. “Where abouts are you from Harry?”
“—I’m not just going to follow you.”
Amos starred at the half filled trolley. It mocked and taunted at him and he could almost feel the imaginary stares of the other shoppers. He was glad no one at home complained about how little food they had. He wished they did, because that left no one else complaining but him.
He could smile to himself. A dancer, a soloist. There was no going back. The school had let him in with open arms even after his fuck up and now he was starting his travel down the long road to the future.
Penelope was amazing where Daniel was enthralling, and his heart skipped a beat every time he saw them.
Seamus didn’t falter. “That’s weird.”
“Harry. What a surprise.”
like was the punching part. He didn’t really know why. The other boys looked like they had fun when they did it. God knows Harry would love to pay back the times all the other boys had hit him.
. He could tell she was and it
“Is there anything on your mind?”
He smiled and winked with good nature in his eyes. “Have fun, go dance.”
Harry shrugged. “You refuse to go near the stuff, I figured there might be something bigger there.”
Harry didn’t know how long he thought he could get away with it. Most days Cedric and Amos were on strike, he never thought they’d bother to check where Harry was.
He nodded, feeling his thoughts clench.
Harry gulped. “What happened to Draco?”
Harry backed up to look over his friend. For that moment he felt like he was seeing in third person. Seeing
Harry doesn’t like to think about the strike, he doesn’t know much about it other than the police and the food… and the fifty pence he’s not allowed anymore. He doesn't think about it because everyone talks about it, all the while no one
“Oh and you have better?”
happened. Nothing noteworthy anyway. He couldn’t say much about it really. But the memory stuck. Very specific details like it was all important. He could picture how the room looked in the afternoon light, remember how sweat glistened off of nearly everyone in the hot hall.
we need you up in the air.”
teach you ballet. They just need to know how you move. Express yourself.”
repertoire. You all are growing and changing and now more than ever is the time to introduce your core skills.”
The five boys stood in a line in front of the barre. Harry couldn’t stop himself from leaning forward slightly to gaze at Draco, who was lined up all the way at the end while Harry had placed himself near the door. The blonde was looking ahead sharply and his eyes didn’t waver towards Harry.
“Guess so.”
the closest things he had to cousins though. He’d known them all his life but only due to the facts that their respective parents were politicians.
Draco regretted this suggestion when the two started aiming marble at his feet. “
“Jeez Potter, give her some more dignity than that.”
He touched the back of her shoulder slowly but she still jumped in surprise. She looked at him like he was a stranger.
“—Well I call you Potter because Snape does. It’s your name isn’t it.”
“She doesn’t know. Wanna try my mums?” Ron held out a long floral thing.
to do it?”
“You’ll get cold.” His voice turns soft.
“Don’t wait for me.”
“Parents mostly, some companies will be out there though, watching the older years and looking out for any promising talent to keep tabs on.”
Harry looked towards the window. “To go to ballet school.”
“I don’t like Ballet.”
Silence. and then a beep.
Amos banged on the table. Cedric shouted. Amos yelled. Harry didn't cry.
He complied as an assistant led him towards it. “Left hand on the barre.”
Harry’s eyes widened. Her pointe shoes had been one of the most expensive transactions he’d ever heard of.
“Oh! One more thing Harry!”
“I hope you break a leg.”
Ginny throws a pillow at him. Harry laughs in surprise. He snatches the next one from her grasp and pummels it towards her face. If it had been a fist she’d have a bloody nose. She snorts as the pillow puffs against her face.
“Feet first, Arms second.”
"whatever you say Luna."
Harry peeked round the corner to see Cedric holding a hammer.
“The school silly. I haven't been doing ballet for long. I don’t want to start out too far behind.”
He chuckles. “You and Ron both.” He looks towards the mirror and ponders. “Who do you thinks better? Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers?”
“H—Potter…”
...Ginny walked along the street with him. She always seemed to find an excuse to walk him places. Back then he didn't bother to notice. A stick she'd found knocked against weather damage posters and found its way against a wall of police shields. It was strange how easy everyone had adjusted to the sight of it. The men didn't pay them much attention. A couple may have grunted.
It looked like a caste, or a mansion. A ground that beckoned him to come forward. Harry could picture the queen walking out, or a group of dancers that actually did.. He’d known a school this would be but it still somewhat shocked him. It was one of those places that were so fancy it had a name.
She nodded and walked off. She didn’t smile but Harry felt she might have wanted to.
“Well...Let's go then! Grab your shoes!”
“That was reckless. Do you know what happens to kids who stay out alone at night, especially so far from home.”
“I can’t do it!” He shouts even as the words pick at his heart.
Harry struggled to keep his back straight as he stretched out his leg. He watched the others boys who seemed to mangle their bodies in stretches and Harry stared bewilderingly at them.
Draco could have sworn Harry growled at him but the sound of the school's bell echoed and beckoned them to assembly.
It was frightening to look at from the inside. He was damn sure the windows would bust in. The screaming and the chanting and the fists and stones against the window. A few strikers got past police and made their way closer to the bus.
Harry didn’t wait much longer before he shrugged off his instructions and made his way past the mirrors to Mrs Weasley.
They had been in a car. Harry hadn’t known how old he was at the time but thinking back he would guess around three or four. His Mother had been crying. Sobbing in the front seat. her crying had wavered frequently and her pale hands had covered her face. It was dark out. The world didn't exist outside the car. His Father had just died...he hadn’t known that either. In the end not remembering was probably for the best.
He looked towards his oldest son. “You notice anything weird about Harry?”
She smiles. “Look Harry. It’d be an awful lot of hard work. Are you sure you're willing?”
“No well—His mother was. God rest her soul. That’s who he gets it from.”
sound. A loud and confident song that begged for his attention till the last pirouette. It let him for a moment pretend that he was the cold and confident noise and not the Amateur he’s sure he was. He could make himself at home in synchronised footwork.
He assumed she was Parvati as she was the one with the fortune to see him in general classes. “When do classes start again?”
She was intricate and graceful and easily switched from calm to panic as the melodies moved her limbs like puppet strings. She was supple and eerie. At first a flute flowed her posture and there was almost a scared innocence about her. That was until the music became louder and an orchestra of french horns and trombones bombarded his ears with powerful sounds, then she too became
Harry heard the telltale sign of a punch. He stayed still and watched Cedric check his nose for blood in shock before grunting and barging his way to the door.
Harry frowned.
Movie section part 2~ A lot more original scenes here than the movie but still mostly based on that, everything from this chapter on will be original story. Not sure how long the other chapters will be because the first one was pretty long and this is a little shorter so we'll see.
“Fuck off.”
“I got permission...just not from Snape.”
“Well lets hope it gives us some extra strength.”
“Why did you lie to your dad?”
“There's no mines in London.”
“She shouted first!”
Draco was fine with the cold. He was an Englishman after all. “Fuck off! Go play soccer or something!”
Ron shrugged. “Well it’s better than boxing.”
Amos's tears fall on Cedric's shirt. "Lilly wouldn't have stopped him."
Draco let out a curious glance. “The group?”
will affect our final decision.”
Harry didn’t follow this advice. He didn’t follow it because Malfoy was always mean, and was always surrounded by empty space.
Draco rolled his shoulder. “Practise, ever heard of it?”
maybe the most graceful dancer in their year. If anything he should be described as feminine.
“No time!”
He looks up at her. “Yeah?”
“London? Would you have to
“She’s a girl!”
He didn’t utter a word when he found Dean sobbing in the bathroom, whose tears were probably not connected to Seamus and Lavender's clumsy public displays of affection. He only let out a little snicker when Hermione punched a wall in frustration during a particularly difficult dance.
Potter seemed amused at this and reached out to drag Draco along further. “C’mon let's go—”
to himself before waiting for his teacher. Harry almost laughed but listened in interested, he’d never heard of this before but it seemed to make sense.
Harry holds his legs in his arms. “Nah, by myself.”
to move.
had this when
Malfoy looked downwards. “How’d you know?”
Draco thinks he’s destined to love the things that hurt. His father, his mother, his dance. His fascination and love for the ballet that stretched his limbs and tortured his bones was enough proof of his little theory.
Harry wrought much reason found himself on her side of the bar. He followed the movements of girl in front of him, she was much better than Ginny but much harder to follow. He was trying to replicate her straight pointed foot but his boots didn’t seem to want to bend that way. His feet squeaked pleasantly along the ground and a few girls turned their heads to stare. He felt uncomfortable with the noise.
Harry heard the music as he and Malfoy began to dance. The movements were slow, ceaseless and fancy. There was no agonising silence and no berating. Malfoy fell into his movement. Harry wondered if they were supposed to be cool or sensual. It was tad awkward and weird as words of love and some deep metaphor surrounded the room but there was no time to delve into the awkwardness. Harry watched his partner and realised what Seamus had meant. Music kept both boys in tune as they slowly danced towards each other before passing. Then they snapped again and turned to face the other. Harry could have sworn their noses touched.
“Oh don’t be an arse Daniel.” She cracked a grin towards him before going to the recorder and turning the vinyl.
She stepped to the side. “Well that blows it. Come in then.”
She walked off and left him there. He stood confused for a moment as he watched the girls lean themselves forward on the barres and come back up with their arms in the air. He walked along the barre before stopping in front of a familiar figure. Ginny was there practising on the opposite side of him. He didn’t know much about ballet but he would have thought that the teacher's daughter would have been the best in the class. She clearly wasn’t as she quickly stopped her practise and turned to him.
Lunch was filled with the sounds of laughter and amusement. The sun shone brightly and grinning could be seen all around.
“Ballet is difficult, that is no lie. These three subjects shall help with your abilities to cope, adapt and work. Both me and Snape will train you with Body conditioning, the rest will be touched on in class and your academic studies.”
“It’s just. I've got this audition in Newcastle.”
He didn’t like how they studied him. One man with long black hair seemed to scowl at him and an older woman with a Scottish accent murmured to herself.
Ron has red eyes. “When will I see you again?”
‘We love to boogie’ wasn’t a very ballet like song. But it was the first one they danced to.
Penelope had been more of a teacher to him than Snape had over that past year. She knew him and how he danced maybe better than he himself did. And now his mentor, and best friend was panicking, and leaving him.
“Tell anyone and I’ll kill you.”
There was a time before. There
She looked ready to cry but he didn’t seem to care.
“Snape?”
He wasn’t though, as a good friend to Lucius he had tried his hardest to subtly discourage the boy from dance. A rich kid who was used to getting everything shouldn’t have lasted in the hardship of his partnership with Potter for as long as he did. He would have to send a letter to his friend informing the man that Draco had chosen his path and wasn’t willing to waver.
Harry was shocked when Malfoy answered without any bite.
“Harry?”
Draco didn’t lift his gaze from the boy once as the car drove off. Potter's head never turned back.
“What’s with you and him anyway? When I met him he seemed nice, a little posh and ignorant but nice.”
He paused. "Wait!"
Cedric scowls. “Do you have any idea what we've been going through? I've been in a cell all night. Now you come here and say you want to whisk Harry off to some Ballet school?. This is ridiculous!” He looks towards his younger brother. “And
“...You’ll get cold.”
“You don’t have to—”
Draco almost let himself wonder why
Ginny leaned over. “I knew you’d come.”
“Tomorrow morning.”
The door creaked open as he walked into the audition room.
“Professor!”
Draco jumped in surprise. “Potter!”
Another chapter that took centuries. Anyway~ wonder what's gonna happen next. My inspiration is starting to pick up a bit and i'm hoping to achieve a time skip soon and age them up a little. Hope i can figure something out.
The woman seemed to look at the next name and sighed to herself. She seemed to know what reaction it would get and took a breath before speaking.
“No he’s a right twat, just... only to you. What’s up with that?”
She seemed to sniffle before turning away and running towards the bonfire.
He scoffed. “What boys do ballet?”
Editors Note: I actually appreciate this chapter now more than the first one. It's nice to revisits this story nearly a year later. Not much has changed but still. I fear the spelling mistakes to come. I tried to fix the ones here and I reread all my chapters before posting but somehow some slip through. Anyway enjoy!
He could see a class of girls around his age. They looked nothing like the class back home. They all looked very serious and focused. No one seemed to dance out of turn. He gulped. He was glad there was a piano playing. Piano soothed his nerves.
Harry felt his cheeks go red and become wet with tears. He grinned and began to run.
"For what?"
"I am!"
Draco had to wonder how he let himself get like this, and why Potter allowed it. He wondered how he could never remember how he ended up in that hallway and how he never remembered who approached first. He sighed. “Sometimes I think this place lives on another plane of existence.”
They walked in silence for a while. Ginny looked around before leaning in. She spoke like she was telling a secret.
He turned to Blaise who'd made the mistake of sitting next to him. The boy was writing down in the small journal he kept with him and looked to not desire any form of conversation. Draco ignored this and spoke. “What’s your family doing for Christmas?”
She shrugged. “Posh, don’t worry about him. Come by whenever, where only not here on Sundays.”
, with Cedric and everybody?”
Harry flinched at the pity full silence.
“Mum says you could be good you know, better than any of the girls here. I think so too.”
“They teach the ballet though?”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
Harry was placed next to a short girl. She had a helmet of gel stiff hair in a tight bun and noticeable buck teeth. Even still she was quiet pretty but seemed a little priss. He noticed how clean her pencil case was, stuffed to the brim with pencils and pens. She sat up straight with focused eyes and he hadn’t the nerve to speak. Thankfully he hadn’t needed to.
Draco decided that if he’d already spoken once he might as well continue.
“Wh—oh...Your more stupid than I thought.” Draco sneered.
“When’s the audition?”
He thinks the noise is what switched him on. The distinctive noise of the car radio. The music that played.
Daniel looked towards the clock. “We should get going, It’s getting late.”
“What would you know?”
“I know how you feel.”
Tears welled up in the boys strikingly grey eyes as he hit the floor. Harry lost control of his breathing as he realised what he had done and tried to apologise. Before he could even speak the assistant walked in and looked between the two.
“There’s no time like the present, you cauldron full of hot, strong love!”
“Scorpius, you’re supposed to stay at your mother and Millicent’s tonight. I’m sure they’d be very sad if you changed your plans at the last minute,” Draco said to his son.
Karamo and Antoni both laugh.
“Sickening?” Draco asks, trailing behind Jonathan.
“But what do you wear under them? I haven’t lived in Britain in years but from what I remember Aurors would wear those great big wool things that were basically just overcoats.” Tan replies, opening another drawer. “Where do you keep the rest? Where are all your jumpers? Every British man worth his salt has to own at least one knit jumper.”
“Is there anything else you need right now? I’ve got about half an hour before I need to drop the kids at The Borough.” Hermione’s hair was currently under a plastic bonnet, and she was wearing the niffler slippers Harry had given for Christmas about ten years earlier.
Tuesday afternoons were reserved for what had been termed ‘The Wottfoy Parliamentary Sessions.’ The various responsibilities of sports practices, play dates, musical instrument lessons, work at the deli/potions lab, and step-families meant that during the week the seven of them were rarely able to spend time together. Even before they had combined their households, Draco and Harry had instituted a mandatory weekly teatime to begin to integrate their families and to catch up with each others’ goings on. Scorpius had come up the portmanteau of their names (Weinberg, Potter, and Malfoy), and after a memorable Tuesday where the adults were forced to call order several times due to a shouting match that kept erupting between Jamie and Al, formal Parliamentary procedure had been enacted.
“Mr. Harry sure seems to like spending time with you,” Scorpius said as he and Draco walked towards the Underground station.
“Are you serious? No! Take these tomatoes and chop them. Use ‘secatus,’ it’s the most basic cutting charm. We’re making a marinara sauce, so they don’t need to be perfect.”
“You are entirely correct, as always, Saul. May I suggest we move on to Scorpius before I have to take him to his mother’s?” said Draco.
