Hadn’t they gone to Dumbledore’s office more than once now? Lily and Not-Quite-Potter had already conjured their Patronus, so several months must’ve gone by since that first visit to the office.
Not knowing what to say, Draco nodded with a low grunt of acquiescence, hoping to sound convincing. The last thing he needed was to get in trouble. He didn’t know how long he’d be in this place or how to leave, and he had no clue how much his actions would affect the real world. If the real world was still even a thing. He couldn’t be certain.
,” the girl said, and the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open, allowing them in. But Draco had barely taken a step forward when a shout reverberated through the hall.
A strong yank dragged him away from the moment, and, when Draco opened his eyes again, he was lying down in the dark.
They climbed into a lift heading toward the tower’s eighth floor, and walked out into a dark hallway that was even colder than the lobby of the tower. At the other side of the hallway, Draco saw a Dementor. A pang of hopelessness gripped him at that instant, and once again, he thought that he wouldn’t be able to stay on his feet.
They stayed there. Draco had thought that they would try to escape, but, apparently, surrender was their only option if they didn’t want to spend the rest of their lives in Azkaban.
He continued talking, undoubtedly gloating over the death of Potter, who Hagrid had deposited on the ground. He began to duel Longbottom, and managed, somehow, to get a hold of the Sorting Hat. But Draco couldn’t understand anything that he was saying. He could only hear the whirlwind of thoughts that was threatening to bring him to his knees. He would have to be a death eater for his whole life. He would have to be cruel, and kill, and torture, and pretend that he enjoyed it all until the day he died.
His heart was once again beating a thousand miles per hour. In the middle of the chaos, Draco ran toward his parents, but he was hit by a stray jinx that paralysed him and made him fall and get lost in the crowd. When the spell ended, surely because whoever had cast it had died, Draco got to his feet and found that his parents were nowhere to be seen outside the castle.
“Right, and the only thing they ever do is wreak more and more havoc! And it’s the ones who only want to study magic and make friends that pay the price!”
“No, I don’t know what I’m doing here,” he muttered when they were too far for the Gryffindors to hear. “Are you going to tell me what you know, or are you just here to torment me?”
“I thought I was the only one who noticed all this,” he grumbled. It occured to some small part of him that if being a Gryffindor girl was the price to pay to have someone by his side to complain about Potter with, maybe he was willing to make the sacrifice.
In slow motion, Not-Quite-Potter raised a shaky hand and caressed the space between the doe’s ears. With his other hand, he gripped his wand and murmured, “
Which was absurd, because she hated him. Rightfully so. If this Potter was anywhere nearly as idiotic as the one he knew, anyone with an ounce of common sense would’ve hated him.
He didn’t cross paths with anyone in the halls, so it must’ve been later—or earlier—than he’d assumed. Even so, Draco moved silently through the castle and resolutely pushed open another bathroom door.
When Potter let his hand fall at his side, Draco didn’t move. He gripped the door handle until his knuckles turned white and he closed it again, looking down.
—filled the space before the girl. With almost ethereal elegance, the animal took a step back to look down at Evans.
He covered himself with the first cloak he could find and tiptoed his way out of the room. He didn’t know nor cared what time it was; if he stayed alone with his thoughts a moment longer, he’d start considering
“Interesting.” Dumbledore’s voice was like a dagger to the small bubble of imperturbability that had formed around them. “Not at all unexpected, though, of course.”
“Everything about him is ludicrous,” he said. “And it’s like no one else even notices. Everyone thinks his stupid friends and him are the best thing that’s happened to this bloody school.”
"Of course you have."  Roger turned his attention to Harry.  "Mr. Potter, a pleasure."  His eyes dropped to Harry's feet, and his nose wrinkled.  "You are
Harry leaned against him.  "Thanks.  I'll take that."  He scratched the side of his nose.  "I'm getting married," he said aloud, testing out the sound.
Harry tried to look disapproving, but George's laughter was contagious, and soon they were holding each other up through waves of mirth.
Dusk had well and truly fallen by the time they got back.  Harry waved Ginny on and sat on the back step to watch the stars come out.
Arthur laughed.  "Oh, but I am.  If you want unreasonable, I'll tell Molly, and you can try to convince her to compromise on the comfort and well-being of one of our boys."
"That is acceptable.  Your robes and shoes will be delivered to you promptly.  I will see you on the day of the ritual."  This time, she rested her hand on the top of his head.  "Thank you, Harry."
More people began to notice him, all falling silent one by one.  Malfoy met his eyes, but there was no spark of challenge there, just... resignation.
Harry looked up, but Malfoy had one arm thrown over his face.  He was squirming, cock hard and straining.  Harry licked his lips.
Harry turned over again.  He knew Malfoy had a sweet tooth, and all his favorite food for that matter.  He knew he was second only to Hermione in overall spellwork, not to mention potions.  He was the only other Seeker he actually considered a rival.
"Thank you, Harry."  She turned and led the way down the street, stopping outside a similarly unassuming door.  The door said only "Cobbler."
"About the same, but this time I could see he meant it."  She leaned her head back against his arm.  "I believe him, anyway.  And I do think he's your best option.  He was a jerk, but you've already seen him at his worst."
When Harry finally lifted his head, Malfoy was staring at him with dark eyes.  A thrill curled through his blood, chasing away the nerves he'd felt.  He licked his lips, and Malfoy's eyes tracked the movement.
"Do you have any strong preferences, Harry?" Narcissa asked while Jacqueline was gathering pre-made robes for him to try on.
And then Jacqueline was back, and the whirlwind resumed as he was pulled in and out of new styles and cuts of robes.  As promised, Narcissa dismissed anything with lace out of hand and removed anything with a high collar.
Harry released Draco's hand to brace himself against the headboard, and Draco's freed hand wound around his back, holding on as Harry kept thrusting.
Harry laughed, louder than he meant to, but some of the tension left him.  "You wish," he said, an echo from another time.
Harry returned the nod, and took his place opposite Malfoy.  His hands were shaking, he realized.  He clenched them tighter, but it didn't help much.
"Yes, ma'am."  Harry snuck another look, but her expression had warmed again with her approval.  "You should probably call me Harry, since I'm going to be your son-in-law."
“Oi, you, snap out of it!” the auror that had mocked him yelled. Draco tried to take a deep breath to stop shaking, but he could barely bring in any air.
“It really can’t,” Draco said, anxiety building in his chest. “I’ll be quick. Meet you in front of Dumbledore’s office, alright?”
He could already see the door. He headed toward it, but when he was a few meters away, he came face to face with McGonagall. He raised his hands and cowered, terrified, but she didn’t attack him. Instead, she opened her mouth and started to say something, but her words were lost, drowned out by the Dark Lord’s, whose voice reverberated all around.
The mirrors and glasses of the office glistened with a blinding white light when the robust figure of a stag—
Draco glanced back at the hallway, but Lily and Potter were busy laughing softly about Merlin knew what, her fingers circling his wrist, their heads tilted close together. With a strange shudder of emotion at the pit of his stomach, Draco walked away from the scene. Myrtle, of course, followed him closely.
“I know.” Finally, Potter let his hand fall from his hair and inched it close to Lily’s until their fingers brushed. She didn’t pull away from the touch. “I know I’ve told you a thousand times, and not in the best way possible, but… I love you. I-I’m not saying anything has to change between us, I’ll understand if you want to remain friends, but… well, I guess I wanted you to know.”
He looked back at Lily. He needed to make sure, one last time, that… but no, her expression left no doubt: this was clearly the happiest day of her life.
Somehow, he managed to fall asleep on the terribly uncomfortable bed of the cell that his parents had left him. He spent the night desperately tossing and turning, his mind plagued with nightmares, but sleeping, after all. The next morning, the first thing he was conscious of was the throbbing in his back, but he forgot all about the pain when he turned his attention to the hallway at the sound of someone’s yells.
“Er, can you do that? I—” He stuttered when Evans just stared at him, startled. “I have to use the loo.”
Someone’s fingers tangled between his in his lap, distracting him from his thoughts. A teary-eyed Dorcas shared an intimate glance with him and, her lips too close to his ear, murmured, “It’s so incredible we’re here, don’t you think?” When Draco just nodded, she went on, “I don’t think you remember, but just a few years ago Lily was telling James she’d date the Giant Squid before him.”
Time and time again, he saw Dumbledore fall from the Astronomy tower, dead at Snape’s hands, unable to defend himself because Draco had disarmed him. He could remember Potter’s words, saying that all of that had been planned by Dumbledore himself, but that didn’t make him feel any less guilty.
Draco didn’t reply. He could feel the anxiety building in his chest, and all he wanted was to leave. To go back to his world, even if there was nothing for him in it, and to stop thinking about everything he was seeing. He had nothing to learn from this place, and everything it was causing him to want, everything it was causing him to long for, were things he would never have.
“There’s an easy way to fix that.” He stretched out a hand toward Draco. “What do you say? Would you like to be my friend?”
Draco didn’t hear the answer. The world around him was spinning once again, his feet losing contact with the floor underneath, and he was falling, falling...
Patting Dorcas’ face one last time, Mrs Evans walked away. Dorcas let herself fall back beside him on the bench.
“Are you done?” Potter asked. Draco glared at him, and Potter rolled his eyes. “In case you’re unaware, Ginny’s dating Luna, and they’d probably curse your arse into the Hospital Wing if they heard you talking about Ginny like that.” He took a hesitant step towards Draco. “Besides, you know neither of us were thinking about my parents when I kissed you. In that moment we were Dorcas and Marlene. Maybe
The reality of the situation finally hit Draco: he was about to enter Azkaban. As a prisoner. For an indefinite amount of time; maybe, if a judge ordered it, the rest of his life.
“Obviously,” Myrtle echoed, smiling scornfully. “If it’s so obvious, why did it take you so long to admit it?”
Draco ran for the closest girl’s bathroom and locked himself in one of the stalls. He stood there for a few minutes, only so his alibi would add up, and then he flushed.
“No,” he snapped. Cheers erupted around them, and soon everyone began to stand up, but Dorcas remained seated even though she’d stopped crying.
Dumbledore searched them carefully over his glasses, and Draco busied himself looking at Potter to avoid his gaze.
They also took a photo of his mother, and then brought them to a cell. With the three of them inside, the aurors shut the door and left, some sending one last look of disgust back toward them.
Admittedly, Draco was just trying to herd his thoughts away from Harry, James and Lily, and from happy endings doomed to failure. Still, he could hear the mild surprise in his voice when he said, “You look sad.”
“And that’s not even mentioning his stupid Quidditch complex. I swear his ego gets a little bit bigger every time he mounts that cursed broom,” the girl ranted on. “Next time I see him with a Snitch in his hand I’ll tell him where he can stuff it.”
Finally a familiar name! Okay, so this girl couldn’t possibly be Potter’s child—Slughorn would surely be long retired in such a far-fetched future.
Minutes passed. Draco felt his mother’s hand grasping his forearm and saw her blond hair out of the corner of his eye, but he didn’t move to follow her because, just at that moment, Potter said a few words that struck his chest like a dagger.
-ing himself, and the mere idea was so tempting it made terror and anxiety build in his chest again.
He didn’t want to think about what his stupid dream had meant. He couldn’t afford to. Instead, he rolled out of bed and walked into the bathroom he shared with Theo, barely opening his eyes. He felt his way around for the tap and dipped his head under the freezing stream of water.
is disrespectful and childish, and I do not intend to understand it.” With that, the girl grabbed Draco by the arm and strode boldly toward the Gryffindor common room.
They began to walk toward the tower’s entrance. The aurors weren’t holding them down any more, given that the island, just like the Hogwarts grounds, was protected so that no one could disapparate.
what I want to have with you. Maybe I want you to be my friend and maybe I want to fall in love with you little by little, and maybe, just maybe, I want for people to see us together and smile because they can’t remember the last time they saw one of us without the other or the last time they saw us fight.”
The only thing he could think now was he wanted to find that man and shake an explanation out of him.
“Don’t you get it?” Draco grit out. “It doesn’t matter. We’re not like them. You don’t want me. The only reason you could possibly want to be with me would be to have a messed up version of your parents’ relationship, and I won’t stoop so low as to date you just so you can have your perfect fairytale ending. Go ask the she-Weasel out if that’s what you’re after.”
“Do you know what I think? I think the reason you’re here has more to do with those two than you’re willing to admit.”
After crossing through the entrance, they found a lobby filled with around twenty more people, congregated in little groups. Draco saw one of the werewolves that had been living in his house being dragged along by four aurors. Three others were walking toward the door, surely in order to hunt down the death eaters that had gotten away at the end of the battle.
“At least there’s no Dementors,” he began to say, his tone somewhere between desperate and urgent, while biting his thumbnail. “Well, there was one back in the hallway, but most of them are still loose. It will take the Ministry time to recruit them again. By the time they return, we’ll already be gone.” It seemed like he was trying to convince himself, and Draco tried to silence his internal monologue, tried to drown out all of his emotions so that he wouldn’t burst into tears. That was the last thing that his mother needed right now, and that was the only thing that he could do for her.
A moment went by, and then Draco slowly turned around. The determination he found in Potter’s eyes made him look down again. He didn’t feel ready for this conversation.
“Stop worrying.” That girl, Dorcas, was suddenly by his side. “Dumbledore will be happy we’re on his side.”
As soon as Marlene’s body crossed the threshold, however, Draco felt a pull in his chest. He fell behind, feeling as though he was floating, floating, too dizzy to open his eyes. As though he was trapped in the split instant of an Apparation.
A sound like a roar came from the limits of the school, and, soon, a giant appeared before them. The other giants attacked and the Death Eaters broke rank. Draco had only looked away for a moment, but when he looked back at the ground, Potter’s body wasn’t there anymore.
“Yeah,” Draco said without thinking, even though he could no longer remember what happiness felt like.
He still remembered the silhouette of the man who’d sold him that stupid potion. He’d been staring at Draco from the shadows, hunched, dirty, face covered with a wide hood. He’d been smiling, as though he knew exactly what Draco was looking for.
“That won’t be necessary, Mr Potter.” Unhurriedly, Dumbledore stood and walked around his desk. Draco’s shoulders tensed, and, suddenly, he felt fingertips brushing against his knuckles. Dorcas must’ve been trying to soothe him. “The reason I’ve summoned you here is to tell you Voldemort has added a group of Dementors to his ranks. A quite numerous one, it seems.”
Draco huffed. He may not have witnessed that particular event, but it wasn’t hard to believe. After all, he’d have said the same thing about Potter if someone had thought to ask.
“Oh, boy, tough luck,” commented one of the aurors, who hadn’t spoken until now, with a mocking tone, “They’re not going to feed you for a few hours in here.”
He remembered his desperate attempts to forget—to push the images of what he’d done away from his mind. The drawer in his nightstand filled with Sleeping Draught and Focusing Potion vials. The feeling of lethargy after overdosing. The dreadful realisation that none of it was enough; that he’d be willing to hurt himself further if it meant not having to
The thought vanished as Dorcas’ lips brushed against his in a kiss so soft and quick it was almost non-existent.
Dorcas caressed his cheekbone with a thumb, oh so slowly, as though unsure she was allowed to be doing it.
The next few minutes seemed endless. They must’ve been in Seventh Year, judging by the fact they were studying the same unit as Draco had a month ago. The idea of having to repeat an entire year in someone else’s body sounded exhausting, and Draco spent the remainder of the lesson trying to remember what exactly he was doing a second before he got pulled away from the Gryffindor common room. If he did, maybe he could leave this place and hopefully return to his own body.
Draco was beginning to relax, at the realisation that everything was over, and that he was safe, when a group of aurors approached and surrounded them. He followed his parents’ example and kept his head down, didn’t look any of the witches and wizards in the eye as the aurors told them to get up, and cuffed them with magic. They took away the wand his father had stolen and came over to take Draco’s and his mother’s as well, and found that, as they had said, they didn’t have any. Then the aurors took them out of the castle and walked with them to the limits of Hogwarts, where they disapparated.
Draco didn’t recognise the teacher, but pretended to be focusing on the notes he was taking down from the blackboard as Evans stood, sharing a confused glance with him. Well, with
“There’s a slight flaw to your logic, Potter,” he said, finally finding it in himself to untangle his hand from Harry’s. “You and I are not friends.”
But no such reply came. Instead, this brown-eyed Potter blushed and brought a hand to the back of his hair to tussle it.
He remembered, one by one, all the times that he had disapointed his father: from the Quidditch games that he hadn’t won to the moment he’d had to torture a mudblood with the Cruciatus curse for the first time before the eyes of the Dark Lord. He hadn’t been able to cast the curse. He remembered the girl’s screams when, threatened with torture himself if he couldn’t cast it, he managed the curse. And it made him scream as well.
They couldn’t be. They may have ended up together and conceived the bloody saviour of the magical world, but that didn’t mean… did it?
“You know...” Dorcas sounded… different. Her voice was slightly deeper, slightly more nervous. Salazar, what had he gotten himself into? “One of the reasons I want Lily and James to confess already is that… I don’t want them to make the same mistake I made. I should’ve told you sooner how I felt about you.”
When Potter reached out for his hand again, Draco didn’t have it in him to pull back. All he could do was think about the fact that, even if it’d happened within a dream, even if their bodies hadn’t been theirs, Potter had given him his first kiss. Had done so knowing full well it was Draco he was kissing. The idea scared him—intoxicated him. How often had he fantasised about playing with Harry’s hair, about bringing their mouths together? But he’d never allowed himself to hope it’d ever actually happen. And now… now it was becoming harder and harder to convince himself it’d be foolish to harbour any hope.
What if Dumbledore recognised him the same way Myrtle had? What if he looked Marlene in the eye and was capable of seeing the boy that would one day be an accomplice of his murder?
They stepped outside at the same time and saw Hagrid, cradling a bundle in his arms. At his sides and behind him, rows upon rows of Death Eaters advanced, masks off and smiling, as if they had already won the war. Draco located his parents at the same time that they saw him, but he couldn’t think of a way to get to them. Just then, McGonagall cried out:
The only thing on Draco’s mind after hearing those words had been he didn’t know anything about himself anymore. That maybe this would be his chance to find some sense in having survived the war.
And he continued talking. And he told them all, without diverting his gaze from his mortal enemy, that Dumbledore had ordered Snape to kill him. Draco's temple started pulsing. He had believed that Dumbledore’s death had been his own fault.
The hours passed. His parents tried to talk with him to distract him, but Draco didn’t answer, afraid that his emotions would explode the moment he opened his mouth, and after a while, they admitted defeat, and fell silent. Every once in a while, they heard more people being locked up in the neighbouring cells. Some of them yelled. Others refused to reply to the aurors.
He stepped back, but didn’t try to walk away again. He couldn’t. Not without finding out what Potter wanted from him.
No. Draco trusted Lily. There had to be another reason she’d ended up with Potter. A bet, love potion in her drink…
“Draco, I’m serious. We need to talk.” Potter seemed uncomfortable. Worried. Draco’s heart raced. He had a bad feeling about all this; about Potter being here, about him using Draco’s given name so casually.
Draco remembered. Remembered not wanting to return to his Eighth Year but having no choice. Remembered thinking moving on was pointless, terrifying, painful.
Harry stared down at him, the blush creeping up his chest, the soft pink of his nipples, the bob of his Adam's apple as he swallowed, the spill of platinum over his pillow...
Julius took the letter in his beak and flew off silently into the night.  Harry watched him go until he was out of sight.  He shut the window and got back into bed.
"Wait, but he told me loyalty to his bondmate was important to him."  Harry's brow furrowed.  "But he also implied he would accept me resuming my relationship with Ginny?"  He glanced down at Hermione.  "When he said 'loyal,' he didn't mean 'faithful,' did he?"
The other people in the room hastily averted their eyes, like they were embarrassed for him, and Kingsley sighed again like Harry was the unreasonable one.  Was it unreasonable to expect his happiness to matter to
Harry nodded.  "Actually, I did have a question.  No one has really...  I get the feeling I'm not being told something about the ritual.  Is there something I'm meant to bring or do, or am I really just repeating words over an altar?"
Ginny slipped away from the loose circle of Weasleys and nodded toward the back door.  Harry followed with a grateful smile.
Harry opened his mouth to protest, but then he was being swept further into the store.  His measurements were taken in a dizzying swirl, and then different fabrics were floating around him as Jacqueline and Narcissa discussed the merits of the various colors and patterns.
Draco let out a little sigh, relaxing further against his side. Harry returned to playing with Draco's hair, and slowly, they fell asleep.
Narcissa's eyes glittered when he caught them.  Her manner was reserved, but even so, Harry could tell she was pleased.
"It's okay."  He sighed.  "Actually, I ended up telling Malfoy, and he was willing to discuss it.  He wants kids, just not definitely right now, which is sensible of him."
"Merlin, and here I thought the whole school knew.  All of Slytherin did."  He ran a hand through his hair, mussing it entirely.
Harry's stomach grew tacky with cooling come. With a wince, Harry summoned his wand from wherever it had rolled, and cast a few quick cleaning charms on himself and Draco.
A tapping at the window caught Harry's attention.  Malfoy's eagle owl flew in as Hermione opened the window.
"They're not tight at all," he realized.  "These are amazing."  He caught sight of his trainers as he moved again and flushed.  "I s'pose I'll need new shoes, too."
"I expect it was the year hiking the Forest of Dean that did it," Harry said mildly.  "Hiding from Voldemort, you know."
Harry shook off the hands that reached for him and stormed off.  There was a flurry of noise around him, but he ignored it.  Hermione wouldn't hold it against him.
Molly shook her head. "Don't be ridiculous," she scolded. "You're one of my boys.  Of course you'll wear it." She rested her hand on the top of his head. "It's all we have to give you."
Harry shrugged.  "It was with someone I love.  That's good enough for me."  He leaned his cheek against her hair.  "I wonder if Malfoy ever has."
Harry kept his pace steady and focused. "Mine now," he murmured against his throat. "All mine.  Forever."
Ron groaned louder.  "You've got terrible taste, mate, but I guess this time it's for the best."  He sighed.  "I won't start any fights if he won't."
Harry hummed.  George and Ron nudged his shoulders with a wink and an eyeroll respectively.  Hermione squeezed his hand.
Harry hesitated to rip into it, too used to their usual newsprint wrapping. He glanced up, but she was nodding and urging him to open it.
Malfoy curled a leg around Harry, holding him in place.  "The ritual."  Malfoy's arms looped around his neck.  "I think it's giving us a push.  Helping things along."
Harry shook his head, eyes on where his fingers were steadily disappearing. "No, I want you to feel good."
Harry looked back at the pairs of people, mind whirling.  Parents and children, and largely Slytherins, based on the faces he only vaguely recognized plus the Malfoys and the Goyles.
Started this on a whim, so let's see where this goes!  I've been working on this for about three months, and I've started the next chapter already.  Hopefully it doesn't get... too long.  haha;;
Narcissa nodded.  "As I thought.  If it's at all as I remember, I can see why you would struggle with it.  Persistent Dark magic will have that effect on a building.  It requires specialized magic to cleanse, especially with a house as old as that one."
"Thanks, Julius."  He scratched his head, took the letter offered, and handed him treats as he'd promised.
"Harry, Harry, Harry," George said as they stepped out into the twilight, "I've given this a lot of thought--me and Fred, we'd discussed this before, see--and I've decided that the best made plans should not be wasted.  So I have a present for you."
"The day-to-day details of the arrangement can always be negotiated, but loyalty to one's bondmate is of the utmost importance."
Harry slid one finger inside him, obliging.  He was warm and so, so tight.  He was going to be inside that.  He was really doing this.  His cock throbbed with impatience, but he ignored it.
"Me, too."  Harry kissed the top of her head.  "At least I've already had my first time.  They couldn't take that from me."
The ribbon shone blood red against their skin, and then seemed to sink beneath as Harry watched.  After a moment, even that faded, leaving behind a small mark on the inside of his wrist.
"Isn't that wonderful.  You'll have Aurors taking care of that horrible Skeeter woman, won't you?" Molly asked.  "Seeing as she constantly harrasses poor Harry?"
Roger and Narcissa spoke back and forth, but Harry had no idea what they were talking about.  Shoes, probably, but for all he knew they were discussing politics or something.
"I have my own inheritance as a Black, and Draco and I are the sole remaining Malfoy heirs, now that Lucius..."  Her lips tensed, but she pressed on.  "We could not possibly spend all of the money in our vaults."  She touched his shoulder.  "Let me do this for you."
"You made my life miserable for... what, five years?"  Harry tapped his foot to the ground.  Was he really considering this?  "You already pointed out, but we did
Harry bumped their shoulders together and turned back to the house.  "You'll have to beat Hermione there."
Hermione was at his side the moment the door opened.  Something in his face must have told her what she needed to know, though, because she only nodded with a tight smile.
Malfoy leaned against the wall across from him.  His eyes slid past his hiding place, but he didn't move away.
."  She pulled an uncut housekey out of her pocket and pressed it into Harry's hands.  There was a thin cord looped through it so he could wear it.
"We could always polyjuice as you again," George offered.  "We've got a batch made up for emergencies, you know."
Footsteps approached his hiding place and then stopped across from him.  Harry reluctantly lifted his head.
And then a pair of black leather boots with bold criss-cross stitching up the sides caught his eye.  "Oh," he said aloud.
A hand gripped his shoulder.  Hermione was breathing a little hard, like she'd been running.  The door behind them shut with a click.  "Sorry, I'm late.  Harry, I've read all about it, and we should talk about this in the other room."
Harry planned to stay with the Weasleys anyway.  He nodded.  "The cleaning can be charged to my vaults, though.  I don't want you paying to make my house livable."
"Loose collar, no lace."  Narcissa graced him with a smile that reached her eyes.  "I'll see it done.  Anything else?"
Harry pulled his fingers almost all the way out with a slight twist, surprised at how easily they slid inside even despite the tight clench of the muscle. He licked his lips.
"You'll have to get there before Ginny does."  Harry bumped his shoulder against Ron's.  "I wish things could have been different."
true, Potter, my mother intends to collect on the debt you owe her."  He shrugged.  "You can choose someone else, but it would be faster if you just chose me from the start, since she'll be making you choose me anyway."
"Just because I can't see you, doesn't mean I don't know you're there."  Malfoy's voice was cool and smooth, unperturbed.  "This is definitely the hiding place you'd choose."
betray my bondmate.  Family comes before everything, Potter.  You and my mother would be my first priorities.  The bond being arranged wouldn't change that."
Draco Malfoy, the only son of the Malfoy line, the boy he once considered his rival, the unmistakable leader of their batch of Slytherins, was now spread beneath him and begging Harry to fuck him.
Ginny curled her arm around his waist.  "I'll miss you, too.  And if Malfoy hurts you, I'll kick his ass."
Malfoy crossed his arms.  "How could they?  You're immune."  Something occured to him; his brows rose.  "You've decided," he said, surprise clear.  "You'll pick me, then?"
"There." Molly cupped his face in both her hands. "You'll find your happiness," she promised, "even if it isn't where you expect it."
Harry had also seen Malfoy helping his friend escape the fiendfyre, and refusing to confirm Harry's identity, and lowering his wand at the last.
"Two," Malfoy said, ignoring his interruption, "it would be better for you if the bond were with someone you already knew.  In fact, the ritual may have a stronger effect because we've actively tried to kill each other before, nevermind that we've both saved each other since. Three: while we would be required to consummate the bond once, we would not be expected to continue doing so.  After six months, we'll even be allowed to live separately should we so choose, not to mention take other lovers."
The step creaked as Ron sat down beside him.  "Malfoy, huh?" he asked.  "You sure about that, mate?"
Ron knocked their shoulders together.  "Thanks for not dooming us all, I guess.  But next time someone thinks to ask you for something, Hermione'll snap."  He laughed.  "You shoulda seen her eyes; what she did to Skeeter's gonna look kind in comparison."
Harry crossed his arms.  "I want you to tell the Wizengamot," he said slowly, "that this is the last sacrifice I make.  I don't care what the consequences are; I won't give anything else."
"It's a matter of public record," Kinglsey snapped.  "This is hardly some secret affair!  The vote was public, Arthur!"
One of Malfoy's legs slotted between Harry's, and Harry groaned, dropping his head against Malfoy's shoulder.
Harry's shoes were removed, and his feet measured, and then Roger and Narcissa were discussing colors and styles and other things Harry didn't understand.
“Oh, Merlin’s balls, Draco, don’t tell me he’s managed to project his ineloquence upon you. It’s been
going to get me to put even a forkful of that nauseating muggle fodder in my mouth, is that understood?”
The flames reared up one last time before dying down completely, and silence engulfed the flat again, and Harry knew if he went into the living room now, Draco would be long gone.
. You might not see the change, but I do, and so does Pansy, and even your mum wrote to me the other day saying you sound lighter in your letters. Happier. That she’s glad you’re finally letting yourself live.” His dark gaze softened, and Blaise continued, “What I’m trying to say is, for Salazar’s sake, Draco, don’t fight this. You’re only sabotaging yourself. If in the end it turns out Potter wants nothing to do with you after all, then fine. So be it. It’ll suck, sure, but at least you’ll know you tried. Keep this up, and you’ll only drive yourself mad.” Blaise paused, and his eyes took on a mischievous twinkle Draco knew all too well from Pansy. “Besides, I sincerely doubt it’ll come to that. Potter cutting you loose, I mean. He seems rather fond of you, too, you know.”
“That’s why, back when you and Ginny started dating, I was so…reluctant,” Ron continued. “The idea of you, my brother, dating Ginny, my sister, was weird, to put it mildly. You two were good for each other, I suppose, and Ginny really loved you, might even still—”
Draco immediately bristled, the topic far too close to comfort for his liking. “Redirecting the subject, are we? Frankly, I have no idea why everyone thinks Gryffindors are such ignorant morons—clearly you’re all genius conversationalists.”
A long moment of silence, in which both Hayes and Draco watched the Gryffindor, who didn’t answer, simply stood there and looked at Nic.
Harry had known Slytherins were masters of verbal jousts, but his head was beginning to spin just keeping up with the two of them, eyes whizzing from one Slytherin to the other and back. “Okay, what is happening here.”
Harry could only force a small smile in response. One would think after three years he’d have gotten used to being bombarded by total strangers with attention and compliments and overall glorification—but no, he was still just as uncomfortable with it as before, and thus reacted correspondingly.
It wasn’t supposed to have progressed this far already. Merlin’s beard, Harry didn’t even have his full soulmark yet. He didn’t know Draco’s wrist bore his name, didn’t know why it was they were always so in tune with each other’s emotions. It shouldn’t be possible, didn’t make any sense—
Draco snorted, but he had to hand it to the man—at least his candour was spot-on. With all the shit he’d had to face over the past three years, the blond had learned to appreciate when someone was an arse to his face instead of behind his back.
not after the battle—but late nights in the Slytherin common room, chatting and laughing and playing games under the faint glow of the lake outside with all his friends, were still one of his fondest memories. There had been no judgement there, no light and no dark side. Just children enjoying their childhood in a world that sought to destroy said joy.
Draco cast a quick Reparo on the plate, and gathered up the pieces of sandwich, careful to be quiet as not to wake Harry, who still slumbered peacefully. Then he stood, and walked back across the room, plate and smashed sandwich in hand. He allowed himself one last glance over his shoulder and smiled.
When Pansy reached their table, she rolled her eyes at Draco. “Oh, relax, lover boy, your Harry’s coming.” Then a smirk replaced her frown, and her eyes glinted dangerously as she said, “It’ll be worth the wait, trust me.”
Except then he promptly shut his mouth again, shook his head once and then said, tone incredibly weary, “I should have seen this coming, shouldn’t I?”
, by penalty of death. And so I asked her a few questions, because no one’s really explained any of this to me except maybe you, but there’re still so many unknowns, and I—”
“Perfect,” she said and crossed her arms. “I’ll precedent this by saying that I don’t particularly like you, Draco. Not really, not yet. You were too cruel to me and my friends all those years at Hogwarts for me to completely forgive you any time soon. But the thing is, Harry
the person after Harry was a Death-Eater! Draco mentally cursed himself. Who else would be so determined to kill Harry Potter, Vanquisher of Voldemort? He should have realized it sooner, and if not him, then someone else at the ministry. After all, that breakout had been all anyone at the department could talk about since it had occurred four months before.
Harry didn’t even waste a second thought on the fact that Lucius Malfoy was being provided with his very own copy of the Daily Prophet—money really did rule the world. Instead, his thoughts circled around one question and the one question alone:
Potter lifted an eyebrow, but Draco could tell the gesture wasn’t derisive, but questioning. “But you were popular, too. Especially with the Slytherins. I know as a fact they looked up to you—" he grimaced slightly "—for better or for worse.”
And although Draco had immediately flushed crimson-red and vehemently shushed the girl—after all, they were in
Before the Death Eater could finish the sentence, Draco had leapt to his feet and thrown up a ‘Protego’. And when a ‘Flipendo’ shot from the tip his wand, slicing through the air before it collided with the distracted Death Eater and sent him flying backwards into a particularly ugly umbrella stand, Yaxley had never seen it coming.
He only half-listened to the conversation after that, which flowed easily from the topic of wardrobe to Hogwarts to which Celestina Warbeck song was the most excruciating, and then in some bizarre turn of events to which BTS album was the best, at which point Draco completely lost the thread. But watching Harry so vehemently defend Love Yourself: Answer (which Draco had never heard of in his life but figured was a nice enough title), eyes shining with that same fire Draco knew and loved, he didn’t mind not being able to contribute anything to the discussion himself.
A wide, if initially hesitant smile broke across Harry’s face as well. “I…okay. Great. Sounds like a plan.”
“But you openly admit you have an accomplice? Someone who’ll go after Mr. Potter once you no longer can?”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again, suddenly feeling Nic’s grief as acutely as if it were his own. Losing loved ones in the war was something he knew plenty about. “I’m so sorry. That’s terrible.”
It was an awkward, half-hearted attempt to diffuse the tension, but Draco didn’t smile. The sides of his lips didn’t so much as quirk, and Harry worried momentarily whether they’d had some sort of horrible fight during the last twelve hours that he now couldn’t remember. Christ, he hoped not. If he’d somehow managed to get dumped by the single most beautiful human being he’d ever met just a few days after getting together in the first place…well.
The tension in the air remained, even with Ginny long gone, and Harry exhaled shakily, only then daring to look at Draco. Draco, who was already staring at him with wide eyes, almost as though he couldn’t quite believe that had just happened, couldn’t believe Harry had admitted he loved him.
He smiled up at the ceiling from where he lay sprawled across the couch. The old Hogwarts gang, back together again at last. It sounded nice.
And although Pansy refrained from commenting—thank Salazar for small mercies—the way her dark eyes danced with blatant glee overtop the rim of her mug conveyed her thoughts quite sufficiently.
So I've been asked a few times how long this fic is going to be. The plan is a total of about 25-30 chapters, probably closer to 30, maybe even a few more. I know this answer is incredibly vague, and I apologise for that, but I just genuinely don't know xD. These characters have a mind of their own, and don't even get me started on the story line...
something to you. You, his self-proclaimed ‘best mate’. Do you truly care that little?” He sneered. “Or was it just stupidity that led you to bring Harry along to Diagon Alley where, might I remind you, the first attempt on his life was made mere weeks ago?” He snorted derisively. “Honestly, I don’t know why I’m even surprised.”
that one time, not to mention how Harry—” Draco winced when he promptly found himself the target of five pairs of raised eyebrows. Well, four, seeing as Ginny was still too busy glaring. “Fine. Back to the apology. I shouldn’t have said most of the things I said, shouldn’t have acted the way I acted. And I realise it’s not much of an excuse, but most of the nonsense I did I’d either picked up from or seen done by my father. Regardless of how misplaced that trust might have been, he was my role model, and I didn’t lose much sleep over whether or not his ideals were wrong. So, yes, I’m sorry. To all of you. For…everything.”
Harry’s brows snapped together, and he didn’t need to glance at Draco to know his whole expression had hardened. “
Harry laughed, and the sound instantly calmed Draco’s residual anger. “Quit talking about Gryffindors as though we were the Dark Side of the Force and Slytherin were the Light. If anything, I’d say
And just as Harry’s throat started closing up and he could feel his own eyesight get blurry, a burning sensation spread across his right wrist. He inhaled sharply, not because it hurt but because it had simply caught him off guard.
And due to this, there was no missing the little diamond piercing through the helix of his left ear.
Potter was still muttering under his breath, looking peeved, when Draco set the newspaper aside again. His eyes briefly lifted to Potter’s right wrist, where he now knew a
But when the waitress came over to where they sat well away from the pub’s other occupants, ready to take their order, and Harry said, “One Butterbeer for me, please” Draco’s eyebrows snapped together.
But then she hissed, “I don’t know what you’re playing at, Malfoy, but don’t expect me to believe even for a second that you’ve
He rolled behind the next available object—a display case filled with what appeared to be numerous enlarged snake skulls—flattening himself against the floor just as a curse shattered through the glass, raining little crystalline shards and chunks of bone down upon him.
“That’s why,” Ron began, then stopped midsentence to clear his throat again, and judging by the concentrated look plastered across his face—the sort that made the redhead look vaguely constipated—he was obviously trying to choose his words wisely.
Thankfully, at that moment, someone came rushing down the hallway, and when Draco looked up, it was Blaise’s concerned face that greeted him. The apprentice hadn’t even reached Draco yet, his white Healer’s robes fluttering after him as he ran, when he burst out, “Did you do it? Did you try to murder him?” Draco blinked once in shock, but Blaise was already continuing. “Look, I won’t blame you if you did; Potter’s a very irritating individual. But there’s the whole legal situation to consider, plus, attempted murder on the Saviour of the wizarding world won’t really help your public image.”
Immediately, his mind started racing. There may only be one exit, but if he could get to the fireplace, he might be able to escape the office after all.
“Is she…well?” Harry asked. “Your mother I mean. I haven’t really seen her around much.” An understatement. He hadn’t seen her even once since the day Lucius was found guilty.
Harry shot him a glare, but the effect was ruined by the smile tugging steadfastly at his lips. Merlin, Draco thought, they really had come far, hadn’t they?
“Blimey, you really do need to head over to St. Mungo’s,” Jennings’ voice said from somewhere above, his hand coming to rest awkwardly on Draco’s shoulder. The latter tried to shove it off, but only ended up wincing and swearing harder.
it. It’s my life, and they’re discussing it as though it’s the bloody weather. Read this line, for example:
He expected Potter to retaliate with a comment of his own. But the usually so quick to anger Gryffindor simply sighed, angry scowl thawing into a weary sort of frown that had Draco’s anger melting away as well.
“What can I say,” Harry said, hoping to lighten the mood. “He may be a giant arsehole, but at least he can bake.”
Harry glanced up, just once, just for a second. Or that was what he’d planned to do. Instead, he found himself staring at the sickly pallor of Malfoy’s skin, more grey than its usual ivory, and the way his blond eyebrows bunched together, and how his grey eyes glimmered with uncertainty, a sight Harry had never, not once in the near-decade he’d known Draco Malfoy, ever seen happen. And he suddenly found it very hard indeed to look away again.
Hermione stared.  "I don't know.  I suppose you'll need to talk to him about that.  It hardly seems fair to him if that's the case..."
Harry stepped out of one of the Atrium's Floos and pulled the Invisibility Cloak's hood up at once.  Hermione stepped out beside him, and together they followed behind Kingsley, reporters swarming him at once.
I married Lucius.  For all his faults, Lucius was a brilliant investor, and his wealth more than doubled before we had Draco."
Harry shifted his weight to his knees and took his cock in hand to guide it into Draco. He fumbled a few times until Draco hooked a leg around Harry's hips and brough them sliding together like they were meant to fit, like they were alwayd meant to end up here.
Narcissa's eyebrows rose in the same way Malfoy's did.  "You will only need to repeat the words, but you will be taking Draco back to your home when the ritual ends."
The otherwise plain door read "St. Germain" and said nothing else.  Harry would never have noticed it or even realized they were a tailor.
Ginny tossed her head back; her laugh rang out across the fields around them, startling a flock of birds into flight.
"How should I know?  I've never had to live with you before," Malfoy snapped.  He sighed.  "Look, how many Ministry functions have you attended since the war ended?"
"And you're sure there are no cameras waiting, Kingsley?" Arthur asked, his voice low and dangerous.  "These boys don't deserve to be in the papers today on top of everything else."
George's eyes twinkled merrily.  "That's half the fun.  Do read it, though.  There's some interesting stuff in there, and plenty that works for two men, y'know."
"This should be private in the first place," Hermione complained.  "Rituals like this are delicate, and they require concentration."
"No," Malfoy confirmed.  "Any other relationships would not be considered legitimate by wizarding law."
Draco's arm was still thrown over his face, but he was spreading his legs wider, arching his hips in invitation.
Once his fingers were slick, he kissed his way down Malfoy's chest, licking and biting when the urge struck him.
Harry let himself relax.  This wasn't so bad.  In a way, it was kind of nice.  And none of the robes were scratchy or too tight, and the fabric felt nice against his skin, and then they were turning him to a mirror on the wall behind him.
If Molly knew she was in here, she'd be extremely cross, but Harry was grateful for it.  One last night, just the three of them.  They'd talked about nothing and anything until Hermione's eyes began to droop, and Ron's yawning grew to be continuous, and Harry had finally forced them to go to sleep.
Harry pointedly stroked over the little bump again, tightening his hand around Draco's cock in the same moment. Draco arched with a surprised noise. "This can wait, don't you think?"
Narcissa Malfoy stood at his door.  Her robes were true black and neatly pressed, not a hair on her head dared to be out of place.  She looked beautiful and untouchable.
Narcissa, sitting in the front in a set of elegant black robes, gave him a tight nod, almost smiling.
He tucked himself into the first alcove he found and cast as many spells as he could think of to make people walk past him.  He hated the cold wet eggy feeling of the disillusionment charm taking effect, but without his Cloak, it couldn't be helped.
He "No Commented" their way through the crowd, the Weasleys flanking him and falling in around Hermione and Harry.
They entered a small room at the end of a particularly serpentine hallway.  The room had a few benches facing something like a stone pedestal, although there was nothing on it.  The altar, maybe.
Harry walked a circle around the room, surprised again by how nice his feet felt.  He couldn't feel the texture of the ground when he walked either.  Harry glanced back at them and nodded.
Harry dropped his head against the wall.  Maybe if he ignored him, Malfoy would go away, and he could be left to deal with things on his own.
Malfoy rolled his eyes.  "Arrangements are common among pure blood families.  Some have given up the tradition, but Malfoys are not among them."  His mouth pulled in what might have been a wan smile.  "Despite any preferences I might have."
When Harry stood, the sole pressed along his arch in such a way that he understood suddenly why they despaired over his trainers.  He shifted his weight and turned his legs to see the stitching better.
"Arthur wore this for our wedding, and Bill for his.  Merlin knows if Charlie will marry, but it's tradition for Weasley men to wear it on their bonding day, no matter the circumstances." Molly was smiling, tears gathering in her eyes.
"Roger," she greeted, kissing the air as she had with Jacqueline.  "I'm so pleased to see you've reopened.  We've missed you, of course, and Jacqueline sends her love."
"Of course, Granger."  Malfoy gave Harry a quick nod and then followed her.  His hair was back to how it was before he ran his hands through it.  Too bad.
His blond hair was loose, framing his face and softening his features.  It shone in the torchlight, faintly gold.  His robes were a dark blue, almost black, with a glitter to them that looked like the night sky.
Harry sat where he was pointed, mulling over the words.  He liked them, he decided.  Roger was a strange man, but he seemed kind and unbothered about his fame.  Even if he was a bit judgemental about Harry's shoes.
Harry blinked.  He pulled out one of the slips of paper with his address on it and handed it to her.  "You can give this to the people you hire for the job."
, you two."  Harry glanced back at her, but her eyes were on Kingsley.  "It'll be both, obviously," she muttered.
"I do love Ginny," he said.  "But that doesn't really matter anymore."  Harry scratched the back of his neck with his free hand.  "Plus, there's Teddy."
Beside her was her son, talking to Goyle, a woman who might be Mrs. Goyle fidgeting just behind them.
But could Malfoy be that person?  He'd seen Harry at his worst, to be sure, and Harry had seen more bad sides of Malfoy than good.
Malfoy barked a laugh.  "Potter, you must be joking."  Harry's brow furrowed, and Malfoy stopped laughing.  "You're not joking.  I'm as straight as Pansy is, Potter.  I like men."
Harry had done little more than set foot inside the Burrow before he was overwhelmed by several voices loudly debating what sounded like Harry's options for the ritual.
Harry smiled weakly.  "And I do.  More than anything."  He let go of her hand only to wrap his arm around her shoulders.  "Are you going to tell Neville?"
Narcissa paused and turned to take him in.  Harry tried to stand tall under her scrutiny.  She nodded once.
"Pansy?" Malfoy asked.  "She's queer, for one, and her family left for America before the dust settled."  He shrugged.
When they were told, Harry and Malfoy reached across the stone and clasped their hands arpund each other's wrists.  The officiant wrapped a red ribbon around them, starting at Harry's wrist and winding around and around until he reached Malfoy's.
"Plus, I don't want them there."  Harry leaned his head back with a sigh.  "Is eloping a thing with rituals like this?"
"My godson, Teddy, I want to raise him.  He's only about a year old, so I'd rather take over sooner than later."  He shrugged.  "Ginny doesn't want kids now, and she might not ever want them."
"No.  Haven't I sacrificed enough?"  He ran a shaking hand through his hair.  "It was supposed to be
Molly held him close. "I know I couldn't take you in when you were younger, but you will always be one of my boys, Harry. Don't you forget that. We'll support you, even if it means accepting a Malfoy as an in-law."
Malfoy waited for a moment, and finally sighed.  "Look, Potter, this whole thing is a bit archaic, but the fact is, now that it's been invoked, it must be done."
against the window startled him out of his spiral.  An eagle owl was sitting on the sill, an envelope held in its beak.
"Yes, I did."  Malfoy frowned.  "Is that going to be a problem?  It would only be the once, and then you can... resume your relationship with the girl Weasley if that's what you want."
"Thank you for letting me do this, Harry."  Narcissa touched his shoulder again.  "I know this is all happening very quickly.  Normally, you and Draco would be given more time to adjust to the match."
Malfoy nodded.  "Right, and I grew up in that world.  I've been navigating those functions since I was a child.  As your bondmate, I would be with you the whole night."  He cocked his head.  "I'm comfortable doing all the talking if that's what you want.  And if you don't want to go at all, I could write your refusal for you in such a way no one could claim offense."
"It's not you I'm really worried about."  He frowned.  "The Wizengamot, they'll want this all over the papers, won't they?"
Harry shifted to wrap his arm around her shoulders.  "Thanks for looking.  If anyone could have found something, it would have been you."
Harry laughed, hands dropping to hold Malfoy's hips.  His blood thrummed with magic and energy, and his cock throbbed.
Kingsley pinched the bridge of his nose.  "Right.  Of course."  He sighed.  "The Wizengamot has voted nearly unanimously to invoke a... very old ritual.  One that should be enough to prevent another war breaking out in our lifetimes."
"Oh, it must, must it?"  Harry slashed through his charms and stormed closer.  "And that's that, then, is it?  I'm meant to just go along with this like a lamb to bloody slaughter?  I
Malfoy's ear went red.  Harry brushed his nose along the shell.  "I've never been with anyone, but I prefer to have something inside me."  His words were over-confident, but the blush remained.
"Very well.  Unadorned.  Something classic and comfortable, I think."  Roger nodded and waved his wand through the air in a pattern Harry had never seen before.
Harry didn't know what to say, so he didn't say anything.  Once she'd gone with a pop, Harry did the same, returning to Grimmauld Place to pack a bag.
Malfoy frowned.  Harry thought he might be genuinely surprised.  "You really don't get it, do you?  Marrying you is the best assurance of a life after the trials conclude.  A lifetime stuck with you is probably better than Azkaban."
George laughed again.  "You'll be all right, Harry.  Malfoy gives you any trouble, and Ron and me'll set him to rights."
The bell chimed as they entered, and a man poked his head out from behind a curtain.  "Narcissa, it's been too long!"
"You're to be my son-in-law, Mr. Potter.  I'll not have you dressing poorly for formal events."  She finally looked at him, her grey eyes glacial.  "Am I understood?"
Malfoy guided his head into a slow kiss, careful and chaste.  Harry moaned and pressed closer.  He didn't have much experience, and maybe it was just the magic, but this was the best kissing had ever felt for him.
Harry glanced over the people gathered; their eyes were resigned, their shoulders slumped.  They knew already that he'd decided.
"I was never going to say anything, but while we were apart," Ginny trailed off.  "I fell in love with Neville.  I was going to let the feelings pass, but..."
Ron finally came down, tripping down the last few steps as he tried to finish straightening his new dress robes, something sedate and elegant.  He cleaned up well, now that he wasn't in some lacey monstrosity like the Yule Ball.
Harry wanted him, wanted to be inside him, to give him whatever he begged for.  He pulled his fingers out and recast the lube charm.  With a suppressed moan, he spread the slick up and down his cock.
"That works fine for me.  I've never been with another bloke, but I think the mechanics should be similar."  Harry bit his lip, wand sliding neatly into his hand from the holster (which he promptly removed), and focused on the lube charm from the book.
"You better have," Malfoy gasped.  He pulled Harry's hair which sent a pleasant tingling through his scalp and down his back.
Narcissa began to walk, so Harry fell into step beside her.  "My preferred tailor is on this street.  We're a few streets away from Diagon Alley's main thoroughfare."
Once they were outside, Ginny slipped her hand through his, tugging him into the fields behind the house.  They walked for a few minutes in companionable silence, nothing but the sounds of crickets and the grass rustling around them.
"He can be taught!" Jacqueline threw up her arms and resumed gathering fabrics.  "You see now.  I will be fitting you for a full wardrobe when you return, yes?"
Harry glanced away from where his finger was disappearing inside of him, from where his hand was wrapped around Draco's cock.  "I'm not doing that badly, am I?"
"I may have... made you a portkey," she mumbled.  "It'll take you directly to your house when you say its name."
to see his face. Harry pulled his arm away, pinning it above his head, and kissed him hard before he could complain. Draco wound his free hand in Harry's hair, tugging impatiently.
Harry knew, whatever Malfoy admitted about his father, that Lucius Malfoy was just as bad as Vernon Dursley, even if he apparently loved his son.
Malfoy's eyes trailed slowly down and back up.  He nodded once, like he was deciding Harry passed muster.
As soon as they were released with looks of pity and apology from the Weasleys, Hermione, and Narcissa, Harry shot Malfoy a sly wink, hands still clasped, pulled out the key Hermione made, and said "Grimmauld Place."
Harry pulled her into another tight hug, and then, by mutual unspoken agreement, it was over.  They walked back to the house in their usual companionable silence; they kept several inches between them.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose.  "I'll meet the others before I decide, but... you're not wrong."  He let out a resigned sigh.  "Total war?"
Panting, he pulled out and rolled off Draco to one side. Draco turned toward him, resting his cheek on Harry's chest. Obliging, Harry wrapped an arm around him.
Harry didn't bother trying to remember the path they were taking.  He touched the key under his robes and took a steadying breath.
The feel of Malfoy's chest against his back, of strong arms tight around his waist.  The way Charlie Weasley looked, fresh out of the battle.  In hindsight, the way he felt the first time he met Oliver Wood.  The mixed feelings he had about Cedric Diggory.
Draco clutched greedily around Harry's cock; Harry moaned into his mouth. "How's it feel for you, Draco? Okay?"
"You can always use this mess as an excuse."  Malfoy's tone was odd, like he was hiding something, his true reaction, maybe.
Harry threw a hand out for a quill and some paper.  At least this gave him something to do.  He grabbed a book off his nightstand and spread his paper out.
Narcissa frowned.  "No more expensive than they're worth.  I won't be canceling the order, and you will not be refusing this gift."
Harry repeated some words; Malfoy repeated some words.  The officiant spoke softly in Latin over their bound hands.
"And don't worry, Harry, if Ron ever convinces Hermione to marry him, we'll give him the same."  George's grin was broad and cheeky as it ever was.  "And Percy, if he ever tricks someone into it."
"Too bad he didn't switch sides sooner.  That woulda been a sight to see," Ron acknowledged.  "He's still a prat, though, and if he hurts you, I'll kill him."
Harry was hardly aware of their passage through the house (distantly noting how much lighter the air felt, how clean everything looked); they stumbled up the stairs, pausing to kiss, knocking into the wall and kissing some more, before finally making it into his bedroom.  (Not much changed, but certainly more pleasant to be in, a fire burning warmly in the hearth, sconces lighting as they pushed inside.)
Harry let his eyes fall shut.  He was so tired.  "I can't do this again, Hermione," he admitted.  "I'm not going to keep sacrificing myself for the rest of the world.  I told Kingsley that if they volunteer me again, I'll refuse no matter the consequences."
Harry nodded against her shoulder. "Thanks," he managed around the lump in his throat. His eyes were hot, but he managed to keep himself from crying.
George found him after dinner, slinging an arm around his shoulders and steering him away from the rest of the family in a move that felt horribly lopsided.  Harry breathed through it, loss catching behind his ribs.
The officiant, some much older wizard Harry had never seen before, spoke at length about responsibility and honor and duty for some time.  Harry lost track of it all, unable to really focus on it.
Harry curled one hand around Draco's cock and slid the lubed one beneath him to begin preparing him.
"Probably not.  Pure bloods have some kind of thing about sex before bonding, from what I've overheard."
Draco Malfoy was beautiful, and from now on, he was Harry's. The thrill of that thought hit harder than Harry anticipated, somewhere dark, deep within his chest.
Narcissa looked surprised.  "Of course.  She sends my bill directly to Gringotts.  It's rather gauche to carry that much money about in public."
Harry leaned against him, fingers curled tight around the book.  "I'm going to have to hide this, you realize.  I'd never live it down if anyone found out I had something like this."
Roger nodded.  "Certainly.  Those are good for everyday wear.  They're durable and built to last through some pretty rough handling.  You have a good eye."
Harry almost didn't recognize himself.  Narcissa had cast a gentle spell at his hair, and now it fell in waves instead of the mess he was used to seeing.  The robes were a dark emerald green that made his eyes almost glow.  As he shifted his weight, the fabric glittered and shone gold.
Malfoy ran his hand through his hair again, mussing it further.  "Merlin, Potter, isn't getting married in your teens enough?"  He shook his head.  "No, nevermind, we can talk about the details later."  He bit his lip.  "I...  I do want kids.  Now's maybe a bit sooner than I'd planned, but...  I'm willing to talk about it at least."
"Of course, Jacqueline."  Narcissa bowed her head, a tiny smile tugging at the corner of her lips.  "I'll be back with Draco for his fitting tomorrow, and you may tell him yourself."
"The inauspicious day of your wedding of course."  George winked, salacious.  Harry could easily imagine its perfect mirror just beside.  "Now, we had you pegged for marrying our sister, but we're nothing if not adaptable."
Narcissa sighed.  "Harry, I suppose you may not know this, but the Malfoys were the wealthiest wizarding family
Hermione stepped out of his Floo and immediately locked it.  "Molly wanted to come by, and so did Ginny, but I thought one thing at a time might be best for now."
Harry thought about it, but shook his head.  "I don't want to look daft, but you'd hardly let me look like an idiot next to your son."
"No one told me anything."  Harry crossed his arms, unsurprised.  "Guess they wanted you to tell me."
