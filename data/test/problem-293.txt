“He cancelled on me,” Draco said, muffled. He was sucking Harry’s collarbone. Then he raised his head to gaze intently into Harry’s eyes. “Do you want to fuck me?”
It was dangerous to be a homosexual man in the nineteenth century. It was outlawed, and villainised. Harry had rejected the duke because he hadn’t wanted to end up in gaol; he hadn’t wanted to become even more of a social pariah.
. You mustn’t do that. You must marry that pretty blond girl and forget all about me. You must stop risking your reputation because you want to shag me. Didn’t last night satisfy you?”
In the deserted corridor, Draco rounded on Potter. Potter’s eyes went impossibly wide when he saw him.
“I couldn’t let you do that! I refuse to be anybody’s charity case.”
Draco snatched his wrist. His fear was slowing, thickening. It was turning into something needy and reckless. “Don’t touch me if you think I’m a monster.”
“Can this be enough right now?”
Harry had to look away. Malfoy had no idea how
“Don’t rush me.” Potter leaned down to mouth Draco’s neck.
Malfoy smiled a little. “I do many things, Mr Potter.”
“Yes, love.” It thrilled Harry to say it.
“Oh,” Draco said.
“Please,” Potter said, voice cracking. “Leave me alone. If you just let it be, this madness will pass. It must.
Sighing, Weasley stepped back. He met Harry’s gaze. “I’m a realistic man, Harry. I know that our hearts don’t always cooperate. I know that these things can take time. But think of all the brilliant research we could accomplish together. You want a future in the Classics, yes? I could help you open so many doors.”
,” Potter moaned as Draco thrust all the way inside. Potter clutched his shoulders, arching his back, as Draco panted in his ear.
“He’s not mine,” Harry murmured, unconsciousness already seeping into him.
Draco hitched a shoulder. Potter was squirming in his chair and it was
“No, you are not. I know this land like the back of my hand. It will take you at least another three hours on foot to reach Hawthorne.” The duke slapped his crop against his gloved hand again. “Now stop this silliness and mount up on my horse.”
“Jesus,” Malfoy said, and he stilled. He was silent except for a groan deep in his throat. He was coming, filling Harry’s arse, claiming him.
“It sounds like you have been brainwashed by Lady Granger.”
“Mother and I used to play this all the time,” Malfoy said.
Groaning, Harry pushed into him. Draco was so tight that it made Harry catch his breath. Harry watched his face for any sign of pain. “Is this all right?”
“Leave us, Dullborne,” she commanded.
“No,” Harry said, and pushed himself onto his back. He motioned to his hard cock. “Not enough.”
Draco met his eyes. He had no control over his expression, and he knew his jealousy showed plainly. Potter turned pink and looked away.
“Oh.” Weasley looked crestfallen.
“What’s the matter?” Harry said groggily.
“You will survive. The duke prefers the company of people well-bred enough to judge in silence.”
“I want this,” Draco said when Potter tried to pull away.
“Many times.”
Draco sighed. “I daresay two days isn’t enough time for Lady Granger to do much harm.”
“Don’t say such things. Please, I can’t handle it.”
Harry almost laughed. The looming structure was anything but a house.
Malfoy was sitting on the bed, still in his dirty trousers. He zeroed in on the steak. “That smells brilliant,” he whispered.
“No,” he snapped. “I won’t listen to you degrade yourself.”
“I am sorry, ma’am. I’m needed elsewhere.” Only a duke could get away with such insubordination. The hard look on her face said she knew it.
“No!” Harry said. “I don’t—
“You don’t think I haven’t faced that before? I have and I survived.”
.” Malfoy slumped forward and covered his face. “I’m an idiot.”
Malfoy was growing stronger, healthier. Harry liked the way he smelled after a long morning of garden work.
“I like you, Malfoy,” she said. “You are a rare sort of man. Dependable. Efficient. When you put your mind to something, you get it done. You don’t look it, but you are modest. I appreciate modesty.”
Draco sat back in his chair. He gobbled down the pasta, face burning. Potter had
The stables were dark and quiet. Goyle looked to Draco for confirmation, and when Draco nodded his head, Goyle pushed his way through a side door.
, Your Grace.” Potter’s eyes gleamed. “It’s a political and economic theory. I believe a bloke named Karl Marx came up with it.”
They kissed and kissed, the only sound in the room being their harsh breath. There were footsteps out in the corridor, murmuring servant voices. Draco didn’t care. He didn’t. The entire world could bugger off. He just wanted the man in his arms; damn it, he wanted to be
“Don’t cry,” Draco said. “Everything’s all right.”
Harry was in the middle of a meltdown. He couldn’t say why. For the last couple of weekends, he’d been calm enough to lounge on the sofa while Draco got ready for work. He’d even stood to say goodbye to him, putting his hand on Draco’s lower back, leaning in to smell his brilliant cologne. Draco had kissed his cheek each and every time he’d said goodbye.
Draco gulped and wiped his face. “Really?”
, Harry thought. He squeezed his eyes closed and did everything in his power to think of England.
With no other choice, Harry followed the duke back inside the castle.
Harry looked at the women around him, not knowing how to feel. He had never been to a protest before, but he had heard of the violence that occurred when labourers took to the streets to defend their rights.
Draco nodded. “You are used to walking for miles, are you not?”
“Do you want me to leave?”
“Just give me today.”
, Draco thought viciously. Surely she would understand that Potter was in no state to help out her silly cause. For Professor Wealsey—whoever he was—Draco would speak to him personally if he tried to penalise Potter for not completing his work when he was this unwell.
Draco tilted his head. “Maybe I’m a murderer. I was a Death Eater, remember.”
the fuck are you?” Draco demanded. Draco wore a shower cap and held a flannel and a bar of soap. Utterly naked, he stretched himself against the wall, letting Ginger Hagrid get a nice good view of his body.
“There are loads of ways you could make me.”
Malfoy shook his head. “Please - no healers.”
In a shocking twist, Draco had survived his Parliament scandal well. The Liberals won the election, and Draco now worked alongside them to implement legal reforms.
“All you do is apologise! You never change your
“Thank you, Your Grace. I never expected such treatment.”
“But don’t you see? I am trying to get to know you.”
“I want a proper Christmas with you.”
Potter pushed himself down. The fall was awkward, inelegant. He squeaked and fell right into Draco’s arms. Draco caught him and held him close.
“I always liked Herbology.”
“I don’t care! I’ll be the first one.”
The next couple of days slipped by easily, simply. Harry and Malfoy fell into a routine with Harry helping him bathe and dress, and cooking his meals. He applied salves to Malfoy’s ribs to ease the pain and bruising; Malfoy’s sides were speckled like a gobstopper.
“It’s worth a try, Your Grace.”
“I had no idea,” Harry said faintly.
While Potter toiled away in the library, Draco was in the fields, checking in on his managers and overseers and labourers. They were still attempting to harvest chard and turnips, but the recent snowstorm meant that much of it was unusable.
Harry got an idea. “Want to eat outside?”
The words reworked themselves as Harry watched, his heart thumping hard.
Draco jumped to his feet. “Where are you going?”
“Maybe it would be for the best … if he hurt me.”
Harry felt his face go pink. “I’d rather not say.”
Draco bit his shoulder and fucked him harder. He urged Harry onto his stomach so he could have better leverage. He hauled Harry onto his knees, pulling him back with each of his thrusts. Harry buried his face into a pillow and sobbed.
When Draco reached his cock (and it was such a nice cock), Draco dragged his tongue along the shaft, waking it up. Potter jackknifed.
Outside, the afternoon was in full swing. The snow looked like licked icing on the ground. Draco wanted to say something to Potter, anything, but he felt a shadow come over them. Not knowing if it was merely in his head, he helped Potter mount his horse, then pulled himself up on his own steed. They took off for the castle.
“Fuck me.”
“Sir,” said Goyle, utterly professional. He was incredibly loyal to the duke, and Harry admired him for it.
Ginny clapped her hands excitedly. “Oh! And that means you will attend the New Year’s Eve ball as well! Oh, this is so
“Sir, please return with me!”
“Supper’s ready,” Malfoy said brightly. He jumped up to retrieve the pie from the oven.
Potter went stiff against him, his breath rushing out of him. “Malfoy …” His voice was a warning.
“I’ve never met anyone who makes me feel the way you make me feel,” Draco said quietly.
Weasley smiled. “Good, Harry. I’m most happy that you agreed.”
When he arrived at the library, he found Potter hiding behind a mountain of books.
Malfoy shrugged. “Okay. I woke up, so that’s a positive.”
“Yes,” Potter said shakily. He helped Draco to his feet.
Malfoy fucked him slowly with the one digit, so slowly. He kissed the centre of Harry’s back, his breath skating over his skin.
Draco took a step closer. “Do you know what I want? I want to kiss you again.”
“Explain.”
The carriage took off. Several minutes passed before Draco spoke. He spent the time glaring coldly at Dursley.
“You are here willfully. My valet will testify that you chose to get into my carriage because he offered you payments.”
Afterward, they lay in front of the warm fireplace, talking. “The constellation on the library ceiling—what does it mean?” Potter said.
Draco’s hips stuttered. His bollocks were tight with his release. He was desperate to fill Harry with his come. “Harry,” he whimpered, his cock pulsing. He shuddered as orgasm surged through him. He thrust and thrust, his mouth open, his hands biting into Harry’s hips. When he calmed down, he pulled out and spread Harry’s cheeks so he could get a good view of his used hole. Harry moaned again.
“It affected me, you know. Finding you like that.”
“I want more than you can give me.”
“Then you don’t have feelings for me. Not really.”
. Draco lunged for his face.
The man was curled on his side, no jacket, no shoes. He faced away from Draco, but there was something about the shoulders that looked familiar. Yes, and the hair. The raven locks were thick and wild, slightly curled. Dear Lord,
“Oh my god.”
“Yeah,” she said, and they took off.
Harry’s mouth dropped open. His former lover had only put his mouth on his hole once. It had felt good, but it hadn’t felt like this.
The sky had turned purple with the beginnings of dawn when Harry finally found his way out. Malfoy was still unconscious, still unmoving.
them, I did!”
Draco cried out again, and the baby broke from his body. The bubble burst, and suddenly they had a crying, mucus-covered baby.
Draco narrowed his eyes at her. “What?”
After his bath, he dried off and slipped on a comfy dressing gown. He didn’t bother to put on his shoes.
“Neither do I,” said the duke. Everyone turned to look at him. He was calmly sipping his glass of wine, a large gold ring glinting on his pinkie finger. “There have been surveys done, of course; but the numbers don’t tell the whole story. More women than you think suffer mistreatment by their husbands. More than you think are terribly unhappy in their marriages.”
It was another night of Harry pacing Grimmauld Place. Overall his acceptance of Draco’s profession was getting better, but bad nights still sneaked up on him. Tonight was a bad one.
“Harry …”
“Do it.”
“Give back those clothes, you thief!”
Malfoy made a fist and punched his open palm. “I will ruin them,” he whispered.
Malfoy’s eyes went wide. “You are lying.”
“Has the duke told you what is occurring today?”
Potter frowned. “Do you want something else?”
you? Don’t you have other commitments?”
Harry didn’t know what it all
“Please.”
“No, it’s not like that at all. I want to help the cause; I
Potter’s breath stuttered. He tasted like alfredo. Draco pressed his tongue to his lips, asking for permission. Groaning, Potter parted his mouth.
“THERE’S A MAN! HE’S BOUND UP! HE’S—
“I do! I do!”
“I bet his parents not being alive has helped,” Ginny piped in. “Nobody’s around to pressure him about it.”
“Come on, then. Let’s dress this tree.”
Malfoy sucked in a breath. “They mistreated you!”
Potter stared at him for a moment. He licked his lips. “I - well.” He laughed and rubbed the back of his neck, smearing the ink.
“Follow him and make sure he understands I mean business.”
The Queen raised her eyebrows. “I daresay.”
Still laughing, Draco brushed his lips against Harry’s. “Oh,” he whispered, and went in for another taste.
Gathering all his strength, Draco forced his turmoil from his mind. He took Harry into his arms and stood. “I’m getting you out of here,” Draco said to him. Harry didn’t wake up.
They had climbed that mountain because their lives had been filled with possibility. Draco remembered thinking he and Harry could conquer the world together, how nothing - not even the past - could stop them. He remembered thinking he would never love another person like he loved Harry.
“I believe so, Your Grace. He asked about you.”
“I’m not,” Harry croaked, unable to look at him. His cock was waking up in his trousers, and he was mortified. Draco was in the middle of rejecting him and he was getting a stiffy.
Carefully, he lowered Malfoy down so Harry could hold him close. He pointed his wand up, turned, and Disapparated both of them.
Harry smiled faintly. “They got themselves blown up. A circus act went wrong and there was an explosion. I was only a year old.”
“Malfoy.” Harry moved closer. He wanted to put his hands on him again. He wanted …
, Draco, thought.
Parkinson was glaring at Granger as if she hoped to set the other woman on fire with her eyes. “Hello, Hermione,” she purred.
Draco tried desperately to ignore his jealousy. “Go on.”
“No. I’m not sure if the Muggles can make anything better.”
“It wasn’t just me,” Potter said finally. “Hermione also helped - Professor McGonagall -”
“Oh, fuck,” Harry said, stilling. Draco’s laughter turned into moans. He felt Harry coming inside him, a deep, deep throb.
“My what?”
“Sure … what does your cock look like, Potter?”
“You shouldn’t sound so shocked!”
Potter shook his head. He was pacing like he had in the conservatory. “I confess I can barely look at you.”
“Tell her later perhaps.”
Their end of the table fell silent. Everyone suddenly became quite interested in their roasted chicken with almonds and cream.
when he got too close. Draco desperately wanted something else.
“No.”
Draco beamed as he jumped down from his horse. He strode over to Carter and addressed him with pride in his voice. “Good morning, Carter. Making good time?”
Draco just stood there. “Potter … I’m not a dog anymore. I’m a man. Don’t you recognise me?”
A muscle jumped in Malfoy’s cheek. “Pray tell
It reminded him of the duke on his knees, his mouth full of his cock, his bollocks. It reminded him of the duke kissing him, his stuttered breathing, his clean, masculine scent overwhelming him.
“I will pay for the doctor,” Potter said.
“That was different! He was mistaken, that’s all.”
“Help me get out of this dreadful bed,” he said with a bright but tired grin.
Half an hour later, Harry was soaking in a brilliant bath. He had had a meal of chicken and bread, and his tea had been scalding hot. A bath just for himself was such a luxury, and leaning his head back and closing his eyes, he let himself just enjoy the clean water.
“What’s the matter with her?” Barwald said.
. “Oh, Harry,” he whispered again.
“Ah.”
, Harry thought. The idea cheered him up.
“That is why I want you to stay.”
Gossip was a dangerous thing.
Draco told him what he’d done to cousin Dudley. Harry didn’t know how he felt about it. He was relieved that Dudley would leave him alone for now on, but he also wasn’t sure if Dudley would keep his word. Money made men very ruthless and irrational.
things, I don’t know how we could survive.”
Malfoy averted his face, watching the ceiling as dawn chased away the shadows. “You should have refused to help me. Everyone has turned me away.”
“I want you so much, Malfoy.”
; but he couldn’t move an inch.
“Yes, Your Ladyship. You certainly do.”
, Draco thought. He followed the cries into a large room filled with bodies and bodies. So many people crowded the space that Draco couldn’t even see the floor beneath his feet.
The corridors were darker now, colder; there were no windows, but Harry was sure it was nighttime. They ascended several staircases until they reached an impressive office with double doors.
“And that nasty dog of his. The one that slobbers all the time.” Malfoy gave an exaggerated cringe.
Malfoy pulled his shirt completely off. He raised his arms, twisting from side to side. “I’m looking better, don’t you think?”
Theo’s face hardened. “But then you went ahead and married Potter. I couldn’t believe it when I found out. The irony was I had always intended to kill Potter. You just became the prize after the deed was complete.”
“Yes.”
“Of course you are joking! What you are saying is impossible.”
Granger laughed. “It’s better if you don’t, believe me. Now—your outfit. You will need a suit of course. Black attire. Remove your jacket. I need to see your shoulders.”
Tearful, Harry stepped back, again and again. His brilliant gaze never left Draco. “I love you,” Harry said, but he was disappearing. “I love you; but you should let go. We will meet again some other day.”
In Draco’s bedroom, he laid Harry on the settee by the fire. Harry’s teeth were chattering. He looked so pale.
“What do you have in mind?” Granger said.
“You—?” Harry felt a surge of indignation. “With all due respect, Your Grace, I can’t see how you could stop me.”
Draco could only blink at him for several seconds. “You—what?”
“I’m not a revengeful man.”
She studied him. “Women aren’t so bad. Perhaps you will find someone who will offer you a shred of comfort.”
Sniffling, Pansy stood and pulled at his arm. “Come on, Draco. You need to eat.”
“Yes.”
Potter gulped thickly. His eyes flickered away, then came back to settle on Draco. “You’ll think I’m a slag … but I let him have me. He followed me on my way back to the farm, and the country road was empty. It was summertime, and the trees … they hid many things. I didn’t even know his name that first time, but I was nineteen and desperate for a man’s touch. Perhaps you understand?”
It was close to dinner time now, and Draco was deeply worried.
“Yes, but your experience relates to this moment.”
“I don’t want to interfere … I’m not … you know.” Harry shut his mouth. Christ, he was blabbering.
“Wow,” Potter said once Draco had spread out beside him. There was wonder in his eyes. “I had no idea anything could feel so good.”
“Come along,” he said roughly, and marched from the office. Relieved but ashamed, Harry followed him.
“Can we do it somewhere that isn’t a culinary crypt?”
The duke smiled a little. “That Weasley girl you were dancing with … is she your sweetheart?”
“You don’t know me. You only see my title.”
Ginger Hagrid backed away, his hands up in the air. “Sorry! I didn’t know Harry had a roommate.”
“How did His Grace know I was here?”
“What?”
He growled in his throat, moved even closer. “We are entirely alone, Potter.”
Harry smiled a little. “We must be discreet.”
Harry came around the desk. He approached Draco like a predator. Draco stumbled back, a hot flush on his face.
“I make you nervous, don’t I?” she said, voice almost a cackle.
Draco looked up into the warm hazel eyes of Neville Longbottom. “Oh, hello,” he said.
“Oh,” Harry breathed.
They stared at another one in the day’s fading light. The duke’s white blond hair gleamed, his face flushed with colour. His eyes were the clearest grey Harry had ever seen.
Draco felt his gaze narrow as he inspected Potter. “You look under the weather.” Concern made his voice turn hard.
” Greengrass said, clutching her diamond necklace.
“Oh, Harry.”
“Please,” he said again, begging. “Please fuck me.”
Malfoy then did something quite unexpected: He leaned over and kissed Harry on the cheek. “No, I like it,” he said, breath smelling of sugary grapes. “I hope you will do it again.”
The servant frowned at him. “Is everything all right?”
, Draco thought.
Theo smiled brightly at him. “Good evening,” he said, chipper. He looked amazing, smelled even better. His brown eyes twinkled at Draco. They were a lovely chocolate, and Draco had to force himself to look away.
Harry was stunned speechless. A duke was on his knee before him. A duke was
“Sounds like good fun.”
For the next couple of hours, they made their way to every abattoir and knacker’s yard and piggery. Urban animal agriculture was a disgusting business and it made Draco yearn for the clean, open lands of Wiltshire. Draco waited outside as Goyle inquired inside. Every time, Goyle returned with a frown on his face.
“Potter,” said a dark voice behind him.
Harry muttered a levitating spell. Right. Now he had to figure his way out of Knockturn. He took two steps forward with Malfoy following in the air, his limbs dangling like something dead, before he realised his stupidity and cast an invisibility spell over Malfoy. The last thing he needed was Mundungus Fletcher-like characters seeing him sneak off with Malfoy. They would both be blackmailed before the sun came up.
“No, I don’t think so,” answered the duke. “But I should probably get back soon. I have hundreds of guests in need of my attention.”
“But still you persist.”
“Magical people make pasta bakes all the time! At least Mrs Weasley does …”
“No!” Harry yelled.
Had this gorgeous stranger promised her something? Perhaps she thought they were sweethearts; perhaps she thought he would make love to her. The idea made Draco tremble in his chair.
Once again, Harry found it more than a little unsettling to be called ‘sir.’ After all, he and the servant were both quite common. “It’s quite all right. Please bring it to me. Though, I’m not sure who could have sent me anything.”
“You absolute
“I’m sorry,” Harry gasped.
Draco thrust against Potter, grinding. Potter’s mouth dropped open; they both felt each other’s hard pricks.
Suddenly Potter sat up. He chucked a pillow at Draco’s head. “Are you
“You are obviously an intelligent man—a clever man, but you seem to lose your head when I’m around.”
“Is it?”
“Good evening, Your Ladyship.”
“You entrance me, Mr Potter. There’s no getting around it. You have since the moment I saw you in Parliament Square.”
“I only did what was right.”
“Yes, well, we don’t expect you to keep up with the Classics, do we?” said the duke.
“We will stop just around the corner. I want you to follow him, Goyle.”
Tears streaked Draco’s cheeks. Too relieved to speak, Harry kissed him desperately. Draco tasted like salt.
Sighing, Draco sat back in his chair. “We must be smart about this. We don’t know what sort of men Harry’s consorting with. We need to make quiet, but firm inquiries.”
“Yes?”
Harry went to the door and left.
The lyrics were in German, but Harry was deeply moved by the emotion in their voices. His chest clenched on their lower notes and his spirits soared when they went higher. The room with all its snooty occupants fell away. Harry existed only for this music; he only knew the world their voices created.
,” he said, making a face.
“Hello,” he said, and Potter popped his head above his fortress.
“Fuck,” Malfoy whimpered. Then: “Yes, oh, yes.”
“Just follow me. You will see soon enough.”
“The stupidity?” Harry was being rude, he knew it.
“Um -”
Draco hesitated. He couldn’t read Harry’s expression. “Everything has a place, you know. Wet towels need to go on the rack.”
Draco fell silent for a moment, deep in thought. “Yes, it would make sense. He did sell off all his belongings before he left Oxford.”
“Not bloody likely,” he said.
Draco growled again, the sound rumbling in his throat. “What does he have that I don’t?”
“The last I heard, he was living in the poorhouse. It’s not that far from here, only down the road that way. But, sir, he was very sick, you know. Only God knows if he made it through that first night.”
Once again, Draco thought of the man in Parliament Square. He hadn’t been afraid to speak to Draco. He’d marched right up to him and thrust his silly little leaflet into his face. Draco understood it was easier for men to approach other men, but Draco was a duke, and judging by his threadbare clothes, the man had been a lowly commoner. But
“Yes.”
“Did you conclude I’m not going to die?”
Now the duke’s eyebrows were raised. “Do you mean to tell me you plan to spend the holidays
“What?”
“No.”
Harry’s gaze trailed up and down Malfoy’s revealed body. Malfoy was right - most of the bruising had disappeared, and much of his cuts and scrapes had healed. But Harry was distracted by how his pale, pale skin was pink from exertion, how blond hair trailed from his belly button into his trousers. Malfoy’s stomach was still mostly flat, but Harry fancied he could see the beginnings of a pregnancy bump.
Lady Parkinson looked at him once and a grin split her feline face. “You must be Mr Potter,” she said, giving him her hand.
Harry hurried to the library. He was worried sick. It felt as if he was stuck in a nightmare.
“No, not even close. And I don’t want to marry Lady Greengrass.”
“Tell me, Harry. Tell me why.”
“Our boy,” Draco murmured.
“Good,” Harry said, dropping kisses up his neck, “because the last year has been the happiest time of my life.” He pressed closer, letting Draco feel his stiffy.
“What? But—” Harry lay back against his pillows, his head spinning. When he spoke, his voice was once again faint, “I have too much to do. I can’t go to
every time you speak.” Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter flinched.
“Oh, and there’s Devil’s Acre.”
“Oh, bugger,” Malfoy said, and hurriedly turned down the heat.
The woman turned red. Harry gave her an encouraging smile, and she smiled back. “I’m Harry.” He held out his hand to her.
Draco kissed him then, and it was a desperate, passionate thing. Draco wasn’t thinking; he couldn’t think. He just wanted Potter beneath him so much.
“Like dogs,” muttered a woman standing next to Harry.
After he’d confirmed he was alone, Draco closed his eyes and stroked himself. Of course he thought of Mr Harry Potter, Oxford student, male suffragist, gorgeous creature.
“I invited you here.”
“You went to the opera with me.”
“Malfoy …”
Draco thought.
Trelawney looked at him sadly. “Harry says you should stop paying the subscription fee. You never liked his knitting anyway.”
Oh, no.
Harry gulped. The idea of seeing the duke again made his palms sweat, but he would be lying if he said he hadn’t thought about the dashing blond man. “Yes.”
“Yes.” Harry gritted his jaw. “He … he’s the reason I’m dead.”
“But why me? Why not … I don’t know … Theodore Nott?”
“Draco,” Harry moaned.
Draco looked down at his hands. He didn’t know where he wanted this conversation to go, not really. He just wanted to get under Potter’s skin, make him squirm and blush and stutter.
“Have you ever sown a seed?”
Draco asked himself. Harry had been dead for almost a year now. Harry would want him to move on. He’d want Draco to be happy. Could
After Harry pulled out, he took Draco into his mouth, sucking. Draco’s eyes rolled back, orgasm washing over him. “Harry,” he sighed, mostly to himself.
Draco wanted to help Potter back to bed himself, but he was forced to stand back as the servants guided him from the room. He could imagine the gossip that was already circulating because of their horseback ride yesterday. He didn’t want to add to it.
“We can eat all of them, if you prefer,” Draco said.
“Yes, Your Grace!” The servant curtsied and rushed off.
Groaning, Potter squeezed him through his trousers, his hand wrapped around the outline of his hard prick.
Harry tore through the first book, then the second. When he didn’t find anything about male pregnancy, he considered fire-calling Hermione for help.
Draco wasn’t sure if he could keep up his confident facade when alone around Potter. He checked his watch. How long did dinners even last? One hour? Two? Three if the conversation was good.
“I wanted to find out … who the father is. I mean - the other one. The problem was I’m not sure. I don’t really know how far along I am in my pregnancy and I was - well - I was shagging a lot of blokes.”
Potter frowned. “I couldn’t have done it without his help.”
Harry nabbed a flute of champagne and did a walk around the Great Hall. There was an orchestra, and couples were dancing in the middle of the room. In a corner, Lady Granger and Lady Parkinson stood close, whispering covertly. They looked like they were enjoying each other’s company, and it put a smile on Harry’s face.
“Don’t remind me,” Potter growled.
Draco made eye contact with Potter, and raised an eyebrow. Potter shrugged, utterly unmoved. He knocked pleasantly on the door, then went inside.
“Come on, don’t be shy. We still need to discuss your plan for the cause.”
“I told you I was hung up on someone else. I’m sorry.”
“Yes,” Malfoy sighed.
“But … with what money?”
, he thought secretively, then felt a little guilty. After the disastrous dinner on Christmas Eve, he thought most nobility could go to hell.
“Let them try,” Draco said, and marched across the thoroughfare.
Thankfully, the conversation turned to the merit of the Army Enlistment Act and whether decreasing the normal period of service had been beneficial. Surprisingly, Lord Webbington supported the decrease while the duke had to think about it.
“You’re shivering,” Malfoy said, sounding displeased. “Here, take my coat.”
Theo turned to look at him. “Of course you should take as much time as you need … but don’t you think you’re ready to move on?”
“Yes.” Harry took a deep breath. “Do you want to try out the spell?”
Granger pulled her hand away. “Is the duke in residence?”
“I’ll help with the planning, of course. The party, I mean, not your wedding.”
Internally, Draco smirked.
“Tell me,” Draco said quietly, touching Potter’s cheek. He urged Potter to look at him, and the pain he saw in Potter’s gaze nearly broke him. “You can trust me.”
“Do you want that bath now?”
“Don’t call yourself that,” Harry said.
“Not here. God, not here.”
“I WANT YOU TO LEAVE!”
Weasley pushed up his glasses to rub at his tired eyes. “I’ve been worried sick about him. I asked him to be my … well, it doesn’t matter. I asked him a serious question and then he ran away.”
“I have feelings for you,” Draco whispered.
“The toilet’s a couple steps down the hall.” He pointed to the wall. “I’m next door. Call me if you need help.”
“Right.” Draco’s parents would’ve died again if they heard him discussing their money problems with someone outside the family. And Draco refused to spend a knut of Harry's money on the Manor.
“There will be loads of pupils in need of tutoring.” Harry managed a smile.
Goyle stood. “I’ll seek them out right away.”
Harry and Draco sat on the settee next to her. They held hands. “It’s what Draco wanted,” Harry said.
Granger narrowed her eyes. “Fine, don’t tell me. In fact, I understand. I quite believe romantic feelings should be a private thing.”
Malfoy blinked at him. “That’s ...”
“I was beat up,” Malfoy said.
Malfoy thrust up one last time; his mouth hung open as he came.
“Oh, I have proof. Loads of it. I’m sure a duke wouldn’t want his business printed in the newspaper!”
Mrs Gibbs was dozing on the bed and Potter held her hand. “She’s doing much better,” Potter whispered.
Draco wanted to throw something. “But still you run away? I can give you the world, don’t you understand?”
Draco spoke to Professor Weasley (the gigantic
Malfoy moved down to take Harry into his mouth. The sensation was overwhelming this close to orgasm. Harry cried out and thrust deep, as Malfoy sucked hard. Harry shook all over, his hips jerking.
, Draco mouthed, and Potter drew out, then slammed back in.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “What’s the matter with you then?”
“Brilliant! Come inside.” Potter stepped back expectedly. Draco gulped and proceeded into the house.
“Shh.” Draco smoothed his hands along his sides. Harry had lost weight. He felt fragile now. “We will draw you a bath, get you cleaned up. Then we will have dinner, and I will hold you by the fire. Does that sound good?”
“I will see you later,” Malfoy said, and disappeared into the night.
Harry jerked his head. “No.”
Potter’s hands kneaded his shoulders. Potter was shaking hard. “Please,” he said. “Please don’t hurt me.”
The first surprise was the trail of soil from the old shed to a crowd of snooty violets. Harry followed the trail, his mouth twisting in a smile. He came around the violets and found Malfoy on his hands and knees, digging into the earth.
“You needn’t call me
Such thoughts had no business being in Draco’s head. He would never escape the scrutiny that came with his peerage. He could never live quietly with another man. He would
“I wanted this, Harry,” Malfoy said, grabbing his hand. He guided him between his legs, letting Harry feel his heavy erection. He thrust just a little. “I wish we had time to do more, but we don’t, and I don’t trust myself to let you touch me. I might just bend you over the railing if you did.”
“Since the beginning, you’ve tried to make this just about sex.”
Draco felt nothing. “I know.”
“I gave the duke my word to spend the end of the year with him.”
“Don’t look at me like that.”
“I do,” Potter said weakly.
What he didn’t understand was why Parkinson would want him to know. It made him suspicious. He didn’t want someone like her to confide in him, especially when her biggest enemy appeared to be the person who decided whether or not Harry kept his scholarship.
Draco wrapped his long legs around Harry. “Fuck me harder. I want your spunk.”
make him happy? Draco didn’t know.
“Good evening, Mr Potter.” The words were a drawl, the duke feigning a casual air. The high colour in his cheeks betrayed him.
“I’m sorry; old habits die hard.” Theo sucked his teeth, visibly frustrated with himself.
effort is needed in things. Like these violets. They hadn’t been pruned in
Draco wanted to flee. He took a step toward the door.
“Yes, but only because I’m his guest and he’s invested in the health of
“I don’t know.”
He’d wanted Potter in the canteen, even as he glared at Potter. He was Colin Creevey, ready to lick Potter’s shoes.
Someone leaned over him, speaking to him. It was Trelawney. He never thought he’d be so happy to see her. Then he realised he could move.
“Harry wants you to.” She turned her head slightly like she was listening to someone whispering in her ear. “He says he wants to tell you himself.”
Draco scowled. He knew enough to know that ‘house wine’ was usually shit. He opened his mouth but the waiter scurried away.
“Any man who serves our country will do just fine,” said Webbington.
“No, I don’t believe he has.”
The man winked at him. “Something like that.”
Harry let himself just look at the duke. He liked it very much when he smirked like that; it made him look devilish, indecent. He wondered if he smirked like that as he slid deep inside—
Harry made eye contact with the duke, but Harry couldn’t read his expression. The duke almost looked angry.
“There’s nothing more attractive than books,” Granger said seriously, and for the life of him, Harry couldn’t tell if she was joking or not.
“Draco.”
“Because I like it. I like seeing you -”
Harry gulped. “Um … I suppose they should approach firmly but with a smile. Men frighten easily. They need that smile.”
Draco sat back in his chair, drained his piss wine. He drummed his fingers against the table. “I’m not sure. I just might be mad; I mean, I did spend a year in Azkaban.”
Strained, Malfoy muttered something, then pulled his fingers out. He smeared lubricant on himself, then pressed the blunt head of his cock to Harry’s hole.
Harry pulled out some bottles from the magical fridge. “What about a sparkling grape fizzy drink instead?”
His horse took off. They made it only five paces before it stumbled on a hole hidden by snow. The horse went down, nearly crushing Draco. Draco was quick enough to roll out of the way before the animal landed on him.
“I’ve returned,” Draco said stupidly.
“Christmas is almost here.”
,” Draco growled.
The Queen rose from her armchair to greet them. She was stout, grave-faced. Her billowing black skirts encircled her like a cage. “Malfoy,” she said, a bejewelled hand extended. “I am pleased to see you.” She turned her attention to the secretary. “And you are well, Sir Dullborne?”
“I love you,” Harry said, crying hard. “I love you so much.”
“I am terribly lucky to be at Oxford. Do you know I lived in a barn for most of my life?”
Draco kissed him again.
“Let me,” said the duke, dropping hot, open-mouth kisses down Harry’s neck.
Standing, Draco raised his hands. “Look, I can explain.”
“I called the doctor,” Malfoy explained stiffly, “but traveling in the snow is a challenge. He doesn’t think he will get here until tomorrow morning.”
“They aren’t my slaves! How dare you—”
“I will ruin you,” Potter whispered.
Dudley’s face brightened at the thought. “It would be nice for this family’s reputation to finally rebound.”
Draco leaned in, brushed his lips against Harry’s cheek. “Do you even know what men do to me?” he whispered in his ear.
“I don’t know.”
“Harry,” Draco said, taking his hands gently. He drew Harry away from the carriages, into an area behind some trees. No one was close enough to see or hear them. “
Potter peeked at him through his fingers.
“What?” Draco cried, knocking the pillow away.
He thrust harder and harder, the bed thudding against the wall. Draco moaned desperately, still muffled. Harry reached down with his other hand to stroke his cock.
“Yes.”
“I guess,” Malfoy said sadly.
“I could come like this,” Draco whispered.
Harry slumped forward on his chest, utterly depleted. He was emotionally and physically exhausted. Malfoy gently pulled out, then left the bed to retrieve a wet flannel. He gently cleaned Harry between his legs.
“You’re not going to offend me, mind. I understand that you’d be curious. Do you want to know how I got into prostitution?”
Harry got to his feet, his wand in hand. He looked down at Draco, pondering. Then he pointed his wand at him. “
“Your hand is very warm,” Malfoy said.
“Oh my
“But only in private, of course.”
“Right,” Harry said, and stood. He folded the flannel on the side of the bathtub. “I’ll give you some time to yourself. Let me know if you need anything else.”
“It’s my stomach,” Draco managed to say. Then he dropped his arms for Harry to have a look.
. Show the police your gossiping letters. They will laugh in your face.”
“I defer to you, Goyle,” Draco said.
“I certainly tried,” he said dryly. “The duke … wasn’t very interested.”
The director yanked the cravat around his neck. “We regret that our penitentiary is overcrowded, but there has been a shortage—”
Harry had half a mind to help her, but that conversation was for another day.
The director sweated in his chair. He looked so harassed that Harry almost felt bad for him. Almost.
“Don’t look,” Harry murmured.
“Oh,” he said.
“Good.”
The duke raised his eyebrows. His gaze had turned quite chilly. “Mr Potter, would you mind walking Lord Webbington through your many accomplishments?”
Harry touched his hand. “I’m sorry you lost her.”
Harry opened his mouth. He wanted to apologise, he did. But he also wanted to protect the duke. “I’m not worth it,” he whispered.
Draco was pretty sure Potter was having a laugh, so he leaned over and licked Potter’s cheek. When Potter opened his eyes, Draco stuck out his tongue and panted. He put his arse in the air and wiggled it like he had a tail.
The question made Draco pause. He could tell that he had hurt Potter, really hurt him. “I made you feel as if I don’t appreciate you?”
“Of course not,” Harry said lightly. He meant it. There was no way he would let anyone—any
“Shall I begin?” Malfoy said, voice a mere whisper.
She leaned back to take in his expression. Obviously, she expected him to be more surprised. “You should ask Draco to explain. I cannot say more.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered.
here.”
Harry threw open his bedroom door. “What is it?” he asked, distressed.
“Gardening? But why? It’s all under spells.”
“That was a very unique situation, but I concede.”
Draco stood and pulled Harry into his arms. “My love,” he said, and kissed him.
Draco stood. “Please leave.”
“You are embarrassed.”
“But …” Harry trailed off. Anything he said now would offend Malfoy.
“Goodbye,” Malfoy said, and he sounded utterly lost. He put on his hat and walked out of Harry’s life.
“I understand,” he repeated, voice quiet, a little stiff.
“Blackmail,” Draco said softly.
It was day two of Potter’s illness and Draco forced himself to spend the morning looking over his account books in his study. Snow fell in a curtain outside his window. The servants had stoked his fire into a roar. Draco almost rang for a servant so he could order them to check on Potter’s fire.
Potter grabbed his arse and urged him closer, so close. Potter thrust up, trying to meet Draco’s desperate hips. The feeling of their clothed cocks pressing together was addicting.
“What?”
Draco twisted, needing more. “Fuck.”
“Oh, yes!” she crowed. “It was a
“I told you it would dampen the mood.”
“Oh,” Harry said softly.
“Draco,” Harry said, and raised up, then sat back down. Malfoy filled him up nicely, his arse stretched and aching. Harry rested his weight on Malfoy’s chest, then began to ride him oh so slowly.
Trelawney held out her hand again. “Take it, dear. He’s desperate to speak to you.”
Lady Granger was almost smirking. When the servant had gone, she leaned in and said, “Malfoy has even the servants curtsying for you. If that doesn’t show favour, I don’t know what does.”
“Malfoy!” Potter’s voice was full of terror. He rushed toward him, fear twisting his expression. He dropped to his knees next to a panting Draco. “Bloody hell, are you all right?”
“Absolutely not.” Granger came around his front, made brackets with her hands to measure his chest. “Yes, broader in the chest as well. We might have a bit of an issue. I don’t know many noblemen who grew up doing manual labour day in and day out.”
Draco turned to Potter, who was looking at all the items in a stunned sort of way. “Would it be all right if my Pansy joined us later?”
“If she was telling the truth, then I think I found Mr Potter,” Draco said.
Potter sighed. “I think it’s time for you to go home, Garth.”
“Are you ill, Your Grace? Perhaps we better call a doctor.”
“What? Where!”
Potter was breathing hard. Underneath the table, Draco pressed his foot against Potter’s, expecting him to move away. He didn’t.
“Harry,” he whispered, and Harry’s lashes fluttered. Tears burned Draco’s eyes. He couldn’t help it. Dukes didn’t cry, and they especially didn’t cry in
Harry snapped to attention. “I will need to leave soon,” he said abruptly.
“What did he look like?”
But Draco knew enough about mass-produced magical items, knew the strength of their charms. Those needles could easily go for eternity without help from Harry.
Potter blinked several times. He was blushing again. “I don’t - I’m not sure -”
Parkinson made a noise in her throat. “Sit next to me, will you?”
Malfoy frowned. “I supported the Dark Lord. I have the Dark Mark burned into my arm. You should despise me.”
Together they watched the baby emerge from Draco’s stomach. Harry was delirious enough to recall a scene from a sci-fi film.
Potter Conjured some lube and reached down to prepare himself. With slick hands, he helped Draco maneuver into place. He guided Draco’s cock to his hole, then helped him push in.
“I’m taking care of you.”
“It wasn’t a mob,” Draco said.
“For you? Yes.”
“Place it next to the fireplace,” Draco ordered. “Not too close, of course.”
He laughed, a tad shocked at her language. “Yes, it is.”
Draco sipped his coffee, tasting only char. “Oh, I’m good, really good.” He sounded grumpy.
“You like this?” Harry murmured.
Harry was almost convinced he was dreaming. The Duke of Malfoy wanted to
Harry slumped back on the bed. “Yes, okay. I will send you the money right away.”
“You ran away; then you told me to get out of your room.”
Keeping his head down, he escaped the Great Hall and rushed to his room. He felt bad for leaving Ginny waiting for him, but it couldn’t be helped. The good thing was she still had Lady Granger and Lady Parkinson for company.
“No!” Draco vomited again.
“Perhaps both of you should go straight to bed,” Parkinson purred.
Draco’s whole body was lit up from the touch. Potter’s hand had been so warm. Draco motioned to the jug on the bedside table. “Are you thirsty?”
“I want to come on you,” Harry whispered.
Theo scrambled off Draco; he ran for the lounge window - the window with the brilliant view. A curse missed him and hit the glass instead, shattering it. Shards cut Draco’s face but he was unable to shield himself.
Their goal for the day was to hand out as many leaflets as possible. The leaflets decried the Married Women’s Property Act:
Harry was also using this time to research classic Greece. They intended to dock soon to give Harry a few weeks of access to the best classical archives the world had to offer.
“To talk.” Theo shrugged. “Or … for anything, really.”
“What would be better is if I didn’t attend at all.”
Hesitating, Potter kneeled beside him on the mattress. For a long moment all he did was stare down at Draco. Then he rested his palm on his stomach. His touch made Draco tremble a little.
“You shouldn’t have done it.”
“I misspoke, Mr Potter. It was never my intention to make you feel as if you had no choice. Of course you have a choice. You are a free man, entirely in command of your life and your person.”
“Oh,” Malfoy sighed again.
“No, thank you.”
Harry nodded.
“I haven’t a clue what I’m doing here … riding about the countryside with a
“What do you mean?”
“No … it’s not so sharp anymore … it’s a throb now.”
, Draco wanted to respond just so Potter would grin at him again. But the truth was he thought very little about women and voting.
Draco wondered about the topic of the book. How to hoodwink a duke? How to steal from the aristocracy without getting caught? How to be the most beautiful man in the room without even trying?
Harry sighed and rubbed his face. He was lashing out. He was so frustrated about so many things. His stomach grumbled. He was also starving. “I’m sorry,” he said.
“That’s perfectly all right. In my opinion, you won’t be missing much.”
“And gentlemen,” Draco said lazily, his voice loud enough to carry, “I am leaving the Tory party.”
against the law.”
Harry frowned. “Of course I’ll speak to the duke about the Married Women’s Property Act, but I can’t promise to change his mind. He seems quite set on supporting it.”
This made Draco pause. His face was red now, his gaze glittering. “I’ve kissed you on the cheek. A lot.”
“What?”
“Yes,” Harry hissed. He thrust, needing more.
Her small eyes glittered. “Some people think it’s time for you to settle down, Malfoy.”
“I want you to call me Malfoy.”
“Yes.” Of course Harry would help him. “We need to get you to hospital as soon as possible.”
Harry blinked down at him.
Goyle understood exactly what he meant.
“Um.” Now Harry fiddled with his cutlery. This old geezer would find fault in anything he said. “Currently, I’m in the beginning stages of organising Professor Weasley’s expedition to the Mediterranean.”
Goyle nodded and disappeared down the hall.
It took everything in Harry to look into Draco’s eyes. “I’m not innocent, Draco.” He licked his lips. “I’m gay.”
Weasley gave him a hesitant look. “I asked Harry to be my assistant. I asked him to go to Greece with me. At first he declined and said that he was still
“How do you know I’m glaring at you when you’re not even looking at me?”
One of his tenants—Mr Gibbs—was waving Draco down. Draco and Potter stopped, and Gibbs tore his hat off when he stopped at Draco’s horse.
Draco gulped from his wine glass. “I’ve been preoccupied with thoughts of you as well.”
“No, no. I’m fine, or at least I think I’m fine.”
“What?”
Draco cried out. Harry nearly fainted before he realised what he was seeing.
“Yes.”
Maybe. He still wasn’t convinced.
“Sorry … I heard you Apparate. I wanted to make sure nothing was the matter.”
“Who?”
“Thank you for having us,” Lady Granger said stiffly.
“I thought I was your assistant, sir.”
“Oh, fuck,” Harry said, not really believing his eyes.
They turned their attention to the little cakes, and Potter eyed them hungrily. Biting back a laugh, Draco cut an almond cake in half and gave a slice to Potter.
“Harry,” Malfoy said softly. He had set down his fork. His gaze was bright with emotion.
Malfoy set down the bowl and pulled the blanket almost up to Harry’s chin. “Sleep now; I’ll write to your Professor Weasley.”
Still smiling, Dudley retrieved a letter from his breast pocket. He tapped the letter against his knee. “Rumours are circulating about you again.”
Draco walked away before Potter could finish his sentence.
Harry fell into his arms. He pressed his mouth to the hard line of his jaw. “I’ve missed you so much,” he murmured.
Harry pushed up his glasses. “Ma’am?”
Harry met the duke’s hard gaze, then dropped his head. He was ashamed, and the duke looked murderous.
“Hello, Malfoy,” said Granger. “I hope you are having a good day.”
“Good, you’ve come,” Malfoy said to the man. They shared a look, and the man glanced at the servant and motioned to the door.
Goyle’s eyes went wide. “Yes, Your Grace. Follow me.”
When Malfoy was done, he threw the flannel to the side and crawled back into bed. He pulled Harry close, and kissed him on the forehead.
“I guess not … but the people who seek it out are usually not great.”
Nodding, she said, “That is why I need you for this job. You are a thinker, a planner. You are clever.”
“No.”
Harry ignored him. “I mean - can you breathe? Do you feel intense pain on your stomach?” He pressed his ear to Malfoy’s hot chest. “Breathe in and out.”
Harry gaped at him.
, Draco thought, jaw throbbing. He forced himself to take a deep breath and calm down.
“I did.” The duke’s expression was shuttered but his grey eyes were hard as they scrutinised Harry’s face. What was he looking for?
“Nonsense,” Malfoy said. He snapped his fingers and the servant quickly set down a chair next to the bed.
Harry’s head shot up. “No!”
“I don’t understand why you care about me so much.”
Harry felt himself flush deeply. “Um … yeah.”
Draco thrust into his hand involuntarily. “Tell me.”
“You mean to get Mr Potter back, don’t you?”
Malfoy shrugged. “Because I’m Death Eater scum. And because there’s
“Got it,” Harry said to himself, and slammed the book closed. He raced back to Draco.
. Are you mad, Potter?”
Draco was afraid to touch anything. He was sitting in his own home but he was afraid to disturb even the air. Harry was now erasable.
Draco scrubbed the muck from every part of Harry’s body, then thoroughly washed his hair. When he was done, Harry was pink all over. He was fidgeting. Draco helped him stand up, the water trailing down his body. His cock was half hard.
Harry clutched him, his fingers smoothing across rich fabric. His entire world was the duke, and he wanted it, oh, did he want it.
“Trust me,” Draco grunted.
Granger shrugged. “Everything in this castle belongs to him. He doesn’t wear these items of clothing, if that’s what you mean. He has wardrobes such as these for his guests.”
“No,” Harry said to his cabinets. “I want you to come back.”
“I am honoured that you show me such kindness, Your Grace.”
“I believe we heard about it.”
“You’re home early.”
He’d wanted Potter for ages; that was the truth of it. He’d thought about him during the war, in the Manor, hiding away from the Dark Lord. He’d thought about in Azkaban, in his cell, doing his best not to freeze to death.
“Get dirty?” Malfoy cocked an eyebrow.
“I’m not sure if this is a good idea,” Potter said, frowning.
“My God, aren’t you leading the opposition campaign?” said Lord Webbington. “What in the world has got into you, Malfoy?”
“Tell me,” he growled.
The brute shoved Harry hard. “Get out of the way!”
“He was close enough! He didn’t want Muggleborns attending Hogwarts. That’s pretty evil in my books.”
The duke raised a sleek blond eyebrow. “Do you intend to freeze to death? We are expecting snow tonight.”
Awkwardly, Draco wrote the note. “Make haste, Gibbs.”
“Do you want to fuck me?” Draco snarled.
of him, but he enjoyed the bustle of London, rubbing shoulders with strangers, catching mouthfuls of coffee aroma from the cafes.
“Certainly, sir.”
In the morning, Harry came downstairs to find another stack of Galleons waiting for him on the coffee table. He Spelled them into a warded cabinet. He would save all the money Malfoy gave him, and when the time was right, he would hand it all back to him.
“Yes, I do.”
“Sir … this is a Spoons.”
Turning his attention away from them, he instead listened in on the conversations around him. The problems of the aristocracy seemed incredibly foreign to him. They complained about land taxes, overbooked hotels on the French Riviera, a malfunctioning yacht. Harry imagined telling them about all his woes:
“I see,” Draco said, disappointed. “Thank you for your time.” He and Goyle left.
Harry went to the door and knocked softly. For a moment, all that greeted him was silence, but then the door inched open.
“My intention is to make my way to the nearest village. I believe I’m only an hour or two away from my destination.”
Tears trailed down his cheeks. “Draco … I’m no one, I’m nothing. You deserve a proper family.”
“They can, trust me.”
“Um, yeah. Sure.”
“I’m afraid,” Draco whispered, not sure if he wanted Goyle to hear him. He and Goyle had been more like friends for a while now, but Goyle was still under his employment.
“Draco, my love.”
The book had a section called
Theo went over to the photographs. He stared at them for so long that Draco almost asked him if anything was wrong.
Draco hoped desperately that Potter stayed away, but of course he knew Potter was not the kind of person to hide when his friends put themselves at risk.
“No, please,” Potter said. Then he seemed to realise he had grabbed the Duke of Malfoy and released him quickly.
Wrapping his arms around Potter, Draco whispered, “Will you fuck me now? Finally?”
The duke glanced at him again, a slight flush crawling up his neck. It was as if he could hear Harry’s thoughts.
“Yes, Your Grace.” The director popped up from his chair and dashed to the door. “Please follow me, Your Grace.”
“Oh? I wasn’t aware, ma’am.”
Draco took up his warm palm and pressed a kiss to it. He suddenly didn’t want to look at Harry. “What is it?” he whispered.
The next morning, Harry woke up a little later than usual and found himself alone in the house. On the kitchen table was a pot of tea and a bowl for porridge under a stasis charm. There was no note.
me,” Draco hissed.
“It will be fine, I promise,” Draco said. “Just follow my lead. All my horses are well-trained.”
“Why do they hate one another?”
“Protect yourself,” Harry said, now only a voice. Then: “Goodbye, sweetheart.”
“They released me because of you.”
, which revealed a streak of blood on the brick wall. Oh, hell.
Hands shaking a little, Harry pulled the coat out of the box. The material was velvety and thick. He had never owned such a nice piece of clothing. “I can’t accept this,” he said faintly.
Draco sat back and scrutinized Potter. “Why did you save me from Azkaban?”
“Stop,” Harry said, mouth trembling. He stared out the window again. He didn’t want to look at the duke. He couldn’t. After a few minutes of silence, he asked, “Where are we going?”
Malfoy smirked. “Yes, well. That’s why I hired him.” He moved a chair closer. In his hands was a velvet-bound book. “Do you enjoy poetry?”
“Um.”
It was incredible, unbelievable.
Potter stood up, came around the chessboard. He dropped to a knee and took Draco’s face between his warm palms. He stared deeply into Draco’s eyes.
“DO YOU THINK I HAVE A CUDDLE WITH ALL MY MATES?”
Draco pulled him closer again. “And why the hell not?”
Malfoy moved around him quietly. It was relaxing to listen to the gentle movement of his robes, his soft breathing. He laid his hands gently on Harry’s back. His hands were warm, soothing.
Harry flinched a little. He twisted his hands together in his lap. “I’ve said too much, haven’t I?”
They were out in Parliament Square for only a few minutes when the first police arrived. Harry’s insides turned liquidy. He never cared for the police, and these ones looked quite angry about being outside on such a gloomy, frigid day.
Malfoy smelled woodsy, sweet. He smelled expensive. “I tried to stay away,” he murmured.
“Brilliant.” Goyle grinned and cracked his knuckles.
“With ribbon and fruit and little cakes.”
Potter sputtered. “
At night, once Harry had exhausted himself by studying and researching, his eyes feeling sucked from their sockets, he lay on his sad, old bed with the coat spread out next to him. He ran his hand over its lush fabric, and it reminded him of the duke, and everything the duke had done for him.
Harry thought about the duke, not the man standing before him. His flushed deepened. “It was a night to remember.”
, Harry thought as he watched Malfoy bob his head up and down. A bright streak of red engulfed his cheeks. His dark blond eyelashes fluttered. He looked like he was really enjoying himself.
He couldn’t wrap his head around the fact Harry lay in that wooden box in fancy robes, motionless, utterly motionless. He couldn’t wrap his head around the fact Harry would never smile again. He would never laugh again. He would never kiss Draco softly on the lips and whisper,
“Pardon for waking you, but the duke has requested to see you.”
“What if I wasn’t a duke? Would you spend Christmas with me then?”
It was half past eleven, and there was still a couple of hours before Draco would arrive home.
“Yes. No. Does it matter?”
“You should get up. I will make you breakfast.”
“All right,” Harry said warily.
Chaos erupted among the MPs. Harry yelled too. He was on his feet, nearly climbing over the half-wall. Draco looked over and caught his eye.
the duke could be one of the good ones.”
“I suppose they are locked up somewhere?”
“But …”
Potter’s cheeks went deliciously pink. “Not really … my cousin sometimes put one up, but it was a dull thing. If I were to dress one, I’d want mine covered in candles and yummy sweets.”
Weasley moved around him to make sure the office door was closed. When he turned back to face Harry, his deep flush had spread to his face. “There seems to be something between us.”
“Take some time to think about it. I can wait.”
“Harry, please calm down. I am a duke; of course I speak to the Queen. Believe me, it’s all relative.”
“Yes, but he looked quite beastly,” said the secretary.
“Oh, yes, I can. I can do anything I please.”
The duke’s eyes were black as they took in his cock. He wrapped a hand around him, and stroked.
“We couldn’t … it wouldn’t be legally binding.”
“You’re not a murderer.”
This made Malfoy laugh. He had a nice laugh.
Harry’s face flushed in shame. “I am very busy. You understand.”
Gently, Malfoy pulled almost all the way out. His breath stuttered, then he thrust back in, a little harder. “Fuck, I love you.”
Potter frowned. “That’s not the same … those people … your profit depends on their health. Calling that doctor was beneficial to your bottom line.”
“You did well,” Draco said, breathing in Potter’s fresh scent. His nose trailed along his hair.
There was a knock on the door. “Come in,” Draco ordered.
Another round of snorts.
For several minutes, all Harry could do was press his hands against the marble of the wall and suck in breath. He was on the verge of hyperventilating.
. It was awfully uncomfortable sleeping in all that hay.”
“Okay.”
He was lost and didn’t know how to work his way back to Diagon Alley. He was stuck between two damp alleys; he turned in a circle, looking for anything he recognised. The windows were blind. The doorways mere shadows. He smelled the reek of rubbish.
Goyle shrugged. “He’s not from town, but he knows how to survive. I reckon his heart is too big for his own good.”
The man hesitated. “Sir?”
“It’s the opposite now,” Draco said, and leaned in for a kiss. Ron quickly averted his eyes.
Draco just stared up at him with his big black eyes filled with so much love.
polished wardrobes.
“But—what have I done?”
Lady Granger gave a start in her chair. “Pardon me?”
“Harry, shut up,” Malfoy said tiredly.
“I get it now.” Harry made his way over to the flowers and got to work.
Harry lowered his head to taste him. He dragged his tongue up his shaft, whirled his tongue around his head. Draco whined and thrust needily.
“Sure,” Potter said.
“I want to get a drink -”
Part of him had understood Potter’s reluctance to spend the Christmas holidays at Malfoy Castle. It was ludicrous, wasn’t it? People
Harry had been walking for a while when he heard the galloping horse. Harry’s first instinct was to hide—the duke had sent someone to
Harry realised the duke was holding him like a damsel, like a lover.
Draco had been preoccupied since saving Harry from the poorhouse. And that was exactly what he had done. Draco had
Finally Weasley looked him in the eye. He stepped closer and Harry ignored the urge to move back. “Harry …” His voice was very quiet.
Glowering right back at her, he said, “I don’t have any money on me. However, my valet …”
“Oh,” Draco said, twisting the serviette in his grasp. “That’s nice for them, I guess.”
Moaning, Malfoy closed his mouth over him, sucking. Harry pressed his face to a pillow and cried.
There was an explosion of colourful flowers. The flowers were open mouths, greedily sucking in bugs. Their petals were soft, luxurious, tempting.
“I heard you study at Oxford,” said the rude skeletal man next to Harry.
He threw open his door and found the duke staring at him. “Get in here!” Harry said anxiously.
“I said leave us alone!”
Harry was struck speechless. “That’s not how one decorates a nursery! Maybe Dracula, but not you or me.”
? Dear God.”
“You did wonders for my Maddy, thank you,” Mr Gibbs said. He bowed to Draco. “Thank you very much, Your Grace. Your work was a wonder, it was.”
Malfoy just looked at him as Harry continued to hold him. Harry knew he should let him go but his hands had other ideas.
“The sun’s made your hair darker,” Harry said as they chopped some onion and mushrooms.
“Oh, thank you, Your Grace! Thank you very much!” Gibbs bowed so low his head was nearly in the mud.
They made it to the dance floor, and Ginny showed him how to hold her. “You must lead, unfortunately,” she said.
“Your client - what happened?”
Granger gave another flinch in her chair. Her hands had curled in her skirts. “If he merely wanted a wife who could be a platonic companion, then yes.”
“Good.” Draco wanted to shove him to his back, rip down both their trousers. He wanted to rut in the cold, cold snow, feel Potter hot and hard beneath him. “I need to get my steed.”
Malfoy shrugged, now avoiding his gaze. “I didn’t before but I had to learn. It was either learn how to cook or starve.”
The first course was something red and green and gelatin. Warily, Harry dipped his spoon into the concoction, hoping he was using the correct spoon. The gelatin was bursting with crisp cranberry flavour.
Harry had to admire the Society’s pluck. Most people didn’t see anything wrong with women giving absolutely everything to their husbands, and convincing them otherwise would be an uphill battle. Harry was ready for the fight. He believed women should be equal to men in the eyes of the law. Every person should be equal.
“Shut up both of you!” Harry snarled. The portraits glared right back at him.
“All right.” He tried to pull Malfoy into a standing position but Malfoy was no longer conscious. He was all dead weight.
, Harry?”
, not you.”
“I don’t want anyone else.”
“Of course, Your Grace.” Potter dropped his gaze.
Ginny bit her lip and gazed at the twirling couples. “Will you dance with me?”
“He denied everything that happened between us. When that didn’t work, he said I had blackmailed him into doing it. He said I was jealous of his wealth, of his fiancee, and I wanted to ruin a nobleman’s life. He said he was my victim.”
Draco almost said,
“You must not spend the holidays alone. I forbid it.”
was a loaded term. It could mean a great many things, including lover.
“Call me
Malfoy took up the flannel left on Harry’s bedside table. He dipped it carefully in the steaming basin of water. He wrung it out, the ring on his pinkie gleaming.
Draco carried him into the bathroom. The air was foggy with steam. He carefully lowered Harry to his feet, then began to undress him.
Potter’s pulse thudded in his neck. His pupils had gone wide, his lips parted. “Yeah.”
“Then why do you continue to reject me? You want to be with me; I see the desire in your eyes, I feel it in your cock.
Potter still seemed hesitant; but whatever reservations he held crumbled. He closed the space between them and pulled Draco into a desperate kiss. Draco clung to him.
Guards yanked him through a dark archway, then slammed a gigantic steel gate closed. Harry was the one man in the group of arrests, and the women around him were crying openly. Harry wanted to join them, but he was too numb for tears.
“No,” Potter said slowly.
“You didn’t say anything either.”
per month? “Yes, cousin. That sounds reasonable.”
“Yes, Your Grace.”
“Ah.” Malfoy moved closer, his hands now behind his back. His gaze never left Harry’s face. “You look better, healthier. Good.”
“Why?” Malfoy’s voice was soft.
Draco reached down and showed Potter how he liked to be wanked. Potter tightened his fist, quickened his strokes. Draco thrust needily into his palm.
Potter was left to gape at him.
Draco narrowed his gaze. “I cannot support your cause. I head the opposite campaign. Did you know?”
“You seemed to be enjoying yourself,” he said.
“Good.”
“I know, Harry.
Draco had decided to give every one of his tenants a bundle of firewood for Christmas. It would have been a headache to organise even if they had months; however, Draco told Carter he had merely a day.
“Oh, God,” Harry said, hips still jutting, his knees shaking. He had made a mess of the duke’s appearance. He hadn’t a clue how the duke could walk away unnoticed after it.
Harry wanted to snap, but he knew that would be unfair to Kimberly. She worked day and night to care for their children, all five of them, but Dudley couldn’t seem to stop giving her more.
“Don’t.”
Draco couldn’t think. He drummed with tension. “Who is he?” he growled, pressing Potter against the wall.
Sighing, Draco turned away from the window. His valet Goyle was already preparing his paper and pen.
Goyle shrugged.
“Hello, Mr Potter,” Granger said, completely ignoring Parkinson. Granger looked elegant in a midnight blue gown and black gloves.
“I came to pay my respects.” Theo gave him a soft smile.
“Shh, my love,” Malfoy said, his finger still gently fucking him. “I’ve got you.”
Potter cocked his head. “I like hearing you say
“You can’t quit. Dukes are not liberals, and liberals are not dukes.”
All along, he had known it would end like this.
The man’s face closed like a book. “You play a risky game. Now get out of my way.”
“No, I think I got it.” Malfoy began to strip off his clothes, wincing terribly. Harry stepped forward, raised his hands. He hated seeing Malfoy in pain. Malfoy paused and tilted his head. He looked a little shy. “Do you … want to help?”
“Personal reasons?”
Draco paused in the middle of his first sip of tea. “I forgot,” he said softly. “Did everyone see?”
Hours later, they returned home. Ronaldo smelled intensely of Potter, and it took everything in Draco not to growl at him.
“He grew up on a farm,” Draco muttered, spotting an abattoir. “Wouldn’t he look for work that he knows?”
“Yes?” Draco murmured.
He waited for a long moment for Malfoy to say something else; but Malfoy remained quiet. Slowly, they picked up their forks again and finished their supper.
“A dreadful part of the world, I assure you.”
Harry’s smile was stiff but polite. “I don’t understand.”
“I needed a place to work, Your Grace.”
“Be clear.”
“Malfoy.”
Draco and Harry were even getting away with living together. There were whispers about them in the newspapers, but it was so coded that the common reader just thought Harry was Draco’s evil best friend who was stealing money from the dukedom and having affairs with every woman he came across.
homosexual!”
“You received a letter from the Prince of Wales,” Harry said with interest. He handed over the letter to Draco.
“It’s not like that,” Potter said, still panting.
“I want to touch you! I want … you.”
“And why is that? You no longer find me attractive?”
At the castle, he told a wide-eyed Watkins to hold his steed. “I will return momentarily,” he said. He ventured inside, ignoring the swarm of servants trying to take his coat, his boots.
“NO, BAD DOG!” Potter cried. He yanked Draco off Ronaldo and punted him across the room. Draco howled as he flew through the air.
Draco guided Potter’s hand to his stiffy. He felt a tremor go through Potter.
“Hold tight,” Draco murmured, and a thrill shot through him when Potter’s arms wrapped themselves around his waist. Draco leaned back, wanting to feel every inch of Potter’s front. Potter’s groin was snug against his bum.
“The conservative party doesn’t care about prison reform. You would be going against your own self interest.”
“He forgot, most likely. It’s tradition, and the servants know to plan and organise it without instruction.”
“I see,” Potter said coldly.
Draco yanked back. “What?”
, Harry thought.
Still smiling, Harry closed his eyes. He fell asleep to the sound of the duke’s smooth, comforting voice.
The duke’s face softened just a little. “You are Lady Parkinson’s guest. Therefore, my guest. And you will be treated as such.”
let the liberals win.”
“Do you?”
Draco very much liked the idea of tracking old cousin Dudley down, but something told him Harry wouldn’t want Dudley involved. Afterall, Harry hadn’t run back to Kent.
“You are a man of few belongings,” Draco said.
Mrs Gibbs looked ashamed. “Yes, but money is tight, Your Grace. I—we couldn’t afford it this month.” She hung her head.
Harry opened his mouth to answer but a knock on the door interrupted him. “Come in,” he said.
“First, I apologise for the delay, sir,” he answered in his gruff voice. “His Grace had his contacts at the London Metropolitan Police Department keep an eye out for your name. His Grace was worried about what would occur at the protest; he wanted to make sure you were safe, sir.”
Harry and the women were separated, and he was yanked through multiple large, stoney doors. He thought he would be thrown into a holding cell, but instead he was pushed into a musty antechamber.
time for you to find a wife. You are a duke, Malfoy. Young. Well-bred.
think it’s strange?”
Harry did what she said and kept his chin up. He sneaked glances at the duke.
Draco’s face twisted. “
A small audience waited for them in the drawing room. Ginny was the first one to reach Harry.
“Hagrid isn’t smelly!”
When he was done, he methodically cleaned up; then he decided to head out to the garden.
Harry blocked the man’s path. The man’s eyes narrowed at him. Up close, Harry noticed the colour of his hair—white blond.
“What does that mean?”
Draco tilted his head. “Then it really is Theo?”
“What happened to them?” Malfoy asked.
Draco wanted to hold him close, soothe him; but he forced himself to step back when two servants came to Potter’s aid.
They charged from the clearing at a neck-breathing pace. Potter yelped and clung to Draco.
“Waste?” Potter was still blinking.
Mr Gibbs raced out to take Draco’s tired steed. “Treat her well,” Draco ordered. “A tired horse is bound to make mistakes.”
“What about Keats?”
“You can. I promise.”
Potter gaped at him. “You’re actually jealous.”
Potter had been finishing up paperwork, his hand covered in ink. He looked up at Draco and his eyes brightened. “Shut the door, will you?”
“Yes, but why did you agree? Did I
Harry surged forward. He reached out as if to touch Draco. He dropped his hand. “I wish I could hold you but I’m only wisp.”
“I love you, too. Now put another finger inside me. I’m ready.”
Malfoy’s mouth turned down. “You eat like a barbarian.”
Draco forced all expression from his face. His heart was racing, his mind a blur. Harry couldn’t be … No, it was unthinkable. Harry was young and strong, and somewhat healthy.
Draco bobbed his head, licking and licking. He made it messy, getting Potter wet with his drool. Potter’s scent filled his nose.
“You just caused a tremendous scandal for yourself!”
someone like himself could never trust a man so common.
Later, once he was washed and dressed, he tried to sneak past the dining hall but a voice called out to him. He halted, closing his eyes, taking a deep breath. He turned around to see Lady Granger approaching him.
“His record should be expunged and the court informed his case has been dropped.”
Harry touched where the man had held him. He could still feel the man’s strong, elegant fingers gripping his flesh. “Yes, of course I am. The gentleman just wasn’t interested.”
“I’m not like everyone.”
Draco hesitated, not wanting to break Pansy’s trust.
“Oh, no, no, Your Grace.” Harry still smiled.
“Yes, well, even a duke does foolish things.” Malfoy set down the flannel, took up a bowl of broth. He dipped the spoon into the broth, then pressed the spoon to Harry’s lips.
“I feel the contractions.”
Draco relaxed against the bed, still trembling. Potter looked down at the come webbing his fingers; then he slid two fingers into his mouth, tasting. Draco covered his face, unable to watch.
“You should look up,” Rose said with a tiny smirk.
close with him now. You mustn’t waste this opportunity.”
“Perhaps you will understand one day,” she said, then looked back at Lady Granger. “How about you come for a weekend? I’m sure the duke would love to have you.”
“Oh, yes, a
“Oh,” Harry stuttered.
Harry’s head snapped up to look at him. “Oh.”
Potter covered his face with both hands. “Christ.”
“Are you ill?” Potter asked, concerned.
“Harry,” Draco said softly, turning onto his side. “Has it ever occurred to you that you rarely think of yourself?”
Harry understood. He drew Malfoy into an embrace. “Will you have dinner with me sometime? I’ve wanted to ask you out, but I wasn’t sure if you would say yes.”
“Mr Potter,” said Lady Hermione Granger, secretary of the National Society of Women’s Suffrage. “Share your thoughts on how young women should approach men in public and hand them a leaflet.”
Draco was distracted by his mouth. He was always distracted by Potter’s mouth. Potter thought he was so beneath him, so inadequate compared to Draco’s title, but what Potter didn’t know was Draco would drop to his knees right then and there for him, in the mud, in the snow. He’d get on his hands and knees for Potter,
“You can’t give me your coat to wear.”
“Yeah.” Theo rubbed the back of his neck. The gesture reminded Draco so much of Harry that it made him ache.
“I heard,” she said.
“I would like to write to this Professor Weasley on your behalf. Explain the situation.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said impatiently, “but
Harry squeezed his eyes closed. “
Now alert, Harry grabbed his wand and crouched down next to him. He rested his hand on his back. Draco was burning up.
“I had an accident on my horse today. I nearly died.”
“All I ask is for you to try,” Granger said.
“Sir!” called the person on the horse.
Malfoy sat down, his knees nearly brushing the blankets. “Mr Potter must be famished. Bring him his dinner and pour fresh hot water in his basin. Oh, and find me the softest flannel in the cupboard. Be quick about it.”
Draco rode his steed hard back to the castle, making record time. He passed the supplies house, but decided not to stop. He would have Carter’s job if he didn’t give Gibbs that firewood.
“I told you,” he grumbled.
Ronaldo paused mid-stride. He turned toward the sound. “Hello?”
“Tell me something I don’t already know.” Malfoy gulped, still staring up. “What about my baby? Did it … survive the attack?”
“Have a seat. We need to talk.”
“Lady Parkinson and I do not have a relationship,” Granger snapped, a red flush creeping up her neck. “We are merely acquainted, that is all.”
“I heard him say he was from Kent. A farm boy. He did his best to keep up with the work, but it’s not easy. The men who own the stables are evil, sir. They are. All businessmen in St Giles are. They just take and take from the poor, and when we can’t give anything else, they throw us out on the streets.”
“Yes.” Harry was still crying. He had no idea Draco had secured his room again. He didn’t have the words to thank Draco properly.
let me pick out your outfit for the duke’s New Year’s Eve ball!”
Ginny touched his hand on the bed. “I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s a tight knit circle out here in Wiltshire. There’s not much going on so people gossip just to entertain themselves.”
“I suppose so,” Harry said, but the idea of spending Christmas with a duke made his insides quiver.
yours?”
Granger ground her teeth. “Good. It’s set then.”
“Christmas,” Potter gasped, pulling away.
“How could you stop me, Harry?” Dudley looked mournful.
“The thing is … I have this extra ticket to the Royal Albert Hall. It’s an opera, of course. I don’t know. I thought perhaps you would care to join me?” There was hope in Weasley’s voice.
Draco took himself in hand to tease his rim with his sticky head. “Are you sure? I don’t want to exhaust you …”
“Oh, bugger.”
“Perhaps we need to do more than just meet with the members?” Miss Brown said, her grumpy chaperone Mrs Bleakman by her side.
Kissing his shoulder, Malfoy gently withdrew. He urged Harry onto his back, and Harry saw his blissed out expression. He looked utterly relaxed, his face flushed pink, his eyes lidded. Smiling, he gave Harry a gentle, lingering kiss.
“Draco,” Harry said sleepily, and tilted his head up to kiss him. Malfoy met his lips hungrily, their tongues brushing, moving together. Desire throbbed through Harry, and he realised he wanted Malfoy again.
wants you to marry.”
The policeman tried to hit Harry with his baton, but Harry shoved him away. “Don’t you dare! We are petitioning peacefully.
Draco turned into an alcove for rubbish. The stench was terrible but he kept his wand raised. He waited for the person to pass. Several minutes went by before Draco stepped back out in the open. He was alone on the street.
She gave him her hand, and he gently pressed his mouth to the warm satin of her glove. “You look splendid tonight, Potter. Has Draco got a look at you yet?”
A servant peeked into the room. “My apologies for interrupting, sir, but I have a delivery for you.”
“Oh, that’s good,” Harry sighed.
“You can be a cold man, I can tell, but you are not cold to me.”
“Nothing has changed about my politics, or what I desire for my life. I can only give you what I have already laid out to you.”
. Yes, that was quite evident. He was looking forward to seeing Lady Granger and Lady Parkinson interact.
“It’s the novelty of it, I guess,” Draco said with a shrug.
“It’s not your fault you fell ill.” Malfoy’s mouth curled in a ghost of a smirk. “Well, mostly not your fault.”
“Sorry I’m late,” he whispered to her.
Draco whispered louder: “Help.
“I wasn’t thinking any of that.”
“Do you think you’ll ever take down the photographs?” Theo motioned to the chimneypiece.
Draco made space for himself between Potter’s gorgeous thighs. He took Potter into his mouth, going all the way down. Potter groaned and dropped his head back.
“Thank you,” Harry murmured sleepily.
Trelawney glided into his flat. She chimed like a musical clock. It was all her necklaces and bracelets. “You should have a seat, dear,” she said before Draco could ask her what the hell she was doing at his flat.
“Um. Yes.” Draco stepped aside for her.
“I know; but you can and you will.”
Harry’s eyes fluttered. His lips curled up.
. Malfoy’s body emitted different colour smoke; Harry thoroughly examined each curl.
“I don’t understand.”
Draco hummed and kissed his neck. There was lube next to the lounge chair; it was warmed from the sun. Carefully, Draco worked Harry open with two fingers. Harry was a little loose from all the shagging they had been doing.
Potter asked for a bland pint but Draco looked at him and smirked. “Are you paying?”
Draco sat up gingerly. “Theo’s dead.”
“Yes, Your Grace.” Pansy lowered her eyes, the smirk still firming in place.
Draco untied Potter’s horse from the tree and pulled himself into the saddle. Using the strength in his thighs to steady the horse, he reached down to Potter, offering him his arm. “Mount up behind me. There you go.”
Harry had a terrible night. He ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza but was barely able to eat a slice. He spent hours pacing his parlour, grumbling.
“For good reason,” he said moodily.
“Slower,” Potter whispered.
Draco couldn’t handle his tenderness. He slid from his chair to kneel between Potter’s thighs. Without looking at Potter, he began to unbuckle his belt.
Harry forced his gaze to Malfoy’s face. Malfoy’s mouth twisted in a smirk, but something vulnerable and hesitant lurked in his eyes.
The guard’s expression remained dull. “Come with me.”
“I went to live with my mother’s family in Kent. They needn’t take me in, but they needed a servant. My childhood … it wasn’t good.”
In response, Harry dropped to his knees. He took Draco into his mouth, and sucked.
“I’m fine,” Harry said, still struggling to meet his gaze.
Draco shouldered on his coat and shoved on his hat. “Let’s go now. I’ve done enough waiting.”
Potter, still upset about his destroyed trainers and now cautious when he introduced new people to Draco, didn’t even let Ginger Hagrid in the same room as Draco. Draco barked and cried, but Potter told his ugly shag that his dog was
“I would be arrested, thrown back into Millbank. It would be a scandal, and your reputation would never recover from it.”
The pound assistant opened the door for Potter, and Draco rushed into his arms. Potter laughed and held him close, and Draco went wild as he tried to lick Potter’s face.
Harry had never worn clothing so nice. “Thank you, Your Grace.”
He was terrified that he’d run into the duke at any moment.
“I’m not going to leave you.” Harry went to the hallway toilet and grabbed a flannel and soap. For some reason, it mattered that he cleaned Malfoy up by hand.
Harry frowned again. “But why?”
It was Pansy’s turn to sigh. “Oh, yes. Very unpredictable.” Her voice had turned a touch mournful. Pansy very much still carried a torch for Lady Granger.
“What?”
“You don’t want to turn your kin into your enemy.”
Harry was too much of a Gryffindor to ignore it. He moved into the alley, stepping carefully. He muttered a
“I’m just thrilled you’re having a New Year’s Eve party this year, Your Grace,” said Greengrass. “Will there be fireworks?”
“Malfoy wants you to be warm, Harry,” Granger said. “We all want you to be warm. Warm and healthy.”
with someone else.”
“Twenty years is quite a long time to serve,” said the duke, “but I can’t help but worry about a man’s employment once he leaves.”
“I’m a prostitute,” Malfoy said snottily.
Draco caressed Harry’s cheek with a thumb. “If it involves me, shouldn’t I know? I need to protect myself, Harry.”
Draco had been happy too; so damn happy. Towels were stupid, so stupid. His world was full of light when Harry was with him.
Theo’s lips twitched in a frown. “It’s only been a few months since Potter’s death. It makes sense that you would be - well, you know.”
Sighing, Potter pulled away. “This is madness, utter madness. We shouldn’t even be in the same room, let alone …”
“What is your first name? Your Christian name?” Harry asked suddenly, interrupting him.
“You’re a very big boy,” Potter murmured. He wrapped his hand around Draco and stroked. Draco stuck out his tongue and panted harder.
“Yes, I think Mugwort would do you some good,” Potter said thoughtfully. “Also fennel and chamomile. Chasteberry would also be a brilliant choice, but I doubt we could get our hands on some.”
“Err … the main one.”
The man looked up and right at Harry. A cold grey gaze pierced through him. Harry felt revealed,
“Good morning.”
This made the duke flinch. His back straightened. “I have offended you.”
“Yes,” he answered oh so softly.
“Let me be!” Harry cried.
He left the alcove on shaky legs. He looked around, hoping to God he was alone, and he was relieved when he didn’t see anyone.
Smirking, Draco read over the letter. He blinked in surprise. “His Royal Highness is asking if we could join him in Scotland in the autumn. He would like to meet you.”
Harry’s eyes lit up. “Really?”
They sat at his rickety table, a few candles circling them. Theo sipped his wine, his gaze almost shy as he stared at Draco.
“Please,” Harry said. “Please make love to me.”
“I don’t judge you or anything,” Ginny said quickly. “My family is poor and I’ve got six other siblings. I was definitely teased about it in school.”
“I don’t understand.”
They ate in silence for a while before Malfoy asked, “Why do you live here?”
Draco approached the royal apartment and handed his hat and greatcoat to a footman. Then he turned his attention to the secretary’s protection officer, the one who had just escorted both him and Secretary Dullborne from Parliament.
“No.” Malfoy sighed. “And if they did, I wouldn’t care. You mean more to me than some gossip.”
But first, Draco wanted to fuck Potter. Get him on his back. He could take Potter on a ride into the countryside, into the forest. Just the two of them. No one would have to know. He would bugger Potter among the dirt and leaves, make him come so hard, make them both come so hard, and
Gulping, Harry said, “No, I don’t mind.” He got on his knees and reached for a flannel. He cast a soap spell with a lot of fragrant suds. He rubbed the flannel over Malfoy’s shoulders, his chest. He averted his gaze but still noticed the way Malfoy’s pink tits pebbled.
“Not necessarily,” Granger said, her expression glacial.
A clerk sat behind a desk with an enormous ledger opened in front of him. He barely even looked at Harry.
“Why wouldn’t it be proper?” Granger said innocently.
“Hello, Granger. Would you like a cup of tea as well?”
“Please don’t tell me these clothes belong to the duke.”
“I think I love you,” Harry said, and leaned down to kiss him. Draco panted into his mouth.
Harry dropped his hands. He turned back around to face Malfoy. “What?”
“Why? Am I making you hard?”
“Oh?”
Sighing, he set down his ink pen and leaned back in his grand chair. It was dangerous to be this obsessed with anyone, let alone a commoner. Draco should be concerned for his tenants, his land, especially during a snowstorm. But he only had space for Potter in his head.
The men around him laughed heartily. “What a
lives.
The servant cursed and galloped away. Harry listened to his retreat until the horizon swallowed the sound.
Harry was sure about three of his childhood homes could fit inside the ornate structure.
“They?”
“Thank you, sir.” Harry blushed a little. Weasley wasn’t that much older than him, but it was still thrilling to receive compliments from a professor.
, but he knew the question would only offend Potter, scare him off.
“I want you,” Draco said, withdrawing a little for breath. They still shared saliva.
When Draco went back inside, he was startled to see Potter leaning close to Mrs Gibbs and feeling her stomach.
“Yes, Your Grace,” huffed the servants. Another group dragged in two chests of decorations and platters filled with freshly baked cakes.
“It feels like a betrayal.”
Harry raised his eyebrows but he followed her.
“I don’t.” A pause, then: “I can’t stop thinking about you, Harry.”
Scooting closer, Malfoy touched the hot flannel to Harry’s forehead. “Do you mind if I touch you in a familiar manner? I only mean to soothe.”
They were pressed together, chest to chest. The duke’s breath burned against Harry’s face.
Things had been strange between Harry and Malfoy. They had always been strange, but lately there had been more tension, more things left unsaid. Malfoy was bent - just like Harry. He was bent, but he was also the team healer. He seemed quite distracted when Harry walked into the room.
The servant delicately laid the box on his bed, then curtsied. “It’s from His Grace, sir.”
“Do you want to see me do it? It wouldn’t take very long ...”
“Don’t you understand? I will give you everything. You will
Potter was quiet as he scraped his fork against his plate, picking up every last drop of gooey cheese. “I only know what it seems like on the outside. The only place I see you smile is in the canteen.”
Harry ground his teeth in worry. “Do you think you have internal bleeding?”
“Yes.”
“No,” Malfoy said, his tone strange. He sounded almost angry.
you to stay?”
“Draco -”
Lady Granger turned back to the rest of the group. She had a fierce determination in her eyes. “Now, listen closely, especially the new members. Do not take what we are about to do lightly. You must follow these steps. One: identify a man of influence. Two: approach, as Mr Potter suggested, firmly but with a smile. Three: Try not to be afraid. They can sense fear.”
Draco’s eyes burned with unshed tears.
Draco squeezed his hands in his lap. For some reason, the thought of accepting Theo’s help felt like a betrayal to Harry. But, then again, he needed all the help he could get.
“It’s a slum.”
“I didn’t mean for this to happen.”
“Good,” Draco said. “Can we now talk about something else?”
Dursley looked unsure. “Let me go! I want out! This is kidnapping, it is!”
“He said he needed to think about it?” Draco now felt bolted to the floor.
Potter was just so damn
“Do you want to stop for the day, Your Grace?”
“Do you know anything about this?” he asked her.
“I mean - of course you can do whatever you want. I would never - but - no, there’s no but. I would never stop you, or try to stop you. Of course I couldn’t stop you. You’re a powerful wizard and I’m - I’m -”
“That’s great news,” Harry said.
Harry went to the toilet to wash off the flannel, then returned to the bed. He wiped away the blood from Malfoy’s nose and chin, his long neck. He saw Malfoy’s pulse thudding in his throat. Malfoy swallowed.
“I don’t think they are acceptable. I said as much when speaking to the director. First thing tomorrow morning, I will write to the board, demand a meeting with them.”
. Harry shivered.
Harry realised what he had to say. It would ruin him, but he knew it was the only way.
Draco laughed, then caught his breath when Harry began to grind against him. “
This made the duke do a double-take. Then his expression cleared. “Ah,” he said, mostly to himself. “Now I’ve
Harry touched his arm, asking him to stop. They stared into each other's eyes.
Harry felt himself flush again. There was a sly gleam in Granger’s eyes, and it made Harry nervous. He didn’t think Granger intended to hurt him, but he was still not entirely over the damage of his last affair. Sometimes the wounds still felt fresh. He didn’t want to experience that pain again, and he didn’t want to put the duke through anything similar, even if the duke had all the protections of wealth and status.
They jumped to their feet at the same time, their glasses of wine tipping over. Draco yelled
Harry buried a hand into his hair, tugging. “Fuck me, damn you,” he growled.
When Ronaldo was in the toilet and Harry was in his bedroom, Draco transformed back into a human and carefully stepped over the doggie gate. He crept down the hall to Potter’s office. He dropped into Potter’s chair and Spelled everything into position.
“Go,” Draco growled.
“I’m telling you he was just right here! He was in the bathroom!”
Weasley flapped his hand. “Your expenses would be paid for.”
Draco arched an eyebrow at him.
“More good news.” Harry laughed softly.
“Don’t concern yourself with it.”
Sighing, Harry closed his eyes and let himself just enjoy the moment. He felt so warm and safe, and he hoped Malfoy felt the same way.
Harry tilted his head to the side, studying him. His gaze held no malice, no shock. He stepped closer and carded his fingers through Draco’s white blond hair. “Such a good boy,” he cooed.
,” Draco said, and leaned down to kiss his lips. He remembered Goyle and made himself kiss Harry’s forehead instead. “All of that is done with now. There’s no use worrying about it.”
The duke swerved toward the voice. “Ah, Watkins. Just in time. I’ve returned with Mr Potter.”
!” Draco said. “Don’t let him hear you.”
Harry’s eyes lingered on Goyle until he realised he was staring. The fever had stolen much of his thoughts. “He is very big.”
“Bed. Now.”
“I refuse to be disagreeable on Christmas. Tell me what you want from me, and I will give it to you.”
“Touch me,” Draco said, and guided Harry’s hand to his cock. Harry tugged him sporadically, teeth gritted. He was too close to his own orgasm to have much rhythm. It made Draco laugh.
Potter reached out to steady himself against his desk. A hot flush spread down his throat. “Yeah,” he said, voice still faint. “That was the idea.”
“Yes, Your Grace,” answered the director. His face was flushed in fear. “We were merely following protocol. The young man is accused of assaulting an officer.”
His heart pounded. He felt stupid but he remembered Trelawney’s warning. He didn’t want to believe it. Not because the idea of Theo wanting him dead was too much to handle but because he didn’t want to imagine Harry roaming the earth as a ghost. Harry didn’t deserve that. He deserved peace. He definitely didn’t deserve an eternity where he watched Draco make shit decisions, push people away, cry for him night after night.
Draco helped set the table because he knew Potter would like it. He paused. “Is this where … the Order met? Right at this table?”
, and I am grateful.”
There was an awkward pause. The duke’s expression turned strained. “I believe I will do just that,” he said stiffly. “Please excuse my absence for the rest of the evening.”
A terrible silence fell between them. Finally, Malfoy said, “I won’t come back if that’s what you want. I can find a room in Knockturn. I will be all right.”
Now Harry was crying, too. He kissed Draco again. “I love you. I love both of you.”
After a few minutes, Draco pulled himself back up on the boat. His pale skin was pink all over from the sun, and his cock was already hard. He wanted to bugger Harry.
“You are broader than I expected, so it’s good that I’m measuring you now,” Granger said. “This will also help Miss Weasley and I pick out your outfit for the party.”
“Don’t mind him,” Draco said. “He follows me virtually everywhere I go.”
They rode for nearly an hour, crossing all of Draco’s snow-licked fields. His tenants were out, working the land. The ground wasn’t barren, even with a blanket of snow. There was still much to pull from the fertile dirt.
“Extinguish the candles then.”
“You are dressed up,” Harry said stupidly.
“Rest up, Mr Potter,” called Lady Granger. “You will need your strength for tomorrow.”
“Give them back! That’s not fair!” she cried.
Harry frowned. He didn’t like hearing Malfoy joke about his mortality. “What about your pain level? Has the pain got worse?”
“Please continue, Your Grace,” Harry whispered.
Frowning, Potter took a long moment to answer. “I suppose I would need a Christmas tree.”
“Mm?” Harry tried to sit up and failed. His head felt like a swaying bowl of water. “I can’t—I’m too weak to get out of bed.”
Harry lit some candles and helped Malfoy ease onto the bed. In the candlelight, Harry saw the extent of Malfoy’s injuries. His face was covered in blood.
“They are having a date night.”
“I believe it is. I tried to keep out of it.”
Potter rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah … I don’t know why. I guess I don’t feel alone here.”
Draco sucked in a breath. “And if I don’t win?”
“Have you had a Christmas tree before?”
Potter scrambled onto the horse. His movements were awkward, his breath coming fast against the back of Draco’s neck.
Draco never thought he would want to hug Professor Trelawney but he still reached out to her. She pulled him into an embrace, all her necklaces rough against his cheek. She smelled like lavender and mint.
“You saved me from Azkaban.”
Malfoy ate slowly, methodical. The sun made his hair honey-colour. He seemed a little shy, which was weird since it was Malfoy. Harry had thought Malfoy was incapable of being shy.
“I refuse to be
,” Draco growled.
“I need an assistant, you know.”
“You’re straight.”
“Tell me you love me,” Malfoy said, and he bared his teeth.
“He was tall and blond. He was fit.” Ginger Hagrid didn’t sound happy at all.
“You leave now and your health will deteriorate,” Granger said. “Mark my words.”
“Perhaps you should stop trying to solve my problems?” Malfoy said gently.
on his lips; but Theo was faster. His blinding white spell hit Draco in the stomach. Draco collapsed on the old carpet.
Harry lowered to a knee to help ease Malfoy out of his trousers; then together they eased down Malfoy’s underpants.
“It was your job.”
“Spread your legs for me, love.” Harry didn’t recognise his own voice.
Shuddering, Draco spilled over Harry’s working hand. He looked so beautiful when he came, so utterly taken. When his pleasure had died down, Harry buried his hands in the bedding, and fell into a rough, commanding fuck.
“Oh,” said Potter. He took a step back. “I don’t mean to interrupt. I was told breakfast was served down here.”
The secretary position was fine; it was easy. Draco liked gossiping with the other secretaries. He liked being where Harry used to be. Sometimes he passed by Harry’s old office just so he could imagine Harry behind the door. All Draco had to do was open that door and Harry would be sitting there, waiting for him.
Green carpeted nearly everything; only the stoney footpath remained untouched. Tropical palms reached out to pat Harry on the head, furry vines draped from trees, snake-like, curled and hooked.
“Christ - I didn’t
The group of suffragists stood in Parliament Square, huddling together like frightened prey. A chilly fog whipped around them, tugging at skirts and coats. Harry’s own threadbare coat was desperately inadequate to keep out the cold.
“Stay with me for Christmas,” Malfoy whispered, and his lips felt like a ghost against Harry’s skin. Harry hadn’t a clue if his lips actually touched his neck. “Please.”
The first photograph was from when he and Harry first started dating, their young, boyish faces pressed together. Draco remembered taking that photo, how Harry’s glasses dug into the slide of his face, how his cheeks hurt from smiling so hard.
“What?”
Draco smiled. “Follow me into the kitchen.”
The duke’s grey gaze pierced him. For a half a second, his gaze turned dark, possessive, but then he turned away and chuckled at one of his companion’s jokes.
“My baby and I don’t need to stay here,” Malfoy (Draco) had said quietly.
“Hello, Lady Granger,” he said politely.
“You are gorgeous.” Malfoy smoothed his warm hands down Harry’s back, then went lower to fondle his cheeks. He spread Harry to reveal his arsehole. Harry’s eyes fluttered closed. Being this vulnerable with another man was so erotic, but also frightening.
“Do you have contacts who are familiar with these places?”
“Erm.”
“Oh, I don’t know. My memory isn’t so good, you know.”
“That was a close one,” Potter whispered, caressing his cheek.
“Malfoy.” Potter pressed closer, his stiffy brushing Draco’s thigh.
,” Draco said.
“I think I need to move,” Draco said suddenly.
“You will regret it.”
Miss Brown perked up. “Our ultimate goal is to amend the Married Women’s Property Act so women can keep their possessions after they marry. Also, it’s a stepping stone to the vote for women. Only people who own property can vote, so in theory women should be able to vote if they also own property.”
, his mind supplied.
It was Goyle, his valet. “Mr Potter is awake and fed, Your Grace.”
Potter stood from his desk. “Please don’t go.”
“Yes.”
“People aren’t made in black and white. The duke lives in the grey. We all do. Look at me, for instance. My title states I’m the epitome of the aristocracy, but I don’t live my life like that. Some of us don’t, you know. Some of us can do good. I think
“You all must be weary from your journey,” Lady Parkinson said. “Shall we have a cup of tea so you can settle in?”
“All right?” Draco said.
Lady Granger sighed. “Yes, you’re right. One of you will need to reach out to Lady Parkinson. It cannot be me.”
Potter jerked up to watch him wank. His eyes were dark, enormous. Draco quickened his fist in excitement, his toes curling against the bed.
Under the table, Ginny nudged Harry. He tried to covertly pay closer attention to Granger and Parkinson.
Malfoy dropped to a knee. He took out a gold masculine ring. “Marry me, Harry. Please.”
“Oh, bother.” He rubbed his forehead. She was looking at him expectantly, so he forced himself to laugh. “I sort of grew up in a barn … it’s kind of complicated.”
to him.
“Yeah, you were.” Potter took a deep breath, then another. His hand fell to his lap, and Draco wondered if he was readjusting himself. “You wanted to be the heir to the evil man and his gigantic snake.”
“I was hit everywhere.”
The man ran from the room.
Harry blinked. “Won’t the servants gossip?”
“They will need an education,” Harry said, attempting a new angle. “I could come back after Oxford, be their teacher. Maybe the boys will grow up to be barristers or clergymen; with an education, the opportunities would be endless for them.”
“Your Grace …” Harry’s voice was a warning, a plea. He could barely breathe.
“I see.” Interest sparked in Weasley’s eyes.
“I don’t have any money!” Harry yelled suddenly. “I’m
Harry nodded.
“No way. It hasn’t been nine months yet!”
“Recently everyone I met didn’t care if I lived or died. Now a duke is comforting me.”
“I’m so cold,” Harry whispered, trembling. “I don’t think I will ever feel warm again.”
Harry was dozing with his head hanging between his knees when the cell door clanked open.
“I couldn’t let you do such a thing for me, Your Grace!”
Harry’s mouth dropped open. “No! I just …” He trailed off, not sure how he wanted to end the sentence. He wanted to run away. He wanted to hide among his books, bury himself beneath his academics. He didn’t want to fall in love, and he definitely didn’t want to fall in love with a duke.
Draco hadn’t a clue who made the first move, but suddenly they were kissing desperately. Draco put all his anger and pain, all his frustration, into the kiss. Potter made a hungry, needy noise, and yanked at his jacket.
“I’ll just bring you the house wine.”
“I don’t - I want -”
Harry rushed from the room.
“Of course,” Draco whispered, writhing. “I only want you.”
. He saw him underneath them, clinging to them.
“I already told you why.”
Malfoy stared at him with wide eyes. He licked his lips. “You want it?”
The question was so abrupt that it made Draco blink. “What do you mean?”
Malfoy looked at him for a brief moment. He turned his face away as if to hide. Harry gently grasped his jaw.
Sighing, Draco shouldered out of his coat and gave it to her. He would part with everything he wore if it meant finding Harry.
Potter leaned down and licked the wet from Draco’s cockhead; Draco stiffened and came all over himself. He felt Potter’s gaze on him, watching him come, and he tried to turn away.
A few minutes later Rose arrived to fetch Harry. “Right this way, sir,” she said.
“Don’t,” Harry croaked.
Draco thrust against Harry’s arse, slowly, so slowly. He parted his cheeks to rub his shaft along his hole.
Goyle rushed to move a chair close to the bed. Draco sat down, fiddling with his jacket. He smoothed his hand down his front.
“You are looking better,” Lady Granger said, nodding approvingly.
, Draco thought, arching up to meet his thrusts. Perhaps Draco had always loved him.
Another bite of the lip. “I’m a conflicted man, Malfoy. I really am. On one hand, I want you to support our cause. You have so much power, and your support would do wonders for us, but I can’t bring myself to watch you ruin your reputation just because you want to make nice with me.”
Licking his cheek, keeping his hand still pressed to his mouth, Harry fucked him slowly, then picked up speed. It took no time at all for him to be pounding into Draco, taking his pleasure, using his hole.
,” Potter said softly.
“For me?”
“Fine,” Draco growled, and dragged him into a dimly lit antechamber. He slammed the door shut and turned to Potter. “Tell me: Who is he?”
“We’ve got a pestle and mortar in the wardrobe,” Mrs Gibbs said, her colour looking better due to good cheer.
“You could have died!” Hermione said.
Harry smoothed his hands over his warm chest. He felt Malfoy’s heart beating fast against his fingertips. He leaned up and took one of Malfoy’s nipples into his mouth, sucking. Malfoy hissed.
“You need to go to hospital. You have a brain injury.”
“I’m not a slag,” he said to his shoes.
“Yes,” he said, cheeks going pink. Pansy was one of the few who knew about his sexual preferences. It still embarrassed him when she mentioned it, especially in the
“Then
“Passion is fleeting.”
Draco tried to hide his frown. It was never a good sign when Potter used his formal address. “Come with me on an adventure,” Draco said, crossing the room and closing the space between them.
Draco barked and bumped his thigh with his nose.
They had moved on from the garden, and were now focused on fixing up an upstairs room to be a nursery.
Harry hesitated but then began to undo Malfoy’s trousers. “Is this all right?” he asked softly.
“Right now. On your feet.”
“Not these men, Mr Potter,” Lady Granger said. “They will eat you alive if you are not careful. The Society took a chance and offered the scholarship to you—a man. Perhaps you will have more success than us.”
Harry jumped up from his desk, his feet icy even though they were still in his shoes.
Nearly an hour passed before Draco thought to take action. By that time the man was asleep on the desk and Draco was uncomfortably warm and his cock was throbbing.
“I have other priorities.”
“Yes!” Potter said, then added quickly, “You may do anything you want, Your Grace. I am merely a visitor.”
“You’re so tight for me, Harry,” he said. “I can barely take it.”
Potter deserved to never feel a sliver of discomfort again.
“Of course, ma’am, but even my managers need help sometimes.”
Harry’s stomach fluttered. God, he wanted the duke inside him.
Potter shuddered, then licked his gorgeous lips. “Then everything went dark when Dudley walked in on us in the barn.”
Draco leaned close again, lowered his voice. “And if I didn’t? Would you make me shut up?”
“Yes, but he has a habit of calling her ‘His Pansy.’ Does that imply a romantic relationship?”
Draco heard a terrible screeching in his ears—like a locomotive a second away from crashing. “You have formed many assumptions about me.”
When he arrived in town, he wasted no time finding work. From dawn to dusk, he mucked horse stalls in St Giles. After months of being an academic, he wasn’t used to such strenuous labour. He felt his body start to give out. He only managed to send Dudley a couple days’ pay before he was too weak to get up and go to work. He lost his job and his shelter, and then he found himself living on the streets.
“Are you hungry, sir? Would you like a bath?”
Harry followed the servant to the stairs. He glanced over his shoulder, wanting to catch Malfoy’s eyes, but Malfoy was already turned away.
The figure turned. It was Trelawney. Draco let out a sigh of relief.
Draco moaned loudly as his cock twitched. He stuffed a hand in his mouth to muffle himself. He was on the cusp of orgasm, his bollocks tight with it.
When their performance ended, Harry was left stunned, blinking owlishly. His reality came rushing back to him.
Draco blinked at him; then he barked a laugh. “
“I’m allowed to do anything I please.”
“Obviously not.” Then: “What happened between Lady Parkinson and Lady Granger?”
“Wait!” cried the young rider. “The Duke of Malfoy ordered me to come fetch you. I must return with you.”
“How could you!” Harry yelled but he doubted Draco heard him. Draco put on his hat and left the chamber.
“Why?” Harry asked gently.
“What is your favourite thing to cook?”
Draco struggled to calm himself. He took several wet breaths. He looked at her with swollen eyes. “What is it?”
Draco had arrived home and burst into tears. Harry had set down his tea to take Draco into his arms.
“Um, Your Grace?”
“What?” He stepped closer. “What do you mean? Tell me.”
Draco fucked him hard, rocking the chair. Harry tipped his head back and moaned loudly. No one was around to hear. They were free to love as openly as they wished.
Chuckling, Draco moved away for a moment to grab lubrication from his drawer. When he returned, he found Harry preparing himself with his own fingers. Draco stopped to watch him penetrate himself.
“Pardon?”
Potter stared at him. “What?”
“Good day, Lady Parkinson,” Harry said. “Does that mean we might be snowed in?” He was thinking about all the work that needed to be done in Oxford.
But now he had a stiffy and it wasn’t going away. Gritting his teeth, he reached down to stroke himself a few times. Fuck, that felt good. Thinking about Malfoy and touching his cock felt so, so good. It felt right.
“This is all Harry’s doing,” Trelawney explained in a quiet voice. “He told me to watch the building and be ready to alert the Aurors if Theodore showed up here. They had already been investigating him for what happened to Harry. I’m glad they came as quickly as they did.”
When Harry arrived home, he realised he had a visitor. He opened the door to this room and came to a halt. His stomach dropped. His cousin Dudley sat in his only chair.
Harry opened his eyes. He looked angry now, his tears making his green irises look almost supernatural. “Do you care about any of those people or do I only matter because you want to fuck me?”
Draco just barely hid his grimace. “What do you have in mind, ma’am?”
Harry was too overcome to answer. Malfoy released him, and Harry slumped back.
“Oh, no, Your Grace! This is a perfect Christmas present for your tenants.”
Harry decided to take a shower just to give himself something to do. In the hallway bathroom, he spelled on the serpent-head faucet and undressed. Then he stepped into the bathtub. The hot spray relieved some of the tension in his shoulders.
Then, right after intermission, Potter rose from his chair and slipped out to the corridor.
“You weren’t even hard. I know I’m not the most attractive bloke, but I’m still desirable.”
“Oh,” Draco sighed. He reached down to stroke himself.
“A bloke worked in these stables for a few days. I paid attention to him because he was too clean and tidy, if you know what I mean.”
“I suppose all you can do is pick up the pieces and move on,” Goyle answered gently.
“But then he said he needed to think about it. I never got my answer.”
Malfoy worked his mouth, his eyes looking everywhere except Harry. “I’m not a slag, Potter.”
Once Draco had relayed this information, he returned to Gibbs and Potter, and found them in the middle of easy chatter.
The groom gave Harry a curious look as he led the horse away. Harry pretended not to notice as he made sure nothing had fallen out of his bag during the journey.
you! Loads of them! If anything happened, you could always get married … or maybe not? Maybe … dear God! Maybe the Queen will hear about what you’ve been doing with me and she will …”
,” he whispered hoarsely. He made his eyes go wide in terror.
Harry's mouth trembled. “No,” he said softly. “It’s the truth. I do not love you, nor could I ever love you.”
“Tell me.”
“Why not?”
“Tell me,” Harry whispered.
Harry reached down, intending to urge the duke back to his feet, but his hands had other ideas and ended up buried in the duke’s soft locks.
“It’s unthinkable!”
Goyle took out a wad of pounds and shoved it into her hands. “Take your money and get out of our sight.”
“Yes.”
Forcing himself to ignore his panic, Harry poured himself a cup of tea, sat down to eat his porridge. He couldn’t stop his ears from listening for footsteps.
He would buy Potter a proper coat. Silk-lined. Green to match his eyes.
“It’s always been you, Draco,” Theo said. “We were supposed to be together. I know that sounds silly, deranged. But I always knew we were meant to be together. Especially after we both served time in Azkaban. Very few people know how that feels. Very few people survive that ordeal. But we survived. We survived because we were meant to be together.”
Harry turned his head against the pillow. He was exhausted, achy; but he still wanted to look at Malfoy. “There’s no need for anyone to rush here on my account. I’ll be all right.”
Draco laughed and threw his arms around Harry. Harry always had a way to make him feel better.
“With all due respect, sir, I can’t move while you still hold my arm.”
Harry fought to keep his expression bland. He was in uncharted territory with his cousin Dudley, and it would be a disaster if he blew his chances now.
“Good evening, miss,” he said when he saw it was a woman.
“Yes, it’s me. I’ve got you.”
For a moment, Harry didn’t understand. Then his gaze fell on Malfoy.
“I need to use the loo first.”
“The castle has chasteberries. It has all those herbs,” Draco said.
“Yes,” Draco whispered. He was shaking.
“Because I made an agreement with the Queen, that’s why.”
“Is there a problem, Harry?” Weasley asked from his grand cluttered desk. He was an attractive man, quite bookish, quite stuffy. Still Harry found himself admiring his bright blue eyes, his slight frame.
Draco rushed to the man. He accidentally tripped over someone’s leg and nearly fell.
That didn’t sound half bad, he admitted privately. “I want passion; I want a companion. I don’t want a snivelling child who can’t even look at me.”
“Thank God.”
“Sorry?”
Draco was horrified. “We are not talking politics on
Parkinson was smiling. “You look quite nice, Granger. I’m almost shocked.”
Draco swerved around. “What do you
Theo went inside the castle. Draco stared down at the parchment, not really seeing the writing.
“My business is none of your concern.”
Tears still glittered in his eyes. Parkinson smirked at him. “I knew you were a big softie,” she said to him. He shrugged.
“Then find another aristocratic woman. But you cannot be with me.” Harry moved toward the door, but Draco blocked him. Draco reached out, wanting to pull him into an embrace, but Harry stopped him.
“I’m not.”
“Nope,” Malfoy said. “I just turn really, really red.”
“The duke didn’t say a word to me about it.”
“What?”
“You must not trust Theodore Nott. You must ward your flat against him and avoid him at all costs. If he tries to approach you in public, you must be ready to defend yourself.”
“Let’s go to bed,” Potter murmured, dropping kisses down Ronaldo’s neck.
“I’m lost without him.”
“Yes, Lady Granger.” He closed his eyes for a moment.
Harry took a deep breath. He raised his wand, then swished it back and forth along the entirety of Malfoy’s body. He muttered
Draco smiled widely. He rubbed his hands together. “Well, it’s not much of an adventure, but it’s a bit of a journey. I want to finally show you my lands.”
“All right.” Draco stood and smoothed down his jacket again. He knew he’d sabotaged himself; but he refused to lie to Potter. “May I see you again soon? Perhaps read to you?”
“Sorry?”
“Does this feel good?” Malfoy repeated, his voice low and sensual.
Frowning, Draco knew what Theo was really asking. “I’m not sure.”
He stared, unmoving, until the tea went cold.
“I’m not a thief. I’m not a murderer.”
“I wouldn’t know,” Harry answered coldly. “I’ve only just got there.”
As they stood close gazing at the flower, Malfoy brushed his hand against Harry’s. He said in a soft, hot voice, “
“Yes, Your Grace! We’ve tried to have Everton come out to take a look at her, but he won’t budge for nothing under a pound, and we don’t have … well, let’s just say his asking is a tad high for us.”
“Do I?” Draco said dryly.
Draco still had to go to work because he still had pride. The DMLE had taken pity on him and had hired him on as a secretary. Robards had even asked him what he wanted to do with his life.
Malfoy looked sadly at the bottle of wine. “I love wine. I wish I could have a glass.”
“Perhaps,” Parkinson said. Harry groaned internally. He needed to write to Professor Weasley and warn him about the potential delay.
“Yes, Potter, say my name again. I ache to hear it on your lips.” He opened his mouth to Potter’s neck. He moaned when he tasted his skin.
“I was stationed in the Mediterranean briefly when I was in the military,” the duke said.
Harry sat back in his chair. He forced himself to relax. When he was sure his voice wouldn’t tremble, he said casually, “I will think of something, don’t you worry. Right now, though, I think it’s time for me to go inside. I’ve got loads of things to do today.”
“Perhaps wait tables at your wedding.”
“I thought the duke wrote to my brother and Percy agreed to give you some time off?” Ginny was frowning.
. The Duke of Malfoy was attracted to men.
Draco smirked. “I have all the proof I need, Dursley.”
“Yes, my love. Yes.”
“I’m not joking.”
“Arrest him!” cried the officer.
“Yes, Your Ladyship. I consider myself a male suffragist.”
“I know.” Harry looked away, fresh tears escaping his eyes. “I’m in love with you, too.”
Confused, Ronaldo wandered toward the office. Draco quickly slinked back to the office chair.
Potter sucked in a breath.
They wrestled against the wall for a moment until Goyle yanked both the coat and hat from her.
“It would be best if you stayed out here again,” Goyle said.
Potter packed up his things and they went off to the stables. Watkins greeted Draco eagerly.
With no coat, no money, Harry sneaked onto a train headed for London. He said goodbye to his future.
Malfoy cocked his head. “Do you think there’s a misunderstanding?”
Weasley blinked at him. “Are you the reason he left?”
Potter stopped as well. He smoothed his hands over the scarred wood. “Yeah.”
Draco opened his mouth.
They lay on the small bed together. Harry turned his head to capture Draco’s lips in a kiss. “Will you let me fuck you?”
Harry finally released him. He turned away. “We - uh - broke up.”
“You would be surprised by how much aristocratic men can get away with,” Granger drawled.
The townhouse wasn’t too big, and there were only a handful of rooms on the second level. Harry picked out the room at the end of the hall, the door more decorated than the rest, and decided that it must have been the duke’s bedroom.
“Smells brilliant,” Harry said, muffling a yawn. He padded over to the table to pour himself a cup of tea, adding lots of milk and sugar. He was a little stiff from sleep, so he grabbed a chair and twisted his back, then raised his arms up, stretching toward the ceiling. His sleeping shirt rose, revealing his stomach. He sensed Malfoy staring at him, and he glanced his way. Malfoy’s gaze was glued to his revealed stomach. “You’re burning the bacon,” Harry said, dropping his arms.
“Of course, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t presented us a terrific opportunity to attempt to convince him. You
Thirty minutes later, a couple of servants hauled a fresh pine tree into the library.
“I see.” Harry sounded cold even to his own ears.
Harry blinked at him. “What?”
Potter just looked at him, still holding his hands. Then, very carefully, he cupped Draco’s face. His thumb almost touched the corner of Draco’s mouth.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, coming up for air. He dragged his mouth up along his shaft, kissing and licking. He swirled his tongue around the head, sucking him like a lolly.
Potter felt the back of his neck heat up. Parkinson’s full attention was on him.
Draco shuddered. He held his face. He couldn’t stop the sob that tore through him. “Stop,” he moaned.
Draco clicked his tongue. “Come now, be a big boy and use your words.”
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, steadying himself. Just hearing the man’s voice made his body tighten.
“Yes.”
“I’m sorry, sir. I just have another engagement starting right now but I’m not quite done with the task you gave me.”
Harry hastily grabbed his books and writing items, and followed her from the room. They walked down several corridors before coming to magnificent double doors. With a touch of drama, she threw open the doors.
“All right,” Potter said, uncertain.
“You are allowed to be alone?”
Draco had been perched in his enormous wingback chair by the fire when a servant had led the man into the library. Draco had recognised him immediately as the sinful male suffragist. His whole body had throbbed just seeing him again.
“Yes.”
This obsession … it should’ve made him weary. It should’ve put him on guard. Obviously, he couldn’t let Potter get too close;
Potter buried his face against his chest. “I can’t lose myself again. I
Harry wanted to respond, but they both knew the answer. Dudley would probably swindle him for the rest of his life. Secrets always cost something.
“This is my friend, Mr Harry Potter. Treat him with the utmost respect. Please set him up in the guest room.”
The library doors opened and Parkinson and Granger strolled inside. They were pink-faced and grinning at each other. Potter noticed the change between them.
Harry couldn’t figure out the duke. He seemed so caring, so invested … but he was still the man who had ordered Harry off his property. He was still so uninterested in the experience of women that he found the idea of giving them the vote preposterous. He was still a man with many, many privileges.
Harry suddenly felt very, very tired. “I don’t know anything about pregnancy, especially not male pregnancy.”
During all this, Draco continued to take clients. He was showing now, which at first he thought would hurt business, but he soon found out that loads of men liked shagging a pregnant bloke.
Malfoy apologised, but Harry told him the apologies were unnecessary because he understood. He understood everything, and anyway, he liked taking care of Malfoy. Malfoy deserved it.
“Impressive,” Potter said.
“Do you remember your first date with him? You wanted to order an expensive wine, but the waiter said, ‘Sir, this is a Spools.’” She paused, listening again. “The waiter said ‘Spoons’? That doesn’t make any sense. Was he asking for cutlery?”
“Right.” Potter didn’t sound pleased.
Draco grimaced. What a terrible description.
“It’s not my concern if you don’t understand, Your Grace. Please, leave my premises at once.”
Harry laughed softly. He ran his fingers through Draco’s fine hair. “I didn’t want to ruin anything, or do anything to jeopardise your safety.”
Then, one day, Weasley asked him out on a date. Of course he didn’t call it a date, but Harry understood by the way his cheeks went pink. Weasley fumbled with his glasses, trying to sound casual.
“Um -”
“Then please
Harry worried his bottom lip, mind turning. “Yes,” he said finally. “Even if he had no desire to marry … surely social expectation would’ve forced his hand by now?”
Draco wished he heard a scream, a shout. He wished he heard Theo’s body hit the pavement below; but the London evening swallowed up the noise.
“Oh my god … do you need to go to hospital?”
“I can’t decide whether or not I want to kill you or keep you for myself,” Theo whispered. His eyes were dark again, so dark; there was an excited flush to his cheeks.
“Do you not want it?” Harry said. Malfoy wouldn’t look at him, so he rested a finger under his chin and urged him to look up.
“Cousin, please be reasonable,” Harry said calmly. “Think about what it would mean to have an Oxford graduate in the family. I could make boatloads of money and send a fair portion back to you.”
he could be.
“What will I do?” Draco said.
Then they chucked him into the back of a wagon.
Harry felt his face go pink. He was suddenly stammering. “Well - I dunno. Something really awful, mind. Something really really awful.”
The duke smiled dryly. “What exactly do you intend to accomplish with this stunt?”
“No, Your Grace.”
“No!” Harry stumbled over his words. “I - get it. I do.”
Harry opened the door to his letted room. “Oh,” he said when he saw it was Malfoy.
“Yeah … it’s my terrible upbringing, you know. I was never taught the proper words for things.”
“Do you want to see mine?”
Malfoy snorted again. He tried to turn away but Harry stood and grabbed him.
his guests.”
“Sir!”
They spent loads of time together but they didn’t do much talking. Harry was okay with it. He liked Malfoy’s company; he liked just
“Oh, well, I have a
“I’ve heard about you.”
“I would pay for you.”
“Yes, Your Grace.”
, Draco thought as their carriage arrived at the Hall.
“Are you going to come for me, my love?” Harry said.
Harry blinked at him in surprise. “Grimmauld Place, you mean?”
“No.”
Draco shrugged. “But I didn’t. It all worked out in the end.”
“I hadn’t even a sip of liquor. Has your family worked here for a long time?”
“Good evening, Mr Goyle,” Harry said politely.
. “Yes, all right.”
“Oh, this is serious,” Draco said playfully.
“Some of it happened when I was at work, but after I lost my job, there was a man who wanted my shoes … it was quite the scuffle.”
“It’s been a wild night, hasn’t it?” Harry said in his baby voice.
?” he cried.
Potter looked at him, then cut his eyes away. He poked at the last few remaining noodles on his plate. “I can’t stop thinking about you,” he said to those noodles.
“Fuck.”
“I do believe he expects you to stay until Christmas,” Granger said.
“Strange place to put something that’s available to everyone: a locked room inside a castle.” Potter’s voice was still breezy, his mouth still curled in a grin.
“I see.” Draco unfolded his serviette to give his hands something to do.
“However,” Granger continued. “You still represent the cause—
“Why?”
He stepped back into the Great Hall, and made eye contact with Lord Webbington. The man raised his eyebrows at Harry. Harry flinched; he couldn’t help it. He had no idea if Webbington knew what had just happened between Harry and the duke on the balcony, but it felt like he knew. Harry only saw hostility in the man’s gaze.
Malfoy sat up suddenly; he muffled a wince and a groan. “It doesn't matter. I’m leaving now.”
Gaping, Harry staggered inside. He nearly dropped everything in his arms. The library was breathtaking, immense. He’d never seen so many books in his life.
The first time it happened, Potter brought home a handsome man named Ronaldo. Draco jumped up from his bed, sniffing around. Ronaldo flapped his hands at Draco and called him a
“That doesn’t surprise me at all. I’ve made a bit of a splash at Malfoy Castle.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Are you saying I smell?”
He was the canteen’s busboy and unofficial waiter. The job was fine - a hell of a lot better than rotting in Azkaban - but it put him in direct contact with Harry Potter.
“Of course, you may do whatever you please.”
“Good boy!” Potter said.
Harry gaped at him. “Don’t you understand what this means? Your reputation is ruined. Your political esteem is destroyed. You—you—”
Draco sucked in a breath. “Yes. I’ve been dying for it.”
“No, I’m trying to find him.”
Later that night, after washing up the remains of supper and playing a few matches of chess, Malfoy joined Harry on the sofa in front of the fireplace.
Then Draco saddled up, and they took off.
“I’m not a heartless monster.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow; Harry had to suppress a shiver. “You want to ask me something. Go ahead.”
Nodding to the other men, Draco jumped back on his steed and took off for the castle. He made sure to look for any hidden holes in the snow.
For some stupid reason, tears burned Draco’s eyes. “No.”
Malfoy’s hands clamped down on his hips possessively. Looking into his face, Malfoy thrust up, fucking him hard. Harry cried out.
?” Draco said.
feel lost. He’d lacked direction since the end of the war. He didn’t want to become an Auror; he didn’t want to be a professor. He wanted to live in Grimmauld Place, with a family. He wanted to be domestic and sheltered and
Cupping his head, he tried to chase away all his fears and doubts. No matter what, he wouldn’t let Draco die.
“Fang is
“Yes.”
The audience stood up to clap politely for the performers, and it took Harry a moment to realise he was the only one still in his seat. He jumped up and began clapping enthusiastically.
It was Draco Malfoy.
“Leave us be!” Harry snarled back.
? Are you serious?”
“I understand.” Theo took Draco’s hand and guided him to the sofa. The lounge was small and tidy, and had a big window that peered over a busy London street.
“God.”
Ignoring his anticipation, Draco strode confidently back to Potter, then led his horse to where he could also tie it to the tree. Then, looking up expectantly at Potter, he gave him his arms.
Potter stared into his eyes, needing him. “He was the second son of a viscount.”
“Just use a cleaning spell,” Malfoy muttered.
“He wants to come in
“No, it wasn’t. It was meant to be routine, easy. I didn’t expect the thief’s house to contain hundreds of
, the Duke of Malfoy had said. The duke had begged him.
“Drink it,” she said softly. “It will make you feel better.”
Potter shoved some things into his work bag and draped a terrible scarf around his neck. He gave Draco a hesitant smile.
“I already know about the certificate,” Draco had said.
Before he understood what was happening, he was in a physical altercation with the policeman, both of them throwing punches.
Draco handed over the small vials. Potter looked them over, frowning a touch.
“Tickles,” Potter said.
“This chicken is quite good,” Harry said loudly.
“More?”
“I don’t think you have any serious internal injuries - besides the broken ribs,” Harry said. “But there is a light pink showing up around your face. I reckon it’s about your nose but I want to make sure.” Harry Summoned his notes from his room.
“That doesn’t matter. What matters is what’s in your heart. I know you love me, Harry. And I know I love you.”
“I love it, Draco.”
“Of course not. I doubt I’ll have much of a say.” He waved a morose arm. “Society will choose my bride for me.”
Draco smiled faintly. “It is, Goyle. I don’t know much about this world, but I do know
“No, don’t touch yourself. You will leave your pleasure for me.”
“To the London Metropolitan Police.”
Draco nearly stopped. “You’ve made yourself perfectly clear that you do not wish to be in my company. I will take my leave and let you make your own choices.”
“What is needed. You don’t want to go to St Mungo’s … see a proper healer. I want to do what I can for you.”
“I doubt your cousin knows you are surrounded by bluestockings.”
Robards shifted on his feet. “We both know who told me. Now, if you have an interest in Potions, you could get a certificate. It would take a bit of studying, more than a bit, really, but perhaps you’d be good at it.”
. There was another illustration demonstrating the wand strokes - two counter clockwise rotations, then an upside down V motion.
Harry sat down on the edge of his bed. He drummed with fear. “I’ve sent you your monthly two pounds.”
Forcing himself to be calm, Harry closed the door and ventured into his room. “What are you doing here?”
“Yes, but they don’t represent what’s in my heart.”
“Fine. Tell me: what do your tenants need, Malfoy?”
Draco needed to get away. “I will ride back to the castle, then promptly return.” He left before either of them responded.
“He could go to the press … your secrets could be splashed across a nasty rag for even the Queen to read.”
Harry stumbled, dropping a few of the leaflets. A strong hand caught his arm, steadying him. Harry looked up and met that cold, cold gaze. The man was definitely an aristocrat; he oozed inbred arrogance.
“Exactly. Do your duty as a duke. Host a big, merry party to bring in the new year. You’re running late with the invitations, but that’s perfectly all right. People will cancel all other commitments to be at the event of the year.”
“Wow,” Potter said. He grabbed for his wand and cast a cleaning spell.
Whimpering, Harry dropped his hand. His cock was stiff, so desperate. Malfoy continued to lick him from bollocks to hole, over and over. The stubble on Malfoy’s chin grazed against his inner cheeks. It was so intimate.
The duke frowned. “Your health … the journey can be hard on the lungs, the mind.”
When the pleasure ebbed away, Harry was left feeling boneless on the table. He nearly fell asleep.
“I need to see the extent of your injuries, Malfoy.”
Draco’s cock throbbed in his trousers. He ate his slice quickly, ravenously. Feeling naughty, he sucked some sugar off his thumb.
. The man raised one haughty eyebrow, and determination suddenly poured through Harry: He had to talk to this man. He hadn’t become an Oxford student to cower. He’d changed his whole life to make a difference, and that difference started now.
“Right,” Potter said grumpily. Then he sighed, sat up a bit straighter. “The only reason I came here is so I could speak to you about our cause.”
