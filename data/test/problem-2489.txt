“Being alive and living are two very different things, Professor.”
For some reason, Misty’s gaze unnerves Theo.
Harry tries to dislodge his arm. He really makes a few token attempts, but this woman has a grip of steel not even Hermione can save him from.
“You pantsed Longbottom? There’s poetry in that somewhere. Should’ve been wearing long-johns if you ask me. Certainly matches his name more.”
It’s a

okay.
“And you’re eighteen.” Theo says, like Draco needs reminding. “No offense to you, Madam, but Draco! You’re barely a young adult! You shouldn’t be acting like-” He spares a glance to Mrs. Daisy, quickly choosing a new set of words. “Like a burned out Ministry employee!”
He does roll his eyes at the sentiment, but just as his godfather said, one sip later and he can already feel his limbs becoming his again. Snape distracts him with a story of his mother in their younger years, and before he knows it the tea is all but gone.
Now that’s an insult if he’s ever heard one.

They both startle at his appearance, Lupin looks a little too ashamed for his liking.
He doesn’t follow, but Draco apparently does.
“Living and wandering around the earth all sad and empty isn’t the same thing Draco!”
The boy turns around with a big smile, Fawkes burrowing into his warmth. “Sorry, Headmaster, I did actually come here to see you, I just can’t believe I haven’t come and seen Fawkes since his rebirth.”
He’s trying to fall asleep to her rambling when she gasps loud enough to wake up Salem.
Two days before the term ends and Draco is ready to slit someone’s throat. Across the courtyard he can hear the Weasley twins pulling at Potter’s leg, so loudly anyone within a five mile radius could probably hear them.
It could just be a fluke.”
I was picked for this particular activity.”
“Safe.” Draco nods, placing a warm pale hand right over the ache in Harry’s chest. “It’s safe here, and because it’s safe you’re allowed to feel happy. You do know that, don’t you? If the son of a Death Eater is allowed to feel joy then so are you, Scarface.”
He takes what little food they have and their repaired shared water cup and brings it into the living room where he sets it all down. A wordless
“Listen here, you little shit. I did
to know how the hell Draco manages to make Snape look like a pacified cat every single lesson.
“Asleep? Almost. But then you opened that bloody mouth of yours. Do you normally talk to people when they’re sleeping?”
He’s lost enough family, he won’t lose anyone else. So Lucius Malfoy, former Death Eater, the man who hates Muggles and Mudbloods and even the fucking Weasleys goes running after his son, wishing once again for a damned wand so he can be useful to his child that clearly inherited his backbone from his mother.
“P-pans…” Draco manages, his voice strained. “You-thank you.”
“No you’re not.” Pansy rubs his shoulder.
“You there.” He says, turning directly towards Draco. “Are you alright? How

mood because his mum wouldn’t let him tailor his clothes and Pansy hadn’t been much happier because she wasn’t allowed to hex her annoying teachers. Narcissa picked him up at noon, promising to go home and have tea with Lucius, and Draco had nearly cried tears of joy.
“I was enjoying the sunset,” Draco says to hide the fact that he was debating forcing his boyfriend to talk to his temperamental snake.
Kreecher is a bit smaller than Winky, a little more scrawny and not nearly as cheeky in the face. He approaches respectfully, not like he’s scared though, which is a lot better than his first experience with an elf.
“No.” Pansy says at the same time Blaise spits “Over our dead bodies.”
“Merlin!” He chokes, “You two are gonna do just fine without me-oh! Draco,” he reaches into his desk and pulls out a small wrapped present, “I know it’s a little late, but your birthday was a few days ago, wasn’t it?”
Draco shrugs, “It’s Misty’s.”
Fuck. He didn’t mean for Pansy to hear them, but once one of them clues in they all do.   Narcissa turns around with a smile that Draco can read, but he doubts Harry can see the kindness under all that ice.
Any hope leaves him the second he makes his way down to the arena and a blonde woman nearly yanks his arm off.
teeth. Cleanly shaven beard, no glasses, no jewelry, but his shirt is tight enough for Draco to appreciate the muscles beneath, pants of equal nature. So tight Draco can just barely make out a slight bulge.
Well color him surprised and serve him up for dinner, “My mother...she doesn't know. Neither does father, of course, he’s gone a bit off the deep end.”
So far, Harry Potter is having a weird Christmas break. Ron and Hermione had drug him to see Hagrid on the second day, which had been a disaster that somehow resulted in them going to the library- a place he was hoping to avoid on break. It’s for a good cause though, and midway through his book a small white ball of fluff had hopped onto his lap and begun purring.
A lot of arguing went on from there, an elf having a wand? Isn’t that silly? Once an elf was in service to someone they simply said ‘no wands’ and the elf could not pick up a wand. They would burn their hands immediately, before the wand was fully in their grasp. Every pureblood wizard knew that, and someone like Crouch should too…
Then he leaves Harry standing in the middle of the hallway right as Ron catches up to him.
Harry’s jaw drops. Then he turns to Hermione with hopeful eyes.
“Harry, he’s nearly fifty thousand years old.”
And Draco did fill his friends in on what his younger self figured out.
Dumbledore is hugging him, and oddly enough, shaking while he does. Even weirder is that Harry Potter, The Boy Who’s Parents Got Brutally Murdered In Front of Him, is crying like he’d just seen the worst thing in his life.
From the foyer he can see straight into the living room, which looks
He tries to lie at first, Draco sees the cool expressionless stone make its way onto his father’s face. And then the idiot blurts out “Yes.” and Draco has the pleasure of seeing a flurry of emotions crack that mask he’s grown so used to.
Draco, holding a button: but it's shiny!
He probably shouldn’t have said anything, but Lupin just looks at him like he’s lost his mind. “What
“You know,” Blaise says, narrowing his eyes, “I’ve heard Hippogriff wounds are supposed to be jagged, funny that yours is a straight line. It almost looks like a knife wound.”
Three heads turn to look at him. A bit of bagel falls out of June’s mouth.
The anxiety. The need to
“I’ll help you on one condition.”
He doesn’t like what happens when he lashes out.
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkle looking at the two in front of him. Snape and Draco, both the picture of disgust and annoyance, mimicking one another with open sneers and their eyebrows furrowed in the exact same form. “Would it make you feel better if Severus were to be the other instructor?”
His father looks wounded, like the mere thought of defying the woman before him was worthy of death. “Of course not! I would never keep things from my dearest flower, but I do not know why I have harmed my little dragon. Much does not make sense, please forgive me if I have disappointed you.”
“So, since I’m already making two of the Champion’s outfits, word spread. And by lunch Cho Chang had asked me if I had any suggestions for her, so naturally I offered to hand select their outfits, because I’m wonderful and kind and the best seamstress
Snape nears despite Draco’s scowl.
Draco shrugs. He could work with that. Some of them were vague enough, if he was lucky he could get out of here without revealing more than he had to.
They stare for a long time as Draco recovers his breathing, and then his godfather helps him up and leads them to the room he was aiming for the first time. Snape brews tea in silence, seeming to note that the boy needs at least five minutes to collect himself before he can speak. Once the tea is poured and served, both plain because they both enjoy the taste of the leaves themselves, he raises one bushy black eyebrow.
Dumbledore doesn’t comment on his rudeness for once, merely waits for both boys to join him. Then he takes his wand and extracts the memories Draco has no recollection of and eases them into the water. The three of them join hands, take a gulp of air, and sink their heads into the unknown.
Remus is going to take him
He is also not supposed to be here, in Mrs. Daisy’s shop, letting his briefcase fall from his left hand while the right one covers his mouth.
There’s only two-

They could stand outside and argue about this all night long, but it’s also an hour past curfew and the three of them look more suspicious than they ever have. Before Blaise can agree and start dragging him away, Draco throws the door open and shoves his friends inside.
“No it wasn’t!” Hermione cries, Ron’s arms around her so she can’t come forward, or perhaps just to keep her from sobbing on the spot. “Mr. Malfoy and Draco saved our lives today! They helped us escaped those masked men and took us somewhere safe! We were in the forest and Mr. Malfoy told us to get behind him and then the spell was cast! Check his pockets if you must,
The smile falls away from Draco’s face at the wistful dream. If only it could be so easy to get Potter home. Whatever his father had planned hadn’t started yet, but some nagging feeling told him it wouldn’t take long. With that thought a sudden funk came over him. Completely and utterly unfair, something akin to sadness maybe? He can never spend too much time on it before Pansy notices.
“These people behind me are the champions, do you get it? Not me. They worked hard to
Draco actually laughs at that, “Harry will defeat the Dark Lord. It will be dangerous, sure, but he won’t die. I won’t let him die, not until he suffers the consequences for my headaches over the years. And since I have to be there until the very end, I can’t die either. You two have nothing to worry about from that aspect.”
He doesn’t speak again until five minutes after the antidote is taken, and even that is just to tell the headmaster that he hopes his day improves. Then he takes LuLu and all but runs out the door, only pausing to put on the easiest façade he can muster, arrogance a little too difficult and feeling too shaken up to go for spiteful, he settles on confidence and strides into the classroom a full ten minutes late.
“You are a strange boy, Harry Potter.”
“Honestly, I wish I knew. Though fireproof underwear does sound like a good investment.”
He could deny it, his chance is right here, he can make up some stupid excuse, it would be so easy to deny it. But Draco doesn’t say a word; he looks away. And that is an answer in itself.
“Trust me, you’d rather not know. Draco, you should go see Dumbledore for a few hours, then come back and we can talk.”
“Did you say yes?” Hermione asks, she’s been raging about how excited she is for
“The….the...I dunno, I think of one eventually-”
“Hey, so, I know what the first task is. We’re gonna be facing dragons and-”
Once, when he was younger, Draco overheard his grandfather call his mother the ‘Ice Queen’, and he hadn’t understood why. His mother is a breath of fresh air. Charming, delicate, warm and polite to almost everyone unless she has a reason not to be. She was always kind and loving to him, even the few times she had sent terror through his blood, she always ended with a hug. Sitting across from her and the other two pureblooded mothers put a new perspective on that nickname.
“Scared?” Draco mouths, if Potter is, they can put this whole thing behind them and Draco can count this as a new way to release the tension in his head. Of course, the dumbass has to mutter back “You wish”, meaning they are going to have to do this.
When they’re gone Ron takes a step forward. “Draco...is he really-”
She turns those big black eyes on him and Draco knows that whatever she’s about to say is going to rattle him to his very core.
“Why, Draco, you should know better than to speak of your professors, no matter how much of a
A feeling that intensifies when Theo starts throwing beauty products on him.

“That would explain why he keeps trying to get into Hogwarts.”
“Your selective listening is worse than mine, dear. Come along, I’ll explain your training over breakfast.”
percent sure!”
he pulls out his wand and casts a quick
And that is something Draco can agree with.
At the end of the day, and yes the day was as fucked as his sense of humor, Lucius is still his Dad. The idiot who once fell out of a tree trying to get Draco when he wanted an apple. The moron who almost burned down the kitchen the time he thought he forgot Narcissa’s birthday, only to realize it was the next day and take her off to a different country until the repairs were done. The stupid man who took Draco swimming during a snow storm despite Narcissa forbidding it.
They’ve only known each other for a week and she’s already good at guilt tripping him. Partly because Draco really doesn’t care one way or the other, but he does like making Misty smile, so he sighs in defeat, hiding a grin when Misty rushes up the broken stair case and returns with a dingy old coat that’s covered in soot but will at least manage to hide most of Draco’s frame.
The anomaly is
“We might as well, he should enjoy a treat before his rebirth, don’t you think?”
Draco doesn’t care, and his parents won’t either, but he does make a comment that there’s no way Hermione will finish
“Sorry, Weasley, I’d give you a part but you can’t even walk, can you?”
“I have to actually work today.” Theo says, disrupting his quiet time and plopping on the short side of the L-shaped couch. “You should come with me.”
What a difference a year can make.
His friends falter so he smiles, “Better than being dead though!”
All Draco can do is glare. He glares while Fawkes comes to see him, he glares the entire week leading up to the first session, and he most certainly glares at the idiots walking in. As if Lockheart isn’t enough, naturally Potter and crew would show. Thank Merlin Draco remembered both his potions this morning.
Dumbledore gives him a sad smile but changes the topic out of pity, “You’re rather high strung today, Lupin told me you had quite the amusing rambling about floating heads before your arrival here.”
It’s been a while since it was just the two of them, so Harry reaches out to pet her, opening the book from Lucius first.
----------
Winky looks up at him and he can’t stop himself from smiling kindly at her.
Draco sighs, casting one final look to the tables before shrugging and sinking down into the mounds of pillows that Harry carefully arranged. “I’m only agreeing to this because you nearly died a few days ago, but one day the novelty of that is going to wear off.”
“Theo,” Draco manages, “Yes, I am, I mean-what are you doing here?”
“I’d be delighted.” Narcissa puts down her tea like they’re merely catching up and not three seconds away from murdering their children. “You see, darlings, the issue with many binding bloodspells is in their names: blood. It’s a fickle thing, really. After all, we are the blood and flesh that created you, so by binding your blood, you’re really binding our- oh look! Draco has clued in! Can you tell us what this means, love?”
Which is exactly why Draco goes to see her on Sunday morning, well, that and because his little cousin is there and Luna demanded he go with her.
Riddle cursed her-”
“Come on, Draco,” Fuck, is he getting used to Potter using his name? “Think about it! You and ‘Mione are the two smartest people in the whole school! We have a better chance of saving Buckbeak together than we do separately, and you know it. Do you want to save him or not?”
“Not a fan of reporters, Harry?”
The professor lets him in and stares, and really, Draco gets it. His hair is a mess, eyes wide and probably a little crazed, robes all in disarray, and LuLu beside him eyeing him like he might just break down crying right here and now.
“It’s been fine, how about yours?”
friends. The idiots who’ve been with him since third year, badly joking about hexing him even though they snarl in the faces of people who insult him.
“Because I was told to.”
“So I spent all of my life, eating scraps, barely seeing the outside world, locked away in this little cupboard, constantly being told about how awful ‘my kind’ are and then one day a giant shows up and brings me to this place….this
Draco smiles at him, there’s snarling behind them but Sirius isn’t in his line of sight so hopefully he’s the reason they all haven’t turned into mince meat. “You need to get out of here.” He manages.
He would puke if he didn’t find the look of pure frustration on Potter’s face somewhat therapeutic. Granted, the face did come with the price of listening to the golden asshole speak, so it was as much of a loss as it was a win. Professor Sprout cut him off before Draco could reach the hexing point.
Draco turns on his heel, careful enough not to disrupt Fawkes who squakes anyways. “So it does exist then? What he told me is true, and the last time it was opened-”
The last thing Draco Malfoy expected to be doing on his train ride back home was dreading it and being stared at by Harry Potter, who had, for some unholy reason, decided to pick the cart across from his for the train ride home.
Fucking Gryffindors and their damned morals. Fucking Harry and his need to save the world. Fucking green eyes that he’s never been able to say ‘no’ to. They’re the whole reason he got into this mess, well, that and his own need to save the world.
They didn’t think Harry was intune with the house enough for the Black Manor’s magic to work, but it certainly had.
harry:
“In blood.”
Harry wishes she’d sent him upstairs. Upstairs is where his cot is. He doesn't get a real bed, but they did give him a room after the whole ‘wizards at our house’ ordeal. Yes, the room doubles as a storage room for things Dudley can’t decide if he likes or not, but it’s a room all the same.
to do something to shut Draco up, and it works pretty well considering the boy gapes like a fish. Seizing his opportunity, Potter continues.
“We have no one to tell-”
“What about Parvati? She’s nice.” Fred says.
“Wait-”
opened up first and I’ve been stuck with you ever since.”
literally this is mostly fluff and a bad attempt at humor,
Sirius laughs.
Also peep Narcissa literally going from 'Lucius! You're bleeding what the fuck!' to 'Lucius why in the fuck aren't you bleeding?'
“What’s the difference?”
Narcissa Malfoy brought life to the manor, and happiness into his soul. As soon as he hears the tell-tale crack of Apparition he’s running to her, bypassing the elves and smiling when she spots him.

Harry: this is it, i am finally going to become a murder
Pansy takes a deep breath, “We’re not stupid, love, we didn’t want to invade your privacy...but
“You know who I am as a person.”
The cuts and scrapes on the shivering boy isn’t what gets him. It’s the dead look in his eyes, like he can’t even see Harry, like he’s looking into the darkest pit of despair and can’t see a way out. And he’s still standing barefoot in the snow, LuLu frantically meowing at him.
Luckily his brain had stepped up and threw the letter under his pillow before he sent the rest of them off.
“This is being Mistress’s book! Misty is unsure of the page number, but it’s the one Mistress used to tie Misty to the sea!”
parents, and the next you’re standing by my hospital bed? You’re bloody mental! Make up your mind, do you want to ruin my life or save it?!”
“Your eye bags are gone. Did you finally get some sleep? Pans and I have been going mental, I swear! You’re just as bad as Harry!”
“You all have sworn a contract, correct?”
“Done.” Draco says. He already has his wand out, summoning a check.
Pettigrew doesn’t move, just sits in the filth with tears streaming down his face. He makes the mistake of looking at Harry with his full attention and Draco almost smirks when Sirius’s fist collides with rat-teeth.
She’s gonna be coming to Hogwarts!”
A shiver of terror rips down Draco’s spine. Personally, he never wants to see Granger angry again. His cheek hurts just thinking about it. Fortunately, he has more important things to think about.
“Are you suggesting there is something more important than loyalty? Or do I need to hex you before you leave?”
“All that I got was that you and Pansy are definitely gay for each other.”
Misty!”
And yes, the Slytherins are all good to go. Always prepared, always glamorous, always a show stopper. It’s the other idiots Draco’s suddenly worried about.
----------
“You have been looking for me?”
Draco looks around, did Snape get more decorations? There’s more potions, a lovely vase of lilies, a new chair? “Professor, when did you get this chair? I haven’t seen it here before.”
“I think that’s enough for the night, hm? I’m gonna take you upstairs so you can pick a room, Remus can you get dinner started with Kreecher. Oh shit! Kreecher!”
William looks physically pained to be doing this, but he sighs long and deep, and then Draco’s looking at Ellios and a mini male version of Ellios.
“What happened to your savings?” June asks.
“I will not spend more time with that fool, even if it is for the betterment of the students.”
“Hey.” Pansy starts softly, “It’ll be over soon.”
“No you don’t understand,” he tries again, aware enough to know they’re almost at the castle doors and far away that no one will hear him, “He’ll hear about this and try to-“
“He’s got you there, mate. I doubt Malfoy actually goes
There are still only two beds.
“Stop! Stop! Stop!” Lockheart calls out, making no effort to actually stop them. It’s Snape that mutters “Finate Incantatem” to cease the fight.
Her dark eyes pierce him, as though she’s trying to find some sort of clue. Harry waits patiently, enough though he’d really like to hurry this up, nothing good comes from rushing Narcissa.
“That’s confusing.” Ron crinkles his eyebrows. “If you do that, why do you call your mum Narcissa sometimes?”
“Of course I have. Now get over here and help me with the wrapping paper.”
Malfoy? Is his father here? Oh fuck. Are Potter and his father in the same house? Surely that’s why Dumbledore is here. That’s got to be the reason.
Cold rushes through Draco, he’s speaking before he can think, fire rushing through his veins, “Bloody hell has he been in connection with the Dark Lord this entire time? Owling him when he wants to be in tune with whatever scheme his cronies are pulling? By Merlin-”
Fred and George are laughing at him now, thank Godric Ginny finds Luna’s hair more interesting than this conversation.
“Sneaking out already? It’s only the first day back….unless you have other motives for coming here alone…..just the two of you…”
most of this chapter is through Harry, also Draco gets Roughed Up and the next chapter will go into Detail on it so please BE WARNED
“I didn’t. Your reaction just told me.”
“What’s going on with you? You’ve looked more and more vile leading up to the break. You’re not trying to scare off the beast are you?”
So of course he ended up saying ‘yes.’
“A tale of lies,” Pansy adds in, apparently over her and Blaise’s miniature war. Blaise is brushing off a bit of fruit tart, he has a bit of whipped cream on his nose.
They gulp. Good, that means he’s still got it.
She guides him through things Harry kinda already knows. Dragons are big, dangerous, and sometimes assholes. It’s best to get in and out as quick as possible, stay away from their tails and faces, don’t show weapons until the last second. Do not. Absolutely
They begin with a change of address for Hogwarts because it’s the quickest. Then they set an appointment with some dude named Leo on Friday for medical documents. Remus hands him a packet that reads
That’s a whole point for him and like...five hundred points to the universe.
Draco whirls on him, “But Professor! Think of how humiliating it would be for him? He doesn’t stand a chance against you! You could knock him on his bum faster than he can sign his own autograph!”
I’d like to be able to make them too, but Cho wants something traditional and I have no time left. I also offered to make Krum's, it’d be rude not to, and though he didn’t accept because he’s going traditional, I did find out his color scheme so I can make sure the two of you match, Hermione. Which reminds me,
Lockheart says something else, pulling back despite the panic in Potter’s eyes. “Alrighty then! One!”
“Merlin, no. I’m on watch duty until Harry can save you.”
And because he too is suffering the same as his elder, Draco merely nods in pity, steering them both to Dumbledore’s office. They take maybe three steps away from the dinning hall where people are beginning their meal right as Nevil Longbottom of all people rushes past them, straight to the mops of red hair.
“Yeah, Hermione tells me that too.”
Pansy huffs, but does pop a tart in her mouth, “You’re very kind, Sisily, but Draco needs more love and special treatment than Blaise and I.”
“And you come back looking like you’ve been stomped on?”
“Let me go!” Potter demands, trying to get free from the goblins that Draco had seen throughout the day. He moved in an odd way and suddenly his bag was ripping, contents spilling all over, including a familiar looking book.
“And slept.”
Willie, finding him crying: Yes you are
And when was the last time they spoke to you, hm? Let me guess-
“Yes!”
There’s the little black eyes right next to him too, and that startles him enough to jolt in his haze.
“Look, I get that you two-” He points to Howie and June. “-are clearly Hufflepuffs, and
need to listen to!”
Remus growls a bit when Harry opens the door, and he gets it. Dudley has a lot of shit.
“My scar! Let’s talk about my scar!”
“Justin Flinch-Fletchley.”
“I take it Howie told you the good news?”
Harry reaches over to grab the papers out of instinct. He’s always filled out his own information. Aunt Petunia taught him to write early specifically so that she wouldn’t have to bother with him. Although, he will need the new address but that can be found in legal documents when he’s cleaning.
Emilia sighs.
Thankfully, he remembered to put silencing spells around his room before shouting.
Before he can reply and assure her that it’s nothing too serious, his friends are speaking.
In the end, apparently Granger had royally messed up her personal potion, and after sneaking into the hospital wing to catch a glimpse at what the hell that meant, he almost felt pity for her. Snape did give the trio a copious amount of homework out of pure anger though. He did
Harry swears his stag rolls it’s eyes, but five minutes later Pansy is storming into the tent.
“It’s just...chalky?”
“You’re all prats, but we’re saving a life here, so let’s make this as painless as possible.”
----------
She melts a little bit, the red leaving her face just enough to be a faint blush, “Harry, dear. I’m sure you didn’t force their hands. What could a couple of harmless muggles do to you?”
Harry mimics the icy look Draco had given not even ten minutes ago. “Don’t forget to thank me when you face the Dementors.”
He nods numbly, letting Pansy and Blasie take him away.
deal with that at the moment. Besides, with the free time he could search for the Chamber in peace. And keep an eye on Potter.
“But I didn’t die-”
The snake takes a deep breath, Draco’s shaking next to him and is definitely going to kill him when he finds out that Harry basically just signed them up to heal a Deadly Dangerous Snake that they may or may not be able to heal. Maybe Draco and Hermione can team up and make a detailed book of all the things he does that pisses them off. It’d be a bestseller in
They part not long after, Blaise and Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle, waving goodbye to LuLu and Pansy. It had only taken them a few hours to realize how much the thing
Given the upcoming match, Draco, Harry, and Weasley hadn’t been able to attend their meetings as much, which left the other three in close quarters where they apparently got along just fine. In all honesty, between his studies and practices, Draco was so tired he didn’t give a rat’s ass about any of it.
“You….you is being a wizard?”
“What took you so long?”
See, he hadn’t meant to follow Draco Malfoy, he really had wanted to go and sleep for a bit before getting his head chewed off by McGonagall, but the boy
Draco’s always liked Kingsley. Kingsley is fair, if Draco still had the right to vote he’d be singing Kingsely’s praises to every ear that listened. Kingsley didn’t
happy with it. Draco was right, McGonagall being nice is terrifying, but McGonagall angry is not a sight he ever wants to see again. There’s a good reason that Dumbledore tries to stay on her good side.
Draco eyes Theo, then eyes the papers that seem to grow every day. He looks once to Mrs. Daisy, but she’s more on board with Theo’s plan than his own, so eventually he sighs and tosses half the stack in front of Theo. “This better be worth it.”
“I saw my mother recently," he rushed out. "She came home the week that Black was found, brought presents and everything. This she told me to give to you.”
Blaise would go next, making sure to be extra vicious because he’s almost as over protective as Ron. He’d begin with the quality of Petunia’s ‘fine’ china, slander Vernon’s favorite chair, make sure they know how drab and dreary the wall paper is. He would probably laugh at whatever Dudley thought cool, dumb down his sentences so Dudley could understand the level of insult being directed towards him.
Draco blinks twice, but Blaise and Pansy push him forward and the scratches he got from LuLu
He fumbles around in his bag for a bit, not looking her in the eyes, and pulls out the blue sweater Blaise used to make fun of him for.
(See the end of the chapter for

Green eyes are pleading with him to just drop it, which he isn’t going to do, and then something mildly alarming happens. Harry’s eyes clear and he sighs. “Can we talk about this somewhere that doesn’t make me want to hyperventilate?”
Lucius badly hides a laugh, Draco glares at both his parents for good measure. He’ll trick them later. Put salt in their coffee or something just as annoying.
“Call me a special breed, babe-”
I’d use the bloody curse myself if I-”
Harry: okay.

“You should’ve.” Theo whispers.
“Like you’re much better,” he snorts.
Draco has no fucking clue what to do here. Fleur is
Strong hands push him forward and he knows to scream. Maybe if someone hears him they can help him. He’ll die if he’s left like this, he’ll be tortured and-
“Thank you.” Ron says with a punch to his shoulder.
Blaise drags them into town during the evenings, sometimes shopping, other times to make fun of the weird things in muggle shops, sometimes to libraries that Pansy and Draco get bored of within five seconds.
“Kneazles only like people who are good for their owner. Like how Crookshanks likes the two of you, Mrs. and Mr. Weasley, my parents, and Dumbledore. Do you understand? LuLu is Malfoy’s Kneazle, she shouldn’t like us!”
“Misty, love, you didn’t even hear the conversation.”
On Saturday morning Draco’s woken up by Winky and Dobby both, which can’t be anything good.
he decides enough is enough.
Draco takes it in stride, “Are they really going to kill him?” He lets an edge of worry creep into his voice, just so his act is a little more convincing.
Sure enough, he’s handed back a suit that’s a plain khaki color, with no school attached to it. On the back, written in Slytherin green is ‘Potter Stinks!’ and that is a suit Harry will wear with pride.
It’s a stranger hissing sound, words are definitely underneath it, but he can’t make out what it is. Polly, however, does. Turning to look past Draco right at Harry fucking Potter, still speaking in the errie hissing voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Narcissa considers this with a small smile. “So you, Harry James Potter, want access to your own vault that has been locked? Was it done so by a family member?”
morgana: you big, stupid, ulg,y dumb bitch. i hate you
Draco shrugs, “You’ll find out soon enough.”
Sirius snorts at them, but his thanks is so sincere it almost makes Draco uncomfortable. “I assume he’s expected to join your little training camp?”
“What’s more important than your crusade against house elves?” Ron asks.
He can count to three before Hermione lets out a noise that sounds a little like a rat dying. “Probably?!”
Breakfast is always light, fruits and toast, sometimes eggs and coffee. They’ll change it up from there, sometimes homework, sometimes experimental brewing in the cauldron on the second floor, sometimes running just to see who can last the longest, sometimes laying around and doing their own things. Blaise will read, Pansy will paint, and Draco will play piano or mess around with LuLu. He hasn’t been alone since they arrived, and he finds he doesn’t mind it anymore.
“Nah, he’d be better off with someone like Susan Bones if he’s going out of house.”
Draco: this is literally just a dance, go have fun
“I’m sorry!” He tries again, “I didn’t mean to get so caught up in it, but it’s

Misty.”
Narcissa’s eyes narrow, Belle and Katheriene look as though the plush white chairs they’re sitting in have been ripped from underneath them. It’s understandable, only a crazy person would dare to lay a hand on a Malfoy.
“Oh!” June’s face drops. “Oh. So he could

A lie. If he were in trouble they wouldn’t be sitting with here making smores and drinking hot coco, he would’ve been accosted the second she got home.
A shiver tears through Draco’s spine, his father wasn’t supposed to be here. He needs the Snitch and he needs it now.
, he was getting no sleep. No sleep, the discovery of coffee, and no one to talk to was beginning to drive him up the wall if he was being honest, which is why when Crabbe and Goyle beg him to go to Hogsmeade with them, he nods about ten times.
Draco raises his arms slowly. His left one wraps around Theo’s waist, the right one comes up so he can cradle Theo’s head.
Hi! Fair warning, this chapter is through Harry's pov and the next chapter is going to start off with Draco's opinion of the week. It's not gonna be a repeat of classes and all that, but it'll highlight things he thinks about verses what Harry focuses on. Anyways, here's to giving Umbridge hell!
By October of his final year, he was straying from his routine. Straying from safety, security. Taking any risk he could because he couldn’t bear to walk down those halls and not
Before Harry could wonder what ‘this’ is, Lucius swiftly brought his boot to his son’s head, the boy going limp, much to Harry’s horror. He waited until Lucius grumbled something about having a disgrace for a son and left before he moved, tentatively stepping to Malfoy’s side until he was kneeling beside him.
“Is it safe yet, mother?”
“Yep. Unless you’re going to back out of a trade.”
Blaise pushes past them, following the other Slytherins into the common room and making a beeline for the open couch by the fire. “How big is your family now anyways, Draco?”
It’s that exact moment that everything comes crashing down and Dobby throws the sock on the floor, wailing and beating his head into the floor. “Dobby is a stupid elf! Dobby doesn’t know! Dobby has no home now! Nowhere to go! Dobby will die with no wizard to protect him! Dobby is-”
“You absolutely will not-”
“He’s a big deal…” Millie echos, a little bit disgusted which doesn’t make sense at all. “He’s
He’ll deal with it tomorrow.
“I found him. LuLu led me to him, she’s been under my feet all week, so when she started running I followed.”
“That’s-” Draco frowns. “That’s different!”
“What Millie is trying to say is that she’s a back-stabbing friend who

Draco nods, grinning at the jab, “It
“It is?!” Draco jumps up, dragging Harry with him. “Why didn’t you start with that?! We have to go!”
The only thing Draco could weasel out of her was that she had ‘a friend’ in the Ministry who supported Draco. And
“That will surely be an issue, but you have things to worry about as well, Draco…”
“Not long. I found you shortly after Mr. Malfoy left. I do have to ask, how long has he been abusing you?”
He frees his arms, using the leverage to pull Draco close again and suddenly Draco understands the hugs.
….never had a trail…...
If he doesn’t find a home for Misty and Salem so he can pitch himself off a cliff, that is.
now look! A scarfaced freak tag along-”
Harry nods.
He’ll be let out in the morning for chores, but for now he has to worry about hiding his newer puffy eye, Draco will be calling any minute.
Fleur shakes her head at the lot of them, much like Theo’s doing. Harry lets himself get caught up in it all until he remembers the reason he came here first instead of going to Ron and Hermione is because he needs to talk to Narcissa, not drag Draco to a dark corner and snog him senseless.
“Of course, if it were me, I wouldn’t be acting like a good little boy such as yourself, I’d be out there looking for him. Nothing says revenge like a dead body, Potter.”
this is stupid, but he’s hasn’t been meeting his yearly quota, and Hermione’s already pissed at him so there’s really nothing stopping him from adding to his Stupid Life Choices.
“I didn’t know you and Pansy were still in touch.”
“It was, by far, the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen.” Theo tells him.
“Well you never have been good with words, have you? Name her already! I’d very much like to stop calling her ‘Draco’s Kneazle’.”
Potter on the Quidditch field? Reporting the Mudblood’s fall? Staying out because you’re
Pansy grins, “We did, but that’s because me and Draco actually care about our education.”
He gets a chuckle out of the man who uncrosses his arms and nods. “Well, Malfoy, it seems to me like you’re in good working condition. Carry on to your dorm, now, you should get some sleep before the first day.”
As if feeling the panic growing, Fawkes burrows into his arms. Quiet stretches between them, each lost in a different train of thought. If the chamber is opened...someone will die...and that someone might be Potter, the only chance they have against the Dark Lord. And if there is an even bigger possibility that Hogwarts will shut down, that means there’s a chance he will have to return to the manor, where Dumbledore cannot protect him. Bleaker than this morning, Draco meets the headmaster’s eyes. He’s rewarded with a kind smile and another nuzzle from the Phoenix in his arms.
With that done, it’s merely six o’clock, and the only things Draco has left to put away are personal artifacts that have no place.
hi! Sorry for not updating for a bit, I had to take some emntal ehalth time and everythign is both falling apart and trying to fall back together lol. anyways, I'm still alive! sorry for the wait
Have you shown Severus yet?”
“No.” Sirius shakes his arm loose. “No….let me tell you what’s going to happen. Remus is picking Harry up tomorrow, when I get home I’ll offer him the adoption papers. He is going to have a
I thought I was going to die at least five times during that.”
Two faces come into view. One dark and flawless, hair short yet still curling, eyes narrowed, lips in a thin frown. Draco doesn’t care for the frown on the boy, it makes him feel

“Willie?” Cedric snorts. “He’s perfectly harmless.”
“Okay…” Sirius takes a deep breath, “Okay...okay we can’t kill them. We’re going to out parent the fuck out of them and I’m going to make Narcissa help me hurt them through completely legal and respectable ways.”
“One!” Lockheart hollers, “Two! Three-”
“Good, they might snap it so be prepared-”
“You see, Potter beat the Dark Lord as a baby, and there I was, standing between the most powerful wizard in the world and the most powerful Potions Master in the world, both allied with the kid who beat the Dark Lord without even trying. I’d have been a fool not to pick my side then and there. Plus I saw with my own two eyes what following the Dark Lord does to your mind...it’s not pretty.”
“You’re right, I’m betting he likes incense made of, I dunno, children.”
“I’m not wearing this.”
Winky hands it to him before he can snatch it.
A bush of hair and red-rimmed eyes poke out of the covers and glare at him, “I
“Wonderful. Narcissa is
how you’ve been sneaking around so much! Like an invisibility cloak isn’t enough, you had a fucking guide book as well? Thank Merlin Lupin took it from you, only Salazar knows what kind of trouble you could’ve gotten yourself into!”

Lulu, upon seeing Riddle in Harry's mind: fucking bAsTaRd!
On his previous muggle shopping trips, he and Blasie always had to transfigure their money when no one was looking before even leaving Hogwarts, and now, thanks to modern goblin technology, he can simply swipe his card and let the bank deal with it.
“Mum.” Pansy slowly retracts herself, but the slight tremor in her shoulders makes Harry want to cry. “Mum, stop. You knew what risks searching for a connection from Riddle would pose.” She turns tear stained lashes to Harry and lets her shield fall so she can hug him. “I hate to be the one to tell you, but I have really bad news. The worst, actually.”
laughed at his expense from time to time. He loves Percy, despite his loyalty to the Ministry. He loves Chalire, even if all he knows about the man is his love for Dragons. He loves Bill, even if the man is kinda threatening. He loves Molly, even when she’s bad mouthing Sirius out of worry. He loves Arthur, despite his annoying questions about muggles.
Pansy whirls on him, “Because I’d rather not see Draco
Pansy smiles sweetly, “I do love charity work.”
“Draco, it’s not that we don’t trust you...it’s just not safe. Everyone is terrified of who will be next, and we don’t want it to be you in the hospital wing.”
“Are you
first draft of his Transfiguration essay. Yes, he’s fucking pissed about it.
The question throws him off for a moment, anger forgotten, “Ah-no, not right now, I’m not hungry.”
“I’ll be back. Send LuLu when he wakes.”
“On the plus side, no one has blamed your house yet.”
Helga comes out angry, cursing and speaking so fast Harry has trouble catching up with her. But when she spots him there’s no question about what she was saying.
“No, you giant prat, what do you think about when you make your Patronus?”
Narcissa studies him for a moment, and then, as if she had never cared about him in the first place, she says “You will go down to the dungeons and lock yourself in chains within the third room.”

“On the last try we left him dead for exactly one minute and then brought him back, positively ruined my new plans for the dungeons.”

The two Professors glance at him in amusement before McGonagall’s eyes shade over. “I do so hope you find something…” she bites her lips, lowering his voice and speaking quickly, “Potter and Ronald Weasley are missing. They weren’t present for the dorm checks and I fear…”
Draco aparates to the outskirts of a small castle.
Snape leaves out the ‘no one got taken when Dumbledore was here’ unspoken, but Draco sure as hell thinks it. Fawkes is waiting for them, pacing around the floor and squeaking as soon as the two enter the room. He flies into the sorting hat, trying to get it, much to the hat’s dismay.
see that filthy animal dead!”
“But sir, wouldn’t that jeopardize all of us here? If he and I became friends, he would find out everything, and would that not be a problem? Dangerous for all of us?”
“I know, I know. I’m not trying to distract you, I just...I didn’t want to talk about this down there. Not yet.”
The dragon stills, wings flapping to keep them high in the sky. Harry can barely make out the tops of trees.
“But he’s innocent!” Draco protests, “He hasn’t-”
“I like it.” Harry shrugs, “Cooking is calming.”
He’s grateful, so very thankful that sometimes he gets choked up about it. Even in the little tasks, like having tea with Narcissa, baking with Mrs. Wealsey, getting caught in Mr. Wealsey’s and Lucius’s debates, even just hanging out with his friends is enough to get his heart all mushy.
little cousin came.
“And for the record,” Ron sits beside his sister and brothers, Luna on the floor smiling in front of them, “I did not
With Misty practically pushing him forward, Draco makes his way to the front of the bank. He looks back at her, debating on running out the door and how fast it would be before security stopped him.
Instead of wondering down that rabbit hole, Draco pauses with Hermione mid-step. “Harry, Ron, do you two really not have dates?”
Draco Malfoy doesn’t look bothered in the least by being pushed and threatened by his father, a sign that Harry wishes he didn’t know so well by now. This was a common occurrence, given the way he calmly responds.
For whatever reason, Kingsley has started coming around noon, spending half the day with Draco, and doesn’t leave until eight at night. Usually it’s because Kingsley is updating him on the world he left, telling him about the Ministry, how his mother is doing, any weird happenings that Draco might have insight on. It always feels a bit like saying goodbye to an old friend when he leaves, but Draco doesn’t mind, because he has Misty and Salem.
Draco blinks.
“Ah, you don’t talk much, huh? You the quiet wizard ol’ Sal was talking about? His son, little Willie, was raving about you yesterday, thinks all the younger wizards hang the moon and stars that one.”
“When Severus found me in the dungeon where he was keeping me, he killed the man and took me away. We found out I had been held for three months, and I was already starting to show that I was with child. He kept me safe and hidden, became my friend. Helped me the first few months that Willie was born, and then, when William was old enough, he helped us sneak away to Russia where I found out about the Durm. About the students that were suffering there, and I had my mind healer license, but because of the war I had not gotten the chance to use it, so I became the school mind healer.”
Pansy speaks first, “Draco…”
Draco, foaming at the mouth: Y E S
He doesn’t speak for a while, and when he does it’s a pathetic excuse of hiding the truths that catch up to him in bed every night.
“Seeing as you were mostly helpful,” the man begins, ignoring his son’s withering and gasping, “I will refrain from cursing you. However, it is time for you to stop making these little mishaps.” He dug his shoe deeper into Draco’s stomach, Harry couldn’t turn away even though he was begging to.
“Yeah, he was in this house and this old guy got killed, it’s uh, it’s a long story.”
A smile breaks out on his face, “Bunch of idiots we were. James came from the Potter line, so naturally we knew each of each other, but I was never allowed to meet him because his parents were too liberal, and my Mother had picked our family’s side. James...well he was unlike any pureblood I’d ever met. Didn’t bother with table manors, didn’t listen to the rules, hell I’m amazed he even passed first year with the amount of shit he pulled...granted Remus did keep us both in check when Lily wasn’t screaming down our throats and Lily...well she was our Hermione. Absolutely brilliant, yelled at us when we bullied Severus, always got on to us when we didn’t do our homework, or when we got up to shit we shouldn’t have. She was also the first to drag us to the hospital wing when someone so much as coughed, even if she did hang around Severus a lot back then. James took me with him for Christmas that first year and once I met parents that hugged me and treated me like their own, well I couldn’t go back to that dark house.”
“Yes, master.”
“So your mother got you LuLu, what is the story behind your cut?”
“I think it’s funny….when her rage isn’t directed at me, of course.”
Crabbe and Goyle, sensing the impending argument between his two best friends and himself, had actually offered to sit with the other Slytherins on the ride back. Something about Nott having a new game to play, but from the looks in their eyes he could tell they didn’t want to get caught between Pansy’s wrath and Blaise’s fury.
Charlie arrived moments after Ginny quietly requested to go to bed, Bill and Fleur stepping through the floo moments later. Percy sent a letter, accompanied by Tonk’s detailed description of the type of hell Percy is currently raising at the Ministry. He’s never seen the Weasleys look so panicked, and he

like the cold. She demands chicken when she sees it, and whines when someone tries to take off her sweater. It smells like a mix of cat and citrus spice, Harry tries not to dwell on it.
in their right minds would think of laying a finger on my son?”
An image of Geia, curled up on stones that are suddenly cold, water that freezes her wings, talons overgrown and aching.
Harry is dying to open his eyes and see if there are actual spider webs around him, because he highly doubts Narcissa would allow such a thing in her home, but then the strangest thing happens. Everyone he’s ever known flashes in front of him. Ron, Hermione, Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Sirius, Remus, McGonagall, Theo, Millie, Neville, the Dursleys, Narcissa, everyone from those closest to him to the fucking knightbus driver. And in the middle of them all is him, well, not him, because this version of him has red eyes and is running at him so fast that Harry feels like he’s floating. His familiar mess of hair sheds to revel a pale scalp, his nose closes and shrinks, he grows several inches taller and Harry finds that it was ever him with red eyes, but Riddle disguised as him and he’s getting
Draco can’t move. He can see Alive and Real Harry gasping in his peripherals, but Dead and Crawling Towards Him Boggart Harry has captured his full attention. He can’t
“I heard he was an amazing Seeker. I meant to see him play, but every time I tried Dementors showed up.”
“Ah! The Hand of Glory!” Mr.Borgin rushes to explain-like Draco doesn’t already know- but the second the words ‘friend of thieves’ leaves the man’s mouth, he knows he’ll never be allowed to have it. Rising to bait his son is something Lucius would never pass, and his grades are sensitive enough a topic to have Draco red and annoyed.
“Trust me, I was equally as shocked.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” the toneless voice says, although Draco swears he can sense worry under it all, “Come with me immediately. Your luggage will be seen to, you can bring your Kneazle, and do not worry about dinner. You will eat in my office.”
And in its absence, Draco stands.
On Mondays and Wednesdays he would meet with Lupin to try and tackle Dementors, which wasn’t easy because he refused to use the bogart and catching real ones isn’t exactly easy work. He knows that one day Lupin will force him to face the creature, and he will...as soon as he can figure out an explanation for what he’ll see, that is. Weeks pass in flashes and before he knows it he’s waking up to one of his favorite days.
“What do you mean?”
“I guess I really don’t have much of a choice then, do I?”
Draco chuckles, “I’d like to see him cast a spell, just once.”
“We have no one to tell-”
The rest of them don’t have any clue what to do because never in their wildest dreams did any of them ever expect
Dumbledore shoots hum a sad smile, but answers truthfully. “Because you are as much a son to me as Severus is. I know it can’t be easy and I worry about you. If you had come to me sooner, some of these issues might have been avoided. For one, we’ll need to teach you about protecting yourself against Dementors, and we’ll have to teach you potions to heal dark arts wounds.”
hard.
“Did you put Veritaserum in the marshmallows?”
Harry swallows as his friends shake their heads, and he can see Ron begging with his eyes to leave the room with him and the girls, but Harry steps up, between the twins and their mother.
“-we already know.”
“Winky, dry your eyes, you’ll not be going home without a family tonight.”
“It’s not much,” Lupin explains as he opens it to reveal a small silver frog that looks exactly like the ones Lupin forced them to eat after each practice, “But it’s something to remember good times by.”
Remus looks sadder, which makes him look more like the real Remus. “Yes I’m real, come out of there, silly.”
Before anyone could reach to help the boy collect his belongings, the goblin began to sing and it was all Draco could do not to burst into laughter before he got the book. A poem about his eyes, his hair, how brave he was against the Dark Lord, all so

“This still isn’t making any-“
“Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?”
Narcissa chuckles, coming behind the boy to put an arm around his shoulders in a half hug.
Blaise chuckles, “I’m personally looking forward to finally knowing where he sneaks off to every night. I feel like a worried father.”
They look out to the ocean, pulled in by the push.

Draco flushes, Potter protests. “We do not get into that much trouble-”
Fleur looks at him with wide eyes, Luna just keeps smiling, like she’s watching something she’s already expected.
Almost like he’d have to open up now, even though the Tempus her wand cast clearly read 3:03 a.m.
Right beneath his ribcage, blossoming like a flower in an unkept garden, flowing through his veins until he’s smiling back while his friends bicker in the background. It’s not quite nice, not unkind to his senses yet disturbing to how he usually feels during the summertimes. This feeling is usually reserved for Hogwarts, for sleepy nights in the Gryffindor tower, sneaking glances at Draco during potions, listening to Pansy and Blaise fight over whose outfit is better.

“Did you say Asklepios, like
in the library, it won’t take them long.”
Much less with five friends, in his godfather’s house, happy and full.
“We all hate her, dear. Just follow my lead.”
Draco flicks it at the desk, ruffling papers with a nonverbal wind charm. He floats the boxes of wands that didn’t work for him back into place, he even points it at himself, casting a nonverbal calming spell that settles around him like his favorite blanket.
He’s floored by the amount.
“Mister Draco is being rich!”
She pins the younger girls with a kind smile and worried eyes, “Sirius Black has escaped Azkaban.”
“Do not worry,” Dumbledore doesn’t ease his grip, “They cannot see us in a memory.”
"We deserve something as simple as a friendship after all this bullshit don’t we?!” he yells, whirling to capture green eyes with something blazing behind his own.
He takes a closer look at the sleeping boy before him. Quiet and calm, Potter doesn’t look disgusting for once. Instead, he looks peaceful, like nothing bad can reach him where he is in his dreams. Draco finds himself envious, half wanting to join Potter in dream land, a faraway place where not even the Dark Lord could get him. He thinks back to the last face Potter made at him, disgust mixed with hated, and lets out another, deeper sigh.
. Is that clear? Furthermore you should know that signing these types of contracts are extremely serious and cannot be broken once your blood is on the page. You’ll each need a copy of it and not, once it is signed you cannot change the contents but it will aid in your safety and I am willing to risk others for that at this point-”
Misty narrows her big black eyes, “You is saying that about the bath too!”
“I’m George!”
Pansy and Blaise are always down to sabotage, and with Draco’s brilliance their plan can’t fail. The two of them will keep the meeting between Dumbledore and Aurors going until Sirius can escape, and Draco will watch over him to make sure no one gets excited and tries to kill him just for the hell of it. Ron had protested to no ends about not being able to do anything but-
“We get it, doll,” Blaise rolls his eyes but Draco takes delight in the flush on the taller boy’s cheeks, “I’m your moon and stars, just remember that when I don’t save you from Pansy’s wrath.”
Draco grins at her.
“And when will that be?” Pansy snaps. Draco’s energy seems to return at the remark, filled with anger and annoyance.
“And anyways, them knowing about the Slytherins is completely different from them knowing about
“That’s Malfoy to you.” Draco turns on his heel, glaring into green eyes. “We
He tries not to think about Blaise’s laugh and Pansy’s smile. About his mother’s exasperated sighs and his godfather's hidden humor.
“Two!”
Millie looks like her entire world has been changed, “The
Dumbledore has that stupid twinkle in his eye again.
Hagrid’s hut still disgusts him, and Merlin does he hate the walk down, but his father hadn’t told him the final remark, and he had to be sure before throwing himself into finding a course of action. Two knocks later and he regrets coming more than he regrets being born into a shit-show of a family.
“I see.” The old man waves his hand and Fawkes appears in the room, happily messing up Draco’s hair with his beak, he can’t find it in himself to stop the phoenix.
While Harry is thankful to see his home again he wishes the circumstances were better.
Draco whirls to him and nods frantically, “Twice! I’ve fallen for it twice now!”
Remus sighs. “Go, Molly, we’ll look after the kids.”
The game had been spectacular, partly because it was something
Harry shivers at that, making a pathetic excuse for a laugh and then says something to clearly indicate that he’s unhappy with the whole situation. “Can we study now? I need to pass my History of Magic exams and I never learn anything from Binns.”
“All of the sudden?!” Millie fires back, “You would know about this if you ever listened to me and your other roommate!”
Draco raises an eyebrow, “Yes? I’m only going to see Snape.”
Snape sneers at him, “
“Fantastic! What’s arsenic?”
happen was effecting Harry. Eye bags no child should have, the constant lost look, not to mention the physical damage from first year alone. “Do you even care about him? You’ve seen the stuff he’s gone through in the past three years, you know this is nothing compared to what’s coming but you can’t even manage a ‘hi, Harry, thought you’d like to know that your parents were loved and not brutally betrayed!’ Hasn’t he been through enough
Draco raises an eyebrow, “What do you mean?”
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.
“Cool! Gimme one second,” He says to them, then turns his head to the back of the store, “Dad! We’ve got a mature wand!”
“So,” Their tea has long grown cold, his friends wear matching shocked expressions, but they haven’t run away screaming yet. “That’s the truth. As much of it as you’ll get out of me, anyways. I am currently spying on my father and anything else suspicious so I can keep Potter alive, and since I’m protecting him it kinda made sense to befriend him, and yes I’m also working with Dumbledore and Snape, and now I’ve admitted to you two that I am a blood traitor, a worthless excuse for a pureblood, and probably gone mental. But neither of you can talk about it, so now you get to go mad with me.”
“Is that where you come in? Saving Harry until he faces the one thing you might not be able to save him from?”
“That...
“Alright! Alright! I’m sorry I was reckless and got hurt, you can complain to Professor Lupin tomorrow.”
He points to Carla. “-might just be a Ravenclaw, so you clearly don’t get it.”

“She does have a name-”
“It’s my vault. My family vault, I mean. Apparently it’s locked until I’m seventeen, so all this ancestry stuff doesn’t really make any sense, and I really just need thirty minutes inside to peek around and see if I can find a journal.”
Harry, cold, putting on Draco's sweater:
“My cup isn’t empty.”
They manage to cut him off at the last second and for the first time since he started school, Draco’s head feels wonderful. He’s sitting in his cabin, Crabbe and Goyle too stupid to make conversation that makes any form of sense, and Blaise too involved in some book to bother talking. Staring out the window, watching the scenery pass by, it’s calming. Comforting. Something about the green hills and clear sky eases his mind and his anxiety. It’s nice enough for Pansy to look up and smile at him. “Enjoying yourself, Draco?”

Ginny snickers across the room, Harry looks back at the paper.
“Sorry, Mr. Wealsey.”

Pomfrey glares at him in a very calculated way that he doesn’t really care for.
“It’s
“He….did he just….did he just take Potter’s bones?”
So yeah, he should probably sit down with his Ancestry book and figure it out, but he promised to go by Hagrid’s hut and tell him all about the trial, and because Krum seems like the type to like big dogs, Cedric likes Hagrid, and Fleur’s sister also likes big dogs, all the other champions (and Gabbi) join him, and he can’t
“Imagine if Harry
Winky blushes, her ears going back a bit, “Yes sir.”
Not that it ends well for the elf because by then they’re almost done, and it’s nearly five. Hazy sunlight fills the room and they’re covered in dust, but the song is slow. Sirius isn’t really sure how they end up there, it could be Remus swatting him with a towel, or when Sirius ‘accidentally’ splashed him with water, or maybe when he tried to run from the man’s payback and somehow ended up in his arms. It doesn’t matter much, because before they know it they’re dancing.
Since Blaise and Pansy are probably too busy figuring out what the fuck is going on, Draco is the one to ask what they’re all thinking. “I thought you were on the Dark Lord’s side?”
He’s not really sure how he knows it, but he opens the door and it’s like being punched in the face with the word ‘yes’.
“While his
“R-Remus! S-S-Sirius!” Merlin, even the man’s voice sounds like a rat. “My friends!”
Draco hasn’t the faintest clue until Winky brings him the morning paper.
“-Did you know? Merlin, he was screaming so loud I thought he’d been murdered.” Sirius is saying. Draco catches his arm, pulling him back before they can interrupt whatever conversation his godfathers are having.
“I can’t believe-”
Her last owners were purebloods, like him, but, unlike him, they were kind. The Mister, Garon if Draco’s been listening right, was obsessed with muggle plants, always researching how he could mix muggle plants with wizard plants to create something new, even though it always failed. The Mistress, Emilia, was a recluse. She spent time down by the water, made her money through selling potions even though she apparently had a trust fund so big Misty couldn’t count it all.
Taking a seat by the ledge so he can see the stars and the paper in front of him, Draco gins at his friends. The contract is all fairly clear and thought out, and once making sure it’s full of things he’s comfortable with, and has enough wiggle room, he takes a pen.
ship.
Snape disregards him completely, striding over to Malfoy and lifting his chin, going over several assessments. Harry brings more bandages and warm water; Dumbledore instructs him to clean the cut on Malfoy’s arm. It’s in the same spot as his wound from Buckbeak...he washes it gently, listening closely to the conversation above him.
Hagrid
“Where are we going?!” Draco screams, casting a protection spell he’s fully aware no fourteen year old should know around them.
George isn’t happy either, “There’s always that Christmas basket we forgot to send.”
draco: you're an idiot
Surprisingly, when they’re not busy insulting each other, the two of them get along swimmingly. Granger leads him over to a desk with notes piled as high as a text book and they pointedly ignore everyone else in the room to dive head-first into them. Sometime during all their debate on whether it would be worth pointing out that Buckbeak was only reacting to his natural instincts, the rest of their weird combination had piled around. He does note that Weasley and Harry stay closer to Granger and Pansy and Blaise stay close to him.
hello! i'm sorry that this was super late, the storms this week fucked with our power and my roomates and i had a little trouble getting out wifi back, but i'm here! i'll still be updating on wednesday! and i'll be replying to your comments on the last chapter as soon as this is posted! thank you so much for all the compliments, i genuinely didn't expect to receive such positive feedback and it's amazing! also, i know draco gets a bit of rough sex this chapter, and that it gets a little deep with the past between Kingsley and everyone, but slytherins don't trust people just to trust people, you know. anyways, i hope you enjoyed and i'll see you on wednesday!
Howie and June are near tears by the time he stops ranting. Thankfully, Carla just seems fondly exasperated.
“No it’s not! Harry whines back. They’ve been arguing for the past hour about it. Ginny, Millie, and the twins are the resident welders for the evening, churning out dozens of buttons within minutes thanks to whatever spell Draco used. Hermione, Pansy, Draco, and Blaise charm and transfigure the metal. Ron, Harry, and Luna are stuck on cooling duty.
On a scale of awful to hellish, the smile he’s looking at is probably the second worst thing he’s seen today, right under realizing a pure creature was going to die because of him. It honestly activates his flight or fight response more than his father does, and that’s saying something.
Yeah, okay. Sounds reasonable, if Draco didn’t look like a zombie this past week Harry might even buy into it. Only, Draco looked worse than Hermione. Or maybe that’s because Hermione’s dark skin sometimes hides her bags, and Pansy’s been leaving her little scrunchies that she turns red and gold so her hair doesn’t get as messed up and abused. Bags show up on Draco’s pale skin like ink on parchment paper. His hair is falling a little above his shoulders, which means for the past week Harry’s had to watch him twirl and twist the pale gold locks as he studied.
Even so Draco grits his teeth, trying to call on all that rage he had earlier. Fleur told him that until he could call on it naturally, he had to use whatever emotion his flames responded to. When she was younger, her flames burned away her tears, meaning they reacted to her sadness before becoming controlled. Gabbi, apparently, burns everything when she laughs if she’s not careful, which means she’s already got a leg up on Draco despite being a few years younger.
“No.” Harry doesn’t know what possesses him to do it, but he leans a bit closer to the boy, “Malfoy was there for me when I was in here. He’s saved my life before, I can’t just leave him now. You know I’d just sneak back down here when the two of you fall asleep anyways.”
hi, here's that one chapter I've been promising for weeks. IT'S HERE! Are you excited? Because I am!
fly a car across London.”
“To begin our story, we must speak of the day my life and Severus’s collided. It was during the first war, on a battlefield in…”
“Harry will do whatever the hell he wants, as he is no longer of your concern. As of this day, if he never wants to see you again he won’t have to.”
Harry plops down on the side of her big pillow, pulling Draco down with him. They end up lying side by side, Harry on his stomach so he can look Geia in her no-eyes, and Draco on his back staring at the ceiling.

to tell him what that meant. He already knew he was something different to Malfoy than the boy let on, but he wasn’t ready to figure that out quite yet.
“It sounds like you already have your answer, why do you ask for my opinion? Should you desire to become Mr. Potter’s friend, it would be improper of me as Headmaster to stop you.”
hello! I'm super excited because NEXT WEEK IS IT!!! I get to post the work I've been dying to post, so here's a bit of pre information with it because I won't be adding this much information in the description and I'm dying to gush about it. Literally, I started writing it when I was stressed and really sad and thinking about a house i'd like to live in to get away from everything, so I started playing around on the sims and mid way through I got frustrated because the sims wasn't doing my house justice so I was like 'lets write about it' and now i have a whole fanfiction just for fun and it's wonderful!
“You know, Draco,” Snape whispers, making sure no one is around before he growls out, “Whatever your father is trying to pull this year might not work because I’ve decided I’m going to kill Potter first.”
“Well, if you really think of Sirius and I as your family, then you should probably call me Remus. I’m not a teacher anymore, you know.”
Lupin grins, “I can see that already.”
scary. I bet you could make a first year pass out with that one.”
Then again, maybe he’d like to vanish from this conversation entirely.
Draco shushes him, rubbing his back like Ron had. “I’m getting to hold my boyfriend, why on Earth would you apologize for such a thing?”
“Hear us out, love, this is actually more for your benefit.”
Draco pulls away with a grimace that matches his godfather’s. “If you don’t speak of it I won’t.”
A bit like the ocean, actually.
After a few more questions the man nods and comes back with three wands, none of them work for Draco, so they end up going through

Narcissa, bloodied and lying on the floor, Lucius laughing above her, wand drawn, the ebony knife in his other hand, dripping with some maroon liquid. LuLu, mangled and barely breathing. Dobby, chained and being beaten by his father. His friends, proudly showing their Dark Marks, grinning and killing at the same time. Fawkes with his neck snapped, Dumbledore falling and falling and falling...Snape with wide eyes, some green light hits him in the chest, he stumbles. Harry comes into view, but there’s something wrong….the boy starts turning and-
“I’m sorry again for not consulting you, Molly. These
“Maybe we’re sharing?” Blaise asks.
Anyways, I went off on a tangent while I was writing this because I wanted Draco to finally have a birthday that's actually celebrated, so think of this as a filler episode before another main plot point. See you next Sunday!
Ron smiles at him. “Three for three, you’re pretty good.”
“What did Geia tell you anyways? She was talking for hours.”
“Nonsense, Krecher would never leave a mess lying around.” the Blacks say together, much to Draco’s amusement. He turns those grey eyes on Remus after a moment of watching his mother laugh.

Draco hisses. “There is nothing between me and
Draco feels like he should be offended, but he’s been called much worse and the man is definitely right in this case.

“It’s not completely unfiltered!”
And he knows, of course he does. Bad things rarely happen to bad people, Uncle Vernon taught him that. His parents were good people, and they died. Sirius is a good person, and he spent twelve years in Azkaban. Remus is a good person, and he got bitten by a werewolf.
Draco latches on the lighter topic like it’s his only hope, “So you’re the reason he’s so good at Quidditch!”
“So you’ve traded tea for coffee,” Dumbledore muses, a grin on his cheeks.
hi everyone, I know it's been a while since the last chapter. my best friend has been making an effort to spend every off day with me since my dog died and while I adore them for trying to make me feel better it's really cut down on my writing time. Anyways, I sound be back on our normal schedule soon and I'm so very excited for the next chapter. have a wonderful day and thank you again for all the support
“Ronald,” Pansy smiles, all sly and creep. “How personally and intimately would you like to know me?”
Anyways,
Oh. That ‘how long’.
It happens all at once.
They lock eyes for the billionth time this evening, and then Draco, because he is tired, and because he saw a younger version of the man he most feared, and because Harry
Snape, to Flitwick after finding out about Flora: if you wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on, but you're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets, you don't even know my real name-
When the final word is uttered Draco watches blue sparks form across the sea, rush up the cliffside, and settle on Misty’s little body. The glowing sparks fade on her pale skin, like some sort of intricate tattoo.
“No!” Draco snaps, and then immediately feels guilty when Misty’s eyes widen with hurt. “I’m sorry,” he rushes out, “I didn’t mean to snap at you, I’m just tired, and I wasn’t lying when I said I used up a lot of magic today, I promise I didn’t mean to be rude-”
done, Draco lies back on the floor of the living room, welcoming Salem out of hiding and into his arms. The kneazle kitten has just settled down for a nap on his chest when Misty comes into the room, a piece of parchment and a half broken quill in her hands.
Sirius just laughs and Draco can’t stop himself from doing the same.
“You literally rebuilt the Prynne House, and I recall Misty mentioning that you built her a greenhouse?”
“Eh?” came the ever fruitful response. Dear Merlin, his irritation was spiking and he couldn’t even hex anyone now.
“Hey! Harry isn’t a git, he’s-wait. Hold on a moment. Train my mind? I already have pretty good occulamany shields, Malfoys learn them at an early age.”
Ron gives him a look. “I’m too hungry to deal with this right now, let’s go.”
tonight! I should be thanking him- and his father- instead of defending them!”
Misty glares at him, taking the bags he hands her and turning to smile at Theo. She even bows in her pretty dandelion dress, “It is lovely to be meeting you, sir, Misty will make tea right away!”
But Harry is gone. And Draco is standing in the bathroom with a giggling Myrtle, a headache, and a need to fucking shower.
“Just like it’s strange for a Snake to cozy up with a Lion?”
“Training for the ballet, Potter?” He yelled, trying to keep himself from screaming ‘can you go one damn day without being hurt?!’ or worse, ‘be careful my father is trying to kill you!’.
There’s a little creek and light floods his cupboard. He squints a little, the light really is blinding, but even more blinding is the happiness that comes from seeing Remus’s face.
“Eat, Draco.”
“What a shame,” Draco deadpans back, keeping his hands against Blaise’s chest so the boy can’t reach him.
“It looks wonderful-”
“He asked that I let him,” Dumbledore snaps back, wand never ceasing, “He was worried about his position, his father cannot know-”
their titles, they
house, Mister Draco.” Misty scolds as she pads into the room.
It’s like they’re trying to add to Hermione’s fire.
Or maybe not.
“Apologies, I should’ve warned you that the first time is always the worst.”
Not with a murder out to get him, maybe next year though.
“Not here.”
Harry. If you hadn’t done what you did, Arthur would have died.”
“Can’t I at least stun him-”
“No.”
and I get to eat like a king? I don’t think you understand, I had no one. Not a single soul had shown me kindness until Hagrid, and when Ron’s mom didn’t even blink before she helped me...I was floored. And then Ron...he just sat with me and filled me in on what he could without even looking at me funny. I’d never been so accepted, never had a friend before, but suddenly there was this new world and someone who was my age but didn’t order me around like a slave, or hit me, or even
sick in the head. Or like...how long has it been since he hacked at his skin like a wannabe lumberjack. Do those still exist? Who’s to say, honestly. Who cares? Who-
The elf bows, “Master Regulus loved his brother, and I be loving Master Regulus. Master Sirius and Mistress Narcissa were the only ones to show kindness to him, he talked about you lots before he died. I be honoring my Master’s memory is all, sir.”

“Come along, Harry.” Remus says, offering an arm, and Harry’s not sure what he’s supposed to do, but he takes it and the world starts to spin.

Naturally, the Weasley twins would bring up the thing that makes him the most uncomfortable when he's already anxious, but before he can react Flint is sneering.

“Honestly, Hare, we leave you for thirty minutes and you’re knocked off your feet.”
Misty passes him their water cup.
The Kneazle purrs in his lap, rubbing her head into Draco’s stomach that is growing warm with affection. She didn’t know about the abuse, she assumed it was to protect him, of course she allowed it. She would do anything and everything to keep him safe. “Thank you, mother.” He swallows, throat unbearably clogged, “I can’t explain how much this means to me.”
He is
and also
“Right. Are you going to
Draco would call bullshit, but he has to call Winky for his father’s potions. It’s not a total loss, after all, he doesn’t have to call bullshit when Narcissa can do it with a single look.
The child doesn’t even wither at the look he gets for that comment.
Draco groans once more, Blaise laughs from across the room, and he resigns himself to the fact that he will not be getting any sleep until Christmas break.
chose to suffer does not mean we chose to do it with you.” She tells him threateningly, even as she’s tucking herself into his side. Draco makes to leave, he was supposed to have the snacks to Theo thirty minutes go, but his mum pulls him in close.
Turning the corner, he sees Crabbe and Goyle glaring at Percy Weasley, who makes the nastiest face at his friends. His friends who had kept their heads down and tried so hard for their grades, only to fail, getting told off for no reason. They’ve been through enough this year, he decides as he strides towards the group.
All three of them choke on absolutely nothing.
June snorts, and yeah, Draco gets it. There are very few shops left that he’s loyal too.
“It must be the result of LuLu,” he coolly replies. An upgrade from the stuttering he was sure he would have.
Misty tugs on his hand. “The ocean is telling Mister Draco to stop, so Mister Draco should be stopping.”
Her nails dig into the back of his throat.
“They were at our house a lot over summer, sir. I couldn’t go anywhere without running into one, eventually I guess I built a resistance.”
To call it awkward would be the understatement of the century. A more accurate word would be painful, excruciating maybe. Something along those lines.
Now he sat on the other end of the long dinner table, eating in deafening wordlessness, chewing the only sound despite there being two people in the room.
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that so he just throws his arm around his god-father and calls it a day.
and very
The shock on Draco’s face must be a little
“Whatever, he’s been sneaky around here too much for my liking. I bet he’s trying to take down the heir of Slytherin single-handedly.”

for his soul, but horrible for his bank account.
Draco freezes.
“Hey! Blaise-Bear!” He calls out, “What the fuck!”
Sirius come in, but he does hear him set something down and walk until he’s peering over Remus’s shoulder.
Narcissa huffs, “For the last time they are your
“Look. What works for me might not work for you, but happiness comes in all shapes and forms. The things I told you help, but there’s also flying your first broom; realizing someone important to you didn’t die and was just being a big idiot; having someone tell you you’re the son they’ve never had. Anything that makes you feel a little less lost, something that gives you a sense of who you are. Those are powerful emotions, Potter. Even if the memories aren’t completely happy.”
A swift kick in his gut keeps him from talking, a few good hits from Lucius keeps him from thinking too hard about things until blood from his ebony cut is dripping onto the floor. How much time passes, he’s never sure. But he knows days in here are out of the question, if he focuses hard on how good it will be to get back to Hogwarts he can almost ignore what’s happening to his body. The only thing Lucius

Then he has to go out and put lights up, begin chilling the wine, wash his hands again, finish food.
Everything’s a bit of a blur from there, Draco really can’t remember most of it and he starts to think that maybe he’s reached his threshold for shit he can go through before his mind snaps again. All he knows is one second he’s throwing a protection charm at Harry while clinging to a vicious branch that seems hell-bent on tossing him off the face of the Earth, and the next second he’s going down the same rabbit hole he watched Weasley be dragged off to. Harry lands on him seconds before he can yelp. Hermione tumbles in moments after they’ve stood up and once he’s repaired Harry’s glasses, he swears he going to charm them to never break again, they all look at each other and silently agree that today can’t possibly get any stranger, so why
the stupid thing. And then there’s a pretty tense moment where Draco’s a hundred percent sure he’s going to die, right before Lupin bursts into the room with LuLu hot on his heels.
“A loophole?” June asks, shoving chips in Howie’s face so he’ll shut up about the house.
“Since you answered so intelligently before, I believe you can understand why they’re so useless now.”
“Thanks, you’re great.” Draco mumbles. He doesn’t even complain when a pillow comes flying his way from across the room. Instead he curls around LuLu and tries to go the fuck back to sleep.

She doesn't say a word.
Lucius glares at him and suddenly he can’t speak anymore, like his air pipes are clogging. His father has him in some type of hold by his wand, he can’t even blink.
Dumbledore: let's talk about this
“It’s because we were worried about Draco!”
“1792.” Draco smiles. “Maybe they’ve gotten less dramatic since?”
“Yes?”
The fates must really have a grudge against him.
“Hi.” Harry smiles at him, all soft and lazy. “You don’t look like a zombie anymore.”
Harry, not having a clue what the fuck an oracle is: cool!
Harry wonders if he might regret this, but then Cedric is tossing his suit over the curtains and Pansy pulls out her wand. It’s remarkable what she can do in a few minutes. If she can change Hufflepuff yellow into a Hogwarts suit, complete with a giant fearsome beaver on the back and the Hogwarts’ chest over the heart in five minutes, Harry has no doubts that her Yule Ball dress is going to blow him away.
“Pensives are for memories, Draco, it might work if Potter had a two-way mirror, but I highly doubt he’d take one from
“But Dobby wishes to help Master Draco!”
Fleur’s room is neat as always, despite Gabbi being there for over an hour. If she’s anything like she was as a child she’ll have the place destroyed the second she wakes up. But he can worry about that later because right now he’s going to pull Fleur in for a long hug.
“Don’t worry about it, Harry.”
Harry huffs out a laugh because
“What is this?” Draco straightens his robes, “Are we having an intervention?”
No, not really.
“What the
Draco, just trying to get an O in Herbology: Why?
Most of them couldn’t move even if they wanted to, all paralyzed with fear because fur is starting to spout on Lupin’s back, but Draco’s pretty sure he isn’t doing this willingly. No one screams in pain when they’re willing. Harry tries to step around him and move towards the changing beast, but Draco can’t let him. He fights the boy back, somehow ending up the closest to the werewolf he can’t see standing behind him.
“Someone had to.”
He reminds himself that this is nothing. Draco’s faced worse. It’s not being chained to a dungeon and beaten by his own father. Worse things have happened.
So had Millie and Theo, and to be fair Pansy would have laughed too, so at least he had Fleur’s sympathetic smile to hold him until he managed to make it back to his room. And because Blaise is also weirdly sweet sometimes, he lit Draco’s favorite candle before going to bed so the room smelt like green apples and cinnamon.
Incredibly daunting to have a tour of a quarter of a house last for two hours. Harry got a glimpse at one of the five gardens, a general direction of the pool that’s off the left wing and past whatever the hell a billiard’s room is. He’s only seen all six of the ‘family sitting rooms’ because Lucius was in a meeting when they first arrived and Narcissa loves a chance to show off. He knows of at least two bar areas, that one of the wings is never used, and that the other one has ten bedrooms on it. Blaise and Pansy both said it was a Malfoy thing to be this rich, but in Harry’s opinion this is bordering on insanity.
and I want our anniversary to be about
Draco breathes out.
“Why are you doing this? Don’t you want to win?”
which means I’ll be stuck keeping Draco company, so you’ll be free to do whatever. All I need is someone to walk in with a matching suit.”
Harry: What do you mean LAV?!
Draco hits him.
The Slytherin team look to each other with wide eyes, Draco thinks they look uncomfortably close to frogs at the moment.
Harry: I'm fine
“I recall that you have a set yourself.”
“They’re amazing, Draco. I mean-Daph is helping anyone she can get her hands on and Astoria! She’s a bloody madwoman! It’s impressive as
One large pop later and Pansy is standing in the room with a woman that looks both alike and nothing like her. Katherine Parkisons’s hair isn’t quite as dark as her daughter’s but the slanted eyes and small full lips are very much Pansy.
“Because, you simpleton, the twenty-third through the twenty-seventh is prime Christmas time, we’ll be too busy celebrating that to celebrate us. The twenty-eighth is going to be a day of recovery from all the visiting, and the thirtieth is pre-new years, the thirty-first being new years
Her words don’t change the amused look growing on Draco’s face.
Next he has to creep up the stairs, peeking into the pink room where Ginny should be only to find it empty. A bit worried, he checks Ron’s room next, but there’s no sign of his best friend, so Harry sneaks a glance into the twins’ room.
hermione: you ABANDONED me?!
for underage practice.
Christmas day dawned and the loneliness got under his skin. This was, after all, the first time he hadn’t woken up to house elves singing Christmas carols and the smell of breakfast that would be waiting after presents. No hugs and kisses from mother, no loving looks from his parents, not even a cup of tea to wake to. Draco sat in his bed for a long time thinking about the past. Now, instead of hugging him and bestowing a gentleness no one would ever guess Lucius possessed, he was more likely to get a threat and a painful grip on his shoulder. Now, instead of his mother swooping down and squeezing the life out of him before ushering him to his place beside the fire, she would be more likely to owl him from Paris, if he should be so lucky. The surge of emotions hits him like a Bludger to the head and leaves him dizzy.
“Shut up.”
Harry laughs then, along with the rest of them. They all help get ready for dinner as they can’t really fit thirteen people at that small table inside. But outside there are two more redheads he hasn’t met yet, though he knows who they are thanks to Ron’s whispering.
“A full moon is coming soon, maybe one will eat this sorry excuse you call work,
“How do you do it?” Draco asks. He’s only beaten the ginger twice in their four games.
Sirius offered to take him in.
at Harry’s face and he’s angry all over again. No child should look this worn down. So sad, so tired, so defeated. There are bags under his eyes that rival Draco’s, his hands twitch constantly, hell he looks like Draco imaged himself looking when he was in Snape’s office only hours before. Anger is never a good emotion, it leads to people doing stupid things.
speak of this later.”
I do not speak french so if I messed up the translation I am SO sorry!!
That’s how he finds himself with Malfoy’s Kneazle glued to his side for the next few days. He keeps looking for answers to Hagrid’s problem, hanging out with his friends who eventually stop caring
Draco’s already snarling back before he can fully process the words, “

“You want to have Ron and Hermione over?”
“And then this year…he wouldn’t let you read your own mail, would he?”

She was declaring that he would be her lunch, and Fred bet twenty gallons that he wouldn’t die until the last task, so he can’t really do that yet.
“What should I do if he wakes up?”
“Oh it’s happening.”
“What happened to it?”
“Hey mate.” Ron’s head appears from behind him like a ghost appears from thin air. “You gave us quite the scare. Not as bad as you did Neville first year, huh?”
“Bullshit!” Ginny calls, and she’d be right.
Draco nods, kissing his mother once on her cheek, and then pulling Severus with him towards the darkening water.
That brings back Malfoy’s smile and a giddiness in Harry that outshines the confusion.

Lupin spares a glance at an angry Snape, wincing a bit before saying, “They decided to become animagi, so I wouldn’t have to spend the moons by myself.”

Harry looks like he’s about to ask what the fuck that means, but Dumbledore is in front of them with a strange, but happy, look.
Hi! MERRY CHRISTMAS! I've included a link to everyone's christmas present at the very bottom of the chapter!
A lie, a complete and utter lie, Harry had
Here, with his team smirking at him and thanking him for the brooms, he feels welcome. None of them know, or even care, about the Dark Lord. As they walk to the pitch he can feel the troubles melt away, talking about plays, exchanging gloats and other meaningless ticks that only Slytherins would get. It’s somewhat comforting, to be around his people, ones with brains, ones who don’t care about his name because he’s the youngest and most inexperienced of them all. A level of respect is there, sure, but not in the way Crabbe and Goyle mindlessly agree to everything, Flint actually snorts at one of his remarks. Being treated like a human being for once feels amazing, and it ends the second Oliver Wood comes flying towards them.
Pansy: I refuse to suffer pining shows alone
“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” Draco says, hoping that something was actually there, preferably notes so he wouldn’t have to invade privacy, or turn him in to Dumbledore.
fingers start moving through white hair too, and then playing with Blaise’s hand on top of LuLu’s stomach. He still hasn’t answered the question.
“Yes. I am, and what about it?” Is his response, challenging and strong, nothing like what he actually feels.
It was under Mrs. Daisy’s deceivingly warm smile that other shop keepers approached him.
to learn the tiny creature's name.
Severus stops by before noon, sneering at them all while handing Arthur his potions and berating Harry for opening the door.
Draco sighs, and then Sirius asks him the worst possible thing he could.
Draco rushes out of bed, running all the way down to the dining room with the newspaper in hand. He skirts right up to the head of the table and slaps it down in front of his father with his grin still pulling at the corners of his mouth.
His mind is too empty for that right now.
Hi! I have some exciting news, one of the fics I've been working on should be ready to post by the end of February. I'm nearly done with it, so as soon as it's completed I'm gonna post the newest chapter of this first and then post that for your viewing pleasure. I'm super excited about it, and I'll tell you all more about it when the time comes, but I have to say it's probably one of my favorite things I've ever written.
They take a moment to realize the gravity of the situation. Each staring at the floor, thoughts of devastation flooding their minds. And then they lock eyes and nod, Draco is sure to leave a note for his friends before following Snape out the door.
Her smile doesn’t budge an inch, if anything it widens. “I think you’re right. Do you agree Katherine?”
Draco leans down to pick the kitten up, then turns Misty around until she’s in his arms.
“Keeping your peers on their toes?”
“Not in the slightest!” Harry beams.
“Alright, alright.” Sirius puts his hands on his hips. In some weird, probably fucked up way, it reminds Harry of McGonagall. “Are the lot of you ready? We’ll give Kreecher a heart attack if we don’t let him deep clean today.”
“Really,” Pansy's saying, “Who knew it was even there.”
Draco: I am a responsible Perfect and all my Slytherins either fear or respect me
“Yes!”
“Mister Draco should be choosing the floor he likes best!”
“Lemon-drop?” Dumbledore offers, albeit sheepishly.
“Harry.”
In between his parents he’s untouchable. Nothing bad can ever happen to him. It doesn’t matter that he’s killed and refused to deal with
above them. The grounds keeper and his family…. Draco feels the urge to vomit, but then his father curses behind him.

anyone money like that!”
“Well, you’ve been in and out for about four days now-”
“Why?”
“I mean,” Draco looks to Severus, who nods, “I’m always happy to grow, but when would we start? How would we do it?”
Harry rolls his eyes, “That’s what I have
Draco lets her drag him along, mind still reeling as he pays for things he doesn’t look at, completely letting Misty take control of the situation.
Blaise grimaces, Pansy sighs.
He tunes back into the conversation before him, Potter standing on the dueling mat, glaring at Snape, and the beady black eyes smirking at him.
“Lead the way.”
He spends most of Divination thinking about how much simpler life would be if he could just be friends with whoever the hell he wanted to, and then he sees that Hufflepuff again and decides he really needs to ask
To put it simply, maybe Dumbledore was right. The document is really just pages upon pages that force him to do things he knows are healthy. Things that Snape had told him to do, that Dumbledore encouraged. Things like opening up to his friends, on his own terms, so that he doesn’t go crazy. Letting them know when he’s hurt, so that he
“Will you stop interrupting me for five seconds, or do you not care about the rest of the story?”
Blaise pulls him towards the bathrooms, “I save you from a panic attack and you insult me?”
Draco freezes, he can feel Pansy and Blaise stiffen on either side of him but Harry isn’t done.
“You underestimate her,” Ron tells him as they walk to the floo, “She once read five books in one night. That stack won’t take her a full day.”

“Well, since you’ve given me some back stories, let me return the favor.”
“Will you tell me your story? Or are you going to let me believe Sissy isn’t as sharp as she used to be.”
Black laughs in his face, so he quickly disarms him and
“Blood on Draco’s jumper?” Millie asks, taking the seat on his right. “Why is there always blood on your jumpers?”

Draco flushes and throws a ball of paper at her. “Don’t you have friends?!”
“Think of it as a revitalizing potion. It essentially gives you a few weeks of extra motive, energy, and endurance.”
you?” Pansy immediately starts the second he sits down for lunch. She blocks his left, Blaise on his right, Crabbe and Goyle in front of him. With nowhere to run, and barely any energy to spare, Draco sighs.
Hermione’s gasp takes him over another row, “Harry! You look stunning!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise elbows him, a plea to stop antagonizing a professor. Potter is the one to actually voice what his friend thinks.
Smart choice on their part.
“Good morning Master Draco!”
“I’m worried about the whole school, really, but my father knows about Granger….and he despises the Weasleys...really any of their little group could be a target. And we all know how Potter gets when his friends are in danger...”
harry's friends, being over protective:
the first chapter that doesn't require a TW, be proud and enjoy REGULAR drama for once! :)
He needs decorations.
In the glass, Potter took the tooth of the basilisk, unmoving behind him, sent a glare to Tom Riddle, and then stabbed the diary before him. To Snape’s and Draco’s shock, Riddle burst into light with every stab Potter gave. Glowing and glowing and bursting with light into utter nothingness. To their relief, as soon as the bright light faded, Ginny Weasley sat up and immediately rushed to help Potter. Fawkes joined them right before the glass faded into their own reflections, leaving Draco to fall into the headmaster’s chair.
“But is that really so bad? You clearly know more about business than I do.”
“I couldn’t have said it better myself.”
Lucius knows something is wrong even before he’s fully awake.
Pansy pouts, but they climb out and listen to her rave about the Gala on the way back to the Manor. Belle and Katherine both hug him goodbye,  Pansy and Blaise promise to see everyone tomorrow for their sessions, and then Draco’s left with a tired Theo, who needs a bath and to sleep.
“N-no idea,” Draco chokes out, “Must be LuLu, those things are bloody awful.”
Yeah, he kinda expected that. After all, Sirius can’t see his godson, so his cousin’s kid will have to suffice. Draco would be irritated if he could care.
Cedric, apparently, was the only one that
Draco takes the gift, his hands only shake a little bit, but no one has been able to give him something with the messes each year seemed to bring.
“Of course not.”
Hermione laughs, Ron doesn't look all that thrilled. “So, it’s like...you call Mrs. Zabini by her first name out of happy respect and the amount that you like her, but you don’t know Neville’s grandma enough to call her by her first name, which is why you call her Mrs. Longbottom, and you don’t care for the minister at all, which is why you call him Fudge?”
Look at you! You have no grace, you smell like garbage and your clothing isn’t much better! You
Draco spits out the name, fully intending for it to sound like an insult, but naturally the idiot smiles at him. “Maybe you should use yours,
“Annoying,” He continues loudly so that Potter will
Millie, to Draco: This is the shittest idea you've had yet
He listens to his father rant and rave, at some point Narcissa had to come down and threaten him within an inch of his life for a Fudge-free day.
There are several bite marks and bruises on Arthur, trailing on his neck and arms, from a clearly large snake with a large jaw.
“They really did a number on you, huh?”
“Great, we’ll do the ritual then.”

If he doesn’t get to Harry the boy could die.
“That’s because my project is simple, plus we have our presentations a day before you so you won’t be able to upstage me.”
“Celebrate what? I

October proved to put him in a happier mood the closer that Halloween got. His team did great, and Flit was exactly right about him being a great flyer. With only his team on the field, he could find and grab the Snitch in five minutes, and once he realized his father was probably just being a forgotten threat again, he found himself actually enjoying his studies. Pansy and Blaise kept him company in the library, and in the common room his teammates would sometimes stop by his table and join him in studying. Snape even complimented him for his good grades, albeit in a roundabout way, but a compliment all the same.
“Please don’t tell Pansy.”
Neville: I am not upset

Draco swats LuLu away from the marshmallows, putting her in his lap so she’s safer. “Okay?”
Classes passed one after another, and before he could blink twice his father’s owl was before him at lunch, a package attached. The whole thing caused quite the scene, but not as much as Draco’s pure, unfiltered smile at the Nimbus 2001 before him.

Don’t you find that a little ironic?”

Airs of mystery can bite his ass for all Draco cares. Unfortunately, Theo has him in a bind so he can’t voice this opinion, merely glare ever so slightly as his friend applies mascara and lip gloss.
Now he's fighting tears for no fucking reason other than
Things like destroying Aunt Bella, and taking her away from Narcissa. Him hurting Narcissa is enough to get him on Draco’s list, but then he’d cursed Lucius, like the torture wasn’t bad enough for his dad the frist time around. He killed Harry’s parents, he was the reason Hermione was bullied first year. He got Sirius stuck in Azkaban for nearly twelve years, he hadn’t just come after the wizarding world. He’s the reason Harry’s life is constantly in danger.
“I suppose they can come too….they
“I know.” Theo huffs out. He’s shaking all over, hanging his head so it rests on Draco’s chest. “I know….I couldn’t...we don’t have the stomach for that shit. Well, maybe Pans and Blaise could handle the murder but-but not the other stuff I just….Draco, we’ve missed you so much. You were always there. Ordering us around, even when we hated it we looked to you. You just...no one else did what you did. You looked after Vince when his mum died, Greg tells us all the time that you wouldn’t let him participate in the worst of it all, even if his father threatened you. No one’s ever gotten Pansy like you do, and Blaise...he’s never respected anyone like he respects you. We’ve been lost, Draco. We
Draco keeps his eyes on the sea.
Thanks to Lucius and Percy,
Draco does as instructed and follows Severus like a dutiful soldier marching off to war. Their footsteps echo like some sort of fucked up drums playing them to their death. They pause at the dungeon doors and even though Draco knows the paintings are watching, he still takes Severus’s hand.
Draco does not know, but the written exam for Herbology doesn't matter nearly as much as the
know.
And they’re back at it before either of them can say no.
Harry, with swim trunks: Bath? Swim?
“Can I have that?”
He’d be more comfortable if he were sitting on a chair instead of craning his neck from the floor.
Draco just shrugs, pulling Luna in with him and making a b-line for Fleur’s room. It’s on one of the highest levels because she’s a seventh-year and at the top of most of her classes, all the way to the right because Madam Maxiene knows she loves fresh light in the morning. Spoiled is what she is, and rightfully so, in his humble opinion.
Draco wants to beg to differ, wants to rant and rage and let Kingsley have a piece of his fucking mind, but he says nothing.
Granted he fucked that up a day later when Lucius caught him apologizing to the fairy he was forced to torture.
Apparently not the answer Dumbledore was expecting. Mind you, Draco himself can’t really believe he said it outloud.
Merlin this summer just got so much better.
did someone say two chapters in the same night? I wrote this once in about an hour so if it's shitty i'm so sorry but i'm gonna write the next one when i wake up so uhhhhh see you then? goodnight!
He has to wait for Vernon to sit down to drink his coffee.
Pansy rolls her eyes, but does take a second to pat her best friend on the head. “Well, you’re right. We can call this a late night segment.”
Draco snorts.
Class is relatively boring as far as first days go. There’s Care of Magical Creatures with Slytherins, but he can’t talk to Draco
“Just an accident at home is all,” He lied, taking their hands and trying to smile.
“You put it in the coco, didn’t you?”
“-Neither one of us will be aiming to kill.”
LuLu becomes an essential part of his life. He wakes up early and plays with her, studies with her by his side, watches his friends absently pet her during conversations. One day the two of them take a walk, and when they run into Lupin and LuLu rubs all over his tattered legs, Draco can’t help but smile. He does notice that as the weather grows cooler, no doubt a result of having so many Dementors nearby, she seeks out more warmth. Staying closer to people with body heat, or lounging in front of whatever fireplace Draco is by. Perhaps he would get her a little wardrobe of her own too, a collar for one, and at least five sweaters to match it.
It’s fine, he’ll be fine, he’s good at wandless magic, and if he dies...well, it would mean one less problem for a lot of people.
okay! I had no consent or opinion on that.”
“Correct me if I’m wrong, Professor, but did Harry Potter just defeat both a basilisk

“I...might have discovered the magic of caffeine, and given that I don’t sleep at night and still have classes, I’ve become extremely dependent on it. I’m beginning to worry Blaise and Pansy.”
That might have something to do with the way Narcissa’s magic has turned from violent to down right murderous.
defeated Voldemort again in first year.
The elf pauses from where he was about to begin his head smashing once more and smiles. Harry, on the other hand, is suddenly very confused and very tired. Maybe he
The first is the book on pureblood lineage from Lucius. He’d offered it casually, tucked a note on the inside of it, and told Harry to read it when he felt it was right. The second is the book Luna got him for Christmas last year, and the last is the photobook of his parents.
“Your mother will worry.”
As much as seeing Lockheart scurry out of the room made him happy, it didn’t last long. Not with screaming Mandrakes and Granger being an insufferable know it all. As she speaks Draco wonders how many OWLs she’ll have under her belt before she leaves Hogwarts. The usual limit was 12, the amount he planned on taking if he survived the next few years, but she would no doubt find a way to double it. How completely unfair.
he disappeared from glares at him.
Harry, a child: ...no?
he finds himself sitting on his and Ron’s bed, sharing sweets with the twins and Hermione while Ginny showers.
Draco’s face goes stone cold. “Watch your mouth, Potter. You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Draco shouldn’t have to suffer for his father’s mistakes, and Harry shouldn’t either.
Remus lives with Sirius.
Damn it. Damn Dumbledore. Damn the whole lot of them. Draco takes a sip, knowing there’s no other way out and he’s losing one of his best protection methods; lying. On the plus side, the two wizards stand on equal footing.
sorry i've been gone for so long, i had a lot happen in the span of two weeks and it kept pushing back my writing. my car started breaking down, papers before thanksgiving break happened, my work hours increased to 50, my dad got covid, i got a new car, my bath tub in my apartment fucked up, it's been a LOT and i'm so sorry but it's kinda reflected in the writing. i thought about putting it off for another week, but i didn't so if this chapter is sub-par i do apologize.
He has no fucking clue who Poly is, but he’ll worry about it later. Right now he’s going to do something insanely stupid.
“How long has he been out there?” A different voice whispers. Lighter, friendly, comforting. He knows the voices, if only he could place them.
a bad thing. A day inside with his friends doesn’t seem that bad, and really they’re not missing much. Care of Magical Creatures had been put on hold, and although he doesn’t know why, he does have a rather bad feeling about it.
Draco continues like he didn’t hear them at all, “Slytherins work in trades, okay? Carla, you cleared something in me that I didn’t know was blocked. Be it magic, emotional, or physical. I don’t know and I don’t care, but what I

“No! We’re bloody brilliant, actually, and excuse my language but holy
“The who?”
Draco, rooted to the floor all because someone put a suit on Harry.
Sirius chuckles at him, but nods all the same. He casts a glance at the three of them, “Do try to stay safe, I look forward to seeing you again someday.” And before Draco can ask what that means Buckbeak nods at him and flaps his wings up into the sky.
“Maybe, but levels nonetheless.” Draco waits for Hermione to give him her full attention too. “In my family, there are levels of closeness and respect. I call my parents mum and dad because I love them and to show respect, but in second and third year, dad was demoted to Lucius for the whole torture thing, you see? With parents it’s supposed to be ‘mum’ and ‘dad’ to show love and a close relationship. When ‘mum’ and ‘dad’ turn to ‘mother’ and ‘father’ it’s a sign of a relationship that is cordial at best, but not very close. When a child calls their parents by their first name, it’s a sign of hostility.”
“I did it!” The boy yells, almost bouncing with happiness. Draco himself is fighting a large smile. Lupin just grins, “You did! I’m very proud of you.”
“I went shopping too, got a few odds and ends for you, but you can’t see them until you’ve eaten.”
Draco clings to the rage, and for the first time ever, forces his mask down. He doesn’t let it slip, he shoves the stupid thing right on the ground, not giving a flying fuck if his friends are watching with slightly terrified expressions.
sirius, half awake: i'll kill you
“If Misty can do it I can too.”
His chin digs into Harry’s shoulder, breath tickling a bit. Harry just smiles. “Morgana is still upset that I brought Nagini and not her.”
and running around with a convict-”
June watches eagerly from her side, mouth half stuffed with a bagel. Draco doesn’t know what’s worse, her abhorrent table manners or Howie’s look of betrayal to his left.
Plus he’s so excited to see their faces when he casually performs an ancient ritual that was supposed to be forgotten years ago. Hermione will be thrilled then.
Beads of sweat trickle down his forehead, and where the hell is he?
(See the end of the chapter for
“You let someone enter the house?!”
“Away from here!” Lucius yells back, “Someplace we can use the portkey!”
He fights the urge to roll his eyes similar to the artificial eyeball that catches his attention. “I thought you were buying me a present?”
“Harry, now is
The Weasleys: hey can we go and see our dad who's apparently dying?
“No.”
“Of course silly,” Sirius scoffs, coming up to put a hand on his shoulder. “It’s like Remus and I keep saying, you’re in our care now, and we’ll do anything to make you happy.”
keeping him safe. And, if he stops to think about it, why the hell was he even thinking about Draco and his safety? Let him get hexed, that’s one less thing he has to worry about in Quidditch! The boy doesn’t even want to be his friend so why the hell is he so concerned about-
Snape’s hand comes into view, Hermione must be holding him down then. Pettigrew is no where to be seen. “Draco. Calm yourself or you’ll upset your wounds. Sirius will not let him get hurt, and I have three injured students and a real criminal on the loose. Lupin took his potions tonight, he will not kill even if his wolf wants him to.
“You. Insolent.
“Anyways, the reason why it’s such a big deal, besides the obvious I mean, is because in the last couple of hundred years humans have been real dicks to Mother Ocean,  just look at the amount of trash that’s polluting the waters. Obviously this isn’t good, but some merfolk are sympathetic to humans, some are not. King Rallam...is not. Well, he’s usually not on friendly terms with humans, and holds most of wizardkind in contempt for their similarities. So him not killing you, and then giving you his nickname as a show of friendship is a
to reach out to them. He was never serious about killing himself, so they never came rushing in during his ‘grounding sessions’, but he dreaded the day they did. He’d have to open up then, Potions test or not.
“Is that a threat?” Potter asks.
Draco stops talking when he sees the front of the day’s paper.
Draco couldn’t agree more. He almost thanks the man when the four people in front of him step away, but that's before he see Potter’s eyes widen and feels a firm hand digging into his collarbone.
“The what now?”
He’s fully prepared to launch a Crucio at the first tuff of blonde hair he sees, and then his mother laughs. It’s a little breathless and has just a bit of a crazed tone, but it’s still laughter.
“No ‘buts’ Draco.”
Hagrid grabs the beast by its neck, and suddenly Draco feels a little light headed. There’s a lot of blood everywhere, dripping through his fingers and staining his robes. Blaise looks horrified, and even Potter and crew look a little concerned. Someone hoists him up in big arms, to his right he vaguely hears Granger say “He needs Madam Pomfrey!” and is suddenly very thankful to have her in this class.
Draco shakes his head. Hard for the bad people to take you if you-
harry, after seeing sirius angry: my godfathers are terrifying and i love them
They go back to working in a comfortable silence, but there is a new heavy weight on Draco’s chest. On the plus side, now he knows for certain that he’s not the only one worried grey about the sleeping boy in front of them.
I don’t care what the consequences are, if they kill me it doesn't matter as long as I’m not
“I was, but Astoria Greengrass wants to use me to make a point. She’s a lesbian, Pans, I promise we’ll end up dancing before the night is done so please don’t make that pout at me when I’ve only just woken up.”
He has one last room to inspect before he can return to his own room. It’s at the end of the halway, the brown room that Harry’s never liked. The lights are still on, and as he creeps closer, he hears several voices talking.
“Most answers
“Great. Second thing is, well it’s a big one. Remus and I talked a lot about it last year, and if you’d like, we can adopt you.”

“You will count.” Aunt Petunia says, voice like she’s merely commenting on the weather.
Both Gryffindors were speaking but he was too busy peeking into a blank book when suddenly it flew out of his hand and into Weasley’s.
Draco tries to recall the few times his flames came out to play.
Now that he’s mentioning it, Harry has seen the same shirt on every elf he’s encountered in this ridiculous house.
I adore slytherin friendships
Hermione: Wait-
They don’t talk until they’re inside Harry’s bathroom and he finds himself shaking in his boyfriend’s arms.
Sorry for the late update! I'm on vacation, and time is a nonexistent concept right now. Anyways, this is a bit of a short chapter because it's been a while since I had a cliff hanger and I've been wanting one, sorry!
Howie tilts his head to the side. “Is that what I did?”
“Yes! Anything!”
Merlin, he’s never loved Molly and Arthur more than he does right now.
His own room has the same ceiling to floor windows, the same silky white sheets, as many pillows as he wants in his king bed.
Draco honestly feels like sobbing too.
Lupin raises an eyebrow, “All I see is a paper with a sense of humor. Ah! It has one more message for you, should I read it aloud for the class?”
And just like that, he’s gone. Leaving Draco almost completely alone with the sea.

Harry takes a second to really look at his arm, Blaise’s wonder-filled face, and Draco’s tired one. Then he looks down and says, “Um, he kinda made me drink his blood?”
Eventually Theo just sighs and holds his hands up. “Alright, alright. Wind blown look it is.”
His thoughts were cut off when he hears a small buzzing by his left ear. Potter is looking at him a little differently than normal, which meant either he had shouted what he wanted-or the Snitch was by him. Draco turned his head the exact second something whirled past him and right into Potter. That captured all his attention, thoughts of the Snitch replaced by Potter’s arm hanging limp by his side, not comforting by any standards, even less so with the boy rushing towards him.
The air in the room filters out around his mother’s silence. And then she sighs.
Sirius smiles gently and Draco almost drops his wand. No one with a smile like that could be a cold blooded murderer. “ ‘s okay.”

“Oh Dearie.” Mrs. Daisy sighs, “That’s completely normal for women over thirty.”

Eventually the man grumbles something, heads to the back, and reappears with a slim purple box.

worrying me sick?!” Pansy throws her arms around his neck. That part isn’t all surprising, but Hermione grabbing his face so she can inspect his face is.
“Don’t worry,” Draco mumbles to them, watching himself get snarled at, “It only gets worse from here.”
snape: we're sending umbitch to azkaban
Narcissa rolls her eyes, taking another sip of tea before recrossing her legs. “We have more important things to discuss than me killing your father.”
“Okay.” Harry nods back, and then takes stock of his situation. Second night in and he’s already causing trouble. Not just for Sirius and Remus but his friends too.
“You won’t be saying that when I tell you how much I need.”
Draco wakes up with something warm beside him, he’s so comfortable, and he can hear running water so he should probably get up if Blaise is already in the shower. He opens one eye, expecting to find LuLu curled up next to him, but instead he finds himself face to face with a mop of black hair and a snoring Harry.
Draco shrugs, “I tell her everything.”
“Good. What Lucius has done is unforgivable, I’m ashamed to let it get this far, but…. Well. Allow me to start from the beginning.”
“I promise.”
“Last one.” Aunt Petunia says softly, calmly.
“Would you like to come serve me?”
He’s met with five heads nodding in agreement, even though he really only looks at Draco. A flash of movement later and the three Gryffindors are disappearing through an open door, leaving the three Slytherins to gather their things and make their way to the landing.
Surely you know our backstories?!”

They say goodbye to Salem, and two seconds later Draco finds himself in the middle of a busy wizard’s street.
“Goodnight.”
“It’s dragons.’ Harry whispers the second Cedric is close enough.
“Theo...are you

“You’re lucky Lupin was there to intercept you, you know it’s not safe to wonder about the school at night.”
Once again shocking Draco, Lucius snorts. Actually, honest to Merlin, snorts, like it’s normal to help his son save his enemy and then laugh about it in the middle of the woods with Death Eaters nearby. He almost busts into insane giggles, and then Lucius straightens, eyes going above their heads and out into the distance.
He gets the feeling that this is going to a common occurrence in his new life. “What is it?”
the lights hang in the sky despite it being night, see the way trees glow, feel the softness of the grass on his skin, the rush of flight, the security of hanging in a purple-flower nest.
“Now,
Harry takes a step back, and then another, one more, and a final one until he’s no longer within listening distance. He doesn’t want to hear about an attack right now.
“We think it’s cool!” Fred chimes in. Pansy glares at him.
He was almost
He shoots the disappearing elf a smile and Harry watches the cold look Malfoy usually wears fall into place before he opens the door and Lucius Malfoy strides in.
Mister Draco is being
Geia, out in the forest by a burning marble home, not sensing life, not smelling anything but ash and smoke. Something covers her face, snaps against her neck. He feels a burn on his back that’s so painful it makes him wither, and then the burn spreads and he collapses on the pillow.
Misty watches him with wide eyes, not taking the cup at all, so Draco gently grabs her hand and forces the cup into her fingers.
Draco, a horny teenager: I'm too posh to snog my boyfriend in the middle of a crowd
“A little too spicy for my tastes.”
The water that splashes across his face is freezing in comparison with the room he was in.
Instead he finds himself shaking in a flower shop, Misty dragging him all over the place.
Hermione, confused and slightly frightened: how do you know about muggle religions?
He wasn’t expecting his outer friends to give him gifts.
“Please, Mrs. Malfoy, call me Harry. And don’t worry, that includes you Sirius. I totally have the dragon issue covered.”
“LuLu!”
but also WARNING for the bit of cannon tragic Harry backstory. It's not really a main focus, more mentioned briefly but still just in case, ya know?

Picking up the pace once more, Draco almost runs smack into a house elf he knows to be Mr. Crouch’s. He has to stop then, just so he won’t trip and he’d like to tell her to watch where she’s fucking going but Harry cuts him off.
“Are you implying that Professor Lupin is being a coward?”
Literally.
“What she means to say,” Draco sighs. “Is would anyone fancy a history lesson before bed?”
“Don’t we have something more important to talk about?!” Ron whines and because he probably won’t get a better segway, Harry snatches this one.

He wonders if her previous owners ever hugged her.

He shrugs, “Couldn’t be bothered to ruin my perfectly good day.”
Except, it’s the first day of December and that can only mean-
Katheriene frowns, but her and Lucius share a look that ends in them both shrugging so Harry hopes there’s a general agreement
out of his ass and save the day, doubles over and laughs.
“Are we in trouble again?” Draco asks. He’s assuming they’re not going to be secretly served Veritaserum considering that they’re all in workout clothes, but then again, he wouldn’t put it past his mother to sprinkle the stupid potion into their yard fertilizer.
“It’s better than that. I learned how to
Draco rolls his eyes at her antics, making his way back to the living room and reaching into his bag for clothes that
Because honesty seems to be working for him lately, Draco starts to tell Theo just that.
“He’s told me the usual, hate Potter, please the Dark Lord. Apparently, at some point You-Know-Who was merely a student called ‘Tom Riddle’, father’s been particularly obsessed with getting a diary of his. Say’s it holds some of his power, although I’m not sure how much or if it even exists. He got some ratty old book, but there was nothing written in it. I went looking for it but apparently he sold it to Mr. Borgin as a part of our family cleanse. Although, he did mention the Chamber of Secrets….”
“Harry? Are you okay.”
Practical exam, so he hangs onto Theo’s every word for dear life.
“Serpensortia!” Draco yells. The snake he’d summoned was one of his favorites, Polytimoes, a thin but long black snake who looked at him like they were sharing a secret before the screams started. Poly rose, ready to strike whatever danger came towards him, he almost felt the snake was glaring at his appointment.
“Ron!” Hermione whispers, “Not in front of-”
Draco keeps his mouth shut. Arms cross, his eyes stare anywhere but Potter. He would walk away if he trusted the other not to do something stupid like follow him or get attacked the second he was left alone. Potter, apparently, does not like his response.
“You lie to your mom all the time!”
They go upstairs, leaving Remus and Kreecher to figure out dinner. All in all there are ten rooms for him to choose from. The first is all rose pink and pistachio green, the bed is too big and has way too many pillows so he skips it. Second is the brown room, and it reminds him way too much of the Dursleys living room. He closes that door in two seconds and thanks Godric above that Sirius doesn’t ask questions. Next is the crème bedroom, way too bright and reminds him a bit of Aunt Marge if he’s honest, so that’s another no.
“This is new.”
“M-Mr. Weasley.”
“Helga...her name is Helga….do you think this is a fucking joke Roland? It doesn’t matter if you give Dragons
And food, plus the means to cook said food, which warrants another trip to the store.
something he doesn’t mind admitting at all, “Yes, sir. Professor Lupin asked me to stop by his office after dinner.”
Striking green eyes peer into his soul, as if telling him they will accept nothing but the truth. Draco can’t lie to those eyes, and he can’t fathom why, so he looks away.
“Oh absolutely.”
part is that Draco is safe and that Mrs. Malfoy is on our side. She’s recruiting people to fight with us if it comes to it so we, you know, children, won’t have to do all the heavy lifting. It means someone who’s been exposed to everything awful the world has can still be good, which is something we need.”
Carla frowns, “Try a Pensive, love.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where’s Lupin?” He asked, the first in the room like always. Snape doesn’t answer, another strange occurrence.
there? He could just be a figment of my imagination, like a weird twisted guilt for leaving the castle, which wasn’t smart because how am I supposed to protect him if I’m not near him, and it’s not like I can just blink and be back here when I’m at Hogsmeade, and that’s why I can’t figure out how the hell Black is getting in and why he hasn’t just killed Harry yet, like he’s had
best friends and I distinctly remember a saying about friends being more important than partners.”
Harry has a weird urge to hug her. His arms would never fit around her neck, she’s way too big for it anyways, but he still reaches out and pats her nose.
Draco nearly trips over the same pile of skulls they always forget to clean up. “Excuse me?!”
Draco gives her a look, but she’s not necessarily wrong. “Sure.”
Either way, he shrugs and opens the book to find it blank.

Draco and Ron are a few feet away from the girls, playing Wizard’s Chest with his mother’s antique board.
At night it was everything a person never knew they needed.

“Mister Draco is being so kind!”
There’s no telling with Sirius, he’d either go straight to murder or at least give the lot of them a very through beating. Remus seems more the type to destroy their self confidence.
So Draco goes bounding to them, running smack into Hermione who screams, and then hugs the air out of him the second she realizes who it is.
of restraint to keep from swallowing the rest of his drink right there.
Draco looks up from his mac and cheese, thankful once again for the seats between him and the others.
No-Potter! Absolutely not! Do you have brain cells left in that big head of yours?! Let me spell it out for you! I. Am. A.

Potter was being, he would. As soon as he checked to make sure it wasn’t the diary.
“You’ve been quizzing me on History facts so much it hurts. I’m going to bed now, are you coming or staying until I have to drag you?” Blaise sounds like he’s two seconds from falling over, so Draco nods.
What their little argument results in is Draco magically forced to stand still while Theo covers his scars and his Dark Mark in magical makeup that managed to wipe the entire slate clean. Or that’s his understanding until Theo leaves the scar on his face alone.
“Come on, sleeping beauty, we all need to go to bed. Can’t fail that Herbology test in the morning.”
Father Weasley runs to them, gathering up his children in his arms and doing a quick count of them.
Harry raises an eyebrow, Hermione just sighs along with the rest of them.
Crabbe jumps up at that, whoever Goyle is rushes to grab him. Good call on his part.
I am going to
“Would Master Draco like Winky to fill it out?”
Draco finds himself falling into a routine of sorts.
What the fuck?
That Harry has no problem hearing, or laughing at that. “Draco, my gang once brewed Polyjuice Potion in a girl’s bathroom, I’m fairly good at not getting caught.”
As a matter of fact, he’s been purposefully lying in his letters to his mother, he hadn’t written one to his father since the beginning of last year. Draco glares before he can stop himself. “Have you
“Someone tell me what the
Like most things lately, his plan doesn’t work out.
That draws a snort out of Draco. Off hand he knows most the languages Blaise knows, all the pure bloods learn the basics. English, French, Italian, Spanish and German. Some of them went further, he and Pansy both know Latin and Portuguese. Some of his cousins know Japanese and Chinese, Hebrew and Korean. When your family has businesses and relatives all over the world you just pick up on things. Language and etiquette was just a part of life. Or it had been before he turned eleven.
“You think Geia could help?”
Gabrielle stirs a bit at the sound of her name, blinking up to look at Luna a little confused.
Fleur finally looks him in the eye and oh fuck,

And he
Ron goes next, “He had to write to us for food at the beginning of the summer.”
There’s at least fifty Monsteras in the window alone, and Misty told him during his first week that it was her favorite.
Pansy’s hand comes to rest on his own, warm and grounding. “Yes, but what about the monster? Surely it’s not safe.”

Pansy, after kissing Hermione: oh god
“Mister Draco should be making a list!”
He turns back to Draco with a scowl, “Is that you either come willingly or I will contact Misty to help me with your kidnapping.”
And that feeling fills him up. Makes him powerful, makes him dangerous. It leaves him burning brighter than Draco’s fire, more dangerous than Sirius in the dark, and certainly more capable than Tom Riddle.
Okay, so he seriously needs to have an in depth conversation with Charlie when this is all over. Stealing children is never an okay thing to do, dragon or not.
Really? But the pruning-no. Nevermind, that’s not the point. The
Draco struggles to catch his breath, “It’s like I have a clone.”
House elves come and go. The first day they leave fruit and plates of his favorite foods. They urge him to eat, urge him to shower, urge him to sleep.
Theo laughs a bit at Draco’s bitter tone. “A trade then. I help you with your stack, you go clubbing with me on Friday
Misty quietly pulls him out of the room. “We be working on the lab tomorrow.”
Granted, she fucking should be because he’s spent the better part of the last month and a half working on this stupid little thing.
“Severus!” She gasps, narrowing her eyes at Draco, who nods in return. Before he can think of an excuse, Snape is calmly explaining.
“But I don’t
Hating Malfoy had been a part of him since first year, but how could he hate him when he knew more now? He had seen his face in the infirmary...that wasn’t something someone could fake. LuLu liking him makes more sense than he can share with his friends right now. He can’t, not until he has all the facts, which he won’t have until Malfoy decides to share with him, and who knows when that would be.
Crookshanks snorts at him, but LuLu returns to his side, gazing up at him with the bluest eyes and sweetest pur. Harry all but melts on the spot.
emmy, with a knife: let's rip umbridge's heart out!
“Sorry, um.”
“We? Who is this we, Potter?”
He’s been pouring himself into this for
Which left him with the weird feeling while he was writing to his friends and mentors. For some unknown reason, he had started writing one to Harry bloody Potter. He didn’t send it, of course, that would be preposterous. But by Merlin did he write one, a full page going on about how he wished the boy would be safer, that he’s too important to die so young, that people- Draco- needed him to survive. That people were watching over him, caring for him, and wishing every damn day for his safety.
It was raining outside, and Mrs. Zabini was ending another relationship so there was a lot of yelling during his and Blaise’s playdate. Blaise had been in a
But, upon his arrival to the Malfoy Manor there is no fan-fare, except from Winky who hugs his knees and scolds him for making Draco worry.
Merlin, this is
Misty said you died, and that you-”
Oh shit.
Harry looks at him with wide eyes, there’s fear in them, but also a weird amount of respect.
The small thing withers and screams, crying out and begging for mercy. After the third scream, as if it had been a cue, he hears the curse repeated behind him and his body spasms out of control.
Draco turns around on one foot, “But you
That and it was time for his afternoon session with the Cruciatus Curse. And the matching dagger that left a ghastly gash across his forearm.
Draco’s eyebrows skyrocket. He’s even more confused when Mrs. Daisy starts smiling. “OH! Theodore, that’s such a lovely idea! Draco here wouldn’t come out of the house at all if his friends didn’t make him! Why, a night out on the town could be
“You bloody hell will not!” Draco meets Harry’s glare with one of his own. “You’ve already almost died once tonight, and I can’t imagine you know any of the rules that come with time traveling-”
it’s not funny! I’ll have you know that I’d be dead if it weren’t for Misty!”
Not that his social standing stopped anyone from approaching him with shop-related issues.

“No,” Pansy says, all wide eyes and creepy grin. “I just can’t believe you got a date
Draco shrugs. “Is it?”
Really! His mother could be dying, no one knows what the

Malfoy gives him a wry smile, “Nothing we both haven’t dealt with before. I’ll be alright. I would invite you to check on me freely, but I can’t risk your safety for that.”

and some ivy that makes some semblance of sense. Really, what is it with muggles and their need to name innocent, non lethal plants such condemning names?
“Hello.” He tries, like he’s not bound to a chair by cushy velvet ropes, courtesy of Narcissa. “I bet you’re wondering why I’ve been gone…”
Mr. Crouch walks through the children, giving Draco a glare that would rattle him if he wasn’t, well,
Next to him LuLu purrs, nuzzling her little white head into his thigh like she’s relieved to be back too.
…..the boy looks into his tea and weighs his options. On the one side, he probably did need to talk about everything that happened this summer. He couldn’t do that with Pansy and Blaise, they would be murderous and refuse to leave him alone for longer than two seconds. He couldn’t tell Dumbledore, Merlin knows it wouldn’t
Draco nearly flinches at the question. A month ago he was asking the same thing, tucked away in his cell, surrounded by hoodies figures and manic laughter, begging anyone, even the devil himself for something to drink. His throat had been so dry, he’d never wanted anything like he wanted water in his cell. And here he is, denying the first glass that’s being offered to him.
Draco: fuck it's working
Sometimes Harry really thinks he’s been cursed in life.
Hermione’s eyebrows furrow. Draco wants to ask him what the hell he’s on about, but then he catches a glimpse of Aurors out of the corner of his eye.

Draco gets a sinking feeling in his chest, he knows what comes next.
Draco was planning on going to bed

“It’s beautiful, don’t you think.”
Snape suddenly has murder in his eyes and Draco almost nods in approval before smirking his nastiest smirk.
“And you don’t have the right to paint me as some incapable git!
“Well,” Harry grins at him, “It certainly smells better up here.”
Clmex! Adiuva me! Noli ridens, hoc est non ridiculam!: Assholes! Help me out! Stop laughing, this isn't funny!
Draco looks between the two of them, both hopeful and nervous at the same time. On the one hand, if he did tell them everything there would be hell to pay. Sure, he trusted them with his life and all, but he knows how Slytherins are. More than that, he knows purebloods. They would do anything for their own gain, including cross him. But….he also knows that family means everything to them, and he was considered family. Family broke rules for each other, family always comes first.
It’s the ‘please’ that breaks him. His mother doesn’t beg, he hasn’t heard her say please except to her elders, and yet here she is…

Blood rushes to his cheeks because

Kingsley sits next to him, the smell of the ocean mixes with sandalwood.
Draco smiles down at Sisily, handing his coat to Winky “You got Geia taken care of, right? Food supplies and direct line to Harry?”
“And…” Blaise shakes his head, but he’s smiling, “That Buckbeak creature Draco’s been on about all week. Dumbledore did say ‘lives’ right?”
He hands his broken wand over to a wide eyed and wary Kingsley.
----------
A blast of silver hits him before he can think about dogeing, and suddenly he can’t stop laughing.
Oh, Draco’s about to fucking show her fire.
Geia makes a noise that suspiciously sounds like a laugh.
Draco cannot sleep.
“Give me Scabbers. I promise not to hurt your rat, but you’re going to have to trust me.”
And then he shows them all his project because it’s fucking cool and he can’t wait to slip it into Harry’s pocket before the next task.
And okay, Draco knows he has a type by now. For Merlin’s sake, he figured that out when he was fourteen and watching Victor Krum climb out of a frozen lake in a conveniently tight suit. He’s never had an aversion to women, partly because his most looming goal for the longest time was either not dying or, when he turned sixteen, figuring out how the hell he was going to produce an heir with a girl who didn’t necessarily like him.
He can barely contain his anger, shaking at the thought that his father was the person behind all this, if someone died, it would be his father’s fault. It blinds him with rage.
If a few tears leak out, Misty is kind enough not to say anything.
“You’ve gotten me a new wardrobe! This day was meant for Harry!”
“He’s dealing. It’s hard for him to accept she’s gone, even worse...he screams sometimes in his sleep.”
Snape glares and Dumbledore doesn’t do much but let the corners of his mouth twitch ever so slightly. The headmaster had scarred most of the school with his rage, shooting spells at the beats, sending them running within a minute. Draco would have been terrified of the man next to him if he hadn’t wanted to use a few Unforgivables on them himself. In truth, he had stayed as his friends and the rest ran, frozen in the stands with his eyes trained on Potter to catch the rise and fall of his chest. He had watched in the freezing rain as Potter was carried off to the school, his friends and team behind him, and had been there when Cedric argued that he didn’t deserve the win, that he wouldn’t take it with how badly Potter had gotten hurt. Draco had stayed until Snape found him and told him Potter was fine, that he hadn’t even broken his glasses, and only then did he breathe.
“Speaking of kindness, Dumbledore has told me he wants you to learn how to fight off Dementors, I was thinking of a ‘special project’ as a cover? Would that work for you?”
“Ah, like charades.”
“Cool?!” Draco struggles to catch up to him, the little bastard is already at the bathroom entrance. “How is that cool? How is that

For some weird reason, Draco’s throat can’t dignify Harry with an answer. Personally he thinks the sob Hermione muffles against Weasley’s chest is more than enough.

“You’re all prats, but we’re saving a life here, so let’s make this as painless as possible.”
“I know you're scared of the beast in the Chamber, and you should be, but we are of pure blood, it will not harm you.”
“Sirius-”
Needless to say, he hadn’t expected to follow the boy to the Astronomy tower, or for him to lock the door and whisper “You can come out now”.
“There’s no way of knowing with the Dark Lord, Headmaster, he could very well possess a student before it’s all said and done.”
“What? I have the money for it.”
blaise: lulu and i are the best of friends, no one has ever loved like we love, she is the best cat in the whole world and i would die for her
1) From the beginning, in the fic that started it all, when Lucius realizes he hit Draco he freezes and immediately pulls the boy into his arms and says "I am sorry, Draco, I don’t know what’s come over me", trying to explain that his mark is being weird. SPOIL ALERT there's a reason for that. He also makes it very clear that he thinks his son deserves the world, to the point that he's willing to stick his neck out to make sure Draco is in good graces with Voldy when he returns, so from the first chapter of the first fic we know that Lucius Loves His Son, even after he loses it, he sends Dobby to check on him, why? because he's been there, and is scared. Wouldn't you be scared if some evil maniac could possibly return and kill the people you love if they weren't ready for it? Narcissa has managed before, but Draco is just a boy.
Sirius sputters, he can feel Remus breaking down beside him. Narcissa snorts.
“I had to stay in the hospital wing for a few days, the cut was strangely deep.”
“Theo-”
For a moment Harry thinks she is actually going to bow to the others, but she just turns her full glare on him. “This better be good.”
“If you hadn’t slept on the floor beneath them you wouldn’t be having this problem, Ron.”
“I think not, Miss Parkinson.” The trio turns to see Snape looming over them, eyebrow raised and sneer in place, “You’ll have to conduct your activities without Mr. Malfoy, as he will be coming with

Draco inhales sharply, then tries to make it look like he’s just breathing and not about to have a full blown panic. Instead of flying off the broomstick, he leans into the desk behind him and crosses his arms, this way he’s grounded. The warmth from his palms flood his arms, the sharp edge of the desk snaps him back to reality. He has to keep this hidden. No matter what he could not be exposed.

One foot leads to another, he’s practically sprinting down the hall, but stops dead in his tracks at the sight of two old men, a frightening figure walking between them.
Aunt Petunia smirks. “Excuse me?”

His personal confusion on the matter doesn’t prevent piles from appearing before them, probably due to Winky and Kreecher.
They reluctantly agree.

And then the air around his boyfriend’s feet starts to cackle and he’s marching forward. The Slytherins take one look behind them, one of them offers a ‘well, I suppose if you weren’t dead before you most certainly are now’ before jumping out of the line of fire.
“My business got put on hold the second I saw my friend that’s supposedly dead.”
He quickly shoves one of the bags into a shaken Theo’s arms, grabs his briefcase off the floor, and steers him out of Mrs. Daisy’s shop so they can aparate back to the cottage.
Pansy backs off a little, even helps him sit up so Blaise can engulf him in a bone crushing hug. “You had blood dripping down the hallways when you came in. Gave us quite the heart attack, Pans nearly passed out, we didn’t know what happened. One second we were running around with our wrists burning and then you were in Snape’s arms, passed out and…”
“No.”

and it’s not because he’s a little jealous or whatever, it’s just, ya know, unsanitary.
And Misty will be being hurt without Mister Draco, evil mark or not.”
Not the question he was expecting but that’s fine by Draco. He can almost feel his father cluing in behind him.

It was probably Blasie.

Draco choses that moment to burst open the doors, like Harry’s heart isn’t stuck in his throat, like he’s not having a crisis at the warmth flooding through his chest. But it’s fine. He can totally get through a glass of hot chocolate without crying.
Theo finds him the next morning when he’s reading. Sunlight streams through the curtains in his little canopy out in the back, blanketing him in an early morning glow. The ocean is calm today. Breezes drape over his shoulder, lazily sending the smell of the sea to mix with his morning coffee.
“Nope. I already have a date, and for the record, this is exactly what I meant when I said you procrastinate too much.”
“Yer, um, yer supposed to
Blaise gives him a warm smile, “We’ll owl you constantly, you won’t miss us that much.”
“Tell me, Professor,” he lowers his voice, “Tell me that insufferable git isn’t really the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. He’s a show pony at best, one of the girls will probably jump him before break. Not to mention that a half-wit has more of a brain than he can hope for.”
She turns on Theo, that sharp glare Draco hasn’t seen in
“Careful, Potter, there’s a Dementor behind you.”
Sirius screams.
Curly brown hair, bright honey eyes, clad in a pale grey business suit and a salmon tie, and standing at a solid 5 feet and 9 inches is Theodore Nott.
For starters, Lucius wouldn’t dare hurt him. The Dementors would be under lock and key. Draco could eat a normal dinner again. And his
Dobby is an excellent subject matter in the case of loyalty. By all measures, he should be bound to Lucius, forced to do his bidding and take to Draco and his mother separately. And yet countless times he has gone against his father’s rules for one, if not both, of them. Something about kindness being better than intolerance is in that, but Draco prefers to chalk it up to simple luck. Pure things like ‘kindness’ and ‘gentleness’ were something Draco hadn’t had since he was a child. He couldn’t have them now, not with the path he’d signed up for.
“You didn’t pass out on the train...everyone passes out their first Dementor attack..”
later and his stag appears. For some weird reason, the others look at him funny. Oh well, he can worry about that later.
He regrets not reading more of the barely legible notes.
“What the hell are you doing with that
Back when the Dark Lord was a thing of the past, when their biggest worry was a wayward Auror that seemed to hate them more than anyone else. They’d spent so many nights in the library, he and Blaise listening to every word she said. Trying it out on their beds, their trunks, even their sides of the room.
“Alright, fine. I’ll calm down with the hexing, but if you think this means I’m going to start being nice….”
“In bed.” Remus hands him and Draco a mug, ruffling each of their hairs just because he can. “We put the boys in the brown room and gave the girls Narcissa’s pink room for the evening. But nevermind that, how are you feeling?”
Of course, because Draco stayed, Theo stayed, saying he didn’t want to be left at the Malfoy Manor by himself all break. That led to Blaise and Pansy staying over, and really, the Black Manor is big, but Harry has no idea how they’ve managed to fit so many people.
“Cheers.”
“Elves be having big ears for a
“The twins?” George asks.
Potter had just found out that Sirius Black had once been his father’s best friend. Draco’s suddenly glad to be going home for break.
From what he knows about Sirius Black, this is a very big problem indeed.Everyone in the wizarding world knows about the traitor. He was the Potter’s friend, thick as thieves, closer than brothers with James, the man had been at their wedding, in school he had been apart of their group, his father hated every single one of them, constantly talking about how shameful it was for a Black to be sorted into Gryffindor, Sirius Black had been to the Potters what Pansy and Blaise are becoming to him.
He’s having this wonderful dream about sunbathing in a pool with his friends, and then Winky shows up and starts calling his name, which he doesn’t mind because he quite likes his elf and she usually has good thoughts, so whatever she’s trying to bring to the party Draco will probably be down with-
“We’ve seen him with bruises-”
He forgot to clean Vernon’s coffee from this morning.
“I have lunch in a few hours with some friends, I can’t miss it or they’ll hunt me down and smother me.”

Draco flinches at the tone, harsh and cold, just like- a hand caresses his cheek and pulls him away from his nightmares.

And the next day Hermione sends out their end of the year study schedules, he has no idea what the final task will be, and he’s busy with living life in the present, so Harry makes a promise.
“It’s been a very long day. This morning feels like it was years ago.”
“For Merlin’s sake! I’ve never poisoned anyone!” Theo gives him a look. “Unintentionally, I’ve never poisoned someone unintentionally.”
Sure enough, whatever it is gets thrown on his face and brings him back to the Memory world of Consciousness.
Is that where you want to be?!”
For starters, Harry wakes up to breath on his neck, a hand clutching at his stomach, and a warm weight behind him.
Riddle turns with beady red eyes and a smile that sends chills down Harry’s spine.
“From the wand shop?”

Sirius lets out a long sigh, “You’re right, I can’t see either of them anywhere but that stupid little cottage.”
just teenage drama, a lot of kissing, honestly this is arguably the softest chapter i've ever written
Misty is not happy that he’s brought a guest unannounced.
Draco snorts in spite of himself, “Yeah that sounds like good old dad.”
Draco pales at first, but quickly begins his bragging, tucking the letter tightly in his pocket and coming up with some excuse he half remembers. He needs to get to Dumbledore and Snape.
Lucius stands, idly brushing invisible lint off his smaller arm, “Not that it matters anymore, of course. Percy and I ensured Sirius’s freedom, and I doubt you’ll get the chance to look over the papers at the rate you’re going so I’ll summarize clause 1 of section 3; upon signing, the only people who have any remote control over Harry are Sirius, Remus, and whoever they entrust to look after him.” Lucius raises a single blonde eyebrow, “So, not you.”
Regardless of whether or not she sees him on Monday, Carla will send a Patronus to him on Tuesday so the two of them, and June, can meet for lunch. That usually leads to a potions lessons for June, or a stupid debate with Carla that Draco pretends to hate. Sometimes Howie or Mrs. Daisy will join them, there was even one time that Mrs. Alice sat with them through tea and finger cakes.
“Harry!” Lavender and that one Parvati chick whisper, “Remember your tea leaves!”
His accomplice gives him a questioning face ruined with concern, but nods all the same. “Master-”
And although Snape had always seemed at least somewhat the sanest of them all, he was almost ecstatic at the idea. Although, Draco has a very big feeling that was probably because of how livid he had been when he found out about the abuse...his ears rang until dinner form the lecture.
Weasley grins at Harry’s protests. “Looks like you’re outnumbered, mate.”
Draco whirls on him. “
“It won’t affect anything if you say no. You’ll still live here, nothing Remus said would change, we just. Well, do you remember your Christmas letter? Your family was ripped from you, and I know you have a new family now, but I thought it’d be nice to have a legal one. If you want it, of course, I mean if you-”
not what he wanted to spend the day doing, but he steps inside anyways, making his way to his chair that is thankfully by Snape and not the family. He sits nervously, watches Ellios and Severus nod to each other, and then Ellios is speaking.
your friend Hagrid lately?”
----------
Draco doesn’t even look up from his book,
adore you all <3!
And apparently, so would Krum.
“Draco,” They begin, “You have been a good friend to me so far. For that I am indebted. You not only kept my relationship with Severus a secret, but my relationship to my son quiet as well.”
“Who-”
To the left of the foyer is a hallway and the door arch to the kitchen that they’re probably going to have to completely redo, Misty says she’d rather just vanish everything but the one cabinet they’re using, so Draco adds it to the list of things he’ll probably be dragged into. Past the kitchen is a broken down office and a sunroom filled with dead plants and a broken window that’s left glass all over the floor. Misty looks extremely sad in this room, so Draco summons the two plants he got today, vanishes the old ones, waits for the purple smoke to clear, sets the wood and places the plants down.
It’s smaller than the others, but still bigger than Aunt Petunia’s master bedroom. Unlike her house, the woods in the room are light and inviting, the walls aren’t white but something close to it, and the window seal is painted a dark green color. He can already hear his friends playing the  ‘Slytherin Color’ card but he couldn’t care less about the green. It’s the golden snitch flying lazily around the matte emerald that catches his eye. The bed is pushed into an alcove with a small skylight. Fuck the snitch, the bed looks heavenly too. Sirius mentions something about satin sheets and pillow cases, but Harry’s focused on the actual bedding. Sure, the sheets are soft as fuck, but the blue and purple patterned bedspread currently has his focus. The longer he looks at it the more colors he sees. Like turquoise, yellow, red, pink, green-
We be needing protection!”
“Actually,” Lucius steps forward, “We need to talk about that.”
Hermione: (uses the Gala as a way to make all the powerful officals know her name)
Ron, Pansy is orchestrating a small summer gala.”
“Afraid not,” Draco chuckles, “My skin is a little too perfect for that. Rotting flesh and maggots don’t do it for me.”
her.”
“Mr. Malfoy. Where did you get that wound?”
wasn’t listening!”
“Floating heads?”
“One day,” Ron greets him, “One day I’ll be able to sleep in my own bed.”
“I know…”he admits, “I have trouble keeping up with everything and I was thinking too fast. If the heir of Slytherin had any enemies, anything that isn’t of pure magical descent is in danger….and my father means to hurt Potter. I just can’t tell if it’s directly or…”
“See?!” Hermione takes a second to control her voice, “LuLu gave me a kiss, she’s purring in your lap! That isn’t natural; we’re Malfoy’s enemies, aren’t we? He hates us!”
Draco waves his spoon in front of them. “Hello, can someone please explain? The rest of us are kinda confused.”
Draco takes a deep breath, hands petting LuLu just to stay calm. And then he tells her everything.
“Harry? I can write, you know. For Godric’s sake I’m not going to make you fill out a legal change of address.”
“Of course I did. When your father told me you hadn’t seen them I couldn’t believe it.”
