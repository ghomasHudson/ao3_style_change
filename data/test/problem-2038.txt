Draco trailed off, realizing he couldn't really say that in full confidence.

It was dreadful.
Since my job is apparently as your nursemaid, oh Vaunted One, I have taken it upon myself to clean out the disaster-zone you call a workspace.

The gift is me...in case that wasn't clear.
He came with a violent shudder but continued pumping through it, willing Draco to join him in the perfect, shattering decent.
"Let's just head toward the restaurant. Any minute now the press will be mobbing us... Did you want to confront them after dinner in a semi-formal conference or escape home right after we eat?"

...Moving on to topics that are substantially less depressing and, conversely, far more interesting, I feel I must inform you that I didn't actually prompt you to call me fit. I am delighted that you think so, however. It doesn't come
"Is staying the night still on the table?"
"My sessions with Ms Nancy are progressing decently well," Malfoy replied eventually. "Though you were not exaggerating her lack of tolerance for complaining of any sort." Harry chuckled, suspecting Malfoy may have tested it on purpose just to see if he'd been right. At least he’d sounded fond when he said so Harry presumed the two were on good enough terms. “I told her I am a painter and want desperately to get back to my craft,” Malfoy continued, expression wry, “so we have been working with a paintbrush, amongst other things. It’s more like a wand than the writing implement she had me using before,” he explained. “It has been...helpful."
If you won't do the rest, at least consider the haircut. You are in desperate need of one.
Harry released Draco's hands when he pushed against the hold. Once free, Draco trailed his fingertips over and around Harry's waist and to his arse. He squeezed and kneaded while moving (beautifully, brilliantly) against him and snuck two fingers between his arsecheeks to tease at his hole. Harry didn't flinch (it had taken a bit of time to get to that point). He just rocked a little faster, a little harder and replied, "I wouldn't mind. We'll last longer next time."
I see you sitting there with your breakfast, not eating and just looking so sad, and I get it. It's hard for you to be here. The memories are bad enough and the students aren't making it any easier.
He didn't wait for Draco's answer, instead walking further into the house to put distance between himself and temptation incarnate.
Sweet Merlin, Draco had a filthy mouth. And Harry loved it.
He thrilled internally (but kept his expression subdued) at the breathless joy on Draco's face. His efforts had obviously paid off. For as much as Draco had outgrown his entitled upbringing, he still delighted in being pampered. And Harry was going to pamper him that evening.
"Just so you know, however," he began as he returned to his meal, "Despite the fact that I haven't penetrated or been penetrated... I can almost guarantee I have more sexual experience than you, in way of experimentation at any rate."
Friday, at least, had gone by quickly. Harry and Ron were called in to assist with a break-in at Gringotts. The would-be thief hadn't managed to abscond with any valuables but it was quickly determined that he was operating under the effects of the Imperius, so there was a wizard at large using Unforgivables. Hence the Aurors being summoned.
“What? Oh right! Yeah. Sorry! My brain isn’t working at full capacity,” he shook his head as if rattling it around in there. “I think I just need to get a bite in me.”
Harry was close. Shudders wracked his frame and his body began to curl in on itself.
But Harry’s magic had been well-controlled since his school days—he hadn’t accidentally inflated anyone in years. He wasn’t sure how to tactfully ask Malfoy if the same was true for him so, as per usual, he went with the direct approach.
Apparently reading Harry's thoughts (shit--could he do that?), Malfoy pointed sharply at him. "I am still mad at you," he declared, even but firm, forestalling the development of any notions to the contrary. "Furious, actually."
"We just passed one, you twit." He walked back to the aluminum drum being used as a rubbish bin and tossed the cone away. He would have vanished it, but Harry had--quite smartly--kept his wand. Once finished, Draco adjusted his shirt (not bothering to button it) until it was straight and the wet mark over his nipple wasn't sticking to his skin so much. With a small frown, he willed it to dry faster.
usual brand of threats and complaints. He crossed his arms tightly and glared icy death at the man as Harry went into full Auror mode.
"Fine, fine," he stated, rather agreeably (already plotting when to tackle Draco again).
Fretfully, Harry carried the tea service back upstairs and found Malfoy where he'd left him--shirtless and bootless, but still in trousers, at least. He appeared to be asleep, so Harry settled quietly into one of the chairs and blew across the surface of his tea to cool it, contemplating the strange, maddening, sexy man before him.
Draco rolled them both over (with difficulty and lots of elbowing) until Harry lay nearly passed out beside him instead of on top of him as dead weight. The Slytherin himself turned until he could stretch out his limbs--arms above his head and toes separating. Once his body felt pleasantly tingly did he turn to Harry once again and move to curl up beside him.
He turned his eyes to Harry's chocolate confection and unconsciously licked his lips at the sight. He did love chocolate...

Dear Draco,
"Can I make a request?" Harry asked, pulling Draco against him in preparation for apparating. "No more talking about your parents this evening," he smirked before taking Draco's mouth in a kiss and sending them home.
Draco smirked. "Yes, but the
Draco was tired (and full of delicious bacon), but couldn't help but smile at the offer. He nodded and began to break his toast apart to eat in small, dignified pieces.
"I haven't slept with him," he corrected with deliberate calm, "but I might. I want to." He waited to make sure Ron fully absorbed that information. (The wide, fish-like stare he got a moment later said that he had.) "If I do, it isn't going to be a one-off," he stressed. "So this is your chance to stop talking like that and instead ask me what changed my mind. If you're not ready to have that conversation, fine. In that case, either kindly shut it or leave. I won't hear another bad word about Malfoy this morning."
There went his peace and focus.
Harry gave an affronted gasp and yanked the book from Malfoy's thieving clutches, dumping everything off his lap as he stood. "I said
Harry was just about to go in search of his friends when he caught another glimpse of the mystery man. He was closer now, making his way to a masked server with a platter of champagne flutes. The man exchanged his empty glass for a full one, tilted his head in Harry's direction, and seemed to be walking straight toward him.

Harry peered down at his own outfit--practical slacks and a button-down Oxford shirt in mint green, fairly standard for most therapists there. Maybe a tad dressier than what he usually wore, but his other clothes were in the laundry (or suddenly didn't fit right for some odd reason), so.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You are currently laying in a cocoon of my germs," he countered archly, indicating the bed and covers. "If you're gonna get sick, that ship has already sailed, my friend."

Draco was holding his quill loosely, running theoretical antidote variations through his head, when an ominous burble and snap sounded from behind him. He turned just in time to see the potion erupt in a thick plume of purple smoke before exploding violently--coating him in hot, sticky goo.

"Are you sure you won't be distracted with me like this at work...?"
Well, whatever it is my dick is now glowing. I need to know what I used and if I should be concerned.

Without waiting for Harry's answer, he voiced the next most pressing thought clamoring for attention in his head. "So, work. From what I have gathered you are currently the only Auror without an extensive medical record. Yes, you've sustained injuries--both serious and not, but for someone whom I imagine attracts so much trouble, I would think you'd have been hurt more often. Not that I want you to be," he quickly amended. "It's actually a relief." He peered closely at Harry. "Is it because of Weasley or are you just

"Thirsty?" he asked solicitously, sitting next to Draco and holding the water out for him.
Harry barked a laugh, feeling warm down to his toes. (Must be the noonday sun, he thought.)
******
He gathered Draco's wrists in one of his hands and pulled tight. Draco would be able to break free of his grip easily if he wanted to, but he didn't want to, so Harry pressed his advantage. He slid his free hand between them to unbutton Draco's shirt to the bottom of his sternum and pushed it off his shoulders. He then lowered his head to Draco's neglected nipple and gave it the same treatment he'd given the other--broad licks, lingering kisses, and gentle bites...along with a few not-so-gentle ones.
The niggle of doubt grew into a rather loud dissenting voice and finally to genuine concern great enough to overcome the primal need that spurred him to continue, consequences be damned. He broke the kiss with a pained gasp and held Draco still with an arm around his middle--the gesture a desperate lifeline as much as it was an embrace.
*****
*****
"Are you all right?" he asked earnestly, then, attempting humour to diffuse whatever trouble was brewing, "Is the garden heat too much for the battle-hardened Auror?"
Malfoy,
"All right, take me home," he breathed into the Auror's ear as he settled, as if to nap exactly where he was--upright and leaning his weight into the Gryffindor. "I'll get my coat later. I don't need it right now anyway... Do we have to go to the lobby again? You'll protect me, right?"
*****
Draco's spent cock twitched weakly and he bit his lip as he stared down at Harry's desperately wonton display. Having the Auror's cock rocking between his thighs and across his sensitive hole was more incredible than he would have reckoned. For all his silly facetious boasts, he might actually be ready for another go before long.
Dear Draco,
Well, no more! Computer has internet capability again and you should be seeing regular updates until the end now! I can't guarantee exactly
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, stiffening with concern.
. It had to be close to dinner time. What little light filtered through the murky lake water outside his window had been steadily dimming since they'd arrived at the lab. If it weren't for the torches lining the walls, they wouldn't be able to see much of anything.
Draco bit back any needless pleading that might have threatened in response, and instead closed his eyes and whined through his nose. His movements became more frenzied as he rode Harry's cock with abandon. Unlike the Auror below him, Draco hadn't even thought to wank before coming over--making his walk along the edge quicker.
"I wanted to talk with you about the attempt on your life," he said in a brisk, businesslike tone, lowering himself into the chair.
He shot the git a warning glare and flipped open the lid as Malfoy circled back around to drop onto the couch like the shiftless lay-a-bout he'd apparently become. Sure enough, the box contained an empty plastic syringe with a hypodermic needle, nestled on a scrap of black velvet. He wordlessly levitated the implement so he could inspect it from every angle without touching it.
"I don't swing that way."
"Don't bother Flooing me again," Pansy replied curtly before the flames went dark. Draco stared in shock at the spot her face had been a moment earlier. She'd been nastier than he had ever seen her, especially considering it was her precious Drakky she was talking to (a nickname she still used on occasion, though not as much as she had during school).
Harry cleared his throat, suddenly nervous. He'd planned to say this later, but there was no time like the present.

He could have drowned in the kiss. He poured all of his wanting and frustration and excitement and uncertainties into the hot press of lips and twining of tongues, making the occasional needy, frantic, aborted noise against his will.
," Harry groaned, nearly stumbling in his haste to get up the last stair and open the door (so much for the dampening of his reactions). He fell into Draco and took the opportunity to snog the breath out of him while coaxing the wards to let them pass.
"Be mindful: if it isn't
"Gimme a minute," he croaked, stretching the kinks out of his body.
Harry put his hands on Draco's hips when he went in for a kiss and didn't let go when they separated. (Those hips made rather fine handholds.) He was relieved that Draco was ok and their plans wouldn't have to be canceled and he felt something like amused exasperation over the misunderstanding, a feeling Draco evoked in him often.
I just realized that I neglected to answer your earlier question about my career choice. It is good of you to recognize my talent for Potions. While it
He turned to leave before Gladys had a chance to go in for a hug.
He shifted to alleviate the discomfort in his spine from cramming onto the too-short sofa, unintentionally rubbing their erections together in the process and nearly derailing his train of thought.

For the life of him, Harry could not figure out how to handle Malfoy's little taunts and challenges. Did he want Harry to sit next to him? If so, Harry should take the chair. But if he took the chair, then Malfoy would smirk and call him a coward. It was impossible to win.
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco's antics but it was hard to feel anything but fuzzy affection after what they'd just done. He pulled Draco in for a hard closed-mouth kiss then helped him down off the counter. Draco tottered to the oven on slightly wobbly legs while Harry wiped his cheek off with the side of his hand and stuffed himself back into his trousers.
Whereas the downstairs of the house was chic and modern, Draco's room would have been right at home in Hogwarts' dungeons.
*****
"This is nice," he said (after swallowing). What he meant encompassed more than the atmosphere and the meal, more even than Draco's company. It was all of it together. Coming home to someone who made him happy and being able to make him happy with just his presence. Wanting to make him happy and take care of him--not because Draco couldn't do those things on his own, but because it pleased Harry to do them.

But what he lacked in delicacy he more than made up for with

Is that a threat? Don't forget I've got a lifetime's worth of blackmail on you.
He decided to answer the questions chronologically to buy time before tackling the harder one.

of Draco performing feat after feat to demonstrate his humanity to Potter:
"I think that's my new favourite way to describe me: 'helpful and maddening'," Draco laughed softly and kept his eyes down toward his lap. His hands were clenched into tight fists, though his energy read anxiety versus anger. After a few seconds, he lifted his gaze to catch Harry's and bit his bottom lip.
"This'll all be over soon," he murmured.
...wanting the meal?”
(When it is warranted, which, in this case, it is).
"I messed up," he admitted on an exhale, resigned to his fate.
Though Harry was bone-weary, he didn't think he could sleep. He was that totally fried, absolutely exhausted, brain-is-on-holiday kind of wired. Ordinarily in that state, he'd exercise until passing out, but Draco was ready for bed and wanted company. Harry could accommodate.
Retrieving his discarded wand to conjure some lube, he pinned Draco with his knees against his hips, his flaccid prick nestled in the soft curve of his arse, and placed kisses across his shoulders. He reached both hands around him. His right, coated with clear, shining lubricant, resumed its efforts on Draco's prick, gliding easily over the velvety skin now. His left, open-palmed, trailed possessively over the hard plain of Draco's abdomen before cupping and kneading one of his pectorals.
"...So, when are you going to get mad at me and plot revenge? Or is punching a man in the face without warning still the preferred Gryffindor style?"
"Seriously?
"I'll stop troubling you then," he said affably. "I certainly don't want to disturb Master Draco's sleep!"
And just like that, there went his libido--not the first time Hermione'd had that effect on him--and in its place bloomed guilt and shame. Always a fun combination after sex. Bloody buggering hell. Why hadn't he run the ruddy spells before doing anything with Draco? He'd known his behaviour was way out of character. This whole fucking masquerade was a terrible idea from the start. Hadn't he been saying that all along? People do bloody idiotic things when they feel anonymous. He was no exception, apparently.
Godrick, but it was wonderful. Draco shuddered and bucked, forcing them the rest of the way in. Harry kneaded the strained muscle of Draco's right thigh, pulling his fingers most of the way out and pressing them back in again, steady and firm.
When it started back up again, it was faster. Shallower. Slightly panty.
"I want that, too."
...The blonde had simply occupied his thoughts somewhat frequently of late.
Did you send me a collar and leash? I know we've been dating a month now, but a collar and leash? Really? I'm your boyfriend, not your pet!
The laces at his back were tightened until Harry could barely breathe. He gripped his hips in an effort to keep some form of balance while Gieves abused his ribcage and lungs, but the moment he lifted his head to look at Draco it ceased to matter.

"The truth is... About my feelings on the subject... It's hard to describe," Draco idly ripped of the tip of a ketchup packet, which he was certainly not adept at if the squirt of red now decorating Harry's cheek meant anything. Draco squeezed the rest onto his plate with a sheepish smile. "I'm angry, sad, frustrated, confused... I don't believe what Blaise or what Pansy said. I mean, they loved me--really loved me--once. We played pranks on each other, some going a bit far, but..."
Your sense of fashion has improved marginally since then.
"I'm glad," Draco kissed his cheek, his temple, and then his neck. Each time his lips rained down was slow and had an added suckle. "I finished my next book. Would you like to read it before it's even published? I kept a copy of it just for your perusal."
Draco sniffed. "Suit yourself," he said dismissively. "I have better things to do anyway." He grinned, going for Harry's belt. "Shagging you in the office kinds of things."
"Harry," Draco half-whined. "Harry! I can't feel my legs and my ass feels like you used a mace on it! You've ruined me!"
The thrill of not knowing what Draco had planned caused butterflies in his stomach. He was eager to find out.

"Do it," Draco released his leg when his arm started to cramp and instead used it to caress the side of Harry's face, his thumb pressing into the skin of Harry's lips. He stared up into Harry's brilliant, practically glowing green eyes with a trace of uncertainty, but it wasn't for the act they were about to commit. Draco turned his eyes away for a moment, closed them with a deep breath, and then turned back looking determined.
It was oddly nice of you to include the potion. Thanks for that, it really does help. You have such a knack for them, how come you didn't pursue Potions as a career instead?

He wanted to take over, wanted to feel what Draco was feeling. More than anything, he wanted to fuck him, to be the reason for his whimpers and moans, but the tiny part of his brain clinging desperately to rationality told him that was too much, too soon.
Pansy was wearing a dress almost to her knickers and heels that looked almost a foot high. Blaise was wearing a ridiculous jester hat that someone had stuffed onto his dome. And then, there was Draco: short hair, loose top, dragon leather pants, and half-gloves. They glowed and changed colors under the lights and bumped into each other and every body that came close. Pansy wrapped herself around a random bloke who happened to catch her fancy and he dragged her off. Blaise was talking up a small group of females, as charming as ever. Draco, abandoned, deigned to leave the stage. His footing was somewhat off (he was buzzed and exhausted) when, just as he reached the edge of the floor... A young man with ruffled black hair, large spectacles, and green eyes approached.
Potter snorted. "You got me," he answered with a wink. "It's that snobby, superior drawl. Call me a 'speccy git' and it'll be all over."

"Well, who knew Harry Potter Sex Auror was such a delectable sight in steaming water?"
"... Harry," he moaned gently as his prostate was nearly touched.
When Draco put it that way, Harry did want to stay and play. It's not like he had an official start time compelling him to go--it was his day off, after all.
Once he was satisfied that his hair and body were properly rinsed, Draco turned to Harry, intending to take the soap and wash himself until an idea struck.
"You know what you need," she declared, mind apparently made up.
Harry tried to control his breathing through his nose. His nostrils flared like a bull’s.
"You'll love the Garden Room," he promised, a bubble of excitement lending a musical lilt to his voice. "Looks like Eden and is completely private beyond the staff.
"The gentlemanly thing to do is to cast a glamour, at least," hey said, waving at his neck. "I can't see what needs to be covered up. And before you suggest otherwise, I am not about to walk around in public looking like a randy teenager." Inappropriate erections notwithstanding.

Sharp, gray eyes slowly widened as he turned to regard the voice beside him. The glass nearly fell from his grip.
"Rinse," he prompted, doing likewise with his hands and forearms (praising himself for the foresight of taking off his shirt since his whole front was wet from unintentional splashes).
Draco slouched against the wall, looking irritated and bored.
"Can I pour either of you a glass?" Hermione offered, indicating the wine.
"What have you been doing all this time?" Harry sarcastically retorted as he wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him in for a hug, angling his face downward to avoid getting a mouth full of water. He pressed several wet kisses to Draco's shoulder and prominent clavicle.

What he found amusing in that dark truth was utterly beyond Harry. Nevertheless, he replied:
Like he wasn't embarrassed, upset, and on the verge of panic.

The Garden Room stopped Harry in his tracks.
Rising hastily and dusting himself off as best he could, he appraised the man standing on the other side of the still damnably locked gate.

Draco stood from the couch once again, this time in order to carefully slip his furred outer robes away and hang them over his arm. Underneath he wore a silk tie wrapped inside the collar of a thin green button up tucked into black slacks. He used his teeth to carefully remove his gloves from his hands.
Before seating himself, Harry took a moment to look around the house. It was a sleek, modern, stylish bi-level. Quite unlike the interior of the Manor except in the exorbitant price-tags he assumed the furnishings had come with. There was a large black bookcase along one wall, filled to the brim with an assortment of thick, old tomes that would probably make Hermione drool. There was also a set of books on the mantle that looked to be new. He couldn't discern anything more about them from that distance but he'd try to get a peek at them later. He believed that a person's taste in literature said a lot about them (and tried not to apply that principle too strictly to himself when it came to his own choices of late).
The flat look Ron sported at Harry's "bargain" could have rivaled his own mother's.

Draco didn't heed Harry's anxiety. There was no one around, as far as his tipsy brain knew, so he carefully crawled from his seat and sat on Harry's thighs--legs propping up almost uncomfortably at the Auror's sides. He had both hands curling and squeezing around Harry's growing member with a smirk.
He reached behind himself to pull the tab that diverted water to the shower head and stepped into the spray.

Your eleventh gift is mistletoe and it is in my office. Along with your twelfth. I'll let you unwrap that one early if you promise not to tell.
Ron and Hermione were over last night. Hermione commented on my "noticeable improvement in mood" and wondered if it was because I finally started seeing the Mind Healer she's been trying to get me to go to for months. I informed her that I have been talking to someone and that that is probably the difference she noticed, but that it's not the Mind Healer. I didn't tell her who, though she was dying to know; I wasn't sure if you'd want me to or not.
Harry had been reasonably sure Draco would like hearing the proclamation but he hadn't been prepared to be literally bowled over by his reaction.
Draco could feel Harry tensing, most likely from discomfort. He had never really been with a bloke, he claimed, so this would be an entirely new experience for him--something that made Draco oddly happy. Once Harry began to relax from his finger, he began to thrust the digit in search of that special bundle of nerves that would make the Auror howl (all while bobbing his head up and down with firm suction.)
"I had planned a strip tease, you see," Draco mentioned with a dramatic sigh. "But that is a lost cause now. So, what would you like to see now... And what are you willing to do for it?"
Of course I didn't throw away your keepsakes--I'm not a monster. What I disposed of was the accumulated detritus from several years' worth of greasy takeaway as well as dozens of outdated memos and briefings.
Draco rolled his eyes, cuddled up, and gave the top of Harry's head a kiss, before promptly falling asleep.
Let me answer your question with a question: If you had the opportunity to make a first impression a second time, would you take it? Or put another way, if you could introduce yourself to someone as you, plain and simple--without all the baggage of regrettable tattoos and bitter rivalries--wouldn't you want to?

Draco yipped twice for the second option, letting Potter's insult slide (for now).
Without further ado, he pulled Potter's zipper down as far as it would go, exposing a tempting vee of tanned skin from Potter's collarbone to the middle of his sternum. He bent forward to sample a taste, delighting in the musky, salty tang of fresh sweat. (One of the perks of the physically demanding job they shared.)
"And how, pray tell, do you propose to do that?"
Draco poured the noodles over the cheese and mixed them together before evening them out again across the bottom. The chicken was carefully placed on top and then the entire dish was covered in a thick (but not drowning) layer of sauce, before more cheese was sprinkled on top.
No treacle tart for you, I'm afraid. St. Mungo's checks for that sort of thing. We'll just have to get you one when you are finally released.
He took Harry's hand into his left as he used his right to tug and pull off the tie still wrapped about his neck. He folded the piece skillfully with one hand before sliding it into a pocket.
It was a lead that needed following.

With that he turned with an attempt to flee.

"Apparently."
If you were to spoon feed it to me, however, I might be willing to reconsider.
Harry's heart rate picked up in anticipation. He wondered if the man intended to strike up a bit of small talk or if the exaggerated sway in his steps meant he'd try something more. Something Harry might reciprocate...if only for a few minutes of excitement in an otherwise dull soirée.
Harry shivered.
The entire incident shook him enough to lose interest in his once coveted "Night Life", he knew, and spoke volumes about dangers he hadn't thought to worry about before. Muggles were something he never thought twice about and considered harmless... Until that damned needle. Maybe that was why he told him? Who better to keep you safe than a real life hero?
"The Rose Room was one of Mother’s favourites," Malfoy explained, intuiting Harry's unspoken question. "It has come to be one of mine, as well." His gaze travelled the room, lingering on one of the paintings wherein a rosy cheeked cherub gave him a friendly grin. "I find its atmosphere more pleasant than much of the rest of the house." The ghost of a smile flickered on his face but it was gone as quickly as it had appeared. "Its location is another mark in its favour," he continued, "as I have moved most of my activities to the ground level of late."
Draco was nowhere in sight. Just jewel-toned leaves and hundreds of flowers in a riot of colours as far as the eye could see. Harry spied a promising-looking wall, however, and a flutterby bush quivering madly because
That's the spirit! (And to think you said you don't 'do' dirty talk only a few short weeks ago.)
I usually abide by the drunk rule but we were only buzzed, really.
Harry’s leg was beginning to cramp, the overtaxed remaining muscles seizing up beneath Malfoy’s dead weight. As gingerly as he could, he began to shift inch by painstaking inch so that his left hip became the fulcrum for their combined weight.
Sincerely yours,
Harry didn't let up. With Draco now facing him, he placed a hand on each side of the blonde--fingers splayed against the pale skin of Draco's hips. He leaned forward, just barely touching their lips together as he spoke.
You are frustratingly stubborn, you know that? Luckily (or unluckily) for you, I can be quite stubborn myself.

Which was his own damn fault, he reminded himself sternly. Penance wasn’t meant to be comfortable, was it?
"I see, so you really do want to keep me... I'm glad. Have you decided what you'd like to use as your official mark? Besides the nice bruise I'm still sporting on my thigh? I think I know what I want for you."
He turned the heat down to simmer and leaned against the counter, facing Malfoy (digging deep to find the courage to do so). "You're a great writer," he said earnestly. "It's why I read all your books." (Well, not the
The girl was so rattled at being questioned by a big, scary Auror they didn't even need veritaserum to secure her tearful confession. She had indeed distributed the deadly plants in the garden at Zabini's instruction, though she wasn't the one who obtained them. Apparently Zabini had given them to her, not to kill or maim Draco, but to humiliate him, to 'teach him a lesson' for thinking himself too good for the narcissistic cunt.
"I've been working on my book. I had sort of a... Rabid idea running about my head, since this one is a little more complicated than normal, and nothing I write seems to be any good today. It's frustrating!"

Two hours, one interrogation, and a hefty dose of veritaserum later and Harry had secured a written confession. Goyle admitted to attacking Draco in the club, but denied all knowledge of the Devil's Snares in the restaurant.
"Are you coming or not?" the Gryffindor demanded impatiently and Draco remembered that he was in something of a hurry to resolve his current predicament. He scrambled down the gargoyle's arm and reached for Potter, who was gracious enough to offer his hand.
Harry set to work putting the kitchen to rights while Draco made his call, curious about what he and Parkinson might be discussing. His face flamed when he thought the answer could be the activities they had gotten up to that day.
His neck flexed almost painfully, craning his head backwards into Draco's shoulder as his whole body bent like a bow. His fingers scrabbled for purchase on the slick tiles and he came on a hoarse cry, relying heavily on Draco's arms for support lest he crumple to the floor.
"Satisfied? Speaking of 'princess'..." Draco began with a smirk and a chuckle, "Just who could this Princess D I've heard about you consorting with recently be? The papers are all aflutter about it."
Harry laughed and then gasped at Draco's retaliation for the stolen fish. He attached himself to Harry's neck as if he were a vampire, peppering him with kisses that were sure to leave marks.
Shagging in the park seemed like a brilliant idea--it meant almost instant gratification and the weather outside really was quite pleasant that evening--but Harry couldn't risk it. The leeches at the Prophet had snapped pictures of him in places he hadn't expected them before. Plus it was getting dark.
Cursing the fates for their unceasingly cruel sense of humour, Draco resolved to make the long trek to the first floor for the Gryffindor Head's Office. It was small consolation that he wouldn't have to go all the way across the castle or up too many of its one hundred forty two staircases in search of aid. The journey would be perilous enough as it was. He hoped against hope Mrs. Norris III wasn't out patrolling the halls or that he encountered any errant students on the way. Merlin forbid he be mistaken for a pet. Or worse--vermin.
Draco sighed.

"Master is wanting to know the purpose of your visit," he rasped, tone stern. "Master is not expecting company."
“Potter, stop thinking so loudly. Your fretting is disturbing my sleep.”
Since you seem to be amused by muggle things and are constantly using tempus charms to check the time (due, I assume, to your habitual tardiness), I had this item custom tailored for you. It is called a "wristwatch." I was informed that it is functionally the same as a pocket-watch, but the time is displayed numerically as with a tempus (so you don't have to fuss with deciphering the little hands and Roman numerals). The colour is a basic black for mission purposes. It is purported to be waterproof and shock resistant, though I do not know how well it will stand up against offensive spells.
"What do you like here?" he asked to winnow the search.
Dear Draco,
*****
? If so, I am impressed with your ability to keep that detail out of the public conversation. I know you are a highly private individual, but the fact that the press hasn't yet caught wind of that juicy tidbit is a testament to your discretion.

"Take a breath," Harry prompted, placing his hands on Draco's shoulders and using the calm, no-nonsense tone he reserved for a victim or witness (even an Auror, on occasion) on the verge of panic.
*****
“I’d offer to pull out your chair for you, but,” Malfoy said, letting the implied ‘I’m a cripple’ hang between them.
Draco bent his knees and laid his left leg at his side as the other hovered above the bed over his hip. He held his upright knee with one hand as the other gripped the blanket and squeezed. His brows furrowed as he was slowly penetrated by a single digit.
*****
"Keen observation," he replied sarcastically, attempting to regain his footing. "I had a procedure done. My vision isn't perfect, but it's a good deal better than it used to be."
Something snagged his ankle as he passed, nearly sending him sprawling. It wrapped a tight, thick coil around his lower calf and pulled tight. Whatever it was was tenacious, grabbing for his left wrist and thigh, and squeezing mercilessly when he tried to pull free.
I've no place to judge, really, but your daily agenda sounds rather unhealthy. Do you still work with potions at all? You were particularly gifted there.
What's the point of secret code names if you call me by my given name in your very next reply? What kind of Auror are you?
Janine tapped her lip thoughtfully. "It can't have been that he's gay," she stated, matter-of-fact. "He's even fancier than you. What in the world did you do, Henry?"

And Draco--who watched him breathlessly with soft, deep grey eyes--wanted it, too.
He apparated to Malf--Draco's doorstep and knocked, eager anticipation making his heartbeat quick and palms sweaty, like he used to get before a quidditch match.

"You have so much," he murmured, almost in awe.
So my thought is this: You've got their attention already. Do something with it. Prove wrong the bastards campaigning to get you expelled and cheering for you to fail, and show the rest of the student body what Slytherin house can be with the right people at the helm.

P.S. Yes, it's Draco Malfoy. Okaygoingnowbye
I'm going to busy myself with my toys in the meantime.
He wasn't even certain what he was asking for.

Harry wiped the ketchup off his face without comment. Draco was saying something important and he looked so sad Harry's heart twisted in sympathy (and he felt like even more of a heel for his careless comment about Zabini).
******
You're a kinky bastard, Potter. I like it.
"Professionally?" Draco asked, sliding each bowl of vegetables over to Potter as he filled them. "I decided to publish one of my longer stories, just to see what kind of fan-base I could catch... Fishing, I suppose." He smiled--a bit proud, a bit shy. "It was surprisingly well-received. There's quite a market for erotic fiction as it turns out. One day a woman from a publishing company asked if I would write for her company for a hefty sum. I jumped for it. I was about eighteen, I think."
?" she sneered. "You're harder to get into than Gringrotts. Who could possibly be so special as to finally earn the key to that well-guarded vault?"
*****
Harry
We've all done things we're not proud of--some of us more than others, sure--but if we can't move forward and put the past behind us, then what are you even doing here? I mean, isn't that the point?
Harry did suck Draco's fingers, but not because he thought that would be sufficient lubrication--he knew enough about the mechanics (thanks to a book from Hermione, embarrassingly) to insist on real lube when it came to. No, he did it because it was fucking hot.
"Face to face or chest to back?" Draco somehow managed to ask even as he struggled to breathe. Having something inside wasn't so nerve wracking (he had Harry's fingers inside him at least a dozen times now)... The realization that
“Feel better?” Malfoy asked, popping his elbow on the table and the side of his face in his hand. The left one. His right was hidden in his lap.
Harry froze.
the surly House–elf Harry had last seen outside the Manor’s gates appeared. “Yes, Master Draco?“ he asked, bowing and scraping so low his bulbous forehead nearly touched the floor. Harry wished he would’ve had at least a little warning first. Godric knew he’d made a bad enough impression on the elf already, no sense in making it worse by sprawling like a drunkard after too much firewhisky. Why he cared more about Bixby’s opinion on the matter than Malfoy’s was anybody’s guess, nevertheless he struggled into an upright position and tried for an air of self-possession.

You will stay
In a more direct voice he added, "I assume you'll be sending an owl for that memory appointment, yes? If so, I'm sure you can show yourself out. I'm still tired."
"What treatment strategies have your Healers utilized?" he probed, beginning to jot notes on his intake sheet.
He locked down the instinctive panic that urged him to struggle, making himself calm and still. There was only one plant that behaved like that and it was Devil's Snare. It would only hold tighter the more he fought it.

"Go on. Praise my body and then mess up my hair like you always do," Draco said with a smirk and a toss of his head. "I know you want to."
," Draco said with a rather lively waggle of his brows.
Feeling proud, he blew on the bite to cool it and finally responded to Draco's obvious baiting. "Let's see how many orgasms we can accomplish on our own before resorting to the magically-enhanced lube that might make our dicks fall off, yeah?"
"That was... Interesting," Draco said once he could catch his breath. He closed his eyes and grinned. "Someone was determined..."
******
When the last playful bubbles of Harry's laughter floated off into the night, he was left with a hollow feeling of melancholy and bitter regret.
But it wasn't a bluff. He'd meant every word. He just hadn't been thinking all that clearly when he said them. Or, rather, wrote them.
Whyever would you submit to drinking an untested potion (even if it was brewed by Granger)? That is asking for trouble. Much riskier than conversing with a Slytherin who fancies you, at any rate.
Coffee is absolutely terrible for you: it is addicting, creates bad breath, and yellows teeth. Before you become fully dependent on something so pedestrian, I would like you to consider some alternatives. Your next gift is a collector's edition tea box with assorted teas from around the world--both caffeinated and decaffeinated, including many traditional British blends. I trust you will find one that you favour.
Without further ado, he pulled a purple memo sheet out of the top drawer of his desk and took up a quill to write the request.
For that day, at least.
that exploded from his ruined leg through every nerve in his body was an inescapable waking nightmare.
He charmed the scrub brush to clean the dishes and the washrag to dry them and put the kettle on the hob for tea. He didn't know if Draco planned on staying long enough to want it but it was no trouble to get it started just in case.
Your eyes are the most stunning I've ever seen. It's too bad they're always hidden by those godawful specs.
"Oi! What's all this fuss about?" Ron strolled into the room, a brown paper bag in one hand and a flaky, half-eaten croissant in the other dropping crumbs on both his magenta robes and the floor. He wore a look of cautious curiosity--he was understandably weary to pick a side whenever his best friend and wife were going at it.
"The name of an over-the-counter Muggle painkiller," he answered, tucking the pen into his lapel in case he wanted it later. "You'll need it. They're not nearly as effective as potions, but it'll take the edge off, at least. And because they operate by a different mechanism than magic, they won't be affected by your tolerance or interfere with your withdrawal process. You can pick up a bottle at Tesco on your way home."
As for me, I did, in fact, buy my way onto the team, but it was for a good cause, at least. We reserved several spots for the highest bidder and were able to raise an additional 100,000 galleons from the entitled monied (like myself) looking to enjoy a bit of sport and fanfare. I assure you, my interest is in benefitting the children first and foremost, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't also looking forward to the tourney being great fun. Especially if
In the aftermath of the attack, with adrenaline still coursing through his veins, he was just glad they were okay. It wasn't yet time to relax, however. Aurors would be there any minute and they would all be brought into the DMLE for questioning.
The irreverent question, coupled with Malfoy's sultry drawl and trademark smirk, hit Harry like a punch of lust straight to the gut. Apparently what he had mistaken as the effects of the potion were actually just...Malfoy.
If there was a silver lining to be found, maybe Robards would think twice before forcing him to attend the next stuffy society function.
Harry
"Now, I had assumed we both left our wands downstairs," Draco began casually as he moved to sit over Harry's thighs, "but that little smug look you flashed makes me wonder if you did that muggle-born thing and stuffed yours in your back pocket before we came up here. Let's see, shall we?"
Not about the wanting. That much was obvious.
As a result of my investigation, I learned that not only does one of your best friends work in the Department of Mysteries, but she and one of my best friends (who has a reputation for meddling) both spearheaded this Secret Santa business.
The fact of the matter was, Malfoy's attacker was still out there. Which meant the paranoia that had driven him to ground was warranted. There was no telling when someone angry enough to try to take a life might make a second attempt, so Harry wouldn't rest until the case was solved. But the crick in his neck and gritty feeling in his eyes told him he should be done for the day (except maybe to put in a request for the Hit Wizards to track Goyle down ASAP).
Harry
Dear Draco,
She sat back normally with a chuckle.
******
"Fuck, Harry... That voice you use, that's why I let you boss me around..." Draco breathed as he released Harry's cock and gently dislodged his hand. He began to crawl backward along Harry's ready body, peppering kisses down his chest and stomach as he went. "Tell me more..."
Harry put his musings aside when Draco resurfaced. He guided him to sit upright and then set to work on the tension in his shoulders and back, aided by the slippery water and the oils it contained.
"Grow up, Harry," was all she said then, with no small measure of disappointment.
Merlin, he was so fucking hot. Harry let his eyes roam greedily over Draco's body and felt a little lightheaded from the swift exodus of blood from his brain.
Harry quickly did up his trousers and extricated himself from Draco, turning to stand protectively in front of him. He kept a modest hand over his rapidly deflating erection. Molly ushered Ginny out of the room, Arthur frowned thoughtfully, and Andromeda covered Teddy's eyes. George shouted. Neville blushed. Dean and Seamus cackled. Luna smiled dreamily (saying something like, 'How nice') and Hermione appointed herself the spokesperson for the group.
******
Draco chuckled before closing the distance between their mouths to take Potter's lips in a heated kiss. There was something to be said for the man's enthusiasm, at least.
Draco quirked a brow over the mask as he was give the order. He went to grab at the front of Harry's shirt and grasp both sides, ripping the Auror's top open with a cascade of buttons as he murmured in a dark, lust-ridden voice, "Harry Going-To-Be-Fucked Potter."
So what changed? And when?
"Why don't you take the bag to the dining table and enjoy, hm? I'll just take a bath. I haven't cleaned up yet," which he was planning to do
Harry cleared his throat.
Draco swatted his hand irritably, dismissing the objection before it was fully voiced. "Not the important part, Pans! Anyway, so we have only been on two half dates, the man is

Potter,
"I'll be apparating us there," Draco announced as he moved to take and then tug Harry's arm toward the door. Upon finding the handle loose and the portal unwarded--the result of his lust-induced carelessness--he stood frozen in shock and burgeoning panic.
******
! Mrs. Weasley made it. Can we eat it before dinner? Grandma said we hafta wait 'til after dinner but it's your birthday so if you say we can eat it first, we should get to eat it first."
Draco's nose twitched, sniffing at the mouthwatering aroma. Pride be damned, he was hungry!
After that, he scrawled another, inviting Draco over the next night. With it, he included open access to his Floo...which was a big freaking deal. But his gut told him it was the right call. Trusting it had already paid dividends that day, after all.

Or would he--

"The Garden Room? You mean that restaurant where you and your pet princess were attacked by Devil's Snare?" Ron stood from his desk with that bit of news. He had a feeling this was going to lead to picking the girl up and a lot of paperwork. "Are you certain it was the same woman who served you?"
, he thought soppily.
"Forgive me then?" Harry asked with a hopeful, lopsided grin that he knew many people found charming (he wasn't above using all the weapons in his arsenal; not for this) and ignoring the sound of someone climaxing a few feet away from them.
That is virtually the same as lying.
As they grew closer to the counter, the girl attending smiled warmly at them both. Upon closer inspection of her face Draco realized he may already know this girl...

"Can you please tell me, in as much detail as you can remember, the circumstances leading up to the attack, the attack itself, and the aftermath?" he requested, dropping the syringe back into its housing, and leveling Malfoy with a penetrating stare.

Harry groaned, shifting anxiously in the chair. He was torn between spreading his legs for Draco and crossing them primly.
It was a disappointment? So does that mean you regret it then?
Here are the reports a day early.
One hand squeezed around the crown of the Draco's cock before slamming down toward his hips with a particularly hard thrust. The other stroked the length of Draco's back (delighting in the feel of his soft, smooth skin, which shimmered with perspiration of its own). He clamped onto Draco's shoulder and gripped tight for better leverage.
"Let's see how quickly I can get us hard again. Do you think you could handle another round?"

Harry spared a passing thought over possible romance between them but quickly dismissed it as foolishness. Just because he had found love in the most unlikely place didn't mean anyone else would. Probably.

He grunted when Draco pressed his leg between his thighs, and rutted against him shamelessly.
he silently vowed before finally loosening his arms. He jerked his head away and moved to step outside. He had left his robes by the table with no intention of retrieving them.
"I don't have anything 'fancy muggle', which I didn't think was what you really meant. I mean, do muggles even know what 'fancy' means?"
quite nice). Let's talk about Granger's hair. Still a bush? Did she ever marry Weasley? I know they both had parts in the war that led to its end, but I never see a mention of them in the paper and I admit I am curious. Your Golden Trio was something I both enjoyed watching and hated with a passion."
******
At the moment, that complication was particularly...complicated.
He eyed the taller man surreptitiously as they made slow progress toward the appointment desk. With a limp that bad, a cane wouldn't be remiss, but he was not ready to broach the subject. Malfoy already bore more than a passing resemblance to his father--with his hair grown out and hanging loose about his ears, knocked free as it was by his exertions. At least Narcissa's graceful features lent him an air of elegance the senior Malfoy had never possessed. Always pretty, Malfoy had grown into a strikingly handsome man, time and trials etching character into a face that had once been unblemished porcelain. In spite of his infirmity, he carried himself with dignity and poise. What Harry once would have called arrogance, he now knew was something far more nuanced: that complex, compelling Pureblood pride that had enabled Malfoy to survive the unimaginable horrors he'd suffered at the hands of Riddle and his cronies.
"He's all right?

Once the owl was on its way, Harry shoveled a bite of curry (gone cold) into his mouth and picked up his book--
Hang in there.
"That part isn't important. What is-- "
Draco became so caught up in his thoughts that he nearly fell off his perch when the staircase suddenly lurched to admit the object of his obsession. Clinging to the stone for dear life, he willed his fluttering, panicked heart to settle after the scare.
Malfoy held the bottle to his lips and tipped his head back to drink. Harry averted his eyes, finding the pale column of his throat entirely too distracting. "I'm ready when you are," he declared, gazing into the swirling surface of the pensieve with no small amount of unease.
He pecked Harry's lips, then his cheek and ear.
******
"How did you come to write professionally?" Harry inquired, genuinely curious. He returned to the hob to turn the chicken, pleased with the golden brown sear that was developing.
Three dances ago.
I'm not saying no...I'm just not sure it's a good idea to say yes.
"Don't start making judgments based on how this looks," he warned. "It's just a convenient apparation point."
I appreciate you informing me of the situation and being so generous with the Black artefacts, but I am afraid there is a problem with your proposition (besides the inconvenient fact of my house arrest): there isn't enough in it for

He opened the oven door and saw that the tops had risen and were just beginning to crack. The smell that wafted out the open door was divine. Another minute then.
"For the record, the only one of us who keeps asserting my rigid heterosexuality is you."
He turned to Potter and grinned mischievously.
Draco was suitably chastened.

~Harry
"Oi, mate. Wha'cha got there?" Ron asked around a mouthful of crisps. He was dipping back in his chair with the crisps bag on his lap and his feet settled over the edge of his desk.
His hands went to Draco's hips, but not to push or direct; merely to hold on for dear life (because without that anchor he felt he might come apart at the seams).
"Would you like to see it?"
If Draco hadn't already known he was utterly and irrevocably gay, that sight would have settled it for him--there could be no going back to women after something like that. He was exceedingly grateful that Potter was making enough noise to cover up the eager trills and purrs he couldn't seem to smother. Damn potion. He would need to consider this experience when crafting the warning label.

to sink inside you.  And happily suck you off if I finish before you do. But I really don't care in the end...as long as we get to it sometime
Feeling reckless and emboldened (these bloody masks were dangerous), Harry took a large step backwards so that he and Draco were nearly back-to-back. He casually replied to Hermione's inquiry about the lobster bisque ("It's good. You should try it.") and reached behind himself to give Draco a firm, retributive pinch on the arse.
Harry wanted to get him talking again. Not only was it a novel challenge, but conversation often helped patients take their minds off the tedious and difficult tasks he made them do.
"Yes, I will. Not what I expected, but this means far more than just a claiming trinket," Draco breathed, slowly regaining his composure as he shifted his thoughts and anxiety around to focus once again on Harry. "That actually does mean a lot to me. But what if someone attacks us? And your job... Isn't it already hard considering who you are and how many out there hope to challenge you for it?"
"That's at least partially true," he agreed in good humour.
"Don't worry... I promise to take care of your stuff should you die during the visit. I'll use Grimmauld Place to store my porn."
"I know you live alone here now, but what about your elves?" he asked in response to the suggestion he undress early. "Wouldn't they be uncomfortable seeing me walk around in the all together?"
...Swimming sounds nice the way you describe it. Almost like flying, indeed. Unfortunately, I haven't wanted to go back in the water since the Triwizard Tournament. I can kick around a bit if I need to and I might wade in the shallows on a hot day, but I get anxious if it's more than waist deep.
And, he could admit, he felt better behind the thick, ancient wards of his childhood home.
*****
And if all of this really is just a potion talking, as you and Mother (erroneously) claim, how do you explain the many fantasies I've entertained of the two of us together,  dating as far back as our third year of school? I certainly was not "under the influence" then.
Dear Harry Potter,
******
Draco pushed Harry's hand away from his cock in order to pull himself up along the bed until he was properly settled against the pillows, and then bending his knees up and laying his arms above his head.
"Twat," Harry groused, full of affection.
Please do consider it. For the children, if not for old time's sake.
“Sure. Right. Yeah,” he agreed rapidly, nodding like one of Arthur’s muggle novelties (Bubble head? Wobble head? Something like that). “Back to training, then?“ he said hopefully, voice cracking as he did so (as if to prove there was, in fact, a level of an embarrassment beyond what he had already achieved).
His head lolled and his grip relaxed (having tightened until his perfectly manicured nails left crescent moon imprints in the Auror's taut skin through his top, he was sure). "Ha... Nn..." he breathed as he fell forward and laid his head against Harry's neck, hands dropping away limply.
That was when it clicked. How had he not noticed it before? He stared for a long moment directly into Potter's eyes and blinked as the realization that they were no longer obscured hit him like a hammer to the face.
Harry eagerly dug through the basket in search of the rumored tart. "No worries," he replied, grinning ear-to-ear when he found it at the bottom, wrapped in one of Molly's gingham dish cloths. He hugged it to his chest. "You brought food, so I forgive you. And your mum is my hero." His smile wavered momentarily, some of his enthusiasm dampened by worry. "Is Rosie ok, though?"
"Why? Because I like you," he said, as if it were obvious. "I want this thing we might be growing to flourish and bloom. I want to get to know the man known as Harry Potter and decipher him from the boy I knew. I want this to be something real and far from fleeting... I want us to date, have fights, make up, take naps, and, yes, rut and experiment and have sex. But I don't want the latter to be our main component.
He realized belatedly he had noticed it in the hall, though faintly. His brain hadn't had a chance to register the scent before he'd crawled under the door. By that point, it was much too late.

Draco wanted to deny the accusation of being
******
"Whoa," Potter said, rocking back on his heels and holding his hands defensively before his face. From this distance his eyes looked impossibly big and green, and Draco could pick out the individual hairs of his five o'clock shadow. He also had a rosy tint to his cheeks, but whether that was from his shower or his earlier activity was unclear.
Panic, confusion, and shock instantly went off like sharp bells, all at once clamoring for attention inside Draco's head.
******
Malfoy smothered a laugh. Harry was just about to jog a victory lap when the other man's expression turned hard.
He was plenty angry still. He paced a few steps to calm his temper and gather his thoughts, then came to stand in front of Ron--who slouched against the wall with crossed arms and a sulky expression--again.
Truth or Dare.
--where he'd left off.
Malfoy mumbled an unintelligible complaint in his sleep but Harry—blessedly—got his leg out enough to stretch it. He sucked in an inaudible hiss at the momentary sharpness of pain, face frozen in a grimace, but it quickly dulled to the sort of background ache he was used to. He allowed his head to fall backwards into the cushions of the low couch they occupied—knocking his glasses hopelessly askew in the process—and began kneading the muscles to encourage them to loosen further.
"Oh, I am about as hard to understand as it is to, I don't know... Break into Gringrotts and ride out on a dragon?"
on making me do all the work I suppose exactly as you are will do."
starts today," he countered, tapping the centre of Harry's chest with his index finger. With that, he unfastened the clasp of Harry's uniform and dove in to lick and bite at his sensitive neck.
"Why'd you never say anything about this before?" Harry asked curiously, as though he weren't presently being shagged to the brink of orgasm (even though he most definitely was). His mind had a tendency to go down rabbit holes during sex and the thoughts would become distracting to him if he didn't voice them. Ian had hated it. But Harry was eager to know. If Draco had wanted him as long as he'd said, why did he wait so long to so much as smile at him?
******
Parkinson was heading for the door, her goons following on her heels. Harry wondered if one might actually be Goyle, but the man was securely locked up the last he'd heard.
Harry leaned backwards to make it easier for Draco to lower the seat. Once they had a nice flat surface to work with, he rid Draco of his shirt and shoved him prone. Straddling Draco's thighs, he stripped off his own shirt and undid his flies (for which his newly-freed prick thanked him). Even though he knew Draco's assorted wards were thick enough to keep anyone outside from noticing them, there was still a small thrill at exposing himself out in the open like that. He palmed his prick and gave it a lazy tug. Draco's eyes watched the gesture hungrily and he flicked out his tongue to wet his lips.
Godrick, when Draco's voice went low and sultry and his smirk was all wickedly playful, Harry's libido

"What did you do?" she demanded accusingly, startling him from his musings and nearly causing him to upend half the items on the desk in the process.
Because there hadn't been an official start to their relationship--and least not one he was willing to tell people about--Harry had yet to figure out how to announce it. It had been a long time since the war, but those hurts ran deep. And the people he cared most about had been among those hurt most of all. He honestly didn't know how receptive they would be to the idea, even though Draco was a very different person these days.
A slow grin split Harry’s face and, while he couldn’t see Malfoy’s own expression, somehow he knew it mirrored his own.
He cleared his throat. "I don't know how to proceed," he admitted. "I told you before that I don't usually sleep with someone who's part of a case. Never have, actually. But your case is different from the norm because it's older." He tugged compulsively at his fringe, the weight of Malfoy's stare making him nervous.
Harry snapped his eyes up from Malfoy's mouth, hopefully quickly enough that he wasn't caught staring. The man's outfit (or, more precisely, his lack thereof) was making it rather difficult for him to maintain the cool detachment he was supposed to display in an interview.
"Look," he said, by way of both explanation and apology, "I pissed him off and now he won't talk to me and that's the long and short of it." He sincerely hoped they both could leave it at that.
Harry grinned. Drunk compliments were the best compliments, in his opinion, because they were the most honest. Draco wasn't truly drunk--which was incredible given the amount of alcohol he'd consumed--but he was certainly buzzed. His body was loose, his smile easy, and his compliments free-flowing.
******
"It's raw, but... At least it doesn't feel like I've been ripped apart," Draco replied, completely disregarding Harry's new rule. The blonde carefully turned until he was comfortably on his back, slipping an arm under Harry's neck. He kissed his forehead. "It'll be your turn next time~"
Harry thought he could do it if he put his mind to it, though he'd never tried before. Wandless magic for him was usually a simple matter of wanting something badly enough. So: Draco naked? Easy. Draco tied to the bed? A bit more challenging, but doable. Probably.
Draco shook his head. They'd give someone a sizable shock if triggered, but that didn't qualify as nasty in his book. (Although living with the Dark Lord might have skewed his perspective somewhat.) He'd seen enough of Potter in action to be reasonably sure he could handle them.
"Even better," he grinned.
one. Being a man whose teenage years revolved around destiny and fate, I am sure you'll run into that person one way or another. It might just take a while longer than you'd prefer. As for me, I had an engagement contract. Still do, technically, but considering both my actions and those of my father, the family is now (understandably) hesitant. I wouldn't have wanted to marry their daughter--a complete stranger--anyway. We are waiting to see what the verdict on that is once my house arrest is over, but I am hoping to buy them out. Which I can only do if one of our families violates the contract (by settling down with someone else, for example). It is a mess.
Harry's brows were furrowed in concentration as he entered Draco, and so carefully--to avoid hurting him, most like.  It was dreadfully sweet and certainly appreciated (Pansy and Blaise had both complained of pain after their first times).
He finished his task and went to wash his hands, back to Potter and eyes downcast as a light tinge of pink graced his fair cheeks.
Unlike Draco, Harry was pants at occlumency, but he was fairly adept at the regular kind of compartmentalization. He put aside the roller coaster of emotions he'd felt during Draco's chaotic, five-minute nervous breakdown, bottled the bright-burning anger Zabini had ignited in him (along with his eagerness to follow up on the promising lead), and reducto'd the general stress and anxiety of the evening. By the time they reached the top of Draco's stairs he was practically a blank slate...except for his eagerly blooming libido, which was given free reign.
Harry’s musings ground to a halt, his body going perfectly still even as a jolt of adrenaline sent his nerves jangling. The crystalline moment now felt fragile as blown glass. But Harry effectively did as he was told.
Ron paled slightly. He looked to Hermione for help but none would be found in that corner--she shut him out cold to do as she'd promised and pepper Draco with questions about his latest manuscript. With no other recourse, he stood slowly and slunk out of the room after Harry, who closed the door behind them with a thud and rounded on his best friend and partner.
?" Pansy laughed. A cold, mirthless-sounding thing. Whether it was spiteful or she was just being silly (as she was at times) was hard to tell, but it stung all the same. Draco's eyelid twitched.
"I'm not surprised Granger likes them. I always suspected her to be a fangirl," he smirked. "And I already knew she was a smart arse. How are they these days? Her and the Weas-ley?" He'd very nearly said 'Weasel'; he hoped Potter didn't notice. He coughed and carefully lifted his anxious gaze to the Auror's handsome face. And it was quite handsome...Square jaw, tanned skin, just a hint of stubble--he had really grown up.
"An elemental wizard." Harry said carefully.
The group went in and Harry called an elf. "We'd like some drinks and snacks please, and if the pregnant people are craving anything, could you get that too?"
Harry caught her line of thinking. “Maybe we should go to a movie…”
On his first visit, it had been too dark to notice the many different styles of furniture, not to mention the colors. There was a light wooden table with several mismatched straight backed chairs off to the left side. The hearth glowed warmly with tiles around it that were painted with sunflowers.
By dinnertime Harry held the reply recommending regular exercise and the recipe for the potion he'd been given at Gringotts.
Harry watched Malfoy’s face color as he quickly moved to kneel beside her. His eyes widened in interest.
“My cock in your ass…That’s your reward, slut,” Harry told him as he turned the slave onto his back. “I’ll finally claim you.”
Harry had a sudden desire to hold Draco but he restrained himself. “I can only recommend seeing a mind-healer. I needed one last summer and I rarely have to endure the nightmares anymore.”
"Let's start with Christmas and New Years, Dray. We can go over the rest later." Harry suggested.
"You can write to me or, since it's a special circumstance, you can call by floo or mirror that night." Harry grinned at him.
"Oh, no! What's wrong?" Harry asked, concerned.
"Draco!" Harry called; his happiness was visible.
“Think about it, you tosser…We’ve been ordered – by law – to get married before Halloween. We should write our families about this, Ron. If we don’t, your mum will send another Howler.” Harry said shaking his head at his friend. “After you get yours, she’ll send one to me or Hermione for not telling you to tell her so if we write to her first then she has no need of the howler and we don’t get humiliated in the Great Hall at breakfast.”
“Are they out of their bloody minds? How can the ministry do this? Is it even legal for them to propose a marriage law?” Narcissa asked outraged.
Draco was too busy drowning in the sensation of having Harry this close and touching his head so slowly. It was such an intimate moment, his only reaction to Harry's statement was a whimper until his lips were captured by the other boy's.
"I'll tell you if it turns into something." The blonde promised without stopping. "I really am tired. Good night." He felt their stares as he hurried past them to the dormitory.
“Harry...” Draco breathed, his jaw wanted to drop but he knew better than to show that sort of weakness to his father. He closed his eyes and drew a breath before answering. “I can honestly say that I’m touched. This more than anything proves that you weren’t raised in a pureblood household. As you know from our chat with Pansy, pureblood children grow up knowing that a betrothal contract is part of their future and that includes a spousal price. No matter what objects he has asked for... Harry, look at me - not him.” Draco walked between them, turning his back to his father and taking his partner’s hand in his. “No matter what you decide, I can assure you that I would not believe you capable of such a thought.”
“You don’t have to ask.” The blonde whispered and leaned a little closer, already remembering the last kiss they’d shared.
Suddenly the heat drained away. Wind began to whip through his hair and clouds rolled in to cover the sun. As Harry looked around he felt his anger drain just as quickly.
Everyone was in the kitchen when they arrived. Molly seemed lost without something to do but nobody needed anything so she moved the last bits of her food around the plate absently.
Harry huffed. “It’s a Ravenclaw property.”
The twins sighed. "That would be really great but..." Fred sounded choked up.
He decided that the first step was a conversation with the boy in question so he resolved to get him alone. He went down to the Great Hall and had breakfast while watching for Draco.  Harry then waited for him to eat and, when it appeared that the blonde had finished, he approached the Slytherin table.
As soon as he could clearly see Draco’s organ, Harry cast the spell to release the cock cage and smiled at Astoria, “Now then, I think a tour is in order. Draco, show me my suite…you may walk until I say otherwise,” He placed the chastity device on a nearby table with the miniature of Lucius just in front of it.
“Probably… now let’s get this over with, love.” Harry was nodding as he hugged his husband and led him to the sitting room.
Caelum pointed to the ceiling. “Altaira.” Then he flapped his arms like wings and made a whooshing noise.
Lyra and Caelum seemed oblivious to their bearer’s troubles and the adults were very happy about that. As soon as breakfast was over, Harry escorted his husband to the sitting room before taking the children and Dinki outside.
Once Draco had gone into the flames, Harry turned to Ron. “I didn’t see the actual slap but I heard it and Viktor was standing over him when I arrived. Draco stopped me from going after him.”
“You and Mrs. Granger-Weasley came up with that wonderful repopulation plan and I need you to help with this as well. She’s on her way, as we speak.” The older man told Harry.
Height: 5 foot 5 inches
Draco’s smirk showed he was amused but he played along. “Quite well, Harry. What can I do for you today?”
Hi everyone! Another chapter is here and this time it’s April. New babies will be born and there will be an update on Andy’s condition. I know some of you are having a hard time with Andy’s stroke and I’m really sorry about that.
Harry thought back. That was the night he’d relived all three dreams. “What did you see?” He asked, wanting further proof.
He took Caelum from Dinki first and then lowered Lyra to sit next to her brother. He pulled out some of the animal toys and proceeded with that day’s lesson while Draco cautiously went back to work in his garden.
“As long as it won’t transport me without my knowledge, I’ll take it with me.” Harry grinned at his companions and placed the book, scepter and cloak pin into the small chest to carry out. Then he thanked his cousin and invited him back to Potter Grove for lunch on the way back to Korlag's office.
“It’s got to be Uncle Harry!” Teddy stood and began to pace. “It’s just got to be!”
Draco
The whole school is watching you. Some are waiting to see if you'll violently snap, others if you'll drop out. You know this already. But I don't think you realize how much some of the younger ones, the Slytherins especially, look up to you. They see what I see--a chance for a better future.
Malfoy nodded thoughtfully, using the edge of his fork to saw through the sausage rather than attempting to wield a knife in his weak hand.
"Feeling better?" Translation:

within its ancient walls... At first he thought it was because he was so comfortable with Harry, before he recalled that Grimmauld belonged to the Blacks; that meant that this was one of his ancestral homes. Of course he belonged.
grandparents by the time they had him and because of that he was treated like a prince--a gift to the world at large. If he had been raised more traditionally, he might have had his bride chosen in accordance with the pureblood customs and he more than likely would have done his duty in going through with the marriage and siring a nice, high-browed pureblooded heir. But again, let's be clear, I am glad that isn't the way things turned out!
*****
“Don’t stop,” Malfoy fairly begged, twisting in Harry’s not-quite-embrace until they resembled a pair of tango dancers. Merlin, this man would be his downfall, he was sure of it.
Not sure he should be reinforcing the man's spoilt royal act, he put the baking dish in the oven as instructed anyway (feeling generous because Draco had made dinner and even done a bit of cleaning, by the look of things--it was downright domestic). He then walked over to the fridge to grab a beer.
Heart in his throat (or something; it was a bit hard to tell where everything was at the moment), he scampered--fucking
"You're on your own!" Harry shouted from the hall. He couldn't get away fast enough. Dear Merlin, he hoped Malfoy still had his trousers on when he returned. (Mostly, anyway.) Maybe he shouldn't come back. With as loopy as Malfoy was, he'd probably just sleep. How much trouble could he get into before the potion wore off?
Tell me again why you absolutely
They had a good thing going. He was in no hurry to change it.
He wanted Draco to stay.
So much for the peace effort.
Harry hesitated a moment but only because his brain had short-circuited from so many conflicting impulses (

now because I have work in the morning. Like a normal person." He shuffled under the covers with Draco snuggled in close and felt pleasantly fuzzy all over.
"Ah, yes! The holy Savior himself... You know, Draco was a cute number back at Hogwarts. Boring as hell, dumb as an ox, and a spoiled brat to boot but nice to look at. That, and he was so close to the Dark Lord. So, did you stick him yet? Dove into that unused tunnel?"
Harry wisely refrained from commenting on the tabloids one way or another.

"Is that a fact?" Harry purred, eyes glinting dangerously. "In that case, hold on and don't let go."
He had been awaiting Harry's return all day, though he would never admit it even in court, like a lovesick puppy--despite the fact they hadn't planned to meet again that night. Draco just had a feeling he would, and according to that knock he was right.
Draco shook his head and planted an elbow into the table, despite the manners so thoroughly bred into him that screamed against such action. His cheek fell into his palm as his other arm remained in his lap.
, no less) was altogether too disturbing for contemplation. A small, petty part of Harry considered breaking things off with Draco for no reason other than not wanting to have anything in common with the elder Malfoy. But that was stupid. He liked Draco and the strange thing they had going. He wouldn't let Lucius jeopardize his happiness, intentionally or otherwise.
Harry was well-acquainted with that look.
Are you trying to tell me that you're using your precious dare in some kind of charitable act of service? How droll. I'm not sure I should be taking hairstyle advice from you, of all people. It is endearingly trusting of you to ask for your dare on the as yet unfulfilled expectation that I will make good on mine, however.

"You don't know what I have!" Harry snapped, before he could think better of it (which was pretty much immediately). Leave it to the incomparable wanker to irritate a confession of love out of him.
Draco sensed something was off about Harry's apology (perhaps it was the twitch in Harry's brow that usually indicated annoyance), but he chose not to mention it. Even if he didn't feel it was fair to have to ask for a little respect after being treated not-so-well by someone who was supposed to be "fond" of him. But Harry didn't love him. Maybe there really was a difference between "love" and "fond" besides an intensity of feelings? Or maybe Draco was just being unrealistic? Or unreasonable? Or too sensitive? Was it his fault? Was it even
Harry knew Draco well enough by that point to realize his preparations would have extended beyond the foregoing of pants. With another surge of blood stiffening his already-hard prick, he tugged Draco's trousers farther and reached between his legs to confirm his suspicion--he was wet, slick with lube. Harry shuddered, arousal like lead in his belly. He teased Draco's entrance with the tip of his index finger before pushing it inside. Draco didn't tense, just sighed happily and canted his hips to give him more room.
Draco chuckled darkly and leaned close enough to his date beside him to whisper in his ear, "Very good. It
"Actually, before we continue... Where's the loo?"
Your hint is that it includes handcuffs. I've also taken the liberty of adding eye-hooks to the bedposts.
"Ha ha," Harry deadpanned, though inside he celebrated the fact Draco was thinking along the same lines as him. Mostly. (You could never be too sure when it came to Draco's thinking.) "Dating me isn't perk enough for you?" he joked.
*****
Relieved, he cast about for what they could do next, his rhythm completely thrown off. It didn’t help that his brain had functionally deserted him long ago. Then an idea occurred to him, inspired by the colourful imagery of the previous moments.
He planted his feet flat on the mattress and gripped the slats of his headboard for leverage. It wasn't perfect--that would require the use of his hands--but thrusting in the cradle of Draco's arse, virtually deflowering him but for a technicality of position, was damn close to it.
He nodded when Malfoy finished, most of his negativity shriveled up and blown away by Malfoy's honest words. He took a slow breath then blinked and nodded again--convincing himself of his reply while replaying it in his head.
*****
Draco considered it a moment. "Something powerful and majestic," he admitted. "One of the big cats, perhaps."
At any rate, the appropriate license for modified muggle items is inside and the watch has been charmed to run on magic instead of a battery (for obvious reasons).
Pausing here and there to hide in the shadows when he thought he heard voices or sensed the presence of wandering ghosts, Draco ascended the dungeon stairway. His little nose quivered frantically at the many smells that accosted his senses when he passed the kitchens. Undeterred, he crossed the grand entrance, slunk beneath the gaze of slumbering portraits, and made his way into enemy territory. He sighed in resignation (the puff of air making his whiskers oddly tingly) and, steeling himself for the worst, wormed his too-malleable body beneath Potter's wooden door.
Draco pulled the sheets and blanket off until he was completely exposed and bent his knees away from the bed. His arms stayed where they were.
. His drunken fooling about with other blokes had been limited to over-the-trousers action. Now, however, faced with Draco's very real, very present erection, he was both intimidated and intrigued.
“Try another one,” he said eagerly, breathlessly. Even though he had to squint to see, his whole body felt alive in a way it never had before...except, perhaps, for his very best moments on a broom. Every nerve, every neuron seemed completely attuned to Malfoy. Harry started to wonder what would happen if more of their skin was touching but quickly locked that notion down in one of the deepest, most secure vaults in his mind. This wasn’t the time or the place for such dangerous ideas. Not with his front mere inches from the long, supple lines of Malfoy’s back.
******
"Oh...wow," he sighed and a tired, slightly delirious chuckle escaped. He turned to stare into Harry's shining, lust-filled eyes with a satisfied smile.
"I get why you might not tell us while things were still...unofficial," Hermione chimed in (not sounding she 'got it' very much at all), "but how could you not think of us in the three months since then?"
If you know, as you claim, that I am cleverer than to have misconstrued your intent, you should also know that I would never answer so bald a question without some form of insurance that my reply won't be used against me.
*****
Don't forget the leash!
"So..." Potter began, self-consciously rubbing the back of his neck. Draco cocked his head.
"None for me, thanks," he replied with forced politeness about the apparently spiked punch. No way was he trusting any drink the Slytherin had tampered with. "I'm representing the Ministry tonight."
"Only hold my hand if you want to, I like most vegetables, I doubt you'll use any deadly hexes so I won't bother, and how did you even know I fancy her music? Not enough to attend a concert on my own dime, mind, but yes."
"Hell, just try to get rid of me."
It also made him feel funny in his ferrety bits, but that was a sensation best left unexplored. He did
Hah! Harry's triumphant smile split his face--Draco was almost stunned speechless (almost, he was physically incapable of actual speechlessness).
You know I wasn't going to ask, since you tend to be pretty tight lipped yourself, but why do you refuse to use first names when offered?
There was another bloody Devil's Snare near the wall that separated the table from the main garden. He torched it from a safe distance.
"How do we place our order?" he asked, more than ready to move on to the next phase of their dinner.

about slipping you a love potion since all my subtle attempts to get into your bed have fallen flat.
"Sorry for what? Did you drink some of the punch? I only had chapagne at the party.
Draco's head fell back against the door as his mouth was suddenly released. He was practically heaving with the need to fill his burning lungs.
, it seemed to say.
Draco tapped his foot, crossed his arms, and narrowed his eyes as he watched his boyfriend eat like a starved pig. However, it wasn't his frenzied appetite that had Draco feeling so annoyed--it was his attitude. Draco was used to Harry's less than civilized munching, moaning, and drink sloshing by now (which only happened when the man was starved, hence Draco's need to keep him well-fed)... But the nasty comment, the way he spoke as if Draco were an idiot for having never seen a "curly fry", and the way Harry didn't even bother with proper manners in way of just eating together--versus scarfing it down--was instantly rubbing him the wrong way.
Playful gray eyes met drowned, deep green and Draco nearly gasped at the sight. Instead, he sucked Harry even deeper into his mouth until the stiffened flesh met the back of his throat. He hummed loudly as he worked, sending a wave of vibrations into Harry's body.
"Don't bother," Draco said on a laugh as he leaned over and down to kiss Harry's lips as he stretched. He gave them a playful nip before withdrawing from Harry, and then the table... Still hard as a rock. Despite not being the one to have just cum, his legs and arms were a little shaky as he carefully crawled away from Harry's legs and over the edge of the table, just barely missing a stumble over the chair.
He wriggled out of Potter's grasp and jumped onto the table to draw the man's attention to his notes. Potter's eyes lit up when he recognized the leather-bound books for what they were, but his expression quickly fell when he glanced inside.
******
Draco grabbed a crisp and began to dip it with no intention of eating it.
"You never did say: how did you like dinner?"
"I didn't think you wanted me," Draco admitted. "I was only planning to flirt a little tonight, but then I knew and changed my mind."
Rubbing his fists against eyelids that felt like sandpaper, Harry reckoned he was hardly any better than the people who'd rushed to accuse him of every wrongdoing for so much of his life: the Dursleys; the Press; the wizarding public; Malfoy, once upon a time; Snape (though his reasons were more complex). For all that they had made his days a living hell, they'd at least had
Harry snorted. "You'll just have to read it and find out," he answered for his harried boyfriend with a cheeky grin. (Charlie and Fabian stayed together, of course; they always did in Draco's novels--'juvenile wish fulfillment,' he called it.)
"I know it hurts," he murmured, meaning the bone-deep ache that came from physically pushing oneself as Malfoy had done. As he'd been instructed to do. "That'll get worse before it gets better. But it does get better, in time." Small consolation in the midst of it, he knew. He pushed a hand through his hair, regretting his inability to offer comfort of any value.
He didn't think he was imagining the bashfulness in Malfoy's tone--it seemed Hermione had been more right than she knew. Harry's stomach gave a wobbly tremor at the thought.
******
"8:50 if you want to sleep as long as possible," he answered pragmatically, trailing light fingers on Draco's side. "8:30 if you want that bacon. 8:00 if you want to work up an appetite," he suggested, tone laced with innuendo.
He had reached his limit.
, his possessive id supplied. He did his best to ignore it.

...Except when it's nice. Like now.
He repositioned himself so that his legs were curled over Harry's clothed hips and squeezed, his arms held stiff above his head.
"Where should I mark you...?"
******
Draco complied with a smirk and Harry shifted between his legs, kissing his way down. Draco probably expected a blow job--Harry'd discovered he was something of a natural and liked doing it besides--but he had something else in mind. He pushed Draco's legs up higher and further apart, exposing his sweet pink ring.
). When it finally processed what the man had said, he leapt to comply.
, all while remaining intrinsically good. It is a unique combination of qualities and I find it alluring.
Draco gasped as his clothes suddenly disappeared (perhaps he should have expected that?), but the minor shock of being nude disappeared as his lips and neck were dominated by Harry's attentions--easily walking back and falling onto the bed with the fully clothed Auror on top. His hands, once his brain began to function again, grabbed for Harry's top and pulled him into a rough, mouth slanting snog with his tongue already slithering inside.
What's the status on the case?
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and hugged him close.
The announcement was met with another round of shouting and swearing. Everybody spoke at once--
"Tell me," he prompted, "what was it you had planned for the Garden before those stupid plants mucked everything up?"
I've known it was you since the letter before last. There has only ever been one person who calls me "prat" as if the insult were a playful petname. Usually I am labelled "git", "tosser", "traitor", or something far nastier. (That, and your scrawl went from anonymous but controlled penmanship to very familiar chicken scratch over the course of your missives.)

Potter,
Midnight tonight. Be ready.
Harry'd been breathlessly transfixed as Draco settled himself between his legs, but his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he loosed a desperate groan when his aching prick was palmed.
He hoped not.
"So good," he breathed, locking eyes with Draco. He was bloody gorgeous with that fall of hair swinging loose in front of his face and lovely lean torso on display. Harry wanted more of this, more of him. He'd barely even had a chance to see his cock.
Harry tried to remember all at once everything that had ever been done to him during head, dividing them broadly into the categories of 'like' and 'don't like' so that he could attempt the world's most perfect blowjob.
' and tried to strike me with it. He was small and scrawny, so it was easy to wrestle the thing away. The whole event only took a few seconds. He ran after that."
A part of him wanted to hold back, to break the man completely, but it all felt so bloody good, the psychological factors so unbelievably arousing--Harry Potter was begging him to come while wearing a ball gown at his command!--that his own orgasm was a looming inevitability.
******
Harry snorted. In a blink, he shoved Draco's legs out from under him and flipped their positions so he was the one on top, pinning Draco's arms above his head.
******
"I can't wait to see what noises you'll make," one lubricated finger slowly began to slip into Harry's entrance, "when I have my fingers in you."
They arrived at Draco's dungeon lab quickly and without difficulty. Unfortunately, getting inside would be another matter--the door was still locked tight.
"Two?" he asked breathlessly, almost trembling. "Three? Whatever you want. Just tell me."
Draco released one hand from Harry's side in order to fist his own cock. There was almost no lube left on his right hand, but he wasn't about to pause or interrupt Harry in order to grab the lube or conjure more (the wand had fallen to the bed beside them.) He tried staring down at Harry to catch his eyes again as his hand began to stroke in time with every hard thrust, but it was impossible to keep his gaze steady.
Ordinarily, he wouldn't go into the office on a Saturday, but he didn't want to let the waitress lead go cold. So he disentangled himself from Draco, who grumbled and cocooned himself in the blankets. With a chuckle, Harry made his way to the open doorway he assumed led to the bathroom, scooping up his wand on the way.
Draco turned to look directly at Harry as he hugged him a little closer, until he nearly had Harry at too awkward an angle to walk properly. An older witch stared in shock at them as they passed; two oblivious young kids ran excitedly into a shop without noticing them, though their parents certainly did; and at least two shops turned their signs over from "Open! Come on in!" to "We're Closed!" upon recognizing Draco. He was a little surprised they would also block their own savior out, but Draco (with a deep sigh) supposed some of that was to be expected.
Or did you think you were being subtle?
The idea of

Harry's brain felt like treacle, his back muscles throbbed, and there was a vague buzzing in his ears but, all told, he was really quite content. His limbs were heavy and warm, his lust sated. Oh, and Draco Malfoy was in his bed. Spooning up next to him, in fact. And Harry couldn't be more pleased.
Draco flexed his hips firmly against Harry's as he ground down. His cock was completely hard and aching in no time.
"Nn, so aggressive," Draco sighed and lifted his knees to his chest before opening them wider. "Merlin, yes... I've been waiting all day for it."
Draco
"Make love to me, Harry," Draco whispered, wanting to kiss him but not wanting to move--in case Harry grew annoyed enough to stop.
"Merlin, take a breath, Draco," Harry chided, shaking his head fondly and doing his damnedest to catch up with the out-of-control carriage of Draco's thoughts.
*****
Draco's head fell back firmly against his lounge chair and his hands left his thighs and instead drifted upward to grip the Auror's shoulders and behind his neck. He gasped and bit his lip as he was slowly fucked until he was nearly ready to beg for Harry to speed things up (and he called Draco a tease!) before being impaled completely by a strong thrust and ground into.
Sarah, thankfully, was only too happy to allow him the use of her phone--she'd never seen him so ruffled (and that was saying something considering his recent preoccupation with a particularly rufflesome individual). Harry promptly called the police to report suspicious activity and took great satisfaction in spying a harried-looking reporter scuttling off some twenty minutes later, after having been questioned at length by two brawny bobbies (who were none too keen on grown men leering at unaccompanied schoolchildren). Back to whatever hole he crawled out of, Harry thought smugly.
"Are you joining us?" Harry asked.
“I’ll only go as far as the gate.” She offered. “I want to talk to you for a moment.”
"That’s wonderful, Luna." Harry laughed. “Will you show me?”
"What?" Sirius asked pausing to look at Harry's face.
Harry kept his amusement at Viktor’s gullibility hidden as well as possible. That feat became less difficult as he watched Viktor land beside his fiancé and scoop him up into a tight squeezing embrace. Draco was barely submitting to Viktor’s attention and once again he flushed with color when the bigger man released him. Harry was getting more and more disgusted with Viktor’s actions. He cleared his throat and thanked Viktor for a vigorous workout once again voicing his regret that Draco couldn’t join in. He shook both their hands and left while trying to suppress the urge to take the blond and run.
“The Malfoys do visit often to see Draco and the twins…” Harry interjected hopefully.
Draco’s eyes closed as he reached forward to touch Harry’s hair. “Don’t say anything, Harry…hold me?”
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
“And this?” Harry asked as he lifted Draco’s legs and stroked Draco’s bare ass. “Who owns this magnificent ass?
He tested the temperature on his wrist just the way the Healer had demonstrated before placing the nipple to his daughter’s lips.
“C’mon, Draco,” Harry squeezed his husband’s shoulder lightly. “If they sent you a letter like that, would you take the potion again and postpone your training or would you destroy the letter?”
George led the way past a group of younger students to the hearth. "It's over here. Oh, no! The fire is lit!"
"Perhaps someday soon we can go on a date." Harry smiled at the blond. "Are there any suitable places in Hogsmeade or will I have to search the bylaws for a way to take my betrothed out to eat?"
Silence reigned for a moment and then Draco stepped up next to him.
Sirius stood up and changed into his animagus form.

"Harry?" Ron rushed past Zack into Harry's room. Stopping abruptly, he looked around and blinked. "This...this is nice. Bit like the townhouse..."
NC-17
"He and Macmillan stole her socks and shoes while she was wading in the lake and then hid them in the castle." Harry told him. "I didn't witness it."
Molly was happy to see Harry and thrilled to hear that one of the twins had been named, but she proceeded to nag the couple from that moment until they left. “Be sure to name that boy before the new year, Harry!” she said. “You know, Draco-dear, if he isn’t named soon he’ll not feel welcome in the family!”
“I understand. It may be for the best if we wait to separate them.” Lucius sat beside his son-in-law, giving in to the desire to see Harry’s face as they spoke. “I also wanted to alert you to a new worry.”
“Do you want to see my bloody Gringott’s statements?” Harry glared and repressed the urge to draw his wand. “Yes, I can afford it! Now, can we please stop talking about my finances?! Merlin! Now I know how Julia Roberts’ character felt in Pretty Woman!”
“No, love, but he told me he was going to.” Harry smirked.
“You’re so beautiful in your obedience, Draco...” Harry said softly. “Bring me the dangly jewels and I’ll put them on for you.”
Harry swallowed Draco's essence with a satisfied grin before whispering into his ear. "You taste delicious, Draco."
Harry nodded.
Draco sighed and grimaced. "Well?"
Lucius seemed about to argue with him but they were interrupted by another knock on the door. It was Draco’s mother.
Draco fell quiet and just listened. If Harry thought he’d fallen asleep he might keep going with these lovely words.
“Well, look what me and the Malfoys had to go through to understand each other.” Harry said. “They had to explain some things and I had to demonstrate some points of my own before we both came to a common ground. What if these unhappy couples only have a communication problem?”

"Alright. I think I’ve found some words for this occasion." Draco mumbled breathlessly as he stared at the thing that could’ve left him floundering as a simple wizard rather than a mate-less part succubus Dragonlord. "You fought this thing? At twelve years old?"
Harry peeked around the corner and watched the crowd glare at his intended.
Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly before answering. "I know that I love being with you the way we have been. I think you look amazing in all of the masculine clothing you wear. I don't know how I'd feel if you wore a dress or something like that but I think the g-string could be pretty hot."
Harry hissed quietly.
"Ziva?" Harry called.
“Did Ted ever try to learn his form?” Draco asked.
"Yes." Draco said, blushing softly.
Ron nodded in a distracted worried manner. “Yeah. She’s always got ideas, mate.”
Once safely on the ground, Harry confessed his entire plan. He’d researched the café and arranged for the children to stay at the Manor. With George Weasley in on it, the store in France was set to be an available landing site for the two fliers. The elves would have dinner ready by the time they reached the Portkey which had been specially reserved for them to return to Nettlestone Estate and after that Draco and Harry would retire to their bedroom for the rest of the night.
“I hid that book in there back in sixth year!” He said as they watched Al take an eye-dropper and dip it into the potion.
Harry's jaw dropped slightly. "No way! That's just an illusion spell?"
“Eighteen is the age when you’re supposed to be free to make mistakes and find ways to fix them without making even more mistakes.” Draco added. “It’s the age when kids are free to leave the confines of one school but enter into the school of life so they can be taught those lessons that can’t be learned from a textbook.”
“Anyway...I made lasagna tonight, boys.” Hermione grinned as she cut into the pan and served up the food.
Harry internally awarded himself a point and went for a second one. "Oh, I'm sorry. Should I have used your self appointed title?  Very well, Lord Moldyshorts."
Dumbledore eyed them and glanced at Remus as they were all startled by the door opening to admit Tom and the black shaggy dog form of Sirius Black.
“I don’t care who I heard it from. I’m so happy for you, guys!” Harry stood up and hugged them both at once.
Suddenly Harry’s arms were full with a pregnant blond. “Harry! I’m so glad to see you!”
They mounted and all of Draco’s fears melted away. He felt Harry cast the Notice-Me-Not charms and waited for his husband.
Harry smiled thinking of Hermione's tendency towards that behavior. "Loch Ness is a definite possibility. Anything else?"
"Great! There's a new coffee shop in Hogsmeade." Harry told him excitedly. "Dean gave me a bite of the fudge brownie he bought there last Hogsmeade weekend."
Draco frowned, taking note of the breezy room and barely-there rumble behind his partner's words. “How are you the bad guy if you give him what he wants?“
"There is being a spell." Roody said in a hushed tone. "If spoken by a wizard in a human tongue, it enslaves the elf and they has no recourse, but if an elf speaks the spell in the old tongue, it is a bond."
As they were getting ready, Harry helped him remove his clothes and made sure the bath was more on the cool side even though Draco usually liked it warmer than that.
“He did, Harry, but not for another three levels.” The blond man smirked appearing slightly rueful but Harry could see the disappointment and bitterness behind the Malfoy mask. “I’ll have to do review for the whole ten months or so of the pregnancy before it’ll be safe to continue. At least this time I can brew the potion without having to worry that there’s something mixed in.”
“I hope you’ll send word of our condolences to the Weasleys, Harry.” Lucius cared little for the Weasley family as a whole but he could acknowledge that this event was a tragic loss. “Is Draco as affected as you seem to be?”
"It's late." She said, touching her son's cheek before turning to Lucius. "We should all be abed by now. Take the next few days to think about things and see what happens at the meeting."
“It smells sweet and musky...it smells like you, Harry...” The blond’s eyes shined as he looked up at his husband.
“Wait, this is for you.” Harry said quickly handing the rosebud over by the stem. “It’s a courting gift…”
Zack reacted visibly as well as verbally. "I only have a single good friend among my year mates, Lord Potter. As none of the Weasley brothers are taking the offer, I'll have the room to myself."
Harry took a deep breath and turned to face the future. He strode purposefully through the castle and nodded approvingly to Roody as he stopped at the door. "You've done an excellent job caring for Raven's Roost. Keep up the good work and I'll see you at Hogwarts."
"I've eaten." Draco shook his head. "Good day, Lord Potter."
Draco looked down at the floor for a moment before looking back at Harry, but he still said nothing.
Draco gasped and instantly began to strip down to nothing.
"They were animagi!" Harry whispered theatrically with a smile.
Harry took this in. “We are certainly not normal teenage boys.”
“Hello,” Pansy said, smiling at the boy when he held his arms up to indicate his choice to be carried by Harry.
Harry narrowed his gaze. “It’s not nice to stick your tongue out, Ted.”
"Well, there's only a few things that it could be." Blaise attempted to comfort him.
“Huh?” Harry asked as they fluttered around him. “I don’t understand. Like the headmistress said - I’ve met them before and…”
Sirius hummed thoughtfully in the background as Remus replied. "But if he told you that, does that mean they're abandoning the idea of hiding it?"
“We’re searching the common room now so he doesn’t surprise us tomorrow.” Draco said, throwing a shirt at his friend.
Harry tried to laugh at that but it came out as a whimper.
Finally understanding, Harry paused to think it over. Teddy was old enough for his own room if he wanted it. That was true, but would that make the boy feel alone in his new family? There wasn’t much more than a year between Teddy and the twins so maybe he could just let the boys share a room while Lyra shared with the new baby. She was so sweet with her dolls and the newborn babies in their circle. Perhaps if he told her she was needed to help while her baby sister was still little… “I’ll speak with Draco about the matter a little later.” He turned to look at the little boy in the small bed at the far end of the room as Lucius picked up the little Malfoy heir.
“Is Dinki to be fetching-.” the elf began.
The map came to life with a flourish. Harry smiled and turned to see the office where the headmaster was in conference with the heads of Hogwarts houses. Filch was in a hallway not far from the potions lab while Madams Pomphrey and Pince were in the staff common room.
"I see." Harry chewed his lip. This was getting more and more interesting. "So what you accidentally 'let out' is just what 'type' you prefer...?"
“The Pregnancy potion, the stomach calming draughts, and the pre-natal nutrient potions?” Harry breathed. He’d long known that Draco was a smart man but the more the blond revealed of himself the more Harry loved him. “I know we were making some of that in classes but you learned the potion that grows the womb?”
“Into the Whomping Willow.” Harry nodded ruefully. “Ron and I had no way of getting to school or back to his house. No way to contact the school to tell them what had happened ...and I was so used to figuring things out by myself because my aunt and uncle really only cared about Dudley.”
"Professor, before we start, I'd like to say that I appreciate you using my title in public... but in private, please feel free to be informal with me." Harry told her, quietly using his fork to cut his flapjacks. "You're my head of house and you know me well and you knew my parents. I don't want the title to come between us."
"Indeed." Lucius clenched his teeth for a moment and turned to his son. "Dare I ask whose dreams you saw?"
“What do you mean?” Draco frowned.
"I don't question your loyalty, Moony. I don't believe you'd act against me if you were given the choice." Harry explained sadly. "His magic subverts your loyalty. Once you've been cleansed, I'll be able to trust you with all of my secrets. I promise."
"Yes. Now, Hagrid wouldn't hurt a fly so it had to be the old buzzard. The heart of the matter is..." Harry took a deep breath and stated his concern. "Everything he's done makes sense - from talking my father out of accepting the barony when he was alive to his disturbing interest in me. It all makes a twisted kind of sense...but only if he knew of my ancestry..."
It wasn't long before he was in his London townhouse, hugging Sirius.
Harry asked the snake.
“Potter?” Draco Malfoy asked, his eyes widening. “Make yourself at home, why don’t you?”
"Alright." Harry smirked at his godfather. "I reckon I can live with that."
The brunette smirked, catching onto his husband’s plan. “You’re trying to make it difficult for me to stick with your punishment! It won’t work.”
Sirius nodded slowly. "Good plan, but what if he asks for a contract?"
“If we sign this, you will instantly get that wish…” Harry smirked as he sat and prepared to scratch his name on the contract. It was an old fantasy of his to have Draco Malfoy at his mercy. “You’ll no longer have most of the privileges that come from being the Malfoy heir.”
Dean bit his lip hard to suppress his shock and amusement. "All I'm saying is to give it a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised. It'll give you something to do on your off day tomorrow."
"What?!" Draco asked, startled.
“I know…but today I want you to prove you can obey me and I’m telling to prep yourself properly for my cock.” Harry was leering at the blond as he finally began to carry out the task he’d been given. “That’s a good boy… I can see your pink little hole …Now, I can see your finger moving in and out with the lube…Add another finger…” Harry licked his lips as Draco’s second finger joined the first. “Add the third now…That’s enough. You should be properly stretched, so come over here and ride me.”
“Night...” The other boy murmured in response but he slept as soon as his head hit the pillow.
"Yes. He's one of my most loyal followers so it didn't work. You see, Regulus came to me and we devised a plan to get him far away from England." Tom nodded. "Dumbledore sent him to retrieve the locket and he led the bastard to believe he was going to bring it to him but he actually placed a fake locket before faking his own death."
“What if you take me to Hogsmeade? That way, we can shop for everyone but each other and then meet up with some of our other friends later so I can get your gifts and you can get mine.” Draco’s silver eyes sparkled as he took some melon into his mouth.
The blonde chuckled. “You’re not trying to buy me off with gifts are you, Harry?”
“Don’t you think that’s a bit excessive, Harry?” Draco frowned at his husband.
“That’s all I can ask,” Harry whispered, kissing the blond on his cheek.
“That’ll come in handy, Dragon. Thank you so much!” Harry told his husband.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Harry frowned, “I’m fine, thanks.”
Harry's wand was out in the next breath and he dreaded seeing aurors at the other end but it was only Vernon and Petunia so he lowered it quickly.
Harry nodded in bemusement and grabbed his trainers as the other man led the way to the kitchen. "I suppose I really shouldn't be surprised the house is yours. Your son has that white blond hair, after all... and the name Scorpius really should've tipped me off."
"Don't be ridiculous, Blaise. Malfoys aren’t cute in the least.” Draco grumbled but had to admit that Harry’s reaction had been nothing short of adorable. “Good night, Blaise."
Harry sighed and confessed. "I was here too."
"Black with bronze fittings outside and yellow and blue for the inside." Dudley told him.
“I hope it’s alright that I assumed you’d enjoy being in proximity to your friends…” McGonagall said with a smirk.
“Harry, I...” Draco sighed as he stood.
Draco blushed. "I don't advertise my sexuality, Harry. I'm out to my friends and family, but the public at large doesn't need to know until I find the person I want to be with."
It wasn’t…It was the palest shade of blond with a very light strawberry kiss and just the slightest hint of a wave.
Harry didn’t know why he did it but he obeyed the blond without question, lying flat on his back on top of his coffee table. He shifted nervously as Draco stood and straddled him. He moaned lightly as he felt Draco’s tongue lick a wide stripe up his chest and knew he couldn’t take anymore. This would be the last one.
“Oh! I’m so glad you brought that up! I’ve wanted to ask what names you’ve been considering.” Narcissa interrupted.
"Students! Young people!" The Headmaster gestured for everyone to settle down and asked them to find seats so the sorting could begin.
Draco entered a few seconds later and stopped short. "Your special hot chocolate?"
“I will…and hopefully he’ll let me kiss him again.” Harry blushingly told them.
“Money isn’t everything, Ron! Money, fame - it doesn’t mean anything unless you use it properly... to help people.” Harry took a deep breath to try and calm down. “The people I want to help are my friends and family. For goodness sake, Ron, I’m one of your bloody connections! Sirius is a viscount! He’s among your connections too! They're really starting to add up! Honestly, right now, the only good thing about my being a lord is that I don’t have to put up with rude, ignorant arses, if I don’t want to.” Harry turned and walked out of the room. He was down the stairs and into the floo before anyone in the house knew what was happening. “Potter Grove!”
“Kingsley. It’s good to see you. I’m sure you remember Ron and Hermione, but this is my intended.” He picked up the blonde's hand and smiled as he made the introductions. “Draco Malfoy, this is Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister for Magic and my very good friend.”
Harry nodded, “Yes, but you were an authority figure for him. You were someone he failed to please while you were alive.”
Before she finished the second sentence, Harry was halfway through the door. He stopped at the foot of the bed. Draco looked drained and pale but he was beautiful and alive and holding their children so Harry let relieved tears flow down his face.
“This is a complicated potion, so I made it for you. You will learn it next year sometime.” Al told Draco before explaining to both of them what it was. “This potion will ward the walls, floor and ceiling of the potions lab as well as the tables and a special robe that Draco has earned by passing the first of the twenty stages in his training. It renders whatever items or surfaces it is applied to fireproof as well as waterproof. In fabric, it protects from rips, tears and stains. It will also block the fabric from absorbing any substances. It never needs to be reapplied to a surface once it goes on.”
"Please excuse me for being presumptuous, then, Professor ...but I have a theory..." Harry interrupted, chuckling as he triggered a secret door by lifting the book. An ancient mechanism could be heard as a panel shifted to allow passage into a steep spiral stairwell. "Perhaps you'd like to join us?"
Draco rushed into his mother’s arms as soon as she opened them and Lucius Malfoy barely controlled his sneer in Harry’s direction. “Mr. Potter...I believe we have you to thank for getting Draco away from that abusive brute he was going to marry.”
Astoria stood and motioned for him to do the same. She approached him slowly but when she got close enough her hand found purchase on his clothed member which was indeed soft. She’d been with men before so she knew just how to arouse them...or so she thought.
“That's strange." Zack broke into the conversation. "If he was raised anything like I was, he wouldn’t have thought twice about seeing his sister married off for such a reason.”
The blond responded instantly, moaning in want. “Touch me, Harry; please?” Draco whined, grasping at Harry’s shoulders.
"On the coast of Kent there is a private Hufflepuff estate that can only be accessed by boat or portkey. I believe it is a castle but I have never been there myself to verify this." Korlag pointed to the area near Margate. "Then there's Denbigh Friary in Wales but that was donated to the muggle government by Hufflepuff's magical descendants before your mother was born and designated as a historical landmark. The government graciously allows the Hufflepuff name to remain on the deed and you will be allowed to visit for free but the ownership paperwork is not valid in the muggle world."
Silently the brunette gritted his teeth and began to dress in the Quidditch robes he’d brought along. Once he was completely outfitted, he took a small box from the pocket of the denims he’d been wearing. It held his broom...the latest model of broom to grace the skies...the Lightning Bolt. The name - surprisingly enough - had nothing to do with him...it simply moved faster than a Firebolt. He lifted the miniature broom out of the box, used Wingardium Leviosa to let it hover in mid-air and then a quick enlargement spell to return it to proper size.
"It's another female." Harry grinned. "She doesn't have a name yet."
of you, Viktor. You know I love watching you in the air.”
Draco gasped as he sat down. "You didn't!?"
Harry grinned as he slid the robe off his shoulders. “I want your mouth on me, Draco. Suck me.”
“Then we’ll just have to continue in here…won’t we?” Draco gasped as Harry’s mouth played along his shoulders again. “Mmmm, Harry!”
"Yes, Mr. Malfoy." She answered.
"Nice to meet you all official like." Dudley stood and offered his hand to shake. "I'm Dudley."
“Hogwarts...as if it had been damaged. As if its foundations were...” Draco trailed off shaking his head.
It was after that wedding, that they found themselves alone on the Astronomy Tower…
“Yes!” Draco panted. “Harry, please?”
“Mmm! More!” Draco commanded breathlessly. “I need to come!”
Draco reflexively scoffed, denying it but he saw hurt in the brunet's green eyes as he sipped his coffee.
Harry snorted as he took it.  "Of course. We'll go to my room on the way to dinner. By the way, I told Sirius and Remus about the snake...after she left."
Harry's eyes narrowed. "Draco can show us where your suite is, Andy."
Harry nodded thoughtfully.
Draco struggled not to show his amusement as he returned to his seat just in time for the dishes to disappear.
Harry chuckled which drew Scorpius' attention and caused the little boy to throw something in Harry's direction. It turned out to be one of his other books. Pictures of Hogwarts castle and grounds delighted the older man but when Harry tried chatting with the tyke a little more, Scorpius just wasn’t interested. He got little more than the boy's age before he gave up. A small sigh escaped Harry as he flipped through the pictures a few more times until he heard footsteps in the hall. Harry couldn’t have been more surprised as he stood up on the nearest pillow.
"It may have escaped your notice, but the man is a powerful wizard in his own right." Snape glowered. "He could've made them himself or bought them."
Harry was happy for his friends and wished them well but, since he and Ron had yet to fully patch things up, the twins' presence would be missed.
“Not that I’m unhappy to see you, Kingsley, but you weren’t exactly expected.” Harry frowned cautiously. “What did we discuss at our last meeting?”
The Malfoy-Potters decided to check in with their friends as soon as they could. Draco set his soft fleecy blanket on the chaise lounge, which had been brought from Nettlestone and then joined Harry for the walk down the hallway.
Christopher hurried to his wife’s bedside and scooped up her hand as he started to whisper to her.
“It doesn’t matter how you knew what to do, Harry. All that matters is that you did what he needed you to do and he’s alright.” Narcissa kissed his cheek and went back into the nursery.
“I’ll believe you if you tell me it’s true.” Harry promised.
“Of course.” Susan blushed and dug into one of the drawers in her desk. “I’m sorry to be such a chatterbox! I just haven’t heard from many people in the last year or so because I’ve been in America getting to know his family.”
Draco blushed but it was ignored as they were suddenly bombarded by Luna,
She whined, “Do I have to?”
Harry gasped. “Wow...This is so neat...Hi baby...I’m Harry.”
“Are they?” Harry frowned. “I was never around any infants as a child or teenager.”
"Wait!" Ron's face twisted in confusion. "Did I miss something? What about the dream? No before that - whatever happened with the thing in the water?"
“Most twenty year olds don’t have the means to buy an apartment let alone their own house.” Starla commented reasonably while shaking her head.
Harry grabbed his hand and said, “Ok.”
“At least let me come with you. I can protect you if he tries to harm you again.” The brunette gallantly offered.
Harry looked around in wonder as the ‘door’ closed behind them.
“Yes, yes, Xeno vouches for them and I spoke to Arthur at the ministry today.” Lucius hummed. “He inferred that his allegiance was faltering...I wonder if it has anything to do with Potter.”
“Potter in public...” Draco felt a flutter in his chest. “Harry in private?”
Zack nodded once and continued his conversation with his friends Ernie and Justin.
“That’ll be them…” Harry said as they heard a knock. “Looks like I’ll get the chance to tell them very soon, Headmistress. Draco, I’ll tell them right now but you should probably not stand that far away from me in case Ron gets…well, you know how he gets. Oh, and please, don’t provoke them?”
“Nothing…I just missed you.” Draco mumbled and just like that it was as if someone had flipped a switch. Draco’s silver eyes seemed to darken into anger as he pulled away sharply. “Is that allowed? Didn’t you miss me?”
Parents: Lucius Hyperion Malfoy and Narcissa Annalisa Black
Draco smiled. “I’ve got a bath being prepped and you needed to wake up anyway.”
“Do you want to know what your reward is, Draco?” Harry asked while nibbling on the other man’s earlobe.
Draco lifted his head to whisper, “I could’ve ended up with someone like McLaggen. I didn’t want to miss the chance you offered me. You desired me and you wanted love which meant, to me, that you were the best chance I had of getting a pleasant life. It remained to be seen whether we could love one another, but I had hope and it all turned out rather well. Didn’t it?”
As soon as the door closed behind them, Harry was at the dressing room curtain. He reached out to touch the curtain but it was hard and immovable. “Draco, are you okay? Baby, come out. The craziness is all over.”
We at the Ministry congratulate you and your family on the outcome of the Malfoy trials.
******** ******** Chapter 13 ******** ********
“Da…Da” She said softly as her hand lightly tapped his pale cheek.
“Can we get back? Pansy whispered to Blaise. “We left all those books!”
Malfoy looked as though this pleased him. His expression didn't change, per se, but there was some subtle current beneath it that Harry picked up on.
Why the hell would anybody pay for rubbish like this? Who wants a bloody
******
"I mean, it's a bit soon, isn't it?" Nervous hands clutched at his trousers. "I was thinking we might do a bit more of the stuff we did earlier. There's no rush to--" He interrupted himself with a gulp. Muggle-loving Merlin, he felt like a stammering teenager. It had been some time since he was shy about sex, but this was new to him, too.
It was understandable. Having spent years apart, of course all Harry knew was who Draco had been. He hadn't had a lot of time with him as he was now. Still, Draco had hoped...
Happy Christmas!
"I'll tell you one thing," Draco declared, panting slightly in his effort to keep up with Harry, "the management is getting an earful. There is only one way Devil's Snare could have gotten past their security measures and that's through the staff."
Draco was forced to let go of Harry's cock once he slid back. He wasn't so far he couldn't have continued his stroking, but it would have been difficult to undo the laces of his trousers with his hands in the way. Draco braced them instead on the arms of the chair.
He didn't date within the workplace. Though that severely limited his options, he was a firm believer in keeping his professional and personal lives separate. Just because he hadn't recognized the man didn't mean he didn't know him--that was rather the point of the masquerade, wasn't it? After 13 years, he knew just about everyone in the Ministry, even if most of those relationships were limited to polite smiles and greetings in the Lifts or at the Floos.
"Only if I want them to mount a rescue effort," Harry countered with a grin, pressing his chest into Draco's and wrapping his arms around his waist. "In this case, I am a willing hostage. But if you think to try anything funny," he warned, mostly (but not entirely) joking, "don't forget that I am the Head Auror for a reason: even with all the dark and mysterious artefacts at your disposal, you couldn't hold me against my will."
, he added in his head without bothering to hide the sting of it (unvoiced to avoid an argument). "Whatever. Let's just--"
Fortunately, the department was virtually empty at that time of day so Harry didn't have to explain the absurd predicament he found himself in. He leaned Malfoy up against Robards's mantle and took a pinch of Floo powder from the silver dish.
*****
"Just this morning," Harry confirmed, coming to stand by the settee (not so close he could spot the dark grey flecks in Malfoy’s pale irises, but close enough to discern the spice of his cologne—impeccable professional boundaries for someone currently in the private residence of a patient he’d harassed into inviting him in, Harry thought sarcastically). "Called you her favourite patient and everything. Clearly you can be charming when you want to be," he joked, without thinking better of it. He wasn’t sure if they were back to joking yet and he worried how Malfoy would take it as soon as the words left his mouth.
"What is your relationship with Zabini, Parkinson, and Goyle like these days? Have any of them acted differently toward you since the incident? What about leading up to it? Whose idea was it to go to that club?"
The ropes might have been too tight. Harry may also have felt some unease about being bound while Draco possessed his wand. He didn't know one way or another because everything in his head became white noise when Draco slid against his prick.
"This isn't nearly hot enough," he complained. In spite of his words, he began to scrub his now golden hair instead of attempting to fuss with the taps. He did spare another glance towards Harry's dripping body, though. He openly leered and his lip was once again caught between his teeth.
"You hungry?"
He blushed and turned away.
Malfoy's eyes wavered. Harry guessed he wanted to check him over for visible disability but for whatever reason the Slytherin held the eye contact instead. It both compelled Harry to speak and made it harder for him to do so.
I'm sure you're missing me to bits. Never fear, darling, I'll be back by your side before you know it.
"You make an excellent point," he retorted mutinously, turning to face Potter and crossing in his arms over his chest. "You barely lasted two minutes with my mouth. Why should I go through all the trouble of letting you fuck me if you're going to finish long before I'm through?"
Harry wanted to punch something.
"I..." He began with an audible sigh. "I guess that answers that..."
Draco opened the fridge to grab a drink of his own. As Harry was lacking anything "frou frou", he settled for making tea instead. He set the boiler on the range after filling it with water and used his wand to light the fire beneath.
Draco stretched his nude body out until the sheets and blankets fell away from his feet and torso. His toes straightened, his back arched, and arms circled his head. Draco turned his attention back to Harry and smiled.
******
"Apparently I judge everything harshly. Just ask--" Draco shook his head before he could finish that thought and instead huffed a laugh. "How can you be so talented at blow jobs and fingering, but utter pants at something as simple as hand holding? Honestly!"
"Not--Nn...! Not that I'm complaining, but... Wasn't it supposed to be... Me sucking you? Or did you change your mind about--holy fuck, your tongue! About... What I offered earlier?"
That way madness lies.
He looked down at his body, pale but flushed, and darkening by the moment. He wondered what Draco would think of it.
"Impossible not to love," Draco replied, batting his eyelashes coquettishly.
They made an odd pair. Not just at dinner, but in general.
He would have gone so far as to stop Draco's busy hands, but his own were unwilling to cooperate at the moment.
Harry's generous invitation did much to lessen the disappointment of not getting to see him that evening.
Draco smiled through a deep, guttural moan as he was finally penetrated. His back had arched to meet his first trust, but the pleasure of his prostate being bulls-eyed was not what caused the burst of warmth nor the stretch of his lips (as pleasant as that was, and it really was.)
Harry
Malfoy looked calculating. "What about all that vacation time you threatened me with earlier?" he retorted blithely.
Harry held himself up on his forearms, core flexed, so he could watch.
“It’s really quite impressive,” Malfoy continued. “A vibrant red from the tips of your ears all the way beneath your collar. How far down does it go, I wonder?”
Hermione, bless her heart, had offered to come with him, leaving Ron at home with Rosie for the evening. But Harry hadn't wanted to expose her to this crowd--even if the word mudblood never crossed their lips, it would be clear as day in their disdainful sneers and limp-wristed, reluctant handshakes.
we're shagging--I'll be much more likely to be swayed by them when we're through.
Harry snorted. "Where's the poetry, Draco? Your characters speak so romantically to one another and all I get is weirdly violent come ons. I'm feeling deprived."
Instead, Draco served himself a dainty amount of squash, fresh rose salad, sweet butter shrimp, and neatly sliced baked lobster meat.
Draco chuckled. The amount of lube Harry conjured was far more than needed and almost covered his entire hand verus a dollop into his palm. The blonde felt rather smug about putting the Auror into such a mind scrambling position as to not be able to concentrate on a simple spell.
"Does it hurt?" he asked solicitously, rubbing Draco's flank with a still-tingling hand. He had hoped that between Draco's dubious wank toys and all the foreplay that evening they'd avoid that outcome.
Laughing breathlessly, slightly giddy, Harry took Draco by the hand and pulled him along, mounting the steps two at a time. When they reached the end of the hall, he hustled Draco into the loo and shut the door behind them.
Unlike the chocolates, I made these biscuits. And there's a loose-leaf Darjeeling to go with them. Good for the four o'clock slump.
He followed Draco's lead and turned to the menus. When he saw that there was one devoted exclusively to chocolate, he wondered if there had been any validity to the story Ron told earlier about one of Draco's suitors being dumped over his disdain for the confection. If so, it was fortunate for him the chocolate lava cake was calling his name.
******
No longer sticky with spit, sweat, lube, and drying come, he straightened his clothes and attempted to coax some manner of style into his hair, giving it up for a bad job after a few pointless tries.
He'd learned Draco well enough to know it wasn't genuine. For whatever reason Draco had felt the need to set his feelings aside, maybe even with Occlumency (Harry was beginning to worry he did that far too often to be healthy), and that made him feel like shit.
*****
Later that evening, after Harry had bid his apologies and goodbyes to the pinched-faced celebrants, the bloody suit had been banished to the floor of his wardrobe, and a generous amount of firewhisky had been poured and consumed, he climbed into bed to unwind with a few chapters of the latest trashy romance he was reading.
you've slept off that draught and we're no longer in the place where I work."
Dear Draco,
Malfoy flexed the fingers of his right hand, curling them into a loose fist and then relaxing it, appraising the range of motion and his control as he did so. The damage to his nervous system was readily apparent (his fist neither closed nor opened fully) but he had enough muscle control that he should still be able to perform most day-to-day activities in Harry’s opinion. With enough practice and care, he’d seen folks do incredible things with less—amputation situations and the like. People were infinitely adaptable, it seemed, when they had the proper mindset.
Draco panted through his nose as he was kissed. He thrust his tongue as a diversion into Harry's sweet mouth (made even sweeter by the desserts they had consumed)--slanting his mouth and lapping at his tongue. Draco's free hand slid into the Auror's hair and tugged gently.
Draco bucked up from the counter into Harry's hand. One hand caressed the edge of Harry's jaw while the other stayed in place about his neck.
Is this something you really want? It can't be taken back once it's done.
I appreciate your discretion vis-a-vis certain matters involving myself and an unsolicited potion. Needless to say, I am utterly mortified by my words and deeds these past few days.
, and Draco knew it, the sly devil. Merlin forbid someone like Kingsley walk in on him in a compromising position. He would never live it down!
Draco released the headboard when given permission. He grabbed for Harry's shoulders and pulled him down into a longer, tongue delving kiss--nipping his lips before pulling away and laying back down properly.
Over and around the deeply visceral experience of breathing in a cloud of Potter's sex--Draco's pink nose all but vibrated in its frenzied sniffing (quite against his will)--were the noises.
"Nmph... So, what did you plan for after?"
The unexpected turn in conversation was a bloody minefield. He didn't want a perfectly good evening--perfectly good after the woefully inadequate assassination attempt, anyway--to end because Draco said something offensive about his friends. But then, they would have to talk about them sooner or later if this...whatever it was...was ever going to be anything more than shagging.
scoop, Potter. That is what I do every time. You will note that I have never been in a hospital-mandated quarantine despite our regular exposure to all manner of unsavoury individuals and situations.
He hoped that by the time their reservation rolled around he wouldn't look still so thoroughly shagged.
"It was just my prick," he replied, setting the breakfast tray on the foot of the bed and sitting down next to it. "I'd thought you rather well aquatinted with it before last night. But I can get you a potion if you'd like."
******
Honestly? You're smart, clever, calculating, brutally honest (sometimes a little
One chapter left!
Harry groaned and twined his tongue with Draco's for a single, deep kiss, pulling back after a few seconds to talk.
Draco was in the kitchen and the smell of dinner (Italian?) filled the house. Harry's spirits were immediately lifted. He bounded down the steps and found Draco in nothing but one of his old, sauce-splattered aprons, draining pasta over the sink.
With a final wet slurp and a playful swat, he released Draco's cheeks and kneeled at the foot of the bed, retrieving the abandoned bottle of lube. He unstoppered it and poured a generous amount into his hand to coat his aching member, pressing the extra into Draco's hole with two fingers when he was done.
*****
Draco undid the final button and allowed the robes to slip off his narrow shoulders. They pooled around his waist, obscuring his arousal. "That will do, Gieves," he announced in a lordly tone. "Please send your bill by post. It will be paid in full, with a handsome bonus for your impeccable professionalism."
"Are you sure you want me to pretend?"
He locked eyes with Draco, opened his mouth and twirled his tongue around his fingers, pulling them in and sucking lewdly. He maintained eye contact while virtually fellating the digits, even when he wordlessly summoned his wand to conjure lube.
He opened up the dinner menu and was overwhelmed by the options.

******
Draco took his time exploring the depths of Harry's mouth. There was something spicy on his tongue--from lunch, perhaps--that urged him to lap and suck greedily in an effort to identify the mystery flavour. After a few (ultimately unsuccessful) seconds, he released the fleshy muscle in order to stroke Harry's gums, teeth, the roof of his mouth, finally twisting their appendages together until saliva pooled.
"You mean the bright red ones with your name stitched into the pocket?" Draco asked as he pulled out the end result of his labors and put it on top of the range to cool. He turned to Harry and smirked. "Want to make your claim as official as possible? Or do you just like tormenting me with red? It's my least favorite color, you know, and not just because it's a Gryffindor color... Red looks terrible with my complexion."
Harry felt ill.
"Told you," Harry replied with smug satisfaction, taking another crisp for himself.
Luckily for the owl waiting outside, Draco's windows had small sun-setters jutting out at least a foot over the glass. He jerked at the hinge and admitted the somewhat soggy bird.
"What do you mean my handholding qualities are terrible?" he demanded, affronted, as they walked along the street. "I held your hand the whole time before we got our food, even when Mike pulled a face."
"I know I am," Draco replied with a short chuckle after a long, recovering sigh. He ran his fingers through Harry's sweaty, mussed hair. "That reminds me; you told me once you found sex boring. I never asked you if you still feel that way. And remember I am a Legillimans so I will know if you're lying."
"Well," he said, turning to leave for the second time, "Goodnight, Malfoy." (He'd considered adding a 'nice to see you,' or something like it, but that wasn't true.)
"You know, the case?"
*****
Harry's eyes fell unbidden to the way Malfoy cradled his right hand like an injured bird, and he noted the slight list in what was once perfect posture.
"Of course you were."
Before Draco could answer, he whisked them to the apparation point for The Royal Albert Hall. The itinerary for the evening was a private box viewing of Mozart's selected works, with dinner provided by the Coda. It had cost a pretty penny but Harry thought the investment worthwhile after Draco'd been such a good sport about all their cheap dates.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Okay, first of all, that wand wasn't even supposed to be returned to you. It has a close association to the Elder wand, so just be happy you got it back, all right? That took quite a bit of Ministry string pulling to do, git.
Godrick, I'm so bored. Hermione sent me five puzzles and I solved them all today. All five. I have been that mind-numbingly starved for entertainment in here
I do happen to think that spectacles are sexy, particularly the thin-framed ones you've been sporting recently. And you possess a couple of necessary traits that Ms. Granger lacks for my tastes. Mr. Longbottom, on the other hand, is more well-suited, but he is missing the edge that sets you apart. You are powerful, challenging, exciting...
Well, whatever it was, he liked it.
Ron was never as early as Harry. He had a growing baby at home and a busy wife, which meant he dealt with morning nappies and a trip to his parents' to drop the tiny girl off before work. Fortunately, his partner never seemed to mind; especially not when he brought treats. Today he came bearing a basket of muffins his mother had made, which he presented with a flourish.

Regarding my father: no one is perfect. He is no exception. Having seen some of Severus' memories myself, it is a wonder he turned out the way he did in the end. I wish I could have known the man he became. It's a bit strange how you seem to be following in his footsteps without ever having known him. Stranger still to realize we are almost as old as he was when he was killed. I can't believe he and my mum were already settled down with a baby by the time they were my age. Godrick, I'm a long way off from that!

Harry's wand was poised to defend but he needn't have bothered. The moment Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dumber set finger to the ropes lashing Parkinson tightly to the spot, new ones leaped forth and bound the men in place. They howled in agony as the white-hot anger with which he had imbued the spell felt like it was burning into their flesh (though it was only real in their minds).
******
Draco groaned under Potter's bite--it was sharp enough to sting, but the pain mixed exquisitely with the pleasure roiling in his gut.
What cinched it for you?)
Malfoy's answer was dry and dispassionate--he'd obviously recited the list before. "Uncontrollable muscle spasms particularly in my face, sporadic involuntary neck and hand movements and/or tremors, rigidity in some muscle groups," here he held up his right hand for Harry's inspection, "numbness and tingling in my extremities, loss of balance, occasional shooting pain."
"Harder, I'd say," Harry responded with authority. (He was the world's foremost expert on the topic.)
"I better'n like you," Harry slurred, smiling inanely and enjoying the warm, boneless feeling suffusing his body.
*****
Poor sod.
"As far as I'm concerned," he offered, leading them down the path, "this date isn't over unless you want it to be. I need a few minutes to be an Auror since your case just went from cold to active, but as soon as I've got this sorted, we can go back to your place or mine, you can have a shower, and we can pick up where we left off. How does that sound?" he asked with a winsome half-smile.
Harry sighed. He leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs at the ankles. "Look," he said, more seriously now, "he could decide he's no longer interested for any number of reasons and so could I. That's the nature of dating someone, isn't it?
to get him out of his jumper if push came to shove. Plus he was eager to get his hands on that lovely, pale cock.
"Could it have something to do with you punching Blaise Zabini last night? Or the several kissing, arm crossing, hand holding, or cuddle walking pictures? You're all over the paper--front page news," Ron spoke in a tone between angry and amused. Angry because he felt like this was somehow Malfoy's fault (bad influence, that one) and amused at the idea of uppity Zabini having his egotistical face smashed in.
Several hours, case files, and cups of tea later, a barn owl that was unfamiliar to Harry silently glided through the open door of his office and landed on his desk. It stared at him, equally silently, with its weird, slanty face. He stared back at it with a vague sense of unease. (He liked most owls; barn owls were the notable exception.)
Anyway, it's nothing to get your knickers in a twist over. My relationship with Angie is purely professional.
"I'm more of a show-er than a tell-er," he replied with a smirk of his own. He stood and extended his hand to Draco, tugging him out of the chair and into his chest. He planted a firm kiss on Draco's lips... then led him up four flights of stairs to his bedroom.
Harry smiled with relief and dug into his unorthodox breakfast.
Draco
"You need to be entirely sure," he growled, tilting Malfoy's head back with the grip on his hair and angling his chin with his other hand. He licked a stripe along Malfoy's puffy lower lip then sucked it between his teeth for a gentle(ish) nibble. When Malfoy's mouth dropped open on a moan, he thrust his tongue inside once more.

on top of it," he said cheekily. "But I'm versatile. We can do this however you fancy if you'll just let me run a couple of diagnostic spells first to make sure you are in your right mind." Merlin forbid they do the deed, only afterward does Draco come to his senses.
"You're alright…for an aristocrat. Not so much for an Auror. But then, I didn't want you as my partner for your sense of style."
"I'm glad you haven't realized you deserve better yet. I'm honestly not ready to end this.
He looked around at the few passersby who paused to gawk or scowl. It seemed that what caught their eyes first was the odd couple of blokes out for a stroll, and it was only after a double (or in some cases triple) take that they realized just who those blokes were. He ignored their stares as much as he could while remaining on high alert for possible attacks.
His snapped his mouth closed with an audible clack, his face shuttered as if it had wards of its own. He then slammed the door hard enough to rattle the hinges. It rang with justified finality as a shimmering curtain of magic flowed over the Manor's exterior.
friends,
For a brief moment, Harry worried about his own balance as the world seemed to tilt on its axis. He decided to go set up the next exercise and use the time to clear his head. It was suddenly rather difficult to string two thoughts together standing that close to the object that had been dominating them of late.
With that, he sashayed over to the writing desk, swaying his hips exaggeratedly before bending forward to offer his arse up to the man. "Let's see what you've got, Potter," he smirked over his shoulder.
*****
"Well, Pansy and I still frequent her favorite restaurant every other Tuesday... When she's in the country. And Blaise comes by to visit once a month. He's pants at wedding planning and his mother is on her fifth (maybe seventh?) husband. So he's been busier than normal, but that's understandable... Gregory, I haven't actually spoken to for years. We left on fairly decent, if not awkward terms. I mean, how do you salvage a friendship after... After what happened?"
Draco chuckled and slowly licked the edge of his mouth as he stared into Harry's bright green eyes. He put down his dinner menu and replaced it with the one filled with chocolate delights.
Draco thrust up against Harry's straining erection, effectively silencing his wayward thoughts and crumbling the last of his meager resistance.
"I better not see any details of this in the papers, mind," he warned, "or there won't be a second time."
"You know, your health
"Tell me if it's too much," he said as he pressed the head of his cock against Draco's entrance and watched as the reddened glands popped inside.
"Was that when you stopped going out?" he asked quietly. (The question wasn't truly pertinent to the investigation but his curiosity got the better of him.)

When his eyes finally returned to Harry's, Draco was feeling particularly smug--and not just because his potential boyfriend and first true lover was incredibly good looking. Harry was staring at him like he was a steak to a man half-starved (which he rather was at that point, given their interrupted meal).
He dropped to the floor, grateful for the plush rug before the hearth providing his knees with a cushion and radiant heat from the fire to keep him warm, and lifted the hem of the dress to reveal Potter's lovely prick once again. It was by no means massive, but it was more than adequate for his purposes, with a pair of close-shaven bollocks to match.
"Ok," he answered eventually, when he was sure he could speak. "But why?"

Harry goggled.
******
Harry wished it had been an accident. Maybe then he'd feel less guilty.
It took a solid minute for Draco to regain his footing. He took a long, though quiet, breath and closed his eyes--counting to ten as patiently as he could. Once composed, he swiveled on the spot to face Potter again.
. I'll help you look for a culprit, but I refuse to suffer for one of those gits."
Replicating as precisely as he was able the motion that had made Draco cry out before, he gave him hard and fast. The way Draco moaned and writhed and thrust against him spurred him on, even when his fingers began to cramp and his forearm burned with the effort.
We are flatmates. And you know the Ministry likes this arrangement because they secretly (not-so-secretly) want me keeping tabs on you while you're still on probation. And as far as I've ever been aware, you can hardly stand me most days. And sex is a big deal!
Draco,
"There was a lot going on!" Draco hissed back as he knelt down on the floor on the other side of the bed and watched Harry over the edge. His eyes were wide and wild and his body shook with panic. He was damning every deity, and of course himself, for allowing his work and Harry and moods and
*****
******
He took a long swallow and plopped into his seat, swiveling around to prop his feet up on his desk. (If his body posture was relaxed, maybe he'd stop feeling so bloody tense. That was the idea, anyway.)
Harry didn't attempt to deny it. He knew it would be no use.
Ron sighed, but nodded.
Unable to come up with a proper reply, Harry let the pregnant pause expand to fill the space, hoping it would eventually dissipate enough for them to move on (much like the awful ringing aftereffects of a
He laughed. "Guess I'm not a princess anymore, eh? Though I admit, I think I look sexy with long hair... Then again, when I am not?" There was plenty of mock snobbishness behind the smirk he sported. "So, my not-so-charming knight, what did you have in mind? And yes, you're still a knight and I still expect to be protected if a dragon comes by. Or murderous plants. Speaking of... Have you ever heard of the Tentacular? Curious new sex toy for the tentacle fetish. It's based off the Devil's Snare, of all things!"
Draco was more than a little disturbed he could discern that fact from scent alone. Potter's unique aroma was the only fresh one in the modest set of rooms, which meant there was no one else with him, and the thick, cloying smell of sex absolutely permeated the place.
Draco returned to his vacated spot on the sofa and curled into a non-threatening position (not that he could convey much threat even if he tried). He figured the best way to approach Potter would be to let the man find him first.
There had been more than a few anxious hours, particularly during the first day, when he had feared he would be stuck with emerald green for the rest of his life.
Draco smirked against Harry's cock as he reacted to his first prostate massage. Draco found the delicate bump again and pressed while taking Harry's full length again--sucking and swallowing as hard as he could without digging his teeth into the skin (some digging was inevitable, but he didn't want it to hurt.)
He rutted against Draco, relishing in the feel of his equally hard prick, and snogged as if his life depended on it.
*****
Draco turned, keeping his hold on Harry's hand as he walked to the door.
******
Draco quirked a brow as his legs were lifted and spread apart. He knew Harry wouldn't do anything untoward, like suddenly penetrate him, but there was a leap in his stomach of anxiety none-the-less. He gripped the headboard above him tight, and then nearly ripped one of the bars out as his sensitive bud was suddenly tasted.

The paraphernalia has been burned.

, he replied haughtily, doing just that.
Sorry your mum didn't take the news well. I guess I can understand why given her upbringing, but I still think it's shitty. It's a small blessing I didn't have anyone to disappoint like that. ...Besides the Weasley women.
"Just so we're clear: I'm not saying no, but I can't make any promises about my ability to perform. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
"You have some nerve," he spat (complete with actual flecks of spittle), "to come in here claiming fatherly love, only to turn around and try to buy off something that makes your son happy, something he freely chose, and which he is the only one who gets to decide is no longer wanted." His hands shook with the effort it took to keep them at his sides.

"To new horizons and pleasant surprises," Draco replied at last before taking a long sip. "Music, dinner... You nearly have a perfect trio event set for the night, but even without the dancing this has been wonderful thus far... And I am very much looking forward to everything. Including this Mozart. I may have heard his music before, but if he was muggle then I may have simply decided not to bother remembering his name... It was how I was raised, you know."
Lemon and sage.
Draco sat across from Harry with his own plate and took a few minutes to settle in. The balcony itself was kept well-cleaned, despite its minimum use, with ivory chairs and table. The railing was covered in ivy that reached from the ground to the roof. He spared a few seconds for the backyard before turning his gaze back to Harry--studying his face and smiling at the slight awe he found there.
******
Thank you for the best Christmas we could have asked for.
Draco's body went rigid and he came, hot and wet, in Harry's hand. (Not the first time and hopefully not for the last). The muscles of his arse spasmed around Harry's prick, triggering his own release and ripping a harsh cry from his lungs.
Potter,

She hadn't even dignified him with an answer when he exclaimed, "You knew?" Just an enigmatic smirk and a continuation of her lecture.
"You know what they say," he replied, panting still and peppering the side of Draco's face with kisses. "The best way to overcome a fear is to face it head on. We'll have to do this again. More than once, probably, if you're as traumatized as you say."
Draco walked to his couch and dropped face-first into it with a "fwump".
A muscle in Malfoy’s cheek began to spasm. Harry ignored it. A niggle of doubt began to gnaw at him but he ignored that, too. It was just like a Slytherin to use misdirection and guilt to shift the blame. How many times had Malfoy used that very tactic in school? Too many to count.
Harry noted that Malfoy kept his hold on the door handle and made no move to invite him in, belying the quirked smile at the edges of his thin lips. For all his casual air, he seemed ready for conflict.
You've got yourself a deal, sugar lump.
he visited that afternoon.
He nipped the edge of Draco's jaw and then his lower lip. Propping himself up on his arms and gazing down into Draco's wide-blown pupils, he asked, "What now?"
He should go. He could ponder the entire odd visit once he got back to the office. It was rude to linger after one's host had departed.
Malfoy pursed his lips. "I couldn't care less what you choose to do with your time," he answered testily. Harry resisted the urge to snap back, reminding himself of his surlier patients and the calm, helpful demeanor that usually worked to deflate their bad attitudes. "If you would please refer me to another clinic with a high caliber therapist
Draco groaned as began to quiver as his thrusting became tighter, faster--little staccato thrusts indicating he was close. However, he didn't want to come before Potter--and to that effect he slid an arm from Potter's sweat slicked hip to his sticky cock and squeezed.
"They're not the nicest people, but they wouldn't. Why would they? Why did Greg, even? We haven't spoken since the fire, not really, but he's not a killer! At least not..."
On the ceiling above, all over the ground, and in every possible nook and cranny there was some colourful and exotic plant or flower to be seen. Draco was careful not to trample the delicate blooms, but equally intent not to be easy prey for his pursuer. The warmth of the garden was already leaving a thin sheen of sweat on his skin.
I'll tell you who I am, but I'd like to continue the letters if that's all right with you. I have a tendency to put my foot in my mouth when I'm on the spot. This way lets me gather my thoughts better... especially when Hermione helps me compose my replies.
"Well. All right then," he replied simply, eager to move on. With a lopsided grin, he added, "She did a good job on your hair."
He sent a patronus to Savage requesting an investigative and containment crew come to the restaurant post haste. He then marched to the back of the house demanding to see management. Amidst gawking patrons, a harried-looking wizard with an absurd pencil mustache rushed out to meet them.
P.S. You may not want to drink and write. Seems dangerous
Harry was furious.

"This public date was your idea, don't forget," Draco murmured seductively just before he was brought into a long kiss. "I wanted to make sure whatever I wore tortured you the whole time. No unwrapping anything until after dinner and a walk around... I haven't been there in years and want to browse.
"I'll still want you to come in to the Centre at least once a week," he said, business-like, once Malfoy's spasm had passed. He set a bundle of resistance bands next to the rolled-up rope ladder as he did so. "I can't bring the large machines in my pack even with the all the modifications Hermione's made to it. And you should keep up your appointments with Nancy, as well. You know she's loads better at OT than me. Plus,” he added, finally turning to face Malfoy fully and propping his hands on his hips (looking for all the world like a scrawnier, swarthier version of Molly Weasley), “she's worried about you."
"That's fair," he replied in a deliberately even tone. "But they

"No," he sighed. "It was intentional."
"Blaise used to ask me to watch when he would have sex. Kinky bastard, that one. Sometimes he and his partners would use toys. He likes men and women, so that was actually how I discovered I was gay... I didn't care to see breasts. I also walked in on an orgy in the common room late one night when I wanted a snack from the kitchens. The Slytherin dorms were home to quite a bit of debauchery."
In hand.
Draco came out with just 15 minutes remaining before their reservation, wearing a set of light-weight pale blue robes. He ran a hand through his hair to smooth it one last time, quickly shutting his bedroom door before descending the short staircase.
It is as simple as that.
"Did you now?" he rumbled lowly, holding Draco's hands down by his head and looming over him with a predatory smile. "Is that why you're always needling me, then?"

And still you didn't come up to me.
natural, by all rights, it was anything but. And to share such a connection with Malfoy? That was downright terrifying.
"I have to admit that I wasn't expecting it to be anything incredible or earth shattering, but it certainly has been. I'm very lucky."

Draco pulled back just a hair and nipped Harry's bottom lip after taking a few gulps of air.
*****
And I may own one or five pensieve memories of individuals who polyjuiced as the two of us for such sex industry things. I must say, it only proves how much we belong together--which is certainly not the product of a potion, my darling, cuddly, fluffy haired Gryffy-wyffy!
Harry was certain he didn’t imagine the malevolent glee in Malfoy’s tone. The bastard.
He set to work righting upended bottles of ingredients and retrieving lost articles from the floor. Draco was content to sit on his haunches and observe, but with a sudden bolt of panic he yipped at Potter to warn him off of touching any of the tacky dried potion.
Malfoy's expression said plainly he didn't believe that was possible.
. "Gaelic?"
******
"Too bad," Draco murmured before he moaned and twitched with every wave of heat that hit his stomach and quickly raced its way to the tips of his fingers and toes.
With great effort, he pried open his eyes to peer blearily at Draco as he tried to process his questions. "Just you," he mumbled eventually, reaching out to wrap an arm around Draco and tug him closer. He tucked Draco's head into his neck and nuzzled his hair, practically purring like a kitten. He wasn't ready for bed, per se, but a nap wouldn't be remiss...
Draco stood and shed his robes. What he wore underneath was a significant improvement in Harry's opinion. The shirt and slacks were somewhat reminiscent of their Hogwarts days but the colors had always suited him. The waistcoat, however, distinguished the outfit as that of a man rather than a boy. It emphasized Draco's long lines and slim waist and lent an air of sophistication to the ensemble. Harry wanted to pop the buttons open right then and there.
Harry arrived at the grand entrance of Malfoy Manor after a long ten minute walk from the gates (which had to be opened by a house-elf). He knocked once, shifting from foot to foot before the dark, looming door. He was in his usual torn jeans, faded trainers, a simple half-zip green shirt, and a rough leather jacket, waiting impatiently (as he figured it would be an age before it was answered).
~Harry
His stomach chose that moment to growl loudly. He hadn't actually eaten lunch. "That's my cue to call it quits, I think," he declared with a self-deprecating half smile. "You have been helpful. And absolutely maddening, let's be clear."

Draco
"That was just a preview," he warned Draco after releasing him. "I want to finish my dinner."
"Hurry, Draco," he urged, voice rough and ragged. "I don't need foreplay. I need your dirty, sexy mouth making me forget how to breathe."
Draco wrapped the arm squeezing Harry's hip around his neck and into his thick forest of hair. He gripped it like a lifeline without tugging on it to avoid hurting Harry. His hips meanwhile thrust back onto the Auror's cock and then forward into the tight hand that held him.
*****
Rather than pushing his hips forward again (since that had only earned him a teasing brush of fingertips the last time), he thrust his arse backwards into Draco's crotch.
Dear Potter,
******
As Draco walked carefully through the crowd he noticed a familiar mop of black hair, coupled with a perfect blend of bored and annoyed that could only be one person: he had just spotted Potter. It was a long shot (he was certain he would be recognized immediately), but as soon as he caught the Auror's eye over the crowd his smile widened and his silver eyes flicked in appreciation over Potter's body. He lifted his glass and sipped, lightly licking his lips after without breaking contact.
With a kiss to the tender spot behind Draco's ear, he removed his hand and carelessly wiped it on the sheets. (They'd need washing when they were done anyway.)
He was probably right. Harry fumbled with the door handle, grinning, and struggling to support the both of them.
"So, dress on or off? For our plans for the rest of the evening, I mean," he purred, pressing his torso and hips into Draco's, rubbing their cocks together once more.
The process, to those unfamiliar with it, appeared rather simple. He closed his eyes, tapped his wand on his temple, and dragged what appeared to be liquid (or gas?) away like a string before quickly depositing it into the bowl. Taking a memory required a lot of concentration, and not just on finding the memory and creating it into some form of "solid", but also on holding that memory while casting the magic to pull it out. Once it was in the bowl, Draco took a step back and waved at it in invitation.
I will be playing seeker for one of the teams this year. It would be a treat to fly against you again.
At least Harry was getting out of the office on time. He hadn't heard a word from Draco (not that he expected to). He hoped he was still home.
He wasn't certain how to sign it. Ordinarily, he would use 'Auror Potter' but that seemed overly formal. On the other hand, 'Harry' was way too friendly.
"What?" Draco asked to be certain, after swallowing what was in his mouth to avoid any disgusting displays.
When Malfoy started talking, however--laying the cards out on the table for Harry to do with as he pleased--he found the will to place his hands in the other man's to reciprocate the trust that was being placed in him.
you can manage to remain conscious this time. I would require a great deal of sweet talking, however.
As for the rest of the incident that we are quite thoroughly finished talking about, I don't know what you remember taking place and I don't care to discuss it. I have more substantial disappointments from the past to occupy my time. Case in point: the Ministry's persistent belief that I am a dangerous criminal. Thanks for bringing that up, by the way. That was right chummy of you. You should be happy to note I haven't committed a single crime in my three whole days outside of your watchful and virtuous gaze. Perhaps I truly am rehabilitated and ready to return to polite society.
The draught worked wonderfully. Draco's body had no immunity to the potion, having avoided the stuff nearly all his life, and the result was obvious. He stretched himself out in a style reminiscent to the time Potter had come to visit: arms sliding above his head (his tight shirt riding up), legs spreading out with toes straightening, and his back arching high. After the stretch, he leaned forward and pinned the Auror with a sultry smile.
"You're ruddy impossible to please, you know that?" Harry returned with the same tone of (mostly) fake irritation. "Here I am venturing out of my comfort zone for you--on short notice, I might add--and I'm expected to, what, grovel at your feet for introducing me to this fine dining establishment?"
Harry stewed.
. But in a good way.

"What time should I be up?" he asked with a roll of his eyes. "And before you say anything else, I might not trust you alone in my apartment either, so not to worry." He pat Harry's head the same way he would to placate a small child.
Ignoring his ambient embarrassment, he put the uneaten soufflés in the freezer and the dinner leftovers in the fridge. He binned Draco's uneaten portion even though he would have saved it had it belonged to Ron or Hermione. He wasn't sure why--obviously he wasn't worried about Draco's saliva given all their snogging, but he still felt weird about the idea of saving Draco's food for some reason. Maybe it was due to his certainty that Draco never kept leftovers.
The memory thankfully ended, and none too soon. They were dragged back to the present where Draco made a show of shaking himself out, as if exiting a pool or warding off a chill. He scrubbed a hand through his long, blonde coiffure (already disheveled from when he grabbed at it during the memory without notice.)
Draco was bloody gorgeous. And, Merlin, he gave as good as he got, driving backwards and impaling himself on Harry's prick. Beads of perspiration gathered in the dip of his back and between his shoulder blades, making him shine. Harry curled himself forward to lick Draco's spine and sink his teeth into his skin. Draco whined, searching for something as he met Harry's thrusts.
He racked his brain to try to place the man by his body shape and gait alone since many attendees had gone so far as to change their facial features with glamours. He seemed familiar, but Harry couldn't place him.
"The tortellini was magnifique," Draco purred. There was a light tinge of color across the bridge of his nose. Behind him still sat three empty bottles of champagne, most of which Draco embibed alone. He lifted his free hand, sans glass, and caressed the jaw of his date affetionately. "Have I told you yet how hansom you look? Glasses, no glasses..."
The whole affair had not been terrible. Granger asked questions Draco was far too happy to answer that caused Weasley and Harry alike to choke on their food or drink--mainly about Draco's take on several different toys, favorite sexual positions, and hot spots along the male anatomy. Granger claimed research, but Draco suspected it was revenge on Weasley. Either way, his once non-existent affection for the bushy-haired woman rose a few quarters in Draco's books.
There was a small, polite smile on his face as he nodded and vaguely interacted with the crowd. Apparently a few had gone the extra mile and changed their hair or eye color--was that Unspeakable Jones with green hair? A few guests even looked as if they could be related to Draco with the white-blonde they chose to sport. It might have been annoying, had it not offered the perfect opportunity...
Draco set the table as he was told (with a few huffy complaints about "too sexy for such plebeian chores" and "you're lucky you're hot" as he did so). He even folded the napkins into lovely origami swans and set them beside the plates as Harry served, not missing the fact the Gryffindor sampled a bit of dessert without offering to share, the sneaky bastard.
Like by taking off his coat and standing to properly settle it over his chair. His top clung to his neck, but didn't entirely cover his collar-bone and certainly not his shoulders. His chest was dressed, but his back was most assuredly bare. Draco even purposely made sure to turn enough to flash his pale skin at Harry as he took his sweet time adjusting his coat on his seat before settling back in.
is true."
"I'm not lazy," Harry argued, crawling over to retrieve the lube as ordered. "I'm just easier to please than you." The phrase 'high maintenance' came to mind but he daren't give voice to it while Draco was positioning himself on his hands and knees with his arse on display just for Harry.
He took up his usual spot on the mismatched furniture--the comfortably worn armchair adjacent to the sofa--and spent the better part of the night exchanging increasingly outlandish theories with the closest people he had to family. By the time Hermione begged off somewhere after midnight owing to an early case before the Wizengamot the next morning, they were nowhere nearer to solving the problem.
He cast a tempus charm. Half four--the sun would be rising soon and he was completely knackered. The adrenaline wore off long ago, as did the three cups of strong black tea he'd drunk to keep himself going. He felt hollow, heavy-limbed and brittle. He looked back at his paperwork and decided Ron could deal with it, along with whatever else might come up.
Draco moaned softly as he climbed into the tub and sank into the hot depth below the layer of bubbles. His head lolled back against the tub as a cat-like smile stretched over his lips.

Harry was already done washing but he'd be a fool to turn down an offer like that. He faced the rear wall and ignored the shadow of unease he felt turning his back on another person. Although he trusted Draco not to harm him--and wasn't that a novel thought--he didn't like not being able to see or anticipate what might happen to him. In this case, though, he had a pretty fair idea of Draco's intent and it was something he wanted. Rather a lot.
to look.
"Why would you want to change? You look good." Harry replied, leading them onto the busy street.
like that.”

Dear Sender,
"Open the door, would you?" he asked, slightly breathless and unwilling to risk dropping Draco in trying to do it himself.

Unsurprisingly, the en suite was large and the amenities lavish. He spent a moment to look around, then took his usual spartan shower, marveling at Draco's multiple shower heads and colorful assortment of soaps, lotions, and Godrick knew what else. (They were going to have to shower together in there soon...maybe even that night.)

Another crashed that sounded like the bookcase falling over.
"The loo is down the hall to the right," he added over his shoulder, assuming Harry would want to wash up, as well.
"I wasn't sure you'd follow," Harry admitted from his hideout behind the door as he snagged Draco's shirt front and pulled him in for an aggressive snog. He was riding high on adrenalin and lust, the executive functioning parts of his brain temporarily disabled. Draco didn't have a chance to get a word in edgewise before their lips crashed together, masks bumping, tongues twining, each man making his own breathy noise of victory. He pinned Harry against the cool tiles of the wall--a welcome respite for his overheated skin--and Harry opened both his mouth and legs wider in invitation. He'd had a shitty couple of months. This was exactly what he needed without even knowing it.
His body seemed torn between wanting to let go of everything in passive surrender to Draco's mouth and clenching in rejection of the foreign object probing somewhere it didn't belong. His arse didn't hurt, which he was glad of, but the experience wasn't exactly pleasant, either--Draco's finger felt invasive and unwelcome. But the man had bloody well come on Harry's fingers so there had to be something he was missing.

"Yet, you don't mind flaunting it," Draco said with nothing less than absolute approval. He didn't bother to help with removing his own shirt, but Harry's? He grabbed Harry's T-shirt around the collar and ripped it open with another self-satisfied smirk.
of you," Draco demanded softly.
You really divulged things Weasley doesn't know? How? He's been practically glued to you since you were eleven! I am honestly astonished.

Harry stepped chuckling out of the loo to thank Draco for his poem, but he was exactly where he'd left him--in his pile of blankets and pillows, asleep by all accounts.
