"Sorry," Draco said quickly and sighed, "I don't want to play the guilt card, but I do think Bellatrix's anger helped me learn my lesson." He suggested. At that, Andromeda's ire seemed to melt away and she pulled him into a tight hug. Draco hugged her back, feeling any residual anxiety from the past few days automatically leave him as he clutched at the sleeves of her dress with a deep breath. "I didn't mean to worry you." He whispered.
“Is he our cousin?” She asked, quite bluntly. Draco blinked. Excuse him? Why was this eight-year-old asking about familial relations? Fleur glanced over at him.
“If I give you the stone,” Draco said slowly and swallowed numbly, “You would be restored to full power?” He asked. Voldemort nodded. Or, well, tried to. It was a bit hard given he was stuck on the back of someone’s head.
"That's my magic baby," she said and glanced at Draco, "You know him?" She asked. Draco nodded. "You trust him with Teddy?" She asked. Draco considered and then nodded again. "Alright then. You can hold him, but you put that thing away." She added with a nod towards the gun. Jenkins immediately set it down before bombarding poor Dora with questions regarding magical babies and why Draco couldn't also change his hair color like she could.
“Why do you care?” He asked her after a few moments of silence, “They are clearly idiots. Potter didn’t even want to be my friend.”
“What was I doing wrong?” He asked and gave a mocking attempt to get back into position, “My hand was here and my other hand was here-”
“Yeah, we have to.” Ron said pointing at Harry with a firm nod. Draco turned to Hermione for help, but she seemed to also be mulling over Harry’s words. Right. This was too much for him.
“You’re so weird,” she said and then glanced at Draco again, "Um, maybe you go ahead, Sadie. I need to talk to Draco for a second." She said. Sadie's eyes flicked her over before giving a small nod and patting the side of her arm. Draco waited until she rounded the corner before turning back to Zoe.
“Funny coming from a cheater.” Ron told him as the memory faded, leaving them back in the dormitory. Harry scowled at him as Draco turned to lightly shove Ron.
Not needing to be told twice, he grabbed his bag and slung it over his shoulder. He paused at the doorway, turning back to Umbridge with a long look. Could she really bring him to his mother? She could be using him to turn against Harry. Umbridge smiled tightly at him and he gave a curt nod, hoping he hid the mixture of emotions on his face well.
"Oh, good," Draco nodded, "That gives me time to come up with a rhyming scheme and everything." He said and Harry rolled his eyes. "Fair warning, it's going to make you cry." He said. Harry let go. Something about it left Draco's fingers tingling.
.” he added. Sirius gave an odd look at that, lips thinning for a moment before giving a slight shrug.
“Well, maybe I like Harry because he looks like Theo! Did you think of that? No, because you’re stupid.” Draco snapped back childishly. “And don’t act like you haven’t liked Ron forever! Need I remind you of your Yule Ball argument?”
"Draco, we both know you're the only person who can talk me out of it and... there really isn't another option-"
And yet, Draco found himself more willing to protect the students than anything else. It wasn’t fair. Hogwarts was supposed to remain safe. How could he, in good conscience, put their lives as risk? Or what of the first and second years? Assuming they won this war and everyone lived… their memories of the school would be forever tainted.
“You know what, Draco?” He asked, playfully flicking Draco’s shoulder. “I’m calling you on your bluff. It’s been five years and you haven’t actually followed through on a threat yet. Come on. Show us that great Malfoy -
"I... I'm going to make some tea..." She murmured and absently walked from the room. A few people frowned at her - obviously concerned - but nobody stopped her. Donovan sighed.
What if nothing happened? If he just stood there, failed at the spell, and got killed almost instantly? How
He shouted and the cheers changed to boos. Teddy frowned at them. "Stop it. Uncle Harry, make them stop." He grumbled, scowling at the class. Andi grinned.
“You need to ready yourself for it. Me. Andromeda. Definitely your father.” Severus continued. He was piling books and parchment in front of him along with an assortment of items Draco felt a vague recognition towards.
“I told you I learned how to handle myself!” Zoe yelled, punching the air, “No amount of luck can keep me from kicking your ass, prat!” She shouted. Draco laughed before turning back around to disarm his own opponent. He was just about to run off to find the others again when he heard a sharp gasp. He turned back around to see Zoe’s hair flickering between gold and brown.
"Uh... maybe?" Draco said, "Who told you? Wait - does Andromeda know?" He asked, a little horrified. Damnit. He forgot to tell her. Shit.
”It’s a basilisk.” Draco said as the car flew over a tree trunk. “Like in Balthazar and the Basilisk!” He said and the car jerked to the right.
ally. Turns out, some of the worst people in the muggle world weren't even locked up. It was bewildering, but worked out well enough for Draco.
"You do have spirit, I'll give you that," he said coolly and shook his head. The banging outside the door was growing more insistent. Was he the only one that could hear it? The sound was thudding - almost like a heart beat. There was a rhythm to it that he found way too distracting. "I will not accept a failure like this again, do you understand?" He asked.
“Not really.” He muttered, looking at the ground. McGonagall was definitely going to tell Andromeda and he was definitely going to get a howler about this. How bloody
“It’ll probably have to be me,” he decided and whipped his cloak as he turned away. Draco flinched. The idea of using an unforgivable curse… especially on Severus…
“He-? I thought we were good now!” Harry said, looking betrayed that Severus had ratted him out. As if Draco wasn’t his literal godson. “Draco, look. I just thought that as someone else who is also… you know, doing spy stuff, he should be on the same page.” He explained.
"With the Weasleys," he said slowly. It was an odd thing to see them all standing together - his mother looked very out of place and deeply uncomfortable, but she was resolute in offering to stay and make sure everyone was okay. Ted nodded, lips thinning slightly. "I'm sorry," Draco said and twisted his hands, "I... I know you're also upset with me..." He trailed off. Ted gave a weak smile.
“He’ll come around,” he finally said, hoping these were the words he wanted to hear. Harry scoffed and picked up the knife again, “I got it.” Draco said hastily and pulled the weapon from his grasp.
All of this to say... in this chapter he's wondering if Andi was originally Delphi. Now, since I didn't include any of this in the fic the answer can definitely be no, but if you're wondering my original intention... yep. I just think it's an interesting concept. Especially considering that in the Cursed Child Delphi was just so evil bc of her evil blood and horrible upbringing, yadda, yadda. Honestly, it would be FAR more interesting to have made her a girl raised by good people who learned her parents were horrible villains and see how she coped with that while Scorpius and Albus fell in love. That's the book we deserved and you can quote me on that.
There was a long pause as the group of teachers and the three of them stared at one another. Draco wondered what they looked like. Covered in blood, robes ripped, and Harry hold the sorting hat while Draco was holding a God forsaken sword. McGonagall put a hand on her chest.
"I am not your enemy here," Dumbledore told him and when Draco simply stared back, sighed. "Yes. Yes, the Deathly Hallows are real. Tom does know of one."
Draco asked and Theo stopped talking to look at him over with thinly veiled amusement. “Sorry. Sorry, it’s just since he was interested in Hermione I had to play it cool but-”
“Neville!” He called, racing over. He had actually wanted to find Hermione, but she seemed to have vanished. Typical. Neville was a decent bet though. “Hey, hi. It’s me.” He greeted, slightly out of breath. “Underwater plants.”
“Was that any better?” Harry laughed. Draco shoved him away, though he was admittedly laughing too. “Come on, didn’t your pureblood upbringing better prepare you for this?” He asked and shoved him back.
“Yes,” Harry said, and a hint of a smile touched his lips, “Just them though,” he mused and Draco considered. This was good news at least. He felt pretty prepared when they stepped off the train onto the platform. With his last bit of hope, he scanned the platform.
“Leave me behind and I’ll break your nose,” Draco warned and picked up the new mixture, “Let me see yours?” He asked and grabbed the bottle in Harry’s hand. “Yeah… that looks like the same color. It smells the same too,” he said and handed Harry his bottle back.
"I see why you're worried, but honestly, Hermione. Who would Harry even use that against? Voldemort? I wouldn't be too concerned about it. He wouldn't just go throwing that around at anyone. He isn't like that." He told her. Hermione pursed her lips.
“I’m still fine,” he said as he packed his things away. Her eyes dug into his side. He glanced around. Well… it
, Harry. You aren’t even that angry at him! You’re just upset that he was entrusted with information
"You will be allowed a defense," the other wizard said as the other tapped their wrists so a pair of handcuffs materialized on them. Draco raised an eyebrow. Whatever that meant... "We will be asking for a confession and testimony." He added. Draco nodded stoically.
!” Fleur said when she saw Hermione walking in. Draco smiled as he nodded in agreement, watching her walk in with an air of confidence she didn’t tend to have in these situations. From beside her, Viktor beamed. He looked positively thrilled to have succeeded in getting Hermione to join him. When he caught Draco’s eye he gave a subtle gesture to which Draco couldn’t help but laugh and give him an approving nod in return.
“Sorry!” Neville yelped. Draco hadn’t even noticed he came. Where had he been hiding out? “I didn’t mean to startle you. I just… was wondering if we should head back together? Since you’ve been letting me in and stuff…”
“I’ve used the killing curse,” he said and Draco raised a disbelieving brow, “In the manor. There was a Death Eater. I could have stunned him, but I just... I killed him. Didn’t even think about it.” He explained, looking very... matter-of-fact about the whole thing. Draco frowned. He couldn't think of anything less Harry-like. Sure, Harry threatened to kill people occasionally (Sirius during their third year for example), but he never actually
during our second year, there were several other solutions to help Ginny other than facing that stupid chamber ourselves, and those are just the immediate ones that come to mind! If anybody told you
“Very. Scowl at everyone to show it. Actually, you know what? Let’s take out our anger on Sir Cadogan.” He said. Yeah…. Yeah! That sounded like a great idea! Neville stared at him in baffled wonder. “I’m mad at someone and I bet you’re secretly mad at the git for the Sirius Black thing. Let’s yell at him.” He said, pulling Neville’s arm. “Plus, Cadogan was said to be a member of the Round Table. I bet he’s upset he’s missing out on Future day.” He told Neville.
"Well, you did ignore her orders," he said and Draco inwardly felt a spike of panic, "You didn't kill the Nott boy. Now, look." He said gesturing around, "Look at the mess you've created for me. For assuming you knew
“Oh my God.” Draco whispered, sinking in his seat. A few other Gryffindors were looking at them in interest before also deciding that they were skipping class. Neville had appeared to lead on a new charge along with Ginny, Fred, George, Dean, and Seamus. It was only after McGonagall stood up that the hall went silent.
“Oh, sure. In between my extensive service to the Dark Lord I had a snog with a bloke down the street.” He muttered and tossed another book into the pile levitating behind him. Dora laughed. “I can’t even think of anyone at school I would be remotely interested in dating.” He added.
"Well, I set up six different portkeys to different countries. I figured I needed to get them done before You-Know-Who came to power so that they could be incognito. I knew he would try to isolate us. Make the war strictly a British problem. Well, I planned to go to America, Japan, France, Bulgaria, Russia, Uganda - see about going to where some of the other wizarding schools were, you know?" He said.
“I TOLD YOU TO STAY ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CASTLE, DAMNIT!” Zoe’s voice screeched and Draco turned to find Zoe getting up out of the puddle she had fallen into. The ground shook for a moment and a few students stumbled away when the water disappeared into a burst of mist.
Most importantly, however, was Draco... who was pointing a stake at him. Or maybe it was the broken leg of a chair... either way it was wooden and sharp and something Harry would rather not be stabbed by today.
"Aw," Sirius chuckled as he walked over to ruffle Harry's hair fondly, "Don't be mean to him over that. What was he? Twelve? How would he know?" He asked and Harry looked at Draco with narrowed eyes. Draco stared back. Harry hadn't dropped the stone yet so his parents were probably still there... and Draco didn't really want to embarrass him front of
"You're right," Hermione said and flicked her wand so the radio went back in her back. Harry fell back on the bank, staring up at the sky. He wished it was night so he could see constellations. Not thinking, he reached up, tracing where he imagined Draco's cluster of stars to be and took a long breath. Two more... just two more horcruxes... something of Ravenclaw's was the best bet. Harry honestly knew nothing about her. Maybe he should have done more research on the founders when he knew-
be productive.” She finished. Harry flushed slightly, a protest on his lips, which ended when Ron clapped a hand on his shoulder. Strangely enough, that was all Ron offered before going back to his food. Draco waited for him to try and drag Harry into another scheme, but nothing… Harry gave him a curious look before shrugging it off. Yeah. Ron was probably just tired.
bloody irritating!” Hermione shrieked. Her face was a dark red, “Besides, I’m no worse than you!” She added. Draco’s smile vanished. He didn’t like that. Not at all. “You and Harry are ridiculous-”
Draco couldn't be sure what about Harry being wildly annoyed with Draco messing with him made him feel so ridiculously soft, but... part of him felt a wave of fondness as they went through the doors to look at where the sorting hat was still sitting innocently by. He could hear people cheering Ron and Hermione's name - a sign he probably needed to get back to see them off. It was strange actually. To know the hat's logic now. For years he wondered what Slytherin trait he had lacked and now he had his answer... None. He could have went to Slytherin. He could have belonged there. His life could have been completely different.
"It doesn't work." Draco told Hermione flatly as Ron snickered. Harry looked at the gift with approval before showing his own, “Harriet!” He shouted when the snake flickered between green and purple, “She’s better! How did you even...? You better not have experimented on her!” He added. Not that he could be too upset given that she was clearly doing so much better.
Shout out to my best friend who also had a sex seminar when he came out to his mom. This woman legit did her internet research and then asked her gay relatives to come over to make sure he had a thorough sex education and to this day it is the funniest thing to me. But also, like, it worked. He knew more about straight/gay sex than anyone else at our school. If we ever had any questions that was who we went to lol
“Dear God, you two are hopeless,” Hermione sighed and pointed to a few others, “We also asked a few of the professors to give anything they remembered. McGonagall. Flitwick. Dumbledore.” She said, pointing to each of them respectively, “Snape even gave a couple, right?” She asked. Draco nodded. It had taken a while and Severus had been very picky about it, but he did cough up two of him and Lily.
Draco said, frustrated as he sat up, "You're upset at my parents and Bellatrix and Voldemort, but... you just seem
“Hm, we’ll see.” Draco said, shaking his head. “This is pretty invasive. You know, I bet if my father was still talking to me he might consider suing the school over it.” He said. Harry scoffed. “Seriously. I think it’s ethically questionable at the very least.”
"No," Hermione answered tersely, "Their numbers are hurting thanks to Draco's poisoning and the explosion at the manor," she said. The mention of the manor made Draco's pocket feel heavier now that he was aware of the letter within, "So they aren't going to be focused on muggles when they should be redirecting their efforts towards the war - and hopefully the Elder Wand." She said. Harry nodded.
He added towards a trunk, loud enough for those outside to hear. Ted gave a sad smile as a bang sounded before giving a fake cry of pain. “I can figure it out. Just... give me some time.”
"I - you didn't-" Harry choked out, going bright red as Draco turned to him with a raised eyebrow, "I didn't even - he's being dramatic. It wasn't even - I just happened to, um, you just - I happened to look down and, uh-"
He turned to see her being dragged onto land, thrashing helplessly with red marks around her neck and arms as she tried to re-enter the water, still screeching in French. Gabrielle. His mind replayed the song Harry had told them. The one about taking something dear…
She was trying to get a reaction out of him. Trying to see how he would respond to hearing her talk about Draco. He wouldn't let her win though. Not yet. No, he was going to get Draco first. Then, when all was said in done, Harry would tear her limb from limb.
“I know somebody who has a thousand different vanilla products in our bathroom.” He said and Draco spun around to give him the coldest look he could muster. “Also, you know who always seems to devour anything mint?” He began as Neville peered over curiously.
"No. No, I don't, Blaise. Nicholas Flamel's stone, maybe? It was destroyed though so I can't..." Draco trailed off. An idea whispered in the back of his mind. "I think," Draco said slowly, "He might be looking for the Mirror of Erised."
"Fine. I'm bringing Ron then." Draco grumbled, "He can at least make me breakfast everyday." He reasoned and Harry shoved him back slightly.
“A mont-? Are you insane? Why aren’t you yelling at Harry and Ron?!” Draco asked, voice rising a bit. “That’s so unfair!”
"Why would they need such a thing?" Ginny asked, peering into the classroom. Most of the muggle artifacts they were studying were up on displays with some of the more dangerous ones surrounded by no-touch charms. Naturally, Ginny decided to go try and touch those ones. Neville, on the other hand, put his hands behind his back like he was at a museum to look around. "By the way, I heard you decked someone, Nev." Ginny called, picking up a calculator and trying to punch something in.
"I wouldn't say that," Draco said, a bit uncomfortably, "And, um, you told... your government this?"
“Move, Harry.” Draco whispered. Harry turned to him, giving a little shake of his head. His eyes flickered to all the stares, but Draco nodded, giving him a push to the front of the castle.
"Your bureaucratic dedication is astounding," Draco told him, "Tell me, do I get a trial? And if so, exactly how many witnesses am I allowed?" He asked. Severus shook his head at him in exasperation. What? It sounded hilariously chaotic. He could have Fleur yelling in French with the Chosen One losing his temper and complaining about how much he hated the government like the old man he secretly was and -
"I think I know where we need to go at least," Harry said to the others, standing up, "I had a dream last night. Vol -
"Because she offered me a chance to be a good person," he finally said, startling Draco. "She did that often. With me. With Potter." He tacked on bitterly. "I suppose the difference between us in the end was that he took that chance while I didn't." He said and Draco slowly nodded. He supposed he could see that. It had been a similar situation with Draco after all.
Harry wasn't as well acquainted with this sort of watch communication as Draco and Ron were, but he did try to sort out his emotions enough to concentrate on everything he had been carrying the past week or so. The worry and heartbreak and... well, how much he had missed him. Draco's fingers twitched around the gold. Hopefully that meant it went through okay. Draco tapped on the watch in Harry's hand. Right. He squeezed it.
“I’m sorry,” he said instead, “I’m sure she didn’t know she was doing that.” He said slowly. Harry merely shrugged. “It definitely wasn't you. Just... circumstance," He shrugged, "Besides, there’s no shortage of girls that would go out with you?” He tried. Harry turned to look at him, “What? It’s true. You’re very lucky I’m not straight else you wouldn’t have a chance with any of them.” He said. That at least got a small smile before Harry lightly shoved him.
“My git of a boyfriend,” he muttered, crossing his arms. He knew he was pouting, but he had a right to. Ron blinked, turning to where Harry was polishing his broom with slight interest. Even the fire seemed to rise curiously at Draco’s words. “It isn’t his fault,” Draco sighed, and tilted his head back so he could rest it on the back of the chair “But I’m so annoyed.”
“There are more than you think. Funnily enough, once you leave this school people don’t really give a damn about your house. Well, outside of purebloods.” He amended. Draco gave a dry laugh. “But contrary to popular belief, Gryffindor doesn’t own bravery.” He said and tilted his head, “And Slytherin doesn’t own loyalty.”
On the other hand, Umbridge was downright psychopathic. Draco had hoped cluing McGonagall in about the black quills would have ridden the school of them altogether, but now that Dumbledore was gone… well, he wasn't sure there was much she could do.
Bellatrix hissed and kicked him again. Draco gave a sharp intake, "Just you wait," she laughed, "Oh, I'll save you for my master. I will, darling, but I'll make sure you're
he didn’t know. Draco couldn’t kill him. Not for this. Not for something that wasn’t even his fault. It was Draco’s fault. He couldn’t let him die over something
“Oh,” She flushed, “Um… yes, I can help you.” She said warily and rubbed the side of her arm. “Do… would you mind if, um, it was a bit public?” She asked and then winced, “Not because I don’t like Slytherins! I mean, Theo is nice, but just because we don’t really know each other and after the muggleborn stuff last year-” She rambled awkwardly, voice growing a bit more panicked towards the end.
He said and Draco almost yelped as he was dragged under a table. “Professor McGonagall.” He whispered.
“I will continue looking into it,” she finally sighed. It was what she said every time, but Draco at least believed her. He didn’t so much believe Dumbledore when he said the same.
"That sounds great," Draco told her stiffly, "But instead you disowned me over something I had no control over."
. Where was Gabrielle? Draco straightened up, flicking his wand up to repel another flash of red light sent his way. He found Gabrielle just in time to see Macnair raise his wand at her.
"I wanted to see if they saw anyone following us or how fast the Gringotts thing spread, but..." She pressed a hand to her mouth. Harry inched closer. The words were crackling at first - static interrupting until Lee Jordan's voice smoothed out when Hermione shook the radio.
“Aw, you know me,” Draco said and Harry gave a slight huff at that, “I have to iron some of the last pieces of my plan though…” He mused, tapping his fingers on the table thoughtfully. Harry hummed. For once, Harry was fully onboard with Draco's plan. He had been a little concerned that he might not go for it, but overall... he seemed pretty pleased.
“Can I grab some ingredients?” He asked. It had been several months since Draco last visited Severus so he wasn’t sure how this was going to go… but he had to try. The two were on tentatively civil terms again. Severus had been significantly easier on all the Gryffindors since Draco’s last outburst so he was trying to return it with being polite.
Draco had several ideas on how this could maybe work. Transfiguration maybe? He could turn himself into a fish… but also. He wasn’t sure how he would turn himself back. So maybe not transfiguration. Um, there was, possibly… a charm? Being the slimy, untrustworthy Slytherin he was (...deep down) he decided to use Fleur as a potential resource.
Hermione’s expression was something Draco had trouble reading (likely due to the fur), but he could tell it was pained.
Luckily, Draco was considered a late reinforcement so most of the ire wasn't directed at him. He figured he would stay low for a few days just in case. He squeezed the watch around his neck patiently and waited for Ron's response. A warmth followed soon after along with the feeling of reassurance. Good. The others were safe then.
didn’t think anyone else should be around if he ended up casting a corporeal patronus. Not that he could explain that. Harry had been really cross with him over the matter. Draco found that as a teacher, he was really quite skilled and patient with making sure everyone had a good handle on the spells he’d been teaching them. However, he didn’t put up with Draco’s nonsense, which was unfortunate for him.
Draco opened his mouth to ask what exactly she meant by that, but didn't have the chance seeing as she moved gracefully forward. A few people moved aside from her as she casually deflected curses as she went. Draco inwardly grimaced. He did
killed anyone yet, right? He tried to remember if his parents had mentioned anything to him about the chamber. Probably, but he couldn’t remember now.
Harriet shot back. Right. He should have picked out literally any other snake to give to Draco in their third year. Glowering, he stood up, picking up a fang and jamming it into the locket. A loud shrieked followed - echoing loudly throughout the forest so that animals scattered from trees and Hermione came sprinting out of the tent. Harry brought the fang down again and a small whimper followed before the metal turned a dull shade of black, cracking in half completely.
“Why… do you have… a gun?” Severus gritted out. Draco simply pointed to the bag of muggle items before deciding it was best to summon the thing out of him. However, the problem was that… well, he had no idea what the thing was
“Trust me,” Draco said, “I’m an expert on hearings. My father went to enough of them… both as prosecutor and defendant.” He said and Ron gave a slight ‘well-there-you-go-then’ nod. “Those assholes are ruthless.”
Draco swallowed, feeling the weight of the hat slip off of him and the light assault his eyes. As his eyes adjusted, he could see the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables giving hesitant applause along with some younger students at the Gryffindor table who weren’t familiar with who he was.
“So, you’re the one who had two rooms when he was in there?” He asked. Dudley licked his lips a moment before looking down at the ground. If Draco didn’t know any better he would say that was shame in his expression. Maybe that was his cue. Clearly, Dudley had come to say something to his cousin. He squeezed Harry’s hand once before going out to the front porch.
"Don't move!" Hermione warned him and Harry put his hands up. He was just about to say it was him when Hermione held up a hand.
“What’s happening to your face?” Ron asked with a frown as he glanced over from Harry’s bed. Draco rolled his eyes and cradled the two pins close.
Draco flicked his wand and the blood disappeared as he swallowed down vomit suddenly rising up his throat. He turned to find Hermione staring at him and offered her a weak smile. She pursed her lips and walked over to lightly put a hand on his arm, helping clean the wound herself.
“Thank goodness you’re awake,” Dumbledore greeted him brightly, “Mr. Potter was quite concerned to learn you were not yet awake earlier,” he said. Draco sat up, frowning as he looked around. He saw a curtain pulled a few beds down and decided immediately it must be Harry’s. He was okay then. That was something.
"Draco's missing," Andromeda said and then lifted her gaze to meet Harry's, "If he's compromised I need to move them. I... last year, I made a few spare places to hide without Draco knowing. I knew if they caught him..." She trailed off.
“Yeah, that too,” he dismissed and Hermione glowered at him, “What exactly is the game plan for how you plan to do this?” He asked. Ron and Harry slowly turned to where Hermione had pulled out a few more books. She paused when all eyes fell on her.
I think the main thing I can promise is that Sirius will live... Also, as I'm finishing up year 6 I'm finding that one is LOTS of fun with Slughorn and all the awkward teenage stuff. So. That's gonna be good fun. Just survive some of the torment I'm about to put you through :D
“I was in hiding.” He said, going with the same spiel he had told Ron. It seemed to work as Harry deflated a bit, lips pursing as he mulled out the window. Draco considered. “I, uh, was thinking of some useful things to know. Now that...he’s back.” He continued slowly. Harry glanced over at him.
“A numbing potion,” She said, handing it to him. “If we had to do anything really sudden or major we would give that to you first,” she explained and tilted her head, “But you seem to be okay.” She said. He shrugged. “I suppose some of it is the shock.”
“I’m fine with holding it.” Draco said and Hermione slammed her hand against the counter to make them all jump.
"Yeah... that's my best friend." Harry said, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Sure. Yeah, I'll tell them," he said amused and turned to Draco, "My mom thinks you seem very nice and have lovely hair," He said and then turned to Ron, "She also says you seem like a catch and that anyone would be lucky to have you." He told him.
“My father.” He said slowly. It wasn’t his father’s handwriting though… even if it was familiar. Probably one of the servants sent it over then. He exchanged wary looks at Neville. He hadn't expected any contact from his family after that meeting with his mother. He tugged at the string.
“Does that mean I won?” He asked excitedly and all three of them turned to him to see Harry sitting with a rather large pile of fake money. Draco frowned.
“IF HE USES IT, THEN IT’S A FOUL!” Someone shouted. Draco could have shouted something in return, but paused when Harry fumbled forward, fingers brushing wings. The bludger ricocheted - zipping towards Harry’s hand.
“Maybe,” he said slowly, “It… is really confusing and I still don’t get some things, but it’s interesting.” He admitted and fell back in his chair, “It makes it easier to talk to Ted and Hermione.” He said. Theo nodded.
"I know. You don't need to walk on eggshells," she said, running her hand through her hair, "For what it's worth, I know he loves me. He knows I love him too. Neither of us went into this thinking it was going to be a fifty year commitment. Just that it might be a... an until we die sort of commitment," she shrugged, "You know, given the war and all. And who knows? Maybe things won't change in fifty years," she said, sounding oddly amused by the whole thing, "But it isn't the end of the world if it isn't."
“Well, I am learning to be a healer,” Draco shrugged and snapped the book closed. He looked warily towards the door. Maybe he could say he needed to write to Andromeda or something. He got up with the intention of doing just that when Harry blocked his exit from the door.
“I remember your parents,” he said and Draco inwardly felt himself crumble. Didn’t he just have this conversation? Was he about to learn of another way they had wronged the world? “They were Slytherins. Not a loyal bone in their bodies.” He said softly. Draco shoved his hand off of him. “Don’t agree? They weren’t loyal to you.” He chuckled, “They weren't loyal to Voldemort after he fell.”
“It’s okay if your feelings are hurt,” he said finally, deducing what must be going on. Hermione’s eyes flicked from the water to him. “He’s your friend. Just because they chose Ron to be the person who he would miss most doesn’t mean he cares for you any less.”
His father didn't respond. He looked far too lost to his own thoughts. The others had already started leaving - pops following them all disappearing now that they had their fill of violence for the evening so that only Draco, Lucius, and Macnair's floating body remained.
Luckily, his ailment didn't last too terribly wrong. As suspected, he was fine the next morning. Sirius had responded the following day.
There were scattered applause from the Death Eaters and Draco's mind was torn between fight and flight. He was outnumbered. He wouldn't make it. All he had was a brief element of surprise.
“My, my, my…” Gibbons crowed following the others, “This looks like so much fun!” He cackled and flicked his wand absently between his fingers. Draco gave a small smile in return, “How should we start this off?”
“None of that matters because you don’t care, Draco. All you do is try to say the right thing to avoid us telling you off. You think you’re better. You’ll
“Here?” Harry asked before lowering his hand to his side almost completely. Draco looked at him. “I need a reasonably sized person - come here.” He said and yanked impatiently at Draco’s arm.
“I didn’t say that,” Ron told him quickly. Draco rolled his eyes and went back to his potion, “I… okay, listen. No, stop doing that,” He said and took the knife from Draco. “Look, Harry and Hermione were raised by muggles. They don’t know how… intense some purebloods can be,” he said and Draco narrowed his eyes. “I’m
“Sorry,” he said and then pointed towards a tree, “It’s under there.” He added. Draco turned - there was a faint floral scent mixed in with berries. He followed it towards the tree Neville had pointed out and used a paw scratch at the dirt warily. He slipped down underneath so that he was inside the hollowed out trunk. He blinked a bit as his eyes adjusted to the dark. Where - ah, there it was. Using his teeth, he yanked out a few purple plants and squeezed back out of the tree trunk.
"You were fighting a war," one student supplied helpfully at the front of the room. Draco turned. Oh. Right. They were here. Harry nodded and pointed at the boy who had spoken.
“Hey!” Marcus seethed, “Maybe after your father rids us of this ugly hippogriff he could just go ahead and take care of you next. He can-”
“Neville, would you like to join us?” Hermione interrupted. Draco gaped at her in absolute horror. Longbottom didn’t answer though. He was too busy staring at Draco with wide eyes. He raised an eyebrow expectantly. What? Was he too beautiful to look at or something?
think anybody was still using those coins, but they were easy enough to replicate so that if he got into a tight spot with another Death Eater... Well...
The world around them erupted. Smoke and dust filled the air as the earth trembled and castle shook with such a force it might have collapsed. Draco used the distraction to hurl himself forward, racing before Voldemort could compose himself. Death Eaters screamed as both sides slammed together while trying to recover. A few managed to raise shields in time, but it was fair to say Ginny had managed to stir an otherwise silent crowd.
“-though maybe she isn’t the smartest if she can’t see that.” He said and Draco felt the temperature of the room physically drop as soon as the words were out of his mouth. Even the castle knew how badly he had fucked up.
“Why? Because she’s smarter than you?” He demanded and both Weasley and Potter spun around. “Maybe if your parents had less kids, they could have actually taught you something before you came to school,” he added in, watching with pleasure as Weasley’s face began to match the color of his hair.
I hope you guys liked Future day. I like to think Merlin (from Merlin) would deadass create a whole wizarding holiday so that when Arthur rose from the dead there would be a bunch of sorcerers there to greet him lmao. It just feels like such a petty move on his part "Hey, you didn't legalize magic so I made a holiday where a bunch of sorcerers party hard in your name"
Bellatrix flinched as if he had just hit her instead. There was a moment of silence as her eyes fell, giving whispered apologies and desperate explanations until Voldemort tapped his wand under her chin to force her to look up.
“I don’t accept this. Ron and I remain the taller duo.” Draco said stubbornly and glared at Harry. This only led to him shaking his head before hugging him again. Draco had been getting a lot of hugs lately. He didn’t mind it too much, actually. It would appear after nearly six years of constant physical affection, he was finally growing fond of it.
“Blood quills,” he told her and Umbridge paused, “Or, I suppose black quills are the proper name for them, aren’t they?” He asked. The tabby’s head jerked up at the word, eyes moving away from Umbridge’s notebook to instead fix him with an intense stare.
“And here I was hoping that you were the ugliest thing I would see today,” he said dryly. Ron looked at him with a hint of panic in his eyes. “Joking. McLaggen sucks. You’re definitely going to make it.”
“Well,” she finally said and reached into her desk once more. The tabby watched where she reached very carefully, “I can hardly keep families apart now, can I?” She asked. Draco’s smile widened as she pulled out a black quill. “You may keep that one,” she added to him, “I’m quite sure I’ll be acquiring many more soon enough.” She told him and the tabby hissed suddenly, swiping at her. Umbridge jumped. “Oh, what is my darling?” she cooed at the cat as it hissed at her. “It’s alright, pretty girl.” She continued.
"My students can assure you of my talents," she said and turned to look at Ginny, "I am a malnatus," she added to her. Zoe brightened a bit as she peered down at her, "My mother was forced to drink veritserum while carrying me and now it is... very easy for me to persuade the truth from others. I can promise I will do my job well." She told everyone with a nod, "Could you, perhaps, show me where this Lady of Gray is?" She asked, turning to someone Draco couldn't quite make out. Before he could get closer, Neville's eyes met his.
Theo repeated numbly. “Winston is…” He tried again as if saying it another time would help, “But… he… I.... I didn’t mean to disappear,” Theo murmured, “I didn’t ask-” He started and then cut himself off. Draco watched as the numbness melted away into tight features and a clenched jaw, “I didn’t ask to just
“Perhaps some quiet in the back?” Lupin called and both fell silent. Harry waited until his back was turned and then flicked him… because he had the mentality of a two-year-old apparently. Draco stepped on his foot. Harry stuck his tongue out. Draco reached up and knocked his glasses to the tip of his nose.
“Uh huh,” She said and gave a subtle shake of her head. “Well, I’ll see you at the ball.” She told him, snapping her own book closed. Draco shook his head after her. As if she had any room to talk.
The trek to Snape’s office was longer than usual. Mainly because he was starting to sort out the components of his plan. It was stupidly reckless and dumb… but it could work. It could work and give them a massive upperhand.
Slowly, he looked up at Ron to stare him down. The other Gryffindor fidgeted, perhaps sensing how goddamn pissed Draco was through his eyes alone.
Harry denied it, but Draco was pretty sure this deathday party was a punishment for calling Pansy a ‘horrible, truly awful’ name. Hermione had lectured him over the matter for a solid two days, which included a brief history of why the words were bad, how using it as a counter was still terrible, and all the social implications it has on the worth of others.
“I mean, you kind of nailed it. I was the only one with a shred of intelligence. Couldn’t just leave them be-”
There was a long pause. Fleur’s eyes followed him, drifting between a dark blue and almost violet color before a glimmer of a smile touched her lips.
“...fine. Two hundred then," Harry said haughtily. Draco made a note of put this memory in their pensieve later. Harry very conveniently 'forgot' many of the bets they had after he lost them. Draco would ensure he got his two hundred galleons. He wondered idly if Fleur planned on sending Victoire to Beauxbatons or Hogwarts. He should ask... then add her to the house betting board. "I wish we could get married again," Harry said suddenly.
"I need you to find Ron and Hermione," he said quietly and licked his lips, "But I'm going to meet you before everything starts, okay? I promise I won't be long." He added. Draco hesitated. "Please, Draco?" He asked. Ugh. Draco nodded. He kind of had to relent given how accommodating Harry had been in the past...seven years. Harry smiled softly at him. "Thanks," he managed and pushed past him. Draco stood still for a moment before turning around.
...damnit. He was going to cave. He couldn't stand Harry looking at him like that. Draco tried to look at anything else, but he could still feel Harry's hands on his arm, squeezing tightly.
"The Elder Wand." Draco said with a nod. Relief was blossoming in his chest. He just needed to destroy
"Tell him I said hi... Or actually, maybe don't," he mused, "I think he's a little sad that I lived."
“Ah, I see.” Slughorn hummed. He asked a few more questions, bouncing between them all in what was clearly an interview, "Now, you, Cormac, I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?" He asked. McLaggan chuckled.
trying to get him back with his family... the easiest way to do that would be getting rid of Andromeda. "Alright, fine." He amended and then shook his head, "McGonagall."
“You have a point there.” He murmured and flicked his wand to stir the potion. The room was beginning to smell overwhelmingly of apples, wafts of it coming from the cauldron. Draco went back to his own potion, throwing in three slugs as he felt Serverus’ eyes on him. “I won’t tell them.”
"Let's go then," he said and tugged Hermione forward. "I promise I won't let you fall." He added and then considered, "...unless I trip you."
“I mean, there aren’t too many constellations out there that are happy,” he reasoned, “Andromeda was named after that one.” He said, pointing up at a cluster of stars glimmering above them, “That was the princess who was sacrificed to a sea monster… Actually, her mother was who my sister was named after.” Draco added as an afterthought.
“What are you doing?” He finally asked, “Draco, once he realizes what you’ve done…” He trailed off and Draco smiled, “You planned this.” He decided and gave a slight chuckle, “I knew you were planning something…” He mused. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Utter bollocks,” Draco told him, grabbing his hand, “Honestly, sorting ceremonies should just be flipping a coin at this point,” he told him and Harry grinned, letting Draco lead him back down the Great Hall. “Though, I am willing to be ten galleons that Teddy is going to be a Ravenclaw.”
The point was that Harry and Draco just wanted some time to... exist. You know, together. Without their friends giving any thoughts or opinions or questions about their relationship. God forbid if bloody Slughorn or anyone else found out.
The flames cleared. Andromeda and Nymphadora were right behind him. Ted might have been there too, but Draco knew he tended to take a different path in order to divert the floo channels.
“Draco, that’s rude.” Hermione’s voice told him, which was really concerning because he couldn’t even see her, but there were other things happening at the moment.
"Yep. I didn't say it was pretty though," he added and Jenkins snorted. Draco rolled his eyes. He supposed he wasn't wrong, but still... "Okay, if you can find that person who can translate for me get me his name and cell number." Draco told him, standing up, "Also, my offer still stands to break you out." He added. Jenkins grinned at him, eyes alright with amusement.
Thank you all one last time for all your comments and kudos and bookmarks ❤️. This has been (by far) my longest fic ever (I think the second longest is 182,000 words and that one is just one-shots... then my second-longest actual story is 108,000 so this by FAR exceeds both lol) and you guys made it so easy to make me want to write more. I'm currently in a bit of writing rut right now, but hopefully come 2021 I'll be back with new content... maybe even some more HP content!
Despite their best efforts there was no trace of Draco Malfoy that they could fine. No mention of him on Potterwatch, no traces of his magic, no word in the Daily Prophet, no responses to his watch - nothing. Harry had used his two-way mirror to ask Sirius if he had seen or heard from him, but there was nothing.
“It worked… God, this better wear off and not leave any remnant of Crabbe on me,” he grimaced. Draco grinned.
"Well, both," Harry admitted, "But I'm just saying if you wanted to go down to the courthouse and do it again, I would," he said. Draco stopped walking and looked at him. Harry stared back, clearly missing the implication. "...what?"
Ginny asked, aghast. “Draco, it’s really dangerous.” She said firmly. There was a note of real concern in her voice that was a little touching. She squinted at him. “I promise not to hex you if you don’t do it.” She added. Draco grinned at her. Ginny
Which led to the non-bright side of his current situation. Harry had not mastered occlumency in time and thought Sirius was currently being tortured.
"I'm not trying to cause problems. I just don't want you to..." He started, but his words were waved away.
“Ah, yes.” Ron said and rubbed his hands together in preparation for the food. “Draco is being a jerk again. We can finally say things are back to normal.”
said I wouldn't actually ditch school and go get married. Obviously, I couldn't let that accusation stand so we left school and got married. There. Story done." He said. A few students frowned at one another, muttering in confusion.
“Great,” Harry muttered and blinked a few times as bright green drops went into his eyes, “....I can’t see anything.” He announced. Draco frowned.
"Don't get cocky, Potter." Blaise said, emerging from the crowd to also put his wand down. Then came another. And another. People were lining up to place their wands down so that Harry had a small pile at his feet. Draco inwardly groaned. Oh, this would be a
"That is so wonderful to hear!" He said, ignoring Ron slowly putting his head into his hands, "Molly will be so excited - have you met Molly yet? Oh, you
"Babe?" Molly asked and Draco narrowed his eyes, "I just hadn't heard him call you that before!" She told him with a light laugh. He gave a long-suffering sigh in return.
"That wasn't my patronus," Harry interrupted him. Draco paused. Oh... no... "I was a little surprised too, admittedly." Harry said and Draco could
A weak chuckle drifted over the remaining Death Eaters who had been shifting uncertainly around the room. Some had gone towards his mother while others were trying to keep his father from fighting back. Draco wouldn't let himself look at them. Not now.
“It’s… It’s saying 'kill',” Harry told them, eyes widening. “It wants to rip something? I… this way!” He said, turning sharply. Draco opened his mouth to respond only for a sharp noise to capture his attention. Like a… low hissing sound? He frowned, looking around before shaking the thought away. As a child, he loved hunting snakes to release in their gardens. He had developed quite an ear for them - even pretending to be a parseltongue on occasion. There were probably a few lose ones strolling around.
"Well," he began slowly, "Just remember if a pawn reaches the other end of the board it can become another piece," he shrugged and flicked over a few of his pieces, "So Krum might not be an important part of things now, but later..." he trailed off. Draco bit his lip. That did make him feel a little better actually.
“Oi! Smith!” He yelled, “Come over here!” He called and watched as the blonde whipped around to meet his gaze. A group of Hufflepuffs giggled as he stumbled over, almost tripping to get to Draco’s side.
of killing devices? And this isn’t the animal killing one?” He asked and then frowned, “Wait. Does that make it the
“What are you doing?” Draco called and grabbed his arm, “Tell me you’re going to help Harry and Hermione and not go after an innocent man.” He said and shook his head. He had been suspicious about Severus’ treatment towards Harry for awhile now, but really the events of this year solidified it. “You wouldn’t. Not over something that happened years ago. James Potter is
Draco had known about the Gringotts plan from the beginning. He was in the same house as them after all, and he was literally a trained spy. It hadn't been hard to listen in on even if he had been out of sorts. It had been comforting, actually. To sneak around without anyone knowing he was listening in. It reassured him that this wasn't some sort of huge ploy to make him feel safe before... well, you know. Before... Nevermind.
“I bet it’s Snape,” Harry said firmly. Draco sighed. He was pretty sure his godfather was not stealing the sorcerer’s stone or whatever, but his words of reason had fallen on deaf ears. Even Hermione seemed semi-convinced by this. If the only reasonable person of this group was swayed, then he was most definitely fighting a losing battle. “His leg was hurt - from the dog, probably,” he nodded as if he knew what he was talking about.
“I suppose,” Draco murmured. It was a fair point. Theo, while the younger of the two, did love Winston. Maybe he didn’t want to disgrace him. Plus with all the tournament stuff going on… more people would be critical that his brother wasn’t chosen as a champion.
"I'll try my best," he said, sounding exhausted, "I'll talk to McGonagall about it too. She can do some snooping around to try and catch Umbridge with them," He told him and then nodded to himself, "Harry lives with the Dursleys. He doesn't know any better." He added - more to himself than Draco or Andromeda. "I'm not upset."
or else he won’t give us the points back!” Lavender Brown hissed and Harry scowled at her until she went back to her own potion.
It was... well, Harry had no idea where they were. An alley of some sort. Draco could see people walking by at the end of it and buildings all shoved together in a variety of colors. What caught his attention the most, however, was that where he normally might see a road was instead a river with walkways on either side. Boats floated by with flocks of people clicking photos and gaping in awe around them.
"I know why. It's because you can't find anything to complain about, right?" Harry needled. Draco glowered at him, "Not my eyes? My face? Arms? Legs?" He suggested. Draco was going to stab him. "Aw, guess you're just so taken with all me, huh?" He teased. "I know you like my-"
“-and sometimes you can get treated so it won’t be a problem. People would have found out about Pansy eventually,” he added, “I mean, she won’t be able to find a good marriage-”
“Come on, let’s sit down.” Draco told Hermione, ignoring Harry altogether. There was a soft sigh, but Hermione interlinked their arms, allowing herself to be dragged back to the Gryffindor table with small whispers to the other two.
to leave?" He asked. Griphook and Ollivander both raised their hands, "Wonderful. You two take them and the come back to get us out as soon as possible. The order will be Draco, Hermione, Harry -
Draco had never thought what it would be like to see the infamous Black sisters duel. Andromeda had once said they had been pitted against one another often as children. That they became so familiar with their dueling styles that the whole thing became a sort of routine. He now saw exactly what she meant. This could barely be classified as a duel. It was... something else entirely. A dance, maybe. It seemed to enrapture the attention of both sides as light flew back and forth while they each deflected and dodged with ease. The strikes were fast and consistent. Bellatrix was clearly breaking under the pressure of both her sisters. Neither were taking turns. Andromeda and Narcissa struck again and again with little mercy as Bellatrix was reduced to going completely on the defensive. She alternated between protego charms and summoning bits of the earth to rise and serve and physical barriers between her and the spells.
“You thought so?” Ted asked, appearing from seemingly nowhere so that Draco jumped, “Good! I thought we could go to a football match this summer to give you the real muggle experience. You do know about football, right?”
"Wonderful," he said and then grinned, "Hello, Ginny!" He added when he saw a pair also moving towards them, "Luna. Neville." He greeted. The three waved and then did a double take when they saw the handcuffs. Neville swore and marched over.
“It was… quite eventful.” He said coolly and glanced over at the table. Aside from Harry, Neville, Ginny, and Luna there was Marcus Belby, Cormac McLaggen, and Tristam.
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude.” She began, looking downright horrified. Zoe chuckled, looking Hermione over.
this baby yet so -" He began, but was cut off by someone clearing their throat. He turned. Sure enough, Remus and Dora were there alongside Sirius, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and a few others who were trying to get a good look at the bundle in Dora's arms. The Brazilian witch - Sabelia? The one who got you to speak the truth or whatever - was cooing in complete awe at Teddy from beside Remus.
“I don’t care what it is, there is no reason to be flinging food in the goddamn air! This isn't a circus, my
the Dark Lord, renowned and powerful wizard, can also do wandless magic, Harry.” He said as he walked into the classroom. He slammed his books down on his desk. “Just my thoughts on the matter.” He said dryly. Harry's jaw clenched as he leveled him with a cold look. Draco only shrugged in return, but figured he wouldn't push the matter if he was going to get
"What do you want?" Draco asked, sounding defeated even to his own ears. Harry reached over absently to put a hand to his forehead. Draco had no idea what that was supposed to do. He had seen Hermione do it a few times when someone was sick... was it some weird muggle remedy? That hardly seemed like a sufficient treatment when they apparently had machines to do all this marvelous medicine. He should ask Burbage about it.
"Hawthorne," Ollivander said simply, "Gregorovitch - rest his soul - and I disagreed on many things, but Hawthorne was not one of them. It makes wands of paradoxes," he mused, "You know, the blossoms of Hawthorne heals, but when you cut their branches they give the distinct smell of death. They are often for more... complex wizards. Good for both healing magic and curses," he noted.
Here he was with a broken wand, Ron gone, a horcrux he couldn't destroy, and Draco... God he didn't even know where to begin with Draco.
“I see.” Severus commented and wiped his hands as his potion started to cool. He casted a preserving spell on it and turned to Draco fully for the first time. “And, pray tell,
“Declare yourself!” She shouted at the door. A few others also grabbed at their wands, atmosphere tensing slightly. Draco grabbed the watch again before reaching for his own wand as well.
“Alright, point taken.” Harry snorted, running his hand through his hair. He grimaced at the door. “Hey… when we get back to school. Could… you, um, make me a sleeping draft or something?” He asked. Draco tilted his head. “Just… I’ve… you know, after last year with… everything. I haven’t been sleeping well.” He said slowly, eyes falling to the floor.
“I’m a pureblood, and my family is one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight,” Neville told him flatly. Oh. Draco hadn’t actually known that. He knew some of the Sacred Twenty-Eight were wonkers, but he supposed they might still be considered a step up from his muggleborn bestie.
"Draco Malfoy?" One woman asked, holding out her hand, "Hi. I'm Andrea Hanson," she greeted and Draco raised an eyebrow.
Draco considered. It was a question he found himself asking as well. Why? It was a complicated question, sure. With an equally complicated answer, but… he could narrow it down.
She was most certainly not allowed to die. If she did then not only was Draco going to be pissed, but Andromeda, Ted, and Remus were going to be so heartbroken and - fuck. She had a baby now. Giving a frustrated hiss through his teeth he climbed up a pile of rubble to try and -
“I want to make a deal,” Draco said slowly and Voldemort blinked, “Spare my friends and I’ll hand it over,” he said. A cold laugh followed.
"I did warn you about this," Draco said as he watched his cousin take a few deep breaths, "I wrote you about our first and second year over the summer. This isn't that unlike him." He said. Andromeda shushed him for a moment, eyes flicking Sirius over with concern as he continued to look at the ceiling as if hoping to find answers somehow carved into the roof of his dead brother's bedroom.
The point was that Draco was trying to be agreeable to the DA stuff even if his schedule was becoming… very full.
. Nobody really believed him when he said Harry Potter got arrested," he added offhandedly and Draco grinned when Harry took a long breath.
“Only if you broke the vow,” Draco shrugged, “It’s not like I’m going to ask you to learn to juggle fire, Blaise. Just don’t betray me. That shouldn’t be too hard, right?” He asked, giving him a once over. Blaise shifted slightly. “Look, I’m not risking anything. Either you teach me the spell or take your chances with the Dark Lord.” He said and put a hand on the side of his arm. “Which do you think is safer?”
"I... don't think Draco is quite up for robbing a bank," Sirius said slowly. "He can barely sleep for more than an hour at a time. Remus says some of the stuff they did-" he started and then stopped at the look on Harry's face. "He'll get better. He will. You just need to give him time."
“Your muggle family sounds so awful,” Draco sighed and settled a bit more into the bed, “You can tell me if you want.”
“You haven’t gotten a good dressing down before and now that Sirius yelled at you for being a moron, you’re pouting.” Draco said and shrugged.
to trust you with it! I just can’t include you when you’re trying to fight me on everything. I’ve messed up, but I’ve also already helped a lot of people, Harry. I want to keep doing it. Pansy, Blaise, Astoria - I know you don’t think those are people worth saving, but I could have been one of them. I want to keep helping them. If all I can do is keep them alive and keep them from joining Voldemort then I think I’ve done a good damn job. And I’m going to get my parents on that list and I’m going to figure out every way to block Bellatrix and Donovan and the Carrows and Voldemort from getting to you, okay? I just am. I’m sick of having the
Sure enough, Harry exited Hagrid’s hut after giving some more comforting words before jogging next to him. Draco sighed. He turned to look at him. Harry gave a weak smile.
“Maybe you should stay and help clear this away…” He said slowly and Draco raised an eyebrow. “...or not.” He muttered. “Just trying to keep you from getting killed.”
“Checkmate.” Ron beamed as he leaned back into his chair. Harry clapped his shoulder in sympathy. He really hoped that git died in this tournament.
“Yeah, I bet this bloke would make a good potions professor, huh?” He asked. Harry gave a slight shrug.
“Yes,” he snapped and Draco jumped, “Yes, I… was thinking of a friend of mine who was a healer.” He muttered. Draco curiously nodded. Severus never mentioned many friends. He wasn’t even sure the man knew any healers. He wondered who it could be. “You are ending up infuriatingly similar to her in some ways.” He grumbled and snatched up a key.
“I can use it for whatever I want,” He said and stood up, “Come on. I got muggle studies homework.” He sighed. Neville jumped up. While Neville himself wasn’t in muggle studies, he had very much grown fond of doing Draco’s homework with him. As a fellow pureblood, he found most of what muggles did as baffling as Draco did. “We’re learning about
“Me?!” He gasped, correctly deducing he was the idiot in question. “You’re the one who took a bludger for me!”
"It was you," he promised and leaned back to better meet his eyes, "It was really good. I'm surprised it held up even afterwards for a little while." He mused. Draco nodded. He hadn't even known such a thing was possible. "What were you thinking of?" He asked and Draco narrowed his eyes. As if he needed to say. Harry must have figured the same, because he laughed. "Well, either way, I'm really proud of you."
“He’s inches away, ladies and gentlemen… Malfoy hasn’t used his wand yet, so there is no foul… The bludger is coming back! Look out!” Lee shouted right as Harry’s hand closed around the snitch. Draco grimaced and shoved him to the side, sending him spiraling away right as the bludger made impact with Draco’s shoulder. There was a sharp pain that radiated through his shoulder as he fell. He was lucky they were both close to the ground because he found himself falling so that he rolled across the grass as someone screamed.
. Absolutely nothing. Draco was pretty sure he reacted on instinct alone, which meant that his actions were not to be taken seriously. If he had actually thought the scenario through, then obviously things would have turned out differently.
“I’m sorry it’s covered in blood,” he said and knelt down, “Perhaps I will find you some newer clothes later, but for now you can have this.” He said and handed the tie over. Dobby stood frozen for a moment until Draco gently took one of his hands to place the tie in it. “I, um, hope you like the colors.” He added, lifting his eyes to meet his father’s hardened expression. “Red and gold are for my school house.”
“Is it? I mean, it seemed easy enough to ask a girl. I’m sure you two are just cowards.” He said. Both Harry and Ron froze.
Draco pulled out his wand. From beside him, he felt a slight brush of skin and saw a ripple in the air. He smiled a little. Harry. They wouldn't have time for a proper goodbye. He swallowed, letting his fingers reached out and brush against the silk.
“What now?” He asked, jolting Draco from his internal tangent. He shook his head - dismissing the thoughts entirely.
“Draco, you need to stop moving your feet-” Hermione tried, but Draco clearly had enough with the whole situation because he decided instead to launch himself at Harry in hopes he would catch him. This just sent them both tumbling to the ground.
This would be a good time for Draco to talk. He had been frozen during the conversation so far. His heart was thumping wildly and throat tight. Slowly, he straightened himself up.
"Wait," Ron said and held up a hand from where he was sitting in an armchair, "Shut up. Both of you just... shut up." He said and Draco bit his lip as he pointed between them. "This - this is happening?" He asked. Harry and Draco both glanced at one another warily before nodding. "No, I need verbal confirmation. Are you dating?"
Draco had never liked her. Well, Hermione had never liked her, which meant that Draco didn't like her. It wasn't a new thing. This girl had been sharing a dormitory with Hermione for
Despite the pain, Draco tried to look around for the others. Neville was staring at Bellatrix a few feet away. His nose was bloodied, but other than that he seemed relatively unharmed. Ginny was on the ground, hands holding her ankle with Kingsley Shacklebolt in front of her. Tristam and Zoe - oh, thank
“Why? Whose is it?” Harry asked and Draco looked at him. This was a joke, right? Draco looked down, flipping more through the pages. He wondered if there was any good blackmail material in it… though, admittedly, the name itself was enough blackmail to last him a lifetime. The Half-Blood Prince? He wondered if this Half-Blood Prince decided to give himself an edgy nickname due to a group of prats walking around calling themselves ‘the Marauders’.
“Sometimes babies come early,” Lily told him, re-entering the room with another bag. “Now, calm down. We talked about this, remember? How many babies are allowed in this house?” She asked James, eyes twinkling with amusement. James, on the other hand, looked downright terrified.
“Harry,” Theo said, perhaps seeing a potential ally “Who were you cheering for during the World Cup?” He asked and Draco felt himself relax a little when Harry immediately latched onto the conversation. Even Ron begrudgingly allowed himself to be dragged into the discussion with the absurdity of the match.
“Who?” Ron asked, appearing suddenly by Harry’s other side, “Hey. Mate. Calm down.” He said, but Harry didn’t calm down. He babbled helplessly for a moment, trying and failing to form words. Eventually, some semblance of a story came together. Mr. Weasley was attacked by a snake and there was blood and it was bad and he was in the Ministry of Magic.
“It’s going to be bloody embarrassing when I can’t even make the team with my best mate as captain,” he muttered. Draco agreed, but he wasn’t going to tell Ron that. He tilted his head. Maybe he could get in a good hex… Ron would probably feel worse if he did that though. As if he couldn’t make it off his own talent.
” He said and Neville fixed him with a baffled look, “You know, since Harry’s straight.” Draco clarified in case that was somehow a question. Neville tilted his head, looking genuinely surprised by this information.
“The Dark Lord has risen, Draco. We always feared that might be the case and acted accordingly. It is one thing to stretch tradition slightly, but if your father and I had gone about telling you to live as you pleased…” She took a long breath, “We would all be dead already. Lucius is already a Death Eater. I am already his wife. Our fates are sealed.” She said and reached out to him again. “Just take advantage of all you’ve been given… stay with your friends. Stay safe.
"You ruined my dress," she told Avery coldly and then spit on him before turning to Draco, "I told you I could stab well," she added. Draco didn't know how to respond so he did his best to make sure Avery was actually dead before shoving her towards where Fleur was looking around wildly for her mother and sister. Okay. Right.
His hands brushed against Ginny’s arm. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Hermione’s name was whispered.
She managed, echoing Draco's words right as a haunting scream fell over them all, sending Draco's skin prickling.
In the end, Harry got extra points for saving Gabrielle. Draco was hardly surprised. Gryffindor got extra points for breaking the school rules all the time so it wasn't too shocking that Harry got extra points for breaking the tournament rules.
“I… can agree with that sentiment.” He said slowly. Moody leaned forward. He smelled strangely of knotgrass, which might have been pleasant on someone else. Without warning, he reached forward to grab the front of his robes.
Also, I deeply enjoy the idea that Draco is just like "I would rather say I’m a horrible, awful sexist then admit I'm just jealous" bc it's the level of dramatic he is.
“She’s already going with Diggory.” Harry sighed and stared at the ceiling. “Girls are hard.” He said to nobody in particular. Ron gave a muttered agreement.
“Of course. Your mother and I were quite close. I was the one who introduced her to Lucius. Like you said, you hadn’t been born yet when I died. I still helped her choose the name.” He smiled lightly with an approving nod, "I'm glad you turned out okay. She was worried with the Malfoy lineage magic there might be some complications," he mused. Draco tried not to wince at that, “What brings you here?”
“No,” Theo translated for him, “No, you wouldn’t have. You know why you wouldn’t have? Because you actually care about him.”
“I see,” Longbottom said slowly, “Why was your aunt imprisoned?” He asked. Draco blinked. That… was actually a good question. She was a Death Eater, yes, but so were his parents and Snape… they all managed to find a way out of their sentences. Biting his lip, he turned to look over Longbottom for a moment.
“I think I’m going to pay a visit to some muggles,” he said and Bellatrix lifted a brow, “They’re moving Potter today.” He added. Bellatrix brightened.
“And, um, who did you invite?” Harry asked and then paused when his newly working eyes landed on McLaggen. “You
“I mean, I’m going to tell you something bad that happened and I don’t want to hear you using it as an excuse for me not to do what I need to do in the future.” He snapped. Harry pursed his lips. It was an unspoken understanding that Harry was still watching him… and Draco wouldn’t mention it. After all, if they didn’t talk about it then they didn’t fight. Harry wouldn’t ask questions and Draco didn’t tell him to knock his bullshit off. “Can you do that?”
“Come off it. No, it isn’t,” he said and Hermione crossed her arms. “Slytherin could talk to snakes-”
“Well, quite frankly, I think it’s me,” Theo called, “I sleepwalk. Seems reasonable enough,” he said. Draco paused to beam at him from across the Hall. Theo only smirked before giving a small shrug in return.
“Don’t you start,” Harry sighed. His hair was still dripping, letting droplets fall against his glasses as he wrinkled his nose, “Ron already told me off about it. Said I should have left Fleur’s sister behind because she wasn’t actually in danger,” he said and paused, “It feels kind of obvious in hindsight.” He said, rubbing the back of his neck. Draco grimaced. It was, actually. His own temper tantrum seemed a bit silly now as well.
Enter Neville. There was probably nobody in the world nicer than Neville. He swore his life on it. He was helpful and sweet and Draco was pretty sure he was helplessly and completely in love with him. Well, sort of. Draco didn't think he was interested in snogging him or doing any of that kind of stuff, but... well, it was confusing.
“I won’t bother with you two,” he added to Crabbe and Goyle, “I kind of doubt you would understand anyways. And hey, Greengrass? You’re a gem. Tell your sister I said congrats on getting sorted into Slytherin. Though it can hardly be considered an honor with your stupidity muddying Salazar’s name.” He said and lowered his wand, “All of you can go fuck yourselves.” He smiled before giving a mocking bow and turning away.
"Don't be stupid! Also, tell Severus he owes me ten galleons." He added. Draco paused to turn and looked at him incredulously. Severus and Sirius were in contact? Willingly? They were betting? Sirius' grin widened, "We keep tally of how much you and Harry pine for the other. This week it was Harry who pined the most so I get the money." He explained with a shrug.
“Yeah!” Harry said, sliding back in. From behind him, Vernon Dursley had turned downright purple with anger. Draco narrowed his eyes and immediately the muggle paused in walking towards Harry. “You’ll play on the quidditch team next year, right? McGonagall said you could,” he told him eagerly.
Ron stared at him. For the first time since this stupid fight started, Draco saw concern in Ron’s eyes.
...no way. Draco went back to the peppermint he was slicing, feeling his face heat up. The only thing Slughorn would like more than knowing and being responsible for successful wizards is knowing and being responsible magical
It really was a shame he no longer had a fortune to rely on because he was most certainly not getting a well-paying job with this sort of educational background. He wondered how much money Dumbledore had… maybe Draco could sue him.
me,” Draco muttered, “Ditching is what you did to Harry earlier that had him end up in Borgin and Burkes.”
“Fleur,” Draco interrupted gently, “Maybe you need to… um, soften your words a bit?” He asked. Fleur stared. “I’m not the best at it either,” he shrugged, “But people don’t always like it when you’re blunt.”
Harry nodded. He actually wasn't familiar with any other wizarding schools outside Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang, but that didn't really matter right now.
“Shut up. Nobody cares that you knew,” Draco sighed, “Look, nobody else on my side gets it. They aren’t going to offer you second chances. Part of me believes that maybe I should let you rot,” he told her and Pansy scowled.
Of course Voldemort was fighting. He had no choice given that all his reinforcements had failed. If they could just... just... kill the snake...
that’s really important for me to know because if Voldemort finds out then we’re screwed.” He reasoned, “The thing is… I… think
“I’m sorry, ” Moody scoffed, ”Are we not going to address the obvious here? The boy was taken by Bellatrix Lestrange and we only knew he was even alive because of Severus. Now, we’re just going to trust him?” He asked.
“Seamus Finnigan told me you turned into Umbridge’s pet,” he sneered back, “What? Are you going to tell her about the DA next?” He added in a low whisper. Draco tilted his head a bit.
“I… am super touched by your confidence in me, but my plan absolutely might have casualties. You realize that, right?”
“Go.” Draco told her, “I’ll take care of Ron. Don’t leave him alone.” He said and Hermione gave a firm nod before sprinting off after him. “Okay… okay, let me see your leg real quick. I can fix it enough to get us back.” He murmured and set Ron down. Ideally, they wouldn’t do this with a werewolf running amok, but he couldn’t think of anyplace safe to keep them. Better to just aim for speed.
“So?” Harry asked, voice rising. “Why can’t he spend time with someone other than blood purists? Why
is the meaning of this!?” McGonagall gasped, her eyes darting from the four of them to the unconscious troll behind them. Draco turned slowly to assess the situation.
“Can you do me first? The sooner I can forget all of this the better.” He said and Harry pulled his robes back.
"We should leave soon," Hermione said a few hours as they sat on the cliff outside the cottage, watching the waves crash down below. He turned to her as Ron hummed in agreement.
“Are we supposed to be seeing something?” He had asked, ignoring Harry looking at him with a slight frown. Theo grimaced a bit, taking a step back as a few of the other Slytherins murmured to one another. Draco had forgotten he would be able to see them too. Most children of Death Eaters had seen death in one form or another. It was in the name after all.
tell us what happened? I'm failing History of Magic." She added. Draco stared. He was pretty sure nothing about that sentence made sense so he turned back to stare blankly at Harry. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“We should probably focus on this,” he said and Harry looked at him for a moment before nodding before refocusing back on the streets of London. He twisted his hands together, eyes roaming with a bit of uneasiness as they tried to find the right phone booth.
." He growled and Draco quickly moved as Severus also stepped into the circle, calmly placing himself in front of Neville. Draco's eyes widened. Not after Andromeda.
"It wasn't like we didn't visit," he added on, a bit indignantly, "We even brought Teddy with us for a couple weeks. Hermione just got annoyed that we missed our exams," he said, shaking his head. "Sirius was the only one we should have trusted." He added and Draco gave a hum of agreement. "So, yeah. There you go. Maybe the Ministry can stop labeling it as one of the biggest unsolved cases in the country now." He grumbled. Another student raised their hand.
“Really? What does my name being Henry have to do with the kind of people my parents were?” He asked skeptically. Draco shook his head.
....right. Draco may not like Dumbledore, but he would admit the man was tragically smart. Giving a slight shake of his head, he placed the quill with the rest of his things before glancing back down at the letter to see that the golden ink had disappeared. He turned to see if Ron or Harry had noticed anything, but both had gone eerily silent.
“Didn’t stop everyone from thinking it was Harry,” he said under his breath as an attempt anyway. Ron shrugged.
"Fantastic." Severus sighed and Draco laughed. He was about alleviate some of the dread about being forcibly taken in by all these good-doers and assure him that he still had his mother for all his shit-talking needs when there was a snap from behind them. He turned - a little puzzled to see two wizards in a set of ministry robes looking back at them with their wands out.
“Boo, Harry.” Draco said, completely deadpan. Ron snorted and before Harry could throw back a retort of his own, Dumbledore walked to the podium.
“Hey,” Harry said suddenly as they descended from the sky, “You never told me why you could see thestrals.” He said. Draco grimaced. He was absently patting the side of his own thestral’s neck before remembering Harry, Neville, and Luna were the only other ones who could see them.
“Really,” He said and grimaced at the rows of books. “This is not how I thought I would be spending my Saturday.” He grumbled and then lightly nudged Draco, “But Hermione would be thrilled, wouldn’t she?” He asked. Draco gave a weak smile in return.
“ZOE!” A voice yelled and Draco turned just in time to see Zach get his square in the chest with a burst of green light. Zoe screamed. Shit.
“Unless they were packaged that way,” she pointed out. Tristam’s face fell. “Sorry, Draco.” She added as Tristam threw up his hands.
“She’ll be fine,” Draco told him and looked over his shoulder, “Harry will be too.” He murmured and unwrapped the bandages. “Ah, lovely.” He said and pulled out his wand.
“I’m not scared.” He said. Draco smiled and picked up a hunk of mashed potatoes from the center of the table. In one, fluid motion he flicked it onto Harry’s face. Ron cackled as Harry froze.
That at least got Draco’s attention. He momentarily stopped his internal rampage to stare over the table. Predictably, he was talking about the new DADA professor. Draco was reminded of a chihuahua (which was a type of dog that muggles would sometimes owned… because muggles often owned dogs. There’s a fun fact for you). In the sense that both the woman and a chihuahua were small, ugly, and intimidating in a strange way.
"I, um, I - I don't even know anybody with brown eyes. Who are you talking about?" He asked nervously and Draco began to laugh. "I -
“What are we supposed to do, Draco? Let a bunch of people die?” Sadie asked, raising an eyebrow. “I mean, what did Dumbledore say?”
"Either you help me finish that potions essay or I get to pet you. Otherwise we will forever remain at odds." Harry told him stoically. Draco opened his mouth to gape for a moment. Partly at the audacity, but also at how he was able to keep a straight face.
“They do have Diggory.” He pointed out. Draco shrugged. Fair enough. One good player meant nothing though. Even Diggory couldn’t save his failure of a house. Plus, he was a seeker. Maybe he could hold his own against Ravenclaw and Slytherin, but certainly not Harry. The idiot almost died to catch the snitch against Slytherin. Draco could appreciate Diggory’s talent, but was pretty sure the guy was smart enough to not be willing to die over a school quidditch match. Harry couldn’t say the same.
us, the git. He was my best mate for five years and now what? He just leaves and doesn't bother with writing?" He asked, shaking his head, "I have half a mind to write Winston and ask what is going on with him." He grumbled. Draco hated this. "Have you heard from him?" He asked to Draco and he quickly shook his head. Hermione, on the other hand, frowned.
Really?” It asked and Draco gave a sharp intake. “What? Oh, come on. Let’s talk it out. You like talking about your feelings now, right?” It asked.
“Hey, Harry.” Draco said and shook his shoulder, “Wake up.” He said. Harry didn’t wake up. He thrashed and yelled out - effectively waking up half the dormitory as Draco felt a stab of alarm. “Harry.
“I found out my mother was the one who disowned me,” Draco shrugged as he sniffed slightly, “And Jafar isn’t getting credit for all his hard work because of Aladdin.” He explained. Hermione closed her eyes and leaned against his shoulder.
Draco was a lot of things... he preferred to think a fool was not one of them. For that reason, he would leave this alone. For now.
When Draco was little, his parents had told him all the secret passageways and routes to get to and from the Slytherin common room to basically anywhere in the castle. Draco even remembered his father bringing him a map of Hogwarts at one point so he could color in all the places he planned to go for when the time arrived. That meant getting there wasn’t too much trouble.
“Why can’t you lot just let me have a pet?” He complained and turned to where Hedwig was minding her own business, “Has she tried to eat you?” He asked. Hedwig blinked a few times before turning to Harriet as if considering. Then she gave a small hoot. “Ridiculous.” Ron muttered. Draco laughed and put his hand behind his back, internally praying nobody noticed the bandages around his fingers.
“Oh, you’re missing some poise there, Mistress Parkinson,” he mocked. Without thinking, Draco put a hand on his arm, keeping him from getting up. Pansy may not look it, but she was scrappy. If Theo got too close, he could lose a hand. Puzzled green eyes met his.
"No, thank you. I have my own plans to get out if here without your mumbo jumbo nonsense." He said. Draco was a little offended they were calling magic 'mumbo jumbo' but sure. If Jenkins wanted to stay then who was he to judge? Bidding his friend goodbye, Draco apparated again.
“You defeated the Dark Lord. Twice. Stop talking nonsense,” Draco told him and rolled his eyes, “Are you the Heir of Slytherin?” He asked. Harry slowly shook his head. “There you go then. It’s done,” he said and dipped his quill in some ink, “Maybe you should find the real Heir if this is bothering you so badly.”
“So this isn’t some ploy to get their attention?” Severus finally asked as he poured in some white powder. The liquid turned a bright blue, bubbling slightly. Draco scowled.
"FOR HARRY!" A few people repeated and it was then that the wards went down, sending a spiral of light bursting over them. Draco steeled his nerves and went to move forward. McGonagall pulled him back.
Draco wasn’t sure how his life had gone so wrong. If someone would have told that Hogwarts would lead to him becoming peacekeeper to a half-blood and a bloodtraitor with his best friend the mudblood in Gryffindor then he might have just agreed to go to Durmstrang.
“My mom has one of those,” he said instead, gesturing to the bracelet on Tonks’ wrist. “I like what you’ve done with it.” He added. Tonks glanced down before giving him a small smile. It was the Black family crest… with a few modifications. Instead of crows there were badgers (probably an ode to her unfortunate Hufflepuff origins) and where the original house motto had been (
“That brings me to my next point,” Ron said, tapping his wand against a knight, “They’ll assume Hermione and I are with Harry.” He added as Harriet slid up to the pieces and started knocking over Ron’s side. Draco rolled his eyes.
he groaned and when Harry tilted his head, raised a both hands, "Look, she learned through Dora that we aren't going to abide by those sorts of customs. However, Andromeda - who I love to death even though she did this to me - does not know how to give a normal sex talk because she never had one."
“Not as friends,” he said with a nod “Um. I can meet you in the Great Hall at nine on Saturday?” He offered and Draco nodded, beaming up at him. “Great. I’ll see you then.” He said, the illusion of confidence starting to build up again. Draco laughed as he left, turning back to see Harry gaping.
“I’m bored,” the eleven-year-old Harry declared and Draco rolled his eyes, “I want to sit next to you.”
“Severus already knew I went to Borgin and Burke’s before school.” Draco told him, frustration rising. “He also already knew I’ve been meeting with Montague again. Which reminds me,
Draco shouted back and cringed, “Ah,” he choked and Hermione’s hand pressed against his leg. “It… It’s okay… I think I shattered my shoulder,” he managed.
“I fought Voldemort on the back of my professor’s head,” he said calmly. Andromeda paused. “Also, I helped win the House Cup by accident,” he sighed, “Slytherin won’t ever take me,” he muttered, kicking the ground. Andromeda pursed her lips.
want to do that? I'll also remind you that Ron says we're already married if you're looking for a loophole." He added and Draco couldn't help, but snort at that.
“Sirius-” He said and then gasped, collapsing to the ground as he grabbed at his scar with a cry of pain. Draco grabbed his arm.
“Before the minister came, he thought it prudent to give me his spare. He seems to be under the impression I will entertain your side quests as he has,” she told him before sitting the quill down. Then sighed. “Severus has stopped Potter’s occlumency lessons.” She finally said. Draco’s eyes snapped up.
“You wouldn’t really turn me over, would you?” Draco asked, a bit incredulously. He wouldn’t. Couldn’t. Not Theo. Sure, Draco knew he could wilt under the gaze of authority… He liked to think you could do the right thing by following the systems put in place, but... he wouldn't, right? "Theo, they don't even believe that Voldemort is really back!" Draco pointed out, "How can you think they'd be a good ally in any of this?"
"Blaise?!" He whispered and looked over his shoulder before pulling him further into the alley, "What the Hell are you doing here?" He whispered, "It's dangerous for you to be out of the safe house-"
Only, not really. Over the years and through the trials his home had shifted from his parents high-end real estate to Andromeda’s cottage. Even now, this wasn’t the place he had grown up in. Things had changed. So had the people here.
“Look at yours!” Harry said and Draco glared back. “And you’re admitting there is something you are hiding.” He said. Draco tossed the book to the side and threw his hands up.
“Harry annoying you?” He asked as a greeting. Draco nodded and banged his head against Ron’s shoulder. “Hm. Yeah, I reckon you two are going to be at each other’s throats a lot this year. He said and offered a brightly wrapped candy. “Want one? It tastes like pineapple.”
“The ministry has arrested your husband,” Voldemort told her, eyes not leaving Draco. ”They’ll be raiding your house. We need to collect everything we’ve stored here.” He said. Draco waited.
“When Voldemort killed Lily, the last of her magic went towards protecting Harry,” He started with. Harry shook his head. So? What did that matter right now? “It is the only known instance of a person’s magic managing to protect their child from a killing curse, but… similar things have occurred.” He said slowly.
"He loves you, you know. Not even the Dark Twat can take that away." Sirius promised and Harry swallowed all of his internal mourning to smile at him. He was probably right. Sirius was right about most things, after all. That didn't make it hurt any less... but he did need to do what was best for Draco. And if Draco needed to be away from them. From him... then Harry would just have to accept that.
“Oh, come now. We both know Dumbledore is going to give us a hundred points when Harry accidentally sneezes and saves us all from Voldemort’s ex-house elf that the school for some reason decided to hire.” He said and the room started buzzing. “You know it’s true - take a hundred points, I don’t even care-”
“Where’s Draco?!” He heard someone (it sounded like Neville) call out. Bellatrix cleared her throat.
Or, at least, Draco did. He wasn't sure that anyone else was being forced into McGonagall's office to discuss their future. Perhaps she realized that Draco and Hermione were the only ones who might be interested in having a job. Draco was slightly convinced that Harry might just solve Hogwarts mysteries until he died and Ron would figure out a way to dodge life decisions in the same manner he dodged professors collecting homework assignments.
“My point exactly. He put a monster in here to kill muggleborns, didn’t he?” She asked and Draco took a long breath.
His fingers trembled and Draco put down his quill to regain his poise. The thought that he no longer had a home felt like a stab to the chest. He had failed his family and was now losing everything. Taking a deep breath, he continued to write.
him? And make him do all the housework like a slave?” He demanded. Molly’s face dropped a little at that, the anger evaporating as quick as it came.
They vastly outnumbered the Death Eaters. However, the giants, dementors, and other werewolves did cause some... setbacks.
To be continued then. And continued it was. Severus had done exactly what he said he would do. He collected Harry and Hermione and brought them to where Ron and Draco had been waiting in the hospital wing. Black was in custody after Severus spewed some bullshit about them being confounded… with Draco trying to stop them, naturally. Normally, Draco might be pleased that Severus painted him as a hero here, but now…
“Draco?” She asked and he shakily got up and picked up his fallen wand. “Enough of this. Kill him.” She said and Draco looked back at where Winston was trembling in front of them. “Now!” She shouted, making him jump. Draco swallowed. “I can assure you my ire will include more than a simple cruciatus.” She warned, “I brought you to the Dark Lord. I vouched for you. You are of my blood.” She said and stepped towards him. “You will
"What," Voldemort said slowly as he turned to look at where several of his Death Eaters were now falling to the ground, "Is this?" He asked. Bellatrix fell next to Rodolphus, whispering spells over him as he began to convulse. Draco grimaced. She could maybe save a few of them, but certainly not all. From his place behind Voldemort, Pettigrew made a squealing sound in alarm before also kneeling down to help. Draco didn't really think he would get very far.
bloody big he’ll be a real natural at keeping half of Gryffindor tower up to code.” He rolled his eyes. Ron’s shock wavered a moment into an air of uncertainty.
“Can I at least go to the Quidditch World Cup with Theo?” He asked and immediately regretted it. Fred appeared and swooned.
“WE’RE SKIPPING CLASS?!” Harry shouted back and McGonagall cleared her throat loudly from where the teachers were sitting.
“You should ask her out,” Draco announced as he flopped down in front of Harry one morning. Harry choked on his porridge, eyes widening as he looked around them for a moment before spinning back towards Draco.
"There are different types of healers, Mr. Malfoy. I would advise you stay away from pediatrics," she mused and then looked down at her papers, "The potions you're working on with Mr. Longbottom... have you considered doing more on that?" He asked. Draco tilted his head.
“Thanks,” he sighed. He didn’t want to talk about Theo… or the confusing feelings he had brought up. Draco knew he cared about him… and he
“Can’t or won’t?” Harry interrupted, “Why can’t you just let me-” he began and cut himself off. He looked so frustrated… Draco wanted to help, but what was he supposed to do? Back out? “Draco,
"Come on," she said gently, taking his hand. "We're close. I promise we're close to being done." She told him and Draco let himself numbly be led away from the body. Despite the fact the fighting was ramping up, everything seemed quiet. It let him stare at the ground - digesting the world around him. He could see Death Eaters on the ground - dead or unconscious as a few wizards Draco didn't recognized tied them up or levitated the bodies away. Hermione's hand kept him grounded as he saw the faces and-
keep doing this,” Draco sighed when Harry hugged him. This was becoming a concerning recurrence. He patted his back awkwardly. “This is only acceptable because I know you didn’t get any hugs as a child. This is clearly a cry for help.” He said blandly. Harry pulled away and flicked him.
,” Draco pointed out, thinking of Ted. Granted, he had little to no interaction with him throughout his stay with Andromeda (nor did she really press the issue), but he had still lived there. No complaints. Not one. Hermione groaned.
He turned, looking to the front of the hall to find the potions’ master staring innocently back at him. Draco wasn’t sure he had ever been betrayed like this before. He stared back, shocked and outraged before the letter gave a sharp hiss to regain his attention.
“Thank you.” He repeated. At his voice, Harriet turned, skin turning from dark green to a dazzling purple as she slid up his arm. He should have maybe been wary of snakes given what happened last year… and that snakes were the sign of the house he had been so callously rejected from… but he found her presence a welcomed addition.
Draco hissed and hit the side of his arm, "You selfish-" He started and then turned away, putting his hands on top of his head. "That... if you had actually left... without telling me..." He breathed out slowly, "I would have never forgiven you. Never." He whispered and looked up at the ceiling. No. No, no, no,
"Not Draco," Harry said and Sirius paused, "Hermione says he's on the third floor and they're probably torturing him or-" he cut himself off before he could finish. No. No, he wasn't... Sirius stared with horror starting to spread over his features.
that had been her. Evil. Maybe he would retaliate by putting spiders in her hair. The thought made him smile a little. It was only after thirty minutes that Hagrid had come with Harry in tow that everyone calmed down.
"Your life is already in danger as it is. Don't give the Dark Lord more reason to punish you." Jugson added. His mother nodded absently, not meeting anyone's eyes as she wrung her hands together, body shivering slightly.
. Draco had killed people at this point. He was beginning to be able to do it fairly well. The next time Romilda ended up drugging
“I swear to God, I’ll sneak into your dorm and cut off your toes. Go away.” He repeated calmly. Fleur snorted.
...brilliant. Draco watched as Ron and Harry faltered - eyes widening in alarm. Draco wasn’t sure why. Even as Lockhart went into more detail about his various crimes where he apparently oblivated people to take credit for their work, Draco remained unfazed.
“Well, I can’t really deny it,” Draco told her, “And quite frankly, he was a bit of a tosser without Merlin, who was in Slytherin, so…” He gave a small shrug. Ron shook his head at him in disgust.
“Hey, professor,” Draco called, cutting him off, “Is it true that last year you got told off by some blokes on a piece of parchment? Didn’t some guy called Prongs call you an ugly git? Hilarious that he can get the last word in - even in the afterlife.” He said. Severus spun around from Neville’s cauldron.
It was turning to spring now, air moving from freezing cold to… well, just cold. Most of the snow had melted away, but the glass of the greenhouses still held some frost as he stepped inside, letting the magic warm him.
happened to your trunk?” Hermione asked, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. His - ? Shit. Draco grimaced. He knew he had forgotten to do something. Stupid. Hermione frowned, running a hand over the scratched and ruined leather on the side.
“Your father was in that graveyard.” Harry told him. There it was. Draco wasn’t exactly surprised, but the reality of it stung all the same. Stung. Maybe that wasn’t the right word. It hurt in the same way you knew it would hurt to fall off your broom...but made the risky turn anyways.
Nobody needed to be told twice. Wards flickered to life and patronuses snapped into place as dementors began to descend down. Draco could see giants in the distance, crushing trees as they made their way towards the castle. Voldemort would know they had time to organize by this point... he just wouldn't realize how much. He turned to where lines of people readied themselves. Right. He took a long breath.
This time it was Dora who knocked him to the ground so that the curse narrowly missed them. Draco swallowed hard. People were parting, he realized. No. Not parting. They were
Draco’s heart stopped. He looked at the parchment between them - his mother’s handwriting scrawled out his name on the front. He picked it up for a moment, running his hand over the stationary. His parents always bought the special parchment from Diagon Alley.
“Congratulations on the Order of Merlin.” Draco said when Fudge had left. They were outside the ward where the others were speaking to Dumbledore - probably some nonsense as usual. “How
“I see,” his mother finally said, “I will collect some items - may I ask why he is here?” She asked. Her voice was calm, but Draco could see a hint of anxiety behind her otherwise blank features.
“It’s no wonder she hasn’t got any friends!” Weasley snarled after charms class and Draco felt Hermione stiffen by his side. Immediately, Draco made a noise of reproach and plunged his hand into his robes.
me?” He demanded, making everyone jump, “Harry! Why don’t you know these things? Fleamont Potter is a national treasure.”
him here. Sirius could recover quickly, sure, but within the next five seconds? After finding out that the last bit of his best friends had disappeared forever? Not likely.
"Oh, why thank you for that nice, romantically charged compliment. From you. The person I am dating." Harry said, completely monotoned. Draco bit back a laugh as Hermione and Ron stared at them, looking completely stunned. Hermione was the first to recover.
“I thought we were supposed to do this class individually?” He frowned. Harry eyed Slughorn warily as he crushed the moonstone into fine dust.
“No. No, you…” Draco trailed off before nodding. “I get it.” He finally said quietly. “It just sucks that it’s something I need to think about at all.” He muttered. Neville looked at him. “...sorry. That was probably, um, insensitive. Given that… uh, you know. Your parents being tortured into madness probably sucks more.”
“Draco.” Andromeda called, voice gentle. Petunia looked downright gray - eyes wide and mouth slightly open. Giving her one last dark look, he turned away. Damn bloody
"Oh, hey." Someone said and Harry spun around to see a Death Eater calmly walking towards them, "I thought you three were with Draco?" He asked. Harry frowned. The tone was oddly casual for someone who just discovered that prisoners escaped. This immediately changed when Dean and Luna emerged from the stairway. "Shit. You aren't-" he began, diving for his wand. There wasn't much of a chance though as Harry launched himself at the man, knocking them both to ground. There was a brief thud as Harry jerked the wand from his grasp.
“The disrespect has finally worn onto you,” Severus told him, lip curling. Draco tried not to look too exasperated by the declaration. “What Karkaroff and I discuss is none of your concern.”
He couldn't remember how to breathe. With shaking fingers, he grabbed the watch around his neck and squeezed it tightly in hopes that Ron had maybe thought to put something a little extra in there. Nothing.
“Shut up before I paint over you.” He threw back, “Sorry. Ignore him. He’s an attention seeker.” Sirius said. Regulus gave a small gasp. Draco offered a weak smile before looking down at his lap.
Normally, anyone who knew the basics of Harry would just shrug and say he had no parents to understand Draco's side of things and call it a day.
“Remus Lupin?” Ted’s voice asked, “Oh, he’s a good guy. He and James were first-years when we were getting ready to graduate, weren’t they?”
”Trying to learn, ” Jenkins informed him stoically. ”I told McGonagall it was hard to get a job as a felon in the muggle world and she said I could be the muggle studies professor, but I have to take some courses first - even if I can't do magic.” he shrugged. Harry shot him a wary look.
going to leave this house," Sirius said, voice tight and very clearly upset, "Because that... would be an overreaction and dangerous... and I guess that - even though I am the adult here - that some people feel the need to withhold information from me because I'm not to be trusted to behave reasonably." He said slowly and in a tone that had Draco slightly inching away from him.
"It's just so you won't hurt us," she said calmly, "I would feel a little better if you put that knife down too. We know what it can do." She tried. Draco did not lower the knife. "Draco," she began, but was cut off by the door opening again. He heard a soft gasp and Harry turned to find Fleur standing by with a tray of food. She stared at them all before placing the food down and walking past them.
"For the love of - you know what? It's your turn with the stone," he decided and turned back the empty space, "I am so sorry. Just... we can maybe talk a bit later without the idiots in my life around... and when Sirius stops dying." He added dryly to where his godfather was cackling so hard that Remus had to kneel down and remind him to breathe. "I... please, don't do this to me." Harry whispered closing his eyes. "Are you
For a moment, Draco thought he was going to pass out. His wand clattered to the ground, rolling somewhere in the cavern as he fell to his knees, trying to gasp for air. Somewhere in the distance he heard a screech and there was a yell of outrage that let Draco suddenly breathe again. He gasped as he fell forward.
“Yeah, but it’s the principle of the matter,” he grumbled and gave Harry an apologetic look, “Besides, you aren’t always the most, uh, observant,” He told him and Harry’s mouth dropped, “I just worry that I might turn my back and find you suddenly over the moon about some random first-year girl. Wait. That’s another reason love potions should be illegal. When you bring age into it then the law can get really fuzzy-”
“Yeah… by the way, did you tell him about the Dursleys?” Harry asked and when Draco tilted his head, shrugged. “I asked him why he was helping. He said something about my aunt and uncle. Then he mentioned you and said he should have known Petunia would be like that.” He said and shook his head, “Did you tell him my aunt’s name?”
He hoped she was coping okay with all of this. As it was, he wouldn't be keeping her much longer. Draco would be passing her to a... friend soon enough.
It was easy enough to get by all the Death Eaters readying for the fight with Harry's cloak and Draco's animagus form. Voldemort was among them, pacing back and forth with hissed order and growls as he tried to decide who would first make their attempt to get the Elder Wand out of the mirror. Draco inwardly smiled to himself. He had outsmarted the Dark Lord himself on quite a few occasions now, but the idea that he
As suspected, a crowd of people were filed inside. Draco bit his lip and knocked slightly at the door frame. The low murmuring fell completely silent. The Order all turned to him unanimously.
McGonagall waited until he finished before looking down at him with a stern expression that Draco was pretty sure would never leave her face and put a hand on his shoulder.
“I… I was trying to…” Draco said, words fumbling over one another. He gave an annoyed huff. “I watched a lot of people die this summer. I killed and I tortured people. I snuck some out and lied and… I can’t… I know I saved quite a few people, but… that inferius bothers me the most.” He managed. “Amelia Bones bothers me. Yaxley does too sometimes. It just isn’t the same with…” He trailed off. Harry tilted his head.
“The what?” Hermione asked. Sadie’s eyes flicked towards her with interest. Draco inwardly sighed, watching as she leaned over to smile prettily.
, I – both of you are so sensitive,” he cut himself off when Ron also glowered at him. “If all muggleborns were like Hermione, I would feel differently, but they’re not. They’re dumb and arrogant-”
"I am sad," he admitted, "Not in the mood to talk about it though. Go back to sleep." He said and Harry gave a soft sigh before he nodded into Draco's shoulder.
talk about? You being Neville’s boggart.” He said, hoping to drift far, far, far away from the topic of Theo. Severus’ lip curled.
"If I remember correctly, it took you three days to fix my throat when you sliced it open. You want to know what it would feel like if I used the cruciatus curse on you right now?" He asked her. She was shaking now, face going blue as she struggled to breathe. God, he fucking
Draco really fought hard against the whole thing. Why did they even need a name? Just call it fighting club or whatever and be done with it. Dumbledore didn't need an army. He needed a sense of compassion.
“Yes, you do.” She said. Draco looked at her. There were maybe some similarities, sure. They were all pale, with blonde - almost white - hair. That hardly meant anything though. His eyes were gray. Theirs were dark blue… or violet, perhaps.
“I hope not,” Harry grimaced, “He’s somehow found out about Cho. I don’t fancy her! Not really.” He grumbled, looking distressed, “I mean, she’s dating Cedric-”
you are!” She said upon seeing Draco and the others, “Come on. What did you find?” She asked, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him impatiently towards one of the couches by the fire. Harry and Ron hesitantly followed, picking their own seats surrounding a table. “Well?” She asked impatiently.
to the guy who murdered thirteen people with one curse?” Ron asked, looking somewhere between horrified and interested. “God, your family is so messed up.”
"Harry?" He called and watched when he paused, "I know I didn't listen when you asked me to stay, but... stay? Please?" He asked anyways. Something was wrong. Something was
“A pawn.” Ron said immediately. Draco looked at him, “I’m not saying that to be mean. Look.” He said and gestured to the board. Almost every other piece other than the pawns were labeled. Draco frowned and leaned back on the chair, “Look if you want to label people as chess pieces you have to treat them as such.”
"We're being a little mean," he said and Draco let his mouth dropped, "They didn't do that to us before we started dating. Ron was very patient." He pointed out. Draco continued his staring. Well, maybe he
"So, right," Draco began as they stood in front of Ron in an otherwise empty common room, "Don't be a prick about it,
"Yeah," Draco said putting his hands in his pockets, "People tend to do things like that when they're scared." He mused. Remus' eyes narrowed. "Look, I don't..." He looked down, "Do you remember my boggart in third year?" He asked, chuckling lowly. Remus looked him over for a moment before giving a small nod.
I know this is a magical world, but like... there was a sword... and the main villain DIDN'T get stabbed? Nonsense.
“None of your business,” Draco snapped back and then immediately reconsidered, “Tomorrow we’re supposed to go to a Beauxbatons party.” He added before he could fill in the blanks with something else. “Where’s Ron?” He asked, “You two did make up, right?”
Draco wasn’t really sure he liked this man. Just tell him whether his parents cared that he almost died already.
nice for you.” He said and Draco turned to him with a slight pout, “Draco, come on. You have a good heart, but I know you get some enjoyment being a prat most of the time. You need someone who can throw it right back at you.” He mused. Zoe gave a laugh as if that was somehow funny.
Unfortunately, he wasn't the only one to realize this. The mirror was quickly abandoned to make way for duels. His heart quickly stopped when one went towards Zoe. Draco yanked out his wand, helping disarm a few people near her, but Zoe seemed to be doing pretty good despite having bad luck. Spells came precariously close, but her she manage to deflect or dodge everyone.
“My kind?” Draco repeated and clenched one of his hands into a fist, “What has gotten into you? You’re acting like a psychopath-”
Andromeda had made him a scrapbook, which was super disgusting and Draco hated it, but also he couldn’t help but grin down at the photos of him and Dora together before flipping the page to a photo with him and Hermione arguing passionately over something or another while a distressed Ron sat in between them. There was another of him and Harry laughing that he also hated with every fibre of his being.
Draco Malfoy apology. I’m honored... Though you don't really need to apologize. This was mostly my fault.” He said and moved a bit closer so he could sit shoulder to shoulder with him. “So, since we’re all made up again-”
!” Draco defended and Hermione pushed him away with a huff. She didn’t look too terribly upset though. That was something.
“Two months.” Severus informed him and held up a finger, “Speak again and it can be six.” He warned. “Let me tell you something about Potter. His father was the same. He led his friends and family into danger every. Single. Year. It was what got him and his wife killed. You would do well not to fall into the same trap Lily Evans did.” He hissed and with that, turned to leave the room.
be fun to see Umbridge screech upon Sirius Black himself walking through the door to punch her in the throat, that probably wasn't best given that he was... you know. A fugitive. "Severus." He decided instead. Ron laughed. "Alright, maybe he wouldn't be the most reliable." Draco sighed.
“I don’t recall asking for anyone to help him,” Severus said coolly and Draco gave an internal whoop of triumph.
"Look at you. Breaking your poor mother's heart," he said as Dolohav chuckled lowly behind him, "Honestly, I expected so much better from you." He added on. Draco looked back at them, but didn't respond. Wouldn't. He simply waited calmly as the room seemed to grow smaller and smaller. His mother came back at some point, handing out cups of tea between teary-eyes sniffles and pointed looks at everywhere but Draco.
"To hurry up and send the letter to Sirius before she bites me," he answered and tilted his head, "Why are you writing Sirius?"
. I didn’t know we were going to meet in the corridor and I hadn’t really planned on saying anything! It just sort of happened and then it was over and I couldn’t figure out how to fix it and I never wanted to force you or anything, but-”
His skin prickled. Harry was still standing completely still - hand clenched around his wand, though Draco doubted it would do much good. The Dark Lord licked his lips, a greedy look of excitement hinting at his expression.
“It’s not that simple! I - I don’t want to talk about this. You’re making stuff up.” Draco said and completely abandoned his potion to pace, “Where even is Hermione anyways? She thinks she can just spew her muggle nonsense and-”
“I got tested before I went to Hogwarts. So did Pansy. The younger you are, the better chances there are that healers can fix something that is wrong,” he said and tilted his head, “How old did you think we were?” He asked as Ron coughed.
me. You were there too," Blaise said offhandedly. Theo dropped the piece of glass. "What? You were standing beside me when we looked into it, you weirdo." He said. Draco bit back a grin as he marched past. Normally, he would
soooo it's weird to discuss canon vs. non-canon things within a fanfic, but I figured I would clear up that one comment made about Andi bc I spent a lot of time wondering if I should leave that in, but figured I would let you in on some of my OG draft stuff.
How can someone just sneak someone else’s name in without them knowing? And he didn’t even offer to put our names in!”
to ask you, but then when her and Ted went to tea with the Grangers heard that Harry was dating you. So she told me who told Remus and, of course, Tonks by extension - and then Moody got involved because he was worried this would be a distraction-"
“No fucking way,” Draco gaped, “Severus spoke at Sirius’ hearing?” He asked and when Harry nodded, shook his head. The day was getting stranger and stranger. “Huh.”
“No, you’re good. Thank you, though. I know your animagus form is supposed to be for other things.” He said. Draco rolled his eyes.
“I’ve been waiting for this sort of thing for awhile,” Draco said instead and started leading them down the corridors. Another scream echoed down the hallways. He tried to remind himself that it was probably Neville or Luna playing along. While it would be obvious if they snuck out
Wait… Dobby knew. Draco had almost forgotten about his elf’s meddling… but Dobby must have seen his father slip it into Ginny’s things and wanted to warn them. Perhaps the reason Dobby hadn’t been responding to him all year wasn’t because Draco was no longer his master, but because his father had forbidden him to speak to Draco in fear he would reveal what was going on.
No offense, of course. Ginny and Harry were an adorable couple. He just meant… okay, he wasn’t sure what he meant. Except he did. Listen, Draco had a rough summer. Nobody should expect him to be coherent. Especially about emotions.
“Tell me to do it,” Draco whispered and his voice cracked towards the end, “Ask me to just once and I… I’ll do it.” He said.
Whatever else he might have been thinking was cut off by a sudden pop that had both him and Ron scrambling away. Ron shrieked, diving behind him as Draco yanked at his wand.
and leave my family unprotected!” He shouted, voice growing thick with emotion. Draco closed his eyes. “You… you…” He began and took a sharp breath, “How
“Eh,” he finally said, “I just think he had a good role model.” He told him lightly and smiled, “To his credit though… what an epic way to die.” He said. Sirius scoffed. “I’ve decided if I get caught then I need a cool death. Like… maybe I can make an explosion so I kill us all in one go. That type of thing.”
for him." She told venomously and stomped on his hand. Draco choked on the pain. The world... the world was... he was so tired... so.... so... tired...
“She wrote and asked how you were doing and I said we haven’t been talking. I honestly thought she was going to send me another howler.” Ron snorted and threw an arm around his shoulder, “I’m sorry, mate.” He said.
“The dragon was the first task. What if the second is something worse?” He asked her and McGonagall closed her eyes. “There has to be something.”
thing he could - was stay away. It killed him. Draco was in the same goddamn house as he was and Harry had to
“Ah, very good. Set it there.” He grumbled without looking away from the mirror. Draco curiously looked it over. He could see a few figures moving faintly, but none of them made a definitive shape. Draco dropped the book with a thunk and turned to leave. “Wait.” Moody called.
“Let’s see,” Hermione mused, tapping her wand against her arm, “All of us meeting… including Draco’s charming introduction on the train.” She added. Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh! When you two first rode your brooms like idiots,” she mused, “Our sorting, obviously-”
“Oh… no,” Ron said as he quickly walked after him, “Um, this might be my fault. I thought he was going to that because you two were still fighting and told him I was going to sic Hermione on him if he didn’t do something nice for you… hence the gift.” He explained, rubbing the back of his neck.
him (Draco actually used the word ‘abused’ once but everyone got a little huffy at that… whatever, he wasn’t wrong. Andromeda agreed) and then got thrust into a world where he was famous and found out everything about him was a lie… then just… didn’t have a mental breakdown about it. Weird.
Draco watched Alecto and Amycus fall to the ground before kicking their wands out of their hands. Sadie and Tristam walked over to grab them, taking off their robes to switch with them as Draco set to work tying them up.
Fleur wasn't so bad. She would write him (only in French, of course. She had informed him that he needed to keep working at it because he wasn't as fluent as he should be) asking about school among other things. Draco enjoyed writing back and mentioning everyone... but Bill Weasley. It was only after her third letter she broke and asked about him. Draco found it endlessly funny to heckle her about it. He was pretty sure she was keeping in contact with Bill as well, but using Draco to see if he had been mentioning her. Like he said - hilarious.
“I don’t remember you receiving an invite,” Draco said, turning away from the seats and walking towards the now empty end of the hall to where the sorting hat was placed idly on the stool... as if preparing for a new group of first-years to enter. He glanced around, making note of his own echoing footsteps and absence of even Filch. Draco bit his lip before picking it up. There were scorch marks on the side where Voldemort had tried to burn it, but ultimately the founders’ magic had protected it well. Taking one last stab towards Gryffindor’s courage he placed it on his head.
“You chose one of the most infuriating people to go with on purpose! The only person who would upset me more is-” He started and then cut himself off. Draco was actually a little offended. There was someone who would piss him off
“It was nice seeing you too!” He shouted, voice breaking at the end. He turned and hit the clock tower. All the frustration inside of him seemed to bubble over and break at once as he screamed in frustration.
”You know, Professor Potter, I've been asking around and most of the other professors have a high level of qualifications to teach here. Not everyone gets the job through nepotism.” He said calmly and Draco’s mouth fell open before cackling loudly.
"Hey," Harry said, rushing over as he tried to straighten his dress robes to no prevail, "I'm here. Let class out a bit early," he greeted as he kissed Draco before plucking up a bottle of Sleekeazy. He paused, looked at it, and then immediately handed it to Draco.
“Busted,” Tonks smirked at him, and Draco made a face, turning to look at his aunt with what he hoped was an innocent expression.
“If it means I can finally stop interacting with you…then me too.” Harry sighed and Draco rolled his eyes, giving Montague one last sneer before dragging him away.
“Professor.” He greeted stiffly. Dumbledore smiled and patted one of the empty seats next to him. Draco looked over his shoulder before moving closer to the chair. “What can I do for you?” He asked without sitting down.
“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry mumbled, “He wanted me to bring him back to his parents.” He tried, voice catching, despite the numbness the words held. Dumbledore looked like he might say something else, but Draco wasn’t having it.
“No,” Draco said thoughtfully, “I’m not actually sure what would happen if I gave him orders now,” he mused, mulling over the idea. “Maybe my father sent him to spy on you,” he added.
"If we can time it with when the horcruxes are gone then we can just turn it into a battle," he said and Theo tilted his head, "We summon the reinforcements from all those places you mentioned so that our numbers are stacked and just wait. Assuming all the horcruxes are gone then he'll be mortal." Harry said and Theo leaned back. "I just can't think of a way to ensure he will be there himself-"
doesn't know? Have you seen the book?" Draco asked, banging his head against the table. He was in library (again) with hopes to actually get some work done this time... though that seemed unlikely now given that the revelation had rendered his work completely forgotten as Hermione grimaced at him. When he met her eyes she solemnly shook her head. "For the - it's Severus, Hermione. The whole thing is in his handwriting, I honestly don't know how he hasn't figured it out." He said.
“No.” He said, “Because I don’t believe this is in the Dark Lord’s interest.” He said coldly and raised his wand, turning it on Yaxley. “
“Yeah,” Draco said and took his hand back to re-wrap it as calmly as he could, “I experimented with something of Andromeda’s. Didn’t end well for me.” He lied easily. Harry seemed to buy it as he scoffed, rubbing his own hands in sympathy.
That was a mystery to him too. Maybe Draco knew. He would be sure to ask him later. Taking the wand, he sprinted upstairs, ignoring the others calling for him. The damn house was like a maze. Endless halls for beautifully furnished twists and turns. Third floor, third floor, third floor-
“I wouldn’t let her eat Pig.” Draco told him and Ron put a hand over his chest at the mention of his owl. He turned to stare at Harriet who only hissed in return.
“You’re gay!” He said as if just remembering this fact. Draco raised an eyebrow. “Sorry, I got so stressed about everything and forgot.” He said. Ron snorted.
“I can’t ask you to do that,” he whispered, voice catching. “You’ve worked hard to keep your family safe. I won’t ask you to leave it because I’m scared.” He said and Draco grimaced.
“Just keeping the bones aligned.” He murmured and re-wrapped it. “Okay, I’m going to cast a pain spell, but it just makes it not hurt. It doesn’t heal it so please,
“Yes, I know. I just felt like Daisy suited her.” He said. Draco moved on. He wasn’t going to question Neville’s strange naming process. “I’m using some Pepper-up potion to help with the black spot.” He said with a nod towards the orange potion. Draco nodded.
“That’s…good.” Draco said, trying to decipher that sentence. He looked at Hermione. She only shrugged before flipping a few more pages of her book. Hm. He supposed it wasn’t any of his business. In fact, he needed Ginny to distract him more. It might help with the tension between Harry at Draco... Well, maybe Draco’s night would be getting a bit easier without worrying about walking in on any makeout sessions. At least, that’s what he thought until the doors burst open.
"I really want to be angry at her," she finally said and let her eyes fall to where Ted was cooing over Teddy, "But I also know that there were some close calls for me as well... and then Teddy would have been the one angry with me." She said and shook her head, "I don't know. It'll take some time." She mused and then peered over at Draco, "I heard you and Remus talked."
“I mean, it’s showing,” Draco said slowly, “I keep telling you that if you apply yourself you would actually get pretty decent grades. You nailed potions this morning.” He said. Harry laughed. It was nervous. Draco tilted his head. “Are you hiding something?” He asked, quite bluntly.
“Oh, yeah, I talked to her a bit. All the snakes, really. Wanted to see which one was most likely to deal with you the best. She’s a bit rude like you so…” he trailed off with a shrug. The snake’s head popped up, turning to look at Harry before hissing. “...unnecessary.” He muttered.
“You keep throwing these chess analogies at me. I have one final one for you.” He said and Dumbledore looked at him with slight surprise, “I’m not going with your plan. I’m not playing your games,” he said, taking another step forward, “No more riddles. No more secrets or lies.” He said coldly and nodded at the wand in Dumbledore’s sleeve. “Give it to me.”
