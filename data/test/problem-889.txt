The sun has long descended behind the cliffs when Harry slips into the steaming pool of water out back behind the kitchen garden. He sighs out into the cool night air, feeling the ache in his bones leaching out into the hot water, along with the pressures of the day. He takes a moment to run his hand over the smoothed rock, remembering the weeks it took for him and Charlie to magically carve out the bowl of the pool, then conduct the water to always radiate at an even 38 degrees. He’d only been living on the island for a year but the indulgence felt necessary at the time.
After a lager and a shot of ill-advised tequila, Luna gestures behind her to the still empty pool table.
“No!” Cecilia says, flapping at Draco with limp wrists. “He’s my guest.”
Startled, Harry puts down his mug and walks over to the mirror above the mantel. The wound that felt so inflamed and painful last night now looks like nothing more than a shiny, pale scar. He touches a finger to his skin and hisses at the instant reaction it causes in him. He bites down on a moan, and clamps his hand hard over his neck, looking away from the kitchen and Luna’s inquisitive stare.
She huffs at him, stepping back and folding her arms. They glare at each other for several seconds before Cecilia’s face changes in an instant. She smiles and narrows her eyes at Draco. Harry can practically see the devious thought that has just popped into her head. “I know,” she says, touching one red fingertip to her lips, “perhaps Cameron should go take a few more photos of Harry in his room, hmm?” She turns to Harry, eyebrow raising in what he assumes to be a consent check, since he’s pretty sure she’s now using him as leverage to get a pastry out of Draco’s greedy hands.
The sun sits low in the sky, slicing thick beams of golden light through decaying columns and caryatids, casting the ruins in a molten glow of tangerine light. Hermione snaps image after image on her Muggle camera, cranking the shutter with eager fingers. Luna is resplendent before her, her soft pale skin tinged pink with the setting sun, the white gold of her hair backlit in a flyaway halo around her lovely, awestruck face.
“‘Mione, please don't tell me you chose to come to Venice specifically so that you could dress up in a set of robes from the—
. . .
“How dare you,” he growls, advancing forward, only to be pulled back hard against Draco’s chest.
“It’s not me, it’s Scorpius,” she says, slightly breathless from the heat.
“Of course, Harry.”
“How did you—”
“Yes, Draco has formed one.”
“Cheers!” George clinks his cup with Harry’s. They share a smile and then he points to the phone again. “Seriously, though, who’s the twink with the dark eyes, eh?”
driver heavily and apologizes for his friend in rusty Italian. The man tilts his sunglasses to wink at Harry before revving his engine and whistling as he departs. The notes ricochet off the walls around them, sending the pigeon fleeing in agitation as the chugging of the boat engine provides a bass counterpoint to the soprano of the man’s tune.
“Exploding snap, anyone?” Ron suggests, and soon, the five of them are making as much chaos inside the walls of their rental as the continuing fireworks are making out along the Grand Canal. It’s almost enough commotion for Harry to forget the feel of flushed lips teasing over his skin and the crunch of satin under his fingertips.
“Explain,” Harry barks, the flames in the hearth growing along with his temper. Behind him, Draco steps closer, the inky black hand on Harry’s hip moving to encircle Harry’s shoulder in a fierce grip. Harry turns his head as if listening, and Luna knows a silent conversation is passing between them. This does not go unnoticed by her father, whose eyes widen at the sight.
Teddy, beside him asks, “You gonna tell him?”
. . .
at me earlier.”
Draco looks down at Harry’s flannel dressing gown, the clashing tartan of green and red appearing sickly against his too-pale skin, and then back up at his son, hoping his face doesn’t betray the guilt he feels.
He pulled back with a lewd pop of lips and licked Harry’s jaw. “The Thief’s Curse is meant to bond the plunderer with the painting they attempt to steal.” Malfoy spoke as if he wasn’t preoccupied with undoing the buttons on Harry’s trousers. Harry moved to halt his progress, boggled by this new knowledge.
“You’re beautiful,” Draco says, and then, inexplicably he starts to cry.
’ literally translates to want, longing,
“Yup.” Harry rocks on his heels, pleased with Draco’s reaction. Cameron had told Harry about the little spot a while ago during one of his many rambling one-sided conversations that flitted through a variety of topics, including (inexplicably) Draco’s favourite
Harry’s smiling. That’s the only part of his body he’s aware of; his idiotic, sluggish smile as soft wings wrap around him, and a warming charm passes over him, drying his damp skin.
He pops the mint into his mouth, rubbing his tongue against it hard, hoping its flavour will soothe his nausea.
Malfoy’s breaths were coming fast again and it struck Harry to notice that he’d not met his eyes once during their exchange. Instead, they were darting about the room, landing everywhere except on Harry. What with his disheveled hair and manic behavior, Malfoy almost seemed feral. His magic was sparking, flashes of purple and gold rippling off the chair rail behind him, circling round to Harry, tickling at his skin. Harry stood, shaking off the feeling. Malfoy took in a sharp breath.
“I will end him,” Draco says, closing his eyes in frustration, his fingernails digging into the jagged rocks behind them.
Luna crouches close to them and coos at Draco, a soft gentle trill of a sound that Hermione has never heard her make before.
“No, I’m fine.” Luna waves away the look of annoyance on Hermione’s face, hands Draco a cup of tea, and sinks onto the loveseat.
“The Sanctuary is a Thestral enclave, Draco. A collection of wild, stray, retired and locally bred beasts make up the herd.”
Draco feels his cock twitch with interest, his lust rekindling as Harry loses himself. He’s pumping savagely into Draco’s mouth, one hand twisted painfully into Draco’s hair, and it’s so fucking delicious, Draco can barely concentrate. He moves his right hand, pressing his thumb between the crease of Harry’s arse to find his hole and pushes into it, dry.
Harry’s arms are crossed, his face stern. “They did.” A branch snaps in the distance.
The bored wizard heaves a put-upon sigh, having no response for Harry’s bizarre behaviour other than to stamp his papers and hand over a rubber banana with a bemused expression on his gaunt face. He points to the clock behind him. “
“Thank you, Hermione,” he whispers, buried in the dark brown curls of her hair.
Draco’s wings are held wide, despite Hermione and Luna having freed themselves from under them, and his body is tense as a spring about to snap over Harry. Hermione looks down at him, brows furrowing with worry. Harry shrugs back at her, seemingly at a loss. He brings an arm up to stroke at one of Draco’s wings, but all that does is cause his feathers to spike and his shoulders to hitch higher, his arms wrapping tighter about Harry.
. . .
“Well, getting to spend another day at the beach didn’t sound so bad.”
“Sorry,” he grunts, not feeling apologetic in the least at his unchecked display. “We have to get him out of here.”
“It’s my fault. I should—” Harry stands, not knowing exactly what his next move will be, but he knows that the atmosphere in the room is suddenly missing a key component. The decadence around him feels oppressive as opposed to eclectic, the greenery claustrophobic as opposed to welcoming. He turns on the spot, looking for his shoes, not knowing what to do once he finds them under a side table. There’s a firefly fluttering its wings on the toe of one shoe and he takes special care as he slips it on his foot, not wanting to disturb the tiny, glowing thing. Its presence feels precious to Harry.
!”** Cecilia shoots back with a wicked smirk. Harry watches as Draco’s eyes flash and his cheeks flush red. Harry presses his lips together, ready for anything as the two friends square off in front of him. Perhaps they’ll throw hexes next? The anticipation is almost enough to distract Harry from his still very hard cock and its utter disappointment in being denied head. He adjusts himself with a grimace.
Cameron halts his acrobatics with the cocktail shaker and stares at the two of them, perplexed. “Dee?” he asks, tilting his head to the side like an inquisitive crup.
The announcement for Verona rings out through the carriage and Harry looks up, seeing them pulling into the station. He leaps from his seat, backpack and photo book in hand and flings himself onto the platform as soon as the train comes to a stop.
Harry smiles at the fondness in Draco’s voice. The sneering curled lip of their school days is long gone from his tone.
She stands from her stool, stepping between his legs to rub at his shoulders, to get his blood flowing once more. She ducks her head, seeks out his gaze, and smiles at him, encouraging and earnest.
“So much pain,” he hears himself say, only to see Draco flinch in response.
“I did, Harry.” Hermione says, face set.
“No, the rocks. The sea. You and Harry. It’s perfect.”
Harry’s entire body tenses. The tentative calm that had settled over them shatters in an instant.
With begrudging and glacial acceptance of the inevitable, Draco descends the stairs with Cee and Cameron in turn, and strolls out to his doom, head held high.
Harry feels a gentle touch on his arm and looks down at her delicate hand. He sees the emerald ring on her fourth finger glint in the light, and remembers Ron picking out that ring, remembers watching him place it on Hermione’s finger from his place beside them at their wedding. Knowing that even after all this time, all the nights of tears and too much whiskey passed between them, that Hermione still considers Draco to be a part of
The bittersweet scent of Campari is hot on Potter’s breath as he moves, holding himself at bay mere inches from Draco’s mouth. “You think I’m acting?” Potter asks, his tone playful yet deadly.
“Who thought,” he begins, barely containing himself, “that this . . .
The water consumes him, flooding into his nostrils and his ears like ice-cold knives digging into his skin. His fingers close over one bony leg and he pulls, determined. He breaks above the waves, one hand on his broom, the other now clutched around the neck of the poor foal, draping her legs over the front of the broom handle. Another wave crashes, sends them careening towards the jagged rocks of the cliff, Draco feels the slice of one through his shin, cries out in pain. He’s holding his wand in his broom hand, forces magic to will the broom higher, out of the water, out of the waves. The ancient magic of the island does funny things to his own power though and he can feel it waning, feel the sense of levitation losing out to the gravity of the heaving water below.
“What?” Neville asks, his head leaned back against the wall.
. . .
“Men, Potter. I prefer
She listens but no voice comes as she clutches the napkin in her lap, in desperate need of one of Xenophilius’ calming draughts. When she looks up, Draco has retreated. He stands by Harry’s chair across the room, one soot-black hand clasped possessively on Harry’s shoulder. Harry looks up at her son with an awed expression and reverence in his eyes. She opens her mouth to comment but a pop sounds beside her and suddenly, there’s an elf jumping up and down, poking at her skirts.
“Remember what?” Charlie says, voice soft, pained.
He doesn’t stop running.
“What aren’t you telling me, Theodore?”
Silver eyes, so worn and weary, turn fierce as Draco nods and Luna’s heart sinks down through the rocks at their feet.
“I love you,” Draco breathes into Gabrielle’s skin.
Harry’s eyes stutter open at the dull thud of a door closing. He looks around, feeling unmoored and uneasy, suffocating under the weight of the blankets. He’s up in an instant, reaching for the door.
He takes a tentative step, halts, then paws at the dirt. Harry’s curious, his head tilted to the side as he assimilates. The world is wide and loud around him, his eyesight too keen, too sharp. He blinks and takes another step, two, twenty. Before he knows it, he’s running, galloping down the slope of the rock, away from the cottage, the paddocks, the gardens and outhouses, and the memories he’s tried so hard to bury all these years. They fall away as his mind tunnels to focus on only what’s in front of him, only his next jolt forward, testing out this new creature he’s become.
Forcing himself back to the present, Harry moves, pushing forward off the wet stone, hands twisting into the back of Draco’s hair to guide his head down where Harry wants it, needs it most. Draco’s hands come up to frame Harry’s face, halting his lips from meeting his own in the single breath left to take between decision and action.
Just as they level out above the clouds Harry grins, a thought springing to mind. He grabs Draco’s arm and pulls. Draco squeaks, which only makes Harry smile more.
He grunts as Draco arches halfway off the bed, his body twisting in a grotesque manner. Harry settles him then looks to Hermione with pleading in his eyes. “Look. You’re a Healer, I’m a Herbologist. We can handle it.”
’ me, you deceptive little snake.”
“Plans, Potter?” Draco quips. Harry turns back to see that Draco has also allowed the music to sweep him off into his own musings. He’s lounged on his elbows on the bed, throat exposed as he lets his head roll back on his shoulders, one slim ankle twisting in time with the tune. Harry wants to clarify, to ask Draco what prior arrangements are so important they’ll keep Harry from coming back here to spend more time in this room with its greenery and sunlight and Muggle music and the most captivating man Harry has ever dared to want, but his voice sticks in his throat, the sight of Draco rendering him speechless.
Harry halts. “Do you want me to?”
Standing, Harry holds out his hand to Draco. “‘Course. Anything you want.”
Harry licks his lips, his brain sluggish from sleep. “Hmmm?”
Harry plucks one from the air, remembering how the soft down felt against the bare skin of his arms. “Fucking hell, Hermione.”
He turns and leaps off the balcony, his wings taking him higher and higher into the howling winds of the fast-approaching storm. He hears Harry calling out his name from below but he ignores him and pushes south, away from the electrical bolts touching down along the water and igniting the land beneath him. He chases the clear sky ahead of him, his mind going numb to the memory of his pain, even if his body shakes with the aftershocks of his self-inflicted trauma.
warning.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry mumbles, turning his head away. Draco pushes it back in his direction with a single knuckle under his chin.
The only response her polite inquiry receives is a grunt. Harry kicks another rock.
Studying the black and golden lines of the twins, Draco sees that Harry is right; they’re long-haired and naked, defined in the way all ancient Roman statues are carved to ideal perfection, yet the twisting composition of their bodies betrays no true distinction of gender, as if they were rendered onto Harry’s skin free from such preconceptions. Draco puts a gentle finger to the lovely face of one of the twins and their eyes close at his touch, not unlike the way one of Draco’s plants would react to such affection. His breath catches at the sight. Harry’s hand tightens on Draco’s nape and he looks up, seeing Harry’s green eyes darken.
“I still have questions for you, Mr Lovegood,” she calls back down the stairs. Their conversation is most certainly not over.
He’s halfway across the field when another numbing charm curls around his bloodied leg, Harry’s magic seeping into his bones like a salve. Draco halts, closes his eyes at the intoxicating sensation then curses.
A soft blush blooms across Draco’s skin—he's smiling, soft and small and secret, hiding such sweetness behind the fall of his hair. It sends a thrill through Harry, seeing that reaction, and he shifts where he lays, wanting to be closer to that smile on instinct. Draco seems to know Harry wants his attention and turns back to watch him. Time slows, and Harry breathes deeply as the seconds melt into minutes, willing his erratic heartbeat to calm.
Draco’s face became outwardly disgusted. He didn’t like the sound of that.
He almost snorted again. He had been doing that a decent amount lately, and he should probably cease to limit the attention he was receiving, albeit that was difficult considering his status.
Plus, traveling between Houses gave him cover to collect more intel and honestly more of Potter’s soon-to-be friends if Draco was being honest. It would give Potter some friendships and connections to think about, which he would no doubt preserve until his last breath.
much more some day - while Draco would not. If he was lucky, the Malfoy name would still hold some merit to it and Draco’s own name would be at least tolerated in the Wizarding community.
A Side Note: A commenter helped me realize that the eye colors could be misleading. I apologize for that. I meant for no confusion. Anyway, their eyes do not reflect the book's because I am not as familiar with them as the movies. Therefore the looks of the characters are based more on the actors'/actresses' appearances. Draco is still in his past, not in an alternate universe type thing.
, that rang in Draco’s head.
Draco released a sigh at his thoughts, deciding to take notice of the class instructions instead. He followed the other students’ example as they went to stand by their brooms.
Technically he wasn’t a Slytherin because the stupid Hat, but that was where he naturally migrated to, although he received interesting news the day after the Sorting Hat called “Indeterminable House”.
The corner of his mouth quirked ever so slightly, and a bubbling in his throat rose and almost surfaced, but was tamped down at the last second. Draco couldn’t laugh in the Great Hall at suspectedly nothing since that would draw too much (well more) attention to him.
He had to halt in his walking, holding against the wall in a desperate attempt at blending in just in case a prefect appeared and witnessed the scene he was causing.
There were other chances to connect though, Draco was certain.
Harry’s eyes widened a faction then scrunched down along with the rest of his face. “Malfoy? You cannot be serious.” He may have spoken at the trial for a few people, Malfoy included, but that did not mean he encouraged anything. He and Malfoy still hated one another, as would always be the case.
He promptly did so, heading back into his mental list that he was compiling. He couldn’t dare let his knowledge get into the wrong hands,
He was in the past. He wasn’t in his
events, just to accomplish his mission, but the thought caused his mostly empty stomach to heave. Alongside that thought came another round of anxiety at what would happen if they all found out his
Well, Potter may have deserved it in ways, but not necessarily at this age.
He limited his interactions with the two, yet they still seemed offended. Draco truly could not figure it out. It exasperated him to know that he was failing. He blamed them. They must lack proper human interaction or the decency to understand Draco wasn’t as bad as he used to.
“Good.” His superior adjusted his tie, strolling back to the other side of his desk. “Auror Malfoy is exceptional, after all. His mission ratio is quite the same as yours, without as much destruction and chaos, which you are prone to leave behind.”
Another second passed and a thought occurred to Draco. He suddenly worried whether or not he threw it the way he did last time. He almost began to overanalyze his throw when finally -
He was waiting for it, and to properly see the defeat would make it all worth it. An unwanted thought briefly surfaced, which he promptly shoved away and ignored. He caught the slight silver of doubt if Potter’s victory had been a mere fluke last time, but he refused to let that thought take hold. He refused to allow that to come to fruition anyway.
“Oh tosh, Potter,” The man scoffed. “We are not firing you.” He let out a long sigh, adding a “this time” to the end of his sentence. “However,” he said, destroying the little blooming hope in Harry’s chest because that didn’t feel right. “We are assigning you a partner to keep you in check.”
other
Potter and his group did it before, and they will accomplish exactly that again. There was no other choice, no other outcome.
Potter is a sentimental person that thrives off of friendships, but is also easily damaged by them; therefore, Potter would protect them all as if they knew each other all their lives. This would assist Draco in the future when the time came to help save someone.
His first year would consist of figuring out which House appealed to him and fit his personality most, and then he would announce his chosen House later on, at least he had been told he would. He was therefore instructed to travel House to House in order to figure out his best fit and to figure out how they all worked beyond the simple explanation they all received from Professor McGonagall their first day.
Draco managed to pull himself from his thoughts by something lightly rolling into his shoe. Obviously it was the Remembrall. His blue eyes didn’t leave it for about three seconds as Madam Hooch led Longbottom away to (presumably) the hospital wing.
he coached himself, like a mantra - like he could simply order his frantic thoughts to be silent - like he wasn’t
. If this had happened when he was younger, he would have been ecstatic and his ego would have shot through the roof even more so than before, but that was before everything, before the Dark Lord and way before seventh year.
His father was bound to discover that Draco was classified as Indeterminable and contact him at once. It was not a speech Draco was looking forward to when he returned to the Manor.
No matter how many times he told himself to keep calm and focus on his objective, he still felt as if he was being pulled underwater. He struggled, and then he tried to breathe. Usually it helped, but sometimes he wondered if it was his last time at successfully bottling his emotions.
It was yet another shock from being brought to the past, and like most others, he was unsure how he felt about it. He had so much at his fingertips honestly, so much he could do and he could have, but that paled in comparison to what he needed. He felt everything was so insignificant in the wake of War, extremely different than his first time around when he got upset for not getting what he wanted and wanting everything in sight.
“No, be quiet. You don’t get to speak after that fiasco!” He stomped over to where Harry was sitting. “This was the last straw…”
That was the trio’s mission. Draco had his own.
doesn’t belong to you.” The Gryffindor stated, unblinkingly staring at Draco, eye contact only broken once when he gestured to the toy. He stepped closer.
His heart thudded a few times in his excitement. He couldn’t help the smile that rose to his face. It has been over two years since he even held a broom, much less rode one. He was strangely elated, despite his stomach's objections. He knew what he had to do, but he still found the prospect of simply getting to fly so much more pressing than the reason as to
Draco could have his father buy that now if he wished. The Remembrall didn’t matter in the slightest. It was a simple insignificant toy.
Potter was a twat, and he effectively ruined Draco’s returning good mood, and no one had to know it was because the boy had the audacity to never back down.
Unfortunately, he couldn’t avoid them forever. He promised himself to stop being a coward and to do right, and that’s what he was going to do. Plus, they were the main people in the war. They were the heroes that destroyed Voldemort once and for all. Draco was bound to cross paths with them more than once in the upcoming future.
He schooled his face as Weasley and Potter bickered. It was brief, but friendly. It sounded so easy and light-hearted that Draco’s own heart clenched at his own version of “bickering” with Potter, which was more or less insulting taunts than anything.
Potions existed, a wide range of them could suit his needs, as could clabbering Potter upside the head until only sense remained or telling Potter - no, Draco immediately made that thought crash and burn. He couldn’t dare tell Potter about the future. That would only end in disaster, as would everything else he had thought of.
If Draco fell from this height, he would probably break a bone or two, but it wasn’t a big deal if it happened. Draco had experienced worse with Hagrid’s bloody chicken, some Death Eaters -- his Aunt too, of course… among others. He really had a messed up history now that he thought about it.
He truly didn’t know who he could trust with his secret. He didn’t know who he could burden with his knowledge without sounding crazy or pathetic either.
It was an interesting idea, and although Draco favored Slytherin and knew that defying his father on being a Slytherin would not be beneficial, Draco was somewhat excited to get a glimpse into every House’s workings. He would always return to Slytherin, he was sure, but that didn’t mean he had to right away.
Draco Malfoy was a stuck up prat with his head so far up his arse that all he spit out was regurgitated shite from his parents.
In his current state, however, Draco hated the feeling of eyes on him, judging him, watching his every move.
Speaking of them though, as Draco walked into the Great Hall, his friends at his sides, he noticed the group already at the Gryffindor table. It was still odd to see everyone so young, especially Potter and his friends. He caught himself almost staring, going to pull his eyes away when Potter’s blue ones drifted from his friends to locate Draco.
He remembered the fear, the darkness surrounding him and the weight of the lantern in his hand. He recalled running away and leaving Potter alone to face Voldemort, which he learned later was the figure drinking the unicorn’s blood. He didn’t know that at the time, but either way, Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust at the memory.
is my partner?”
The sobs that followed were even more so, a sort of choking, breathy wet cry that wasn’t swallowed by Draco or the darkness consuming him, no matter how hard either tried.
The older man’s glare returned. “Is there a problem? Because if this is, you can walk straight out that door.”
Also, going from House to House would help Draco be less of an “arse”; allow him to read without people narrowing their eyes; and to get on Potter’s (and his posse’) somewhat good graces, at least enough for them to trust him when the time came.
some day - he would
A snarky reply was on the tip of his tongue.
Draco was feeling a bit better about himself and the circumstances, unfortunately that did not last.
Draco could have laughed at the predictability, but instead his lips quirked into another smirk. “What a promise, Potter, but the question is: can your ‘skill’ back up that statement?” He leaned back some on his broom, knowing exactly how far back he could do without plummeting.
Draco shook his head, returning to the present. “No need to hurt yourself with all that thinking, Potter.” He really shouldn’t be talking, now should he? Ignoring his brain, he tossed the Remembrall once in the air, then caught it. He maneuvered his broom so he could properly throw the Remembrall, glancing over his shoulder as he did. “I’ll make it easy for you: go fetch, Scarhead.” He promptly threw the Remembrall, watching as Potter hesitated briefly at his words then shot through the sky after it.
Draco could only hope and only attempt not to foil his own plans because they were just plans after all. They weren’t the absolute future, and to be completely honest, when Draco thought about Potter, he still had a sour taste in his mouth. It was probably some of that old rivalry coming back, even though it’s only been about three days since he was thrown into the past.
Potter looked ready to attempt a shove, only pausing to debate internally.
The mere thought was astonishing, and Draco Malfoy could hardly believe it. Some part of him denied it, thinking that he would fall asleep one night only to wake up the next day to destruction and chaos.
They were his
Draco couldn’t help but feel that he was projecting terms associated with himself, but he would never admit it to anyone, much less Potter.
. Draco was certain the
For one, not getting as heated when he saw Potter’s face was a bit of an issue after their previous interaction. The glaring contest earlier stuck to them both like Muggle glue. It wasn’t for lack of Draco trying, but when Potter glanced his way in the hall, the obvious distrust and dislike was palpable.
Beyond measure, Draco Malfoy was actually terrified.
Then the door opened, and a familiar dry voice greeted them with a repulsed tone:
Crabbe and Goyle had perked up at spying a familiar young Gryffindor, who had the ginger Weasel by his side. Granger was not currently with them, but that was not always the case if Draco recalled. At first, Granger and those two weren’t attached to each others’ hips or whatever Granger and Weasley ended up attaching to one another later on. That train of thought was quickly pushed away, heading back to the overall relationship of the three, a safer destination in all honesty.
To make matters worse, his superior smirked, anger no longer as prominent. “And we know just the Auror. I presume you have heard of Draco Malfoy? Former Death Eater, went to Hogwarts, in your year, ring a bell?”
Scoffing, Harry breathes out a sigh of relief. She hadn’t been reading him, just assessing the public figure before her and finding him acceptable. Harry can handle that, in fact, he’s flattered at winning her favour. He flashes her a grin.
“You ever going to fix this place up, Potter?”
“That too,” Harry adds.
“Has it ever been?”
“Should I?” Charlie has stepped into the barn now, his arms no longer jovially crossed over his chest; instead, his hands are shoved into his pockets, his shoulders tense. Harry can see the concern rippling off the man and wishes there was something he could say to deter him from this line of questioning, but he knows it’s futile. Charlie and Harry have been each other’s keepers for too long, have been too protective of the other, too close to blood brothers to ever really let things lie. “I know how you can get–”
“Which part?” Harry’s head is hung low as he sucks down a cigarette. He’d gone to the shops in search of Draco’s brand and had bought an entire carton.
“Cee,” he hisses, hoping she isn’t asleep on her towel in the sand.
“Apparently not.”
She pouts, abandoning the pastries. Patting him on the cheek, she soothes him, cooing softly in Italian. Draco’s shoulders visibly shift under his robe, posture slipping as he sighs at her lyrical speech. Cecilia steps closer still, plucking a pin from Draco’s hair and running her hands through it, working out the tangles. Harry watches as Draco wilts into her touch like a drop of melted cream descending from the rim of a gelato cone, cascading languid and sticky over Harry’s fingertips. Draco is so pliant, so accepting of affection that Harry balls his hands into fists, at once both envious and confused that he isn’t the one standing in Cecilia’s place. He’d come here to deliver pastries and hopefully make amends for his poor behaviour on the beach, and now here he is in Draco's bedroom, feeling jealous over Cecilia's abilities to render Draco speechless with a single touch.
Draco shifts his eyes over Harry’s shoulder, then steps back, gesturing to the room at large. “Let us continue the celebrations of this delightful new venture of yours back at mine, hm?”
“Can we leave him behind?”
“Sarcasm. Have you heard of it?”
Charlie snorts. Teddy grins wider. “Um, well, Aunt ‘Mione read in a book about . . . certain practices to alter ancient magic. . ." he breaks off in a giggle and Draco sighs, exasperated.
, along with a quick detour to procure a
Shaking his head, Harry swallows, hips canting in a sinuous roll. “No, inside me. The magic ripples through me when the markings change.”
The man’s speaking again, right in Harry’s ear with a hand fisted in his hair, just the way Harry likes to be handled. He whimpers, feeling unmoored as the man tells him a series of impossible things Harry is no less eager to hear. “Since we were children I've wanted you, your attention, your acceptance, your
. . .
“Yes, you do.”
Hermione gasps, her teacup clanging hard against its saucer. “No!”
“Your mother,” Harry blurts, his eyes going wide.
“I want to run with my herd, Hermione,” he says, stating the wish he’s harboured ever since he’d discovered the Thestral foals eating squash from his back garden, and inevitably, started caring for them. Seeing their numbers grow, enough to create The Sanctuary in the first place, only solidified this yearning. It’s been four years. He wants to evolve with them.
Draco, as ever, nods and continues to ignore Harry’s request except when it suits him to do otherwise.
Grey eyes darkening, Draco’s hand slips down further, pushing underneath the collar of Harry’s t-shirt as if to feel as much of Harry’s skin as possible. Harry contemplates simply vanishing his shirt from existence if it means Draco would put his hands on his skin, but before Harry can do anything so brazen Draco is sinking to his knees, eyes trained on Harry’s as he silently kneels before him, fingers trailing in his wake, coming to rest over the button of his faded jeans. He nuzzles into the flat of Harry’s abdomen, pressing his nose and lips against the blatant hardness he finds just below. Harry hears him inhale and then feels Draco’s fingers deftly release his top button, then the next, and the next . . .
Wanting very much to hex something but not wanting to act like the upper-class prat that he very much looks like in a room full of strangers, Draco decides instead that the proper way to deal with his frustration is by drinking. He pulls out the stool, slides primly onto it with the air of a man who simply won’t put up with another disappointment for at least twenty minutes, and asks for a double of the twelve-year behind the bar.
He wheezed out a laugh. “Not. Feeling. Too great,” he said, his voice breaking on the last word. Harry wondering when all the air had left his lungs. In front of him, the Draco statue moved with surprising dexterity; flapping about like a bird with a broken wing, frantic and frazzled. His chiseled white hair had come loose from the onyx ribbon he’d tied it back with, strands falling into his eyes before he’d shove them back with carrara fingers, mussing it further. Harry watched him as his vision blurred, his eyesight closing in on him, as if the round wall of the room was contracting inward.
“Yeah, exercising the foals. Gets ‘em strong, ready to fly. They’ve been taking first-flights all this past week off the cliffs.” Charlie explains, cordial and smiling.
Harry grins at her. “None of us deserve you.”
“He’s not coming back.”
, just outside Draco’s home.
Pol is there, her gangly legs more sturdy now that she’s had more time to grow into them. The week of being pampered and shown affection by Draco, Rose and Huge in turn has done wonders for the young creature’s growth. Draco walks to her, holding out his hand, letting him smell his presence on the edge of the herd. She butts his palm with the bridge of her nose, snorting out a hello to him.
“Rude,” she scoffs, but then sobers. “You think, though?” she asks, her body a sudden live-wire, reassessing everything she’s ever known about Harry and Draco post-war.
Draco turns on his heel. He’s going back to bed.
“What are you doing?” Draco asks, voice warm in the close space between them.
What the hell were Scorpius and Granger thinking!
“Well, I’ve not much entertainment available to me just now. Your animalistic stalking of the perimeter is it, I’m afraid. So, the choices are either you stop your incessant pacing or you bear my continued glowering. Take your pick.”
“She didn’t do this out of malice, Harry,” Luna says.
The scrape of Malfoy’s chair on the terracotta tiles fills the kitchen as he stands. “I was being sarcastic.”
Large, warm hands engulf her face and pull her attention back to her father as a prickle of fresh tears escape her eyes. They run down her cheeks, blazing a trail over her skin. Xenophilius leans in close and stares at Luna with endless kindness and remorse in his deep blue gaze.
“Teddy was just explaining to Draco here how you added your own . . . um, special . . .
“Everything,” Harry whispers, mere inches from Charlie’s face.
Hermione shakes her head. “Nope. Thestrals.”
“Draco. Stay. Eat something.” His eyes are sincere and concerned. Such a typical Weasley, wanting to feed everyone. Yet, Draco can’t look away, and can’t for the life of him, turn Bill down. He nods, pulling his shoulders into a straight line. Hoping that after dinner, he and Fleur will have more time to discuss the nature of love bonds. As he sits at the small dining table surrounded by the soft golden light emanating from the scallop shell candles floating just out of reach he hears his mother’s voice echo in his head, pushing itself into the warmth and calm of this domestic space, unbidden.
“Then step back.”
“Oh,” Draco says, blinking at the broom. “Is this a reward for my good behaviour?”
Harry looks down at the Draco constellation still curling over his wrist and palm with its long black tail flecked with gold. “Thank you,” he tells her, his throat feeling raw once more. She skips away, rejoining her mother, and Harry watches her go, uneasy where he stands. He takes a seat in a nearby pew, slouches, and looks up at the coffered ceiling, letting his head fall back over the wooden lip of the bench, wondering how his carefree holiday with his two best friends in Italy has somehow turned into a wallowing pity fest, party of one, inside the cavernous halls of an ancient church.
“Your point?”
Harry moves to kneel between Draco’s knees, his hands coming to frame Draco’s pale, beautiful face.
. . .
“You’re here.”
Harry thinks, then Draco hears him curse at his own internal bravado. Draco grins into his throat, wanting to nip at his skin, work at the bite mark he placed on Harry’s neck like a brand, just to bring Harry to his knees in front of them all, but he holds back. He’ll show Xenophilius tame.
Scorpius is nodding. “Have done, for days now.”
"You're such a clothing snob."
Portkey
“There,” Draco points, the cool tip of his finger pressing gently against Harry’s skin.
“Stop!”
“Fuck,” he says, scrubbing his face with his wet hands. “I’m sorry.”
Luna squeezes the rubber duckie. It honks in a forlorn sort of way, and Luna doesn’t blame him. She lets it go, watches it float through the bubbles.
Draco lifts his head. He’d been concentrating on the grain in the tabletop. “He did?”
Draco nods, head bowing low, tucking his chin. Narcissa slips into the open space between Draco’s curled wings to hold him close. They were not always such a tactile family, but Narcissa’s need to feel her son, solid and whole, outweighs the stilted strictness archaic pureblood parenting dictates. She can feel his hesitation, the hovering of his hands just above her back, but then, warmth surrounds her as he gives in and embraces her. They stand together as one. It’s as if a part of her soul—once ripped so completely from her—has been returned. It’s only once she pulls away to see the wetness on her son’s cheeks, does Narcissa realise that the warmth she felt against her hair was from Draco’s tears.
“Thankfully, no.”
“Knew you could do it, mate!” Charlie shouts again, and if Harry could call back to him at that moment, he would with an unbridled joy he hasn’t felt in years.
”—she pulled out a handkerchief from her pocket—“is the price I’m willing to pay.”
Harry paused as Malfoy stormed into the hallway, his earlier decisiveness deserting him. Now that he was face to face with Malfoy, his reasons for coming seemed ridiculous.
“A mental hospital? Really?” Pansy crossed her arms, looking very unimpressed by his temper tantrum. “That seems a bit hypocritical coming from the man who used to be so obsessed with him it went far beyond what muggles call stalking.”
Your muscles had a mind of their own
“Yeah, sounds like a plan. I know the kids better than anyone anyway.” And it was true—he'd already seen a few things on the shop fronts of Diagon Alley that had reminded him of the kids. “If you see him, tell Theo to not forget to buy gluten-free Christmas food for Meg, okay?”
“Yes, please, and tea.”
“Male!” The twins crowed when Harry’s face started to itch and apparently grew an impressive moustache. Another second later and he had his mouth back, just in time to give Fred and George a piece of his mind.
Nursing a coffee, he looked over the newspaper on the table in front of him. Merlin, Christmas was merely days away. He idly wondered how things were going for Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins with the safehouse.
Zabini made to leave, and Harry, panicking a bit, babbled, “W-wait. Aren’t you going to ask me what I’m doing here?” He'd really hoped this would be a short visit. Come, give them the postcard, leave. Easy peasy.
“Technically, he wouldn’t be allowed to advertise it if he sold his body,” Astoria cut in. “His nipples are female presenting, after all.”
So how was I supposed to understand
“Is everything alright?” He asked, his tone softening, remembering what Theo had told him earlier. This must be Joan. Joan shook her head, her eyes glanced around the room before giving Draco a once over. “Can I get you anything?” She shook her head again.
“I was a victim of abuse.”
Morphed into what instinct did
“Because selling your engagement ring means ending your bloodline for good, yeah we know. But that’s not the reason you don’t want to sell it to Potter.” Pansy had clearly recovered and was now studying his face. “You don’t want to sell it to him because you can’t bear to see it in his hands without you giving it to him. You don’t want him to have it when it doesn’t come with an engagement to you.”
Perhaps he could buy Malfoy’s ring in disguise, and return it to him. That should work, right?
“Only if you promise to attend Christmas Dinner at the Burrow with me.”
Their bond may have been what protected them from burning.
“What is?” Harry asked.
Which had led to the hilarious yet depressing result that Draco’s in-drag photoshoot from a Witch Weekly edition published last year was now banned.
“Getting your attention.”
“Doubtful.” Begrudgingly, Draco gets up and follows his mad flatmate, because sunning himself next to the golden boy of the Wizarding World without the guise of a photoshoot to keep him there is not something he ever pictured himself doing. At least, not willingly.
“A fire?” Harry repeated. Feeling slow and inappropriately turned-on considering the danger he felt under Malfoy’s fingertips.
He attempts to walk towards Draco, arms outstretched as if he were coming to embrace him, but Draco hisses, causing Xenophilius to falter in his steps. His arms fall to his side, a kicked puppy without a bone.
“You’re hurt.”
Harry takes in the beauty of him, standing there, barefoot and draped in silk, surrounded by greenery as the morning sun glows warm and low across the floorboards, reaching out its tendrils of late-summer heat into the room. Draco’s silver-blond hair is illuminated with a verdant gleam. He looks like a wild thing, composed yet utterly free at the centre of it all; a native prince embraced by a jungle of his own creation.
Luna beams with pride. “It’s a perfect specimen.”
“So greedy,” he says, his hands moving to rest on Draco’s slight hips, fingers digging into perfectly pale skin.
“We have to find the elf,” Luna says, her eyes filling with tears.
, and its many forms, has no earthly boundary, and therefore it is impossible to contain with words or with walls.” The priest looks up, his smile returning, eyes twinkling at Harry as if he’s in on the secret. “
Luna halts his miserable attempts to explain. “I know.” She pulls out a stool beside him and nods to the bartender for another round. There are several empty pints lined up in front of Harry already, but they both know tonight is a night for drinking.
“He bit me,” Harry rasps, realising his voice has gone hoarse.
He wanted to knock some sense into them, but that would force him back yet again in his pursuit of tolerating the group and them, in turn, tolerating him. He just couldn’t win, that was what he deduced.
And that was his cue. Draco forced his smirk to be natural when he turned to Potter. “And why would I give it to you, Potter?”
If Draco was in a better mood, he would have laughed at dubbing Potter that. To be honest, though, it was true, and Draco kept momentarily forgetting that. Potter may be younger and not at all experienced in Magic, yet he represented something far greater than anyone knew.
“Wait,
If he had his way, he would allow Potter to have it. However, Draco was not sure if that was possible. He could give the Remembrall back or he could do exactly what he did last time, toss it far away. He wanted to release the toy, and since his mind was running off the thoughts of want versus necessity, he was so tempted to forgo the next
Draco should remember that, and not be so bloody quick to anger.
. . . .
“His record seems promising, and we are hoping his way of completing cases will implore you both to improve. That is why we are assigning you two together. Plus-”
.” Draco emphasized the last name harshly. “Last time I checked, it doesn’t belong to you either.” He mounted his broom in a fluid motion, making a circle around the group that gathered and purposely bumping the irritating soon-to-be Gryffindor Seeker in his shoulder before Draco rose up into the air. Staying immobile in the air above them, he said aloud. “If you want it so bad, though, come up here and get it yourself.”
After a slight shake of hair, a mount of the first year broom, a brief interaction with Granger and a gentle kick off, Potter was up in the air, headed straight for him. He pulled up in front of Draco, sloppily but better than any other first year could ever accomplish. “Give it here, Malfoy, or I’ll knock you off your broom,” Potter demanded.
Harry couldn’t help but hold his breath. This is the first time that he had a sinking feeling after becoming an Auror, where his thoughts led to him potentially losing his job. Of course they bloody yelled about how he dealt with cases, but they got done, and he was bloody good at it. And being the Chosen One helped him, he was sure. “Sir?” He prompted the older gentlemen, reigning in his own temper and looking at it objectively. He could very well lose his job, the one thing he loved to do, despite the backlash he received. “Do you mean..?”
He nearly flinched at the implications if he were to fail. He shook his head to clear it since it wasn’t an option. He had to succeed in some way. If he couldn’t form some sort of connection, he’d have to go to the opposite side of the spectrum: annoy, humiliate and force them to do what he wished. He very well could, but he didn’t quite want to.
Potter was a little twat of course, but Draco probably gave him multiple reasons to hate and be wary of his actions: randomly smirking, trying to hex him with his eyes, making fun of the Weasel, the usual.
finally (Draco could have grown old already in the time it took) - Potter caught the toy.
- the self-righteous prat.
“Give it here, Malfoy,” Potter’s voice sounded from behind him. The boy’s voice was icy and demanding, just like he remembered.
Harry Potter shoved his glasses up onto his face as his superior’s face turned nearly an ugly blue. “Auror Potter,” the other finally wheezed out, spitting. “How many times do I need to tell you to follow the rules?”
When he awoke the next morning, he knew he managed to possibly get in a few hours. It wasn’t much but at least he finally calmed down enough to make his way back into his individual room in the Slytherin dormitory after a while.
. . . . .
Every time he attempted to be civil or connect, the old urge to tease came out, which Potter and Weasley utterly despised. It kept setting him further back. It wasn’t his fault that they didn’t understand Draco’s bickering from his bullying, and it wasn’t his fault that it lightened his spirits to bother the two.
He rested his chin in his hand again, his other hand laying on the table in a fist, snuggly at his elbow. He bit his lip, hiding his frown behind the action. He honestly hoped his moods would settle at some point since he was currently safe and he didn’t have anyone breathing down his neck and whispering things in his ears, as long as no one counted his father that is.
Even the broom knew the Weasel needed a good whack to the face. He could only agree and applaud that something did what it wanted.
The news of being indeterminable was still fresh and new to them all. They were curious, and they were interested in
The latter question worried him most.
At last, he glanced up from the connection between his hand and the broom, idiotically seeking out Potter and Weasley among the group.
He was the worst mindless follower he could think of.
It had already been a few days, but he still remained in this strange situation. Even if he managed to briefly fall asleep, which he only did the second night for a few hours, his reality didn’t abruptly change again. This Hogwarts and the younger somewhat recognizable faces never dissolved in front of his eyes.
he couldn’t dare let anything slip his mind, no matter how potentially unimportant.
He smiled to himself, raising his head slightly and almost not noticing the students watching him. He wondered why he didn’t think of this to begin with.
That was Draco’s thought process on the matter, at least.
He was exhausted and honestly a bit queasy about pushing Potter as much as he was. He was never getting in his good graces if he kept along with his actions, especially if he kept insinuating that Potter was unwanted or worthless.
Just before he dropped the toy in Potter’s palm, however, he drew back. He couldn’t chance Potter not being made Seeker as soon as possible.
Granted Potter was right, but still. People called Draco Malfoy an arse, yet they haven’t seen the Golden Boy Harry Potter when he labeled someone an enemy (or a bully). He’s quite the little shit when he disliked people.
, it was unbelievable. If Draco didn’t know any better, he would say the Gryffindor was going to go
He exhaled shakily, body quivering ever so slightly, as his mind came back to him. His eyes clenched closed as he tried to breathe in slower. His brain was a bundle of negative emotions that refused to quit, refused to lift off his chest most of the time. More prominent at night, the terror made him quake and nearly run down the hallways he paced at night.
flight. In hindsight, he could see how Potter achieved “youngest Seeker” and how he nearly won each bloody Quiddick game - the talented, overachieving prat he was.
The future, his past and the present weighed on him from all directions, pressing him down from all sides. He pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes, trying to ignore his racing heart and his blurry vision. He chalked up the blurriness to the darkness surrounding him and the racing heart to a potential side effect of time travel, even though he knew neither were true.
People were eying him, mostly in intrigue, but nonetheless, it made Draco’s skin crawl. He almost couldn’t suppress his shudder, but he managed to do so, even adding a little saunter in his steps as he traveled over to the Slytherin table.
Draco sighed, nearly running a hand through his hair, but stopping at the last second, momentarily forgetting his current slicked-back hairstyle.
He would limit the amount of deaths (Crabbe would live, obviously), while he made sure to uphold his family name (his father wouldn’t be discovered or be placed in Azkaban).
Hello everyone! Thank you all for your comments, leaving kudos and bookmarking this work. I really appreciate responses! Here is another chapter. What do you think?
The never settling unease in his stomach increased fractionally, and his heart thudded a little louder in his ears. He swallowed harshly, shaking his head soon after.
future.
He had to remember that. He couldn’t dare forget.
Draco wasn’t entirely sure he heard her, his attention was directed elsewhere.
He wasn’t sure considering how his mind was all over the place, but there was some part of him that understood Granger’s skills and status weren’t what he thought. Granger was smarter than he allowed himself to admit, so was the so-called “blood traitor” Weasley, although sometimes Draco wondered about the redhead, and Potter was more intelligent than Draco gave him credit for, as well.
As Draco started to nearly stomp his feet in irritation, his brain stopped at a thought related to the previous one:
This is, apparently, the wrong thing to say because as soon as the words leave Harry’s mouth Draco is rearing back as if burned, crying out into the cavernous space. As quickly as they stopped, the walls begin to vibrate again, sending an ominous shiver down Harry’s spine. He grits his teeth, feeling the shift of magic within his very bones. Something is most definitely wrong.
“We all are.”
to Harry. No longer a childhood rival, or enemy, or even evil, but just, someone other than he normally would associate with—no one of consequence.
Harry’s final days in Venice are spent almost entirely at Draco’s flat. More specifically in his bed, surrounded by greenery and Japanese silk, the sounds of a Muggle vinyl record softly spinning away on the gramophone in the corner. After one too many interruptions from Cecilia innocently offering them trays of espresso and bread and cheeses, Harry had thrown the strongest warding charm he knew at the secret door in the wall, and threw another two at the bedroom door leading to the hall for good measure.
Draco halts at the sound of his mother crying his name, his hands on the doorknobs, his back heaving with struggling breaths. His wings are full, puffed out in agitation and his head is bowed.
Harry presses his forehead to the cool pane of the front door, glasses clinking against the surface. “Draco,” he whispers, breath fogging the glass. There’s a light in his mind’s eye, faded and small. He squeezes his eyes shut, straining to see it more clearly, but it fizzles even as he reaches for it, stuttering and weak.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh yeah, what is it?”
“He wrote to me the day you saved the foal.”
“A loyal house elf. Their magic is quite clever.”
Draco flicks his head up from his hands, pinning Harry with his preternatural gaze. A suspended moment of understanding seemingly passes between them, and Hermione wonders if what Luna said is actually true: that they can communicate without words.
“Shhhh,” she says, face turning slowly back and forth, searching, listening. “He’s in pain.”
Harry watches him go—throat dry, mouth open. Before Draco can round the corner out of sight, Harry is following him, desperate with a hunger he’s not let himself fully experience until this very moment, tequila be damned.
“No. We didn’t know anyone else was here when we found him. We’re afraid she was caught in the collapse.”
“Evening!” Hermione chimed. Harry didn't process the fact that he needed to let her in fast enough, and her expression shifted knowingly. “What’s wrong? You look weirdly flustered.”
“Potter?”
“We’ll talk later,” he simply told her and headed upstairs. Whatever it was she and Potter were up to, it was obviously something she wouldn’t tell him; no matter just how much he demanded to know. That left only two other options; he could try and coax it out of Astoria or he could hex it out of Potter. The latter sounded much more enjoyable.
“Why is Malfoy selling his family ring?” He said suddenly, cutting Hermione off.
, he wanted to scream.
He rolled his eyes. “Whatever. I'll find out eventually.” He grabbed his coat, tucked his ears properly under his hat and opened the front door. “See you tonight—make sure Blaise is around before you leave, just in case anyone arrives today.”
“Damn, erm… tell him to stop by at mine later today. I’m sure Hermione and I will be able to think of some commissions he can do for us at least. And try Fred and George, too. In fact, I need to pass their shop anyway. Walk along with me.”
“Slughorn?” To her credit, she sounded just slightly surprised at the familiar name. “I do, yes. She’s a lovely girl, very quiet and studious. And she was here just last September—she’d outgrown her Hogwarts robes, so I had to take her measurements again. What did you want to buy for her?”
“I was just thinking... maybe we could send one to Malfoy, too. Th-the Slytherin safehouse, I mean.”
Malfoy seemed to be stunned by his presence, a faint flush tinging his cheeks. But he recovered quickly.
No art about people because that could be insulting even if they were actually politically motivated cartoons. No unsolicited interviews which meant publishing the answer to a simple question now required three hours worth of paperwork. No shocking content lest the younger audience wouldn’t be able to stomach it and for some reason no
Sighing, Astoria threw herself down on her sofa and pulled the blanket around her. She could feel a headache coming up and she pinched her nose.
“Er… is that a yes?”
Now it was Harry’s turn to gape at the other man in surprise, even long after he’d disappeared onto the streets. Because if what he’d said was true, and Harry didn’t doubt that for a second, then he really
It was the first time Draco felt even remotely grateful for it.
Until he felt it, closer than ever, freezing him to the floor as Potter was led before him.
“Err, hi.” Astoria continued to stare Potter into an awkward silence, so unprepared to converse with him while her friends continued to argue at an alarming volume. Potter fidgeted, his hand consciously feeling his mouth as though he might have something smeared around it. Relief crossed his features and he looked past her, no doubt able to decipher just whose defensive shrills were dripping through the building. “I would ask if Malfoy is here…” a smirk met his eyes and Astoria suddenly remembered herself.
. It looked almost anticlimactic, and he didn’t have to wonder why they hadn’t decorated further.
Draco’s smile widened. It was still a few days until Christmas, but of course she would think that was ‘last-minute’. She always took so much care of every single piece of clothing she designed, one had to order at least one month in advance to have a present finished in time for Christmas.
The tiny little mooncalf in Luna’s clock purred thrice and went back in its hovel afterwards.
“I can hear you, you know.” Draco threw the piece of parchment into the bin without reading it through. His father had apparently learned some brand-new insults in Azkaban, and he wasn’t interested in knowing them.
. And oh, how he hated her for putting such a—a ridiculous idea into his mind. He hated Potter, too, for not leaving him alone already.
Harry grinned, swinging his leg to dismount the bike. With a flick of his wand, it parked and locked itself on the sidewalk. When Harry took off his helmet, he could see Malfoy swallow.
Together
decent man. Taking in stray kids, buying them gifts, and… well, and wearing red lipstick every other day, apparently. Clearly not what Harry would have expected during their Hogwarts years.
“Yes to all of that, but no, Harry shouldn’t offer to buy the ring. He should ask Malfoy what brought him to sell the ring. Surely something must have happened if they were managing their business fine up to this point, right? Perhaps there’s some other way Harry can invest the money to help Malfoy keep the safehouse going without having to sell his ring.”
“That’s good to know,” Madam Malkin answered, and Draco could sense the relief in her voice. He smiled reassuringly and settled back down while she chose a piece of firm, smooth elastic cotton and started to wrap it around a mannequin, which she then adjusted to match Tiresias’ size. “Is it their first binder?” She asked, and at Draco’s confirmation, she started to cut and stitch so blindingly fast that he couldn’t follow her hand movements. “I’ll write some instructions on its use in that case.”
He scrambled up, stumbled to the courtyard, where everyone was gathered.
“Sure, yeah. No problem.”
“What are you doing here?” She asked, somewhat crossly. Harry glanced around.
“Harry! Have you heard?” A breathless Seamus Finnigan called from the Leaky Cauldron’s doorstep. “Dean’s going to go out of business—how are we supposed to live from my job alone?”
Harry followed her back through to the kitchen. “Thanks,” he replied, glad for the change in subject. “D'you want some swirls while we fill them in?”
“Whatever.” Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to making breakfast. He had more important things to do than worry about Astoria’s opinion of him and his choices. Because with Christmas right around the corner and family tensions at a year’s high, a lot of people would be looking for a way out.
And then, faintly, as if by some sort of divine intervention, he started warming up.
, I need to think of more than just myself, my happiness is irrelevant, there are more important things at stake.” She feigned a yawn. “And let me tell you, as your best friend, that you are being stupid.”
Harry hadn't been expecting that. Some bantering, sure—getting to know each other, hopefully. But this was just… wow. For a moment he was dumbfounded.
“Call me Mary, young man. And you could never abuse of my kindness. Anyone else, maybe, but not you. You're too good-natured for that.”
“Where is it?” Pansy’s eyes were sharp like a hawk’s, and Astoria gestured at her purse, sitting on the floor beside the sofa.
“But—” Harry started.
“Sorry mate, but I had a feeling you’d want to hear her out,” Ron said, and shrugged. Astoria pursed her lips, the only sign of emotion.
And it got worse.
Potter was looking way too pleased to be credible.
Astoria closed her eyes briefly, her back straight and her face neutral despite the pain she felt inside upon selling her ancestral pendant.
Harry sighed to himself. The ‘prat’ really wasn’t a prat anymore, was he? He’d turned out to be a pretty… hell, a
It was a very excited Tiresias that greeted him at the other side of the door.
“Nicely done,” she congratulated but Astoria wasn’t about to pass on the opportunity to see Draco’s mid-hissy fit seizure. Grabbing Pansy’s arm, she towed the confused young woman with her until they were in sight of both Potter and Draco’s frozen form.
“Just because you’re the Saviour, doesn’t mean you get to soil innocent bystanders.”
“We need to divide tasks,” Pansy said as soon as Draco arrived home. She was holding Astoria’s hand. “Theo said he'd buy the rest of the food as soon as he knew how much stuff he could bring home from the vegetable garden, which will hopefully be today. Draco, can you take care of all the presents? Astoria and I can take care of the wood, and I can tell Blaise to arrange the bedrooms.”
Silence.
It was cold all year when Draco returned to school and Potter was on the run. He didn't know anymore whether Potter was in imminent danger or under a vague general threat.
“Not to you I’m not. As I said, Potter, you don’t know a single thing about me.” The flush of embarrassment was soon replaced by a flush of anger. Harry realised with shock that his careless joke had been the equivalent of poking a sleeping dragon. Something no one should ever do, as he was about to find out.
Just as he was about to knock, the door opened before him.
“Yeah well we all know past me should have been and has been locked up in a mental hospital so argument lost.” Draco sneered, though he felt quite unhappy about winning when he saw Pansy’s face fall. He’d been banned to the muggle world for three years after the war and a lot of shit had gone down in that time that Pansy didn’t know about yet. The mental hospital wasn’t one of those, but she still blamed herself for not being there for him at the time. He sighed, and tried to push his anger down. “Look, Pansy, I set up this place for people who have nowhere else to go. Mostly people who are deep inside the pureblood community. Potter is anything but that, so he doesn’t need to know. We’re going to be at maximum capacity as it is around Christmas. I don’t want half the Weasley clan banging on my door when mummy didn’t give them a second helping of treacle tart, alright?”
“Good morning, Draco, dear,” her voice sang behind him. “It's a pleasure to see you again!”
It was all crazy stupid and it would be funny if it didn’t also mean that Draco’s safe house advertisements and folders were now officially illegal. He’d set up his home as a place of refuge for anyone who wanted to live by their own rules but couldn’t due to the people around them. It was something that might have saved him from being such a dumb arse back in the day.
“Graffiti! Luna, someone’s been spreading erotic graffiti in awkward places. The Hogwarts Express, the Minister’s  reception room, St Mungo’s Emergency department. And they think it must be Dean!”
In the end, with Hermione’s help, he came up with a much less pathetic greeting. He read it over and over again before giving it to Kreacher, just to make sure there wasn’t a single word in there that could give away his dirty secret.
How many years were wasted
“Well, you know what? You can tell me all about it inside over coffee.”
“What is it now? I’m not going to join you and the Weasels for whatever atrocious celebration you have planned,” Draco said before he even set foot in the room to look at what silly minor injury Potter had gotten himself this time. Draco strongly suspected him of doing it on purpose just for a chance to bother him.
. And they're my friends.”
“Why the hell did you have to tell him that?” Draco spun around and glared at Pansy before the echo of his door slam even had the chance to leave the room. “This is a
Astoria had been half-attentive to the familiar bickering Pansy and Draco had launched into upon his reentry to real life. Potter had always been a sensitive topic what with him being both Draco’s sworn enemy and mid-life crisis waiting to happen. Feeling it unnecessary to excuse herself, she simply drifted from the kitchen towards the entrance, wincing ever so slightly at the pitch rise in Draco’s tone as he declared for the sixth time that he was
“Aren't you going to let me in? It's freezing, in case you haven't noticed,” Malfoy snapped.
A life or death experience
It all could have ended there because Draco was a sniveling coward, spooked by a mere image of the Dark Lord. Potter could have died and no chance for the Order and their cause to become more than a simple thought -- all because the Gryffindor was murdered, and Draco Malfoy basically helped end the git.
bond people together. Shared experiences and asinine epiphanies tended to explode in people during the strain. Draco could mark down a few mental notes as to when those occurred, but he decided against it. He didn’t want to delve on those.
Team Malfoy sounded more appealing.
If anyone asked he would deny this to his death, but having a firm grip on the broom, no matter how rough the handle was or how it looked like it already lived through the upcoming war and decided to accompany him back in time, was almost a weight lifted.
Anyway, hope you enjoy this chapter!
But he wasn’t certain. It could be anything that caused it at this point.
At last, a positive idea formed and stuck with him.
“Oh, you’re right, Potter.” Draco drawled slowly, seemingly contemplative. He watched as Potter’s eyes narrowed in suspicion and Draco made sure his face was neutral. He brought the Remembrall closer to Potter in an offering.
. His brain startled and drifted back to his previous thought because that was what he was: terrified.
It would obviously help to think, of course, but not to an extreme. He has seen when people don’t think and the end result of that mistake. Potter, for example, was not the most thoughtful person, and if he would have used his brain for something other than a kickboard or something that took up space, then Draco would have to worry for the other side’s sake.
Potter stole all the attention; all the lazy sod did was somehow survive an Avada Kedavra straight to his fugly face.
Just like last time, the speed Potter achieved was astounding on his first flight, nearly fulfilling Potter’s promise of knocking Draco off his broom. And no, Draco would never admit that he was surprised at how adept the other had been upon his
Draco forced himself to glance back up at Potter, glaring at him, daring him to do something. He didn’t know what, but he was asking for an excuse to either yell, scoff or smirk over at Potter now. His glare only intensified when Potter’s eyes narrowed back at him, undeterred. Unfortunately, his newly found intensity just caused a reflection of the same level right back at him.
that Potter would simply tilt his head in question, but not argue when Draco told him to do something for the sake of his mission.
, his mind supplied his fear helpfully.
His eyes bore into the ceiling above him as he lay silent in bed. He still couldn’t fathom the bizarre idea rolling around in his head.
It wasn’t a change Draco liked, he realized.
Nonetheless, forcing Potter and his group would be one of the last possibilities. If all else failed, he would resort to that. Even the thought caused him to nearly throw up in the grass by his feet. It was a good thing he hadn’t been eating properly to do so then.
He was in Hogwarts. He wasn’t at the Manor.
the group more. That would be a more practical idea: put more effort into being friendly instead of buddying up to the trio.

cemented it. Draco Malfoy did not belong as a Death Eater, but instead, he belonged to Team Potter.
After he thought some more, especially landing back on getting on Potter’s good side, he knew he had his work cut out for him. Potter and him would never be friends, of course - that thought would make Draco laugh aloud if he wasn’t careful - but he hoped they could get to the point of
Although he pushed that string of thoughts away, Draco’s stomach twisted in a familiar way, resulting in him sighing and gently pushing his plate further away from him. His sour mood had managed to destroy even the tiny bit of appetite he managed to get back.
Draco took another piece of the muffin with a slight smile at that thought.
Draco didn’t falter in his thoughts as he claimed his spot at the table and loaded his plate with food. He grabbed a piece of muffin between his fingers and placed it into his mouth as his brain continued to wander and formulate ideas.
Next Chapter: Finally progressing the story's plot! And more things start changing. Woo!
Harry could believe that.
Draco blinked as he lowered himself to the ground. Honestly, he could ask his father for anything now, and they could afford it. That thought finally registered in his mind.
Potter had nearly toppled over and snapped his broom in half against the stone in the process, but luckily, the Gryffindor merely flipped into a sudden halt as his broom brushed the building.
Instead, it drained him.
Draco bit his lip, dreading the encounter. The past few days he was trying to get used to everything, and in a way, he vaguely remembered specifically steering clear of Potter and his insufferable group. They were still insufferable, and always would be, to Draco. He was sure of that.
In the meantime, each House had a separate single room for him until he decided.
So maybe Draco was mostly a prick, and continues to be one, and Potter wasn’t all that at fault, but still Draco could point the blame. It was easier to do than anything else -- more natural than anything honestly.
He had been a prick more often than not.
. Maybe they were his
Harry knew his distaste was still visible, but it slid off the older man.
Of course Draco should give them slack, considering they didn’t know him from before, but he didn’t. He refused to allow them that win over him.
(In addition, I will respond later to the wonderful comments on last chapter as soon as I can. I read them, but unfortunately did not get the opportunity to reply. However, expect those replies within the week!)
Draco shook his head at his thoughts, skipping over that and focusing on the thought of their overall friendship. He recalled referring to them more as lackeys and imbeciles than anything, but at the end, after the Fiendfyre enveloped everything, he realized what he would miss. They were his friends, despite Draco’s pompous attitude and their lack of commonsense.
Draco could in no way find a suitable way to connect with Potter. He was going mad. He was almost yanking out his hair.
He nearly smirked, but it didn’t even make it as a quirk to his mouth once he heard Goyle sneer out something about Potter’s parents, well lack of more specifically, causing a familiar look of hurt in Potter’s eyes, mixed with the indignation that always followed.
Put that as the Prophet’s headline:
However, that didn’t stop him from smirking a bit. A slight upturn of his mouth was bound to bring zero attention to him, and it was only when he glanced up and connected with wary blue eyes that he discovered that it brought
Draco could attest to that, which almost caused him to rub where he used to have scars from the bathroom incident. He stopped himself at the last second though, slipping forlornly off his broom and spying Potter’s approaching form. The Gryffindors of the group began cheering, and Draco understood that he could start tuning them out again.
He inhaled to cause his breath to stop altogether as he rose from the bed, refusing to breathe until he was safely outside earshot of any Slytherin who were possibly out of bed at the ungodly hour. After he finally allowed himself to breathe, he gasped and gasped, hands clenching and eyes tearing as he fought against his emotions.
Potter would be a

While they all lined up to the left of the brooms on the grass, he stared at the rubbish broom they used for first years. They were despicable and loathsome. They resembled mostly a common Muggle broom, ill looking and not worthy to be used by anyone, much less wizards.
He felt surprisingly giddy.
His brain drifted back to his previous thoughts. At least something was doing what it wanted. Draco was still in the process of deciding what he wanted in comparison to what was required of him to ensure a better future.
Draco Malfoy was not going to succeed.
“That’s enough, Goyle,” Draco’s tone came out more curt and clipped than even he expected. “You can’t overuse the same joke. It loses meaning after the first fifteen times.” Everyone else was silently surprised. Draco continued with a slow drawl, “Use your own imagination next time instead of repeating what you heard. Be an individual.” He waved a hand, trying to ignore the group gathering by them. “Come, Crabbe, Goyle. Potter’s being a bore. Let’s find something more entertaining.” He sauntered away, not bothering to wait for his two friends to scurry after him.
The only idea that remained was by some off chance an actual occurrence presented itself, where they all were on common ground and not hurling insults and glaring at each other. He just had to figure out what that occurrence could possibly be, and it finally came to him.
Draco first froze, smirk immediately dropping, and then he quickly shifted his attention to his forgotten meal.
Luckily Potter was bloody lucky sometimes, but unfortunately he was cursed all the other times. There was simply no in between.
Weasley ended up being chopped in the face by his broom, and Draco almost snorted, instead he simply coughed. That would always get him every time, no matter how many times he witnessed it.
His thoughts scattered to finally land on the thought of Potter. Eventually he would probably have to tell Potter some

They remained clear as ever, as clear as the rising panic that threatened to consume him one of these days.
Also let me know if there are any characters you wish to see more of from the other Houses when Draco finally starts going House to House.
his own House.
If he wanted to be Seeker and have the best broom, he received it and then some. If he wanted his favorite sweets, he got them in the mail every day until he was satisfied. If he wanted to be someone’s friend, he tended to get that as well, all except Potter that is.
Therefore, flying and Quidditch it was.
It felt like he was back there in the future - back in his sixth year - wondering when people would take notice of him and would figure out he was a Death Eater planning on betraying them all. The feeling had merely been a feeling at the time, except for Potter because he could never leave well enough alone, but now it was a reality.
He reached down, fingers brushing the toy before he gingerly picked it up. He stared at it without comment, almost tempted to shake it and see whether or not something changed when he did so, just for something else to think about before the next moment. What happened next wasn’t necessarily something he wanted to do, but if he didn’t, Potter might not be selected as Gryffindor’s Seeker.
While the instructor coached the others on how to do everything, Draco waited for her voice to tell them to “place [their] hand[s] over the broom and say up”. He didn’t necessarily need to speak the words, but he did anyways, and the broom easily floated up to his fingertips.
“Excuse me?” Harry simply could not help himself; he was flabbergasted. They never stuck him with others, not even being fresh into the Auror Department. It felt like a demotion.
He made another mental note in reference to the trio’s own mission: befriend the insufferable group, well hopefully at least
If Draco wasn’t thinking about fixing things and not taking part as a Death Eater before,
He would challenge Potter to fly with him. The stupid Gryffindor could never resist a challenge or anything that involved flying or Quidditch, which was something Draco could somewhat relate to before Voldemort and Death Eaters and the madness with Dumbledore his sixth year and the hecticness of his seventh.
He only managed to calm himself with the hope that it wouldn’t feel suffocating and dark when he returned. Voldemort had never taken residence in the Manor before, so Draco wondered if the fear in his chest was unwarranted and would evaporate when he passed the threshold. He didn’t know for sure, but for his own sake, he stated it as if it were fact. He had to believe it or his body would start shaking.
And there was that old regurgitated shite he mentioned to himself earlier. He really had to stop allowing his parents’ words the power to corrupt him.
Draco didn’t recall what made the transition to wondering if he was in a coma or if he truly time traveled occurred, but he couldn’t help but allow his mouth to quiver up slightly.
Harry restrained himself from rolling his eyes, deciding to simply give a curt nod.
. . . .
If only they would grow up faster and have greater wits about them, Draco would be even happier, but as it turned out, he would have to wait for the change if it were to occur. Speaking of change, however, the newly developing change was about to appear once more.
“Thanks, Draco.” Potter was getting up, swinging his legs off the examination table.
That’s when the doorbell rang.
“I did actually. Me and my female presenting nipples had a great night.” Draco chuckled into Astoria’s neck but then grew serious. “My morning though… Not so great.”
Hermione reached across for the paper, glancing at the article. “That's the new restrictions the Ministry have put in place. You remember I was telling you? They're calling it The Purge.”
“Harry, our most prominent patron!” George slapped him on his back, then turned to Seamus. “Finnigan, my boy!”
“No, Potter, you really don't,” said Malfoy. “You have no idea what it means to be seen as a monster—to think yourself a monster—and to leave all that behind and actually better yourself. To dedicate your life to redeeming your past mistakes so you can look in the mirror and feel proud of the person you've become—someone who helps those who are vulnerable. Those who've been rejected, and who would find themselves alone like you once did if it weren't for you—only to be mocked by some stupid Ministry jerk who has decided advertising your safehouse should be illegal. Along with your damn female-presenting nipples, of all things. You wanted to know who I am, Potter? Well, that is who I am. A gender non-conforming idiot whose efforts to become a better person have been outlawed.” He breathed deeply, and then, almost as an afterthought, he muttered, “And that is why I had to sell my ring.”
He stared at the other man, struck again by how much he had changed over the last few years. Malfoy was taller than he had been in school and his features were even more well-defined than Harry remembered—high cheekbones, flashing silver eyes ...
Pansy swallowed. “We received the last payment today,” she said simply, as though she hadn’t been silent for almost ten minutes. “Astoria’s heirloom is now officially yours.”
Potter wanted to hang out with him.
“Gross. But that’s not why you’re having a headache now, is it?”
He knew something was about to happen that morning. He'd been cold on and off, which must have meant Potter was doing heroics again.
Pansy replied, but Draco wasn’t listening anymore.
“How do you—” Ron shook his head. “You know what, I don’t want to know. Just send him an owl asking to meet there. And try to act like you haven’t been stalking him, please.”

Then Pansy was smirking.
Ron shook his head. “You’re thinking way too hard, mate. You too, ‘Mione. There’s a much simpler solution to all of this.”
was in the wrong. Was this how quickly Potter had fucked up the foundations of his entire haven? Now his own friends were keeping secrets from him.
“I have a name,” she said with a sharp tone. “Are you going to invite us in?”
When she got back home, Astoria immediately went upstairs to the attic, not stopping to answer Draco or Pansy’s questions other than tapping a bag of galleons—the first part of the check she’d coined in Gringotts.
It wasn’t the eloquent plea Ron and Hermione had expected of him, but Harry knew Malfoy, he knew that any pretence would be scrutinised and mistrusted—more so than usual. Harry folded the parchment into an envelope, wrote Malfoy’s name on the front and summoned Kreacher.
“Good morning,” he nodded at her, feeling a smile tugging at his lips. “How have you been?”
“You can’t. Or… you can, but it’s going to be super awkward. When you buy that thing, you see, he’s essentially giving up on his chance to get wed. And that’s not something you can easily return to him. Not without marrying him.”
“He’s not even listening to me, is he?” Pansy was still standing right in front of him, but she was facing Astoria. “I can’t believe it. One mention of Harry effing Potter,
“Er—sure.”
They took their seats on the kitchen table. They ate silently, and Harry finished his soup while she helped herself to another brownie. He fidgeted, then cleared his throat. “So… what brings you here?”
“I’m not selling my engagement ring to Potter.” He spat out the name like he used to and desperately tried to recall the old feeling of hatred that used to go with it. He didn’t succeed.
“You two just
ran towards him, looking all flustered and fluffy and
“Nice try, but joking won’t prevent me from talking some sense into that pretty head of yours.” Pansy got up from the couch, grabbed their empty cups of tea and started towards the sink. “Look, I know you want to help those who are suffering, and I know what’s going through your head right now—
“Theo better up his game in the vegetable garden then if we want to feed all our hungry mouths.” Draco tried to joke, but it was a lot less funny because they might actually have to rely on that. The house was paid off, but none of the staff members had access to their family money anymore and only Blaise had a paid job. A job he’d have to give up if he kept working this much for their safe house. The last thing they needed was for him to get a burn out.
The next day, Pansy had confronted him about it.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Oh, very funny.”
“Potter,” she stated, all thoughts colliding.
“Why are you selling your family ring?” He blurted out, and then bit his tongue and cursed mentally.
“Just a moment,” she told him, and left him standing in the porchway. As soon as Potter could no longer see her, she broke into a jog before Pansy or Draco could say anything too damaging. Said squabblers were standing at the far side with their shoulders squared, Draco looked as though he could possibly spit venom. Unsure of how else to intervene, Astoria slammed the kitchen door to gain their attention. “Potter is in the foyer.”
Pansy huffed. “And then what?”
“Where is everybody?” Draco asked.
Potter wasn't dead.
Hermione’s eyes widened. An instant later, she was smiling. “That’s a lovely idea!” she said. “And it’s very mature of you, you know. To want to make such a friendly gesture towards your former—what did you use to call him? Your
“Is this about Malfoy?” Harry asked as Ron hung his coat up and kicked off his boots.
It was nearly seven o’clock in the evening when Draco excused himself—his quest for information was no longer sated by Joan’s presence. He left her playing chess with Astoria, purposefully ignoring Pansy’s questioning looks as he readied himself to leave the house. Potter better have some bloody good answers or he was going to shave the prat’s eyebrows off.
He’d wait all day if he had to.
But mostly, Draco just hated his own feelings—hated the humiliation of having to sell his right to marry, and the knowledge that, if no one else contacted him soon, he'd have no choice but to accept whatever offer Potter was trying to make.
at him. “He’ll come down any minute now. He’s been getting very little sleep lately, so I turned off his alarm last night. He’s going to be pissed, so I’m really glad you’re here to suffer his rage instead of me.” And with that and a snicker, he was gone.
“What can I do for you, then?”
Malfoy very visibly tried not to smile. “Whatever,” he muttered. He took off his scarf and coat, and left the room walking with an air of superiority. “You’d better not poison me with that tea, or I’m going to...” He rambled on, his voice echoing between the corridor walls.
“Oh Draco,” she'd said, and that was that. From then on, he had someone who knew. Someone he could confide in. Naturally, they grew closer.
Thick flakes covered the streets of London. It was getting close to Christmas, and it seemed that the weather had decided it was going to be stereotypical this year. People were hurrying through the snow, leaving slurry in their wake. Some took their time to revel in the wintery atmosphere, but most just wanted to get to their destination and get warm.
Finally led to my heart
Except he didn't. Because when Potter
As he got dressed the next morning for that night’s Christmas dinner at the Burrow, Harry could feel the undelivered postcard glaring at him from his bedside table. He glared back at it, wrestling with his trousers. Really, he should have thought things through. If he’d kept his mouth shut about writing to Malfoy, he wouldn’t have to see him. Perhaps he would never see him again, now that he thought about it—after all, the Heirloom issue was pretty much resolved, and the mere idea of becoming friends with him was dreadful now that he’d done what he’d done with that damned photoshoot.
But Malfoy was already answering.
And with that, Draco left the shop.
“Good evening, Potter.” It was Pansy Parkinson, no less. “May I come in, please?”
Harry looked down at the piece of paper, at the image of the Malfoy crest and at Draco Malfoy's name and owl address.
“So what you’re saying is,” Hermione cut in, “Harry should ask Malfoy to meet somewhere private, tell him that he cares about this safehouse of his, and that the
“Astoria’s...” So the heirloom had belonged to
He knew.
“That’s what I was trying to tell them, too. But—Merlin. The daft buggers! They think Dean’s responsible for the graffiti!”
, can.” Stepping back, she allowed Potter inside, closing the door behind him while he took in the decor with suspicious curiosity. “What brings you by?” Astoria tried to ask it in a breezy manner, hoping he might actually explain his presence. Potter, however, wasn’t listening to her now that he was within clear earshot of the kitchen drama.
“No. Uhm. I… Well. I can explain.” Potter looked sheepish.
The doorbell rang at the exact same time as the oven, and Harry jumped.
“So if he promises me—with an Unbreakable—that he'll marry the right person when he meets them, then everything—”
Did it start in the woods?
As soon as the miserable house elf was gone, Harry shrugged off his jacket and unlinked the cuffs of his shirt. The familiar gut-twisting tension he associated with Malfoy was making itself apparent as doubt settled in.
It was frightening, especially since he hadn’t a clue where the feeling had come from, and it took hours for it to pass. He wasn’t sick, it was summer; no reason for him to feel like this. Without knowing why, he kept it to himself. He didn’t warn the nurse, his friends or family.
