Things were quite usual at the Manor, even though he had been given an upgrade, as he was still to be a butler for the family. Still getting up at the crack of dawn for their breakfast, still standing outside Malfoy’s office for hours on end with Ron. That he was grateful for. He couldn’t imagine having to sit inside the office with Malfoy every day.
In this moment, Harry kept thinking back to when they were eleven. Malfoy’s outstretched hand, a smarmy grin spread across his mouth, attempting to make friends with one of the most famous kids in the Wizarding World. Though seemingly smug, there was an innocence to Malfoy then. He was only a boy, who just wanted to be Harry’s friend, who didn’t know any better than what his father had taught him for those eleven years he had been in the isolated environment. Harry remembered back to their conversation all those months ago, down in the basement with the dark artefacts. Malfoy had been such a lonely child, he’d had no friends growing up, and even when he made them, he felt as though they were only using him.
Harry gripped onto the silver tray that held the champagne flutes. He tried to avoid looking at the couple, walking around the room, offering out the drinks. A few politely said no, a few took the drinks.
Malfoy looked back at him. For a moment, Harry thought he saw a twinkle in Malfoy’s eyes, a twitch at the corner of his lips. But it may have been Harry’s eyes playing tricks on him, as Malfoy’s face didn’t change. He just searched Harry’s, wondering what to say next, thinking carefully about the right words.
“No, he is to stay here and guard the office,” huffed Malfoy. Harry followed him. It wasn’t often Malfoy left his office during the day, unless it were for dinner, and it was odd he had left Ron there. Usually he’d lock up the office, put an anti-unlocking charm on it. There was something in there that Malfoy seriously didn’t want anyone to see, and Harry desperately wanted to find out.
“We will floo to the manor,” said the minister of the American ministry, “and there we can arrest him.”
Malfoy sat on his office chair, head in his hands, sobbing. Louder than Harry had ever heard him sob. There was a pool of blood and tears sitting on his desk. His knuckles were, too, dripping with blood.
“Father,” said a familiar voice. “Why don’t you continue with breakfast, I’ll deal with Potter.” Lucius looked over at Malfoy for a moment, then smirked and nodded.
“I guess,” grumbled Ron as he shovelled more toast into his mouth. Looking down at his plate, Harry suddenly didn’t want to eat anymore. The thoughts all came spiralling back about that year, the feelings he got when he saw the people he loved, like Professor Lupin, laying on the floor, dead. Overwhelmed by these sudden emotions, Harry tried his best to blink away tears as he focused on his eggs, attempting to think about the orange colour of the yolk.
“I’m glad it was fine, sir,” said Harry, fiddling with the button on the cuff of his shirt. “I was a bit worried.”
“What’s wrong, Potter? You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” responded Malfoy with a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.
Quickly, Harry collected his things, chucking them into the first bag he found. A few clothes, his toothbrush.
The wand felt good in Harry’s hand. Today was the first day Harry would be Draco’s bodyguard. It had taken a week to get preparations, to get paperwork done and for Harry to pack up his stuff. Unfortunately for him, he had to move into Malfoy Manor permanently, even on the weekends, as this would be a full-time job. But Malfoy would be able to grant him days off and Hermione and Ron had told Harry he could stay at their house if there were any times Malfoy gave him a few days off in a row.
Draco sat there for a while, spitting out the blood that pooled in his mouth every now and then. He wasn’t sure whether he would be able to apparate home, his whole body felt weak, his mind numb. He was fighting unconsciousness, his eyelids drooping every so often, to which he would snap them open again. At this point, he felt as though he couldn’t find a reason to go home. His father would be furious he allowed himself to be so weak, his mother would get upset with his father for being so hard on her son. There seemed to be so little Draco wanted to be around for, maybe, he thought, he should just let himself stay here and deteriorate.
“I’m here,” said Harry quietly as they stood at the doors on their own, Malfoy staring at them. He nodded slowly, before stepping forwards, the doors opening automatically for them.
Finally, Malfoy decided on a robe, which was a deep red. It was the only red one Harry could see in the room, and it was strange to think of the Malfoy’s owning a colour that resembled the Gryffindor house.
Today was Harry’s day off, and he had planned to spend the whole day sleeping, but Hermione had other plans. She decided to drag Harry to Hogsmeade for a fun day with Ron and the kids, to grab some lunch and do some shopping. This was the last thing Harry wanted to do, he was so exhausted from the past week, but Hermione insisted it would be good for him.
“Harry, my boy!” Mr Weasley said to break the tension, giving Harry a hug. “Would you like a drink?”
“Better now you’re here,” slowly Draco managed to sit himself up, but took hold of Harry’s hand, as if he was terrified Harry would disapparate again.
They stood in the rain, just staring at each other, every now and then looking up at the sky to watch the flashes of light. Harry couldn’t help but watch Malfoy, he seemed so alive, so animated in the storm. His smile never faded, he even tried to catch droplets of rain on his tongue, he laughed and danced. The juxtaposition between this Malfoy, and the Malfoy who would stare straight forward when his own wife kissed him, who had no emotion in his voice, who no longer seemed to feel fear, or anything at that matter.
“I have an artefact I need to sell,” responded Malfoy coolly, putting a hand into the inside pocket of his cloak and pulling out the shrunken object, which was still wrapped in the silk cloth. Malfoy put it down gently and tapped his wand off it and everyone watched it grow back to it’s normal size. Mr Borgin slowly removed the cloth, his smile growing even bigger, which Harry didn’t think was possible, when he saw what was underneath. The deep purple crystal ball glimmered in the light.
“I can’t believe you didn’t realise,” Malfoy turned and laughed softly, shaking his head, his blonde hair falling into his face. “You must really be oblivious.”
. It said to use on enemies. No description, nothing. I was so wound up that year, Draco. I was determined to out you as a Death Eater, I was determined to show people just how cruel you were. So I used it, not knowing the repercussions. I had no idea it would do what it did,” admitted Harry, sinking onto his bed.
“We should get some lunch,” said Malfoy after a while of silence, pointing towards a small café that stood in front of them. Harry agreed and the two headed towards the building. Inside was small and quaint, the walls were a light-yellow colour and the tables had a single flower in a little vase on them.
“He’s doing an excellent job with the ministry,” piped up Theo as he jabbed his fork into his steak. “Top notch work if you ask me.”
“Draco?” breathed Narcissa, tears instantly welling up in her round blue eyes. Harry found himself rushing over to the limp body without a second thought and carefully moved Malfoy’s head. His cheekbone was cut open, swelling bigger by the second and already darkening in a bruise.
They turned a corner and were greeted by a mind healer, who took them to where George was. He was sat, playing wizard’s chess with another patient. It seemed very much like a muggle hospital, Harry thought.
Harry watched Malfoy for a few moments. His face was taut, as if he were deep in thought about something that troubled him. His legs took long strides as he strutted through the English town, trying to decide on where to go next. But his look never faltered, his chin never lowered, even though he was unsure on what to do he remained confident, as if he had walked these paths before.
After breakfast, all the butlers and maids got to work doing their duties. Harry and Ron mostly stood by Malfoy’s office, somehow ensuring his safety and also being there if he needed anything, like water. The pair had originally had some Auror training before Lucius took over the ministry, which was why Malfoy had assigned them and a few others to be outside his office, depending on who was on shift.
The chest grew to its original size. He pulled out the book he’d been flicking through back in the manor and placed it down on the table in front of the couple.
“Harry,” said Ron quietly as Harry had gotten lost in thought again. It was very nearly time for breakfast and there was no way he could deal with another beating from Lucius if he spilled water on him or did anything wrong. But Harry was so tired, all he wanted to do was crawl back in bed and pretend this day didn’t exist.
Without thinking, Harry walked over to Malfoy and pulled him into a hug. At first, he was stiff, but then he sank into Harry’s arms, resting his forehead on Harry’s shoulder, burying his face into his shirt. They stood in this embrace for a while, it felt as though Malfoy hadn’t had a hug in years.
“No, sir,” said Harry. “I’m putting my foot down. I’m doing what you’re paying me to do. Keeping you safe,” Harry grabbed onto Malfoy’s arms and tugged him off the seat. Malfoy attempted to break free, but at that moment was too weak. Defeated, Malfoy allowed Harry to pull him out of the Leaky Cauldron.
“Harry,” Hermione looked at him, “do you seriously not think she understands the situation at hand?” Harry’s eyes widened as he stared at his best friend.
“Merlin, Potter, calm down,” laughed Malfoy, shaking his head, his eyes kind. “You’re so worried all the time.”
“I’d never have imagined Malfoy to be sitting at my kitchen table,” laughed George with a mischievous grin.
“You know what the Malfoys are like,” Harry lied, knowing he couldn’t slip up and accidentally tell them. It was almost top secret what Malfoy took Harry to do with him, and he knew Malfoy selling cursed artefacts was definitely against the law, even with Lucius in charge.
“Sir?” asked Harry nervously. For a moment, Malfoy stopped writing, before continuing, his hand a little shakier than before.
As the top ex-Aurors in the manor, Harry and Ron stood by the doors of the hall to welcome the guests and ensure no one tried to sneak in. After that, they would start serving drinks with the other butlers.
“We know,” mumbled Ron, placing a hand on his knee before laughing, “you’ve never been pleasant when you’re hungover.”
“No,” he said. Nodding, Harry grinned at him, but his smile dropped when Malfoy didn’t look away. They continued to admire each other, before instantaneously Malfoy grabbed hold of Harry’s face. Their lips crashed together, teeth knocking together in passion, and their lips moved in perfect motion together. Sparks filled Harry’s body and the hair on his arms raised. He could taste the alcohol on Malfoy’s lips.
“I’m bored,” sighed Malfoy, pulling out a jumper and throwing it at Harry before continuing his search through the minimal clothes. “I want a day out in the muggle world. Go to a muggle café, muggle shops…” he trailed off as he pulled out some jeans, huffing before chucking them towards Harry, too.
But no, instead Malfoy sat down next to Harry. He was silent for some time, allowing Harry to get his tears out, before he finally spoke.
Thank you so much for all the love and support with this story. I am so proud of this work, and I'm sad to see the end of it. I hope this ending has satisfied you as much as it has for me.
The door to Harry’s cottage swung open as he carried through his trunks. After struggling to get them all in, he finally collapsed onto the sofa. A large grin tugged at his lips as he stretched across the sofa, happy to be home at last.
“Thank you,” said Harry at last before standing up and getting out his wand. He quickly cast the hot-air charm on Malfoy’s clothes before handing him back his blazer and turtleneck. Malfoy just held them in his hands for a while, looking down at them, before slowly slipping them back on.
The warm air hit Harry in his face, contrasting with how cold the manor always was. Malfoy had already started walking over the cobblestones, heading towards the centre of the town. Malfoy stayed silent the whole walk, just looking straight ahead, his chin up in the confident manor he always held himself. The town was truly beautiful, the buildings were all old and mix matched, the floor was purely cobblestones that Harry almost struggled to walk on.
Mouth feeling like cotton, Harry looked to the side of him where he expected Malfoy to still be. But, to his disappointment, he wasn’t there. The feeling of Harry’s heart dropping in his chest was heavy. Shaking himself off, he attempted to get up to have a shower, groaning at the thumping in his head and the churning in his stomach.
Three red ribbons tied to an owl. What could it mean? What was Malfoy up to? His shocked expression told Harry it was something bad, but his cool demeaner when Harry had questioned his motives. He remembered how panicked Malfoy had seemed when he thought it was Lucius, when Harry raised his voice above a whisper, as if he was worried Lucius would hear him doing something he shouldn’t be.
Harry’s heart sank seeing him this way. Without saying anything, he reached forward and slowly ran his fingers through Draco’s, now matted, white-blonde hair. It had been two days since Astoria’s death, and he hadn’t moved from the bed since. Hadn’t eaten, and Harry was almost certain he hadn’t even drunk anything.
“Dismissed,” responded Malfoy coldly. Nodding, Harry walked himself out of the room and stood next to Ron, posing himself in their usual, and muscle-aching, position of arms behind their back.
Harry poured himself a glass, which he very nearly spilled all over him when he saw a figure move in by him. For a moment, he thought the figure resembled Malfoy and his heart leapt from his chest, until he realised it was George.
“Harry, back up to the attic right now,” said Mrs Weasley in a serious tone. Nodding, Harry took Hermione’s hand and they headed up the flights of stairs quickly, out of breath once they had reached the top.
Harry looked around, ensuring no one was near, before pulling out his wand. With a quick flick, his canal boat came into view as he undid the cloaking spell. The same as Ryan, Harry owned a narrowboat as Ryan had told him how good they were for the London canals. Harry’s was a deep green colour, with gold detailing all around.
“Very funny.” He slumped down into his chair, watching Harry put his wand back in his pocket. “I don’t have anyone to talk to but you. How funny is that?”
“Quite,” responded Harry, sitting on one of the visitor chairs Malfoy had for when he held meetings. “After everything we’ve been through, I’m glad you feel comfortable enough to open up to me.”
“My son has caused me great disappointment as of late,” said Lucius coolly as he cut into his eggs. Ron instantly looked at Harry, then the two men looked over at Hermione, who’s deep brown eyes were widened, staring straight back at them.
Malfoy lead Harry to a room that was used for travel. He grabbed the floo powder and instructed Harry to do so too, then headed towards a fireplace. As he threw down the floo, he said loudly ‘Knockturn Alley’, which made Harry’s heart race. Slowly Harry made his way to the fireplace and threw the powder down, repeating the same words Malfoy had said.
“So, Malfoy and Astoria have been trying for a baby,” whispered Hermione, leaning close to the two eager men. “But they’re having trouble with it. It seems nothing they do works and it’s causing them issues.”
“Alright,” she said softly, but slamming the teapot down in frustration, “I was just asking a question.”
“Of course, Draco,” he said, before leaving the room. Quickly Malfoy grabbed onto Harry’s arm and dragged him through the halls, all the way to his office.
Sat at the desk was Malfoy, his head in his hands. His shoulders were moving up and down as he let out quiet, muffled sobs. Paper was strewn everywhere, as if he had just thrown it in a rage, and the teapot was smashed on the floor.
“We need to get him inside,” instructed Narcissa, crouching down beside the body that still lay on the rocks. Harry slowly pulled Malfoy up, keeping him steady in his arms.
“Draco,” whispered Harry softly, tucking hair behind Draco’s pointed ears. After a few more moments of silence, Harry stood up and walked to the other side of the bed. Taking off his shoes, he pulled back the quilt and lay himself down next to the small frame, which lay curled up like a child.
“No, Potter!” Malfoy stood up angrily and started to pace his office, shaking his head violently. “You just don’t get it, do you? It’s not that simple. It’s not that easy. He’s done this my whole life.”
The Weasleys had automatically set to work, setting up the attic with Harry so it was sustainable for him to live in. There were piles of junk up there, including boxes and boxes of memories Harry was sure he’d end up looking through when boredom struck. While Mr and Mrs Weasley dusted away the cobwebs, George and Harry brought up a mattress and bedding.
“Wait,” whispered Malfoy. Turning back around, Harry looked at him, noticing how small he currently looked.
“You’re worried,” Harry pointed out, reading her body language. Usually Hermione stood tall and proud, her chin up, but now she was hunched over, wrapping her arms around herself in a hug. She stared at Harry for a few moments.
Their relationship had fizzled a year ago, and she had moved out. They both wanted different things. She went on to play for the Holyhead Harpies Quidditch team, and she loved every second of it. Harry adored seeing her thrive in something she was excelling at. But she was always gone to play matches, and he spent most of the year on the grounds of Hogwarts, not wanting to leave during Christmas as it was so magical at that time of year. Naturally, their relationship died, but they remained friendly whenever they saw each other. Sometimes Harry missed her touch, her voice calling him in the morning, sitting by the fire with hot chocolates together, but he always knew it was for the best.
“We know,” said the unfamiliar voice, “but we received the owl with three red ribbons tied to his foot. Malfoy, we couldn’t ignore the message.”
Suddenly they were in the manor. Draco knew it was dinner time, so it would be easy to find Lucius. Only the day before, Draco had managed to muster all his strength to put a spell on the manor, making it physically impossible for Lucius to disapparate. Just like at Hogwarts.
A bright white flashed from the end of his wand, stretching as far as Malfoy could see. Then, a stag formed in front of them. The stag trotted around Malfoy, making him grin as it nudged its nose against his shoulder. The stag then galloped around the loch, on top of the water, on the bank, all around the two men who stood watching. Slowly, Harry allowed the memory to fade, and with it, the stag did, too.
“Yes,” said Draco as he curled into his mother like a child, “very much so.” Harry imagined Draco as a child, running in the garden and falling, grazing his small pale knee. Narcissa rushing over to her son, pulling him onto her lap and shushing him gently, telling him it’s only a scratch, and that he’s safe in her arms.
It took a lot of strength from him, and as soon as he reappeared with a pop, he cried out in pain. His chest and arm burned from the hex and he had to take a few moments to calm himself down. Lifting up his shirt, he looked at his torso. A deep purple mark decorated it, looking almost like a bruise. It wasn’t serious, it was supposed to be enough to harm Harry for a limited amount of time while the attacker grabbed him. But, of course, Harry was too clever and too strong for that. Sometimes, he thought, people must forget that he defeated Lord Voldemort.
“We should. I’ll apparate us back,” said Harry. Nodding, Malfoy gripped onto Harry’s hand harder, and they disapparated with a pop.
“Father,” his voice cracked before he quickly left the room, striding down the corridor. Harry had to run to catch up with him. Once they were in private, Malfoy turned and looked at Harry.
“Try harder!” Malfoy turned around, squaring up to Harry in anger. “I don’t pay you to dawdle. You do what I say, when I say it.”
“It’s been far too long, Mrs Weasley, I’m sorry about that,” said Harry once they finally released their grip.
“Yes, a few for you and a few for me,” Malfoy handed them over. Harry tried them on and ended up showing Malfoy the deep green tweed suit, knowing he’d like it due to the colour.
“I can imagine, you were so drunk,” said Hermione as she let him in. He sauntered his way through their house, approaching their lounge and flopping down onto the comfortable sofa.
He had knelt down at the spot where Astoria had lay, and Harry swore the floor looked darker there. Draco had run his fingers along the cold surface, a few tears dripping from his grey eyes.
After placing the box on the counter, Draco tapped his wand on the lid, and the box grew thrice the size it had been. Caractacus instantly looked excited as slowly Draco pulled off the lid and carefully picked up the ball.
“Oh, don’t make me say it,” sighed Malfoy, then frowned as Harry’s expression didn’t change. “I can’t. I don’t love her in…
“Yes,” replied Malfoy and walked in. Sighing, Harry trekked in after him and stood next to Malfoy as he looked at the clothes. Everything looked expensive, mostly suits, mostly tweed.
“Draco,” whispered Astoria, but before she could say anything else, Malfoy stood up – knocking his chair over in the process – and quickly rushed out of the room.
Harry had been having sleepless nights. He hadn’t left the attic in four days unless to use the bathroom. Even George had tried to get him to go on a protected walk around the grounds of the burrow, but Harry wouldn’t budge.
“We can certainly try,” said Harry, resting his head against the wall. “And look. My hangover stopped your panic attack,” he chuckled.
After a while, Harry went over to the bar. He didn’t know how much Malfoy had drank, but he always thought Malfoy would be a lightweight.
“How’s it going there?” Asked Neville, his Yorkshire accent always seemed stronger as ever to Harry as he wasn’t so used to seeing him these days.
Every now and then Malfoy would look over at Harry, who seemed to be intently watching the water which was sparkling in the sun. The small cut was still visible on Harry’s cheek, he wasn’t allowed to use any healing potion on Harry, and it hurt Malfoy to see him injured. Sometimes he’d look at Harry and see the eleven-year-old boy whom he’d desperately wanted to befriend, and sometimes he’d see the boy who he believed had destroyed his life.
“Well, you’re Harry Potter, aren’t you? Defeater of the Dark Lord?” Malfoy sneered. “Be there at eleven, sharp. Bring your wand.” And with that, he walked off. Harry watched them, Astoria kept muttering to Malfoy, but he didn’t seem in the slightest bit interested in anything she was saying.
“You’ve always been so big headed, Harry,” she tutted, making everybody laugh. For those few hours, it felt like they were back at Hogwarts.
They spent the remainder of the morning reading through Draco’s logs, letters and talking about ideas that they could think of.
The workhouses. Something new that Lucius Malfoy had put in place. Ever since he had become the Minister for magic, he almost refused to acknowledge that Muggleborns and Half-Bloods could do magic. Instead, he forced them to work and only be able to perform magic on the weekend. He claimed it was to keep them acknowledging where they came from, carrying out Muggle tasks throughout the week. Harry had nearly ended up at the workhouses, just for being who he was. For being the boy who destroyed Lord Voldemort.
“If you’re going to be seen with me in public, I won’t have you wearing butler clothes,” said Malfoy after those long moments of silence. He pondered through the clothes, looking at each one closely, as if it were a life or death decision for which he’d choose Harry to wear. Staying silent, Harry watched Malfoy pull out a robe, then put it back, before pulling out another one. They all seemed to look the same, thought Harry, and he didn’t know why Malfoy was so particular about it.
“I’m not saying I’m leaving, Mr Potter. I’m just informing you my son and I’s understanding to your emotions,” she reached a small hand to Harry’s calloused one and gave it a soft squeeze, “don’t feel that you have to be strong for him. Everything is very difficult right now, and if you need to cry, if you need to shout and scream, Draco will be right there with you.”
Finally, all the guests had arrived, so Harry and Ron stood at the side of the room with the other butlers, awaiting instructions from Malfoy.
“You have a Squib on trial today too, right?” Draco asked, speaking for the first time since he had walked in the room.
“We know,” said Ron, shuffling awkwardly. The three best friends knew Harry was now in danger. If he didn’t return, he could be captured and tortured. Yet, if he did return, he would be tortured for leaving. It was a losing battle, one that Harry felt he didn’t have the strength for. Not now. Not anymore. He’d already battled once in his life, had to hide from everyone and everything.
“My own son. My own flesh and blood. Betraying me?” Lucius tutted and began to pull his wand from the cane. “You should know better.”
Malfoy turned, and for the first time Harry noticed the dark circles under his eyes. “Astoria and I got into a fight this morning. She thinks it was wrong of me to get drunk with you last night. She wants me to be home whenever I can, trying to make a child. She desperately wants a little boy. So do I. I tried to tell her I’m allowed to go out and have some fun. She responded with I shouldn’t be having fun with the staff,” that comment hurt Harry. Was that also what Malfoy thought of him, as staff? Someone who once his task is done, isn’t needed anymore? Someone so easily replaceable?
“We need to be protected if I am going to tell you,” responded Draco, his face serious and solemn, “I can’t trust that my father doesn’t have anti spells to be able to hear all of my conversations. This was the first place I thought of.”
Harry used his wand to clean up the smashed teapot, while Malfoy used his to clean up the papers and set them back down on his desk. The two tidied in silence, but the company was comforting enough.
He placed the book back down on the bedside table, not wanting to bring those memories with him. Solemnly, he continued to grab a few important items, one being the photo album that Hagrid had given him in his first year of Hogwarts, and then he used a shrinking charm on the bag.
“We really fell for each other, then. Well, at least I fell for him. We’d sneak out of the manor to a place he liked to go and spend time together; we’d continue our day trips. Then Lucius found out and attacked me right in front of Draco. Told us I was no longer his bodyguard. Our relationship we had together became extremely strained, and we constantly argued, until I just couldn’t take it anymore,” finally, Harry looked up at Mrs Weasley. To his surprise, her eyes were twinkling with understanding, a small smile on her thin lips.
“Draco!” yelled Harry, seeing the limp body heaped on the grass. Kneeling down beside him, Harry rolled Draco’s body over.
“Do you think he heard us?” Whispered Ron, a worried look on his face. All Harry could do in response was laugh.
“This is records I have compiled since Lucius’ reign as the minister began. From how he became the minister, to things he has been hiding and illegal actions he has taken.”
“Children, please!” huffed Hermione, attempting to control her wild kids at the dinner table. Harry was now pleasantly buzzed, an attempt to ignore the thoughts rushing through his mind every time he looked over at George, who was now drunk.
“I’m glad you think so,” repeated Malfoy, looking over to Harry nervously. It was almost as if Malfoy didn’t agree, which was peculiar, considering he’d spent so many years tormenting Hermione for her blood status.
Suddenly, there it was again, watching him coolly, like Draco always did. Even when in pain, even when weak, Draco would remain calm and collected, unlike his days at Hogwarts. With a nod of its head, the wolf turned and began to walk again. The light was still dim, so Harry made a point of walking quicker than before, ensuring he’d reach the destination before Draco got too weak.
“I’m fine,” said Harry, attempting to shake himself out of it. But it seemed the more he thought about it, the more tired he felt. Stifling a yawn, Harry straightened himself up when the doors opened, and the Malfoy family walked in. Malfoy looked just as tired as Harry did, which didn’t take Harry by surprise.
“I’m so sorry, sir,” stuttered Harry, preparing himself for a beating. There were years and years of anger towards Harry that Malfoy could beat him for, all the times Harry back chatted him, the incident in the bathroom. Harry’s eyes remained shut, but nothing happened. When he finally got the confidence to open them, he saw Malfoy transfiguring a piece of paper into a tissue, before directing Harry to his seat. The seat that Malfoy always sat at.
Curling back into him, Draco’s hand grabbed onto Harry’s. “That’s all I need,” said Draco, the first words he had spoken since arriving at the Weasley’s household.
Once the food had been laid out, even larger doors opened and in they came, the family Harry dreaded to see each day, following each other in one after another. As the family sat down, Harry and the other butlers got into action, grabbing the objects they did every single morning. Harry would be the one to pour the water.
Malfoy paused, looking into Harry’s bright green eyes, the eyes he found himself lost in time and time again.
“I don’t know why it is the way it is,” Malfoy seemed to be speaking no sense, “but I need to find out. I need you to help me find out.”
“What’s wrong, Ron?” asked Harry finally, after Ron had looked at his pocket watch for the tenth time in the past hour.
“Ron,” Hermione hushed, irately running her fingers through her mass of black curls. “I know you’re angry, but you know better than to go on like this.”
“George?” asked Harry, placing the glass of water down as his hand shook too much to hold it steady.
“I don’t care,” yawned Malfoy. Trying his best not to chuckle, Harry shook his head. Malfoy looked very sweet, lying there curled up, his eyes closed still.
“You’re always hiding something,” sighed Harry, slowly sitting himself up to Malfoy’s dismay. “Sneaky conversations with Blaise, trips to Borgin and Burkes that you don’t explain, now this.”
Harry had been helping set up the hall in which the party would be held. Green curtains hung on the floor to ceiling windows, the long table was decorated in a dark green velvet table cloth, candles decorated the top of the table and to put a Hogwarts twist on things, Malfoy enchanted candles to float in the air like the great hall. There was even a dark green rolled out carpet that ran through the middle of the hall.
Harry hadn’t thought of that. Malfoy too reminded him of the good days. There was nowhere he felt more at home than Hogwarts, and he hadn’t felt that in a long time. But there was comfort in being around Malfoy, because he missed those days too. Ron and Hermione had grown up, gotten married, had children. Ginny was a professional Quidditch player, she enjoyed her life. Everyone else he had become friends with at Hogwarts had gotten married, or gotten a different job, or weren’t affected by Lucius’ orders.
“You’re an absolute moron, Harry Potter. You should have told me you weren’t well enough to come with me.”
“Please,” responded Harry. Mr Weasley got up and waddled over to the drinks table. He was looking much older these days, his ginger hair now completely white, wrinkles settled into his forever smiling face. It worried Harry, the thought of Mr Weasley dying. He didn’t know if George would be able to handle it.
The morning seemed to go from bad to worse, as Harry didn’t get his cue early enough. He moved last, tripped on his own feet, then spilled water onto the table. Lucius, of course, was furious and got up to punish Harry, grabbing him by the collar and taking him to a separate room. The same thing happened as before, right on the same cheek, which wasn’t fully healed.
For the year after defeating Voldemort, Harry had no idea what to do with himself. His whole identity was to defeat Voldemort and that had gone within one day. Of course he was celebrated, everyone would congratulate him on the streets, and this time it was even more than before, as Voldemort was actually dead. Everyone had seen his lifeless body lay there, unlike all those years ago at Godric’s Hollow. This time the fame had really gotten to Harry, and he lost himself. It was his sudden love of canal boating that brought him back.
“Doesn’t matter. You saved me,” his lips curled upwards. Was this Malfoy smiling? Harry hadn’t seen that in years, not since Malfoy had been in the Inquisitorial Squad.
“We’re not talking much anymore. It’s quite hard on my mother,” said Malfoy truthfully. “She was the person who set us up over a dinner. Astoria and I really got along well, and we ended up seeing each other more. But after getting married, things just stopped being as good as it was. There are things about myself that I still don’t understand,” Malfoy swallowed, his shoulders tense, “and I am still trying to figure them out.”
“Perfect,” sighed Harry, the irritation dripping in his voice. Switching off the shower, he grabbed his towel and dried himself off before stepping out. Grinning at Harry, Ron grabbed his towel and walked over to the shower himself.
But, as soon as they had stepped inside, Astoria took Malfoy off him and started leading him towards the stairs. Harry went to follow them, but felt a hand gently slide into his and pull him back. Looking behind him, he saw Narcissa with a forlorn look on her porcelain face.
“Please, Narcissa,” she responded with a spirited grin, before turning and walking away. Harry watched her walk, noticing the similarities between her and Draco. Both walked with utter confidence, chin in the air, moving as though they were floating rather than walking.
“It’s my pleasure,” answered Harry as they all sat down at the table, the other patient leaving to give the three some alone time.
“It’s true,” Ron interjected. “Malfoy tortured us, you especially, in Hogwarts. Called you vile names and bullied any Muggleborn. Now he’s just rolling over and acting like his father is a big inconvenience.”
“There’s something father has asked me to do and I need you with me, please,” Malfoy’s words were rushed, scared. His lip trembled as he spoke, and he could barely maintain eye contact.
After finishing his pasta, Harry retired to bed. He was exhausted from the long journey and was more than excited to finally curl up under his covers, in his own bed. The beds at Hogwarts were definitely comfortable, but there was no better feeling than his own bed.
“What was your memory?” asked Harry nosily. Smiling, Malfoy looked at Harry’s eager face. His body still felt warm as the memory only slightly lingered.
Still unsure, Draco warily followed Harry into the oddly shaped house. As it was morning, the Weasleys were sat at the kitchen table, a large breakfast piled up. As soon as Harry entered, he was met with a swat over the head, then engulfed in a hug.
Ron answered instead. “Lucius is so angry about you leaving that he says he’s going to change some rules until you’re found. Make things more tough so people will be more likely to try and find you.”
Harry’s lack of concentration on the job had gotten him in trouble a few times. Once with Lucius Malfoy. Harry had accidentally spilled water onto him, only a few small drops, but that was enough. Lucius got up, grabbed Harry by the hair and dragged him out of the dining room.
“Is he here?” Harry heard as he groggily began to wake up. The voice was familiar, a soft female voice with an edge of concern.
“All I could see was Dumbledore staring back at me, telling me I’m a good person, that I can be helped. I don’t want this, Harry, I don’t want this life!” His breathing was rugged, he clutched his chest as he struggled to draw another breath, choking on his tears.
“I know. I’ll manage. I managed before. My mother’s lovely, Harry. I spoke to her before I came to see you. She feels bad. She’ll look after you.” Malfoy seemed to ramble on. Something Harry had never seen him do before. His sentences were short, he barely left room for breath, he was quite obviously nervous.
“I’m here, you can cry all you need to,” Ron spoke softly to him. At this point Hermione had entered the room and was now rushing over to the side of the bed, crouching down in front of George and gently stroking his hair.
“We just wanted to talk,” came the response from a shadowed figure, and Draco saw two other men appear from behind it.
In a groggy haze, Harry heard his door open and shut. He tried to look to see who it was but could only see a blurry figure. One eye was swollen shut and his lip had been cut open, his nose had definitely cracked out of place. The pain was unbearable, and after attempting to lift his head, he had to put it back on his blood-soaked pillow.
Harry placed the cup of tea on the bedside table before sitting down on the edge of the bed. Draco didn’t move, didn’t even blink.
“Some of my friends at the ministry approached me yesterday. Told me how you had been caught in Knockturn Alley, being assaulted by a few wizards. Is this true, Draco?”
“I just wish I could have had a normal childhood,” said Harry candidly. “I went from my parent’s death, to be my aunt and uncle’s waiter, to be Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort. Twice.” Shaking his head, Harry looked down to the floor.
Twelve came around slowly, and Malfoy welcomed the guests into his office, Harry standing by. He got into his usual position, hands behind his back, watching every move everyone made. Something about this situation seemed odd. Never in all the time he had worked here had Malfoy let anyone into the office while he was having a meeting.
“Proceed,” Malfoy said to the man. Slowly, he placed his wand to the pile of papers, a small light shining before he removed it, making a copy that would print out back at the ministry.
“This is really peculiar,” said Mr Weasley, looking at the strands of ribbon that lay flat on the surface. “It’s very clever, Draco. Did you come up with it yourself?”
Ron and Hermione were now on the bed, too. Hermione lay on the other side of Draco, stroking his hair softly, while Ron took hold of his other hand.
“I’m glad to hear it,” said Ron with a proud smile on his face. This was the first time George had accepted proper help. The most he had done before was seeing a mind healer once a week. Even after his attempt, he refused to seek treatment for years. There was no doubt in Harry’s mind that Ron wasn’t extremely proud of his big brother for being so brave. And Harry was proud, too.
There was a soft knock on Harry’s door. Expecting it to be Ron, Harry didn’t bother with throwing on a shirt, and opened the door in just his trousers. But, on the other side, was Malfoy. The swelling in his cheek had gone down, he must’ve used an elixir on it, and the cut was on its way to healed.
“Draco?” another voice called from behind them. Harry turned to see Astoria, running down the garden in bare feet, her long white dress flowing behind her. Sometimes Harry saw Astoria in the gardens just before dawn, in her white dresses, making her look like a ghost that haunted the grounds.
Harry stared at him. At this moment, he felt nothing but hate. It was as if he were back at Hogwarts, all that anger he felt when he found out about Katie Bell, all the pain he felt when he saw Malfoy point his wand at Dumbledore. Hands beginning to shake, Harry finally lowered his wand. There was nothing he wanted to say to Malfoy anymore.
Something sent shivers up Harry’s spine as they entered. The whole room unnerved him, and he couldn’t figure out why. Malfoy walked along the artefacts, carefully looking at each one, before deciding on a deep purple crystal ball. He pulled a silk cloth from his robe pockets and wrapped it around the ball, slowly and carefully picking it up. Malfoy tapped his wand on the ball and Harry watched as it shrunk in Malfoy’s thin hand, who then slipped it into his robe pocket.
The thought made Harry’s heart lurch, and without thinking beforehand, he grabbed onto Malfoy’s hand.
It had been ten minutes before the light came back. But this time, it kept growing and growing. Harry couldn’t do anything but stare, not even reach for his wand that sat on his bedside table.
The tears fell one after another, dampening his face. Attempting to quieten his sobs hurt his whole body. He couldn’t be weak, not now.
“But we will do whatever we can to help you,” said George from behind Harry. “Don’t worry, mate. We’ve got you.”
“It’s hard not to be,” admitted Harry coyly, a small smile curling his lips as his cheeks reddened. He hated seeming weak in front of Malfoy, but Malfoy had been so open with him recently.
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley. I’ll come and see you again very soon,” he responded. He said his goodbyes to Mr Weasley and the kids, before floo-ing himself back to his small apartment.
“Potter,” said Malfoy, “I need you to run some errands with me. Weasley, you can have the rest of the day off. How’s George?”
“I told them when I first arrived here. I was expecting a complete bollocking from Mrs Weasley, but she accepted it. You will be fine.”
“Come here,” said Mrs Weasley, grabbing onto Draco’s extremely thin frame and wrapping her arms around him. Draco seemed to melt into the hug. As much as he loved his mother, he lacked the nurture Mrs Weasley had given to all her children for all the years they were alive. Not because Narcissa didn’t love Draco the same amount, but because she wasn’t able to show this love in front of her husband. Who always stood by her side when she saw her son.
It had been a long and difficult week for Harry. The thoughts of George had haunted him every moment of the day, reminding him that it was his fault George was like that. Ron had requested leave from work to help take care of George, who according to Ron, wasn’t getting any better.
“Are you going to let me in?” asked Malfoy impatiently. Moving to the side, Harry watched as Malfoy gracefully swept into the room. He was clothed in a long black cloak, held together with an ‘M’ pin. It took Harry a few seconds before he closed the door.
Draco’s breathing had become slow and steady. Moving slowly, Harry looked down at the pale face that lay beneath his. Draco’s eyes were shut, his mouth very slightly open. He was asleep.
But the more Harry thought about it, the dizzier his thoughts were and the churning feeling in his stomach returned. He got up and headed down the many flights of stairs that held the burrow up. Water was what he needed, and maybe some fresh air.
“Well he’s not going to!” Malfoy’s voice was raised, he was agitated, scared. “Because you’re not going to say anything. And everything will be fine.”
“Sorry,” said Malfoy softly, his face close to Harry’s. Harry could feel his breath blow across his cheek. “I’m just very tired.”
That night, there was a large thunderstorm. Harry was sure it reached across most of Britain. The thunder crashed loudly over the burrow, lightning flashing every few seconds. The rain battered down so hard on the window Harry thought it might break.
“Yes,” said Malfoy sheepishly, looking down at his lap. Harry saw him start to pick at his knuckles, which were the worst they had been in a long time. Crouching in front of him, Harry placed his hand on top of Malfoy’s, getting him to stop.
“How is he?” asked Narcissa, turning and facing Harry. Her expression was worried, and there were fine lines forming on her face that Harry hadn’t noticed before.
Once dressed, he freshened himself up before exiting the bathroom. Malfoy was sat on his bed, reading the book Harry kept on his nightstand.
That was all it said. There was no mention of last night, of the fun they had together, of the kiss. Was the kiss even real? The events of last night were so fuzzy in Harry’s brain he couldn’t remember if it had actually happened or not. Surely it had, right? After all, Malfoy had left a note pushed under his door.
Blood boiling, Harry pulled out his wand he now kept concealed in his jacket and pointed it at Malfoy.
Wand firmly in hand, Harry continued on, entering the village. Streetlamps decorated the empty roads, everyone tucked up in bed in the cold early morning. It hadn’t even reached time for the morning chorus yet.
“I had to get out of there. I didn’t want to be around him anymore. Seeing him would hurt me too much. Every time we spoke, it was an argument, and it pained me so much,” shaking his head, Harry looked back down to his lap, tears forming in his eyes. He attempted to blink them away but failed. “Oh, Mrs Weasley, I think I’m in love with him.”
“Ginny!” He got up from his seat and rushed over, wrapping his arms around her as a greeting. They held in an embrace for a few moments, Harry’s arms able to wrap all the way around her small figure. Ginny and Harry had been together for a while before their relationship ended. It didn’t work out between them, they both got invested in work and Harry realised something big about himself during their relationship. So, naturally, they ended things, and have been great friends ever since.
Harry didn’t respond, he just continued chopping carrots. Hugo and Rose suddenly ran through the kitchen, chasing each other, which made Mrs Weasley jump and Harry laugh. It was rare that he laughed nowadays, but it always felt good when he did.
“Draco has been very, very stupid,” slowly Lucius rose from his seat and made his way towards Malfoy. Shoulders sinking, he looked like that timid boy back in Flourish and Blotts, hunching away from his father as much as he could, afraid.
“Am I? Or are you?” Harry’s face was red with anger now. He had no idea what came over him, what made him suddenly so furious with the beautiful figure that sat before him, but he couldn’t help himself. “You rely on me so often. It’s as if you can’t live without me by your side. How do you think that makes me feel? Am I going to have to look after you forever?”
Filled with anger and annoyance, Harry floo’d himself to Malfoy Manor at 10:50am. He was met by one of the weekend staff, who accepted his identification. Sometimes he wished he was one of the staff who were at the front of the house, they were able to use magic to identify everyone who came into the Manor. But no, of course he had to have the job where he stood for twelve hours a day, outside Malfoy’s office, serving him food and leaving his wand at home.
When he arrived, Malfoy was stood waiting for him. Without saying anything, Malfoy started walking towards Borgin and Burkes. Harry stayed close by his side, his wand tightly grasped in his hand, knowing this scene had a possibility of getting messy. Malfoy confidently strode into the Dark Arts shop, nodding to Mr Borgin as he entered.
Malfoy turned and looked at Harry. His green eyes glinted in the dim candlelight. They were warm, inviting, nothing like how they were back at Hogwarts. Back then, they only looked at Malfoy with hatred, with anger, with resentment. But now they searched deep into Malfoy’s face, watching, and analysing, his every move, trying to take something away from every conversation they had, every facial expression Malfoy pulled.
“All the time,” he said finally. They continued to be in each other’s company in silence, while Malfoy carefully cleaned Harry’s face. Just the gesture of Malfoy helping him made Harry’s eyes fill with tears. This man, years ago, would have laughed at Harry getting injured. Probably would have helped inflict it, too. But now, instead, he was tending to Harry’s wounds.
“Me too,” said Harry. “She’s quite nice to me when I pass her. Always civil. I think it’s because I saved Malfoy’s life.”
“That’s weird,” scoffed Malfoy, the heels of his shoes clicking on the marble floor. “Muggle fiction books are weird.”
“Then tell us why the payments were void,” piped up another man, who was shorter than the others, but seemed far more threatening.
Harry’s eyes quickly darted to the side, his breath caught in his throat. He braced himself to see Draco lying there, cold, stiff, just as he had seen so many bodies during the battle.
“The same as before,” he replied. He looked back at Harry, searching his face. The longer Malfoy looked at him, the more Harry felt his heart beating faster, and he eventually looked down at the table.
“You sure as hell made it seem like it,” spat Harry. Malfoy turned and glared at him, and instantly he knew he had messed up.
“Me neither,” he finally said, almost breathlessly. Suddenly Malfoy sat up, swaying as he did, and stared at the floor.
But today, something was pulling him towards Malfoy’s office. He was still allowed to go there, as it was his main position, and there shouldn’t be an issue with just checking on the office, ensuring it was locked, ensuring Malfoy wasn’t in there.
“We’re so sorry, dear,” said Molly through tears, “this has been sent to all the witches and wizards.”
“Mm. That’s just how it is, isn’t it?” Malfoy looked back up at him, his grey eyes piercing. They were searching Harry’s face, as if searching for an answer. “Everything ends. Nothing lasts, not our relationships, not our souls. Sometimes it’s hard to remember the point of anything. Signing these papers, sipping tea, waking up in the morning. It’s all another step closer to our ends.”
“In love with Draco Malfoy,” said George from across the room. Harry had almost forgotten he was there. “Well, I guess
Travelling always knocked Draco about a bit. There was something about it that tired him, whether it was apparition or floo powder. Either way, he now felt tired, which wasn’t ideal. But, when didn’t he feel tired nowadays? It seemed no matter how much sleep he acquired, his body always felt as though it would crumble beneath him, his eyelids always heavy. There was so much going on in his life, more than anyone else knew about, it exhausted him just being awake. And, as much as he desperately wanted to tell Potter everything that was happening, he knew he couldn’t. He would put so many lives in serious danger, and he didn’t want to do that. Not again. Not like back in Hogwarts.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” asked Harry. As he looked down at his cup of tea, he noticed his hands were shaking.
“Oh, Harry,” sighed Hermione, placing a hand on his and giving it a squeeze. “You’ve gotten through something like this before, remember? It felt like there would never be an end when we were seventeen. It all worked out in the end.”
“He wants to send all muggleborns to the workhouses,” said Ron. It took Harry a moment to understand, to realise what it would affect if that was implemented. Then, he looked up at the girl who sat before him, who now seemed so small, so delicate.
Harry didn’t expect Malfoy to hear him. “I’m sorry,” he repeated, “for what I did to you in our sixth year.” Harry didn’t dare look at him.
“Alright, goodnight,” said Ron. Hermione stood up and wrapped her arms around Harry, she always gave him a hug before they went off to their rooms. The hugs always felt Hermione didn’t know whether they’d see each other again the next day. Which, in the past, was definitely something they risked every day. It was hard to let go of that, even so many years later, the trauma still resided in all of them. Especially with Lucius now in charge, he could easily change the rules and make it so Hermione would be sent away, which terrified her to no end.
“I will do my best to keep Hermione safe,” said Draco softly, “as I know my father is becoming extra strict on muggleborns. If it comes to it, I will send her and Astoria away for a few weeks, so there is some form of excuse for her to not be at the manor.”
Malfoy didn’t answer. Harry quickly caught onto the fact Malfoy hadn’t told Astoria about the loch and didn’t want to. It was his safe space, where he could go to escape everything in his life. Telling Astoria now would destroy that privacy from him.
“I know you were involved in the Order back in my Hogwarts days. You’re among the few of the Order that survived the war, and haven’t been sent to the workhouses or to work for pureblood families,” Draco shifted uncomfortably as he thought back to the war, thought back to all the bodies he had to step over in order to get to his parents. “I need your help with something that’s incredibly important but has to remain a secret.”
“It was handed to my father at the ministry, taken away from an ex Death Eater who was attempting to use it for evil.”
“A wolf,” breathed Harry as he finally looked over to Malfoy. He could just about see the pointed face beside him in the moonlight.
“I know,” responded Malfoy, heading straight over to Harry’s closet and opening it up. He rummaged through Harry’s casual wear, grunting every now and then. Malfoy had always thought Harry lacked fashion sense.
The town seemed sleepy, not many people were about. It was quiet, the sound of birds chirped in the distance and the sun warmed Harry’s face. It was the first day in a while that had been warm, but according to the clouds, that would change soon.
That night, Hermione held a large dinner for hers and Ron’s family, inviting Draco and Harry to join them, in celebration for her new position as minister.
Harry looked down at the chunk of wood in his hand. It was heavy, as he remembered. Holding it felt warm in his hand, it felt right. The wand had reacted to him the same way Harry’s personal wand had.
Harry was back in the small room that he had began his time at the manor in. Dark, dreary, and consistently reminding him of the cupboard under the stairs. Having to share bathrooms with the other butlers. The perks, though, were that Ron’s room was only down the hall, and now they snuck out to visit each other every night like they had used to.
Malfoy stood at the door of his office, leaning on the doorframe, arms folded. “What are you pottering about for, Weasley?”
“What are you two talking about?” came Malfoy’s voice from behind him. Harry knew not to react as Malfoy gave his backside a gentle pinch, before standing to the side of him.
“A floo network with other ministries has been set up here. At some point within the next few hours, members of the French, German, Norwegian and American ministries will be entering here. Then we can commence the operation.”
Without a second thought, Harry crashed his lips into Draco’s, cupping the sides of his scarred face. For a moment, Draco was surprised, but relaxed into the kiss, placing a bony hand on the back of Harry’s head, fingers gently running through the wild black curls.
Lips pursed together; Harry decided to keep quiet. Sometimes he forgot that they were adults, his childhood had been ripped from him since he was one years old. After that, he was never able to have fun like a kid, even when he went to Hogwarts. In his first year he had battled against Voldemort for the first time.
“I have something to tell you both,” she spoke in a hushed tone, she didn’t want anyone else to know.
“You know you can talk to me,” Harry’s voice remained soft, partially to soothe his head, partially to soothe the tall, slender man in front of him, who was visibly shaking.
They had moved out of Malfoy manor, has there were too many memories lingering there. The last thing Draco did before officially leaving the manor, was step back into the dining room for the first time.
Now working as a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Harry couldn’t wait until Scorpius turned eleven, and he could teach his own son.
“You’re literally staring at me,” responded Harry. Rolling his eyes, Malfoy opened the bathroom door and beckoned at him to enter it.
Friday finally arrived and Harry felt relieved that it was nearly the weekend. He had decided he was to go and see Ron and Hermione, maybe take care of the kids for them while they see to George. He’d sleep for as long as he wanted.
“You mean Snape’s curse?” pondered Malfoy, walking closer to Harry. Slowly he put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, causing Harry to jump and spin round. He seemed so much taller now, or maybe Harry just felt small.
has to be,” he joked. Harry tried to look stern but couldn’t help the grin that tugged at the corners of his lips.
Slowly, Malfoy sat back down on the bed and stared at his lap. “The reason Astoria and I are having problems, isn’t because I don’t love her. It’s because… I’m unable to
for my father’s imprisonment. I was sick to the bone of you, constantly getting points for Gryffindor, destroying my time at Hogwarts by just being Harry Potter. After the war, I wanted absolutely nothing to do with you. When I heard you’d have to go to the workhouses, I fought for you to be a butler here because I thought I wanted to torture you,” Malfoy laughed and shook his head, facing the wall. “All that time, I didn’t realise I was pining for you.”
Harry was silent for a few more moments before realisation washed over him. Malfoy wasn’t able to have sex with his own wife.
The hours felt like days to Draco. He was unable to eat, even drinking water had his stomach churning. Everything he had been doing for the past few years was about to come into action, all the evidence used against his father. And now, his father would be gone. Possibly forever.
Malfoy sharply turned a corner and Harry followed. This was a section of Malfoy Manor he had never been allowed to before. There were certain rooms the staff were allowed in, and there were forbidden places too. Bedrooms were a no, unless specifically asked. Harry knew Hermione had been in Astoria’s bedroom, as Hermione and Astoria seemed quite friendly with each other. It was because of their values, Harry thought, since Hermione was a Muggleborn but also one of the smartest and most successful witches of this age. Astoria deeply admired that and seemed to dislike the fact that Hermione worked for her. Though, this didn’t stop her from being harsh on Hermione when the time was right.
“Do it, Draco,” hissed Lucius from behind. It took Malfoy a few more moments, staring at the Squib, who was desperately shaking his head, attempting to beg for forgiveness as the gag muffled his words. Then, Malfoy closed his eyes, swallowing harshly.
“Well, you’re not. You’re just my butler. That’s all you are. That’s all you can be. And that’s all you will be.”
“I meant it, you know,” mumbled Malfoy as he stood up. “When I said you make me feel safe. I think, after all this time, you’re the only person who has made me feel safe.”
“It’s okay. I hate that he has missed out on so much, and so little, such as the sunrise. But I feel him here with me all the time. As if us being twins made us connected even after death. It’s as though he’s looking through my eyes, watching the sun with me, experiencing life with me.”
“It’s a long story,” mumbled Harry, looking down at his lap. With a squeeze of his hand, Mrs Weasley ushered him to tell her.
“He’s been taking it out on the staff, Harry,” said Hermione, obviously trying to not worry Harry, but of course he was going to worry. “And Malfoy.”
“I have an artefact,” replied Draco, walking confidently over to the counter and putting his hand in his pocket. Draco always made sure to walk with his chin in the air and taking big, long strides. Even in situations he feared the most, he never wanted to look weak. He’d done enough of that in his days at Hogwarts. Though he was known as the school’s bully, he was just as notorious for being a wimp. Every time something mildly frightening happened, he’d get Crabbe and Goyle to sort it out for him, or he’d run away.
“So’s Narcissa. I almost prefer working for her than Draco,” laughed Harry as he ran his hands through his hair.
“If you don’t stop misbehaving, you won’t get any pudding,” Mr Weasley grinned at the kids. “And today it’s grandma’s famous chocolate cake.” The kids instantly stopped messing about. Mr Weasley knew how much those two loved Mrs Weasley’s chocolate cake. Hermione looked at him gratefully.
Harry’s heart dropped. Surely Astoria had thought of a good enough excuse to cover for them? Or did she tell him the truth out of spite? No, Harry thought, she was far too sweet to do anything like that. Besides, it was obvious Harry was with Malfoy last night, both disappeared while the party was still ongoing.
Malfoy had gotten angry once again at his father, but this time for not allowing Harry to be his bodyguard anymore. Malfoy was now too scared to leave the manor, in case those men were around waiting for him.
“What’s wrong? You gonna be sick?” hiccupped Harry as he sat up too, placing a hand on the lower of Malfoy’s back gently, just in case. Shaking his head, Malfoy turned his head to face Harry.
Malfoy’s lips pressed together as he thought carefully about what to say next. “Sit down,” he instructed.
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing here?” asked Mrs Weasley, holding him at arm’s length. Her eyes were always kind, looking at Harry as if he were her own son. She was constantly inviting, extremely easy to talk to about any issue Harry was having.
“George tried to kill himself,” Ron had just about managed to cry out. Harry still remembers what he felt when he heard those words. Cold, as if his blood had turned to ice, his entire body tingling with pins and needles. His stomach had churned, he didn’t know whether he was going to be sick or pass out. This was all his fault, he remembered himself thinking, this was all his fault.
“Malfoy?” said Harry in a shocked tone, suddenly embarrassed he hadn’t put on a shirt. Malfoy’s cheeks went pink, too, as he looked away respectfully.
Harry poured a glass of water for Draco and placed it beside them before giving his back another gentle rub, then walked away to allow them some privacy. Harry knew from experience how comforting Mrs Weasley’s hugs could be. Her grasp was always warm and tight, and for those few moments it felt as if nothing could harm you.
“You’re bleeding, Malfoy,” Ron chimed in. Malfoy looked down at his hands, his eyes wide. It was as if he hadn’t even noticed. Slowly he nodded his head, not wanting to seem weak in front of the couple but knowing he couldn’t have his hands looking like this as he ran errands. Hermione rushed to her kitchen to get some bandages. Malfoy just stood, staring at the floor. Whatever Lucius was getting him to do seemed to be causing him severe distress, Harry noticed. Much to their surprise, he allowed Hermione to dress his wounds.
“Oh, but everyone wanted to date you,” said Harry. “You were one of the most popular boys in the whole school. Every girl swooned when they saw you,” he almost seemed irritated to say that, Malfoy thought.
As Harry’s thumb started to move across Malfoy’s hand, he felt raised skin. He pulled the hand closer to his face so he could see. There were scars slicing across his hand, down to his wrist and up to his fingertips.
“I think maybe it’s best we think about changing your position,” Malfoy said, his smile quickly fading and his eyebrows furrowing into a frown. “I need someone with as quick reflexes as yours to be somewhat of a bodyguard for me.”
“You should’ve seen it before,” laughed Harry, sitting on his bed, which creaked with every movement. He kept it underneath the window, though it was at an awkward angle, just in case another storm brewed, and he could watch it, imagining that Malfoy was watching it, too.
They continued along the cobblestone pathways; Malfoy was walking slower than his usual pace. He was taking everything in. The air felt clean and fresh, the gentle damp smell of recent rain entered his senses every time he took in a breath. Everything felt so bright and happy, especially compared to the Wizarding World. The air there was musky, the streets always appeared dark and dismal. Especially after Malfoy’s father had been put in charge.
“Oh, so now I’m losing my helper!” shouted Mrs Weasley as Ron dragged Harry away, making the two boys laugh. Harry’s laughing stopped as soon as he walked into the room though. There sat George, glass of whiskey in his hand, opposite to Mr Weasley. He looked skinnier than Harry had ever seen him, ginger hair a mess, dark circles under his eyes.
“Our relationship fizzled,” he admitted. “We both hardly ever saw each other, and we wanted different things, I guess,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.
“We have that though, don’t we?” said Harry, suddenly lost in thought. “Remember during the battle? He stopped me from being turned over to the Dark Lord, then I stopped him from burning in the room of requirement.”
“I’ll think of something, Potter. Now go to your room. I never want this to happen again, do you understand me?” And with that, Astoria dragged Malfoy to his bedroom. Harry stood there, watching them go. The jealousy was back. It should be him helping Malfoy to his room, him tucking him into the bed, him giving Malfoy a gentle kiss on the forehead to say goodnight.
As he stepped, he noticed a note on his floor. The pain was immense as he bent down to pick it up, but it was no match to the sudden queasy feeling in his stomach as he read the note.
Harry could never get used to it when he wasn’t in control. Especially when it was sprung upon him. He had been apparating for years now, but every time Malfoy made him do it, his stomach would churn, and he’d be confused and dizzy for the first few moments.
“My chest,” wheezed Draco, his eyes attempting to stay open but failing. Quickly, Harry pulled off Draco’s shirt, to reveal his thin body. Stuck in his chest were little black pins, about twenty of them. Surrounding those was a grey pattern, which almost looked like cobwebs tattooed onto Draco’s skin. They were getting darker and spreading.
“I politely disagree,” said Malfoy, and that was the end of that conversation. They continued walking through the manor until they reached Malfoy’s office. For a while, Malfoy rummaged through some papers until he pulled out a guide to English towns and flicked it open, looking for a certain page.
, it’s a classic,” said Harry, taking the book from Malfoy’s hands and putting it back down on his nightstand.
“What are you going to tell him?” asked Harry nervously. Astoria shot a look at him, there was worry in her eyes.
As he opened his eyes, Harry felt the throbbing pain shoot through his head. The room spun around him as he attempted to sit up, his entire body swaying to the side as he did so. This hangover was the worst he’d had in a long time.
Though, Harry didn’t need to wonder. Because miles away, in the comfort of his candle lit bedroom, Draco sat on his window seat, knees pulled to his chest. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he watched the storm that was just as strong above the manor, remembering the time he danced in the rain with Harry.
