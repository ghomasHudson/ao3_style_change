Harry felt his cheeks heat up. “I came to make sure you were alright. You got hit by a Bludger during our match.”
“Oh, god, don’t get her started again,” Granger laughed, pulling Harry into a hug. “Last time we got home from here she asked everybody we passed on the street that.”
He gave Colin what he hoped was a comforting pat on the shoulder, got up, and began walking towards the Slytherin table, feeling quite tempted to make a run for the door instead.
“I like to pack light,” Harry retorted, giving Malfoy’s enormous suitcase a meaningful look.
Draco’s eyebrow twitched and then he turned and strode out of the room. “Hang on, where are you going?” Harry called after him but it was no use. He sighed and went after him.
He couldn’t wrap his head around Malfoy’s complete disregard for him. It was rude and disrespectful. He took a big bite of toast. Yeah, disrespectful, that was the word for it.
“Harry.” She put the phone down and looked at him carefully. “When we were together, we had a four hour long fight when I suggested that you get a new television because yours is from approximately the 1740s. Now you’re telling me that you just went out and bought a mobile phone because it was a good idea?”
Once they were safely back on their feet Malfoy let him go and began to walk towards the bed, unbuttoning his shirt. Harry was only a little bit embarrassed to find himself following like a dog to a treat. He reached Malfoy before he got to the bed and finished the job of undoing his shirt. Harry admired the way the moonlight from the window danced across his pale, glitter-covered skin. He looked like something from another world.
a lie and so Harry felt a little bit less guilty, despite Ron’s crestfallen expression.
When they landed Harry was determined to shake Malfoy’s hand regardless of how he felt about the loss. As he approached, Malfoy looked up. His hair was dark with sweat and he was smirking, mouthguard hanging from the corner of his mouth.
He dropped. And, because their shoulders were pressed together, Harry slowed down. He turned before he could think better of it to see what had happened but the air where Malfoy had been seconds before was empty. He whipped his head back, trying to locate the Snitch again, and found Malfoy hovering in front of him.
Everyone had gone to bed or out to dinner, so Harry and Draco went back to the field they had been training in just outside the city. The fading light cast long shadows around them.
“By the power vested in me by the Department of Magical Games and Sports, I proclaim Lochinvar Quidditch Academy open for business.”
“We’re not really, just roommates,” he said. His palms prickled uncomfortably and he pressed them onto his thighs.
“You weren’t exactly a basket of Kneazles yourself, and I have the scars to prove it.”
Harry thought it was pretty self-explanatory. “Kissing you,” he replied, patiently.
“Ugh, that’s foul.” He made a face, and Harry quickly passed him the glass of water from the bedside table. Draco gave him a grateful smile. “Wait a moment - were you saying something about Pansy before I came around or did I dream that?”
“Potter?” he heard Malfoy say from very far away.
Malfoy’s face was unreadable. He seemed to be holding his breath. Fuck it, Harry thought recklessly and used the hand that was still in Malfoy’s hair to tug his head to the side, giving him access to his throat. Malfoy made another noise that made Harry feel lightheaded, but he concentrated on lavishing the same attention he’d just received onto Malfoy’s neck.
This was proven when, a moment later, they watched as a very shaky looking boy who couldn’t have been a day over seventeen mounted his broom and launched into the game. He looked about the same age as Coote, but he had none of his natural confidence on the broom and looked so nervous Harry was worried he might just fall off.
“Shit,” Angelina muttered.
Harry laughed. “That sounds like the Molly Weasley I know. Do you need anything from me?”
They were both speeding up now, gasping more than kissing into each other's mouths. It was filthy and ridiculous and they were both still wearing their pants. Harry knew he wasn’t going to last long, and by the sounds Malfoy was making, he wasn’t going to either.
She raised her eyebrows. “I didn’t know you two were so friendly?”
“You?” Ginny stared at him in astonishment. “You bought a mobile phone?”
He missed getting snarky little texts from him after he won or lost a game, he missed the sound of Draco’s voice at the other end of the phone, he even missed his (usually unsolicited) advice and criticism on Harry’s playing. The worst part was that Harry had a horrible feeling that he’d created this situation for himself. He had been the one who’d suggested they take a break. He was the one who had prioritised his job over their relationship.
“I’m fine. Happy?” Draco's voice was carefully blank. “I’m sorry for not replying to your text but this is exactly what I didn’t want, Potter. I don’t need the stress.”
He hit send before he could chicken out and lay back down, trying to still his heart rate. After a few seconds, he sat up to check if there had been a reply and almost dropped the phone when it began to ring.
“A Weasley jumper? Sweet fucking Merlin, Potter.” Malfoy sounded exasperated. The rumble that had been in his voice a second ago was gone. Harry could tell he’d said something wrong, but didn’t know what.
Thursday arrived and Harry was genuinely looking forward to going to the Pickle and Pumpkin, right up to the moment he got to the front door. It wasn’t that he was scared to see his friends, necessarily. He just couldn’t stop imagining himself walking into the pub and everyone staring at him, laughing at him, judging him and every move he made. He could feel that familiar panic rising in his throat like vomit. Just as he was about to turn and leave he felt a large hand land on his shoulder.
“Resting,” Malfoy said flatly.
“Drink this, you look like death warmed up,” she instructed cheerfully.
“I don’t know.” He tugged at his sleeve. “We were never together, so how could we have broken up?”
“Aha! Here it is.” She passed him a letter.
Harry was passing the gym on his way to the showers when he caught sight of a familiar blond head in the mirror. He doubled back and stuck his head through the door. Malfoy was on the rowing machine facing away from Harry. He was wearing a grey workout t-shirt that was stained dark with sweat. His arms and the back of his neck glistened, and the hair at the nape was dark and slightly curled. He was working slowly but powerfully, pulling and releasing the cord with tight control that made Harry’s mouth dry.
“A pact?”
The crowd did, though.
Harry’s heart sank,
A note about the game of Quidditch: It makes no sense and I have done my best to rectify this but have probably just made it worse, so try not to overthink it!
“Of course I will.” Harry extracted himself with some difficulty and escaped, vaguely aware of the filthy look Pansy sent after him.
“Merlin, she’s incredible,” Ginny sighed from the general location of his elbow.
“Yeah.” Harry felt lightheaded with panic.
Harry blinked. “Really?”
a lie.
“I won’t tell anyone.” Harry managed to croak, hoping that it would relieve some of the tension in Malfoy’s shoulders. It seemed to have the opposite effect, however, as the blond boy’s face hardened and he narrowed those steely eyes.
“Oh, really?” Harry asked, his throat felt oddly tight.
Pansy narrowed her eyes, examining his face as if looking for some trace of deception, finally she closed them for a long moment, looking pained. “I can’t believe I’m going to tell you this. He would murder me if he knew.” She opened her eyes again and glared at him. “I’m choosing to trust in your Gryffindor honour or whatever because this seems like the only way to get you to leave him alone.”
“Told you,” Draco sniggered.
Harry snorted in disbelief - that was understating it a bit. He knew he should stop reading for the sake of his sanity but his curiosity got the better of him.
“By the way,” he spoke suddenly, breaking Harry’s reverie. “If I oversleep tomorrow, I will blame you entirely.” He sighed and bumped their shoulders together.
“I saw you talking to the medic.”
“Seriously,” he said. “What’s going on?”
“No.”
The cafe wasn’t busy so Harry got his tea and toast quickly. He took up residence at a table in the back corner where he could watch the eccentrically dressed patrons come and go. It would have been a pleasant way to spend the night if he hadn’t still been thrumming with rage.
He leant back in his bunk and rested his head against the wall behind him. When he and Ginny had broken up it had felt almost like a death. He had been mourning everything that he’d thought they would have: a wedding, children, a life together. He’d felt like his future was empty and vast with nothing anchoring him or guiding him. This was nothing like that, because Harry had never really considered what a future with Draco could look like. Instead, he missed Draco himself, and it hurt even more - which was not something Harry had thought possible.
Harry was sitting at the bar in the hotel drowning his sorrows but he didn’t need to turn around to know who that accented voice belonged to.
The biggest thank you ever to my wonderful friends for your unwavering support, but particularly to Lucy for getting me drunk and making me send her the first draft and, then spending months editing it for me. You are the best flatmate in the world and I am unbelievably grateful to know you!
There were groans from the team as they headed off to the showers. As Harry trudged past Davies he felt a hand on his arm.
She wet her lips, “What then do you have to say of the rumours about clandestine nighttime meetings between Mr Malfoy and Ms Weasley?”
“Actually, I can.” Harry couldn’t quite bring himself to look at him, Pansy’s words buzzing annoyingly in his head. He cast them aside as best he could. “I just won the League Cup, remember? I’ve got two weeks off. Plus I’ve been through this recovery before. I know how much help you need.”
“That achievement was a credit to you all, but it’s no good if we don’t maintain it, so I want you to take these next few games seriously. All the teams are gearing up for the World Cup qualifiers next year, so they’ll be trying to show off their best players hoping they’ll get picked. I’ve heard a few rumours about teams trying to get players back from America and Europe. They will be fighting tooth and nail for every point and we need to be ready. That means no distractions: you're not going on dates, you're not going out drinking, you’re working yourself to the brink of death on the pitch and then getting an early night, got it?” Davies glared at them one by one until they all nodded their agreement. “Wonderful. Now you can go and get changed, and then our fearless leader will be giving us a lengthy talk about the new uniforms or something.”
Kreacher made a noise of disapproval and slunk back out of the room.
Despite his protests, Harry followed Draco to the far edge of the outcrop where a small path led down to the stoney loch’s edge. The water was clear but it didn't appear overly inviting.
“Well, firstly, she’d be the one doing the popping out,” Harry laughed. “And yes, that was the plan, for a while anyway.”
Draco blinked at him, wide-eyed, but didn’t say anything.
“Mate,” Ron sounded slightly like he was choking. Harry wished he would.
which caused Harry to jump so hard he nearly toppled off his perch on the toilet seat, as Filch kicked one of the cubicle doors open. Malfoy moved with lightning speed, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist in a vice-like grip, and clamping his other hand over Harry’s mouth to muffle his squeak of surprise.
Harry rolled his eyes, a little embarrassed. “I didn’t eat anything last night, okay?”
They stood in front of the large stone arch in front of the training pitch, a thick red ribbon strung across it. Draco could feel Harry’s stress rolling off him, so he reached out and gripped his hand. “It’s time,” he murmured. Harry nodded. They held out their wands and together drew them up and then down, severing the ribbon with a swoosh.
Hermione who is dressed in navy-blue Ministry robes, her hair shorter than she used to wear it but just as curly, her eyes brown and warm like a doe’s but also almost too sharp and wise for her age. Familiar like the back of his hand.
It’s been three days since Draco and I returned home from St Mungo’s and three days since I confessed everything to him over the breakfast cereal. I am persona non grata and don’t deserve any better.
“You can talk to me about anything, Draco,” Harry reassured him. Despite himself, he felt a bit nervous as well, unsure of what to expect. Instead of indulging in this unfruitful nervousness, he focused on his breathing, making his mind ready to help Draco, whatever the matter might be.
Draco poked his finger on the front of the newspaper and parroted the words that Cormac had used so many weeks ago. “She was asking for it,” Draco said. “Looking for attention. Drunk and promiscuous. She shouldn’t have gone back to his hotel if she didn’t want sex.”
The deal is, though, I am not a daft or inept wizard. Starting from that moment that I spurred him on so urgently, I felt an innate magic stream through the both of us. I was too much into it to stop myself at first, I thought it was naught but my own magic acting up accidentally. But I’m certain that I felt his magic too. It felt warm and powerful. Like he was touching me everywhere, all at once. Perhaps I’m romanticising a little bit, but I felt completely veiled in that feeling. And very much the same, I felt something from me reach out to James. I do believe that, in the very proverbial sense of it, we became one. I feel like a
Harry didn’t reply. Instead, he raised the Mojito to his lips and took a sip. He winced, and put it back down onto the wood with the tiniest click.
Draco had come here for sex, not to duel, but what was happening was starting to feel adversarial.
- Harry takes a deep breath and rubs his eyes under his glasses just so he doesn't have to see Draco’s disappointment anymore.
I had spent the whole day wondering what that bloke might request from me, but slowly it dawned in me that he probably wanted exactly what I had called it before. A date. A nice date where we would enjoy ourselves, and that would without any doubt lead to sex.
It feels cruel. Unjust.
It’d been sex,
Draco looks tired, but there’s a resigned smile on his face that makes Harry feel like shit. “But I hurt your feelings. No matter the reason, I didn’t mean to do that. And that’s what I’m sorry for.”
Most people running in my circles these days are so casual, and yet I still join the breakfast table dressed in buttoned-up shirts and robes. Apropos of clothes, the Muggle jeans I usually wear don’t fit anymore, so I’ve taken to trousers again. I suppose I will need some better fitting clothes soon enough.
Harry allows Draco’s ministrations, the both of them quiet. As the razor and Draco’s fingers card through his beard, Harry’s mind drifts to the days ahead that will be filled with family visits. It might turn out to be like Christmas—
“No need to apologise,” Draco says, sounding just as composed as he looks. “Do you need some water? Can I do anything?”
He’s not sure how much he wants to hear, but Draco carries on anyway. “I found you in the bathroom where you . . . let’s say your magic possibly got out of control, just a tad. And when I came in, you shot a hex at me, I shielded myself and told you to keep it together before the Ministry caught wind of the ruckus, and then you tried to kiss me instead.”
Draco said, thinking how awful it’d be if Draco thought the great Harry Potter something special. “You know, I’m just a bloke though. Please, just- don’t bring up this whole Chosen-One-nonsense, okay? It’s part of why I left, and I can’t- I just can’t take it.”
The panic of his short breath increases with the nauseating belly-pull of the jump when Harry Disapparates.
“Then there’s no time like the present,” the Healer answered, stepping towards the door. “I’d like us to get started as soon as possible with a direct influx of your magic. The sooner we can get Draco’s magic up to a safe level, the better for everyone. It’s truly unfortunate that you weren’t honest before. Today could have been avoided.”
Into the night they went in mutual, non-spoken agreement. All that existed was dewy grass catching on ankles, the earthy scent mixing with the last streaks of sulphur and blood wafting over from the castle in the distance, a few towers prominent only with the absence of stars. Harry remembers thinking that, actually, on principle, he ought to have been pissed at Malfoy, annoyed that, somehow, he’s always there. But he wasn’t. Not annoyed, not angry, not happy. He didn’t feel a thing while walking with the bloke who, historically, had the capability of making Harry be livid with a single look or the cadence of his voice. He also remembers thinking that, perhaps, he had really died that morning. Perhaps that’s what it feels like to be a ghost, though why he would have decided to stay for such a life, Harry wasn’t sure. Did he misunderstand his options?
Something about his statement seems to please Draco. His smile is suave as he pulls Harry closer. “Because you are.”
.” Harry takes a look around, taking in the nicely dressed people with their bleached teeth and coiffed hair and their obnoxious laughter. The sight makes his lips curl with a disgust that has been lingering in his chest but that he didn’t perceive before. “Why would I want to become part of such a superficial bunch of self-absorbed idiots?” he spits, feeling like he’s had enough of it all.
Fitzgerald had stolen the person that Draco used to be.
trails along the street, light as a feather but unmistakably magic.
Three days later Harry accompanied Draco once again, but this time it was to Harry’s workplace, to the grey offices of the DMLE.
Draco fumbled for his wand, and held it in front of him with a trembling hand. He wouldn’t be a victim again. “Give me your wand,” Draco asked, holding out his other hand. He hardly dared to move or breathe. “Do it now, Potter or I’ll hurt you, I swear to Merlin. I mean it.”
That was the scene that Draco walked into when he stepped through the fireplace. I sat, my empty teacup still in my hand, my clothes stained and sopping wet, while Andi and Teddy looked at me, the pair of them both visibly aghast and wondering how I'd become such a dunderhead. Draco had his wand out in seconds, Vanishing away the Floo powder that had fallen from him onto Andi’s carpet.
I will get this tension out of my shoulders, do some Occlumency to free my mind. Then I will unlock the door and call Potter in to infuse me with some of his magic because I feel queasy again now.
We made love three times, and I do believe that James Evan’s beautiful cock did the trick for Draco. Maybe I’m not the most experienced or proficient lover – most of my dates don’t get as far as the bedroom – but what I lack in sophistication, I hope I made up for in enthusiasm.
Harry considered this. It definitely had an element of truth to it, he had to admit. “So I could have had loads of crushes on blokes without knowing about it?”
“Here,” Malfoy said, offering Harry a slip of parchment with a series of numbers scribbled on it. “It’s a mobile telephone number.” He waved it impatiently when Harry looked nonplussed. “You do have a telephone, don’t you?”
“Do you really believe that a relationship can only be legitimate if all the lewd details are trotted out for the general public? Because I have no interest in that,” Draco snapped back.
The following day, Harry made even more of an effort to be friendly. He got up at the same time as Malfoy, even though it pained him, because he found that being nice was much easier before Malfoy put on his carefully curated armour for the day. Throughout the day he made an effort to make conversation whenever he could, even if it was a bit stilted on Malfoy’s end. He even sat with him at lunch again, and this time Oliver, Angelina and Ginny joined them, much to Malfoy’s confusion. Harry had half expected a fight or another interrogation, but instead, he just ate his lunch, watching them warily.
When they’d recovered themselves a little, Harry looked at them and felt affection swell up in his chest. “I really am happy for you two. This is really, really exciting.”
Hours later, they lay side by side on their backs on a large rock, catching their breaths. The stone was still warm from baking in the hot Australian sun all day and that warmth seeped through Harry’s shirt. They weren’t touching but their shoulders were so close that if they both inhaled at the same time they would brush together. Harry tried to focus on the wide expanse of sky above their heads. It seemed bigger here somehow, and closer. In London, you couldn’t even see the stars, and at Hogwarts they always seemed miles and miles away but here it almost felt like if he reached his arm out he could pluck one directly from the sky.
“Then what is it?” Draco’s voice was still even but his eyes flashed.
“He altered the numbers to make it look like he won, because he’s a sore loser,” Malfoy spat.
“I want to go for a swim,” Draco announced abruptly.
Ron’s brow furrowed and he seemed to consider his question for a moment. Harry was struck with a sudden rush of affection for his best mate. He was so out of his element but he was really, really trying.
“Is that all you have to say?” he asked, eyebrows raised.
“You thought it would be a good idea,” she repeated, eyebrows raised.
“Probably not?” Malfoy asked, and Harry knew he was being goaded into sharing but he found that he didn’t mind. It would be nice to talk about it with someone who wasn’t Ginny’s sister or friend.
“The other side is better,” Draco said, watching him in amusement.
He found a rather emotional Hermione on the second floor, in Charlie's old room, having her makeup fussed with by Ginny, Padma and Mrs Granger.
Harry felt his face heat up. “Oh, god, don’t remind me. I’m sorry about that.” He took a large swig of beer to cover his embarrassment. Krum laughed loudly and clapped him on the shoulder.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Calm down, I was just checking on the set-up down by the pitch. Besides, I thought you liked these shorts on me?” He waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
Harry was astonished to hear the affection in Malfoy’s voice, and Una beamed at him.
Shockingly, there was no resistance because everyone looked too surprised to protest - Ginny had that effect sometimes. Once the room had cleared, Ginny marched over to the bar in the corner and poured two large glasses of white wine. She gave one to Hermione and took a big swig herself.
Malfoy turned around, triumphantly holding a bottle of bubbles. “Perfect.”
“We can- Let’s have some.” Malfoy gets a small bag of powder out of his jeans pocket—his

had called their food ‘the most delectable in the wizarding world’, it seemed like the only subject on anyone’s lips.
Pansy was dressed to the nines in a striking crushed velvet number and was frantically arranging, and subsequently rearranging, the various plates of nibbles that the Parkinson elves had prepared for the occasion. Pansy’s pretty face broke into a wide happy smile as she took in Draco’s appearance.
“Time to go, I believe,” Draco responded hastily. “Mother will have my hide if I’m late for her soirée. You know how she gets, Pans. There’d be Howlers flying down the chimney before we knew where we were.”
“Let’s see . . . That man across.” Carol subtly nods her chin towards a very handsome man with perfectly styled hair and a casual looking suit that makes Harry wish that he had dressed better this evening. He wants to get the bloke out of the jacket, wants to get him out of all his clothing for that matter.
"The point is that you
“I want to go home,” Draco whispered, weak and incoherent, and
“Tell me what you want me to do,” I said, taking it a bit slower. I massaged his shoulders and his nape, ran my fingers through his hair, and he seemed to enjoy that more than going straight for the BJ. So much so that he didn’t answer in a while.
Harry hums in response, eyes on a tiddly spot of spilled paint. “Draco? How will you pay me?”
Draco didn't even have time to draw breath before he felt the other wizard push him down onto the quilt. Fitzgerald crawled straight on top of him. His erection was massive in his trousers, and he ground himself hard against Draco’s jeans. Draco would have dearly loved to respond in kind, but he found that he could scarcely move.
“You know that I love you, right?” Draco said.
When Harry sits back up, Draco seems to rediscover the necessity of breathing. He frees his face of some wayward strands of hair and tears, drawing in sudden breaths that jolt his tense shoulders. “This- Circe, but you’re bloody intense.”
Draco let Fitzgerald wank him to an orgasm that was automatic and perfunctory, his body responding without any input from his brain. With it came an awareness of relief. It’d been sex, and nothing more. Yes, it’d been awful, rough
he is, and maybe Malfoy cursed him into another dimension or made him the prisoner of his own imagination or-
Harry talked to Jules at the Phoenix about his paternal leave. And even more than that. Harry and I have talked a bit about the next few years and mused how things will be. I obviously have more free time at hand, no matter whether I work or not (more on that later), but Harry hates the idea of working all the week, sometimes even Saturdays, and not having a chance to be with the plum all the time.
Draco bolted for the exit. He needed to be gone, and away from the party. He needed to be away from Fitzgerald and away from the constant terror and anger that coursed through him every moment of the day. Even an
, right, Johnny?” Harry laughs along, admiring the wiry frame of the man he ended up in bed with, still wondering how the sex has been.
Draco highly doubted that. “What do I owe you?” Draco asked, taking out his wallet with fumbling fingers. “That was a bottle of the ’98 Ogden’s wasn’t it, and-”
“Like, full-on sleep with each other?” Harry asked pointlessly, because he had never done as much as touch Draco’s prick before. But Draco nodded, determinedly taking Harry’s hand and leading him up into their bedroom.
But I got exactly the reaction I was looking to find. A soft little whimper, muffled by our kiss, when I squeezed his bum. After the sound, though, I felt his posture stiffen a bit, and he wanted to lean out of the kiss. I didn’t let him though. I couldn’t abide the idea that the kiss would end like this. So I whispered, “Let’s get more comfortable…,” and I guided him to the bed, feeling endlessly nervous that he would reject me once we broke the kiss; that he would come to his senses. But Potter let it happen.
Andromeda’s home is similar enough that Harry recognises the drawing room, but the seating has changed and there’s a wall with a multitude of picture frames hanging upon it. Many of them depict Teddy, some of them show Tonks and Remus, others are with Draco. On three of them Harry finds himself with shorter hair, looking oddly young.
Draco
And now it’s too late to go back.
The evening is spent in a restaurant with loose enough drug policies if you ordered enough champagne alongside several courses of fancy food, and Harry is glad that he sits next to Carol because she is one of the few he has ran in the same circles with now for a while, someone with a life, someone with a
I’m going to write something here, only because I know that nobody else will ever read it. I’m angry with all the other men that Draco has fucked for money.
“Is he gay?” Harry asks bluntly.
,” Teddy confessed, so quiet and in between laughter that Harry almost missed it. But when Draco and Harry looked at him, Draco already saying Teddy’s name with a sense of comfort and wariness, Teddy thinned his lips and squared his chest, and he said, “
“You know, I’ve never been in a bloke’s bedroom twice before fucking him,” Harry says, laughing as they climb the stairs, and he almost regrets it because Draco only makes a little noise in response at first.
I manoeuvred us over to the bed when I dreaded that sucking me might get too monotonous for him. I had to keep in mind that the night was about him, and his needs and wishes. That he wanted me was such a good preamble, but I also wanted to make him feel like he was having the fuck of his life.
“Exquisite choices,” he mocks. “Coke. I have work tomorrow.”
Draco went after his conquests like a Seeker chasing down the Snitch, or a Niffler hunting gold. Maybe he wasn’t subtle, but Draco’s techniques usually worked. He wasn’t coy about getting what he wanted.
Draco looks at him, agitated, and Harry nods at him and  hopes he might look reassuring. “He, You-Know-Who. The first time I saw him was during Yuletide in the hols in fifth year.”
“It’s about showing affection,” he goes on, locking eyes with Harry, and Harry finds that he couldn’t agree more. “It’s that they don’t take their time to actually listen to me. See, when I was fourteen, complaining-“ He stops, giving a staccato of hoarse, mirthless laughter. “I was fourteen.
Draco was so beautifully receptive. His orgasm built so speedily within him, and it was all Draco could do to give me fair warning that it was there with a loud gasp. I never let up until Draco was wrung out and entirely satisfied. My wild hair was completely saturated as I pulled off Draco’s softening prick and planted a final, loving kiss on the widest part of Draco’s belly.
“You should . . . keep it down a little. At least a little. Look, it’s not like I would judge—obviously, I’m in no place to judge—but you look . . .”
He was just about to suggest that he could fellate Fitzgerald when he felt himself being walked the two steps backwards towards the bed.
“I’m not trying to save you,” Harry answered, his voice calm in comparison to Draco’s own. “I’m your friend, and I’m worried about you. I know something has changed, something fundamental, and I care about you. Let me in, Draco. Please let me help you.”
Andi, Narcissa and Teddy were waiting, replete with flowers, presents and baby clothes in the tiniest sizes. There were more tears then, and much cooing and hugging. Teddy wasn’t impressed with you, Cassiopeia. I believe that he thought he’d be able to play with you straightaway. “
. To the men’s. To the food buffet and a conversation about buying celebs’ addresses off of managers. To throwing his plate at the bitch, perhaps, accidentally, followed by a wandless hex. A shock of white hair. To appalled gasps and the sounds of chairs scraping over polished hardwood floorboards. Back to the men’s, hands on porcelain, panting. To grey eyes in the mirror.
Draco nods enthusiastically, his eyes so vulnerable and so grey; grey like a downpour above the North Sea. “It’s just- it’s been a while that I’ve had a nice talk and it’s you- I can’t believe it’s
no,” Draco answered, assuming a pose of indifference. He hated lying, but there was no choice. He’d have to think of another one. “Harry had been far too busy, pulling double shifts at Ollivanders,” he said. “Those wands don’t make themselves. Besides, whyever should I bring him to chez Parkinson-Nott? The pair of you would give him a harder grilling than the sodding Wizengamot.”
And I told him just how good things are for me at the moment. That there’s not one thing I need to worry about, not even money. I think he understood very well that I’m okay. It’s just so hard to be brave and keep my smile on. When I see him like that. And on top of that, Azkaban just drains the last of the resolutions of mine to keep a straight face.
“I need to go,” Harry says.
And I’ll promise him that I won’t ever leave. I’m his family, just as much as the plum will be. And even though Harry hadn’t been lucky with his family in the past, I must hope that he’ll trust me that I will be there for him. No matter what.
“Only fourteen,” Harry finishes for him, feeling hot tears streaming down his face.
"Let me help you heal," Draco whispers, his hand a tender touch on Harry's side that makes him lean closer to Draco. “The past has been nothing but cruel to you.” He swallows. “To both of us. I want you to be with me, here and now, and to allow yourself to trust the calm. Be with me if you want me. I won’t go away, Potter, I promise.” Draco holds him as though he might vanish on the spot, close and with all his body. “The world would be quite a bleak place without you.”
After that, he told Draco that he doesn’t know how to talk about certain things, and that he’s darn right on the wand about the history books and the media only knowing half their stories because he can’t stop thinking about Voldemort showing up at Malfoy Manor during Draco’s Christmas hols in fifth year and whatever happened over the summer hols the year later when that Mark got branded into his arm.
The warmer months are the worst. Around the time that the sun grows warmer, and the chipper of birds wake him before sunup, a darkness seizes Harry from deep within, one that worsens with every memorial, every birthday, every deathday along the line.
Draco supposed that was a big part of the reason he hadn’t visited the Wizard’s Health Clinic at St Mungo’s. The days had bled into each other, the minutes wicking into hours and the hours into days. The four months allowed for male abortions had vanished as speedily as grains of sand through a timer.
Harry pauses. "Right now?"
Let me start this anew. When I was younger, I sometimes wished that Mother had something more to do than worry about my education and whether I’ve eaten enough or needed new clothes. And I had wished that Father had anything other to enjoy himself with than all the status symbols he entertained and collected and making sure my reputation was impeccable with the other pureblood families. If I can learn anything from that, it’s that my child will be happier if I make sure that
It felt right and natural that nothing happened between them that day. Their talk just opened the doors for a new topic that could be addressed again, every time now, whenever the both of them were in a good place. And when Harry, with a deep laugh rumbling through his chest, told Draco that he was in desperate need of a shower now after spending two full hours in a sweaty gym shirt, Draco asked whether it would be okay if Draco accompanied him. Not join him in the shower, but just be there in the bathroom with him.
Fitzgerald had taken what he believed Draco owed him. He’d fucked Draco’s limp, unresponsive body because he’d believed sex was on the table, and so he was going to take it, come what may.
Before they fucked that night, Draco hovered between Harry’s legs, taking his time to travel over the whole of Harry with his eyes and his fingers. And perhaps it was ruthless calculation on Draco’s side to choose the moment his pulsing cock was nudging Harry’s entrance, but he stopped, interrupting Harry’s breathy pleas for his prick with, “
Back to spreading the news to my friends. I had a very long chat with Astoria that ended with her Flooing over when I couldn’t kneel in front of the fireplace anymore. She and Harry got along rather splendidly. I think they haven’t really known each other before, but they share an incorrigible enthusiasm about biscuits.
And it turned out to be all worth it. Standing there once every year, standing on the same spot that might have been completely unmemorable to a stranger; merely the hint of a trail that crossed the dark greens and violets that would cover the lands if they met by day. Bracing himself for whichever shade of Draco Malfoy he’d get that night, surrounded by heathland between hills and hills, the hint of peaked towers somewhere in the distance. Harry recalls the smells of an earlier rain and soil, a stark contrast to the Auror Office he had left for the last time that day. He recalls thinking that the nervousness sparking in his guts possibly meant that he cared for Malfoy’s opinion on him.
His fingers are pinching the key, tucked into the lock to their apartment building. It’s tall and nondescript, flats occupied by students of this medium sized university town in Sweden. It’s busy, sometimes loud, and both blissfully anonymous and friendly greetings in the corridor all at once.
“How strange,” Harry pants much later, his head light from several hours of hypnotic, monotonous headbanging. His high is slowly starting to wear off but still prominent enough to make him restless as Tarquin and he run through the mostly deserted streets side by side. “I mean- Seeing John. It was strange.”
There’s a round little table with cosy chairs, sheltered in the corner of a hedge and vines overgrowing white-painted lattice. The plants are still green and lush, the summer prolonged in a way that made Harry expect the leaves to have changed colour everytime he sees a tree which is rare enough. It’s almost wholesome to let his gaze travel from one green tone to the next and to listen to the soft swish that catches in Draco’s maple tree.
Harry takes his glass from Draco, saying, “Don’t worry, I’m here.”
I made sure that he wouldn’t accidentally tip over the edge before we could get to the part where I would finally have the Golden Boy’s prick buried inside of me. Salazar, I sound like a fanboy even in my own ears. But that’s not it. I’ve been
Merlin, but I didn’t know what to say to that. There was so much I needed to unpick, and I needed to be alone. I pressed a small, chaste kiss onto Draco’s cheek and left him to get the sleep that he desperately needed.
arse,” that dolt.
Draco nods fiercely.
Fitzgerald shot him an ugly grin. “Your smart mouth, sucking my dick?” He laughed, and Draco didn’t like the sound of it anymore. “Tempting offer, but I’ve made plans for how I want this night to go.”  With that he slashed his wand through the air, and
The conversation is a bit stilted for a while, and Harry is only glad that he did a few grams back at Gringotts, perfectly aware how awful he would have felt otherwise. Even though his exhilarated mood is a bit tainted, he’s not feeling completely down. They’re mostly waiting for the high to kick in, exchanging only a few words until Draco puts on some music with a decisive flip of his wand.
Draco was seized by indecision.
Tarquin loves hearing arguments he hadn’t thought of before, Harry thinks. And Aanya—Jesus, Harry hopes the discussion isn't only interesting because he's on his second pill—but she has quite a lot of these interesting viewpoints on speciesism and the arrogant self-importance of the human race. He’ll find Tarquin and buy them another round. He should also get some water—he always forgets about water—and then they’d be all set for the entirety of this wonderfully mild night.
“None whatsoever,” I answered, my voice low and gruff. I was too ashamed to meet his gaze. My chest felt tight with my shame and fright. I’d put my own selfish needs in front of Draco, and our baby. I fully deserved this man’s condemnation.
to know you’re feeling poorly. Fuck, it quite frankly pains me whenever you’re not feeling on top of the world, you git.”
“There’s nothing to blab,” Draco said, the shame making his cheeks burn and sweat prickle beneath his armpits. “There’s no romantic clichés, Tee! No dreamy tale to tell the grandchildren about! It’s all a lie. None of this,” he said, gesturing to Harry and the classily dressed table, “is real.”
They shift higher on the bed until their heads are resting on the soft pillows, facing each other, both shirtless with their jeans on. Harry’s eyes are locked on Draco’s own.
“You’re back,” he says, his voice a whisper.
A group of people who he thinks he knows finds him only minutes later, invading him with slaps on his shoulders. “He saved this guy here—Trinh—who almost got himself killed with a grape,” a man exclaims, doubling over with laughter that’s somehow not sucked up in the round of general laughter and shouts and music. Harry holds his breath. “If anything, I’d have seen his fat arse kick the bucket with a good serve of Crispy Duck!”
“You’ll have to excuse me,” Draco said. “I need a moment. Just going to nip to the loo.”
“But what do you do all day?”
I know for a fact that he’d never, ever speak to me again.
keep it there. Keep you close.”
That was all the permission that Fitzgerald needed. Draco clutched the man’s thick biceps and felt the breathtaking squash as they were flung through space. The next thing Draco knew, he was standing in a very masculine, very sparse bedroom. It was very unlike Draco’s cluttered, busy room and for a half a moment, he wondered whether Fitzgerald had taken him back to an expensive hotel. A gigantic bed dominated the space, covered in upmarket blue silk sheets.
I felt my breath hitch: Draco’s magic felt like fingertips on my skin, and his action felt perilously close to erotic. I managed to croak out a greeting, though my voice sounded thick, throaty and entirely ludicrous. Luckily, neither Draco nor the rest of the company seemed to notice my very particular behaviour. Andi kissed Draco on the cheek in greeting, told him he looked more handsome every day, and left to rustle up some tea and biscuits.
“I forgot how nice Cushioning Charms are,” Harry says.
Draco looked over to where Harry was fiddling with his strange paper money at the till, and unfolded the Muggle newspaper that’d been left on the table by the previous occupants.
“Draco, are you alright? Do you need anything?” he asked through the closed door, and I couldn’t help but feel enraged by his bonhomie and his docile tone.
. He wears reindeer antlers on his head which remind Harry of the beginning of the Adventseason. “Harry,” he says, with a grin and oddly vulnerable eyes. “Mate,
Draco runs a finger along his eyebrows as he keeps on assessing himself in the mirror for another minute. When he turns to Harry, he eyes him with the same scrutiny and sighs. “You haven’t learnt any manners whatsoever, have you?”
A sigh, exasperated. "I guess that's correct."
Something about what I said seemed to awaken something in Draco, and he lifted his head, his grey eyes flashing with pure wrath.
Harry can’t help but smile, mesmerised by the view and the feel of magic washing over the table. “I'll have it like you’d take it,” Harry says, eager.
“Yes, Mrs Crabbe. She’s the client.”
But it’s useless. Those feelings—worry, care, fuck-
The first tunes of a song reverberate from the wireless in the corner, a female singer, managing to sound casually exhilarated and energetically sad with just the hint of a sneer to her voice, accompanied by strings and then a staccato piano, and Harry is instantaneously hooked. Again, he is surprised by just how appreciative Draco seems to be of Muggle culture. “What is this?” he asks.
Stuart Fitzgerald strode over, a broad smile decorating his face and Draco wondered if he was going to faint. His heart drummed a beat in his chest and he felt very lightheaded. All of a sudden, the lights were too bright and the chatter too loud.
Draco must’ve pulled a face. “Is it that bad?” Potter asks, his amused tone a mockery of what he truly sounds when amused. Nervous. There’s nervousness bubbling at the surface of Potter’s mind, and it pleads for him to be let out. Potter takes a breath and rings the doorbell when Draco doesn’t answer. He’s used to his silence.
Harry nods. He fancies that he sees Draco’s expression change, that he sees the way the idea seizes him with a bleak gravity. After a breath, it’s straightened out of the set of his shoulders and from his features. "I'm not talking about life plans though,” Draco says, levelled. “I mean
Draco came to a decision. He hadn’t spoken in a while, and in spite of his very stupid joke minutes before, he was very aware that Fitzgerald couldn’t tell what he was thinking. He needed to speak up.
“You’re a bastard,” was Draco’s opening gambit when he strode into the kitchen. “You’re an absolute fucking bastard, and I’m tired of your stupid games. I’m tired of being a stupid, naïve fool that keeps getting taken in by you Harry, a fool that keeps getting taken in, time after time.”
“That’s what I wanted to ask you.” Davies looked stern. “I know things haven’t been easy for you the past few years but we need you on top form this season. How’s that going?”
“Yes?”
Later at the bar, Angelina slid in next to Harry and shoved a pint into his hand.
Harry considered it for a moment. “I think so.”
Harry watched as they walked away from him towards the house with a feeling like the floor had just dropped out from under his feet.
Quite polite, Harry thought, considering how much he would have preferred to hex him. A few moments later the reply came on a new scrap of paper.
He opened his mouth to respond but before he could someone cleared their throat. Harry swivelled around and almost jumped out his skin when he saw Pansy Parkinson standing in the doorway.
Harry wanted to protest but water actually sounded excellent just then so he let her drag him over to the bar. Once he’d downed a glass of ice-cold water he told her he needed the bathroom and headed off in the direction he thought he remembered them being. Luckily for him, there wasn’t much of a line and he managed to get in and do his business quickly.
“I’m going to demonstrate. I want you to fly towards me like you’re going to start a chase, and then watch what I do very carefully.”
Draco blinked back at her. “Er,” he said, eloquently. “Well I’m not really… what I mean to say is…”
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, would you just shut up?” he snapped back.
Hermione’s hand froze for a second. “What do you mean?”
“You’re hilarious,” Harry said.
“Fair to who?” He asked.
His team landed and surrounded him in celebration but Harry could feel Davies’ anger following him and so made his escape as quickly as possible, skipping all the post-match celebrations entirely.
Harry huffed in annoyance. It was all very well for her to say that. “I’m going to the loo,” he said grumpily and stomped off in the direction of the mens room.
If possible, the photoshoot was even worse. The photographer was a very tall wizard with long stringy brown hair and a very large camera, who forced Harry into a series of increasingly humiliating and uncomfortable poses. Luckily he didn’t seem interested in making Harry get his kit off, but it was small mercy to him when he found himself pretending to kick a Quaffle.
Harry watched the loop over and over, growing increasingly annoyed with each repetition. It wasn’t fair that the
“Are you trying to kill England’s World Cup dreams again, Vik?” Charlie teased fondly, giving Harry a pat on the shoulder. Krum shrugged with a similarly smitten expression on his face. Harry looked from Charlie to Viktor and then back again.
He was crushing Draco into the mattress, but he wanted to be even closer. He wrapped one arm around the back of Draco’s neck and the other around his waist, burying his head in Draco’s neck, pushing in again and again.
“He could take him, Hermione! All you’d need to do is insult his robes and the greasy git would probably have a cry,” Ron snickered at his own joke. “It won’t be a real duel anyway if it’s just the two of you.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked warily.
They sniped at each other a few more times, and it seemed to rile the crowd up even more until they were a loud, boisterous mass. It was thrilling.
“I mean,” Harry summoned his courage. “What if this is it? It’s been a year since we split and we’re nowhere near getting back together. What if we’re better off apart?” He could see Hermione giving Ron a pointed look.
“Where’s Malfoy?” Harry blurted, feeling extremely uncomfortable.
“That’s alright, you just take a breather.” Ginny turned to Harry with a grin, and he felt a swell of affection for her. “She looks beautiful, doesn't she, best man?”
Harry’s mouth was so dry. Why was it so fucking dry? “Just want to have a quick word.”
“Draco Malfoy, come here you gorgeous bastard.” George shook their hands enthusiastically before slinging a long arm around Draco’s shoulders. “You know, Harry, you’d better get a ring on this man’s finger toot sweet. It isn’t safe to let someone so good-looking wander around unattached. Why do you think I locked Angie down as soon as possible?”
He was washing his hands when Malfoy came in.
“I…” Harry had to stop and think about this for a moment.
Harry thought about Charlie playing Quidditch in the backyard with the kids, his face flushed from the wind, his tattoos peeking out from under the sleeve of his t-shirt. He cleared his throat, embarrassed.
To his surprise, Draco actually picked up, but he didn’t sound thrilled about it. “What is it?” he snapped.
She shuffled in a bit closer, her other hand coming up to touch his shoulder. “You know, we’re not technically teammates anymore…”
He couldn’t even look at the rest of the team in the changing room during halftime. He just sat with his head between his knees, trying to focus on his breathing. He was so wrapped up in feeling sorry for himself that he didn’t hear Malfoy sit down next to him until he spoke.
Malfoy didn’t return to their room until it was practically morning, but Harry pretended to be asleep, wanting to delay the awkwardness as long as possible.
“Malfoy!” Harry interrupted in a slight panic. “I’m not a little kid. I know what… what you’re talking about.”
Surely other men’s didn’t look like that - Harry was pretty sure he would have noticed. It was toned and full and perfect, and it was attached to his perfect legs and his perfect back, and Harry genuinely hated him a little bit. Feeling self-conscious, he reached up and pulled a blanket off the bed and threw it over his legs.
“I’d think they’re used to that,” Draco presumes. “Granger is in the
So, yes. Back to today. Possibly one of the worst days of my life.
A part of Harry feels like objecting or at least relativizing this compliment, but he just shrugs and chugs down his lukewarm tea. He clears his throat. “So, Malfoy . . . Shall we?” he asks, his voice a little harsher than he meant it to be.
“Might not be as good as that toy, I’m afraid,” Draco murmurs with a hoarse voice. Despite his words, he’s already made the toy stop moving and spreads Harry’s arse cheeks to pull it out with ease.
I sat on the bed, thought of writing away my thoughts, but decided against it. Instead, I only stared at the wall, and my very helpful mind conveyed to me both the said and unsaid things that the Mediwizard had confronted me with.
While something about this rings true, the chaos of thoughts inside his brain doesn’t allow Harry to think about it too much. There are pictures of Dumbledore and the Dursleys randomly popping up in his consciousness. Half-remembered thoughts that might as well be dreams or wild hallucinations on alcohol and drugs. He remembers looking at a huge serving of chocolate ice-cream while suckling on a stale lemon icicle, his mouth watering with a sadness that he didn’t understand back then and understands only partly now.
“Draco!” Pansy exclaimed, leaning in to kiss his forehead before batting non-existent dust from his shoulders, “don’t you look an absolute peach! Potter will absolutely die a thousand deaths when he claps eyes on you! And knows where to come, doesn’t he? Merlin, but I expect the chap’s brain almost
He knows what he means. But he doesn’t like Draco to be this cryptic, not when it comes to them. “What do you mean, love?”
When I ground my crotch against his, he sucked in a desperate breath. I felt his prick growing harder with my movements, but James seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with everything. So instead of following my plans of starting to undress right there and then, I guided him to the bed and sat him down on it, straddled his lap and kept on kissing him.
a small amount,” Draco said mockingly, his lips curving into a sneer. “It was big enough when I didn’t have a home and both my parents were locked in a cell. It was big enough when I had to make choices between food and a place to sleep. That debt… That debt has been a big part of my bloody life, Harry!” Draco shook his head, the fury of his expression melting into something softer, something sadder. “And this is what you
That was another mistake.
think?”
, that’s what Draco calls it. Above the table, a portrait holds vigil. Most of the time the canvas is dark, with two armchairs barely visible in the dark paint, but sometimes Adelia and Dorea meet in it for tea. Harry and Draco have yet to find the respective homes of the talkative witches.
HE is supposed to be a saint! HE is supposed to do the right thing. I knew that Potter could lie, I don’t think he was that twee, but bloody hell. I know that I hold back a lot, but he must’ve known how much I suffered this last month, ever since we knew about needing the other father’s magic. All these nights and mornings spent together in bed. All the pure intimacy we shared, and it was all naught but based on a lie? It’s so hard to imagine.
,” he shudders, “it feels cruel and humiliating.”
After a short silence, a new song picks up, a Nirvana song, and the subject switches to Draco feeling bereft of 90s grunge as a wizard growing up in that era without any access to Muggle music at the time. “I mean, I’m quite certain that Kurt Cobain would have been able to solve all my anger issues, just like that,” Draco says, snipping his fingers and gestures to the wireless in the corner. “You see-” he stops, licking his lips, eyes blank. “You see, I’ve been thinking about this. That there wasn’t a good outlet for us. Well, except Quidditch maybe. But I would’ve been a lot more composed with something like grunge in my life. Or at least some art other than these boring portraits, chewing your bloody ears off, for Merlin’s sake.”
covered it? If they haven’t, then they surely ought to.”
After Draco prepared his short travel with an
The rooms they visit look as if they have been magicked as though from historical paintings. Even for the more traditional wizarding homes, the Manor looks like a museum, one that harbours antique after antique. There are studies that showcase magical artefacts, paintings of distant ancestors, and every sort of convenience one can imagine. Harry can’t help but wonder how the faded rooms must have looked like during Draco’s childhood.
“The Ministry took it all,” Draco continued, seeming to want to get the words off his chest. “Every book in the library, every tapestry off the wall. For the first time in my life, I was left with nothing. I struggled on for a bit – made a few Galleons making potions for some dodgy Knockturn apothecaries – but I wasn’t getting anywhere. I was barely keeping my head above water, and like I told you in the Granger-Weasley’s garden, the little money I had I spent on drinking and nightclubs. The sex work… I know how it must seem to a nice chap like you, but it saved my life. Put money in my pocket. The anonymity of it – the freedom to choose my clients and my hours – it was a job I could do and do
“Did you say Mrs Crabbe?”
The Apparition was harsh and horrible, but I landed on my feet inside a plain and very functional hotel room. There was no Kayden in sight, but Draco was there, lying naked on the bed sheets. I rushed over to him and placed my hand on his shoulders. My lover felt clammy, felt hot to the touch. His eyes were unfocussed, and all he could manage initially was a small groan.
“Well-” Malfoy swallows and leans back and looks up at the ceiling, brows contemplatively furrowed. They are both sitting on the settee with their legs drawn up to the seat. Malfoy sits straight, head now on the backrest. But Jesus, it feels weird facing away from him. Harry turns to sit sideways, head and arms on the backrest. “For one, you always seemed like someone who’d enjoy . . . the mainstream. You know, pints at the pub, karaoke night if you’re feeling wild.” Malfoy pauses for a moment. “But then, you looked always so insecure inside your skin. In your too-big clothes and with this inability to phrase proper sentences.”
The touches were subtle, but it was different to what Harry was used to. Different from the usual ways they would touch. Since Draco had confided in Harry about having been raped by Fitzgerald, well over one year ago now, Harry was adamant to do nothing,
My own hand itches for my wand, instead my knuckles meet a cheekbone.
Harry feels panic rise in his chest. He doesn’t want to think about any of that- Bloody Malfoy. He stands.
Teddy had a most concentrated crease on his forehead as he tried to mimic Harry who showed him how to lean into turns without falling off. “It’s actually easier when you go faster,” Harry mused, unsure of all the movements that come to him so automatically while flying. Of course, Teddy wanted a demonstration. Harry told him, though, that, “You can try that only once you master the slower turn, alright, Teds?” I think the safety charms won’t allow Teddy to go all that fast anyway, but Harry always has this charming way with the boy. He knows how to excite him for anything. He even manages to make eating their vegetables together sound exciting.
“Yes, yes, of course it does,” Arthur says, sounding both dismissive and a little chastised. “But the higher rate of accidents is due to the dilemma that shopkeepers are buying them when they are on sale in autumn and shortly after Christmas and leaving them to rot away in storage.”
Harry is dead serious, but Draco chuckles softly at his words, his chest bumping up and down beneath Harry while his own body is still seized with embarrassing sobs. It takes long minutes until Draco speaks again. “I think you have a very big heart, regardless of what the
They shifted closer and their lips found each other. Harry took off his spectacles and angled both their faces, his hands questioningly raised to Draco’s shoulders until he held him and kissed him, just the way he loved to do. Draco’s hands were below Harry’s shirt, ghosting up his sides and feeling up his back.
Until Harry remembers Draco’s scathing comments every second of May, solicitude that Harry mistook for insults, and he now fears what the lack of them might mean. It was because the
“I know. Don’t worry, it will be fine,” Draco replies. “Don’t you want to perform that spell?” Draco says, eyes flickering over Harry. “To extract the substances? You’ll feel better after that and a good night’s sleep, darling. And we should get you out of these clothes. You’re completely drenched.”
“Nobody listens to me!” Draco spat out. “I can say no!” he shouted at the other wizard. “Don’t touch me again, Harry.”
when it comes to Quidditch! Those Cannons of his aren’t going anyplace soon, and-“
Obviously, the place was jam-packed. The world and his wife were in there, buying great heaps of books, and I was standing behind a tall shelf of Hogwarts textbooks.
Potter couldn’t be the nice chap he seemed. It was impossible. Nobody could be as good, as genuine as Harry seemed. Draco decided to test him. He’d prove that, beneath Potter’s genial veneer, he was just like Fitzgerald.
“Oh, bloody hell,” I muttered, flustered, as I moved Draco onto his back and checked his naked body for injuries. There wasn’t anything visible, not that I could see, but I hadn’t a clue what had happened to him. “Draco love,” I demanded, hating how panicked my voice sounded. “What happened? Was it Kayden? Where has he gone?”
it happening, I just didn’t know what it was or, perhaps, I didn’t want to believe it.
“Christ, don’t be such a drama queen.” Incredulously, Tarquin chuckles until he looks up into Harry’s eyes.
Fuck, now I’m sad and horny. Great. Will be the best wank of my life.
Once again, I realised that I was staring. Forcing my eyes away, I watched Teddy, who was absorbed completely in his artwork.
, coughing and gagging on the unfamiliar scent, and losing interest before the bloke even orgasms- it’s there and then that an odd sense of liberation strikes Harry.
Harry tries to wrap his head around that statement and finds that he’s somehow interested in what Malfoy might think about him. “What do you mean?”
“Don’t worry,” the Mediwizard interrupted, “that’s normal for a fetus. Their hearts beat much faster than yours or mine. Okay, so your baby looks to be in good shape. The umbilical cord is in a clear position. Your magical womb is well formed. Don’t worry if you can’t feel much in the way of movements. That won’t happen until at least your sixteenth week, but it might be later. Of course, it's far harder to predict with wizards. There is so little in the way of documentation.” With a flick of his wand, the magic ceased. “If you could clear up now,” he asked, “and then we’ll have more of a discussion. I'll take your blood, and your weight, just to make sure that you’re healthy.”
The Beater unscrewed it, and took a swig, drinking straight from the neck. Merlin, but Fitzgerald could put the booze away. He offered Draco the bottle, but he refused. He’d drank a lot that evening already; more cocktails that he’d counted, and his head felt a little woozy.
In bed they idly explore their bodies, naked but without any heat to their touches, and Draco says, “She can be quite a formidable witch, but I like her. And they are the only family that I have, even though I’ve only known them for five years or so.” Harry closes his eyes as Draco runs his fingers over his forehead into his hair, massaging gingerly. As if compelled to imitate the touch, Harry stops ghosting his hands over Draco’s bare sides and starts rubbing his shoulders.
Fuck, but Fitzgerald was just Draco’s type. He was the first-pick Beater for the Arrows, and as built and muscular as a Horntail. He flew like the Devil himself was on his tail, and Draco could only hope he’d be every bit as vigorous between the sheets.
, Harry wants to know, and almost simultaneously, the question of his dad’s whereabouts brands itself into the forefront of his mind. Harry swallows and clears his throat thoroughly before he speaks, trying not to sound as harsh as before, only half managing. “I’m sorry, I didn’t . . . When?”
We discussed everything via the internet as per usual, and I asked for kinks and special wishes. But he seemed to have not a single clue about the usual costs and customs of such a meet-up. He didn’t ask for anything odd but offered to pay for the hotel room as if that wasn’t clear from the start. The oddest thing is that he wants dinner first. I shall dearly hope he doesn’t mean McDonald’s or anything entirely too Muggle. But a man willing to spend 5.000 pounds for one night with me will hopefully have at least a modicum of taste.
Why, exactly, was it
Diary. It’s been a long couple of weeks, hasn’t it since I last wrote? I’ve used the time well, at least I hope I have. I spoke to Hermione a while ago, over a bottle of wine, and I told her everything. I swore her to secrecy and made her swear that she wouldn’t ever tell Ron. My friend gave me some excellent advice. She’s always been the wisest person I’ve ever known, ever since I was a child.
Draco uses a house-elf service that comes to clean the house once a week. He learnt how to cook in the Netherlands together with his then-husband—Ambroos, a half-blood wizard who, on pictures, has a friendly round face, a brown beard and fancy-looking brand-name clothes—who, one year, nursed the idea of growing vegetables in the shared garden behind their apartment building and eat nothing but home-cooked meals. It’s a habit that Draco is happy to keep and for Harry, that means stir-fries every day of the week now, and he even starts helping out by slicing the vegetables which, Draco insists, is better done by hand, just like it’s the way with potion ingredients.
A shrill-white flash.
Draco runs his fingers over Harry’s lips, and the simple touch changes the look in both their eyes as Harry parts his lips. He sees Draco’s prick twitch in his boxer shorts, and Harry can’t help himself but rub his cheeks and his mouth over the swell, feeling aroused when he listens to the change in Draco’s breathing and feels his lithe muscles flexing with anticipation. The fabric darkens under Harry’s tongue. Only when he feels completely erect does Harry fondle with the hem of the boxers to take out Draco’s prick and lick the pink, glistening glans with abandon.
to that vile individual. They’d be your own! Yours to love and cherish, and to raise better than Lucius and I managed.” A tear rolled down her face. “You’d raise them to be kind and gentle, and to respect other people. You’d raise them in love.”
Draco decided that he could. Holding onto his anger would only anchor him in the past, and he had too much to live for now. He had Harry, and he had Daisy. He had a full, good life.
“How do
“Look, I don’t mean to be rude, but I’d rather be left alone tonight,” he finally manages to mutter.
. Images claw their way to the surface. The sight of bloody, little hands and the smell of detergent. The dull sound of a pan connecting with the back of a head. Two small fingers trapped between the door and its wooden frame. The baying of both a dog and the terse snarls of the uncle. The sound means darkness and starving and the stale stench of urine.
When Harry wakes sometime before the morning is greying, his stomach and his thoughts are a mess. Their little after-sex conversation pops up in his mind instantaneously; perhaps he’s been dreaming about it. His heart beats away in a stampede of panic as he looks at Draco beside him. But Harry drapes his arm over Draco’s back instead of running away. He tries with logic, arguing with himself that he doesn’t really live anywhere because a hotel suite where he's partied so hard several times that he had to refurnish two rooms once- that can hardly count as a home.
Harry shook his head vehemently. “You were a child during the war,” he said, and he wanted to add something, but I interrupted him.
Harry shakes his head, not offering an explanation at first. “Well yes,” he finds himself saying after a moment, in fear of John losing interest. “It’s just that I’m . . . not actually studying at the moment. Needed some time just . . .”
Draco was the one lucky enough to bite into the Groat that Andi had baked into the dish. “What’s your wish?” Teddy asked impishly, watching as Draco placed the coin carefully onto a napkin.
,” Draco grinds out, catching Harry’s wrist, and Harry let’s go of Draco’s clenching bottom. He rises to his knees until his thighs line up with Draco’s.
When the leaves change colour and start to fall from the maple tree in the back garden, a beautiful red through the browns and greys of mid-October through the kitchen window, Harry brings himself to say, “I’ll pay the suite today and check out,” to which Draco nods over his tea, sucking in his lips. He’s wearing that expression that tells Harry if he speaks, it'll sound rushed and nervous. But just before Draco tries to find his voice, just before Harry Disapparates, Harry pushes Draco up against the wall in the hallway and kisses him, rough and thorough.
"It scares me when you say things like that. You told me about these dreams you have about being dead."
“Well, it should be about what Teddy wants, not about what’s good for the DMLE,” Harry interjects. Hermione looks at Harry warily; he feels like he shouldn’t have said anything.
After a polite enough time—a glass of the host’s best scotch and one of his Cubans—Harry is ready to make an exit, feeling numb and queasy. He roams the rooms in search of the guy who punch-kissed him earlier, happy to see that he’s high as a kite. When he pulls him into a corner, their mouths find each other’s again with the same urgency but not quite as teethy as before. Harry hugs him close, saying, “Sorry,” before he Side-Alongs them to his hotel suite, determined to fuck his brains out if the bloke would let him.
that she’s happy.”
On most days Draco receives owls in the late afternoon, mostly from customers. One day he receives a letter from Blaise Zabini, and one day he cancels Quidditch night with Gregory Goyle which made Harry furious because he both wanted Draco to see his friends and wanted to join a Quidditch night even if it meant seeing Goyle. When Draco is about to Firecall Pansy Parkinson, he promises Harry, “I won’t mention you if you don’t . . . if you’re not yet . . .” But then he lapses into silence and, even though it’s only been about a fortnight or so, they probably both ask themselves how long this is going to stay that way with Harry hiding when customers come in and leaving the drawing room whenever someone Firecalls.
“Pick people up, go home with them,” Harry mused, gnawing on the inside of his cheek. “Aren’t you worried that people will find out?”
Harry nodded, and she took a deep breath. “He projects this image of not caring what anyone thinks about him, but it isn’t real. He cares more than anyone I’ve ever met. He just uses that facade to protect himself.”
He rode that warm feeling all the way back to the hotel. He hoped that Malfoy would be there so that he could tell him about his conversation with Ginny. He was sure that he’d make a comment of some kind but Harry found he didn’t really mind. He was interested in Malfoy’s opinion. He was also dying to discuss the fact that Harry had used the play that Malfoy had taught him - he was certain that Malfoy would have plenty to say about that.
He caught up to Draco’s limp body a few feet above the ground and managed to catch him with both arms. Draco was bigger than him and dead weight. Harry felt his broom dip but he managed to fly them haphazardly to the ground with his knees. They landed softly, and Harry staggered from his broom to meet the medical team who had come running towards them. He carefully placed Draco on the ground and stepped away as the medics tended to him.
As he flew down towards his teammates, Harry searched the ground until he spotted the blond head looking back up at him, an appreciative smile on his face.
The only thing he could remember saying was telling Draco to go back to France. He hadn’t meant it as anything more than a comment on Draco’s playing style but he doubted it had come across like that.
“Okay,” Draco said quietly.
“No, you can’t,” Draco said.
After that, things went surprisingly smoothly and it wasn’t long before Harry was standing next to Ron at the altar. It wasn’t a small ceremony - Ron’s family alone was enough to ensure that - but it still felt intimate with the trees cradling the scene from above, and the noise of merry voices and soft music.
Harry was starting to feel a little more comfortable so he offered to buy the next round, but just as he was making his way to the bar he found himself intercepted by a very large gentleman.
“Cosy.” He heard Malfoy moving about on the other end of the phone, like he was getting comfortable, and then he was back, somehow sounding even closer than before.
She made a derisive noise. “I don’t care what people expect. You’re not obligated to be anyone’s hero.”
“Could you ask her what her favourite kind of wine is?” Cormac yelled in Harry’s ear.
Harry blinked at him, trying to process why the hell Hermione and Ron would have invited Hermione’s ex-boyfriend to their wedding. It felt rude to ask, so he just smiled. “Thanks, Viktor. Good thing I’ve got you looking out for me.”
“Pretty good, eh?” Harry jolted at the shopkeeper’s words and then felt his neck grow hot when he saw his knowing smile.
Ginny laughed. “Don’t be an idiot. I might not be your fiance anymore but I never stopped being your friend.”
When he finally made it to breakfast he was relieved not to see Malfoy, and equally apprehensive to see Angelina. She waved him over cheerfully and slid a purple vial of hangover potion to him as he sat down.
The man waggled his finger drunkenly at Harry and then ambled back to his table, leaving Harry feeling confused but undeniably relieved.
“He probably won’t turn up anyway,” Ron added helpfully. “He’ll snitch to Filch like he did last year.”
The Cannon’s Beater had turned and Campbell had smashed into one of the hoop poles with a horrible sound that echoed throughout the arena. The Beater recovered quickly, but the same could not be said of Campbell who was flying jerkily down to the grass.
“Merlin, do I have to spell it out for you? Have you ever tried to have a dirty floo call? It’s a logistical nightmare.” He rolled his eyes again, looking unruffled and haughty once more. Shifting the embarrassment to Harry seemed to allow him to regain his composure.
Harry nodded. “He’s done a good job.”
Harry groaned again, “No! Of course not.” He met her eye and immediately regretted it when he saw the raised eyebrows. “Well, maybe my feelings about it are slightly more complicated than that but I wasn’t jealous.”
building at the far end of Diagon Alley. Harry should probably have left when he realised that.
“Sorry?” Harry coughed and was annoyed to find Malfoy smirking at him.
For the first time in his life, looking at the picture of Malfoy, he wondered if that was normal. Did Ron and Cormac feel like that? Did they keep their eyes lowered when their mates were walking around naked in the changing room?
“So, Potter, what was it like being beaten by your old school rival Draco Malfoy?” a man in green robes called.
“What are you going to do?” Ginny had asked.
Harry swallowed. That must be the aunt that Draco had inherited this place from.
“It was all true,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t be half the Seeker I am now without you pushing my buttons. I’m sorry I’ve been such an idiot.” He felt his words spilling out as usual but now he didn’t try to stop them. “I don’t expect you to forgive me just like that but I wanted you to know that I understand why you were scared of what this could be. But I think that this could be really good. I mean, I think that we could be really good together, properly this time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Draco were just about to follow them to the living room when the Floo gave a final puff of green smoke and Granger and Weasley emerged, with a very excited and wiggly child in tow. She squealed with joy as Granger dusted soot out of her hair.
“I just don’t know how to fix this,” Harry mumbled into his arms.
“So are you two like… together then?” Ron asked gruffly and Harry blanched.
“I…” Harry was briefly speechless. He looked down at his plate - it was less formidable than Malfoy's glare. “I’m not trying to soothe anything. We’re roommates and teammates, for the next few weeks anyway, we might as well try to get on.”
It wasn’t as nice as the one that Harry was usually put in, he noted, and then forgot every single thought he’d ever had when he saw Malfoy leaning against the counter, shirtless.
“Why aren’t you dressed?” Draco demanded.
“Turn’t off,” he groaned, pulling his pillow over his face to try to dull the noise. When it didn’t stop he reached blindly on his bed for another pillow and lobbed it in the general direction of Malfoy’s bed. He was gratified to hear a huff of annoyance when it met its target.
“I didn’t… He never said anything.”
Harry spluttered. “That’s rich coming from someone who signs autographs during game time.”
Once again, Harry felt that familiar anger twist in his chest, and a small part of his brain registered that it felt good.
“Alright, you lot,” Harry called over the noise of chatting voices and the tinkle of teaspoons against teacups. “If I could have your attention, please?”
Harry swallowed. “Have you been here before?”
Would Krum tell anyone? Harry wasn’t sure. He pictured, as he had done so many times before, on the front page of the Prophet in the morning: ‘Potter embroiled in illicit affair with fellow Seeker.’ He felt ill.
What the actual fuck just happened? One minute they’d been yelling at each other like normal, and then the next… Harry hit his head against the tiles a few times for good measure.
They were never going to make it out of the entryway, but Harry refused to come in his pants like a teenager, so he reached down and pulled Malfoy’s hand to the front of his pants, hoping that he’d get the hint. Luckily, Malfoy seemed to be very much on the same page because he made fast work of the button and zip. Harry pulled his jeans down with one hand, which was rather awkward but the best he could do without breaking the kiss. Something in him knew that if they stopped kissing again, he’d lose his nerve.
“One of those nights, is it?” Angelina asked, giving him an odd look. “Are you alright?”
“I see.” Draco considered his words carefully. “You know, I didn’t know how to fly when I was six either.”
Harry all but ran down the corridor away from the room, Malfoy and the man. He didn't slow down until he got to the elevator. Once inside, he smashed the button to make the doors close and then pressed the one for the lobby. He felt lightheaded and furious and had to lean against the wall of the lift to catch his breath.
Thank you so much for reading this all, I hope it brought you a bit of joy!
Hours later, Harry Apparated right to his front door and almost fell through it in exhaustion. The team talk had been even worse than normal. Ron had spent almost an hour speaking and Harry had seriously considered just going to sleep on one of the mats in the training room. He barely made it upstairs, and only had time to kick his boots off before he fell head-first onto his bed, fully dressed, and slipped into blissful darkness. His last thought was that he was definitely going to regret not taking off his jeans when he woke up.
It was almost unbearably beautiful, the kind of clear, freezing cold morning he hadn’t properly experienced since he’d left Hogwarts, and it made his chest feel tight with nostalgia.  He loved London and Grimmauld Place, but something about Scotland felt like coming home in a way he hadn’t even realised he had missed.
Draco’s head shot up. “You did what?”
Harry turned back to him, rage making him feel lightheaded and shaky. He pulled up so that they were face to face. “Do you know what…”
Harry thought about telling him not to treat him like a house-elf but found he didn’t really mind. That's what he signed up for, after all.
“Something a bit less ginger?” Malfoy teased.
“Um,” she blinked, clearly thrown. “I’m not sure. I think maybe he left?”
Ginny, who had been in the middle of taking a swig of Firewhisky, choked violently. Alarmed, Harry thumped her on the back, concerned about the logistics of performing the Heimlich manoeuvre on a rooftop.
He wondered why Malfoy had chosen to come back now, perhaps he was hoping to play in the World Cup? If Campbell did end up retiring like everyone seemed to think he would, the Scottish team would be in need of a new Seeker, and if Malfoy was based in Scotland he could potentially be eligible. It was an unpleasant thought, but Scotland hadn’t even qualified for the World Cup in years and without Campbell, their chances weren’t great. Surely if Malfoy had been any good Harry would have heard about it?
They drank in silence for a few minutes, watching the frost slowly form on the lawn.
After an age, he finally pushed his fingers past the elastic and wrapped his hand around Harry, who had to bite down hard on his cheek to keep from embarrassing himself. Malfoy’s hand was so much bigger than a girl's, maybe even bigger than Harry’s own, and rough and strong from years of gripping a broom.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “Is that what you came here for?”
They trained together all afternoon. Now that he was working through his cloud of resentment, Harry was able to admit that it was pretty fun playing and training with another Seeker, especially one as good as Malfoy. They were relatively evenly matched in most things - Harry was a bit faster but Malfoy played dirty and scrappy, and when they finally landed after an extremely fast-paced Seekers game, the tension between them seemed to have - well, not completely disappeared, but definitely thawed out.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, but then he swayed again and this time Malfoy caught his arm, the one with the glass in it.
“Bugger off,” he replied, not really sure how to feel about that.
On reflection, Harry should have probably prepared himself better for how strange it would be to hold another man’s dick in his hand, but he had never been known for his forward-thinking skills. It was hot in his hand, both soft and hard. After twenty-four years of only holding his own, he decided it felt a little like touching his arm after he’d laid on it for too long. He looked down at it. It was pinker and paler than Harry’s own, but at the end of the day it was a dick and a dick was a dick.
“It’s all a bit overwhelming isn’t it?” Harry breathed, shivering very slightly at Draco’s touch.
“It’s brilliant,” Harry said, gesturing to the view. “It reminds me so much of Hogwarts.”
“Alright, enough Quidditch talk,” Hermione interrupted just as Ron was opening his mouth again. “Have you spoken to Ginny?”
She wasn’t wrong. It had been, as Oliver Wood would say, a shite week. He knew he was being ungrateful to be this miserable during a once in a lifetime tour, but he couldn't help it. He and Malfoy weren’t getting along any better so he just felt weird and anxious in their room. Part of Harry knew he should make more of an effort to get along with him but Malfoy made it bloody difficult. He had helped Harry today though, in his own strange way. Harry couldn’t wrap his head around why but he had to admit that the words of encouragement had spurred him on, even if it wasn’t in the manner in which they had been intended.
“It looks freezing,” Harry complained.
“She never had kids?” Harry asked, wrapping his cold hands around the mug.
There was no time to think about that because Wood and Davies were approaching each other to shake hands.
So maybe he didn’t like anyone then? But then his mind strayed back to the cubicle of the third-floor boys’ bathroom and his cheeks flushed, he had definitely liked that. He decided that he wasn’t going to be able to make any decisions about anything tonight, it would all depend upon how he felt when he saw Malfoy again.
Ask nicely, he remembered and tried to look humble. “What I meant to say was… could you show me
They were only a few metres above the ground now, and still diving. The Snitch hovered just above the grass, as if deciding which way to go, and Harry made a decision. He let go of his broom and dove, arm stretched out towards the little gold ball. Unfortunately, Draco made the same decision at the same time and they collided mid-air, landing heavily in a tangle of robes and limbs. They rolled a little way, mud flying up and coating both of them. The crowd were on their feet, holding their breaths.
“One of the greatest lessons I’ve learnt over the past four years is that a player is only as good as those he plays against. It’s easy when you’re doing well to think that you’re entitled to winning, and having someone come in and make you question that is… challenging. When that happened to me, I didn’t handle it with the grace that I should have, but now I know that I would not be the player I am at this moment without that challenge. So my final thank you is to Draco Malfoy, who has forced me to work harder every game and play at a higher level than I ever thought I was capable of to keep up with him. England should be very proud to have produced him, and Scotland are lucky to have him.”
“You tripped me! How can you even begin to accuse me of cheating?” Harry spluttered.
Draco’s face flushed, and he shook his head. “No… Harry here, he’s- he’s just my friend. I’m currently living with him, and..” He paused. Even though we were only moments into the appointment, I already had a sinking feeling. Draco is a proud, dignified person, and I expected that, in his mind, everything already felt ruined. His greatest fear is being the object of ridicule.
Harry looked aghast. “That wasn’t what I was saying! I’d never disparage another wizard for how he chose to live his life. Fuck knows there were enough headlines about me when I was younger.” He shook his head again. “Look, I don’t care who the father is, Draco, but shouldn’t he be looking after you? I’ve never seen anyone more in need of a friend than you are right now.”
In his peripheral view, it doesn’t escape Harry how Neville’s gaze and mouth corners drop to their linked fingers, and something about that is almost too much for Harry to bear. They take a walk along the beach, only he and Draco. Ginny and Ron want to join, grinning and fierce as they are, but Harry hears Hermione tell them off without many words.
Harry knows that it’s late. It’s so late that it might as well be early. That’s why he doesn’t Apparate into the hallway but outside of Draco’s home where the shallow gate creaks when he opens it, eyes directed at the candle-lit drawing room window. He’s shivering with sweat and spring rain forcing his clothes to stick close to his body.
sex, but they’d both orgasmed. He wasn’t bleeding. He wasn’t hurt. Yes, they hadn’t vibed, but you couldn’t win them all. Fitzgerald was a greedy, lousy lover, and in the future, he’d avoid him like Splattergroit. Fitzgerald wouldn't be the first man Draco had swerved on Diagon Alley.
For the first time in his life, Draco envied the Muggles. How easy would it be, to get lost in one of their big cities? Draco daydreamt about how easy it all might be. He could run away and cast off his wand. He could hide in one of their tower-blocks, camouflaged by banal ordinariness. He’d miss his mother though. She was all alone since Father had gone to Azkaban and he was all that she had.
On the last day of the Quidditch season, Draco decided the time was ripe to proposition Fitzgerald. Appleby had won an astounding victory, finishing top of the league for the second year in a row, and the players were in an ebullient, giddy mood as they trooped out for the post-match press conference, full of banter and repartee.
make their voices sound really awful on purpose. Like merpeople but out of the water. Or . . ."
who your godfather is, but I had no idea that I’d actually be invited-” She makes herself stop speaking. Harry thinks that she understood Teddy’s earthbound smile rather quickly in comparison with his former paramours.
Just as is the case with Nick, outside the pit, most of the black clothed people are surprisingly peaceful for people who growl along to such gruesome lyrics. Not that Harry ever understood them, they are wildly incomprehensive—but Nick showed him lyrics about praising ancient demons and vivid descriptions of a thousand ways to die in the most painful agony.
“I know,” Tarquin replies. “I can be an arsehole . . . We all try to get through life I suppose. I’m just happy that he found something that seems to work for him.” Harry smiles and takes his hand. Tarquin’s highs always last longer than his, and it’s actually quite endearing to hear him talk like that. Harry knows perfectly well that he isn’t much different under influence. It’s always suddenly so easy to talk to people—to strangers even—feeling compelled to speak the truth, and ready to relate to everyone’s perspectives and feelings. So easy to talk about feelings.
of Harry’s wand that leads their way down the Muggle road towards the next farm, surrounded by fields and meadows that make themselves known only through a smell of verdant spring flowers and dung, Harry feels like an idiot. He forgot what exactly had felt so cruel while sitting there in the living room with everyone. When he remembers his thoughts, all the accusations that streamed through his head, it feels like nothing but self-centred, egomaniacal nonsense. Why can’t he just be confident with how things are? Why does he always have to make everything about himself? Harry wishes deeply that his mind would just shut up. That being around people wouldn’t exhaust him.
“Harry,” Draco says in between kisses, not using his sex-voice.
“I wouldn’t have done it without you,” Harry replies. “I mean- Obviously, I wouldn’t have done it because it’s your atelier and all. But I would’ve done a shit job without your instructions. I had no idea that I’d feel so . . .
Tarquin’s jog slows down a bit, catching Harry’s wrist to set him into a slower pace as well before completely coming to a halt. He rests his hands on his knees, breathing heavily for a minute before answering. “Well, he looked happy, didn’t he? With his desk job and all. Good that he found that. That it works for him.”
. You can scarcely see it.”
, and a
, pinioned and trapped.
He can’t stop himself, but his urgent tone changes into an amused one when Hermione starts chortling, her eyes gleaming with joy and understanding. “You’re very much besotted with him.”
“Ha ha,” Draco drawls, eyebrows raised. He cards his fingers through his hair, smoothing it down as though it was messy.
“Oh fuck,” Harry finds himself muttering before kissing Draco fiercely. “Call me Potter, will you?” he requests, before he knows it, eliciting a smirk on Draco’s face.
But Potter is almost convincing with his fervent gazes and appreciative words. I know that he thinks I’m the hottest thing in the universe while I’m pregnant with his child. I’d love to hear all the racy things on his mind whenever he looks at me, completely unfiltered.
“You needn’t be,” Draco replies. He loops his arm around Harry’s middle, causing them to sway a little as they walk side by side. He makes them stop then, face slanted to the night sky where the hint of moonlight illuminates a voluminous cloud.
Draco couldn’t understand how he’d ever been attracted to this slimy, nasty specimen. His tongue felt like a tentacle trying to choke him, and Draco gagged a little. He was done being nice. It was time to sit up, and fuck off. He might have a Dark Mark, and a dad rotting in Azkaban, but he still had a modicum of self-respect.
“I’m sorry.”
“That too. Not everything, but yes. It was hardly a fruitful discussion, rather a . . . heated exchange of opinions.”
“Don’t worry,” I answered. “You, Teddy and Andi sit tight. You’ll be the first ones we tell when we know anything else.”
Draco grinned, and he swished his wand, charming their water to the perfect temperature and pressure.
Gentlemanly as I always try to be, I let my hands rest on Draco’s hips. “Only if you’re comfortable,” I said, leaning in to brush a chaste kiss on Draco’s shoulder. “You don’t have to reciprocate. Pleasure for you is good enough for me.”
,” Harry answers Draco’s imploring gaze. “You have no idea what you do to me, Malfoy.”
“Well, it’s just . . .
I fear that giving into him, that having slept with him, might be my doom. But I’m a self-destructive idiot. I would and will do it again. I don’t think he’ll be able to resist.
“You will be,” Fitzgerald answered, not looking at Draco. He was fiddling with the lid of the bottle, his whole focus on that. “And I’ll be topping.” He smirked. “Should have thought that was obvious.”
They fall into a rhythm that feels as though they’ve been living together for years while their kisses stay urgent and heated and their fingers reverently explorative. Harry pleads that it will never change.
I ought to talk to him. I need to tell Harry what I did, and I will need to actually apologise for breaking his trust. I’ll suggest that we try talking more often and about real subjects. We both try to be honest; I don’t doubt that. But there are things the both of us overthink until we believe them to be true. And we’re so scared of saying them, afraid that the other might leave.
“The truth is,” Draco said, pausing dramatically, “that I
The sex is raw after that, possessive on either side.
Yesterday I spied him looking in the mirror, examining his figure from every angle and I wanted to go in and tell him how perfect he was and how gorgeous. I didn’t dare though. Draco already worries that he is taking advantage of our friendship.
stops asking about you!” She grinned. “Looks like
“What’s the matter, hun?” she asks, looking at Harry with huge eyes.
I should stop rambling. My little plum is making themselves seen and I shall tell friends and family soon enough. Seeing Harry every other day is giving me the necessary strength.
, Harry wants to say, but instead he asks, "How am I supposed to promise something like that? On some days I'm feeling at the top of the world because of you. And on others I feel like the most pathetic scum in the universe. It’s . . . I’m . . ."
After what might have been minutes or an hour, Harry starts moving through the crowd, looking for Tarquin. The bloke has a habit of getting lost, but Harry’s dead sure that he must be on the dancefloor somewhere—hard techno is his favourite.
Teddy looks very undecided for a second that he seems to hold his breath. “Actually . . . See, I’ve been calling a friend and I wondered whether they could come over. Some wine to go with that would be awesome. If that’s okay with the Wards and everything.”
“Fancy, huh?” Draco gives a smirk and pulls Harry closer and closer until Harry is sitting astride his lap. “He was Dutch. Same sex marriage was legalised in the Netherlands in 2001. So we married the same month it was legalised.”
” he moans repeatedly as though saying his name would somehow tether him or keep his body from trembling uncontrollably. It feels like climaxing a lot, only that the feeling is repeated with each miniscule movement of the toy. Harry gets more used to it after the first minute, succumbing to the pleasure that narrows his self-awareness down to this one spot inside of him and his tongue that keeps lapping at Draco’s, hot and wet.
Harry can’t do anything but nod, guilty, apologetic, unable to meet Malfoy’s piercing silver eyes.
“Can we kiss?” Harry can’t help but ask.
At Christmas Harry went to the Burrow for the first time in nearly six years. The only thing that has changed about the house he’d once called his home for a few years was the number of young Weasleys larking about. When Harry saw Molly and Arthur for the first time, and they hugged him, their love as freely given as ever before. Their hugs raised a sting in his eyes that he was barely able to fight. They greeted him like the long-lost son that he is to them, but Molly was not without rebuke. “
Teddy shrugs. “I don’t know.”
took away my power but I’m allowed to take it back. This decision is the most important one of my life, and it has to be the right one for both of us.”
“Please,” Draco answered, and I could see the tears already welling in his eyes. In seconds the room was filled with a loud whooshing sound. It was fast, faster than mine, and I could see that Draco was as surprised as I was. “Gods, that’s so fast, is that-“
He could slide off the bed, try to locate his wand and Disapparate home. He was pretty bloody drunk though, and the idea of getting Splinched wasn’t a pleasant one. Draco didn’t think he’d be speedy enough either, and somehow the idea of displeasing Fitzgerald was enough to make him feel a little queasy.
“There will hardly be a proper pit tonight,” Nick says absentmindedly without looking up from the book of Wallace short stories he’s reading. “We’re going to see Alcest,” he says as though this should explain everything. “It’s a black metal band. Quite atmospheric,” he elaborates.
reporting we were a couple. Jules and Marcy were the only ones able to see past the tabloid bollocks and make me their apprentice. There I was, the Saviour of the wizarding world, and I was set to the job of making tea, sweeping up wood shavings and slowly learning the fine art of designing and making broomsticks.
Potter. I don’t know how he does it, but for some reason, he’s always giving me the feeling that he knows what’s on my mind. And he’s not pushing me to spill the beans, nor ignoring me for taking AGES to confide something to him. If I’m absent, he sends note after note, not building up pressure but giving me options to accept seeing him or just chatting via owl.
He pays his attentions to Draco’s bollocks, nibbling and licking the soft skin, before he dives deeper and probes a lick below his balls and towards the crease of his arse. Draco inhales noisily. The muscles in his thighs and arse twitch, but his legs fall open as though he can’t decide whether he wants more or wants Harry to stop. But when Harry licks again, Draco mutters, “Fuck, Potter,” sounding desperate, but he angles his hips to give Harry more room to reach his pucker.
that might even in the slightest distress Draco. Those awful circumstances had brought them Daisy, of course. But that terrible thing that had happened to Draco also rendered him twitchy whenever there was an unexpected touch. And sometimes, he would let Harry rest his hand on him when they were sitting on the settee, watching the telly together, but in the very next moment he would politely shove his arm away, a look of apology on his face, one which, as Harry repeatedly told him, was not at all necessary.
-Death Eater, he reminds himself. Malfoy doesn’t seem hostile, and neither is he behaving suspiciously friendly. Also, Malfoy took the same stuff. Even cared for their needs with water and all. It’s fine. This is all completely fine.
“And you tried to kiss me before.”
Draco takes very good care of himself and the plum. Draco constantly moans about my cigarettes, and he hasn’t had as much as a sip of wine ever since fireworks night. The idea of him taking Muggle drugs was ludicrous.
. Bigger, better—that sort of thing. I hope this doesn’t sound presumptuous, but, in a way, I too was abused as a child.”
I’m seeing Healer Bartsch every other week now. Everything is fine with the plum, and Harry and I were steadfast not to learn the gender of our baby yet. If everything goes as planned, the Healer will perform a caesarean section on the 26th of June. I’ll see the Healer every other week now, and he insisted that I immediately Firecall him when I feel like something might be wrong.
, for having been outside of the wizarding world for years, or for jutting down the address he shares with Draco Malfoy- well, he’ll gladly come back for his next check-up in six months.
“Though not quite as bad as our fake date.” He broke off a piece of Honeydukes toffee and popped it in his mouth. He chewed thoughtfully, swallowing before he continued speaking. “You better not go to Alaska, Harry. The Granger-Weasley’s would only turn up and drag you back to London. They’d wither away with worry I'd you weren't in Flooing distance.”
“Sometimes I feel like I’m not even a wizard,” Harry says, half absently following Draco into the kitchen.
Being late or having to clean themselves up all over again is the last of their thoughts in the heat of the moment. And moments like these, they always come unbidden and intense. Together in their mutual self-devotion they become the only entity in the universe.
, he is hoping. “Let’s have a nice time and maybe get you writing once you’re in the mood.”
“Promise that you won’t leave,” Harry whispers. Then, almost inaudible, “All good things always leave.”
