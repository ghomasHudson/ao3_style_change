Hermione pursed his lips some more, eerily looking like a combination of Molly Weasley and McGonagall's stern expressions. Ron raised his head from his crouching. He frowned at the book on Harry's hand.
Harry sheepishly grinned, willing his own blush to go away. He stared up at Draco's eyes, they were alight and
“I thought the offer was still up?” Harry said, breathlessly. He cleared his throat. “I mean, if you wanted to, of course. I’m just asking, if you, you know. Just—”
It wasn't until they had turned the corner away from the Gargoyles that guarded the Headmaster's office that Harry stopped to pant against the wall. Malfoy laid a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“I said scoot over, Harry,” Draco repeated, his voice a soft lilt in the ringing silence of the dorm room. Harry’s throat worked up, staring at Draco before he shifted to give Draco space.
. Harry watched him with a fanatic fervor. If it were in the past, Harry wouldn't even dare to acknowledge Malfoy's composed and relax bearing when brewing. But right now that he was offered a front row view, it was there for him to appreciate. Malfoy moved with beautiful precision, maneuvering across their miniature potion station with clear-cut accuracy while still looking delicate and cool. He looked like he was born for the Potions lab, the way he held the knife and stir the potion with his calculating, aristocratic hands.
Harry frowned. He blearily opened one eye, bolting out of his bed as he saw Malfoy looming over him by his bedside.
And right now, he was terrified of having to deal with the same marred consequences. Harry could handle Dark Lords and Potions with Snape but emotions are on another, unreachable level.
They looked at each other. Something melted in Draco's eyes, something inexplicable crossed his face before he sharply turned around.
"I know," Draco softly said. His lips lingered for a moment against Harry's nape, and Harry shivered at the intimate gesture. "It's foolish of me, but it's the only way I knew to get your attention. It worked, but not the intended result."
"I—I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean it," Harry said again, rather lamely. But the expression on the blond's face was bordering on hysteria, shaking his head hastily.
Harry grunted noncommittally before chewing on his food. In his periphery, he saw Hermione sharing a knowing look with Ron. Again with their sentimentally cloying uniform looks that always gratingly reminded him of his solo life. Harry's patience run out. He woke up on the wrong side of bed after all.
"Oh. I forgot to mention, forgive me for my ephemeral memory," Draco said primly and simpered. Harry was horribly reminded of Umbridge and her deliberately condescending giggles in fifth year. "We're going to my father's obsequy."
"Until what?" Harry interrupted, harsher than he intended, looking anywhere but Malfoy, heart beating loudly in his throat. "It wouldn't really make it more bearable if we continue holding off, would it?"
Draco's behavior was becoming more and more fiercely antagonistic, targeting unsuspecting students, mostly first and second year Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors, spitting nonsense about their Muggleborn blood, their Houses and clothing tastes.
"Can I... can I heal it?" Harry asked, coughing at his squeaky voice. Harry saw Malfoy's lips lightly pursed but he nodded anyway. Harry pulled his wand and pray that his Healing spells would be efficient enough not to worsen Malfoy's broken nose. Harry exhaled at the familiar sickening sound of the bone repairing. "Is that okay?"
"I guess I was just too focused on our past together that I forgot we are not the same person we were before," Ginny softly said, eyes glazing as if reminiscing the small time she and Harry shared before circumstances ruined it. There was a sad smile tugging at her lips; not of misery for their lost love but of one filled with regret and longing, not unlike Harry's.
was periodically published two years ago, in their fifth year, and had recently gained fame after the latest book, the sixth of the installment, was released quite coincidentally a month after the war, which also featured the war between Saturnine and the demigods' dimension. Nobody ever knew who the writer was, who chose to remain anonymous.
Right. It was hardly Advance Potion. It was not too hard to see that he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Again.
Harry lost himself through the motions of the funeral. He had enough of burial rites that he had attended after the war to last him a lifetime. While the appointed vicar preceded the ceremony, Harry stared at the cracks in the walls and ceiling of the mausoleum, counting them in his head. It wasn't until Draco let go of his hand and stood that Harry tuned back to the present. Draco was standing in front of his father's open casket, though he wasn't staring down at it. He stayed there for a few seconds before he briskly sat back down beside Harry.
Harry walked over the long table at the center and got the ingredients out of his bag. He appraised the room, and chuckled in approval at the Gryffindor red and gold that colored most of the room. Surely, Malfoy would throw a fit at the atrocious coloring that presumably disgust his Slytherin taste.
, in your life, Potter. Because you treating everyone the way you do is the reason why they all left you."
“This is tiring,” Harry sighed, the tight lines around his lips and the clench of his jaws speak for themselves. He pulled his knees to his chest. Draco pulled his hand from Harry’s face. “I wish I could sleep. Though that would be asking too much.”
"Potty, potty, potty," Malfoy sang in his sarcastic, biting tone, "has Potter gone loony? Snap out of it, idiot! I'm going to Severus' chambers but if you're just going to sit their with your imbecilic self, then it's a pleasure to leave you be at your balmy Gryffindor tendencies."
"Of course, it could be that, Ron. But you're suggesting that the Ministry let this self-appointed violence against criminals occur, which very much disregarded the Criminal Reform Act of 1998. I'm sure Shackelbolt won't allow it—"
"Are you?" Draco turned to him, and the unpleasant churning in his stomach turned to nausea at the look in Draco's eyes. The quicksilver, that Harry always found mesmerizing, turned scathingly cold. "No you're not, Potter. You only say that because of your stupid Gryffindor sensibilities. You hate him, he's a Death Eater. You were glad because he was dead, he deserved it because he was a fucking Death Eater scum."
For the first few weeks into the term, Harry was quite pre-occupied with thinking of ways how to not get ravaged by the crowd, and not to mention, how to shot down his ex-girlfriend's advances without meaning to be rude and hurting her, and how to survive the eighth year without being pressured by the abnormally large expectations placed upon him. Harry had not think about Malfoy since the trials.
Harry and Draco were with Hermione, Parkinson, Ron and Zabini in the eighth year Common Room. It was one o'clock in the morning, and the rest of the eighth years had retired to their dormitories or went out to their private trysts somewhere in the castle. It's still half an hour before the potions wore off, and Harry couldn't wait to end this day.
Wizarding homes weren’t passed over with a key. Malfoy couldn’t own it in absentia — his magical signature had to stay present in the home to control it, woven in the spells, offering claim of ownership. As the days ticked away, the Manor was presumed to be falling further away from wizarding control, and Harry had gotten the Floo call two days ago.
“I know.” Harry felt stupid and small being upset in the face of that, being petulant or restless or alienated or whatever the feelings were that had tangled in his head. It was the same familiar childish anger he’d always hidden away, whenever he dared to want something. At school he’d thought of that feeling as a monster, and he privately still did. The monster of selfishness and jealousy, that he knew had no justification. Harry had spent the day with his friends, had even had Hermione alongside Pansy earlier, and yet he’d bristled at what he could lose if Draco regained his true confidante. He could tell he was being unfair, but then again, Harry’s friends hadn’t tried to sacrifice Draco to Voldemort. “I was trying to give you time. I saw Neville and Luna.”
Ron had promised to speak with Pansy, to bring her back to Grimmauld under the guise of partner bonding. He’d send word later on as to whether she’d go for it that night or put him off — he didn’t want to insist and risk her suspicion before anything could be safely said. It was going on two. They had a few hours of waiting, and enough antiness to fill every minute.
“That looks good,” he said, putting his chin on Draco’s shoulder after he finished dumping hot sauce all over the eggs. He had to stand on his tip-toes, a bit, but he was determined to find all the other ways that they fit together before Draco retreated again.
“So what happened?” Hermione tucked her wand back into her pocket and touched his nose with concern. “Want a fix?”
“How do you know?” Draco wondered. He’d gone slightly blurry, but this close up, Harry could still read the myriad of emotions on his face. “Did Snape tell you? My mother… she thought he was a spy.”
George showed up, towed by an over-enthusiastic Lee, who kept a sharp eye on him and didn’t accept any drinks. Harry and Ron swept him up at once, making safe conversation about Quidditch, and by the time he felt comforted by the rusty return of George’s laughter, a dozen more of Ginny’s friends had arrived.
“Fine,” Harry spat, his anger now merging with his magic until it hurt his chest. “Go on. Run home. Waste away in the walls again. Die in there like a rat, if that’s what you want so badly.”
Harry slid down onto his back and turned his face to the window of Draco. “True.” He wondered if he should apologize, but Draco half-laughed before he could, his eyes sliding shut.
“He gave me a detention,” Harry said, laughing. “Promised he wouldn’t tell McGonagall, though. Said it could stay between us as long as I kept my head about me next time. I’ll be helping him with something or another tomorrow night. If I'm lucky it'll be half as fun as the time Lockhart made me address all his fan mail.”
"He's realised gender doesn't much matter for him when it comes to, you know, matters of the heart, I s'pose. This is sort of his way of celebrating that on a subconscious level."
Draco looks at him, standing there dripping wet and painfully sincere, and he wants to have the strength to turn him away but he doesn't.
Just like that, Draco’s heart climbed back up into his throat. Flashes of memory made drops of perspiration pop up all over the skin of his neck — roaring fire, Crabbe’s shrieks of agony, the heat, god, the
“Please don’t apologise.” Draco swallowed hard, unable to meet Potter’s eyes. “Look, I’m exhausted. I think I’m gonna head back to my dorm.”
“I knew it.” Ron shook his head, looking both disgusted and betrayed. “I bloody knew it was him. It always is with you, isn’t it?”
Draco knows he's going to crumble eventually, knows Potter's waiting for it, but it's not until Sunday that he finally does.
“What’s he told you, then?” he asked, taking a bite of toast and savouring the warmth against the chilly wind. “I still don’t know what Hermione told
expression on his face. “You couldn’t even let me rot in Azkaban, could you? At least then I’d be with Father instead of stuffing myself into Pansy’s old dresses! I
about it. I admire that so much about you, your ability to just let emotions be emotions without needing to open them up and study them. But I think in this situation, understanding it a little better might be a prerequisite to figuring out how to proceed.”
He ran into Malfoy as he was climbing the stairs up to the second floor. Malfoy, one foot on the first step, took one look at him and went red. He tried backing up and nearly tripped backwards over it, eyes wide as he caught his balance. Harry crested the landing, frowning at him as he backed up again and this time stumbled back against a wall.
“Harry,” he gasped, fingers digging into those sturdy shoulders, but Harry merely bit down on his nipple and kept going. He was on the edge of a second by the time Harry stopped lifting and started pumping up into him frantically, grunting into his neck, and finally came with a broken shout. Draco spilled over the edge again when he felt his cunt being flooded with hot come, and for several minutes they sat there clutching one another, his bruised tits pressed into Harry’s chest, arms looped around his neck and shivering.
“Not particularly,” Draco drawled, and to his delight, he felt Potter’s fingers squeeze tighter on his hips, his back pressed against a firm chest. “The topic of the night is not really to my taste.” He heard Potter’s soft chuckle and a brief smile came over Draco’s face before he determinedly got rid of it. “Nobody can get enough of you these days, can they, Potter? I do believe you’re on your way to becoming a Wizarding legend. It’s pitiful. You hardly even did anything.”
"I just wanted to see," Draco hears himself say, not much above a whisper now. He wants to look away but can't, Potter's eyes are probing and intense and hold Draco's gaze against his will.
Draco thought of that moment, nearly engulfed by the Fiendfyre and clutching Goyle to him on a burning mountain of junk, that he’d seen Harry on a broom and realised with hysterical relief that he was coming back for them.
“Shut up, you fucking bonehead,” Draco snaps. Potter’s still laughing, eyes crinkled in a sickeningly endearing way, and when he opens them again they’re alarmingly green in the sunlight. “Like you don’t stare at my arse in Potions.”
Harry slides his hand down to Draco's and links their fingers together, bringing it to his mouth and pressing a kiss to it.
“Don’t,” Harry said, cutting him off sharply. He opened his eyes and looked down at the impossible sight before him, and on Malfoy’s face he saw a subdued smirk. He squeezed again and then leaned forward, dragging the flat of his tongue up the vein on the underside of Harry’s cock. Harry’s head fell back again and he said, voice slightly strained, “Just … shut the fuck up for once, Malfoy, and keep doing that.”
“Turn over,” he said a bit breathlessly. Malfoy looked over his shoulder and Harry saw that his full, sensual lips were bitten raw.
“What?” he muttered stupidly. He swallowed, trying to find his bearings. “This is a preferable topic to your Muggles, is it, Potter?”
“Jesus fucking Christ, Potter,” Draco said weakly, shifting his hips and moaning when he felt Harry’s cock softening inside him, come dribbling out of his clenching hole. “What the
“Is that right?” Harry says. It’s strained slightly, and he lets out a hoarse laugh. He opens his eyes and meets Draco’s, doing everything in his power not to lift his hips into the constant, torturous slide of that perfect hand. “Keeping in mind, of course, that you’ve always been a bit of a slut for it I do have to say you look more ravenous than usual.”
"Oi, I'm coming with," Ron said when he'd gotten back his breath, "I got to see Snape's face when he finds out Harry and Draco've got a kid together."
.” Draco lifted his eyebrows, taken aback by this admonishment, but Harry went on too quickly for him to say anything. “And usually he lives at Grimmauld Place, but McGonagall’s letting him work here at Hogwarts while I’m finishing up so he doesn’t have to be alone in that place again. It drove him fucking batty last time.”
“You have, many times,” Harry said, and then leaned forward to attach his mouth to the crook of Draco’s neck and shoulder. Draco bit down on his lip when Harry’s hands lifted to unclasp his bra and slid it off his arms, the gentle brush of callused fingers raising bumps on his skin.
“Mum,” he started, a lump the size of an apple in his throat and his hands shaking violently, “I’m sort of … seeing somebody. I don’t know whether … that is to say, it’s rather complicated. You see, I never, erm … I couldn’t find a good chance to — to tell you, but …”
Draco blinked at him. A look of reluctance passed across his face but it wasn't quite as bad as Harry expected it to be.
Harry was not smiling when he came close and gently took the Cloak back. He threw it carelessly on the bed that must have been his and then took both of Draco’s hands in his own. One of them he lifted to his mouth and brushed his lips across the knuckles. Draco had never seen those green eyes look so bright before.
The silence that followed the abrupt cutoff of Theo’s short tirade was resounding. He looked at Harry with his eyes gone wide as saucers, and for his part, Harry merely stood there with an impenetrable expression on his face.
yourself love him. After everything that’s happened, Draco, I … I fear we ultimately failed you as parents. This wasn’t the way things were supposed to be when you graduated from Hogwarts.” Tears were sparkling in her eyes again, prompting the same from Draco. “I can’t change what’s happened, or how difficult things are going to be for us for a while, but I can at least give you this piece of advice and hope that you use it.
Draco didn't say anything. Instead he dropped their clothes in a heap on top of his trunk and then got into bed. Harry grinned and got in beside him.
Something that felt like a cold pebble of dread dropped into Draco’s stomach. He set down the piece of toast he’d only just buttered and looked with drawn eyebrows across the desk at Harry.
Draco opens his mouth to argue but is suddenly unseated and rolled onto his back, at which point Potter assumes the position he’d been in previously and Draco’s too stunned by how quickly and effortlessly it had happened to do anything until his wrists are already pinned.
"You," he says. Potter frowns. "Just ... I wanted to see what it was like. Daphne, she was ... I heard her telling Pansy and Tracey ..." He swallows. "I wanted to see," he says again. And, mustering his courage: "When ... did you realise?"
have a huge prick,” Draco bit out, sliding his hand down the shaft and squeezing too hard on the upstroke. One of Potter’s hands caught Draco's wrist, and the strength he felt in that touch made him giddy.
"Fuck off, Potter!" Goyle repeated sharply. Harry closed his mouth reluctantly, more stunned than anything. "He doesn't wanna talk to you! Get it through your head!" And, when Harry still didn't move, "
“Here,” said Harry, throwing the Cloak over his head and leading him inside. The common room was utterly empty, rendering the precaution unnecessary, but he still left it on until they had closed the dormitory door behind them.
hear, but surmised for himself. Like how he’s ninety-nine percent sure Potter could see into the Dark Lord’s thoughts.
Usually when Draco wakes him up, Harry gives him one of those charmingly loose grins and says something stupid like “good morning, love” or “how did you sleep?”.
Ginny had asked him if he wanted to spend some time together earlier in the evening, and as much as a part of him genuinely would have liked to do that, he’d declined with the excuse that he was exhausted from the Quidditch conditioning he’d done before dinner (which
Defence Against the Dark Arts would have been by far the best class this year had it not been for the new professor’s penchant for using Harry as an aid in all his demonstrations. Even worse, he sometimes deferred to Harry’s judgment, at which point Harry would politely and somewhat awkwardly remind him that he was hardly an expert.
Potter must have seen in Draco’s eyes was what he was thinking, because he beat him to it — he leaned forward and pressed their lips together, nothing as forceful as it had been before, but enough to make Draco feel like he’d been melted down to a puddle of useless sludge.
"All right, well ... I'll probably be in the library the rest of the evening," Harry said, standing up. Malfoy glanced up, saw that the immediate threat was gone, and nodded.
Harry’s head falls back against a pillow and he lifts his hips again, searching for friction. He’s so hard it’s beginning to hurt now and he’s slightly lightheaded from the loss of blood to his brain.
It was ten after six when he walked out onto the pitch, flooded with lights. He saw a good deal of people high up in the air, soaring around the stadium on their brooms, while those in more professional-looking robes were standing in a group in the centre of the field. The only immediately-recognizable one out of the group from a distance, white-blond hair shining like a beacon, was Malfoy.
This was so unexpectedly profound that Draco could not, for several moments, locate his voice. He merely stared at Weasley, both dumbfounded and intrigued.
“Sirius Black,” Theo cut him off smoothly, not bothering to hide his amused grin this time. Draco’s jaw clenched.
With tear tracks drying on his cheeks, Harry tipped his head back and laughed, chasing away any lingering shadows of doubt.
"He knows he's a pointy git, 'Mione." Ron flashed him a smile and Draco rolled his eyes. Harry chose that moment to slide an arm round his waist. Draco marveled at the way it felt exactly the same as it always did. "Wasn't
“She went off on me like you wouldn’t bloody believe when I told her I wasn’t going,” he went on, ignoring Hermione’s tone entirely. “Should’ve heard the things she was saying. Told me that I haven’t got my priorities straight and I ought to start living up to my name.”
“Aw, thanks for protecting my face.” Harry realized he was teasing again, and flashed back to his thought from earlier — was he being friendly? or
“It really looks like you live here,” Ginny was saying now, pushing leftovers around on shelves. “More than Grimmauld did, even.”
“Can we do it together?” Harry felt like he was pleading, and maybe he was. It was strange being as clothed as they were, as naked as their words were, sex just seconds behind them. “Figure out what’s next?”
This time there was no reason not to touch each other, not to bump back and forth and snatch the Snitch back and forth, teasing and kissing and nearly falling out of the air. Hovering a hundred metres above the grounds didn’t do nearly as much to make Harry feel like he was floating as the brush of Draco’s cold fingers on his chin, the leftover tastes of fennel and turmeric that were hidden away on his tongue.
“People aren’t going to like it,” Neville warned him, meeting Harry’s eyes with his freckle-framed ones. The laughter in his expression had faded, but his eyes still looked soft. “I don’t trust him, and it will probably end badly. But we’ll back you up, like always.”
“My father was so stupid,” he whispered. When Harry waited, he cleared his throat and kept talking. “I knew he was unkind. I knew he was vain. I knew he was… I knew him. But I never thought that he was stupid. I just thought he was doing the wrong things. Even when it was follow or die, when following was killing me… I thought he believed in what he was doing.”
Harry nodded, then remembered that Draco couldn’t see. “Yeah.” He was surprised that Draco was so perceptive, but then, Malfoy had had very few people to talk to for the last year. Especially the last few months. It wasn’t any surprise that he’d be more thoughtful than Harry remembered. He’d always been smart, and it wasn’t like they’d talked much before.
Despite the work it had taken to get Draco this far, Harry himself hadn’t put much planning into his idea. He had said it to be spontaneous, half-certain that Draco would say no immediately. While they’d redressed, he’d thought over a hundred places, of showing Draco Paris or Privet Drive, whirling through alleyways or awful memories. They could go anywhere, do anything, and that was too much to choose from. He wanted to give Draco a good impression of the muggle world, but in the end he’d rejected grand plans for the London Eye or the Eiffel Tower. He’d wanted to show Draco what the muggle world was to him.
And now he had it, his hips meeting Draco’s tensed-up thighs, his dick wrapped almost painfully within the strength of Draco’s body. Draco’s eyes were still open, and they met Harry’s steadily when he managed to look away from the meeting of their bodies. Harry stretched over him slowly, shifting bit by bit until Draco raised his eyebrows, discomfort and demand at war on his face. “Well?” he asked, squirming in a way that gave away the discomfort that his words didn’t.
“I’ll dive into this and Floo call tomorrow,” Zara said, shaking Harry’s hand before turning to Draco and clasping him by the shoulder. “It will be alright. It’s going to be tricky going, but a lot of the law is on our side. I’ll have the death certificate overthrown and new ownership paperwork drawn up just in case — I can move faster on that than the Ministry can freeze things.” Hermione had explained the plan to her, how they wanted to keep the home in Harry’s name in case Draco went to trial and stood to lose it. She’d draw up multiple contracts, see which stuck. “More than you expected to inherit in the Manor there, eh, Mr. Potter?”
“No, not that. That’s the only good lie I told. But about being scared. About not wanting to do it. We all had to pretend that it was such an honor, following his commands, and maybe if I had… had told them…”
They traced their normal paths, zigging and zagging the entire way. Draco had shown Harry how throwing a Bludger at the manor would make the manor shoot it right back, and they ran drills for the better part of an hour. Draco seemed stronger now. He tried a Woollongong Shimmy and a near-perfect Sloth Grip Roll, flying with a fervor that Harry hadn’t seen from him in years. He was panting when they touched down, his hair stuck all over his forehead like he’d just gotten fringe. Harry smirked, but refrained from saying anything, since his own hair was likely worse.
Still, he didn’t want to disturb their reluctant truce to the point of breaking, so he redoubled his efforts to find another bowtruckle. Harry ran his fingers through the undergrowth, watching his chewed-on, much-scarred fingers spread out through leaf after tumbling leaf. After a moment, something moved at the touch of his hand, and he found himself lifting another strange creature to his face. The bowtruckle looked just like plant life, its camouflage better than any butterfly. A curious little face peered up at Harry. He grinned, delighted.
Draco caught Harry’s eye briefly next, but looked away from whatever he saw there, drawn back instantly to Pansy’s frenetic words.
Harry was left kneeling on a bridge in the twilight, his knees burning and his nose on fire. He moved his hand through the air that Draco had left behind, breaking the Statue of Secrecy, putting himself at risk to go home and hide.
“Oh, fancy giving half the house back?” Harry crunched into the last corner of toast, getting butter on his fingers and some crumbs on the counter. He looked for a tea towel, and then Vanished them instead.
“He is fucking stupid.” This was aimed at Hermione now, although Harry could tell it was for his benefit. The anger that he’d built up at the Manor kicked back in, this time aimed at Ron, at Hermione’s helpless shrug.
Things were normal again now, the new normal that was easy banter and endless shoving - though each brush of contact made something dark flutter in his gut. It was all too easy to get caught up in some stupid conversation, something about apricots and Harry’s apelike clothing choices, the obvious pointing out of Draco wearing Harry’s clothes, the furious backtracking. The rap at the door took them both by surprise.
If they took Draco in before the paperwork was filed, the Manor would stay in Harry’s possession until after the Ministry had decided what to do with Draco, which would remove all possibility of house arrest and make parole impossible. If they waited too long, Draco would be arrested by unsympathetic, fully-fledged Aurors who would doubtless do their worst. If Harry released entire ownership of the home to Draco, the Ministry might try to force a sale or seizure as reparations. Every angle of it was tetchy, and there was only one way to do things right. Pansy and Ron would be an essential part — they were meant to tell the Ministry that they had tracked Draco to France and brought him back home, where he had come willingly. Harry wasn’t sure how he was supposed to explain why he would sign half home over, but Hermione reckoned it would help Draco’s case to have proof that Harry Potter had welcomed Draco back to the Manor in good faith, yet with caution. She was hopeful that it would guarantee him a spot on the witness stand, where he could throw his weight behind Draco’s character reference.
It turned out that Lucius Malfoy had been something of a secret dork. They found the game boards in the bottom left corner of the enormous oak desk, under a stack of Martin Miggs comics. “
They paged through the comics next. Draco scoffed at Marvin the Mad Muggle’s misadventures in space, and it took Harry a half hour to convince him that muggles actually had made it to the moon. They ended up back in the living room, where Harry searched his collection for educational films, and settled on Star Wars. That only confused Malfoy more, and he spent the first hour pointing out what technology was clearly magical, and which aliens were based on Ukrainian merpeople. Harry gave up.
“Apparently it isn’t, since you seem to need help remembering.” Draco turned, Harry’s proximity trapping him back against the counter’s edge. Harry put his arms out to trap him there and leaned in, but Draco put a hand across his face and kept it there, his fingers smudging Harry’s glasses. “I honestly don’t know what to do with you.”
Harry couldn’t seem to relax, though. He was in disbelief, still, and a part of him felt near-frozen in shock. The touch of Draco’s hand had done something to him, something that felt heavy and permanent.
“Hey,” Harry responded, not sure if Draco could tolerate outright kindness, or if he was better off saying something along the lines of
Why was he so afraid to have anything good? Why did he have to ruin everything the moment he had the tentative approval of his friends, as soon as Draco wanted him too, in whatever capacity?
He didn’t want to leave the safety and peace of the theater, not really, but a teenager came in with a broom and dustpan and they let themselves be kicked out. It was the best date Harry had ever been on, and it wasn’t even a date.
It was daylight now, for one thing, and while he hadn’t quite still been drunk the night before, he was straightforwardly sober now. Draco looked nervous again, the way he had on the streets of London, and Harry reached out to clasp his wrist on instinct, before those nerves made him say something mean. They both glanced down, seeing the loose grip, the stark difference in their coloring. It wasn’t the touch that was shocking, really, it was just… being
“I certainly did.” Draco leaned back to look him over, and Harry tried to look more confident than he’d felt. Years of Quidditch practice had fallen to the side, and the months of starving in the woods had taken a while to feel behind him. Only now was flying and working the gardens and fighting or sleeping with Draco making him feel normal in his skin again. Draco’s gaze on him was sharp and bright, but it wasn’t critical. It didn’t seem possible that Draco could be as deep-down satisfied as it made Harry, to have his body against his. Like scratching an itch he’d had for half his life.
“Has — what?” Harry had to wipe his mouth with the back of his hand. He’d almost spat his beer out, and his friends looked on him with bright amusement.
. His presence woke Harry up, and he propped himself back up without saying anything. Eventually Draco perched on the other arm of the couch, fidgeting with his knee. He was wearing his old clothes, but the knees looked worn, the black trousers less than black.
Draco didn’t respond, so Harry knocked an all-clear onto the wall and went to tidy the kitchen. Maybe Draco was embarrassed at his reaction: he’d looked afraid enough. And he’d said
A bus rattled up to them, and Draco’s head jerked up. Harry waved it on, and it pulled away. The moment of rumbling broke the pause, Draco continued.
They appeared in the alleyway outside the Ministry, Harry swearing angrily as he threw the phone booth open wandlessly, violently enough to slam against the frame. He punched the numbers in too fast, messing it up the first time. Hermione took over, and he put his hands over his face as the booth spun them into the Ministry hallway.
Hermione swore as she kicked a box open. Clothes spilled out, and she Accioed jeans and Keds. She didn’t waste time with modesty, instead stripping down to a cotton bralette and clashing panties, catching the t-shirt Harry unearthed to toss at her. She was dressed in seconds, the backs of her shoes flattened under her sockless heels, her shirt declaring her a St. Mungo’s Donor in flashing cartoon letters. And then she grabbed Harry’s hand, and they Apparated away.
Harry stared at the ceiling. He’d gone back to the Florentine guest room, and its gilded canopy twinkled gaudily at him in the light of the morning. A fat angel painted onto the crown moulding was peeking in at him: he rolled over. Now he could see the door, dust motes floating in the sunlight between. How could it be, that past that door, was the sum of his summer? A patched-up mansion, a former enemy? Not Auror training, not Hogwarts classes, not the friends or family that had seem him to his eighteenth summer. Everyone who had been at his birthday party had barely mattered since.
“I know.” Draco brushed his fingers across Harry’s knee, which made him start until he realized that Draco was reaching for the bottle. He handed it over. “I meant we’re both idiots.”
It was insanity, plummeting sharply downward with the wind everywhere but his lungs, jerking the broom back up and just barely clamping in with his knees. He climbed back up in the air, jerky and still breathless, a shot of joy stabbed through him. He’d been flying on his own here, but it hadn’t felt like this.
They swept over the gardens, and the small pond that the koi had come from, and a hedge that seemed to be hiding the concrete remains of an enormous wizard’s chess set.
“She did!” Hermione smirked at Ron, who went pink and happy. “I meant to tell you, I found out yesterday.”
“Too right,” Shacklebolt agreed, and reached over to press Harry’s wrist. “Just give us a few minutes, son. You may find I‘m in a position to help.”
Days leading up to Halloween, however, Draco observed Harry’s healthy tan taking on a sickly pallid; sunken purplish dents resided under his eyes and his pale skin stretched taut and thin across his face, making his cheekbones jut out highly. He was lagging on schoolworks, and even Granger and Weasley can’t do anything about Harry’s state of sudden withdrawal even if, Draco had seen, how much they wanted to encourage Harry out of it.
“What do you take me for, Harry?” Draco said quietly. His broken voice and openly hurt expression pierced through Harry’s heart. “Am I always a Death Eater to you? After everything that—” he stopped short, looking away and pulling his sleeves down. He jutted his chin, fortifying his expression. “Well, it was good to know that some things never change. Like how you always see me as the unworthy scum whom you are forced to deal with, but in reality you were just as well as everyone else. Thank you for making me feel like an utter fool, Potter.”
Draco, on the map, looked like he was hesitating. The dot moved to where Harry had supposed the door to the Room of Requirements appeared but suddenly halted, then pacing agitatedly back and forth, as if he couldn’t make up his mind. When Harry saw him in person, however, Draco was looking worse for wear. He was far from the pristine and aristocratic image he often bear. He was practically juddering with distraught energy, and his shoulders was clearly shaking even at a distance where Harry stood.
But Harry couldn’t just deny the fact that, no matter how much he hated the idea of, it was purgative. It was better than reading the latest installment of The Memoirs of Saturnine the Villain and re-reading it all over again in cold detachment for him to avoid any sentimentalities. Harry didn’t know he needed it until he felt the inducing, healing hands reaching out to his soul; Draco’s somber gaze, open and expressive eyes, and coaxing words shrouding all the uncertainties and fears he accumulated throughout his troubled life, irradiating contentment and ease through him that he hadn’t quite known before. Somehow, it felt like the Imperius, though it wasn’t sharp and invasive; it rather felt like an embrace of warmth and gentleness.
Harry curled lightly to himself, and Draco fit behind him snuggly, his chest to Harry's back and knees folding behind the Gryffindor's. Harry tensed briefly before he gradually melted against the blond's chest, their shoulders aligning. This was the feeling of being held, of being pulled closer, of having the warmth of a body behind you, another person's arm around your torso; and it's entirely a piece of small heaven that Harry was missing out on his entire life.
acts as the mediator, Harry honestly didn't initially understand how it would work. Fifteen minutes since they both drank their potions, Harry still couldn't grasp the concept behind it.
If felt... right, telling Draco one of the many reasons why he was fucked up. Inviting; like a the breathe of fresh air after hours of inhaling the cupboard’s damp smell or relieving a kink from a day’s worth of tension.
Draco smiled feebly, though his eyes still held the same look of self-contempt Harry doesn't want to see swimming in those bedazzling grey eyes. He simply hated seeing Draco wallowing in shame over his actions that couldn't be controlled. "And you shouldn't really care if your actions are befitting or not. No one could maintain a proper person in the face of great emotions."
With a bolt of speed, Draco bounded down the stairs to the group of Gryffindors lounging by the fire in the Common Room.
Harry closed his eyes, as the onslaught of feelings he forgot he had assaulted him all at once. Lungs burning with the violent sorrow, a pathetic drive to whimper clawing at his throat to be freed, Harry about-turn as he heard Malfoy inhaled. He desperately clamped on the urge to sob, blinking fast at the prickling of his eyelids, unshed tears blurring his sight.
The familiar snarky voice of his schoolboy rival snapped at his trance. Harry turned to see Draco Malfoy's sneering face, grey eyes sharp with his signature haughty condescension.
"Which is why it could very well be a compromising grounds for both the pair," Hermione said, her voice going a tad bit tetchier. "Since the potions solely target emotions, and emotions are already subjected to constant change as they are, the potions could propel the participants to do things without consent and will power, and yield to the others' commands that could possibly encourage nonconsensual exploits between them."
"Poor Potter," Parkinson chuckled, sounding pleased for Harry's expanse. "Quite bereft of a lover, aren't you? It would be a pleasure to show you what me and Ginny—"
Harry almost jump, and he realized it must've been weird and creepy outright staring at his own nemesis and wondering why in buggering hell can't he get this year normal.
“Did you know Warden’s parents were killed during the first War of the Worlds?” Harry quietly said. Draco stared at Harry, gauging his expression, before sitting down in front of him.
Draco raised his brows, “heard of it. It doesn’t have any proof, so I don’t have any reasons to believe.” He shrugged. Harry looked at him solemnly.
"Do you want to sleep?" Harry asked, pink-faced, faces still inches from each other, a thrum of warmth bubbling just beneath his skin. Draco's grey eyes held the brightest and most beautiful constellations he had ever seen.
Harry slowly shook his head. He didn't think it's appropriate to talk about their tangled past, potentially destroying the temporary peace and contentment between them. Harry loved this limited safe space,
They transfigured the sofa to make it bigger, and Harry wrapped the blanket around them. The fire in the hearth was smoldered, and they cuddled closer for extra warmth, though Harry didn't need more of it as his insides felt too close to combusting. Draco laid half on top of him, his head on top of his chest and Harry was afraid Draco might hear the thunderous bang of his heart against his chest. He smelt of vanilla with a citrusy blend and Harry loved it, he loved the silky strands that tickled his nostrils.
“What does it look like?” Draco sat back down on the floor. He was wearing charcoal trousers and a white undershirt now, and Harry had assumed that he was picking through the clothing to find a shirt to wear with it. But as he watched, Draco dug through the pockets of a winter coat, using his wand to lift every scrap of lint to his eyes for inspection.
“Killing’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he murmured, and then some bubbles tilted down into his eye, and the tense conversation was broken up by splashing and eye-rubbing and cautious laughter.
He yanked his trousers and boxers down as one, half-tripping over them as he stumbled forward a little, reaching for his shirt even as he caught himself. He yanked that off next, pulling his glasses off his face with the violent motion. They hit the floor somewhere in front of him, but he could hear better than see where. “Fuck,” he said, kicking blindly, somehow more irritated than before now. “Fuck!” He dropped down to hunt for the glasses, searching and naked and entirely furious.
“What’s it about, then? You’ve been weird all summer, mate, and now this? Who am I supposed to go through training with? Who am I going to partner with? What the hell are you going to do?”
“Don’t be sorry for getting away from that idiot.” Draco brushed his pants off. “I didn’t know you knew.”
It was beautiful, though. Without the people and the spells and the violence that had filled it, it was almost just… a house. A huge house, that was more like wandering alone through a closed-down museum, but it had been a home once, too. Harry tried to imagine a young Draco Malfoy running through the gardens, and was surprised to realize that he could picture it easily. Some tiny, imperious little boy, demanding the world without any idea that he’d barely live to see it.
“It’s not a house,” he insisted. A gnome broke free of Ginny, and escaped between Harry’s legs. She huffed at him. “It’s not! It’s a fucking torture chamber with about a thousand years of dark magic inside of it. You don’t want that.”
“I don’t want you to take care of me,” Draco warned, sitting up in bed now. Harry’s eyes had adjusted just enough to the dark to see the shine of his hair, the familiar color like moonlit silver. “If you come back, I don’t want to rely on you. It’s been driving me mad.”
Harry laughed, his confusion and tangled feelings finally evening out into something that made sense to him. “You’re so weak!” He shoved Draco back, and Draco threw a jacket into the air to climb over the pile for a better angle.
“Good afternoon,” he said to a portrait on the way out. “I know what day it is.” It didn’t say anything back, but he saw it blink at him as he walked away.
Pansy found Harry in the hallway before she left. They’d had a strange lunch, of sorts, where everyone but Ron barely touched their food, and the talk had all been tense and strategic. Harry weighed in where he had to, but mostly picked at his food and tried unsuccessfully to catch Draco’s eye again.
“You saved everyone,” Draco told him back. “You really did it.” And Harry believed it for the first time, felt his throat close on the panic and the pain and the relief of it, the sacrifice and confusion and vestiges of rotting, leftover fear. He swallowed it, and a little piece of ugliness stayed down.
The curtains came down with a good yank, and he shook them out over the floor, walking across them as he Charmed them all white. When they were back up they made the newly-emptied room feel more modern, and Harry took his shirt off to keep working. A few hours later, he’d Transfigured all the ornate bergères into squashy sofas and armchairs, changed the walls from damask to dark grey, and turned the curtains into one enormous, stiff piece of fabric. The projector didn’t want to work, unsurprisingly, but he fed it some magic until it kicked into life, spitting distorted images onto the curtain until he used a sticking spell to keep it high on the wall.
It had started getting dark while they watched the movie, and they emerged into a cooling world, brushed with elongated shadows. More people were on the street now, heading home from their jobs to their families, and they crowds pushed them a little closer together as they went down the street, both lost in thought. Harry wanted to hold Draco’s hand again, but the dark of the theater and the swell of Casablanca’s score were gone. Instead he held tight to their bag of goodies and tried to see things through Draco’s eyes. He must have be exhausted, taking it all in, but he hadn’t said anything about going home yet.
“It does,” Hermione agreed, joining them now. Her shoulders were stiff but she’d thrown her head up straight and Ron slid in behind her, his hand going to rest on the back of her neck. “It’s much more you now, Harry.”
In the end they got beer. The York was stodgy and ancient, and it looked enough like the Hog’s Head that Harry thought Draco might feel at home. It seemed to be working, at least once he’d finished his first pint, and started looking around at people freely.
It was the work of a minute to put the package away, and then Harry took the time to feed the koi and say good morning to a few carved serpents around the first floor before looking for Draco.
“Engorgio,” he murmured, and the armchair widened, allowing them to lean back together, curled up like a set of puppies in one exhausted pile. Harry didn’t know what else to say, and Draco didn’t volunteer anything. He just tucked Harry under his arm until the fire burned out, and they were left in the dark.
“Helps you commune with the house’s magic? Makes perfect sense, Harry, I was just proving a point. Anyway, about her ideas—”
“No, no, no,” Ron lamented, and Harry shut his eyes, and they jostled each other into a tight grip that felt, to Harry, like every other time they’d hugged like this, Quidditch victories and reunions and the terrifying joy of having survived something awful together.
“We used to have horses,” Draco said suddenly, shading his eyes. He looked like he was miles away, seeing something from another time. “My dad got really into horse racing.”
“Is this like Back to the Future?” Draco asked at full volume as they slid into the dark theater, and Harry had to fight the urge to laugh.
“I do,”  Draco said, still in that soft voice. “Is that —you think I won’t be safe? And so you’re worried and being weird?”
Harry frowned. Lucius and Narcissa had clearly loved each other, it was true, but it was odd to compare them to Ron and Hermione. And did Draco mean they had left him out of their bond? He’d always thought the Malfoys were a trio. Either way, it was sad that Draco didn’t have them anymore, either to complete the trio or to welcome him in.
It was strange to stand together, cooking and preparing, rustling up dinner and dessert and some hot drinks. But it was stranger still to carry it to the couch, sitting together in the mess of overstuffed pillows. Harry had gotten rid of the dining room table, and they piled the trunk he’d dragged in with plates and mugs.
Draco had covered the stain up to his satisfaction, and was reaching for the sealant. “Which one?” He uncapped it with one hand, holding the broom in place so it didn’t roll and muck up the new varnish. “The twin, I expect.”
“Of course you are.” Draco flapped his hand. “You know you are. You’re going to work with that blond idiot, and you’ll fuck off back to your Weasels, and I’ll just be the ghost that haunts your second home. It’s all very Pureblood of you, honestly. And me, if I die soon and do it properly.”
Harry clambered into the windowsill and looked back down. Below, one of the fountains was bubbling away, its tiles shifting through mythological mosaics.
Ron was going to bring her over at lunchtime, as soon as they had a break in their training, but Draco was up at the crack of dawn. Harry watched him putter around again, faking sleep from his position in bed. Draco was too distracted to even touch, the last few days, and Harry could recognize the signs of a person preparing for battle. He’d been messy-haired and laser-eyed, but today he dressed and arranged himself with military precision. First the robes, which he held up to the light before hitting with a steaming spell, and then the shoes, which Draco shone by hand. Lastly he rubbed a few  potions into his skin and tapped a frame on his desk with his wand, which turned into a mirror. Harry had to roll onto his side to watch Draco arrange his hair back into its strict slick style, which sent a strange wave of nostalgic regret through Harry that was hard to name.
“Some Seeker.” Draco seemed strangely upright. He held it together all the way down the stairs, while Harry had to clutch the railing. He didn’t mind, but it kind of hurt his eyes how the bright top of Draco’s head kept blurring into the magically-enhanced candlelight from the chandeliers overhead.
The Aurors looked up as Harry and Hermione passed by, one of them jumping up to say “Here, now, aren’t you-” as another said “Excuse me, this floor is private-” and Harry ignored them all as he strode past and tried the door. It was locked tight, but he was angry enough to
“Who’s your partner?” Harry asked miserably when they let go of each other, and tried to blink his tears back discreetly.
Oops. That hadn’t been kind. But she seized on it anyway, expression lit up like he’d given something away. “Draco, is it? What kind of relationship are you hiding from the Ministry, anyway? You’ve always hated him.”
“Perfect.” Ron looked relieved to be excused. Harry didn’t blame him: he had a girlfriend to go back to, Molly’s leftovers, a place that was simply dirty instead of possibly evil. “Well, good luck.”
Draco was hesitant, he could see that immediately. Afraid, even, but Harry thought that might be more to do with leaving the manor and less with the muggles. “I’ve never been,” he admitted, shifting on the grass. One of the peacocks came pecking closer, and Draco splashed at it absently. “I mean, I’ve gone to King’s Cross and the farms around here, but not their cities. Is it safe?”
They stayed in the cupboard for a little longer, sitting together but alone in their thoughts. Eventually Harry remembered the leftovers, and Draco stood when he mentioned them. He looked down at Harry, clearly hesitating, and then stuck out a hand to help him up. “Harry?”
“I told you, safety.” Draco sounded calmer now, more openly sad. He kept his eyes closed, so Harry didn’t stop petting his hair once it was fixed. He risked rubbing a thumb over Draco’s ear, and it was softer than it looked. Draco’s breath caught, and Harry pulled his hand reluctantly away.
“What does that even mean?” Harry thought briefly of Adrian Pucey and the other queer Quidditch players he’d known. They’d all flown well, at least to his eyes. But maybe it made sense that an ancient statue would have outdated ideas.
“Thank you.” Harry turned from the drawer and smiled at him. Draco turned away, but Harry thought he might have been about to smile back.
If Draco were free, he could choose someone else, something else. He would help, of course, but something small and anxious had started to burn in Harry’s chest as soon as this new thing had settled between them. In a way, it felt comforting, since Harry had never had anything stay good or calm for long. A part of him had been waiting, was still waiting, for the catch.
“You need to stop creeping around listening to people’s conversations,” he answered, without any heat.
“If nothing else, you’ll always have that Malfoy blonde,” Harry said, and then regretted making the joke, but Draco surprised him with a smile.
“What, mate?” It was Ron, popping up into Harry’s line of vision half-dressed. “Is something wrong?”
“So, er.” Draco turned toward him expectantly, and Harry found he had nothing to say. He didn’t want to talk about anything heavy, not really, and tackling the unsolved matter of Malfoy’s continued existence seemed like it would take more than coffee. In the face of Draco’s mild grey stare, he only found himself able to say, “what are you up to today?”
“No Legilimency,” he said half-heartedly, But he had known that she would know. She always knew. “All right, a little bit. Maybe. I don’t know but probably. How did you guess?”
“So you don’t want me to leave, but you expect me to? Even though I’m saying I won’t. “ Harry didn’t try to hide his frustration from Draco. He’d hidden it from the Aurors, tried to control it in front of his friends. With Draco, he finally felt like he could roll his eyes. “Since when did you even want me to stay?”
Harry found wine and a carved wooden tray in the pantry and brought them up to the guest bathroom, which was a stodgy marble affair, all gilded faucets and permanently-blooming orchids. A stained glass wall was charmed to overlook the grounds, where late afternoon light was leeching in. By now Hermione would be at Hogwarts, but for once Harry felt okay about being holed up in the manor instead.
“Why can’t he come now? We’ve told your mum he’s coming!” Harry rolled his eyes, letting them squabble. Ron was pretty good at derailing Hermione when she got too pushy. He’d agree to next week, and they’d go, and Harry would feel guilty but at least Ron wouldn’t give him shit, they just had to talk for another moment and then —
“Can we Apparate from here?” Harry reached down his legs to roll his pants back down, but Draco huffed at him before standing.
“The restorations are done, at least, so I’ll have access to everything I need on-campus,” she finally concluded that day, lifting her mug to her lips before discovering that she’d drained it in her distraction.
“Gee, thanks. I just love having my life in your hands.” But the sarcasm belied Draco’s real fear. Harry paused, waited for him to get it all out. “Just another day where Potter can handle it. Where Potter decides who lives and who dies. You couldn’t just leave me with Greg in the Room of Requirement, no, you had to keep me alive to waste away in my ancestral home. Thanks. I don’t feel like waiting around for you to get bored of leaving bowls of water out for me.”
Harry rather thought the world was safer than Draco was implying, but the panic that had kicked into both of them with a knock on the door stopped him. “I’ll find out about your account,” Harry promised. “I can ask the Ministry, and I’ll make sure you have access to it if you’re worried.”
So “Fuck you,” he managed, eyes suddenly smarting. “Just get eaten by the house, then. You deserve each other.”
“You know what I mean.” Harry started chopping while he got them out. “Would you mind heating some butter?”
“You might have to,” Ron sighed. “Bad luck, mate. And there’s one more thing… they’ve paired us with partners already, to train with. I just got mine.”
, Harry reminded himself, although he didn’t know why. It wasn’t like he wanted Malfoy to be alive, he just… didn’t want him dead, either. Even if the rest of the world was happy to presume him gone, Harry felt vaguely like Draco would show up at any moment to kick him out, insulting his friends the whole way.
“I’m glad.” Harry couldn’t help the smile that broke over his face, and the watery, small smile Draco gave him in response felt like winning the Quidditch World Cup.
“Do you think I’m hiding?” he asked, surprised, but she just shrugged at him in her Luna way before departing, a bottle of antique wine in each hand.
It was an awkward surge, a bump of noses that sent an arc of excruciating pain through Harry’s face. But Draco’s mouth was cool and stretched in a scowl that changed, subtly, into something softer.
“I just don’t like this feeling that it’s a given that I have to do or be a certain thing, when I’ve never tried anything else, you know?” He shrugged.
“You don’t blame my dad?” Draco scoffed at him and handed the wine back. Harry brushed his wrist when he took it, holding Draco’s eyes.
A bicyclist went past on the opposite side of the road, followed by a taxicab. A man took the trash out from the back of a restaurant. And Draco watched it all as though it were brand new.
was surprised, not at the Sorting Hat, but at the strange sort of comfort he’d started deriving from the manor and its strange hidden inhabitant. A month ago he was throwing fits of accidental magic again, as though he were ten years old and missing out on a whole world he’d never thought to imagine. Now he was laughing again, sharing things with Malfoy, cheating at chess just to drive him crazy.
“I’m pureblood,” she confided. “Sacred twenty-eight, on my mom’s side. Of course my dad took her name, you know how that whole thing goes.”
At one point Harry looked over and Draco was crying, silent tears just barely escaping his lower eyelashes to his underfull cheeks.
“You’ll leave when this is all over, then?” Draco’s voice was calm, but he’d straightened his back until he looked a bit like Lucius, in the dark.
Harry had gotten up early to have breakfast with Ron and Hermione at the Burrow, as he had all week. Ron was going back and forth now, packing up again for the flat in Hogsmeade. The start of the semester and the Auror sign-ups were coming up quickly, and each day had become busy for them, each morning catch-up precious. Harry skipped his morning flights to go now, knowing he could come back and chase Draco through the grounds all day once he’d done his duty to friends and family. It felt good to get out, too, remember the people he loved and his life outside of the manor. At least when that life was private, and comfortable, and stocked with Molly’s cooking.
“You’re leaving, then?” Draco looked more exhausted than he had when Harry had first found him, had mistaken him for a ghost. “As discussed?”
. He felt, somehow, that he would know. Someone would have told him. Or something would have shifted in the universe, some final veil unlifting like it had when Voldemort had died. Not like Malfoy was anything like Voldemort.
He walked into the newsagents reluctantly. A small man looked up and smiled at the doors’ jingle, warm eyes the color of mud fixing on Harry from between a mop of grey hair and the most wrinkled little body Harry had ever seen outside of a raisin. “Ah, Mr. Potter,” he said, voice as small yet warm as the rest of him, “what can I do for the man who sells most of my papers?”
The last words had the stink of Hermione all over them, and Harry finally opened his eyes to study her. He found her already looking at him, her rich redwood eyes seeing, as always, to the heart of him
Draco stilled, then softened, and they pressed back into each other without any of the urgent need that had taken over them an hour before. Their kiss was soft, sustained, and reassuring to Harry in a way that he needed. He broke off with a smile. “Sorry about my hair, I tried.”
“Thanks, Nev,” Harry said, touched. Luna nodded her agreement and he raised his stubby bottle of beer. They cheersed, spilling some of Luna’s Red Stripe and foaming up Harry’s, but he felt a lot better for having it out there.
,” Draco hissed, and shoved him. Harry hadn’t even realized he’d stepped close again, but Draco’s push sent him stumbling back on the bridge’s slope. So he did what his raging magic and complicated feelings and history with Malfoy had always made him do: he dug his heels in and swung.
“Maybe we don’t go in, then.” He nodded past Draco at the sidewalk they’d just come down. “Head that way?”
“I fucking swear that I told you to shut up,” Draco said again, and then leaned forward, the blankets between them shifting as loudly as crashing waves. It took him a thousand years to cross the inches between them, and Harry felt the years within each second as acutely as any pain he had ever felt in his short, painful life.
Instead he watched the peacocks and scooted a little closer to Draco. Draco leaned in, pressing his chest to the side of Harry’s shoulder. Harry held his breath until they were wedged solidly together, until he could smell Draco’s Quidditch sweat, until his heart settled back to beating.
He was too furious, fuming, consumed with thought. He didn’t even remember through the pain and the anger what he looked like, until he opened the front door and Hermione stuck her wand in his face.
“You’ll be back in a day, Harry,” she argued, rolling her eyes at him. “You’re really assuming a lot of my ovulation cycle if you think-”
Harry bumped up against Draco again, distracted, and reached out to palm the softness of his hair. Draco took a break from his Snitch scanning to glance at him, then took him in properly. “Alright, Potter?”
“They got over that, you’re dead now,” Harry assured him, and had a crumpled paper tossed at him in response.
, I am not a ghost!” Draco threw his wand down and crossed the distance between them, reaching out his hand —
right, I’ll always be a Malfoy. And I need your help with everything, I’ll owe you everything, again.”
Harry backed up to let her in, surprised. “You didn’t have to come over.” If Hermione had good reason not to come back, certainly Luna had even more of one. But she stepped forward, unconcerned, ignoring Harry now to wander over to the window. She sniffed the air, then went around a corner. Harry, bemused, trailed after her.
.” Harry sat all the way down on the floor. He picked up a shirt at random — it looked like a souvenir from the World Cup, and it felt like another world in which they’d both gone, Lucius and Fred alive beside them. “I’m not going anywhere and I’m not going to let that happen.”
Upstairs looked untouched, as though Draco had disappeared again, back into that uncertain space where Harry had thought him dead. Harry’s breath wasn’t coming out right. It felt strangled in his chest by a tightness that hurt.
“Yeah, we thought we’d stop by in person!” Savage chirped. “After all, we’ll be working side by side soon enough. What are you doing in this creepy old place?”
“And I’d keep your relationship out of it until after the trial, if you could,” she was saying, when the Floo flared again and Ron and Pansy entered.
After the fourth or sixth drink, things stopped feeling so strange. It was just a party, and every party was the same, regardless of the strangeness of its setting. Quidditch players doing more shots in the kitchen. Hermione relaxed enough to lecture a nodding Hannah. A group of Ravenclaw girls giggling at a portrait, with the ancient Malfoy inside glaring back in offense. Neville magically sorting through someone’s weed for salvageable seeds to germinate. His friends turned the manor into a common room, and he’d missed them all.
Dean nodded, missing the way Harry flinched at for good. “Club Godric! Now take this.” He shoved the box at Ron, who took it and tossed it roughly into the living room. “Nice.”
The Aurors took up a whole floor, and once they arrived Harry realized he recognized it. An enormous bullpen took up most of the space, a warren of cubicles littered with floating pot plants and stuck-up posters of moving criminals. Doors all along the walls lead to Robard‘s office and interview rooms, with a break room and bathroom along the far corner.
He smoked a gross Dwarvish cigar and judged a Charms contest, where Padma and Luna raced Levitating footstools around the room. He held Neville’s growing hair back when he got sick in the garden, moaning all the while about the rarity of the plants he was puking on. He even made out with Dean and Ginny, just a little, but let them go upstairs without him.
Harry emerged from his drunkenness slowly, nodding quietly through hours of conversation about everyone’s exciting new life plans, eventually accepting a cup of tea that Luna appeared with at some point. She had a whole teapot hovering behind her with a little army of cups, actually, and he was fairly sure that none of them were from the manor.
Draco shrugged: in the dark, Harry could only tell from the shifting of the coverlet. “She said it’s okay to hide sometimes.”
The warmth behind their bickering dissipated in an instant. Draco swung his head up to stare into Harry’s face, his eyes huge. “Did you—”
“Don’t worry,” Harry assured them both, squeezing them before letting go. “I just want to hang out at home for the next year.”
Apart from the books, there wasn’t much sign of a personality in Draco’s room. Harry lingered at a chest of drawers, touching each thing atop it: a vial of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion, a bowl of bizarre candy that was mostly blood-flavoured lollipops and peppermint toads, and a potted plant with a little floating cloud hovering above it, raining slightly.
"How many times I told you before you—" Harry abruptly stopped, realising what Draco had said prior. "You're in danger."
Of all things that was worth to fret over in Hermione's admission, it had to be that part. If it were Ron two years ago, he would've marched over her sister and gave her an earful about his anti-Slytherin prejudice.
The three of them walked the remaining path toward the greying mausoleum. Its wrought-iron gate was already open, the layers of Warming Charm conditioned at the threshold brushing over his chilled body as they made an entrance. There were a few people who attended, and those who filled the pews were Draco's Slytherin friends. All of them bar Snape, with his hooked-nose and jet-black eyes offering them a small derisive curl of lips before looking away, stared at Harry in surprise. Narcissa settled primly in the front row, Draco and Harry followed suit.
That was enough of a warning and Ginny walked out of the eighth year Common Room. Harry sat back on the loveseat and Malfoy fit himself beside Harry.
There was a tiny pained squeak before the animal was sprawled on the grass, its body uncontrollably shaking under the strength of Draco's curse. Harry tried to shout, but he found his throat was gripped with shock and panic it rendered him speechless and immobile.
Potions was hell for Harry, as usual. And it was even worse as Snape made it his everyday-goal to torment Harry. Even after knowing Snape had proven to be one of the essential figures that fought for the Light and had been a spy to protect him, Harry still had unresolved, buried grudges for the Potions Master for his tyrannical and unprofessional behavior throughout Harry's entire time at Hogwarts. Despite their roles during the war, Harry and Snape still senselessly loathed each other and Harry doesn't think it would start to change any moment. It was probably one of the few things that was fundamentally unchangeable after the war and will stay that way through the unforeseeable future.
"I will have no more of this useless, theatrical whinging Draco. You can let Potter, or in this case," Severus smirked nastily in retaliation, "yourself, to detonate the whole castle. Unless you want me to blast your airheads off myself, you can remove your pitiful selves out of my chambers. Now,
"I'll eat it, Ron," Harry said, taking a small bite as Ron shrugged his shoulders. Their attention moved to Hermione when she gasped in shock, a hand on her slightly gaped mouth.
For the first time in their years of friendship, Ginny's face flushed, coloring almost like her hair. Harry didn't realize she could blush that wildly, and he was hit with a brotherly protectiveness that was so distinct from the feeling he got when he saw her and Dean kissing in sixth year. Harry was glad he felt like a brother seeing his younger sister fawning over the person she fancied. If nothing else, it only attested to his true feelings for Ginny, and he was relieved to know it was certainly more brotherly and platonically than anything else.
"I bet you were rolling on your graves now. Father... Aunt Bella, everyone of you... because I can prove how fucking wrong you were, that your pathetic Dark Lord was wrong! I'm not weak, see? I can cast the Unforgivables! I can torture, I can kill! I can do anything! Because... b-because I'm... I'm s-strong..."
"It's your redheaded, little Weaslette, Potter," Draco nastily said, grey eyes growing sharper at Ginny. Harry touched his arms and pursed his lips at the blond, before turning to smile at Ginny's glowering face.
Harry stared at the few trinkets ornamentally placed above the rough-hewn table: a golden obelisk sat at the right side corner that glittered when it caught the light; a picture of a moving seaside, the sun glittering on the gently rippling waves; a small pendulum, attached against a triangular-shaped metal, that swung in a perfect arch. The table was impersonal, as with the state of the whole room; bare, white, so clinical. It was a temporary office but they should’ve done a little bit of effort to make it more bearable.
Harry had no time to react, and to wonder when the fuck did his friends' preference had swing the other way, as both the naked boys scrambled to get their clothes and bolt out of the room. The slamming of the door resounded through the silent eighth year Gryffindor boys' dorm.
needed Draco Malfoy's sneers, jeers of contempt, condescending grey eyes, and his awful mouth sputtering his usual awful tirades. Because those were
“No,” he snorted. Smiling, he let himself be permeated by yesterday’s memories. “I was surprised that we hadn’t reverted back to being the rivals that we used to before, since Quidditch always brings out our competitiveness. But I should hardly be surprised anymore. He’s not the person that I used to hate and... he was my Potions project partner and helped me a great deal.”
It was a soft command, though Harry never meant to sound it that way. Malfoy's face fell and he seemed to realize everything that he had done, because his eyes shone against the light, an unmistakable glint of remorse. Harry took everything in him to ignore the wild churning in his stomach and stood up, gripping Malfoy's arm tightly.
Draco tucked himself under Harry’s Gryffindor red blanket. There was an inch or three between them. Harry’s chest constricted, his arm that was close to Draco tingled and flushed. He closed his eyes tightly. This isn’t working. What was he even thinking? He knew in himself that he was fucked up, that he craved physical contact, one of the many things that were deprived of him as a child. It was another thing to crave physical contact from Draco Malfoy. Stupid, this isn’t working.
Harry belatedly realized that everyone sat beside their partners. Harry found Malfoy the only student not staring at him, sitting in the front row, his back ramrod straight. Harry pulled himself and walked to sit beside the blond. Snape continued his discussion.
"We are not blitzed out! The potions have no effects like the Draught of Euphoria or any substance that could addle the mind. I remember being completely sober—"
Not too good on the emotional aspect, was what his mind-healer diagnosed. Years of repressed emotions had reduced his ability to feel them. And, of course, diminished his sense of self-preservation. Hence all the stupid self-destructive streak.
Pansy looked strange in her Auror’s robes, the scarlet seemingly unnatural after years of seeing her in Slytherin green. Harry had forgotten, or never noticed, how beautiful her delicate features were, the upturned nose pixielike now that he saw it again. She was holding Draco tight, and the fierce love that was obvious between them made Harry almost forgive her for everything.
“We both were.” Draco lifted the botte and his chin as one, gesturing toward the front door. When he started walking, Harry followed, telling himself it was because of the bottle. “Come on then.”
There had been moments over the summer that Harry had wondered if he’d ever have the feelings he’d had as a young teen, lusting over Ginny and Cedric and Fleur Delacour. If his desires had been too muted from the Horcruxes and the trauma and the years without enough sleep to ever feel the way you ought to about a person. When he hadn’t been able to make it with Ginny, he’d thought he’d blown his shot at being with somebody that understood him. He’d been fine with that, even, to a degree. Wanting more than being alive seemed selfish, when so few people had been left with their lives. Wanting joy, desire, heart-hurting fondness and a lust that bordered on painful… it was more than Harry would ever have asked for.
“We had to protect our knowledge, because without tradition, there would be no magical way of education, of life. Extinction, they called it. And it scared me so much as a kid, these muggles with blood that may as well be dead without magic, that killed my grandmother’s grandmother. But then in school Granger was better than me. And you were...you were you. That was the first time I wondered if he was wrong.”
Draco didn’t even bother to answer, but he did hold the door open to the front hall, letting Harry pass before swinging it shut behind them. He followed Harry to the kitchens, where he made a pleased sound upon discovering the coffee, but didn’t say thank you before picking it up. He just took a sip and pointed to the magic cupboard. When Harry opened it, he found an herb drawer, which accepted the bundle of greenery he dumped inside and immediately began organizing it, labels springing up wherever a new bunch folded together.
It was a long shot, Harry knew. But he’d had a spark of inspiration that he wasn’t about to ignore. He wanted to give Draco his freedom back, give him a gift he’d never been given, wanted to test their new relationship away from its containment to see if it stuck. So he said “what about the Muggle world?” and waited for the response.
“Thank fuck, me either,” Harry agreed, and Draco gave his cheek a light smack before releasing his face. “I don’t even know where to start.”
“I think it likes me now,” he was telling Ron, sitting cross-legged in front of the Floo with Pearl in his lap. “It stopped hiding my left socks.”
“Mmm.” Harry’s blood chilled when he remembered Malfoy. Fuck, it had been hours and hours, and he’d gotten entirely distracted. Malfoy probably thought that Harry had abandoned him again, and wandless once more. He had to get back. But… “I should stay with you tonight, though.”
Harry ripped through the house like a silver bullet. He kept seeing Molly’s face, Ron’s wet hair, Malfoy’s blue hands in the water.
“You been watching me?” Harry set the broom beside him carefully — more carefully than he would set his own broom down, without being under Draco’s watchful eye. Draco didn’t answer, and Harry was relieved. He didn’t really like to think about the show he’d given: he was creepingly becoming aware of how weird and antisocial he had been, how naked and crazy. For some reason, even though he was now stuck keeping Malfoy’s secrets, things felt more settled now. Less manic. The exercise had helped, certainly, and having someone to live with made a difference too. Harry had always liked having roommates at Hogwarts, and it was good to have someone to hang out with. Not just someone.
“I don’t want you to stay, I need you to stay.” Draco shoved at Harry, perhaps to cover the weakness of his words. But his shove wasn’t much stronger.
“It’s been a rough day,” she grumbled, but then grinned and elbowed him, and he tickled her, and then he nearly burnt her with the cigarette, and then the phone nearly slid out the window, and they both ended up slightly jostled but a little more pleased.
It wasn’t that he knew what he was doing, so much, as he knew what he wanted to do and he wasn’t at the point anymore where he could keep himself from doing it. He wanted to taste the magic in Draco’s skin, to know the sweetness of the sweat-matted curls that brushed his nose. He wanted to give the best head he could dream of getting, and from the sounds that Draco seemed to be making despite himself, he thought he was doing okay.
“Hermione?” It could be nothing. But it could be anything. A curse. Some uncaptured Death Eater… apart from the one he’d left at home. “Ron?”
Dean gave Harry a hug and let Ginny go next, and Harry squeezed her hard. “I  get it now,” he whispered to her, on a whim that made Hannah glance at them before exiting. “What you meant. Good luck in New York.”
Molly had disappeared, and they were alone with the redheaded portraits that lined the entry to the Burrow. Harry glanced around, seeing the lookalikes to his adopted family that he’d grown familiar with over the years. Great-aunt Marjoram winked at him, her face Ginny’s but her ample curves Molly’s. Harry blushed and looked away.
He thought he woke up, at one point, but couldn’t be sure — the room was true dark, and he had a strange feeling like music was playing.
“Because we’re fucking,” Draco deduced, and Ron coughed, sputtering until Hermione had to pat him on the back, hiding a smile.
“But I could sense the spell. They can’t sense it?” Draco was looking over every stranger that streamed past. An old woman whose bag was bursting with herbs. Two businessmen, hurrying back from lunch with flushed cheeks. A baby in the arms of its mother, just scrunching its face up to cry. None of them gave the two boys on the bench a second glance.
Neville nodded and cracked open a Red Stripe for each of them, passing Harry’s over with dirt-speckled hands. “Speaking of which, has Malfoy come out of the walls yet or what?”
“Ah. Right.” Draco finally passed the bottle back, and their hands brushed. It felt weird, that shock of skin, but at least it confirmed Draco was alive. “Are we going anywhere?”
Where Draco before had hung weightless in a swallowing water, he now drifted free from gravity. Harry fell and fell into his chest and was held aloft, feet in the air but safe in the space of the walls that wrapped around them. It felt right, natural, rotating and colliding gently like new planets in a house-shaped universe.
“That’s an insensitive thing to say about yourself,” she said mildly, and dropped some Floo Powder before stepping through the fire.
Good old Ron. Without a Horcrux weighing on him, he could always set his anger aside in favor of his loving side. He was more of a Molly than an Arthur, although Harry would never tell him that. He glanced at Hermione, who raised her eyebrows.
“Thanks, guys.” Harry glanced around at them, struck by how strange it was to have a kitchen full of Gryffindors at Malfoy Manor. There was only one way to make it go over smooth. “Shots?”
“We’re all going through a lot.” Draco set his broom aside to dry. “I, for example, have new insight into your orphan status.”
Draco screwed his eyes shut, irritation and fear both plain as day across his pointy face. “I love you too, alright, Potter? I shan’t say it regularly.”
Later they packed Ron’s things so he could go to the Burrow for a couple of days, and they dropped him off so Harry could hug a silent Molly. George had told the doctors at St. Mungo’s that he was only testing new joke potions, but he’d finished a dozen bottles and they’d found him in Fred’s sweater, and Arthur had called all the kids home to support him.
?” she asked again, this time desperate. “Please. I just want to help him, and I need all the information I can get.”
Harry held on tight, the tenseness between them transformed, Draco’s jaw cracking when his mouth opened wider. Harry ground down, experimentally, the off-balance cramp of his knees nothing compared to the hard, thrilling heat below him. Draco made a dark sound he’d never made before, one he didn’t seem likely to have made on purpose, and Harry repeated his seeking motion.
“Harry,” Harry said automatically. His glasses were chipped from the desk he’d blown up, his jaw sore from grinding his teeth. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”
“It’s not fucking funny,” Harry snarled. His knees stung like he’d ripped through his jeans and into the skin with the fall. He levered himself upright with a vicious yank on Draco’s arm, drawing himself up to face the other boy properly.
Ron and Hermione were leaving in the morning, taking two Apparition points to Australia. Ron was hesitant to leave his family so soon after Fred’s funeral, Harry could tell, but Hermione had been saying things like
The next morning was a riot of pancakes and Pepperup potion, a small army of hungover friends pouring coffees and righting spilled bottles. Harry clapped shoulders and received cheek kisses and one by one, everyone went back to their jobs and their lives.
“Hey,” Harry said, confused and beginning to be embarrassed, but trying for stern. “Come off it. You disappeared and the house went to me. That means you’re dead.”
“No,” he said quickly, imagining how badly that would upset the koi. “But Ginny’s going away, right? We could do her party there? Or is that weird?”
“You’re such a prick,” Harry grumbled, and Draco bumped his shoulder again. “Okay. But you can’t go into the magical world, right?”
Everyone trooped into the bedrooms eventually — Neville and Luna, Parvati and Lav, Seamus and MacMillan and Finch-Fletchly. The rules had relaxed a bit, Harry thought, watching people disappear to sleep and love each other in twos and threes. It was nice, everyone having someone. Maybe it was a little sad to be the only one alone, but he had his friends, and they had each other.
He hadn’t realized, until now, living with Draco as though they’d intended it, how much he longed to care for somebody who would stay. He had spent so many years caring so much about winning and running and dying that he’d never realized that cooking for someone could be an act of love instead of obedience. He hadn’t realized, until now, how his brain had started using the word
Harry nodded, remembering the awful sadness in Molly’s eyes. She already had the look of a mother whose child was gone, lately, and he’d been heartbroken to see how fresh that look was today. “I think Fred is why he did it, though. To be with him. I can’t say I don’t empathize with him.”
“Are you okay? I’m so sorry.” Harry rubbed his eyes and turned to face him. In the dark, Draco’s face looked pinched and pale.
“You coming home?” Ron asked, rubbing his hands up and down Hermione’s arms as if to warm her. He’d looked after them both all night, but he still looked pleased and tipsy, his smile crooked as his nose. Hermione had finally seemed to relax as well, and he longed to confess everything to their familiar faces.
So instead he did shots with Ron and danced with Hermione and then watched with the others, giggling and shoving, as a bewildered Muggle deliveryman followed their instructions to leave three large pizzas on the sidewalk outside the invisible Grimmauld Place.
“You wish.” They kept walking. Draco lit the tip of his wand, wordlessly lifting it to brighten the space around them both.
But if Harry could do anything, it was be the brave one. He release Draco’s wrist and reached for his hair, wondering at the impossibly silky slip of it between his fingers, before he leaned forward and captured Draco in a decisive kiss.
“He was wrong. He was stupid. I thought he was acting on something real, but he didn’t know anything. Look at them.” Harry looked. A teenager across the street was trying to light a cigarette while being dragged by his dog, a phone pressed to his ear as he struggled. Two little girls were being chased by their harried father. Over and over again the scene in front of them was resetting and emptying and refilling itself with humanity. But Harry liked his neighborhood for its busyness, the way there was always a pub open or a takeaway to try. He felt anonymous there, tucked in unnoticed like a human version of Grimmauld Place.
“You don’t want to hide anymore?” Maybe this was a part of the dream. It was something he’d wanted, yes, which was even more of a reason not to trust it. “What do you want?”
Harry Apparated to Grimmauld Place and walked the halls. He felt like a ghost in his own house most days, too emotionally strung out to change a single peel of moulding wallpaper. How the fuck was he supposed to take on another place? Harry Potter, the Boy Who Inherited Properties He Couldn’t Keep Up With?
It wasn’t one of their cleaner fights: there was wrong-colored hair in his eyes and Harry was forced to swing out blind with his elbows. Draco shoved him again, and this time Harry went down hard on one knee. He headbutted Draco in the stomach and pulled him down too, Draco’s hand fisting and yanking in Harry’s hair even as he fell. Then they were a tangle on the ground, mud and punches flying until everything hurt and Harry could barely see a thing
editions, which are always a bit incomprehensible. Funeral listings on the back. I included a special edition about the rebuilding of Hogwarts, although I’m sure you’re up to date.”
“You were cooking?” Harry picked his foot up, saw flour on it, then sought out Draco’s eyes. They were darting about, looking for an escape, but then the words burst out of him, hurried after hours of keeping his head down out of his freezing fear.
Harry’s determination to get Draco into the muggle world doubled at hearing that. Was it safe? The whole world was out there, and he wanted to give it to Draco. Wanted to show him that there was more of it than the parts that had rejected him, that he felt betrayed by. He nudged Draco’s chest with his shoulder, bringing their arms into one long press of contact. “We’ll be together,” he said firmly.
“And more hidden away,” he answered without thinking, remembering Draco emerging from the shadows with new bottles, but they all just laughed.
had sent through him. He couldn’t keep track of what was happening and what they were actually acknowledging anymore. “We just had a great day, I thought.”
Hermione arrived at half-past eleven, lugging another bagful of books in her endless purse and carrying a notepad with what looked like color-coordinated notes. “Are you ready?” she asked once situated, having dusted off her pants and set her things down.
“Hide,” Harry decided, pulling his wand from the back of his beat-up jeans. “Go, it’s either for me or it’s nothing good.”
“Just around here, actually.” Harry gestured at the sign above the street they were approaching. “Two blocks down on the left. Want to see it?”
Of course, no one could avoid the War forever. Seamus got too drunk and started to cry a little, toasting to Colin, and then everyone had to make a toast. Harry stood swaying in the doorway, buffered on one side by Hermione, listening to the toasts and the cheers as they got rowdier and rowdier with each name on the too-long list.
“It’s Harry, then.” He shook her hand and left, shuffling through the packet of papers as he walked down the street. There was another newsstand: this one had Harry’s face, next to a photo of the Manor. Well, no way to hide it from Hermione and Ron, then. She was keeping up with the post-War fallout, sending overseas owls by albatross once a week with her thoughts. It would be a change to have her lecturing him again —  he usually had to scan through two separate political diatribes before finding any news about the elder Grangers, or words from Ron. In the last month, they’d tracked her parents down, but feeding their memories back was slow going. Hermione had theories about Pensieves and spell reversals, and her determination was easy to sense on the page. Harry thought that even if the Grangers couldn’t remember everything, they wouldn’t be able to help but love their daughter and the man she’d chosen.
Draco met Harry in the hallway, dressed for war. He’d swapped his Quidditch cast-offs for a suit of black: denim trousers that looked thick and expensive, topped by a lightweight henley that barely hung loose anymore. There was a coat slung over his arm, too, also black. The overall effect was that of blending into the shadows, with every detail polished and menacing in its elegance to anyone who dared to look twice. He had also run a cleansing spell over his hair, and it was still slicked back a little, reminding Harry forcibly of the way he wore it when they were kids. Draco tugged his hand through it again, looking nervous. “I think so. Can you do a Disillusionment on me?”
“Yeah, hopefully I’m done with all of that. As long I don’t, I don’t know, wind up in Voldie’s secret New York apartment,” she laughed.
“McGonagall wasn’t sure where to put returning students. You don’t know this?” Ron was grinning still. “Plan A was to stick them in with the seventh years.”
The buzz and the excitement was cut off in one step, the silence in its wake enormous. Draco dropped Harry’s hand, still without looking at him, and moved toward the kitchen.
It was a last night, in a lot of ways, for a lot of things. Everyone else seemed eager to make it count, but dread was starting to fill up in Harry’s belly. He knew he was betraying Draco by bringing people into their home. Draco’s home. All weekend his secret anger had simmered alongside a sour sense of rejection, keeping him from calling it off. But now he wondered what would have happened if he’d gone back alone.
The kitchen was enormous, vaulted and floored with tile that sucked the heat from his bare feet when he toed his shoes off. But it felt less intimidating when Harry started to fill it with cooking smells, onion and curry powder and mustard seed sweating together until he’d put together a half-decent vindaloo. He found a German wizarding beer that looked wildly expensive and opened like champagne, and carried everything to the front door on impulse.
He was already worried about him, missed him, wanted to chase him back to the manor and shout at the walls that he was sorry. But he’d meant everything he’d said. Everything he’d done. And as much as he wished he could take back the memory of their brief, frantic kiss, it was already too precious to ever let go of. No matter how Draco had reacted.
“No, I think I’m stuck,” he continued, looking at Hermione now as Ron went fumbling off for a shirt. “The house isn’t listening to me like I thought it was. It’s almost getting worse.”
Finally Draco crouched down, leaving his wand floating vertically like a candle, beaming light. Harry kneeled beside him — or tried, but Draco shoved him off-balance at the last second, sending him wavering sideways before he caught himself. “Oi!”
Draco glanced down at Harry’s hold on him. It was a tight grip, and not strictly necessary anymore, but Harry hadn’t released him yet. Pain made him sway a little:, Draco moved with him before he captured Harry’s forearm, just as hard as Harry must have been holding onto him. The world had shrunk down to the pain in Harry’s arm and head and hand and the sound of Draco’s voice and the unreadable expression in his eyes.
“I’m asking you to stay,” Draco confirmed. He reached up, grasping Harry’s wrists in return. Their hands squeezed, pulled apart, palms sliding and fingers tangling. “And  I— I also…”
“Of course there are.” Draco lifted the bottle to his pointy nose and inhaled deeply, taking an equally deep swig before handing it over. He shuddered, watching Harry take his own swallow — it was like wood smoke and honey, and it burned a stripe down his throat. He nodded, and Harry took another gulp before holding it back out. “God, it’s good to be out in the open. I was starting to believe I really was dead.”
Harry was a little nervous about looking into the pantry, assuming the Malfoys would have half a rack of Muggle waiting for their guests to feast on. He was surprised to see it open to a perfectly-stocked series of shelves, though: veg, meat, dairy, wine, even a chocolate torte, all sorted onto appropriate shelves and cushioned with individual temperature spells. It must be restocking magically. Lucky for him.
“I don’t want to be an Auror.” Saying it to Draco, having Ron and Hermione know, made it feel real. Harry felt the truth of it settle in his stomach. “I’m not going into Training.”
“Came to get my nose fixed so I wouldn’t Eloise Midgen myself,” he suggested, and then hissed when Hermione’s
“You’re lucky you didn’t have a family,” Draco groused, his casual cruelty making Harry laugh for once.
“Right as usual,” he muttered, making a mental note to tell Hermione. Later. He wasn’t about to interrupt again.
Both Order of the Phoenix members looked at him, and Draco shrugged, as though he hadn’t meant to react.
“Promises,” the blond sniffed. “Well, I suppose the word of the future Head Auror is worth more than last season’s cast-offs. Or it will have to be.”
She had pushed them all to one side now, though, and was stress-laundering more of Ron’s things in case he needed them sent. Harry hadn’t reminded her that Ron still had most of his possessions at the Burrow, recognizing her need to keep busy, and had merely found Hermione’s mobile to order in some Chinese.
Draco picked his head up a bit as they headed to the Floos to leave, holding it high as Ministry workers started to notice Harry, and then him. Harry’s heart ached to see it, the way Draco had left after their fight to see a movie in peace, the hours of fear he’d faced, and the deep-bred pride that picked his head up despite it all.
“That’s a big risk to take,” Harry pointed out. He was pacing, unwilling to sit down when he’d been called away from the garden. There was a koi pond he’d become fascinated with, going back every day to trim away more of the long grasses that had nearly hidden it. The koi were enormous and fat, silver and vibrant oranges, slippery blacks and shining scales. He thought they were hundreds of years old, maybe, and almost certainly magic. The pond seemed small for them, so he’d been rooting around looking for a shovel or some helpful spellbook in the gardening shed. Of course, this being the Malfoy Manor, the shed was more of an enormous converted stables. He’d only emerged from it, dusty and spiderweb-covered, when Hermione had sent her Patronus through the Floo. “I’m fine.”
Harry groaned and sat down on the bed, setting the bag of papers and potions beside him. His hair was still wet. “For fuck’s sake. I was worried about you, you prick.”
It felt like hours that he was locked in terror, screaming, crying, Vodemort’s eyes, his mother’s screams, Dumbledore’s hand. Ron walking away, Hagrid weeping, Fred on the ground. He felt locked in, like it would never end, like he would live forever in a soul-suckingly horrible moment, like the mouths of Dementors, like the feeling of Avada Kedavra invading his body.
Draco’s trousers looked too expensive to be tugged half-down his thighs, and his skin was so pale as to look translucent. But his dick was pink and heavy, and Harry tried his best to taste every inch.
“Here I am,” Malfoy agreed, raising the bottle. “And here you are. The Great Potter. I’m actually relieved you know the Unforgivables, I was so sure you’d take down the Dark Lord with Expelliarmus and friendship.”
Hermione slipped into the hug, and Harry’s cheek smooshed into hers as Ron adjusted his grip. Hermione laughed, her breath skirting across his face in a wash of maple.
The proprietor nodded, looking a little sad. Harry drew himself up and tried to look like someone who hadn’t buried their head out of trauma. But the man said nothing, only fetching down more and more papers out of little cubbies, flipping one out of each and tying them together in mid-air with a ribbon that grew to fit the stack.
“It looks good,” he offered finally, as Draco turned his chin one way and another. Draco caught his eyes in the mirror, not reacting to Harry’s sudden awakeness. Maybe he’d known.
“Relationship?” Pansy echoed, sounding faint. Her eyes had snapped to Draco as though he were magnetic, and the next noise she made was a sob. Draco went from leaning over Hermione behind the couch to the center of the room in an instant, and she crashed into him there, moving forward so quickly that Harry could hear their collision from across the room.
The lift started slowing, and Harry hissed his worst fears helplessly, pouring it all out at Hermione’s feet in the seconds he had left before facing whatever was to come. “What if they arrest him? What if they think hiding was a crime? What if we’re too late, what if he hates me now? Hates me more?
“Well the famous Harry Potter laid that glass down, so start bragging about that instead.” He opened the jar of jam, ignoring Draco’s indignant noise.
“What’s Plan C?” Harry was picking a scone apart with his fingers. He and Draco had made a feast of waffles the night before, the manor supplying a heavy metal griddle that Draco had turned and turned with a glee that bordered on mania. “What were Plan B and A, for that matter?”
“Nice,” he said mildly, and began pinching more dough into place to close the pork pies, Draco only a moment’s hesitation behind.
... Peeves had left paths of destruction across the school, but now it was only Harry making a mess.
“Yes,” she said definitely, and patted his knee. “But it’s okay. It’s one of the things we love about you. Ron says it’s what makes you a good Seeker.”
he thought muzzily, and didn’t stir. If they heard him they might quiet down again, and he hadn’t heard them speak yet. It was the same kind of portrait murmuring that he’d heard so many times at Hogwarts, almost comforting to hear again. There weren’t any that he remembered in this room, but there was one outside the doorway, and he could hear two voices going back and forth out there now.
He still didn’t know why he felt so rocked by the last ten minutes. The whole walk over he’d been sorting through each frenzied second, trying to make sense of it all together. Most surprising was that he felt any shock, that he hadn’t seen this coming. If he had been honest with himself a month ago, he would have known already the way he felt about Malfoy. If he had been smart for one fucking second, he would have remembered that they had always hated each other. Somehow both had gone ignored, both had gotten confused, and both things now hurt him equally.
Next he let the peacocks in the house — there were three, and they seemed pleased to be inside, shitting everywhere and curling up to sleep in odd places. Harry was sure they had fanciful names like Veni, Vidi, and Vici, but he called them Snow and Pearl and Betty White for their coloring. Betty immediately started sleeping in Draco’s bed with him, and Harry was grateful to the Manor for clearing their messes.
“What, exactly, are you accusing Mr, Potter of?” Shacklebolt asked mildly, and Savage seemed to shrink.
“She said she’d be a character reference,” Harry says shortly, not wanting to talk about a trial too much. “And they know about us too.”
So he told her the truth, though he hadn’t realized it was the truth until right then. “Of course I’ve thought about death. I died. I’ve been thinking a lot about it. I don’t… I don’t think I want to go back there, though, not yet. Don’t worry.”
“Did you check on Weasley?” he asked, instead of responding, and Harry felt a flush climb over his cheeks.
“Yeah?” Draco rubbed his hands together, looking shy, and reached for the bag of snacks and magazines at their feet. “I’d like that. This was a good belated birthday idea.”
As always, Ron’s chatter was aimed to soothe, and as always, it worked. Harry let himself be walked away, once again, from the planning committee. “You’re going to be a good Auror, Ron,” he said with a sigh.
“How do I look?” Draco turned to the time-smudged mirror that sat above a console table, squinting at his face. His hands went to his hair first, and Harry stepped behind him, watching both of their reflections. Draco looked plain, like an off-brand Seamus, but there was still some essential Draco-ness to the lift of his eyebrows. Harry caught Draco’s eyes: he’d been staring too long.
“Er, hello.” He was sure he would have remembered the new Auror if they’d met, but Hermione had warned Harry a thousand times that it was rude to ask people if you’ve met them before. It had been part of a common Hermione-lecture about learning how to live in the public eye. He rather thought she hadn’t meant hiding out at Malfoy Manor, but at least he could smile and nod at this Auror.
“Yeah, of course. Next week.” Harry let them keep talking, though he was sure they sensed his mood shift. They’d planned it all out, Ron and Hermione, and all he had to do was go along with the plan. It was a good plan, too. What he’d always wanted, what they’d all worked so hard for. He picked up another scone and began to pull it into dust.
“Don’t expect it to happen again,” said Draco, but he sounded too shell-shocked to mean it, and then he kissed Harry again and undermined himself entirely.
The elder Malfoys were dealt with, and so no one had gone looking for him at first. Lucius had died when another Dark lackey aimed their wand sideways in the last battle, some ice-cold revenge from the long years of infighting. Narcissa had caught a cold while awaiting trial in Azkaban, which carried her off swiftly after. Harry had felt a whiff of regret when he’d heard about it: she’d been a mixed bag, not all evil. He spared a thought for Draco, even, feeling something like reluctant pity when he remembered Draco’s pointy eleven-year-old face, mocking Harry for being an orphan.
“I-” Harry looked down. Next to his thigh on the bed was Malfoy’s wand. He must have been using it all day. “Okay, I know. Well, I hope she has some good ideas for you. And I just, um. The wand…”
Harry dragged some of the blankets to the floor, dropping the nest’s stack of pillows in place beside the not-a-closet-door. He Summoned a glass of water, boosted the heat, and settled in.
“Or he knew I couldn’t hack it, more likely.” Draco swooped a scoop of bubbles into his hand to distract himself and began piling them onto Harry’s head, going back for more and more until a smile threatened to take over the haunted look on his face. Harry tipped his head back and allowed it.
Draco had handed him a piece of paper and encouraged him to pass it on to the proprietor, but Harry reached for it as he went in, wanting to make sure that there wasn’t anything evil or put there to embarrass him. He touched Draco’s wand in his robe pocket first, and felt a surprising spark of shame. Malfoy had trusted him, hadn’t he?
He explored the upstairs afterward. For some reason he’d thought there would only be bedrooms up there, but there were other rooms as well — little studies, opulent restrooms and saunas and some kind of observatory. There was an owlery in a corner tower room, empty now, and a room that seemed like a sort of homespun Quidditch museum. Harry recognized Draco’s broom, with a jolt. He hadn’t ever thought he would recognize it, and there it was, displayed on the wall like a relic from someone long-dead.
“I put a film screen in the Manor,” Harry told her, gesturing at the wall in front of the bed with his chopsticks. “We could be watching something right now.”
Ron and Hermione were in a circle of people around the fireplace, off to the side of another group that had taken over the couch and movie area. Their giggles gave away Parvati’s famous stash of billywig stings, but the group by the fireplace seemed more level.
“Probably.” Harry reached for the bottle, and Draco passed it over. They’d given up on glasses a long time ago, and now the moisture of Draco’s mouth on the lip of the bottle was a part of the ritual.
“They like me more than you,” Harry insisted, and considered the temptation to drop Malfoy’s leaves. He imagined them being scattered across the ground, and then thought of the hair stuck to Malfoy’s cheek, and kept walking.
They’d fought before, with wands and fists and feet, and it felt right to do it again. When Draco managed to shove him over, Harry stuck an elbow in his face. Draco yanked on his hair, then yowled when Harry went for his.
“I know I can!” he shouted instead, meeting his confusing feelings with anger the way he always had. “I want
Harry cast a wandless warming spell on the wood floor, then shuffled over barefoot to inspect the wall. He knocked where Hermione had, and was entirely ignored.
“Take this,” Hermione said, reappearing. She was holding a bundle of his things to her chest, and Harry was distracted as soon as he spotted the contents of her armload.
They didn’t come out for hours, a full morning that Harry had spent showering, tidying up, and attempting to give himself a haircut that refused to take. He thought about flying, but it didn’t feel right without Draco, like he’d come untethered from gravity alone and go spinning off into the sky. He’d wandered in and out of the library, fed the fish and the birds, and spent some serious time picking through a closet stuffed with a jumbled collection of spare armor. He’d almost assembled one entire suit’s worth, although he had somehow turned up a set of two left feet, and wasn’t sure if that was an error, an inside joke, or a sign to keep looking.
In his dreams Draco had floated and flown, had radiated peace and beauty, compelling Harry to be a part of him and the manor and its magic, all in one perfect impossibility. In reality their teeth clashed and Harry was afraid to let his hips land against Draco’s, but when Draco lifted up to meet him the reality was better than the dream, for all of their awkward bumping and aligning and inelegant grinding.
“It’s my house, and I’ll wall the whole thing off if I want to,” Draco said sternly, and Harry made a show of rolling his eyes. He’d woken up feeling leaden and vaguely as though he was forgetting something. Maybe he needed more tea.
“Thanks,” Harry said, picking up the stack and wishing he felt like reading them. “And the coverage about the Malfoys?”
Harry sighed. One hangover and he was throwing Draco’s will to live back at him like a bad thing. “Maybe we could use some Pepper-Up,” he added reluctantly. “Do you have any?”
“Did you eat?” he asked after casting his cleaning spell, feeling totally off-kilter. His whole body was warm and sated and his mind was buzzing with a thousand thoughts. Surely Draco would think this was a mistake, but already Harry was wondering how and when and if he could kiss him again.
“It’s okay, she didn’t see us.” Harry tried to touch Draco’s shoulder, but Draco pulled away. “Even if she had, it’s just Hermione.”
to leave. I wanted you to have some freedom, fuck, how is that a bad thing? And if we see Hermione, is that really the worst thing either? She’s my best friend, she won’t turn you in to anyone.”
“I mean, sympathize, yes…” Hermione slowed folding, then stopped, putting down Ron’s Cannons jersey to give him her full attention. “But empathize? Harry, have you had any thoughts about death?” It was dark now, and they hadn’t put enough lights on past Ron and Hermione’s bedroom, so the halls were dark and the windows were dark and the lonely amber light of the room made Harry feel as though they were cocooned with their secrets.
disappeared at some point. She had been drinking wine. And she had been here before, as family and as a prisoner and as Harry’s guest. “She saw you? What did she say?”
The first thing he did was send away for supplies. It took two days for everything to be delivered, and another day for him to find where the postman had left his packages. He finally found them at the back edge of the lawn, a good twenty-minute hike from the house but apparently as close as the wards would let Muggles get. He shrunk everything down, dried the dew off, and set to work.
“Fuck yeah, especially after I bring in Draco Malfoy.” Ron waggled his eyebrows and followed him to the fridge. “I reckon I’ll get a medal.”
Another bottle sailed up from the chimney, bursting out in a shower of dust before it settled in Draco’s hand. He coughed, then laughed.
“He’s the Minister for Magic, Potter,” he explained, his voice cool but quiet. “You can’t do your boy wonder bit here.”
"How tall am I?" he asked. The fuzziness was beginning to leave him finally and her words were having more of an impact. "Why didn't that part work?"
But Draco didn't talk about it, and Harry didn't try and force him to. Nor did he try and make him talk about what the hell was going to happen to them after graduation, which was approaching quickly along with their exams.
“I mean, really, Harry, there’s just no point, you’re making yourself as miserable as you’re making her —”
"You know," he said against his better judgment, "I've been wanting to tell you ... I don't think anything'll happen before your mum gets out, but I've been pushing Kingsley since the day he took office to get rid of the Dementors from Azkaban." Draco looked up at him very suddenly with saucer-wide eyes. "He agrees with me they're foul and don't belong there, there's just a lot of red tape he's working through. It'll happen, though. And, er, when it does, you can visit your dad. That'll change everything, not having Dementors around the prisoners."
Ron didn’t answer the question. “I thought saving him from the Fiendfyre would be the last of it, but now you’re protecting him from some bully. I couldn’t think of any other reason you wouldn’t have told anybody what Helstrom did, even
“Harry —” Draco started, on the verge of saying it again, but a second later Harry had stood up from the bed.
“I don’t know,” he said. “No. But it doesn’t change anything. It was a summer thing, not a … a relationship, for crying out loud. Like I’d date Potter.”
"Oh, that's really hysterical," Draco says brusquely and looks up at him finally, steeling himself against his own weak will where Harry's concerned. "And I suppose someone held you at wand-point and kept you from trying to talk to me before now?"
Holding his breath, Draco turned towards the stairs that led down into the dungeons to see Theo climbing up them, dark eyes stuck on Harry.
He hadn’t been expecting that, and for a moment it gave Harry pause. He dipped his fingers beneath the Nirvana jumper and trailed them lazily across the warm skin of Malfoy’s back.
Draco mulled over his options, watching Potter carefully, feeling utterly trapped. Only seconds after the fact, he couldn’t seem to remember what had possessed him to lose control of himself like that. He vehemently ignored the tiny part of his mind insisting he knew perfectly well the answer to this. It was still throbbing low in his stomach.
Potter twined their fingers together, his thumb rubbing lightly across the back of Draco's hand. He couldn’t even be sure if Potter was conscious of doing it. The look on his face was tight, like he was sorting through a million different emotions at once, and Draco supposed that was probably the case. A pang of guilt struck him, and suddenly he felt selfish for making Potter come down here.
"Shut up, Draco," he said and reattached their lips, hungry for it now. His cock was hard, hot and throbbing where his jeans had it pressed against his thigh, and he could feel it twitch when he first got a taste of Malfoy's tongue. His brain seemed to be lagging behind, still trying to process the fact that he was snogging Malfoy, but it didn't really matter at the moment. It couldn't, because Malfoy's hands were on his face and then in his hair, and he was pulling Harry down on top of him. His head came down on the arm of the sofa and his legs opened tentatively around Harry, who pressed forward and felt his cock rub against Malfoy's hip. He both felt and heard Malfoy moan into his mouth. The sound of it made Harry's belly twist with an arousal so sharp it was painful.
Ron and Hermione were in two of the chairs, and their conversation came to a halt the moment they saw him. Ron's eyes widened and he pointed furiously at Harry, sitting up straight in his seat.
