Draco closed his eyes again and tilted his head back. “Never been more sure, Potter.”

He took her by both wrists, pushing the paper back enough that the bold print of the front-page boilerplate finally came into focus, and it was to the sound of rising scandalised whispers rippling through the Great Hall that he read, over a picture of himself, haggard and glaring up dejectedly from the pit of Courtoom Ten, “

of our parents would still be around and kicking if you hadn’t been your insufferable martyr self, so I think you can share the toast.”
The next morning, he considered Flooing to Diagon Alley like a civilised wizard—then considered again after recalling that he’d need to find a private space to shift (the Eeylops staff would have questions if pressed to remove one of their patented cuffs from a human, surely), a task that would be difficult if not downright impossible the weekend before students would be returning to Hogwarts for the new term. He therefore kissed his mother on the cheek after wolfing down a quick three-course breakfast and winged his way to London, not knowing at all how much time he ought to allot for the journey and therefore arriving nearly two hours before the appointed meeting time.
But the further down the order form Draco read, the deeper the furrow between his brow grew, until he had to fight not to rip the damn parchment in half, fingers white-knuckled as he clenched the paper in both fists.

“That—” Potter followed her gaze, forcing a smile and an unconvincing laugh. “Oh, that’s—that’s my new owl. I went to check Pig, like I said, when I heard a commotion outside, and I found Crookshanks attacking him. I guess he didn’t recognise him, seeing as I only just got him and all.”
It was a lovely contrast, if you asked Draco. An elegant white splatter against a sea of inky black. One could have written poetry about it—Potter was delivering fantastic free-form verses at that very moment, in fact.
“Oh. Wow. It really
Draco showed him two fingers. How about
Draco sat there in the dark of the roost room, straining to eavesdrop on their game commentary, for much longer than was probably appropriate.
“Well, you’ve got six months to figure me out. Or to decide if not understanding me’s a deal-breaker.”
“The Marauders.” And now he was just making things up to fuck with Draco. If he didn’t want to discuss something, all he needed was to
“Then
There was a heavy, pregnant pause, and then Draco asked, very carefully, “You wanted to?”
Draco’s stomach, full of lead, twisted in on itself when Wentsworth pronounced their meeting over and bid Draco farewell until their next appointment, reminding him to pop in to the Auror Division and see what Thomassen might want with him. Draco gave a mute nod, shuffling from the room and wiping his sweaty palms on his robes, feeling like he might sick up if he opened his mouth. Would the Aurors ship him off to Azkaban for puking in their Bullpen? Well, he was about to find out.

This meant, however, that the task fell to Blaise to deliver to Draco the letter that had been found sitting at the Slytherin table when the students filed into the Great Hall for dinner. Addressed simply to ‘Malfoy’ in a chicken-scratch scrawl, it seemed innocent enough with its crisp white envelope and wax seal bearing a stag’s head. Still, looks could absolutely be deceiving, and Draco had considered burning it on the spot, for who knew what manner of curse had been laid upon it, and it wasn’t as if Draco could go running to the Headmistress begging to have his mail monitored for the foreseeable future.
“Well, no, but that’s beside the—anyway, we aren’t going to Tesco.”
“Granger was right,” Draco breathed against his lips, puffy and wet.
; why would it work with the damn owl?” Draco muttered under his breath.
Harry swallowed. “Now—don’t freak out—”
She nodded, releasing him at last, and wiped her eyes. “Well, you boys head off into the garden and say hello to everyone else. It’ll still be another half hour before I’m ready for you!”
He’d been ashamed as he’d accepted it, knowing in his heart of hearts that Potter hadn’t stolen his wand from him. He’d let it go. Not consciously—he hadn’t been stupid enough to leave that for the Dark Lord to root out of his mind—but still, his fingers had loosened and his grip weakened, and then Potter had taken it and fled. Gone in a whirl of magic, off to parts unknown.
But Draco just waved him off with a disgusted huff. “Salazar’s balls, I’ll leave you and your cock in peace. I’m taking next bath.” He threw a sharp look over his shoulder. “…And don’t come peeping until I’m ready.”
. Perhaps it’ll take some of the attention off of me.”
And fuck it—the Horned Owl was already slavering at the beak, so Draco gave it a hissed warning, beating his wings imperiously to run it off. He then ever-so-slowly crept down the branch to claim his prize, taking care not to jostle the pyramid and send the delicious little delights tumbling into the filthy straw below, and nipped them up, one by one.
“Yeah, not so much for me. But you already know that. So you either

His studies had been abruptly cut short, though, when a horrifically disfigured Harry Potter had jumped him in his own parlour and fucked off with his wand, and then when he’d convinced his mother to loan him hers so he could complete the final stages of the spell, the whole bloody war had crested on the castle grounds, and he’d nearly been reduced to so much ash on the wind by a carelessly cast Fiendfyre curse.
“—but the garden’s tiny, and I wouldn’t mind getting a few laps around the Quidditch pitch myself. So?”
“You think I don’t know that?” Potter said, with a manic sort of laughter, and he threw his hands up. “I’ve been used to some end or another for most of my life. Been betrayed more times than anyone ought to be by my age—sometimes by people I didn’t know. Too often by people I
and gently stroking the heart-shaped crest of feathers around his face in a way he found he didn’t mind at all. When she pulled a few strips of ham off of what Draco suspected was to be the main dinner course come evening, Draco endured the humiliation of being hand-fed because it was fucking delicious, and he was only human. Potter had a panicked look to him the entire time, perhaps thinking after Draco’s earlier reaction to Weasley he might lash out at Weasley’s mother equally viciously. But Draco had manners, and mothers were off limits.

Not that Draco could blame him—the Nimbus line had passed the Firebolt’s quality two years back, claiming once more the title of best-quality broom on the market, and it seemed Potter was looking to get his hands on a Nimbus 2020. If nothing else, Potter at least had good taste in brooms—and it seemed this time he was going to actually use his

After much trial and error and several stubbed toes, they finally reached the window sill, and Potter set him down with one hand while he reached to unlatch the window with the other. “I wish I could say it’s been fun—but I’ve got a goose egg on the back of my head that would argue otherwise.” He unthinkingly reached out and scritched Draco right under the ruff of feathers ringing his face, as if he were a proper owl and not only hiding in this form for reasons.

Neville, Dean, and Seamus had pooled their funds to shower Harry with what felt like the entire Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes line—including a few prototypes thrown in by the twins on the condition Harry report back how useful he found them. Harry’s supply of Decoy Detonators and Nosebleed Nougats had been sorely depleted after months on the run, and he thanked his friends for the thought—though he wondered when he would ever find occasion to use so many prank goods again.
“The kitchens are

“No,” Draco said, then shook his head, as if to convince himself. “No, I’ll go.”
Draco just stared at him, blank and helpless. “…But you know who I am. You know what I’ve done.” If Thomassen needed to see the Mark again, Draco was ready to show him, if it would get him out of this office all the sooner.

Dinner, including Harry’s egg custard, was a rousing success, given he earned a, “Passable, Potter,” from Draco and Pansy and Theo had cleaned their plates. Greg and Millie had cleaned theirs too, but this was less a surprise or a compliment, as Draco had confided in him that Greg would eat anything that stood still long enough for him to stab it with a fork, and Millie had burned off all her taste buds in a Potions accident in Fourth Year. They set up picnic tables in the new Sanctuary, and it was kind of perfect.

But the West Tower was still a good ways from Draco’s current location, and Potter was nearly on him. A change of route was in order, in that case, and Draco dived down, arrowing for the struts underneath the Charms Corridor and banking along the southern wall of the Great Hall, through the windows of which he could still see students milling about, the tables having been given over to studies and genial conversation. This was where they would find out who was truly the more capable flier.
He frowned at the note Potter had sent him, mouthing the words to himself:

Oh, he was going to shit on Potter
as Draco pushed off of him, standing. He brushed down his robes to adjust the line, and Potter stared up at him dazedly from behind his glasses. Draco frowned at him, then scoffed. “Get up so I know you aren’t concussed.” He reached down, grabbing Potter’s wrist and jerking him back to his feet.
Potter rolled his eyes, sipping blithely from his mug. “I know it isn’t comfortable for you being here—in more ways than one. Is there

“That’s rich, coming from you.”
“‘M sorry, Potter,” Pansy told him nearabout midnight, her breath reeking of a Goblin brew they had fished out from behind a heavy cask of elf wine. She was trying very hard to crawl into his lap, and Harry was trying very hard not to touch her breasts. “I just didn’t wanna die, yeah? Draco’s still pissed off at me, but you’re not, right? You’re a soft touch—oh.” She gave his bicep a squeeze. “Maybe not so soft…”

“Mm, debatable.” He settled comfortably against the jamb, arms crossed over his chest; for someone so invested in Harry getting ready in a timely manner, he certainly was taking his sweet time dressing himself.

He didn’t have nearly enough experience under his belt to make an informed decision, and while the idea of a cock up his arse didn’t sound appealing on its face, there had to be something to it, right? Draco certainly didn’t seem like he relished pain, and yet here they were.
let Teddy feel unloved, or let him grow up not knowing how great his parents were.” His tone carried the sound of someone speaking from experience, and Draco wondered, not for the first time, how much of the Harry Potter story was real, and how much was trumped-up fiction. But Potter wasn’t his friend, so he really didn’t care enough to ask.
“I didn’t say trust blindly.” Potter took a step forward, arms folded behind his back. “Give me six months. Six months—and if, at the end of our training period, you

the DMLE might possibly get out of this. Had he filed his paperwork incorrectly? Was he about to get clapped in manacles—or worse, a birdcage—because he’d misdated his application or some such nonsense? His heart was racing, thudding so hard against his ribcage he worried it might just burst out and start flopping all over Thomassen’s cluttered desk.

“Was that his mother you were just speaking with, then?”
He knew he was whining, could hear that defensive edge to his voice, and if Draco hit back with the same energy, then this evening was going to go to pot.

Well, he didn’t have one. That was it. It was just like Potter said: they worked best when one of them wasn’t speaking, whether because they weren’t human at all, or because they were focused on a task. When they dared try and have a conversation, it always went tits-up, so this was really all they could ever hope to have.

But his decision to share more of himself with his adopted family was shifted aside when July came and their visits to Hogwarts to help with the rebuilding resumed in earnest. The reconstruction was coming along nicely; the Great Hall had been completely rebricked, and the staircases had been wholly repaired and were functioning properly once more—or at least as properly as they ever had, still occasionally depositing people where they hadn’t meant to go.
Potter followed Draco’s gaze and smiled up at the portrait with a sad sort of fondness. “Tonks said they’d always meant to replace it with a magical one that moved but never got around to it. I think I like this one better anyway.”

the Hogwarts Express—but for the moment, he was enjoying the fact he could sleep in the buff and not worry about merfolk or Grindylows peeping on him through the thick-paned portholes in the Dungeon’s dorm rooms.
With each successive visit—now coming two to three times a week usually—Potter became more and more inured to Draco’s threats (toothless and otherwise), and somewhere around mid-October, he started showing up with of all things
“They’ll look your way regardless,” Potter reasoned. “Go out of their way to find you. Maybe nasty sorts. Maybe just nosey reporters. I’d say your best bet is to refuse to give them more ammunition to use against you.”

And as hoped, an indeterminate while later, he cut his lift and began drifting down through the cloud cover, finding himself high overhead an estate that, while not quite as impressive as the Malfoy lands in Wiltshire, was respectable in its size and relieving in its familiarity. He circled the main manor house several times, trying to recall which window was Blaise’s, but was saved the effort when he floated low enough he caught Blaise in the rear courtyard, in the midst of duelling practise. He alighted in an evergreen overlooking a frozen-over bird bath to watch them work.
Maybe he could spend the remaining few months of school brushing up on disguise spells. It would be a waste of good breeding to walk around looking anything less than himself, but needs must and all that.
Harry lifted a brow. “Whose fault is that?”
This was a legitimate question, so Draco decided to be gentler with his mockery. “…So you came all the way here, not by broom, not by Floo, not by Apparition…because you were bored?”
“Would I really keep you waiting on your birthday?”

When they came tumbling out again, it was into a cottage similarly cramped to the Burrow but much more modestly appointed, with a charm Draco could actually appreciate. Muted colours, grand windows letting in the wan winter light, and a massive family portrait hanging over the fireplace through which they’d just arrived, showing a portly man with fair hair, a brown-haired woman who had a stirring familiarity to her, and a beaming young girl between them, one parent’s hand on each shoulder and sporting a shock of vibrant bubblegum-pink hair.

Draco wrinkled his nose and drew his cloak tighter about himself; how he wasn’t dying under such a heavy garment in midsummer was beyond Harry, but maybe he always ran hot these days, considering.

Ron didn’t seem to agree, but he kept his mouth shut, perhaps fearing any further commentary would see him assigned by Hermione to read it as well.

“Why am I not surprised? That’s a Gryffindor for you: flinging himself into an uncontrolled situation unthinkingly.” Draco cocked his head to the side, taking Harry’s lips into a teasing, lazy kiss that was saccharine sweet. He let his hand fall lower, fondling Harry through his nice new robes. “Surely you’ve got an idea, though.”
. Circe’s saggy tits I wish I had a cock. I’d shove it right up his pert little—”
Draco was still staring at his ring as they slid under the covers, mesmerised, and Harry could make him out as a soft blur when he removed his glasses, bringing his own ring close enough to see in the low lamplight. “Hermione and Ron are gonna ask about them, you know.”
Draco could feel fraught emotion clutching at his throat. Potter wasn’t allowed to

he pulled out a folio. With a sweep of his burly forearms, he cleared off a bit of desk space and slapped the folio down. “Now, let’s get caught up, shall we?” He frowned at the pages as he flipped through, muttering encouraging sounds under his breath. “So have things settled down since October, then?”
Draco brushed down his robes, fixing Potter with a hard look, then said only, “Greenhouses,” in a very meaningful tone that brooked no argument.
“Which department?” Harry asked.
Carefully—because it might be cursed, after all—Draco lifted the lid to find…a wand.

He couldn’t remember the last time he’d pulled one over on Potter, not like this, and he was practically bouncing on the Slytherin bench in the Great Hall as he wolfed down his breakfast. Potter might withhold treats for a few days out of spite after this stunt, so he would need to ensure he ate proper portions as a human for a while.

Draco’s birthday rolled around the first week of June, and Harry decided to start his special day off right with breakfast in bed—his preferred porridge, of course. As he was finishing his pumpkin juice, Harry placed a small gift box on the tray, trying not to fidget with excitement. Perhaps Draco could sense his eagerness, for he ignored the box at first, draining his cup to the last drop and daintily dabbing at his lips with his napkin.
“It’s like she thinks if she takes her eye off me for two seconds, I’m gonna run off looking for more Horcruxes!” he groused over dinner their first evening back together. Draco had insisted on ‘cooking’, so it was Aunt Bessie’s steak pies all around. “I think she wouldn’t even let Ginny go back to Hogwarts if she had her way!” He shovelled a bit into his mouth, swallowing around a gulp of pumpkin juice. “I’m about at my wits’ end; June couldn’t come soon enough.” He slammed his glass back down with a contented sigh. “I’m officially changing my allegiance to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black!”

Despite his announcement, the Weasleys seemed quite understandably confused at Potter’s insistence he bring his owl along with them to Diagon Alley, and Mrs Weasley even offered to watch him if Potter was so worried he might be lonely (Draco gagged, feigning a pellet in his craw). Potter insisted, though, that ‘Alabastard’ was very particular about his owl treats and wanted to pick them out himself.
“Yeah, all right. Anyone see where the Bludgers got off to? I don’t wanna—hey, where’re you going, Harry? Harry??”

“Of course not,” Potter huffed, though amiably enough, and he reached into the mokeskin pouch around his neck to dig out a cloak that seemed to glitter and shift in the low light from the torches flickering in the sconces around the classroom. The fabric flowed through Potter’s grip like water, swishing and pooling until he spread it out fully—and then it seemed to vanish.

The old red telephone box used as the entrypoint for Ministry visitors was impossible to miss, looking as shabby and dilapidated as ever and still missing multiple windowpanes with the receiver itself hanging at an odd angle.

was Potter getting it into his head to write a tell-all corroborating the public’s worst fears, detailing at length the heinous acts and mischief managed by Draco using his Animagus form.
As the weeks passed, Draco continued to steadily work his way through the Wheezes grab-bag that Potter had procured for him. He found he was partial to most of the sweets—the Shimmering Silver Salt Drops were his favourite, but he could have easily lived without the Edible Dark Marks. He’d yet to try the Kissing Concoction or Flirting Fancies, though; he didn’t know what they were, nor was he very keen to find out.
He would be riding the high that came only to students just out of school for the weekend, with nothing but open skies and dazzling sunshine waiting for him. He would don his gear, toss his brand new Nimbus 2020 over one shoulder, and stride out onto the pitch before kicking off for fun and fancy free.
“Nothing,” Potter said quickly, eyes wide and voice high—then he scrubbed at his hair and sighed. “Listen, you were acting

The rest of July passed in a sticky, syrupy sludge, melted by the baking heat, until Harry’s eighteenth birthday was upon them.
Draco spread his wings and hopped off, gliding the short distance to the sofa cushions before slipping back into his human form, one leg thrown over the other and an appraising eye tracking the room. “Are you quite sure it’s a good idea letting your secret love-child in on my true identity?”
Bragge looked rather uncomfortable. “Well, as you know, Mr. Malfoy’s Animagus form is technically a Dangerous Creature, and given he’s had quite a volatile past, we can’t very well just release him into the wild, as it were, when there’s a risk of his…er, we’ll call it

Draco’s brows quirked up, and he smiled into the draw he took off his bottle. “Well, it’s mastered. So you can stop your harping.”
Potter kept his eyes fixed on the bouncing baby on his knee, grinning for show and not sounding at all like he meant it. “Died in the final battle, protecting the school.” And Potter didn’t carry any judgement in his voice, but Draco heard it all the same: the school wouldn’t have needed protecting had Draco grown a fucking spine and got out while he could, taken up Dumbledore on his offer and

At the end of the tour, Potter wound up checking out with a bulging bag of what the Weasley running the shop had called ‘the works’, a personal recommendation. Draco prayed that these Weasleys were fond enough of their Potter that they wouldn’t knowingly sell him something that might de-cock him. Draco had no idea what he was going to do with it all, but he expected the house-elves would hate it. At the very least, he was unlikely to be bored the rest of his holiday.

“Yeah, you’re a bloody laugh-riot…” He struggled back to his feet, brushing his robes clean (in the loosest sense of the word), and went back to trying to fit the Scops with his letter. “What’s your problem, anyway? I was minding my own business this time.”

Potter followed his gaze, then seemed to finally twig to what the issue was, tugging up the sleeve of his robe to check his watch. “Shite, look at the hour… They’ll all be piling in here any moment now.” He twisted around, unlatching the window again and opening it just wide enough Draco could squeeze through.

“No, yeah. Just. I mean, y’know.” Ron rubbed at the back of his neck, then shrugged. “They—change. Sometimes.” He nodded to himself, evidently relieved, and released a huff of nervous laughter. “So long as it doesn’t suddenly become a dragon.”
“…Er, everyone, in case you didn’t have the chance to get acquainted yesterday, this is…A—Abr—” Potter sighed, shaking his head. “This is Alabastard.” Draco dug his talons into Potter’s shoulder and considered ripping his ear off so he’d have to wear his glasses funny—that was

Draco’s stomach sank, plummeting like he’d swallowed a lead nugget. His innards churned as his breakfast tried to claw its way back up from his gullet, and a cold sweat broke out over his forehead.
“I see,” was all Draco said, suddenly conscious of just how close he’d come to being part of that mountain of paperwork Wentsworth had yet to tackle.
There, just beneath Draco’s perch and peering up through a pair of wire-frame glasses from beneath a messy shock of black hair with a fringe in desperate want of trimming, stood Harry Fucking Potter, still brazenly brandishing the wand with which he’d just stabbed Draco in an act of entirely unwarranted aggression. Only a few years ago and Draco’s father would

Immediately, the broom ballooned in size to that of a regulation Quidditch broom, and in gleaming gold script that raced along the handle were the words
“Oh—yeah.” They continued to look at him expectantly, and he realised they were waiting for details. After all, it was hardly every day Harry went shopping for books that weren’t required reading for school. His mind whirled, and he latched on to the first title that came to mind: “
“It’s not from an admirer,” he grumbled, popping the seal and carefully angling the contents so that Pansy couldn’t see. “Quite the opposite.”
“Er,” Potter said, giving Draco a comfortable berth of several steps. “That was Crookshanks. Hermione’s cat. We’re gonna watch him while she and her folks are in Germany for the holiday to visit family in Dusseldorf.” He frowned to himself, brows knitting in confusion. “I thought he could see through Animagus transformations, though. I’m not sure why he’d attack—oh. Guess he recognised you.”
request, and perhaps if Draco compromised here, he could afford to dig in his heels when Potter pressed him for something more odious later. Besides, half the student population was ogling them at this very moment, and he could truthfully tell anyone who asked he was only tutoring the phenomenally stupid Saviour, perhaps even claim it was part of his probation and thus done only under duress. “Fine.”
he could do. Harry snaked a hand around the back of Draco’s head, drawing him in for a warm, full kiss and promptly swallowing any further remarks. Draco allowed it, but only for a heartbeat, before he slipped a hand between them, deftly plucking at the line of silver buttons down the front of Harry’s robes.

“N-no, sorry, I just—” He scrambled for the potato he’d been in the middle of peeling before Draco had pounced on him, snatching up the paring knife again. “I’m on it, be done in a sec!”
He was in and out inside of fifteen minutes, being a simple man with simple tastes, and after slipping the little brown bag into his pocket, he rejoined Ron and Hermione at the twins’ shop.
Potter didn’t treat him like Draco Malfoy—he treated him like a reliable if ill-tempered owl who was discreet enough to deliver letters to individuals who might or might not be secret lovechildren. And he
Harry wondered, as before, what life might have been like if things had gone just a little different. If not just Draco had been his friend, but Pansy and Theo and Greg and Millie too. He didn’t want to be a Slytherin—he loved those glorious red and gold banners and his lion-hearted friends. He just

So he hopped up one more branch and shuffled, shuffled, shuffled, until he was perched directly over Potter’s head, which was bowed over the old Barred Owl still as he added a little ribbon to the scroll to ensure it stayed fixed to the bird’s leg. Draco sighted himself, took careful aim—

Harry pursed his lips—and then took up the quill.
The Greenhouses were a step up from the Owlery in amenities, and despite being a fair bit further of a trek—for Potter at least—than Gryffindor Tower, they managed well enough. These clandestine meetings for tutoring sessions that would have scandalised the wizarding world at large were actually working out well enough for the both of them. Potter’s marks were definitely improving—though still not up to snuff—and Draco was free to critique and criticise to his heart’s content. Which he did, at every available opportunity.
“Oh, I know. This was more satisfying, though.”
He’d had dreams. Real,

In addition to the odd personal missive, Potter also responded to letters concerning a ‘No 12 Grimmauld Place’, which he seemed to have inherited but was now being contested by a trust, evidently because the previous owner had been a convicted felon and so ownership had reverted to the trust. He could usually tell when Potter was replying to one of

Potter had never been one to learn a lesson, though—in class or outside of it. Draco supposed he should therefore not have been surprised when, three days later, Potter was back in the Owlery, one finger bandaged and scanning the branches with a wild sort of paranoia. Draco was three branches up this time, digesting lunch and feeling quite content in his superiority right about now as Potter plastered himself against the curving tower wall and carefully worked his way around to harass an unfortunate old Barred Owl who had been happily dozing in the warm noontime sun.
“How did preparations for the pre-return rush go at the shop?” he asked Ron.
“What are you doing after school?” he asked, apropos of nothing, and Blaise choked on his scalding tea.

Draco just shrugged. “I can’t possibly lose any more esteem in the eyes of society than I already have—so if you’re bent on ruining your sterling reputation, then let it be on your head.”
He was
This little shit.
Draco caught a look at himself in the full mirror next to his wardrobe: he would have changed into something a bit sharper, were he truly going to visit Blaise as he’d told his mother, but for the likes of Potter, this was more than fine. Anything nicer would surely be wasted on him, as he was no doubt living from one crumb-covered pullover to the next on his winter break.
“Ah!” Potter drew his head back inside for a moment, then poked it out again. “My roommates are in—I’ll meet you in the Owlery, ten minutes.” And giving Draco no chance to protest—though he couldn’t rightly do much more than hiss and scream, and while that was satisfying in its own right, it wouldn’t really help just now—he shut the window and locked it tight.
Helping matters none was that there was no Sanctuary here and thus no way for Draco to really stretch his wings. Indeed, to Harry’s knowledge, he hadn’t transformed at all since the Battle of Hogwarts, and so they were left to find other ways to release tension and reaffirm their bond, a not altogether unpleasant task. Harry still didn’t really like being surprised in the shower, but it was a lot less harrowing knowing there was no one around to overhear them. Draco’s “room” was, as expected, mostly for show, and they shared the king-size four-poster in Sirius’s bedroom.

“All right, all right—I’m sure you know the ins and outs of this delivery business better than I do. Off with you, then.” He shooed Xerxes on his way—then caught himself, just before the owl took flight. “Oh! And—” He lowered his voice, speaking soft and close, for it was a bit scandalous. “…If they offer you a treat for your services, see if you can’t try the Cinnamon Pumpkin Tripe. I’m curious if it’s any good.”
“Your friends are…” he started, searching for appropriate language as Draco helped divest him of his jeans—one button of which had already been undone when Draco started. Fucking Pansy.

His cock was trapped between his stomach and Draco’s arse, and it was

speak, though, and when nothing was forthcoming, he sent the Scops on its way and shoved a hand into his robe pocket, rifling about for a moment until he came out with a handful of owl treats. Carefully, he began stacking them on top of the knot in a little pyramid—and once finished with his handiwork, he took several steps backward, plastering himself against the side of the tower with an expression of wincing hope.

It was a madhouse. Several dozen scarlet-robed witches and wizards were hunched over desks packed cheek-to-jowl, some feverishly scribbling what were likely incident reports, some deep in discussion with colleagues while Self-Scrivening Quills took notes, some taking statements from harried civilians who looked nearly as frightened as Draco felt to be in the midst of it all, and the open room with its high-vaulted ceilings seemed to hum with the low droning roar of multitudes speaking at once, not unlike the Great Hall at mealtimes.
Harry cast his eye about the kitchen, which was piled high with the debris of Mrs. Weasley’s earnest efforts to ensure he had a lovely party, and a wave of guilt crashed against him. She worked herself to the bone for her loved ones, and while Harry appreciated the effort, he hated thinking about how exhausted she had to be, preparing for so many guests, just on account of him.
dead. That was why he was being ridiculously friendly towards Draco when, by all rights, he should have made good on the barbecue threat ten times over by now.
“Weasley’s mother is…” Draco started, and Harry held his breath, waiting. “…stronger than she looks.” He rubbed his arms.

Potter earned several confused looks when he toddled out of the roost room with Draco perched on his shoulder, though one of Weasley’s half a dozen brothers had his head buried in the morning edition of the

Two shakes turned out to be five minutes, and then the same woman from the painting, still eerily familiar to Draco’s eyes, though he couldn’t place why, came swanning out with an infant on her hip that she immediately pressed into Potter’s outstretched arms. “Thank you

His eyes snapped overhead, where he could see Xerxes lazily winging his way back to the Owlery. “…Traitor,” he muttered under his breath. No more treats for
now, trying to keep up with Harry’s mounting pace.
He knew—had known for a while—what decision he was going to make, but he couldn’t shake the fear he was making it more out of wanting to cling to the past than to prepare for the future. Still, the fact was he didn’t feel he’d gotten everything there was to

Draco snatched the box away, suddenly protective. “It’s

“He was lucky to avoid the Kiss.”

,” Harry reminded him, leaned against the door jamb as he watched Draco rifle through his closets. They weren’t bottomless—Harry had checked—but you wouldn’t know it from the sheer volume of fabric Draco managed to find stuffed inside. “It’s not as if they’re going to come cart you away—” Draco’s eyes flashed in warning, and Harry swallowed his tongue. Well that had been the wrong thing to say. He cleared his throat, trying again. “Shouldn’t we wait until Monday, at least? No one’s going to be about today—”
Harry was bemused. “So I’m good at feigning confidence, is what you want to say?”
“You’re mad,” Harry laughed.

? I’ve done rather a lot these past few years to prompt such a question—you’ll really have to be more specific.”
When Draco asked why his attendance was required at what was looking to be a rather raucous reunion of Weasleys, with everyone but Charlie in attendance, Harry had simply turned his own words on him: “Because I want you there.”
To distract himself, he checked Draco’s opinion as they turned in for the evening. “Have you thought any about what McGonagall said?”
“…I don’t like being given orders.”
. He winced when they popped back into existence microseconds later just on the outskirts of Hogsmeade, shading his eyes from the bright morning sun with one hand.
“Due respect, Mr Malfoy,” McGonagall said with a tiny hint of a smile as she reached for an eagle-feather quill and began scrawling her name over a line on the parchment application form, “There’s quite a few people who still think you’re worth something.”
when they’d attempted murder, so this had been
He gave himself an extra five minutes after the Timer Charm went off, just to be sure Draco couldn’t accuse him of rushing this hair-care potion business—which he was pretty sure was just a dollop of Sleekeazy’s mixed with a mousse agent to keep his hair bouncy but tameable. When he stepped back into the bedroom, pink as a fresh-boiled prawn, Draco had already laid out his dress robes on the bed. They weren’t bad, as far as dress robes went—but even the slickest dress robes still felt so…
He came in a rush on one final punishing, punching thrust. He felt his balls empty, pumping into Draco’s arse in a wave of heat and pleasure.
“That was different! It was a matter of life and death, and I didn’t exactly have a

Draco drew back. “Fair?”
Now, it wasn’t that he
“A Hallow.”
, must you?” Draco’s lips drew into a sneer, but there was still an unmistakable tremor in his voice.
. That was his cue to get the fuck out of here.
“Isn’t that what your fan club’s for?” Draco sneered, because here he was again, learning entirely more about Harry Potter than he wanted to. This was starting to sound like another effort at reformation, and Draco was growing bored.
Potter nodded. “His dad was one of my dad’s closest friends. And something of a father-figure to me, too. I thought it only right to return the favour.”
“Give back the Snitch, you wanker!” Potter roared to be heard over the whipping wind. “I can still call in the barbecue favour!
“Well never, Darling, but certainly not because I haven’t offered.” Draco showed him two fingers, and Blaise showed him a bright white smile, settling back against the plush wingback upholstered in a rich purple fabric embroidered with silver
He stopped attending meals in the Great Hall, instead taking them in his room—he hadn’t set foot outside of the Dungeon in nearly two weeks other than to attend classes, and it was doing a wondrous job of keeping the riff-raff from harassing him too much.
. He didn’t want to rely on others, but being relied upon himself seemed to suit him just fine. Or perhaps this was more dragon stuff, like ‘providing for his mate’ or some such rubbish.

Yeah, he was just gonna go with

Potter’s own personal Weasley aside, Draco was actually warming to some of these folks.
Meanwhile, Draco was sitting here wallowing, his greatest goal in life at the moment to lie low enough to survive to his next birthday.
They continued their good-natured bickering all the way back to Grimmauld Place, where they were only interrupted by dinner.
Harry couldn’t even gloat, as whenever he tried to rub in his quicker reflexes, asking if Draco regretted giving Harry his birthday present, he only shrugged. “A win is a win—and a loss is a loss. I’m really not that picky how I come by my victories.” Which was a load of hippogriff shit, but Harry was stuffed with good food, surrounded by good friends, and laden with good presents, so he was in no mood to argue petty details.
Draco glared at him, eyes narrowing in suspicion—like he could see right through Harry’s clever little scheme to make him feel better. “…Are you talking about your head? Or…your
trying to hide his abilities—the fact was he clearly hadn’t been punished severely enough for his crime of ‘not standing up to the Dark Lord because he didn’t want to die, thank you very much,’ and he’d never be allowed to forget that.
, you great knob!” he hissed through grit teeth. “I told you never to Floo the family space!”
No, Draco was Draco, the very same person he’d been six months ago as now: bitter and frustrated and proud and too much a Malfoy to ever be able to be anything but circumspect about what mattered most to him. Because letting someone
, one of the house-elves popped into existence, head bowed and ears flopping forward. “Yes, Master Draco?”
“Oh, of course not,” Potter said easily, and Draco refused to look at him, knowing he had on another infuriating grin. “The thought never crossed my mind.”
“Love you, too…” Draco mumbled, still swaying. He squeezed his arsecheeks around Harry’s cock, grimacing as he glanced over his shoulder. “Salazar’s balls…you actually

Potter swallowed. “Because, like I said, you don’t like me—”
Potter glanced over his shoulder at the crowd passing by just on the other side of the Concealment Charm he’d thrown up to give them some privacy. The alleyway into which he’d ducked once his business in the Owl Emporium had been completed was by no means a glamorous place for a rendezvous, but Draco could at least transform back without fear of being caught out.
“Hey, welcome back!” came a familiar voice, and Draco’s head swivelled around, peering through the foliage. Just inside the window where the Scops had entered stood Potter, hair a mess and glasses askew, but what else was new? The Scops had perched on his shoulder and was nibbling on his ear, and Potter had to gently cup it in his hands and move it down to what Draco could now see was a set of several perches of varying heights. He gave the owl’s legs a once-over—and then frowned, face falling when he saw it had returned empty-taloned. “…Well, thanks anyway, Pig,” he said with a tight smile, reaching into his pocket and feeding it a treat (dare Draco hope these might be Peppermint Ginger Goose Gizzard?) with one hand while he stroked its head gently with the other. “Nice job on the delivery, mate.”
Harry wanted to slug him for

“Ah, shite…” Potter whined. “
It was by mere chance Draco noticed it. He’d taken, of late, to spending a few laps soaring around the castle after dinner to aid his digestion and quiet his thoughts. It was pleasant, really: the brisk night air ruffling his feathers, the sounds of all the inhuman nightlife scattered about the castle grounds, the twinkling dots of candles and lamplight in windows and bracketing doorways upon a sea of black. Things were ever so much simpler as an owl, and he found himself wondering, with a chill of foreboding, if any Animagus had ever been tempted to just…never turn back. To live out their life cocooned safe within an animal form, unbothered by the consequences of decisions—good and bad—made as a human.
Hawthorn, unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably springy, Ollivander had told him. The last time he’d seen his wand, it had been clutched in the grimy paws of…
Draco tried to keep a grin of his own off his features, pursing his lips tightly, but it didn’t really work. “You’re going to make us late.”
After dinner, they bid their goodnights and returned to their rooms to get ready for bed. For Harry and Draco, there was no repeat of the previous night—nor anything similar, in part because their housemates were in residence and in part because Draco still seemed a bit sore, wincing when he took a seat or rose to his feet. It had sent a guilty little thrill through Harry every time it happened, and he’d worked very hard to keep it from showing on his features, but he wasn’t sure how successful he’d been. No, Draco would certainly let him know when he was ready for another round.
“If not before, it certainly is

“Damned if I know. I think all they found of him after his house was blown sky-high in the resulting explosion was a couple of teeth.” Ron speared a mini sausage from his baked beans onto his fork. “Muggle electrigs don’t work too well around magic.”
Draco gave him a withering look.
“I wasn’t—going to
Potter presume such familiarity. “I—have
“Ohhh…” Potter said, with a whining groan. “This feels like a trap.”
Deciding they had kept themselves cooped up in their little love nest long enough, and that lunches at the Manor definitely did not count as proper outings, Harry threw his weight into convincing Draco to come visit the Burrow with him, finally managing it well into June. He hadn’t wanted the Weasleys to think he was avoiding them, but he’d needed a bit of time to himself—and to Draco—after that final battle. It was quiet in Grimmauld Place, and there had been a comfortable rhythm with Draco that did not involve Muggle gadgets and gizmos and a house fit to bursting with life. Harry loved the Weasleys, but he was finding out there were a lot of other things he loved as well, so he’d kind of been enjoying his little holiday, as it were.
Potter just stood there, slumped against the tower with a drunken sort of cock-eyed grin on his lips. “Come on, it’s still a passing grade. I was only being honest, after all. We aren’t friends, so I’m sure you wouldn’t want me coddling you.” Draco shoved away with a rough, gruff
Harry wanted to sink through the floor, and Draco was flushed so red Harry expected to see steam start shooting out of his ears. Or lava belching from his mouth, one or the other.
“Robards?” Potter frowned, nose wrinkling. “The Head Auror?” Draco nodded. “…Never. I’ve never spoken to him.”
spent that…”
But ‘weird’ wasn’t the worst quality in the world, nor was Potter being weird any great shock. It was just another one of those foibles Draco was learning about, tearing aside the perfect facade others saw in Potter and exposing him for the ridiculous wanker he was underneath.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said, clapping him on the shoulder. “If it changed, it’d probably become a peacock.”
“Nothing,” Draco sighed, still smiling for whatever odd reason. “I’m just stupidly taken with you when you say that word. I can’t stand you on the best of days, and this helps matters none.”
? “…I did pick a side.” Potter’s frown was less offended and more confused, so Draco painted him a picture. “You said I didn’t, and that’s why everything went to shit for me. But I

“You should, yeah—I spelled it, do it.

said Stealth and Tracking, and Draco didn’t know the particulars of that little subdepartment, but it sounded like his duties would be more reconnaissance-oriented. Spying and the like, perhaps tailing marks or keeping watch over suspects and reporting back—
Harry watched him go, feeling suddenly impotent. He wanted to follow, wanted to fly with him, or just be there when he tired himself out, as he was likely intending to do. Working himself to exhaustion was Draco’s way of ensuring he slept like the dead, more effective than any Dreamless Sleep. It was invariably a signal he was worked up—and he did not want Harry to follow him. Harry had been unaccountably hurt, those first few times Draco had done it back in the tent, feeling dismissed and shut out, though he’d told himself this was only because he

Wentsworth gave a gruff chuckle. “Well, you’re keeping your marks up, that’s good to see. Any plans for the upcoming holiday?”

more respectable form than the field mouse or sea snake, Draco had to admit. Ubiquitous in the wizarding world, he would never stand out or be a source of curiosity or suspicion. One could likely not have asked for a better form for being able to while away the hours, unremarked, large enough he needn’t fear any predators but small enough he would draw no attention. He was, on consideration,
bit of fucking Draco.
Like right about now, as the Malfoys’ army of house-elves was shuttling away the remains of the main course and bringing out dessert—a crème brûlée with hints of treacle, which Harry suspected had been prepared special at Draco’s command. Lucius had downed nearly half the bottle of wine the elves had produced for the table, pointedly ignoring his wife’s soft throat-clearing whenever he moved to top off his glass, and looked like there were only about a thousand places he’d rather be than settling in for sweets with the Boy Who Was Sleeping With His Son.
“They said we should head on without them; they’re going to linger a bit for farewells, since they’ve already decided they aren’t coming back.”
“The people who matter won’t care—they’ll understand,” Harry tried to reassure.
Oh, so he had. And now that he paused to think about it, he was starving himself, hunger pangs evidently having been shunted aside by wild fury and panic. He checked his pocket watch, not liking what he saw. “…I expect they’ve closed the kitchens by now.”
agree…” Draco muttered, tearing into his pot pie with vigour. Weasley’s mother seemed partial to the kind of cuisine that stuck to the ribs, and Draco was living for it. He was going to be in a state three days from now when he had to go back to the house-elves and their pint-size portions.
Fuck, it was
“And what am I supposed to have meddled in? There’s rather a lot of places I’m neither wanted nor needed, so a bit of specificity would be appreciated.”
Potter’s glare was cold and empty, and Draco could sense the disappointment radiating off of him.
But the next night as well, there was Potter, curled up next to the window as he pored over another lengthy strip of parchment. This time, Draco buzzed the window, buffeting it with one wing to startle Potter, who jerked to attention. A moment later, the window was eased further open as Potter poked his head out. “You coming inside? Or just doing a flyby to harass me? The others are downstairs again, if you want to pop in.”
“So thoughtful, our Saviour…” Draco drawled. “Spells, Harry. They’re very useful.”
with joy at the prospect of being an Auror of all things?
“Uh, yeah?” Harry laughed. “What else would it be?”
His bedroom was dark, though Draco could see clearly enough with the faint moonlight filtering in through the windows, and he winced inwardly when Potter seemed to unerringly manage to trip over every object possible, hissing oaths under his breath. Draco nibbled on his fingers to remind him to be
Oh god, he really was going to just collapse right here, on the floor; Draco would never let him live it down. He tried not to seem like he was obviously clinging to Draco for support when he asked thickly, “And—you?”

, and the fireplace right in front of the couch Draco had been enjoying his morning sprawled upon flared to life in a burst of green Floo flame, as Harry-fucking-Potter poked his oversized head through.
Draco seized around him with a crying shout, hands reaching out for something—anything—and Harry grabbed on, lacing their fingers together. Draco’s arsecheeks clenched, and his cock bobbed, spurting long white strips of spunk over Harry’s stomach and chest—and a little on the duvet as well. Harry kept pumping, hips working on their own like a toy winding down. Each thrust was shallower, gentler than the last, until he finally collapsed onto the bed after he’d been drained of what felt like every last bit of life.

fantasy…” Harry protested weakly.
He focused on giving it to Draco just how he’d begged—hard and hot and fast, pouring back into him the same desperation and arousal that thrummed through Harry’s veins. A constant, thrilling cycle of sex and sweat and desire. Harry watched his cock disappear into Draco’s arse, glistening with lubricant and his own leaking fluids, and Draco’s cock was dribbling all over Harry’s stomach in prelude.
Well, that was a lie. It was not just signing ‘a few’ forms; it was signing a whole

tired of doing the latter.
True enough; they had tried to warn him off Draco time and time again, and yet he’d still wound up here all the same. Somehow, though, Harry didn’t really mind so much that it felt like yet another situation in which he’d had no say, been given no choice. Maybe because Draco was in much the same position—what had the locket said?
Oh, so that was what those spells had been. Spells to stretch, spells to dull pain, probably even prophylactic spells.
Potter held Draco gently clutched against his chest as he crept along the corridors, unremarked by even the portraits. On occasion, he’d pause to pull out a folded piece of parchment, consulting it with a frown, but then he’d put it away again and they’d continue on. After what felt like an interminable amount of time, Potter finally prodded the portrait of the Fat Lady that marked the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, giving the password and ignoring her sleepily mumbled reprimands against breaking curfew as he carefully crawled into the Common Room and made his way for the stairs.
Draco softly cleared his throat. “Y—yes, sir. June. I was meant to graduate last year, but…my coursework was interrupted.” Thomassen laughed at this, a short little snorting bark, but it didn’t sound entirely cruel, so Draco continued on. “When Headmistress McGonagall invited students back to complete their studies under less-fraught circumstances, I...took the Ministry’s good advice and accepted.”
Draco kissed him, again, trying to swallow him down from the inside out. “You

, because that was what you were supposed to say. If you were with someone you wanted to be with, even if everyone else thought you’d lost the plot, you at least were expected to be confident in your choice, to stand up for it. But this was Hermione, and she wasn’t asking for what he thought was the right answer. She just wanted to know.
“What?”
“Why wouldn’t they?” Draco butted in, suddenly fearful.
Harry frowned. “…It’s really that bad?” There was flirtatious teasing, and then there was thoughtless cruelty; he’d never be able to forgive himself if he stumbled into the latter just because it got his cock hard. “Should we—” He didn’t want to say

“Please; you’re utterly bereft of the Black line’s exquisite bone structure,” Draco sniffed. He turned to Harry. “We’ll have to blast ‘Noble’ off the family tapestry now.”
Harry’s brows knit in confusion. “But—oh.” Realisation hit him with the raw force of a bolt of lightning, and his throat went dry. “
After another ten minutes of demonstrations, Bragge seemed satisfied and ticked the final box on his form, giving Draco leave to shift back.
so he couldn’t even get his bearings again. Oh he was going to take a finger for this, he really was.
Draco drew back, just a tick, enough to where Potter’s stupid glasses weren’t digging into his cheek anymore. He couldn’t make out Potter’s eyes behind the fogged-up lenses, and he wondered if his pupils were blown wide. Shit, he quite wanted to see that.
Harry felt his ears grow hot; god, this was going to fuel Draco’s teasing until Christmas. “That’s rubbish, though! It’s just people heaping expectations on me.”
Harry had broken him out of the Ministry, why he’d had to tag along on their very dangerous and very secret quest. Perhaps they wondered, but they didn’t ask, and so they didn’t know.
“Obviously. I meant where did you

Potter must have noticed him struggling to get his bearings, for he slipped away from the mass of Weasleys, feigning interest in one of the corner displays, and said quietly as if speaking to himself, “I’ll make my way around the shop so you can see the shelves up close. If there’s anything you’re particularly interested in purchasing, then…I dunno, maybe nip my ear gently—emphasis on the

Draco’s brows lifted, impressed. “Ooh, so my parents, too…?”
Weasley gave a short, snorting laugh, going back to his magazine. “Yeah, that’s for sure.”
?” It was very difficult to look on the bright side of the situation, but he was bent on being the bigger man here. Parkinson and Goyle embodied the very worst aspects of Slytherin’s finer traits, but Draco had been friends with them, once upon a time, and if he was still of a mind to call them as such, then Harry didn’t want to stand in the way.
“Well they’d better start wanting to, then. That’s the third time in as many weeks the morning paper’s landed in a dish—I’m going to cancel my subscription, I really am.”

Draco frowned, grey eyes suddenly sharp. “I thought I told you—”
“If they ask, I’ll just say they’re ‘M word rings’. That should be
But Potter was only smiling, a little self-deprecating thing that put Draco on edge—perhaps the shock of realising that Alabastard was only Draco Malfoy in transformation had pushed him over the edge, and he was about to finish the job he’d started in the sixth-floor boys’ bathroom the previous year.
, and Potter frowned. “…What, you don’t agree?”
you?” Potter asked, daring to take off his ridiculous hat; a wise move, as Draco had been contemplating swooping down upon him and carrying it off, perhaps leaving it for Potter to find later atop the Gryffindor stands out on the Quidditch pitch. “You haven’t got one of the school crests, and you aren’t banded like the other students’ birds…” He frowned. “You don’t belong to one of the professors, do you?” He then paled with dawning realisation. “Oh god, you aren’t…you aren’t
Well, not that he’d necessarily be rushing into battle anywhere. Thomassen
“Why do you subscribe to that rubbish anyway, Pans?” came Blaise’s drawl from behind the both of them as he plopped down beside her, twisting to straddle the bench, one elbow propped up on the table. “It’s dead boring these days.”
Draco was difficult to miss when he joined them at the shop, his shock of white hair standing out amidst the crowd, and with their party finally convened, they followed Fred and George’s lead to a charming little pub owned in part by Lee Jordan, just a bit further down the street.
“I wasn’t trying—”
There was that feeling again—the odd sensation that turned his stomach, realising he was learning more about Potter than he wanted. The old saying was hogwash; familiarity did
Draco’s eyes travelled over his bare flesh, from his neck, down over the Killing Curse scar on his chest, to the little trail of black hairs leading down to his cock—which, traitor that it was, gave a twitch of greeting. “Not a bad stiff.” He leered at Harry, sinfully close, his fingers tapping suggestively at Harry’s hips. “You know, I’ll bet I could pop down to the Sanctuary for a transformation and be right as rain, ready for another round in a moment flat.”
“Oh, I can’t be certain. I’m sure it’s nothing serious, though, or he would have sent a summons directly. This was only an inter-office memo.” He held the wrinkled crane up for Draco to see, but it was impossible to make out the writing. Damn useless human eyes.
Draco lashed out, snapping up the treat but leaving Potter’s fingers intact; the satisfaction would only be momentary, he reminded himself, and Potter would raise a stink about it. The last thing Draco wanted these days was attention; oh how far he’d fallen since First Year.
for me. In a while, but this…” He closed his eyes and shook his head, and Harry drew close, taking Draco’s hands in his own and running a thumb over his knuckles.
Once Pig had worked his way through his pile of treats, he hopped onto Draco’s desk and began to do a funny little dance, clearly waiting for Draco to entrust him with a letter in return. “No return post,” Draco said, and Pig seemed to wilt. “Well you evidently won’t shit on him for me, so what else can I possibly ask?” He leaned in close and said, conspiratorially, “He told

Potter seemed to rein in his emotions, though, standing and shuffling into the kitchen where he grabbed an everwarm pot and began to brew a cup of tea in a little mug hanging from a hook over the sink. After a moment’s consideration, he grabbed a second mug and returned, shortly, with a cup for Draco, too. When Draco stared at him like he’d grown a second head, he shrugged and set the mug down on a little coaster next to

“The Burrow”, as Draco (quite against his will) learned the Weasleys called their home, was as much a mess on the inside as it appeared on the outside. Cluttered and cramped quarters, the design left Draco with the unsettling feeling of being trapped inside living walls, though he supposed a certain sort might find it

Draco toed off his loafers by the door, hanging his robes on a line of hooks jutting from the wall, and strode over to the handsome roll-top he’d brought from his room at home, shrunken in his pocket the first day of the new term.

And so, he left his mother to wage war against the peacocks, returning to his room with a pep in his step. The little Scops was still waiting for him on his desk, and seeing him stride through the door, it broke out into an excited jig, claws tip-tapping on the polished mahogany.

“All right? Er—all right what?”
“What?”
But when he doffed his human form and slipped into his owl shape, suddenly everything at once became both less complicated and more.
“These are rings, Potter.” Oh
“Hear about him? You only wrote to him every other day, practically. About the most inane shit, too—honestly, I read your letters to fall asleep some nights. Just—” He snapped his fingers. “Sent me right off.” He wrinkled his nose. “…Is he not family, then? Your bastard, mayhaps?”

It turned out Draco was

“Ooh…” Blaise threw an arm around Draco’s neck, drawing him close, and they stumbled as they passed under the awning fronting the courtyard. “
With nothing better to do, Draco spent most of the morning perched upon the newly repaired dome of Gringotts, watching the crowd of last-minute shoppers milling below and feeling very glad he was not puttering about amongst the unwashed masses.
“Lupin? Not Tonks?” Draco made a face. “Wait—

As they made their way down to the kitchen, the sounds of activity greeted them: bangs and clangs of pans, the hiss of running water, and the soft murmur of quiet conversation. Hermione and Ron were back, it seemed, which meant Harry and Draco’s idyllic morning was at an end. That would teach him to sleep in.
Draco felt himself wilt, just a hair—he’d absolutely fucked up, coming here. He’d been bored—but Potter hadn’t, he

“How did your parents take the news of your going back to Hogwarts, Draco?” Hermione asked, perhaps thinking Draco might be feeling left out of the conversation. From the way he winced at being pulled into their cheery banter, Harry doubted that was the case.
“How’d you get here?” Potter repeated.
“Because…” Potter frowned, a line of worry forming between his brows. “Because my friends are either busy with their own studies or need a tutor themselves. Plus you hate me, so I can at least trust you to be strict with me. And your marks were always only second to Hermione’s so…I mean, you know your shit.” He made a face, nose wrinkling. “…You aren’t going to put this memory in a Pensieve or something so you can dive in for instant replay whenever you want to hear me saying you’re smarter than I am, are you?”

Draco paused, parsing the words carefully—then pulled away with a pinched frown. “Did you just

After all—” He shrugged. “They weren’t all that private, aside from the exchanges with the bank. And you don’t seem half as eager to go running to Rita Skeeter with stories about me these days.”
“Now, are you quite sure you can deliver this by eight tonight? It’s London, you know—hardly a hop and a skip.” Xerxes fixed Draco with a hard glare, ruffling his feathers in offence as if to say
“You aren’t some hopeless cause, you know. You’ve only got a few more hurdles than others might. Maybe if you stopped feeling so sorry for yourself and moping about, you’d see that.”
at least.”
As Ron told it, Mrs. Weasley had understood his need to recover, always asking after Harry when Ron popped in but never pressing for more, and Ron had returned to Grimmauld Place after each visit laden with baked goods clearly prepared with a healthy dash of love. Still, Harry felt the tiniest bit guilty, and given he could hardly leave Draco alone to stew while he popped over to Ottery St. Catchpole, they would have to go together.
Draco gave him a bemused look. “You didn’t tell them?”
“What,
Draco pinned Harry’s to his robe for him with an exaggerated roll of his eyes. “As if your overinflated melon of a head needed to get any fatter than it already is…”
look fit enough after all these years under her roof; I think I’ll survive.”
As October stretched on and the lazy, warm days of summer at last came to a close, though, Potter’s “visits” became less frequent, until by Halloween, he might go a week without showing up at all. This, Draco was perfectly pleased with—except he’d grown fond of the brand of owl treats Potter seemed to have an endless supply of, and he was starting to get cravings even as a human, which was most disconcerting. Undoubtedly they’d be absolutely

Draco gave up shoving and swivelled around, bracing the sole of a polished loafer squarely between Potter’s eyes and giving a violent kick until the Floo went dark once more, the connection abruptly cut.
prepare your gift for me? And they say Gryffindors aren’t romantic.”
Draco hopped down, reassuming his human form, and made himself comfortable again on one of the burlap sacks. “Well, you deserved it.”
Leery of dawdling too long in the atrium, lest Harry find himself hounded by well-wishers eager to express their gratitude to the Boy Who Lived in person, they quickly made their way to the lifts after having their wands checked at the security desk, and then it was up to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Harry had hoped that, once inside the Ministry proper, he wouldn’t have to worry about being approached by strangers wanting to shake his hand or kiss the metaphorical ring, but the lift ride up was a crowded one for a Sunday, and he was quite possibly the most recognisable face in all of wizarding England at the moment.
It was almost like back in late summer the year before, when he and Ron and Hermione had been stuck here. Except they weren’t living in fear for their lives anymore, and Draco was here now, so it was actually pretty nice. Grimmauld Place was a lot bigger than Perkins’ tent, even with its expanded interior, so they had all the room they might want to spread out. Plus, Kreacher had kept the place spotless, even after their abrupt departure, so while the decor still left something to be desired, it was as fine a place as any for four friends to share.
“I don’t—” Harry started, then changed his mind halfway through. “I don’t know. Maybe? I’ve never

hear you say that.”
Right, time to change the topic. He cleared his throat softly. “So, uh, I think we’ve decided—me and Draco, I mean—that we’re going to go back for the Eighth-year curriculum they’re offering at Hogwarts.”
“Please don’t bite me, please don’t bite me, please don’t bite me…” he muttered as a mantra under his breath, before switching to, “God, I really hope you don’t belong to anyone. This isn’t stealing, understand? If you’ve got an owner, I’d appreciate you explaining the situation to them. These are, er, extenuating circumstances.”
does, and she tells me things, and sometimes I pay attention.” He sighed and crossed his arms. “…You know, we’re spending an awful lot of effort trying to find someplace private for you to help me study. Why not just use the Library, like everyone else? I certainly don’t want to spend any more time around books than necessary, but at least it’d be quiet there. And warm. And it wouldn’t stink.”

“I—Malfoy, seriously, I don’t have the faintest clue what you’re—”
Draco made a swipe for it, but Harry slipped it back into the packet of papers they needed to return to the Registrar. “Just remember you said that when I start shitting in your shoes or rutting against your leg while there’s company over.”
Draco carefully collected himself, being completely, baldly honest when he said, “I’m not—we aren’t friends.”
“I have something to confess: I didn’t know if I wanted to come here tonight. I’ve been helping out over the summer with the rebuilding efforts, as have many of you, but…there’s a difference between reconstruction and…and acceptance. Trying to move on. That’s a lot harder to do than just relaying bricks or applying Charms.
Harry brought his hands up to hold Draco by the hips, hissing in pleasure as he bucked into the slow, delicious friction. “Ah

amusing) start to their interactions was a cool reminder to Draco of what he’d confronted Potter for in the first place this evening, and he squared his shoulders and steeled himself to once more bow his head. He’d gotten very good at it these past several months, and he expected there was room yet to grow even further. Such a bright future to look forward to, nose pressed to the ground and apologies on his lips until his dying day.

It was still a marvel, seeing that bare expanse of smooth, porcelain skin, no horrible lacerations to remind Harry of what his thoughtless actions had nearly cost him. “Not so different,” Draco said, and Harry could feel it now: the racing
