The snoring from Gregg’s bed work Draco, he groaned in annoyance. The persistent noise irritated Draco to know end so he threw an errant book at Gregg’s bed. The snoring was cut off briefly before it started again. Noting Zabini’s empty bed, Draco headed to the washroom to begin his mourning routine.
After Malfoy had kicked him out, Harry had ambled back to the Gryffindor Common room to grab his bag. In the Main Hall; Harry found Malfoy stood in the doorway. Their eyes met and they looked at their respective table. Harry didn’t want Malfoy contaminating his table and he didn’t want to sit with Slytherins. From the look on Malfoys face he felt the same. Harry contemplated skipping breakfast, but his stomach rumbled.
With the clear dismissal Harry hurried to leave Malfoy’s bedroom. After a few wrong turns Harry found the Common room. It was still mercifully empty. So, Harry plopped himself down on a chair near the window and watched the creature move through the water. He felt at peace in the silent room. Even though the room was much colder than Gryffindor’s, the water had a calming effect. His eyes closed.
“Oh please Mr Malfoy could you get sap from the yew tree” wined Draco “its very easy to find and since its you it should be fine.” Draco was doing a poor impersonation of Professor Sprout. “Why of course professor, anything you say professor” Draco stopped and curtsied. “Merlin, why did I agree to this? What a great plan lets go to the forbidden forest.” As he got closer to the forest Draco slowed down, fear crept into his features.
I know you’re under a lot of pressure, but this won’t solve anything. I told you not to draw attention to yourself. I promised your mother I would look after you. I swore an unbreakable vow.
Once on the pitch, the cold air helped to clear his head of his his dream and Harry felt his spirits lift. He mounted his broom and pushed of into air. He practised some spins and turns until he felt fully awake. He slowed to rest on his broom and looked over at Hogwarts. The morning sun hadn’t fully risen, and he watched as clouds sleepily moved past. Feeling sentimental, Harry looked around the stadium and remembered some of the best moments. With Newts, Harry wasn’t likely going to have as much time to practice. And with Voldemort back, who knew how long he had to enjoy this. Harry felt his mood plummet and his speed increase. He crouched low on is broom and zipped through the stadium, testing out different moves. The more he thought about Voldy, the faster he went, until he was flying past the stadium and the lake, past Hagrid’s hut and into the forbidden forest. He realised how fast he was going but spurred on by the skill it took not to hit a tree he pushed on harder. Although the sun had now fully risen his vision was difficult in the woods. Considering this is was no surprise Harry hit a tree and passed out instantly.
He gently patted his chair. Draco moved towards Blaise chair. He picked up Potter’s shoe and tossed it in the boy’s general direction. There was a thunk and Potter grumbled.
Draco sat back on his heals. With the space between them he finally met Potter’s eyes. Potter was furious. Draco cocked his head, not really sure how Potter had ended up in the state he was in, and not really caring. He unbound Potter and then pulled out the gag. That explains the sock. Potter stretched out his limbs and shot Blaise a dirt look. As Potter went about putting his sock back on Draco made to leave for breakfast.
Potter looked to Malfoy for help, but Malfoy wanted the answer as well, if Potter got hurt in the process well that was just a plus.
“Yeah, were looping back to the beginning of the day. So, all we need to do is prevent the day from looping” Malfoy finished triumphantly.
“Let’s try again tomorrow” he said to Potter. Potter’s mouth gaped open at him. With a flourish of his robes he summoned his broom and led his piers away from the pitch, leaving Potter to mope.
Her classroom was empty and when they found her in her adjacent office, she greeted them with as much enthusiasm as could be expected of seeing a student with a beak.
Out in the cold Scottish air, Harry flew hard and fast. Sweat dripped down his back and he couldn’t tell if it was the remanence of his dream or just new. What was Voldemort’s plan? How did Malfoy enter into it? In the forest why did he- Harry stopped his line of thinking, he turned sharply. In the distance he could see the Forest looming. What had he been thinking… Malfoy in… the forest? He flew closer to the Forest until he was just on the edge. He planted his feet on the ground and stared into the darkness. The trees hung heavily over his head. He remembered flashes of himself flying through the forest. And unconsciously felt his ribs. When had that happened? Was it a dream? He inhaled deeply; he still remembered the earthy smell from his dream. Deep and cold. He looked behind him, the sun was rising over Hogwarts and it reflected of the windows and across the lake, warm and inviting. He turned back to the Forest and stepped inside.
“Or at least I know something is wrong, the two of you together means there must be something afoot”
“Mornin’ Luna” responded Harry warily. He dropped his bag on the bench and ducked his head in an attempt to ignore the people around him.
“Fine, let’s go now” Draco said, he watched Potter’s face change. Unable to place the emotion he saw Draco lead the way to McGonagall’s office.
“Where you off to so early?” Blaise enquired. He eyes Draco up and down, no doubt wondering why he wasn’t dressed.
“Alright everyone,” Began McGonagall “I expect you to perform this incantation silently next lesson, this should be simple”
Harry watched Malfoy raise his hand and slowly Malfoy’s wand slid across the floor into its owners’ hand. Malfoy pointed his wand tip to his face and sliding it over his skin it started to heal. Harry’s mouth gaped. Healing magic was pretty advanced, especially for Malfoy. And the thing with his wand. That was wandless magic. Harry narrowed his eyes. Malfoy was pretty average a most things, Potions less so. Harry begrudgingly could admit that. He turned to his wand and tried to summon it, nothing happened. He imagined it was like summoning his broom. Up! He thought, it didn’t move. Malfoy bent and retrieved Harry’s wand. Harry frowned. He looked up to find Malfoy holding his hand out, his face a blank expression. Harry snatched his wand and cradled it to his chest. He hobbled to his feet and eyed Malfoy suspiciously.
McGonagall it seemed didn’t know much about time travel, but she did know how containment spells worked. It was a long process, but she explained to them how they needed to find whatever it was that was keeping them to try to break free. She didn’t believe brute force would help them and that I may do more damage. Additionally, it would do no help to find the caster of the spell. Once a containment was created it couldn’t be altered. Instead in order to escape they needed to learn and fulfil the magical requirements.
His feet gently touched the floor and his legs flipped back up in response to the cold. He placed his feet on the ground, and hissed when the cold seeped in. His memory was murky, but he could place a forest of some sort and red eyes that gleefully watched him. It sounded like a Voldemort dream, not an odd occurrence but the frequency of these were beginning to annoy Harry. After a few half-hearted pats on his bedside table, he managed to find his glasses and slipped out of bed. Wand tucked into his sleeve, he shivered over to the bathroom.
Fuck this day thought Malfoy Fuck you Notts. Malfoy had to deal with Notts jibes all morning, he was getting sick of listening to the prat. Notts was the perpetual gramophone blaring in his ear about his failures.
Draco had always been a huge fan of Salazar; he took great pride in his heritage and being a Slytherin. In his first year he had explored every inch of Hogwarts, he had tried to learn every secrete he could about the areas built by Salazar. It was obvious that the Slytherin Door would open with Parseltongue that was just like Salazar to assume only Purebloods received his gifts. Right next to him was someone who could talk to snakes. A man who had received his gifts directly from Salazar himself. Draco pushed his emotion into the soles of his feet, into the ground as far as it could go until it wasn’t his.
“And the faces?” she asked, she eyed them from under her nose. A peculiar achievement considering they were both taller than them.
“Well it can’t be a time turner” Harry’s face darkened. “They’re all gone, and the only time incident I know is the case of Phileas Haol.” Harry leant forward.
Harry and Potter spent most of the morning trying to figure out what could be keeping them there. When breakfast came McGonagall pushed them out of her room and shooed them to hall.
After waking from the same nightmare and settling his nerves. Harry headed to the pitch. He sat on his broom and watched the sun rise. He couldn’t stop thinking about his dream and, Voldemort’s watchful gaze. How much could he see of Harry’s life? Was he able to see Harry’s thoughts? Was he putting people in danger? He couldn’t help but worry. He took of around the pitch at full speed, everywhere he looked he saw Voly’s eyes watching him, he pushed his broom faster and faster. He spun and looped through the hopes. He ducked and dove through the stands, chasing an imaginary snitch. If only he could go faster, push harder.
Draco pushed himself from the wall he found himself leaning against. His mother would chastise him for his posture.
“Are you deaf as well as dumb?” asked Draco. Potters face snapped to Draco’s and he glared and Draco. Malfoy’s don’t fear. Draco straightened his back and prepared himself for another fight.
“Well” huffed Ron, “you should shower at least mate” he rubbed Harry on the shoulder “you stink” he said with a smile. Harry looked up at Ron and smiled back.
“Morning Draco” said Blaise, he snapped his book closed. “you’ll never guess what I found this morning”.
Harry’s throat slid shut and his eyes snapped open. He couldn’t breathe, his hands brushed against his throat, there wasn’t anything there. He thumped his fists on his mattress. Breathe! He screamed. Everywhere he looked red eyes watched him. It’s not real! His mouth opened in a silent scream and his body shook. Over the sounds of his thrashing he could hear Ron move. Harry stilled; he wouldn’t let Ron see the extent his nightmares where having on him. He rolled onto his front and clenched his pillow. A meadow flashed through his mind, he imagined the sun shining through the leaves, the smell of the forest. He spread his fingers as if he could feel the soil. Breathe. He inhaled sharply, the air rattling through his chest. Breathe. Again, he sucked in the air, his eyes prickling from the pain. His body slumped into his mattress. He forced his chest to relax as he continued to breathe deeply.
“Oh, Draco do be careful” mocked Blaise. Draco worked hard to ignore Blaise’s comments, but they always seemed to seep under his skin.
He knew Blaise wouldn’t miss up the chance to follow Draco. Draco took great pleasure in his appearance; it was a well-known fact. Blaise would never miss the opportunity for entertainment. Draco imagined Blaise thought it was the end of the world, or at least Draco’s. And maybe it was, Draco certainly felt his emotions matched that idea.
He looked up to find McGonagall leant over Parvarti’s desk. She directed Parvati’s wand over the ring in front of her. What were they meant to be learning? His eyes flicked down to his own ring and then to Ron who was staring into space, no help there. He turned to Hermione to find her watching him. Her sharp expression shifted to something softer as she flicked her wand to the textbook.
“it’s either Malfoy or Snape with you three” said Neville “and if I don’t know what happening then it’s not Snape” He shuddered.
“Ron, did Seamus blow up his cauldron yesterday or the day before?” Ron’s eyes glazed over in memory
“Fine I don’t care” Harry turned back to his food and helped himself to some pumpkin juice. They sat eating silently together, ignoring the stares around them.
“Bullshit, why are you following me?” he clenched Potter’s wrist, taking pleasure from Potters pained expression he tightened his hand.
“I’m sorry Ron, I need to go” he followed after Malfoy his head hung in shame. Malfoy threw a smirk over his shoulder and left the hall in a flourish, Harry trailed after him.
It was still early, but Draco hadn’t given much thought as to Potter’s whereabouts until he spotted him by the fire. Surprise nearly knocked him from his feet, but he pushed through the emotion and forced his legs to lead him to the fireplace. Blaise was sat in a nearby chair reading from his Rune Journal. While Pansy began catching Draco up with her morning gossip, Draco scanned the faces in the room. Only a few people were awake, and although they were all looked busy, Draco was sure they were focused on Potter.
“Potter are you coming?” asked Malfoy, well not so much of a question more of a loud demand, enough to gather everyone’s attention. Harry made to follow him; Ron grabbed his arm to stop him.
Harry rolled his eyes; he could imagine the face Ron was making. They rounded the corner, Harry could feel himself salivating, he just wanted to get to the Dining Hall. He could manage their affection if he had food in his stomach.
“I should take my leave and get back to his task” he nodded to the table and left. No point in eating lunch, he hadn’t been hungry in a while.
Harry took the potion and cradled it in his hand. He eyed the bottle suspiciously, but it looked like a normal Murtlap Essence. He poured some of the contents into his hand sniffed it and then smeared it on his face. Instantly his face seemed to calm.
“Harry, its okay take a deep breath” said Hermione, she reached to pull Malfoy from Harry’s arm. As if sensing this he jerked from her and dropped Harry’s arm in the process. Harry pulled his hand through his hair and straightened.
“We could always ask pro-“ Potter’s words were cut of as his mouth transformed into a beak. Potter touched his face and his eyes froze on Draco. He’d done it, my god its harmless and only lasts and hour or so but the shame of having a duck face. Draco felt the laughter bubble inside of him. It spilled out as he watched Potter try to speak.
“Wanna race?” Draco was pulled from his musing by Potter. Finally finished with his showing off, Potter was now floating near Draco. Draco felt the challenge flutter in his chest. He answered Potter’s smile with one of his owns, a simple quirk of his lips. He noted Potter’s sudden interest in the ground.
He headed to the lake as fast as he could, Potter close on his tail. In the corner of his eyes he could see Potter gaining on him. He leant the back of his broom in the lake feeling the water spray behind him. He heard Potter shout, he shot a smirk over his shoulder and increased his speed.
Potter seemed to struggle to look away from Draco. Dumbledore repeated himself and yet Potter still didn’t look away.
“No” said Draco after he caught his breath “we’re not stuck” he laughed gently, smiling as the sun warmed his face.
“Uh..” he faced Ron again. He could see the rest of his friends settling at his table. They watched him curiously. Hermione’s face was particularly worried.
All around him students were standing away from the tables, watching him fearfully. Harry spotted Dumbledore making his way down the tables. Harry was confused, why were they all watching him?
“I don’t see why that’s any of your business Potter” he said Harry’s name like an insult. Harry felt himself fill with anger, Why was Malfoy such a prat?!
Harry stared out the window, his head slumped on his hand. In the distance he could hear Hermione as she furiously scratched away at her paper. Newt preparation was a ball ache and everyday Harry’s focus slipped. He had more important things to think about than tests. Voldemort was back. People were looking to him to find the solution and Harry was crumbling under the pressure. He couldn’t remember the last time he slept well, it was probably the lack of sleep affecting his focus, right?
They headed deeper into the Slytherin’s den. Harry couldn’t figure out why Zabini was letting him see more of the space. Surely, he was showing too much to Harry. A cold sweat dripped down Harry’s back, he snuck a glance at Zabini. Zabini seemed to flow through the corridor, he was a tall as Ron. But where Ron felt lanky and awkward Zabini moved with a confidence. When his eyes met Harry’s, Harry flushed and focused on his feet.
“Oh yes I can see” Draco raised an eyebrow, in Blaise’s direction. Draco was impressed, Potter was well known for his duelling skill, and from the looks of its, Blaise had easily managed to subdue him. Draco stifled a smile.
“Ah, Potter” Harry heard his name and his eyes locked with Malfoys sneering face. Malfoy was walking with Zabini and Parkinson flanking him. “How’s your nose?” said Malfoy his own pointed nose was turned up and he eyed Harry. Harry still couldn’t believe the pillock had broken his nose on the tain, what a great start to the year.
“Good” Draco stood up and brushed his robes off. He turned back to the woods, he placed his wand in his hand and said, “Point me”. His wand turned in his palm but did not stop. It did not show any signs of stopping.
He felt people brush passed him, so deep in thought he hadn’t realised the time. He picked his way slowly through the corridors until he arrived at History. He took his usual place with Pansy.
When he finally stumbled onto a clearing, he heaved a great sigh, before straightening his uniform and stepping into the light. He looked around the space, noting the herbs and mushrooms growing before inspecting the trees. It didn’t take him long to realise there wasn’t a yew tree. He took a deep breath; he didn’t cry because Malfoy’s don’t cry. But the sooner he got this sap, the sooner he could get back to the bint of a Professor, and the sooner he could work on… more important things. Not caring which way he went he took off in a faster direction to find another clearing.
“We are repeating the same day. We came to you yesterday and you suggested we’d either been cursed, or we were under a spell. You advised we visit the catalyst and so we went to the forest. We were unsuccessful in discovering the truth” Malfoy finished in a rush.
Malfoy greeted Blaise as they walked through the Common Room. If the boy was surprised, he didn’t say anything.
“Explain your absence” Draco remained silent. Draco leant against a desk and shrugged. Now the script would deviate.
Draco watched the conversation playout, he could either appeal to Potters better side or try to hex him faster than Potter’s defence. Draco knew he’d only be able to do it if Potter was caught unaware. And now Potter was on the defence it was likely even with the three of them they wouldn’t stand a chance. Additionally, Draco knew how this looked. Three Slytherins cornering the golden boy. He considered it. Maybe Potter would defend them but after the beating from Blaise this morning he doubted it. Whatever happens the day would be wasted.
“So” responded Draco. They stood silently staring at each other. Draco exhaled heavily and leant against a tree. He slid to the bottom and rested his head against the trunk. They were both looping, if Potter was to be believed. Not to say Draco believed him.
“And in the state, he’s in, Merlin knows what Dumbledore will think. You’ve kidnapped his golden boy!” she exclaimed.
Potter’s eyes snapped to him. Potter was like an open book, all his emotions played across his face. Dread and resign spread clear in his features.
Draco turned from the group and continued his walk. He pushed the feelings down as far as he could. It did no good to be jealous of Potter.
“I am sure what you said was most important” said Draco dismissively. With no consideration for his actions, he left. Where was Potter? He wandered the castle before his first lesson, he silently fumed. Potter was wasting another day. They’d discussed this, it felt like they had all the time in the world, but Draco didn’t know how long he would last, living the same day. The sooner they sorted this out the sooner Draco could get back to his normal life.
Malfoy paused; his eyes slid to the window behind Harry’s head. Harry watched the green light play across Malfoy’s pointed features.
“I see” she responded she raised her wand and began an incantation. The mist slowed down but began to speed towards them shooting over the ground and surrounding the trees. Soon they were covered.
“I don’t expect such irresponsible behaviour from you” began Severus. Or not? Thought Draco confused that Severus was saying the same things, he’d skipped a few sentences and instead jumped straight into his spiel.
“Yes, yes all day you’re a terrible friend, I’ve never seen Weasel so stressed” a smile crept up Draco’s face, his morning had been good. Suddenly Potter started hobbling.
“Potter you Git!” he called. He couldn’t help grumble about having to carry the wanker all this time only for the shit smear to rush ahead.
Harry had a piece of bacon halfway to his mouth when he stopped. He remembered the prophecy: ... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives… He felt his whole-body sink, like it had doubled in weight.
“How do you want me to wake you up” said Harry, his face heated and he felt it change. Slapping his face, he felt a snout
“About what” responded Draco. A gentle wind was blowing around the ground the sun illuminated Hogwarts from behind. Draco’s home away from home was magnificent in the afternoon.
They continued to walk, or in Potter case shuffle “Merlin Potter hurry up” said Draco, he was dragging Potter at this point
“you’re plenty slow already” laughed Potter. Draco threw him another hex which Potter deflected easily. He stood their looking at Draco. Draco turned back to the woods “are you coming?” he said. Potter didn’t respond, he faced Potter once more.
A pimple on your house you prick thought Draco. His name had now been said in conversation and as such it would be a slight against Pansy to not answer. He supressed a sigh and faced Nott.
He pulled himself together and straightened his robes. First, what was the problem. He was looping. For some reason he kept repeating the same day, how many days had he repeated? 2, 3 days? What was the last different day? It had been a Tuesday but how many Wednesday’s had passed since? He couldn’t tell. What had happened on the Tuesday? He’d … Merlin he didn’t know. All his days seemed so similar. He’d only picked up on this because of Nott’s and his bloody gripes. He barely paid attention in class now. But really hearing ‘They let you stay the night, Draco? That’s suprising” before transfiguration every morning was enough to force anyone to pay attention. Getting caught in Bole’s bed was still a sore spot. Draco had nearly lost it that morning when he’d heard Notts say it. While the rest of the Slytherins has laughed Draco had resisted the temptation to hex Notts into next week. But he’d finally put two and two together. I guess Notts does have a use.
Draco knew this would be a waste of time. He shifted from leaning on the desk and turned to leave. As he moved, he felt something grab him. He looked down to find Potter’s hand holding him in place, his eyes pleading with him.
Harry blinked at the board, 5th October, it read in Flitwick’s wispy handwriting. He looked down at his timetable. Wednesday, it read. The same schedule he’d had yesterday. He watched Flitwick explain the charm and theory. I’m crazy he thought wait, was it a dream?
“Hello?” he called. He stepped into the Common room. Green light glazed most of furniture and he could see creatures moving outside the window. It was empty, bar for one person sat close to a window. The student was holding a pendant in his hand, while his other trailed across a book in his lap.
“Back for another beating Potter” Draco said holding his wand to Potter’s face. As Potter rounded the corner he jerked to a halt. His eyes crossed to focus on Draco’s wand.
In the woods they wandered for a few hours unable to find a hint of what Harry and Malfoy had seen the other day. McGonagall asked them what they remembered. And although Malfoy tried to trace the path, he’d taken on the first day they had no luck.
Malfoy opened his mouth to answer but Harry heard the sounds of people coming down the corridor. His head flicked to the sound and he felt himself get pulled. Malfoy had his hand under Harry’s arm and was dragging him towards to door.
“You will only find out once you get back to normal time. This is of course assuming you don’t need a mind wizard” She looked at them both over her spectacles.
As he wandered through the forest, he came across a meadow that he recognised. He’d found Malfoy here crouching against a tree. He bent down to the tree. What had Malfoy been up to?
“I’m sure you know the position you’re already in” she said. Draco looked at her thoughtfully, how could he not.
“Won’t you just come back in uninvited?” asked Zabini his eyes followed Harry with an unnatural sharpness.
Once on the pitch, the cold air helped to clear his head of his dream and Harry felt his spirits lift. He mounted his broom and wabbly pushed of into air. He spent a few minutes gaining his confidence back and then zipped around the pitch. He took some calming breaths and thought about yesterday. He remembered what a git Malfoy was and decided to use it as fuel for his flying. He pushed his broom as hard as he could around the pitch until he was exhausted. Then he headed back to the dorms and promptly passed out on the sofa.
Potter removed his hand from his face, he found blood on his palm. He touched his nose trying to staunch the flow.
With this renewed fury Draco pushed himself over the barrier. He knew the way now, could probably walk it in his dreams. The forest shifted around him until he followed the same path, he had on the first day. That day he’d seen Potter in the meadow. Draco felt his back begin to prickle, he loosened his neck as he shouldered his way through the trees. One minute it was clear and then suddenly the mist was everywhere.
It took Draco three more clearings, a large doping of Spiders that were much to big for normal, and a side step from a group of creatures that he did not look too closely at before he found a yew tree. When he found the tree, he locked his insides to prevent the welling of emotion, straightened his back, and pulled out his wand. He made two incisions at the base of the tree and as he pulled out the flask from his robe, he heard the distinct sound of moaning. Nope He thought as he focused back on the task at hand Nope, nope, nope. He filled his flask and turned to find a creature moving towards him. He screamed as any man would scream and proceeded to hex the creature. The creature possessed a wand and shielded the hex. Draco realised that any creature with a wand has some semblance of intelligence, especially if it could cast.
“Come on Potter, I know I didn’t charm you deaf” Zabini’s face was politely curious even as his foot told a different story.
Draco considered it; Professor McGonagall wasn’t too bad, apart from being a Gryffindor she did seem adept.
Harry felt out of sort, but maybe it had all been a dream, maybe the stress of Newts. Or maybe Voldemort – Harry shut down that thought. He wasn’t sure what was going on, but it would be best if he let future Harry worry about it tomorrow.
Draco and Potter were sat in library looking over the last of the books Pince had recommended. Blaise and Pansy had left the two to it. Pansy had simply said he had no interest in books before dragging Blaise away. Draco had eyed her suspiciously.
“But the fact that you were pulled in to, Mr Malfoy it the anomaly” she said “if you are stuck then you have all the time to figure it out” she paused “as long as there aren’t any long term affects. Have either of you visited Madam Pomphrey? She may be able to see any lasting effects.”
“Hi Draco, it’s lovely to see you, what brings you to my table?” she asked. Harry watched Malfoy’s face morph into an interesting pained expression. He pressed his lips together to supress a laugh.
“Mr Malfoy a word” said Severus. Draco stepped into his office. Yesterday he had tried to placate Severus. But that had no effect.
“What’s that Potter, why the long face? Your ugly looks weighing you down?” Malfoy was practically preening
“Potter? How did you get in here?” Zabini asked nonchalantly, his mouth quirked at the corner. Although Zabini’s face was relaxed the air around him felt tight. He dropped the pendant in his robe and shifted the book under his arm. He rose gracefully from his chair.
Draco looked over his shoulder to find Pansy and Blaise had caught up to. Although they were having their own conversation, he saw their knowing looks and ignored them.
“Cutting it close don’t you think?” she said, Harry dutifully sat next to Neville. He could feel the cloying sense of intimacy between Ron and Hermione growing.
Harry shrugged “he’s probably up to something, right?” he looked up at the Ron. Ron’s noise was smunched up as he followed Malfoy’s movement. He looked back at Harry and raised his shoulders.
“Oh really?” he asked “that’s an interesting lie” Zabini lazily lifted his wand and proceeded to hex Harry.
“I’m sure Mr Malfoy is capable of walking by himself. Mr Malfoy?” McGonagall paused as if waiting for a response. When none came, she spoke again “If you’re not going to take your NEWTs seriously, I am going to have to ask you to leave”
“The forest would be my bet, there is something in there affecting you. Let us review it after lunch together”
“Oh?’ asked Harry, he placed his cutlery down and locked his hands under his face, he leaned into Malfoy. He grinned “Why’s that?”
Harry was pulled by his arm until he was bent across the table. Malfoy’s eyes were wild, and his face was morphed with fear.
Harry locked the air in his chest, he wasn’t really sure how to answer. He exhaled loudly and shrugged.
“Harry wuh?” Ron’s face was contorted in betrayal. He could see Hermione begin to get up from the table.
He shifted back around and bleary stared at his ceiling. In and out, he calmed his body. When he felt his panic settle, he slowly manoeuvred out of his bed. Weak from the adrenaline rush he headed to the bathroom. In the shower he let the water soak over his face. Keeping his head tilted down he filled his lungs with air. What was the time? The air rushed out of him. He smacked his hand on the tiles and pulled his fingers through his hair. Probably 3 right?  Harry pressed his lips together and huffed a laugh. Time to find Malfoy.
Draco waited for Blaise to mention Potter, but he didn’t. Draco assumed he hadn’t come this morning.
They sat silently; Draco contemplated their situation. Both of the looping, Potter more then him. Maybe he just can’t count. Draco huffed a laugh; he could feel Potter’s eyes on him.
After losing Potty Potter and making sure no one else was following Draco. He entered the room of requirements. He cleared a path through the forgotten items and stood next to the wardrobe. Yesterday he’s managed to get through most of the locks on the wardrobe. It appeared the wardrobe relocked itself every day. Malfoy grunted in displeasure and kicked a stack of books. A helmet fell and landed on his other foot. He shouted in frustration and huffed around to room. After wrestling with  his anger, he turned back to wardrobe. Taking some calming breaths, he settled into unlocking the wardrobe. Between lessons he worked on the wardrobe. He worked well into the night. When he thought he had finally made some progress he placed the helmet he had kicked into the wardrobe and sent a silent prayer to Merlin that this would work.
“There’s no rules against walking down the halls” Potter chocked out. Draco sneered down at Potter. Draco took great pleasure in being taller than Potter, standing this close to him it was clear how short the twerp was.
“Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy” she began “how unexpected.’ Her face was impassive, but her eyes glinted with suspicion.
“Enough” Draco pulled out his wand and leant down. Blaise’s smile widened and Draco did his best not to think why. He began healing Potter’s face, he made an effort to do it with little care and without meeting Potter’s eyes. Potter flinched as Draco healed his wounds.
They ended up in the Library any way, both of them sat ignoring each other as they carted through books. They’d both settled on the fact that maybe Madam Pince was a neutral person to ask. Unhappily she had recommended most of the books they had read yesterday but there was a few they hadn’t read. Malfoy’s face was permanently covered with a smile. It irked Harry to no end, he hated what Malfoy had done. But even more, he hated himself for not saying something sooner. After a few hours of reading and hiding behind their books when students came around Malfoy lowered his book.
“That’s what I’ve been saying” huffed Draco. As Potter rushed on, he was pulled out of Draco’s grip.
“Yes” responded Draco without giving her time to respond he continued “while in said forest we couldn’t find a way out. We were unable to escape, and I must have fallen asleep as I woke in my bed. We have been repeating this day”
“I don’t know why we are trying” said Malfoy, while they waited. “it’s definitely not going to work now with this” he vaguely gestured to his face”
“Yes” Potter responded in a way that Draco found irritating. Everything about Potter was frustrating. Draco worked to keep his feelings in check. It had been a sticking point for him since second year. Out of everyone in the world. Potter of all people had been given the gift of Parseltongue. As a young child Draco had tried and tried to speak to his pet snakes. Not once had he understood a thing. Potter the prat had turned up with his stupid face and lack of skill in choosing good friends and had wooed a snake. It irked Draco to know end. The unfathomable amount of gift Potter possessed.
“Zabini!” he called “Malfoy asked me to see him” he walked slowly eyeing the figure he knew was sat by the window.
With a swish of his robes Dumbledore pulled Potter away. Draco watched as they left expecting Potter to turn to look at him. He couldn’t fathom why he thought this, but Potter didn’t. He didn’t see Potter for the rest of the day. If Draco had known that would be the last time for a while, he would have… he would have what?
“Fucking, shut up! You filthy half-blood!” Shouted Draco he aimed a hex at Potter, but Potter shielded again. Potter was laughing hard now, leaning on his side until he fell further and started coughing. Between coughs he said “You’re lost” and then laughed harder.
“Malfoy!” he shouted, fear threading through his veins. Unable to see where his feet placed below, he fell.
“Malfoy!” Potter shouted. Draco snapped his eyes open. Fool, clumsily he turned his body in the air. He spotted his broom falling below him, he tried to summon it towards him. Slowly it inched towards his fingers brushing the handle. Missing he tried again.
On and on he went, Malfoy would rather wander around a forest with a half-blood then listen to this nonsense. He’d lost interest in the current conversation and was contemplating hexes to damage Notts bullocks when he realised conversation had turned back to his task. He heard Pansy’s attempt at his defence.
Harry felt moulded the floor, terrified that he had done something momentously stupid he called to Malfoy.
Draco didn’t want to believe he’d left him, that he’d managed to escape and not brought Draco with him. He leaped from the Hall and headed to the Forest, ignoring calls of his name.
“Malfoy, you git wake up” Harry said louder this time. Zabini was holding his sides laughing now. Harry didn’t know what he found so funny, but he could feel himself flush. Unable to take the teasing anymore. Harry hurried to Malfoy.
“Professor, please we need to go now” said Potter. His hand dug into Draco’s arm “We’ve repeated for too long now, I’ve suffered his company enough” Draco bristled at Potter’s words, but it seemed to soften McGonagall.
Focusing on the snake Harry spoke “Open.” Harry said. He jumped as the wall shifted in front of him. Disappearing the snake, Harry straightened his robes and steadied himself. He couldn’t really fathom that Parseltongue actually opened the door. Salazar’s security is pretty lax. Harry smiled to himself, this was going to be easier than he thought.
The task he’d been set by the Dark Lord, it didn’t really matter. And people hearing their conversations, does it matter? Blaise and Pansy had caught up.
As they existed the Dungeon Blaise peppered him with questions, his smile flashing brilliantly in the morning light. Draco ignored everything he said. Draco seethed with rage, Potter the fucking king prick hadn’t woken him up again. Two days in a row, he’d decided he was too good for this, too good to deign Draco with his presence.
“Professor Snape would know. His knowledge of the dark arts is extensive and he’s the and his skill has finally been acknowledged as the DA professor now”
Once Pansy arrived, they walked to the Great Hall. Pansy and Blaise discussed the recent lessons and soon started debating transfiguration techniques. Draco could barely remember the day of October 4th. It felt so long ago.
Zabini’s head shot up and his eyes widened for a moment, then they relaxed back into his lazy stare.
Pansy kept needling him on his disappearance. The rest of his crowd sat at the table talking quietly. To the untrained eye they looked like they weren’t listening to his conversation. Over at the Gryffindor table he could see Potter’s followers fawn over him. The Mudblood seemed particularly worried about Potter’s visage. She kept shooting glances over at the Slytherins table, probably fully aware of where Potter had been all afternoon. When Pansy’s question got to annoying Draco simply said he’d been working on his task. She raised an eyebrow at him, not believing a word he said. Potter and his discussion at breakfast had not gone unnoticed. Multiple people had spotted them flying as well. Not that if bothered him but he knew word would already have reached his Godfather. Yesterday he’d reproached Draco and reprimanded him for lack of attendance. Draco imagined the lack of memories would make no different to the speach he would get recieve.
As he rushed down the corridor, he heard footsteps following him. He was originally heading to cupboard but if he had a tail. He slowed to a more leisurely pace and the footsteps followed suit. Draco clenched his hands into fist, he couldn’t fail. He hurried around into the next corridor and turned to face his follower. There was only one prat stupid enough to act like this.
“Can’t use the library until our next loop” mumbled Malfoy. He turned to look out the window. Harry waited for him to say something else, but he didn’t.
“Prepare yourself Potter” Draco spat into the mist “You’ll wish you’d died under the Dark Lord when I’m done with you”
Harry paused, that explained how quiet it was. He pulled his textbook closer and began to read. Halfway through the first sentence Harry was noticed by Ron he was watching Hermione. Ron had been doing that a lot recently. Hermione looked up and Ron looked away. Ah, thought Harry it’s happening again. Harry felt like every time they played this game he ended up watching from the side-lines. He really wished Parvati hadn’t sat next to him the other day. She came over and frankly informed him how wonderful it was to see Hermione and Ron’s relationship change, how she couldn’t wait until they were official. Whatever that meant. So, he’d looked across to find them playing the staring game. And now he couldn’t not notice. He was happy for Hermione, really, he was, Ron has finally started to notice her in a different light. But Merlin was it almost as bad as when Lavender took an interest in Ron. Well, maybe not as bad. Nothing could compare for the pain that was Ickle Ronniekins. Harry suppressed a shudder. He thought about how odd it was watching your two best mates do something together that you couldn’t join in. He wasn’t jealous, he had Ginny. And Ginny was great.
He contemplated calling out but he doubted the door would open if they knew it was him. Harry cuffed his feet as he waited. He raised his hand to knock again but halted. His eyes shifted from side to side checking to make sure no-one was watching. He sighed heavily and brought out his wand. He conjured a snake, and gently held her in his palm. The snake wriggled through his fingers.
There was no way he could get back to sleep if the past week was to be believed. He shuffled back to his room and, as quietly as he good, assembled his quidditch kit. Bloody Ron had left his clothes on the floor, it was a pain finding anything in their combined mess. But once he thought he had mostly his clothes on, he grabbed his boom and left the room.
Potter shot from his chair, wand raised but Draco had already bolted from the library and was down the hall.
Malfoy sighed. “Well I guess you did find me. Pretty Gryffindor to enter our den. How did you find this place?” Malfoy yawned and stretched his arms.
“Get Out” she screamed her wand pointed at the boys. They hadn’t even done anything yet, how had she know? “Such insolence, fighting in the Library. No respect”. She was shaking with controlled rage, her face changing colour with every word. Harry scrambled to get away from her awash with a new kind of fear. She chased the boys out shouting about lifetime bans.
He leant against the sink and rubbed at the mirror to check his reflection; dark smudges framed his eyes. Casting a quick Tempus, Harry discovered it was 3 in the morning.
“What the fuck, do you think you’re doing Potter?” He pushed his wand harder into Potters face. Potter seemed shocked by Malfoy’s bluntness, but his eyes began to spark.
He followed Potter as he flipped through over and around the quidditch stands. Potter weaved between the beams, and Draco felt reminiscent of one of his first flights as seeker for the Slytherin team. Potter looped up and over to land behind Draco, he then rolled to the right and vanished. Draco huffed in annoyance and barrelled into the same direction. He crashed through the stand’a fabric and caught Potter heading to the school. Draco felt his blood thrum as he rushed to chase Potter. As the building loomed over head Draco was sure Potter was going to go through the front entrance. At the last minute he pulled his broom up and shot up the front of the building. A dangerous move that Draco followed precisely. As he flew up the front of the building, the windows rattled his mist. At the top of his ascent he felt himself drop in a free fall to find Potter, who was speeding through the courtyard. Draco bent his broom down closing the distance between the two. Again, Potter pulled up sharply and Draco followed him. Neck and neck, he chased Potter. His heart pounded in his chest and the wind deafened his ears.
Draco contemplated this over his meal. While the Slytherins ignored him, he considered that he’d loop this day alone and then tomorrow he could find where Potter was. If he was right Potter had already looped to tomorrow. Or, Draco sprang from his seat, he felt eyes jumping to him, Potter had already escaped.
Harry decided to follow Malfoy, he remembered the conversation on the train, Voldemort had given him a task.
“Potter, wait!” called Draco. The Mist was coming in quick, it was harder and harder to see, but still Potter was rushing forward. Until Potter wasn’t visible. Draco scrambled forwards pushing through the mist
“You have a whole castle to wander, leave me alone” Potter’s eyes flashed with annoyance he kicked Potter in the groin for good measure. He rather enjoyed freezing and beating Potter. As Potter’s eyes rolled, he leant into Potter ear and whispered, “I won’t be so lenient next time”.
Potter was curled on his side coughing. Malfoy imagined leaving him again, only this time he would be in the forest and would definitely die. Perfect. Draco filled up the final flask and corked it. He straightened himself and stretched his legs, a small glee filled him. He bent over Potter who was wheezing on the floor.
Harry rubbed his face, he looked up at Malfoy. Malfoy leant back and crossed his arms over his chest. His hair had now been sleeked back and fitted robes swished around him in a flourish. Something he’d probably learnt from Snape. Malfoy huffed in displeasure and dropped himself into the chair opposite Harry.
“You son of a whore” he shouted throwing another hex. Potter stumbled from the ground his face a mask of rage. But Draco’s anger was all consuming he fired hex after hex. The pain in Potter’s side seemed to slow him down. Until Draco had him pinned, Draco thanked whatever luck was on his side to be catching Potter unaware. Potter eyes flashed, but he couldn’t lift a finger not with Malfoy holding him still. He raised his wand and Potter’s body followed.
Potter huffed a laugh “I guess” he responded. He carted his hand through his hair and seemed to think deeply. Draco watched him pull himself up. He sat leaning on his hand’s watching Draco.
“You’re probably right” he yawned, “but did we have to do it so early” Harry yawned as well. After he’d showered, he found Ron mumbling about unpleasant things in his sleep. Not wanting to listen to a moment more, he’d shaken Ron awake. After convincing Ron with food, they’d sat playing Wizards chess in the Great Hall. He’d spotted Malfoy gloomily sat at the Slytherin table while the other Slytherin’s spoke animatedly. A sad Draco implied his plan was going wrong, but recently Draco was perpetually moody. Whenever they encountered each other Malfoy’s anger seemed to spark into life. Their back and forth was becoming more violent this year and Harry wondered if they’d begin physically fighting. Harry, sighed. Malfoy was a coward so unlikely, but a boy could hope.
“And I told you I don’t need your help” sneered Draco. Severus blank expression betrayed none of his thoughts.
“If you have been repeating the same days then I take it you have asked me this before” she questioned.
Potter was a selfish prick; he was certain he’d found a way. The worthless Halfblood had left him to go insane. He paused outside the forest. Maybe Potter wasn’t smart enough to find a way out. Draco head turned up at the thought, Potter was a pillock with no sense in his empty brain. He swayed on the edge of the trees. If he had escaped the pit that was listening to Notts senseless insults, if Potter had left him to suffer, Draco would crucio him into oblivion.
“You didn’t need to hex me” complained Harry. Silence echoed around the room and Harry closed his eyes. He could hear Malfoy shuffle in his bed, but he ignored the movement.
It went like this for a while, the back and forth between the two boys. Both of them proving they knew better than the other without revealing what they actually knew.
“What a woman, she’ll forget tomorrow” said Malfoy, his eyes snapped to Harry. “What’s wrong Potter?” He straightened. He looked down at Harry, his expression daring “The Mudblood not satisfying you enough?”
“Leave of Malfoy” Ron straightened his shoulders, as he stood to defend Harry. Since Ron has shot up the last summer, he was an impressive size, taller than even Malfoy. Normally Harry was all in for tackling Malfoys jibes but the incident on the train had changed him. Malfoy seemed so much more violent; his face had an angry sheen to it. And Harry had more important things to worry about. Like Voldemort his minds happily provided him. Harry felt his shoulders sag.
“I can’t walk very well” Draco could feel himself spluttering, he did not want to help Potter. Draco grabbed Potter, ignoring his painful hisses, he held him under his armpit and together they shuffled through the woods.
Harry tried to break free from his bonds, but he couldn’t wrangle his arms out. Wearily he regarded Zabini. He couldn’t believe he’d forgotten the fact that everyone forgot the looped days. How could he be so stupid, but then again, he was exhausted. He groaned once for his foolishness and second time for the foot that pressed into his stomach.
He eyed Blaise before he turned his attention to Potter. His face was heavily bruised, and he was hunched to one side. He’d been bound but it seemed extra effort had been put into a gag. There was something wonderful in the pain Potter was trying to hide. A thrill sizzled through Draco at Potters discomfort. For some reason he was missing one shoe and his sock. Draco spotted his shoe next to Blaise on the armrest. It was balanced like some kind of trophy
He purposefully ignored the forest. If Potter had gone there, then maybe he wouldn’t see him until the next loop. His suspicion was confirmed in the late afternoon
“Now were even” stammered Harry, riddled with guilt. Malfoy was a git, but this felt too far. Malfoy pulled his hand from his face. He looked down at his hand and then back at Harry, his mouth hung open. And then, his eyes sparked.
At lunch he heard the years whispering about it, Potter had disappeared. Over on the Gryffindor’s table, Potter’s followers bowed their heads together. Their faces churned with anxiety. He looked to the Professors table. Although, the headmasters face was unreadable, McGonagall looked worried.
He caught the Forest in his periphery and remembered a few days before. He slowed to a crawl and floated over the pitch. He contemplated the forest; he’d gotten so easily lost in it with no way out. Could he hide in there? He shook himself, hiding was never the answer. He needed to face Voldemort. But how did he face someone so powerful? He thought for a while, but he didn’t know what Voldemort was planning. But there was someone who might.
“Charms now” said Ron. He’d been very diligent about going to class this year. Of course, Hermione had nothing to do with it.
Yesterday he definitely had charms, because ‘Mione wouldn’t let him talk as Flitwick had gotten upset. And he had wanted to talk because he’d thought he’d missed the lesson. So, the day before yesterday he’d gotten lost in the forest. But no-one remembered him being missing so maybe it didn’t happen. Malfoy was with him in the forest, but Harry never contemplated asking Malfoy for the simple reason of Malfoy being a dick. But if the forest had been a dream then Harry had to admit he’d had a dream about Malfoy. Harry supressed a shudder.
“Oi, you’re mate hexed me re-“ Draco moved on. Potter called after him. He could hear Blaise and Pansy’s steady feet coming around the corridor.
Draco seemed to hover in weightlessness. He spotted the moment Potter realised what was happening. The wind rushed past his body and in a tangle of robes he reached his hand to the sky. He fisted his hand in the air, clinging to the hope that his moment would last. As he fell, he closed his eyes.
He felt like he was grieving, his chest heaved and his eye prickled. How had it gone so wrong, how was he going to face his parents? He froze and stared into nothingness. He could see it now the disappointment on their faces. He couldn’t imagine what the Dark Lord would do. No. He could. He’d seen it so many times. When his followers betrayed him, there was no coming back. The blood that seemed to soak into the Manors floor, or the screams the walls held. He was panicking. He rushed through the halls; how could he fix this? He stopped and leant against the wall. It was all Draco could do not to collapse against the wall. He smacked his hand above his head. The cold stone anchored him. He had a job to do, he began to walk through the halls, where could he go? His parent’s faces haunted him, and the Manor’s door seemed to loom over him. He could not go back.
“Uh-“began Potter. Draco pushed his wand into Potter’s cheek pushing Potters face to the right. He grabbed Potters wand drawing hand to prevent him from reaching into his pocket. He raised his wand and pushed Potter’s face until it was crushed into the brick wall. Potter groaned. Draco remembered his father’s words:
Draco dressed himself and headed to the common room. Students were sat all across the room, but Blaise was still in his morning spot.
Potters eyes widened he opened his mouth and then snapped it shut. Potter eye’s darted from tree to tree and he seemed to be thinking
His eyes slid back to Hermione and Ron, still playing their game. Would they be okay without me? Harry was shrugged out of his thoughts as the bell rang. McGonagall clapped her hands together
“I wasn’t just talking about his nose” laughed Malfoy. Zabini and Parkinson began to laugh as well. Harry remembered the discussion at hand and faced Malfoy. He thought about comeback, but nothing came to mind. Harry turned and walked towards the Dining hall, his stomach calling for food. What a fine way to end his day.
There was no way he could get back to sleep, if the past week was to be believed. He wanted to get his Quidditch kit on and go for a morning fly but the tree he’d smacked had knocked his confident, like literally out of his body. All the more reason to do it again as soon as possible, he supposed. He shuffled back to his room and, as quietly as he could, and he assembled his quidditch kit. Bloody Ron had left his clothes on the floor again, he sifted through the mess to find his kit and headed out.
As Draco waded through the forest, he kept his wand locked in his hand and ridgedly held in front of his face. His eyes darted around for any hint danger. Draco stopped every few minutes to look behind and above him. He’d then chuckle and then take the same stance as before. Draco wasn’t scared, because Malfoy’s weren’t scared of anything, it was unbecoming of a Malfoy.
“Out” Harry’s head swivelled around, with the speed Harry was unable to fathom Madam Pince appeared.
“Accio Broom” cried Draco, the broom which lay next to the tree flew to his hands “now you don’t” holding the broom, Draco took off into the forest.
He finally arrived at the correct meadow after slicing his way through branches and stumbling over roots. In his deshelled state he faced Potter with his wand raised. Only to the find the prat lying against a tree. The sunlight filtered through the leaves above him and he looked peaceful in his sleep. Not a care in the world Draco fumed.
Draco flashed into awareness. He pushed back the covers and hopped out of bed. Potter hadn’t woken him again. He didn’t bother with clothes, he simply pulled on his warmest rope and marched through the dorms.
After showering, Harry headed to the Dining Hall. Ron and Hermione where playing the staring game. They danced around each other so much so, that Harry had taken to sitting with Neville. In Charms, Harry remembered he had missed yesterday’s lesson. He leaned over to Hermione and whispered.
The room was similarly bathed in green light. Inside where three huge four-poster beds. Harry shook at the revelation that these beds where bigger than Gryffindor beds. In the light Harry could barely make out the owners. He could see a large figure in the left bed who was snoring loudly. In the middle he could see blonde hair and a pointy nose pointing to the ceiling, Malfoy probably. The last bed was empty, he felt Zabini brush behind him and headed to the empty bed. Zabini opened the trunk, he placed his items inside and then proceeded to sit on the bed. He crossed his legs and rested his head in his hand. He gestured to the middle bed with his other hand.
“You said we should visit the catalyst location which we believed was the forest, we entered it but to no success” said Malfoy while Harry finished his drawing.
She sighed heavily and disappeared into her room. Harry turned back to Malfoy in confusion, but once again Malfoy shrugged. She returned with some books.
“She knew exactly what buttons to push to get me here. How Slytherin, the old hag” Draco stopped on the edge of the forest. He took a deep breath and plunged into the forest. Professor Sprout had informed him that the type of sap they needed was found not by the trees on the outskirt of the forest. But that he would need to head into the forest and find a clearing with a yew tree.
Harry’s head jerked from his pillow. He took a deep breath and fought his body to relax. He lay in the darkness listening to the sounds of his roommates. With a few more harsh breaths he calmed himself. He knew he was in his room and he knew he was safe. Well, he huffed, as safe as Hogwarts has ever been. He thumped back onto his pillow, yesterday had been wild. He touched his face; it didn’t hurt anymore, and his side was fully healed. Madam Pomfrey had done a great job, probably, he couldn’t really remember. He untangled his sweaty legs from the sheets, and he leant on the edge of his bed.
“We can try” said Blaise, his face radiating a gentle smile. Pansy looked Draco for help. Draco knew Pansy disgust for pain and blood and as much as Draco enjoyed the idea of Potter suffering, he recognised it wasn’t worth Pansy’s mood.
“I spent a whole day in the Forest’s and not one of my friends remembers” mumbled Potter. He looked upset by this, his eyes flittered away from Draco unable to face him.
“No you’re not listening” said Harry “I left in the early morning I didn’t get back until late…” Harry trailed of, he didn’t remember getting back. Ron and Hermione looked at each other
Draco really didn’t want to appeal to Potters goody nature. And he couldn’t cast faster than Potter could shield. Unless, Draco paused. Unless he used a spell Potter couldn’t defend against. But what?
Draco finished the last book on his list while he waited for Potter to finish his he thought back to his original query. How could he hex Potter before he shields? The other times he had managed to do it he had taken Potter by surprise. Either Potter was sleeping or when Draco had been inches away. He needed a spell that wasn’t noticeable when casting. Maybe something embarrassing? Maybe something to do with transfiguring?
“What are you laughing at Malfoy” suddenly Potter’s beak seemed too close. Draco pushed his head away and got to his feet. Laughter still peeled out from Draco. Potter was saying something but every time he opened his mouth Draco laughed again.
“Good morning Pansy” he nodded his head gently. He waited for her response before crossing the threshold.
“I know you’re under a-“ Draco waved his hand and made to leave. There was no point in listening, he already knew where this conversation would head. Word for word in fact. Severus reached his arm out and barricaded Draco’s leave.
Harry looked over to the teacher’s tables where Snape was sat. So far Snape hadn’t done anything awful, but the term had only just begun.
On his back with his head gazing and the sky he laughed. His view was obscured by Potter shadow which loomed over him. Potter looked furious but his eyes seemed to spark with something else.
“Yeah” Potter watched Malfoy from the corner of his eye. He couldn’t get a read on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy’s eyebrows titled downwards, an indication he was upset, but Harry wasn’t sure.
“Does he tell you everything?” Harry responded. He smirked at idea of Malfoy confiding in anyone. Malfoy is a git who has no friends Harry knew this fact and doubted any of them had any knowledge on Malfoys predicament. Neither did Harry’s friends, but that was beside the point. Zabini paused, shrugged and turned around. He walked to the end of the common room. He stopped and turned back to Harry; a sly smile played across his face.
“woah” breathed Potter. Potter’s stealth skill was like that out Troll crashing through the forest. Really, Draco had no idea how Potter had managed to sneak around effectively these past seven years. Draco felt himself fill with rage, this was all Potter’s fault, it has to be.
“No, No” said Zabini “you’ll have to be louder, you are competing with Gregg” Zabini tilted his head to the snoring lump in the left bed.
At the table he sat and waited for Potter. The Slytherin conversation washed over him. He waited and he waited. When the Potter followers arrived, he expected Potter too. But he didn’t arrive.
Draco pondered yesterday’s events, and as he thought he came to a sudden realisation. Where is Potter?
Normally when Potter woke him the sun was still rising. But from the window it was now well into the morning. He grabbed his wand, it was 730. Potter hadn’t woken him up. Maybe he was still, whatever he was yesterday.
It was well known within the Dark Lords rank to not hurt Potter, to leave him to the Dark Lord. But roughing him up couldn’t harm anyone? Draco knew his position was precarious, that his family was shamed, and really, he shouldn’t be dragging anyone’s attention. But Potter always seemed to think he was up to something. There was no way to shake him. His mother faces floated before him. She’d hugged him before he’d boarded the train, her worried expression had haunted his whole journey. There was no way he could validate his behaviour. He sighed and removed his wand from Potters face.
“I… uh” Harry tried. He hadn’t thought this far ahead and thinking back, maybe he hadn’t really thought at all. It was an unspoken rule that Gryffindor’s and Slytherins never interacted in their own spaces. Even the tables where no go areas. Harry had never even stepped to the left side of the Dining hall. He’d barely even saw Gryffindor’s interact with the Ravenclaws table. Harry cleared his throat and he tightened his hand on his wand.
Harry head to dining room, he’d been looking forward to dinner all afternoon and planned to do no revision at all. “Blimey, apparition is going to be so amazing” Ron exclaimed enthusiastically he waved his hands as he spoke “I can’t wait to pop everywhere, you remember what Fred and George were like?”
Harry tried to think about his friend’s relationship in a positive light. He was happy for them both. Wasn’t he? They needed something in these messy times, something to help them through. Maybe they needed something more than him? Especially with Voldy being back. Something to distract them from the sadness rolling in… What if this was it? Maybe Voldy wins, maybe this was his final year. Harry didn’t think he could win this year, not again. He’d been lucky all the past years, in fact he was amazed he’d even beaten Quirrell in his first year. Harry didn’t think he would have made it, not without his mates.
“Well she’s not here” Draco heard himself say. He sounded like a petulant child calling for his mum to protect himself. He pushed past Severus and left his office without a further word. He’d have to listen to this all again tomorrow.
“Uh… really, Malfoy asked me to meet him” Harry tried to placate Zabini. “I’ll wait outside, could you just call him?” Harry mumbled. Zabini tilted his head and seemed to consider this.
Harry saw red. In a flash Harry had lunged across the table and grabbed Malfoy. Malfoy grunted in shock his eyes widened to the size of Bezour stones. Harry raised his fist prepared to smash it into Malfoys face.
“Please, you win, look at me” continued Potter “you got me fair and square please, let’s got to McGonagall”
There was no response. Harry edged forwards and after a couple of attempts Malfoys head appeared above his covers.
She sighed and then looked to the board. She was silent as she contemplated what they had said. Harry hoped they had been more successful then yesterday.
Draco felt some kind of power filling him, like Potter needed… defending? Protection? Draco pushed the feeling down.
Zabini hadn’t raised his wand and although his hand was relaxed at his side, Harry knew it would take a moment for him to do so. They both stared at each other while Harry muddled through an answer.
“Don’t you ever-“ Potter’s eyes were steely, he breathed heavily onto Draco’s face “call my mum a whore” Draco shook his head and wiped his eyes which were tearing up from the pain. Potter huffed out of his nose and stepped back.
“That’s right you run away coward!” called Malfoy. Harry could hear the shuffle of what was probably, Hermione holding Ron back. As Harry sat down to wait for food to appear, his friends arrived.
“Wait for me downstairs” Malfoy called. He grumbled some other things, but Harry couldn’t hear them.
“Professor, I don’t think Draco is well” No I’m not. “may I take him to see Madam Pomphrey?” Pansy asked.
“You know I’m right Draco, nothing good will come from upsetting him” she reached over to brush her hand against his. He looked down at in in frustration.
They lay slumped on opposite sides of the corridor. Harry felt like all the air had been knocked from his body. Malfoy had gotten him a few times in the ribs and his face was beginning to swell. Already one of his eyes was closing. Malfoy didn’t look any better, his head was tilted to staunch the blood from his nose. It had dribbled down his chin and stained his inner robe. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen Malfoy look so unpolished. Even when Harry had woken him this morning, Malfoy had looked put together. Now there was something feral about Malfoy, his face was smeared with both his own and Harry’s blood. Malfoys knuckles were cracked and raw.
The further he went the colder it got; frost formed on his broom. His fingers began to lock, and he found it difficult to keep his grip. Neither of them were wearing their quidditch gear, so Draco’s broom slipped easier in his hand. They both kept climbing. They circled each other as they rose, Potter was roaring with laughter his face alight with determination. But suddenly it was too cold, the air to shallow and Draco felt his broom slip from his fingers. His mouth opened in a perfect ‘O’. Potter shot past gleeful in his win.
“Professor McGonagall” Began Draco “We have been repeating the same day for quite some time now. Potter believed you might be able to help us.”
He walked to the board to recreate the diagrams she had drawn two days prior. Harry hoped he had gotten some of the drawings correct.
“I hear most old families have personal library” he looked up to watch Malfoy’s reaction “Especially you Slytherins, a lot of dark books” Harry wasn’t really sure why he knew this, but he did enjoy the watching the blood drain from Malfoys face. Harry didn’t really think Malfoy could get any paler but this was a day for miracles.
“Was this your plan?” he said his face inches from Potters. “Have me repeat the same day so I couldn’t fulfil my task”. Potters body stilled.
“Are you deaf as well as dumb” smirked Potter. Draco threw a hex and this time Potter shielded. Draco berated himself for letting Potter go.
Harry woke abruptly, by the end of his episode he was sprawled across his floor. Ron watched him blearily through his curtains, his bed hair stood on end. With a little reassurance from Harry, Ron rolled over and promptly started snoring again. After extracting himself from his sweaty sheets, Harry headed to the bathroom. He double checked his face in the mirror but found it perfectly healed, no sign of the fight with Malfoy remained. Harry squeezed his face, it almost seemed like it hadn’t happened in the first place. He eyes his reflection warily.
“I’m coming” dimly over the wind he heared Potter shout. As his hand pulled his broom towards him, he grounded himself in the smooth wood under his hand. Tucking his broom between his legs he shot off towards the ground.
Potter smirked over his shoulder. Up and up they went, winding round the towers until they shot past the tallest one. In the window, Draco spied faces pressed against the glass. Potter twirled through the air, falling again to the ground. Unamused by Potter’s shameful showing off, Draco sped past him.
“Morning Harry” said Luna as Malfoy pushed Harry down next to her. Harry looked up and watched Malfoy round the other side of the table to sit opposite him. The Hall wasn’t too busy at this time, but they still got some questioning stares.
Malfoy landed on top of Harry, his legs pinning Harry’s stomach to the floor. Harry raised his hands to his face, but Malfoy shoved them aside. Malfoy’s fist connected with Harry’s cheek. Harry’s body twisted with the impact. Malfoy raised his other fist and missed Harry’s head as Harry ducked out of its way. With his legs he shifted Malfoy off his chest and kicked him back. They both paused, hunched over on the floor, breathing heavily. Then they came together again. It was violent and messy, neither of them knew much about fist fighting more adept with their wands, which lay discarded down the corridors. Harry’s falling out at some point. There was a lot of frustration between the two, but slowly their fists stopped connecting.
Malfoy groaned. Harry heard a thump and when he looked back, Malfoy was lying in bed his arm flung over his face.
“Malfoy you-“ Harry thumped his hands on the table. He suddenly noticed the stares and shifted back in his seat. Lowering his voice, he said “I don’t think you understand the position you’re in”
“Yes, that’s what I said” Potter replied. He was wearing his quidditch kit and holding his broom. Malfoy deduced he had probably been playing quidditch. The Idiot. He had no idea why Potter was practising in the forest, but he did not care.
Malfoy has just tripped over another root when something caught Harry’s eye. He saw the white mist in the distance steadily moving towards them.
Harry threaded his fingers through his scalp and he hurried down the halls until he entered the dungeon. His eyes flitted from surface to surface as he tried to ignore his dream. He felt it following him like a shadow. He wouldn’t admit to himself that they were getting worse. He stood in front of the entrance to Malfoy’s common room. In a lone stretch of the hall Harry stared at the stone wall. Technically he shouldn’t know where this was, and he was pretty sure he was in the right place. But his memories of second year seemed to have faded quite a bit. He didn’t have a password this time. He stared at the unyielding stone, shrugged and knocked on the wall.
Malfoy stiffened. Gently, he placed his goblet down and withdrew his hands under the table. Harry assumed Malfoy had his wand aimed at him. Harry pushed his plate away and slapped his head onto the table. It made a loud thunk as his skull vibrated with the wood.
“I dreamt-“ started Potter. He stopped and flushed. Draco raised an eyebrow. Potter flushed harder and looked away.
“Whatever your thinking, don’t” He could feel the other eyes on him, but he ignored him they weren’t important.
“There are witnesses in the common room who can attest to you being in our room this morning. Just tell us how you got in and we won’t mention you were in there.” She said, her hand gesturing in a placating fashion.
Not needing to be asked twice Harry skittered out of the room. He leant against the door to gather his breath. Success.
Every time he entered a clearing Potter was sat waiting for him, with a growing smile. Finally, Draco decided not to enter a clearing, he walked for what felt like hours avoiding any sign of light until he was sure some creature would jump him. He stepped over a tree root unable to see his feet. When suddenly he was back in the clearing. Potter looked up and started to cackly.
He’d rushed through the corridors and hurriedly charmed a snake to help him open the Slytherin door. As he marched through the entrance to Malfoy’s Common room, Harry’s tired mind remind him of Zabini, who he spotted by the window. He raised a hand to say good morning but was instead greeted with a wand. He was halfway across the room when ropes shot out from Zabini’s wand and knocked Harry to the floor. Harry grunted as he landed on his face. Zabini placed a foot under Harry and rolled him over.
“Cheater!” Potter called to him. He changed his direction again and sped towards the forest. Not wanting to race Potter in the forest, Draco copied his move and pulled his broom up as hard as he could. Not trusting his skill in the forest, Draco climbed into the sky as hard as he could. Higher and higher he flew the clouds swallowing him full. He could see Potter gaining on him again.
Harry was on him in seconds, in the silent corridor the sound of Malfoy’s head cracking on the wall was like a lightening. Malfoy had tried to raise his wand, but Harry easily knocked it from his hands, it clattered across the floor. Pressed body to body, Harry held Malfoy against the wall. A deep hatred filled Harry, to think he had tried to work with Malfoy. He smacked Malfoy against the wall again. Malfoy felt pliant in his hands.
“Malfoy” Harry tried again. He really didn’t want to move from the door. Zabini began to chuckle lightly.
“Seems moronic to play quidditch in the forest, I know you’re a terrible Seeker but even you must know what’s a pitch and what’s a forest” Draco looked up at Potter to gauge his response only to find him slumping against the tree. Potter groaned, and removed his hand from his head, blood was dripping down his face. Potter looked at his blood covered hand and placed it back over his face. Idiot thought Draco, hopefully he’ll just die out here. He looked away from Potter to fill up a second flask of sap.
Lost in thought Draco found himself by the front entrance. He sat on a bench and let the sun warm his face. Why was he looping? Had someone cursed him. If he had there was no way of finding a solution. He contemplated finding his Godfather, but this seemed like it would only prove Severus unfounded belief that Draco needed help. He sighed. The only way out was if he could figure out what had set of the looping in the first place. He went back through his memories. His eyes flashed open. Potter, he’d followed him yesterday with the Weasel. It has to be him. Draco shot up ready to face Potter and his followers. But then that had been yesterday, he’d already been looping for some days. Draco sat back down and contemplated alternatives. But each solution seemed to be Potter. Things were mostly Potters fault. Settling on this fact Draco decided to get the answers from Potter.
Draco didn’t bother to grab his bag or possessions; he’d simply slid out of his chair and left the room. The eyes of the classroom carving his back.
“And just a reminder, Apparition lesion will begin next month…” the rest of her sentence was lost in the shuffle of bags.
His feet gently touched the floor and he hissed when the cold seeped in. It was the same dream he’d had this past month, with Voldy’s ever watching red eyes. He shivered in the dark, Voldy needs a better hobby, stalking Harry in his sleep felt pretty creepy. Harry paused, but it’s not actually Voldemort, Harry scar never hurt, so it’s a simple dream. What did that say about Harry that he dreamt about Voldy watching him? Harry shook himself, let’s not think about that. Smacking his bedside table, Harry grabbed his glasses and slipped out of bed. Wand tucked into his sleeve, he shivered over to the bathroom.
“You alright their mate?” asked Ron. Harry mumbled a response, he rubbed his eyes and blinked into the roaring fire.
“Look we can do this all day, but we have more important stuff to discuss” Harry let Malfoy change the subject. Harry was curious about Voldemort’s plan and wanted to know Malfoy’s purpose in them. Maybe repeating days with Malfoy might not be a problem. Suddenly Harry felt a little brighter.
Draco considered what he’d done. None of it mattered now though. Or at least not until they left this timeline. He’d wake up tomorrow and the whole thing would begin again. He didn’t feel the constant dread of messing up clinging to his shoulders. He used to worry constantly about his position. But now he felt a little less stiff, like he could breath properly. Even when they repeated the days, in the back of his mind he worried about the consequences of his actions. But with every loop he felt his body relax further. He’d become so caught up with escaping he’d almost forgotten the screams from his home. The darkness that haunted his dreams. Draco paused in his notes. Why was he trying to escape? Out there was his family, the pressure, him. In here, though, he could do what he wanted. But that didn’t change that the day was always the same.
They passed through a few clearings before Draco decided to burn the grass, as an identifier. He wanted to be sure that they weren’t heading through the same field. Eventually the trees began to change. Although Draco didn’t recognise any of the species, he was just happy to not be stuck in the cycle of lost Potters. Mist was creeping in around them, and Draco felt sure it must be night, he longingly thought of Dinner where he could be far away from Potter. Potter himself was beginning to get slower and slower.
“Quite” she said. There was a beat of silence where Draco did not know how to begin. But this was Potter’s head of house so he nudged the prat in the hope he might say something helpful.
“Yeah it called forbidden for a reason” backed up Ron. Harry knew Ron had only said this to get in Hermione’s good book. Ron smiled sheepishly.
“Zabini!” Harry called as he stepped through the Slytherin door “Malfoy asked me to see him” he walked by and waited for the same response.
Somehow the whole looping thing had gotten him to forget. Outside was a man who would hurt and murder all the people he loved. He would ruin the world Harry knew. Harry’s eyes fell to his lap. How had he forgot? He turned to the Gryffindor table where his friends sat and watched him warily. What if they were only free if Malfoy killed him? His eyes flicked to Malfoy. The sharp realisation of death clung to Harry. He couldn’t let Malfoy kill him; the Wizarding World would be left undefended. Voldemort would thrive, he was the only one who could stop Voldemort. No one else, not even Dumbledore. Harry’s eyes began to prickle.
Flitwick noticed their conversation. “You three, listen up!” he chirped. The conversation was put on hold for the rest of the lesson. Anytime Harry tried to speak, Hermione shushed him.
“What a juvenile attempt” replied Draco. After listening to Notts insults Potter seemed pretty worthless. Draco could fill his anger fade. Normally he saw Potter and wanted to beat him to death, but now he just felt tired. He lowered his wand. Potter instantly hexed him. Draco couldn’t deflect in time. The hex hit him on his cheek, and he squealed in pain. Potter rushed forward and pressed his wand into Draco’s chest
“I’m uh, we’re uhh” tried Harry. He looked to Malfoy with pleading eyes. Malfoy locked eyes with Harry. Harry squirmed in his seat and a gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s face.
“Malfoy you-“ he grabbed Malfoy’s shoulder. Malfoys eyes suddenly opened, and Harry felt the shock of a hex straight to his face. He could hear Zabini howling in the corner. Harry lay sprawled on the floor his face contorted in pain. He squinted up at Malfoy.
Harry woke with a jolt. Red eyes leered down at him and his breath caught in his throat. Where was he? What was happening? Malfoy? Yesterday came back to him and through the fog of his memory he calmed his breath. They had failed.
“Do you know the way back to the castle” asked Potter, Draco ignored him. He pulled out a third flask, filled and capped it. As he was pulling out a fourth a shadow blocked his hands, he looked up to find Potter leaning over him. Instinctually he pushed Potter away. The possibility of Potter blood on his robe disgusted Malfoy so much that he kicked Potter for good measure. The train flashed in his mind and he kicked Potter again. Git.
Not knowing where he might find Potter, Draco headed to the Forest. He remembered something about Potter in the forest. He came to a sudden stop outside of it. Draco wasn’t scared of the forest. Malfoys don’t fear. But he remembered the few accounts he’d had with the forest. In fact, the last time he’d been in here he’d gotten lost and… I kept looping back to the meadows.
“There are two options. The first is this: your minds are stuck in this time. Once you get back to normal time everything will continue as normal. This implies you are in a spell of some kind”
“Here we are” said Zabini he bowed smoothly but his face mocked Harry. Zabini pushed the door open and with the other hand shoved Harry into the room.
But she would only make things worse. No help would come from Blaise. With his mother on the neutral side, Blaise had no need to get involved with discussion about the Dark Lord. In fact, it was in his best interest to appear fascinated with the paper. That didn’t prevent Draco from hoping.
When Lunch rolled around Harry was fuming, he hadn’t been here all day and his friends hadn’t noticed. Wait, He thought, Malfoy mentioned them.
Potter’s face seemed to well with relief. With Potters eyes on him, Draco racked his brain with what was happening. Was Potter scared Draco would kill him? Is this what it was, an instinctual defence? But he hadn’t defended himself, at least not intentionally.
“You-“ fumed Ron, he made to lean over the table to grab Malfoy. Harry jumped to hold him back. Malfoy stepped back out of reach; a smile played across his face. He made for the entrance.
It was sometime before Draco gained some control of himself. Draco felt like he should have been incredibly embarrassed by his lack of restraint but anyone who saw would forget tomorrow. Draco smoothed down his uniform and straightened his cuffs. He could feel his face heating and he would have felt worse, but Potter still had a duck’s beak which proved Draco has at least won something.
Faster he moved towards the pitch weaving through the ground’s natural hills. As he passed the pitch, he felt something catch his robes. His body jerked back in surprise and together they tumbled to the ground.
“Professor, correct me if I’m wrong, but you mean we need to pander to the spells wish?” said Malfoy, he was leaning against a desk, with a look of quiet disgust on his face.
Harry startled out of his bed. Drenched in sweat he hurried to remove himself from his sheets. He grabbed his wand and cast a quick tempus. 3 in the morning. How many times this week had that been? He flopped back onto his bed and huffed. Harry wasn’t sure what to do, he still felt anxious from his nightmare, but he was tired of every morning having to exercise himself into exhaustion. He could follow Malfoy again, maybe the git would be up early too? He sighed and rolled over to watch Ron sleep. Ron slept like some kind of beast; his limbs clumsily thrown across his bed. Or maybe a dog, some big lanky-
“This isn’t helping” moaned Malfoy, he tilted his head to the ceiling exposing his throat to Harry. Harry absentmindedly watched Malfoy neck stretch.
He stood in front of the room of requirements. I must succeed, I must, for my father and my mother. He breathed deeply before he entered the room. He weaved through the rubbish and forgotten items until he found the wardrobe. He spent the rest of the day working on the damned thing. Draco knew that it was important to not to raise suspicion, it was the only thing his godfather ever mentioned. But he’d waisted all of his previous evening wandering with Potty Potter. He’d might as well make up for the work he’d missed. By the end of the day he had managed to decipher most locks around the wardrobes magic.
He could hear Potter calling after him. No he thought I can’t be stuck. He ran as hard as he could, back through the forest. He could almost map the journey in his head. His heart raced in his chest. He tried to keep his hope at bay so far he hadn’t looped back to the meadows. He pushed on faster. He could feel Potter stumbling behind him. And then suddenly they were both out of the forest, breathing heavily.
