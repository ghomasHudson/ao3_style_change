Severus glared at him before sighing in defeat. “I said, ‘Fudge-Mellow Cum Sticks’.”
“Well then, that must mean that Godric Gryffindor is a demon, since you sir are acting like an ass,” Tobias snapped. Slytherin’s jaw dropped and Rowena Ravenclaw laughed.
Severus blushed deeper, until his face was maroon and he mumbled something.
Narcissa squealed. “Show us the ring Draco. Come on, please?”
“You killed my basilisk?” Voldemort asked, not sure if he should be angry or impressed.
Narcissa squealed, causing her husband to wince. “My little Dragon is being courted properly by his betrothed! Did he say what the first gift was? When did he get it? Who was there? Where were they? How did …”
“Once you receive your folder,” Klause cut in sternly, “You will come to me. I have a list of your names, what job you want and what jobs you are qualified for with the results you obtained.”
It had now been two and a half months since it had been discovered that Tobias was expecting, One month one week since the NEWTs had been sat and three weeks since The Pack refused to have anything to do with Severus. Tobias looked up at the Head Table to see the now familiar site of a red-haired, pink-robed Severus with a quill in one hand and parchment in the other. It turned out that Tom had a larger vindictive streak when you messed with his son than when he was Voldemort and had spelled the man to only talk in quacks and cheeps.
Enjoy peeps :3 And I was told in one review to warn of needing tissues ... I don't know why ... but there it is :)
Hermione beamed. “Well, Ginny and I were arguing over something and bondage bracelets and bondage bands came up. Ginny said that they were vicious, harmful and extremely dark. I said that they were not and that they were necessary for everyone’s safety.”
Severus sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“What happened?” he yawned, his voice husky from his time with Luna and Ron in the Room of Requirement. Thankfully for him Seamus thought it was because he’d just woken up.
“Not exactly, Lady Zleva. I request that all students be gathered by year before getting a thorough health check from an experienced Healer. I talked it over with the head Healer from St Mungos and she agreed to send though a handful of competent Healers if we agreed.”
Hermione smiled softly at her head of house. “Not really, Professor. Ginny and I got into an argument about something, and I’m looking for evidence to show her I’m right about it.”
“We’re fine Alpha,” they chorused. “We are safe.”
We used to have group desks set up for tutoring purposes,” the stern woman answered in a surprisingly soft voice. “Teachers would assign the top students of each year to give up one weekend a month to help the strugglers of the classes. If a student couldn’t make the time – like for instance they were the top student in another subject – they could request a one-on-one meeting with either the teacher or the tutor so they could get the help they needed.  That was stopped when Dippit became Headmaster at the insistence of our current Headmaster.”
Encouraged by the moan, Tobias pulled Draco’s head up to his and kissed him softly. It didn’t take long for the soft kiss to be deepened and for Draco to pull more of his cock out before pushing back in.
“And you would know this how?” Tom had walked down from the podium when the strange man had approached his heir.
Blaise blinked in shock. “What …”
“It means that we have all the time in the world to explore each other until we know each other by touch,” he stopped and ran his fingers through the silken platinum hair and down his husband’s cheek. “Sight,” he gazed lovingly at the face before him. “Sound,” he breathed into Draco’s ear softly, eliciting a soft moan of desire from the blonde. “Smell,” he lent forward and took a deep lungful of Draco-scented air, releasing a soft whimper. “And lastly,” he quickly flicked his tongue out and ran it along the outer rim of Draco’s ear. “Taste.”
“Not as amazing as this will be,” Harry smiled as he started to undo the buckles on the device Draco was still wearing.
“He is,” a sleepy voice said from the door to Severus’ room. “He hides a lot of things from a lot of people and not all of those things are his to share.”
“I beg your pardon!” Filius exclaimed in shock.
There’s more than enough for all
Tobias sighed. “They – unlike you – are not pea-brained, snot-nosed bigots,” he sneered.
Severus looked at Harry shrewdly for a moment. “Alright, Mr Potter. I expect you to be in my lab in thirty minutes. You will have your practical this morning and your theory test after your meeting with our Lord. The practical will consist of a potion you will not be familiar with, so I shall allow you to use the book it is in, and give you a half hour to read what you can of the potion and its usage.”
Tom grinned and spun. “Isn’t it wonderful? Some muggle was throwing it away and I thought it was just too good a thing to not get!”
“I Minerva McGonagall, hereby renounce Albus Dumbledore as my superior in every way and pledge my loyalty to one Tobias Regulas Black – formally known as Harry James Potter. So mote it be!”
Draco nodded. “Our magic makes it so. Many witches and the occasional wizard, was forced into sleeping with someone they didn’t wish to sleep with before they were married due to rape. After this, the victim could not face their intended and so they didn’t have a good marriage. In the end, magic kind of … evolved, I guess you could say, to remove the trauma but not the anger.”
“You are a skilled negotiator,” he said eventually. “You not only got the best deal for you, but also for the Patil family. Do you require aid for the last negotiation?”
“So that was it. I thought as much. You never change pet. I remember the first time you spoke. All we could make out was ‘missing’, ‘toad’, ‘Gryffindor’ and ‘Albus Dumbledore’. Even back then it was obvious that you hero-worshipped the old fool and it is that reason and that reason alone that no one but your fellow Griffins could stomach you.”
“Are you ready son?” Lucius hid his amusement well, letting only a small amount of it show in his eyes. His son was dressed in his finest clothes – black robes edged with silver and green Dragons. Lucius smirked. “Dressing to impress, my son?”
Amelia jolted slightly when a hand was gently placed on her shoulder and looked into a pair of concerned blue eyes.
I climb inside your heart and still find
Bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar.
“He is a prankster,” Blaise said as he forced himself back to his food, "To do well, he has to be able to act well so he is not always discovered.”
“Bill, Charlie, Fred, George by the end of this weekend, you will be given an amulet that will gain you entrance to our new training grounds. All of you will, but before then, I will take you there tomorrow – Pateras as well.” Tobias smiled. “Now, onto more important business.” He turned to the twins and pulled out several brown paper bags. “Nonos and I came about some potions that reacted ... delightfully when sugar was added. The effects are not malicious, so we thought they would be good additions to your inventory. You can rename them whatever you like, but I’m going to need a guinea pig,” Tobias trailed off when Neville stood and bowed before him, face set determinedly.
~~~Linelinelineline. Linelinelineline. Linelineline.~~~
“When we agreed to hold this ceremony here, Tobias, we hadn’t even known of its location. That you and Draco found it was incredible. Moonflowers are one of the few plants to react to the people and magic around them. Both you and Draco are magically strong, and your bonding released all the bonds on your magic – bonds that form naturally when you learn control.”
Draco sighed in relief. “Thank Merlin,” he whispered, “For a moment there I thought you were going to say it was liquefied pickles and cabbage.”
“Just to clarify: You isolated a hormonal pregnant teen in your office for his own safety, even knowing that he is a member of a human wolf pack.” Remus stated. When Severus nodded, Remus smacked him sharply across the back of the head. “What were you thinking you Imbecile? You should be leaving it to Kyria to deal with, but she hasn’t been able to do so since she – and the rest of The Pack – has been fretting over the absence of their Alpha. What the Hell happened to the intelligent man I thought you were?”
“Thank you for revealing your plans to us,” Tobias said, grinning viciously. “Everyone in the establishment has known who you are from the very beginning.”
With another soft giggle, Luna put her knife back where she had pulled it from. “Right you are Brother dearest,” she stated happily before giving the slightly abused skin a soft, apologetic kiss. “Skoteinos and I are going hunting,” she said as she pulled back. “Would you like to come with us and watch?”
Following this came a scene that no one had ever thought they’d see, even if they lived for a thousand years. Tom Riddle – the darkest Dark Lord of the century – had told his son-in-law to call him either Tom, or Pateras but just leave out the bloody Lord, before sitting on the ground before the tree and handing everyone their presents.
“Hey,” he whispered back.
Tobias looked at the Hat and then at the walls of the hall. “You both just had to announce it to the wizarding world, didn’t you?” His only answer was a rippling laughter from both Hat and Hall.
“I’ve decided that I hate it here at the moment,” he announced as soon as he arrived in the siting room. “Not only can they get away with cursing members of MY Pack, the stress is working against Tobias. It’s only thanks to his de-stress tea and our frequent hormone-driven sex-a-thons that he hasn’t given in yet!”
Before he got there, he was joined by Luna.
“Thank you,” he murmured softly.
“Being an – as you put it – adequate brewer of potions, you will know that potions class is the most dangerous lesson in the entire school. The slightest slip in concentration at any stage in even the simplest of potions will cause a catastrophe. Therefore a teacher should be able to maintain control over the students in class. Professor Snape has the respect of the House of Snakes and most of the House of Ravens so he can be slightly less strict toward them as he knows that they will do as he says when he says. The rest of the students do not respect him, therefore, the only way he can control them is through fear. Rather fear a man for what he could do you then end up dead, buried and decomposing.”
Once he was on his husband, Draco released his lips, panting softly. Waiting for his breathing to return to normal, he inspected the beautiful creature beneath him. Black hair that was mused with sleep framed a face pale due to a lack of sunlight. This made his now green-silver eyes glow in contrast to his dark kiss swollen lips. Draco felt his breath catch in his throat at the beautiful sight his husband made.
“I'd appreciate that,” Mr Stephens said with a smirk. “Off you go to Stoker.”
Amelia nodded her thanks to the man and turned back to the students. “When I call your name, go and line up before the tent with the number that I call first. Tent one …”
Draco and Severus blinked in surprise, staring at the dark-haired youth.
“I think there are lower odds on Hagrid being the offspring of a goblin or a dwarf then there is of this meeting being called for happy news,” Charlie said with a grim smile.
“Why do you automatically believe I was the one responsible?” the blonde man groused, going red with embarrassment.
Would you like to share it?
“My name is Tobias Regulas Riddle – otherwise known as Gios ek Skotadi – Son of Darkness.” Shouts echoed around the hall and a throwing knife had stopped before it could enter Tobias’ chest.
Tobias raised an eyebrow. “And what would that be, dikos mou Drakontas?”
“After going through the contract it has been determined that it can be made into a courting contract with the stipulation that if both parties can get along with fifty percent compatibility or more than they must marry. IF they don’t have a least that much, then every child of their line is tested for compatibility until the contract is fulfilled.”
Tom stood, placing himself between the man and his son. “Me,” he said in complete boredom. “The next time you decide to kill someone to steal their identity, my advice would be to do it yourself rather than sending idiots.”
The men looked to see the magic rise from Harry in waves before he started to shake.
Build it up with Iron and steel,
“Maybe I should have named you ‘Apateones’ instead of ‘Arpakitiko’ Blaise,” Tobias chuckled, eyes sparkling with mirth. “It seems that you are The Rogue of Death’s Wolf Pack.” He turned serious. “But whether you bond to The Pack or not, you will always be Blaise of The Pack. Nothing and no one will ever change that.”
Tobias breathed deeply before the doors to the Great Hall opened. When he walked in, the Hall went silent.
"It was five months, three days, twenty hours and fifteen seconds after I was initiated that the Dark Lord’s attitude changed. It was instantaneous – no warning what so ever. It was terrifying to see the change in him. Where we could once call him by name and be teased about non-existent eye-batting men and women after our bodies, we would be hit with the cruciatus cures and had to prostate ourselves before him as though we weren’t fit to lick the dragon manure off the bottom of his shoes.”
“No, I’m sure that is just what we need now,” Draco smiled, squeezing his husband’s hand. “After all, we haven’t made sure that the time in suspended time affected the growth of our little one.”
“My Lord?” he asked, laughing internally as the older man froze, ‘what are you doing?”
“… Touch me you foul, blubbering piece of rat shit! You cowardly piece of whale lard! Get these off me and then face me, instead of chaining me like a …”
Draco took a deep breath. “Because Tobias has plans for us tonight – Dinner by the lake, and he revealed how he feels about me.”
It had been five days since Tobias and his pack had explored the Chamber, and in that time Severus had been summoned to his Lord’s side three times to explain what had occurred in there. He shuddered slightly, remembering the way his Lord’s eyes had glowed red when he viewed the memories containing Tobias’ explanations.
Neville turned to gently place his hand on the blonde’s shoulder, only to yelp in shock as said blonde disappeared in a ball of flame. One moment later a still smouldering section of parchment floated down towards them.
Severus put down his quill as the cymbal signifying the end of the second lesson of the day chimed. He had a double lesson now with the NEWT seventh years. That class was almost as volatile as the sixth year Slytherin/Gryffindor class. At least Tobias could keep the Slytherins under control this year. Before he left, he glanced around his room, almost smiling at the now dust and clutter-free workbench. It seemed both his godsons had an instinctual organization habit.
Tobias explains to Severus, Tom and Lucius as to why he isn't sleeping
The next of The Pack to bond was, to no surprise, George when he and Padma fulfilled their duties the week after Padma had graduated. T the happiness of the couple and the relief of both families, the two of them had grown to deeply respect each other over their two year engagement and it hadn’t taken long for the two of them to find that they were content with each other as a marital partner and while they never grew to love each other as deeply nor as strongly as the first three bonded couples did, they did share a special kind of love all their own while adding a set of triplets to The Pack’s growing number of members.
“Only a few,” Luna hummed, swaying to a song only she could hear. “It needs to be dark enough to hide things of nightmares, but light enough to see more than movement and I need a little bit of height. You can decide on everything else.”
Tobias smirked. “I made her watch Bambi.”
“If you ever – EVER – threaten or harm anyone – ANYONE – from my pack, I will remove both your testicles and make you eat them as is. IF you do it again, I will remove your poor excuse of a dick and shove I so far up your rear end that you will need to be cut open for it to be removed.”
“Goodbye, Mister and Misses Malfoy, thank you” Harry said as Draco walked back to him, he even bowed down a little and the blond was curious why he did it.
“Oh” Pansy mumbled “Yeah, totally, I was just kidding at first”
Draco spun around when he heard Harry’s voice from behind him
” Draco said “And?”
“Alright Aurors! You can leave now” Theo looked at the other Aurors leaving after Pansy let them go, he was bored, even when Roger was pressing him against the table, his hands on Theo’s waist, he didn’t feel a thing. It wasn’t like he didn’t
“Are you sure?”
Ron cheered, and the rest of them clinked their glasses together, laughing loudly. Pansy had announced the news today, barging in his house while screaming, and he suspected he had done the same with the Aurors, because Harry, Neville and Ron were still in their Aurors’ uniforms and didn’t get the chance to change.
her back red and her front tanned because she forgot to apply it in the back, she then suffered a sunburn so painful that she claimed it was even worse than getting a Crucio. Draco squeezed some more cream out and started applying it on his arms and chest, his movements were smooth and careful, he slipped his hands under his waistband a bit and trailed up his neck. Draco stopped and looked at Potter
“You were with Granger again?” Theodore asked, putting the face mask slowly on his skin
Romilda Vane got back on her feet and grabbed the piece of parchment, opening it wild and raised her voice “
“You’re mean” Potter laughed
Draco grunted when Potter was already standing in front of him as soon as he stood up
Draco squealed quietly “I can’t, I just can’t, Pansy. I
“Over? I was never under Potter to begin with”
Pansy pulled Draco back when he was exiting the classroom, not letting him go
” Pansy jolted and pulled her Muggle phone out of her pocket, it was the one her wife had given her “
” Pansy became a mess that couldn’t stop crying “
Draco smirked, smearing his thumb over the head of Harry’s cock while his other hand tilted his chin up “
“No, no, er…, well…”
“Hi, Mister and Misses Malfoy” Harry said politely, scratching the nape of his neck as he took the spot next to Draco.
“Your father might be angry now, but he will get over it soon, I will talk to him” His mother assured, and Draco couldn’t help but walking to her and bending down to hug her from her seat.
“Draco…”
, and I want her
“How did you pass the Auror training program?” Pansy turned around and smirked at him, the little cow “I thought you had to exercise like this a lot. Right, Harry?”
” Draco grunted quietly and looked back at the Head Auror, even Ron would have been a better option. He was always partnered with Neville Longbottom before and Ron would be paired with Potter, but then Neville bailed on him and became a Professor in Hogwarts and got engaged to Theo, he wouldn’t admit it, but Neville was a good partner, even Ron was tolerable, but Potter, Potter was a whole another level, he’s messy, and never listen to Draco, always act first before thinking, he still hated Potter, after what happened seven years ago. And even though Potter started to be nice to him since a few months ago, he still remained suspicious, Potter kept making small talk while they’re in the break room, or catch up with him in the halls, or holding the lift for Draco, or he was always last to leave the Ministry, like Draco. What was his motive anyway?
“No, it’s alright” He thanked Potter, pushing his hair behind his ear and looked up at the Auror. Another thing he hated about Potter was that he grew five inches more or so over the years and now he was taller than Draco “Thanks for holding me back, I don’t know what I’d have done to that guy”
” Pansy waved at him repeatedly until he noticed her “Take a break! You too, Theo. Wait until Ron’s done!” Draco nodded and leaned back on the table. He avoided Smith’s eyes and looked at Ron, who was posing awkwardly with the small dragon on his shoulder, and Blaise suggesting him to relax. Draco diverted his eyes and looked at the corner of the room, Harry was standing there, talking to Neville, Dean and Seamus, laughing casually, Draco glared at the git. Of course he was still pissed about Harry for not remembering anything from that night, he hated himself for being the only one to remember, he hated everything, because Harry was the one to initiate the kiss and he didn’t remember, it was infuriating. And he didn’t notice it but when he looked back at the git again, Harry was actually looking at him. They stared at each other for a second before Draco tear his eyes away first, watching Ron again.
“Thank you” Draco chuckled and rested his hand on Harry’s chest, leaning on his shoulder and watched everyone enjoying the party
“Of course. Draco, you interested?” Pansy turned around and asked him “You could stay back, I mean, it’s for couples”
have said that, sorry, I’m still in training” The girl said “You should follow me”
“I’m not sure, I always throw insults at him, he’d always fight back” He said, they had a rough past, a
“What?”
“What if I say no?”
“That’s absurd, Pansy”
“See you at the party” Potter said, following Granger to where Weasley was standing, leaving Pansy back, glaring at him
allowed to dance with people now?”
“I did carry you on my back the whole way” Potter eyed him and Draco chuckled
“Oh Hermione wants to go to the music lounge in this resort” Pansy flashed a smile “There’s a bar”
“Well, I’m still him, but I’m from another universe” He said and Harry’s eyebrows furrowed together “Okay, I know it sounds crazy. But in my world, we hate each other. We despise each other, we’re arch rivals. And, well, one day, I saw a mirror in this same room, and I saw us kissing, I freaked out and tried to destroy it, and the next thing I knew, I was here, in your world” He started explaining as Harry widened his eyes “It’s crazy, I know, but I’m telling you the truth. That mirror is cursed, and remember that thing Luna told us? About how there are multiple universes living like us right now? I think it’s true. Merlin, I know it’s hard to believe” He said, retreating his hand and clutching on his robes instead “You may think I’m going insane right now”
“Sorry” Harry mumbled while Draco was still trying to calm his breath, Harry’s hands were still under Draco’s robes, holding him possessively “I, er…”
“Oh…” Boot stuttered “No, no, no. I wasn’t disagreeing with you. Sorry, please continue”
“Okay, I think—I
“If he’s sick, we should see how he is”
Draco could read from his father’s lips now and he watched him folded his hands over his chest, huffing out angrily.
, I’m
“Were you…having a bonfire?”
“Woah, you didn’t say that we have to do that from the beginning” Ron put his hand up and leaned back “I’m not gonna sit on people’s lap”
“Alright, let’s get—…” Pansy stopped when the door was slammed open, Penelope Clearwater stuck her head in and looked at them with wide eyes
“Yes, we are, and…and you don’t want to jeopardise our friendship, right?”
“No, it’s fine” Draco said and looked back at the man “Look, I am not interested in you”
?” Pansy waved her hand in front of Harry “Hello? Earth to hopelessly in love boy!
“That sounds interesting” Neville said and everyone started nodding, it also sounded intriguing to Draco. This was like a game of understanding, the fun part would probably be finding out their partner.
“They’re so different, Pansy, it’s not the same”
“So, as I was saying, we, Hermione and I” Pansy hooked her arm around Hermione’s and smiled “Are making an Auror calendar!”
“Maybe if she doesn’t have to take care of everything, she might” He said and Pansy have him a weird look “What I mean is, if
night was normal until Harry found a ring under the table, he bent down on one knee to take it, and as soon as he looked up, the restaurant was clapping at them, thinking Harry had just proposed, Draco was equally shocked that moment. Harry didn’t know what to do then, but somehow Draco said yes and took the ring anyway, probably to avoid the scene they’d make if Draco had said no. After that, they received their first
Harry widened his eyes, he walked quickly to his bedroom and opened his closet.
I mean, he
“But—…”
“Hey, guys! All love dovey again?” Finnigan chimed in when they headed to the table “You two were acting so weird, we thought you guys were fighting or something”
“Good idea” Potter looked at the married couple on the table in front of them and suddenly smiled “Do you remember when they first admit they are in a relationship?”
“So I won” Draco spoke once he pulled away, he crawled back up to face Harry and licked his lower lip in a seductive way “What do I get?”
Harry was here too, with Ron, still in their Aurors uniforms. Coincidence much?
“You will”
“Really? I could just borrow your phone to call my friend and pick me up” Draco said “Two of them are on a date, but I could call a few others”
“Thank you for the ride home” Draco said, walking into his house with Harry. They talked on the way home, he learned a lot about him. They were the same age, Harry and his friend, Ron were Hermione’s friends, which was surprising, but it explained how Hermione always say she has friends in the law enforcement, he just never mentioned their names, or Draco never really listened. Draco bent down and grabbed the keys from underneath the plant and opened the door
“Pansy
“Shut up, Pansy” He glared at her
“I…I know, but, it’s still nice to be asked” He huffed annoyingly, he felt kinda betrayed when all his friends didn’t invite him “Well, Potter asked me today”
“And I wouldn’t mind some time to be close with these hot Aurors” Theo chuckled
“Yeah, I know, you have a sweet tooth” Harry said while trying to swallow the rest of the chocolate in his mouth quickly, he knew Draco didn’t like it when it he talked while chewing.
“I will never” Blaise said, murmuring in his ear “I never break a promise” He squeezed Ron tighter and kisses the spot under Ron’s ear, sending goose bumps everywhere
“Always so good with words, Harry”
“Can we study for only one hour tonight? It’s Monday, I’ve got a chess match going on later, Harry finally agreed to play” Ron said to Blaise even before he could sit down. Draco smiled at him but the redhead only gave him a glare. It was alright, he could be patient with Gryffindor.
at Blaise, he scoffed softly and headed for the door
be a great help. This secret cannot be kept for long, Draco, you better find a way” She said, quickly finding her spot to sit down next to Granger.
“I don’t hope you’ll forgive me”
“Just relax, you’ll be alright” Ron nodded at Blaise’s advice. It had all started a year ago, when Ron was kicked out of his house,
“It’s time” Draco looked at the antique clock he placed in his study and gestured Potter to go to his spot, he looked down at the silver goblet on the table and sighed, Pansy liked to make everything fancy “Why are you so bloody tall?” Draco rolled his eyes and touched the goblet the same as Potter, they arrived in front of a big resort in barely a second
” Draco glared at his friends and marched in the lift with them “
made everyone helped” Ron said, nodding along with everyone “She Floo me at midnight asking me to do this, she really put her mind into this”
“Really?” Harry smiled softly, showing one dimple on his left cheek, which Draco found adorable “They mention you a lot, especially Pansy. Er, and I’m also friend with Ron, I think you know him”
” She waved her hands, fanning her tears and urging Ron and Hermione to give them the rings, as Harry slid the band on Draco’s finger, his heart was still beating fast “Do you—…” Pansy’s voice broke “
this detective was muscular,
” The girls chanted through the screen as Draco threw the shirts into the firing bucket. Draco must admit, he felt kinda better after throwing a few things into it, the love notes he used to write about his ex and stuck it around the house so the jerk could see, the framed picture of them in Disneyland, some of his ex’s boxers that he left here.
“I feel like I’m about to be murdered” Harry said, breaking the silence when his friends all laughed “What is this all about?”
…” Harry turned around at the same time Draco spoke and they both stared at each other before chuckling
Narcissa’s stare shifted to him. Harry willed himself to remember that this was only tea. She was only an imposing woman. He’d met imposing women before.
Lupin swore but Harry didn’t know why he was so angry. Harry felt warm here and he knew that if he reached deep inside him, reached for that thing that connected him to Draco…
“No displays of affection,” he said pulling out a silver flask from the left flap of his deep brown coat.
She set the snack before him.
He hadn't been thinking at all and that was the problem. He would need to keep himself on a very tight leash from now on. No more hand-holding, no more being followed to the Room of Requirement and most of all, no more dreams.
“He needs the Hospital Wing,” she said and Harry didn’t miss the way her gaze shifted to Draco.
He was too aware of Draco watching him and his own nervousness only made it worse.
Ah, that. He’d meant to do it before Easter break but he supposed now was as good a time as any.
Malfoy’s warm breath swirled around his face nothing like the wolf's strong breath. It smelled like ordinary morning breath. A fact of which Malfoy did not seem the least bit self-conscious. He was looking at Harry with a mixture of anticipation and something else Harry did not want to think about.
“They've never had to look so hard for excitement.”
He cleared their throat and rolled his eyes inconspicuously. Harry knew he couldn’t care less about writers or writers that weren’t killed by Voldemort. But Harry knew this would mean more to Hermione.
"Who do you think he's going to ask to Hogsmeade?" asked Parvati beaming.
The rest of the week passed faster than Draco had hoped. The rumours died down eventually, in part because his presence provided no fuel for them. Aside from the incident in Snape's classroom, he had been what one could almost label a model student. He remained silent during his classes, avoided Pansy and Zabini as much as he could during the day and locked himself in the boy's washroom at night. His consumption of Firewhiskey exceeded the amount he'd promised himself he would. And though his variation of the
"Get up, Draco. It's eight." Oh, it was just Blaise. Draco reached for the other side of the bed in search of him but all he got was rumpled sheets. His eyes cracked open. "You better leave before the party starts."
He motioned to Blaise who was still at the bank ankle-deep in water. "Are you going to stand there all day?"
Ron's fingers began to shake as he lifted his pumpkin juice and he shook his head. "Everyone else will have had loads more practice, I don't think-"
Draco Malfoy had been thinking along the same lines and chosen to reveal himself.
He didn’t look up as he said it. He didn’t stop packing his clothes either. They would find out soon enough why Potter (
Quidditch practice had continued as normal despite his soured relationship with Ron who was the only one of the team members whose anger or surprise refused to be cured by hard practice. So Harry had treated him like he did every other team member. There had been no jesting, no strategy breaks and no light comments about Demelza’s backward swerves which were enough to know anyone to the ground in a heartbeat.
{HPDM}
He took a quick look at the table and spotted Mr Weasley, Charlie, Bill and Lupin seated next to each other. He could tell he’d interrupted a conversation. From the opposite end, Ron eyed him curiously while Fred and George motioned for him to join them.
Harry crossed his arms. “Such as?”
Their weekly meetings had grown unnecessary since their mating and only the shift necessitated a schedule.
{HPDM}
"How have your studies been going, Harry?" the headmaster asked leaning forward on the desk bright blue eyes watching him astutely from behind his half-moon glasses.
“I know,” Draco said. “But since you seem lucid enough now, there was something I wanted to tell you.”
Draco collected his tie of the ground while Potter retrieved his invisibility cloak from the edge of the pool. The edges were dark where the water had seeped into the material. Potter watched them with narrowed eyes until Draco heaved a long-suffering sigh.
Harry frowned.
"I don't know how I'll be after," he said. "And I'm new to this. Things might not exactly go according to plan."
“Hurt? No.”
Malfoy had been serious when he’d said no to Harry watching him shift again. He had received a stern letter on Sunday morning detailing the lengths Malfoy would go to, if he caught even a whiff of his scent in the Forbidden Forest, to teach him why heeding advice was important.
“I got a plan” Hermione gave her a smile and a kiss to her forehead before getting off the bed with Pansy quickly following her. She absolutely loved it when her wife was in on mischievous stuff like this with her, it only made her love Hermione even more, if it was possible for Pansy to do that “
you’re fully prepared to defend yourself”
The students were dancing, talking loudly, the smell of alcohol, Draco suddenly realised it was too much for him to take, he needed a quiet place to think, and he might just know where to go. He headed for the door and left the party, but just as he thought he was getting some peace, there it was, Harry and Ginny, standing face to face in the dark hall. Draco’s feet couldn’t keep walking, he watched Harry’s back and Ginny’s smile. The blond felt like his heart was a piece of parchment that got thrown into the fireplace. When Ginny leaned over pulled Harry in a tight hug, Draco felt his lungs running out of air to breath. He turned on his heels and ran away, if he could, he wanted to run out of this place.
at confessing to Potter, he took a shower and was drying his wet hair until Pansy called, he felt like a coward.
“Oh, sure, what do you want to ask?” He drank his wine and waited Draco to wipe his mouth after finishing his plate
He announced and everyone finally stopped chatting too look at him “Harry! Come here please”
“I said what I said, I like you, from the moment Hermione invited you to my house so you could help me with…everything” Harry said. And it was true, a year after their graduation, Pansy had nagged him with Hermione so he’d help Harry be ready for social events, like some kind of assistant, since Harry was the saviour and all. Unfortunately the git had no taste in fashion and anything. Draco had been there for Harry before every event he had to attend, and it had gone like that for three years, that was when Draco decided he could not work with someone he likes because it’d interfere with his business, he gave up. But they still remained friends until now, Draco was never able to get over Harry, no matter how hard it was.
“There is no time, we had contacted the Greengrass family and we will set a date soon, after the talk with Draco”
He said, covering the mirror but as Harry approached him, the Gryffindor pulled him away from it. When Draco looked at it again, it was still the two of them but they’ve stopped holding hands. At first, it looked like it was just their reflection, maybe Harry wouldn’t notice it, but the two of them in the mirror looked slightly different. Harry’s hair was less messy in the mirror maybe due to Draco’s impact there, and they both have small silver bands around their ring fingers, exactly like the promise ring the other Harry gave him back then.
“Well, we should all change clothes” Hermione looked at them up and down and cleared her throat “Then we will meet in front of our room and then go to the Opera Theatre”
“Well, I never told you” Draco winked at him and they both looked at the kitchen door when Rose opened and walked to their table with two dishes on her hands, followed by Blaise who was placing other plates on their friends’ table wandlessly with his hands
“If you don’t want me to shag him, then you should have remembered what happened three months ago” He heard Draco snapped at Harry and then the door was slam closed
“Do you think it’s true?” He asked worriedly, if it was true, then maybe he was wrong about his plan
in love with him, but here we are, you avoiding him by staying in the kitchen, when you could just get out there and show off to Brandon” Ron explained “You save the Wizarding World, you have tons of things to show off. What does Brandon has?”
And to make matters worse, we have to
“Hey, Pansy! Why don’t you join some of the girls at the Hufflepuff Common Room? They’re having a secret party, just girls” Seamus asked but Pansy shook her head slowly
“Oh” Draco mumbled softly when he felt something under the heel of his foot.
friends.
“We had a rough night” He rubbed his eye and looked at Pansy, who was standing with her hands on her hips “Why are you here?”
“Y-yeah”
“Welcome back from your honeymoon” Luna smiled at them and threw more confetti up in the air
“Draco, are you ready for breakfast?” His mother asked while his father was still looking down at his plate. Draco unclenched his jaw and swallowed hard.
take care of everything, then she might be okay about having alcohol. It’s like proving to her you can be responsible”
“Oh no, you’re not doing what I think you’re d—…”
“Oh no, don’t worry” Hermione shook her head and placed her champagne down on the bedside table, she then Accio her robes and put it on gracefully without flashing anything inappropriate for Draco to see “We’re done”
“Stand in front of it and tell me what you see” He whispered from behind Draco, the blond stepped up and saw a shadow in the mirror. There was a second shadow now, quickly enough there was Harry there, and Draco was there too, but he was crying as Harry threw a piece of parchment on the ground, stomping on it and leaving Draco crying on his knees. It was heartbreaking, and from what he saw, it seemed like he confessed to Harry, but he aggressively declined it, which broke his heart.
“Draco only described it to me
"Good," Malfoy said. "Once a week seems fair enough."
Harry followed Malfoy deeper into the forest trying to ignore the sounds that called out to him from behind the undergrowth. Just when he’d decided this was madness and Malfoy was looking to die, the Slytherin came to a halt. He stood in a little clearing with rays of moonlight illuminating his pale form making his skin appear almost transparent.
Draco's hand curled around the door handle so hard the pain shot straight to his head.
“And why not tomorrow?”
“Bit obvious, aren’t they?”
Harry had frowned. “After what?”
They flew around the Quidditch pitch a couple of times before flying close to the Castle walls. This elicited startled yelps from Gryffindors when Harry and Ron tapped at the windows with big grins. Harry had to remind himself to pace himself more than once. Ron's broom was older and slower than his but he felt such joy for the first time in a while and it barely bothered him.
Harry dragged his gaze to his face and Draco gave a mild smile.
Harry chuckled. “No argument there.”
Blaise chuckled at that. "We're Slytherins, Malfoy. We may be devious, cunning and deceitful among other things, but we have a code."
His fingers crept up Harry’s face and he shivered as Draco pulled him closer.
Zabini laughed.
How naïve of her to think she knew what would fix him. What would
Draco shrugged as he slipped a few of his notes into the front pocket of his bag. There were a few lists at the bottom of his trunk but they were all dated so he ignored them.
Merlin, he should just give up on the party. He knew what Slytherins were like and what they would be wearing, he would stick out like a sore thumb.
“Old age, they think. But they’re not sure.”
Harry frowned. “Should I have more to say?”
Malfoy's dubious gaze shifted to Harry.
She shook her head.
"What did you say?"
“May I sit?”
Harry didn’t know why he felt so nervous but Draco was clearly picking up on it from the bond.
“You’re certain?”
“Draco.”
But Ron was not stupid. “Why would he have another –?”
Draco was about to say no but stopped himself before he could. "Maybe. Why?"
Hermione fixed Ron with a glare.
He wasn’t sure if he said it or made a noise.
“I prefer to eat there if I don’t have a choice. Tomorrow, no such luck.”
“Memories back yet?” he whispered.
“You’re alright with this?” he asked.
Blaise didn’t glance back at him.
Draco chose to ignore that and focused instead on his neglected potion.
“He did what?” Harry whipped his head around fast enough that he hissed at the crick in his neck.
"He is out."
Harry regained consciousness for what he hoped was the last time. The past forty-eight hours seemed too disjointed to be two days at all. Beside him, Draco lay with his eyes shut and his arms around him. Harry tried to peer at the clock but couldn’t see a thing even with the fire burning low in the grate.
“Mistress Malfoy is not pleased.”
“Dobby is wondering when Draco Malfoy will come to see Dobby.”
As the seeker, Harry stood at the very back, across from the Slytherin stand-in seeker. He was a tall lanky boy, a fifth year probably for Harry would recognise a fellow sixth year even if he was making it a point not to look his direction.
That gave Draco pause. “Did I hurt you?” he asked even though it was the last thing he should be asking.
They left the station as soon as they had secured Draco’s things in the boot. He contemplated the rush hour traffic with distaste. Potter would already be at the meeting point by now and Draco wasn’t in any mood to wait.
“See?” Pansy looked at Draco with a satisfied smirk, then she looked back at Harry “Do you happen to wear a pair of ripped black jeans with a stripe t-shirt, and a pair of worn Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneakers today?” She said, describing all the items that the mysterious guy from the picture wore earlier this morning. Draco had caught him walking in the campus and from the style the guy was wearing, he immediately fell in love, it was totally his ‘
“Er, I’m sorry” Harry said, his arm reaching out to pat Draco softly on his shoulder “You seem perfect and I think he’s a jerk for cheating on you”
“Er…”
” Draco mewled when Potter started massaging his feet, this was way better than whatever Draco was doing to his feet earlier
“Here we are” Harry mumbled, opening another door to revealed the sight
responsible”
” Harry murmured, shaking a bit before taking Draco’s hand in his, he intertwined their fingers, smiling as he met Draco’s eyes “I like you, a lot, Draco, and I didn’t want to ruin what we have. Ron told me to move on because I thought you didn’t like me, but I couldn’t stop thinking about you, so I was going to confess to you earlier, then I saw Ernie…and I kind of acted out on impulse and asked you to move in. I thought...if I didn’t have you, I’d still want you to be close to me”
“I suggest we take this discussion elsewhere,” Amelia said between chuckles. “I can tell we will not want to be here for what happens next.” Most of the people in the room looked at her questioningly.
To add insult to injury, Tobias lent down quickly and kissed the terrified boy on the lips, hard enough to bruise them, and smirked. “Watch yourself, Weaselby – I’ll be waiting for you to fuck up.” He stood and walked past Lucius and Severus, straight to Draco and wrapped his arms around the taller, broader teen, before letting the fear and rage take over him in waves of shudders and shivers. Concerned, Draco wrapped his own arms around the slighter boy clinging to him.
Tobias laughed. “I don’t mind paperwork and it is something to do with our Pack.”
“Calm down, young one. Your husband reacted like any proud father-to-be would. We don’t know how your wolf took it, but your father is adamant about protecting you during this time. You have a letter from him on the bedside table for you to read. Your phoenix left to tell your father that you were awake, so expect a visit from him, Draco’s parents and the Wolf at lunch today. Once you have read the letter, you may go – but remember to stay away from the Headmaster.”
“It is time. Don’t forget the hood.”
She chuckled again as a soft cheer reached her ears as the group left the building. She carefully put the parchment to one side and looked up at the next person who had come to see her.
~END FLASHBACK~
“Oh Lulu,” Fred sighed in mock exasperation, “Haven’t you learned yet?”
Pansy, Ginny, Blaise and Neville moved to Severus’ side immediately. Draco sneered at them. “Go ahead and answer the all like good little puppies. That’s all we’ll ever be to him – Play things and lapdogs!”
Tobias sighed. “Yes Lykos.”
“That day last week I was beyond furious. Thanatos tried his hardest to calm me down, but when that didn’t work; the wolf guardian in me took charge and calmed me down with a hunt.” Remus laughed. What better way to calm down an enraged wolf then for it to hunt? Tobias continued, sending Remus a look saying that he understood what he was laughing at. “Today’s guardian thinks I’m a sweet kit, even if I do grumble about her mothering me.”
Draco sighed in relief when he saw the gates close behind him. He had been so worried that Dumbledore would try attacking them while they were unprotected that he had ordered several of The Pack to transform to aid in scenting the area. He didn’t think he’d ever had a more stressful walk in his life!
As the Death Eaters muttered to each other in confusion Tobias clicked his fingers.
“Don’t worry,” Draco grinned, making Deloris more scared than she was already, “we will aid you in fixing that.”
Lucius laughed at that. “Only a Gryffindor could think something like that would be fun.”
“Lucius! Narcissa! We are going to have friends for the holidays!”
If none of the older Pack members ate much, no one said anything; after all, they would soon be seeing just how far the soon-to-be ex-Headmaster had fallen in his attempt at keeping his pawn under his control. It also shocked no one when, instead of a full meal, Dobby appeared beside Tobias with a mug of thick liquid.
“I do promise.”
“I am fine, Neville, just fine.” She turned to Tobias. “I believe we need to talk youngster.”
Before Pavarti could speak, Padma hit her with a silencing spell.
“You had me fucking well drugged and put the cursed things on me – not for my safety, but because you knew I would be coming into my inheritance this year. You knew that I was the heir to one of the founders, and you didn’t want me to get it. I couldn’t even protect myself from anything that might happen.” Harry held out a hand, and to everyone’s surprise, Severus handed him a newly enlarged pensieve. Harry nodded his thanks and placed it onto the table. Turning to Remus, he closed his eyes and let the werewolf remove a memory. “This is one thing that occurred when I was unable to protect myself because of the three of you.” He said coldly. The memory shocked everyone, with one of the twins leaving the room, dry retching. It was the one that Severus walked in on, but without him interfering. Severus frowned at the implication.
“Calm down you two,” Pansy said eventually. “It isn’t like they are far.”
“Master called Mimpsie?” the elf shivered fearfully.
“Grained toast with strawberry jam, banana, a really runny egg and sardines in tomato sauce,” he said after he swallowed his mouthful. “But it is missing something ,” he pouted. Man of the males around him pushed their plates away, struggling to keep whatever they had managed to eat in their stomachs. “It tastes bland. It needs something ...”
Here I am (Here I am)
Severus whined softly and pushed himself closer to Remus, who just rolled his eyes and pushed him away slightly. “You did the wrong thing, Severus,” he stated as he stood. “Now you need to face your punishment like a true wolf.”
“Skotadi?”
“Does he treat you well?” Tobias asked softly.
Tobias nodded in thought. Severus was still shocked that the others in The Pack didn’t attack while the boy was weak. It was then that he started to understand Remus’ protectiveness of their Neogennito – Wait a second … Their Neogennito?
“And how exactly were you forced and who was responsible?”
“Soup filling and tasty and nutritious. All good for growing baby and mother.” The other female said.
Draco felt his mouth go dry as Tobias rose slowly from where he lay. He watched, mesmerised, as the green-eyed man walked slowly towards him, giving tantalizing glimpses of the taunt, almost golden, flesh that was hidden by the white robes.
“Please ignore them. I told them it was a bad idea to get the portraits done when Sal was with child,” Helga shook her head. “You have our permission to enter, but please don’t disturb the young Masters – I don’t think either of them could keep awake any longer.”
Severus sighed. “Yes, he is. How do you know?”
It was false dawn when Tobias finally awoke. He felt well rested, which was odd for him. Raising his head, he found himself looking into Draco’s eyes. Realising he had spent the night curled up on Draco’s lap with his face hidden in his chest made Tobias blush in shame.
Theodore told The Pack straight out that he was asexual when questions started flying around about him bonding. To his amusement, no one reacted in the way he thought they would and within a few hours they had informed him that he was now married to his job.
The object of his lesson swallowed, nodded and promptly fainted.
Draco looked at his husband and smiled before looking back at her. “It makes Bi happy and a happy Bi means there is less chance for a change in his emotions, but if you want a pissed off, hormonal Tobias ...”
Watching the Slytherin table from his position at the Head Table, Severus almost beamed with pride. He knew how hard it hit the Slytherins to have every house against them. He was intrigued at the way Tobias had been able to make the first through third year students accepted by both Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. He’d have to remember to ask the boy about that at the meeting next weekend.
“Fine,” Tobias pouted. “I’ll stick him to a chair and silence him the next time I want to mate my husband and there will be no silencing charms around us, only to stop him from talking.”
Draco looked at the table. “I’ll just have my usual thanks Theo.”
“I, Draco Riddle-Malfoy, bonded mate to the Founder’s Heir, call upon the name and protection of Salazar Slytherin for the people in these rooms so they cannot speak of what I am about to reveal to none who are already aware. So Mote It Be.”
The goblins who were seated around the room leapt to their feet and crowded around the desk, squabbling in Gobbledegook as sections were pointed out. After several long minutes, the goblins separated.
“I warned you, Tobias Regulas Riddle. I warned you that if you touched me before I said you could, you would be tied up til I let you go. Now,” Draco purred, appearing back on top of his husband, “Where were we? Oh yes, I remember.” And with a self-satisfied smirk, he lowered his head and nibbled on an exposed collarbone before leaving a claiming mark and left small nips and biting kisses to the other side.
“Eight days?”
Tobias sighed and stretched cat-like. “You have permission, Booph. When it comes to my Pack and family, you don’t need to ask. You know that.”
Luna walked out of the private room, exhaustedly. She looked around and saw Ginny seated at the table with two steaming cups. She walked over and collapsed into the seat.
--FLASHBACK—
“There is no room for either of them in the opposite room. Each room can hold a specific number of people and both rooms are full.”
Standing here where I've always been
Sally-Ann giggled softly. “My sisters are doing the same, except it is involving me, father and a shot gun.”
Ginny and Luna ignored the rest of the list as their grip on each other tightened slightly. They didn’t like this. They didn’t like this at all. Instinctually, the two of them sent an emotional burst towards the rest of The Pack. They got the return of reassurance at the same time Madam Bones called out their names. Both girls relaxed. They were together, that was all that mattered right now.
Draco clicked his fingers and a house-elf popped in almost silently with a large tray of goodies for a pregnant person. He nodded and walked to Tobias, wrapping a guiding arm around the waist of the sleepy male.
Both Malfoy men paused outside the door and straightened themselves up. With a dramatic flourish that would have made Gilderoy Lockhart weep in envy, Draco through open the door and strode inside.
Is mine to give or lend.
Tobias laughed as Draco led him around the castle blind-folded. “Where are we going?”
“We are agreed there father,” Draco said with a grimace at the unconscious female.
“Those being the true identity of your father, plans concerning the twins work and the like,” Achalendra said with a self-depreciating smile. “I understand youngling. You’ve been stung too many times by both the light and dark sides to trust anyone of either side. Thank you for trusting me enough to say that you are on the darker side of grey before signing the contract.”
“I know Ray. I know. Make yourself comfortable Love, I’m not going anywhere.”
“Thankfully, it only lasted until he had our daughter,” Godric continued with a half-smile. He turned serious and gazed at the young blonde. “You need to understand that children need the magic of their parents. Muggleborn wizards and witches are an anomaly and we don’t know how they come about, but a popular theory is that they are receptors of magic and so pull on the small amounts of magic from the ley lines in the Earth and from the atmosphere.”
Soon the entire castle was empty, allowing for a soft girlish squeal of excited delight to echo in its halls.
Trembling with fear, Ron started to struggle, screaming for help, not noticing that the ropes were being pulled tighter until he couldn’t move at all.
Severus squeezed the bridge of his nose. “Did you think to check with the Castle? Or even in the room he now shares with his PREGNANT husband?”
Several of the Death Eaters chocked in their shock and the Dark Lord rose. “Is my personal Healer here, by chance?” he asked smoothly.
Draco grinned. “The whole School was speechless! It was so funny, Bi. I thought the Gryffindors would die of a heart attack, they went that red!”
Zog cut in with a similar smirk. “I don’t think we’ve heard you laugh that hard nor that much before or since then. I wonder why?”
The man nodded once, sharply and disappeared. Tobias stood straight, only just containing the sigh he wished to expel from his lungs. Now for the hard part.
“My teachers ignore me and even my parents have turned against me.”
He looked at the table and gasped feeling tears gathering behind his eyes. The table was set for two with the best plates, cups and cutlery the Malfoy family could afford. Two silver candlestick holders sat on either side of the table and in the very centre was a crystal vase holding a bunch of ten roses; three yellow with pink tips, three the colour of Champaign, three pale blue and in the very centre, one single black one. He felt a single tear roll down his cheek.
As the adults discussed their plans for the day, The Pack completed their meal. Before they left the room, Voldemort called Tobias to him.
Severus looked up from the letter he was re-reading. “Sorry what was that?”
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Lucius said as calmly as he could. “How much do you give your silent partner on average?”
Before anyone could open their mouths, the Daemon had vanished. With a shrug, everyone decided on when they were going to go a meet the cub.
“Are you okay?” Tobias asked, not bothering to get up from where he was.
“You should sleep Tobias,” she said softly as she sat beside him, “Even if it is only for twenty minutes.”
He joined in on the resultant laughter before heading in the opposite direction from the rest of the group.
A soft chuckle bought both teens from their place in a world away and they flushed in embarrassment.
Anywho, hope you enjoy this chapter :3
Meeting after curfew. Kitten will bring you. Make sure you are dressed.
“No Gios. I’m not disappointed with you. What you have is special – don’t do anything to ruin it.”
Severus nodded. “So when are we leaving?”
As quietly as he could, Severus crept into the receiving room where Remus was napping on a poorly transfigured bed that used to be an uncomfortable three seater that had been stashed in their room. Severus smirked to himself before creeping up to his lover and blowing a soft stream of air into the unprotected ear closest to him.
Professor Snape,
“This is the phoenix formally known as ‘Fawkes’. He is now loyal to me and mine. His name is hereby changed to that of Thanatos, or Thanis.”
Mary-Lou
“J-“ Lucius handed him a small amount of water in a glass. “Thank you, Father.”
“What is that?” Lucius asked wrinkling his nose in disgust as the dark-haired teen put a large amount of the glop on the fish.
“I have no idea,” Neville replied, only just managing to keep his laughter hidden from everyone else.
Tobias chuckled before yawning. “It was my pleasure Dynamo. It is a wonderful feeling when you see the ones you love as happy as you are with your partner with their own.”
“Good. Tomorrow night we are going to be introduced to father’s followers – All of them. There will be malcontent from them. They will try to harm you. They will not be allowed to do so. The dreams you have been having is in fact the training you were promised. Everything you could do in them you can do in the here and now. I am not your Lord. I will be the Young Lord to Pateras’ followers, but I am your Alpha. You are my family. I would kill to protect you. There is little doubt in my mind that I will have been forced to do so by the end of this weekend. The only being allowed to punish any of you is myself – but I will never make the punishment public or lasting. I cannot promise that it will not be painful. I will not waste energy in punishing other people for my own mistakes either. I do not wish for you to fear me. The only time I will go against this is if one of you disobeys or harms either Drakontas or myself.”
The next day found Tobias in a very bad mood. He had to go back with the Weasleys. While this in itself was not enough to put him in a bad mood, it was that he had to return to The Burrow, where he was sure that both Ron and Hermione would be waiting to ambush him on Dumbledore’s orders.
Booph bowed slightly. “Akzant’tra and his mate are what you would call Demi-Daemon. When their human body dies, they will essentially be reborn into a body that will last. In essence, they are Immortals in a mortal body. That is the creature part of their bond. It ties them together for the rest of their lives, and they will not die until the both of them agree it is time for them to die once they reach that form.”
Before the group lay a large mosaic of the Hogwarts Coat of Arms, and motto. Beside each house on the shield was a mosaic of that house’s founder.
Vincent looked up at the blonde girl, hazel eyes littering intelligently. “Allow me to take you to your seat my Lady,” he said in a soft voice.
“What do you mean ‘finish with me?” Deloris shrieked making the humans wince.
Everyone laughed as the twins greeted their little sister while Bill and Charlie attempted to hide their faces in their hands. It was evident that they had known – and protested – what the twins had planned.
“Thank you Dobby,” Tobias muttered, “What is it?”
“SHUT THE FUCK UP!” he screamed, making those close to him wince and cover their ears. “HAVE SOME COMMON FUCKING CURTESY FOR YOUR FELLOW STUDENTS, PROFESSORS AND GUESTS!”
He yawned again.
“A word of advice,” Tindershank cackled at the gobsmacked mid-wife, “NEVER separate a bonded pair when one is giving birth, especially if they have a magical being bond. It’s the fastest and most gruesome way to kill the bearer.”
“Oh, I was just helping Ginny with her date with Luna today” Pansy shrugged, opening the book she brought with her “She needed
my Theo” Draco smacked Theo’s back and laughed quietly
going out nor fucking anyone at the moment” Draco gave him a knowing smirk “He hasn’t been for a while now, you’re his roommate, you should know. Is that what you want to ask?”
“Hey” Harry smiled at him, Draco stared at his outfit in horror, the git was in his Auror uniform, which only made it weirder because the Aurors were let go early today so there was no way Harry, Ron and Neville were still wearing their uniforms now “Should we sit down?”
“Don’t worry—…”
“Then I’ll have to use plan B” Pansy said, filling her cocktail up with her wand “Cancelling your stripper and we’ll still end up having to call Draco”
“He’s too nice, I don’t know”
“Was the sex good though?” She took his hand off her face and asked, her big eyes staring into his soul
“What are you doing?”
“And this time is your first time?”
do it for you if you can’t”
“It went easier than I expected, I at least thought my father would react way more”
“Then I’ll be sad” Harry pouted and Draco couldn’t help but laughed softly, leaning on Harry’s shoulder
“Yeah, it was supposed to be a myth, but only one person that had seen it, that I know of” Harry said, pulling Draco down to sit on the ground “Remus Lupin, you know him right? He’s my godfather’s husband, he saw the mirror in Hogwarts too, years ago, he saw himself killing Sirius with his own hands under the full moon, it was the thing he feared most. Since then, it never came back”
“Yeah, because then, I asked is there any universe where you two aren’t kissing, then the funny part is, Ron suggested maybe a world where you two hate each other” Pansy said, he knew Lovegood was always the one to say weird things, but he didn’t know the things she said might actually be true “But then you said, and I quote ‘
when you got drunk, we’d spin the bottle to see who get to bring you home”
“Yeah” Ron nodded while trying to untie Harry with a flick of his wand “He wasn’t really going with plan A”
“Alright then” Blaise said, his lips never left Ron’s neck, he walked backwards, guiding the redhead with him, and Ron was pulled into one of the stalls in the restroom “Better?”
He grabbed at the blond’s robes, but Draco didn’t dare look back, he snatched his robes back and pulled Pansy away. It was a hard thing to do, but he has to keep doing it until he could find out what was actually going on.
“I think you should remove your arm from my boyfriend’s neck before I break it in half” He said nicely with a smile, Potter was staring at him, but he didn’t care, it was his turn to save the Golden Boy from this mess
boyfriend?”
” Draco rasped, chuckling a bit when Harry still kept thrusting in him slowly “Still not satisfied?”
“Sounds like you care enough to get mad about it” Draco said, Hermione looked at both of them and opened her book, ignoring them while Ron cackled at her
” Ron snapped back
” He scowled at Blaise and turned his head around but just saw the bastard smirking at him
“It’s stupid when I say it’s stupid” She covered his lips with her finger and stopped him from talking “You have been hiding in your place, looking like a wreck every single day. And it breaks my heart seeing you like that, Draco. And I’m sorry it ended like that, no one knew it would happen that way, we surely didn’t expect it. How were you supposed to know you two were going to break up
“Yeah, are you taking a shower?”
“You bite your lips when you’re focused, you hate sweating, that’s why you always cast a Cooling Charm whenever you play Quidditch or in the summer. And when you put on your shirt, you button it from the last button up to the top button, not the other way around”
“Come on, old man, let’s dance” Ron slapped Blaise’s thigh and grinned “I know you still miss smoking, come, dance so you can forget”
”You’re joking”
” Draco said against his lips and moaned low when Harry continued pushing in the blond’s still tight entrance. Once he has managed to get it all in, Harry let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, he gripped on Draco’s waist, his lips brushing over the blond’s shoulder and began thrusting at a slow pace, hearing Draco’s breathy moan next to his ear and feeling his nails on Harry’s back “
“I saw us in the mirror yesterday, that’s why I thought it was actually broken” He said, stepping even closer than before, making Draco’s mind explode like fireworks “I saw us in the mirror now, I realised my feelings for you yesterday after seeing you cried and had some doubts about whether the mirror could ever be broken or not, so I asked Hermione and it couldn’t be” He turned to it and Draco also saw themselves in the mirror again. He smiled, turning back to gaze into Harry’s eyes “You are who I desire, Draco, I desire your love and your affection, I like you, and I want to love you”
“Can I just not kiss anyone?”
“Can you do my nails? I want to look gorgeous, drop dead gorgeous tomorrow” Theodore showed his hands and Accio a few nail polish bottles from his trunk “Pansy, I need your help too”
“Wait and see” Pansy grinned at him, she stepped back and waved her hand, opening the big double door to the kitchen with a spell “It’s Rose’s idea”
“My father knows a guy, he also sells it, I can ask my father for one” He said, his father knew a lot of people, he wouldn’t care if he asked for one broom “He’ll probably get it for free, so you don’t have to worry about the money. You can have it in a few days”
“Miss Parkinson, that’s a bit extrem-…”
“You like it when I’m teasing you” Harry whispered, his breath ghosting over Draco’s wet lips when they pulled apart “
“I pick later”
“Well, er, remember the time we walked past that store and you said you liked this ring? I was on my way home and I saw the store again, so I just thought, er, I could give it to you” Harry said, watching Draco being mesmerised by the ring. He lied, obviously, the store was nowhere near his way home, he has gone to the store days ago and asked them to engrave words in it just so he could give Draco this, since he liked the ring so much.
“You’re surprisingly relaxed for a person that barged in the Auror’s meeting and threatened the Head Auror” Draco snorted and Pansy chuckled quietly “Robards was sweating like hell back then”
, what a sight to see” Pansy whistled and looked at them amusingly “Darling, look”
“Yeah, I wanted to apologise to everyone I’ve treated badly”
“I can do it on my own” Draco grunted, his ankle hurts, but he could make it “I don’t need Potter”
“Looking for a partner, I hope” She looked at him, pushing her hair back behind her ear while blushing “This is awkward, I kept thinking of that time I confessed to you”
Draco said, reaching over to touch Harry’s cheek “You know you don’t have to do this, I can handle them”
“A what now?”
Draco put a hand up to deny Pansy’s outrageous suggestion
“It’s a brilliant idea, Ginny, might make all of you sober” Draco sugggested
“I didn’t say that” Draco argued and hooked his arm around Potter’s before looking at the girl “Sorry, he’s my partner for the class”
” Hermione snapped her fingers in front of him “You were zoning out again”
“Oh honey, I’m going to kill your aunts and uncle” Draco smiled, cupping their daughter’s face before spotting a familiar redhead“
“Ah, I see, he
“I kissed you?” He asked again, but Draco continued to ignore it, he grabbed the bronzer and kept going
“Woah” Harry picked up all the small pieces of articles Draco had cut out in his hands as if he was mesmerised by it “All of these are about me”
day, Draco would go on this date tonight, and all Harry did was buying ice creams, the ones that Draco likes.
“Oh, I get it” Draco nodded “You like someone, and it made you uncomfortable to apply sunscreen on me”
said I’m grumpy” Theo kicked Draco in the leg and smirked “Bitter”
me” Pansy furrowed her eyebrows, slapping his thigh and clicked her tongue “Get up, get dressed, and get out of here”
“Theo” Neville mumbled, pulling Theo in his strong embrace
Draco looked at the gloves in his hands, noticing his initials engraved on it, his heart threatened to burst “Did you have this made just for me?”
“The Dark Lord? Who’s that?”
“It’s fine” Draco laughed softly, he remembered it clearly. It was the first time someone ever said that they liked him, unfortunately he had to decline it, he was gay anyway, but he appreciated her words “So, have you found anyone you like?”
“I’m glad you almost kissed me that day” Harry pulled him against his chest, giving him the same soft look every time Harry was about to say something incredibly sweet “That’s when I know I’ve fucked everything up, because I was sure I’ve become infatuated by you”
“Malfoy, didn’t you get
“Harry, come on, mate, I
“I want to go down”
“Draco
“I got a study date to go to, I’ll see you later,
“I thought you were Draco” He said
“Bossy” Draco elbowed Harry at that and earned another laugh from the Auror, he beamed to himself and felt Potter’s arm around his slim waist, for the first time in years, he felt safe.
“Who doesn’t?” Pansy huffed, her face slowly slid down Hermione’s chest and she kept rubbing her cheeks on her wife’s undoubtedly comforting boobs, it felt more soft than any pillow she has ever lied on “They’re both idiots, they
“I am
dancer, but Pansy has told him he got great moves while dancing.
“I didn’t think of you as someone who’d lock their friend’s boyfriend in the loo, Harry” Brandon said, making everyone looked at him “All I did was comforting you about Haley when she had to leave”
“After this we’ll go back to…chill” Pansy squealed happily “Unlimited cocktails, Blaise gave us the best anniversary gift
“I know, Pansy” Hermione pulled her in a hug and kissed her forehead, letting Pansy’s buried in her neck “We can sit closer so Draco can sit down”
Seamus jumped up and danced with Padma in circles, everyone snickered at how goofy they both look.
”, Draco was certain Ginny gave Harry that, since she gave the blond a mug with the words “
“Fine, break your arm then, I don’t care” Draco snarled at him, he wanted to play nice, but Potter just has to mess it all up and made him angry “I’m not the one that just left the other to die on the floor like you, at least I wanted to help you” He watched the way Potter flinched at what he said, he wasn’t sure why he even mentioned that event, he was too furious to think straight.
“Yeah, our schedule is clear for the next two weeks” Blaise added
“I don’t know” He revealed the answer, he never knew himself what was the difference between them “I don’t know because I’ve seen many sides of him that I never saw in you, since we hate each other before” He sighed, intertwining his own hands together “I watched myself slowly falling for him. He told me we’d always be together in any time, any place. How crazy is that?” Draco chuckled softly, looking at Harry and continued “When I got back here, I wanted to prove that if everyone got together like they did in the other world, then maybe…
“Why did you come here tonight?”
Pansy got these animals, but she definitely pulled some big strings to have them
“You’re so lewd” Harry said as he came to the big revelation, he didn’t even know this fact about Draco himself, but he loved it. The blond didn’t answer, instead he licked a line up Harry’s jawline and knelt down steadily, his eyes locked with the Auror. The second Draco has his lips on Harry’s cock, he felt like his world had just exploded. Not in a million years has he ever think he’d be able to see Draco on his knees, his mouth on Harry’s length, swallowing it whole without any hesitation. Harry smacked his head against the wall, but he didn’t feel any pain, the ecstasy was filling him up instead “
“Yes” Pansy commented “You looked so peaceful, we almost left you here”
“Maybe next time”
. But what if I had remembered to order a stripper though?”
“Too nice? You don’t want
“Absolutely” He said quickly and nudged Potter with his elbow
“Is that really hard to believe?” Draco looked at him in an amused manner, if he looked closely there was a tinge of pink on the man’s cheeks “The fact that I…Draco Malfoy, is standing in front of you,
get over it, still doing it every day”
“Is that my ring? Where did you get this?”
“I’m sorry, that was insensitive of him, don’t answer that” Thomas chimed in with an apology and Draco glanced at Potter, who was sitting on the bed like a sad Crup
“As you wish” Harry murmured, his tongue licking the lobe of Draco’s ear, sending shivers across his spine. The blond gasped when he felt a cool fluid inside him, and leaned back to give access for Harry to suck on his neck
” Pansy rolled her eyes at him “Of course, you have to be with us every second of the day”
“Er, oh, I, I mean…I didn’t mean that, I just…I was just saying nonsense, er, don’t, don’t worry about that, nonsense, really”
you finish your meal and never during it, I like how you snore a bit when you sleep, I like how you always push my shoulder and blush when I compliment you, like you are now” Potter chuckled and Draco covered his cheeks with his hands, it was burning red now “And I…er, I like how you lean on me when you hear a funny story, whether it’s me telling it, or someone else, you always lean on me while laughing when I’m right next to you, but not on anyone else, so I always try to be close to you. But I like you most because you are the way you are, and I like it, I like you, your whole you, everything” Draco gave up, he was falling for Potter
“Hi, I’m Rose, and I’ll be your waitress tonight. Would you please follow me?”
“Maybe a night out?”
“You? Sceptical?” Draco chuckled “Seriously?”
like you do, Harry” Draco chuckled, feeling Harry nibbling at his neck and he leaned into it “Harry, we are not getting it on before their front door, we will be late”
“Hey…er, why is Potter looking at me?” Draco whispered, quiet enough for Harry not to hear it. Ron was surprised to hear his question as well, he leaned over and whispered
” Luna squealed, running up to them as they approached the entrance of the restaurant, she came for Harry first, pulling him in a tight hug, she was always the one to give the best hugs “You came. Are you feeling better?” She said, cupping his face and fixing his jacket
“Yes, I’m
“Are you open for tutoring?” He asked, waiting for an answer from Blaise, but all the guy did was keep writing. Draco smiled with a tiny bit of annoyance in his expression. Blaise was not the talkative type, but so did the other Blaise in the other world, he had noticed. Draco elbowed him and snapped his fingers “Blaise, come on, it’s a great deal”
“Hot?” Draco finished his sentence for Ernie, smirking at the way the Hufflepuff boy blushed. Everyone in Slytherin knew Terrence was the hot one, he was actually Theo’s first sexual awakening but Draco didn’t need to tell Ernie that “So, are you interested in him and wants to ask about his information?”
“Pansy…I’m Draco, but…I’m not the Draco you know” He said softly, but she only looked at him, asking him to continue explaining “I, I can’t tell you how I got here, but please, tell me, what else happens in this world?”
“You better make it quick, it’s been over a month. How could Harry go on living like this, not knowing a single thing that happened to you, I’ll never know” Pansy shook her head, judging him with her tone of voice. She leaned back on the wall next to him, watching the Gryffindors taking pictures with each other and continued “You like him, don’t you?”
!” Blaise yelped quietly when Ron punched his chest
“The point wasn’t to see his dick, Draco” Hermione laughed “But I felt it” She said while blushing “It’s heavy”
He said, pushing Harry away and grinned at him, only to realised what he had just done. Harry was standing there, staring at him in disbelief, Draco cleared his throat and retrieved his hands on Harry’s arms, he was trembling himself too “I mean, you got it, good job, Potter”
“I know” Pansy laughed and pushed his hand off “Okay why did your hand smell like bacon?”
favourite drink “I noticed it’s your favourite”
“Do you have feelings for me?”
” he smiled cheerfully “Hi”
“Coming!” Hermione put her hair up into a bun and took her shirt off too, running after her spouse. They both jumped into the water and started swimming
Theodore squeaked loudly, throwing the Witch Weekly on the ground “And he left early the next day, when I woke up, everyone was gone, so I assumed it was
Harry murmured between kisses, and that was when Draco slipped his tongue inside, the way they kiss was like the way they acted around each other, fighting back and forth for domination, but also tender and soft, full of passion and heat “
Pansy cupped his face and shrieked at him in the crowded pub, her voice all high and squeaky “
Draco squealed loudly, pulling Harry up to pull him in a hug, he was crying already, tears soaking into Harry’s shirt, but he didn’t care, he kissed Draco’s cheek as they pulled apart “
, but still, not good for Luna”
“Oh” Draco said quietly, turning to Harry with a soft smile “Scared?”
“See you later, Weasley” He said, distracting himself from Harry’s gaze. If this was the past, Draco’d have thrown a few insults at him, but now he has stopped, he guessed Harry’d feel weird too. Draco sighed once he saw Theodore, who should be talking to Neville right now.
”Ron told me she even planned on ambushing Harry tonight, so a chance to kiss him? Probably will make her go insane. And then for all we know they’re going to shag, all day, every day. Just…hot, raw, animal sex because I mean, have you
“Wait why—…”
will be there” Harry said, finally got the word ‘
” Harry glanced at the mirror and looked back at Draco, who was now blushing from the way he called Draco honey. He grinned, leaning up to kissed Harry on the lips. What the other version of himself had said was true, in any time, any place, any universe, Harry and him would always end up together, and that was it.
“I have wanted to say this for so long” Harry said, leaning down so their foreheads touched, stepping closer to close the gap between them “You have no idea”
“I don’t want to”
“Then why are you here?”
“Anything you want”
He ogled at the redhead from the moment he changed into his outfit, which was only trousers and suspenders, and yes, he was half naked again, no shirt, just suspenders. Theo really got this whole hot-Aurors-calendar thing set up in his mind the second Pansy explained it.
“No can do” Potter said “You can barely walk”
“So, Draco Malfoy,
“Oh, have you seen my scarf? I think the last place I left it was a few months ago when you healed my shoulder” Potter said, Draco realised he forgot to give Potter back his scarf the moment he has his eyes on the Gryffindor’s bare neck. Since that night, he had brought it back and folded it nicely, leaving it next to his pillow. For some reasons, it felt reassuring to sleep next to it.
“Oh wait” Hermione stopped midway and crouched down, she dipped her hand down into the sand and picked up something shiny
“Er, I think it was in the lift, and you walked in, I said hi and you said hi back, and I was going to say more but then your boyfriend walked in with you, and er…I, you know”
“You called for Dobby?” the elf asked, appearing in what seemed to be a white muggle chef’s hat, canary yellow shirt, dark grey shorts, a purple and tan stripped apron and holding a whisk covered in a creamy pale brown substance.
Sipping the drink after the chowder was finished, both boys were delightfully surprised. The drink was slightly tart and very refreshing. The two of them were chatting about their favourite spells to perform in each class when Ruen and R’thir returned.
The phoenix trilled and Harry glared at it. “I KNOW BECAUSE I SEE IT WHEN I TOUCH THEM, YOU OVER GROWN ROAST CHICKEN!” he exploded. “I TOUCH ANY PIECE AND I SEE THAT OLD FUCKER HANDING IT TO DUDLEY, TELLING HIM IT IS THE LAST THING I GOT FROM SIRIUS BEFORE HE DID AND THEN TELLING HIM TO DESTROY IT. Do you know how he did it? Of course you don’t.” Harry continued, his voice turning to bitter chips of ice and the flames growing and spreading around him, changing colours.
The Mother and Father looked at each other with eyes wide in wonder before they let their eyes wander over the scene before them. The light of the magic released by the boys has been strong enough for the entire garden to be seen as if it were the middle of the day. Looking back at the other, they remained speechless at the combined strength of their chosen couple.
Draco and Severus laughed softly.
Remus eyed his lover. “Are you sure you know what you’re doing?”
He stood tall and bowed deeply to Tobias. “May I request the presence of George Fabian Weasley for a trip to the homeland of my family at the end of Padma’s seventh year? And may I request that Padma remain with you and your Pack this summer?”
“Is there a time limit on when the contract has to be fulfilled?” Padma asked unexpectedly. “What?” she asked at the looks her Father, Pavarti and Madam Bones were giving her, “I’m hoping to work as a barrister or solicitor when I leave Hogwarts and I think it is a more than reasonable question.”
“Question: Explain why you need to study Potions for the first five years of Schooling. Answer: Headmaster Dumbledore wants to test us to see if we really are brave enough to be Gryffindors.”
She noticed the youngest Weasley spawn open his mouth to argue and raised her voice.
“What’s wrong Lucius?” Severus asked.
A puzzled pair of girls rose. When they reached the head of the table, Draco put up a silencing spell.
“We know we don’t have to,” Pansy replied, “but it is our job to ensure that you are safe, so we will take it in turns to watch you. We agreed to it before we started and nothing you say will change our minds.”
“Lord Malfoy,” she responded with a nod.
“I didn’t believe my Grandson when he said our client could charm one of our warrior’s if he so wished,” the goblin cackled, “but I see now he was being truthful. I am Grapplehank. Welcome to my domain.”
“It’s alright, you can remain seated Lords.” Ruen said, amused. “Tonight is about the two of you. We have agreed to join you because you show us the same degree of respect as you do to those of your own species. You do not need to show that respect to us all the time. You are members of our herd now.” The centaur smiled.
“What about that?”
“Nothing you do is petty,” Draco said well aware that the Dark Lord would not hold Snape in such high esteem if his mind wasn’t extremely keen. “But no, I’m not here for that today.”
Haneul stepped into the room, breathing surprisingly calm. Harry stored this fact away for later. “We don't.”
“About hidden passages and…” He turned to Hermione and saw that she was having the same realisation though probably for different reasons.
“Alright, everyone calm down,” Dumbledore said. He glanced around for a moment as though searching for something. “Is that pasta I smell?”
A flash of green blinded him for a moment and he saw the tip of the tentacle float away. Without thinking, Harry forced himself to grab Malfoy's arm and swim towards the surface.
"Make sure you finish your homework," she called to Harry as he left then shook her head a small smile on her face.
Crabbe, who was much closer, and recovered from the effects of the
Harry closed the distance between them.
There was a hint of something in his eyes, surprise maybe and perhaps a hint of smugness.
“Enough about me. How was Easter in Hogwarts?”
He didn’t fight them as they deposited him against a wall. His body refused to obey him anyway and all he wanted to do was sleep. He wanted to go somewhere far away where could see Harry’s face again.
“Draco,” the man said tearing his gaze from Harry.
Harry smiled. “Maybe I do and I like it.”
He forced himself to go to the refreshments table so he would have something to do. No one here knew him here except for the Malfoys, Blacks, Parkinson and Zabini. He was confident no one would ask him to dance, why would they anyway?
Neville beamed and nodded furiously.
Draco sighed and run his fingerer's down Harry’s wet temples.
But he was not the only one who might give in if Harry didn't stop. He looked down at himself and saw that he was painfully hard too.
Harry realised Draco was talking to him, gesturing to the room.
His gaze caught on the fruit basket at the centre of the island and he wondered how he’d missed it. There were a few apples and some oranges but more pears than anything else. Harry assumed they were safe to eat and picked out an apple.
Harry didn't want to but he found himself moving experimentally just like Zabini had.
Or maybe Malfoy had just been cussing. Harry didn’t want to have to consider this a possibility. But it was what people did when upset or frustrated. If Harry had been yelling to Malfoy to catch his damn broom and all Harry did was stare at him like a fool then he would have been raving mad too.
He hadn’t believed the lie but it was an old habit and still clung to him.
Harry ignored her but the boy looked up and Harry saw he’d not been wrong at all. His hair was a deep cherry red like jam or sticky sauce on pie. His honey-coloured eyes moved from Harry to his friends. Harry paused, unsure whether to approach.
“Alright,” he said raising his wand.
Harry took a breath and smiled. “I will be yours forever. And you will be mine forever.”
"Would you rather I left?"
“Draco,” he all but yelled now.
“I’m saying I want it.” He thought it would be enough but the words hovered between them, Draco’s expression a mixture of disbelief and shock. Harry forced himself to go on despite the silence. “I give you my permission… to mark me.”
He had only been four when Severus told him about her. The redhead lady of his godfather’s past, a woman he’d loved. Perhaps the only one. At first, he thought she was some kind of fatty tale but as he grew older and the tales more complex, he began to ask questions.
“No… no…”
“Blaise never liked me and he resented Draco for being with me but what are the chances Draco went looking for them and the only other person who’d seen him today was Nott?”
He broke off with a sigh.
“He’s a pain in the arse,” Harry muttered, trying not to think what it had cost him last year.
He held him all the way to King’s Cross and told him it was alright to cry.
There was another crack and the bones in his legs snapped and reformed. A soft sheen covered his body in the places where there was no far. He looked more animal than beast, feral and deadly.
Harry shook his head and started to say something.
Harry nudged them to the train and let go to arrange his luggage. Draco shut the door a moment later and they collapsed on the chair. They sat in silence for a moment and the train had begun moving when something occurred to Harry.
"What is it?"
Hermione returned to her chair, done making a spectacle. The smile on her face was one of disbelief as she leaned forward. Her face bore the expression she got when McGonagall presented her with a difficult problem.
“Is it still not a problem?” Draco challenged.
“I can’t, I have to meet Dumbledore.”
his mind screamed but that was different. Draco was alive and breathing whereas Myrtle was a ghost. He couldn't... touch her. He also couldn't say anything because he didn't know what to say to her. He didn't really know her.
Harry’s hand tightened against his wait as he ran his tongue along Draco’s skin. Draco gripped him hard, harder when his teeth grazed his skin.
Harry gaped as Draco walked back to the shower with a smile.
He knew it was a stretch even as the thought it. If plans had changed, Draco would have told him.
Ron watched with growing irritation.
“What did you say?”
“Yes?” he responded, careful not to wake everyone else.
{HPDM}
Harry didn't know and he was so tired of not knowing. He just wanted everything to go back to normal.
“Believe me, I know.” Draco clutched at the railing. “My body will deal with it. I just need time.”
“What the bloody hell?”
“How you can stomach this is beyond me,” he said scanning the heavy tomes.
“Draco,” he said when the silence had dragged on far too long.
Harry didn’t want to think what Nott had been showing Ginny. He was glad to be able to dismiss the idea as soon as it came to mind. Then he realised what this was about and wondered why Ginny had come to him of all people.
Would he have done the same thing for his mother?
“You’re still afraid, I can smell it.” Draco laughed. He couldn’t smell emotions but he knew Warrington would believe anything at this point. “Come back when you’re man enough and stop wasting my time.”
“Little Whining,” he said hoping it would bring an end to the conversation.
Harry glanced at him then followed Malfoy’s gaze to the front of the classroom. Slughorn rattled off instructions for the group assessment they would complete in this lesson. He did not so much as glance at Harry as he did so.
Draco broke into laughter.
"Anyway," Ron said making a show of laying the cards on the table and unrolling a piece of parchment. "I heard Malfoy's been benched."
"Alright there, Wonder Boy? You seem a little... star struck."
Lino appeared with a tea tray balanced on his reedy arms. He set it down on the table and began to unload it. He set a matching teapot and teacup before Narcissa. Then a similar teapot between Harry and Draco and two matching cups. He added a plate of cucumber sandwiches for Draco and a ham sandwich to Harry.
More chuckling. "You're so ruthless, Draco."
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry’s heart was beating fast now and he could feel the weight of nearly two day’s worth of interruptions bubbling in his abdomen. He spread his own fingers on the bannister pretending to lean forwards on one elbow, his mug balanced in his other hand.
“McNair?”
“The bond, I can sense it.”
“How do you know I haven’t pre-emptively hexed you?”
He opened his mouth to answer but the sound of footsteps cut him short. He yanked Hermione out of sight and into an alcove. Seconds later two people came into view. One stood straight and walked with an assured gait while the other hunched and held their limbs almost diligently.
She stood before him obstructing the heat flow from the fire. "I haven't asked you anything yet."
He'd left most of the managing in Ginny's hands which he thought was a good idea. The fact that they'd only practiced a total of five times since term began was his matter to deal with because it was he who would have to book the pitch. And Stone – the Slytherin captain – had beat him to it one time too many.
Zabini glared.
An assortment of rings glinted in the light every time he reached up to take a puff on his cigarette. He wore no signet ring, Harry noted. His eyes flicked back to the man (presumably Armand) and studied him. Armand caught his gaze and raised a brow in the familiar Malfoy way.
Harry run a hand through his hair and sighed. He needed to sort things out and he needed to do it soon. He was a few paces from the oak double doors when he heard loud voices approaching. He realised with a jolt the Slytherins would be returning from Quidditch practise now.
“I really don’t think – ” Harry started to say.
He'd practically jumped at the idea and Draco had had to listen to all the wonders of teaching Defence and the new ways he could make students suffer and perhaps fail the Golden Boy just a tad while he was at it. His godfather would have spent half his summer going on and on about it if it wasn't for Draco's polite choice to show him the door should he utter one more about the Potter even if it involved making him suffer.
Had Harry heard the words? His mind felt light enough that it was difficult not to dip into the bond. He rarely refrained from doing it – couldn’t control his actions as much as Draco – but he’d been trying and now all of a sudden…
“I wonder why you’re still all the way over there.”
The fire roared behind them and Harry couldn’t help a yawn. Hermione had long since retired to the girls’ dormitories. Harry wished more than ever that Ron would abstain from asking questions like he usually did. It made things easier not to have to endure interrogation from both of them.
The thought of fucking Draco had been at the back of his mind since Harry had those words. He’d dreamed about it, watched Draco come undone in his hands, all without a thought on how he would do it. Dean had seemed less likely to make fun of him than Seamus so Harry had asked a few casual questions.
He wanted to smile. Instead, he said, “I’m sorry for the delay.”
He wouldn’t turn it in like this – that would be absurd. But he liked knowing only Slughorn received such blatant disregard from him.
Draco smiled and glanced at Harry. “He is.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that but he must have looked incredulous because Draco said,
But he did not have that luxury.
But Harry knew he could do at least this. His relationship with Draco wasn’t set in stone but they’d both known what message his coming here would send. Medical history wasn't anything difficult or at least it didn't sound difficult.
He held his hands in the air signifying he meant no harm but Harry didn’t trust him. He could see his wand peeking from his pocket. It would take less than a second to draw and Zabini wouldn’t be cowed as easily as the other Slytherins.
With all the work he had to do and the task The Dark Lord had assigned him, he must have had a lot to bear. Narcissa let out a worried sigh. She has never been one to fuss over her child, never one for too much mothering, but Draco was her only child. She cared for him far more than she dared to admit.
"Oh shut up," he said. "We only drink butter beer."
Ginny beamed at him as she skipped down the corridor.
Draco pulled back with a laugh, gesturing to the room. “Now who's lured who?”
“What kind of question is that?”
“Maybe I should – ”
No one looked about to call Lino.
“Fuck,” Harry said looking up.
Harry couldn’t help his shock which morphed into a nervous laugh. “A bit?”
"I'll get through this year if it kills me," he told himself.
Ron didn’t even glance at him.
He’d gone much further than he thought. Underwater, it all looked the same but from here he could see just how far he was from the bank.
"Oh, Harry," she said when she spotted him at the back. "I was just explaining to the team why we should change our formation this season," she said like she needed to explain herself.
Whether or not he would rather know was irrelevant.
Wizarding society had only added to that. Draco had responded by shrinking that part of himself over the years. The part that had wanted to enjoy the company of someone he liked. Someone he could grow to love. He had shrunk it so much that it took far too much time and far too much pain to undo in the coming years.
as he had labelled it but the fact that his first shift was approaching. His body’s response was to prepare by secreting large amounts of adrenaline. He was currently pacing the sixth-floor corridor wishing desperately for something to calm his nerves.
He knew that.
“Wouldn’t.” Draco nodded and took another step closer. Nott didn’t step back but it took far too much effort. “Yes. But I know you’re not stupid either. You know things, places, secrets... ”
. "Fine," she said resignedly.
Harry shook his head. Snape had a lot of gall coming in here thinking he could do and say whatever he wanted. His fingers tightened around the edge of the counter until the pain forced him to release his grip. He would not go back down that road, he had doubted his father once and had his doubts confirmed but he was different now, older.
“Which is why we need to be here.”
"What do you mean?" he asked a little ticked off.
“I don’t see any recent ones.”
“Don’t,” Draco said, suddenly unable to hear the words from his mouth. Thinking them was one thing but hearing them would make them real. “You know why you said it.”
There would be time.
Severus was already halfway to them.
“To shut your fucking –”
Dumbledore had never shown himself to be a coward or a person who took the easy way out but he was only human and if Harry had a chance to escape all this, what was to say he wouldn’t take it?
It wasn’t something he liked thinking about.
He moved against Draco harder than ever before begging please… he would do anything…
Harry couldn’t look at him, he knew where this was going.
"You drank all that?" asked Harry a little shocked.
It had been almost half an hour since then. Now he took the steps down alone and unobserved. Majority of the guests had moved away from the landing long ago. They’d wanted to see the Malfoys and Blacks descend in their finest attire and only that. This entire thing had to be a ruse of some sort but Harry hadn’t had the opportunity to ask.
“It’s in the past now.”
Potions with Slughorn was like eating dry toast. It scratched and scraped down your throat then left a bitter taste in your mouth. It was evident that Snape surpassed this man in terms of intellect and brewing but there was nothing to be done if his godfather wanted to teach Defence more than potions.
“No,” Harry said in a hoarse voice. He scrubbed the tears away. “Not now.”
He splashed water on his face and grabbed his clothes from where they lay on the ledge. Lino liked to put them there as though his wardrobe was an insult to their fine appearance. Draco shook his head as he did up the buttons on the jacket.
Harry laughed to hide the fact that he was glad they didn't have time. He wasn't sure he was comfortable with wearing any spell work on his face.
{HPDM}
“They’re related to us tangentially. Bellatrix married Rodolphus who has a younger brother not many know of.”
He never did, instead, he fell into a long dreamless sleep and woke to nothing more than vague recollection as always.
And then there was the fact that one of the professors would find out about the alcohol. Potter didn’t strike him as a tattler but it was common knowledge he shared everything with his friends. He wouldn’t put it past that snooty nosed Granger to run to McGonagall the first chance she got.
“I’m fine,” Nott said. “But you came here for information, right?”
Harry watched him glance around in confusion as he made his way into the room.
Harry noticed that much like Draco, Armand seemed to draw confidence from his granduncle’s presence. For reasons he couldn’t explain, it set him at ease. It felt good to know Draco had relatives he could be free with.
Draco found it difficult to pay attention during the day's classes. Everything was too loud, too clear and exceedingly unbearable. Once during Arithmancy, Professor Vector had stopped his rambling to ask if Mr. Malfoy was alright and if he needed to see Madam Pomfrey. The whole class had turned to stare and Draco had replied with a curt
“And is that what’s been bothering you these past few weeks.”
And he was panting, on all fours, but still somewhat upright. Harry waited, the taste of blood from where he’d bit his tongue heavy in his mouth.
Harry shoved him and Draco grinned.
Draco glanced at him but said nothing.
"Mr Malfoy," this was the Headmaster," how do you feel?"
“Lady Ariandra Schmidt.”
“Heads up,” Blaise interrupted. “Post’s here.”
“Bricks and Mortar will not stay,
“Drink all of it, Harry. You need all the rest you can get to aid your body in healing itself, but drink this one first.” He handed him a potion that looked and smelt like cherry syrup.  When Harry looked at him in surprise and asked why he needed a deep numbing potion with blood replenishing and heavy duty healing and nutrient potion elements, Severus’ eyes widened in surprise. Harry grinned and downed the potions, one after the other.
The Minister blinked. “Yeees,” he drew out while thinking, “but who would be willing to swap?”
“We won’t go to the fact that said ‘Saviour’ is only sixteen, was almost beaten to death by the people the Light gave him to and that Randal treats him the way he should be treated – like a regular teenager,” Minerva said, pursing he lips in displeasure.
Remus had been watching his mate ever since the dark haired man had walked into the Hall. He’d been flabbergasted when Ginny, Neville and Luna had walked in and bowed their heads minutely in Severus’ direction. He had been shocked into silence when Severus had returned the gesture.
Once everyone was seated, Severus took a deep breath. “The Founder’s believe that Tobias is a Natural Bearer like Salazar Slytherin was, and he’s showing all the signs Salazar did when he was with child.”
“The bitch should have thought of that before touching what was mine. If she had, she wouldn’t be on my bad side.”
“Yes, but only because Tobias stopped Draco from killing him since Tobias was taking it out on him instead of the person who did it.”
“Don’t yell at her,” the boy growled, “she was only checking to see if you were alright, you ungrateful louse!” He turned to the girl and softly asked, “Are you alright sister mine?”
Draco sighed. He knew that it was unfair to his husband for this to happen and even though he wanted Tobias to be kept safe more than anything else, he thought this was going way too far. “I’ll talk to Sev okay? If all else fails, I’ll send for Algie and allow him to go all Healer on Sev’s arse, then set Remus and Tom onto him.”
“I trust you will get him back to the school unharmed?” Amelia stated with one eyebrow raised.
“How long have you known that Tobias is becoming depressed?”
Harry nodded and pulled the hood over his head until it covered all his features but his lower jaw. “I am ready.”
Remus laughed. “I’ll come with you, as long as either Bill or Charlie come with us.”
First day of 'practice' exams
“Set a man to watch all night,
“He doesn’t need to know that,” Tobias murmured into Draco’s neck. “Sorry for the stinging charm on the bedroom door, and the letter. I should have guessed you wouldn’t stay away without a reason.”
Eventually all teams had been chosen and Tobias transfigured a large chalkboard and its necessities out of a few sticks that had been gathered for the small fire that was burning in an empty drum.
“Is there anything that can be done?” Draco asked.
Lucius turned to his Lord and shivered.
“I didn’t,” Charlie snorted. “I didn’t care. To me, getting away from The Burrow was the most important thing.”
He didn’t see the small stool that Hogwarts appropriated for his feet or the jar of eucalypt, lavender and sandalwood massage oil that appeared on the table beside him. Draco and Pansy did. As Pansy lifted his feet onto the stool, Draco rubbed a small amount of the oil into Tobias’ neck. Tobias visibly melted, humming in pleasure.
“Us three have half of DADA to go and Potions,” Greg informed them, indicating Vince and Millicent as well as himself.
“As you are aware, Hogwarts has been neglected over the past several decades while the vaults have been emptied for useless things such as lining the pockets of the Headmaster and several ministry officials and buying more food than is needed. I have been going through some of the repair requests made by the care taker, Argus Filch, and nothing has been done.”
“Of charge.”
Revenge is a dish best served by Red-Heads
Severus shook himself out of his shock and cast an all-purpose healing charm as he ran to the children that were now a large part of his life. He sighed in relief when he noted that the cuts had fully healed. After a moment of digging, he found his last two vials of blood replenisher potion and slowly feed one to the normally absent-minded girl. He then turned to the female that dared to harm a member of his family and froze.
The phoenix trilled in delight, causing everyone to smile. Lucius looked at Harry shrewdly.
Tobias shook his head.
“Oh they haven’t driven me from the dorms Skoteinos,” Ginny said with a soft smile. “If that were the case, I would have come to you and had you escort me to Professor McGonagall. Luna is the one who has been kicked out of her house and since the girls in my dorm refuse to allow her into ours, I’m going to be moving into the Room of Requirement with her until she finds a new place to sleep at night.”
Tobias raised his head, eyes wide with excitement. “What’s later?”
You're my safest place to hide
Tobias sighed. “You weren’t told about it because no matter what, I’m going to take over from one of them, and Draco the other. It’s been permanent since I was four. It also only comes into effect once both my and Draco’s hearts no longer beat. When I said we were going to take over from them, we are. We will be first and second defenders of the Natural World. One will be night, the other day.” Tobias stretched.
“I know, Sev. But by mild, I meant mild. The next step in nightmares is him killing everyone he cares about while under something like the Imperious Curse. The next one is watching as one of his family kill the rest of the family. After that is having me in Dumbledore’s pay and me only being with him because I was ordered to, followed closely by me leaving him for either Granger or Weasley. The worst on, however is where he remembers everything he went through at the muggles’ house, but it is me who is doing it to him and saying whatever that bastard said to him. Those dreams break my heart because he yells out that he loves me in his sleep, but then I say something that makes him cry. I asked him once what it was that I say and I’ve regretted it ever since.”
There are parts to this  chapter that may, can and probably will be disturbing for some readers. If you or someone close to you has lost a child, then please proceed with caution. To put the rest of you at ease, it is mentioned in a discussion of the far past, it is NOT Tobias who looses the child.
Tobias stretched, covering a yawn. “As they see it, they had the right to despise me participating since one; There was already a Hogwarts champion and two; I was fourteen. They did not think that it was right for the rest of the school that I attended to turn on me while the teachers did sweet F. A. to control it. In the end, it was Neville, Luna, Fred, George and the foreign students who protected me from students I attended classes and lived with.”
Kitten laughed joyously as she worked her magic over her domain. Because Hogwarts had been built on a large magical well, she had obtained a will of her own, and over the years of absorbing the escaped energy of young wizards and witches, she had grown to be a sentient being, with her own magic. At this point in time, she was helping the house-elves decorate the castle in celebration of the heir’s bonding. The kitchen elves were preparing a celebration feast the likes of which hadn’t been seen in 1000 years. After all – it wasn’t every day that the heir bonded while still at the school and she was going to help him celebrate it!
The marked Weasleys jaws dropped, not being able to believe their ears. How dare she!
Tobias’ face changed from a pout to a slightly superior expression. “I admit that I must share you – against my will, though it may be – but I have you forever and later …” he smirked, his metallic green eyes shining with something the rest of The Pack was scared to name. “Later we have a new set of rooms to Christen.”
A small snippet on how much Tobias changed his father and the results of the NEWTs are back ... finally.
“Yes, perfectly designed for a Master’s use – and made from a combination of dementor and grim bone - Perfectly wonderful building materials in their own right but when combined they rival spiders silk in strength, elasticity and weightlessness. That then leads us to the guard.”
“Alpha is going to kill them,” Luna whispered. “They signed their own death warrant. How are we going to keep him calm after he finds out?”
“Hey Bi,” Draco whispered.
Tobias’ eyes narrowed at Lucius as he finished his report to his father. In his arms was a nursing Melody.
The first thing Severus heard after stepping out of the flame was yelling.  Fearing that the recipient of the anger was his godson, Severus hurried to the room Harry was in, only to find a white-faced, wide-eyed Draco waiting in front of the closed door.  Sighing internally in relief, he opened the door – only to stop in the doorway.
The councilmen and women chuckled as they moved towards their assigned tents where the Healers waited with the remaining fifth years.
He slumped in relief as the spell worked, then straightened for the questioning that would prove that the questioner was in Dumbledore’s back pocket.
The twins drew their wands and silently sent spell after spell at the woman until she was hidden in a sparkling putrid yellow cloud that smelt of over-ripe pineapple. A high-pitched scream came from the cloud just before it dispersed to reveal the new and improved Deloris.
He put his hand on the brand and inhaled deeply. “I, Blaise Zabini, remove my protection against physical harm to the person of Hermione Jane Granger in correlation with the oath of one Tobias Regulus Black previously known as Harry James Potter So mote it be, so mote it is done.”
“Yes,” Severus dead-panned. “Very sure. Count yourself lucky Lucius – he didn’t start to cry.”
Tom watched his son as he played with the food before him. “Is anything wrong Tobias?”
“I wish to be known as Tobias Regulas Black please, as Pateras named me Tobias Regulas, and I am the heir of the Black line. The person Harry James Potter no longer exists and never did exist. I am the sole heir to both lines. So mote it be.”
Tom went serious within the blink of an eye. “I am Randal Johns, Tobias’ adopted father, and who might you be?”
A robustly built middle-aged Indian Gentleman swathed in traditional golden brown robes stepped forward, pressed his palms together and bowed slightly, murmuring something not many people managed to catch.
Since then, the blonde had been pacing in ever smaller circles until Millicent, of all people, stood up and forced their Beta into her chair where Greg and Vince pinned him by putting that hand each onto his shoulders. Luna, who was seated on Vincent’s lap, turned and put her feet onto Draco’s lap before softly humming an unfamiliar song.
“I always knew that you were innocent of the prank,” Severus continued, must to Remus’ shock. “The things that got me was that even after that day, you still took Black’s side of everything and the fact that you – of all people – believed I needed to give an oath to not tell anyone your secret. An oath that would have not only drained me of my core, but would have KILLED me if I had even mentioned your name and the word ‘werewolf’ in the same sentence – even to you.”
“Of course,” one twin stated while the other held the curled up black-haired teen to his chest.
Tobias and Draco looked around the tea garden in awe. At that point in time they were alone, with Zog and Booph leaving them there and the Mother and Father not being there. The garden was full of blooming flower buds of all kinds. Roses, iris’, snapdragons, narcissus, pansy and many more brightly coloured plants passed before their eyes as they slowly revolved around.
Silently the two of them followed the two Daemons, careful to not touch the other in case the temptation to mate became too strong for them to fight. Booph and Zog exchanged looks. They could taste the desire the two behind them held for the other, and they could do naught but hope they could contain it until the right time.
“Sorry about the moonflowers, Nona. I didn’t think this would happen to them,” he gave one to each of them, smiling sheepishly. Lucius just smiled at his son-in-law.
Pansy, Millicent and Blaise stood to allow the three adults to sit. Their jaws dropped when Narcissa and Lucius had to lead a glaze-eyed Severus to the seat and force him to sit.
“No promises,” Tobias murmured back, trying to stop his own tears from falling. “But I will try my best to do so.
The Headmaster interrupted his thoughts once more.
Dawn found Tobias and Draco in the garden meditating. Still scared that he would lose his betrothed, Draco made sure to sit so he was touching him. Tobias secretly was touched by this and so let him have his way without argument. He had managed to get Draco to tell him what had occurred the night before after he had apologised for not telling him what he was going to do. His guardian was calling for blood, but he had a better way of punishment for his godfather and his second. No one spoke to his beloved that way and got away with it. No one.
The two Daemon snarled. “If the wolf hadn’t destroyed them three humans, we would have. They were lucky that our vows to the Mother and Father prevented us from killing someone unless we see them do something.”
Tobias answered for him, keeping both eyes on his godfather. “Bambi is a children’s movie a wizard made for the entertainment of muggles. This wizard’s name was Walter Disney – better known as Walt Disney,” Tobias stretched, ignoring the gasps of surprise from The Pack. “Bambi is the story of a fawn … Let’s just say that it is so sweet and cutesy that it would even give Lavender Brown a toothache to watch it.”
Draco stopped and thought about it before he initiated another bruising kiss. “You have half an hour, Bi, and it better be good, or I will take you up against the trunk of this tree.” Draco smirked when Tobias moaned in desire at the threat. It seemed as if his partner liked to hand over control to him in this setting – and he had a kink for slight bondage How utterly … delightful. Coming back to himself, he gave Tobias’ lips a biting kiss and pulled away. “Where do you want me?”
Grapplefang straightened in his chair and his gaze intensified as he looked at the young man who took another few sips from his mug and nibbled on a few of the savoury snacks before him.
Chapter 30
Everyone in the Hall watched horrified as Tobias leapt at the newly released girl, transforming into his wolf form before colliding with her. The younger years suddenly found themselves unable to see or hear anything other than the same woman who had threated Granger humming a gentle song that slowly put them to sleep.
Tobias looked around meeting each member’s eyes. “I will never hit any of you with any of the unforgivable curses. I may hex you, but never with a curse to cause pain. This fact alone is going to make me look weak in front of those of the Death Eaters who do not know me, but they will learn. Neville, I’m warning you now that Bella dearest is going to be in attendance. You are only allowed to harm her if she misbehaves. If that occurs, then try not to damage her too badly. Pateras still will not gift her and the rat too me. And stay away from Cruciatus on her – after my time with her I strongly suspect that she gets off on it.”
Ginny giggled softly and walked over to the Ravenclaw Table to chat to Luna before the two of them met up with the rest of The Pack for a trip into Hogsmeade. She noticed immediately that her blond-haired sister was in one of her moods. Smiling she placed a hand on the other girl’s arm to interrupt her thoughts.
Looking at his young charge, Sev faltered. “I guess you can – but I’ve got to insist on you seeing Poppy first.”
Draco made Tobias look at him and kissed him softly on the forehead. “Thank you.”
“How long?”
Both Draco and Severus blinked in surprise. When had the boy had the time to research ancient bonding rules?
Ateros – Mischievous
Harry laughed. “You are right, Mr Malfoy, but it is a tribute to the deaths of the Harry Potter and Fawkes of the past, and since the new Harry is dedicated to the death of three certain individuals, it also symbolizes what path my newfound life will take, starting with a weaselby, a chipmunk disguised as a witch and a meddlesome, soon-to-be-ex-headmaster of Hogwarts.”
He absent-mindedly reached for the cup of tea that the transfiguration professor handed to him and took a decent mouthful, disregarding the temperature of it.
She sighed and blinked slowly. “I’ve also covered the trial and Blaise marking Granger and how she has lost the ability to read any text because of her failure to report her memories of the Headmaster’s plans. I’ve even told him about my two nights playing with Ronald. I know there is something I’m forgetting …”
Amelia looked at the boys shrewdly. “Your shop is a front, isn’t it?”
“How can you be sure of that?” a pale Bill asked.
“Now, if you will please excuse me, I have a red-head to prepare for. Anyone know of a fire-proof room?” He left with the sound of laughter in his ears and the sight of a pouting blonde.
Tobias lowered his cup and sat back in his chair with a sigh of enjoyment.
“Soon we will be able to do so,” he whispered in response. “I’m glad that you are enjoying yourself and I hope that you enjoy the rest of the night.”
Meeting the Founders and a Potion's lesson
“I see there is a problem. Can I help in any way?” he asked politely with a slight amount of concern.
Both of them looked at Minerva with grins on their faces, “And what can we do for you Minmin?”
Amelia watched Tobias as he held three conversations at once and marvelled at how well he was doing. A glance to her left bought her attention to the amused visage of the goblin envoy that had been in the room with them previously.
She stopped talking as growls and snarls filled the room.
Minerva sighed and turned, returning to one of the seats that were present. “On Sunday I received two owls. One from Tobias’ Father and the other from Augusta Longbottom. Both letters stated that three children were being removed from school grounds – Tobias and Draco for an appointment with their personal Healer who specializes in all things Neo-natal and Neville due to something concerning his parents.”
“You seem to have put most of my students into shock,” Filius stated, eyes twinkling mischievously. “I’ve had to have several of them get calming drats from the Healer’s in the Great Hall or from the lady who has temporarily replaced Poppy.”
Severus shrugged. “Since that day he has kept me and Lucius close, examining and testing the magic in and around the mark, trying to figure out a way to remove it. With Tobias’ help, I have been brand-free since Sunday afternoon.”
Draco laughed softly. His betrothed was turning into quite the paper shuffler. Not only did he organise the paperwork, but he also made recommendations after consulting with all the previous paperwork on the topic. He was that good at it that Sev had handed over all his students essays – both marked and unmarked – so he could make a better lesson plan.
Every eye was on her and she stood straighter.
anniversary. I need to give her something special this year – Something that will show her I love her just as much, if not more, than I did when we were married. Something that means more to her than a forty-five galleon piece of metal. I think Tobias can teach it to me.”
“Bi … Bi … Come on Love, wake up.”
“Enter.”
To everyone’s surprise it was Draco who knelt before him and took his face in his hands to make him look him in the eye. “Bi, I know you don’t want to go. Remember all the things we spoke about earlier today?” Tobias nodded causing Draco to smile, shocking everyone even more. “Then you will remember the promise I made you.” Once more he was answered with a nod.
Draco and Tobias laughed as they made their way back to their special shelter. After a long meditation session, the two of them had gone for a run and were just now returning from a short swim/bathe in the lake. Walking into the clearing they had come to name Peace Haven their noses were assaulted by a sweet scent, making their stomachs rumble.
Severus jolted awake at the sudden flash of heat and light in the room he and Remus were in. He was just thinking of going back to sleep when he heard a soft giggle.
“Thank you for telling me this. I will check with Gringotts later this evening. If I find anything, I will tell you.”
“Of course,” George answered, “The Pack may be over protective to the point of obsession over Tobias, but they are more so over the cub. None of them want anything to happen to the babe, so do you think they will do anything to the one person who can get through the infamous Potter stubbornness?”
Tobias woke up feeling warm and content. He smiled, remembering the events of the night before. To make it even better, he was sleeping with his Drakontas’ arms wrapped tightly around him. He smiled and tried to spin around without waking his husband. Succeeding in doing this, he snuggled into Draco’s chest and allowed his slow, steady heartbeat soothe him back into sleep.
“No one make eye contact with the guardian. She will not be able to kill you, but she is able to make you very sick.” Tobias watched as everyone nodded before turning to the portrait once more.
You're the road back home
“Has my Pet eaten?” he asked as he shrugged out of his robes.
“Come on,” Pansy said, stretching. “Class starts in 30 minutes and we all need to go brush our teeth.”
Everyone in the room winced as the two men nodded sadly. They knew that neither of them could object to the punishment because both of them had gone against their orders to get Draco. All the members in The Pack shrank back when Tobias’ gaze roamed over them. He stopped at Neville’s pale face.
“An elderly man maliciously attacked his daughter in law with a combination of living and non-living transfiguration techniques because she refused to eat something his wife made due to an allergy.”
Tom collapsed into the chair before the fire with a groan, causing the two men with him to chuckle softly.
Laughing, they headed for the table where they assumed the smell was coming from. Draco helped himself to one of the buns they found there while Tobias read the note left with them.
Tobias grinned and nodded. He couldn’t do anything in the library at the moment since he needed a few book ledgers so he could record what books they had. He thought he’d have one for muggle titles and one for wizarding – then he’d also have the Malfoy, Snape, Lupin, Black and Potter library’s to catalogue. He smiled to himself. He loved being busy if it was constructive.
“It’s not a tease if I deliver,” Tobias whispered, causing Draco’s mind to flashback to their bonding night. He released a soft moan.
Harry blinked and looked down, then laughed.  “Do you have anything that will fit me?”
Both Lucius and Severus winced. It seemed as if Tobias was handling it worse than everyone, including Draco, thought he would. The exchanged looks and nodded.
“Sev?”
“Madam Bones,” Narcissa responded before her eyes returned to the out-spoken man. “That … poor excuse of a wizard managed to get on my son-in-law’s bad side rather quickly.”
Frustrations are high for the council and once again, Tobias just wants his pillow, er ... mate.
“These are going to be your best friends,” Harry said with a smirk. “The red one will make you tighter than a virgin. The blue one will engorge your prostate, making it ten times more sensitive than it already is. The yellow one is a new development of mine. It has small metal balls floating throughout it that store and spasmodically releases various strengths of electrical currents into whatever it touches. The good thing about this is that all of them are absorbed – or stick to – through your bowel walls and will only be removed after they stop working.”
“I accept Alpha, thought I didn’t do what I did for a reward.”
Tobias’ eyes widened. “It’s not?”
“You aren’t so smart now are you?” Albus sneered, kicking the boy in the ribs to move him onto his back. “Turns out that without the school and those followers of yours: you are nothing.” The ole man smirked and put his foot on the boy’s lower abdomen where a healing C-section scar would be.
The quiet voices murmured and it wasn’t long before an extra hand was placed on his back.
Severus thought for a moment before nodding. “Alright Skotadi, I’ll do that, but I’m going to be in terrible trouble for doing this by Dumbledore. I can’t afford to lose this job.”
Remus pouted for real this time. “So I’m chopped liver, am I?”
“Go to Lykos, Nonos. Give him your gift. Spend some time with him you both deserve it. Don’t bother going to Pateras. He doesn’t even know that your mark burnt. I’ll put the Slytherin papers in the appropriate place, okay Sir?”
Hani and Tindershank exchanged wide-eyed looks.
Lucius stopped in his tracks and looked at the over-tired woman.
“What, exactly, are you doing?” he asked through clenched teeth.
When Harry woke from his potion-induced sleep, the first thing he did was search his surroundings with his eyes shut.  He felt the movement of a body close to him and his body stiffened in response as he opened his eyes to glare at the person.  He lost the glare as soon as he noticed it wasn’t any of his family.  None of them had Black hair to their shoulders.
“Yes, milord.”
“Professor!” he growled through clenched teeth. “If you don’t stop these infernal pests from forcing food down my throat, I will personally see to it that they are made into leather shoes and that you will be neutered the way muggles do cats without pain-reducing potions and a scalpel that has been rusted for several years, before finding someone who will chain you to the wall via a ring through the head of your dick and slowly pull you backwards until it is long enough for you to FUCK YOURSELF WITH!”
Luna shot a grin at Neville who grinned back, studiously ignoring the movement high above him as Luna duplicated the number of spiders that were in the room and directed them to the semi-enwrapped red head on the ground.
“That,” they moaned, “was more trouble than it was worth.”
Draco chuckled and gestured for the two of them to follow him. “I don’t see why you are complaining Father,” the younger male teased, “you aren’t the one who he gets to try all his concoctions. Believe me, I LONG for the day he craves something as tame as blood ice-cream and chocolate-coated cockroach pieces.”
Remus let out a high pitched yelp as he fell off of the bed and onto a very solid wood floor.
THUMP!
She was interrupted by a body barging past her being closely followed by a worried Draco.
Dinner that night was an ordeal for the seven officials. In one day, they had managed to get through all the teachers – of which three had obliviates that couldn’t be broken without damaging their minds – and the entire first, second and third year populations. Thankfully none of the students had any mind or magic blocks and no injuries that were uncommon for their age. Still, it had been a long day for them – and the following day was set to be even longer.
“Draco on the other hand,” Lucius contributed softly form Minerva’s other side, “has probably been stressing over everything when Tobias is asleep.”
“Mr Black! Your re-sorting?” A voice called from the front of the Hall. Smirking, Tobias sauntered to the front dais and sat on the sorting stool. His soon-to-be ex-head of house shakily lowered the hat onto his head.
“ … Bi?”
Twenty minutes later, Poppy was marching purposefully back to the room she had left the boys in. She had just completed informing their heads of house where they were when the alarm for a patient out of bed sounded. She was about to storm into the room when a snarl stopped her.
Tobias rolled his eyes. “He stormed into the class and gave us a stern talking to about how much he could teach us if we would pay attention to him in his classroom. Then he asked a member of the class three questions. This person got them wrong because he had been wrongly assured that the person in question had been extensively trained in the art of potions. He gave the class instructions to make an easy potion, one of the potions exploded covering a student. Points were lost, the mess cleared and the lesson ended.”
Rowena smiled at him. She knew who he was and she approved, but she wouldn’t say anything to the others just yet.
“Merry Christmas, Love. Arketa went to Riddle Manor and collected all the presents she found from both you and Lord Tom and bought them here. I hope you enjoy your Christmas celebration.” Draco whispered, pleased that his plan had gone off without a hitch … well, that is if you don’t count the whole nearly blowing the wards through sexual activity a hitch.
“I never thought I would see the day that Draco Malfoy would become the proverbial mother hen,” she laughed, watching as Draco hovered over Tobias as he walked through the snow covered grounds.
Lucius smiled gratefully at her and opened the door to the Hall, gesturing her to proceed before him. “Thank you for your time.”
“I am a Potter by blood. I know that and I accept it. I do not wish for the Potters to vanish. I’m not against the Potter and I never have been. I have simply moved on from that area of my life.”
Lucius blinked. “What is with you and the Greek language?”
“Yes, Pontikos?”
Severus blinked. “Um … milord? What do you mean by that?”
Draco walked to his father, who spoke to him in a fast whisper. Everyone was shocked into silence when Draco jumped happily on the spot and took off running in the direction of the Gryffindor table.
Lucius cut his wife’s questions off with a kiss that left them both panting.
Anadochos – godfather
“So mote it be.”
Before anyone could react, Harry had stood and faced his professor. “That is no longer my name, Sir. I would appreciate it if you would desist in using it.” Harry blinked. “Pateras? What IS my name now?”
“Oh Merlin we missed you!” Ginny exclaimed as she flung her arms around first Greg, than Pansy.
Tobias was a little disappointed that he was stopped from doing what he had planned, but he had seen the spark of pleading in Draco’s eye and so had stopped. He was just starting to wonder where his other half had gone to when he felt something cold and slippery hit his back, followed by his husband’s warm hands. He couldn’t stop the moan that came from his mouth as he was straddled – taking the strain off Draco’s wrists.
Tobias smiled. “I agree, after all, I am going to need to take care of myself each pregnancy.”
Grapplefang laughed in amusement. “We don’t take offense at pregnant beings of any species. It’s safer for us that way.”
“Missed you, Nona,” he whispered.
The pole had been thickened so he would need both of his hands to encircle it and the centre had been replaced with a clear material with a ridge only just deep enough to comfortably cradle the mushroomed head of an engorged penis. He felt his mouth water at the thought of watching his gorgeous pet grinding himself along the pole while putting on a show for his Master’s enjoyment.
“Let’s see,” she murmured under her breath, tapping the quill on her lips. “There was the NEWTs … covered that, and the Pack reunion … covered that as well. I’ve also covered the meeting I had with Alpha afterwards and my letter and gift to my chosen mate. He won’t receive it until this morning’s post so I won’t know his answer for another day or two …”
“Do you remember the time we met your two friends for the first time?” her father continued. Hermione nodded again.
“I got kicked out,” Draco glowered at the door that separated him from his husband. “They allowed me in the room with my mate until the birthing channel formed and then the mid-wifevkicked me out saying I was getting him too worked up.”
The two girls exchanged looks.
“We are ready for you now,” the goblin stated. To the Patil trio’s surprise, the elderly goblin turned to Tobias and gave a shallow bow. “Thank you for allowing us time to prepare.”
“You bet your left testicle, they’re going to be punished!” a hoarse voice croaked. “What say you, Master Malfoy? Do you wish to bond with a Potter over shared torture techniques?” In the silence that prevailed, Severus got Harry to drink one of the potions.
Narcissa laughed and summoned some books over to her. “Oh, yes, plenty of time. Now then, we are going to need catering, a cake, and a celebrant – Do you want to hold it here at the Manor or somewhere else? We need decorations ...”
Theodore blushed at being caught but stood his ground. “I do,” he admitted, “but I am also worried about Alpha,” he admitted. “He looks so … fragile.”
You are just annoyed at the fact that they beat you by bluffing in the last game of the morning,” Draco teased, loving the sight of the healthy flush on his husband’s cheeks.
“That is why Fabien and Gideon Prewitt were our top Aurors, and why they always were partnered together. When question a twin under a spell or with truth serum, we need to douse both of them because their magic splits it between the two of the evenly, making it useless if done incorrectly.” Amelia snorted. “I agree with Fred.”
Tobias smirked in pleasure. “As the questioner at a trial concerning an adult in direct contact with one or more minors where the minors are called upon as witnesses, all minors are to be asked the same set of question’s per rule 33 Section C Paragraph 4 lines 3-8. So either do your job properly or step down and allow someone who can do it take over … like a flobberworm.”
“Agreed,” Luna hummed, making everyone turn to stare at her. “What? Even though neither of them is here, we know they would agree with it since they were the ones who suggested it to begin with.”
Half-way through their meal, Draco excused himself, stood, handed their daughter to her mother and headed to the area where the lavatory was hidden. After another few mouthfuls, Tobias found himself unable to move due to the ropes that had sprung up and tied him to his chair. Looking up, he glared at the person before him, finding a stranger with Draco’s face holding his screaming, yet silenced, daughter.
Tobias smiled lovingly. “I think it is a wonderful idea: Just as long as there is no alcohol.”
“He gave me a dislocated shoulder, bruised kidneys, a pulled muscle in my lower back and various pounded areas. He didn’t break anything and I don’t need any extra healing with my body being so used to it. Do you mind helping me with the shoulder though?”
Tobias spent the next evening in the company of his father and godparents. He was stunned when Severus gave him the results of his test. He had passed with a higher score then had been faked for him.
Severus nodded. “Just think,” he answered, just as soft. “He’s going to be your son-in-law.” Severus exited from the Snake Pit.
On Remi’s other side, with an arm around the pregnant male’s waist, and in front of Draco was a beautiful young woman who looked identical to her Grandma Lily but with one hazel eye and one grey-green eye. She was their middle child and had been named Mary-Lou; a name that Tobias had  allowed Tom to come up with to honour their great grandma Merope.
Tobias gave him a watery smile and cuddled into Draco’s chest. Draco smiled, and getting an idea, picked Tobias up bridal style and carried him to the sun lounge, where he sat, cradling him in his lap.
The other ways that this butt plug was different were numerous. The main points were, however, that it was made of self-healing rubber so Harry could do whatever he wished to the inside of it and it would heal after a couple of hours, if not day. It had a one-way valve on the very top of it and it had a metal tube inside of it that acted like the pull-tab of a pin ball machine. To hold the metal tube steady while it was in use, the metal tubing had been welded onto short spokes of metal that came from the ring it was attached to. This set up also prevented the plug from being pushed in too far when Harry was using this special feature.
“Did ... Did you want to come for a walk with me tonight at midnight? I’ve never seen the gardens here, and I’d love to see them under the moon with you, just like the first date we had at Hogwarts.”
Looking at the time, he picked up a book, kissed his partner softly and headed towards his lab.
Ron, who had been stewing in his anger and jealously of his ex-best friend, stormed over to the three shell-shocked men standing in the middle of the hall. “WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO HIM YOU DARK, EVIL FERRET! Ron shouted, putting his wand against Draco’s throat. “I know you did something to him you death eater sympathizer!” Ron’s face now clashed with his hair, as it had turned purple with rage.
“I’m not in Mungo’s,” he admitted. “I’m working in Japan at the moment in one of their clinics. I’m specialising in addictions – Potions, muggle drugs, alcohol, and stimulants; anything that affects the mind.”
“What do we do now?” Ginny asked tiredly. “Since we’ve finished, there doesn’t seem to be much sense in us staying here till the end of the time – unless you have something for us to do.”
By the time Tobias had completed his strip show Draco was hard and aching. Seeing this, Tobias gave a half-smirk and sauntered over to the blonde. Moving slowly, he placed his lips onto Draco’s and started a slow, teasing kiss that promised everything, but gave nothing.
Lucius raised his eyebrow tauntingly, “because I’m your father and I’m better than you are at spells?”
Minerva’s and Severus’ heads spun to look at the twins who smirked.
“Why did you ask for a mind scan?”
Tobias pouted sleepily. “‘M not cute.”
Tobias’ eyes changed to an intense deep burgundy. With a wave of his hand, he sent a naked Ron hanging upside down from a beam situated in the centre of the owlery. A knife appeared in Tobias’ hand. Almost absent-mindedly, he placed the tip of the blade into his mouth and sucked it.
Tobias sat at his desk, an owl feather quill in his hand. Before him was a list of potions that were safe enough for him to make for his N.E.W.Ts. He read through the short list and circled one. Shaking his head, he reached for another sheet of parchment and started to write.
Tobias blinked, trying to clear the shadows from his eyes and gasped at the scene before him. The room they were in was built into the cliff face that surrounded the Mother’s Garden. The front of the room opened out into the outer garden where the bed they were to share was protected from the elements by a glass awning with retractable sides.
Severus’ normally bright black eyes were a dull, dusty grey. His skin was loose with dehydration and had the colouration of sour milk and he looked as though he had lost an unhealthy amount on weight in a short period of time – weight he hadn’t had to spare in the first place.
“This is insane,” Ginny muttered as she watched everyone in the room squabbling over who goes where and going into hysterics at the thought of having a Healer’s appointment.
Bill nodded, watching his younger brother closely.
“Minerva,” he nodded in greeting as he took the seat beside her. “How long were you at Mungo’s?
,” Albus spat out as he slowly increased the pressure on what he believed was the weakest part of his victims body, “and as soon as I’ve damaged you enough, I will take your daughter away and put her somewhere not one of the people close to you will be able to find her.”
“Locks itself up and then.”
He and Lucius removed the metal and at almost the same time, Remus administered the potion while Severus and Lucius removed the clothing from the now silent boy on the bed.
“I see you have found the surprise I was working on, Nonos. Is it acceptable? Or do you need for the light to be brighter?” Without thinking, Severus nodded and a bright flame appeared around Tobias, causing all eyes to be drawn to him, and therefore the floor. No one could hold back the gasps that escaped them.
Ok peeps! Merry Christmas and all that XD From today I will be updating weekly rather then daily due to me needing to write and type up the chapters before hand. Enjoy!
“If there is not a good reason for your being here disturbing us this early in the morning, then I will personally strip the skin from your bodies – layer by painful layer,” Draco muttered sleepily.
Grapplefang watched as the two red-headed males left after conferring with their superior. When the exhausted teen returned to his seat, he smiled, not showing his teeth as a sign of respect.
Theo smacked his forehead with his palm. “How could I be so stupid? Of course he was talking about the Founders.”
“Well, there are eight family titles that we hold between us Draco,” he said slowly. “I think it is time that we bring a few of them out of the shadows.”
She turned her eyes back to the book she had in her hand, fingers going white with how tightly she was grasping it. When she borrowed it, she was doing it to research like McGonagall had told her too. That was when she had still believed that her Head of House was helping her to gain her friendship with Harry back so everything could go back to the way it was. It wasn’t until she revealed the mark on her neck that she realised that she was wrong in believing her Transfiguration professor wanted to help her.
An ugly grin formed on her lip as she started writing down her plans, not suspecting that far away in the heart of London, two red-headed demons were reading her every word with one of their newest inventions.
“Oh I’d believe it,” Amelia stated, glancing at the papers once more. “You’ve also been bitten by a werewolf?”
Lucius paled. “You - you wouldn’t do that would you?”
Madam Greengrass nodded. “Do you know if anyone is thinking of continuing their exams?”
“Mr Potter, do try to watch where you are going. After all, you are not above anyone else and we wouldn’t want you to find yourself in Azkaban now, would we?” a familiar girlish voice announced.
Always yours,
“It appears you missed the memo,” Tobias snarled, “It’s Tobias Regulas Malfoy-Black and you are the very annoying Holie-shorts.”
“I do not think you should come anywhere near him until he asks for your presence. I’d rather he die then have him beholden to someone who thinks more of himself and his wants then the person they are supposed to love with all their hearts.” Severus stormed out of the library, leaving a scared, hurt and very distraught Draco behind.
Set a man to watch all night,
“Ok, Tobias. What is all this animalistic behaviour about? You haven’t been bitten, have you?”
Both girls had burst into hysterical tears when they had been told, worried about how their family would react to the news, let alone their partners. Once it was proven that both girls had consented to the act that had resulted in their current state, Amelia had told them as nicely but as firmly as she could to stop the hysterics; if they didn’t want this to happen then they shouldn’t have done the activity until after they had signed their betrothal contracts, or better still, were bonded.
“I think I’m going to throw up,” two distinct voices sneered.
“Just a dream. It was just a dream,” he murmured to himself over and over as he tried calming himself down. When he was calm, he grinned. Today was the day he was going to see his sister get what she deserved. He got out of bed humming happily as he headed to the showers, never noticing the pair of eyes watching him from between almost closed curtains.
These buns are safe for you to eat. They have been made with sheep’s milk and applesauce instead of egg. They are also made fresh today. The house-elf who gave them to us said they were named “Cinnamon and Pecan butterscotch buns’ and were a treat for the two of you since you didn’t eat dessert last night. The pitcher holds the herbed water we Centaurs drink on a morning. If you wish it we will allow you to have access to it in the castle, as long as it is only the two of you who drink it. Remember to drink your potion as well. I will not be responsible if you Godfather were to find out.
The walked up and handed in their papers for the last time. The lady who was collecting the papers marked them off in wide-eyed wonder.
“What was so important that you weren’t in bed at all last night?
The wolf before him nodded.
Lord Achelandra Patil
Tobias stood in once spot until a fae-light fell on him and a song with a bouncy tune started to play. He heard Draco’s laughter as he danced around the area before the bed. The laughter stopped, however, when Tobias seated himself on Draco’s lap, his hips still gyrating to the beat of the music.
Identical blue eyes met over the enchanted object and both nodded. One copied the information down in neat hand writing that few would expect of him, while the other wrote a letter, duplicated it and sent it to where it had to go, each holding the same warning.
Chapter 51
Lucius just pointed a shaking hand towards the room claimed by his son and The Pack – including Severus - ran to see what was wrong.
“Are there any changes you wish to make to the contract boundaries?” Grapplehank asked as he took over for his grandson.
“McGonagall sent a letter to us,” Tobias murmured sleepily. “We’ve been excused from morning classes to go shopping for the chairs that I’ve been told that I need. Algie decided to also owl McGonagall the results and his instructions. She is coming to collect us at around nine-ish.”
“It is,” Amelia stated, shuddering slightly as she remembered her one face-to-face meeting with the insane man in the first war.
Harry had broken off panting in a rage that burnt deeply.  He looked up and noticed he was starting to smoulder.  He had quickly reduced his emotion level to nothing.  Standing, he’d left the room, only to return with a pensieve.  He had filled it with the memories he had and of what he’d found out and how. When Remus, Severus, Draco, Lucius and Voldemort had returned, they had found Harry curled up on the seat, fast asleep.
Zog stretched and his mottled green and brown wings spread out behind him with a soft crackling of muscle and tendon. “The bond mark changes for the both of them. During the day, they have my claws. During the night, they have Booph’s. Our claws are there because we are the protectors - I’m on duty during the day and Booph on duty at night.
Fred Weasley – Ateria [Mischief] – Espionage Specialist
Luna gave a small flirtatious grin and vanished through the door. Neville chuckled softly and followed, knowing exactly where the blonde girl was heading.
“Then tell them that,” Minerva said. “Tell them exactly what happened and how you reacted to it and what you put up with for three weeks. Be one hundred percent brutally honest.”
“Good,” Tobias snapped, still glaring at the men around Severus. “Then maybe what happened to me at the hands of the Ministry at the beginning of last year won’t happen to someone else.”
Severus nodded. “What has been wrong with you today? You’ve been abnormally quiet and, dare I say it, tame.”
She braced herself as she felt another memory surface. It was one of her, Harry and Ron from the previous year. For the first time in months, Harry hadn’t had a detention with Umbridge over the weekend and the three of them had taken a food basket out to the lake for a picnic. It had been a day of fun, of laughter, of kinship. It had been the first time that Harry had told her and Ron how much they meant to him. For the first time he had an honest, open face not at all clouded with secrets or uncertainty. She smiled softly at the memory before it changed to another one.
Luna nodded and rose. “Let’s go met them at the gate.”
“I will, Sir,” Neville said without hesitation. “I couldn’t in good conscience keep these two ladies apart when I have the solution to make their stay more comfortable and I would be much more comfortable away from Ron Weasley. He never was as good a friend to me as Harry … Sorry, as Tobias was and I miss talking to him.”
“What is so funny, Gios?” Voldemort asked, slightly curious.
“And you are Lord Voldemort, the Darkest Dark Lord England has produced.”
Draco beamed at him and gently teased Tobias into their first French kiss as a bounded couple.
“You are the gentleman who hung your nephew out of the top window of a tower, aren’t you?”
“Why is it,” George asked with a scowl, “that we seem to attract all the incompetent, greedy, useless and annoying Healers in the area?”
“Neville. I want to thank you for your attempt at protecting me, even against Drakontas – however, you should have waited till you got the full story. My Dragon was upset at me because in preparing for last night’s ritual, I needed to refrain from sharing a bed with any living being – that is partners, children, pets and even plants. Neither he nor I were happy with it, but at least I knew why I was doing it. Draco did not.”
The twins exchanged doomed expressions and nodded, sealing their fates.
“Lawd Mwfoi,” the man drawled with a nod of his head. “Yer sayd some’in ‘bout a nu critter t’ work ma fields?”
You're the only truth I know
Growling menacingly, he snatched the letter that floated over to him when it reached his area of space. Reading it through, he grimaced. Tobias was not impressed with him going back on his word without contacting him first. His punishment was the harshest one that could ever pass Tobias’ lips. Draco growled again and stormed out of the room, his rage urging him to find that idiotic father of his and make him suffer just as much as he was suffering himself. He had just closed his door when he saw Lucius coming up the hallway towards him.
His thoughts were disrupted when Draco sucked his earlobe into his mouth and bit it softly, showing his dominance over his husband. Tobias whimpered softly and lifted his chin, causing Draco’s eyes to flare in possession. When he felt Draco mark a path from his earlobe to his neck, he moaned softly, gripping his hands together so he wouldn’t touch the image of sex-personified on top of him. When Draco sucked hard on the pulse-point at the base of his throat, however, his restraint broke and he buried his hands into the silken strands of hair.
Leaning in, they shared their second kiss of their relationship, and this one was no less sweet, no less tender than the one they had shared the night before. They also did not hear everyone leave, mumbling about cavities rather than stay and watch something that was obviously a private moment.
“Lucius,” the creature called out in relief, ignoring the boy beside him. “You have to reverse whatever those horrid kretins did to me! It’s an outrage!”
By the time the evening meal had come around, every Pack member was wearing a self-satisfied smile. They had managed to get a good few solid hours in the library doing the research they had been assigned and they grinned at each other when they saw a smug-looking Umbridge seated between an annoyed Lucius and a thoughtful Lord Patil.
Meetings and explainations
Tom looked up in annoyance when the doors to his library opened, only to have his heart – yes he did have one, thank you very much – leap into his mouth as he saw Severus enter.
“Well? What are you still doing here?”
He gently un-hooked Draco from the table and carried him into the bathroom attached to the room. Once he had the blonde undressed and in the hot water of the bath, he woke him up with an enervate.
His eyes flew open when a sharp smack and a yelp of pain filled the room.
“He is currently asleep in our bed in the Founder’s Room and, depending on how Sev goes in his meeting, he should be there for a week. For those of you who were wondering, no he hasn’t been hexed, poisoned, hit with a wayward spell or taken a potion. It turns out that he has possibly inherited one of his many great grandsire’s abilities. We think that he may be a Natural Bearer like Salazar Slytherin. The odds that he has this trait are exceedingly high, as he is currently showing all the symptoms of the beginnings of a Bearer with child. Sev is talking to my parents and our Lord about getting a healer we can trust into the Castle, or getting Tobias out.”
“What is?” George asked wincing as a different voice came from his mouth.
“Neogennito!” a sharp, dark voice called, snapping the beast’s attention from the boy beneath him. “Release him!”
Tobias pouted and looked at Draco with teary eyes. “You think I’m fat, don’t you?”
“Did you learn that while looking for a way to bribe them?” Ron sneered, not noticing the potions master leaning on the door frame, seemingly relaxed.
She sniffed slightly. She could be ordered around by her bond-master’s house-elves and could do nothing about it. She was nothing more than a toy now – one that had less status than even a common muggle. She could only hope that her bond-master didn’t wish to make her a pleasure toy for his enjoyment. If he did, then she would be powerless against him.
“Yes, my boy. I am curious as to the reason to the change I your attitude, and to why you have forgone your friendships with Miss Granger and Mr Weasley. You all used to be so close.”
“Now that is over,” Amelia stated, discretely patting the Malfoy Lord on the shoulder as she passed him on her way to get another cu of tea, “shall we do as suggested?”
Draco looked at Tobias sternly. “I hope you didn’t do all of that without having a break.”
“I am going to kill him,” Draco stated as calmly as he could to his mother. “Then I am going to bring him back and kill him again. I will do this over and over until I have killed all of the stupidity out of his brain, then I will kill him again, remove his head and stick it into a globe. Due to his dragging me into the library and sticking me to a seat with a sticking charm after he heard me tell my PRGENANT HUSBAND that I would be with him soon. I now have been ordered by him that if I want to see him again before the birth of HIS – not OUR, but HIS child, I am not allowed to go searching for him and then he signed the gods be trice damned letter with a fucking blood quill so even if he didn’t mean it, I still lose my family if I go looking for him! So I decided to do the next best thing and search for my idiot of a Father so that when he eventually does come back to me, I can give him the head of the fuck head that made me late in the first place to display in a silver plated globe!”
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT
“Sleep now,” Luna murmured. “How long?” Six hours?”
“Very well Lucius,” Minerva stated in amusement, “If you insist.”
Draco smirked as his husband arched into him, but he lost the smirk and his eyes widened when he heard the tears in Tobias’ voice as he pleaded. He gently ran his hands up Tobias’ sides.
“I know what you mean,” Ariandra stated, rubbing her temples gently. “So much damage has been done to these children alone. How many more had been affected by Dumbledore before now?”
“Thank you. Now, everyone shoo. I’ve important business to attend to.”
Fred and George both paled. “Forgive us, wondrous Lady. Never again shall those cursed names pass our lips!”
When the two of them appeared in the Chamber, George quickly placed the scroll, as well as a few other bits and bobs, into the tray Tobias had set up for important paperwork. With a nod, the two of them thanked kitten and walked into the sitting room.
Tobias nodded. “That is a good idea. When you wake up in the morning, I would like everyone to come down to the Chamber for breakfast. This goes for both days since we may not all be there together physically, but we can give you our encouragement before you go. I’ll tell Minnie and Flitwick that you will be ‘eating in the kitchen’ tomorrow morning. And no fighting. I don’t want anyone to cry at our first family meal.”
Plans are made, new bonds of friendships begun and a new name is given for a fresh start in a new life.
“Oh Deloris, why would I want to do that?” Lucius purred as Draco ignored the centaur and set up the small box he had received from Kyria. “After all, you were planning on selling my Grandchild to some unknown man for your own personal gain. Who knows what that child would have gone through had it happened?”
Charlie Weasley – Hemerotes [Tamer] – Beast Speaker
Draco and Tobias smiled at each other as they sipped the wine and nibbled on fruit, goat’s cheese and biscuits in a garden full of night blooming flowers. The sweet smelling air made both young men slightly giddy while the waning moon hovered above them.
Draco smirked as he noticed his husband’s eyes glaze over in thought. He knew that if he wanted to get him, he needed to act now. Without thinking, he grabbed Tobias, yanked him around and pushed him up against the trunk of the Willow tree. He pinned him there with his body and raised his husband’s hands above his head and held them there with his own. He pushed his groin into the one before his, causing Tobias to moan out loud and push back, tilting his head back until it was resting on the tree behind him.
“You, my Love,” Draco stated, looking deeply into his husband’s eyes, “are a tease.”
“Now, now, you three don’t look at me like that. Is it my fault that you didn’t spell yourselves, or each other, against dust? You all knew we were going to the Chamber and that no one has been there since my second year. You should have used your heads like the Slytherin’s you’re supposed to be instead of following trustingly like Hufflepuffs!” The three adults blushed in embarrassment.
“Then you‘ll also remember what it was said to you after we arrived back home?” She nodded again.
“It’s true! Draco, it’s true. He adopted me. I didn’t think that h-he would want to.” He sounded slightly shocked and awed – like he’d been expecting it to have all been a joke. Draco walked towards him slowly, thinking to place a hand on Tobias’ shoulder when the boy in question leapt towards him and engulfed him in a tight hug and bounced on the balls of his feet chanting, “I got a family, I got a family!”
Harry almost chocked on his tongue as something under the skirt glinted when the light hit it as Draco’s hips gyrated as he seemed to almost ride the pole he was attached to.
“Is that true Lucius?” Narcissa asked, icily, crossing her arms and hiding the still form of Tobias as she moved towards her husband.
“Yes Grandmother, I am well. How are you?”
“It’s the same story for the females, I’m afraid. Hermione has been looking for the name, history, recipe and contaminants of the blood nutrient potion you’re taking. She wants to know why you have to take it and finds it suspicious that you drink it with as much relish as you do. She doesn’t believe that what she, Ron and the Old Goat made and forced you into over the summer created the need.”
Amelia followed the silent blonde Lord deeper into the dungeons then she had ever been. After several more silent minutes, Amelia stopped just in time to prevent herself from running into Lucius’ back.
“It’s alright, Harry,” Draco gasped in pain and regret. “You tore up your favourite shirt for me?”
Draco started at him in shock and surprise.  Severus swore and marched to Lucius’ study door, a dazed Draco following him.  Once there, he rapped sharply on the door and pushed it forcefully open.
Theo looked at the two of them with a slight frown. “Alpha? Just so they understand, I think you should show them.”
“TOBIAS REGULAS BLACK! YOU WILL COME HERE IMMEDIETLY!” Remus growled from the front doors of Hogwarts when the Slytherins arrived for breakfast. Tobias sighed.
Severus smiled with sardonic grimness. “He had been very generous with his hexes and curses that day and Randal found me on his doorstep, unable to stand, talk or stop shaking. He wheedled the entire story from me over a week and sent a letter to Dumbledore telling him where I was and what shape I was in. He got a reply that I never got to see, but it caused him to destroy everything in his office in an attempt to control his anger.”
Lucius looked at Severus. “I can’t see him as a sub, Sev. Not after that dressing down.”
“Go and eat,” the man told the group. “I’ll take him back with me to my rooms. You won’t be much good for him if you start missing meals as well,” he stated calmly as Draco opened his mouth.
“Is everything okay?” Minerva asked him softly. The students that had arrived after breakfast had already packed up and left for either their common room, the library or to one of the pre-approved courtyards to catch up with their friends or to continue their work.
“Good evening Madam Bones, Father.”
“I’m glad I did too. I’m hoping that I’m not like this for long; I don’t like getting weepy, angry or motherly over every small thing. I also hate that it was Severus who coped it first. It wasn’t fair on him, nor on you. I’m sorry.”
Tobias nodded, feeling safe in the arms of his father, while Severus downed the scotch Lucius poured for him. Tobias yawned, but now all three older men could see the fear in his eyes – not that any of them blamed him.
No one saw Tobias after that until halfway through dinner that night. Draco felt his jaw drop as he watched his betrothed glide into the Hall, his hair, skin and clothing making his eyes look deep and hypnotic. All movement stopped as he walked to the Slytherin table and placed a gentle, almost loving, kiss on Draco’s head before sitting and taking a small amount of a salad containing chicken, cashews, and rocket. Draco and Severus noticed that he didn’t eat much of it.
“Drakkie!” she squealed, running towards him after seeing him seated in the common room. Seeing the startled look on Draco’s face, Tobias – whom Pansy had not seen as he was seated in shadow, leapt between his intended and the squealing female. Pansy screamed when she came face-to-face with an enraged miniature wyvern.
My safest place to hide
“Be-fore I can re-react, Dumbles points his wand at m-me and h-hits m-me with t-two sp-ells. O-one to p-prevent su-suicide and the other to pr-prevent D-Dementors from k-illing me or driving me ins-sane. H-he b-brings in the A-Aurors a-and they arrest m-me for mu-murder. I g-get sent t-to A-Azkaban w-without a trial wh-where I-I’m forced to relive my parent’s death, Sirius falling through the veil, this Summer at the Dursley’s, the betrayal of my ‘friends, my killing P-Pateras an-and Dumbles k-killing my Draco.”
“You tried killing my adopted father to steal his identity and you killed many innocent people while poisoning the minds of many more: All because of jealousy,” Tobias continued, spitting the last word making all who knew his history with muggle relatives flinch.
The sound of chatter bought his attention to the stairs leading to the dungeons. There, walking up the stairs were the missing students and some of their parents.
“What you did wasn’t just a prank that went wrong, love. You admitted to us with your own mouth that all the spells you cast were the darkest spells you could get without being recognised as a full dark witch or wizard. The punishment for something less than what you’ve done here in our world would be tried and in prison with no hope of parole.”
Blaise Zabini – Arpakitiko [Predator] – Weapon’s Specialist
“Don’t you just love Veritaserum?” Everyone fell silent and looked at him. “What?” he asked defensively. “It was the only thing I could keep down.”  This instantly sobered everyone up.
The sound of a door opening bought all three men’s eyes to the object of their thoughts. Tobias dropped the stack of books he was holding when Tom drew him into an enveloping hug, murmuring ‘thank you’ over and over. Sev and Lucius chuckled at the caught-in-the-headlights look on their godson’s face. Both of them were surprised when their friend had launched himself at his son, but the boy’s reaction was just priceless!
“Then why are you doing the work and not them?” Severus asked with a hint of amusement.
Seated on the very end of the group where the conversation could only just be heard, Deloris Umbridge took notes, scowling at the conversation.
Tobias sighed and pushed his plate away from him. “I don’t really feel like eating anything here. Do we have any melon? Or grapes? Mango sounds good too …”
“Yes, Neogennito?” he asked quietly.
You're my safest place to hide
“When the man’s finished, Vernon comes in and swears because his money maker is dead. Then he g-gets a kn-knife a-and h-he b-but-chers him into sm-all pieces. H-He gives them to M-Mrs Figg as f-food for her cats. Then he c-comes back a-and l-laughs at m-me b-because he g-got rid of the o-one person I l-love m-more than anything.”
The three men had made their way to Gringotts, where a rather large, pink body crashed into them.
He growled deep in his throat, but then grinned. “Draco and I are going to bond over his torture. Aren’t we Draco?”
Ron didn’t notice the eyes shutting or the return of the hands. His mind was so taken by fear of what would happen to him next that he didn’t even register that he was now sliding faster towards the river.
“No – the fruit salad and yoghurt on a different plate. I may be pregnant, but I’m not craving yet!”
“Before you leave, Minerva,” Amelia stated “Do you mind explaining a few things to me?”
The students walked into the Great Hall with gob-smacked expressions on their faces. Never before had it looked so magnificent. The walls were sparkling with fine glitter and housed a magical breed of Ivy that changed the colours of its leaves. The Head table had been moved forward on its dais and had been covered with a deep purple tablecloth and white cutlery. Behind the Head table was a table for two on another slight platform. This table was covered in a white cloth with cutlery made of the purest of crystal. Behind this table was the crest of Hogwarts. The house tables were set in a similar fashion as the other two tables. Gryffindor table with a burgundy cloth and gold cutlery, Ravenclaw with a royal blue cloth and bronze cutlery, Hufflepuff a yellow cloth and black cutlery and Slytherin with a deep emerald cloth and silver cutlery.
“Getting back to the issue we bought you here for,” Lady Ariandra said with a soft cough. “Can you tell us who commissioned the product you used to get this information?”
Dynamo – Strength
“I’m not interested in his sex life, sweetie,” Narcissa said, her voice holding the same consistency and sweetness of syrup, making the two elder men wince. “I am interested to know if my son-in-law is going to use my son’s weaknesses against him in the bedroom – and the best way for me to punish him if I find out that he has done so.”
“We accept,” Pansy confirmed. “I was starting to feel as though I would cast an unforgivable at someone to keep myself from going insane!”
“You probably have, but not realised it,” Minerva interrupted. “He is very well-known around Europe.”
While George was talking, Lord Patil’s glare was getting darker and darker as he looked at his oldest daughter. “It this true Pavarti?” he asked. When no answer came forth but her head lowered so he couldn’t see her face, he grit his teeth. He turned back to the conversation when Tobias spoke.
“Just us,” Tobias yawned, leaning on the older man. “You can get The Pack ready Drakontas. I’m going back to sleep.”
The goblin released a sound that made the hair on the back of everyone’s neck stand on end and the wizards and witches realised that the elderly being was laughing in shocked amusement.
As he talked, his eyes glowed a deep AK green, scaring all in the room. He turned his gaze on Voldemort.
Tobias stood up and stretched to his full height. “Well, I guess this is goodbye for now.” He looked towards his pack. “We’ll see you at King’s Cross, same time, same place – the password is Phoenix Flame and touch the green flame.” He looked at the four Weasley men. “When it is time for a meeting, Thanatos will be there to flame you in.” He bowed to Severus. “We will see you at Hogwarts.” He hugged Remus, Lucius and Narcissa. “We’ll see you next time we are home.” He turned to his father. “Goodbye, Pateras. We’ll speak to you soon – try to convince Fudge that the sooner we get our NEWTs, the sooner you can ‘kill’ me without him getting the backlash of not doing anything to prepare me.”
Tobias poked at his food with a sad look on his face. Damn his Pack and their getting his hopes up for this meal. He really wanted that yummy sounding soup and while the stuff before him both looked and smelt appetizing, he was disappointed in it. A hand landed on his shoulder and he raised his head to look at them with sad eyes.
Once the door had been closed, locked and set with a hex for any who tried opening it, Tobias collapsed into the seat behind him and rubbed his head. “Where they always that much of a nightmare?” he asked from within his hands. Draco only smirked and handed over a headache potion, which Tobias downed without question.
Draco looked deep into his intended’s eyes. “If Remus hadn’t of killed your family, your Uncle still would have died. The magic that stops the trauma would still have punished him. The punishment for one family member raping another is always death.” Draco cuddled closer to him before whispering, “But the magic would not have had a chance to kill him. Do you know why?”

Draco stood in the centre of the garden fidgeting slightly. His outfit set off his hair and eyes. His stomach was jittery and he couldn’t wait until he could see his fiancé again. A small commotion at the door drew his eyes and his heart jumped when he caught sight of his beloved’s father and he struggled to bring liquid to his now dry mouth.
“Probably because when the same thing happened to me at age eleven, twelve, fourteen and fifteen, it was ignored by everyone,” Tobias said outright. “I needed to lean on Neville, Ginny and the twins for strength while the rest of the school – including most of the teachers – treated me as a pariah. It was the behaviour of the school as a whole that caused the schools from France and Belgium to decline further involvement with Hogwarts.”
