“Nothing,” said Harry. “It quite simply allows you to calm down and be more in control of your emotions. A Seer is a natural Occlumens, which means that no one can get anything from their mind as it’s protected by their magic. It’s all very complicated, but once you hit a certain mental state, it all becomes very clear.”
“NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM IS MINE TO KILL!” roared Tom, Neville’s wand pointing lazily towards the statue. “I, Lord Voldemort, will be the one to kill Longbottom, not some meddlesome actor.”
“Enough, Draco go get your extra set of robes and then lie on top of Harry and cuddle him!” Pansy snapped.
“Wait, where’s Narcissa?” asked Harry, glancing around for her. “Don’t tell me you came down here alone?”
“I did,” said Severus. “People praised me for that spell as it allowed parents to teach their children to dodge different looking spells without harming them. Eventually I changed it to leave a stain on the clothes, which can be vanished, instead of ticking.”
“Enough, Mr. Reed,” scowled Professor Snape. “That event was more traumatizing for us than you. Now you won’t be an outcast over five points, but more like fifty or above.”
“Yeah, I’m sorry about that. Thank you for collecting me though,” said Harry with a wide smile, his eyes filling with happiness. Deep-down he did wonder why it wasn’t his mother or father who came to his aid and help him, instead it was Lucius and Narcissa that helped him and it did hurt a little bit. “And I slept well, thank you for asking.”
Everything was going perfectly fine until he hit a proverbial wall that could not be scaled. He couldn’t even get a grip, despite the obvious areas that he could grip. His fingers would just slip before his feet were off the ground. He tried, and tried, and tried, and nothing worked. He tried using his feet, trying covering his hands with grass and leaves. Nothing worked.
Harry shook his head, telling him that he didn’t need help. He was treated like such a frail person, he just simply bit his lip to hard and broke the skin, nothing new. He slid his finger to his lip and flicked away the trail of blood easily.
Harry allowed plenty of various things to flicker through his mind on what the surprise could be, ranging from a new potions lab to a new broom. He did hold the snort and the sigh that wanted to escape at the sheer dumb thought that he would receive anything that extravagant for no reason. “I’m not sure, mother,” he said, a smile appearing on his face. “Perhaps it would be better if you just told me.”
Gilderoy Lockhart didn’t look put out at all. “We can just include the father son fight in my article,” he said happily, his charming smile didn’t waver.
rare today. Both Salazar and I will be teaching you a few things considering something is going to be happening soon and we want you ready.”
Draco gently caressed Harry’s cheek, “don’t worry Harry, mother and father won’t think any less of you, everyone does it, except me, I had the more embarrassing option!”
She mentally debated about telling Narcissa but decided against it. Harry wouldn’t mind, but she assumed he wasn’t embarrassed about it, especially with the way he glared at anyone who looked at him funny.
He found it effortless, his eyes snapping between each orb within seconds, his wand following instantly. Even when multiple orbs appeared, they were dealt with swiftly. Even when two orbs appeared on opposites in rapid succession, one after another, he easily hit them all. His sheer ruthless aggression allowed him to control the little game, decimating anything that appeared, no matter when and where.
“Because I don’t,” said Harry, staring at the boy with an unamused expression. “I got around the Trace on my own. I don’t need some fabricated story about a spell hidden on the shelves.”
Harry stared at his mother for the briefest of moments before he nodded. He wanted to laugh at the barb at James, even when said man didn’t bother to defend his pride and etiquette, which was actually decent when warranted, not that he would ever admit that out loud. He decided that it was best if he just sat silent and allowed his mother to explain ‘what’s going on’ as she put it.
He glanced towards Draco, intent on claiming his friend as his dancing partner, which would remove all hassle of finding someone else, and frowned when he caught sight of his friend shifting towards Goyle. He tilted his head, a frown on his face.
The gravel was crunching under Harry’s feet which cause a slight smirk to land on his face. He was trying to make as much noise as possible and leave his shoeprint in the gravel, that way people would know that he was here. He was aware that his mum was looking at him with an exasperated expression, yet a slight trace of amusement ran through it. He took a small step forwards and held his breath slightly. He was sure the Weasley house would come into view soon.
“My mistake, Diggory,” said Harry. “Hufflepuff Captain, if I recall correctly. You were made Captain last year and
Neville laughed into his hand smiled at Hermione. “We’d’ve been lost without her in our first-year, y’know… Snape’s challenge would’ve stumped us both for days.”
Hermione shrugged wearily, glancing at the two boys with slight amusement. “Funnily enough, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle. Come on, let’s go,” she said, closing the door to down out Myrtle’s gurgling sobs. She was about to twist backwards and smile at Neville and Ron when a voice startled her.
Draco let out a silent sigh as his friend rambled on with a completely made up story that only an idiot would believe. Of course he was used to such exaggeration with Harry, a small thing turned into a major thing, especially when it revolves around himself. The story of when he was attacked by the peacocks at Malfoy Manor sprung straight to mind.
“Phineas Black succumbed to madness from his untreated and rampant paranoia,” said Atieno. “All Black’s have that drive that they are never safe and that someone is always after them or their money. It was exceedingly obvious in Phineas. He feared every creature in existence, ranging from goblins to dwarves to werewolves.”
“You were going to charge them four hundred and fifty Galleons for tickets?” said Cepheus, shocked. “Can anyone actually afford that, even if the process weren’t so unbelievably high?”
“I understand, he’s on thin thread, Molly knows what he is doing. She’s so close to taking him home.”
Lily and Petunia hadn’t been exactly close since Lily left the Muggle world and vanished into the magical world, but when her parents had died, she and Petunia reapproached sisterhood and rekindled the former relationship. It was a strained one, but the two got along without jibes and as long as Lily kept everything perfectly normal and didn’t do magic around Vernon, the two families could get along, but they were different in so many ways.
“Wonderful aren’t they? The more you struggle the tighter they get, Fred and George used them on me and the idiotic left two out in the open so I snagged them, they break after eight hours, and you better believe I’ll be back when they do to give you another punishment.” Ron covered Harry’s mouth with tape and walked out, shutting the door behind him, “oh and before I forget, don’t heal yourself or your boyfriend will get it much worse, and we all know he cannot heal himself.”
Harry turned to face the students and watched the papers fly towards them, “you may begin whenever ready, and any you get wrong you must write a three inch note on for next lesson. As always, you may start.”
The meeting was naturally drawing to a close, especially considering Nott was slowly losing the audience. As was the issue of controlling teenagers who had little to no attention spans and wanted to just do whatever they wanted. Sure, creating a secret group that plotted and schemed may have worked sixty odd years ago, but it wouldn’t now.
Harry muttered a spell under his breath and the portrait swung open, much to the distress of Salazar, who was hissing about flaws. He knew that it could be abused, but no one would guess the spell and even if they did, it wasn’t likely to work.
Dumbledore gave the boy a grandfatherly smile and sipped on his tea, his left hand firmly on his lap. “Of course, I see you are perceptive as always, Mr. Potter. I am curious on why you consider your family to be a weakness,” he said bluntly and then shook his head mentally. Silly, silly! Foolish to be blunt with a Slytherin and allow them the edge. He was doing so well up until now. Harry Potter was so similar to Severus in aspects of conversation, then add in a fair amount of Lucius’ personality into the mix and finally the natural talent at Occlumency that allows the boy to lie without anyone being any the wiser. “Of course, many have said the same thing, but they eventually lost their family and regret their words.”
Ron looked baffled, “N-no-no not her, I don’t like Hermione,” he finally spat out, Harry looked at him with a confused look, he then noticed Hermione walking up.
Professor Trelawney seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. “My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye.”
Every single student leaned forwards in anticipation, wondering what Flint would want. It was so suspenseful, just waiting for what would be said.
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. Harry ignored the shouts and focused on hunting for the Snitch, which was proving to be a deceitful little thing. He watched the Gryffindor Seeker constantly fly around, which is stupid as moving limits your vision.
Lily nodded and began the tour of the house. From the second she stepped in, she felt the warmth of a fireplace springing to life and the sound of a window seemingly opening by itself. The small amounts of furniture weren’t expertly crafted by the finest designers, but they were nice and suited the house nicely.
“Of course I would,” said Harry, flicking his eyes from Crabbe and Goyle to Draco. “He’s going to do something and get himself hurt.”
He glanced around, standing on the tips of his toes, looking for Viktor, who he knew would be here soon enough to put his name in. Of course, the moment he spotted the boy, Karkaroff appeared from nowhere and loomed over him, pushing back anyone else from getting close to Viktor. By the time he could blink, Viktor had put his name in the Goblet and was hurried out of the room.
Seamus took brave strides forwards, his wand slightly shaking in his hand, his eyes determined. “Riddikulus!”
“Go away Draco, I’m tired.” Blaise waved his arm around to no avail as Draco stayed and forced him up, “Fine, I’m awake, what plans?”
“He’s staying behind for the holidays, I already know from Lily, who sent me a letter telling me to inform Harry that it would be best if he remained at school for the holidays as she and James were rather busy,” said Neville calmly, his eyes betraying the inner turmoil that he attempted to hide. His gaze shifted towards Harry, who was sitting with Rosier and sneering at the boy. “He’s most likely just waiting for Malfoy to stay behind with him.”
“We should let you look at the interior, I have a feeling it will rain soon.” Narcissa said softly, Draco walked up and kissed her hand tenderly. “No Harry, you don’t need to kiss my hand.” Narcissa chuckled and motioned the two boys inside.
“Now don’t let me keep the feast waiting, enjoy!” Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye as food appeared.
Harry ignored him and focused on the Snitch, he could see Draco coming over, dodging and weaving bludgers. Draco finally it over and sandwiched Cedric, who then cursed and dived down, making Draco and harry slightly bump into each other. Both laughed and reached for the Snitch.
Not only that, but as he was parting ways with his mother, he learned that James was working on the case with Nott. It surprised him because he assumed it would simply be a lost cause, leaving the boy to suffer the effects for his lifetime. Then again, Nott was a child and the magical populace put children on a pedestal.
He had a theory that Professor Lupin had a contagious disease and no one wanted to be around him for extended periods. It was a sound theory and Professor Snape’s hatred towards the man.
Of course, while most of the other students were inside in the castle and embracing the warmth of the fires and the comfort of the castle, one person was standing outside in the snow, banging on the door leading into the Slytherin changing rooms.
There were two arched windows that were covered by a black curtain that was drawn shut, overlapping slightly so that no light got through at all. Just beyond that was a rather large queen size bed, one that you couldn’t move an inch without it blocking something. He made his way towards the wooden wall, which was to the left of his bed, on the box that he thought was the walk I wardrobe and he was correct.
“If I wished to bash, as you so eloquently put it, the headmaster, I would be,” replied Harry, sneering at Granger. “My only question is to you, Longbottom, and that’s why you decided to target my cauldron with your stupid firework?”
“Ah, yes, Harry mentioned that, too,” said Lily, smiling. “It was during the time when he was reading a book about strategy and something the author said seemed to resonate with his very being. I think it was fearing someone who mastered one type of style rather than someone who mastered many.”
“You can’t Apparate!” said Draco. “There’s bound to be spells over this building preventing people from Apparating and Disapparating. You’d have to –”
“That’s cheerful,” muttered Harry. “Surely that’s a joke, just like when he raved on about Nitwit, Blubber, Oddment and Tweaks.”
Harry had quickly learned that no student, regardless of what year they were in, cared that he had attended the Yule Ball with a partner of the same gender. No one had cared that he had supposedly spit on sacred traditions that were set in stone centuries ago. He had received no hate at all from any of his fellow students, whether they were in their first year or their seventh year. He expected to be attacked from those in Slytherin, those with deeply rooted pure-blood ideals.
“Of course!” said Harry, nudging the notes towards Ernie. “That way all of you can read them, except you, Smith, as you’re too stuck up to take my notes.”
“Oh, Harry,” said Lily under her breath. “I never thought you’d dive into the darker side of potions.”
“No, but I helped design it… now walk in a straight line, do not think about anything negative and make sure to wear your Malfoy pride on your sleeve, else you’ll be killed,” Lucius smiled, hoping that last sentence in itself wouldn’t be taken negatively. Draco took a step forward, swallowing deeply and strode across the lush grass that was surrounding his feet. He really wanted to glance at the traps, but he knew from studying that was a bad idea, the traps reacted to his thoughts and caution, if he looking about, they would set off.
He heard the door to the third-year boys’ dormitory slowly open. He twisted around and lifted an eyebrow at the obviously distressed, not to mention half-naked, Rosier.
Draco glared at him, “you made it fail? You told me to tell her she had nice breasts and that women loved that!”
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy, wooden door.
“Ridiculous!” said Draco, throw his hand sup into the air. “How could anyone ever want to hang upside to catch a Snitch? You could just drop down and then pick it up.”
“Ruin all my fun, Longbottom,” said Harry, scowling. “If you came as Bulstrode then we would’ve realised that something was wrong and not right instantly as she left not even forty minutes before Weasley and Longbottom got lost in the dungeons.”
“How could people build a castle by themselves in one lifetime?” said Harry, embracing the feeling of confusion in Granger. He knew that she now had doubts as his reason sounded more believable. “If I recall correctly, Godric killed the most Muggles while taking over the castle.”
“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Said Ron with a lifted eyebrow and a smug looking expression on his face. “Anyway, what are you revising for? You already know it all.”
Lily shook her head, her dark-red hair flying everywhere. “The only reason he wasn’t able to conquer us is simply because he had no strategy, he has numbers, but no logic, something no wizards tend to have these days. A strategist will win a war, do make me start quoting Sun Tzu, James.” She let out a long breath. “At least when he mindlessly attacked he was sloppy, if he isn’t attacking people then he has a plan, it’s a bad thing.”
“Master always told me to keep an eye on you and get information on Longbottom as he was the real threat… Potter wasn’t the threat that was prophesied, no… it was Longbottom. A pure-blood the one to cause my master his downfall? No… Longbottom, the cowardly boy, was meant to join my master… not – not defeat him! The half-blood was the enemy but my master was so sure… I do not doubt my master, but the Potter brat! So alike… no, no.”
Harry frowned at that. “Surely not, you’re just pulling things from thin air,” he said with a scowl. “It’s just coincidental, it could mean a lot, to be honest.”
“I promise,” said Harry, holding his hand over his heart. “I used to cook with mother when I was younger. We’d make breakfast together and it was a massive hit and no one got food poisoning. It’ll be fine, but I do have one condition.”
“Silencio!” Draco slammed his fist in front of the boy, “how do you speak of my mother, my mother has done nothing wrong to anyone.” Draco looked directly at the boy, “if I could hex you right now in this Great Hall I would, you’re just not worth my time.” Draco released his fists from the table and walked out of the Great hall.
Harry grinned and turned to Hermione, “I have something for you also!” She jumped softly on the spot, Harry pulled out a few expensive books, things that she would utilize daily, but for an odd reason the books were extremely expensive.
“The point that I am trying to make is that all these branches of magic, no matter how big or how small, are important to the masses. There is no harm in labelling everything that requires malicious intent to cast as the Dark Arts, but it is ignorant and it is causing magic to, as I said before, stagnate. I want you, my new pupil, to think of a spell and throw out a scenario that could push that spell into the Dark Arts. I have always been fond of the Levitation Charm. Go.”
He made his way towards where he knew Draco would be, assuming his friend had taken the logical and more efficient path, with a determined stride. He hardly cared about the spell, especially seeing as the Trace did not cause him issues, but if Draco had it, it meant that they could learn more in-depth duelling and practice it to a more realistic degree. A single strike for using underage magic, no matter what year it was in, could ruin any chance at Prefect and head Boy, which could then cause issues with a career later on. He hardly wanted Draco to fall out of the running because of some mistake that could have been prevented.
Harry did try and speak, but unlike last time when he tried nothing came out, this time his throat hurt like something was strangling him. Whereas before his voice was nice and smooth and it hardly hurt to speak, it now pained him to even try and breathe loudly. Despite the pain and uncomfortableness that he felt, he would keep trying to get over the pain, perhaps a potion to soothe the throat could help.
“I know that I’ve seen it twice, but I still cannot make it out,” said Draco, glaring at the wall where the door should be. “For the love of – where’s the class!”
“Before we begin brewing the potion, who would tell me what a side effect of brewing the potion incorrectly?” said Professor Snape, letting his dark eyes scan over the students, who mostly had their hands tucked under the desks. He noticed Hermione Granger with her hand up and wanted to ignore her, but suddenly a plan formed in his mind. “Yes, Miss. Granger?”
“I know,” said Harry after a moment of silence, mentally wondering how the professor knew he was there. “I was just walking by and I heard some noise. I thought that it may have been a younger student that’s lost. Hogwarts is a big place.”
“Most likely!” said the square-jawed man, smiling. “It will be many years before a new broom can be made better.”
He did wish that information on the Triwizard Tournament was far more accessible than it currently was, even if that information was nothing more than a reach than fact. He would be able to find more ways to kill a Manticore over some snippets of the Tournament. He had many ideas and scenarios floating around in his mind, his mind visualising something he could use and, yet, none of it would be viable if he had no information or a certain level of guarantee.
“I think that was a part of Potter’s plans,” said Neville, thinking on it. “Why else would Malfoy keep flying towards him and asking things?”
“You’re not worth my time to even debate about contesting, Nott,” said Harry, standing straight. “It took you weeks, perhaps even months, to think of this and then get it together and it fell apart as quickly as it started.”
“Leave,” snapped Lord Voldemort, glaring at the woman. “Bellatrix and I will remove any traces of magic here. Go and convince your idiot blood-traitor husband that you’re fine and not to get any heroic ideas and try and go to the Longbottom house. I’d hate for Harry to grow up without a father figure.”
“You idiot!” said Neville, shaking his head. He said no more, especially when he heard something and spun around, looking towards the door, which was currently slightly open. “Who’s there?”
Everyone had been anticipating what Professor Lockhart’s ‘morale-booster’ would be for the better half of the month, the gossip and anticipation had spread throughout the castle and people continuously chatted about what the glorious man could do to make them cheerful. He knew what exactly the man had planned the moment he stepped into the Great Hall on the fourteenth of February, better known as Valentine’s Day.
That was the answer that Harry actually expected, he just needed to make sure that his mind was in the correct place and that he wasn’t really overthinking the whole ordeal. “Thank you, Draco, that’s what I assumed.”
“We’ll go now, professor,” Hermione smiled as the words left her mouth, “He will be okay professor, he’s a survivor.” Hermione said as she walked past.
“Any more questions? If not, get dressed,” said the voice, the blame flames on the woman slowly siphoning back into the Goblet. “You have three minutes.”
The two lapsed into an easy silence as they went over the assignment. The pace of the discussion was slowly and steady and no hint of anger or annoyance was present, even as Harry corrected certain things to help the boy that told him about his family.
“We will be finishing school!” Draco hissed after hitting his partner in the arm, causing an uproar of laughter and an approving nod from Hermione.
Harry nodded at the snake, who seemed to be almost human with how it acted. He wondered briefly if that was the case.
“He shouted ‘don’t kill Draco, please, don’t, kill me instead.’ Among other things, that just reflect that, I’ll Pensive what I saw later, so you can examine it better.”
“Again how does it concern you?” Dean knew he couldn’t stand up to Ron, but he secretly wanted to impress Harry.
“I do expect you to write an apology to Hermione Granger and one to your mother,” said Narcissa. “Miss. Granger is this generations Lily Evans. Smart, powerful, and kind. Both Muggleborn, as well.”
Professor Snape watched as the boy once against fell into tears, his hand twitching painfully. “You’ll be fine in a few hours, even less if you go to the hospital wing and ask for a soothing balm from Madam Pomfrey,” he said as he turned away, ignoring the whimpering from the boy. “Stupid, dim-witted prepubescent hormonal teenagers! Most likely a fifth-year or above cursed the idiot boy for disrespecting his family.”
Severus walked onto the field, looking for Madam Hooch, when he couldn’t see her he turned straight upwards at the two Slytherins and one Gryffindor in the sky. “Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley. Get your feet back on the ground this instant!” he waited for the three of them to land on the ground; he rounded his eyes on the two Slytherins. “Where is Madam Hooch?”
Blaise spun around to face the student, “do you live under a rock? Did you get here yesterday? Harry was only sorted into Gryffindor because he told the Sorting Hat to put him there, Draco and Harry were enemies before they stepped foot in Hogwarts. Draco was sorted first and placed in Slytherin, so naturally Harry didn’t want to be in the same house as Draco and asked to be put in Gryffindor. This is the only year that Draco and Harry did not fling spells or insults at each other; it was a shock for all of us.” Blaise pushed off the door and flicked out his wand, “Stupefy!” Blaise then stormed off leaving other students gasping at the stunned first year.
Severus just shook his head and continued to sort the potions that Harry would require when he finally woke up.”
Professor Snape left before he could get dragged into a longwinded discussion about the pros and cons of Arithmancy and then begged for help on how to make the magic immune thing so Harry could use it to harass Draco with all his hair products.
Severus had heard about that one from Lily more than once, and it seemed to be her go-to argument against anything Peter Pettigrew.
Molly looked surprised, more at the fact Harry was gay and not that Ron belittled him for it, “you’re gay Harry? That’s wonderful news!”
Ron nodded as he turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.
Harry slowly made his way down the corridor that looked like it had been styled by a Muggle. It was almost reminiscent of Aunt Petunia’s living room. Everything was done perfectly and was done with a Muggle style in mind, which made sense for the Muggle Studies classroom.
“Denying it would be stupid,” said Harry. “So, I guess, it was, in some small sense, a compliment. A backhanded compliment.”
“She’s sayin’ that yor only ‘ere ter complete yor daily quota of ‘elpin’ the poor. As for the chuffin’ rest, right, that’s not right interestin’. Just a wee fun.”
“Well you see, back in year one he wanted to be my friend, and I said no, and we just started to become rivals. During this year we worked it out.”
Harry rolled his eyes and shut the door on the boy with a satisfied grin. He turned back and began scanning the shelves, muttering that the door would automatically relock after a few seconds and that none of the students would dare try breaking in as he had.
“Already reading, aren’t you, Harry?” said Theodore, a knowing look on his face as he slumped down on the sofa next to Draco, who he eyed suspiciously. “I cannot believe that he wakes us all up and then goes back to sleep.”
He turned his head just in time to see one of his favourite people, Hermione Granger, twist her head suddenly at something that had been said. He caught sight of her annoyed expression and instantly shifted forwards, preparing for the inevitable showdown.
He was unable to explain what was happening, mainly because Tom never seemed to notice, Atieno was far too concerned with an event that he wouldn’t address, and Salazar was a portrait and couldn’t see or note his physical pain, let alone his inability to speak properly. Draco, his best friend, wouldn’t dare address it, even if he noticed. For Draco, it would bring up horrid memories and thoughts that he would never wish to remember. He could not blame his friend, really. Draco followed a simple thought train of, ‘If the issue isn’t addressed, the issue isn’t real’.
“Who’d you get?” asked Terry as he picked up a small packet of Bertie Bott’s Every-Flavour Beans and began to spear his hand into the packet.
One, I wrote the chapter twice. The first version was much shorter, solved nothing, and was just filler for the divide. Before publishing it, I had this sense that it was bad. I went over some of my notes and realised that it was bad and it broke a lot.
Harry nodded his head, not that Tom could see that, or maybe he could, he stopped trying to understand Tom ages ago. He picked up the diary and toyed with it for a moment. He shifted his inkpot into a perfect position for writing and dipped one of his quills into it, not wanting to use Crabbe’s low-quality quill for writing. He opened the diary with one hand and gently set it on the desk, his wand sitting just next to him on the desk, in perfect grab range.
Dumbledore raised his hand, silencing the bickering boys instantly. “Well now boys, I must admit that you both were at fault –”
“All done?” asked Professor Snape, looking into the room. “Nice and tidy, good job, Mr. Potter. Five points to Slytherin.”
“We have our methods, littlest Potter,” said Fred, smirking. “We don’t just share our methods with anyone… only the most wise and well-respected – even if they may be in Slytherin.”
“I know you like it Harry, stop denying it. You’re on your back and in relatively tight slacks, lying to me will just make me do it more until you finally admit it.” Draco gazed at Harry, who stopped squirming.
Harry watched Draco, annoyed, as he walked away in his usual awkward manner, which he often reverted to when he was certain he had made a mistake. It was almost as if he wanted to turn and look back, but his body was fighting his mind on the matter.
, for a simple mistake, he knew he had the correct robes when he left, that means they played a joke on him? This was not a funny joke. Harry began to shake.
Peter laughed. “No!” he barked out, the laughter leaving his body in an instant. “Dumbledore knows that his castle isn’t becoming any safer… he knows that I am still here, waiting for him to make a mistake. Everything that has happened has been because of me and my master will be so… proud! I gave Ginny Weasley that diary that almost killed her… I found the location of the Stone and passed it on… I am most faithful!”
Lily considered this turn of event to be a very big issue for multiple reasons. She wanted James to spend time, alone, with his son, not have the Minister breathing down their necks and using the issues within their family as leverage. However, it was also a blessing because, as Severus had said, the Minister would see the damage that had been caused.
“Sorry, I was practising a character I was creating,” said the girl. “I like to roleplay and create characters in my head. Do you know what roleplaying is?”
“Then incidents like last year would be quickly handled,” said Neville. “It was only because of Madam Pomfrey and her knowledge into rare medicines that helped with the undoing of the petrifactions that the basilisk caused.”
Before he could start a conversation with Fleur, Longbottom stumbled into the room, quite literally, with his date laughing after him, which was a disgusting sight. He never thought Longbottom could as low as to invite a Weasley to the Yule Ball, but there she was, standing there in her second-hand dress that looked like she had pulled it from a bin. It was quite common knowledge that Weasley wanted to go to the Yule Ball, her eyes had been full of hope in the few days leading up to the date. No one had asked her, it seemed, and she had been growing desperate. How much of that was true, he had no idea, but the Slytherin students liked to gossip and spread malicious rumours.
Harry nodded, “yeah, I spent the short holidays with her at the Malfoy Manor, I was going to come here, but I didn’t want to intrude while Ron and I weren’t on speaking terms, Draco offered me to stay with them and I accepted. Narcissa and Draco took me to Godric’s Hollow and let me see my parent’s graves; it was emotional to say the least.” Harry frowned, “I’m fine now however, it was good to see them…”
Lily understood at that moment. The Australian schooling system worked similarly to Durmstrang and a little like Beauxbatons. If you fell behind you were left behind. It was a cutthroat system that caused the country to be scoffed at due to wizards and witches only being proficient in a few branches, unlike here where most knew the basics of everything.
Dumbledore smiled fondly and listened as Minerva explained the other students in her house before she stopped, he sent her a curious look. “Is that all of your lions, Minerva?”
“That sounds rather menacing,” said Harry, smiling at the man to show that he wasn’t afraid. He assumed that ‘being taken in’ meant that he was going to be questioned.
“Harry! Harry! Stop, for God’s sake! Are you sure about this?” said Draco, spinning his friend around with as much force as he could. “Are you one hundred percent sure that you want to… to affiliate yourself with such nonsense? I mean, do you even know what Nott’s got planned? I can contact my father…”
“Means that Gryffindor and Hufflepuff will get injured and may perform badly in their future games,” said Harry. “Injuries to them are
Blaise scrambled towards the Professors, hoping if Harry attacked him again they could stop him. He really wanted to apologize but he couldn’t.
“What did you come up with, Mr. Potter?’ asked Professor Snape, making sure that he would remember this moment clearly in the future. The shocked and upset facial expressions on Albus’ and Minerva’s faces was priceless. “The current rumour is that it was you that charmed the Bludger and sent it after Longbottom and that he had thwarted your plans by catching the Snitch.”
In the final book, there was a spell scribbled in the margins that would create a projection, much like a Patronus, of a druid that could speak and communicate with you. Of course, he had doubted the spell that was harmlessly written, but it also had a chapter under it that explained everything about the spell, what it would do, and how it could be done.
“No one is using petty politics,” muttered Harry. “Politics with your uneducated kind is like talking to a wall.”
“And what if I was to offer you a second chance, seeing as you interest me so?” interrupted Death with a smirk that didn’t fit his face. He flicked his hand and a dark throne appeared by him. “I’m sure you’ve noticed the fact that the door that you entered from is still there, and it is openable, yet you made no move for it.”
“When it got worse,” said Viktor. “I still ignored it as it wasn’t all that bad, but it was annoying. Near the end, I went to see the hospital lady and she said I should have come in right away, especially with the Tournament…”
“Close,” said Professor Moody, adopting the same style. “This is officially known as the style of the kings. Of course, over time, some refer to it as the arrogant style. It was mostly used by kings and their offspring, showcasing a very relaxed and cocky approach. Holding their wands with two or three fingers, much like one would a quill. Mr Potter holds his wand slightly different, with the handle bumping against his palm as he uses his index and middle finger to hold it. It’s a flamboyant style that rewards aggression, reeks of confidence, and allows swift and precise movements at the cost of stability.
“Says you, Draco,” laughed Harry, shaking his head. “I have no idea why they don’t ever accept help, but it’ll be their own downfall in due time.”
He felt particularly sorry for vampires, who had to wade through the overly bright and constantly sunny Diagon Alley. It probably hurt them more than it was a convenience. Well, he wanted to change that.
“Will you go to sleep? Your shadow is annoying me.” Blaise slid a marker in his book, knowing full well something was on Draco’s mind and he would talk about it.
Mr. Borgin fixed a pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list. “The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?”
The sound of knives and forks clanging against plates echoed the Hall, moments later, idle chatter started. Students loaded their plates with various foods, others with drinks, and some opting to not eat at all.
Ron threw a weak spell back at Harry; Ron kept his wand firm, despite him shaking heavily after he cast the spell. Harry didn’t react, he just watched, and waited for it to come closer.
The two remained silent for a long period, each of them staring the other down as they waited for someone to break the silence. The sounds of annoyed breathing filled the room as the two men broke contact and huffed.
Harry thought on it for a second, not wanting to keep his Seeker occupied for a long period of time. “Start with the second formation that we discussed – go half defensive, half aggressive. Don’t allow their Chasers to score any goals, even if one our Beaters start playing defensive with the Keeper,” he said, thinking up what could happen. “As for you, Draco, you’re doing fantastic.”
She was wary of her eldest son’s perception, even more so as she was planning to snap a picture of her sons playing around. She wasn’t that type of parent, she’d allow her boys to have a camera free life, but this one was just too adorable.
Harry would master this spell with ease and achieve something no other student has ever done. “And what does a Patronus look like?” he asked with a curious glance. “Can you cast a Patronus?”
He paused in the middle of the dirt path, looking for a certain store. The stores on the outer edges of the village were often much cheaper and had more unique items, often having them stocked for many years without a single purchase, which did nothing but increase their value while the store lowered their price due to cluttering the shelves. The stores that were not on the main street were often houses that had the living room altered and the owners sold odds and ends out of it, which no one cared too much about.
Harry snorted and glanced at Hagrid with a smile. “I simply don’t care what the Ministry has said, you deserve a new wand.” He gestured to Ollivander. “Go on Hagrid, pick a wand that suits you, I’ll pay for it. This is how I’m paying you back for you bringing me into this world, without you, I would still be in that cupboard.”
“Not saying it to make you feel bad,” said Lily. “You were an adult when that happened, supposedly mature, though I doubt it, Harry killed someone at thirteen, still a hormonal teenager.”
familiars. Be sure to spend more time with both of them. Oh, if you see Mr Longbottom, kindly repeat that to him, too.”
“I swear I answered that…” muttered Harry, trailing off as he tilted his head slightly. “I don’t really care about Quidditch, honestly. I was on the Quidditch team at Hogwarts, being the youngest Seeker in a century before Longbottom decided to usurp me and attempt to take the title from me. Ever since, I never really enjoyed it. I’m the Captain for the team now, but I no longer play.”
“Live ‘uns!” said Sir Patrick excitedly, spotting Neville, Ron and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again, of course the crowd howled with laughter.
“At least they didn’t ship us off to Azkaban,” he said, trying to crack a joke, but it had no humour in it at all. “If this torture isn’t enough of a deterrent, then you have an unbreakable will and a strong desire.”
“A spell to translate words into another language would be very difficult. There’s a reason that no one has been able to make one yet,” said Draco, his chin lifted. “We can make things float, summon fire, and do all sorts of stuff, but we cannot instantly learn something. It’s not possible and it breaks the rules of magic.”
“Come on, Theodore!” said Harry in a slightly whiny voice. “We’re going to investigate the third-floor corridor and then we’ll uncover the reason why it’s apparently –”
He bid farewell to the portrait of the man, who kept dropping subtle hints about his hidden room and where to look for it, which were false clues as the areas that he was being told to look no longer existed or the entire wing of the building was hidden, but that would cause some issues when trying to expand outwards in that direction.
“Maybe not,” said Rosier as he sat down next to Harry. “It’s always nice to have some blackmail material that isn’t completely made-up. I mean, most of the things we have on them are false and can be pulled apart easily.”
“Nice attempt at trying to be charming,” said Lily with a chuckle. “I’ve grown immune to your attempts at complimenting me to get out of things, Harry.”
“We will ask again at the start of next year, just to be sure, but I assume he wants to be with Draco and that’s not really a bad thing, is it?” Albus said with a smile.
“Perhaps we should just call it a night,” suggested Harry, peering around a corner. “I mean, the third-floor corridor isn’t going anywhere.”
“You don’t tell me anything anymore,” said Draco. “You’re also being slightly distant, avoiding me and favour of endlessly studying the new books that you got this year. I understand that you’re taking like thirteen classes, but you should still have time for
“Interesting,” said Harry. “I had no idea that my birthday is the day that everyone tended to visit Diagon Alley.”
She finally took her seat next to her son, who was now looking at the bookshelf and the book in her hands with keen interest. She realized almost instantly that she had chosen a book on charms, which tended to be a constant issue, as her hands sought out books on charms, as if on their own. She sent her son a quick motherly smile, especially when she realized that her son was eyeing the bookshelf with interest, as if wanting to get up and study the thing.
“I guess not, perhaps we should seek to remedy that,” said Dumbledore, his blue eyes twinkling. He gave a grandfatherly smile and turned to Professor Snape. “Severus, my boy, would you mind fetching Mr. Potter’s trunk?”
“Jordan, would you mind telling us about the game?” interrupted Professor McGonagall. “I am certain the students would like to hear what’s going on in the match.”
“Yes!” said Ginny, looking delighted. “The destruction of books upsets me and I vowed to destroy whoever did it.”
Petunia said nothing, her eyes just downcast. She heard a long string of Latin and then watched as the cake reformed and flew through the air, resembling what it looked like previously.
“The bracelet is no longer considered to be dark; in fact it has no traces of dark left in it. It’s now just a wristband. Are you sure this is the correct wristband?”
“There’s no solid proof, Zacharias,” said Susan. “The Bloody Baron vouches for him, constantly and the Hogwarts ghosts cannot lie, neither can the portraits.”
He spent the sixth-day pacing and highly on edge, barely managing to snap at anyone who tried to speak to him. He could not concentrate and he found himself furious that the day was going much slower than anticipated. He was sure that he was punished for the previous days going by quickly.
“IT SHOULDN’T HAVE TAKEN YOU A DAY TO SEND ME A NOTIFICATION THAT MY SON WASN’T AT THE SCHOOL! HE SHOULDN’T BE LOST IN THE FIRST PLACE!”
“Why here?” said Pansy the instant the door was closed. “After Longbottom and his posse used this last year, it has become a known spot where students plot things.”
“Oh shut up, you prat! You honestly look like more of a girl than me, you know, with your hair slicked back like you’re wearing pigtails with little bows on them, much like Susan Bones from Hufflepuff.”
“At least you’ve got your head on straight,” said Perenelle. “I was expecting you to demand millions worth of gold and crash the market.”
Off to the side, Harry snorted and rolled his eyes. Of course, he knew that Weasley had written in the dairy and that was the reason for her declining health. He also knew that she was a fool for writing in an object that could change and adapt to you and make you feel safe, secure, and not alone. Sure, he had written in the dairy, but he, unlike Weasley, was talented and a genius, therefore wouldn’t be controlled by a mere diary. He lifted his head from the floor when he heard tom laughing, a very high and a very cold sounding laugh.
“They were mentally messed up,” said Harry. “They could’ve made every spell in the world and nothing would’ve convinced me to stay beside them. They were mentally fractured and I’m shocked you think that’s my type.”
“Have you been in the Gryffindor common room?” asked Harry, giving off a mock shiver at being forced to remember how the room had looked. “It’s so bright and hideous! There’s red and gold everywhere, no matter where you look your eyes are going to bleed from the sheer ghastliness that is the Gryffindor common room.”
After walking through the metre long hallway, which was bare except for a burning candle on the wall, he pushed open an old and worn looking wooden door, one you would most like find in an actual dungeon.
Hermione frowned, but covered it quickly. “Yes. It’s been out of order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it, it’s awful trying to go to the loo with her wailing at you –”
Harry rolled his eyes and gently placed Nagini on the stone floor so she could explore the surface of the owlery. He narrowed his eyes and searched for his elusive owl, which shouldn’t be hiding as decently as she was. “Hedwig,” he called, glancing around the rafters. “Are you here?”
“Go to your common room, and talk to no one about this, also wash your face, you’re a Slytherin, we don’t cry,” Snape locked the door when Draco left and sighed.
“How the generations get so inpatient is beyond me,” said the man with a knowing smile, his eyes still twinkling. “My dear boy, I have spent enough time around a few adept Legilimens that I know the signs that it’s going to be used, but I am more shocked by the fact a nine year old child can perform it and has performed it intentionally in the past.”
Molly was by no means at all, a weak woman. She had birthed seven children over the years, and two of them were twins. She lifted the boy and placed him on the sofa and made him comfortable. She didn’t want to leave him at all, so she hoped another child would come in soon, or Arthur.
“You dragged me off into the Gryffindor common room,” said Harry. “You dragged me into a common room of a house that I’m not even in. You then insulted Slytherin students, despite the fact that I’m a Slytherin.”
Harry wanted to cry in satisfaction as he listened to Fleur ruthlessly berate the youngest Weasley, her words as scathing and direct as possible. There was no compassion or easiness in the tone, either, which meant that Fleur was truly trying to hurt the girl. He wished that everything mean he said resulted in such chaos, but he knew he lacked the natural charisma and charm for it. He watched the fight with amusement, whispering to his date, and noticed that Weasley was clearly on the verge of tears.
Harry didn’t make it far before the Bloody Baron was in front of him, smiling. “Hello, Baron, pleasant to see you once more.”
“Waking up and finding yourself submerged in snow isn’t a pleasant experience, I can assure you,” said Rosier. “After the first six times, I started to make sure to be awake before ten so that I wouldn’t have to wake up to snow all over my bed.”
Harry realised that, while not an attempt to fish out whether he was a Parselmouth or not, it was an attempt to figure out something deeper. Perhaps, maybe, Weasley was fishing for more information about Nagini. He knew, as did everyone else, that it was an innocent question that meant no harm, but Harry was quite paranoid about people.
Hermione let out a long sigh, only just managing to not roll her eyes in disbelief. “Ron, Malfoy only wanted the diary because he assumed that it belonged to Neville. I highly doubt that he would have made it up here, undetected, and found his way into your dormitory, stealing the diary,” she said, huffing. “Let’s not forget that nothing else was stolen or sabotaged –”
Draco swung his arm suddenly and caught Longbottom in the nose, the boy sprawled across the ground, groaning. He turned towards Harry, who had his lips pursed, his face filled with amusement, even more when a thin red liquid began to file out of Longbottom’s nose.
Draco stood to greet his mother, “hello mother, what brings you here today?” He lifted her hand and gave it a gentle kiss, Draco let his mother through before scowling at the kids and slamming the door.
“Because children like to talk,” said Professor Snape. “The Auror department cannot have their tactics and strategies getting passed around. It is also a safety risk because some of the things they learn can be lethal if done incorrectly.”
, the Firebolt is going to be the broom of choice for the nation teams at this year’s World Championship –”
“That cheat!” hissed Draco, shifting one of his pawns straight into the position where his mother wanted it, not that she let on. “That cheat!”
Neville looked over towards Ron. “I reckon,” he said, thinking back to the moment. “D’you remember when she came up to us, looking as if she had something to say?”
Harry nodded, his attention flicked from the elderly lady onto the fighting books. “What are those? They don’t look too friendly.”
Harry’s bedroom was on the far left, it had a light brown door with his name on the door in childish letters, something he had designed when younger. Inside the room was rather spacious, in fact it was the second biggest room in the house. One wall held a few small bookshelves that were pushed against the wall tightly, allowing only a small gap behind them. Each shelf was littered with various books and a few small hand drawn pictures and quills. Most of the pictures were basic, nothing advanced, stick figure family pictures with a few squiggles here and there.
Harry looked around, his feet hurt and he was tired and Draco didn’t help fix either of these issues.
“Because, if you had been listening to anything I have been saying, he has been alive for quite some time,” said Severus, sighing. “Albus is aware of his return, but there is not much we can do while the Dark Lord is hiding under the Fidelius Charm. I have no doubt the Secret Keeper is locked inside of his dungeons and is only allowed out to pass on the secret to a select few. What you have done is more important than rumours.”
“And?” said Harry with a grin. “I am usurping your title of popcorn holder and claiming it as my own. No questions asked.”
Atieno snorted. “That is way too confusing,” he said. “Giving a building the ability to be sentient? I have no words for that.”
“That’s unbelievable,” muttered Wood as he huffed, leaning over Neville. “Flint will be here until after Neville here graduates, the man hasn’t got a brain.”
“Clearly,” said Professor Snape in a slow drawl, which caused the Slytherins to wince slightly. “Mr. Malfoy, would you go and fetch Mr. Potter from the library? It’s obvious that he’s far to engrossed in a book to listen to the portrait that’s telling him to come back to the common room.”
“That you, Potter, are a Legilimens, it was started by Terence Higgs and later confirmed by Gemma, the Prefect.”
Harry already knew a vast majority of this, as he himself had stumbled across four secret rooms in his time in the house. Two were just secret areas that had dark artefacts hidden in them and one held a lot of notes, some which could put the Malfoy family in a bad light. The final room had been opened when he hissed in Parseltongue and a wall slid open, revealing a rather stone like room which held nothing but a small table and a single chair. The notes explained that they had hoped to integrate Parseltongue into the Malfoy family and that future heirs would be able to hide in the room if any enemies came, but the experiment failed.
“Maybe in conversations that you control,” said the man, a knowing glint in his eyes. “But if you knew when to remain silent, you would have allowed me to speak until I was finished and not interrupted me.”
The entire school rushed towards the commotion, leaving a circle around something, as if it was one of those famous schoolyard fights where students gather around and chant ‘fight’ over and over again, as if it couldn’t get any more childish than that, the girls screamed instead of chanting fight.
He observed the unicorn with a fond expression. No matter how awful a human was, everyone would see the beauty in a unicorn. It was an unwritten law. There was no creature purer or more beautiful than one. Their hair was said to be the softest in the world, inducing a calming effect that could put even the most aggressive and livid to rest. While he knew it was not a creature of light, like many assumed, it was a creature of peace and serenity. The unicorn left a trail of happiness, satisfaction, and harmony wherever it went. He could feel the effects just being in this clearing.
Lucius released his arm from Harry’s shoulder, “alright, let’s go and find Draco and begin this just a pre-warning Harry, as this is your first time it may knock you out for one or two days, that’s simply because of how powerful your magic is, Draco’s first time took him out for a week. Ready?”
Professor Snape wasn’t pleased, his face turned into a sneer as he glanced around the corridor. “And what are you doing in this corridor? Idiot boy, do you want people to keep accusing you of petrifying students?”
It had hardly just been his parents, either. A lot of Slytherin was up in arms over it, certain that Longbottom had cheated, no matter if saying it gave the boy some degree of praise due to cheating in the Tournament being impossible. He knew that Longbottom did not cheat, but it was easier to just nod and go with the masses. After all, it was making people who disliked him potential friends, so it had benefits.
Hermione wasn’t fooled by the charming personality of the boy, of course there was more to it than being just a Slytherin, as she doubted that it’d be any different if Harry Potter was sorted elsewhere. She had seen this happen often enough before she came to Hogwarts, there was always this one boy who seemed as if he was above everyone else, but also cruel and mean for no reason at all. She had a feeling she knew what it was, but she needed to think. “But, Hagrid –” she tried and realized that she wasn’t being listened to, as Hagrid was simply humming along to the egg.
“Trolls are stupid,” whispered Harry. “If we don’t move it could very well just stumble straight by us.”
. They’ll be underestimated when they finally hit their N.E.W.T.s. Crabbe is insanely good at spells, able to weave them together insanely well. Goyle is amazing at shielding. Pair them together and you have an army of two.”
“Calm down Draco, I just assumed that it was alright to talk about Harry at the table, last I saw you two were pretty much friends.”
Harry slumped back in the chair, “I didn’t like it, it showed of my scar too much, and people gaped at it, it was annoying.”
“Mum?” whispered Neville at the mirror, tears threatening his eyes. “Dad?” he didn’t stick about before he barged from the room and his loud footsteps echoed back into the room.
Scowling, Lily turned and locked eyes with her husband, “you shouldn’t talk about Albus like that, James,” turning away, she continued with typical Gryffindor bravado. “He did everything that he could have to help us get through the tough pregnancy I had with Harry, and even then protect us from threats.”
“Rubbish, Ron!” said Hagrid, standing up straight, his head almost colliding with the ceiling. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”
“What’s a board game?” asked Draco, he had finished dressing and was now standing next to Harry in his green Quidditch robes.
“ALBUS,” Harry yelled and wrapped his arms around Dumbledore. “I’m so sorry for what I did… whatever it was.” Tears streamed down Harry’s face.
“Did I? Oops,” said Harry, grinning. “I agree and disagree with my own statement. A spell cannot be severed and sliced in two. It’s unfathomable and goes against all laws and regulations of magic and how it fundamentally functions. You can’t pull apart a spell. If a spell hits a feather, it will stop, no matter what spell it may be. No difference between a sword, a feather, and a wall. They will all stop a spell the same way.”
“Harry my boy.” Albus said when the clapping had died down. “I am very, very proud, you did the one thing I always wanted to do, and you did it with your heart. I am very proud.” He said with a grandfatherly smile. “As for you Mr. Hagrid, I expect you to come and talk to me every day and we can have some sherbet lemons.”
“We don’t need to see this,” said Harry. “They’ve clearly got an Ageing Potion and think that’ll work. Let’s go and get some toast. I’m starving.”
“Form groups of twelve and then go to your Head of House,” said Dumbledore. “A seventh-year student must be in each group.”
He had failed. Not just himself, but the woman that spoke to him as if she cared. He had tried to cling to the voice but had been unable to do so and that made it all worse. She had put her trust and faith in him and he had failed her.
Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Neville left the library with Ron in tow. He, Ron and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to. He and Ron waited outside in the corridor to see if Hermione had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for a fortnight, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Hermione joined him and Ron, shaking her head. They went off to lunch.
“If the question is why I made James Potter Head Auror, I’m afraid I have no logical answer,” said Fudge, laughing. “However, please call me Cornelius. I have to spend my entire day with formality.”
“I could have killed you both and no one would’ve been the wiser,” sneered Peter. “I could have killed you before you knew what was going on… but my master… no, no. No, he wanted you left alive! Lily would often ask me to prepare your bottles… I could have easily slipped a poison in, killing you… Lily would have blamed herself, yes. She was always scared of harming you – doubting herself…”
“Harry, glad to see that you’re not re – you’re reading, of course,” said Theodore as he walked into the dormitory. “I’m glad that your balloons are still up, they make the room more vibrant.”
They all fell silent and watched as Neville Longbottom fell slowly from a sky that had been filled with hundreds of Dementors.
“You’ve said that before,” said Harry. “You say that no creature should be trusted, no matter their appearance or personality, but there are exceptions to that rule. You’re a vampire and you break all the known clichés.”
A man with pure white robes and soft light-brown hair was hovering over the screaming boy with something with shock filling his eyes. It took all but a second before he snapped back into Healer mode and barked orders at his secretary to fetch potions and start preparing the small boy for his treatment. “Alright, Harry,” he soothed, his tone soft and gentle, “you’ll be fine.”
Lord Atieno shook his head and sighed. “That does not mean you had to intentionally lock all the doors with more spells and enchantments. I know you used some that she, no matter what, will never come across.”
“Hagrid!” said Dumbledore loudly, making sure that Hagrid had stopped speaking. “I do not think that Neville attacked those people.”
“There you are!” said Lily, her face instantly going into a very happy expression. She placed a plate of hot food in front of her son, who smiled up at her in thanks. “James has already left…”
“If we go to the Ravenclaws first, who’ll go to the Hufflepuffs?” said Harry, continuing on from the old topic. “Ravenclaws admire knowledge, we easily have that.”
It also explained why no one thought about a basilisk going around petrifying people in a school. According to many sources, a basilisk hadn’t been sighted in Europe in well over four hundred years, and the last sighting, which was four hundred years ago, was considered to be a hoax.
Dumbledore hushed them, and raised his hand. “Professor Lupin is not the only person returning this year, we have a very special guest returning, and some could say he never actually left.”
Lily stopped in the kitchen and glanced through the archway into the dining room. She caught Sirius sitting at the table, with an almost childlike expression on his face. She placed her hand son her hips and faced the man, a dangerous glint in her eyes. “Sirius, how did you get into my house? I checked every door and window.”
“It will not be easy,” said Atieno, shaking his head. “It will not even be slightly difficult, no matter where on the scale you desire it to be. The worst thing you can do when going into
He didn’t complain, though. He allowed Draco to make his own choices in life and he would be there to pick up the pieces when Daphne used him in the end. It was all the girl did. Use people.
Professor Snape bared his teeth slightly and swung his wand over his shoulder, he wasn’t one for flashy tactics, but he would put on a show as he humiliated Lockhart. “Expelliarmus!”
Harry once again nodded, hoping to convey his message without words. It was just gold, as Muggles tended to say, that Narcissa had just proposed a solution to the issue that he was currently facing and had no idea that he would have already gone to them if he wanted. If it weren’t for his mother, he would have already jumped ship and moved in with the Malfoy’s. There would have been absolutely no hesitation in it, but his mother held such a high place in his heart and he would never leave her.
“We are around a minute away from the area,” said Atieno. “You will have more questions then, I assume.”
Dumbledore did wonder what the boy needed to do that was so urgent that it required the meeting about a petrified cat to be cut short. He turned his head slightly towards the boy and locked eyes. He was confused as it was almost like the boy was daring him to attempt to use Legilimency. With a swift entrance, he entered the boy’s mind. His first thought was that it was far too easy to enter, especially with how much Severus praised the boy’s ability as an Occlumens.
“I assume that it’s left,” said Professor Lupin, looking around with alert eyes. “If we follow the path it took, then we will be able to cover a larger area.”
“No, of course not, the top of my list is the fact you’re gay, and gay people deserve to be beaten.”
“I knew I could count on you and your son,” Voldemort glanced at him, “but I have to wonder, does your son wish to become a Death Eater?” Voldemort kept his glance on Lucius firm.
Neville jumped and turned his head slowly, hoping that it wasn’t a professor and that he hadn’t been caught eavesdropping on the staff meeting. He frowned when he saw Lily Potter standing there, the brim of her eyes red. “They’re just arguing with each other,” he said, watching as Lily slid down the wall and sat next to him. “They’ve got Professor Dumbledore and James, I’m sure they’ll find him.”
“I don’t see the issue,” said Ron. “You came in second in the year, despite what Malfoy and that lot seem to say.”
Harry woke up with a splitting headache, he looked around and realized he was in a darkened room; he caught sight of a female whose hair looked like she never washed it. His glasses were smashed so his vision was blurry and his wand was gone. He remembered dropping it before he was hit by the spell, so hopefully it was still there. Harry could feel a cough coming on, but he didn’t want to alert them that he was awake yet, he regretted trying to take a breath as the dust flooded into his mouth, which caused his to choke and stutter before coughing. Harry felt himself pull his body into a fetal position as the lady approached him.
“I know that he’s a fighter, but that just makes it so much worse!” said Lily, sobbing. “While he’s out there fighting for his life, we’re in here doing
The thing that made Harry cautious was not how the Headmaster held himself, nor was it how he spoke. It was how everyone in the room silenced. People obviously respected the Headmaster, knowing how powerful and influential he was.
They landed quickly and Neville ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.
“Why not?” asked Harry, a cruel looking smile on his face. “Do you want me to turn around and go tell the professors what you’re doing?”
“What will change?” said Lily, leaning forwards. “I can’t imagine him being any different than he already is.”
The ice-cream was ordered and placed in front of him in record time, in fact he was sure Mr. Fortescue would have ruffled his hair had it not been laced with Sleekeazy's Hair Potion and a few stray charms and there to make sure it holds in place and isn’t a mess like what his father’s hair looks like. He slowly chipped away at his ice-cream and waited for the old man to make a return to his table so they could discuss alchemy and that he could find out something about the Philosopher’s Stone.
Theodore grumbled under his breath, complaining about Slytherins being bookish and how that was a Ravenclaw trait. He had to word it right so that Harry didn’t burst out screaming ‘knowledge is power’ as he tended to do when you made books or reading seem like nothing but importance. He made his way towards his trunk, still grumbling, and opened it. He dug around in it and pulled out a thin book which was covered in dark blue and silver. He fled the room after that, wondering if Harry ever talked to his pet snake as Millicent did with her cat.
Neville attempted to soothe her, but failed miserably, something about people sniffling or crying made him useless. He turned to Ron, who just shrugged, and frowned. “Come on Hermione, let’s check on you-know-what.”
Lev shouted, cutting off whatever Clara was going to say and then glared at the girl, pointing towards the young boy, who seemed somewhat oblivious to what was going to be said. He cleared his throat, glaring at all of them.
“Joyful,” Hermione thought to herself, hoping Snape didn't start to ask Harry questions about potions; else their house points would be minus 50 before the lesson even started.
“Regardless, within three moves you were done anyway, I just wanted to see if you’d notice it or if you acted out to get my queen.”
“I love you, too, Claire-bear,” said Vasily, blowing a kiss to the girl. “As for you, Harry, I am shocked and quite offended you were actually stumped on who we were. You know, Viktor is pretty much a wizarding world icon, seeing as he’s on a professional Quidditch team at the age of seventeen.”
“Well, according to Lee Jordan, that annoying and ignorant announcer, Gryffindor is about fifty points ahead,” said Harry, scratching at his forehead. “His bias and unnecessary comments are east to see through. When Gryffindor are ahead, he compliments the game. When Gryffindor are losing, however, he calls cheating and unfair plays.”
“Mr Zabini, what did I say before I left?” said Professor Snape. “I have no patience. Go into the room and be on your best behaviour. Mr Potter, as you spoke first, you can lead the way. Do not dawdle and no not disgrace Slytherin by behaving like the moronic teenagers you are.”
“Yes, your magic flooded the house and James turned it into an aquarium and got himself banned from the house.”
Harry remained on the chair with Draco, remaining quiet and just observing the students who put their name into the Goblet. It seemed like remained quiet was more detrimental to Hogwarts than mocking and berating people. After Diggory had left, with cheers in his wake, everyone else seemed to just stagnate and not submit their name, despite holding the piece of parchment. It seemed like, in some twisted sense, their mocking was giving the students that last-second push to put their name in. The mocking and teasing was like a second wind.
“Because I have some common sense and think logically,” said Harry, dismissing the boy. “Continue, Professor Snape, I’ll simply ignore it like I did last year.”
Gemma stepped off the platform shortly afterwards and rushed towards Harry, squashing him in a hug. “You should never doubt me, Harry, I saw it when I announced it.”
“Now, close your eyes and prepare,” said the druid. “Breaking the connection will siphon a lot of your magic. It will not be a dangerous amount, of course, that is impossible, but it will leave you close to exhaustion.”
Draco listened as Dumbledore continued his long-winded speech, changing the topic from Harry to house-unity and working together to achieve a common goal. He listened as the headmaster complimented each house, pointing out their strong points and then dove in and amplified them by listing the strengths that could happen if all houses worked together.
For it being a minor accident, it had taken close to three hours to clean up and fix. Professor Snape had retrieved him dinner and sat it on a conjured table while he scrubbed at the spill of a rather contagious potion.
“That’s the art of adventure, I dare say,” said Harry. “I assume there’ll be a light Repelling Charm on it to push you away, so if you suddenly stop looking and turn away, you’ve found it. How’ll we’ll get through it is another issue, but I’m hoping because I know about it, it’ll simply let me through.”
He stepped into the designated spot and waited, watching as his peripheral vision slowly became limited and all he saw was a stream of magic flowing downwards like a curtain. Within seconds, in the top right, a little white orb appeared and slowly moved towards him.
Lily gave a smile nod in acknowledgement and walked alongside her son, smiling politely at the people who greeted her. She stepped up the marble white stairs and greeted the goblin, as her son did and made her way into the bank. She read the warning and stepping into the building in almost record time.
Dumbledore chuckled, “if you want to believe that Harry, then please do. It’s a compliment, I just have stronger control on my magic, when you turn seventeen you could beat me in a duel with your eyes closed.”
“Fine,” said the old woman. “I’m only agreeing because I know arguing with you is pointless when you’re set on something. Stubborn boy, just like my Malithorian. How I miss his laugh.”
He had attempted various things that would make most shake their heads in confusion. Different ingredients that had been dried in the sun for hours or fresh ones that were damp from the rain.
“Alright Narcissa, you go and get Harry, I’ll find out the cause and Draco you stay here.” Lucius ran out afterwards following the disturbance.
“Typical Slytherin tactics,” said Lee Jordan, his body posture tensed. “Listening into the other team’s pep talk. How disgusting! Did you learn anything useful, Potter? Anything at all?”
“As you have already seen, Harry Potter has joined us for a brief and delightful conversation.” Voldemort threw his head back and cackled, “not intentionally of course, but I have various concerns that I would like to express.”
“Of course we won, and I have to think on it, I’ll tell you in the morning, you still owe me slave time from like, the start of the year.” Draco chuckled and led Harry out of the infirmary.
He had a deal with Nicholas Flamel, the most talented alchemist in history and he would never have money issues, he would never worry about ageing or dying of natural causes. There was an issue that despite how driven he was to learn and know everything, what if some accident happened and he couldn’t do anything about it? What if Draco needed him and he just froze and did nothing about it? So many different scenarios that could go badly because of his faults.
“An awe-inspiring counterargument,” said Lily. “I’m not trying to guilt trip or force you to come. I don’t want you to choose me over your own preferences. I don’t want you to come to the Burrow if you truly don’t feel welcome there. It would be cruel on my behalf to force you to join us.”
“As much as I hate to admit, I never thought about that. Seeing as the effect wasn’t intentionally caused, Harry Potter would wake up and use the magic he stole from me and do it, he could have the power to kill himself.” Voldemort paused briefly, “but I doubt he would, I assume Dumbledore has already figured something out.”
“Ten Galleons it was Slytherin who said no.” Ron said sarcastically, almost expecting not to be heard.
David made a noise of some sort, desperately wanting to look at the boy as he spoke. “I’m not sure how to say this, Harry, but I don’t like women that way,” he said, keeping his eyes locked firmly on the road. He was sure the boy was old enough to know what a homosexual was. “I haven’t ever walked that path, so a child is impossible.”
,” he said as he pocketed the bag of Galleons. “I’m actually surprised that you haven’t wised up yet and learned that I’ll do almost anything. I’m not afraid.”
Harry sat on the stone bench in the courtyard, despite the lunch bell ringing, there was still twenty minutes until lunch actually started. “They put us with the Gryffindors because if we were with anyone else, we’d be far too advanced for the other houses to keep up,” he said, looking down the courtyard and seeing the ditsy girl that was in his Herbology group belittling Granger. “So, who is our Defence Against the Dark Arts professor? I haven’t seen him or her anywhere around the school and my timetable doesn’t say his name, as usual.”
“Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry and then paused, noticing their Head of House walking towards them. “Wait, let’s wait a moment.”
Harry froze and then sneered, he yanked the cloak from himself with gritted teeth. “How did you know?”
The books contained mostly the same information that he already knew, with details of them being very scarce. In fact, he had learned the most in a book related to Herbology. It seemed unlikely, but it made complete sense, especially considering they were creatures of nature, which Herbology seemed to cover without even trying to.
“More people were upset that the Slytherin line was ‘disgraced’,” said Draco, sneering at the word. “I’m sure many would’ve attempted an assassination attempt if he hadn’t died when he did. He was on the verge of losing all his followers regardless.”
“Interesting, you must know him inside and out,” said Theo as he pondered something in his mind. “Who would have thought that a Malfoy and a Potter would have gotten along, it’s almost as odd as a Weasley and a Malfoy.”
3) I have shelved almost every single piece of work I am working on except for this, my novel, and a stray Slice of Life fic that will. Not. Go. Away. I lack the time to write so much, even if I want to, and it is not fair to you to wait for two months for another chapter that should take two weeks. If you are curious about that Slice of Life story, feel free to ask. It has no real plot and that means I can just write nonsense and pass it off as everyday stuff. Woo!
Before Draco could say anything, Voldemort began to speak again. This infuriated Draco; he didn’t like being cut off.
“I have no decent way to say it,” said Harry. “Honestly, I cannot think of a better way that would suit both worlds.”
“How dare you accuse my sister? You stupid – you slimy snake!” bellowed Ron, causing the room to jump slightly as his voice echoed off the wall.
“There’s something that we need to discuss as soon as possible,” said Lily, a concerned expression replacing the serious expression. “As your father lacks the correct etiquette, despite his upbringing, I’ll be explaining what’s going on. It’s nothing bad, just so you know.”
“There isn’t a student that hasn’t yet come into the hospital wing, Mr. Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey and then chuckled. “Not many are actually as nice as you are, they get fixed then leave and do the same thing again! Regardless, you may have some issues breathing through your nose for a few minutes, but that will wear off.” She said and ushered the boy out, debating why the two Gryffindors would target such a sweet and kind boy.
“Hufflepuff,” said Robin, sighing. “I can hear you laughing. Hufflepuffs may be the most kind, caring, and welcoming individuals, but they are still kids and kids are cruel.”
“Ah,” said Vasily, his eyes darting to the man next to him, “well, Harry, I would like to know what’s troubling you. I wasn’t given much to go off of.”
Harry stopped and turn to face his friend. “What do you need, Draco?” he asked with a calm façade. “I didn’t hear you calling out.”
Harry chuckled and threw the letter down on his desk, “I’ll be flashy if I want Severus, let’s see you try and stop me.”
“Yeh always wait fer the Hippogriff ter make the firs’ move,” said Hagrid. “It’s polite, see? Yeh walk towards him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn’ bow, then get away from him sharpish, ‘cause those talons hurt.”
Harry shook his head and sat quietly in the chair, mentally adding another reason on why he held such a high disdain for Neville Longbottom. Any decent wizard would have paid and shrugged it off with a small smile, but not Longbottom, a leach, that’s what he was.
Harry was sitting quietly in the limousine which beared the Malfoy family crest on each door, the interior was a lush green and silver, the roof was decorated with soft velvet material and there was a small bar in the middle. The windows were spelled so that you could see out, but not in. Harry never thought the Malfoy family would use Muggle transport to and from their home, he always assumed they apparated to King’s Cross station.
He cleared his mind fully, pushing the pain in his head, which had since ceased throbbing so badly since he began brewing the potion, as if it new that he was working on it, out of his mind and counted to four before slowly adding the Angel’s Trumpet, which was by far the hardest step of the potion. The fear of said ingredient being pushed straight from his mind as he slowly stored the potion, watching the Angel’s Trumpet slowly dissolve. He leant over and examined the potion, almost laughing when he realized that it was the same colour as Weasley’s hair.
Ginny spluttered on the blood that slowly dripped down her face before wiping it with the sleeve of her robes. “Even if I fail, which won’t happen, you won’t get Dittany in time and this poor cut will be across poor Ginny’s face for life… maybe I won’t kill her when I get a new body, simply so she has a disfigured face for life.”
He didn’t give away his position just yet, but he was aware that Potter’s eyes fell on him for a split second and then towards the door. He lent against the wall quietly and observed what Potter was doing. He was aware that Potter continued in potions, but he couldn’t grasp why the boy would need to make a potion that no one else knew about it. Of course, the Slytherin side of Potter was to be appreciated when it wasn’t his stores that were being raided for the potion for that side to become active.
Harry had very recently turned five, not that he seemed at excited at all about it. Each year that he got older, the more restless that most of the closer people that knew him got. He still hadn’t said a word since he was about one. That word was simply the most common for a child to say, and it was mum. Even then, it was only said weakly and when he was sick with a high fever.
Harry watched as the hippogriff jumped onto its hind legs, its eyes staring directly at Draco, and lifted its front legs, ready to strike. He stumbled with the side of his robe, trying to find his wand to do something to protect his best friend from the creature that could do some massive damage if it landed a strike against flesh.
I need to brag! This chapter came out in around eleven days! Would have been eight if I did not get sick. Eleven! Ever since chapter four, it has been a month since each update release. Chapter twelve and thirteen had five months waiting period. I know that updates have been erratic and slow, which makes you active readers that are here each update on day one or two... I appreciate it.
Harry walked in with Draco and Blaise behind him, Harry walked up the classroom and smiled at his students, “good afternoon, sorry I was late, there were some complications, and as such I was not able to find out who was the first person here. I am sure a portrait will tell me after the lesson so Ill figure it out, I also realize Professor Snape is late also, I assume he held back his class, that’s alright we can start without him.”
Narcissa gave Harry a look, that same look that made people give her a wide birth when she was annoyed. “Now you listen here, I wear ribbons at social events, in my hair. Of course, it is Black tradition. So, they are not outdated and your fabulous hair would suit ribbons nicely.”
“Alright,” said Atieno, breaking the silence. “I think I know how to explain this without causing confusion. If there is anything I hate, it is people asking dumb questions. A reason why I hate debating anything with Salazar. That man is set in his ways without even considering anything said to counter any of his beliefs. Pertinacious, that one.”
James always praised his wife for being rather perceptive, even if it came as a hindrance later on. He found that she would say what exactly was on her mind, regardless of who it was about, but she was also gentle and caring.
. I then saw how corrupt and obscure this place is – didn’t matter what you did in the building, you’d report to the Minister every. Single. Day and he’d make sure you were doing what you were meant to. Mental.”
“I know…” said Neville, feeling somewhat bad for gesturing his friend over to look at them. “I just wanted another opinion, Ron.”
“He is,” said Fred with a slight shrug. “He may not be overboard with it and demand perfection, but he is precise with everything he does – wait a minute! George, didn’t we have a list of all the things he does that’s odd?”
Voldemort looked back at him and wove his hand, “Excellent, that is all I need of you, Lucius.” He exclaimed and went back to reading.
“The creation of spells slowed massively as a whole because the rules and demands were too imposing,” said Lily. “You were paid a small sum and your spell was placed in books around the world, if it was useful enough.”
“Harry is a ghost now, and not a student professor, any points taken and earned should be revoked.” Hermione said while playing with her hair.
“Spare me the details,” said Harry, grimacing. “You have a chance to actually get ahead in your studies and pull a few passing grades?”
“I dunno,” said Neville as he tried to peer over shoulders blocking his vision. “Something big, I’ll bet.”
“I never attended the prestigious school and because of that, I feel as if I should make up a version of my own using the knowledge of other people.”
“Big bad Gryffindor, you’re such a brute, you couldn’t hit me, and after all you know what my punch feels like.”
“Harry has always been like that, it was rather bad in his first year and I never exactly noticed it then, but as he grew so did his fidgetiness, he must move. In class he was allowed to move around, his studying fell flat because of it, he cannot sit around with nothing to do. Something must be in his hand that he can move and play around with. If Harry cannot move then he gets angry, and will take it out on himself.”
“Look,” said Neville, throwing his hands up in defeat. “Professor – it’s about the Philosopher’s Stone!”
“Sit down mister Malfoy,” Harry stood up and walked around collecting the various students work, “ah, you left your notes with the work, good job. Two points to Ravenclaw.”
“Also, I caught Draco zipping up Harry’s zipper,” said Narcissa, shrugging slightly. She made sure she had waited until her son had felt safe and secure that she wouldn’t say something. It was best that way. “He was slightly bent over, studying it as if it were his N.E.W.T.s. When I entered the room, I saw him tugging at it. I was rather confused on what was happening. At first, I assumed that –”
“A three-headed dog?” repeated Lily, looking confused. “What has that man been putting into that school? Also, how’d you know what was guarding this stone?”
“What we really need is a distraction,” said Hermione, her tone slightly tense. “Maybe we can avoid blaming anyone and just get the ingredients before Professor Snape realising that they were taken.”
“If it was hidden, wouldn’t the professors get suspicious that a bunch of students would randomly gather there?” said Draco, pacing back in front of the shelf and frowning when he was able to remain there. “I’m sitting here yet it’s not sending me away, maybe because I’m not –”
As he expected from the second he heard about it, he knew someone would aim to ruin it. He was very curious about who decided that making a duelling competition as safe and secure as possible was a good idea.
“What rubbish self-help book did you rip that from, Granger?” said Harry, clenching his fist. “I know I’m not gay, Granger, I could never be
dog would’ve instantly come, knowing that I, a human, wanted something. But you, doggy, are dumb and untrained.”
“Because we both know that you wouldn’t have understood or appreciated the jokes,” said Lily, smiling. “You’re a lot like me. You wouldn’t see the veiled humour in the jokes and you would quite simply just frown, trying to understand the concept of the joke, not the actual joke. I never really appreciated James’s sense of humour, and, according to his thought process, if I didn’t understand, you wouldn’t either. Let’s move onto another topic.”
Harry watched as the two Gryffindors approached the front of the classroom, their facial expressions saying it all. He knew how this was going to go. He had studied the nine spells, briefly, as they truly were the work of a spell creation genius. So simplistic, yet so complicated. It was also stable enough that it was used as the base for quite a few of the more popular spells.
“Ah! Right,” said Terence, wringing his hands. “I was just, uh, wondering if I was still on the team.”
“However, much like I had foreseen, it did not last long and the slightest inconvenience to the ‘truce’ completely unravelled it. Unlike all the other events that fuelled the animosity, the students – you – finally have something that you have witnessed and seen with your own eyes. Every single Slytherin student in this school feels slighted and wronged. It is now personal.
“Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Cornelius, looking rather alarmed. “Dumbledore suspended… no, no… last thing we want just now…”
“And this is a perfect way for Snape to get back at James Potter, using his own son to get the Quidditch Cup for Slytherin.”
“At first, I was trying to brew Angel’s Trumpet Draught,” he said calmly, an air of confidence surrounded him. “I had no idea what other ingredients to use so I just tossed in a few random things and what you have is what I made.”
“For his betrayal!” repeated Ron, stressing the words as much as he could. “Potter clearly betrayed Slytherin somehow, whether the heir or not and now he’s supposedly suffering for it. Maybe he betrayed people by petrifying them instead of killing them.”
“You should be clearer in the future, asking one out to tea could have many hidden meanings,” Draco informed him. “But of course I’ll come, where are we going?”
Draco had spent most of his days complaining about everything that he could, ranging from: All the work they had to do, especially over the holidays, the essays that Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall set, which were double the normal length, the excessive amount of theory that they were being provided instead of practical work and of course the fact that someone had taken his personal shampoo.
“Correct, but they’re blood-traitors and that’s why they should be removed,” said Theodore with a smirk. “They deplore their status on it, always have. They have mingled with Muggles, but never bred with them. A lot of families are missing from it, an example would be the Potters and the Princes. Well, the Potters aren’t pure anymore, due to your mother.”
However, he would not miss the opportunity to eavesdrop and somehow gain some insider knowledge into the new students entering Hogwarts, seeing as most of them seemed to know each other. Either he was missing something big with the next generation of witches and wizards or he was forgetting how quickly children can become friends and act as if they have known each other for years.
“Anyway, I think it has to do with the fact I was casting magic and the Ministry wasn’t swooping in from all directions,” said Harry, walking around a student. “He must’ve assumed that it was safe to tell me and the oath or whatever they used didn’t activate ‘cos it assumed I already knew. I mean, I did meet the condition of it without meeting the condition for it.”
“You missed us, anyway,” said Harry. “I saw you over there, looking at us with sadness in your eyes. The air around you was dark and damp –”
“I believe that everything will work out in the end,” said Severus, holding Harry firm. “You’ll just have to trust me on that, Lily. I don’t doubt that both you and James are natural fighters, not just spell or battle wise, but also survival wise. I’d sooner give up making potions then admit to anything less than that.”
“It cannot be him, Minerva, he’d never do something so utterly foolish to anger whatever the monster is doing!”
Tracey blushed slightly but pushed it aside. “You’re lucky to have a friend like Draco Malfoy, I have no one.”
I'm sorry for the delay. August is a very hard time for me. I've already finished it, but I just lack any kind of energy to check through it before I upload it. I'm sure this has plenty of obvious errors that I missed. :x You guys are great and will spot them.
Harry spent a vast majority of the day following the Golden Trio around, making use of his invisibility cloak. He watched as the three of them fidgeted and kept locking eyes with Professor Snape at dinner, which came a little earlier tonight, perhaps because the headmaster had left and Professor McGonagall, being deputy headmistresses, set it earlier than usual. He couldn’t help but think that it had to be about the Philosopher’s Stone, as a few professors were acting rather suspicious. He had hit a dead-end regarding the stone. He could either follow the Golden Trio under his cloak and swoop in and take it at the last second or assist them and swipe it when they were distracted.
“Ginny, please wake up,” muttered Neville desperately, shaking her. Ginny’s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.
“I think I understand,” said Harry, humming. “The whole point is to remember where you once were and where you soon will be. Everyone starts here, or around it.”
McGonagall stood and clapped, drawing all the attention from the students towards her, she waited for the chatter to stop before speaking. “Welcome back to Hogwarts, that’s one term down and that leaves three to go. This term we have some big changes and I’m very sure you all will enjoy them, we have done some cleaning up of old classrooms and that means theirs a few new classes to choose from, but this is for Dumbledore to announce and unfortunately he cannot be here today, but he will be back tomorrow. Classes will start at midday today and run through until dinner! This is just so you can adapt back to the schedule of the school curriculum. I’ll stop taking up your time now, enjoy your breakfast.” McGonagall smiled and plates of food filled the tables, she gave Harry a worried look and was thankful he was too busy in a daydream rather than focusing on her.
Harry had heard from Dudley that the people at Smeltings apparently missed him and his ability to put the teachers in their places, whatever that meant. He had also learned that the irate and brutish Physical Education teacher was still fuming to this day and handed out detentions instantly whenever anyone refused to listen or back talked him. He would be a liar if he said that this piece of news displeased him.
Harry kept sending Millicent Bulstrode curious glances as the slightly beefy woman glared at him, he did wonder how he had annoyed her.
“No problem,” said Theodore with a slight smile. “I’m sure that you know this, as I have personally seen you reading the book a few times that I’m related to Cantankerus Nott, the author of the Pure-Blood Directory, better known as the Sacred Twenty-Eight.”
“What if he cannot hear us?” blustered Neville, he dropped his eyes at the outburst, but other held his ground. “He may not hear us calling him.”
“Makes sense,” said Harry, halting his him. “While some have children during the war, most wait until it’s safe.”
“Ah!” said Harry, looking much like he knew what Rosier had been talking about. “Some of the team graduated, some expressed concern that their studies were falling behind, others said that it was no longer fun and the chance of being scouted wasn’t worth the dent to their N.E.W.T.s.”
“And this is my bedroom,” said Ron, pushing open a slightly chipped door that was directly on the staircase. He shuffled in and gestured inside the room. “It’s not much, but it’s a good and quiet place to sleep and unwind. It’s
Part one of his goal to get the diary was already completed, of course, but he had planned to get Longbottom away from the Gryffindor common room for an extended period of time. Where Longbottom went, Weasley followed.
Quick note: Chapter features multiple languages and hard to read accents, as well as some slight homophobic language.
“That may be so,” sneered Professor Snape. “But some of you are young and stupid. Capturing Pettigrew is an easy way to a position you want. Do not pursue Pettigrew!”
“I’ll postpone the duel for you,” said Nott as he shifted closer to the injured boy. “I know you want to do it right now, and you probably believe I think you’re weak, but I want it to be a fair duel. I don’t mind if I lose, but I don’t want to win because you’re not at full strength.”
Hermione shared a look with Neville and Ron, who were both shaking their heads with such force she was amazed they didn’t have a headache already. “It’s private –”
“And Longbottom held the diary for an extended period of time and never turned it in,” said Harry, sending Longbottom a smug grin. “Weasley I can forgive for not turning it in as she’s pathetic and most likely needed the support of a close friend, but Longbottom had zero reason to write in a diary that wrote back.”
Harry sat off to the side, smirking as the Golden Trio fought to free themselves from the plant. He had freed himself as soon as he landed, not trusting such a soft landing, or one that moved as soon as he landed on it. Maybe in the Muggle world, but this was the Wizarding world, and you just didn’t trust that sort of thing.
“Act your age!” said Draco, his gaze locked on the side of Harry’s head. “You walk around like an adult, you use big words and then mentally criticise people that don’t understand them, you act like you’re a judge and what you say is the final say, and you’re a massive hypocrite!”
“We start small and then we get bigger and bigger until she packs her trunk and leaves,” said Pansy. “She can go attend Beauxbatons with the other cheap, lowlife –”
“Beauxbatons can’t have agreed to this,” he said, putting the parchment down. “It was them who suffered the most and called the entire thing off, demanding that they are never invited to another one again.”
“After you remembered the Tournament, there was a quite potent Compulsion Charm to make you come here,” said Harry. “I have a feeling that a human wouldn’t be able to block either of the charms. I mean, not to brag, but I am about as gifted one can get in Occlumency and it still got by me without any chance to fight.”
Harry glanced up and sent Draco an odd look. “I’m not Muggle-born, Draco, I wouldn’t be petrified,” he said, smiling at Draco. “Thank you for your concern, though. I’m glad that you care about me.”
Harry lifted his voice into a perfect imitation of Weasley. “Professor Snape is gonna steal the Stone, ‘Mione!” he said, snickering. “My twenty brothers and I are decent wizards and deserve to go to Hogwarts.”
Harry realized why they were here and couldn’t help but shake, “I-I would like it if you came in with me.” Harry didn’t release Narcissa’s hand; he held it firmly until they reached his parent’s graves.
“Phineas worships me,” said Salazar. “He will not inform anyone that I am seeking to make changes to the staff. He will be honoured that he was able to speak to me, even in death.”
“I can hold them,” said Harry. “Once you do what you need to do, you can sweep back around and hit them from behind. That’s the plan.”
Harry smiled and watched his mother slowly walk towards the main Potter vault, most likely to collect some Galleons of her own. He copied her action and quickly vanished into his vault, the goblin had followed his mother, due to her vault needing more protection than his own. Despite what people assumed, his vault wasn’t lined with Galleons or priceless artefacts, even if he was somewhat wealthy, at least for his age. He slowly walked around a pile of Sickles and Knuts, with small amounts of Galleons near the large pile and stopped in front of the bookcase that was lined across the entire back wall of the vault.
“Truly?” said Severus, surprised. “Are you mentally capable or are you just saying that so I will allow you to leave? Because, as I am certain you are aware, a few days ago you were
“I did assume that you were counting and most of the time you were,” said Linfred, ignoring the boy. “You didn’t just stand there and count to four for no reason, you were always doing something that required the number. You do things in fours often, though, and you also look for an excuse to use that number for things.”
Draco placed the letter on his desk, he would send it tomorrow morning, he got undressed and climbed into bed, and he fell asleep not to long afterwards.
“Visy is love being with Mistress!” said Visy, her eyes going slightly larger. She buttered a piece of bread with strawberry jam and levitated it towards an awaiting plate. “Mistress being leaving now. Visy will clean.”
“Oh… it’s only you,” said Moaning Myrtle, looking at the three intruders sceptically. She was sitting on the cistern of the end toilet. “What do you want this time?”
“I was My Lord.” Lucius shifted uneasily, knowing he was rather discreet in the matter, but not much got past the old coot.
“Yes, that’s it, lie back,” said Lockhart, shifting Neville Longbottom into the position that he required, which wasn’t that different from how the boy was already sitting. “It’s a simple charm I’ve used countless times.”
“Should tell Filch, I should!” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”
Severus watched silently as Harry tugged Rosier and Draco Malfoy away by the sleeves of their robes, neither boys complained about being tugged away, and out the doors. He did wonder if the three boys would make it to potions on time, and how he could punish them if they didn’t. He glanced around and saw the startled looks on most of the faces of students, along with some professors who seemed to be frozen at the sheer outrage that had occurred.
The room remained quiet, as it did on such mornings where the entire household was busy reading and not talking to each other as no one had any social tendencies at all. Like most days, the quiet of the drawing room in Malfoy Manor lasted until Abraxas Malfoy limped in, his eyes narrowed onto the slouching boys and his cane hitting hardly against the doorframe. He muttered his usual complaints of his son not fulfilling the Malfoy goal, which was to earn money or influence, no matter the day.
James, who had shocked him by coming, was more like his usual self and resorted to joking and humour to attempt to cover his concern. It actually upset him that James’ joke about him being in Slytherin and that he should be cunning, not reckless like a Gryffindor made him smile. He was almost certain that it was James that kept his mother from going absolutely berserk this time around, so he was somewhat thankful for that.
“Doesn’t matter,” said Draco, laughing. “Harry’s taking every lesson so that he can, and I quote, ‘Be ahead of everyone else when graduating’.”
“We know that now,” said George. “But we didn’t before and that’s why we were being cautious. We took you under our glorious wings, taught you some secret passages –”
“Making himself look even more stupid than he already is. Although that wouldn’t take much, I can assure you he will fail his N.E.W.T.s easily next year, he’s in his sixth year, right?” asked Harry and smiled when Draco nodded. “Yeah, I bet you fifty chocolate frogs that he will fail his N.E.W.T.s.”
“It does and it will,” said Harry. “I don’t hold it against it, though. It seems to have realised that I’m off limits and actively avoids me, but I’m sure it’ll take the chance when it can. I’d rather just avoid it. It won’t seek me out like Death would, it will leave me be and wait until we cross paths.”
“Ah,” said Harry, unbothered. “Try your best to explain. If I get lost, I’ll just ask Draco later and he can translate. He can speak French.”
