Scorpius nodded. He had a lot to learn.
“The important bits,” he said, then muttered under his breath. “But maybe I’ll obliviate myself.”
“We cannot discount the effect this will have on the Malfoys’ loyalties in the war. They cannot harm you while you carry their blood. The ritual magic would not let them.”
Scorpius was a little disappointed, but soon the Headmistress was making a speech about new beginnings, and he struggled to listen through the rumbling of his stomach. Headmistress McGonagall enumerated the rules of the castle, which Scorpius memorized as best as he could.
Thank you all for your patience!

responsible. And it feels like a mistake.”
Once in a while, the headmistress would offer him the position of Defence professor. They didn’t have the same annual turnover that they used to, but most professors still lasted only two to three years on average. Harry usually skimmed that part of the letter, except this last year, when his eyes had lingered on the words.
Hogwarts was a spectre looming just over his shoulder.
“That’s a great idea,” Harry said, turning his head a little. “We could get some teachers in on it, too.”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “What?”
Ron made moon eyes in Hermione’s direction but she didn’t notice, and Harry pretended not to.
Scorpius gave him a weak smile. “But what if it was a mistake? I don’t really feel brave.”
Head of House give you a speech when you were first years? And if so, I’d like to know what they said.”
Snape interrupted his train of thought. “The potion might ensure conception, but it does not guarantee that the child will make it to term. They had to restrict it in the end. Repeated use often resulted in the bearer’s death. I don’t know how a student could have gotten their hands on one,” he added with a growl.
Most days, Scorpius spent on his studies. English and Latin and some rudimentary Runes, Basic Maths, Dark Arts and Defence, Potions, Charms, Transfiguration, Astronomy, Penmanship, Wizarding History and Etiquette, and in between the endless chores required around the house. Milking the goats, weeding the garden.
Lucy snorted. “You can just say his name.” She turned to Scorpius. “Our cousin Fred loves to prank people, and his father owns a joke shop. Consider this your first and last warning.”
“I’m taking you with me,” Scorpius said, chin tilted stubbornly.
Fred laughed, shrugging him off and turning to give him a wink, walking backwards down the corridor. “Sure, sure. I have nothing to hide, Uncle Harry. Nothing at all.”
Two girls stood at the door. “Hi! Can we share the carriage?” One of them asked. “We just need to escape our overbearing siblings.”
Scorpius shook his head. “I like it.”
Later, when Scorpius finally fell asleep, he tucked the threadbare blanket around the young boy’s shoulders. His hair was black, a little unruly, and so very much like his other father’s. But other than that, Scorpius took after his side. They had the same pointy chin, the same grey eyes. He wondered if that would prove a blessing or a curse.
Minerva shook her head. “I had other responsibilities then, though I suppose that sounds like an excuse now.” She mock-glared at Harry. “Do better than me, Mr. Potter. That’s an order.”
It never would have happened if England hadn’t won the Quidditch Cup that year.
Scorpius froze for a minute, before carefully petting the beast’s head. It let out a noise very much like a purr.
“Never,” Harry said with a laugh, before bowing to her and taking his leave.
Finally, the man gave up. “If the Dark Lord entered your brain right now, he would only pick up on your panic anyway.”
He closed his eyes and turned away, and he would have screamed in denial, except he was suddenly too busy spewing.
It took Harry about six months after Draco left before he could think past the pang of betrayal in his gut. Six months of working himself to the bone, case after case, until he practically slept at his desk. Hermione was starting to make these noises of concern that Harry was so good at ignoring, when Ron took matters into his own hands, dragging him to George’s place for a night of hard drinking and product testing.
The mechanics were a little complicated, but they managed.
George and Angelina had their own house in muggle London, warded to the hilt and regularly visited by overzealous Ministry inspectors—mostly Percy’s doing—as it was also where George’s lab was located.
He admired the glint of purple at the tip of Dominique’s quill, and the emerald green that Lucy was using, but refused their offers to share. Father would find it extravagant enough that he would waste supplies, though he could always say it was practice; his penmanship could use the work.
The sight outside the window caught his eye, and he gaped at it again. The toy lay forgotten in his hand as he looked out at the view, tiptoeing to see further.
Draco’s eyes were darker than usual. It took Harry a second to recognize the expression. He took another step back. “I’m as big as a whale, you idiot!” It wasn’t quite true, but he was feeling self-conscious as his bump grew bigger almost by the minute.
So much for his wishful thinking.
Malfoy ambushed him in a corner after breakfast. The git probably had access to hangover potions to look as fresh as a daisy after last night. Harry glared at him resentfully, crossing his arms. “What do you want?”
Harry glared at his best friend. “What?”
Hermione paged through a sheaf of notes she kept from past DA meetings. “I could try writing a proposal, but Harry, you can’t even sit in as an observer. Especially not with the kind of spells we’re working on. We might need more instructors from the other years.”
The headmaster had enforced a rule that all weddings would take place after exams. This pleased Hermione and most of the Ravenclaws, and the seventh years, but little else.
But saying it out loud was one thing. It took a few more months before Harry could talk himself into looking. He didn’t say anything to Ron or Hermione; he knew they knew and that was enough.
There was a whole world framed by that window. Buildings beyond buildings. Lights so bright the sky looked robbed of stars. He gaped at it, and would have stood there the entire night, but he heard a sound behind him.
The green light of the killing curse met the red of his stunner. Their wands connected like it did that night at the graveyard.
When the hat shouted, “Gryffindor,” Harry could not help but feel a leap under his chest. Something like pride mixed with the intense curiosity being kindled there.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t think so. I just feel responsible. No, I
Scorpius’ mouth dropped open. “Show me how you did that?”
It felt strange to sit at the table inside the library and write a letter to his father a few flights of stairs away, but when Lucy and Dominique had taken out their special parchment and inkwells with special coloured ink, Scorpius could not think up a reasonable excuse.
After he left, Scorpius stole one last look out the window before retracing his steps. He hadn’t had the chance to look at where he stepped from, but now he could see that it was one of the few things in the room not covered by a cloth. It was a trunk, battered but solid-looking, in faded green with gold tassels and latch.
“The majority of the pregnancies are pureblood families,” Ron reminded them. “The only reason the war started in the first place was because pureblood numbers were dwindling in proportion to muggleborn. People won’t buy into that propaganda if they feel less threatened about being overrun by outsiders. And the new alliances means traditionally feuding groups will now be connected, even if it’s only Lord so-and-so’s nephew with Lady so-and-so’s cousin’s granddaughter. They would have more incentive to protect each other.
Scorpius learned that fact even before he mastered his letters. Every night, Father had a ritual of walking clockwise from room to room, speaking protection spells. Kreacher brought him large books every few weeks or months that he would pore over, and there would be new spells. Sometimes they made the hair on Scorpius’ arms stand up. Sometimes, the back of his neck would itch, or he would sneeze and sneeze.
It was a light laugh, a very human laugh, and not mean at all. The creature had doubled over, clutching its stomach.
He stopped himself from craning his neck as he watched the child sit under the hat and be sorted. His features were Malfoy’s through and through, and it was like no time at all had passed since Harry’s own years at Hogwarts. But he could see nothing of the arrogance that Draco Malfoy had exuded when they met. Scorpius’ face reminded Harry of his own uncertainty when he first stepped foot here. He looked lost and wary.
As soon as he heard the name Scorpius Black, Harry felt his hair stand on end.
But Teddy took his hand out again, then offered something to him. Scorpius looked down.
want to know is if I’m invited at all. And I hope Sirius made provisions for the safety of your muggleborn friend while in your future husband’s home.” Her smile was sharp.
Okay. Admittedly, Harry had never attended a muggle wedding either, so he didn’t really know what to expect.
At the door, Angelina greeted Harry with a punch to his shoulder and a nod. Their one-year old son, Fred had little use for words yet, but liked to zoom around the house like he had swallowed bees, so she had little attention to spare for the men trooping into her living room. And from the looks of him, George had started the party a bit early.
She was a very pretty girl with strawberry blonde hair loose around her face, and Scorpius found himself nodding dumbly. The other girl had darker red hair, slicked back into a severe bun. She looked like she was part of the group he had been observing earlier. And in fact, the two of them had the same eyes.
“I remember,” Harry muttered.
Teddy looked down at his hand. “You’re a little too young to play with a wand, aren’t you? Do you even know any spells?”
“That’s not a real word,” Scorpius declared loftily.
Kreacher appeared with a pop, dressed in a blue tea towel. The house elf met his eyes for a long moment, then straightened to his full height before saying, “I see you’ve finally met Young Master Black.”
With Voldemort’s return casting a long shadow over things—and with Umbridge going power-mad—classes were hard enough to sit through. Now, however, Harry’s attention wandered for an entirely different reason.
Draco took two steps forward, cradled Harry’s head in his hands, and kissed him senseless.
Harry felt power explode out of him. A bright light washed over him, bright yellow tinged with red, and warm, like a phoenix had burst into flames.
Harry didn’t have the attention to spare to the chaos around them. His eyes were locked with Voldemort’s, as was his wand. But still, he felt Draco moving towards him, and from the corner of his eye, the wash of green that carried with it the promise of death.
Malfoy’s face shutters, his mercury gaze freezing into a familiar iciness. “Why wouldn’t I be?” He bites.
“Sometimes,” Draco says, tracing across Harry’s forearm with his index finger. “Sometimes I forget how possessive you are.” He lays his chin on Harry’s bicep.
“I hate you too,” he says. “Kiss me.”
Ron stares back at him, blue eyes swimming with hurt as his features deflate. They stare at each other, long and hard. Harry feels a warm lump in his throat he can’t swallow down; suddenly, he feels itchy all over.
“Need the room do you, Potter?” Draco juts out his bruised chin towards him. “Best leave you to it then.”
Draco scoffs. “No, no, no,” he says, folding his arms across his chest, turning his chin away with a pout. “I slept with someone else that year, that would mean I cheated and I’m not a cheater.”
a Muggle game, he probably learned it at the orphanage he grew up at.
Draco tilts his head down, turns his cheek, resting it on Harry’s bicep. “No,” he says, turning his head until his lips sit on the tense muscle. He bites down, softly at first and then harshly – earning a groan from the back of Harry’s throat. “But I don’t think I would have tried sleeping with you again if it didn’t happen.”
Conflict is a part of human relationships, the best thing we can do for ourselves and each other is figure out ways to address conflict from a place of genuine empathy.
This is so fucking stupid. Sorry. Whatever. This is stupid I don’t even know if I’m going to send this.
“Really?” Draco tilts his head, blond eyebrow arched, lip curled upward. “Show me, then,” he says, taking two fingers and trailing them down Harry’s body, curling into the front of his denims. “Show me how much you want me.”
I’m sorry to hear you also lost your Godfather to war. It’s an awful thing, war. I still have nightmares. Did I ever meet your Godfather? It is kind of nice to know someone else understands what it’s like to lose a loved one during war. Ron lost Fred, I’m sure you remember Fred? He was George’s twin. It’s been really hard on the entire Weasley family, actually. I don’t know what to do half the time I’m at The Burrow. The suffering is so, well, it’s like I can taste it in the air almost. But, it’s different too. Ron lost his brother. I lost the closest thing I ever had to a father.
Harry moves to his fridge and feels the burn of Draco’s eyes on him the whole time. It stirs something in him like it always does, but he ignores it like he never has before. He pulls two cans of coke from his fridge, hands one to Draco, before cracking the other one open.
Hermione tenses. “No,” she says. “Maybe. I don’t know.”
Harry slides his fingers, curling them, starting a slow rhythm, beckoning Draco towards his own pleasure – towards a pleasure that’s theirs to share. Draco’s hand is still wrapped around Harry’s wrist, and he squeezes gently with every drag of Harry’s fingers.
“You’re not going to make a big deal of this, are you?” Draco drawls, white eyebrow quirked up, eyes wide with what Harry thinks is panic.
Harry lets out a huff of air that quickly turns into a gasp at the feel of Draco’s hand palming him through his trousers. They kiss and it’s wet and messy and everything Harry needs right now. Draco keeps palming Harry’s crotch, seeming to relish in the noises Harry keeps making.
Draco licks his lips, dragging his tongue slowly across his bottom lip. “One day – one day, I won’t get so sick when I try to put it into words –” Draco sniffs. “– one day, I’ll own it and I’ll tell you all about it. One day, you’ll know you are more than enough.” His eyes water and he blinks rapidly.
Harry tilts his head, and Draco grimaces, sitting up and pushing him away, away, always fucking away.
“Fuck me,” Harry gasps out, but Draco’s already inside of him when he asks so instead, he wraps his legs around Draco’s hips and burrows his head up into Draco’s shoulder.
“When she said to me, ‘I forgive you, but I don’t accept your apology.’ I realised then what I was doing.”
“Come,” Draco beacons, with his hand held out for Harry. Harry goes, taking Draco’s hand in his, and accepting the spliff he offers him.
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Alright, yeah.”
“It’s not about
(See the end of the chapter for
“She wanted to know about the cakes –” Draco takes a hand and rubs it down his face, takes the pendant necklace his mother gave him and fiddles with it. “– I would go down and I would give her different flavoured cakes and she wanted to know why I gave them to her. So, I told her.”
“More, please, I want – I need, more.”
Harry blinks. A part of him thinks it can’t be that easy, that it can’t be this simple.
Harry slowly slides himself into Draco’s inviting heat and the two men groan in unison. Harry breathes long and hard, focusing on calming himself down. “Jesus, you feel amazing, Draco.”
“A kneazle?”
“Harry!”
think.”
Luna smiles at him. “Tears taken are very different from tears shared.”
You can find them at your local record shop, you may need to ask around to find one. It comes with headphones (that play music right into your ears). You press the triangle to play, and the square to stop. There's a button to open it up and put the CD in (shiny smooth part goes down) and a dial that controls the volume.
Before Harry could re-examine the invitation, Ron answered for him. “There’s only so many places you can hold a wizarding wedding safely, so it’s either at the Malfoy Manor or Grimmauld Place.”
“Dumbledore should have just held a mass wedding here,” Hermione said. “That would be the most efficient and least disruptive way to do it, instead of having to schedule the next few months to attend so many weddings. I mean, imagine how many dress robes you’d need.”
But when he let the toy roll down the string, it didn’t go back up. Teddy laughed, which made him angry. “It’s okay. It takes a few tries. You need to do it faster. At least the first few times.” He removed the toy and winded the string up again.
Scorpius was wary of being tricked, but there was a note of uncertainty in Teddy’s voice. “What is it?”
Draco bit his lip. “Some of them did. Some people are cruel to others for the slightest excuse. But there were others who loved him as he was. And he had a good heart, so animals knew to come to him if they broke a wing or sprained a leg. He looked after even the ugliest creatures there ever was. Because he knew what it felt like to be judged for your looks.”
A flicker at the edge of his vision made him turn around too fast, and he blinked a little as the world tilted. There was an owl at the window, brown-flecked, with large yellow eyes and tufted ears. A letter was clasped in its right claw. Draco spared a thought to how the owl had gotten into the trunk, but its beady glare urged him onwards.
“No, we’re cousins,” they explained, neither looking bothered by his rudeness. They introduced themselves as Dominique and Lucy Weasley. Scorpius shook their hands, giving them his name.
The little garden inside the trunk was his favourite place to be in the world. Scorpius could name every plant in it and spent a lot of his childhood weeding and harvesting vegetables to grace their table. The weather inside the trunk was borrowed from a mild countryside, and it was similar in feel to the Greenhouse.
Malfoy inclined his head and led him to an empty classroom. Harry felt the spot between his shoulders itch. He took a deep breath.
Harry grinned at her. He understood that perfectly, having had to listen to his share of patronizing iterations of ‘my dear boy’ and ‘this is how it’s always been done, Mr. Potter’ at the Ministry. He took his seat and poured for them both.
Draco had been reading the same line for hours, his chair turned towards the door. He stood as soon as he heard his son’s footsteps. Scorpius ran down the steps and into his open arms.
“Yes, Ron,” Hermione agreed. “Whatever our allegiances, war is coming. Better that we fight here and now under somewhat controlled conditions. Maybe we could even see what the Slytherins are capable of.”
Later, watching over his sleeping son, Draco brushed the strands on his forehead, ignoring the glare of Ceres, who was curled up on top of the blanket. “I’m sorry, darling. I didn’t want to be a burden to you.”
Draco suppressed the groan. Of course. It must be Weasleys.
Scorpius thought.
Beside him, Draco had also grabbed at his wand, but there was a danger in disrupting such spells, and Harry was especially vulnerable in his current state.
Harry wasn’t sure what that was, but he could hazard a guess. “So we never talk about it? Right. All settled then? I’m off to class.” And he walked away.
“We will spend most of our time in this room and in other Greenhouses that are spelled to a particular climate,” the professor was saying. “Hogwarts does have various outdoor gardens, some of which are out of bounds, so keep that in mind when you are exploring. This late in the year, we will focus on proper harvesting techniques first, though for some plants we have specimens in various stages of growth so you will learn to recognize them in any season…”
Harry turned back to face Draco, settling Molly in his lap. He looked up and caught sight of Draco's panicked expression. "Draco? What is it?"
The paramedic nods and pats his arm. “Everyone’s okay. The police are getting statements right now, alright? We’ll figure out what happened. But everyone’s safe.”
“Good money.” Harry shrugged. “Endless grounds to discover. It’s not like he comes here, so I wasn’t particularly bothered.”
He looks over at Draco, who looks just as bewildered as Harry does, his irritation at Harry’s curriculum forgotten.
Draco sat in the silence of his office for a minute before standing and pulling out his wand. He didn't think he'd be returning to this office any time soon. He'd only come in the first place to pick up a file Harry'd forgotten to take home with him last week. Draco waved his wand and orchestrated the packing of his things into conjured boxes. With one last flick of his wand, a stripe of tape sealed the last box. Draco levitated the boxes and walked out of the Unspeakable Department with them trailing behind him. Wilson was no where to be seen.
“Okay,” Harry says, stroking his fingers over Draco’s cheekbone. “We’ll get it all figured out, okay? I promise. It’s all going to be okay.”
Most nights, Draco is quiet and warm. Most nights, he turns down the covers and curls against Harry's back in the same way he's been doing since they were nineteen and still hurting. They are older now, and still hurting. But the hurt is quieter, and the warmth of the little house - deep in nowhere, astride the lines of the sea - is brighter. Harry says so to Draco one night, when they are both lying in bed and Draco is breathing deeply to feel his chest rise and fall against the blades of Harry's shoulders.
"Take a break," Harry murmured to him, tugging on his hand and pleading him with his eyes. "Let Archie go home."
"Something wrong?" Draco asked.
Harry barely hesitated before launching himself into Draco's arms and squashing him into the bed. His nose, cold at the tip, shoved into Draco's neck along with a dry heave and then a hot smudge of tears rubbed into Draco's skin.
Bailey kept grinning. “Yes, she told me to come in and wait for you.”
"But you think I should." It wasn't a question.
There he spent the rest of his daylit hours, reading and avoiding Harry.
“Probably not.”
"Draco."
to Harry, which was all he felt like he really needed to say anyways. The rest was something Draco payed attention to because it made Harry's eyes bright when Draco would sign something to him, and Harry would be able to respond, and they could feel like they were close.
Jane shakes her head, still looking confused. “So?”
Harry blinked. "Yes, of course. Thank you."
"Yes," Draco said. He wiggled his toes under Harry's bum. He couldn't feel the pressure of Harry's weight or the heat from his body. "But with you it's different. I've never had to pretend to be something different than what I am with you."
"Early mornin', Molly," Draco sang in a hushed tone. "What's wrong, little darling?"
Draco holds on tight, and Harry holds on tight, words still tumbling out of his mouth, and the world blows itself out into something not quite tangible.
Wilson sent another letter to Draco. Well, he sent it to Harry, but Harry held it in front of Draco's face for him to read.
“You are missing from me,” Draco cuts into Harry’s sentence. And because the isolation has made him brave, he says, “It is more than ‘I miss you.’ It is that you have become a piece of me, and you’re apart from me, and-” Draco stops himself and flushes furiously, although there’s no one around to see him.
Harry can only nod. Words have abandoned him.
Draco scoffs, and is pleased when Harry’s distant laughter joins his.
Harry took him to dinner, a nice dinner, with Ron and Hermione.
They dressed, kissing and holding on to each other, nearly falling over with laughter. Okay, Harry kept saying over and over. Okay, okay. Draco had his hands on either side of Harry’s face, and wouldn’t let go. Harry buttoned Draco’s coat up over his stomach, still kissing and letting Draco hold onto him.
“I know. But I want to be married to you now.” Harry inhaled deeply. “I want to be married to you yesterday already.”
Draco blew out a breath and folded the letter back up. He stared up at the arching ceilings of his room before unfolding the letter and reading it over again.
Harry leaned further back into the couch and began to circle the tips of his fingers over the bunched seam of Draco's trousers at the joint of his knee. He looked at Draco, his gaze slow and careful. "I'm not going to leave you here. I'll just firecall Ron and reschedule. Then I can stay here and take care of you."
Draco didn't feel anything wrong yet. Yes, his throat hurt, and his bones felt as if an erumpment had been sitting on them for several hours, and possibly his head was still pounding. But he didn't feel like he was dying. Draco wasn't ready to die.
Draco stopped swirling his arms through the remaining bubbles. "What?"
Harry faced out at the rain, pattering down into the evergreens. "You can Apparate back to base, Draco."
“I will ensure that Mister Malfoy is properly disciplined, now if you’ll excuse us Filch, I must discuss the matter with Mister Malfoy,” McGonagall responded.
Potter gave him a curious look, like he was deciphering a puzzle. Malfoy returned it. They hadn’t spoken since the Room of Requirement, which felt like a lifetime ago.
Draco contemplated responding. It would be so easy to prod back at him and escalate things. He couldn’t risk anymore trouble by starting a fight with Potter. He sighed. “Yeah, me, Pansy and Blaise are grabbing butterbeers at the Hog’s Head.”
“Yeah Malfoy, back to the task at hand,” Ernie Macmillan mocked. Justin Fletchley gave him a sneer.
Draco chuckled. Despite their flaws, Pansy and Blaise never failed to get a laugh out of him.
“Detention! Detention for a month! Students thieving in the castle, unacceptable!” Filch roared. Ms Norris glared at Draco with her beady eyes.
Snape’s replacement sighed, something like this happened nearly every class now, “Can whoever took Mr Malfoy’s chair please return it, thank you.”
From his creaky oak desk Draco could hear the waves lapping against the dungeons window and see the occasional Grindylow swim by.
“Merlin,”Harry agreed, a first for the two of them.
“Malfoy apologizing or Malfoy almost not being a git?” Harry laughed
He stepped out of the shadows joining her by the door.
Draco mulled for a moment, debating what he wanted to say.  “Professor, can I ask you a question?”
“Yes, I’ve read about it quite a bit, it’s an extensive process. Quite tricky too. Takes at least a month and the consequences for a failed transformation can be awful.” Hermione of course knew plenty about the subject.
“Anyways,” Blaise leaned in, lowering his voice, “we need to figure out how to get into Filch’s storage.”
This sequestered alcove tucked away in the Slytherin dungeons made the perfect hideaway, even though the stony walls were crumbling in places and the formerly pristine carpets and house banners have the occasional burn mark. The remnants of hard fought duels.
“Check the other drawers,” Draco tells her.
Professor McGonagall peeled open the scroll, giving him a disappointed head shake.
Everyday after class Malfoy rushed straight back to his dorm and slept the rest of the day away. After the castle had settled for the evening he would sneak down to the kitchens and grab leftovers from supper. During the first weeks of school he tried to join everyone in the Great Hall. This just invited more pranks and jeers. Nobody, not even the rest of the Slytherins wanted him there except for Blaise and Pansy. He was a stain on their already tarnished reputation. Sometimes he wished he’d transferred to Durmstrang with Goyle.
Draco protested, “Get your hands off of me!”
“Both?” Draco responded giving them a smirk.
“Bloody hell, why couldn’t we write about something easier. Something other than human transformation.”
“Ah Draco good, you can help me prepare this afternoon's lesson,” the professor noticed him and waved him over.
He wondered what it must be like to see the entire world from above, riding the currents from one city to another. Then to huddle up together in a fluffy ball of wings and beaks at the end of a long day. ‘The freedom of it all,’ he thought.
“I know,” she told him before hoisting her book bag leaving him alone at the table.
Granger dropped her bag with a thud back down in her seat. The class emptied leaving the professor, Draco and Hermione.
“Draco what are you gonna do if there isn’t one?” Pansy asked.
“Yeah, that should work,” Blaise added with a sly troublemaking grin, “I’ve gotta couple of the Weasleys’ finest dungbombs in my trunk.”
He let out a yawn. Blaise must’ve left for continental breakfast in the Great hall. His blankets were thrown haphazardly on the empty bed.
“How is it my fault? You're the one that couldn’t keep your mouth shut Malfoy!”
“Didn’t Daphne give’er a go this summer?” Weasley asked Draco.
The class went silent.
Pansy checked her timepiece. “It’s go time,” she whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione’s face dropped.
“Draco are you sure it’s worth the risk? If you don't register yourself they could throw you in Azkaban.” Pansy is half questioning, half pleading with him. ”The ministry is just looking for an excuse to do it, and you know it.”
“Wonder what that muggle lover wanted with it?” Pansy pondered with her usual level of tact.
“Think Draco, think…” he pleaded with himself, “ figure it out you bloody idiot.”
Filch gave Draco one last death stare on the way out.
“Amato Animo Animato Animagus,” Draco tried not to trip over his tongue.
“Are you ever going to join us for breakfast? I miss your company Draco,” she asked.
“Sir! Peeves is dropping dungbombs outside the library!”
He gave a pained smile to his mates. “Mmmmm mandrake leaf.”
It took both of them a few moments to land on an offending column. A picture of his father in signature prisoner’s robes was juxtaposed with the image of him in the Malfoy manor gardens with a glass of liquor. “Death Eaters running free? Lucius Malfoy enjoys orchards at luxurious Malfoy Mansion”. Draco knew that his father was day-drunk and probably hadn’t left the manor in weeks, months even. Not that it mattered where you were, when you were drinking that much. He couldn’t help the flush in his cheeks. There was no hiding it on his gaunt skin, so he ducked his head.
This hidden part of the forest seemed insignificant compared to the mounting irritation over a detention with Potter or the shock of finding the deceased unicorn in a pool of silver blood.
‘Okay ,’he thought, ‘let's get this over with. Just a month. Then peace and quiet.’
The three of them looked at him like he was Snape in a lacy ballgown.
“Merlin,” Draco muttered.
Draco pieced together the steps for his transformation. On a piece of scrap parchment pulled from his leather satchel he wrote:
Then ten.
He took care to enter the woods far from Hagrid’s hut, slipping through the underbrush. Draco then followed the forest's edge back to where he, Potter, Weasley, Granger and Hagrid entered during their first year detention. The forest was overgrown with tall shrubs that made for tough work bushwacking. Thorns tore at his robes.
“I biht my tongghh,” was his excuse to anyone who asked.
“And how is Mrs Zabini? You’ll have to give her my best wishes.” Mrs Zabini was infamous for her many failed marriages and inherited wealth.
“Draco, if you should have interest, or a need for assistance in transfigurations studies, you need only ask.”
“Imagine spending all that time just to become a pig,” Blaise jeered.
“Professor, Malfoy isn’t practicing,” a dark haired ravenclaw girl called out. All the eyes in the hall locked onto Draco.
“I bet I could cut you a mandrake leaf in herbology tomorrow,” suggested Blaise”, doubt ole’ Sprout would notice.”
“Absolutely, sir!” Blaise flashed him a suspiciously bright smile.
“Blimey,” Blaise said, “ what happened mate?” Emerald green lanterns casted a eerily glow over the dark common room. It was empty except for Draco, his friends and two first years together on the sofas.
“Erm… thanks Malfoy.” Hermione sputtered.
“Gotten what?” Draco asked. Weasley and Potter gaped at him, in surprise.
“We could give peeves some dungbombs, that oughta do it.”
Draco hadn’t heard that one before but knew that when the transformation went wrong it could be disastrous for one's sanity and dignity.
Draco slid the leaf into his mouth, instantly tasting bitter and sour combined. He pushed the leaf into his cheek like a chipmunk trying not to gag or retch.
‘Files...Notes...Peeves…merlin’s beard, an entire cabinet dedicated to Peeves?!’ he continued on, ‘Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes...Punishment...Confiscated and Highly Dangerous...Miscellaneous.’
“Granger if you could stay a moment.”
“Yeah at least there's that.”
Pansy and Draco hid in the shadows behind a column facing Filch’s storage room. Draco coughed into his robe. The stone was damp creating a musty stench. Filch’s door was cracked open and a tiny sliver of dim flickering light peeked out.
Blaise cackled while Pansy pretended to retch into the budding Asphodel flower pot.
Also after the next chapter there's gonna be a two week hiatus. I'm canoe tripping and won't have any form of cellular/wifi to update.
“Draco! Draco I found one!” Pansy opened her hand to show him. It was bigger than the books said.
Potions was still his favourite class of the day, despite the loss of Professor Snape. The bubbling cauldrons and smoke filled dungeons always found him in a better mood. Draco’s workstation was always tampered with by his classmates. Despite their reputation, there were quite a few hufflepuffs with a nasty disposition and a love of pranks. Justin Finch Fletchley and his girlfriend Helena seemed to enjoy watching potions explode in his face or put off noxious fumes. His mum was bitten by Fenrir Greyback during the war and he definitely wasn’t a fan of former death eaters.
He enjoyed teasing her. They dated on and off a few years back but he never felt the same for her as she did for him. Pansy was much more like a sister. His parents still adored her and seemed to expect that they would end up together. Every time he returned to the manor they never forgot to ask about their status.
“Dinner, Nagini,” a voice whispered. He could hear it as though the man was right behind him, saying it into his year.
Draco sat and pulled out his textbooks.
Draco tried to remember his dream which was already fading away. He could only recall the sensation of soaring high in the sky. A far cry from the usual dreams that tormented him with the images of death and destruction he had caused. Katie Bell lying limp in the hospital ward, Professor Dumbledore falling from the sky or Crabbe descending into a pillar of flame.
Draco thought for a moment, standing beside the table. “Granger… Hermione, I need to apologize for what I said yesterday. It was rude. I didn’t mean it.”
“Yeah thanks mate. The next full moon should be…” Draco pulled out a lunar calendar from his divination notes, “in five days from now.”
“I got myself a copy of the ‘The Prophet’ and my mum sent a package of sweets. What’s in yours?”
“What do we have here? Looks like we’ve caught a thief tonight…” Filch said, smiling full of glee.
“You just had to tell Professor McGonagall abou---”
“Blecch,” she moaned, “that's so nasty I can't believe you actually want to do this Draco.”
“Personal interest... I don’t expect you lot to understand,”Draco just gave them a shoulder shrug and kept flipping through the ancient pages of Animagus Transformations: Quick and Easy (First Edition). Some of the pages were coated in a layer of dust like it hadn’t been opened in many years. It was true that most witches and wizards thought becoming an animagus was a useless and tedious task that only the backward would undertake.
‘If I were old, decrepit Argus Filch, where would I put a weird butterfly egg thingy?’ he thought to himself.
He spotted Granger sitting opposite Weasley and Potter at an oak table. Of course she wasn’t alone. This was going to be embarrassing. An apology was in order.
They wandered aimlessly throwing insults at each other letting the hound guide them.
Filch grabbed the collar of his robes, dragging him out.
Justin answered, “Why should I tell a death eater?”
He set down his wand shakily and decided to study for Transfigurations. He read half a chapter before he was interrupted.
They sorted chess pieces, matches, teapots and dinner plates into labelled containers. Draco moved more mice than he could count into a wide glass aquarium on a table at the front.
“Ugh…fine I guess, but only tomorrow”
HMU on twitter @milchier
“Have a seat.” Hermione offered him the chair next to hers. She definitely wasn’t happy to see him but that was expected. His apology seemed to have created some small peace.
“Old suck up,” he muttered, plopping down on the couch beside Pansy. He was sipping a cup of earl grey that wafted through the air.
Head in hands, he sighed, cursing himself. “Just get through this month,”Draco muttered, “and then it’ll be okay.” He tried to convince himself of it. Just until he could get his animagus. Then he’d be free to do what he wanted, go where he wanted, put his past behind him if only for a while.
Easy to laugh when you’re not about to be an animagus.
McGonagall couldn’t hide her surprise. The student that just failed his assessment and was on track to fail his Transfigurations N.E.W.T.S. was interested in a complex and difficult piece of transfiguration magic.
The day continued with a jelly filled scone from the kitchens. He ate alone except for a few house elves scurrying in and out carrying teetering platters. Draco cracked open his tremendously heavy transfiguration textbook. His adventure in the forbidden forest left him too tired last night to prepare for tomorrow’s summative. Professor McGonagall’s wasn’t one for empty threats. Draco believed she would seriously assign him a study partner, a terrifying prospect.
He sighed, trying to numb himself.
Hermione tried to diffuse the tension adding, “Really? The butterbeers at the Three Broomsticks are loads better!”
“Oh mattress how I've missed you,” Blaise cooed, making Draco snort.
He must’ve been making faces at his food because Pansy asked him, “Everything tasting alright there Draco, you look like you’ve eaten a mandrake.”
Fang trotted up to the base of the falls lapping water. Potter kneeled down to examine a group of odd plants growing alongside. They were covered in fine droplets created by the waterfall’s spray.
“What did your owl bring?” Blaise asked her.
The towering trees groaned as they swayed over the two boys walking through the mist covered underbrush.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yea, Pansy found the chrysalis and got out without Filch noticing, but I’ve got detention with McGonagall for a fortnight.” Draco told him.
“I caught the boy snooping in my quarters, Minerva.”
On the full moon: place a mandrake leaf in your mouth,
Draco instantly pulled his wand preparing himself. He scanned the brush for movement, crouching down.
Hope y'all enjoy the chapter <3. Lemme know what you think in the comments! Also has anybody read a court of thorns and roses because IT'S SO GOOD AND V SPICY definitely recommend.
“Any ideas as to how we’ll get in?” Draco asked.
“I understand Professor.” Draco couldn’t meet her eyes.
Before he began the process Draco expected that he would wake up and feel different somehow. But nothing was out of place. His routine had changed however, starting with the incantation and continuing with a cleaning spell. After starting the transformation process he neglected to consider that with the mandrake leaf in his mouth constantly he wouldn’t be able to brush his teeth. After a quick excursion to the library and a bizarre book filled entirely with personal hygiene spells he discovered two spells. A tooth cleaning and breath freshening spell which he cast. It became part of his dawn and dusk rituals.
Draco nodded then took off speeding to the Slytherin dungeon.
“Mmm,” he went silent, not wanting to reveal any more.
After Weasley and Potter left, Granger checked over his work. She made a few suggestions but otherwise seemed satisfied.
Draco usually took his owls in the owlery. Too often he’d received a disappointed letter from his father in front of the entire school. After the third time, he’d stopped taking it in the Great Hall.
From the quidditch pitch he could already hear the hum of several hundred excited witches and wizards accompanied by the voice of an announcer. He guessed there was at least two hours before the game might end.
They put their heads down, working on the essays. Draco could barely think. How bizarre it was to sit with his former enemies and study together. He stalled out after the first paragraph. The quill, almost dripping with ink, waited for him to start again.
They find a quick-paced, delectable rhythm after that. Harry alternates between harsh, shallow thrusts and hard, deep, slow thrusts that have Draco writhing underneath him.
“How dare you!” Molly roars. “Harry, more than anyone, has been going through such a difficult time. How dare you suggest he has malicious intentions!”
“Let’s not be delusional here. Blaise, he’s still too much of a good-boy Gryffindor for this kind of stuff.” Pansy’s eyes are wide, and her smile is teasing. “Right, Draco?”
“Wait for you to come back.”
forever scarred into it, and gently touches Draco’s cheek – it’s a tentative touch, and intentionally so.
“You’re not allowed,” Harry gasps as Draco bites and sucks down into his neck.
When Draco turns on the faucet Harry says, “You don’t have to do that.”
I feel like Draco carefully considers these things. Just my general thoughts, haha.
But the thing about this desire, is that it had been growing for years. It was tentative at first, something twisted that made Harry feel ashamed but then it had morphed into something else altogether when Harry had seen the ways in which Draco had softened. With Draco’s growth came Harry’s mounting want, with Draco’s newfound delicate nature came Harry’s overflowing curiosity.
I still miss Sirius, but it gets better - it still hurts to remember the good times, but not so much that I can’t look back on our memories together fondly. Actually, when I lost him, right before 6th year, it really fucked me up, Draco. I stalked you that whole year, you know? I was convinced you were a Death Eater, and I needed some sort of control on my life after losing the only family I felt I had left. It was really hard and it made me do crazy, stupid shit. I am really sorry about Sectumsempra. That shit was so fucked up. The whole war was.
Draco stiffens. “Are you?” Harry wonders if Draco can feel the way his heart beats rapidly in his chest.
The in-between goes a little like this:
“You like that?” Harry asks, not because he’s unsure but precisely because he already knows the answer.
“Doesn’t that bother you?”
"So, you're admitting to using right alongside him?" Ron stands as well. "Mate, we just want to
Harry can’t stop himself from saying, “Good.”
Harry wants to say that he wasn’t worried. Not at all, actually, because he doesn’t give a fuck if Malfoy thinks of him enough to roll him a spliff. Instead, he says, “Thanks,” and takes his usual spot by Malfoy’s feet.
Hi! I've been gone a while, lol.
“Rumour has it you and Malfoy have been up there shagging,” Seamus says, dealing out a game of Exploding Snap. “Although, by the look on your face I’d say you’ve been up there fighting.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s stomach growls at him as he makes his way down the cobblestone steps that lead to the common room. He wonders what he’ll be able to steal from the kitchens and scratches at the back of his neck.
CW: Recreational Drug Use/Drinking
“He listens.” Dean uses the spliff slotted between his fingers to point at the door.
Tonight, could have been...something, but instead it’s this.
“He doesn’t need to know about fashion, Draco,” Parkinson says with a hand to her hip. “I need a man’s opinion.”
“It’s true then,” Dean says, eyes switching between him and Draco. “You two are together?”
Together, because that’s what they are, a singular entity connected by their mutual pleasure – they move their hands seeking one another out. Harry finds Draco’s fingers scratching up his back, sliding up his neck, moving to cup his jaw. Harry moves his hand, pulling one of Draco’s hands away, sliding his fingers through Draco’s, touching their palms together, pressing the back of Draco’s hand into the firmness of his mattress.
Curious,
Harry stops, gasps, opens his mouth to moan, makes eye contact with Draco and thrusts into his hand before moving his own fingers towards the waistband of Draco’s pants.
“Someone has to,” Luna chimes, taking the meat out of her satchel and throwing it towards the Thestral before her. It opens its wings wide before them, chewing at the meat eagerly.

Nevermind
“No, you go ahead. I’ll go with you next time.”
Although, I’ll admit, I
Harry traces the raised jaded skin with gently calloused fingers.
“Are you sure?” Draco’s pushing the hair out of Harry’s face and suddenly Harry’s never been more sure of anything else in his life — he tells Draco just as much, who then starts to thrust agonisingly slow inside of Harry.
,” Draco whimpers. “You could come just like this?” He teases.
“Kiss me,” Harry commands, still laying on the floor. Draco doesn’t hesitate to join him, hovering above him, letting Harry wrap his arms around his neck and drag him down to crash their lips together. Their teeth knock together, not that either of them minds and Harry ruts enthusiastically up into Draco.
The blond preens at the praise, smiling and hiding his face. Harry puts a hand under Draco’s jaw, forcing him to look at Harry’s lust-filled gaze. Harry and he share a few light, open mouthed kisses before Harry leans his forehead against Draco’s and gives a tentative thrust of his hips.
–” Harry pauses, hips twitching as Draco pumps his cock, twisting his fingers inside Draco in response. “– just by looking at you, yeah,
Neville looked at Harry’s eyes through the mirror. “Yes, he says it got really bad at one point.”
Draco leans down, snorts the concentrated Pixie Dust spread across the mirror on the bed. “I’m serious, hit me. I can’t feel a thing,” he says, voice chiming with breathy laughter. “Hit me.”
is for you to fuck me.”
“You’re looking well, Harry,” Luna says, teeth showing through her dopey smile.
I get what you mean about not being able to say Voldemort’s name. I hate closed spaces because of reasons I’d rather not get into but those things don’t go away easily. So, I understand.
It stays empty.
, he’s absolutely ready and Draco’s muttering something else. Probably a protection charm and then he’s slipping his fingers out of Harry making him groan before lining up his cock against Harry’s rim, slowly teasing his hole, precome dribbling down onto Harry and the sheets as he does so.
Then their shirts come off and there’s scars marring Draco’s white skin. Harry takes his hand and appreciates the contrast of pearly white and reddish brown, how they seem to mirror each other and yet exist so differently. Harry has scars too, on his face, on his sternum, on his chest, on his arms.
"You're lying!"
“Hey, no fair,” Malfoy whines next to him.
Draco’s hips are stuttering as he bounces on top of him, head thrown back in ecstasy as the head of Harry’s cock teases against his prostate. Draco’s trying to hide his face, white-blond hair serving as the perfect curtain for him to hide behind, but Harry is having none of that.
Draco leans down, snorts the concentrated Pixie Dust spread across the mirror on the bed. “I’m serious, hit me. I can’t feel a thing,” he says, voice chiming with breathy laughter. “Hit me.”
“Did you know our pupils grow wider when we’re looking at someone we’re attracted to,” says Draco, lifting Harry’s glasses, placing them gently on the nightstand.
Draco frowns. “I’m coming,” he says and yanks his hand out of Harry’s so quickly it stings.
Draco grabs him and kisses him, moaning into his mouth as Harry wanks his cock, using the precome that was leaking out to aid him in his efforts. It doesn’t take much really, which makes Harry feel elated that he isn’t the only one constantly on the edge of a little death, and bites down on Draco’s lip as the blond moans into his mouth.
, before anything has even happened and Harry feels an uneasy sense of anger at it, at him, because if there’s anybody who has a right to regret what could have been between them, it’s Harry.
Neville shrugged. “He said Malfoy has this way of making you feel like you’re the only person in the world.” Harry had frowned as Neville continued, “Theo says that one day, he just got tired of being the only person in that world.”
“Harder,” Draco says, sitting up. “Hit me harder.”
Dean is in his room again, sitting on the cobblestone sill, looking too comfortable in Harry’s spot.
, Harry thinks. He wants to get high, so he’s going to get high. Harry makes his way to Malfoy’s bed, sitting down cross-legged, diagonal to him. Malfoy leans against the wall with his knees pulled up to his chest.
“You don’t talk to us, mate. Please just tell us what’s wrong–”
“Is it too much?”
Harry freezes, blinks rapidly, swallows a lump in his throat. “You know what I mean, right? Please tell me you do.”
Also, about Snape. Yeah, I’m not too fond of the guy, but he was on our side in the end. Did you know that? I’ve submitted a story about it to the Quibbler, so that his sacrifices and death were not in vain. It’s kind of weird though, because apparently he was kind of weirdly in love with/obsessed with my mum? It’s
Blaise reaches out for the spoon before turning towards Harry. “Let’s not be rude here. Potter, would you like some?”
P.S. Your eyes are also intense. Very intense.
Harry is so startled he laughs. “I tasted myself once, after wanking,” he says, shrugging.
When he wakes, Harry’s still on the other line, making Draco’s heart feel oh so very warm.
Heard about your acquittal. Congrats to you and your family for getting off, once again, without having to serve time in Azkaban.
“I think,” Draco says. He does not finish his sentence, instead he stares into the darkness of Harry’s bedroom with jarring scrutiny.
“Yeah, I’m his roommate not his fucking keeper.” Harry can’t look at her, displeasure clear in his voice. He shakes his leg harder.
Harry’s breath hitches, he feels his heart in his throat, but it’s not a heavy thing. While it does overwhelm him, it doesn’t scare him. “Okay.”
“You’re kidding.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Someone says they saw you sneaking off with Malfoy the other night,” Hermione says, arms crossed over her red jumper.
Draco and Nott laugh again, leaning further into each other, Draco’s hand landing on Nott’s thigh as he shakes with the force of his cackling.
CW: Mentions of death threats (towards Draco)
Draco sits on the black and white checkerboard tile, back against the porcelain tub, wiping at his mouth. He flicks his wrist, the toilet flushes as he turns his puffy eyes towards Harry.
Draco is kissing and sucking down Harry’s neck, biting hard and earning soft moans in reward. Fuck, Harry never knew he could like this kind of stuff this much. Maybe it’s the drugs, maybe it’s Malfoy, maybe it’s the fact that Harry’s always been curious about what it’d be like with another man and now he’s about to find out.
“Stay,” Harry says, rising, taking tentative steps towards Draco. He doesn’t want to see Draco walk away, doesn’t want Draco to leave him, and doesn't want either of them to be alone after this. “I meant what I said when I made love to you, I want to take care of you, please let me take care of you, Draco,” he whispers, breathing against the nape of Draco’s neck. He’s close, so close, and he desperately wants to reach out, but he won’t, because Draco asked him not to.
“Ah. Well, no. They reckon it’s better than us fighting.”
“Oh, fuck yes.” Draco gently pushes her off him, grabbing at Nott’s arm and pulling him up. Draco leads Nott towards Neville, pulling him down next to him. He leans close, pressing his cheek into Neville’s and says, “Take care of him for me, won’t you?” Draco kisses the corner of his mouth and pushes Nott towards him with a grin and a laugh.
A small smile graces Malfoy’s pink lips, Harry notices from the corner of his eye, and the blond says, “I won’t pretend.”
“Yes, Mr. Potter. She’s being treated in St. Mungo’s as we speak,” McGonagall’s voice shakes, she sounds pained. “Mr. Malfoy has informed us that she’d gotten the narcotics from you. Ms. Parkinson’s statement concurs with Mr. Malfoy’s claims.”
Malfoy,
“Who I’m sleeping with is no one's business but my own. Not that they’d care, really.”
“Is that why you’re asking me of all people for fashion advice?” Harry had asked, head tilted towards his friend's reflection in the mirror.
Let me know,
“I don’t know, figured Nott would know.”
And of course, he was nervous, it was a new layer of intimacy they had yet to explore, making love while in love. Harry didn’t let his mind fantasize too much about how he wanted things to go, instead deciding to follow his instincts.
“Talk.”
Harry hesitates, only making his way towards Malfoy after the other man lifts a blond eyebrow in challenge.
“Just handsome?” Harry teases.
“Right.”
Harry lays down on Draco’s bed.
After Draco leaves without a word or a sound, Harry finally lets the tears that burn him up from the inside out fall. Harry wishes he could take away this hurt, that he could kill it where it began. Yet, there is only the heavy weight of the truth and the importance of choice.
They send love letters often. Not every day, for life gets in the way, but still. They send one another letters.
Harry frowns, breathing in and out slowly, deeply. “I think something is wrong with me.”
Suddenly, Harry’s mind is made up, “Me either,” he decides with a shrug, accepting the spliff in Malfoy’s hand and bringing it to his lips. Out of the corner of his eye Harry notices Malfoy’s steel gaze beneath the white-blond of his lashes.
“You talked about this with Hermione?” Harry chuckles.
And Harry does, he shows him, feeling his flesh turned over and raw as he cooks for Draco, setting him down to eat, helping Draco as he moves to clean the kitchen, putting on a happy movie for them to watch. Harry had begun renting happy films ever since the very first time, when he had none but an afterthought of Ginny’s to offer.
Draco’s eyebrows furrow, but his mouth is falling open again and his breathing is causing a rapid fall and rise to his chest. “Fuck,” Draco sobs. “I want you.” Draco’s eyes are wide and swimming with that unreadable emotion again. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted you.”
belong to you,” he says, rising from the bed, shifting his weight, moving to put his clothes on again. “I don’t
“Well, there you go then.”
Harry hates the sound of his laughter almost as much as he hates the sound of Draco’s name spoken freely from his lips.
Draco wears a three-piece suit, his hair has been cut since the last time Harry saw him, and he stands rigid, sharp features turned into a scowl at the threshold of Harry’s broken home.
“Okay.”
Harry hadn’t even looked up from his file when he answered, “It’s called Playhouse.”
I hope you don't mind my using your first name. But seeing as we're friends and all, I think it's only appropriate! I mean, I know we aren't but I wouldn't mind if we were - I feel like we kind of are already to be honest, haha. And that way you don't have to lie to Richard! Let me know if this is okay with you!
The next morning, with the sun seeping into the window and serving as a cool greeting, Draco offers Harry a spliff and they smoke in bed — Harry eyeing Draco’s neck, which is covered in the bruises and bites Harry left him. Something swells in Harry’s chest, it’s warm and possessive and likes the sight of Draco’s chest littered in Harry’s marks.
“Perhaps,” says Draco, adjusting his trousers. Harry remains on the bed next to him naked. “If you will have me at my leisure.”
“Eighth year?”
“What do you want, Harry?”
Draco’s hand reaches for Nott’s arm, wild grin painted on his face, and then they’re both squealing and whispering into each other’s ears. Harry hates them both so much right now.
“He’s everything I don’t want to be, everything I could be.”
“You –” Draco starts, then stops, bowing his head. “Why do you always stop me?”
“I get that.”
“But you met up with Hermione?”
“That’s why I want to test him –” Theo stops when Draco pushes him away.
“I’m not doing it because I feel I have to.”
Draco shakes his head. “No.”
Harry’s heart flutters against his ribcage and Harry moves to get under the duvet with Draco. Leaning into the other man, Harry tries to spot any fresh bruising along Draco’s neck.
Harry sits up, moving Malfoy’s sprawled legs off the windowsill and sits next to the other man. “Jesus Christ. He died for our sins,” explains Harry. “You’ve never heard of him?”
Harry pulls away, kissing Draco’s cheek, moving to take off his dragonhide boots. Draco follows suit, kicking off his oxfords. They move their bodies, resting their heads on the soft pillows of the bed.
“Which one?”
They feed the Thestrals in silence.
Everything has always been smoke and mirrors between him and Potter, with Harry. Draco does not want it to be a game, a mystery, a
“You’re taking Muggle studies?”
“I don’t think he could ever love me. What if you’re right? What if he feels some sort of sick satisfaction that I feel –” Draco takes a shaky breath. “What if he’s laughing at me behind my back?”
Parkinson and Zabini join the fray easily enough but Goyle and someone else who he can’t remember is standing beside Draco, observing everything from a distance. The mystery man has dark, curly hair and brown eyes that look around the room with an unsettling amount of boredom.
“Harry’s a
Draco laughs, light and sweet. “Like you’re any better.” He’s moving his hips to meet Harry’s relentless thrusting. Harry starts pounding into him, wanting to shut him up.
Luna hums, reaching a hand towards the mother Thestral, softly petting its head. “Yes, I suppose but –” Luna turns her wide eyes towards him, looking right through him. “– of the two of us, only one of us has seen him cry before.”
“You don’t have to like every single person your friends are close to. You don’t have to be their friend either.”
“This hurt, it’s mine, Harry.” Draco looks at him, finally. “Let me own it.”
“You mean the telly?”
I didn't mean anything by my lying comment, by the way. I think you might have thought I did, but I swear I didn't. I know it must be hard having to keep such a big part of yourself hidden, we both can relate to that I guess. I'm happy to know that at least you don't have to keep this part hidden too.
“As weird as you’d expect them to be.”
“So, so good,” Draco says, bringing his other hand to the back of Harry’s head, hand tight in his curls, thrusting up into Harry’s quickening pace. “Oh my – fuck, yes, so good, you know you always fuck me so good, I love it, I love you, I love,
Draco curses and puts out the cigarette, looking between Dean and Harry.
Malfoy lets out a throaty chuckle, rolling his eyes. “No, I’ve been smoking since I was thirteen, I don’t see why they’d take issue with it now.”
“Is she okay?”
“Don’t.” Draco’s voice is barely above a whisper, but it still makes Harry shiver. “Please, don’t.”
“I don’t talk to him about the war.”
He wakes up in a cold sweat, tells himself this is what happens to someone who represses the fuck out of their sexuality, his brain is desperate for the truth to reach the surface and somewhere along the way some wires have gotten unholy crossed. He tries desperately to uncross them, is unsuccessful, pulls out the Marauders Map anyway and follow Draco’s dot. Fuming and uncomfortable the entire time he does so.
Draco whimpers above him, biting down on Harry’s neck, kissing up his jaw, licking at his earlobe. “Okay, yeah, whatever you want.”
I’ve missed you. I’m sorry I haven’t written, really I am. Here’s something you should know about me, I’m a bit of a mess. I’ve been a bit of a mess this past year, I think I’ve been a bit of a mess for half my life. But today, I feel like being reckless and stupid and I want to crawl out of my fucking skin.
Pansy sniffs, rubs at her nose, turns her unfocused bloodshot eyes onto Harry. “Shit.”
Malfoy scoffs at him and is already gone by the time Harry realises he’d been leaving.
that if word gets out that Harry Potter was taking Level Three regulated drugs within your institution you'll be removed from your position." Narcissa's voice is ice-cold. "Need I remind everyone that Harry Potter owes me a Life Debt and that sending my son to Azkaban will leave it unsettled."
Harry talks about his father then, about Snape, about his mother and his mother and Snape, and his father and Snape and he thinks he’s making very little sense, but then Draco says, “It’s hard living up to legacies our fathers left us, isn’t it?”
“Yes, I’m fucking sure, fuck me already,” Draco bites, skin flushed the most brilliant pink under the moon’s faint glow.
Harry scoffs, feeling his shoulders jump with mirth. Draco moves his head, finding his silk pillow, and resting against it, body turned towards Harry.
Unlike you, I understand the importance of holding myself accountable.
Harry swallowed, “Yes,” he had said in a raspy voice, thick with a desire he had tried his best to keep locked in his chest.
Harry blinks, looking back towards Hermione whose eyes are red and swollen.
Harry’s guilt grips his heart, morphs into something ugly and mean. He’s so angry right now, he just wants to get away — what he needs is space, but every single one of his friends can’t seem to respect that enough to actually back off and give it to him.
What’s up?
And then, they’re kissing and it’s hot and a little wet and a little rough and it’s turning Harry on so much, more than he thought kissing another man ever would. Malfoy’s lips are chapped a bit from the cold, even though he’d been driving Harry mad earlier, licking and biting at his bottom lip. Fuck, but now it’s perfect against Harry’s own cold-effected lips.
Harry hits him, Draco falls onto the bed with the force of it. Draco’s laugh sharpens, he’s gasping with it. “Hit me,” Harry says, giggling at Draco’s high-induced mirth.
Draco licks his lips, stares at Harry through white lashes, and tells him he’s doing it wrong. It’s the first time he’s said a word to him in over two years.
“He’s the one who’s fucked in the head, not me.” Harry feels the sting of salt-filled tears threatening to bleed down his cheeks. He won't cry, not over this, not over him. “Just look at his stupid –” Harry makes his way over to Malfoy, who tries to pull away from him. “– his stupid fucking arm!” Harry pulls back Draco’s sleeve, revealing the lines of cuts scattered across his Dark Mark.
“Baby.” Harry’s voice cracks. “Stop.”
. Draco asked for dinner. Harry can make him dinner.
belief that Azkaban is an unjust punishment for someone who is so obviously struggling with a mental health issue."
Malfoy,
“Why was that under your bed?” Harry teases.
“Just,” Draco says, hands held up and out into the cold space between them. “I can’t do this if you need to get drunk to fuck me.”
Ron and Harry haven’t spoken much to each other since New Year’s, instead choosing to sit together in silence. It’s not like their fights of the past, this one feels so much worse. Hermione says it’s because everyone’s hurting and
“He won’t make you forget.”
Hermione looks like she might cry. Harry feels a pang of guilt weigh down his chest, but then something stabs at him, sinks its teeth into his heart, and something simmers inside him. He can barely breath; anger, the old familiar friend, consumes him. “Hermione’s going home to her parents, but I don’t see you mad at her about it?”
Seems out of character. Although, I guess, by what you said in your letter - well, are you trying to change? Is this your attempt to do that? Live amongst Muggles, avoid petty arguments, become a changed man? You said you have many things to apologise for, and I wonder if you even know what they are? Do you?
Draco’s foot finds Harry’s leg, and he slowly starts to slot his thigh between Harry’s body.
Theo lays the cutting board on the counter, sets up the vegetables around him, and begins chopping at the onions in the methodical way he always has. “I’d do anything for you.”

“Don’t,” Draco whispers, trying to hide his reddening face. “I like the feeling of it inside me.”
“You’re the only one of my friends still talking to me.”
It stings. It stings to hear words of hate escape Malfoy’s lips. And yet, there is a part of Harry that hates himself too, that wishes to destroy himself from the inside out, that wonders if Draco can aid him in the sweet crumble of destruction.
Also, the Muggles are not in the telly! They are recorded on a camera that captures pictures and sound that plays on the telly, so think of it like the moving pictures of our world - but with sound!
Pansy shrugs and gets up, making her way to one of the dirty mirrors by the sink, reapplying her lipstick as she stares down her reflection in the mirror. “Well, I best be off, my free period is almost over,” she says, waving at the two of them before skipping on out the loo.
Malfoy gives him a slow once over. It makes something warm pool at the pit of his stomach.
Draco doesn’t want Harry to let on if he feels nervous and even though his hands tremble with emotion, he moves to kiss at the scars, licking at them, trailing down his chest, the way he might have if they had been having sex the whole time, the way he never has before.
Harry gets into a more comfortable position, sprawling out his legs and pushing his hips forward  before turning his head just a bit more towards Malfoy. “Yeah?”
“You want my mouth?” Draco’s voice is so deep, and rough, and it’s practically scratching against his throat.
I love the pink hair you're sporting nowadays. Yup, still attractive, haha.
Harry feels raw when he asks, “Will you come back to see me again?” It’s too vulnerable, divulges too much of himself – exposes him in a way he does not wish to be exposed, reveals something of a side of himself that is not ready to be poked.
CW: Draco references suicide in a sort of joking kind of way, which is not a healthy coping mechanism, by the way. Take care of yourselves babes <3
Harry feels bile rise in his throat, he nods his head and blinks away the burn of unshed tears.
,” he moans out and at the sound of the other man’s whimper he says the name like it’s a prayer over and over again.
“Fuck,
“You haven’t answered the question,” calls Parvati from across the circle, arm thrown casually over Lavender’s shoulders. “Come on, can we get the answer this year maybe?”
Speaking of death, I know what you mean. I’m not sure if your mum ever told you but I really did die that day in the forest. She lied to Voldemort about it, it’s all a lot to get into right now. What matters is, I also had my own little dance with Death. There was a moment where I had a choice, to leave and go Beyond or stay and continue to “fight the good fight.” I almost didn’t come back.
By the time he’s changed into his joggers and jumper Malfoy’s already made room for Harry next to him. Harry tries to suppress the half smile that threatens to overtake his features. He thinks he’s doing a pretty bad job of it, but it doesn’t really matter that much considering Malfoy has the ghost of a smile on his own lips.
Harry apparates, and then suddenly, they’re in Harry’s room – he really shouldn’t apparate when he’s drunk, especially as an Auror, and also, he’s just ditched all his friends (who all went out for his birthday party mind you) but then Draco’s kicking off his shoes, laying on Harry’s bed and holding out his hand and all of Harry’s thoughts fly out the window. The only thing that matters now is Draco’s body against his.
Molly grabs a box by her feet, dumping its contents out onto the coffee table. Bags of white powder scatter, along with the silver spoon they’d used to snort the Pixie Dust. There are bags of weed, pre-rolled spliffs, cigarettes, tabs of acid on aluminium, and other random pills Harry’s never seen before. “We found all of this on your side of the room, Harry, dear. In your mattress.”
Harry stands with his arms crossed over his green jumper, the one Mrs. Weasley had given him in May to make up for the one he had missed during the Christmas he’d spent in hiding. It was warm, fit him just right and was comforting to him now, considering his best mate was angry with him.
About Hermione, yes she is still living with me. Send her a letter to the return address you see on this one, I asked and she’s willing to accept a letter from you. Are you going to apologise? Word of advice, she’s a woman of action and not one who accepts empty words or shallow promises. You’re going to have to really prove to her you’re trying to change.
“Well, you’re so busy taking care of everyone else, I need someone else to worry over you with.”
“You want me to tell you something important?” Draco says, hand tightening around Harry’s neck, grinding down onto him, riding him. “I can tell how much you want me.”
“Alright,” he says to himself.
Harry leans into the crevice of Draco’s sweat-silk neck, licking in the salty taste, biting down at the juncture where neck meets shoulder, thrusting in deeply, harshly, with the intensity of his longing.
“Back to Potter, are we?”
“No, but I’d like to.” Draco smiles at him, and Harry returns it easily.
I think it’s sweet that you needed your hand held, your first tattoo is always a bit nerve wracking and seeing how the one you got put on your skin before this one wasn’t a pleasant experience (I’m assuming), it makes sense for you to be a bit anxious about it.
“Yes, really.”
I want to say one thing that I think is important to clarify, which is that Draco is a sex worker and Harry's identity is going to be hidden. Draco's not bothered by this because, well, it's not all that unsurprising for someone to want to remain anonymous with him in the online sphere.
“For wanting someone that isn’t good for you?” Luna tilts her head. “No, I don’t think so.”
Draco’s pushing down his pants and Harry summons the little phial of oil they normally use, wordlessly and wandlessly. He smirks down at Draco who stares him down with one of the most heated gazes he’s ever seen; he knows how much it turns Draco on when Harry does wandless magic.
“I do want to see you, Jesus, Draco, I do.”
Harry grits his teeth. “I don’t know what you mean, Professor.”
“It’s why I can never see the green in yours.” Draco smirks.
Harry doesn’t see Draco for a whole month after graduation. Draco, on the cusp of nineteen, is untraceable. Harry struggles with the urge to search for him, to find him if only to shake him from the shoulders and ask what’s wrong.
“Want to suck you,” Draco says, eyes darkened with lust. Harry swallows, his heart a hummingbird in his chest. Draco’s never wanted to do this before. Once, Harry had asked and when Draco recoiled away from him, Harry had assumed it simply wasn’t his cup of tea which was fine, just fine – even if at the time, it had felt too much like rejection. It wasn’t even about his lack of want, it was the way he looked sick with the thought, as if the idea of intimacy with Harry was a glass-shattered act that made Draco bleed with regret.
Harry whimpers. “Yeah?” His voice cracks a bit. He should be embarrassed, but he isn’t.
Harry’s head follows Draco’s words but his gut twists with confusion. “When have I ever been drunk?”
“Want a bump?” Draco asks, separating a line for Harry. He hits the acid-pop sugar and lets the drip trickle down his throat, soothing him into high-induced happiness.
“Dean,” Hermione breaks the silence. “What are you doing here?”
You’ve given me a lot to think about. I don’t know if anything I’ve just said makes sense, actually, so I’m sorry if it doesn’t. But still, I liked hearing about how you view of things.
“Parkinson overdosed last night,” Ron says, voice rough. “Hermione found them trying to help her.”
Room assignments are different this year, which is a point against Harry’s wish for a normal school year. Somehow, he doubts he’ll be given the pleasure of a peaceful year. The Eighth Years are forced to stay behind after the welcome feast, where they are then ushered off into a random tower and told this will be their new dormitory. Harry’s hardly paying attention when his name is called and his room number is assigned, he really should have been paying attention though, because then he wouldn’t be feeling so out of place in his new room.
This time around, Malfoy’s
After a while, after Parkinson’s left for her little rendezvous in London, Malfoy asks, “Won’t your girlfriend mind? That you’ve been looking at other girls who are practically naked, I mean.”
In his whole life, even. If he’s allowed to be honest.
“I just want to help you.”
“Not the kind of man who can give me the opinion I truly need.” Parkinson says, turning to Malfoy’s bed. She picks up two skimpy looking outfits one red and one black, both made of leather. “Which one is sluttier, Potter?”
Harry pushes Malfoy off him, moving past the others in the room who are muttering about the appropriate course of action and other shit that he really doesn’t think is all that important right now. Harry runs up the steps, heads back to his room.
“They’re yours,” Draco says, pupils blown wide with lust, swimming with something deeper, something Harry wants to dive headfirst into.
“If there are ten men sitting at a table, and one of them is a Death Eater, then there are ten Death Eaters sitting at a table.”
Is It a Crime
“Stop, stop,” Draco says beneath him, hands shaking into the heart of Harry’s chest, where the monster of his need lays and purrs. “You’re drunk,” he observes. “I can’t do this with you if you’re drunk.”
It becomes a regular thing after that. They smoke a cigarette every night, right before bed. They don’t really talk much beside Harry asking to bum one and Malfoy offering him his lighter. Ron and Hermione are worried that living with Malfoy won’t be good for him in the long run,
“Draco –”
Draco scowls. “You do it too, you know?” He grabs at Harry’s wrists. “You were using me to hurt yourself.”
H. Potter
“Am I?”
Later, through the residual tingle of their love making, after Harry’s gone and wet a flannel to clean Draco up, they lay in bed together, Harry with his arms around Draco, Draco with his face pressed into Harry’s chest.
Neville seems unfazed by the barb, and Harry can’t help but wonder if maybe there’s some truth to Draco’s statement — the other man at least thinks of it as truth, since he said as much under the effects of Veritaserum.
,” says Harry, running a hand through his loosened curls. “So, so good, baby.”
Nirvana
“You haven’t said that you don’t know anything.” Ron points out.
, before practically bullying him into using it. Harry oftens forgets, but he figures cool water from the filter is better for Draco than just tap.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy snorts. “Alcohol makes me sleepy.”
Harry moves for his wand, lubes up a finger but then Draco’s grabbing his wand and saying, “There’s a spell –
Draco turns his head to the side, eyes still trained on Harry. “Fuck,” he says. “Oh, fuck.”
Eventually Harry says, “Tell me a story.”
“I think I have Clueless.”
, he does not say. “Yeah, that’s fine.” Instead.
, touching Draco and he can feel the hard line of Draco’s cock pressed against his thigh as Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s neck with a teasing smile. Harry’s drunk on the liquor and the way Draco looks at him and he wants to taste so he leans forward and feels the warmth of Draco’s shaking breath and then closes the gap between them, hands tightening around Draco, pulling him close, never wanting to let him go.
“But–”
“Yeah,” Harry says, but he does not jump to another topic. Neither does Draco, instead, they lay in silence. The soft sound of the phone static noise is the only comfort between them.
Harry hadn’t realised he’d been staring until Malfoy’s mercury gaze pierces into Harry, sending a shiver down his spine that he can’t blame on the weather – not that he doesn’t try to, anyway. Harry gives him the finger, smirks at Malfoy’s scandalized face. Then Malfoy sticks his own middle finger up, licks it slowly, the way one might when trying to seduce a book and turn a page, and scrunches his face – like it’s all a joke, like Malfoy knows Harry’s thought about men before. Then Parkinson catches Malfoy’s attention and the moment passes, and Harry pretends the fleeting curiosity of what Malfoy’s tongue might feel like never existed in the first place.
Draco throws his head back and laughs, hearty and real, shaking his head. “It’s alright.” He rises into a sitting position, release still sticky across his stomach and chest. “I bet you want a taste, though.”
Harry takes a shaky breath, “You said,” he starts and then takes another breath. He swallows and tries again, “You said, I just need to say it and I’d hear it back.”
It all seems to be going fine, because no one is actually talking to each other and instead are choosing to mind their business for bloody once in their life.
“Are you sure you don’t want to come with us, Draco?”
“Show me what to do,” Harry stands straight, tries to keep his voice even.
"Oh," Harry whispered and leaned forward to get a better look. "Her eyes are green."
They paid the fee for the ceremony and then walked back home, hand in hand.
"Everything's okay," he murmurs to Draco, putting the key in the lock. "You're safe."
Draco smiled at Molly's head, heavy on Draco's shoulder with sleep. "Very."
He knew when, from a distance, Harry's shoulders dropped from under his ears and he began to turn in Draco's direction, that it was time for him to approach. He conjured a bunch of flowers in his hand, and winced when Scorpius flinched at the magic.
A kid who can’t be more than sixteen or seventeen, and she’s looking around with wide eyes and a trembling bottom lip. Harry doesn’t see any blood on her, but he doesn’t know if she hit her head on anything. A few of the police and paramedics break off from the group once the girl is out of the car, and come to talk to Harry.
Harry shook his head from the couch before standing and coming over to stand behind Draco at his desk. "He wants to see you, too."
"Obviously not. You just said I'd had seven firewhiskeys. I was thinking 'dear god! My boyfriend is hot!'" Harry took the change and shoved it in Draco's pocket. "It's a miracle I was thinking anything at all."
Draco smiled and kissed Harry's cheek. "How come?"
Harry winds his arms around Draco, one hand tangled up in Draco’s hair, the other pressed into Draco’s spine. Harry runs his fingers over the ridges of bone and lets Draco move them together.
Draco pulled back. “What? What do you mean?”
Harry sits absolutely still and watches him, waits for him to say something longer than a couple words at a time. The heater is humming and clicking the same way it’s been doing all autumn, and the wireless taps out an indecipherable rhythm from the far corner.
The Healer nodded. "Yes, that's all quite expected. Once your hearing starts to disappear, it will likely begin to be more uncomfortable. The pain will become more noticeable."
Draco crossed the room and pressed a quick kiss to Harry’s cheek before taking his wand. “Thank you,” Draco murmured. “Don’t know what I’d do without you.”
he signed. He meant to say
Harry set the plate down on Draco's lap and settled himself on top of Draco's feet. "Feeling alright?"
"What do you want?" Draco said, his face still buried somewhere between Harry's neck and his ear. He was, frankly, quite uninterested in anything that didn't involve rolling and rolling in Harry for hours. He had almost lost this. No, he
Draco huffs and flicks his hair off his cheekbones. “So I share a last name with Harry Potter. Who do you think I am?”
Draco shook his head. "No, I took the day off, actually. Just needed a little break."
. He swallowed hard and clutched his son closer to himself.
No, Draco would rather not look at the statue today.
"The next time you tell the Aurors about our Mortem case, I'm going to..." The voice faded off down into another corridor.
Draco doesn’t answer immediately. “Translations are never exact,” he says instead of all the things he could say. All the things that mean
Harry thinks of that smile on Draco's face when he got his license, the bright light coming down through the cracks in the trees, white blond hair fluttering back under summer breeze.
Draco snorts beside him.
"Good morning, Wilson." Draco smiled at him.
In the silence, Harry adds, “Or you can tell me tomorrow.”
“Right,” Harry says, and clears his throat.
Draco nodded and looked away.
“You know what, Harry?” Draco says.
"Why did you come with me, Harry?" Draco asks.
A cool hand lifted up to brush along the line of Draco's shoulder in the dark. Draco shrugged it off and groaned into his pillow. "'M hot. Lemme alone," Draco muttered.
Draco pulls Harry close and puts Harry's face between his hands, pulls their foreheads together. They do not need to speak. The ocean rushes into the shore, over and over, audible through the walls of the little house. It is singing, out there from the world, and Harry hears.
Draco snorts a laugh. “Make love?”
There was no singing, pulling at him under his rib cage, but there was a certain inability to turn away. Harry could not look away from the mountains, or the empty fields, or the large cars, or anything else.
"You what?" Wilson said, raising his eyebrows.
Draco took a heavy breath and tugged Harry along with him until they were standing in front of the gates to the cemetery. He dropped Harry's hand to open the gate, but then took it right back up again, and walked them through into the green meadow of stone and decaying cut flowers.
"Come here, darling," Draco called, reaching his hand out towards Scorpius. "Daddy's waiting."
Later that night, there was a knock on Draco’s door. When he opened it, there was nothing there but a small paper bundle at his feet.
Draco shrugged and picked his quill back up. "Hermione already knows," he said after a long moment.
Draco turned red. “Thank you. It will be a pleasure not to have to wear my heavier fabrics.”
Draco sighed and pushed himself out of the bed, careful not to shift the mattress and wake Harry. Another cry rose up and Draco reached over to grab his wand off the bedside table and cast a silencing charm around Harry so he wouldn't hear. Even with Draco's grumbled annoyance, he couldn't bring himself to shake Harry awake.
Harry glanced over his shoulder. “Very much so.”
But Harry digs and searches until he makes Draco cry, and then scream, out in Chautauqua where everyone can see and hear them. No one told Harry when they came to Colorado how many people there were. They said it was brown, and that the mountains were beautiful, and the skiing was good. It is brown, and the mountains are big, and Harry doesn't ski. No one said that there were people everywhere, and the houses were expensive, and the hikes were crawling with people in floppy caps and green backpacks and big water bottles. And that all the people had big eyes and sunscreen greasy faces and no subtlety.
Draco paused. "I haven't seen her yet."
Harry smiles and sets his bacon down. “Miss Wimblefon, would you mind continuing this conversation during our class time? I’m trying to enjoy my breakfast.”
This was a mistake. Draco’s stomach flipped in every direction, his heart beat too fast, the back of his neck was surely brick red. But Harry was sitting in front of him, looking at him, his knee almost touching Draco’s. There wasn’t a bone in Draco’s body that had enough willpower to turn away from this.
"Yes," Harry says. "He got his license two years ago."
Draco’s cheeks heated up, and he looked down. This was his way of showing friendship. He hadn’t had many opportunities to do so in the past, but now seemed as good a time as ever. No matter how it made his stomach turn and his face go blotchy. “I read a lot. Recently, I’ve been reading about the language and meaning of flowers. It doesn't all make sense to me yet, but I like learning about it.” Draco took a deep breath and ignored Kit’s wide eyes observing him. “Lemons happen to be a certain interest of mine.”
Draco waggled his left hand in the air. “We’re going ring shopping this weekend.”
Wilson smiled, and patted the door frame as he went out.
“What is it?” he asked.
“Draco!” Harry said, loud. “Did you hear me? You were going to be dead!”
“I’m fine,” Draco shouted back. There were no further responses after that.
"No," said Draco.
Harry slowed and stared at Draco, caught off guard by the way the warm glow of the candles hovering over the table reflected over Draco’s cheekbones and the bridge of his nose. Caught off guard in the way that he often was, simply by how beautiful Draco was. Draco glanced up at him and smiled, unaware of the heat opening up in Harry’s stomach.
Several dishes clattered in the sink. “Harry?” Draco called. “Is everything alright?”
“But I don’t want sex.” Harry breathes slowly, in and out. “Genitalia makes me feel gross. It makes me uncomfortable. I don’t want it. I don’t want anything to do with it. And-” Harry takes another slow breath. “It took me a long time to figure that out. I didn’t know anyone who felt like that, the way I did. People either wanted to have sex, or they didn’t. No one felt desire for someone... but didn’t want to have sex with them.”
Harry has to bury his head into Draco’s shoulder, trying to keep focus on his goal of making Draco come. He wants it so badly, feels mad with the desire to make Draco feel as good as he does Harry.
I guess, maybe, I’ll never be over these things that make me angry because I wish they
Harry leans his head on the window, turning his eyes towards Dean and asks, “Why are you hanging out with him?”
“I wouldn’t mind if you did.”
Draco snorts. “You know you’re a shit liar, Potter.”
“Harry, will you just please
“You’ve just seen what happens when I try to do that.” Draco sniffs, taking the back of his hand and wiping his nose. “Merlin, I feel disgusting,” he says with a scoff, gesturing down at himself.
“You’ve always been a bit barmy when it comes to Malfoy, mate.”
“Have you forgiven him,” Harry rasps out, feeling unreasonably jealous with the knowledge that Dean and Draco talk about the war — it’s not like Harry enjoys talking about it anyway.
“Will you tell me what’s wrong?” He asks, placing the glass of water into Draco’s hands, turning to pull a pair of joggers from his over the bathroom door handle, putting them on, sitting next to Draco’s shaking body, never letting his eyes leave his shivering form. “Please.”
Onto the mindfuck that is grey morality. I’m almost sold, I just don’t like it to be frank. I hate that it leaves us open to selfishness, that if fed, has us hurt others. What if we blur the lines too much, and leave people open to freely hurt others if it’s in the defense of something bigger? Or, would that be the bit that makes them morally grey, yes?
Harry can’t help but laugh a bit, because who would have thought that after Parkinson’s attempt to give Harry up to Voldemort, she’d be in his dorm room asking him which outfit looks, well, sluttier.
Harry hesitates, looking at Draco beneath his lashes. Draco’s looking at him with such intense heat that Harry feels consumed by it, wants to burn under it completely.
Harry clicks his tongue, even though Malfoy is technically right.
The last thing he wants to say might just be the very thing Draco needs to hear. “Maybe we shouldn’t be having sex.”
“Of course,” Harry says, reaching out his hand, waiting for Draco to lean into it like he is wont to do nowadays. “Thank you for trusting me.”
they came to the consensus that a bit of romance is allowed, it is their one-year anniversary after all. But, beyond that, Draco needed Harry to act with an assuredness that would allow him to follow suit. Draco needs Harry to be brave, unafraid of hurting him, to not make it known whether he felt nervous.
“You okay?” Harry asks when he feels a wetness against his chest, when he hears Draco take in an unsteady breath.
“No.”
Also, Ginny says that you should reach out. Blaise told her about that fight you two had. Blaise is really private, like you said, so she didn’t tell me about what you two fought about - but I think he’s ready to move past it. At least, according to her, he sounds like he is. Reach out to your friend, Draco. You’re not a coward because you’re scared, but you might lose someone you care about (and who obviously still cares about you too) if you keep hesitating.
Draco cries when he comes, and Harry wipes away his tears as easily as he does the spunk on their bodies. Instead of post-coital bliss that carries with it a strict countdown, Harry is met with Draco in tears, sitting up on his heels, still naked, twisting his hands and trying to speak, opening his mouth to form the words, growing frantic as he fails and tries and fails again to explain whatever it is he wants Harry to know.
Harry does eventually doze off, with the last thing he’s aware of being the steady rise and fall of Draco’s chest and the feeling of Draco softly scratching at Harry’s scalp.
“I’m in love with you too, yes, at least I hope that’s what’s happening here.”
Things I learned from my degree:
“That was fantastic.”
“He was scared, just like me,” Hermione says. “He was awful to me; he did everything he could to let me know how different we were. And yet, we share something now – fear, we’ve both been afraid of similar things.”
“How do you like it?”
to process, but hey, at least he was a good guy in the end (sort of).
The tears escape Draco in the same fashion raindrops might slide against a window, slowly falling down his face, meeting at his chin, dripping down onto skin.
I think conflict is something we all face in our relationships and I think the best reflection of our character is when we are flawed, when we address our mistakes, and we have people who are there for us when we make mistakes and help hold us accountable.
It had all been a matter of circumstance, really. His birthday was coming up, he was working with Draco on a case, and he had mentioned his plans in passing.
Harry kisses him, slow, long, and hard, before thrusting up just a little bit. Draco bites down a moan, hips jerking just a bit. “You can move.”
Harry stares, eyes never quite adjusting to sight without his glasses, the edges around him blurry. Draco, however, stands in stark clarity within his vision. In the yellow glow, under the soft glow of candles floating all around them, Draco’s head shines with a halo of light behind his head.
Harry frowns. “I’m so–”
making him feel this good. “Tell me you want me.”
“Oh, we’re going to have loads of fun then.” Malfoy’s eyes are glistening with mirth and mischief.
They eat dinner and discuss the movies currently playing at the cinema, debating which ones they both agree sound interesting enough to watch. Draco’s eyes shine with what Harry guesses is excitement. After dinner they sprawl out on the couch, Draco taking up all the space as he drapes himself across the plush leather, exiling Harry to the other corner. They turn on the telly and watch the new gameshow, Big Brother, that’s just begun airing on Channel 4.
Weeks pass, and the simple exchange of a cigarette might just be the way to peace for the Eighth Years because when everyone sees that Harry and Malfoy haven’t woken them up in the middle of the night fighting, when they see them without a sneer or a glare directed at one another, when they see the two men offer one another a curt nod after making eye contact across the hall — the unspoken rule becomes: if Malfoy and Harry can get along in the post-war climate, then the Slytherins and Gryffindors can most definitely get along as well.
Draco’s eyes glisten and he smiles, it’s a private thing – something that feels like it belongs solely to Harry. Draco shows him what to do, and if Harry keeps fucking it up on purpose, well, that’s his business.
Draco clicks his tongue. “Just be grateful it wasn’t in my desk drawer or something, I’d have to get up for that.”
Their bodies move in tandem, as Harry thrusts in and Draco wraps his legs around Harry’s waist, matching each other as they follow a slow rhythm, setting the pace together. Harry looks down at Draco and Draco looks up at Harry as the rest of the world melts away. They share open mouthed kisses, hands exploring each other’s bodies. It feels like this is the first time they’ve ever come together, and in a way, it is.
In the wise words of Harry: ???
Harry leans down and kisses him, relishes in the taste of his own come inside of Draco’s mouth and pulls Draco back up onto the windowsill. Harry tucks himself into his briefs, and undoes Draco’s trousers, pulling out his angry red cock from his pants.
“Thank you,” Draco says, leaning against the threshold. “For earlier.”
Draco kisses with enthusiasm and passion, letting Harry’s tongue slide against his own, using it to roll against Harry’s. Phial still in hand, Draco pushes Harry’s jumper and shirt up, breaking their kiss to slide it off him before leaving wet open-mouthed kisses on Harry’s neck, across his collarbones, and down Harry’s chest, stomach and abdomen. Every time Draco so much as bites at him, Harry’s moaning and thrusting upwards; desperate for friction — making Draco chuckle with bemused delight.
Hermione, brilliant witch that she is, seems to get the hint and instead switches the subject to coordinating nights to study together. “It’s very important that we revise as much as we can, we missed out on an entire year of studying and it’s been so long since Sixth Year,” she says this all with tight shoulders and a furrow in her brows that lets those around her know she’s very, very serious. Harry just nods along.
Eventually Malfoy goes, “I’m hungry.”
Harry feels something grow in his chest, filling his lungs and gripping his heart. Hope, Harry realises, it’s hope he feels in his chest. Harry does not know what he hopes for — hope is a treacherous thing, has led him towards more heartache than he ever thought he could bear.
“Me too,” Harry whispers, against Draco’s ear, against that fucking silver earring that’s been teasing him for years. “I want you too.”
, especially with Ron and Hermione making googly eyes at one another and presently ignoring Harry — either intentionally or not, he’s unsure.
Draco grabs at Harry’s jumper, the green one, and throws it at Harry. “I’m tired.”
Harry kisses him. He’s slow about it, hovering over Draco’s lips, eyeing the slight quiver of his body, moving his palm to Draco’s reddening cheek, putting his slightly chapped lips gently against Draco’s soft ones. The kiss is short, tentative, Harry doesn’t move to deepen it, instead keeping his body close, pulling away slowly, feeling the way their lips stick together and come apart as he does.
Harry snorts. “Not bloody likely.” He turns back to his bacon, stuffs it into his mouth and that seems to be the end of it for now. Harry really isn’t interested in explaining himself.
Harry swallows. “You’re not?” He tightens his grip.
Draco’s hand in his hair tightens suddenly.
Malfoy doesn’t look away from Harry, not once, and he keeps Harry’s attention,
which calms Harry down, just a bit.
“Some days, I really hate him, other days, I just don’t want to be around him.”
“I think Harry’s talking to him,” Ron says, voice rough as his vision blurs.
Love, a sacred thing - platonic or otherwise.
Draco,
, right fucking there,
Harry hits him. Draco falls onto the bed with the force of it. Draco’s laugh sharpens, he’s gasping with it. “Hit me,” Harry says, giggling at Draco’s high-induced mirth.
“I’m in the auror training program,” Harry tells him, forehead leaning against Draco’s, the ring of his glasses pressing into the other man’s pale eyebrows.
, fuck.”
Slowly, moving cautiously, they slip off the last layers of clothing and now they are both very much naked and hard and Harry’s kissing Draco and rubbing their pricks together and clawing at his back.
“Because,” Theo begins, moving to start cutting up the white mushrooms Pansy loves. “He’s hurt you.”
wanting to,” Draco spits and Harry pauses.
Draco blinks at him and Harry lifts his shoulder, rummaging through his bookshelf and grabbing hold of the VHS.
Think of a CD like a record, just smaller and more easily portable. To listen to it, I recommend getting a Discman, although I think they're being called a CD Walkman nowadays.
“Fuck me, put your cock inside me, please, I need you inside.”
Harry feels Draco’s breath above him, arms beside him encasing him in, and cock inside him. Harry likes that he feels locked in, with his back pressed against the mattress, likes being right here — entrapped in everything that is Draco.
Draco unclasps the little vial, pours oil onto his hand and slowly, and tentatively rubs at Harry’s rim. Just on the outside, obviously testing the waters.
that first bit. I hope his migraine lasts for days!
“That’s a good one, right?”
Harry’s heart clenches.
Malfoy,
Malfoy laugh is right by his ear, shoulder leaning into Harry as Parkinson goes on to say, “You were right, Draco, he
Harry can feel Ron’s glare on him, but his eyes are still locked on Dumbledore’s portrait.
“I haven’t.”
In his whole life, even. If he’s allowed to be honest.
This time, Draco does not cry before, during, or after sex. He comes with the remembered grace of a man who rarely allows his body the pleasure of unwinding, back arched against the white sheets of Harry’s bed – face blissed out, as if being with Harry brings forth the experience long since thwarted by choice and expectation. Harry’s heart feels heavy with the knot that tightens against him, as he sees the sweet face of bliss dissipate into a haunted frown across Draco’s posh face.
“Let’s go, let’s go right now.”
“Oh, shit.” Parkinson sniffs, shifting to cover something on the bed.
Draco’s on him at once, kissing him with a fierce intensity that has arousal clawing its way down his spine. Harry brings a hand to the back of Draco’s head, pulling him closer.
?” She said in disgust.
Months later, their son was born with Harry’s eyes and Draco’s colouring. And a flame-shaped birthmark in the middle of his right palm.
“What's the use though?,” Pansy asked him,” Seems like way too much work for what it’s worth.”
Draco felt a pit in his stomach. Of course something would go wrong. Why did he think he could spend a single morning with his friends without something going wrong?
“Draco! Mate we’ve been looking for you everywhere.”
Potter peered at him from across the table. Draco raised an eyebrow. “Hogsmeade next weekend.”
Then under the next full moon, spit the leaf into a small vial.
The brassy grandfather clock hanging on the opposite wall chimed to let them know that class would start soon. The house elves switched from cooking to cleaning mode, turning off burners and washing dishes while running to and from the great hall.
He hurried towards the open air archways, feeling the source of the cool air. The whomping willow swayed with a soft rustle. The carved stone bricks clicked under his feet as he descended the steep open hillside.
“The drawers must’ve been charmed with an alarm.”
“Completed your potions homework yet, Mister Zabini?”
Draco had to agree that the Three Broomsticks had the better butterbeers though. Before the war, he lived for the days that he and his friends would trudge in the cold to the toasty inn and tuck into a booth. The Hog’s Head tended to harbour shadier figures. Perfect for people like him who might not want to be recognized, even if it meant having lunch surrounded by criminals.
Draco was beginning to get used to the soggy leaf stuck on the inside of his cheek. At first it bugged the hell out of him and during transfigurations he nearly spat it out while answering a question for the class. Not to mention the wicked lisp.
“Yes but do keep your studies in mind Malfoy!” She chided him one last time.
Blaise tells them after taking a minute to calm down. “Ah! I forgot to mention; I'm pretty sure you’re not the only one making potions on the sly Draco, I caught Weasley clipping a leaf off one of the mandrakes as well.”
Snow piled impossibly high. It whipped around a creaking shack creating a high whistle. A stag stood with snow matted fur padding through the drifts. A winged cerulean shadow passed over the pure white ground. It swooped towards the stag. The stag turned showing it’s entire snout. On its brow there was a distinctive pale marking. Suddenly, the scene was enveloped in windblown snow.
Draco jerked away. “Don't touch me, filthy mu--!” He caught himself but it was too late.
“If your next assessment at the end of this week is sub standard then I will have to take matters into my own hands and assign you a study partner.”
After the war ended, Draco returned to Hogwarts, despite the animosity that many of the students held. It was the safest and simplest option.
“Er… yeah I heard it didn’t go so well.” Draco winced. He was acutely aware that he might be in the same predicament in a few weeks time. They all looked at him expecting more, eager to hear what happened. The mood had changed and they seemed more comfortable with him.
The professor looked up from the desk where he was perched on a stool assisting Longbottom who was having as much luck as Hagrid on a broomstick.
“You witch,” he laughed.
“That could work,” Draco agreed, giving the plan a nod of approval.
During another otherwise monotonous day drifting through the castle from class to class, Draco couldn’t help but feel a glimpse of excitement. Taking steps toward his new form broke him from the gloomy haze usually following him.
Five minutes passed.
He calmed himself before leaving for the alcove in the common room to meet Pansy and Blaise. Tonight was the night. They would try to get the last part of the potion: a death’s head hawk moth chrysalis.
“Yeah, my snuffbox grew whiskers during the practical exam.”
Draco felt a rush of blood to his head and the pounding of his heartbeat drowned everything out. It was like he was underwater. A second, faint rhythm beat. It was fast, far faster than his own. It sped away and after a moment he surfaced, his head clearing.
“Thanks Pans,” Draco replied. He cradled the chrysalis in his hands. “I’ve got to go put this in a vial, but I’ll see you guys in class tomorrow.”
“Did you hear what he just said?” whispered a girl down the corridor.
‘So much for studying,’ he thought, tucking his Transfiguration textbook away.
“Is that a question?” Draco asked him.
The library was one part of the castle that had changed drastically after the war. The delicate books were burned and ripped. Curses toppled the heavy shelves like dominos, cascading onto one another. Today, many of the books were replaced with new editions and the shelves were pitted in burn marks. Draco only visited on the rare occasion where he needed a very specific piece of magic he couldn’t find in his family library or textbooks. The nostalgic library smell hit him with hints of: aged hardcover, old carpets and dust. He peered down each row, searching for Granger. This afternoon the library was almost empty, a blessing. Being tutored was like an admission of weakness to Draco.
“This is all your fault Potter,”Draco stated angrily.
Draco slipped into the room closing it behind him gently. Filch’s room was a surprise. It was the size of a large closet, uncluttered and plain. The moldy smell only got more vile, bottled up inside, unable to leak out into the corridor. One lantern hung in the center casting shadows into every nook and cranny. The only expected items were the manacles and chains hanging from the ceiling. They were polished like prized pieces of jewelry. Tall uniform cabinets lined the room
Blaise and Pansy cackled at him. Eventually Pansy contained herself long enough to ask,
Though they could escape Azkaban, there was no escaping the constant feeling of being watched by the ministry and the disgust of everyone who recognized them.
He glared back at them and their group. Draco didn’t need to check his bag to know his textbook wasn’t there. He started to see other students taking notice of the standoff. Arguing or trying to get the book back was certainly going to draw a crowd.
“Not yet, but I’m starting soon.”
Tonight he was sat wracking his brain for where he might find a drop of “virgin dew” as Pansy called it, or a death’s head hawk moth chrysalis.
“What am I to do with you Draco? First you’re failing in your courses, now you’re snooping in Filch’s chambers. You’re already going to be studying with Miss Granger but I cannot allow you to go without punishment for this issue. Starting tomorrow, I would like you to meet me for detention every morning in this classroom for the next fortnight.” The disappointment in her voice was curdling like sour milk.
“Repeat it one more time,” Pansy prompted.
This charms class wasn’t going as well as usual. Every attempt failed. After one particularly bad attempt that ended with nothing except for a fizzle of soot, several classmates snickered. This set him off even more. Draco could feel embarrassment and upset tainting his magic, making him utterly useless.
The door slammed open. Filch barged in carrying the lantern in one hand and Ms Filch pressed to his chest in the other. Her ears were laid back and a menacing snarl came from between her bared fangs.
His blood runs cold when he realizes that the chrysalis most certainly isn’t there.
“I'll give you my treacle tart!”
Draco paused behind the last pillar, checking for watching eyes. He retrieved his wand and cast a disillusionment charm to render himself invisible for the time being. It wasn’t the strongest charm he’d cast but it would have to make do.
“Sounds like something Longbottom would eat.” Pansy smirked.
His daydreams were disrupted when the oak door creaked open. Blaise trudged in throwing his book bag down and collapsing backwards on his bed.
“Merlin... could this be any more complicated,” Draco cursed.
He hated to disappoint her. Despite the professor being head of his rival house, you just couldn’t help but want to win her approval.
“Aren’t you going to do something about it?” Pansy asked, confused. A year ago, Draco would have confronted them, likely with an insult or quip.
“If you’ll see me after class, Malfoy.”
“Wouldn’t it be an awful shame if your textbook went missing right before a test?” Justin Fletchley chimed in from across the Hufflepuff table.
“Yeah, I mean what if you end up like a hamster or something,” Blaise adds.
He sifted through his drawers, with meticulous organization by color. Greens on the right, white in the middle and black on the left. Draco tiptoed to the bathroom. The sweaty clothes peeled off of him like a snake shedding it’s skin. They revealed his scarred, sickly pale body, complete with a writhing snake and skull on his forearm. He looked away, apathetic. The fresh crisp robes slipped on feeling like a new skin.
“Filch had an alarm set for his cabinets.” Pansy informed.
Gradually he was getting used to the lisp and only had trouble with pronouncing s’ now.
“Now get to bed before curfew…” He nodded then made a beeline to the door, “Oh and Malfoy, do consider thinking of a better lie ahead of time if you’re going to cause trouble.”
He pressed on into the foggy darkness, following an overgrown footpath. Though the sun was still high in the afternoon sky, under the thick cover of reaching branches no sunlight reached the forest floor. The further he walked, the more a sense of paranoia overcomes him. The oh so familiar feeling of being watched. It was times like this where he wished he had Crabbe and Goyle covering his back, as oaffish as they may have been. The trio was broken in the room of requirements, a memory that still sent shivers down his spine.
Five days later they met at dusk in the same quiet nook, gathered around a little coffee table. Laid out in front of them was a single unappetizing mandrake leaf and Animagus Transformations: Quick and Easy.
Blaise grabbed his arm and helped him up. “Up you go,” he muttered.
Pansy runs in. “What happened?” she hisses in a panic.
“Malfoy, I’d like a word,” the Professor called to him before he gathered his belongings.
This time Draco knew that he wasn’t alone. He also knew his disillusionment charm had worn off. He hid behind a thick oak trunk.
Harry was cut short by the spectacle in front of them. A small waterfall overflowing with clear spring water ran through the clearing and off deep into the woods.
“Oh aren’t you just the sweetest kitty… who wants a treat? Ms Norris wants a treat!”
Filch shut his chambers. Then the haggard caretaker hobbled away carrying a lantern, Mrs Norris padding along behind him. Pansy watched them disappear into the darkness.
“It has come to my attention that your engagement in class and performance in the weekly assessments has declined. I am aware that the last few years have been rather...turbulent for you, however if you wish to pass your N.E.W.T.S then you will have to focus yourself.” She looked down her glasses at him sternly.
“Yeah, well, I’m not exactly welcome there.” Draco paled, now finding his essay very interesting.
“Of course sir!” he replied, probably a lie to appease the potions master.
“Merlin, why did I say that? Draco you git, she was being nice and you went and pulled that crap.” He’d gone and done exactly what everyone expected of him.
“Screw Potter and his pity,” he thought.
“I’ve heard you have to chew a mandrake leaf for a month straight,” Malfoy offered with feigned disgust. He was barely grossed out by it anymore, just a fact of life at this point.
“Wow what a fantastic backup plan mate,” Blaise laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Over the alarm someone was running down the dungeon staircase clanging their lantern on the way down.
Draco covered his mouth to shut himself up. Pansy elbowed his ribs but was near giggles herself.
Draco took out his wand. “Alohomora.” With a flick of his wand the door creaked open.
After that, they worked in an awkward silence, broken only by the scratching of quills. Draco had to admit that at least this study session had helped him finish most of the essay. He barely made time for studying anymore, preferring to procrastinate until the last moment then write everything the night before it was due. It didn’t help his grades any.
“Why is everything so loud? Why can’t I remember doing this? What the hell is the incantation for pawn to queen transformations?!”
McGonagall looked confused.
Draco watched him weave through the growth headed towards the clearing. His face was obscured but a sliver of light glanced off his circular lenses, giving him away.
“Huh, that was easy,” Pansy remarked.
He looked back towards the storage room on the way out and saw the brief outline of a witch, camouflaged into the background, sneaking away.
“I’ll wait behind the column.” She scurried away.
I will now be updating weekly on Fridays starting the 24th at 10PM EST.
The words seemed to melt together. Nothing made sense. Draco couldn’t tell apart one spell from another. Spells that according to the test he should know from class. He lifted his head from his hands. The clock read fifteen minutes until classes end.
“Bloody squirrels,” he muttered.
Enjoy!
“What about Ms Norris?” Pansy asked.
“Yeah, no kidding.” Harry muttered.
Professor Slughorn’s portrait waved cheerily at Blaise as he entered the alcove.
“It was only natural, as a student of the transformative arts, to become an animagus. Albus taught me as an extracurricular study,” The professor paused introspective. “In addition to that there is a certain joy in taking up a new form that only animagi truly experience. Unlike the use of polyjuice potion or lycanthropy, a witch or wizard’s animal form is an extension of their being, a reflection of them. ”
At the chime of the clock, quills were laid down, ink pots sealed, and the class filed out placing their papers in a pile at the front.
Draco began counting his marks. Out of twenty he’d only answered six which left him feeling certain he’d be in study hall with Ernie Macmillan or Justin F. Fletchley for the rest of term.
Draco slowly drifted away from his friends' views after the war. It's hard to call someone “mudblood” or “blood traitor” after having your life saved by them. Now with so few Slytherins and not a single friend in any other house he couldn’t afford to be picky or start a fight with them.
“You could tell Filch about Peeves then stand guard outside the storage room while I give Peeves the goods,” Blaise offered, growing more excited by the second.
Draco groaned, ‘why did it have to be her of all people?’
“You’ve got a great wit for charms, boy,” Professor Flitwick would often tell him after a well cast charm.
Blaise confirmed, “So, it’s decided then, let’s meet tomorrow right after classes end.”
Recite the incantation: Amato Animo Animato Animagus, at dusk and dawn daily,
The corridors were almost silent except for one or two residual voices echoing down the dusty stone corridor. A breeze whipped through carrying lost papers and ochre leaves.
Draco nodded, soaking her words in like a thirsty sponge. She was the first and only animagi he’d actually had the opportunity to speak with.
Blaise leaned over his shoulder and made a face, “ Get a load of this Parkinson, you have to keep a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a month straight.”
“Draco?” Pansy looked over noticing him.
“Can’t I ask a classmate about their weekend plans, Malfoy?” Potter threw back at him.
“I'm sure you could get all the other ingredients before the next full moon too”, Pansy added.
“Yeah, are you going?” Potter responded. Why did he care whether Draco went to Hogsmeade?
“Well that’s a first,” Ron said to Harry.
The skinniest clock hand raced. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
“Amato animo animato animagus,” Draco chanted sleepily. The incantation came naturally now after two weeks of practice. A few rays of morning sun peeked through the hazy lakewater staining the bedsheets with a shifting mosaic of greens and blues. Draco sat up and stretched his arms above his head feeling the muscles tense then release.
“Rosie are you coming? I really want to get there early this time.” A classmate asked while waiting by the doors.
His eyes scanned the room, looking for sympathy perhaps. Draco could only see disgust and anger. Only Potter showed any different, something like pity or sadness.
Add several strands of your hair, a silver teaspoon of dew that hasn’t seen sunlight or been walked on in 7 days, and a death’s head hawk moth chrysalis.
Draco drifted off into his thoughts, reminiscing. His formative years seemed so long ago.
Hope y'all enjoyed! Things will start moving along more next chapter ;) Any guesses about what Draco's form will be?
“My aunt sent me a Holyhead Harpies poster signed by their Chaser, Valmai Morgan!”
Grateful for her work Draco added, “I really am sorry.”
“Erm, Professor I haven’t got a chair,'' he said, becoming more miserable by the second.
After several moments of awkward silence, Snape’s replacement arrived, a forgettable witch with a mousy voice.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Yes you’re missing out on so very much.” He gestured to his thick textbook.
The mandrake leaf taste leaked into everything he ate. Lemon tea, toast and sausage with just a hint of angry screaming plant.
“Have you started on your Transfigurations essay yet?” she asked him. Draco was grateful she had the mercy to change the subject.
“Hey!” Granger caught up to him and grabbed his sleeve. “Wait up.”
decided to update a bit early
“Let’s see what Professor McGonagall makes of you, eh boy? Detention for a month, no... a year!”
