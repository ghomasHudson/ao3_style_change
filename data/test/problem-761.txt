Both boys had a thousand butterflies slamming into each other in their stomachs, but Harry agreed and Draco slowly reached out and grabbed Harry’s uninjured hand, gently holding it between his own.
“They’re gonna be so mad, so so mad.” Harry shook harder and tears ran down his face as the pieces all slid into place in Draco’s mind. Hermione must have lashed out about Harry’s grade which started all of this. Draco was going to
“Well I’m not, I’m so relieved to hear that he feels safe and happy but I don’t trust it. I just need to convince him that I’m happy about it too so that when the other shoe drops I’ll still be there for him” Sirius snapped
“If you ever find yourself in need of using it again, simply ask.” Snape pauses briefly before pulling out the papers that needed signing, “Just two signatures, one the first and third page. You can read over them now if you’d like, but they will be gone over in court and it’s nothing you don’t already know.”
Once he could hear his cousin’s loud rhythmic snoring from across the hall Harry knew it was safe to leave - Dudley always stayed up the latest. So he slipped on the cloak and slid his wand, parchment, quill, and muggle money into his bag.
The rest of the shopping went by as quickly as he had imagined, he didn’t run into anyone, which made sense, they had all probably done their shopping weeks ago. This was clear at the potions shops, they were low on bat spleen, cowbane, and Russian Dragon Nails he was able to get some, but not in the quality or quantity he assumed he would need. Hopefully, he wouldn’t be using them until after his first trip to Hogsmeade where he could check in the local potions shop. Before leaving Harry took a stroll through the pre-made potions and grabbed a few vials of dreamless sleep and a container full of fast-acting bruise salve before checking out and heading back to his room.
I'm so sorry this is late, I literally fell asleep editing it last night. Wednesday's chapter will be up on time!!!
“Dinky!” Snape called out and a loud pop filled the room causing Harry to jump and let out a loud whimper. Severus winced, he should have summoned her in the hallway.
Harry was shaking with nerves as he sat by himself outside of ministry room 117. Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape had been inside for at least 20 minutes, but Harry hadn’t been called in yet. He had been beyond relieved when he found out that his trial wasn’t taking place in front of the entire Wizengamot - Draco had told him about the massive courtroom with all of the oldest and most noble wizarding families and the thought of speaking to all of them terrified Harry. Instead, his trial was being held in a much smaller room; today Harry, Snape, and Dumbledore had to present the case to Amelia Bones. Bones would then take her findings to a small board of magical law enforcers who would make a final decision.
I hope yall like cuddling because we will be seeing lots more. I hope everyone enjoyed this "first-contact Drarry" we'll see that grow more over the next few chapters.
“Draco is a friend, he’s been great during all of
“Harry, I need to see them and make sure that they’re not infected. Would you like for me to look privately or do you want Professor Snape to stay?” Harry felt a panic rising inside of him. No one had cared about Harry’s personal life for the last four years, why did they care now?
Crabbe and Goyle were wacking enchanted balls the size of volleyballs back and forth and at targets, Montague had set up earlier. While all the potential keepers were running drills and trying to take shots on Bletchley. Harry had realized these try-out were less stressful than any time he could recall when he was on the field with Wood.
Harry could feel that something was off, he had been jolted awake and he couldn’t figure out why, he didn’t remember having a bad dream and he wasn’t shaking or sweaty, he had taken the sleep potion this shouldn’t be happening. There was nothing wrong with the room, everyone was in bed with their curtains drawn. There was one empty bed but it was Seamus’, and he was likey cuddled up in Deans.
“Teach me,”
“Harry, we were about to go flying, get ourselves warmed up for try-outs tomorrow. Wanna come?” Draco came up to him right after the professor had left.
“My god Harry do they all need mending?”
“Harry, I want you to wrap yourself up in  this.” Snape held out the blanket, “It’s heavy and if you need help I’m here to give it.”
“Hey, guys!” Harry spoke, excited to see his friends again. Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Ginny were all sitting and chatting together. Harry wasn’t met with the happy responses he was expecting, in fact,  he wasn’t met with any responses. Ginny glared at him, while Ron looked like he was doing everything he could to not look at Harry. Hermione shot Neville a knowing look and put her hand on Ron’s lap. Neville nodded and stood joining Harry in the hall and closing the compartment door behind him.
The other boys in the room were stunned, “You’ve been cheating to make yourself look dumber?” Draco asked the shock clear in his voice and Snape shot him a look that told him he shouldn’t have said that,
“Of course, I’ve never been the best seeker - hell I was hardly a good one you remember second year the bloody snitch was practically touching me and I didn’t notice it until you did.”
“Our first order of business will be taking away your pain, I’m afraid we can’t get rid of the marking until the report is filled. If the matter gets taken to court your hand will likely be needed as evidence.” Snape informed.
“No no no no no….” Harry whimpered out, looking at the body of his best friend and his family - the only people who had ever taken care of him before.
“I have to respond to Fumbles soon but I don’t know what to say to him. I want to talk to Harry first, I need to know he’s okay before I subject myself to be one of the old mans bloody pawns. I won’t do anything to hurt Harry, for anyone” Sirius spat.
“What in Merlin’s name for?” Sirius shrieked
“I’ve never heard of one before so I don’t know what it's called, but it looked like a regular quill and she told me it wouldn’t need ink so I started writing and it felt everything I wrote digging into my skin” Harry clarified,
“Dinky is bringing the items Sir requested, the items for Harry Potter Sir.” Dinky bowed and placed the items on the desk next to Severus.
“Well, we’re friends now but we just skipped over all those parts where we get to know each other. I want to learn more about you and I want to tell you about myself, so as long as you’re honestly feeling up to chatting with me for a while I think now would be as good a time as any to start.”
“I’m sorry for scaring you, but we need to lower the flame first.” Harry reached over and did so as Draco let out a little sigh
“Come on,” Draco quickly ushed the group into an empty classroom across the hall so they could have a bit of privacy.
“What’s wrong Poppy,” Snape pressed
He stood and faced Harry who was still sitting on the table and he lifted the lighter boy into his arms before lowing them both to a sitting position on the floor with his back to the wall. Draco spread his legs apart and pulled Harry in between them so the smaller boy could rest with his back to Draco’s chest - this position also allowed Harry to turn his head into Draco’s body where it could slip right next to his shoulder.
“I don’t know what she said to you - and I don’t need to.” he added promptly, “...but I wanted to let you know that I’m really happy for you. You studied your ass off and you did great. Honestly, you should be proud, I am.”
As the founders worked to build and establish Hogwarts they each added bits of their magic to a core they placed underneath the castle. This was delicate work and if it were too complex it wouldn’t hold over the years after they passed. So each of the Hogwarts Four came up with one specific task for their piece of magic to do.
Sirius spent the next hour trying to decide what to do. He felt like he couldn’t make a decent decision without Remus there, so he spent the day researching the type of magic Dumbledore had referenced.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now Harry, Professor Snape has informed me of your detention with Professor Umbridge last night. Can you confirm for me that what he has told me is all true, she had you write lines with a black quill?” the old man asked,
Harry didn’t understand why Dumbledore didn’t find it imperative to take legal action as Snape had, sure Harry wanted to avoid any more attention on him but he also knew that Umbridge should be stopped.
"you had a school-boy rivalry it doesn't define you. Plus, I know you just ran with it to cover up your crush." Pansy spoke with a cheeky smiled laced on every word
“what in Merlin's name did you two do to get out of Snape's class," Pansy demanded when she saw them both sitting together laughing in front of the fireplace.
The room was only silent for a moment before Sirius gently cradled Harry’s hand in his own, “She’ll go down for this Harry, properly. She has to.” his voice was barely above a whisper.
“How would I not know that I had dark magic in me?” Harry responded,
“I know…” Sirius said softly as he transformed into his animagus.
He hadn’t even realized he had left his dorm room when he felt his back collide against a cool leather sofa. Harry pried his eyes open, and when he saw where he was, Harry wanted to close them again - this must be a dream. He was in the Slytherin common room, he recognized it from the undercover trip he took with Ron second year.
Harry noticed the Thestrals for the first time as he road over to the castle, of course, he didn’t say anything to the group of Hufflepuffs he was riding with. They just stared at him, and he couldn’t tell if they were angry or just confused as to why he was riding with them and not with other Gryffindors Harry didn’t have the energy to talk to them.
“He gave me the report paperwork for you to sign which you can do now, with me as an acting witness. The court has agreed to hear the case, as well as the governor’s board.” Snape’s words eased some of Harry’s nerves but they also left him with questions,
With his snacks paid for and his body hidden by the magic of the invisibility cloak once again, Harry wandered until he found a park that he used to go to as a kid. He never played there because his days at the park were always spent hiding and running from his bigger cousin Dudley, but at least he knew his way around well.
Sirius Black read the letter over three times before he was able to set it down. He didn’t entirely believe Dumbledore when he said there hadn’t been an issue worthy of awaking the founders’ magic, he knew that the Headmaster had a nasty habit of bending the truth. Sirius was far more considered that his godson had wound up in Slytherin with his childhood nemesis looking over him. Sirius also knew how much Harry’s friends meant to him and wondered why they hadn’t already tried to get Harry back to Gryffindor. He could understand why Harry hadn’t spoken with Dumbledore about the situation - he just didn’t have a clue why he wouldn’t have gone to his friends?
“This magic only works when a student is in danger of being hurt in their house or when they accept that they’ve been abandoned. I don’t know what happened yet, but Harry’s in Slytherin now and he hasn’t talked to anyone about how he woke the magic yet. Albus wants me to convince him that he does belong in Gryffindor but I don’t think I can do it Moons. Everything I’ve read today says this only happens in extreme situations, whatever happened in Gryffindor must have been
“Mr. Potter, if you have finished your meal we have a meeting to get to.” Some of the students (Harry included) could hear the tension in Snape’s voice as he spoke.
“Alright, that’s all I need, Mr. Potter. Good day!” John Rubble cheerfully excused himself and fled from the room under Snape’s menacing gaze. The room was silent for just a moment before the other young wizard stepped forward,
“Only if you’re sure?” Harry questioned again right before they made it to the door.
“Of course, where is he?”
“Hey, I like gardening - as long as noting tries to kill me while I’m doing it.” Harry laughed with him as they slowly approached the greenhouse.
The letter was addressed to
Harry wandered toward the back of the house thinking maybe there was something there that could help him and as he passed the garage he remembered a conversation he heard between Vernon and Petunia.
Snape managed to get Harry back to the dungeons without being bothered by anyone else. “Harry, it’s alright you’re safe at Hogwarts, we’re waiting down the hall from my classroom, no one is going to hurt you.” Snape’s voice was uncharacteristically soft even for comforting a student.
“Yeah, I can show you… probably shouldn’t do it here though.” Harry agreed
After a few years of traveling in the bank, Harry found he didn’t mind the cart rides it felt a lot like flying but with less control. He took out what he deemed was the appropriate about of money for all his shopping and spending money for the rest of the term.
whenever she could. Now her son was sitting across from him, not even knowing for sure if she would have done the same thing for him.
“Yes Sir, of course.” honesty that went much better than Harry thought it would. Now he would just need to figure out a way to sleep without his potion.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re not a bother Harry, and we need to tell Professor Snape because black quills are not only banned at Hogwarts but they are a highly protected dark artifact the ministry has lots of regulations on who can use them and what they can be used for, punishment is not on that list. Umbridge needs to be reported Harry, and only Snape can do that. Go on Draco,” Pansy spoke so eloquently and Draco was grateful that someone was able to speak with Harry the way he needed.
“Sir, I don’t know what’s going on I’m a Gryffindor.” he sighed at the thought of his house, “How did I get here?”
Luckily, it seemed that Professor Snape was feeling similarly,
Harry only nodded so the professor continued
“That’s beautiful Draco and I’m glad I know it, but I assumed you wanted to know something - I don’t know more
cw: mentions of child abuse/aftermath of abuse & starvation
“You won’t be needing a quill or parchment -  I’ve laid some out for you. Just have a seat” She motioned to a small desk near the window of the room, it was painted a nasty shade of pink to match the rest of the decorations.
“The student is Harry Potter and he-” Draco cut him off
He had arrived 30 minutes early which gave him time to pick a compartment and get settled before the piles of students came flooding on. Harry hadn’t seen any of his friends yet, and the housemates of his he had seen didn’t seem very happy to be talking to him as he walked by looking for an empty seat. He found one at the back of the train and got settled in.
“What on earth does that mean” Pansy questioned suddenly very interested, she had also been caught off-guard by Harry’s behavior at the table she shuddered to think of what her parents would do if she behaved in such a way.
When Draco was out of ear-shot Pansy spoke to Harry again,
“Sit, you are not in trouble however there is an urgent and important matter for us to discuss,” Snape spoke swiftly to the anxious-looking students who all quickly followed his instruction.
“I was just showing Draco and Pansy my charms exam. I got a perfect mark” Harry held out the parchment with a shaky hand for his professor to grab
“Did I dream it all up?” Harry asked himself as he slid out of bed and walked toward the window, It was still dark outside maybe Hedwig would be flying around close by.
“I would rather get it finished in the morning Sir,” Harry spoke quietly and Snape was pulled back into the reality he had just warned his student of, this was not the Harry Potter they were all used to.
“Room now boy!” Harry didn’t waste time as he rushed up to his bedroom, he didn’t miss hearing what Aunt Petunia was saying.
“Incendio”
Harry hadn’t noticed how tense he had become or the intensity at which his hands were trembling until Snape place a hand gently on his shoulder. He flinched violently at the sudden contact but he was successfully pulled from his thought spiral.
“I’m a serious boy! One. more. Peep. and you’re out!” He bellowed again before slamming the door and locking it behind him.
will take over as Slytherin Seeker. Graham and Snape already approved everything, you just need to say yes and attend try-outs because of some school policy.”
On Sunday evening after dinner but before sunset Draco and Harry put on their jackets and headed out for a walk around the great lake. Draco was given a chance to learn some more about Harry’s life while they were out there.
“Poor belly-welly is too used to being empty for him to feast”
“I don’t want to talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable I just want to get to know you a little better. Is there something you want to talk about?” Draco asked, shifted a little bit closer to his roommate on the couch.
“Yeah me too,”
The first family that Harry ever really had and it was gone because Harry wasn’t good enough. Wasn’t good enough to keep his friends, wasn’t good enough for Gryffindor, wasn’t good enough to save Percy. Harry wasn’t enough.
Sirius addressed the finished letter and handed it over, it didn’t say much. He told the man he wanted to speak with Harry to better understand the situation before encouraging him to do anything drastic, “You’ll take it first thing tomorrow?” he asked, Sirius would love nothing more than to escape the hollow halls of Grimmauld Place even if it was just to run errands. Alas, it was far too risky still.
The letter had the Hogwarts crest pressed into the top but  Severus had never seen the script before, furthermore, any messages from the Headmaster or another professor would have been delivered by a house-elf or in cases of more discrepancy by patrons. As Snape stood cautiously to examine the memo it began to speak.
“It's okay, Draco I like talking to you, and getting to know you. I liked...this, that happened tonight, and I think you’re adorable when you’re awkwardly stumbling through your words then. Also, I’m gay too but that’s less of a secret nothing in my life is a secret”
Snape could tell this wasn’t the whole story but he didn’t want to scare Harry off by making him share more than he was ready for, so he moved on to his next question.
Snape seemed to choose that exact moment to come floating down the hall, “You three
“What do you want” Nott questioned, being the first of them to see the four approaching Gryffindors
“Mr. Potter, I’ll need to see your hand.” The professor spoke ignoring the urge to grab his student’s hand and examine it as quickly as possible.
“Can you ever finish a match without the dramatics” he laughed
Harry’s mutterings had gotten louder and now everyone could hear them, “No, no please I’m sorry. I won’t do it again, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” he kept repeating himself
“We’re not here to speak with you!” Spat Dean Thomas, his sour words caused Harry to flinch
“Then don’t, please because I know that you’re not ready to trust me yet - I understand, but I would tell you anything you wanted to know. I don’t want to scare you off or hurt you. We can wait and talk more when we’re both ready. Why don’t we just try and get back to sleep?” Draco pleaded, he was seconds away from confessing the major crush he had on Harry and that really wasn’t what he wanted right now
“NO!!!! Percy please, take me, kill me instead!” Harry screamed until he feared his lungs were bleeding as the hooded men around the graveyard disappeared.
Hermione who had been watching the whole interaction shot Harry’s death glares as they both approached the front of the classroom where their professor was waiting for them.
“Ma’am, you haven’t given me any ink” Harry points out once he’s seated
“Harry, I’m going to touch you now if that’s alright?”
“I think that covers everything you need to know right now, if you’re confused about anything I can try and clarify, but you don’t have to worry too much - it’s not like we’re gonna throw you to the wolves we’re going to stick together.” Draco finished with an actual smile on his face as he hopped into bed sliding off his shoes and tucking them neatly next to his trunk.
“Mr. Malfoy” Snape slammed his fist on the desk and spoke in the tone that all Hogwarts students were terrified of.
“Thank you both, for handling this difficult and confusing situation so maturely. Mr. Potter, I am very glad to have you join our Slytherin family, you seem to be fitting right in. Mr. Malfoy thank you for welcoming him, I know your classmates took notice and it appears they are all following suit - I’m glad, I expect things to stay this way.” He warned before continuing, “any other issues I need to be aware of, do Mr. Weasley’s comments need to be further addressed?”
Of course, the happy mood couldn’t last long as a small group of Gryffindors approached the table.
“It was weird coming in the front door.” Sirius muttered looking around, “God, this place looks exactly the same.”
cw: extra evil Dumbles, trauma discussion, panic attacks (mentioned), abuse (mentioned)
?” he questioned,
“It’s alright Harry, I hadn’t expected you to. Tomorrow after you return from Hogsmeade you’ll have an hour to freshen up and change into some decent robes. Not the formal dress robes, but the nicest set you have. We will go to Professor Dumbledore’s office where we will be able to floo to the Ministry of Magic.”
Draco jumped a little
“No, I’ll meet you up there” He smiled and made his way into the professor’s academic office and not the personal one he had connected to the Slytherin common room.
By the time the group had to leave to make it back before curfew no one had been successful, Blaise had managed a few silver whisps but that was it.
“Did you think that you - the great Potter was immune to magical dangers!” Snape wanted to take back the words the moment he heard them, things were different now it was his job to protect Harry, after he was abandoned by everyone else, and here he was snapping into the evil teacher role that he used to scare any student into place.
“Ugh, you deserve the world, Harry Potter.” Pansy kissed Harry’s cheek, a habit she had with all her friends; Harry was starting to enjoy the friendly touches from his friends. He has never experienced casual, kind touch; his old Gryffindor friends would hug him whenever he survived something he shouldn’t have or after long summers apart, but never much more than that. All touch at the Dursley’s was bad. Pansy’s kisses were welcome and cherished, Dracos hugs were longed for and melted into, Harry was the luckiest kid in this whole damn school.
“Unless  you’ve invented a clothes-changing charm that I don’t know about I don’t think it’s possible for you to be changing robes right now.” Pansy joked without looking up from her book. Draco gave out a short yet loud chuckle from the other end of the couch.
Draco cared far more about picking out robes then Harry ever imagined
“Well?” Pansy questioned, being fully drawn away from her runes homework at the mention of something weird.
“They wouldn’t be mad, would they?” He asked quietly, afraid to hear the answer.
“Pans, you have to know how serious this is,” Draco demanded
Harry let out a weak breath
“Harry, how are you doing?” Remus decided to start slowly once everyone was seated,
"How did you-"  she cut Draco off before he could finish that thought
“Don’t be daft Harry, someone will walk with you to the great hall - it’s going to be a war zone out there where word gets out. You won’t be facing it alone.” he paused then added, “good night Pott- Harry” and with that Draco slid his curtains closed.
“Okay, it’s okay - you’re alright. I’m gonna take us back Sirius but you’ve got to hold on alright. Don’t let go you’re going to side along.” Remus ran his fingers through Sirius Hair once more and stole a final glance around the room before apparating back to Grimmauld Place.
At the other end of the castle, the Headmaster was sitting at his desk looking down at the letter he had just written. It was definitely against at least one code of ethics for him to send it, but it could be the key to getting his golden boy back where he belonged. Albus was sure that if he could just convince Harry that he was meant to be back in Gryffindor all the other pieces would begin falling into place. He decided to read the letter over again before sending it,
“Yeah,” Harry laughed “I know”
Harry flinched at the loud noise but still let out a sigh, he was exhausted and he was pretty sure Vernon had cracked a rib, but at least he was alone and out of that dream.
Montague realized them saying the team list and practice schedule would be posted on the common room bulletin board by tomorrow afternoon.
“I do not know the conditions that trigged this magic but I know that it was not done lightly. I will be doing my part to help assure Mr. Potter’s safety in this transition alongside the rest of you. Whatever has happened recently to set off this change will have been awful and very likely traumatic. The boy arriving tonight will not be the well-crafted persona of The Boy Who Lived that we have all been shown. We all know plenty about putting up masks, his is falling for the first time and he will need people to help him. Let’s all do our best to remember it.” He finished speaking and a heavy silence filled the room.
“I am again very sorry for the discomfort that caused, but you should have no problem removing the scars now that it’s finished.” She paused for a moment, it looked as if she was deciding whether or not to say more, “and Mr. Potter,” she took another deep breath then continued, “if you ever find yourself in need of my services again...just send an owl.” She spoke as if she knew a secret that no one else did and it made Harry feel uneasy but he didn’t ask any questions - not that he would have had the chance to, Rue Raywood made a very speedy exit after her ominous statement.
“Bug off” Pansy spoke not looking up from her book
Harry skeptically grabbed the quill thinking it must have some sort of enchantment and he put it to the paper and began writing,
“No, I didn’t send any either. Dumbledore told me not to.” He answered honestly
“Is Sirius here?” Harry asked eagerly, he was beyond nervous for the conversation ahead but he desperately wanted to see his Godfather again.
“Yes, just lost in thought is all.” Snape did not want to talk to his co-worker, he didn’t want to talk to anyone.
“I guess I’m used to always having to earn my keep and prove myself worthy, I don’t know how to handle when people do something nice or decent for me. I started doing chores with Aunt Petunia when I was four, and if they weren’t done well there were consequences.” Harry paused and took a deep breath, he wasn’t ready to share all the details yet.
“Very well then Mr. Potter let’s get to it.” Amelia smiled widely then shuffled some papers around before she started to read the report aloud,
Harry was initially scared by the bring flash of the magical camera but he felt that the photography was far less stressful than the interview. He also found that having his professor standing over him and watching the wizard work was quite calming.
After what felt like hours of a ruthless beating Harry was too broken to move from the floor to his bed. He laid on the old carpet and cried silently, how had things gotten so much worse.
When Draco noticed Harry’s change in body language he realized what he had done and what Harry must be thinking, “Oh no, Harry love I’m not upset with you at all. I’m furious with the muggles who raised you, and I’m using every bit of self-control to keep myself from hexing all of those damn Gryffindors for not feeling the same. Everyone deserves to be cared for, and the fact that you haven’t been is not your fault Harry - and I am going to do everything in my power to make you believe it as well”
When he made it to the fat lady slightly wet, and completely exhausted he was practically running on auto-pilot, he didn’t look around the common room or speak to anyone as he made his way to the dorm room that held his four-poster bed.
“So, I’m just a Slytherin now I changed houses, I didn’t even think that was possible. Sir, how did I do that?” Harry was far less frazzled than Snape had expected, but the boy also looked much worse than his professor ever remembered seeing him. He was far too skinny and the bags under his eyes were so deep Snape thought they might not ever end, and obvious tear tracks were covering his entire face.
Would anyone read Wolfstar smut if I wrote some, it would be in-universe but not part of the plot of this story?
“You fought a memory?” Blaise asked
mentions of: child abuse, torture
“No, not so bright. More like a golden leaf or the edges of a sunset.” Harry smiled, “What’s yours?”
Pansy cut Draco off, again, “Draco why don’t you go get Professor Snape, I’ll sit with Harry” Draco stood instantly but paused at Harry’s pleas,
“Thank you for coming to see me, I know it was dangerous. It meant a lot, it was good to talk to you.” He said once he was alone with the adults.
The Gryffindors gasped but didn’t react as strongly as the Slytherins who weren’t used to hearing Harry call the Dark Lord by his name, Draco tensed up and Harry could feel it due to how close they were to each other.
Happy new years to everyone, I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Also, how do you guys feel about me doing a part of an upcoming chapter with some Wolfstar pov from Grimmauld Place?
“Oh, it's a nutrient potion from Snape, Madame Pomfrey said I need to take them for a while and get enough to eat. She says I need to gain weight” Harry answered before quickly downing the vial and replacing it in his trunk alongside the other empty ones.
“Maybe there’s some other dark magic in you,” Blaise spoke in a joking tone but Draco felt like there was some validity to what was said.
Monday morning Harry found himself laughing alongside his friends at the Slytherin table for breakfast before classes. He had a great, care-free weekend. The group of fifth-years did their homework together Saturday afternoon and the rest of the weekend was spent hanging out and getting to know each other.
“Could I - you said if I needed...we could talk, about - stuff.” Harry sighed, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t bother you I’ve already ruined your sleep, it can wait until later.” Harry tried to take back his words but worried it would not be effective, he hadn’t meant to bother Draco.
“Let me see that” Hermione reached out and snatched the paper from Harry’s hands, crinkling the edges. She stared at it in shock for a few moments and right as Professor Flitwick was about to intervene she spoke out again.
Harry was waiting at the end of the hall to the boy’s dorm when Snape walked out of his office.
“Thanks, I will, I just have to take care of one more thing with Professor Snape first.” Harry stopped near the chair Draco was sitting in to talk on his way past
“Draco?” Harry squeaked out,
“Bloody course I am, come on.” Draco opened the door and let Harry enter first before carefully closing it behind himself.
“Ah, how’d it go Harry?” Greg questioned as he took a bite out of a roll when Harry sat
“I know a little about the magic that re-sorted you. Would you like to hear about it? Not to scare you or pressure you in any way...it’s just interesting and not a lot of people know about it. I just spent a lot of time reading after I found out what had happened…” Sirius trailed off anxiously. He wanted to keep talking with Harry and he was worried that if the conversation continued in the direction it was going in he would say something regrettable.
"Oh, it's really simple, just have a panic attack in front of him and the headmaster a few minutes before class and he’ll excuse you and a friend." Harry joked about a serious matter in a way he probably wouldn’t have if he and Draco and not just spent so much time exchanging funny stories to lighten to mood.
“He’s right, I should speak for myself” When Harry noticed the fourth Gryffindor was Hermione he took a moment to regain his confidence, he hadn’t expected to see her or Ron. He was ready to stand up to Neville, Dean, and Seamus - but not Hermione.
“Draco, you said we would both be at quidditch practice but how - we’re both seekers even if Montague wanted me on the team I can’t take your spot.”
Draco has always been a light sleeper, growing up with a father like Lucius Malfoy it was essential for survival if he was asleep when a bought of anger hit his father he needed to wake up and prepare himself for any possible punishment that might come his way. This is probably why neither of his other roommates had heard Harry’s stifled cries and pleas, Draco quickly rose from his bed to check on Harry he cast a silencing charm for Blaise and Theo, so they wouldn’t be woken.
Harry paused like he was thinking, but he knew the answer - of course, Ron, Hermione, most of the Weasleys, his old dormmates, and even Hagrid had all been rather harsh or upset with him after a nightmare at least once. Honestly, Harry didn’t blame them he knew the screaming and thrashing must be annoying, other people shouldn’t have to lose sleep just because Harry was, however, something told him that his professor would not be too happy with that declaration. Harry  settled on saying,
“Thoughts about Mr. Potter?” She questioned
“yes, this is clearly the work of a black quill and your hand would be more than enough proof to get Professor Umbridge removed from the castle. There may also be additional legal consequences. If you wish for us to do so Harry”
. Maybe this was all honest, maybe Draco meant it all...maybe there was a future for the pair of them? Even if there was, Harry couldn’t bring himself to respond to that instead, he changed the topic,
"This is immaculate work, some of your best Draco and it was on a very difficult draught. I can only assume that's because of Mr. Potter, is that correct?" he started
“Anything you need me to do today Aunt Petunia.” Harry thought if he did something they wanted first he could soften the blow that changing the date of his departure would cause.
“I don’t know, but we’re gonna figure it out. We’re gonna figure it out and we’re going to keep Harry safe.” Remus promised as he played with Sirius’ hair.
Sirius took a deep breath,
It felt so good to fly again, Draco, Blaise, and Pansy were trying to pelt him with enchanted pinecones while Vincent and Greg tried to fend them off Harry tried to catch them without getting hit or letting any hit the ground. It reminded Harry of primary school physical education classes but with quidditch - it wasn’t actually quidditch but it felt close enough for it to be fun.
“So Potter, I’ve been talking with everyone whos still here on the team and we’re all itching to see how tonight goes. I’ll be trying out for a chaser spot - we’ve got two open now but Zabini is probably going to the other spot. You’ll have to do the formal seeker training but we all agree it’s be completely idiotic to give it to anyone else - because honesty you’re the only thing that’s kept us from taking the cup for years now.” Draco explained as Harry finished his roll.
“Show him your hand Mr. Potter” Snape requested
Harry didn’t think before speaking “Oh I don’t know,  maybe Voldemort’’
“Thank you, professor,” Harry mumbled as he hastily mans his way out of the charms room.
“Sirius,” He spoke much more softly than the older man had, but just as happy.
This is not going to end well, Draco thought as their professor straightened her back and shot a nasty glare at Harry.
“I spent weeks working with Lupin to cast that Patronus, and I’ve had help with all that other stuff, I’ll do what I can but we’ll probably learn more in class.” as he said that Draco and a few others made a face
Snape had an hour to prepare for his new student, he would have to write some memos of his own to all of the other Slytherins, he needed to speak with Mr. Rackharrow about keeping the common room empty, and he needed to speak with whoever Harry Potter would be rooming with. Snape glided out of his office and scanned the common room looking for his head boy.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter.” He said looking them over and opening the door across the room.
“No, we actually don’t get to talk that much.” he paused before adding something else in a softer tone, “I don’t know much about my parent’s time at school, or after for that matter. Really I only know that I have my mother’s eyes and that they died protecting me.”
“Could be worse…” Zabini wondered out loud while people were still scanning over the documents.
Breakfast was also far more pleasant for the Slytherins today than it had been the day before, the Gryffindors were keeping to themselves and no one had asked how or why Harry and Draco woke up in the same bed, so Harry was counting this as a win.
“What do you mean?” Harry questioned
“Dinky, I need you to bring me a glass of water for Mr. Potter, and A special blanket from my quarters. I keep it on the bottom shelf of the bedside table. And please bring them to the hallway, loud noise may not be the best at the moment.” He spoke softly
Shout-out to Aegopodium who always leaves comments that make me laugh. Thank you for reading and supporting my story it means the world to me.
“Stanley Borealis, official ministry court medical examiner. I’ll need to examine your hand for the official report. Are you still experiencing any pain?”
“Granger said something to him, I don’t know what. Professor Flitwick asked them both to stay back so we don’t know what happened. She came storming out a few minutes before Harry, and when he came out he was like this.” Draco gestured to his friend, “he got a perfect mark on the charms exam.” He added in an even softer voice.
“Yeah Pads, I’ll take it tomorrow. Come on let’s get you something to eat, I’m sure you haven’t left this room once today.” Remus, to no one’s surprise, was completely correct and Sirius’ stomach rumbled at the notion of food.
“Could I keep using your blanket a while longer, Sir?” Harry asked with the edges of anxiety seeping into every word. He didn’t want Snape to leave if it meant taking the blanket with him, he felt safer in it. Like Pansy’s gentle hand squeeze but all over his body.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was relieved or nervous, he was expecting Snape to ask about what happened after charms - which he was seriously dreading. He wasn’t expecting Dumbledore to come up at all, which meant it could be bad news.
“So far as I can tell this is a perfectly brewed Draught of Peace, your grades will reflect so. I will also award five-points to Slytherin for your hard work.” Snape said upon his return, he was very proud of his students, he hadn’t expected this from either of them. Draco had always been at the top of his class but this was a difficult potion that none of the other fifth-years had brewed perfectly yet. Harry’s work had always been impeccably average, Severus had attributed some of his misfortune potion attempts to his previous partner but he hadn’t expected the potion to be this well no matter who Potters partner was.
Harry was not at all interested in reading them. He quickly signed the pages and looked up to Snape for permission to leave.
“We just needed to see the traitor in person.”
It wasn’t until he thought about how sleepy he was that he realized he’d probably be sleeping in a very hostile dorm. He already knew where Ron and Neville stood and Dean and Seamus were always some of the first to turn on Harry when others did.
Harry sat down at a bench underneath a bunch of tall trees, when he was visible again he got to work writing three letters.
The sight of his cloak gave him an idea, he could sneak out the window that night, Vernon hadn’t replaced the bars after the second year so as long as he was invisible all Harry needed to do was aim for the bushes. He could get out and spend some proper time with his owl, he could even send more letters to Remus, Hermione, and Hagrid hopefully someone could help him get to Diagon Ally - he received his letter two weeks ago, which meant it was mid-August already and he’s only got a few more weeks to get his things for the year. If he couldn’t get there soon he’d have to ask the Dursleys to drop him off in Muggle London the day before so he could get his shopping down and spend the night at the Leaky Coldurin.
“I don’t think Lily or James could ever be mad at you Harry. You were the most important and wonderful piece of their lives.” Sirius spoke with confidence and honesty. Sure James wouldn’t have been happy with a child in Slytherin, he hated the house nearly as much as Sirius did; but that didn’t mean he could ever be upset with Harry.
“Professor, could you please grab me a vial of instant cut closure from medical storage. Most of this will heal itself with some assistance from the potions I will send you back with. However, there are two particularly nasty ones that I  feel should be dealt with now. Then we have just a few more things to discuss and you can be on your way. I’m not going to keep you here Mr. Potter, I know how much you dislike it.” Madame Pomfrey spoke with a smile that Severus was grateful for, he wasn’t sure if he could manage to smile right now if his life depended on it - even with all his years of spy training. He was ready to kill the muggles that did this.
The room was elongated with two beds lined up on both walls, in between the beds furthest from the door was the fireplace, and on the other side of the door was a sink with a mirror and a door that Harry assumed led to a bathroom. He felt oddly at home in this foreign room, he wondered if he had made a mistake years ago when he convinced the hat to place him in Gryffindor. Harry was pulled from his thoughts when Draco started to speak again.
Harry nodded, “Thank you, Sir,”
Remus’s face scrunched up in confusion as he read, something wasn’t making sense, “Did you get any letters for Harry this summer?”
Harry paused, trying to decide how honest to be; figuring the news of the court case would probably be fairly public he opted to tell the whole story.
“Protego!” He shouted jumping in front of his classmates hoping to block as many of the attacks as possible.
,” Harry vaguely gestured around “I wanted him to come.” Harry was a little embarrassed but he spoke with confidence.
“Yes, professor?” the boy spoke upon entry
Severus found himself very grateful for his occlumency skills, it allowed him to occlude his mind and not snap at the women in front of him. Whatever Harry had done to gain himself detention shouldn’t matter. Torture is not a legal form of punishment in any school - especially not a magical one where there are so many other effective ways to reprimand a student. He had probably hosted more detentions than any other professor, and even he couldn’t think up any action that would warrant that kind of punishment.
“I’m sorry I shouldn’t have -”
“Is this a bloody joke? Harry Potter what a load of dung.” He yelled
When he got to the back of the Cauldron using his wand to access the wizarding world, he quickly found Tom and told him he would be staying for one night. Harry nearly forgot to request a silencing charm on the room and for an alarm clock to be placed inside before he handed off his things and headed for Gringotts with his wand and bank key.
“I trust you two can brew your Draught of Peace without blowing the classroom to bits. However, it would be highly unprofessional of me to leave you unintended. I’ll be at my desk grading some summer work if you need anything - I do hope you won’t” He said once they had set up their cauldron and gathered the needed ingredients. They both agreed so Severus walked off to tend to his work.
cw: night terrors, anxiety/panic attacks (kinda, not really though)
“I’m going to talk to Dumbledore tomorrow after we hear from Harry about the trial,” Remus announced as soon as he was sure Harry was gone.
“You’re honestly doing alright?” Draco asked as soon as the pair had settled into the common room.
He stood and straightened his robes, then fixed his posture and followed Dumbledore inside.
“Is everything all right?”
“Very well, I do hope you remember that we hold ourselves to high expectations in this house, and well I know that punishment cannot always be avoided I suggest you do not make a habit out of them, am I understood?”
“Yes Mr. Potter what you described is a blood quill also known as a black quill, and I understand Miss Parkinson has already informed you that they are not permitted here at Hogwarts or in most wizarding facilities.”
“Well if you lot are done eye-banging each other we need to go change and get ready.” Harry choked on the last of his pumpkin juice and Draco’s fair-skinned checks turn a cherry blush color and he shot daggers at his old friend.
Severus Snape was lost in thought sitting at the teacher’s table for breakfast in the great hall. He was not looking forward to the meeting he would be attending this morning. He knew Albus was going to try and pull something and his newest student had been through enough this week with his headmaster making matter worse.
Ignoring that comment, Remus continued, “Harry doesn’t blame you, he’s said so himself. Let’s just focus on the good news which is that Harry is excited to meet up with us, and he’s happy. He told us he was happy Siri, he wants us to be happy too.”
Harry especially didn’t like this, he knew the Headmaster would have questions about why he got re-sorted but Harry didn’t want to talk about it. Everyone in Slytherin had told him there was no rush to talk about the things that had happened, he wanted to wait a while.
The yelling made Harry flinch away but Draco didn’t miss the look of guilt that covered his face as he did.
“Why does what I’m thinking about concern you Minerva?” This is exactly the type of conversation Snape was hoping to avoid today.
“Oh, Hello…” He trailed off,
“Petrificus Totalus”
“It’s just a claiming drought, brewed by myself, not a student. I assure you that it’s safe.”
“The password is Niffler Weed, however, that may change throughout the year if we suspect a security risk. A perfect will inform you of any changes.” They spoke very little on the long trek up to the medical wing which Harry was grateful for because he didn’t have much to say
“Harry, it’s Draco you’re dreaming but you need to wake up now,”
“It’s alright Draco, they’re your friends and you trust them, besides if they started talking about me they’d be talking about you too.” Harry wasn’t too worried it’s not like things could get that much worse for him
“She’s just been, merlin this is awkward - she been waiting for us to get together. Most people don’t know because my father would, god I can’t even imagine what he would do if he found out, but I’m gay” that last part he spoke in a voice hardly above a whisper
“I’m ready for a few fucking words with the man myself.” Sirius snapped, now that Harry was gone he felt comfortable letting out all of his anger.
“Oh, it was Dudley’s and he’s much bigger than me. Most of my clothes are just his old things.” Harry shrugged and pulled the jacket tightly around himself.
Snape only looked to Draco, telling him to explain himself without having to speak.
Harry jolted awake, he was sweating harder than he had been after riding Buckbeak, and frequent tremors were coursing down his spine and spreading throughout his body, but as Harry started to slow his breathing and gather his surroundings his blood felt as if it had been replaced by ice water.
“I haven’t - I’m not ready for all of it yet. Honestly, I don’t even understand it all yet. I just know things got really bad, after the tournament that is. The end of term and this past summer were...awful. When I came back I hoped things would be okay again, but everyone shut me out; I mean everyone, not a single Gryffindor had anything nice to say. We had fought before but I could just tell something was different.”
“Mr. Potter, if you are feeling well enough for me to do so I need to leave. If you need me here I can post-pone my meeting.” Snape spoke, finally standing. He had a meeting with Dumbledore in five minutes about Harry’s case.
“First you get my brother killed!” Weasley started spitting hateful words the minute he was in Harry’s eyesight.
“So...how was it?” Draco finally snapped and asked the question, Harry made it back to the common room and sat down with Draco, Blaise, and Pansy. Draco was able to hold in his desire to know how the court case had gone for approximately 90 seconds before he couldn’t wait any longer. Pansy and Blaise both let out a small chuckle as Harry sighed and went into the story.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter, how did your uncle react when you would have a nightmare?” Snape didn’t know if he wanted to hear the answer to this.
“I’m glad you’re adjusting Potter, come and let me know if you need anything.” that was Milicent Bulstrode
“I have received word that we will be gaining another student tonight, some very old school magic made itself known this evening, and a student is being transferred into our house. I do not have many details, as such I don’t know what led this magic to the decision that this student needs to be moved, all I know is that it is happening tonight and it cannot be undone. So we will be welcoming this student in, it may be a challenge but this magic would not have been activated if it were not necessary. Understand?” the professor asked. Urquhart was shocked but nodded in agreement allowing his professor to continue.
“Draco calm down and let go of Harry’s arm.” Pansy’s voice was firm but soft and Draco finally noticed the horrified look on Harry’s face. The second Draco let go Harry flung his hand back and cradled it to his chest.
Harry started to cry, Draco had noticed him and cared about him, for the first time in his life someone had reached out and offered him help and genuine kindness, not just because he was The-Boy-Who-Lived.
Snape stood where Harry managed an affirmative nod. Harry tensed when Snape was behind him and out of sight, subconsciously he was expecting a blow. When none came he relaxed slightly under the sudden pressure.
Which was exactly what he wanted.
of than.” Harry’s joking tone made Draco chuckle from the other side of the couch.
Subject name: Harry James Potter
“Have you already got your dark mark, or are you waiting till you can get You-Know-Who to give it to you personally!” Now several of the Slytherins shook with anger at his assumption that their whole house was in the Dark Lords pocket. While some of their families supported the dark wizard, they were all children unable to fight or escape their parents’ believes.
“5 points from Gryffindor for that comment Ms. Granger, as well as 10 points off for everyone who cast a spell in this classroom today - I will be checking your wand history to assure no one is missed. As for you Mr. Weasley.” Snape approached Ron slowly emphasizing every word as he walked. “For your reckless behavior, and for instigating this ordeal, 2 detentions and an additional 50 points from Gryffindor.”
“He’s right Progslet, I didn’t believe it at first but...I see you now Harry. I love you, and I’m so relieved that you’re happy.” Sirius turned to Draco, “If I catch word of any one of you hurting him in any way - I’ll turn into the man everyone thought I was.” he said in a stone-cold voice
“The castle would not have requested this exam if all were in order Severus, I’m not sure what to expect but I am not optimistic.” The stout which spoke calmly reading results as they came in. Her face fell and contorted as she read which Severus knew was a bad sign, she tusked and opened the curtains.
“Your what?” Hermione shrieked
“You’re staying?” Harry asked hopefully as he craned his neck to see Draco
As if on cue Vernon shoved the door open sending it crashing into the plastered wall, shaking the curtains, and the closet door.
“You will be writing ‘I must not tell lies’ and you can stop when I think the message has really sunk in” she smiled in a way that made Harry’s nerves start randomly firing
“Are you alright?” he asked quietly
“Thank you, Professor, I got a memo for myself saying I would need to see Mr. Potter today. Right, this way Harry dear, just sit on the bed I’ll run the diagnostic charm shouldn’t take long. I’ll have to discuss anything unusual I find with your head of house because you don’t have a magical medical proxy listed. That’s it just sit, you’ll hardly even notice the magic.” Madame Pomfrey was happier than usual today, possibly because Harry had come here with all his bones this time.
“Alright, can you hold this piece?” Draco held out one side of the blanket and Harry took it gently. Draco rounded to the other side and grabbed that piece. He pulled the blanket across Harry’s torso and put the little remaining piece on his lap. Harry gave him the side he had been holding and Draco repeated the same action.
“I’ll tell them about your ugly scars, or the way you scream in your sleep crying like a little kid after every bad dream, I could tell them that all they have to do to get you wrapped around their fingers is to promise not to leave you how you’re so gullible and desperate you’ll do to feel important. I could tell them you a fagg-” Ron was cut off as Malfoy’s fist collided with his face.
“Someone must have been intersecting them. Otherwise, Hedwig would have brought them back to Harry and he’d know we never got them. Someone wanted him to think we were ignoring him.” Sirius slammed his fist on the counter, “Damn it all!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is all of this?” He asked as soon as he saw the state of the study, books were everywhere and his partner looked like he was ready to collapse, but he held a large, dusty book close to his face.
“Okay, remember  we use last names I’ve already been talking to some other fifth years so we’re all gonna stick together for now but we’ll get you introduced to everyone eventually.” Draco was a very enthusiastic speaker when he wasn’t acting the role of ‘All-Powerful Malfoy Heir’ Harry noticed the boy hardly took the time to breathe.
“Thank you, ma’am ”
“Of course.”
“Mr. Potter,” Flitwick’s calm voice interrupted Harry’s thoughts. “I assure you, Mrs. Granger’s outburst will be dealt with. I am very confident that you did not cheat on this exam, I only wanted to speak with you about your mark because I think it proves you are exactly where you need to be. No matter what anyone else says.”
“You know that we look out for each other but that doesn’t mean we won’t ever have problems when they come up we deal with them in-house. Our business isn’t for the rest of the school, if you can’t handle it on your own get a moderator but deal with it here. Appearance and respect is a big deal, you are representing this house and all the people in it anytime you’re out there, so keep that in mind. I’m sure there is lots of formal wizarding etiquette that you don’t know about but we’ll teach you, just do your best.  We also pride ourselves on academics, keep your grades up because a failing mark means a meeting with Snape, and trust me you do not want to have an academic meeting with him. If you need help just ask, we all have different areas of expertise so we all study together and tutor each other anyways.” Draco paused and took a sleepy breath,
“Well,” Harry cleared his throat, “She had just told us that we wouldn’t be doing any magic in class this year, and a lot of people were really upset, it got loud in there fast. She got us all settled a bit and asked what we would even need to practice magic for. She said we were students and there was nothing we could possibly need to defend ourselves again.” Harry paused and glanced nervously at Professor Snape, who very strongly told him to continue with a single stare.
“I was stressed about exams last year and was just pacing about when the door showed up, I’ve come up here a few times since and it’s always a bit different. Like it knows exactly what I’ll need. It’s never been like this before, normally there are sofas and bookcases.” she gestured around the room that looked so vastly different then before.
“Y-yes sir...a little.”
The pain was growing more intense but Harry slowly lifted his head to look around the room, he instinctively reached for his wand when his eyes landed on Lord Voldemort standing at the foot of his bed. He didn’t have his wand and there was nowhere for him to run,
“Thank you, Professor.” He muttered before swiftly grabbing his belongings and scurrying out of the office and down to his common room, his hand was throbbing and Harry had no idea what to do next.
“Sir?” Harry inquired once he felt the cool glass in his hand
“That’s not a super-duper healthy way to handle things, mate. What do you think the mind herald would have to say about that way of thinking?” Remus knew he’d probably push a few buttons but he wanted his partner to see how ridiculous he was being.
“Yes Sir, it true.” Harry supplied
“You took two doses in one night?” Snape demanded
He was standing there, just him and Voldemort and Percy Weasley’s dead body. In a flash, the dark wizard had vanished as well, for a moment Harry thought the terror was ending until he heard a pop and then quickly one after another he had heard 7 more. He looked up from Percy’s lifeless form and let out another shriek.
“How long has Dumbledore known?” Sirius asked, growing even angrier but keep his soft hands on Harry’s.
“Harry’s been sending letters,” Remus haded the note to Sirius “He thinks we’ve been ignoring him. Why didn’t we get them?” he pressed but Sirius didn’t respond until he had read Harry’s letter 4 times over.
“Thank you, Dinky.” Snape bowed his head quickly in reply and turned back to his student. In the few seconds Snape had been speaking with Dinky, Harry’s pleas had stopped and were replaced by the quick, shallow breaths that come with anxiety and panic attacks.
me, posting a chapter
“So Professor Snape know about-”
Had Harry seemed, interested in him and what did it mean if he was, they couldn’t actually be together not with his father and Harry’s role in the war how could it ever work out. At least Professor Snape hadn’t seemed bothered by how close they were in his classroom, and Pansy was obviously okay with it, so maybe - if Harry wanted - they could keep it secret, at least from Lucius. Draco thought he was getting ahead of himself, but he couldn’t stop himself from imagining a life with Harry Potter. It was after 1 am when he finally called it a night and pulled his curtains shut seeing all 3 of his roommates were sleeping.
“That won’t be a problem. Ron and Hermione aren’t interested in hearing anything I have to say, no one from Gryffindor is. So I don’t have anyone to share any secrets with even if I wanted to.”  Harry didn’t think about how vulnerable he must sound as he spoke, it was the silence that followed that made him realize the extent of what he had just said.
“That’s a detention Mr. Potter, tonight at 8 pm in my office.” She scolded and then turned to the rest of the class and started her lesson.
Somewhat ironically, It was during that exact thought that trouble made its way into the potions classroom.
wong but I didn’t want to overstep. Albus had warned me not to and with Severus watching me so closely to make sure I didn’t wolf out on any students I couldn’t risk it.” Remus’ calm tone did little to ease the tension in the room,
Draco was ready to rush to the boy’s side the minute Severus said he was upset but he liked knowing how much his god-father cared even if he couldn’t show it as much while at school.
“Can I have a second?” Harry softly asked Draco who quietly stepped back into the entryway so Harry could say his goodbyes.
“What’s wrong Harry?” Sirius asked sensing the boy’s sudden discomfort.
Once the group all had a thorough look around the room Harry said he’d try and teach them the charm.
“Harry, you do belong here you wouldn’t be here if you didn’t and we’ve noticed it too. I couldn’t believe how natural it feels to have you here. I don’t know how they do things over in Gryffindor but we take care of each other, and it’s not because of any quid-pro-quo bullshit we’re a family Harry, and we all want you to understand and accept that. The only thing any of us expect from you is that you treat us the same. There is no other shoe, mate you don’t have to apologize because you’re not a burden. We want- no
He was lost in thought about Lily and James Potter when there was a rasp on his door, when he opened it Urquhart stood followed by three of his fifth-year boys - Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and Draco Malfoy.
“Harry, what’s wrong.” He called out as he and Pansy made their way across the room.
Montague had the whole group start with flying exercises that reminded Harry of muggle athletes running sprints, after about 20 minutes of that he instructed the otters to land and get some water if needed as he enchanted some regular balls of varying sizes so they didn’t have to fight with the actual set of quidditch balls.
“I bought it in a muggle shop a few years ago. They call it a weighted blanket, it’s made to help with anxiety and over-stimulation and the stress they cause. It has been of use to me several times over the years. It helped?” Snape inquired
“No - I didn’t mean you I meant that class if this is what the  whole semester is going to be like we won’t learn a thing.” Draco clarified and continued, “Weasley nearly flew out of his chair, but Granger held him back, a damn good thing too because I swear I’m seconds away from hexing him and any other stupid weasels that get in my way.” he was practically spitting and Harry almost defended his ex-best friends out of habit but found that he didn’t want to - he agreed.
“We can talk more about it tomorrow but I know how much you enjoy it and frankly we could use the talent if you’re willing to play.” Harry almost saw Snape smile and he was grinning at the idea of being a broom again.
“I’m sorry. It was an accident, I’m sorry.” He tensed up again. Not only had he lost the item that was giving him some relief but he had probably upset his professor.
Albus”
“Professor...could I ask, where did you get that blanket?” Harry embarrassedly asked a question that came to mind
Harry liked this woman, she was kind and she explained everything before she started, “Yes Ma’am, I’m ready now.”
He sighed and pulled out an old potions textbook from his bag. Harry loved potions, it was science with rules that if followed did something amazing, Harry could follow directions. He hid his potions talent from his friends - he had enough attention as it was and growing up with the Durselys he was taught that standing out, even with good grades was bad if he outshined Dudley - so he worked extra hard to make it look like he was just alright in the class. It worked for him, but he longed to know more and he knew that this year he could work harder with the excuse that if he didn’t receive an “Outstanding” mark on his O.W.L he couldn’t advance any further in Snape’s class the following term.
Okay, wolfstar next chapter. I promise
“No one has been as good as you.” Surprisingly Draco spoke up, none of the Slytherins had ever admitted it out loud but everyone enjoyed Lupins classes. Draco had begged his father not to vote him out, which was fruitless but he promised his friends that he’d try.
“I’m going to wizard court later today after we get back from Hogsmeade.” he started off
“3 detentions.”
Harry felt too stunned and embarrassed to move or react.
Pansy was strict with the study schedule they had set up that morning, so after lunch, the group had spent nearly 2 hours in the library. Harry found it much nicer than studying with Ron and Hermione - Ron would have spent the whole time complaining and Hermione would have been bragging about her intelligence not giving either of the boys a chance to figure things out before swopping in and stating the answer like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“No one is leaving!”
“Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy please stay back a moment.” The professor called as students filtered out.
“Wait, they all blame me. The Weasleys blame me for Percy’s death.” Harry was shaking, he had been blaming himself for the death all summer long but a part of him knew that his friends would help him to come out of it. Maybe it was all his fault, he should have tried harder to protect him, he should have sacrificed himself.
It took another five minutes before any of the Gryffindors showed up, stumbling in recklessly whilst making an absurd amount of noise. The snakes had all decided that they weren’t going to start anything up today, there newest member was going to be under enough stress without getting into a fight with his former mates - but if someone else started a problem they would be sure to handle it. Draco wanted today to go as smoothly as possible while also showing his new roommate how serious he was about protecting him by stepping in if there was any trouble.
Harry didn’t want to answer this, why had he opened his mouth at all, he should have known they’d be questions and now it's too late to go back.
“Yes!” he called out quietly and pulled a small package of Every Flavor Beans out of the break in the floor where he was able to hide a few of his items before the Dursleys locked away his school things. His wand, the invisibility cloak, a roll of parchment, and a self-filling quill, any food he could get a hold of that wouldn’t rot, and a few of his lighter school books.
Harry worked harder than he ever had before in all of his classes, he knew the seriousness of Snape’s threat to an academic meeting. His first opportunity to prove himself would come on Wednesday when he took his first test of the year; Professor Flitwick announced that the fifth years had a review exam of all the charms they had previously learned that were a part of their O.W.Ls.
“Dumbledore said they were taking it to the school Governors today as well,” Harry added
“Yeah, it helped loads. Thank you for letting me use it, Dinky brought it back to your room.” Harry eagerly responded
“You’ve never gotten a perfect mark on an exam! You must’ve cheated. Professor!” her shrill voice echoed through the classroom and it made Harry subtlety flinched away from her.
"And then you're probably going to snog...or you know something even
With Harry on the bed and the spell casts Poppy closed the curtains and cast a privacy charm so she could speak with Severus before meeting with Harry.
“Maybe you should work on being able to keep the dog at bay long enough to say the word Slytherin first?” Remus cheekily suggested
“No of course not, what would you possibly need to do actual magic for?” The pink-clad toadish professor asked
“Geeze, Potter I know you were raised by muggles but did they raise you in a barn” Draco regretted the words as he said them - that is something old Draco would say, not new Draco who has a real shot of getting close to the boy he’s been crushing after for years - why did he say that.
“...Stay please.” Harry looked to be on the edge of tears when Severus saw him
“Pads, you need to give yourself a break. You had no reason to think Harry was sending letters, just like you had no reason to think Peter would betray us-”
“No ma’am, I lost count somewhere around 17...I couldn’t focus on counting anymore; it hurt a lot. I’d wager it was about 30 or 40. I’m sorry, I’m not sure.” Harry felt a little guilty for not knowing the answer but Rue didn’t seem to mind at all.
“Harry, are you alright?” Pansy’s soft voice filled his ears
The fifth-years had double potions with Gryffindor first thing after breakfast, then single Herbology and Charms before lunch. It looked like on Tuesdays and Thursdays all of the Slytherin fourth and fifth years were free after lunch aside from the few students who were taking muggle studies. Unfortunately both double potions and double DADA we’re classes held with Gryffindor and Slytherin.
“Oh, uhh...what’s your...favorite color?” Draco had panicked and said something random so his voice rang with uncertainty.
Before Harry even finished sitting down Snape was reaching into his pocket looking for a vial; there were some brews that he always carried on his person - one of them was a claiming drought. Once Harry was settled into his chair Severus uncorked the vial and pressed it into Harry’s hand.
Harry slipped quietly into the garage and started scanning the room for his bright red racing broom. It took a few moments, but eventually, he found it hidden under a pile of Dudleys larger old toys.
“Like Hufflepuff?” Draco questioned he was shocked, Draco couldn’t stand the loud yellow color they all sported
“Yes, of course, I’m staying. Now go to sleep” Draco smiled and gently placed Harry’s face back on the pillow before doing the same himself.
Draco let out a small chuckle once Snape was out of earshot, “It’s weird isn’t in when he gets all teachery like that. I had spent so much time with him as my ‘Uncle Sev’ growing up that I nearly cried after my first potions class, I didn’t know he could be so mean.”
Yes, it's short and a little bit of a filler, but honestly my heart hurt when Harry found out that Snape knew Lily and we will be seeing some wholesome (and less wholesome where James and Sirius are involved) marauders content in the future. Also, first-contact Drarry in the next chapter!!!!! I'm so excited for yall to read it, but it's really so long I'll be editing for at least an hour so rip me.
“What?” Harry questioned, ignoring the fact that he hadn’t finished eating the food he placed in his mouth.
“Alright Mr. Potter, first I just need you to confirm that this was an isolated occurrence. Have there been any other times you’ve been made to use a Black Quill, either before or after the incident from this report?”
“Sorry Professor,” Draco muttered now that he was thoroughly embarrassed, not that he was embarrassed to be holding Harry, he would have been embarrassed if his godfather had caught him cuddling with anyone.
“Someone who has always been punished for being better than the people around them,” Harry spoke grimly and stood to go change
“It’s my pleasure as well Madam Bones,” Harry bowed his head as Draco had shown him and then he sat down in the seat he was given next to Professor Snape. Severus curtly nodded at Harry once he was seated as a way to tell him that he was doing fine. The professor had planned on giving Harry the same brief lesson that Draco had but found that his godson had beat him to it.
“I do,” Harry answered without any hesitation, “I’ve been happier since the resort, happier than I remember being in a long time. A year
“Of course I am, you just saved this potion.” Draco paused and gave a cheeky smile, “It’s seven drops”
“Thank you for your honesty Mr. Potter, do you have any recent injuries that have not begun healing and  scaring yet?” Harry’s breath hitched but he nodded again.
Sorry the spacing might be a bit weird on this one, I tried to fix it and my computer said "absolutely not"
We're really getting into the story now and I'm so excited. I hope you enjoy it!!!!!
“yeah mate, It’s me.” Draco smiled and Harry quickly reached out for him but pulled his hand back as though it had been shocked.
As dinner passed without a single nasty comment they relaxed, the only thing left for Harry and Draco to get through today was Snape’s make-up potion class.
“My favorite color...is probably... yellow,” Harry spoke with a similar uncertainty, he wasn’t expecting this, he thought Draco was going to want some a little more interesting than his favorite color.
Harry and Draco anxious walked into the shack, Draco has always avoided the building and the last memory Harry had from inside was less than pleasant.
Surrounding him, in almost a perfect circle was the Weasly family each of them dead - their bodies positioned exactly like Percy’s.
“I’m gonna change my robes now, I need to write to Sirius after dinner and I doubt I’ll have time for both.” Harry dropped himself dramatically onto the chair next to where Pansy was sitting on the couch.
, Remus. What could have happened, it had to be truly horrible to awake the oldest and most powerful magic in the castle. How can I subject him to go back to it? I can’t do it, Rem. I can’t” A tear fell down his face,
(See the end of the chapter for
“I hope so, I don’t think I could face a class with her again if it doesn’t.”
“That’s alright Mr. Potter, I think I’ve got enough information to take to the legal team. Why don’t you sit down.”
“How about you budger off” Goyle spoke and he and Crabbe stood up on either side of Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco, you and Miss Parkinson can take Mr. Potter to the potions storage room, there is some essence of murtlap with the healing salves apply a thin layer on the back of his hand. It will help with the pain, I need to speak with the headmaster - I will try and handle this privately with him, Harry but he may request your presence.” Snape spoke firmly and it was slightly comforting for Harry, knowing someone else was looking out for him and not leaving him to solve a problem on his own. He was sure that if he were still in Gryffindor, he would have been forced to deal with this on his own.
Harry sorted through his things and packed his truck - Hedwig was there and she still had no letters for him.
Draco cast a shrinking charm and the jacket shrunk down to perfectly fit Harry’s slim figure. Draco, who had never worn any hand-me-downs in his life didn’t understand why Harry hadn’t gotten himself new things when he got to Hogwarts; he knew the boy had the finical means to do so. The Potters weren’t
Harry sat instantly at Amelia’s words. His legs felt like they were going to give out underneath him, and he could feel his panicky breath rising in his chest.
Unfortunately, even the best of weekends had to end and this Monday was bound to bring all sorts of trouble. The Slytherins had Defense again today and Dumbledore had not made any significant progress since his meeting with Snape and Harry, so Umbridge was still there to torture them all. The dread Harry felt imagining another class with the pink-clad women was momentarily relieved when an unfamiliar owl delivered him a letter.
Harry took one last look around the room before doing the same. He cast a vibrating alarm on his bed for 6 am - which gave him about 4 hours to sleep so he took his potion and climbed under the blanket, with the dreamless sleep it only took a few minutes before Harry was drifting off.
“Of course sir, I will control myself better moving forward,” Harry promised,
“Harry, I am in no position to share your private history with anyone unless you are in danger - as such, should Professor Dumbledore wish to send you back this summer he will need to be informed of the situation. That is the only person who will ever hear a word of what you shared today, I promise. That is yours to tell whenever you’re ready with whoever you want. If anyone has made you feel otherwise in the past they were wrong, you have a right to privacy.” Snape assured.
Severus Snape was finally sitting in his office, checking over his lesson plans for the first day of class after talking to all the new Slytherins about expectations and house rules when he received an odd memo. Severus had received magic memos before, they were like howlers but without the yelling and exploding, but he had never seen one like this.
“Boy, don’t you have any respect! I told you, one more time and you’d be sleeping in the bloody closet!” His uncle bellowed and Harry winced at the tone before he heard a second voice and felt a stabbing pain violent collided with his head.
“Course we can.” Pansy’s friendliest voice filled the room, “But seriously finish that water or Snape will have both our heads.” she let out a gentle laugh and Harry quickly finished the glass.
“That’s not fair -” Ron was cut off by Snape
Again Draco considered cursing his best friend but stopped as he heard the common room door open, he turned to see who it was. It was harry and Draco became filled with concern at his distressed stance and the obvious look of pain on his face.
“Please please don’t go. Draco please don’t go, I don’t - please don’t leave me alone.” Harry was sobbing and his voice cracked with desperation but he never reached out for Draco hell he hardly
“I’ve never hated you, I was jealous and hurt because my whole life I heard stories of you and I knew you were my age and I just wanted to know you and to be your friend and you weren’t interested. So I watched you all the time I couldn’t take my eyes off you, and it wasn’t because you’ve fought dementors or the Dark Lord or any of the “Chosen One” bullshit. I wanted to know you, Harry Potter. Now that you’re here and I know how poorly you’ve been treated I’m going to help you, and of course, I want to make up for all the awful things I did, but that’s not the only reason why. I care for you Harry, and not out of some new obligation, I’ve always cared and now I can show it.”
“It would be best if you took it right after you finish your meal, gives it more time to fully absorb. Now off you go.” Snape called waving Harry out the door.
“Not Vernon, please not Vernon. I’ll be good, I promise.” Harry begged
Draco just sat there and rubbed patterns into Harry’s back as he cried, his heart was breaking for the newest Slytherin but he couldn’t help but smile at how perfect Harry fit in his arms. He could get used to cuddling with Harry Potter.
The trio sat amongst other fifth years at the Slytherin table, they had made it across the hall without speaking a word to anyone from any other house. Harry’s stomach was flipping with nerves as he sat, for as much as his body was screaming at him to skip this meal he knew if he didn’t eat Madame Pomfrey or Professor Snape would surely find out. Harry and Draco both made themselves breakfast plates,  Draco jumped right into the conversation Pansy Parkinson was having with Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle but Harry just watched and listened still feeling a bit wary about how the Slytherins were going to treat him.
“No no, we don’t need to bother him, I’m fine.”
“Oh,” Harry was a little confused but mostly relieved that Draco’s best friend saw potential in them
“Well you do have Lily’s eyes, but you also have her intelligence, Mr. Potter - now that I’m your head of house I can see all your marks and you perform exceptionally in Defense, and while I never would have admitted this before you show a lot of promise in my class - it’s almost like you’re intentionally holding yourself back, which we can discuss at a later date if necessary. I would also be happy to tell you more about your mother, however, I’m afraid it will have to wait as I have another class to get back to.”
“Not a problem Draco, I’m glad to see you two getting along. Do make sure you and Mr. Potter find your way back to the dorms this evening. Mr. Potter you and I have a meeting with the Profesor Dumbledore after breakfast tomorrow.” and with that Snape was gone, as usual not bothering to wait for a response.
“He’s not interested.” Malfoy supplied coldly, it sent a shiver down Harry’s spine and the taller boy stood.
“I was just thinking the opposite” Harry added, “I’ve been shocked with how kind he’s been, this is the first time he’s felt like Professor Snape all term”
“Potter, do you want anything else to eat?” Theo commented, looking at Harry’s nearly empty plate. Harry didn’t have time to respond as he heard 2 distinct and recognizable chuckles behind him - the Weasley twins were standing at the Slytherin table.
“Friends,” Harry repeated as he and Draco exchanged a firm hand-shake and some care-free laughs
“Thank you, Professor, I never get a say in things like this.” Harry blushed but at least his anxiety was dissipating.
Harry was just thinking about how the potions master does that, just disappears at the end of conversions not dragging them out to an unnecessary departure when he heard voices.
“How mad is Snape going to be?” Harry asked after a moment of silence,
“Potter, come on - I don’t want to get stuck at a shitty cauldron.” It was Draco’s voice calling him to a table 3 rows from the front. Harry didn’t think twice before joining him and felt genuine excitement at the idea of working on potions with Draco. It was pretty remarkable how the pair of former rivals were quickly sliding into their new roles of housemates and not enemies. Harry even allowed himself to think about the possibility of them becoming actual friends.
Draco casts a cooling charm when Harry was finished adding the hellebore and he bottled what they had made. The team exchanged friendly high-fives before approaching Snape’s desk.
“Not that I have any doubts about what caused this, but I will need you to confirm that this was the work of a blood quill Mr. Potter” Snape spoke after carefully looking it over.
Harry was startled so he gasped and instinctively pulled his robe down to cover his hand, “Oh, um - it’s nothing it was just a long detention.” Harry shuddered out, even less convincing than Pansy.
The curse turned Harry into a screaming and crying mess on the floor.
“Anyone else want a go?”
A thick silence filled the room once Madam Bones put the report papers neatly back down on her desk.
“Niffler weed” Greengrass spoke when they reached the door to the Slytherin common room and the eight students made their way in.
“Go deal with him for changing up his plans last minute. One bloody week, he’s lucky we didn’t have anything on the schedule - he’d be walking into the city.” The boney woman scuffed. Harry’s breath hitched as he heard his uncle grunt and make his way up the steps.
“Harry, do you know why you have been removed from your house?” Dumbledore asked, paying no attention to the state Harry was in
Harry nodded eagerly, feeling too weak to speak again. Draco climbed into bed and sat close to Harry but made sure not to touch him, Harry looked at him like he was subconsciously doing a safety check before he curled into his roommate’s side and softly cried. He was embarrassed but he also couldn’t bring himself to pull away. Harry was always so shaken and cold - despite the excessive sweating - after a nightmare and he felt so safe and warm at that moment that he didn’t want it to end.
“Mr. Potter, I’m going to start by reading the statement I have received from your professors. I’ll just need you to confirm that all the information is accurate. Then I will ask you some questions and get some of our magical examiners to look at the scarring on your hand. Once that’s finished you’ll be excused for the day and will be free to return to school. Is that all clear?”
“You’ll probably need some happier memories, that was my problem - took me weeks to pick one.” Harry said as they all left the room, “Come this way. I know a short-cut” he added and made his way to the passage that he knew led straight to the basement.
“Have there been any problems? You can say so if there have been Harry, I know I’m not your legal guardian but I’m still looking out for you.”
Harry already knew everything that Madam Bones had said, Snape was very thorough in explaining the court procedure before they came, but Harry was happy to have it clarified again, “yes ma’am, thank you, I understand.”
Snape couldn’t read the look on his student’s face, maybe it was grief or longing but it felt deeper than that.
Harry didn’t think he had the strength to turn his head, he was disoriented and his muscles were sore - and yet they still trembled. Harry was happy that at least now he knew where he was, well not exactly but this was clearly Hogwarts. Which meant Uncle Vernon was not around.
“I’m sorry Sir, but I don’t understand what that means.”
“And that was hardly the most interesting thing that happened that match.” Harry joked, and he felt a rush of joy when several of the people around him chuckled and smiled at his statement. He smiled as he turned to his plate, slicing the piece of meat he grabbed into large pieces, Draco eyed him suspiciously as he did so.
The Slytherin Quidditch team try-outs yield far fewer people than Harry remembered coming to Gryffindors over the years and it made some amount of sense, his previous house was full of reckless and highly competitive individuals. Also, there were fewer Slytherins, something Harry really enjoyed the quite common room was a wonder to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco and Pansy found Harry’s reaction to be amazing as they both looked at each other in shock for a few seconds before joining in the laughter.
. I can only assume this applies to your other classes as well, I have told you that things you say to me in confidence will be kept secret but as head of house I can see all of your marks, and if I feel one is needed we will have an academic check-in. Harry,  your aunt and uncle were wrong to do that to you, and you may already know that, but if you don’t I want to make myself clear - it was never your fault that your cousin was not as strong of a student as you. If there is ever anything else that comes up that you’re not sure was healthy or normal, something that happened to you while living with those muggles, you can always come to talk to me and I promise to be honest with you.” Severus was relieved he had been able to make it through all of that with how his emotions were firing. Every conversation he had with Harry made him want to hunt down and kill Petunia Dursley and her family for hurting the boy so much.
“Harry, I’m gonna help you sit here, and then I’ll have to go for just a moment, I’m going to get one of your classmates to sit with you. You’ll be excused from my class today and can make up the potions lab in the future.” Snape lead Harry towards the wall and held one arm steady as the boy slid down into a sitting position.
“Hello, Mr. Potter, it’s a pleasure to meet you.” Amelia Bones spoke with a very kind voice from her seat at the front of the room,
“Harry, when was the last time you had help getting through a nightmare?” Severus thought little of the question as he asked it
“a lot of them are that crazy, yeah.” So they laughed and Harry spent the rest of the period telling crazy stories and getting to know Draco
“Now is not the time for this conversation, Albus. You know that what’s done is done, pressing Mr. Potter for details that will not change anything will not do anyone any good.” Snape was practically spitting as rage boiled inside of him.
“No, you’re right. I need to be prepared, just like I do for Umbridge’s classes.” Harry groaned but gathered his things and got ready to leave the great hall.
“You can cast a Patronus? A full form one?” Blaise asked
“I didn’t mean to upset anyone, I shouldn’t have, I’m sorry.” Harry looked up to his professor as his mumbled words turned into more coherent phrases.
So he wandered until he found himself up the owl tower, chatting with Hedwig and looking over the castle grounds. For the first time, he felt like he didn’t belong. He knew now that he didn’t deserve it, he wasn’t a good enough housemate or a good enough wizard so what was he even doing.
Harry thought for a moment before timidly nodding a no; having someone behind him had been hard enough, having Snape that close to him would certainly send him back over the edge. Snape instantly sat back down, he was there if Harry needed but gave the space he had requested.
like trouble loitering out here. Why haven’t you gone
Sirius jumped straight out of his chair, slamming the book shut and yelling in shock, “Jesus Moons! You scared the shit out of me. You can’t bloody sneak up on me like that.”
That comment got a chuckle out of Harry as well. Draco rolled his eyes very dramatically but eventually joined his friends in joking around.
Harry reached for the cup Snape had pointed out and took a large sip, his throat was dry.
School Year: Five
“Yes sir, I’ll be fine,” Harry muttered through gritted teeth, he bit his lip in an attempt to keep himself from crying out as the pain intensified. Harry could feel the magic being pulled around inside his hand, he hoped that the burning sensation in the top of his hand meant that the magic was getting closer to the surface. After about 3 more minutes of the magic shifting about under the surface of his skin, Harry finally felt the witch remove her hand and place her wand directly onto his hand.
“I did Sir, but only after he had verbally attacked Potter,” Draco spoke with a smug honesty that used to make Harry’s blood boil but now he made him chuckle a little.
Harry nodded in understanding
me. Fred and George ripped metal bars off my window the summer before second year. When Hagrid took me to Diagon Ally I was sleeping on the floor of a boat while my relatives slept in big warms beds. I begged Dumbledore every single year to let me stay, Mcgonnagll too. I practically told Sirius when he offered to take me in but Dumbledore said no and now I hardly even hear from him - he and Remus know how awful my aunt is, and they didn’t even try to check in on me. I was starved, and beaten and locked up and no one has ever cared,” Harry had been yelling but his voice softened as he added one last thought,
“What was it like growing up with Professor Snape as your godfather?” Harry was not only curious about Draco’s relationship with their professor, but he was also curious about what a normal relationship with a godfather should be like. He never knew about family outside of the Dursley’s and Aunt Marge, Harry didn’t even know who Dudley’s grandfather was and he wanted to do things right with Sirius. Maybe Draco would have some insight.
While the Slytherins had wonderfully light schedules on Tuesdays and Thursdays it was made up for the rest of the week, today they had - Defense, History of Magic, Astronomy, and Transfiguration. Fridays were elective days for fifth years, so Harry had Care of Magical Creatures right after breakfast and then Ancient Ruins later in the afternoon with most of the other Slytherins in his year who took the class as well but he would be one of the few Slytherins in Hagrids class accompanied only by Blaise and Greg.
His second letter was to his former professor Remus Lupin, Harry has been learning that Remus and his partner Sirius black were his dad’s best mates in school and if it weren’t for the war Harry would probably be living with them. He asked Lupin about how he was doing and how Sirius was, he explained that he didn’t want to wait until he returned to school to see the pair and if they were free he would love to visit or meet up somewhere. He also told Lupin about Hedwig and how good she was at delivering letters.
“And now the hellebore,” Draco removed the stirring spoon and reached for the vial of hellebore uncapping it. He was about to add the required seven drops when Harry called out, “No, wait!”
“There haven’t been any problems...or at least none caused by Snape. He’s actually been super helpful with solving problems. He’s a great head-of-house, he’s looking out for me.” Harry spoke with earnest and Draco and Remus smiled. Sirius was still skeptical but didn’t voice his opinions.
For the first time in weeks, Harry felt like he might survive. He just hoped this feeling could last.
“Harry, it’s okay; you’re safe,” Draco spoke gently not knowing what else to do. He had noticed the crumpled mess in Harry’s hand, but when he looked closer he could see the grade stick out. “Did you get a perfect mark?” Draco spoke with a bit more excitement. He was hoping it would lighten the mood a little.
Draco’s romantic yearning for Harry just increased how protective he felt over the small boy, Draco was ready to curse and hex anyone who even looked at Harry the wrong way.
“Well we better get off, we need to stop by the dorm and grab our books now if we want to get the best seats in Snape’s class,” Parkinson called, already standing and straightening her robes. The group of fifth years all hastily joined her, making snide marks about the fact that the Gryffindors weren’t going to be punctual enough for it to make a difference.
“Could we go back...to the common room I mean?” Harry’s shy voice asked.
Harry quickly finished his tea, said good-bye to his
Once Poppy had the creme, applying it was quick work, she added a magical bandage and told Harry that after 6 hours he could remove them, and in 10 hours he can wash them off in a warm shower and he would be able to go back to normal.
Remus had stopped by the hospital after the maze as well, he told Harry that he and Sirius would be there for him when they could but reminded him that Sirius was still in hiding and with his lycanthropy, there wasn’t much his godfathers would be able to do. He promised he’d be in touch when the next term had started, but the whole conversation made Harry feel like someone else was abandoning him now.
The next morning Harry had some toast and coffee that Tom had brought for him, the young wizard thanked him and paid for his stay before grabbing his things and taking the floo to platform  9¾.
“Of course, Amelia. I’ll check the detention logs as soon as I return and send you any reports.”
They had made it through the castle and down to the Slytherin entrance without trouble when Draco spoke up,
“Finite Incantatem” He ordered, instantly settling all the magic left hanging in the room. He then accessed the damage, everything looked to be in order after he casts a silent extinguishing charm on Ms. Greengrass’s robes.
“No - no or I guess I don’t think so. It sounded more like he was worried about me because it had happened at all, not because it sorted me into Slytherin. Although I know he’s not been very fond of Slytherins in the past. Maybe I shouldn’t get my hopes up.” So as he spoke Harry started preparing himself for a meeting where his godfather was upset with him.
“I really have been a git to him,” Draco broke the momentary quiet to talk about something that had been weighing on him since dinner, “I just thought that he would have been treated with the honor that everyone in our world casts on him.  I never imagined - how did I miss this, me of all people."
“Well the new defense teacher is Dolores Umbridge she works with Fudge, and the word from inside the ministry is that she wants to change the Hogwarts curriculum - starting with defense. She’s not teaching any practical magic, just theory we won’t be doing any magic in Dense this year except on the OWL. Father was talking about it a few nights before we came back.” Draco answered, Harry was shocked at how much he knew and realized that his new house was much more powerful, if not in strength or numbers than in knowledge, no one in Gryffindor would have had that kind of inside knowledge.
“Layers of bruising and scar tissue - I’d have to see the skin to be sure but it looks like there are some fresh wounds as well that haven’t had time to heal and scar yet. On top of that, he’s got one of the worst cases of malnutrition and dehydration I’ve ever seen. This boy has been starved, Severus.  Take in the obvious sleep deprivation and it’s a miracle he’s still standing.” She paused to read the next set of results and looked even more puzzled
“Very well, Albus can make sure any other students who have had detentions with Professor Umbridge are spoken to and checked for injuries?” Amelia turned away from Harry and looked to Albus as she spoke.
No one said anything, but no one had to Harry just needed to get all of that off his chest and they let him.
Snape was a bit startled but sat back down and gestured for Harry to continue,
“We have potions, Snape said we were late. Draco, we’re late we have to go to class, Snape’ll - come on.” Harry insisted on standing on his own and was heading towards the potions room.
Also, I know I said this wasn't coming until Sunday but I'm going to try and stick to a 3x/week posting schedule so hopefully new chapters every Friday, Sunday, and Wednesday around midnight EST.
The class went smoothly and the Slytherins had 15 minutes before they had to be out at the greenhouses with Professor Sprout. No one wanted to trek down to the dungeons and back, so the small group of them went to the library. It wasn’t like they had enough time to get any work down but Pansy had insisted they make a study plan so no one fell behind with OWLs coming up. So they all sat around a library table and made up schedules for homework for getting homework done all semester. Harry lit up when Draco told everyone to leave room in the study schedule for quidditch practice because he had told everyone that both of them would be unavailable.
“Thank you” Harry eventually spoke in a whispered breath pulling his eyes away from Draco’s. It was quite for a few more moments before Blaise spoke up
“It’s okay Harry you can have any feelings you need to have. I’m not going to leave you alone, I promise. I want to help you but stop me if you need to, alright.” Harry could only manage a nod, but that was enough for Draco.
He jumped back stumbling into Draco who swiftly caught him as his old professor rounded the corner with his wand drawn,
“Bloody hell” he murmured as his leg shook with anxiety, this all pulled Draco’s attention away from the conversation he was having with Pansy about ministry politics.
Harry checked the small watch he had brought with him, the Dursleys would be waking up in about two hours, and seeing as he still didn’t have a plan for getting back to his room without being caught by his uncle or being expelled for using underaged magic he decided it was time to head back. He cleaned up his things and put them back in his bag neatly, he slid the cloak over himself and started the trek back to Privet Drive.
“No, I - I… “ he tried to speak his mind but the panic was rising too quickly
“I… I don’t, um…” Harry looked desperately to his professor
The witch called out the incantation and Harry was filled with one last shock of pain, as  Rue Raywood pulled her wand away.
Severus continued, “I am hopeful that my testimony and your hand as evidence will be enough. However, you may be called to give a statement. If that happens you just answer their questions as best you can. As I’ll be standing in as your magical guardian I will make sure that any questions they are asking are relevant to the matter at hand. I want this to go as smoothly as possible, so I’ll keep it from getting derailed. I promise.”
“I think Mr. Malfoy has covered much of what I had to say, I am going to add a few more important details. You will never be punished for good work here, but that doesn’t mean you always have to be the best. That is something many students here struggle with and while you may experience those feelings sometimes it is important to know that you are the only person trying to hold yourself to that standard, we all know that perfection can’t always be possible. That said, now that I know the work you are capable of I
So he changed, double-checked his truck, and drank half a vail of dreamless sleep before opening the window for Hedwig and crawling into bed.
“Yeah, of course.” Draco slowly added the ingredient and both boys watched the potion change colors once again, Draco thought this must be one of the prettiest things he’s ever made in Snape’s classroom.
“I miss James, he’d know what to do. Not that any of this would be happing if either of them were alive...but if it were, James would know what to do. I miss him so much Moons.” Sirius cried into Remus’ chest
Of course, he would also need to stop at Gringotts but he shouldn’t have a problem doing all that in one day. He just had to tell his uncle that he was leaving a day early this year so he’d need to be dropped off on the last of August and not the first of September. They’d probably be thrilled to have him out of the house a day sooner.
“Yeah” Harry spoke up, looking into Draco’s vast grey eyes “I would like that, to talk and calm down and get to know you.” The boys smiled at each other and walked side by side back to the Slytherin dorms to enjoy their free period.
Harry landed, in a less than graceful way and gleefully handed all five golf balls over to Montague who smiled slightly as Draco called out,
"You reckon Snape must know about the Muggles right, I mean they spent a long time in the hospital wing together and they had a private meeting after. Plus he's got to be getting those potions from someone."
“How about we let that be a surprise,” Sirius honestly winked as he ran up the stairs leaving Remus behind to follow. Remus happily sighed at how much this Sirius resembled the kid he knew in school - he saw so little of the man he first fell in love with these days. He slowly made his way up the stairs, giving Sirius a few minutes of anticipation. Remus knew when he opened the bedroom door his partner would be fully undressed.
Pansy had expected this conversation,
“Yes sir,” Harry spoke honestly, his friends had told him Snape wouldn’t be too mad...wait did he just call them his friends? were they his friends Harry didn’t have time to think about it as Professor Snape was speaking again
“You let us know if anyone gives you any trouble Potter.”  followed instantly by, “Especially those Gryffindor scum.” Crabbe and Goyle spoke together, finishing each other’s sentences
"I'm good at noticing lots of things, plus I’m you’re best friend. I know
“Remus,” Harry smiled brightly and excepted the man’s offer for a hug.
Draco just nodded and smiled, a smile made Harry’s insides flip, a smile that Harry was slowly falling for. So he scurried off to his new room and grabbed the 4 remaining vials of dreamless sleep from his trunk, Harry took a deep breath and made his way back to the common room to find Snape.
Harry didn’t bother trying to check the time, he felt too weak to lift the broken floorboard that hid his things to check the tiny wristwatch. He wasn’t planning on going back to sleep, he knew that his uncle’s threat was real, and seeing as he couldn’t stop the dreams Harry would have to stay awake if he wanted to avoid getting sent back to his dreaded cupboard. He doubted if he could even fit in it now, it had been nearly 4 years since he had to sleep under the stairs, but honestly, the boy hadn’t grown too much sure he had gained some height but he was still shockingly underweight. He always came back to school smaller than he had left, his friends noticed at the start of the second year and since then they always make sure Harry eats enough during the first few weeks so his stomach can start working properly again.
They both laughed, but with one harsh look from the man in question they were stifled and the pair looked to the potions recipe in front of them.
“Snape told him about it the night that it happened, and he saw it the next day. It hasn’t been much more than a week.” Harry thought that would lighten the mood but it didn’t.
Godric Gryffindor had a similar plan, Godric wanted to ensure that any student fighting with pure and loyal intentions inside the castle walls would be granted an extra shield of his protection. The magic was triggered when someone doing a strong act of good was in danger. Much like how his sword would find its way to any worthy Gryffindor his shield magic could assist any student in Hogwarts with pure, good-willed, and loyal intentions.
Severus had heard of this, it was old magic, some thought it was only a rumor but you really couldn’t deny its legitimacy when he had just received a letter from a building. He briefly wondered if his job would ever run out of surprises when he heard a slight crack and watched as a small red envelope appeared above his desk and slowly floated down. It had the same crest pressed into it as the memo did so he thought this must be the information on his newest Slytherin.
The ride felt longer than ever when you had to ride by yourself, Harry passed on the trolly even though he had been longing for it weeks earlier it wasn’t fun when he couldn’t share with his mates. He changed into his robes and grabbed his new potions book, he needed something steady. He needed classes to start and work to do and quidditch season to begin.
“You mean we aren’t doing any actual magic this year.” Draco let out an audible sigh as Herminones high pitched shrill voice echoed through the defense classroom.
“So we need to lay low, I can’t bloody kill him because then we don’t get any answers?”
“Yes, a few people have been a little put out by them but it wasn’t ever a big deal.” That was also partially true sometimes it was a big deal at the moment - especially with his old dormmates - but it all passed so quickly that Harry wasn’t too bothered.
“They’d be proud of you Harry,” Remus added causing a smile to fill Harry’s face before a nasty thought overtook it.
“No, underaged wizards from non-wizarding families are permitted to bring either 1 muggle guardian or 1 magical surrogate from an approved list. All Hogwarts professors and all ministry officials are on the list, so someone from the school will accompany you. Likely myself unless you have any objections to that?” Snape spoke and Harry felt a little calmer, his professor had proved that he would look out for Harry which felt amazing to the boy who had been treated so poorly for so long.
“Professor, did you know I was going to freak out? Is that why you had the potion with you?” Harry asked as soon as the door was firmly closed behind Madam Bones. Snape nearly chuckled at the question,
“Yeah, um….thank you guys. I’m sorry for being so much trouble.” Harry was still trembling consistently and his mind was still incredibly foggy, but at least speech was coming easier to him.
“Harry I won’t go anywhere unless you want me to, I promise - I just thought I had made things worse, but I swear mate, I will stay for as long as you need me.” Draco had collected Harry into his lap again but now Harry was looking up into Dracos face as the blonde spoke.
“I see, well in that case I need to start with writing to our school board for approval to remove her from our staff and our campus. Then I can file an official report with the court, I will need Harry to sign the documents. If they take the matter to court he will need to attend accompanied by a guardian, as you have made clear today Mr. Potter is still an underaged wizard.” The tone in Dumbledore’s voice put both Slytherins a little on edge. Harry was feeling particularly uncomfortable, it felt as if something was shifting around under his skin and he couldn’t get his leg to stop bouncing.
“Mr. Potter, I wanted to personally congratulate you on your exam score. Your first perfect mark in my class, well done. I know there have been some harsh reactions to your re-sorting but from where I stand things seem to be going very well.” The small professor spoke with obvious pride in his voice, and Hermionie felt a pang of jealousy.
I hope yall didn't get used to me being early twice in a row because being late is my specialty and I'm so sorry about that, but honestly, this chapter is late because I was watching the Hunger Games with my sister and pretending its 2013 again to feel something. I also listened to Halsey's Badlands album twice today, so that's where I'm at. I'm so glad you liked the last chapter you're comments are literally making me so happy and inspired to keep going.
“I would rather not take this to the headmaster given his response to recent events, Mr. Potter, but I’m not sure if we have another choice.” The students could see Snape thinking trying to work out the problem.
Severus felt his eyes roll to the back of his head, what in merlins beard was Albus playing at. Of course, they would be taking legal action, he was not going to stand back and let anyone else lay a hand on Lily’s son - not again.
“Bloody daft, the lot of you,” Draco started, “Harry, you’ve gone face-to-face with the Dark Lord twice -”
Snape somehow was easing Harry’s fears before he spoke them. Not for the first time, Harry found himself wondering why he had to spend so much time suffering when the people here cared for him so much.
“How many of our secrets have you just given away, Potter! You were family and we trusted you. I bet you’ve blabbed to the whole evil lot of them!” Ron paused methodically
Everything went perfectly after that, he made it to his room without detection and sent the broom back to where he had found it. Harry even managed to doze off for a little while before Petunia unlocked the door and ordered him down to make breakfast that morning.
“Mr. Malfoy, a word,” Snape called loudly, causing a silence to fall over the room before stepping back into the privacy of the hall. Draco stood instantly; he was now anxious because he hadn’t seen Harry yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry took a deep breath before answering, “I suppose I’m just used to making sure I don’t draw too much attention to myself, so I just worked on Ron’s level before but I’ve always been able to make potions like this. I like making potions it’s a science and if you know how to do them well then you can just mess it up a little in the right way to make it okay even if it’s not great, I’ve read a bunch of potions books in my free time.”
“I know, Mrs. Parkinson told me. Do you know what happened?” Snape kept a calm head and his voice matched Draco’s as he slowly approached his shaking student.
Crabbe and Goyle were the only beaters that showed, assuring they would keep their spots, Harry was surprised to be the only seeker but no one else seemed to share that opinion, Miles Bletchley was also the only person interested in being keeper Harry didn’t know him well but he recognized him from Quidditch. 6 people showed up for the chaser positions including, the new captain, Graham Montague, Draco, and Blaise, and a group of 3rd-year girls who appeared to be more interested in spending the time gossiping than playing.
Sirius pulled the man in and kissed him deeply, he wasn’t sure what he would do without Remus.
“Not likely,” Theo retorted
“Come on, I bet you worked extra hard to make it look like you didn’t care.” He joined along in the joking
. Harry wanted to point out that a lot of them would likely already be enemies if they support Voldemort, but he kept it to himself.
“Mr. Potter, a pleasure to meet ya! M’names Rubble, John Rubble. Magical photographer - I’m gonna take a few shots of that other hand fa ya!” one of the young wizards enthusiastically shook Harry’s right hand as he introduced himself. Snape and Harry both tensed a little at the interaction, but one swift glare from the Potions Master and John Rubble hastily backed off to take the pictures.
“No one has ever done this for me before, sat with me like this - after a nightmare I mean...not that I can remember at least. The only reason I haven’t been more freaked out is that Snape brought it up in our meeting today, otherwise I probably wouldn’t even understand what you were trying to do.” as Harry spoke horror-struck Dracos face and Harry feared it was directed at him. He wanted to cry
“Do you want us to wait?” Theo questioned as Harry paused
about you.” Pansy winked, and if Draco wasn’t so pressed to hear what she had to say he would have cursed her slimy arse.
Harry was in the middle of wondering how big Snape’s pockets were when Rue spoke up again,
“It’s our house Harry, and you’re one of us.” Draco smiled widely and gently grabbed Harry’s shoulder, if he noticed the way the smaller boy tensed up Draco didn’t say anything. They all just continued to get to know each other and eat until the class schedules arrived.
“I’m glad you’re alright, but seriously what happened?” She asked again
Harry was startled by hearing his name and it took him several seconds to process what he had been asked before he could speak out, “It is all obviously a little strange, but honestly it feels good to be here or maybe not
Before Harry could process those words, while still convulsing in pain from the last curse he heard the bone-chilling whistle of a slim wooden cane and then felt the stinging pain the punishing device left on his bareback.
“Harry, some ancient Hogwarts magic was activated tonight, there is a lot to explain, but the bottom line is that the school - and I do mean the school as in the castle, not anyone who lives or works here-  decided it was in your best interest for you to be removed from Gryffindor and placed here.” Snape stopped himself from lecturing which was a habit of his
“I think you had a panic attack Harry, or at least that’s what it sounds like to me. I’m not going to tell you to get over it because you don’t need to, you’ve lived through something traumatizing Harry and no one has ever helped you the way you need so you are allowed to feel everything you want to. Thank you for telling me that, it was really strong of you to do it and I’m honored that you trusted me. Do you want me to come and  hold you?” Draco felt a little embarrassed to ask, still not used to Harry liking him.
“What do you want to know about me?” Draco asked Harry once they were settled in,
“If you don’t have any questions you may return to your dorm, I do not know when Mr. Potter will be arriving but it will be tonight so be prepared for his arrival at some point this evening.” the boys looked between each other for a short moment before standing and leaving as if they had just had any other meeting.
“It’s alright mine work fine, they’re just old besides your shrinking charm worked great. You’ve gotta teach me how to do it.” Harry smiled and dismissed Draco’s concerns. Draco was not about to let the issue go entirely, but he moved on for now.
“I won’t let anything happen to Harry,” Draco’s voice was filled with certainty and he formally shook Sirius’ hand.
friends, and followed Professor Snape to the Headmaster’s office.
Harry started reading, he had gotten 7 chapters in when he noticed the sun was coming through the window and he heard his cousin go thumping down the stairs. He hoped his aunt or uncle would come to unlock his door and let him out, maybe he could get something to eat, he couldn’t remember when he had last eaten. He knew it was a long shot, but maybe he could even convince his aunt to let him go work on the garden, Harry longed to go outside.
Draco quickly followed and got in front of him, “No Harry, I just talked to Snape you and I are going to brew our potion for him some other time. He excused us from class. He wanted me to make sure you were okay.”
“That is odd, why would she think you would need her help again? Not like you’re going to encounter another Black Quill.” Pansy wondered aloud.
Really the posting schedule should be Saturday, Monday, Thursday because they're never up before midnight. For people waiting for Drarry, it's coming soon I promise the next few chapters have been some of my favorites.
“Mr. Potter, I assume you brought what I asked you to?” the professor spoke
“I’m sorry Sir, I didn’t have a chance to ask this morning. I just wanted to know, if - if you could keep what I said in the hospital wing today a secret. I understand if you can’t, it’s just - everyone already knows so much about me, and I don’t even really know how to deal with all of it yet. I’m sorry, I know it’s a lot to ask...I just, I want to keep this private.” Harry was shaking with anxiety and Snape just stared in shock, how much had this boy had his trust violated and manipulated to think that asking for his private history to be kept private was a lot to ask.
1. is a short chapter but I pinkie promise chapter 7 will make up for it, I'm sorry I tried to split it up so they were more even but it didn't work as well. So short chapter today and a long chapter on Sunday (or probably Monday morning).
“Thank you,” He responded reciprocating the gentle hand squeeze Draco had given him earlier.
“No, your truck is full and in my office along with your broom. I will have a house-elf move your truck while I show you to your room. I’ll send your broom down to the Slytherin quidditch locker. Come now Mr. Potter before you fall asleep on that sofa.” Snape stood with his words and motioned for Harry to follow.
“Maybe James is rolling over in his grave at the thought of Harry in Green, but he’s not here-” Sirius felt his voice crack and his breath hitch but he pushed through, “I need to do whatever is best for Harry. Not what James would have wanted.”
Draco stood tall and extended his hand, “Draco,” he hesitated, “Draco Malfoy.” Draco normally said his name with pride and confidence, but he knew from stories his mother had told that Sirius Balck wasn’t a big fan of the Malfoys. Or any of the old pure-blood families for that matter.
I'm sorry if this chapter is a little jumpy but it has lots of content, also I think the chapters are going to be about this long now
“Alright Harry, you can get along now. That’s all I needed.” The professor smiled widely as he set down the book, Harry smiled back, but his was much more forced.
“Bloody course it’s alright.” Draco stood and came closer to Harry, he sat down right next to him on the couch. Harry turned so his back was in the corner of the couch he pulled his right leg up onto the couch and folded it so his thigh touched his chest. His left arm stretched across his other leg so that his hand could rest on Dracos thigh and their feet were touching through the toes of their shoes on the ground.
“Yeah, Lupin taught me in third year after I fell off my broom at the Hufflepuff match. It took me weeks to get a corporal one, but I don’t have much trouble doing it now.” Harry said casually
“Not that I know of, but no one else in my house has been given any detentions with Professor Umbridge.”
“That’s Blaise Zabini next to the door and then right next to him is Theodore Nott - but we all call him Theo. When we’re here in Slytherin we all use first names, but we like to keep up formalities in the rest of the castle so we go by our sir names when we’re about. You’ll get it soon enough, we’re the smallest house so there aren’t as many people to keep track of. I sleep across from Blaise, so the bed on the other side of the fire pit is open. The fire doesn’t have a floo connection but if you need it lit just call a house-elf and they’ll take care of it, it gets rather cold in here before the sun hits the lake.”
“Who last talked with you about your nightmares, maybe sat or stayed with you until you fell back asleep, got you some tea, anything to help calm you down and assure you of your safety and bring you back to reality?” giving examples would surely get Snape the answer he wanted.
“Nooo!” Harry let out his most painful scream yet, he felt tears running down his face and unexplainable stabbing pain in his stomach.
“Harry!” Sirius called excitedly making his way across the room the moment he had transformed back from Padfoot. He scooped his godson into his arms and held him tightly. Harry flinched at first but quickly relaxed.
As always thank y'all so much for reading and leaving comments and kudos it means the world to me. I hope everyone had a happy new year. I made a 2021 bingo card and added a "JKR lawsuit" and a "BBC Johnlock confirmed" square so that's how my day went.
“I did, we grew up together in a muggle neighborhood. I was so excited when she got a Hogwarts letter, I assumed your Godfather would have told you that I was in his year while we were all at school.”
“What about him?” Harry asked,
Something was certainly wrong though, it was like Harry could feel the magic in the room, it felt like if he wanted he would be able to reach out and touch it. He didn’t have much time to ponder it all though because he felt himself lurch forward out of his bed - it felt a little like traveling by floo but sudden, without any warning, and much faster.
“So, how much do you and Pansy know about the Dursley’s,”
“I’m sorry-”
The three stayed together in the common room joking around until a bell chime told them it was time to get to class. The rest of the day was surprisingly just as good, classes went well and the great hall was feeling less and less like a war zone with every meal.
"damn Harry why haven't you used your powers of sass for good in the past," Draco asked
“Merlin,” The professor sighed trying not to curse “It appears Mr. Potter has been taking Dreamless Sleep which would not be a problem in moderation or if it were brewed properly. The valerian levels shouldn’t be this high he needs to stop taking this before it causes any damage. I’ll look into what he has, find out what went wrong, my guess,  whoever he bought it from has altered the ingredients.” This time the professor did let out a small curse, how people were so careless was beyond him and why on earth had Harry taken a potion that hadn’t been checked - surely the professor taught his students better than that.
Harry took a stabilizing breath and told the briefest version of the story he could come up with, “I got detention during her first class, she told me I’d be writing lines; which I did, but it wasn’t a normal quill...she gave me this.” Harry held out the still-sacred left hand for the others to see, “It doesn’t hurt much anymore, and Professor Snape said he can take away the scaring after the trial”
“This wasn’t a match...and no.” Harry joked back and both boys smiled at each other.
Harry swiftly made his way from the office to find Draco and ask him for help picking out the nice robes
“We’re happy to have you, Potter, let’s just hope we can rub that Gryffindor hot-headedness out of you before you destroy the whole school.” Harry chuckled at Malfoy’s words, a month ago he would have found them to be aggressive but now he knew it was a term of endearment in some Malfoy sort of way.
Clutching his cheek Ron drew his wand. “Oh, you’ll regret that. You’ll both regret that.” Ron grinned devilishly and he, Hermione, Neville, and a hand full of other Gryffindors all sent hexes towards the Slytherins at the same time.
“There is one more thing I would like to discuss before you two make your leave,” Dumbledore called “you know there has not been a student re-sorted in this castle in all my years here, as a student or as a professor. It is a very old magic that we all wish to understand more.”
Slowly he pried the window open, got onto the edge, and jumped, aiming for the hedge under his window. When Harry climbed out of the bush and stood he found that he was very dizzy, he gathered himself as smoothly as possible and he was struck with a horrifying thought - he hadn’t figured out a way to get back into his room. Harry cursed himself, how had he forgotten to plan a way back.
but he knew they had left money behind.
“It was accidentally magic, we were all at the dinner table and she was talking about how rotten I was -  which I didn’t mind that’s what she always does - but then she kept saying it was my parent’s fault. She called them awful names and the Dursleys told her they died in a car crash so she called them drunks and lazy and I couldn’t stop myself. She inflated and just floated away, Uncle Vernon chased her for a little while but I grabbed all my things and ran away. The Night Bus picked me up and brought me to the Leaky Cauldron.” Harry fished the story with a smile, he was petrified at the time it happened but now he could look back and chuckle.
The final founder Salzar Slytherin used the most advanced magic to create a system that could detect when a student had been abandoned or betrayed. With some reluctant help from Godric Gryffindor, he was able to make a magical connection between his piece of the core and the sorting hat; if this magic was ever called on a student would be placed somewhere they wouldn’t have to experience that loss again. Slytherin wanted to assure his magic was only called on when it was absolutely necessary, he knew it was powerful and didn’t want the power to be abused. Salazar made it so the core would only be activated when the betrayed student accepted themself that they had been abandoned
“Mr. Potter, welcome to Slytherin,” Snape quickly got the students attention and jumped straight to the point,  “this will be your new home. We have lots to discuss, would you be more comfortable here or in my private office. The students have all been told to stay in their doms so either way we will not be bothered. I simply want to make this as easy as possible for you Mr. Potter.” Snape spoke in a voice softer than Harry had ever heard before.
Sirius Balck was sitting alone in the kitchen of number 12 Grimmauld Place; he had been lost in thought for so long his morning coffee had gone cold. He kept drinking it. Sirius hated being back at his childhood home and did his best to avoid as much of it as possible - he and Remus slept in an old guest room, the only other rooms he entered were: the bathroom, kitchen, and study.
Snape obviously already knew this but took the offering none-the-less, he looked over it and smiled, “Very well Mr. Potter, your new study habits are paying off. Congratulations. Now, if you have a minute I have something we need to discuss briefly.”
The day flew by and Harry felt weighed down by all his assigned work at the end of it. As Harry entered his common room he remembered that his first Quidditch practice of the year was tonight so all of that work would have to wait until late tonight.
“No Harry, they got them. Ginny and Ron, well the whole Weasley family, they’re mourning Harry. Percy is dead, and for them, you’re a big reminder of that. I mean we all know about Ginny’s howler and I think you have to know that she’s not the only person who feels that way.” Neville sounded almost sad but somehow cold at the same time.
“Oh, I didn’t know you guys felt that way already,” Harry said
“Harry we would never ask us to share more than you’re comfortable with us, but just so you know Draco and me, we stick together because we both know what it’s like to be scared of home, we know how hard it is to be a person in a world where you can’t trust others because you’ve always been shown otherwise. If the muggles you live with are half as bad as I reckon they are, I just wanted you to know that we get it and if you ever need someone to talk to you can come to us.”
“These are the students you asked to speak with Professor.” Snape nodded and Rackharrow exited, closing the office door behind him.
liked this.”
This was going to be much more challenging than Severus was expected, what in Merlin’s name happened to Potter, and why on earth did that bloody hat think he belonged in Slytherin. Snape only allowed himself a moment with his hard thoughts, for as difficult as it was he understood that Potter was one of his snakes now and he would be treated as such. It was his job to make sure the rest of the house was just as clear on that as he was...
Harry set off for the gas station as he racked his brain thinking up a plan. There was no point going back now,  even if he couldn’t get back in he was out so he might as well make the most of it. Harry stayed under his cloak as he walked throughout Little Whining, he wasn’t looking for any trouble muggle or magical. It took about 10 minutes for Harry to find an open shop, he took off the cloak and put it in his bag before entering the store.
The great hall was packed as usual but Harry managed to quickly find his new designated spot at the Slytherin table when he walked in.
2. There is a spoiler for the aforementioned chapter 7 in the endnotes, so if you don't want to see that skip over that.
“Of course, keep it as long as you need. Just call a house-elf to return it to my room when you’re ready. I’m sure one of you three can cast a lightweight charm to transport it back to the common room?” Snape asked
“Harry, you’re safe at Hogwarts. No one will hurt you here.” Snape spoke softly as he tried to figure out his next step. He didn’t want to touch Harry unless it was necessary. There was a possibility it would work and pull Harry out of his trance however, it was far more likely that he would just become more upset.
Harry glanced nervously around the room, he didn’t want to get in trouble again. He had avoided the second detention with Snape (all of his housemates had told him that in Slytherin if you get detention with any of the professors you have to serve a second one with Snape. It was a way of keeping the house in line and upholding the house’s noble reputation). Now he was about to tell his head of house and the headmaster what he had done in the first place.
Current House: Gryffindor
When they woke the next morning Blaise and Theo were already gone, and although Draco had the mind to close Harry’s curtains he had left his own open so when he entered the common room later they would put it together if they hadn’t already. Draco assured Harry they wouldn’t say anything,
Dumbledore informed me that the magic from the school and the sorting hat wants to move Mr. Potter into your house and that you have already received this information. I’m sure there has been a mistake Harry has always been so happy here. I will let you know when I’ve got it all sorted out and we can reverse it all and set things back on the right track. If you know anything helpful please stop by the Headmaster’s office, we’re hard at work.
If you have not already received a memo you will be receiving one shortly. Please pay no mind to it, I believe it to be the result of a mix-up or perhaps even a prank that went wrong. I will be in touch, but no need to worry.
Harry started fidgeting with the hem on the sleeves of his robes when Draco’s posh voice filled his head,
The group settled into the lecture hall a few seconds before Professor Binns began an extremely boring lesson on the Medieval Assembly of European Wizards. Harry spent the time thinking about Quidditch, and his detention with Umbridge. He noticed about halfway through that Draco was sketching in what appeared to be an enchanted sketchbook with something that drastically resembled a muggle pencil but seemed to work with the same magic as the book. Harry was curious as to what the image was but didn’t want to get caught staring so he went back to making a mental list of the worst possible scenarios for tonight’s detention until the bell to signal the class change chimed.
Harry felt his gut sink like a stone, he knew with all these tests she must know something is wrong with him, which meant he would have to have a very uncomfortable conversation soon.
The thought of his friends made him yearn, he hadn’t heard from them all summer. He had hoped that by refusing to take Hedwig to the Durselys with him the clever bird would have brought him his mail once his relatives were sleeping. She tried, Hedwig visited all the time she would bring Harry parchment and a muggle pen when she could so Harry could scribble a note while the Dursely’s slept - the odd thing was he never received anything back. His letters to Hermionie, Remus, and Sirius had all gone unanswered even when he was sure Hedwig had delivered them.
Harry nodded and swiftly swallowed the potion and passed the empty vial back to his professor, “Thank you, Sir” his voice was soft and mumbled but Harry could already feel the cold liquid coursing through his bloodstream and settling him down.
Sirius spent the whole day alone in the study, he found himself very interested in the ‘Magical Core’ that the founding four placed in the castle before passing. He had learned some fascinating things about the power this core had.
“Oh Harry,” He called slipping his wand away, “It’s so great to see you.”
“Harry, go wait in the hall, you don’t need to be in here anymore,” Snape spoke softly but it did little to settles Harry’s nerves. He began to stand when Dumbledore booming voice filled the office,
The three boys had changed into practice robes, Blaise was trying out a new charm that would lase up his shoes while Draco fixed his hair and Harry grabbed a vial of Snape’s nutrient potion and uncorked it.
Draco held him as he had earlier that night, he was panicky he felt he had done a million things wrong and he had convinced himself that in the morning Harry would be back to hating him. That thought completely petrified Draco, making a mistake was one thing but losing Harry. For once in Draco’s life, he felt like he belonged, and he knew it was because of Harry - he couldn’t lose him before he even had a chance to know him at all.
I hope everyone is surviving the holiday season, please keep commenting and leaving kudos it literally makes me so happy to see them.
“I would like to congratulate you two on this hard work once again, and if all is well here I need to get back to grading.” Snape waited for responses and was met with two nods and mumbled thank you’s as his students made a quick retreat from the classroom.
“Aw, little bitty Harry doesn’t eat much.”
Harry purchased a water bottle, a chocolate bar, and a pre-made sandwich for 9$ he missed wizarding treats, he would much rather be drinking pumpkin juice and eating a treacle tart off the trolly on the Hogwarts Express.
“Yes Sir, Dinky will be especially quiet for Harry Potter, Sir. Harry Potter is a friend of the house-elves Sir.” Dinky had lowed her voice so it matched Snape’s volume and she quickly rushed from the room and vanished halfway down the hall.
Severus snatched all of the vials out of Harry’s reach, with a quick look the Potions Master could tell the draught was a little out of balance without any testing Snapes guessed the potion brewed for a few days less than needed.
“They always just wanted to protect you, to keep you happy and safe. That’s what we want too.” Remus added kindly “Are you, Harry. Do you feel happy and safe?” he asked,
Harry was only silent for a moment before he always put on his sarcastic mask and shot back, “No Professor, you’re right, I should have been worried about magical side effects and I should just
“Harry, please sit.” Snape took a deep breath and Harry could almost feel the remorse and desperation in his professors’ voice, something jarringly out of character.
“You’re right, we probably should get some sleep before the morning.” Harry wanted to stop himself but couldn’t, “but I won’t get scared off Draco, I’m brave. Did you forget I was a lion for many years, they beat bravery into you up there.” He thought he was joking, but Draco didn’t find it very funny.
Dean and Seamus were sitting together on Dean’s bed chatting about their summers and holding hands, they looked up when Harry walked in but that was the most acknowledgment he had gotten. His trunk was at the foot of his bed like it always was, he grabbed some of his things, changed into pajamas, and climbed into bed.
“I - I hate that he’s in Slytherin, I hate that he’s under Snivellus care, and I hate that I know James would feel the same...but I think he needs to stay there Remus. I think whatever happened put Harry in danger, and if it didn’t it left him hurt. So if he’s safe and happy now - I can’t take that away from him and I won’t ruin our relationship by trying.” Sirius stopped talking and looked into Remus’s eyes waiting for the other man to respond.
“I still cannot believe you did that. Who doesn’t want to be top of class?” Pansy finally closed her book, she was genuinely confused and she had been since Harry and Draco told her about the make-up potions lesson; in dark contrast to Harry’s experience, Pansy’s father grew angry anytime his child performed less than perfect.
Hogwarts Magic
"I see, and that leads me to my next question. Mr. Potter this is far better than anything you've ever brewed for me,  and I know that a competent potions partner can make a world of difference in the brewing results. This, however, is not the work I've seen in you over the years even when you’ve worked alone I’ve never seen talent like this from you. Care to explain to me how that is?” Severus didn’t want to seem too demanding but he wasn’t going to leave room for Harry to avoid answering the question.
“No that’s alright, you add them. Do it now though, it just turned blue and if you wait too long it will be hard to gauge when we’ve got the right shade of purple and we might add too much.” Harry remembered how important it was not to add more moonstone than necessary, the book he read this summer said that if the ingredient proportions were off the drinker could end up in a permanent sleep.
Ch. 10 “Don’t Make Padfoot Angry”
, probably even longer.” Harry glanced over at Draco who gave a reassuring smile,
“That sounds amazing, it feels like its been ages since I was on a broom.” He exclaimed
Before anyone else could speak Harry took a breath and stood up.
I went back to work this week and I'm starting a second job soon, basically, my schedule is really cramped and I'm gonna try and keep to this posting schedule but it might drop to 2 updates a week sometimes. I'm sorry
With 3 minutes left until class was set to start and Professor Snape would arrive Ron Weasley approached the table Harry and Draco were sitting at, flanked by Granger and Longbottom.
“Why would he Re? What part of his bloody plan requires Harry to be so vulnerable? He should get to just be a kid for once.” Sirius couldn’t hold himself back anymore and he practically fell into Remus’s chest. It was killing him that he hadn’t been there for Harry all those years.
“I’m sorry Harry, I didn’t mean to-” Draco felt awful that he had made Harry feel so bad twice
“Close the door and have a seat, we’ve something urgent to discuss,” Snape spoke with an elegance that demanded respect and attention.
‘Ow’ he thought as he felt the skin on the back of his hand being split open, he frantically pulled up his sleeve and was nearly sick when he saw that the words he had written were being carved into his skin. Without thought, he looked to his professor who was smiling and making her stupid little ‘tsk tsk’ noise.
“I - I’m okay, a little shaken up but Snape got us out of there before things got too bad,” Harry responded dully
He only made it about halfway when he heard his aunt shouting at her husband, Harry was only catching angered grunts of protest in response. He hurried back over to his bed and sat down with his back to the wall, how had he woken them up? He hadn’t woken up screaming or yelling?
Sirius sat down at the kitchen table and opened the letter; he wished Remus were there with him as he began to read. Something was wrong with Harry and wasn’t that though enough to send Sirius into a full panic before he had even finished reading. Dumbledore wouldn’t be writing to him if there wasn’t a
When they heard a door squeak open the older wizards were immediately on high alert.
to handle this on their own, Draco knew when to ask for help.
As promised, Draco and Pansy were standing in the corridor when Harry emerged from the classroom. They were a little worried after they had just seen Granger storm out, and Harry’s frazzled state didn’t help matters.
“All the more reason to get out with it,” Draco called making his way out of Slytherin’s house dorms.
The students all gave affirmative responses as Severus made his typical dramatic exit.
Pansy continued giggling from the other side of the room as Harry graciously thanked Draco,
“Do you want my help, Harry?” Draco stepped forward shyly - the last thing he did to try and help had made things worse.
Pansy instantly fled the room at a run, she knew that if it was bad enough for Draco to ask for help she shouldn’t waste any time.
It was much easier to live at Grimmauld Place when Remus was around, but his boyfriend had been gone for the last 3 days, luckily he was scheduled to return this evening.
The murtlap worked amazingly, within seconds Harry felt the cooling sensation of the plant and after 5 minutes the pain was nearly gone. Harry and Draco were alone in the potions classroom now, Pansy had excused herself claiming she had to use the bathroom, Draco had a feeling she wanted the pair to have some alone time. Not that Draco would ever admit this, but he was grateful he wanted to spend alone time with Harry.
So Harry told Draco about the meeting, told him about how Dumbledore wanted Snape to leave so he was already anxious before they even sat down. Harry told him about how Dumbledore tried to convince Harry not to take any action against Umbridge and told him about getting pressed for answers about how he ended up in Slytherin.
“No, you don’t have anything to be sorry for Harry. I’m truly sorry, not only because of the nasty words I spilled but because I have greatly misjudged you for many years. I know I have caused you pain, Potter but I will do everything I can to show you that I am honestly sorry.” Draco looked into harry’s eyes as he spoke, Harry was frozen why was it so hard to look away it was like he got lost in Draco Malfoy’s words and his silvery eyes.
He gave Hedwig a large slice of deli meat from his sandwich and gave her instructions to deliver each of the letters as quickly as possible. She hooted and happily flew off with a job to do, Harry loved how free she looked for as much as he missed seeing her every day he knew this was much better than having her locked up with the Dursleys.
Harry learned that Draco and Pansy’s parents knew each other well so they had been friends since before school. Vincent and Greg lived in the same village and spent loads of time together, when they were young people often mistook them for brothers. Harry also noticed that Blaise and Theo tended to keep to themselves most of the time, so he still knew little about them.
The great hall was packed with more students than usual today because everyone was waiting for their schedules, as soon as the three Slytherins entered the room the chatter came to a stop and they could feel hundreds of eyes on them as they walked over the Slytherin table. All three boys kept their heads up and stood impossibly close to each other as the students around them muttered and gaped. Draco couldn’t help but chuckle as he saw the looks of jealousy on the faces of the younger Gryffindors.
The envelope contained a small slip of parchment, Severus had to read it over 3 times before he remembered this whole ordeal wasn’t a joke.
Draco had spoken with his mates before Harry arrived and he agreed to take care of introductions, but Blaise and Theo were awake as well. Harry felt bad that they had stayed up because of him, but his heart fluttered a little knowing that they had, maybe things could be different here.
“Yes Sir” Harry replied sheepishly
He decided it wasn’t worth the risk of getting caught to pick the lock on his door like Fred and George had taught him, instead he headed to his hiding place, he hoped he had something to eat under the floor.
Wizard Court and oooh whats that is that a DA????
“Severus, I didn’t know you would be joining us today,” Dumbledore spoke as Harry and Snape entered his office
The pair continued to work together, they were terrific adding ingredients and stirring the brew, working in a harmony neither of them had experienced with their previous potions partners. Harry had just added the last bit of moonstone and Draco was watching the cauldron change colors once again, this time from grey to orange as the draught bubbled.
“He was so angry, but he didn’t sound mad he was cold and distant and he reminded me so much of Aunt Petunia.” Harry gasped for breath and he began to shake, “and then he started to yell and I don’t know why but I thought I was going to be hurt. It wasn’t like a nightmare where I thought he was Aunt Petunia I knew I was in his office and I knew Snape was there but I just thought - I got so scared.” Harry cried as he spoke, he felt cold and exhausted but he could feel the anxiousness fading. Perhaps just talking about it had helped.
“I got a letter today from Dumbledore, Harry awoke some old magic the founders placed in a core under the school. I’ve been researching it all day, but the gist of it is that each of the Hogwarts Four put some of their magic into the school, but it was tricky would so each of the four could only give the magic one specific task to do. Salazar Slytherin connected his magic to the sorting hat and anytime a student is truly abandoned by their house his power will place that student in a different house.” Sirius took a deep breath and continued,
“You really don’t want to try and stop at Gladrags tomorrow?”
Harry looked surprised, he had forgotten his friends were there. “Draco?” he squeaked out. Draco had helped him so much lately and Harry had a passing thought that Draco may be the person he trusted most at the moment.
I'm sorry about not posting on Sunday, it's been a wild week.
“How’d you find this?” Draco wondered about halfway down the tunnel
Snape felt anger bubble inside of him, his students were supposed to be safe here and now a bloody ministry official was using magical artifacts to torture students.
“Yes sir, I was planning on taking it right before try-outs” Harry informed
Severus felt as if his stomach had been filled with cement, how had Harry gone his whole life without being comforted after a bad dream - it’s not like he himself had a great childhood but at least Severus had people to comfort him - Merlin,
“Yes Sir,” All three spoke at the same time causing the professor to smile.
“Yes, you are a Slytherin now, and while it is not possible for a student to request a change of house the magical core that the founders put in this castle have a powerful system that will remove a student from his or her house if that house is no longer willing or able to care for them. Tonight this magic detected that such was the case with you, I do not know what circumstances or events caused this to be true but it is and if you wish to talk about it now or in the future, I am here to listen but you do not owe anyone an explanation.” Harry knew something was wrong, he knew Neville was wrong, he knew things wouldn’t go back to normal, and as much as it hurt he knew that Ron wouldn’t forgive him.
“Sirius, be civil. Draco is a friend of Harry’s. He was invited. By Harry.” apparently Remus could decipher the tone and he quickly squashed it while summoning two extra chairs for the students to take.
“Tarantallegra”
The house-elves had delivered a message from Minerva and 2 from Albus, but he didn’t have time to read over them yet. He meant what he said to Rackharrow, this magic isn’t something to take lightly, whatever happened to the Potter boy it must have been atrocious for the school to do this. He decided the memos to his snakes could wait until Potter was settled, Snape had accepted the minute his memo arrived that he wouldn’t be sleeping this evening luckily pepper up potions existed for such nights.
Snape didn’t miss the look of despair that crossed the boy’s face as he mentioned his house. He didn’t know what happened but Severus was going to make it right, for Harry...and for Lily, it was the least he could do.
Harry looked around the room, there were four large four-poster beds, they looked nearly identical to the ones from his old dorm except for curtains and bed coverings these were an elegant silver and green, a harsh contrasts to the bright red and gold ones he was used to. It was colder in the dungeons than it had been up in the Gryffindor tower but Harry noticed an unlit fireplace that could be lit if it got any colder.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Flitwick stood in silence for a few seconds, Harry was trembling. Hermione had spoken just like Dudley; he knew this would happen, people always get mad at him when he stands out.
“I’m glad to be back, Sirius what’s going on love?” Remus asked as he began to play with his lover’s hair, pulling it down from the frizzed bun and running his long fingers through it.
“It’s Harry,” Sirius straightened up as he spoke so he could look at Remus while he talked.
“We could go get you new ones - at Hogsmeade next weekend, or we could owl order some.” He suggested,
“My cousin Dudley was never very smart and it always made him mad when others got better marks than him but he didn’t want to put in any work to get the higher marks himself. So when my aunt and uncle realized if I was doing worse than him it would make him happy I started getting in trouble,” Harry had to stop for a moment remembering the type of trouble he used to get in and the punishments it would lead to, “- I got in trouble anytime I got a higher mark than Dudley. I thought it would be different at Hogwarts because he isn’t here, but then when I got higher grades than Hermione she would get upset just like Dudley used to so I just kept doing a little worse than I actually could because I didn’t want to lose my friend. I didn’t want anyone to be mad at me, so I just worked like Ron did and it kept everyone happy.” when he was finished talking Harry couldn’t bring himself to look at his professor, he was scared of seeing that look of disappointment or even worse pity. Under the table, Draco gave his hand a reassuring squeeze which gave Harry the courage to look up at his classmate.
“No, please don’t apologize, I’m just processing a lot. How did you notice me so quickly? And why do you care this much when...when no one else ever has? My old friends, they have all seen me do all of those things and - and so much more and they never-” a sob cut Harry off, “teachers here and from my muggle school - they have laws in the muggle world, teachers are supposed to report anything they find suspicious but no one ever did - no one has ever cared before. I thought they cared about me.” Harry’s voice cut out for one moment, and when he continued he was angrier than before, “Hell I thought Hermione and the Weasley’s actually
From Helga Hufflepuff, when a student was sick, hurt, or undernourished her magic would inform the acting Headmaster of the situation and work to help bring all students up to full health. Helga believed there was no reason to leave children to suffer when they didn’t have to. She used her power to assure even when she had gone that no student in any house would have to go unnoticed.
Harry wasn’t at Hogwarts he was at Privet Drive but that couldn’t be right, he had gone left for Hogwarts already - hadn’t he? He remembered being on the train and going to the feasts but something was wrong.
“don't worry Draco I don't think many people know but Blaise does suspect." She assured him. "hmh" he was going to have to deal with that eventually, but Draco had something else on his mind.
“It’s n-nothing” Harry couldn’t stop Draco as he quickly reached out and grabbed his arm, Harry flinched drastically at the sudden touch, Pansy noticed and it helped to confirmed what she and Draco assumed about the starvation only being a part of what the muggles did to Harry, but Draco didn’t notice he was trying to process what he was seeing.
“Now Mr. Potter, along with the potions I will be instructing you to drink to help with your recovery you will also need to pay close attention to what you’re eating because your body is severely undernourished. I assume that your stomach is too small to handle large meals so you will need to eat a minimum of 3 meals a day. If Professor Snape and I don’t notice an appropriate amount of change in your nourishment you will need to start eating prepared meals that I will instruct the house-elves to make and bring to you each day.” Harry would eat whatever he needed to avoid that, he didn’t need another thing making him stand out.
thanks to the user Aegopodium for suggesting the weighted blanket!!!
“We need to speak with Mr. Potter” Poppy spoke opening the curtains and allowing herself and Severus inside.
“What would you like me to do,” Harry pulled Draco from his trance
“I’ve always had some, but they’ve been a constant, every night actually,  since the graveyard and they’re worse now.” Harry shook a little as he spoke,
On their way to the greenhouse, Harry asked Draco about it,
“I’m so sorry mate-”
Pansy showed the guys how to get into the room of requirement, and to everyone’s amazement it was perfectly set up for practical magic practice.
“Even if you could claim you were arrogant to the fact that the draught wasn’t properly brewed I am positive that you are aware of the dangers that come when double-dosing on any potions!” the professor was nearly yelling now, Harry snapped into defense as Snape continued
“I do want to take legal action, Sir. She should be stopped before she does this to anyone else.” Harry spoke quietly and Severus felt a rush of pride now that he was speaking up for himself.
Draco added the first parts of moonstone and began to stir, if Harry didn’t speak up Draco was bound to forget he was there he got so drawn into his potions work he was known to forget everything else around him. Pansy had informed Harry of this earlier in the library so he spoke up,
that this student is treated as any other snake. We protect our own, and as of tonight, he is one of our own. Am I understood?” The room was filled with silent motions of approval as Severus spoke up again.
Harry sat, stunned for a second - the man had grabbed his hand without any warning and Harry was using every fiber of his self-control to keep from violently flinching.
“Mr. Potter, performing well in a class isn’t something you do to draw attention to yourself. With the way you had been working previously, it is highly unlikely you could have scored well enough on your OWL’s to continue onto sixth-year potions. I would like to know what led you to believe that performing well is such a problem, and if you would prefer to do so privately we can go to my office.” Snape was getting that feeling that this conversation was not going to have a happy ending again.
“What on earth does that mean?” Draco asked,
“Of course we can talk about that Harry, what do you want to tell me.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make it awkward. We aren’t, or we don’t have to...ugh, I’m not normally this awkward.”
“It’s okay Pansy, I’m trying to get better at talking about them. Little stuff like this helps. Thank you.” Harry cut her off
“Do you always work together like this?” Harry asked as they were walking back to the dungeons
“Good morning Mr. Potter, Madame Pomfrey is expecting us this morning. Are you ready?” he questioned stopping by the exit of the common room.
“It’s okay Harry, no one is upset,” Snape stated again.
“Merlin, that could have been bad. Thanks, mate.” Draco placed his free hand on Harry’s shoulder and a gesture of thanks as they waited a minute longer for the flames to settle, adding hellebore to an open flame could have been enough to make Snape take back his previous statement about trusting them.
“We’ll be waiting right outside, Harry.” Pansy gave Harry’s left hand a gentle squeeze as she spoke and she and Draco exited the classroom with delay.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter,  if you could please stand while I ask you some more questions about the incident I promise to keep this as brief as possible.” Amelia smiled kindly as Harry stood
“You’re not any trouble Harry, I’m really glad you’re okay.” the relief was evident in Draco’s voice. Harry looked embarrassed, but he didn’t try and argue - he was very tired.
“He’s worried about you...because you’re in Slytherin?” Draco asked getting defensive, both of his house and of Harry who he was growing very protective over.
“I’m ready now Ma’am” Harry’s voice was still soft but it was much clearer now, especially when he looked up to properly address the women. He wasn’t sure how much Draco’s tips would matter now that he had a meltdown in the courtroom, but he figured he should keep it up, just in case.
“Harry, I’m not going to get any closer if you don’t want me to, but I’m not going to leave until you want me to either, okay. Just take your time, and tell me what you need when you’re ready. I’m not going anywhere.” Draco was just speaking to fill space at this point, but he wanted Harry to know he wasn’t going to be alone.
“Bloody course you were meant to be here, you think that the magical core of Hogwarts itself woke up for fun.” a girl with straight blonde hair joked
“Thank you, Draco”. This year was going to be so much different than Harry imagined.
A dream, Harry thought. The Weasleys weren’t all dead - just Percy - the memory barely flicked in his head before he noticed the pain he was in. He must have been too loud again, Uncle Vernon’s sleep-deprived face was towering over him. Harry whimpered.
“No Sir, there hasn’t been any other big trouble. There was a hostile conversation in the great hall but it was anticipated and we handled it.” Draco spoke formally and nodded in thanks as he finished
“Harry Potter, I’m very sorry this has happened to you. I’m Rue Raywood, I’ve been a dark magic examiner for the ministry for over 60 years. Today I’m going to magically look into your hand - that way I’ll be able to confirm the scarring was made by a Black Quill. I’ll also be able to remove any magical signature that was left behind. It won’t hurt but it may feel a bit odd. Just let me know when you’re ready to begin.” Rue Raywood was a very serious woman but she smiled slightly up at Harry when she finished her speech.
“You can’t honestly be that daft Crabbe.” Draco chuckled after Vincent finished his story about his summer adventures.
Harry was proud of himself too. He still had the paper in his hand; he was planning on showing it to his new friends once they got back to the common room.
Draco had been subtly giving Harry comportment lessons all semester, he kicked them into high gear in the hour before Harry’s trial.
He told Hermione that he knew about her and Ron and that he was happy for them, and he assured her that Hedwig was free and could deliver him letters if she sent them he just wouldn’t see them until the evening when his relatives were asleep.
“But come on, I want to have a chance to eat before we get our schedules.” Blaise prompted, quickening the groups walking speed.
Harry froze, listening to every kind word Snape had to say - he decided to stay - slowly and silently he turned around and lowered himself back into the abandoned chair.
Staring at the two-story house Harry wondered again how he could have been so stupid. There was no fire escape or anything that he could use to climb up. The front door was sure to be locked, and even if it wasn’t his bedroom door was and he didn’t have a key. He was stuck.
“I’m sorry I spoke to you like that, not that it’s an excuse, but I lost control of my emotions for a moment, not because of your behavior but because I know how little you value or worry about yourself. You are more than a title and you deserve to be spoken to like a person. So I sincerely apologize. I would like to talk about what you just said,” The man’s tone had completely flipped from anger to understanding.
“Yes, honestly we should have just gone to potions.” despite saying he was fine Harry still felt like his nerves were firing 100 times per second and he was worried about missing Snape’s class.
“Moons, where are you?” Sirius thought out loud he didn’t know what to do should he write to Harry or respond to Dumbledore first. The Hogwarts owl was still sitting in his window, perhaps just waiting for a treat for all his troubles.
They were able to play and race each other around for nearly two hours before it was time to go back to the castle for dinner and Harry found himself feeling the best he had since returning to school, he was laughing and joking with his new housemates and they seemed to be enjoying his company as well.
The feeling of a hand on him shot Harry into consciousness, his screams continued as the threw himself into a corner and pulled his legs to his chest,
“Come on,” Draco reached out a hand to help Harry up, which he gladly excepted.
Harry held out his hand but Raywood gently placed it down on the table. She placed the palm of her left hand over the scars then tapped the top of her hand with her wand. Harry shivered as he felt the wave of magic pass through his hand. Harry liked the feeling, it made him feel connected to his magic in a way he never had before.
Harry stood near his professor’s door and grinned, he had left that meeting feeling much better than he had anticipated. Snape knew his mother and he had offered to tell Harry bout her, plus he was going to keep his secret, and that was all Harry cared about at the moment. Sure he’d have to make sure to cast an even stronger silencing charm because despite what his professor had said Harry still believed that his nightmares would burden his new dormmates.
Snape placed the weighted blanket on Harry’sshoulders and slowly made his way back around to face his student. “Do you need me to help wrap it around you?” he asked
