He found himself wondering why Malfoy even bothered with these men, as he clearly didn’t particularly care for them and, on a few instances, seemed frigid and overly composed in their presence. But it never failed that they’d leave together after just a single drink, Malfoy leading them out with a courteous arm hovering behind them. Presumably to follow up that drink at home with some type of more
, Draco. What did you think...” Harry trails off, a look of dawning comprehension breaking slowly across his face. Draco hates it. He hates this situation he’s gotten himself into, he hates the look on Harry’s face, he hates the pity he thinks he sees there and more than that, he hates how much
But for now, he sighs into the quiet of the room as hands turn to lips. First to his collarbone, now mended, shards knitted back into place. Then to his hip where a new scar joins the others, each in their devotion to this man who has marked him, changed him irrevocably over the years. Scars he now traces with his fingertips as he eyes his reflection, savoring the finality of their connection. Even if severed in their physicality, the scars will always remain as a part of him. The pieces of flesh tendered and raw will be there on his body to mark the passage of their time together.
Draco remains silent, playing his own part perfectly, feeling his veins warm, his blood rush south, Harry’s hands reacquainting themselves with his body as his lips wander closer to his cock. He’s patient, reigning in his desire to guide Harry’s face where he wants it most, waiting. He doesn’t want to break this tentative understanding, doesn’t want to give Harry the chance to think about the consequences too soon. He wants Harry mindless with need, wrecked, throwing caution to the wind. He wants Harry in this gentle way he gets after he’s been injured, handling Draco like spun glass, something delicate to be careful with. He wants to take it, bottle it up, bathe himself in it, store it away for the days when he’s still waiting and he can’t remember how it feels.
Harry passed the martinis off to his server, quickly putting his station back to rights with a grin.
He watched surreptitiously across the room as Malfoy spoke with the hostess, flashing a winsome smile her way before peeking over his shoulder for a moment. He was dressed to the nines, sleek navy trousers hugging his hips, a starched white shirt stretching deliciously over his chest, braces a pair of stark black straps leading from his waist up and over his shoulders. A single curved finger held a matching blazer casually behind his shoulder, as he braced his forearm against the little podium, clearly enjoying himself as he chatted up Harry’s employee. He watched as she giggled, flipping her dark hair over her shoulder, clearly enamoured with Malfoy as she crossed her long legs and tilted her hips just enough to appear curvy.
. But he’s a selfish man- selfish enough for the both of them. He’ll ignore the feeling eating at his chest, weighing down his days, keeping him up at night, if he can have this. Just one more time. One more illusion to solidify itself, to prove that it’s not just him here.
Harry swallowed a moan, pressing closer to Draco, heated desire weaving itself deep into his blood. He bent closer, wanting desperately to close the gap between them, just as Draco tilted his head to do the same. Their lips met as they pressed closer together, Draco’s hands greedily sliding up Harry’s torso and tangling themselves into his hair, tugging it slightly with a gasp, angling their lips to meet again, and again, and again. Each kiss, deeper and more delectable.
“What?” Draco’s voice is hoarse, breaking slightly, leaving him as little more than a whisper. He clears his throat, before continuing, “What do you mean?”
“Well, you know that I love a good mojito. So I appreciate you keeping the classic ingredients here, and experimenting with its form, instead.” Draco took a breath, sending another embarrassed glance at Pansy, who was smirking with her hands folded beneath her chin mockingly, “It’s interesting, because you get a perfect combination of each flavor - the mint, the lime, the rum, that bite of the soda. It’s like you never have to experience that insufferable watered down version at the bottom of the glass. Instead it’s capturing that first sip every time.”
Harry was honestly surprised he hadn't seen him here until now. He hadn’t planned for his pub to be considered top-tier, the opposite of what anyone would expect from Harry. But the fact of the matter was, his menu ended up incredibly posh, and a large portion of his patrons deemed his drinks "the haute couture of cocktails." If there was anyone that made him think of
Pansy rolled her eyes, watching Draco’s outburst, as if this was something she’d had to listen to before. She grabbed her clutch, stringing it across her body as she moved to get up.
“We don’t really, uh, make those here.” Harry reached a hand up to tug on his hair, lost for words and utterly flustered at Pansy’s lewd drink orders.
There had been a few others, but nobody seemed to spark much of an interest for him. Not like Terry had. And Harry had decided that now that he knew what a real relationship was like, what it felt to be loved and accepted as himself, as just
, do you? - do you have any of those fancy American drinks?” Pansy leaned excitedly over the counter, examining the bottles of liquor and the various ingredients.
Draco shifts, hands moving slowly to rest on Harry’s shoulders, trembling as they trail up to thread themselves into long, inky locks, fingernails gently grazing against his scalp, doing what he can to soothe Harry. He knows it’s selfish, that they’re here by his actions alone, but it’s all he can do these days to ease his own guilt. He wants to smooth Harry’s wrinkled brow, wipe away the anxiety of the evening, erase all the tension between them that reminds them that Harry is not his, that he’s not Harry’s - not outside of these moments.
He wants so badly to let it crash over him, to spill down his throat, to watch Harry swallow him down with every pulse. He’s only done that once before, and it’d been a mistake to let it end so soon - to be in full view of watching the spell break as Harry’s eyes widened with guilt before he rushed to the floo, thumbing at the corner of his mouth even as the green flames spun him away.
“Yes! Exactly! Did you know that Frank Fogarty was actually a vaudevillian comedian, and it’s rumoured that’s where the drink got its name?”
. What are you even talking about, Pansy?” Draco scoffed, patting down his trousers as he attempted to locate his wallet. “These are
There’s a stinging behind Draco’s eyes, wetness gracing his cheeks, saltiness coating his tongue, and Draco is resolutely
Reality abruptly returned to Harry. He blushed furiously as he wrenched his eyes away to regain his composure. “
Harry felt his face fall, attempting to rearrange his features and stifle his disappointment. On the one hand, it was technically good news that Draco hadn’t been bringing failed dates to his bar. But Harry still couldn’t be sure of having a chance with him, of having his affections returned.
Draco’s lips trail up, languidly capturing the beads of sweat painting his stomach with his tongue, unhurriedly making his way towards Harry’s leaking cock as it twitches against his belly. He licks teasingly up the length, lapping softly at the head, groaning quietly as he finally takes it into his mouth. Draco’s hands gently caress Harry’s thighs as he gasps above him, fists pulsing in the blankets beside him. Draco knows that he’s resisting reaching out, not wanting to tangle his fingers through his hair, fighting that last bit of control that says this is
, tied down and tucked away, kept at bay until the next time one of them breaks. He sighs, rolling to his side and half heartedly reaching a palm out to brush against the empty side of the bed.
Harry looked back up, watching as Malfoy’s cheeks flushed prettily, his teeth flashing bright white as he bit his lip.
Draco stepped back, hands dipping to his shirt to unbutton it. His shirt hanging loose from his shoulders, he moved to lower his braces, at which Harry stepped forward and hesitantly stopped his hands.
He looked like something out of a wet dream, platinum hair dripping as his hands rubbed the front of his chest. Harry raked his eyes over Malfoy. The white collared shirt clung to his skin, translucent with moisture, and highlighted the muscles of his chest and shoulders.
you, has he?” Harry hid a grin, shooting an amused look at Draco, who buried his face in his hands. “That’s pretty high praise, honestly, it seems like he knows his stuff.”
Harry finally tears his mouth free, panting harshly against his neck, nipping his collarbones, his hands having a mind of their own.
Harry shuddered, feeling his blood rush south, fingering Draco’s braces  as he ran his hands down Draco’s chest.  His palms tingled as they dipped beneath Draco’s shirt and finally met the heat of Draco’s bare skin.
“Well, charm or no, it’s quite tasty. A bit earthy and floral, tempered against the bite of the lime. It’s clever, even without your colour-changing party tricks.”
Draco sighed, running his fingers through his hair before rubbing an exasperated hand over his face.
Draco let out a low moan, and a hand found its way into Harry’s hair once again, guiding his pace, hips pumping slightly on each downward stroke.
He’s used to waiting for Harry. The kind with an untenable end, unfathomable and uncertain. Now, the waiting has changed.
“I can’t believe you know that! Yes! It’s an American cocktail, so anyone who serves them in London is typically just creating them because they’re popular, but they don’t know anything about its history!”
Draco gently tugs Harry back, dragging him away from his cock with a quiet gasp, watching as it inches out of his delectable mouth, lips slick with spit and swollen red. He gives himself this moment to look, just the barest second, as Harry’s eyes open, burning, glazed over with his own wanting. He sears it into his memory, promises himself he’ll savor it later. But right now, it’s time for the second act, for Draco to play his part, to ensure the natural order of this
He’d started experimenting with cocktails shortly after resigning, for lack of something to do with his hands, and upon the realization that he
Harry walked towards the back room, glancing over his shoulder to make sure Malfoy was following him. He pushed open the swinging doors and winced as they knocked against his latest keg shipment. He held the door open for Malfoy to come through, as well. Harry rummaged through the clean towel bin, grabbing a handful. He turned around to hand them over and got his first look at the damage, now exposed under the bright lighting.
recipe was first published in 1951, but the drink is actually much older. It’s considered a prohibition era cocktail for that reason, and was actually served in a club in Detroit as the most expensive on the menu.”
much to his consternation. He’d testified for Malfoy, after all, after the war; he’d argued that he should have the right to return to Hogwarts. He’d accepted the apology he was given in a series of trembling words with a handshake and a nod in the eighth year common room, and that was that.
“Three years,” Harry mumbled, before snapping his mouth shut abruptly, feeling a flush steal across his cheeks.
“A shirt, Potter. Do you have any hiding back here? I’m sure you have some stocked merchandise? Promo materials? Since mine is ruined?”
“Well, then, what about a margarita? That’s a pretty standard drink, yeah? You can salt his rim for him, he likes it that way.” Draco choked, covering his face again as Pansy continued, “I like a sugared rim, myself. It’s much more pleasurable to drink.”
Draco gulped and shook his head slightly, but raised the glass to his lips and tossed his head back. Harry stood stock still as he watched Draco’s throat bob as he swallowed the liquor, setting the glass on the bartop before pulling Harry closer, his breath hot against his skin. Harry gasped as Draco’s tongue delicately reached out, skimming against his collarbone and gently lapping up the foam. His mouth pressed harder, licks turning to kisses, teeth nipping slightly as he worked his way up Harry’s neck to nibble his earlobe. He breathed against him for a moment and Harry took in large, panting breaths before Draco left a soft kiss on his neck.
“The letters, Draco. You should read them.” Harry turns back to the hob, twirling the spatula mindlessly between his fingers, much like he does with his wand at the office. Most people probably don’t notice. But Draco does. Of course he does. He’s spent far too much time observing, watching, waiting. Waiting for the perfect time to strike, waiting for Harry to save him. Waiting for Harry to heal him. Waiting for Harry to fall to his knees and put his hands on him again.
“Business,” Harry pulled him closer, grinning widely as he grabbed Draco’s face with both hands, “and boyfriends.”
Harry huffs, uncrossing his arms and leans forward, placing his palms on the counter. His hands frame the rings, crumple the parchment of the unread letters.
Her shiny black bob swished around her shoulders, a flinty smirk on her red lips as she demurely sat at the stool directly across from him.  She crossed her legs before turning to glare over her shoulder. Draco fidgeted awkwardly, adjusting his shirt and smoothing down the front before shuffling to Pansy’s side and taking a seat at the bar.
He thought nothing of it the first few times, different men always accompanying him and joining him for a drink. Malfoy would select something new off the menu, rattle off a series of descriptors for the taste, give him his compliments, and return to a table.
Harry was thankful for the chance to busy his hands, and entirely grateful to Malfoy for not forcing them into some version of polite
The pride of ownership and the now familiar rush of creativity. The magic rushing to the tips of his fingers, the awe of watching the science unfold before him. The sweet gratitude he felt in being able to bring together the magic of wix and muggle with an easy pour of liquor and the shake of a wrist, much to the delight of his regular string of customers.
Then there was Terry Boot. Harry had bumped into him during a late-night Tesco run, and he’d made him laugh with his assortment of random food items. Terry was clever, his wit bitingly sharp, and he was surprisingly squeezable, once Harry had gotten close enough to find out. They’d made a good run of it, before he accepted a fellowship in the States.
Harry shudders, fingertips pulsing against Draco’s thighs. He can feel the sharp, metal edge of Harry’s wedding band digging into his flesh, knows he’ll have a bruise there in the morning, a small imperfection that only he’d be able to see. It’s one of the only marks he’ll vanish, not wanting to think about its implications; the rest he’ll keep for himself.
The room spins beneath him, the air sucked clean from his lungs, the rug ripped out from under him. Harry’s mindless murmuring is a numbing cacophony adjacent to the buzzing filling his ears as he raises the newest letter to eye level.
“Sure, mate. They’re terrible,” Harry deadpanned, utterly amused at Draco’s attempt to deflect. “You know, I’ve heard you telling off those dates of yours that you bring by. And it very much sounded like you enjoyed the cocktails.”
You just come in here, driving me crazy with your posh accent, and your fit arse and those damn silver
would be thrown up around the pair. But Malfoy always seemed to have choice words for his partners, especially when they insulted Harry’s craft, and Harry found that curious. Out of character, even. Sure, they were no longer enemies, or even rivals. But he never thought he’d see the day that Malfoy would
Harry places his palms on either side of Draco’s face, tugging him up before crushing their lips together. It’s hardly a kiss at all, messy and broken, whispers and murmured moans and desperate pleas filling the space between them, each of their faces wet with sweat and grief, and it’s not perfect, but it’s
He was surprised to find that it was a rather endearing look on his face, and was equally disturbed that he just combined the words
. Basically just a fancy way of saying food science. Or, drink science, in this case. The acid of the lime juice interacts with the butterfly pea ice cubes, and then the addition of the gin and the tonic water lightens it a smidge.”
are you doing, Pans-” Draco whispered, mortified and attempting to pull her arms back from the bar top that she was slowly encroaching on.
Draco swallows thickly, limbs shaking from the stress of waiting for Harry to adjust, watching Harry breathe through the initial intensity, furrowed brow finally smoothing as he begins to rock his hips back against him with a low moan. Draco almost loses it immediately, the novelty of being able to experience Harry face to face, to watch as he becomes blissed out. Draco is enraptured, drowning in Harry. He bites his cheek to distract himself from the sheer sight of it.
Malfoy laughed softly and brought his hand up to cool his burning cheek with a glance back towards the doors.
He opted for a nice pair of jeans and a sharp collared shirt instead of his usual ratty pub tees. With a tight knot of anticipation low in his belly, he wondered if Draco might stop by the bar tonight; if he’d have the chance to talk with him, to see that shiny platinum hair rustled and rumpled by nervous hands. That sense of suspicion now transfigured into
“It’s-” Malfoy smacked his lips slightly, peering down at his glass with surprise, before meeting Harry’s eye. “It’s very tasty, actually. Unexpected. Grapefruit is already quite tart on its own, so I was a bit worried with the stacking of the lemon juice and bitters that it’d be too much. But somehow,
Draco sighed, pinching his nose in exasperation. “I want to open a new gastropub, and it seems like having a drink menu like
Draco’s eyes flashed open, having at some point slipped closed while he untangled the mix of flavors. His cheeks flushed as he glanced at Pansy before placing the spoon back on its plate.
at Malfoy. He ducked quickly to place the row of glasses - now shiny and clean - beneath the bar top. He popped back up only to be met with a look of amusement on Malfoy’s aristocratic features.
words, naming a thing that could not be named. Too close to the surface now that he can’t help stop them from tumbling out of his mouth.
Draco inhales quietly, pulling away slightly to admire, watching in awe as a finger, and then two, disappear inside of Harry. He twists his wrist as he continues to plunge deeper, seeking out that sweet spot of white-hot pleasure. Harry’s rim grips tightly against Draco’s knuckles on each retreat and his moans ring out in increasing cadence. Draco rests his cheek against Harry’s thigh to anchor himself, to cement this moment to his memory. He’ll never forget how good this feels, how Harry looks, arse clenching around his fingers, wanton and panting against his bed, gasping out his name, Harry’s heels digging in against his shoulders, hands tangled in his hair. It’s a sight to behold, and Draco cherishes it, cradles it gently, lets himself shatter to make room for this adoration that he knows will ruin him.
-” Draco chokes off with a ragged breath, can’t help but move faster against him, wild and desperate and urgent, “
“Er, my shirt was...wet.” Harry shuffled, tangling a hand in his hair, before smoothing it down again and stuffing his hands into his pockets. “So what, er, brings you by?”
. Bloody pain in the arse to make, of course. I had to buy a fancy gadget to shape them and that’s not even mentioning the process of getting the right ratio of fresh grapefruit and simple syrup, but…” Harry shrugged, tapping out a few dashes of cinnamon on the top of the drink before placing it in front of Malfoy. “It’s worth it for the experience, I think.”
Draco can’t let that happen again, not with how long he’s waited this time. It’s been three months since he’d last had Harry spread open, slack-jawed and panting, and he won’t waste this opportunity to draw it out for as long as he can, to delay reality from crushing them both. If this is the last time, he doesn’t want it to end like this. And he’s too close to tipping over the edge.
Grateful to finally be alone, Harry ripped his wet shirt over his head, grimacing as it peeled away from his skin. He wadded it up angrily, throwing it towards the swinging doors of the back room.
Harry’s hand found its way around the back of Draco’s waist, the other curling up the side of his neck, soft platinum strands of hair wrapping themselves around Harry’s fingers. Draco whimpered, a shiver breaking across his body.
Draco spluttered, angrily shoving the galleons for the tab across the counter. Pansy looked confused and mouthed
Draco’s eyes find the stack of letters on the counter, recognizing the same plain parchment, but stills. They’re scattered, unfolded and bent, shivering against the breeze, mocking in their hazy waving. He takes a cautious step towards them. And then he sees it. Harry’s ring glinting brightly on the countertop, a halo of parchment surrounding it.
He spent most of his days and nights running his pub, or experimenting with new drinks for the menus, or when he’d finally get home, he just ordered take out, took off his trousers, and watched reality shows on the telly. He was just Harry: a regular guy, arguably a workaholic, and an awkward person who didn’t really know how to interact with people in relationships.
” Harry’s voice is hoarse, wrecked in his desire, broken between gasping breaths that fill the room. “
, when it was clearly so practiced and refined. A mask that set upon his features as easy as breathing.
Draco breathes out slowly. Sitting back on his heels as he mutters a spell under his breath to conjure lube, he quickly coats his cock before pausing to rub the remainder against Harry’s hole, fingers teasingly dipping in before pulling away as Harry starts to rock against his hand. He cautiously eyes Harry’s bitten lips, his purposeful stare to the ceiling, his trembling jaw. Harry moves to roll over, like he always chooses to do when they’ve gotten to this point, but Draco grabs his hips instead to still him. He’s breaking their unspoken rules, he knows, but his selfish heart is beating too hard in his chest, swallowing up his inhibition, begging him to take just a bit more this time.
Harry turned away, tucking his chin as he attempted to hide a grin at the praise. Warmth settled low in his chest as Malfoy continued to ramble on in that posh way of his, the crisp notes of his accent sharp enough to cut glass. He busied himself putting away the cocktail pearls, placing them back in the small ice box beneath the bartop. He wiped a rag mindlessly against the wooden surface before pausing at Malfoy’s long-winded explanation of flavour. It seemed that he knew quite a bit for being a
Harry peppers kisses across his cock, tongue darting out to lap at the head, licking at the pre-cum that’s gathered there in his exploration. He doesn’t look up, not yet fully immersed in this quiet space, the inevitable
Over a year, at least, since he'd wandered the streets on an evening jaunt and spotted the abandoned restaurant. Harry'd been meandering through his life without direction after quitting the Aurors. He'd made it through training just fine, on a quick track after Kingsley had gutted the department and they'd found themselves short of Aurors on the right side of the law.
there. Occasionally, he’d catch a quick grimace, or a furrowed brow crossing Malfoy’s features before a
“I figure you can go first, since my shirt is already off.” Harry gestured vaguely for Draco to raise his glass before grabbing a spoonful of the foam. “You take the shot and then you lick this,” Harry dabbed the foam across his collarbone, letting it sit in the concave of his collarbone, “to chase the tequila.”
“Well, I can’t say that’s exactly what I expected when I came here tonight.” Draco laughed softly, gently tugging Harry up to press a light kiss to his lips and wiping away the mess he had made of his face.
A few months later, on an evening when he was walking away from the itch under his skin, restless and vibrating with a need to do
He slowly inches the door open, flinching slightly as it creaks. He slips into the hall and makes his way into the rest of the flat, shoulder sliding soundlessly along the wall, fingers curling over the familiar feel of his hawthorn wand. Draco slowly scans the living room, seeing nothing amiss but his clothing strewn about. Cautiously, he peers around the doorframe into the kitchen, eyes widening as they take in the scene.
“Draco?” Harry felt his lips curl up in a small smile, promptly freezing up as he took in Malfoy’s shocked reaction.
He let their criticisms slide off his back and bit his tongue, reminding himself that he hadn’t opened the pub for these types, anyways, and it wasn’t his fault that they seemed to
had changed for Harry. That Draco was some sort of distraction, or mistake, or just callous enough to take advantage of Harry’s good natured heart. And Harry was always sure to remind him of this every time he left, face awash with guilt, clutching clothes wadded in his haste, leaving Draco bereft and emotionally raw in his absence.
little buggers.” Harry topped the cocktail with a small pour of champagne before dishing a spoonful of tiny pink, glass-like spheres into the glass. “
Malfoy held his hand out to pay for the drinks, amused, a slight flush sliding up his throat. Impulsively, Harry reached his own hand out and curled it around the galleons, feeling the warmth of Malfoy’s palm seep from beneath the sharp edges of the coins.
Harry promptly dropped his cleaning rag, clearing his throat as he felt the flush rising in his cheeks. His hands moved gracelessly, knocking glasses over as he tried to quickly grab the necessary tools to create the drink. He let out a stuttering breath as he placed everything on the bar top. Harry chanced a glance and looked up from where he was pouring the grapefruit vodka into his mix glass, only to find a slight smirk crawling over Malfoy’s delightfully pink cheeks. His eyes glinted in amusement at Harry’s clumsiness.
. He grabbed two tall crystal glasses, dropping a few of his trademark butterfly pea ice cubes in each glass before pouring lime juice over the top. A bottle of gin was summoned beneath the bar, his hands hidden from view of the muggles currently occupying the space.
The landscape of this hope is unknown territory, an endless expanse with no guaranteed end. One he’s glad to throw himself into head first, without expectation.
Something small slips from beneath the layers of the letter in his hand. The ting of metal against tile rings sharp against the disconcertingly domestic kitchen, the sizzling of the bacon an ironic backdrop to the sinking of his stomach, the pieces of the puzzle quickly falling into place.
Harry’s eyelashes flutter as he lets out a moan, and then those viridian eyes, burning and heavy-lidded, meet his gaze. Just like that, as the last of Harry’s resistance falls away, Draco is lost, with no turning back. He knows it’s the end for him, and he
Draco’s lungs feel ready to swallow him whole, hands trembling as they map Harry’s skin, letting his memory soak it in. He imagines his fingertips as synapses tying his mind’s eye to sensory. Each heartbeat tapping into their magic, drawing in their very essence. Every freckle, every scar, every sigh. Each evocation and sensation broken down to the millisecond, embedding themselves within his neural pathways, an extra input to be encoded for later retrieval, snug and steadfastly rooted. These are the memories he’ll save for himself. For each maudlin moment in the future they’ll serve as an attestation of his worth. A reminder that he is worthy enough to love, but not worthy enough to keep.
, he slips beneath the waistband, delicately pulling his pants down below muscular hips, waiting for Harry to lift up so they can join the rest of his clothing on the floor. Harry inhales, deep and steady, once. Exhales shakily, his fingers twisting up the duvet at his sides, staring at the ceiling, blush blooming across his cheeks and spreading down his collarbones. Finally,
“Draco has regaled me with tales of your fancy cocktails! Imagine my surprise that he hadn’t deigned to bring me along as his esteemed guest.” Pansy tapped her long nails against the bar top, a staccato rhythm that was equal parts intimidating and nerve wracking, smile widening the longer Draco avoided Harry’s gaze. “Darling, why don’t you order for me?”
, spread out beneath him, limbs loose with want, all walls between them fallen to dust. No more lies here, or denial, or expectations. Just this. Harry, in his barest form, lips swollen and panting,
Draco lost rhythm as he curled forward, cried out, and spilled into Harry’s mouth. Harry did his best to swallow, stroking himself faster. Draco’s come ran down his chin, seeping out the sides of his spit-slick lips and finally tipped him over into oblivion. He groaned as he came in his fist, finally pulling off Draco’s cock, panting harshly against Draco’s thigh as he tried to catch his breath. Draco’s hand loosened in his curls, turning into languid caresses against his face and forehead, brushing the hair out of his eyes.
“It’s, well, it’s my take on your classic grapefruitini, I suppose. Most of the ingredients are pretty standard, like the grapefruit vodka, house simple syrup, fresh lemon juice and bitters. Uh, your typical list that you might find at any other pub.”
He’s at a total loss for words, flustered, unsure, hesitant. He’s on unequal footing, perhaps always has been, only holding his half of the story. Draco’s in uncharted waters, gasping into the unknown, rethinking what his role is for this part, remapping the path they’ve tread to get to this point, circling and pointless. “What does this all mean?”
“Well, Pansy has brought it to my attention that perhaps I’ve been a bit.. Evasive. So, I wanted to clear the air between us.”
He wants to keep this. He wants to spend hours in adoration, praising Harry’s bronzed skin, the tufts of hair peeking out from his waistband, the scars littering his frame. He wants to taste him, memorize the feeling, until he knows Harry like the back of his own hand. But he knows it’s impossible, intangible, something that will always remain beyond his grasp. So he takes what he can get, reminds himself of the ticking clock, and moves on far more quickly than his heart wants.
But instead, he nods, tucking his chin to his shoulder, chewing his bottom lip, cheeks flaring with a fresh burst of heat.
and interest, wondering how he’d never seen it before, Draco’s sharp patrician features softened by flushed cheeks and hidden smiles and the glint of those silver glasses Harry was so endeared by.
On this particular night, Draco is sure the ruse is up. That this is the last time. But then again, that’s what Harry always says at the end of it all. Draco just never knows which time it will ring true. So he grasps each moment in his hands, savors the lingering touch of Harry’s healing charms, trembles as each piece of clothing falls loose from his limbs. If every time is the last time, he promises himself that he will commit it to memory, a perfect piece to place in his pensieve, to relive when the waiting becomes permanent. For that time when Harry truly decides he can’t do this anymore, eviscerates him for his foolishness, and sends him to St. Mungo’s instead. That’s how he’ll know.
And Harry just looks at him, looks right through him, his eyes flashing as Draco opens his palm and shows the ring.
Draco swallows thickly against the lump in his throat, eyes darting down to spot the glint of a gold metal ring on the floor between his feet.
“Salazar, you boys are no fun.” She clucked her tongue, perusing the menu with a mere glance. “We’ll take two of those mojito spheres, then. That sounds tasty.”
Harry hurriedly steps out of his trousers and pulls on his pyjamas with trembling hands, then almost trips over his discarded robes in his haste to join the other boy.
”, he hisses, realising he’s started stirring the potion clockwise and immediately changes directions.
”SHHHH!” Dudley hisses furiously and starts throwing his head around doggedly, as if expecting something bad to happen.
For once, Harry doesn’t linger in bed once he wakes up. He doesn’t even try to go back to sleep, even though it’s Sunday and he could technically stay in bed until he gets hungry. Instead, as soon as the gradually growing light from the spelled wall lanterns wake him up, he shoots out of bed.
She stops dead right next to the statue behind which Harry is hiding and desperately holds his breath, hoping to stay hidden and not have to deal with her. But Trelawny’s hasn’t spotted him, she is frowning down at the card in her hand like it has somehow insulted her.
He’s noticed a change in his boyfriend’s attitude towards their relationship, of course. Draco still won’t hold hands or kiss outside of the Slytherin Common Room, but Harry is pretty sure the students in the other houses will be able to work it out anyway, when the blonde sits so close to Harry in the Great Hall and the library that they’re practically draped over each other, and he’s sure Draco must realise this as well, so he obviously doesn’t care if people know…
Cool, damp air rushes past him as he falls, further and further down… Until finally he drops onto something quite soft with a muffled
”So? We were in the North Tower!” Blaise says. ”There’s no way she could have heard us from the ground…”
Harry reluctantly steps back from Draco and nods. He feels one of the blonde’s hands trail down the side of his arm and grab his hand. He shoots him a happy smile, interlacing their fingers together.
”Hey — the other Harry sounds like a right loser! What are you trying to say?” Harry demands good-naturedly.
”We think this is great news”, Remus interrupts in a loud and clear, before Snape has a chance to reply and Sirius shoots him a sour look. ”Come and sit down. Have some cake.”
Harry wheels back around again, fumbling for his wand with shaky fingers as he scans the opposite side of the street, sure he caught the flash of a hex in the corner of his eye…
As the weeks pass, Draco becomes more and more stressed over the impending exams and Harry becomes more and more anxious about the Philosopher’s Stone.
”Well you won’t like this then…” Blaise says drily. ”The Weasley girl and Longbottom are also in the club…”
”Mister Potter, do hurry up…” Snape says silkily. ”We don’t want to take up any more of your classmates’ time than is absolutely necessary, do we?”
”Thank you again”, Remus says, shaking the hand of an official-looking witch wearing scarlet robes and horn-rimmed glasses. ”Oh, here he is… Harry, this is Madam Bones from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She’s come to give you back your wand.”
Draco tugs Harry up, his limbs loose and pliable under his hands, following willingly, just as lost to this as Draco is himself. Draco kisses him, crushing him close to his body. Every inch of Harry presses in against his nakedness. The rough fabric of his auror robes rubs against his hips, his chest, his arms and he’s tasting every gasp and moan that leaves Harry’s mouth as their lips meet, again and again, urgently taking as much as he can to tide himself over in the upcoming unknown after the night is over and Harry’s left him to languish.
Pansy grasped one of the spheres and gently placed it in her mouth. Her lipstick left a ring of red around the silver spoon. Her eyes closed as a delighted smile broke across her face, chewing for a few seconds before turning to Draco, who had been watching avidly. She nodded excitedly, reaching for her second sphere as Draco reached out hesitantly to grab his own.
. He dug into the box to find a shirt that would work for him. He emerged with a medium, randomly guessing on Malfoy’s preferred size, and handed it over his shoulder blindly. Malfoy took it from him, as Harry pretended to re-sort the shirts to fit back into the box, resolutely trying to avoid ogling at the shirtless man any further this evening. There was a rustling of fabric behind him, the small ping of buttons hitting the stone floor at their feet. Harry squeezed his eyes shut tightly, fighting the urge to turn around and drink in the sight. A small grunt came before more swishing of cloth over skin, upon which Harry decided he was probably being ridiculous and gave up the ruse of sorting the t-shirts.
He gently unlatches the window. The bronze fixture’s gleam is muted in the morning light as it falls aside, before Draco pushes the windows open to let in a nondescript little grey owl. One that, oddly enough, looks a bit familiar. It nips lightly at his finger as he reaches to untie the parchment from its leg, before turning its neck to the side and hooting gently.
”Merlin, Remus…” Sirius mutters good-naturedly. ”Why don’t you call off Christmas while you’re at it—?”
”Well, she gave me detention, every night for the rest of the week, so eh… three… ehm, detentions, that first week of school…” he continues carefully. ”And I tried really hard to behave after that, daddy, I swear I did…”
She might as well has stabbed him in the chest with her fork, it probably would have felt much the same, Harry thinks as he stares down at his overflowing plate and counts mechanically from ten in his head for a second time.
They step back from the door and shut their eyes, waiting for the spinning to stop and when they open them again, the door with the fiery ’X’ is several paces to their left. Harry swallows and pushes at the door in front of him again, but this time it doesn’t budge.
Pansy gasps and slaps her hand against her mouth dramatically, but her wide eyes glitter with excitement.
”No…” Dumbledore says slowly, most of the amusement gone from his voice again. ”That you do not… You have until Friday morning…”
Blaise also joins them and crouches down at a safe distance from the crate, eyeing it indifferently as Harry reaches out and dangles half a grass-snake over the Skrewts.
Draco lets out a high-pitched scream as one particularly enraged Skrewt runs at him with its trembling stinger raised and throws a smouldering plank at it before legging it out of the pumpkin patch and diving into Hagrid’s hut through the back door. Harry and the other Slytherins, as well as a couple of Gryffindor girls, hurry after him and together they barricade the door.
”If Potter and Malfoy hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. It was about to finish me off when they got here.”
The next morning, he wakes up in a cold sweat, sure he’d dreamed the whole thing and that the First Task is still ahead of him. But then he puts his glasses on and spots the tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail curled up asleep on his nightstand… Heaving a great sigh of relief, Harry chuckles to himself. He really
Both boys jump. Draco immediately straightens in his chair and speers a piece of broccoli that he puts in his mouth and starts to chew quickly.
He quickly steps back again and even though he tries to remain stern, there is no mistaking the softness around his shining eyes. Harry grins back, but says nothing. He doesn’t have the words to express what he’s feeling right now… Adrenaline is still coursing through his system, his legs slightly shaky from it and his chest tight with emotion and still he feels incredibly light… so light in fact that, if his daddy’s hand on his shoulder wasn’t weighing him down, he might just soar away again, even without his broom… the noise from the audience reaches an almost deafening level and as he looks up at the hundreds upon hundreds of grinning faces, he feels so overwhelmed he doesn’t even know what to think…
Remus watches him silently for a moment, then sighs, ”No, Harry… You can’t have both, you have to choose one…”
”Why didn’t he want you to go back to school?” Remus frowns and sits down on the bed next to Harry, putting a comforting hand on his back.
”Correct”, Snape says. ”Calming anxiety and soothing agitation… it is also a potion that requires a particular precision, because should you be too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep… the ingredients and method are on the blackboard —”
”Harry…” Snape says slowly, as if getting a feel for the name in his mouth and then slides into the seat opposite him. ”So it’s really true… And you… you were really Sorted into… Slytherin?”
As they all file out of the restaurant, Lucius says he has some errands to attend to in a place called
”No — no more than he deserved”, Karkaroff croaks, his eyes starting to become panicked now that two of his precious names have turned out to be worthless.
Harry can hear Wormtail shuffle around on the ground, still whimpering and sobbing. In the next moment he stands up and moves over to puts the robes over man’s head one-handedly. As soon as the robes fall down his body, the man steps out of the cauldron with a graceful ease and as he turns around, Harry finds himself staring into the face that has haunted his nightmares for three years… it’s deathly pale, making the vivid, scarlet eyes burn all the brighter, and the nose is flat as a snake’s with thin slits for nostrils… he barely looks human anymore, definitely nowhere near as handsome as he’d been when he was sixteen, but it’s definitely Lord Voldemort.
”This is it…” Sirius confirms grimly. ”It used to be a nice area, actually… if my mother had seen this, well… I don’t think it’s actually possible for her to think any
The toad — Professor Umbridge, Harry corrects himself. He might as well get used to the name, so that he doesn’t slip up when addressing her and call her Professor Toad or something — is already seated at the teacher’s desk when they enter the classroom. Harry’s mind flashes back to Mad-Eye Moody — or rather the imposter Death Eater looking like him — lounging in that very chair, his magical eye swivelling around in its socket and registering everything around him.
It turns out Madam Pomfrey won’t let either of them stay the night in the Hospital Wing and shoos them out ten minutes before curfew.
It’s okay, he keeps telling himself. It’s okay, it’s okay, there is no Dark Mark on his arm, he’s unharmed, he’s here, he’s safe, it’s okay, it’s going to be okay.
He remembers sitting in a similar place along this table five years and a lifetime ago, staring at another copy of the
Mr Ollivander doesn’t even glance at Remus however, he keeps staring at Harry with an intensity that is making the boy feel uncomfortable.
there are iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs are being forced back into his head and his eardrums pushed deeper into his skull and —
Harry frowns and looks between Barty Crouch and his daddy, then glances over at Snape in confusion but his Head of House seems just as confused as him as to why the Ministry Official would assume his daddy is Sirius.
under the guise of reading so no-one will disturb him, but Harry can tell his eyes are firmly fixed on the photograph on the front page, never moving over the surrounding text at all.
Harry catches Remus give Sirius a miffed look, but the other man quickly shakes his head and gently ushers him out of the room without a word.
When he returns, Harry spends all of three seconds trying to secure the empty bird cage under his arm and haul the trunk out onto the front steps, before Professor Snape lets out a half-strangled noise of annoyance and swats his hands away from the trunk’s handle.
Snape shoots him a withering glare, but doesn’t say anything. But he doesn’t throw the map into the flames as Harry thought he would either, but instead reaches for the floo powder and tosses a handful onto the glowing embers, causing big, green flames to immediately roar to life.
”Wormtail had made a blunder, a big one and You-Know-Who was furious with him, but at the start of the dream he got a message by owl telling him that the problem had been taken care of and that someone’s dead… so he wasn’t going to feed Wormtail to his snake, after all… he’s going to feed me to it instead… then he tortured Wormtail with the Cruciatus curse and that’s when I woke up — ehm — and my scar was hurting… as well…” Harry finishes lamely. ”I wrote my dads and told them, they said to tell you… but I… I didn’t really want to bother you with it, Sir, so we went to Professor Snape instead, but he just took me to see you… and here I am.”
”I dunno”, Harry shrugs. ”Dumbledore made it sound like it was really important, but he wouldn’t say why. I’ve been thinking about it though… In the first memory he showed me, with Riddle’s granddad and mother, before he was born…”
”No way”, Seamus says, shaking his head stubbornly. ”The only student who’s good enough at Potions that they could brew Polyjuice is Draco and Granger. Draco hardly attacked himself and somehow I don’t see the bookworm using the Killing Curse — do you?”
In the next few days, the attack on Mrs Norris is the sole topic of conversation at the school, mainly because Mr Filch won’t let anyone forget about it. He keeps stalking up and down the corridor where the attack happened as if expecting the culprit to return to the scene of the crime, where the bloody message is still gleaming fresh on the wall despite the caretaker’s best efforts to scrub the blood off with ’Mrs Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover’, and when he isn’t guarding the spot, he’s skulking through the other corridors of the school, descending on unsuspecting students like some twitching vulture, trying to give them detention for such crimes as
”Boys keep back!” Professor Grubbly-Plank says firmly. ”Unicorn prefer a woman’s touch, so girls to the front and no sudden movements, please…”
To his utter bafflement, his dads exchange a quick look and then Sirius makes a quick excuse and dashes out of the kitchen.
”What?” Harry and Pansy echo each other worriedly, both watching the blonde warily as he glares down at the paper.
”Secondly”, Dumbledore says as soon as the noise dies down again. ”Since Professor Kettleburn retired last year in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs, our gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid has agreed to take up the position as Care of Magical Creatures teacher in addition to his gamekeeping duties!”
There’s no reply, everything is deadly quiet — except for the laughter that keeps echoing all around him — and then there are ghostly white faces looming out of the darkness, all around him, quietly grinning skulls surrounding him on all sides and he spins around in panic… The laughter keeps getting closer, but it doesn’t seem to be coming from any of the faces…
Harry chances a look behind him and sees an empty, but whole glass jar standing in a pool of dripping slime. Reaching up to feel the back of his head tentatively, covering the new bump there he feels some of the slime in his hair and pulls a face.
, Harry notices the crowd around them getting larger and larger. In fact, it seems as though all of Diagon Alley has suddenly decided to visit the old bookshop at the same time.
”You think his mum pulled him out of school, like she threatened to do last year?” Seamus whispers to Blaise, who also shakes his head.
There is sudden flash of red light in the room, and Harry is sure that Moody has fired a curse at him… but it doesn’t hit him. Instead he hears the deafening
The blonde springs to his feet and hurries around the table to join him. Harry rolls his eyes and stalks back out of the library, Draco trotting along behind him whilst fussing with the books in his bag.
” The unmistakably chipper voice of Cedric Diggory filters through the music and Harry’s insides sink.
”Hey…” Harry protests, turning slightly on the bench so that he can face the other boy and his smirking face full on. ”What exactly are you saying? You’d prefer me to not have a mind of my own?”
When Harry takes the seat opposite, he can see that it’s a essay on the Various Properties of Asphodels and that Professor Snape has marked it with a P and added a comment that includes the adjective
”Draco, do you prefer tea or coffee? Or chocolate?” Remus asks as he places the dessert on the table.
Suddenly there’s a knock on the door and Professor Snape frowns at it, striding across the office to open it. Draco is standing on the other side and Harry is immediately reminded of the memory he allowed their Head of House to see and quickly ducks his head and stares at the ground.
The Matron nods and then with a decisive pat on his ankle through the covers, she bustles back towards her office.
Remus eyes darts between Harry’s hands on top of the cover and his own in his lap and swallows a couple of times, then sighs and says ”I need to go away too… You know I need to travel sometimes—”
; Harry has chosen his present from Draco first and tears the wrapping paper off excitedly, beaming when a large box of chocolate frogs in unveiled, along with a Christmas card that Draco must have made himself, because the little moving drawing on the front depicts two boys flying together in the sky, one with white-blond hair and one with dark hair, round glasses and a small scar shaped like a lightening bolt on the forehead.
Harry frowns. Surely Snape must have told him about the Duelling Club? He wants to look over at his Head of House again, for direction, but for some reason he doesn’t feel like that’s an option somehow… He doesn’t want Dumbledore to think he’s hiding something, or lying…
”The mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure, nor are thoughts etched on the inside of skulls to be perused by any intruder”, Snape says curtly. ”The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, but those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and interpret their findings correctly, but it’s less about reading specific thoughts and more about sensing emotions or viewing memories…”
”That’s okay. Thank you”, Sirius says and helps Harry to his feet. ”Come on, runt… Let’s go take a look at that nose, eh?”
Draco doesn’t say anything and he doesn’t laugh either, which makes Harry feel even worse. But they both try their hardest to pretend everything’s fine and by the time they’ve finished their breakfast and are strolling towards the greenhouses for double Herbology with the Ravenclaws, Harry’s almost convinced himself everything actually
Snape’s narrowed eyes flashes darkly and he presses his lips so tightly together they seem to disappear altogether.
”Hogwarts Express gossip, I know you love it, so give it to me”, Harry grouses in rush. ”What have I missed?”
No-one says anything for a long time. Harry just stares as his daddy — the strongest man he knows — is physically fighting to keep it together, feeling his own heart pound desperately in his chest.
“Er,” Harry started awkwardly, not entirely sure what one says after watching a drink thrown in their ex-rival’s face, “Would you like a towel or something to clean up?”
“You thought,” Harry’s Adam's apple bobs in his throat as he swallows, a crack in his ineffable surface finally showing itself, “that Gin and I were still together.” He shakes his head slowly, rounding the corner of the kitchen counter, approaching Draco slowly as one would a startled animal. “
Pansy laughed loudly and grabbed Draco’s shoulder with an iron grip. Her nails dug into his starched white shirt as if physically restraining him from fleeing the scene.
Sirius jumps off the bike and leads it the last few hundred metres down the side street, not wanting to wake up the entire village by flying the bike all the way into James and Lily’s front yard — again — remembering Lily’s anger the last time he’d done so and woken up young Harry, whom the redhead had
She begins to walk towards the other two women, but stops dead when a low, deep voice wafts over from the front doors, ”That would be mine…”
There’s a collective gasp between the Slytherins and Pansy swivels back around in her seat and leans forward, hissing furiously under her breath, ”They can’t be
”So glad we didn’t have to deal with that”, Harry says and steps over its massive legs. ”Come on, I can’t breathe in here.”

. ”It was apparently made by Trelawney at the end of last summer, right after the Triwizard Tournament. But no-one was around to hear it at the time. I only found out it existed because Croaker — a particularly scatterbrained colleague of mine”, he adds as an aside to Professor Snape. ”Mentioned having seen the Harry Potter-Tom Riddle prophecy
Draco almost trips over in his haste to flee the Common Room, looking like a spooked animal. Harry gives his friends a sarcastic smile and gestures after him as if to say,
Although he’s never been here before and has no idea of what these glass spheres are, Harry knows where he’s going and with his scar searing and heart hammering, he begins to run again…
”So did you have a good time?” Remus says happily as he hugs him, his face smoothing out with relief.
And when they get to their Charms lesson, Professor Flitwick announces that he thinks they’re ready to try their hands at making objects fly, something they’ve all been looking forward to ever since their first Charms lesson when Flitwick made his own hat zoom around the classroom.
The ferret fades away again and Harry looks up to see his Head of House looking positively thunderous.
Lupin snaps his mouth shut and nods hurriedly, thrusting a steaming mug of hot chocolate in Malfoy’s face and then sitting down in the chair next to him, anxiously watching his profile.
Heart pounding in his chest, Harry quickly fumbles with his wand and gives the map a tap and mutters, ”
Shaking his head, Harry grabs his coffee cup and toast again and returns to the table. But as soon as his bottom hits the seat, he hears the
Harry is halfway through the second slice when the mail arrives outside the window, the two owls landing on the window sill, the Northern white-face tapping the glass insistently with its beak while the tired-looking barn owl with a rolled up copy of the
Once they’re outside in the corridor and away from the foul smell of troll, Harry suddenly notices something odd about the way Snape is walking — He’s limping — But even so, Harry and Draco almost have to jog to keep up with him and the man doesn’t slow down or look directly at them until they’re standing outside the Slytherin Common Room.
”Right…” Remus mutters. ”That’s alright. I’ll go get your books and you wait here… Where’s Narcissa?”
up at the friction. Draco smiles cheekily into the kiss, then breaks it. He playfully shoves Harry off him and sits up.
Startling awake, Harry realises the shaking is coming from his daddy’s firm hands on his shoulders. He scrambles up to sitting, gasping for breath even as a tight vice continues to press his ribcage together.
After a moment, the front door creaks open anyway and Harry feels his stomach clench in anticipation.
lodges itself in his throat and he blinks quickly, hoping to bat away the stinging sensation in his eyes…
Professor Snape strides down the aisle between the Slytherin and Hufflepuff tables and informs them that their Herbology lesson has been cancelled due to Professor Sprout needing to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a task she deems too tricky for the students to assist her with, especially now that the well-being of the mandrake roots is so important.
”What?” Harry frowns. ”No I mean… Okay, great, that’s… Interesting, thank you. But I meant, how common is it to, I don’t know, see it — openly — like, how many gay couples do you know about?”
to speak parseltongue, or how to start anyway. In Duelling Club he’d thought he’d been speaking English the whole time… He needed a snake… Maybe if he asks Draco to conjure one again?
”Me too, though”, Draco adds seriously, his warm breath ghosting over the scar on Harry’s forehead before he brushes his lips over it in a soft kiss.
”I don’t know”, Remus says quickly. ”I shouldn’t think so, there was no sign of a struggle. I’m sure he’s decided to go into hiding, that’s all… Now come on, I want to get this over with. Stay close to me, boys.”
”I consider her to be a very able Headmistress”, Dumbledore’s quiet voice can be heard. ”And a formidable dancer.”
After he’s opened the presents from his friends Ron and Seamus, Harry starts on the ones from his dads and happily hugs them as soon as he’s opened the last one.
He begins to walk quickly, glancing up at the small number plates on the shelves, until he reaches number ninety-seven and then he turns left and begins to jog soundlessly along the aisle between the two shelves…
They finally reach the tree line and she lets go of their arms. Harry barely refrains from rubbing his, feeling it throb in pain where her fingers had dug in.
”In my first year! The Weasley twins made these snowballs chase after Quirrell and smash him in the back of the head!”
”—busy time at the Ministry, with all those raids… I do hope they’re paying you overtime, Arthur”, Lucius sneers, then reaches into Ginny Weasley’s cauldron and extracts a very old and battered copy of
Harry feels a surge of annoyance and quickly pulls his hand away from Draco’s and slams it down on top of his chest instead, pretending to readjust the cover, then turns his face away.
”What’s the matter, Harry?” Pansy taunts as she sidles up to him, shoving her shoulder against his and confirming his guess. ”Scared of lightening?”
”Yeah, I saw my parents”, Draco says quietly and, at Remus wide-eyed stare, quickly adds. ”They didn’t see us. I just saw their backs, through the windows in Madam Malkin’s… But… They were heading down Knockturn Alley. My father has taken me there before, but… My mother wouldn’t be caught dead in that place… So…”
”Yeah, that’s probably a good idea”, Granger nods in agreement. ”Although, I’m sure he would be secretly pleased. It’s not like he hasn’t always fancied you… I mean, this world’s you…”
“Circe, Draco”, Pansy chuckles, thinking along the same lines as Harry. “Go wash your face, you look like a madman!”
But it’s a short-lived sensation… As soon as Remus has kissed him goodnight and the only light left in the room is the small sliver breaking through the crack he’s left between the door and the frame, unwanted memories start flooding Harry’s mind… Images of Draco begin to dance around Harry’s head, much like the illustrations of his favourite tales —
Harry has seen Granger walking around muttering to herself a lot lately, stooped low under the weight of her bookbag that is now twice the size than usual and bursting at the seams.
is my signature citrus foam. Lime, to be more precise. It’ll serve as our chaser.” Harry took a deep breath, glancing to the foam and then back to Draco. “Have you ever done a body shot?”
of them against his skin filling the silence, before carefully turning his face, letting his forehead drop against Draco’s shoulder, his breath burning his skin. Draco stills, caught between wanting desperately to lean into the anomalous touch and pushing him away, feeling the need to shield himself and keep Harry at arm’s length, needing the strength from that distance to finally,
“I-” Draco swallows down his nerves, feels them crawling up his spine, inching out their tendrils and filling his bones, twisting and tying him to his pride.
Harry makes a pained noise, something desperate and primal, before lowering his face and pressing his lips firmly against Draco’s. A sharp tug of want pulls at Draco’s chest, pressing him closer, sinking him into Harry’s skin, gasping against his mouth. Harry takes, and takes, and takes, and Draco is all too willing to give him everything. Every bit of himself, every broken shard, every stitch of his pieced together heart. Threaded from some of the lowest of his lows, from his darkness, and his shame and his selfishness. He’d tear it apart the second he was asked.
And instead, a cryptic message, not particularly angry or anguished or anything, really. Just that. Teach him selfishness. Show him happiness. Signed with a casual G, a flick of the quill that belies the message that’s been written. A relinquishing of rights, as easy as the drop of a ring against the floor and an owl in the kitchen and Harry flipping eggs in a pan and tea brewed to the exact temperature of his liking. As easy as laying a ring on the kitchen counter amongst a ruined graveyard of forgotten letters, pressed and peeled apart against their will, diligently avoided and desperately ignored. Truly a matched set, after all, both abandoned and departed from their familiar fingers.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, breaking the silence, his breath brushing against his lips, voice low and broken and sounding just as wrecked as Draco feels. Draco tenses, bracing himself for what comes next, because he knows.
He just couldn’t seem to really find anyone willing to invest in him, long term. It was always about the lightning scar, or fucking the guy who’d killed the Dark Lord, or even his wealth, when he hooked up with muggles. Nobody seemed to want to bother with him when they realized he wasn’t
Most of the men were largely their age, maybe a tad older, and seemed to hail from the upper echelon of society. He’d typically catch a few words from them, most of them grumbling about their drinks or offering suggestions on how
The thing is, he never thought he’d actually get this chance, an olive branch extended, an opening for a conversation they’ve been needing to have for months.
. He’s not sure if it was the look in Harry’s eyes, the tentative cuddling, the hand holding - or really, just every bit of it - but last night felt different. For him, at least.
“Sorry, we’re closed for the evening.” Harry lifted his gaze, surprised to find Draco slipping his jacket off and placing it on the bartop. “
He found himself irritated, disconcerted at Draco’s abrupt departure. A niggling worry sat in the back of his mind as he waved goodbye to the last of his patrons and began clearing their table. He waved a hand carelessly, charming the open sign to switch off and dimming the lights, no longer worried about any muggle bystanders.
A small cry slips from Harry’s lips, his hands moving to tug at his own riotous curls. But Draco can feel his cock leaking between them, twitching traitorously each time he says his name and it bolsters his instincts. He
The din rushed over him like a familiar friend, the sound of his patrons chattering, their glasses clinking, the quiet music all rushing over his senses and dousing him. A sense of calm settled in his bones, relief and comfort loosening his tight shoulders. He stepped behind the bar and waved Malfoy over to a stool on the very end, so he could offer Malfoy specialized service.
“Tasty, too.” Draco tapped a finger against his lip, apparently wavering on whether or not to continue. “I love a good gin cocktail, especially when they have such a rich history.
. It’s them, together, and it’s too much all at once. Harry comes with a cry against his mouth, sticky and pulsating between them, arse fluttering and clamping down, wrenching Draco over the edge as his thrusts slow to a near imperceptible pace as he spills into him, before stilling completely. He exhales softly, closing his eyes as he settles against Harry’s forehead, noses brushing, attempting to swallow down his heartache while he waits for his heartbeat to regain its natural tempo.
But one singular thought circles, bouncing around his skull and skittering back to the forefront of his mind as he stares, slightly open mouthed and shocked.
Draco unbuttons the collared shirt, remnants of smoke and ash and magic streaking against its bright white, his mouth following to brush against every inch of skin as its revealed - biting against the unblemished areas, helpless to the want of leaving his own mark, kissing each scar fervently, doing his best to heal everything that’s come before. He knows it won’t, but it doesn't stop his foolish longing, his need to be the one that can make Harry feel
Malfoy looked delighted, reaching for a glass and immediately taking a sip, lips smacking slightly as he held the drink up to the light for further examination.
Draco’s responding groan is muffled against Harry’s body, a hand desperately reaching down to squeeze the base of his own cock at the rush of wild desire burning through him. He doesn’t want this to end before it’s even really
expect anything to change. This is the reality of them, and what they’ve done: him at home, bones chilled, soul shattered, left wrecked and emotionally drained. Harry at home, with Ginevra, warming his palms with a fresh cup of tea and a peck to his stubbled cheek, excuses of late nights at work getting the better of him these days.
, he lifts his hips briefly, letting himself lose this last layer, baring himself to Draco at last. Hands trembling slightly as they rest themselves back at Harry’s hips, fingertips tracing the sharp jut of bones and muscle, Draco takes a shuddering breath against Harry’s skin.
He was sure there were more reasons why his fingers should stop twitching, though those reasons seemed to be vanishing with each new button that opened. The shirt fell open, hanging off Malfoy’s lithe shoulders, revealing a trail of sandy blond hair dipping below the waistband of his trousers. Harry watched as a lone droplet of the gin and tonic slowly made its way down Malfoy’s throat, clung into his navel, and crawled past a sharp hip bone. He couldn’t help his tongue darting out to swipe across his lower lip, utterly enthralled and somehow jealous of that droplet. He wanted to be the one sweeping across Malfoy’s body. He wanted-
A small smile curved against Malfoy’s lips as he dipped his head, a curtain of hair falling from behind his ear, his round silver spectacles glinting. Harry hadn’t noticed those before.
you. To ask about it.” Draco cleared his throat again, a blush stealing across his neck and pinking his cheeks. “To be my partner, I mean.”
The front glass was foggy and caked with dust, portions of the windows covered with plywood where vagrants had obviously broken in at some point. The hanging sign above the door hung at a frightful angle, poised to drop on any unsuspecting pedestrian. It was in rough shape, clearly having been left sitting for quite some time, but Harry could see it. The potential. The space for creating some good in this world with his own hands. The ability to cultivate a little slice of peace for himself.
Harry stared blankly, entirely consumed by the vision in front of him, as Malfoy’s long fingers slowly unbuttoned his shirt, pale porcelain skin revealing itself by the second.
Malfoy tugged the bottom of the shirt down, a final sliver of skin being hidden away beneath the dark maroon fabric. Harry admired the way the Seven Spirits logo stretched over his body. The white vinyl letters made the fabric bunch and pucker over his chest, and a nipple peeked out from behind an S as Malfoy sighed. Malfoy ruffled his fingers through his hair absentmindedly. Harry’s fingers itched to reach out and touch him, to tug him closer, to run his hands over those now hidden muscles, and Malfoy would lean into him, perhaps eagerly undress him and tug that blasted t-shirt back off and-
Harry sighed and wiped down another table as he readied the bar for closing. There were still a few patrons hanging out at a single table in a darkened corner, regulars who wouldn’t mind him cleaning up while they chatted quietly until closing time. Harry tossed the damp rag over his shoulder, forgetting he wasn’t wearing his usual t-shirt until it began to soak through the cotton as he began putting the stools up on the bar top.
It always started like this: bright lights flashing, spells arcing overhead, the thick smoke of magic and ozone coating the back of his tongue. There’s a close call. Shields gone awry, their team’s bodies misplaced in the field. Draco is hit with a strike to the shoulder, or chest, or knee. Always followed by racing hearts, a rush of blood to the head, the slight daze of a mission gone wrong numbing his mind before the sharp tug of apparition spins him away back to his flat.
Serving them was easy, which was almost entirely his incentive in having them on the menu. But they were also unique; a suspended drink that burst on the tongue, the slightly fruity taste of the light-bodied rum a perfect compliment to the tang of lime, the sprig of mint bringing a hint of freshness and a cool sensation, especially when coupled with the fizz of the club soda.
He felt his breath hitch, his heart a steady rushing beat in his chest, his fingers clutching desperately at his sides to prevent himself from reaching out to touch. Because that would certainly be unprofessional, and not welcomed, and... and... and….
, encounters the bare tawny skin that haunts him. Too soon, and Harry will realize just how much Draco wants this, will turn tail and run, will leave him wanting and waiting. So Draco busies himself with bruising Harry’s lips, baring his skin, distracting him from the thoughts that can tumble down
A tapping at the window breaks Draco from his reverie, starting slightly as Harry mutters something under his breath that sounds suspiciously like
“I’m not, though I do pride myself on having a refined palette. Thanks for the drink, Potter. And the shirt.”
Malfoy turned to face him, letting out a harsh bark of laughter before he could contain himself. He primly folded his napkin, set it back on the table, and downed the rest of his drink in a single gulp and stood up.
But Harry just kisses him, soft and delicate, and heartbreakingly tender. It’s an antithesis to their previous kiss, as if working to undo the hurt that Harry knows he’s bestowing upon them. Because he knows. He knows, he knows,
Harry stood behind the polished mahogany bar, a rag in one hand and a crystal tumbler in the other. It was a typical Friday night at the Seven Spirits, busy and buzzing with the conversations around him, the ting of glass ringing throughout his pub. He sighed with a content curl of his lips, placing a tumbler back in its rightful place. He turned to grab another from the frothy soap-filled basin, preferring the clean feel of washing by hand and the lull of the monotonous task cutting up his night. A flash of pale white blond caught his eye near the doorway, stopping him in his tracks as Harry's eyes narrowed in on the person who had just entered his pub.
Harry slowly broke down the bar, pulling the pour spouts off bottles, replacing caps, cleaning up and refilling the garnish bar before casting a
Draco nods wordlessly, kissing Harry again, letting him take up his needle and thread. Knowing that next time his heart needs stitching, when the seams won’t hold, when he feels fit to burst under his past and his shadows and his shame, that Harry will be there to sew him up again.
Harry couldn’t stop his answering grin, jerking his head towards the doors and leading them back out to the bar.
Harry caught himself staring at Malfoy’s pursed lips and tugged his gaze away from Malfoy’s tongue swiping away the wayward droplets.
By the time he’d gotten to the table, though, Malfoy was already thoroughly reprimanding the stranger, lips moving frightfully quick under the cover of a silencing charm, chest and neck flushed with a barely-contained vexation that sparked at the tips of his platinum locks.
“Well, this was a pleasant experience, gentlemen. Potter, I can genuinely say that cocktail was an absolute treat. I dare say I’ll be back. Draco was right when he argued this was the best bar in London.” Pansy sifted through her clutch, finally finding a tube of lippy and settling back into her seat to reapply it, popping her lips and placing it back in her clutch with a snap.
It hurts more than he thought it would, the anguish searing sharp through Draco’s bones, burning his blood, and he sobs with relief and despair. He knows that, for him, these stolen moments so few and far between, will never be enough. That he will never be replete of him.
It’s not what he expected. In fact, it’s in direct opposition of what he expects it to say. He anticipated that if and when this moment came, that he would be filleted by the fiendfyre of her rage, drawn and quartered by her words, gutted by the consequences of their actions. Eaten alive by the guilt of watching Harry choose her with a finality that would crush him wholeheartedly.
The man was easily twice their age, portund, with an awful silent film villain mustache that he continually curled up at the edges with his fingertips. He was
“Well, you do seem to enjoy the drinks. You’ve been back every week for months.” Harry turned to drop some champagne flutes into the soapy sink behind him, gleefully looking back over his shoulder at the pair of Slytherins. Pansy hid a laugh behind her hand, amused at Draco’s antics.
It gave him something to do with his hands and filled his evenings, keeping his heart full of newfound passion and endless conversations with his regulars. He had plenty of time to himself during the day, which is what he’d said when Hermione had brought it up. He had time to cook for himself, to have lunches with Teddy, to attend to appointments or any other life responsibilities that might crop up. He was
He was well-dressed, had a nice, long frame, and pretty blond hair. A handsome face, if not particularly soft or kind-looking. It made sense that he’d have a long line of suitors knocking at his door. Even with his murky history, he still came from old money, and he was good-looking, maybe even
Malfoy smothered a laugh, a hand coming up to perch under his chin as he watched the process avidly.
it all. Every little moment, every slip of his memory. He was wrong. But he still didn’t know how, in what way, or what he could possibly be expected to do
He'd put in an offer on the property immediately. The cash transferred from his Gringotts vault that same week, and he had the keys in hand a mere 9 days later. It took a few months longer to get it into any semblance of a business, fit for food or patrons alike. But he'd done it, and he relished in the feeling of his bones settling in at the end of a long day.
between them. His eyes flutter shut, letting Draco’s length fill his mouth. Draco’s head dips forward, eyes heavy-lidded, watching Harry’s lips redden and pull taut. A hum of pleasure vibrates Harry’s throat against the sensitive head of his cock as a soft exhale rushes out of him. Draco lets his fingers find the curled ends of Harry’s hair, tugging them slightly as his head starts to slowly move over him, soaking up the wet, hot heat of his mouth, the tension building in his belly flaring bright with his need.
Harry’s hands find their way to his face, cupping his cheeks as his thumbs sweep gently beneath his eyes.
A second man entered through the door, shaking out his dark curls as Harry casually grabbed another tumbler. Malfoy turned suddenly from the reception podium to greet him with a wide smile, perfect teeth flashing as his hair cascaded behind his shoulders.
“Uh, I think you’ll like this one,” Harry murmured, desperate for a way to cut the tension and gave in to his own version of
Draco’s ears turned scarlet as he tugged at the collar of his shirt, gaping at Pansy with his mouth opening and closing repeatedly, a noise of dismay slipping out.
Harry paused, feeling the shaker cool to the touch, the slight beginnings of condensation coating the outside. He quickly set it back on the bar top and unseated the shaker. He placed the strainer over the top of the glass, smiling slightly as an ethereal fog revealed itself as the drink was poured into the glass.
. Harry would usually roll his eyes, putting it down as just another posh prat with too many opinions. Like so many of the others that seemed to be drawn to his pub.
Harry’s main goal, other than running a successful bar and supporting himself doing something he loved, was
Harry scrambled to regain movement of his limbs, suddenly stuck frozen. He didn’t want to appear overly eager, and especially didn’t want to be seen
Sirius lets out a snort of laughter and finally tears his eyes away from the thestral and smirks down at Harry.
”Yeah…” Hagrid nods to him. ”Yeah, I knew yeh’d be able ter, Harry… An’ you too, Neville, eh? An’ —”
Draco seems to deliberate with himself, and swallows thickly as he scans the spread of food in front him on the table. He then reaches out and grabs the ladle of the nearest pot with a slightly trembling hand and then scoops up a couple of potatoes to add to his plate.
”I normally open the ones from friends and… well, you… here, and save the ones from my dads for later and we normally open our presents together in the living room.”
”Yes”, Malfoy croaks out again, a little louder. ”I only found out by accident, a house elf came to warn me, just before dinner… I only had minutes, I didn’t know what to do, but the elf, she helped me… she grabbed me and Disapparated. The next thing I knew, I was standing outside the gates of Hogwarts. I guess she thought I would be safe there, but… it’s locked, no-one’s there… so I walked into Hogsmeade and…”
He stumbles on a wide, shallow sand pit with weird contraptions secured to the ground and it looks vaguely familiar. He knows he’s never been in Little Whinging before, so it can’t be this exact place that is familiar to him. But he’s sure he’s seen these types of contraptions before.
”Yeah…” he says, blinking the memory away and smiling. ”You know, I just might. I have a space for one right here…”
It thrashes its horned head nervously and paws the snowy ground with its golden hooves as they approach.
As soon as Harry and Draco have put their trunks in the bedroom, Remus ushers them both into the kitchen and starts pushing chocolatey things at them while Sirius carries out a mild interrogation about life at Hogwarts. He’s especially keen to hear about Slughorn’s Christmas party, laughing heartily at the mental image of a very uncomfortable Severus Snape surrounded by tipsy people having a good time.
The empty sensation lifts from Harry’s mind and the pain in his knees and back are doubled. He’s lying on his back on top of the overturned desk, and realises he must have jumped after all — except, since he’d tried to resist the impulse the whole time, he must have ended up simply charging the desk head on, knocking it over and falling on top of it — which would explain the severe pain in both his legs and back.
He said hello to Millicent at some point in first year, but only recieved a suspiscious glare back and since then he’s avoided the girl as much as possible. Come to think of it, he’s avoided all contact with Crabbe and Goyle as well, ever since the two of them accompanied Draco to his and Ron’s carriage on the Hogwarts Express and tried to pick a fight. Of course, he should have forgiven the two boys for this the minute he forgave Draco, especially considering they were probably just doing what the blonde told them to do, but for some reason Harry has never really felt the same need for a clean slate with Crabbe and Goyle…
”No…” Harry says and sighs in disappointment. ”He’s in the Gold series… Do you want mine? It’s a Dragon card.”
Harry feels the spell burrow into his mind and when Professor Snape and the office begins to flicker out focus, instead of panicking he focuses on his deep breathing, just like his relaxation exercises, and allows himself to be filled with a sense of calm…
Everyone but Seamus chuckle at that and then the conversation tapers off. Remus returns to his book and Harry slumps against him and dozes off until the Trolley Witch appears outside the compartment door. Remus waits for Harry to lean back before he gets up and buys them a Chocolate Frog each.
Once everyone has walked inside the castle and filed into the Great Hall, the Hogwarts students take their seats at their respective House tables and Ravenclaw join the Beauxbatons students who apparently chose their table to sit at while the rest of them were still waiting outside. They still seem to be shivering, despite having been inside for a good half hour by now and a few of them have even wrapped frilly scarves around their shoulders and heads.
”Sorry!” Pansy and Draco calls out, then Draco turns back to Harry with a grin. ”But I believe I’ve made my point…”
”I… don’t know…” Harry mumbles and shrugs uncomfortably. ”Just felt like some pumpkin juice… No big deal…”
”Daddy… Did you…? Is that you?” he points to the map. ”It says Moony… Are you one of the Marauders?”
”Lovely”, Umbridge says and conjures up the cup of coffee once more, gripping it delicately by the saucer.
The blonde favours him with a lingering, withered look and then spins on his heel and strides over to his own bed and slumps down on it. For a brief moment, Harry tenses with the impulse to follow him. But the warning glare Malfoy sends him tells him to stay put.
A dozen small groups of Slytherins are spread out across the Common Room, pockets of social hubs of various ages that are scattered around the room. Some are just chatting, some are playing games. There are also one or two individuals not part of any of the groups, just reading to themselves. Harry can see Malfoy across the room, reading to himself but still part of the group of friends that Harry had also been part of this past week.
”Just because you’re so jealous you can’t stand the idea of Harry not being in love with you for the t
Harry lets out a pained groan and Remus gingerly sits down on the sofa next to the armchair and gives him a patient and compassionate look while he listens to him.
”Gryffindor hasn’t lost the House Cup in years”, Granger intones in explanation, her tone a bit bored but even so, there is a glint of pride in her eyes as she says it.
, full stop”, Pansy cuts in and nods towards Draco. ”I thought maybe your parents finally got her sacked…”
”Sorry, I’ll let you get back to your studies… I just read that article in the Prophet this morning and I just had to say something!”
They all hurry across the courtyard and down the grassy slope towards Hagrid’s hut and paddock, where Professor Grubbly-Plank is waiting for them next to the trestle table where their Bowtruckles are gathered, munching on woodlice.
Remus nods calmly, but his eyes bores into Harry and it feels like he can read his every thought… unable to maintain the eye-lock anymore, Harry looks down at his toast finally.
the peeling gold letters above the door to the narrow wand shop says. As they step inside, a tinkling bell can be heard from deep within the shop. Remus gives Harry an encouraging smile, before he takes a seat on the single spindly chair in the middle of the floor.
”Boys…” Narcissa says, stopping them in their tracks. ”Make sure to be back here for lunch in an hour. Draco, I’m serious… You didn’t have any breakfast, don’t think I’ve forgotten.”
It’s by far the worst detention yet. When Harry is finishing up the fourth line, the words are already cut deeply into his skin and he’s bleeding freely down the side of his hand, spattering both the parchment and the lace table cloth, that are steadily becoming a morbid dot work of blood drops.
Draco looks so relieved, Harry almost thinks he might start crying but he just releases a big breath and shoots Harry an apologetic look.
His first birthday party! Well, with other kids, at least. One or two times when Harry was younger they’d have guests over for this birthday, but it was always friends or colleagues of his dads and never any other children, because his dads didn’t really know anyone with children Harry’s age and there weren’t any in the area where they lived either, so he never really had friends before he started Hogwarts.
, though, Harry. I don’t know where you got that from, but I love drawing way more than I love flying. In fact, I love flying more than I enjoy the game of quidditch itself—”
It was odd trudging past the Common Room to the Potions classroom and be greeted by new Professor Slughorn rather than Professor Snape, whom Harry had come to associate so strongly with the candle-lit gloom and haze of potions to found inside the classroom, that it might as well be an extension of his long, black robes.
No-one speaks for a long time and the atmosphere of the room continues to cool until Harry almost expects to see everyone’s breath start to fog.
First there is the matter of logistics, with Madam Maxime being so much taller than everyone else she seem to cast at least half of the others into shadow whereever she stands and also there isn’t enough space in the classroom to allow the photographer to back far enough away to get all of her in the shot. Finally, they decide to have her seated in the middle of the shot, with everyone else standing around her.
and curls up on top of his bed, hugging one of his pillows to his chest as he closes his eyes and thinks back… a rush of images erupts inside his mind and he remembers hearing voices, howling voices but filtered as though he’d heard them from below the surface of the water in the lake… none of it makes any sense to Harry, but he remembers feeling a surge of pure rage when the pain shot through his head and
“Yes, that sounds about right,” a soft chuckle escaped him, before he tapped the menu with a well-manicured finger, giving Harry a considering look and seemingly changing his mind at the last second, “Can I get two of these Galaxy Highballs?”
Draco fights down his own desire, his rush, drowning in Harry, wanting to take his time with him, to relish in this as much as he can. He gently pushes Harry back, dropping down to his knees as he deftly unbuttons Harry’s trousers, tugging them down as Harry finally falls back on the bed. Draco’s hands move without thought, reverently brushing from ankle to thigh as he dips his head again to place soft, teasing kisses along Harry’s legs, eyeing the tented pants as Harry’s gasps sound out against the silent room.
Harry laughed under his breath, charmed by Draco despite the awkward tension Pansy had fostered with her drink orders. Reaching under the counter, he grabbed the tray of prepped spheres, casually swiping away the
than just fucking. To me, anyway.” Harry’s tongue darts out, swiping against his lower lip, his eyes dropping to Draco’s mouth. “I didn’t realize you felt the same.”
Draco slapped a palm on the bar top, excitement and the liquor increasing his volume as he laughed in delight.
Harry watched open-mouthed, words lingering at the back of his tongue, as Draco made his way through the busy pub and out the front door without a backward glance.
charm. He grabbed four silver spoons from the tray, admiring their glossy appearance and the pretty sprigs of mint that had been inlaid before solidifying.
Draco scrubs a hand across his face before throwing the duvet off, ruffling his hair absent-mindedly. He makes his way across the room to the loo, but freezes on the threshold as he hears an unfamiliar clanking and hushed cursing coming from down the hall. Sticking a hand out, he wordlessly summons his silk dressing gown, slipping it on over his shoulders and tying it haphazardly. It would not do to be taken out by intruders completely starkers, after all.
Harry smiled, suddenly feeling exposed with his chest bared, crossing his arms briefly before deciding to stuff his hands in his pockets, rocking slightly on his heels.
He placed the spoons in a semi-circle across the crisp white plate, carefully arranging them around a fresh bundle of mint leaves, and swirled a curl of his house-made coconut lime reduction with a flourish to finish off the plate.
