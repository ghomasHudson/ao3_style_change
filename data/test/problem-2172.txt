Hermione quickly agrees, and they leave the classroom. When they get to the great hall, Harry scans the Slytherin table and feels his heart leap when he doesn’t see Malfoy’s blond hair, dear god what if him and Ron are dueling it out on the lawn?
Draco nods, seemingly content with this answer. “Do you want to grab lunch at the Leaky Cauldron or something before we head back?”
Draco snorts, “You’ve given this a fair amount of thought?” He twists his fingers in Harry’s belt loops, looking down at him with a sheepish grin.
I mean for Christ sake, the hand on his thigh feels like a bloody brand and his skin feels hot all over. If this is how he reacts to casual touch how is supposed to make it through the next week with the newfound knowledge of his attraction?
“Oh. Hi mate.” Harry says, not really certain of how to talk to Ron or Hermione as he hasn’t really spoken to them since the intervention.
Harry looks quickly at Malfoy whose gaze is already settled on him. Harry isn’t sure why, but he suddenly wishes that Ron wasn’t there so he could finish talking with Malfoy.
A very disheveled Draco Malfoy is standing in his kitchen, tie loosened around his neck, hair looking like it’s been tugged and pulled. It’s an entertaining sight.
Harry showers quickly and dresses in the clothing Draco had given him and hurriedly pulls on his coat and boots when seeing Draco sitting patiently on the couch with a fully dressed Teddy.
Ron sits beside her while saying, “They somehow have pictures of you two from more than just St. Mungos.”
Harry smiles stiffly and crosses the room to shake the two older boys’ hands, “Alright Bill? Charlie?”
His dark hair is messy, and he’s paler than he was during the summer. The cold and lack of sun finally taking a toll on his tanned skin. He’s a bit bulkier than he was in school, having put on some muscle during his auror training, but he still has a relatively thin build. His glasses sit crooked on his nose, which Draco privately thinks is his fault from when he broke it in sixth year. His eyes are beautiful. The last rays of sun hit them and pick up on the gold littered throughout them. Draco could spend forever looking at his eyes.
Draco also clearly likes this poem and has highlighted a few of his favorite verses. Harry pays more attention to those, his eyes catching on one that simply says “Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song.” Harry isn’t sure of the context, but likes it anyways. He supposes that the Thames would keep flowing forever. History would not change that, and nothing as silly as a war fought by humans could deter the river from doing what it is meant to do.
Malfoy scoffs as Harry stands up to get a washcloth for Teddy. Harry looks back at him but Malfoy is busy looking at Teddy. Teddy is looking right back and starts giggling for no apparent reason. Malfoy’s mouth twitches up in one corner and he raises his hand for Teddy to grab on to. Teddy complies and Malfoy is stuck with a baby holding his hand and covering it in what Harry has determined is squash baby food.
“Okay, fine.” Harry says, adjusting the blanket so it’s more fully on him and waiting for Draco to join him back on the couch.
Harry turns to look in the direction Malfoy is pointing, and the memory floods his head. A smile cracks across his face. That had been a perfect thing to happen. And just like that he’s back in his own mind. Malfoy seems to know this and steps so that he’s beside him again. Their shoulders are touching, but Harry doesn’t make any move to step away from him. He needs the support. Without giving himself a second to reenter the headspace that he was just in, Harry starts forward with Malfoy to enter the great hall.
His dreams were never this delightful, never giving this type of comfort or any type of comfort whatsoever.
PPPPPS: I've started a new fanfiction in the Haikyuu fandom. If you're interested, you can check it out ;D It's Kagehina (Kageyama Tobio/Hinata Shouyou) It's called "Don't Make Me Walk When I Want To Fly" It's a Time Loop fic ;D
Draco felt shivers running down his spine, hearing the same words he’s heard from Fred. It struck his heart, his head, his
He had a strange look in his eyes. It was that look in them again. That look Draco could never put anywhere.
“Oh, that’s phenomenal! He’s gotten back his first in command.” Professor Snape said with a little venom. “He has a Fiendfyre Consumer, well that’s just absolutely–”
Cedric’s grey eyes snapped to Neville’s. There was something animalistic in his movement – he was completely still, only his eyes were moving, looking around the room, as if he was measuring how much danger he was really in, in that moment.
Draco looks to the corner, finding that Robards is sitting on an armchair, shamelessly reading the book he has stolen from Draco’s library.
“But still, they could’ve torture me. Kidnap me. Kill me, even. They had more people than I did. The only ones I had was weaklings anyway– my apologize, sir.” He stared at his boss with an apologetic look who waved his hand. “Instead they escaped. They saved their own skin, which is not a surprise but when I was reporting to it Kingsley, I thought about it more, and something was off.” He looked at him with grim eyes. “You remember when I told you that he was weird? How he had known my every single movement?” Neville stopped a minute. “What if he had?”
Draco lets go of the handle, then turns to her and sits down on the bed, reaching out to hold her hand. Millicent smiles and strokes the back of Draco’s hand with her thumb.
“Memorize the enchantment, Mr. Potter,” Aberforth said at the very last moment before they closed the front, two winged door behind themselves.
Harry sits up on the edge of the bed, and when Draco steps towards him, draws him close by pulling him in by his waist.
Before Malfoy has a chance to answer someone clears their throat behind them. Instantly both Harry and Malfoy have wands in their hands and are pointing them at the person behind them.
Ron’s voice has a protective edge to it, one that he knew wouldn’t go over well with Hermione. She’s many things, but she isn’t someone who needs to be defended.
“Why?” Neville asks looking lost, “Why would you date that arsehole? Of all the people you could have had- you were literally dating Ginny! Why him?”
There’s nothing but silence for a moment, but right before he falls asleep for real he hears, “I like you a lot too, Harry.”
“Hey Hermione, what’s up?” Harry says, shifting his phone to his other ear while he holds his hand out to grab Malfoy’s bag.
Sitting in a little carpeted waiting room in a wing in St. Mungos the following morning, Harry wonders if he’s made the right decision. His hands are sweating and he’s alone. Dressed in a rumpled jumper, that he’s pretty sure belongs to Draco, he wanted to avoid attention.
Malfoy shrugs, uninterested in the mystery of Hermione’s abrupt departure, but Harry can’t get that mischievous look out of his head, or figure out the reason behind it.
Malfoy looks down at his laptop in aggravation and looks for all intents and purposes like he is going to keep on working and ignore Harry altogether. Harry slowly slides his hand across the table and pushes Malfoy’s laptop shut. The lights along the side dim and shut off. Huffing in frustration, Malfoy looks up again, eyes wide.
“Hmm.” Draco says, clearly thinking. The silence stretches on for a longer amount of time but is again broken by Draco. “They seemed to take the news well.”
This room often features in Harry’s dreams. He wakes up in a cold sweat, the sounds of Hermione’s screams echoing in his ears, the word mudblood carved into her pale forearm, dripping blood.
Now, it’s completely pointless for Harry to attend these training sessions. The instructor had said it himself on the first day of class, chuckling like it was some great joke, that he was Harry Potter. And that meant that he certainly didn’t need to be here.
They head out of the apartment, both double checking the spells that keep everyone out, and double checking their pockets for phones and wallets.
“Potter,” Malfoy sneers, his fine brows tugging together at the centre “What the hell are you doing here?”
“Wait,” says Harry waving the Barista off when she asks what he wants. “Is that a yes to living together?”
Startled by Malfoy’s abrupt change in attitude, Harry hurries to pack up his things. On their way out of the library Madam Pince glares in their direction. Harry sighs and sidles up closer to Malfoy’s side.
Harry wakes up the next morning to an empty bed. He slides his hand across the place that Malfoy had been last night and finds it cold. Confused, he sits up listening for either noises from Malfoy or from Teddy. He hears nothing, so he gets up to go and investigate.
“A big deal has already been made.” Ron says, laughing, “You two were ridiculous, it’s only fair that Hermione and I get to tease you about it now.”
Harry cuts him off abruptly not in the mood to hear Malfoy explain how worried he was, it would only get his hopes up that Malfoy cares in a more than platonic way.
“Master Malfoy,” she drops into a rushed curtsy, “Tilly offers her most greatest apologies, I has not heard of your arriving any time soon.”
“Anyways, I left the manor at night when no one would be looking for me and went about looking for wizard flats. No one wanted to rent to me because of who I am so I ended up here.”
The next morning, Harry wakes up to the sound of a phone ringing incessantly. He cracks one eye open and immediately regrets it with how bright the room is.
Harry scoffs and watches Draco riffle through his dresser and wardrobe, but makes no move to get up himself.
Being stuck inside should feel like a punishment, but Harry doesn’t mind being with Draco non-stop. There really isn’t anyone else he’d rather be with.
Malfoy’s body is tense but he slowly raises his arms to hug Andromeda back. After a few more seconds the hug breaks and Malfoy steps back to Harry’s side and presses his shoulder against his.
Harry thinks for a moment before grabbing a spare bit of parchment and quill from his bag and scrawling out a response that he’d love to watch Teddy, and would it be okay if the babysitting happened at his apartment. He asks a nearby person to borrow the school owl that had just dropped off the mail and then sends it on it’s way.
It wouldn’t even be that they’re both boys, people didn’t even bat an eye when Dean and Seamus showed up as a couple to Hermione’s birthday together. It would be that fact that the savior of the wizarding world was cuddling under the comforters with an ex death eater. The headlines that Rita Skeeter would write would be hilarious, and he knows that Malfoy would likely handle it all with a sneer and fake confidence.
“Alright thanks, Potter.” Malfoy says, squeezing Harry’s hand slightly and knocking his shoulder against Harry’s before retiring to their usual chairs at the back of the shop.
The wrappings and Christmas tree are quickly forgotten, the two boys kiss messily and gravitate back towards the bed. Though neither one says it, Harry is fairly certain that this is the best Christmas he’s ever had.
Ron smiles slightly and rubs the sleep out of his eyes. He looks like he’d gotten off to a slow start this morning too. They walk in comfortable silence, and head to the ministry Auror training center together.
Harry looks at Draco and realizes that he is absolutely correct. He might be willing to forgive and move past everything that Draco and his family have done, but it’s unfair to expect the Weasley's to do the same right off the bat.
Harry nods at this and glances at Malfoy out of the corner of his eye. Malfoy seems uninterested in the whole conversation as is picking at his nail beds.
Harry is startled by the buzz of the tattoo gun and jerks over to see new ink forming on Malfoy’s pale skin. His hand tightens slightly around Harry’s, but he remains silent and calm.
Luna just nods and says, “Anytime Draco. Anyways, I have another client coming in, so I have to go. But I’ll see you next weekend Harry, and I hope to see you again soon Draco.”
When he reaches the hallway, he dials Blaise’s number. It rings for a while before a groggy voice answers.
Maybe he smeared pasta on Malfoy’s shoulder when he pushed him, maybe that was what the amused expression was for. He looks over at Malfoy, but he doesn’t seem the least bit confused. Sitting at the table eating his macaroni, with the same vigor he ate Harry’s homemade breakfast.
It’s a pointless endeavor, because as soon as Harry exits the bathroom he makes a beeline for Draco and stands between his legs, smoothing his fingers through his hair. It’s soothing.
He has absolutely no idea how his life got to this point. He had been quite happy living an outcast’s life in muggle London with no contact beside the occasional nagging conversation with Granger.
When he thinks of Malfoy it doesn’t feel calm or familiar, it feels like he is stepping onto the quidditch pitch for the first time. Loud nerves, adrenaline and enthusiasm, but most of all a wild race in his heart whenever he thinks about it.
Harry knew Draco was joking, but had decided to follow the other boy’s rules for the time being. Harry holds the wrapped gifts in his lap hesitatingly as Draco enters the room from the kitchen and steps onto the couch before sitting down as close to in Harry’s lap as he can get.
Malfoy seems slightly stunned by this response but doesn’t say anything as he sets his bag down. Harry watches this all happen and desperately wants to talk to him but knows that now is not the time.
Harry nods and rubs his unoccupied hand across his face. Teddy wakes suddenly and his hair changes from brown to a pale pale blonde.
Malfoy turns around with Teddy in his arms “Okay I’ll wait for you here, you run and give it to her. She and Longbottom couldn’t have gotten very far yet.”
He steps forward to grab Draco’s hand but is intercepted by Narcissa. Surprisingly, she pulls him in for a hug, but Harry soon realizes it was an excuse to whisper in his ear, quick and vicious, “You better mean what you said and be prepared to stand with him when the time comes.”
Draco looks at him for a moment before smiling slightly, a mere quirk of the lips. “Come on, Potter. I have something planned.”
For the first time Draco looks nervous, unsure. “I’m going to get my dark mark covered up and I thought maybe you might like to come with me and get your own tattoo, something meaningful. I’ve reserved an appointment for the two of us and I’d like to do this for you as a gift.”
Ron’s eyes are glazed over as he listens to the monotone voice of the guest speaker, but they quickly focused on Harry when Ron catches sight of his intense gaze and processes what Harry had just said.
Teddy gurgles back, his eyes shifting to match Harry’s green. Harry smiles and pulls him back down to his chest and catches Malfoy looking at him shocked.
Malfoy has discarded the gel he so often uses in his hair and right now it’s hanging down his forehead and is thoroughly messed from Harry pulling his fingers through it. Harry pulls back to fully look at and admire Malfoy the way he’s always wanted to.
And worst of all, the ridiculous comment came out sounding like a sexual innuendo! He isn’t trying to make it sexual (not unless Harry starts it)! His mind is just a sea of awkward stammering. Thank god Harry is the least observant bloke he knows and picks up on literally nothing.
“That’s a fairly large window mate, and we don’t know where you’ve been. You could’ve been kidnapped for all we knew.”
He’s been having a hell of a time with one of his essays. It’s supposed to be a comparison between two healing potions, but he keeps misspelling their names. He's begged Hermione to write his thesis for him but she insists that she had too much work to mark from Flitwick’s class. Harry then turns to Draco and pleads for him to help him. It turns out that now that him and Draco are dating he has far more tools at his disposal (Malfoy will agree to almost anything if Harry gives him cuddles and agrees to sneak them out to the quidditch pitch under his cloak).
that is apparently famous for their fancy quills. Draco comes alive in the book store, it’s no wonder. If the piles of books scattered around his flat are any indication, Malfoy is a total geek.
Harry snorts, “I don’t think so Draco. Teddy’s barely eating solid food, I doubt he could handle a sherbert lemon.”
She asked him how he was, and Harry honestly has no idea what he said, but whatever it was caused a flash of alarm to cross her face before a more determined look replaced it and she was at his side.
“Because he’s the one who convinced me to come back to Hogwarts. I’ve been hanging out with him for close to a month.”
Harry calls for the end of practice and sends his team to the showers, saying that they’ll discuss his notes next practice.
“Hey love,” Harry starts waiting for Draco to hum that he was listening, “I was thinking we could do an interview after our tattoo appointment?”
What, and he could not stress this enough, the fuck. He is Draco Malfoy. He writes fucking songs about how much Weasley sucks and has the whole school singing them, yet when the boy he likes is nice to him he is reduced to the bumbling moron of his nightmares.
Draco is holding Teddy when they enter the house and although most people continue talking as if they don’t notice the boys’s entrance, a few eyes lock in on Teddy and soon enough Draco is surrounded by a circle of cooing people. Harry sees Draco look anxiously in his direction, so he slips in by his side and hooks a finger through Draco’s belt loop.
It's the only possible explanation for why he agreed to let this thing with Harry continue. Why on earth would he torture himself more than he already has? Just so he can fool around with a boy who isn’t even sure if he likes boys?
“Well Harry, I must get to work on supper.” Molly says finally, breaking the silence and the horrible airless spell in one go. “Are you sure you won’t stay dear?”
“‘Shit.” He mutters, before looking anxiously at Harry, “Let’s go before the waiter tries to take our order.”
“Come on Potter. We are not wasting the day in bed. We have homework to finish and Quidditch practices to plan for tonight.”
Malfoy laughs and gets up to go to the washroom, leaving Harry to think about what he wants more. To be an Auror or to go back home to Hogwarts. Being an Auror has been his dream for what seems like forever, but realistically, he already has his accreditation and Hogwarts won’t always be there for him. No matter what Dumbledore had told him all those years ago, Hogwarts can’t always welcome him home. Not if he’s thirty and has three kids. Harry texts Hermione quickly.
Draco shoots and unimpressed look over his bare shoulder, but stumbles into the bathroom without another word.
As Draco says this though, Pavarti, Luna, and a few other girls that Harry doesn’t recognize slip away towards Ginny and George in the corner, leaving Harry and Draco to themselves.
Harry finally looks up after saying all that to look at Draco. He has a moment to register Draco’s mouth hanging open in what appears to be shock, before he’s being aggressively hugged by him.
Harry waits for a second, debating whether or not he should say anything. He’s used to telling people about his nightmares but not since the war ended. But Draco’s looking at him with steady grey eyes, and his knees are pressed unhesitatingly into his thighs. He hadn’t even blinked last night when Harry had pointed his wand at him. Harry realizes that Draco may be strong enough to listen to this without being crushed under the weight, but he wonders if it’s fair to expect him to.
“Well you know dear, I saw Mr. Malfoy here coming in and he’s been so elusive and not around his estate and I just wanted to see if he wanted to have a quick chat.”
The hate and fan mail still make appearances, but Harry and Draco decide to throw them all away. The only people whose opinion matters on their relationship is their own.
“You look amazing.” Harry says, stepping closer to ghost a kiss across his mouth before turning to the wardrobe and pulling out the grey sweater Draco had worn to dinner the other night.
And if you guys have any questions you can find us on tumblr at @andrewminyardenthusiast and @brekkerenthusiast
They kiss until Draco pulls back suddenly and says, “Stop distracting me! I have another present for you, you arse.”
Harry takes a moment to look around while Draco talks to the lady at the front desk. The walls are alternating dark red and black, and absolutely covered in names and messages written in sharpie. Thousands of people who visited the shop had left names and messages in silver and gold ink. It reminds him of the magic sign outside the destroyed house in Godric’s Hollow. Harry steps closer to the wall to read the names, but before he can get very far, Draco is grabbing his hand.
There’s silence on the line for what seems like an eternity but in reality is probably only a few seconds that Ron takes to process what was just said.
The end up walking down the well worn trail to Hogsmead, Draco swinging their linked hands between them. He’s talking about nothing important, perhaps the weather? Harry is listening but the words aren’t processing in his brain. He’s too busy noticing how pretty Draco looks with the sun turning his hair silver, the cold making his cheeks and nose a rosy pink. The blue sky is stunning and clear and frames Draco in a way similar to that of a beautiful painting set to a plain backdrop.
“Although I am delighted to see you Potter, is there a reason that you have decided to visit without announcing yourselves? You do know I only knew you two were here because of the ruckus you caused in the great hall as well as the fact that the broomshed was broken into?”
“We were not ridiculous!” Harry protests, “If anything we were completely rational and normal about it all.”
Draco once again wishes that he knew what Harry was thinking, and that he hadn’t been so careless with his heart.
Neville makes to say something again but Harry cuts in first, “I’m not asking you to like him, he’s a hard person to like, but I am asking that you accept that I’m with him.”
Harry tries to get away, or the conscious part of Harry does, but his movement draws the attention of the creatures. He starts to swim, desperately, frantically. He feels a hand wrap around his ankle and looks down only to see the semi rotten face of Draco looking back at him with glassy, unknowing eyes.
"I'm trying, but I just can't." her husband whined. Try as he might, he wasn't able to flee the scene.
"Yes, it's no big deal. Sorry if I ever lash out you... I don't really mean to." His girlfriend simply said, giving him an apologetic look.
Could have also ended better if it weren't for the fact that they had to share their bedroom with Percy.
Flashes of his good times with Harry infested his brain in a way so vicious that there was nothing in his power that would be able to numb his pain.
"But, they're like my family! I'm sure they wouldn't mind. I know that there's always been a lot of hate between your family and theirs, but hey, it's Christmas." Harry explained, but Draco wasn't convinced just yet.
He tried fire communication, but he never found Harry by the fireplace, it was always someone else or it was empty.
"We were both wrong. But... know that I never thought that our love wasn't worth it, nor have I ever pretended to be in love with you for nefarious purposes." Draco let out in a broken voice.
"What has gotten into you lately, Draco?" Blaise asked his friend, down at the Slytherin table. He must have noticed his enhanced good mood. Plus, the way he kept glancing at the Gryffindor table didn't help.
The commentator for that day was Miss Sivan, who, to everyone's surprise, was a big fan of Quidditch. She was perfect for the job, since she had been a Hufflepuff in her Hogwarts years, so she wouldn't have taken sides.
Harry watched as the two friends rekindled, without saying a word. He didn't buy it one bit, even if Pansy was sobbing her heart out. It seemed to him like she was just acting, so that she'd be back in Draco's grace again, just for convenience. However, he didn't externalize these feelings to his boyfriend.
There it was, forgiveness. Ginny couldn't believe it, Harry had just forgiven her. She let out a long sigh of relief.
Therefore, Harry and Draco went back to their seats, helplessly. They both prayed that they'd finish their work as fast as they could, there was still a chance that they could stop the two girls from doing something unspeakable with the photo that they had just taken. If only there was a quick way to communicate with Ron or Hermione...
She had waited so long for Ginny to finally see the light. She knew that their under-the-mistletoe kiss had moved something inside her, but this time Ginny had taken the initiative and Luna couldn't feel more euphoric.
Draco wondered if he had learnt about his little 'experience' with Jean Jaques. He chose to carry on with his lie, though.
Their last year in Hogwarts had been good, quite calm, but it had felt too weird without their friends.
"Tell you what, don't say sorry to him first. He's the one who has to come forward." His roommate said.
Cohabitation in the Burrow felt completely right as it always had, but , that Summer, it was especially blissful.
"And now," Draco continued. "I'm here, in a place that belongs to muggleborns. Where were you, father? You told me yourself, 'do not come home or we will kill you'."
Draco cried out his name, as each second his member spent inside the hot cave of the other boy's mouth brought him closer to heaven.
"Oh, here you are!" Molly exclaimed as she ran to them. She gave each one of them a quick hug. Normally, she would have been extremely affectionate to them, but in that moment she was too anxious to even think straight. "Come on, it's about to start! Ginny, Hermione, Best Man, come with me, quick!" she said, then she grabbed her daughter and son by the arm and pushed them inside of the tent, hurriedly. Hermione followed them in.
Also, they had to go to France anyway, since the wedding would have taken place in Paris, only two weeks later.
So, it was obvious that something was off with him, at least to those around him. Surely Blaise had informed Pansy of Draco's continuous absence in their dorm, the bastard. There was no chance, though, that they could ever know the truth, unless Granger woke up one day and decided to sing like a bird. No, she wouldn't do this to her best friend, Draco reassured himself.
It was Ginny's birthday, so Hermione had offered her spacious flat that she shared with her husband and son to host the party.
When the exams were finally over, no one really knew if they had passed- well, except for Hermione- but still, they were immensely relieved that it was finally over.
His father knew that he was in a Muggle place at the moment. The howler would have been ruthless. Draco felt panic overrun him.
The other boy nodded frantically. He pressed his body on Draco's backside, causing him to flinch with anticipation. "Oh, yeah..." the blonde whispered. He gripped his hips firmly, then he took his pants and boxers off, exposing the boy's ass to the cool air. His eyes fell on a bottle that had conveniently appeared on the bed, lube. He dipped a finger in its liquid and then slipped it in the other boy's entrance. "Oh, Potter!" Draco cried out. Harry smirked as he added another finger, which made Draco whimper loudly. "Oh! Fuck me!"
Luna's dress was blue and it featured a deep v-neck, its top was sequin-covered and the bottom was a tulle skirt, which was almost as long as the one on the red dress, but its effect made it larger and, to Luna, it made her look like a princess.
Ron looked like he had tears in his eyes. "Ginny," he said, putting his hand on his sister's shoulder, after Hermione had pulled away.
While he was beating himself up for having said horrible things to Draco, while he wouldn't eat or sleep because of how terrible he felt, the boy who once told him he loved him was making out with a French hottie, not even a week after fighting with him.
Harry turned around. "Ginny, I'm so sorry to tell you this, but you need to move on!" He then went back to walking away.
She and her girlfriend had gone on a date at Madam Puddifoot, as it was their month-and-a-half-a-versary, as Luna put it. Ron and Hermione had never had one, although they would have the monthsaversary. Apparently, girls were obsessed with these things.
Draco hesitated at first, but then he took his hand. Both of them stumbled for the lack of balance, but they were able to get on the lake, eventually.
"Actually, that was my mother's idea... She said she's willing to put the past behind now that you're Harry's boyfriend." Ron said. "Although, my dad doesn't know yet..."
"No complaining. You are lucky that you're not going straight to Azkaban. Your wand will be broken in half, now." the Headmistress continued, summoning the girl's wand.
Ginny stopped her girlfriend from taking her wand. "Baby, it's fine, let's just go. He's not worth getting in trouble for."
"Why can't I be lucky with room mates? He's almost worse than Blaise and Goyle, combined." Draco wailed, as he put his head on Harry's shoulder.
Ron and Harry were discussing how the simulation might have gone. "I don't think I got a good mark, Harry." Ron told his best friend. "Bloody witch always grades my works poorly."
Minutes later, Jean Jacques was walking towards the Gryffindors, flashing his brightest smile at the sight of his room mate. "Ah, Dracou! My room mate! Why aren't you at the Slytherenne table?"
"We really need to thank you, guys." Said Dean, referring to himself and Seamus. "Yes, because your courage inspired us to be courageous. " he then squeezed Seamus' hand in his.
Even Draco's birthday was celebrated quietly and quickly -however, Harry promised to do something special in the Summer to make up for it.
That night, at dinner, Harry found himself lost in his thoughts as he looked over at the Slytherin table, where Malfoy sat next to his minions. All he could think of was how close he had been with him, how it seemed like they were going to kiss... He felt something weird in that moment, but he didn't dislike it.
He felt someone climb into bed with him. The next thing he knew, his roommate was lying behind him. Then, an unwanted hand felt him through his pajama pants.
At that, Pansy made a shocked face. "Oh Merlin!" the girl said, sitting closer to her friend. "How were you able to sleep?"
"We can. I will guide everyone myself, Harry entrusted me with this task." Ron responded, showing off a bit of a leader vibe. "It's Harry I'm worried about. Hoping Malfoy won't kill him in there!" He chuckled.
Pansy was growing more and more suspicious. The fact that Draco had not complained supported her theory that something was off with him more and more.
Tbh I never thought anyone would like it, but I was proven wrong. Thank you to everyone who loved it, your support means a lot to me!
"Harry's got a point." Said Ginny. "But if Draco's not bothered by his behaviour anymore... I'm guessing Jean Jaques is a decent guy."
And so Harry told her all about it. Hermione wasn't the least bit surprised. "It was not a girl, but it was Malfoy." she shook her head. "Who is a ton times worse."
It was what he had always dreamed about. A house that looked a lot like his common room at Hogwarts, but it was also quite chic. Plus, it was complete with a "brewing room" that Draco could have used to practice his potion making - his dream career was to become a potionist in Hogwarts. The place even had a small room for Viridis.
"Pff, Mione, you should have seen Ron when you left for New Year's Eve, he wouldn't shut up about how much he missed you! 'Where is Mione Poo, I need my Mione Poo.'" Ginny said, mockingly, coming to Harry's rescue.
"Can we trade, Ginny?" Harry joked, although there was nothing playful in his voice. He would have given anything just to spend another year in the place he called home.
"The way your smile dropped when Ron said the thing about me not being with you for today." said Harry.
"You wouldn't dare divulge it everywhere, Ginny! What happened to that smart girl I knew? This isn't you, Gin!" Harry tried to reason with her.
"Remember, we don't have much time. We also have to find that spare second to say goodbye to the girls." Hermione reminded them.
"Yay, that's awesome! " Ginny cheered, clapping her hands. "Well, I'd say my work here is done! And, since we were able to make this miracle, I guess I win the Hollyhead Harpies."
Luna sighed contentedly when they parted. "Is this the whole of the reward?" she asked, acting disappointed.
At this, Draco laughed so hard that he had tears in his eyes. When he finally stopped laughing, he took a breath. "Oh, aren't you so funny, Pans?" He said, wiping a tear. Draco was genuinely entertained. Oh boy, if she knew who he really liked...
He knew that the jeweler wasn't fond of delivering items by owl and, in addition to it, money to pay for it was in Gringott's.
As the woman spoke, Harry couldn't hear a word of what she was saying. He was too much in trance, looking into those grey eyes that would always hypnotize him.
Ron turned around and looked a him with widened eyes, as he could scarcely believe what he'd just heard.
"Guys... you need to see this." said Hermione. She was holding the new edition of the Daily Prophet in her hand. She showed it to the both of them and they saw that the picture of their kiss was on the front page.
Harry guided Draco as they skated their way towards  one of the shores, where they made their first stop. "Was it that bad?" Harry asked, grinning widely. But when he looked at his boyfriend he couldn't suppress a laugh. Draco showed the angriest death stare ever.
Draco had decided to ignore the fact that the Quiberon Seeker reminded him of someone he hated, so he still went to get his banner signed.
Ugh, that smirk, how he detested it. He scoffed, hoping he wouldn't see through him and know that, yes, he'd expected a kiss. "I would never kiss you."
"I had no doubt." the grey eyed boy said, stroking him faster. Harry arched his back in pleasure, gripping on the sheets. That was it, he was so, so close.
"You were both late for potions and arrived at the same time because you spent the night together, didn't you?" Hermione simply said, not dropping her very, very infuriating smirk.
Her body didn't obey her voice in her head saying 'push her away!', though. She just relaxed into the kiss. When Luna pulled away, she gasped.
"Congratulations, Harry! I knew he would say yes!" a thrilled Hermione squealed, launching herself at her friend and squeezing him tightly.
In the meantime, Luna had taken Ron and Harry to yet another sumptuous looking honeymoon suite, which similar to the other one, except that it had a green tone and it smelled like lime and ginger.
A/N: Just like Adrastea Sivan, Jean Jacques Germain is an OC, and my inspiration for his looks came from Gaspard Uilliel.
After exchanging their rings, Ron kissed Hermione and Harry captured his now husband's lips with his own.
"That you refuse to sleep in my dorm! It's always me who has to break the law in order to see you at night!" Draco let out in a bitter tone.
He couldn't be more excited to start the new year, he was sure that it would be pretty good, if Harry was by his side.
"Here is where an eleven-year-old Draco entered as a spoiled brat and where he left as an enriched person, thanks to some amazing people. Thank you Hogwarts!"
Meanwhile, Ginny was in her bedroom, as her dad had urged everyone to change into their elegant clothes for the 'special fireworks photo of 1999'.
"That spicy ginger is my girlfriend, so stay away!" The blonde girl ran from her position, which was in front of a Harpies Chaser, to the French Captain's desk.
"I was suspecting it, yes." Draco confirmed with a smirk. "I'm sure I was able to visit you in your dreams that night." He teased.
Once Hermione's bushy hair was straight, Ginny tied it into a bun and added a flower hairpin in the middle of it.
"Me too, my love." Draco let slip. The moment he said those words he realized what he had just said. He called Harry my love. What was happening to him? He had never been like this with a person, let alone Harry Potter. Yet, he had said those words. He was really changing and he didn't mind it too much, he found. But he was still quite shocked at his own words.
She had at least four rings on her hands. The light in the room made a ruby on one of her rings shine as she waved her hand to the pair, motioning for them to sit with her.
The writing on the howler read 'Draco Malfoy, Muggle City' and, although there was no sender's name, it was obvious that it was from Lucius.
Then, they both started singing a tune that lacked rhyme. It went like this, "Nargle eggs, nargle eggs! Come to us! So we can fry you!"
"We noticed you two have been acting a bit... too friendly." said Harry, gesturing to the two girls.
Ginny shook her head, grinning from ear to ear. "No, silly. But it's something that I can't give you out here."
No one believed him, he was painted as a calculating person, when he was just trying to prove his innocence.
"Oh, a mistletoe." Luna observed. "Nargles like to infest these. Thank God I have my necklace to keep them away." She said, moving her head excitedly and fidgeting with her butterbeer caps necklace.
When Harry set foot in the Great Hall, the first thing he did was run to his fiancè, who was already standing there next to Luna.
"Harry, you hurt me," Draco began. "You told me all those things, then you completely ignored me for days, simply out of pride."
"And you couldn't resist, huh? Tell you what, meet me at the Room of Requirement tonight at 10 o' clock... I can show you incredible things. But no one must know, or you're dead."
"Wait WHAT? Am I fucking hallucinating or did you just snog freaking Germain? How long has this been going on?" Harry said furiously. He was livid with anger, while hot tears stained his face.
"How can I not cry now?" The big man said, sniffling. "C'mere!" He pulled everyone in a bone crushing hug, including Draco, who could hardly believe what was happening. He had sued that man five years before and had criticised his work as a teacher on many occasions. He must have been very kind-hearted.
Poor Ginny, she was right... He had never been attracted to her. And he may have known why... he was actually gay. Made sense.
Lucius gasped. "This is disrespecting your own blood! You should be ashamed of yourself. Think of mother... she almost fainted upon reading this article!"
There were two rows of chairs; the first one, which was on the left, was golden, while the one on the right was silver.
"Well, I'm not sure he would rejoice, but I guess you could tell him? I mean, if you're planning on keeping it..." The redhead suggested.
The redhead was supposed to be there as a supervisor, making sure that everything would have gone by smoothly.
"Hell, he even had a dream about the bloke, didn't you, Har?" Ron said to his grilfriend, who gasped. "Wow, this is serious.. look, if you're gay... I'm down with it. But if it's with Malfoy... I'm not. He's a prick!"
"I took the potion to prove to you how true my feelings for you are." said Draco. "I need you to hear me out."
"Ow, baby! You know I only have eyes for you, that's just the quarter-veela thing!" Ron defended himself, massaging his cheek.
It was located near a deserted beach. It was concealed from Muggle eyes with a disillusionment  charm, as the stadium would been to big to hide.
He didn't mind the fact that the person showing off the snitch looked exactly like Jean Jacques anymore.
Hermione began to think that maybe Harry had brought up Draco for a reason. Could it be that reason?
"A surprise, yes, but not for them... Um, actually, I want to propose to my boyfriend, while I'm at it." he said, playing idly with the glitter on the table, getting it all over his fingers.
On top of the table lay two scarlet and gold plates, suggesting Gryffindor. At the center of the piece of furniture stood a large bottle of butterbeer , whose label said 'for the happy couple, Draco and Harry'. Both glasses had the Hogwarts crest printed on them. Next to the bottle were two lit candles, both vanilla scented, which were white with golden finishings.
She and Luna hadn't discussed their under-the-mistletoe kiss further, as she wasn't sure what it had actually meant. She had felt the so called 'sparks' kissing her, but did that mean that she was in love with her? Was their friendship turning into something more? Even if she didn't know what that was, that had surely taken her mind off of things for a bit.
The day the students had to take the Hogwarts express to King's Cross, Hermione wanted to make sure that everything was into place, before having her boyfriend and her friends step foot into her house.
"Aren't you a bit obsessed with him?" Blaise observed. "I just hate him so much." Draco responded with a shrug. Oh, Blaise was so right, for once. He was becoming obsessed with Potter, not that he hadn't been in the years before this.
Something inside of her, though, told her to push her away. She wasn't a lesbian, she had dated so many guys and that should have confirmed her heterosexuality.
When they parted, both of them were smiling at each other. "I will be your girlfriend, by the way!' Ginny said. "If you want me to!"
He was with his girlfriend, Ginny Weasley. He would often see them making out all around the castle and he always found it rather annoying to witness. He grimaced at the sight of it. I can't stand them, he thought, I really don't understand what he sees in her. Always kissing her and laughing with her... that bloody redhead.
Draco's fear was, indeed, what usually pushed him to make the worst decisions. "I'm not afraid, I just don't like you in any way other than physically, you're arrogant-"
"Hi, Percy." he said to himself, in a mocking tone, since no one was giving him a shred of attention. "So good to see you, brother." he said.
"Come on, don't whine! We have to go, our ride is expecting us!" said a chirpy Hermione, getting up from her seat and leading the way out of the building.
"Say, Dracó, can you introduce me to your friend there, a little spicy ginger!" The french guy said, looking captivated.
"By the power invested in me by the Ministry Of Magic, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations!" The teacher squealed as the newly weds pressed their lips together.
"Oh, no, you'll fall from the sky, like this. Here," the redhead corrected, placing her own hands on the other girl's and moving Luna's in the right fashion.
Not much later, after Ginny and Luna had been picked up by Xenophilius, Hermione saw her grandmother in the distance. "There she is!" she exclaimed, then she waved at her.
"I'm so sorry, Harry! They threatened me... to kill my grandma if I wouldn't help them with their plan! I never meant to hurt you... oh, man, I should go to Azkaban, too!" the boy said in the grip of his sobs.
Often times Draco would find himself suffering from his father's frequent outbursts, which included being hit or emotionally abused.
"I don't know..." Draco murmured. His voice came out broken. He suddenly felt nauseous, his head was spinning as though he had been running around non-stop.
The next morning, Harry and Draco were filled with anxiety, thinking of the day that was ahead of them.
"Thank you for agreeing to this, babe." Draco said to his lover as they made their way to the three broomsticks, holding hands.
"I was just showing this filthy loser how to behave. He just couldn't help disturbing me." Draco quickly said. Harry raised an eyebrow at the mention of 'filthy loser' and 'how to behave', it was usually the other way around. He had to suppress a laugh at that.
With a movement of her fingers, she raised a flute in the air and the instrument began playing itself.
However, in the wizarding world, such exception was granted in France - he had hear Fleur talk about it, once.
Their brother, Fred, had died in May. They didn't talk about him much, mostly to numb the excruciating pain his death had brought, but Ginny knew that he would be mentioned at Christmas.
Draco had to face him that night, though. He would spend it with him, but he would sleep in Harry's dorm for the weekend. Sleeping at the Gryffindors' every night would have been too risky. Draco's change of rooms had already been an exception.
She wondered how her girlfriend could be fast asleep, not in the least bothered by what had happened only hours before.
This brought him back to Draco and his father's confrontation, which had taken place the day after their scandal.
"I'm not that mad at him... No, I will hit him where it hurts the most." Ginny said. She moved closer to Luna. "His heart." She then whispered, crunching a bean, making a red substance ooze out of it.
As soon as Ginny heard their voices, she sped to where they were standing and pulled them both into a hug.
Molly cheered, too, feeling proud of Harry. She had motherly instincts towards him so she felt as if yet another son would be tying the knot.
In Harry's bedroom, the now rekindled Harry and Draco, were in their post orgasm state, bodies and minds intertwined, while lying in bed, still naked.
"Ew, Harry... isn't it weird that we just left the room so that Hermione and Ron could... use it at their advantage?" Ginny heard him say.
"Here it is, the happy couple!" Goyle's voice boomed. "You think you're so cool because you kissed in front of everyone? The truth is you're simply dirty homos."
"Enough!" Hermione yelled, rising from her seat. She ran to where Harry was standing and stood there as well. "I have to ask you to leave my house." she said slowly.
If Hogwarts had only taught potions he would have been the happiest wizard on the planet. His eyes fixated back on the couple, who was now engaging in a full on make out session. This made him feel so, so jealous, though he hated to admit it, even to himself.
She didn't pair it with the silver shoes she had been given, but she had decided to go with the simple, casual shoes that her girlfriend had given her for that Christmas.
The room was definitely luxurious, it had a king-sized bed with white sheets embroidered with "just married", next to it was a heart shaped jacuzzi with red candles placed on its borders.
Harry didn't seem so sure of what he was saying, but he told her that Ginny knew he loved her and that he didn't need to say it all the time. Hermione and Ron looked at each other for a bit but brushed it off right away, they just made their way to the tree.
He had been slightly shocked because of it, but he had chosen not to tell anyone that he knew about it.
"Oh, Harry..." the girl said, "These words are just so beautiful." She was now crying freely. Ron put his arms around her. Harry was pleased to see that Ron, too, seemed to have understood what he had meant.
Everyone cheered and applauded loudly, even George and Angelina, who weren't mad that Harry had taken some of the attention away from them.
She was a modern witch, to put it out there. She had married four times, once it was with a pimp. Rumor had it, she would participate in some of the orgies.
There was a Weasley Quidditch Battle, as Harry's birthday request, on July 31st, which was won by Draco.
Ginny suddenly felt a weird feeling of warmth invade her chest, then her face, which became red. Must have been the effect of the Butterbeer, she thought, although she wasn't sure of it herself. Did she enjoy compliments from Luna a little too much?
"Oh, hey, Luna! I simply want to look my best, at all times." he said, while getting closer to her in order to hug her. "Aw, and hi Hugo!" he cooed, lightly touching the baby's nose with a finger.
“Jesus Granger.” Malfoy gasps, his own hand retreating from his pocket where his wand is stored, “You can’t just sneak up on people like that.”
Draco is as stiff as a board next to him and staring dead ahead, not even looking in Skeeter’s direction. Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s hand and turns slightly so that he’s standing directly in front of Draco and somewhat blocking Rita’s view of him.
Harry leaves Malfoy to his browsing and searches the isles for a vegetation textbook Neville told him about a couple weeks ago. He rounds the corner and finds himself in the young adult section. And who does he spot but Draco, sitting on the floor, legs crossed, quarter way deep into what looks to be a vampire romance novel.
“Admitted to St. Mungos.” Ron signs “Mom says that she thought Ginny had been losing weight and not sleeping, but then she found her unconscious on the staircase this morning.”
“Maybe later.” Harry says, his lips brushing against Malfoy’s slightly before he pulls away, “Teddy needs a bath and I want to do something fun with him today.”
The Quibbler, taking advantage of the interest, had released their interview with Harry and Draco yesterday.
Draco is holding a half gummed banana in his hands and seems to be desperately looking for a place to set it down. Harry laughs and hands him a napkin from the truck and throws it out for him as Draco hoists a fussy Teddy onto his chest. As they turn to find somewhere to sit, a voice cuts through the street reaching Harry’s ears.
Even though they don’t play well, they play better than expected. There are only a few times where the teams have to be spelled apart by Malfoy or Harry, and by the end, both teams are laughing and seem to be having a good time.
Harry nods and as he stands up to follow Ron out of the hall, he briefly squeezes Malfoy’s shoulder.
George joins the conversation at that, still looking sad, but somehow also laughing at the expression on Ron’s face. Harry allows himself to disengage and happily takes Teddy when Fleur passes him over.
Harry takes the high road and decides not to respond, but even if he had wanted to his answer would have been cut short by Malfoy slamming the door in his face.
“How was I supposed to know that, Malfoy?” Harry asks, pulling away from Malfoy’s mouth. “You were a huge twat and acted like you hated me.”
After hearing what had happened to Ginny he expected her to be bedridden, and thin. Or at least as thin as she was when they broke up. Instead, she’s standing before him looking healthy with a shadow of her old steely glint in her eyes.
“I don’t think we should release the snitch.” Malfoy says, his eyes on Harry. “It’s almost dark and we can watch their dynamics better from the ground, right?”
Eventually Teddy passes out in Draco’s lap, and Harry chuckles as Draco gently sets his own plate on the babies back. Draco shoots a glare in Harry’s direction, but still leans into his side when he drapes an arm over his shoulder.
The conversation grinds to a halt again when Draco and Seamus return to the table with Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna in tow.
“His magic ate The Dark Lord’s,” he continued, “the magic he had cast on him, the organs, the body, the magic itself–”
“You and Pans hadn’t wanted to travel all around the world,” he started. “I couldn’t tell you that I was dying. You’d have
“They say my eyes look exactly like your deceased Lord’s,” Harry whispered with venom, surprising even himself with this tone.
Cedric closed his eyes, defeated. “Like Harry,” he admitted. “He’s strong. He can save anyone, he’s never scared of anything,” he swallowed. “He told me you need to mean it when you kill. Then, and only then, works.”
The pianist didn’t even question. “Thank Merlin!” he said with a grin and stood up from the stool. “I’m going to eat something. Are you okay with playing until I come back?”
Draco was fighting back his tears, he tried to let his cold expression stay on his face, and he succeeded.
“This is Viktor Krum,” said Mr. Karkaroff. “He’s the only one who knows who you are. He’s in charge of your well being.” The man smiled widely and it didn’t reach his eyes. “He’s making sure you won’t be eaten alive.”
Whenever Draco sees Mother, she’s strong. She’s standing with a straightened back, never lowers her head and never raises her voice because she has never needed to do that.
Harry’s eyes became grim and he forced his eyelids to shut down. He felt his fury in his veins. In his smoke and blood.
Dumbledore nodded. “Who else did you expect, my dear boy?” He asked playfully with that special twinkle in his eyes. He stretched out his hand to Draco who stopped moving and looked at it with unease.
“Because there’s a problem. They changed the date of the execution. It’ll be next year.” He stopped for a minute. “You know what that means.” He whispered.
Harry turned towards the stage, to where he had heard the new voice came from. The singer was looking at him with eyes sly as the fox. He wore a hat and a long coat, his dark skin had a nice contrast to the green and purple lights coming out of the candles.
Dolohov grinned like a madman – which he was – and nodded at his leader, full of pride. Harry grinned too. He already felt the other ones magic. It was full of...
The sound of people talking, laughing, the smell of sweets and delicious, spicy stews are making him giddy, letting a joyful smile appear on his face.
Harry lifted one of his eyebrows, surprised. Then he tried to attack Malfoy with his magic, his thorns made of knives. But nothing happened, just a little uneasy feeling. Like if his magic was uncomfortable.
Father loves when mother smiles. He loves when Draco makes a good joke, and he loves the smell of new, and old books.
Hiii my adorable–evils!!! Here's the new chapter and I hope you will all like it!! This story is the love of my life so I would give the world to each person who commented ever since I've began to post it - you guys are the best I love you with all my heart.
“What did he do to Draco?” He asked her quietly while leaning closer. Like a predator approaching its prey.
Malfoy looked at the man without emotions and listened to him. The man raised his hand to touch Malfoy’s cheek and caress it, but the white haired man leaned away and looked at him with his glowing eyes, full of wrath and disgust.
Everyone is shouting but all Draco can think is that a memory that has a deep impression is the one that stays.
He was waiting, and waiting, and waiting for an emotion, for anger, for pain, for betrayal, for guilt–
He felt her magic stab his for a minute with thousand swords. It was strong, it was mighty and powerful. It would make every mortal fell on their knees.
Neville, next to him, was not amused with this statement. He stared at Harry with a ‘I told you so’ look.
“Why won’t I be alone?” Malfoy asked him again, not noticing Harry’s change. Not noticing his own pure, beautiful being and magic.
“The Cup is a portkey,” Draco breathed and Theo opened his eyes in surprise. He shouldn’t have been, though.
There’s silence and Draco can hear the boats leaving the docks. It’s a distant sound, loud enough to be important, yet quiet enough to make a difference and Draco, without really knowing why, asks, “Astoria, are you afraid of being ordinary?”
Harry froze and brushed his hand over Draco’s jaw and neck soothingly. “How do you know what I was–?”
I have bad news and good news – well for all of you, is just good – I am sick apparently (that means school is a no-no)  so I can write everyday from now on XD. Enjoy the new chapter my adorable–evils.
“Pansy,” Blaise whispered as if he was too afraid for anyone to hear. He grabbed her shoulders, mirroring her. “We can create something better.”
But Voskey thought he had been made for only the sole purpose to be here today. “At least I’ll die by my own choice,” Voskey growled. “All of you will die by following a man’s order who has never seen your face.”
“Ronald, it’s their wedding, not yours,” Hermione said from the other side of Harry, sending a disapproving look to Ron. Harry could already feel relief wash over him, hoping that this conversation would be cut off right then and there.
“Really?” Harry raised his hand and moved his fingers, as if he only now had seen his body for the first time. “How?”
“I know,” Blaise answers and the lets out a deep sigh, walking towards the window. The dark night sky, the golden lamps of the street, and the reflection of the moon on the river in front of the house. As he’s gazing out, he says, “When did it all go wrong?”
Draco saw Peter Pettigrew too in the memory. He needed to find that man as well – but according to his father, he had been dead for many years by now. Draco sensed that he lived. He didn’t know where the man was, but he knew he lived.
Pansy was shaking as she leaned close to Blaise and strongly grabbed his shoulders with dark eyes, glowing with fear. “Do you know what you’re talking about right now? What you just said right now?”
When he touched his cheek though, he could feel the tears. He was wiping away them, closing them in defeat and with
“Interesting.” She said at last and narrowed her eyes, thoughtfully. “I could use some of that in a fight.”
He didn’t want to admit to anyone or to himself. He tried to make Harry less like this before, but he failed. It happened again, he always felt it when he talked with him. But it was much stronger this time. Stronger than ever. He felt him again. It was in Harry’s voice. In Harry’s movements. In Harry’s aura. In his magic.
Dudley looked at him, then at Harry and he smiled smugly. Harry sent him a warning look, and that was the moment when Dudley was suddenly very interested of his own shoes.
“You’re right, I let my guard down.” Harry couldn't help but grin. “Constant vigilance indeed, you haven’t changed one bit. You know what? Never do.”
work but maybe it is because this peculiar song reminds him of his childhood. It is playful, repetitive and lively.
Robards doesn’t even say anything he just keeps staring at Ferdinand. “I don’t like the way he is looking at me,” he says with a stone cold face.
Time for Father is invisible, like air, or more like a fogbound. It is never-ending, unknown and immense.
Time freeze. His heart froze and it took a lifetime when he made himself turn around. Because he knew that voice. He
Harry wore an elegant coat, an old one with a dark shirt and a deep red vest. He always wore elegant clothes – he always looked clean and he was never late.
About War: "War is just perpetually in Dumbledore's office with his chess pieces, like he just live there (XDDD) Have you seen the sky War?"
“That’s very good.” He said to him softly, almost singing. He gathered up his magic, calling his thorns made of knives, rising his fire up.
Everything was quiet. Every Death Eater did not dare to look at him when he stopped and stood there in the middle of the room. Golden lights shone on the young child when he put together the palm of his hands and everyone flinched violently.
WARNING I: Cannibalism. It's finally here. (I was waiting for this moment since PART I OH MA GAWHDDD HYPE!!!)
“She’d have bothered us.” Balthasar said to him, looking at his sister with sinister eyes. “I’ll resurrect her anyway after I’m done with you.”
“That is really unfortunate.” He whispered with a bitter voice. Adjusting the poisoned anger, like a smoke, building up inside him, circling in his head and he felt someone’s hand on his shoulder. He turned around just to see Hermione’s eyes.
Draco and Greg stand up at the same time but Blaise’s mom is already there. She gently holds Blaise’s bleeding hand and whispers, “
Time is a thing which dances around Draco’s fingers like waves of a sea, and the color is a deep unforgettable blue which makes all men drown. Calm, powerful, terrifying.
Also, there was one thing that was constantly tucking at its brain. How he would have spent Christmas. Professor Slughorn, who was now head of the Slytherin house, had made a list of the students who would spend Christmas at Hogwarts and he was pressuring Draco to tell him what his intentions were, but he didn't feel like getting into it just yet.
"You, too." said Draco, giving him an Eskimo kiss. "Oh, he already had a name, though. He's called Viridis, if that's alright."
"Harry, he didn't cheat on you! Look, he's on veritaserum!" Hermione interrupted him, pointing at the small bottle in Ron's hand.
"Yeah, ugh! Not that I slept in my own dorm much, but I still needed to change my sleeping arrangements. I can't always sleep in the Gryffindor dorms." said Draco.
Draco suddenly felt a lot of love for his mother. He wasn't fully convinced of her words, but he had to admit that he had missed her and her reaction to his relationship with Harry was nothing like his father's blinding rage... Maybe, all hope wasn't lost, after all. He would live without a father, but at least he would still have a mother. All it took was to give her one chance.
"Ok, so..." the male voice said, the face it belonged to sighed. "Last night they slept in the same room, like every night. Nothing new. They've just spent the whole of breakfast time analyzing their talk with you, ma'am. Nothing too relevant for the time being."
"Who the fuck are you? What have we ever done to you, uh?" The Gryffindor spat, pushing the other boy physically.
Draco looked at him with a puzzled expression. "What are you talking about? Harry, I swear to you, he kissed me, I didn't want him to! I love you, I didn't cheat on you, I would never!"
"Aw, that's so cute, actually!" said Hermione, resting her head on Ron's shoulder. "I'll never leave you lonely anymore."
"Oh, and, Draco..." the girl said as she pulled away from Harry. "Don't mind my dad. You will see, he will be fine with it. Let's go back."
The wedding would be officiated by none of other than the most beloved teacher in Hogwarts, Adrastea Sivan.
"But.. what? Draco?" Lucius addressed to his son. "Is he serious? How can you do this to our family name? This is an outrageous insult! My son... an abomination!" He spat in an almost undertone. He was furious.
The best decision Draco had made was agreeing to becoming Harry's boyfriend, that had sucked him into a world full of emotion like he had never felt before.
That weekend Draco was meant to sleep in Harry's dorm. The last few nights with his perverted room mate had been surprisingly calm, but he hadn't dropped the Protection Charm surrounding his bed.
"Oh, fantastique! Every male studont in France was in love with 'er, but I wasn't. Yeah, I'm gay." Jean Jacques replied.
When Professor McGonagall prounced the word "Hufflepuff!" no one in their last year seemed to give her a shred of attention.
"Come on, it is obvious, Harry. Ron hasn't noticed yet...but we both know him. Just focus on your girlfriend, ok?" Harry nodded at that.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Oh, here we go. I mean," She said. "We've already established that we are fine with you and Malfoy, but... are you sure you can really trust him? After all, this is Malfoy we're talking about." She continued, in a worried tone.
Draco sighed, he wasn't too ecstatic at the thought of spending the holidays with a family who didn't like him. But Christmas at Hogwarts, at this point, wouldn't include his lover. So, he figured he could make an effort.
He would have never been able to get Lucius and Narcissa to greet Harry this way. He felt it was so unfair.
"Yeah, you did, but that's in the past. Don't bring this up again, Ok? This doesn't change the fact that you're the best part of Hogwarts. You beat classes and adventures by far." Said Harry in a stern voice.
Seamus and Dean wouldn't stop thanking him for all the good times and for giving them the strength to be themselves. Neville was the saddest to let Harry go, it seemed.
Narcissa Malfoy had complained about that decision, but accepted to go anyway, as it was her son's wedding.
No way. Ginny had never been more shocked in her life before. Malfoy? How could Harry, her man, have cheated on her with Draco Malfoy? She felt disgusted, to say the least. She was so shocked that she thought she would faint. This was a lot to take in. She sat so that she would steady herself, thus giving herself time to process the news she had just heard.
Miss Jones flashed her a bright smile. She was sitting at a desk, still in her Quidditch uniform, a quill in her hand.
Harry blushed furiously. It had actually happened. He recalled that dream about them kissing, which became true a day after.
"Oh, yeah, he's very lovely." the girl said with a smile. "But, really... I can't get him to match clothes!"
Then, they began their secret escapades in the Room of Requirement, which were meant to stay meaningless.
The two girls made a bet on their outdoor fun for the day; if Ginny succeeded in making Luna a perfect flier, they would have gone to see the European Cup that summer, if the Ravenclaw had not learned anything they would have gone to the Nargle convention, instead.
"Don't tell me," Draco scoffed. "Thank God I'm changing rooms tonight - this is what I talked about with McGonagall."
"Harry I promise to love you and cherish you till the day I die. I'm positive that you will do the same. If you won't I might murder you." Draco finished.
"Ah, I see. Well, I'd say that it's a bit too soon, maybe? I mean, the scandal only got out in December - although I'm inclined to think that your relationship started a month prior. But then again, who am I to stop this? After all, I married my first husband at eighteen and I had known him for around... two months?" Miss Sivan responded.
Hermione gave a moan of annoyance, putting her binoculars down. "Ah, Ron, come on! You can do better!" She shouted.
"Ok, now, if we're all set I think we can go on with the party." said Ron, motioning for everyone to follow him.
"You read my mind." said Ron. he took the vial of the truth potion out of his pockets and gave it to his best friend.
This was it. He heard nothing but his own heart thumping in his ears, as time perilously got closer to his speech.
"I missed you too! Addie always talks about you two, guys. Even in class. She uses her officiation of your marriage as an example to educate students on homosexuality. You two were legends this year." The ex Ravenclaw stated.
"Potter, I'm no boyfriend type. Right now all I want to do is shag you. Tell me if you don't want the same thing, and I'll leave you alone." He said this knowing that, now that he had him under his spell, the other boy wouldn't have done that.
"Jean Jacques?" the couple said in unison when they looked away from the devices in their hands, their jaws dropped and their eyes widened.
In the crowd were all the Weasleys with their respective partners - except for George, Ron and Ginny - Gabrielle Delacour, Hagrid (who occupied three seats), Xenophilius Lovegood, Hannah Abbott, who was sitting next to Neville, Susan Bones,Laura Granger , the surviving components of The Order Of The Phoenix and many more people who must have been family friends of the Grangers and the Weasleys.
Speaking with Ron or Hermione was pointless. They would not reason with him, no matter how hard he tried. They were firmly convinced of the theory that their whole story together had been fake and part of a cruel plan to 'get back at the chosen one'.
Molly was euphoric about becoming a grandma. What she didn't know, though, was that she would be a grandmother of two, not one.
Due to the fact that Hermione was with child the three couples had to get there the muggle way, which was by airplane.
Draco just looked down. It wasn't a lie, all his life he'd always had to do things that would please his father. His family background was responsible for his bullying and taunting throughout his Hogwarts years. All he wanted was to make his father proud. It's not like he had a choice, whatsoever. He didn't feel like digging deep into the intricacies of his family life, not in that moment. So he changed the subject. "The point is, she doesn't accept this thing between us, so what? It's not like we're married. But if you think I'm not worth it, well, you can leave and go find some other guy to screw."
Harry had told him so many things about this special device called a 'television' - apparently, muggles used it as a pastime. It was like a box, Harry had described, and it displayed luminous moving images of people or animals, usually. It sounded a lot like something the Wizards could have used, he found it odd how muggles had more advanced technology than them.
"I don't think so," said Hermione. "I mean, they didn't react badly to the news of you two being a thing." She pointed out.
They were what Harry had seen, hence his proposal of using the veritaserum, he knew he would have obtained a confession.
"It was glorious, really." Hermione explained. "There wasn't a soul in the room that did not shed a tear."
Ginny didn't really care about the subject of their meeting, she was more interested in spending time with her friend.
Both his friends were undoubtedly appalled. Hermione took a deep breath. "Look, Harry... You're inevitably going to fall in love with him, I know you. But don't come running to me when he breaks your heart in two." She said calmly. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but then changed his mind. He simply got up and then went to sit at the Ravenclaw table next to Luna.
He felt so stupid for fighting with him. All he wanted to do was run in his arms and kiss him fiercely.
Thoughts of his father left his brain as he basked into the warmth of three of the most important people in his life.
Draco was reminded of the first time he'd tried burgers. This dish, too, had to be eaten with your hands. He reluctantly grabbed a slice, having some of the toppings fall from it, then he took a bite.
"So you're telling me he's gay? It would make sense... I mean we never did anything uh... special... in almost two years of dating...But... who?" Ginny stopped to think. Who could have stolen her man? Maybe Neville? "Might it be... Neville? Oh, Luna, we need to get to the bottom of this." Ginny said. She swore to herself that she would find out who had corrupted Harry's mind into breaking up with her, but there were so many guys in Hogwarts... she just didn't have a clue as to who that might have been.
"Oh, right." Harry said, shifting his attention from Draco to his best friend. The thought had never really crossed his mind in the days before.
Mr Weasley gave Harry a soft squeeze in his shoulder. He didn't know that the boy took it a sign of encouragement. He must have simply done it out of affection.
He chose not to waste his good times with his boyfriend and friends crying about his estranged parents.
The taller boy pulled him into the most stringent hug they had ever shared, rubbing his back to soothe him.
"I am being bullied by my own house." Ginny said to her friend. She had her head down in order to avoid her gaze, as she had a lump in her throat.
It was her own version of the red velvet, it had golden edible glitter on top and it spelled 'Happy 19th Ginevra' with hardened golden frosting.
"We felt so bad that we had to interrupt the girls' date for their month-and-a-half-and-a-weeks-aversary, but we needed them to warn the Hadmistress."
When everyone was busy dancing, therefore not looking at him, Harry let go of his anxiety and danced with his lover.
"Oh Luna, yes, but it's not a magical virus or anything..." Hermione blurted when she turned off the water.
Not long after, the door swung open, revealing a smiling couple. Hermione's parents looked very clean and nice, their teeth were unbelievably white.
Instead of being hit by the usual fiery passion that would reign supreme through their nights together, they were both overcome by a freezing dullness.
"I knew I'd find you here." Came Harry's voice. He watched as his boyfriend undressed and went into the water with him.
"But, really, under all of that army he had constructed, lived a decent guy. He just needed someone to help him come out of his shell. And it seems like I'm that person. You see, we get each other, guys. I feel like I'm home, with him. He's like that dark part of me... but at the same time, that part of me that can make me happy like no one else can."
She had appeared out of nowhere, true, but he knew that her heart wasn't as black as her husband's. After all, she had lied to the dark lord to keep him safe.
"Yeah, just... a bit anxious." Draco said. His anxiety hadn't left him, on the contrary, now that he was about to go to the house of a family who didn't see eye to eye with his, it was increasing by the second.
"Directly from Hogwarts, the saviour of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter, seems to be in love with ex death eater, Draco Malfoy." Hermione began reading the snippet. "Could this be dark magic?"
"Oh God, this feels so real, now. What if Ron leaves me after the baby is born?" She said, biting her nails nervously.
"Congratulations!" Luna shouted, holding her dress to avoid stomping on it with every leap her feet took.
"Hi, Fleur!" Ron said, blushing instantly. He was looking at her with dreamy eyes and his mouth dropped, waving his hand like a fool.
"Oh." The Gryffindor girl said, as if she had finally understood the mystery surrounding those creatures.
Harry, on the other hand, wasn't affected by Fleur's presence, at all. He exploded in a sound laugh. "Ron used to have a crush on her, once." he explained to his boyfriend.
Luna's mistletoe was yet another way of reminding the redhead of their kiss, but, still, she wouldn't acknowledge it.
When Ron tried the Whiskey, he grimaced. It burned his throat and it tasted too strong - stronger then the Wizard version.
At dinner, when she had seen Ron, she'd had a compulsory urge to yell 'your girlfriend is pregnant!' in his face, but she suppressed it.
Draco came with a loud moan and then he fell flat on his stomach. Not much after, Harry came, too, and collapsed on top of him.
Draco was too shocked to do anything, he didn't even have his wand with him. He cursed himself for having been too muggle-like for his wedding.
"Pansy! You need to say 'Imprimo' while pointing at the camera!" Ginny screamed through her captors' arms.
"Hi, Oh Merlin, I love you! I'm your biggest fan! I have a poster of you in my room!" Ginny blurted.
Hermione and Ron didn't really agree with him, as they didn't think the words "Draco" and "sweet" belonged in the same sentence. Harry saw that his friends were not so convinced, so he continued. "He just happened to be unlucky. He didn't really have a choice, he had to join in on Voldemort's plans or he would have been killed. But he wasn't too happy about being a death eater. Such thing made him suffer greatly."
"Will you two please tell me what's been going on in this past month?" he asked. Not that he expected a response right away.
Hermione covered her mouth with her hands as she gasped. "Ah I knew it!" she said contentedly. Then, she walked towards them and proceeded to squeeze them both into a tight hug.
"Honestly, ignore them, Draco..." Hermione intervened. "Enjoy easter with us! Try not to give them too much importance, ok? Life is too short to always be this sad. "
Ginny and Luna didn't seem to listen, either. They weren't violent with him, they just wouldn't acknowledge his existence.
How could she had done something this serious to a person that she had once loved? She could have been a mature girl and accepted Harry's detachment, maybe now they would have been friends. But no, she had to go and ruin everything out of jealousy.
The two boyfriends had not played against each other yet, not since their romance had blossomed, so they both took it as a fun challenge.
The snow reigned supreme all around the Hogwarts castle. Anyone who dared walk outside found themselves calves deep into that icy substance.
"I know that, but those were dark times. I am a different person now-" Draco tried to say, but Hermione zipped his mouth shut with a hex.
Hermione picked it up and carefully tore the envelope open, five pairs of curious eyes watching over her. She pulled out an embellished piece of parchment and began examining its content.
"He's... he's great! Thank you!" Harry said to the three of them, wiping a tear. "Thanks, babe, I love you." he then said to Draco.
At this point, there was nothing more that he could do. He had tried so hard to reason with his dad, but, apparently, his hateful views were significantly more important than his father instincts.
"Ginevra Weasley, my ex and now sister/daughter, I want to thank you for every memory that we have. I think the two of us have been through a lot, but I cherish every moment. You are very important to me, so I want to pull this muggle tradition on you. I have to pull your ear nineteen times, it's for luck."
She had organised a wizard's chess tournament. It had to end before midnight, though, and the winner would be granted a special gift.
As he breathed shakily, his lover squeezed his hand tightly, trying to calm him down, telling him that he was there, next to him.
"He's changed, I reckon. I could get him to buy the Quibbler, maybe." said Luna. "Don't pretend that you're not about to cry, Gin Gin. You can cry freely with me. Unless you get your tears in my drink, I don't care."
Her girlfriend turned to her, smirking. As she opened her mouth to speak, Luna shut her up. "Oh, no, don't look at me. I want to marry you but we need to finish school first. I don't want to be too vulnerable for the Nargle attacks."
Hermione and her friends were eating chocolate eggs, feeling a bit sleepy as a consequence of their big lunch.
"Babe, I should have listened to you... I was just fooled by my mother's ways... I should have known it was too good to be-" he began, but the boy with the messy hair interrupted him.
"Pansy, I am so, so sorry." The blond boy put his hands on her shoulders. "But it would never work between us, for I am gay. And there's nothing I can do about it."
"Ginevra, what the hell did you just do?" Harry cried out. His face was becoming red in anger and the vein on his neck was beginning to throb.
One warm afternoon, in May, as the three happy couples were chilling under their tree, basking in its shadow, an owl delivered a very special letter, it was white with golden borders and there was a rose in each angle.
"What problem? Worse than you missing Quidditch practice?" Ron said in a bitter tone. But there was no time for futile grudges. "Really, Ron? Now you're gonna be all offended? Your devil of a sister found out that Draco and I were together and she had Pansy tell her that we were in Miss Sivan's office, then they went there and took an incriminating picture of us, which they're going to scatter across the whole school!" Harry said, all in one breath.
But that wasn't the case. His parents had completely deleted him from their lives because he hadn't grown up according to plan.
Upon reaching the Great Hall, where everyone was gathering for dinner time, they spotted Ginny and Pansy right at the center of the room.
"I'm sorry Ron," Harry said, looking at his best friend, who was still red in the face. "But I never felt anything like this with Ginny... I guess I was never really in love with her." He then turned around to look at Draco, smiling. His boyfriend didn't see him, as he was chuckling lightly at something Blaise had said.
The green eyed boy had started feeling nauseous. His boyfriend was crying and he stuttered his words... He was fearing that he would slap him with a sound 'No.'
As they got off the train in nine and three-quarters, Hermione had already put her arms around Ginny and Luna to say goodbye to them. The latter still had one foot on the locomotive.
"Just focus, ok?" Ginny instructed. "Or I will think that you're failing this class on purpose just to win your ticket to the convention, am I right?"
Everyone watched as they greeted each other with a weird secret handshake, which ended in the father flying his daughter in the air.
He wrapped his arms around his boyfriend, pulling him into a warm embrace, his tears springing freely.
"I am finally free, father. The price to pay, though, is to live without a real family. It hurts, but I will manage." he said, glancing at his boyfriend.
Hermione's parents were still in their seats, looking terrified. This was one of the disadvantages of having a witch for a daughter - strange things would manifest.
The Headmistress ordered for everyone to go back to their seats and continue with their meal, then she turned around to speak to Harry and Draco and awarded them 25 points each for their bravery.
They all spent a very calm , happy Christmas eve night. They went to bed pretty early, as they were knackered because of the long journey from Hogwarts.
"I know for a fact that she is at the venue already, she's the one giving you away to Harry."  Ginny informed.
Ron wasn't surprised when he saw that his package contained a red jumper with a brown letter "R" knitted on. Well, at least it wasn't maroon.
He was shaving the muggle way, as he thought it was easier than the magical way. That was the only good thing that his uncle Vernon had taught him, he reckoned.
But what sent him over the edge were Draco's moans, together with the knowledge of the fact that he was enjoying this just as much.
Blaise suddenly cast an impedimenta on him. The blond boy hadn't seen it coming as he was kneeling down to where Harry had fallen, trying to wake him up even if he was wandless.
"Oh no, it's not a girl! It's complicated... It doesn't seem fair to you that I should be with you if I don't love you, right?" Try as he might, he couldn't calm her down.
"Oh, Ron is coming in a bit, I don't know if the others are still asleep." Hermione replied, slightly massaging her tired face. "I'll go check."
"And you didn't hurt me, right?" Draco's tone was beginning to raise. "I'm telling you, if you're not going to accept me for who I am, then I have to ask you to leave."
"Ginevra, I think the nargles might have made him fall in love with someone. But I don't think it's a girl." Luna murmured.
His Gryffindor friends plus Luna all gave him loving looks as they clapped their hands for him, while Harry, who had been giving him a proud look for the whole duration of his speech, whooped for him, on his feet, completely shameless. Some people were giving him looks, but he didn't seem to be bugged by them.
"Allo, can you tell me ze way to the last yearr dormitoires?" they boy asked in a seemingly french accent. Must have been from Beauxbatons.
It was red, with a golden belt loosely knotted around the waist, suggesting the colours of Gryffindor house - strongly representing the bride and groom's unity, as they were both Gryffindors in their Hogwarts years.
"The hell with 'you're like a sister to me'! I'll destroy you, Malfoy! Your father WILL hear about this! We will make sure that this information will fall in the hands of Rita Skeeter!" Pansy yelled.
"George is getting married? And this is how he lets us know?" The brunette said, dropping the invitation letter and covering her gasping mouth with both hands.
Ginny watched as the other two people in the house engaged in a crazy dance, much similar to their secret handshake.
"Harry and Draco are my favourite couple." Luna said, shrugging. "...after me and my lady." she corrected herself, as Ginny had given her a death stare.
"Ron, do you still have the veritaserum? I guess little miss double face here has some explaining to do." he simply said, seeing something in the distance.
"Ah, a boy can look, no?"Draco winked at Blaise, the other boy rolled his eyes and then stopped as he saw the three friends happily walking towards their tree. "Ugh, look at the three little piggies. This is our spot and they want to steal it!"
Quidditch practice had been postponed so many times in the last month, given that everyone had been busy. But now, the only missing player was Harry.
"Ah, silly me. Almost forgot." the Ravenclaw continued, looking like she had forgotten to do something very important. Then, she took Ginny's face in her hands and planted a kiss on her lips.
Draco nodded, but he wasn't so sure that doing nothing was the best option. In a matter of hours, his father would have heard the news and would have probably come to Hogwarts to harm him. The only thing that Lucius hated more than Mudbloods were the homosexuals.
"It was nothing, really." Draco interrupted her. "It was just that I had copied from Granger during Potions." He shrugged.
"Ah, right, the gay couple!" Said Laura, not dropping her smile. "It's so good to meet you both. Hermione spoke very highly of you."
There was a moment of silence. Then, the girlfriends looked at each other. Luna whispered something in Ginny's hair, all while the others waited impatiently.
"Well, he said that it's something innocent in France. Maybe he really didn't think of it maliciously." Draco observed.
During meals she would sadly look at the people that had once thought very highly of her. They were laughing with each other, living perfectly fine without her. She wondered if maybe it would have been better to be expelled. At least, she wouldn't have to see them every day.
Harry did the thing that his husband always found cute; he pretended to be offended. He gasped loudly, crossing his arms.
Lucius was a mean and calculating figure and he often imposed his own beliefs on his son,  If Draco dissented on something his father proposed, or even had a different idea than him, that was when the two personalities wouldn't match.
He had finally said it. After years of bottling this up, he had found the courage to spit it out in his father's face, at last.
Draco and Harry told them all about it and everyone thought that Mrs Malfoy was very interested in the public recognition that would have come to her for her son's marriage to the Chosen One, but saw it as a simple reminder of the Malfoys being material people.
Throughout the last month Draco and Harry found themselves sneaking off to the Room of Requirement for their little sexual encounters.
It was almost every night. Harry didn't know how to feel about that. Sure, the sex was good, but it was all there was. Just mindless hate sex.
"Harry Potter, from the moment that I saw you, I felt a lot of hatred for you, but that only concealed an enormous crush." Draco commenced, his eyes locked to Harry's.
"Tell her, Harry." Ron said in that same stern voice from the night before. Harry gulped. "Well, Mione... I've just broken up with her... But she didn't take it that well..." Harry said as he looked at his now ex. Hell, she had taken it quite horribly.
The Slytherin girl looked like she had been slapped across the face. "No, Draco, I am done! I will get to the source of your strange behavior and everyone else will know, too." Having said that, the girl went back to her cauldron. "You just try." Draco said, more to himself than to her.
"Look, Luna," Ginny began, after taking a breath. "What happened between us... it was just a kiss... no more. We are just two friends who happened to kiss." she said, although she knew that this sentence was inconsistent with her real thoughts on the matter.
To Harry, it was the same amount of nervousness that he had felt on his very first Quidditch match. Just without the thrill.
"Come on, Harry. Your relationship is strong, I'm sure it would be fine if you just talked it through."said Hermione.
"You're here smiling , but I'm still shaken! That's perfectly normal in France, so he says..." Draco replied.
Professor McGonagall was on leave because of a death of a distant relative, so there was only one person in the whole school that could have accepted; Miss Sivan.
But the scolding never came. "Look, Harry," Hermione began, "I made a mistake. I was wrong and selfish. I should have accepted it from the beginning. I'm really sorry for what I called you and for how I acted... I shouldn't have made it about me. I mean, it's your life, Harry..."she smiled when she saw that Harry and Draco were holding hands, that meant they were a couple now. "I love you, Harry, and I want you to know that, even if I'm not so thrilled about this... I'm still happy for you. All that matters to me is your happiness." As she said the last line, Harry noticed that his friend's eyes were beginning to water. She had finally seen the light and he couldn't help smiling about it. He pulled her into a tight hug and as he did so he realized how much he'd missed Hermione's hugs. She hugged back just as tightly, burying her face into his neck. "I'm sorry too, Mione... I should have known you would have reacted like this."
"But guys, come on, don't be this sad. Once out of here, we'll spend the whole summer together at our house!" Ginny whined, pointing at herself and her brother.
The pair froze. They slowly broke apart, then they turned around to face a shocked Pansy and a smirking Ginny.
"Don't do anything, Herrmione." the blonde girl whispered. "No need. You will see, we've got zis underr contrrol."
"And these are my friends, Harry and Draco." Hermione said, grinning and putting her arms around their shoulders.
"Look, Draco," said Narcissa. "My opinion on the matter differs greatly for your father's." she explained.
"So, I was thinking, I could organise your big day, dears." she gushed. "You don't want to use an old tux, Draco. We need to find you something... incredible looking."
Harry sighed, then he spoke, "Ginny, I'm really sorry if I hurt you. But, I figured it would be best to break up with you than actually cheat on you." He got up and walked over to her.
"Oh, look who's at the Slytherenne table! Dracou! What brings you here? Fight wiz Potter?" came Jean Jaques' voice.
"Ugh can't we have a dorm just for the two of us?" said Harry, annoyed. "I'm starting to think this constant house division thing doesn't make much sense."
There was a flush, then the brunette opened the door. She looked extremely pale. She stumbled to the sink to rinse her mouth.
It was basically an old decorative armour remodeled for the girl's physique. It covered her whole body except for her torso and Ginny thought it was perfect for their activity.
"Clear." Harry responded. They both felt incredibly ecstatic as they dived right into their first official boyfriends kiss.
"At least he doesn't talk in his sleep or moves uncontrollably. Next time, I will kick you." Said Draco, suppressing a sneer.
In that moment, shocks of pleasure invaded both bodies, uniting them in a familiar frenzy of ecstasy.
"Oh, I didn't think..." Ginny said. She was very ashamed of herself, more than she had been the day before.
"Well, with no further do, give us your first update of the day, son." Narcissa ordered to the head in the fireplace.
"Yes, Minerva, I received your owl. And I can't even begin to express how sorry I am on behalf of my daughter. I can assure you, she had never behaved like this in her life before." Molly said dryly.
"I don't know how you can just forget about our good times, the Quidditch championships... and just say this. Did you even love me or did you only care about the way I made you appear? " said Draco, trying to ignore the lump in his throat.
Soon came time for cake and everyone moved to the kitchen, bringing their stereo with them. With a flick of his wand, Ron switched the music to "Happy Birthday".
Luna's heart was warmed at the sight of her cheerful girlfriend. This was definitely more worth it that taking her to the Nargle Convention.
"You can't stop me, Harry!" the girl said. She was in no way seeing that she was about to make a very big mistake.
Harry and Draco didn't focus on the parchment, though. As soon as their teacher closed the door, Harry launched himself at his boyfriend, wrapping him into a tight hug. "I've been waiting all day for this!" He said in an excited tone.
It was Bill , the oldest of the Weasley children, who opened the door. "Hey family!" he exclaimed, with open arms.
"We heard so much about you!" Both parents said as they all came inside, and it didn't take them long before they hugged Ron, too.
In Hogwarts, he was a leader, people followed him and feared him, but they also adored him. Those were all the things that he felt for his father.
You are being brainwashed by Potter's lot, we demand that you drop this act and sort out your priorities, if you care about your family.
He cursed himself. Couldn't he have waited until that night to kiss his boyfriend? He would have been in an impenetrable room. But no, he had to confess his undying love for Draco in that stupid office, one that anyone could have entered.
"This is where you're wrong." came Ginny's voice. She was walking towards the Slytherin girl, followed by Luna and Professor McGonagall.
As requested, Luna slowly removed the Gryffindor's panties, smiling as she saw that they were soaked.
"Oh, no, she's got a bun in the oven!" Luna tittered excitedly, earning a look of a thousand deaths.
"Get. Lost. Now." Harry ordered, putting himself in front of his boyfriend, shielding him with his body.
That was when Hermione began fuming. "OH I don't Understand? Tell me, what's there to understand in such betrayals?"
"Well, Merry Christmas everyone!" Arthur said, happily. "Hope you behaved!" He chuckled, but his happiness was cut short when he noticed that Draco, Lucius' son, was standing right in the middle of his house.
"I don't care, I just want to stay here, cuddling you." Harry said, all while raising his head to look at him. "I missed you too much."
Ginny took a breath. Luna was right, she had found herself thinking of her in some... ways. Even throughout her relationship with Harry, but at the time she had simply mistaken it for sexual frustration.
When it was time for cake and the attention fell back on the newly weds, Molly went to talk to her daughter and Luna.
"They could have wiped out your memory of me! Or... Merlin knows what else!" Harry scolded, worriedly.
He decided that a bath in the Prefects Bathroom had to be to in order, so he made his way to it- it was the best way to calm his nerves.
Naturally, seeing Laura and Donald as they met their daughter's boyfriend, all laughs and smiles, was a tough blow on Draco.
"Before we can all engage in this dance, Ron and I need to tell you something... We're having a baby!" she shouted.
It was Ginny's turn to speak, now. "So, um... I haven't always been a fan of this couple, but they're definitely soul mates, I found." She said, beaming.
The next days went by pretty fast, in a blissful motion of things. They were filled with backyard Quidditch, snow ball fighting, hot chocolates and muffins.
Ron and Draco learned that muggle restaurants had a paper menu instead of the drawn-in-the-air-one. They also had many waiters. No one would have their trays fly above their hards, they only carried them by hand.
"I can't look!" said Ginny, burying her face in her girlfriend's shoulder, scared that Harry would get his heart broken.
"Think of what the parents will say now." Harry said with a sigh. This situation reminded him of when nobody believed him when he'd said that the Dark Lord had come back. He remembered how the parents of some students had accused him and Dumbledore of being corrupted.
"Well, it makes more sense for you to come here since everyone here is your friend, now." Harry pointed out.
Bill, Fleur, Xenophilius, George and Angelina had to leave, too, so that the only people left at the Burrow were Mr and Mrs Weasley, Ron, Harry, Draco, Ginny and Luna.
"I told you, it's nothing." Hermione repeated. Her nostrils were beginning to flare. Talking to her in this state was like trying to cuddle with a hungry lion.
"I'm glad that you found the courage to tell us. Know that we won't ever judge you for being with a girl."
George didn't look so good, but his recent attachment to his ex class mate, Angelina Johnson, had brought him back to work, at least. He had an unkempt beard and his hair was all over the place, but at least he was out of bed.
Also, the way he was asking those questions made him sound like some sort of a therapist, coming straight from Saint Mungo's.
Pansy gave him the most weirded out look ever. "Um... no... Draco, as we both noticed... there's something in the air. And you were afraid I'd tell-"
The organisation of the ceremony was carried out by the Weasleys and it was meant to be a surprise, so no one among them -except for Ginny and Luna- knew what it was going to be like.
"And why didn't you find the Room of Requirement?" Ginny asked Luna. They were still working on the project from the night before.
If Hermione had been pregnant, she would have become an aunt. The thought made her feel excited, although she tried to conceal her enthusiasm- she didn't know whether the news would be positive for her brother or Hermione herself.
Narcissa was more confused than she had ever been in her entire life. She jerked her head slightly to see that both Blaise and Neville were being held down by Hagrid.
If Blaise had been drinking, he would have spat the liquid out of his mouth "What? Weasley? I don't understand your.. tastes! If you liked Potter, that would be the craziest thing ever." He laughed out loud. Oh how wrong are you, my friend, Draco thought.
"Oh, Neville.. no, you shouldn't." Harry said, bending down to look at him. "What they did to you was atrocious and they will pay for it." he extended his hand for the other boy to hold.
"You have no evidence." Pansy angrily spat. "No one will believe you! It sounds absurd, even to me."
"So, I told the Ministry of Magic that something like this could take place, therefore they made it impossible to disapparate from here until after the ceremony would be terminated. This is why you're unable to leave." Harry suddenly said.
Luna had made a miniature mistletoe for Ginny, while Ginny had bought her a pair of shoes. "So the nargles won't leave you barefoot." She said to her.
"I couldn't talk to you before, but now I am here, Draco, hoping you will see past your rage and at least try to forgive your own flesh and blood." Narcissa pleaded, looking even more emotionally destroyed than before, her gaze fixated on the floor.
Harry, after taking a second to swallow, nods, “had to take care of some business. Sorry, what about you?” Harry asks, glancing at the door as the bell jingles. It’s just a customer looking around, so Harry focuses back on the conversation.
“I doubt he’s remembered, we’ll have to take him to yours. We can’t very well lock him up just because he doesn’t remember you and has nowhere else to go,” Ron says, and he sounds stressed.
Draco probably shouldn't have stormed out like that. Harry would never do something stupid like cheat on him, he loved their life too much, especially Scorpius. Harry probably didn't even notice Notts obvious attraction, and definitely didn't classify coffees and pastries as flirting. Idiot.
“His name is supposedly Albert, it’s a decorative piece that’s said to attract cats, although I’m not sure if that’s true. He looks a little wonky wouldn’t you say,” Harry responds, gently taking the piece from Theos hand. Their hands brush together and Harry internally cringes. Theo smiles down at him, and Harry turns away so he doesn’t have to deal with that.
i actually like this chapter a lot. nothing really important happens and yet it manages to be pretty much double the length of my other chapters. Thats for you, commenter who complained about chapter lengths. Also idk shit about crime solving especially fantasy wizard crime solving so i mean dont judge me if its wrong... i just wanted gay angst okay i did my best.
"Spence! When will you give up! He's not interested in dating you," Rosie said, a little too loudly for Dracos comfort. He glanced at the other customers, but they didn't seem to have heard.
“So, other than the coffee have you gotten anything from Draco? Unless, you’ve just been flirting with him this whole time despite him not knowing who you are?” Ron asks, eyebrows raised. Harry turns red and looks away from his ginger friend. He’s saved from a response as Hermione floos over, children in tow.
Half an hour later the urge hasn’t gone away and in fact has gotten worse. He contemplates for all of two seconds before he decides that he might as well, if only to ease his conscious. He quickly fire-calls Molly to see if she’s willing to take Scorp for the evening, and she’s absolutely thrilled. Apparently she’d just finished making him a pair of socks and couldn’t wait a second longer to give them to him. Harry smiles fondly, and then floos to the portkey office. He briefly thinks maybe the workers are simply bored, with how willing they always are to set up last second portkeys for him to the same place.
Neville sodding Longbottom, Draco hasn't seen him properly since Hogwarts but he's not hard to recognize, that's not the problem. The problem is Draco specifically came to this far away little town because there was absolutely zero wizard or witch activity, he'd looked forever to find a nice place without any magic visitors. He'd been here for four months and hadn't seen a single wizard or witch, he'd been sure that it would work out. Of course, nothing ever worked out for Draco, he should have expected it.
want to see Draco pretending to grab something from the back room in order to hide from Spencer making a fool of himself again. Harry has half a mind to say something, but he knows he shouldn’t cause drama, especially since Draco will be out of here soon.
Draco takes a moment to breath, dropping his head into his hands. He wipes away stray tears and then forces himself to look up with a final deep breath. Harry is still in front of him, and Draco feels impossibly guilty that he has to ask.
He’s saved by the bell, as someone enters his store. Harry glances from his painting and is shocked to see Ron standing there, looking around the store for Harry.
Harry spends the whole time thinking of seeing Draco again, even if he’ll be polyjuice potioned and can’t interact with him as himself. He wonders what Dracos doing at a library, how he acts, how close he is with “Rosie”, but most of all he worries about Dracos lost memories. Will they ever return? Why would someone take away the memories of his life? Would Draco even want to remember-
He’s breathing just fine, and Harry slumps in relief. He sends a patronus to Ron, lacking anything else to do. He has to get the two unconscious people out of the library before anyone enters, and his portkey lasts another half hour at least. He wipes some of Dracos hair out of his forehead and checks for any signs of discomfort, but he seems to be sleeping peacefully.
“Smart and experienced, you don’t make a potion like that off the fly,” Ron amends, and claps Harry on the back. Harry takes a step forward, grunting at the force, “just wanted to update you. We’re getting closer to solving this thing. I’ll see you later, yeah?”
"Hermione knows more about memory than I do. Maybe she can find out how he's forgotten, charm, spell, potion, etc. But we can't just storm in there asking questions, first of all, we can't go there at all looking like ourselves. He'll be suspicious, he's already shocked to see Neville, and we have no clue if the person who did this to him ever goes there, if they see us there they might panic and do something to Draco. We need to be careful, I'll ask Hermione to come with me to see him tomorrow," Ron says, his tone not leaving room for argument.
"The surprise is mutual. You often come here and feed my husband unhealthy foods, Nott?" Draco said, sliding off of the workbench and crossing his arms.
“Go find Scorpius!” She says cheerfully, quickly looking around to spot the two men at the kitchen table. She raises her own eyebrows at Harry as she walks over, arms on her hips. Harry feels like he’s being scolded by a mother, not uncommon when it comes to Hermione.
“Daddy! The teapot is screaming!” Scorp shouts, and Harry starts. The teapot is in fact whistling, and Harry quickly goes to retrieve it, “You act weird when papa isn’t here. When is he coming back? I miss him, and I want to tell him about Marvins science project exploding!”
“I’ll stay for a while, Rose and Hugo are excited to see Scorp again and we haven’t been here long,” Hermione says, standing up to make herself some tea. Ron nods and floos away, coming back about twenty minutes later, taking the offered tea that Hermione holds up.
"Draco, the new client is here, shall I send him in immediately?" His assistant asked, and Draco cleared his throat and said yes.
?” he says, managing to sound like he has the upper hand here when clearly they’re conspiring against him. Hermione actually covers her mouth with her hands and tears up again, while Harry lets out a long breath and falls into an armchair. Dracos inclined to agree.
"Hello, sorry to disturb. Is Draco in?" Harry asked, plastering on a terrible smile that didn't reach his eyes. Dracos assistant, Harry really should remember her name one of these days, bit her lip.
Hermione nods, pretending to be interested, "and what about your coworker? You see, my hair is dyed as well and I would love to get such a striking blonde colour!"
The panic rises in Draco's chest again and he’s shaking his head before Ron even finishes speaking, “no, no no no! Harry and- your sister, they’ve been together since school, they’re married and have three children. I haven’t seen Harry at all! There’s no way-” Draco finds himself choked up for no reason. An adopted son… “there's no way we could have… could have…” he can’t bring himself to say it.
After picking Scorp up from school and making dinner, Harry goes up to his room and sits on his bed, staring at the picture of him and Draco in their wedding day, where it sits on their bedside table. Why would someone go out of their way to create a whole new potion just to make Draco forget his life and put him in some random town? Working at a library and thinking that Harry is married to Ginny?
Harry ended the call and yelled to Scorp that he was leaving for a few minutes and not to make a mess or let anyone in. Once he arrived Dracos assistant nodded and let him pass. Harry knocked on Dracos door, waiting for a response. He tried again a couple seconds after the first knock yielded no answer.
For the four months that Draco had been gone, Harry had been struggling to sleep. Usually he would fall asleep after a few hours of tossing and turning, and then wake up to nightmares of what could possibly be happening to Draco. Sometimes he'd even dream of past things, like what would've happened to Draco in the fire if Harry hadn't circled back. Overall, his sleeping pattern had been pretty disrupted. He found it much harder to stay awake during the day, he had deep eye bags, and he was almost constantly in a foul mood.
“I’m definitely feeling much better than usual,” he responds, and feels the itch to paint, something he hasn’t done in a while. He nods decisively, and gets up to his little painting station. Theo follows him, eyebrows raised.
Harry nods, “well I probably wouldn’t have told you if I didn’t have to. You see, I’ve seen a man there twice now. He wears a big black jacket, and he gives the workers coffee once a month. You remember his unexplained headaches? After he drinks the coffee they go away, so it’s my theory that the man is responsible for how Draco is now,” Harry explains, “I’ve gotten some of the coffee meant for Rosie, I assume it has some in it as Rosie said it tastes weird and the man has no way of knowing which Draco will choose beforehand.”
Once he gets to the library, glamoured as the same red head as he didn't have access to polyjuice potion anymore, he takes a deep breath. Just a couple minutes.
“So, well, this may sound insane to you but- erm… the two of us, you and me, we’re…. Sort of married?” Harry finally makes himself say, and Draco takes a moment to process what he’s said. He laughs, and the laugh sounds a bit crazed. Well, thank god… it's not Draco who has gone insane but rather Harry.
I don’t know how to get the notes from at the end of the entire story to just the end of the first chapter lol
Ron and a few other aurors arrive soon after, and the others take the guy and apparate away. Ron walks over to Harry and Draco, checking him over just as Harry had. He sighs deeply and rubs his forehead.
“You could say that,” Harry mutters, and finds himself painting Draco. A Draco surrounded by books, smiling as he reads aloud. Theo watches the painting come to life with a frown, which Harry doesn’t comment on. He had figured that maybe the two never really got along, maybe something happened in their past that neither really got over. Theo leaves soon after, and Harry paints for the rest of the day, until he has to pick up Scorpius.
Hermione hums. The conversation clearly over, Rosie smiles, waves, and walks back towards the register.
“Potter? Weasley? What have you done to me!” He shouts, standing up quickly, but that proves to be a dumb idea as naseua suddenly doubles him over. There’s a pair of arms around him, gently coaxing him down into a seated position, and Draco internally hopes its not the dumb Weasley.
Complicated? Draco said it was just a potion thing, and those were pretty easy to him. He said as much to her, and she furrowed her brows.
At Draco's reaction, Harry changes course. He picks one of the photos off the wall and with an extended arm so as not to scare Draco again, shows him the photo.
“I came to get you breakfast but you weren’t here, busy morning?” He asks as Harry digs into his salad.
Once he’s through Scorp waves excitedly and the two of them move to the kitchen table, where Harry slides the coffee over to him. Ron opens it and looks in, shrugging, “not my expertise, I’ll have someone check it out,” he says, putting the lid back on.
A minute or two later a very tall man walked in, wearing a large black jacket and a thick scarf. Draco put on his best professional smile, and gestured for him to sit in the chair in front of his desk. The mans name was Terrence Cheyenne, and he walked funny, as if unsure of his footing. He sat down slowly and didn't make a sound.
Once they were home, Harry checked the rooms first, thinking maybe Draco had arrived while they were gone, and was just in a terrible mood. When that failed, Harry and Scorpius wrote a letter together, ("dear papa, you forgot to get me today. It's okay. Don't forget next time, and I love you lots and lots," "Maybe I should write it?") and sent it off. A couple minutes later the owl came back, the unread letter still attached to it. Now Harry was starting to worry. He decided to fire-call Dracos assistant.
not gonna lie this got me sobbing a little... Draco having to ask his own sons name is just so heartbreaking to me. Hope you enjoye hehe.
“I’m not even going to comment. Where’d you get this salad? It’s really good,” Harry changes the subject fast. He isn’t sure why Theo sometimes makes jokes like that, it seems unfitting to their friendship.
Things are really looking up for them, he thinks. Draco will be together with them again in no time.
Draco is certain of one thing, if nothing else, he hates when the customers act like they know more than he does. Especially Dorothy Jones, a regular at the library who comes in at least once a week making her demands, requesting Draco be fired, and generally causing a fuss. Draco thinks she must live a boring life if she can't stop herself from visiting and ruining everyone's day. All that lady does is make a fool of herself.
house come back, and he just lets Harry hold him. This, if nothing else, is proof enough that Harry must love him. Draco can’t wrap his head around it, it just seems impossibly out of reach, to be loved by someone enough to spend their lives together, he doesn’t remember a time he felt genuinely deserving of love like that.
Harry walks further into the library, hoping he doesn't look awkward or suspicious. Frank asks if he wants any help, and Harry shakes his head without looking away from Draco, who's reaching high above his head to put a book on the shelf.
I wrote this forever ago and I have been trying to write it on and off since then, but I keep losing motivation. I figured if I posted the first chapter and got feedback I'd find motivation to finish it. So if you liked this chapter, comment!
“You look like shit, don’t you sleep?” He says, startling everyone including himself. That sounded alarmingly close to genuine concern. Harry looks up at him and tentatively smiles, which shocks the glare right off of Draco's face, who prays he hasn’t gone pink. Right, so the world has been flipped upside down if Harry Potter of all people is smiling at him.
"I know right? What a catch, but Draco and I have become very close over the months, and I know for a fact he hates when people are obsessed with him, so if you expect to come in here everyday and stalk him like some knock off Spencer McDonald then think again," Rosie says, crossing her arms and glaring at Harry. Harry pauses, raising an eyebrow.
"Are you alright?" Someone behind him asks, with a vaguely familiar voice that Draco can't place. They must've come here before. He turns to see that it's the redhead.
we used portkeys in the first place is the stupid town is multiple apparations away, and supposedly one of the new recruits got sick after a few, and the slimy bastard managed to fight out of the grip of the others, not expecting him to be awake. He apparated away before the man even finished vomiting.” Ron explains, dropping into an armchair with a loud stressed sigh. Harry also lets himself fall into a seated position, on the couch Draco is currently resting on, just enough room at the end for Harry not to sit on his legs.
"He took in a client today and they haven't emerged yet. He ignore two of my calls, but I think it must be a really complicated request if it's taking this long," she said, nodding her head decisively.
“Whatever it is you think I’ve done, you’re wrong. Let me go,” He says, trying and nearly failing to hold back his anger. He thought they were done with accusing him of crimes every chance they got. Apparently the gryffindor sense of moral superiority never went away. Ron is still staring at him, clearly unsure what to say. Draco doesn’t dare look at Harry, who is still for some unknown reason sitting next to him, albeit he didn’t move any closer when Draco scooted away, so they’re not risking contact anymore.
He walks in and sees Draco and Rosie at the register again, but this time there is another worker. A short man with greying hair and a strange posture. His name tag says Frank. There aren't a lot of customers, just the occasional person browsing. The one oddity is the tall man waiting in line, wearing a long black jacket and holding a couple coffee cups instead of books. Harry swears he looks familiar.
He walks over to Harry, sparing a glance towards Draco, and pulls his best friend into a hug, “shite Harry, I’m so sorry but-” he pauses and grabs Harry by the shoulders, ending their sudden hug to make eye contact, “-those bloody new recruits managed to lose the bastard somehow, I should’ve went with them, what was I thinking-” he bemoans, sounding guilty. A pit opens up under Harry that his stomach falls right into, and he has to close his eyes.
Draco raises his eyebrow and then glances at Harry up and down, which makes Harry giddy for reasons he can’t explain. He knows Draco isn’t checking him out, and either way the body he’s borrowing is just that, borrowed.
It makes no sense, Harry sighs and rubs his forehead. He really wants to visit Draco again, but he usually does it while Scorp is at school and he can’t very well leave him home alone.
“Draco, there's no easy way to tell you this, but your memory since school has been tampered with, and instead of remembering your life with Harry you remember everything differently. You and Harry have been married for years, in fact you have an adopted son,” Ron gets straight to the point, “we need to find a way to restore your memory, but we don’t know how they’ve been altered.”
Nothing. Dracos office was empty. No Draco in sight. Harry's eyes were immediately drawn to the fact that there was unfinished tea on either sides of the table, and an empty notepad was opened in front of Dracos chair. The page was slightly crumpled. Harry felt his heart jump into his throat.
Rosie also laughs, "I'm sure they would, but Dracos super wound up. Hard to become friends with a man like that, he didn't even know my first name the first month he was here. But he's a real sweetheart once you get to know him, until the month ends that is," she mumbles the last part under her breath, but Hermione hears it anyways.
“I always wanted to name my future child Scorpius,” Draco mumbles, and Harry nods. At least that memory hasn’t been taken from him.
None of them had. Ron told him that if Draco didn't show up within 24 hours, they had to consider him a missing person and an investigation would open up. That's when Harry finally let himself succumb to the panic.
The same can't be said of Harry, who is paying annoyingly close attention to him. He easily masks his anxious feeling, he’s gotten pretty good at faking emotions. He’s had a lot of experience.
"Having any trouble?" He asks, and Harry has to internally force himself not to chuckle at his customer service voice. He had never heard Draco talk like that, so falsely friendly. Despite the strange tone of voice and the fact that Draco doesn’t know him, Harry gets excited all the same. He can’t help the slightly goofy grin that appears on his face.
He squints his eyes open and is minutely relieved to see green eyes looking at him in concern, and then remembers himself and scowls, flicking his arm so Harry will stop
Draco sighed again, "As thrilling as the thought is, some people can't just chose not to work whenever they feel like it. I've got to be in the office soon, I've a new client coming in an hour and I want to make a good impression for him,"
"Listen can I just come through? I'll go in, he won't mind," Harry asked, and she looked hesitant before nodding.
"That's good to hear, honestly I'm getting good vibes from you, for now I'll vouch for you, but in the months I've known Draco, I have never once seen him interested romantically in anyone. Between you and me, I think he might still be hung up on a past lover," Rosie whispers conspiratorially, a twinkle in her eye. Harry thinks she's probably telling him, in her eyes a complete stranger, too much information. She probably just loves the drama.
"No, Rosie, I don't have a boyfriend. I can't even remember the last time I've seen Potter, and I certainly have never dated him," Draco says, hoping against all odds that his face hasn't turned red. He feels his ears burning.
“Right well, I’m just surprised you’ve actually told me,” he comments, rolling his eyes, “guess I should’ve known.”
"Past lover?" He asks, hoping to get her talking more. He wants to know what this Draco is like and Rosie seems to be his best option at the moment. She kind of reminds him of a muggle Pansy, or maybe Pansy if she had been sorted into hufflepuff rather than slytherin. Pansy would kill him if he knew what he was thinking.
Harry shakes his head, “No, you said it would be easier to list reasons we would be married. Tell me one then,” he seems entirely to smug for his own good.
"Charming, Harry, but my office is a mess and I need to clean it up. This client says he needs help with some kind of potions research, and those are really my favourite jobs," Draco grinned down at Harry, who rolled his eyes.
Harry finally listens, nodding his head and rubbing his tires eyes, sitting at Hermione and Ron's kitchen table.
“Uhhh...” Harry can’t remember the last time he picked up a book to just read, most of his book knowledge comes from Draco reading aloud and complaining about what ever twist or ending he didn’t like and claiming he could’ve written a better ending with his arms tied behind his back. It’s very endearing, “fantasy?” He guesses, grasping at straws.
Draco narrows his eyes, and Rosie squeals, "you've got a boyfriend! Named Harry? Why've you left him? No wonder you've never accepted Spencer's advances!"
“Why not?” Draco asks incredulously, “It would take less time to list the reasons we would! There are so many reasons we could never date, reason number one being you’re the bloody saviour of the wizarding world and I-” Draco glares at him, “I was decidedly
observes his surroundings. He’s clearly in someone's house, their living room to be exact, and there are pictures hanging on the walls that Dracos still sleep-blurry eyes can't make out. They’re sitting on a couch, and the coffee table in front of them has a few things on it, nothing of interest. He finally makes out Rons startled face and… ah shit, auror robes.
"Hm" Draco made a noncommittal noise, barely suppressing the urge to glare at Theo. Theo was doing a similarly poor job.
Terrence didn't respond, and after a while Draco cleared his throat, "Mr. Cheyenne?" He asked, and blinked away some confusing blurriness. His head began to feel a little heavy, and he shifted in his seat, "I'm going to need a little cooperation if I'm going to help you," he chuckled awkwardly.
They exchange a glance, "Longbottom, I've no idea what you're doing here or why you've referred to me as Draco, but I have work to do so if you could hurry on," Draco says, doing his best impression of someone who's not considering living in a hole and never emerging.
Draco Malfoy was sitting on Harry Potters workbench, against his better judgment. Harry was standing just in front of him, hands on either sides of Draco's hips. Draco had his arms resting on Harry's shoulders, his legs holding Harry in place. Draco sighed as he pulled away from their kiss.
Being famous Harry Potter does have its perks, he thinks, as he is allowed to set up a portkey the second he walks through the office doors. He'll be in and out, he thinks, just seeing Draco is still okay will put him at ease. He'll leave quickly, open up the shop, and then he'll be fine.
Also, I’m like 18, I started writing this when I was 17, so sorry if some of the adult stuff doesn’t make sense, according to that commenter a bookstore and a library are two different things and I keep calling the place Draco works both. Well I’m sticking with library for now, because I’ve mentioned checking books out a lot. Let’s just say it’s a library where you can also buy the books (is that not a thing? I always thought it was)
can only come in a box. It's dyed! Vegan dye of course, I redo it every couple months," Rosie explains, running her fingers through her hair.
After the second attempt went unanswered, Harry began to panic. He tried not to let it get to him, Draco ignored him all the time. Especially when he was with a client, so it wasn't anything new, it was just worrying on top of everything else, "Draco? It's Harry, I need to talk to you," Harry expected that to finally work, but yet again there was no answer.
Draco sigh and read over the file in front of him again, the form his client had filled out. He had already read it several times, but it never hurt to be prepared. His client would be coming in soon, and Draco always got new client jitters. He loved his job, helping people in any way he could. Most clients simply needed financial help, which he found easiest, but his favourite were the customers who needed help with potions, especially if they wanted him to brew it for them. His clients came in for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes all he could do for them was to point them towards someone else more qualified. His favourite client was the little girl who had come in one day, crying her eyes out and demanding he find her pet frog for her. She hadn't truly been a client, far too young, but he'd helped her. Supposedly she'd heard of him "helping people do things they couldn't" from her mother, and couldn't find anyone else to help her.
“That’s Terrence, he comes here once a month because he used to work here she he says he misses it. He brings coffee, but it tastes awful so I usually just throw mine out. Want it?” Rosie asks, offering him the cup that she had been about to throw out. Harry nods and takes it, he should have someone test it just in case. He might get in trouble for coming here when Ron specifically asked him not to, but if he finds something that will help them get Draco back it’ll be worth it.
They eventually broke apart for air, and Harry went back to Dracos neck, "perhaps I can be persuaded to stay a few minutes," Draco whispered, and Harry leaned back to grin at him.
This also means I'm not done writing it so updates may be a while. I have the next few chapters but that's it, hopefully you enjoy enough to wait for updates :D!!
“Even I know you’re not so cruel as to fake… fake this,” Draco says, looking up at Harry for a moment. Harry looks equal amounts relieved and scared out of his mind.
As soon as they're out the door, Harry lets out a deep breath. They walk in complete silence, until someone walks into Harry. A tall man in a black coat, far too warm for the weather Harry thinks.
“I can’t- it’s just a blurry mess. There’s… It’s you, and-and your family I’m assuming,” Draco mumbles, backing up and pulling himself from Harry's grip. Harry lets it happen, leaning back to watch Draco.
be married,” Draco says, and he places his now empty teacup onto the table in front of him harshly as if to prove his point somehow. He glances up at Harry who looks a little hurt. Whatever, it’s not his responsibility to feed into his deranged delusions.
Rosie slides up to him, smirking, and Harry almost jumps out of his skin. Good thing he never took up being an auror, he would've been terrible. He doesn't know how his reflexes got so bad.
"Just owl me if he comes back, okay?" Harry said, before he left. He checked on Scorpius, who was drawing pictures at the kitchen table.
Theo opened his mouth to respond but Harry beat him to it, "Theo comes by almost every morning to feed me coffee and breakfast. We saw each other at that event a while ago and got to talking, remember? I'm not going to die over some cinnamon buns," Harry said, mock offended.
Harry gestured towards the coffee cup, “I think this coffee is mixed with a potion of some sorts that makes Draco forget everything,” he explains, and tells her about the man he saw. Hermione nods solemnly.
It’s a few hours and cups of tea later that Draco finally stirs, groaning loudly and rubbing at his temple, “christ I’m never drinking again,” he mumbles and sits up, blinking away the sleep. He then seems to realize where he is and gasps, “where the fuck am I?” he says in a panic, looking around. It’s then he sees the two figures staring at him in shock, and flinches away.
Ron looks at Harry, sees the desperation, the determination but mostly the pure longing to see his husband again. Ron is nodding before his brain even catches up, "fine. You can come, but you have to be careful okay?"
Draco takes a second to breathe, but before he can try to rationalize anything that's happening the floo lights up and a small boy comes barrelling out. The boy is blonde, and he has tears running down his cheeks. He looks desperately around the room, spotting Draco.
Harry leaves soon after that, he had only been there for a bit to visit and then he had to pick Scorp up. He isn’t sure how he keeps getting away with making portkeys but he thinks it has something to do with the starry eyed look in the workers that help him. He arrives at the school as usual, picks up his son, and then arrives home safely. Harry is about to start making dinner when suddenly Scorp bursts into tears. Harry hugs him and asks him what’s wrong.
Draco just hopes they leave him alone. He's not in a good mood today, he's been getting headaches like crazy recently and it's pissing him off. Just as he thinks that a strike of pain goes through his head and he hisses, almost stumbling from the sudden burst of pain. He balances himself on a nearby shelf and puts his hand on his forehead.
Theo slides up next to Harry, bumping their shoulders. Harry jumps, not realizing he was so close, “what was that about?” He asks, glancing at the door where Ron has just exited.
“We need to find out the effects of the potion he’s been drinking for months now, they’re clearly hurting him,” Hermione says, also sounding like she’s seconds from sobbing. Draco hates how they’re all
He sniffs indignantly and turns towards Ron, “If you must know…. I…” his headache comes back full force for a second and he cringes, taking a breath, and it goes away in a second, “-I closed up the library where I am currently employed and went home, decided to have a bit of a drink, and got a bit carried away. Imagine my surprise when I woke up… wherever we are,” He answers, and neither of the other occupants seem to have liked the answer.
Harry dropped Scorpius off at Mollys house early the next day, along with Ron and Hermione dropping Rose and Hugo off. Scorp had been ecstatic to find out he was staying with Molly for the night, and almost screamed when he found out Rose and Hugo were going too. He didn't even bother asking why. Harry, Ron and Hermione met back up at Harry's house.
Harry peers through the books again and sees the two of them speaking for a moment before the man gives Draco some sort of drink. Draco says something and then takes a big sip, and Harry’s heart is beating a mile a minute. He instinctively reaches for his wand, and it’s not a second later that Draco crumbles to the ground. Harry jumps to action, instinctively casting stupefy at the coffee guy, who hadn’t noticed him. After the man falls to the ground Harry rushes to Draco’s side, making sure he’s alive.
“You know me, I couldn’t stop myself from seeing him,” Harry defends himself, “anyways, it was a good thing anyways.”
"Married! A tragic tale, who is this man! One word and I'll beat him up," Rosie says, pretending to roll up nonexistent sleeves.
he's going to find you, probably at your house. Which is scarier?" Rosie says, and Draco refuses to answer. He glances at the other customers. Two of them seem to be in a heated discussion and the third is staring right at him. He feels his heart swoop before he quickly averts his eyes. He's probably staring at Rosie, it's not the first time a customer has found her attractive. Rosie noticed this and also turns towards the customers.
Hermione pauses, "oh he's kind of useless, he doesn't know where he got the dye. Im sure him and Draco would be birds of a feather, if you say Draco doesn't even know what hair dye is," she chuckles, hoping the comment isn't weird or suspicious. She just wants to keep the topic on Draco, find out as much as she can.
"Oh wow, you must be new. Spencer McDonald is super in love with Draco right now, basically the whole town knows about it after he tried to do a really grand gesture in the middle of town and Draco just walked away," she laughs at the memory, "word spreads fast in such a small town."
Draco was in the middle of trying to avoid Spencer when the door jingled three times in a row. Why would the three new customers not just walk in all at once? He sighed.
"This is harassment. I already told you, I never dated Harry. He's a stupid know-it-all and I haven't seen him in years. Besides, he's married," Draco says, ignoring the sharp intake of breath from the direction of the customers. He glances towards them and sees that they're all talking now. Why in the world didn't they come in all at once if they knew each other?
"For the last time Mrs. Jones, you never returned that book, it would've been entered into the system," Draco explains for what must be the tenth time today. Jones looks like she might burst, her face has gone an impressive sort of red.
“Christ, will the two of you just get on with it!” He shouts, as Hermione changes seats again. The three of them turn to him and Harry cringes. The longer they stall, the more Draco feels like whatever they want to tell him is something awful. He hopes nothing terrible has happened to his mother, the two of them haven’t spoken in a while. Draco feels a bit guilty about that, but he left for a good reason.
Draco stepped away, moving towards the door, "sorry Harry but I really must be getting to work. I only came by to tell you mum wants to have Scorp for the weekend. Have fun with your knick knacks and your secret friendships and your cinnamon buns," before Harry could even question him on that he was out the door and apparating away.
"Nerd," He murmured, and before Draco could respond their lips were pressed together. Draco flicked the back of Harry's neck at the comment but otherwise didn't respond. He did respond however, to the kiss. It quickly got heated, and Draco threaded his fingers in Harry's hair.
"Tea?" Draco asked, gesturing towards the teapot and cups he had set up prior. Terrence nodded and Draco waved his hands, charming the teapot to pour two cups, "any sugar?" Draco asked, as his tea came gently floating towards him. At this Terrence shook his head no, and his own tea floated until it stopped in front of him.
Scorp sees the paint on his fingers and grins, “you painted! Is it me? Paint me! And papa! With a dragon!” he shouts, climbing onto Harry’s back. Harry laughs and tells him about the painting.
“It’s lucky you were here to catch it, I can’t imagine what would have happened if you hadn’t been here.”
Rosie smiles softly and turns to look at him dealing with another costumer. He seems to be in a better mood than the last time Harry came, possibly because the month ended. He desperately wants to know more about the headaches, if they have anything to do with the memory loss. He hopes it's nothing serious, and maybe it’s an indication that whatever has messed with his memories is temporary. He doesn’t like the implication that it’ll hurt to get his memories back.
"Draco doesn't really talk to me about his past a lot, but the way he acts when people flirt with him is a dead giveaway," Rosie says, and honestly if Draco had told her his past then she probably would've blurted it all to the first person to ask. It's a good thing Rosie isn't magic, she would've blown their cover a long time ago.
Hermione nodded, she was already holding a book about memory loss spells and charms, no doubt having read something about memory potions the night previous. Harry was practically vibrating with excitement, and nodded as his stomach preformed flips of nervousness.
Harry is painting in the workshop section of his store. Business is a little slow, so he’s humming to himself. Theodore is in the store, walking around the shop as he does every once in a while. He’s usually stood next to Harrys painting station, leaning against a wall. But obviously that gets a little boring, as Theo has a habit of grabbing some random item off the shelves and asking Harry about it.
“But we have Draco, there's no way he can get through our wards, plus we’re adding a few extra here just in case…. If Draco gets his memory back before we figure out who it is, he can help us by telling us exactly what happened, so we have leads. Everything will be fine, alright?” Ron says, giving Harry a reassuring look. Harry briefly wonders when Ron became so mature and when he himself became a panicked disaster. Probably when his husband was kidnapped, he answers himself internally, and hates himself for it.
"Welcome! Welcome! Uh, welcome! Take your time!" Rosie said, also clearly thrown off by the weird order. Draco tried to speed walk over to her, behind the counter, but Spencer got to him before he could get there.
Once Theo was out the door, Draco felt some of the tension leave his body. Harry, ever the clueless, simply turned and kissed him on the cheek and smirked, "now where were we?" He asked, moving a step closer.
son?” Harry nods again, and Draco shakes his head lightly, “how could we have ever gotten together? How could you have forgiven me?” he asks quietly, remembering the other people in the room.
Ron sighs for a while, “bugger me, you’re sure you don’t want to become an auror?” Ron asks, and then he calls back to Hermione that he’s going to Harry’s and that she should join them once she’s done eating.
Harry was at home, about to start cooking supper for his family when an owl arrived. He didn't recognize it, and quickly grabbed a treat for it. He handed the owl the treat, patted its head and untied the letter from its foot. Weird, the letter was from Scorpius' school. Today was Dracos day to pick Scorp up, and Harry was a little curious as to why it was taking so long. He unfolded the letter.
"Harry, it won't be good for business if you're caught snogging someone right where you work," Draco said, putting his finger over Harry's mouth when he attempted another kiss. Harry frowned.
"Maybe obliviation, but even then they're just a vague sense of what happened. Draco sounds far too sure that Harry is a straight man married to Ginny," Hermione explains, and Harry's heart does not calm down even a little bit.
“C’mon, papas tired. He’ll come tuck you in later, but could you please go back to Grandma Mollys? I’m sure the other kids miss you, and we have some, er, adult stuff to take care of. I promise you’ll see him later today,” Harry says, gently prying the child away from Draco. He speaks softly and kindly, and Draco is yet again finding himself lost in an unnamed emotion.
After their first visit, Ron tells Harry that he can't be too involved with the case, since he's too close and may become irrational. Harry doesn't listen until Hermione, glossy eyed, tells him that he might ruin the whole process if he does anything impulsive.
Draco takes a sip if only so he doesn’t say something stupid and land himself a free ride to St. Mungos. He’s shocked to find the tea exactly to his liking, and the ache burns a little hotter.
Draco hesitantly takes the picture frame, irrationally afraid of looking at it. He peers down at it and sees the same blurry mess he got earlier trying to take a peek. He squints and tries to focus, and manages to see a grinning Harry, but trying to focus on the other people present in the family photo leaves him with an intense headache. He drops the picture frame and it crashes to the floor, he grabs his head and hisses.
Harry is pacing his living room, glancing over at the unconscious body on his couch intermittently. He knows Draco’s not injured or dying, a healer had looked him over and promised that he just had a bit of sleeping draught, and he’d be awake in no time. This didn’t stop Harry from worrying, chewing his nails and tugging at his hair. He cast a quick tempus, and realized it hadn't been three minutes since he last checked. Alright, he needs to calm down. He forces himself to stop pacing and takes a deep calming breath, trying not to spiral.
He hears the ring of the bell soon after and hopes that it's Neville leaving and not simply a new customer entering. When he doesn't hear Rosie greet anyone he lets out a breath. Then the door jingles again and Draco peeks around the corner to see Spencer McDonald sauntering in with a grin on his face.
Harry does notice that the more time goes by, Draco gets more easily annoyed as his headaches act up. Then almost exactly one month later, the same man Harry had seen brings the workers coffee again. Rosie again doesn’t drink hers, but Draco does and it’s like his headache is cured. Harry notes it for later, but his immediate theory is that the man may be the one putting him here and the coffee is laced with something that erases his real memories. It’s a huge conclusion to jump to, but Harry can’t see how Draco could suddenly recover because of the man twice.
Harry smiles into his own cup, things are really starting to look up for them, he’s hopeful and excited.
They manage to find Draco but he seems to have false memories, and Harry fears they'll never return.
“None of your business,” remembering to reassure himself and telling the Weasel are two different things.
Harry is silently boiling with rage, but he doesn't let it show on his borrowed features, "guys like that are the worst," he mutters, but it's not entirely true. Draco had once been like that, a spoiled brat who got what he wanted or made everyone suffer for it. Harry hopes he isn't being hypocritical when all he does is think fondly of those days and already hates Spencer for it.
“Scorp, papa loves you more than anything in the entire world, he’s just very busy. He probably writes you everyday, but maybe the letters just can’t reach us?” Harry isn’t sure if he’s helping or making it worse, but it’s all he can think of to say.
“Um- well-” Ron finally spoke, rubbing the back of his neck, “for starters, you’re not a suspect for anything right now… what do you remember from today?” Ron asks, and Draco crosses his arms, and realizes they’ve left him his wand. Dumb… but well, he’s not stupid enough to try to escape an auror and someone who’s been out for his demise since day one. He glares at Ron and racks his brain to remember every detail he can up until he woke up wherever he is.
Harry sees something and comes up with a theory, which means he has to reveal to Ron that he’s been seeing Draco
“I hope this nightmare will end soon,” he mutters, and Hermione reaches across the table to rest a hand on his chest, smiling supportively. Ron nods his head and gives a weak smile.
He quickly left Dracos office and checked the nearby bathroom for him. No luck. He told Dracos assistant that he was gone. She looked panicked.
"Anything else? Did Draco seem worried, scared, or... guilty?" He asks, sparing a glance to Harry who furrows his eyebrows. He had been the only one to never entertain the idea that Draco ran away on his own.
"How does he have false memories?" Ron asks, and Hermione stays silent. For once, she has no answer for them.
"Mr. Potter! Scorpius is right over there," she said, pointlessly. There was literally only one other child. Scorp noticed his dad and grinned. He ran up to Harry and gave him a hug.
“I don’t think papa loves me anymore!” He cries, “he’s been gone almost forever and he won’t give me a letter back when I write him!”
"I want to go with you guys," Harry declares and before Ron can even finish sighing he continues, "I won't... do anything stupid or impulsive. I just want to see him, it's been four months and I just need to see that he's okay, alright? Please."
Wasn’t going to upload again so soon but the last chapter is really bad but this one is much better and it’s longer so I wanted to upload it as fast as possible.
"Malfoy, I didn't expect to see you here," he mumbled, slowly walking over to Harry, passing him one of the coffee cups and the bag. Harry grinned and pulled it open, eyes twinkling as he saw the cinnamon buns inside.
Clearly, Harry sees right through him somehow, and he reaches towards him for a second before changing his mind and standing up, speaking calmly, “I’ll go fetch you some tea,” he mumbles, and Draco mutely nods, confused beyond all belief as to why Harry seems so concerned, and how he had managed to see through him so easily. He looks towards the far wall and calms himself down by rationalising it as Harry simply making an excuse to distance himself from Draco, and he probably has some sort of privacy charm on the photos so that Draco can’t see his personal life. Draco also ignores the pang of upset that the thought conjures.
"I don't know," he said honestly. He quickly set a charm so the food would cook itself. He didn't like doing it that way, and it never turned out the same as when he cooked the muggle way, but he knew he couldn't focus on cooking at the moment. He fire-called everyone he could think of, Dracos mother, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, even Ron and Hermione, asking them if they had seen Draco.
Spencer simply shrugged and leaned against the counter, grinning from ear to ear at Draco, "you've captured my heart," he states and Draco has to force himself not to grimace. Rosie sighs.
"Sorry!" He mumbled before quickly walking behind the counter to hide- no stand, next to Rosie. Rosie smiled at Spencer and lifted an eyebrow.
“Wow, that must really be true. I haven’t seen you paint in a long time. New muse, perhaps?” Theo leans against a nearby wall, watching Harry set up. Harry likes to paint while he has customers, it seems to encourage them to buy little trinkets and maybe a painting or two. He certainly undercharges his skills, but neither he nor Draco have ever had to struggle for money so he doesn’t see the point in charging hundreds for a single painting.
“Well… It’s kind of a long story… and you may not believe it,” Ron starts, and Draco calms himself down of the burst of anxiety that the sentence produces. He takes another sip of the tea and hates how it actually manages to calm him. He forces himself to relax and closes his eyes after the sip, smelling the tea to focus on the sense. When he opens his eyes Harry is watching him as if he’s about to keel over at any moment, Hermione seems to be wiping tears out of her eyes and Ron stands awkwardly with his hands in his pockets, fake casual.
“I would need to know your preference in order to recommend something, don’t you think? What’s your favourite genre, let’s start there,” Draco says, and that’s a voice Harry recognizes. His professional and helpful voice, which he uses at his
"You know I'll always return for you my love," he calls before he leaves the library. Draco visibly deflates, and pinches the bridge of his nose.
“So, the cup did have a potion in it, but it wasn’t any sort of potion that we’re aware of,” Ron starts, voice low. Harry’s shoulders slump and he is about to say something but Ron interrupts him, “but there’s a lot of common ingredients with other memory based potions, and this gives us a lead, it’d have to be someone with knowledge of potions and access to the ingredients.”
He looks at Draco again, seemingly sleeping peacefully. Thank Merlin for that at least. He sits down in front of Draco, gently pushing a stray strand of hair off his forehead. He really is beautiful, and Harry had missed him so much. He had managed to see him quite a few times after they found him, but seeing him back in their house, the home they chose and share, overwhelms Harry and he drops his head onto Dracos slowly rising and falling chest, refusing to let the tears fall. He has no reason to cry anymore, Draco is safe with him and he’ll never let this happen again.
“A very mean dragon,” Harry agrees, and Scorp nods. He grabs some paper and begins writing his daily letter, more determined than ever. Harry smiles as he watches him work. He suddenly remembers the now extremely cold coffee he had taken from Rosie, and decides to quickly get it to Ron, if it’ll get Draco back any sooner. He gets up to fire-call him, leaving Scorp to his work.
Ron is about to open his mouth to speak when another figure floos into the room, and Draco spots a very happy looking Granger appear. Well, maybe she’s a Weasley now.
Harry continues to go to the bookshop a couple times a week, while hoping he doesn’t go while Ron and Hermione are trying to get information. So far he’s been lucky, but he tries not to stay too long. Draco and him have been growing closer, something Harry didn’t expect to have to work for again. Draco seems comfortable around him, and it’s his theory that he’s like that because his subconscious recognizes it as Harry, his husband. He had also introduced himself, quite stupidly, as “Ha-Henry,” and Rosie had taken to fake stuttering every time she said his name.
"Draco!" Neville seemingly recovers, but Draco flinches at the sound of his own name. Why in the world is he using "Draco" instead of "Malfoy"? As far as Draco could remember, they were never on a first name basis, "what are you doing here! Harry's worried sick, everyone's been looking for you!" Neville says as he rushed over.
“Well, I have to be honest here, I... er,” he cringes, “I’ve been visiting Draco in secret,” he takes a moment to look back and make sure Scorp hasn’t heard him, and when he looks back at Ron he winces at the defeated look on his face.
Theo grins, “flattery will get you everywhere, Harry! I made it myself,” he explains, and Harry nods, impressed.
He walks into his shop, barely acknowledging all the people who wave to him as he walks. He enters the shop and opens it, later than usual. Not very many customers show up, probably due to the late start. As the day continues, Harry is stuck thinking of his visit to Draco. He can’t help the smile that rests on his face for the majority of the day, which Theo comments on when he shows up to give Harry lunch.
," he explains, and before Rosie can respond Draco gestures to the customers, "and those people are just standing there talking. They clearly need help, so one of us has to go over and I don't feel like dealing with people right now."
Draco fears what she might shout this time, and wonders whether she would calmly leave or start screaming again. Apparently Draco didn't have to worry, as his coworker comes to the rescue. Rosalinda Mathusla, or as everyone called her, Rosie, gives Jones her sweetest fake smile. Rosie just has a way with the customers that Draco could never understand.
He leads Harry to a section of books and Harry half listens as he explains the plot, simply happy to hear his voice again. Harry nods and takes the first book of the series, again following behind as Draco leads him to check it out.
He pulls the child away from their hug, but he doesn’t let go, again holding this child's head in his hands, wiping away his tears with his thumbs. The boy has the same haircut that he had when he was about that age, Draco can’t help but notice. He stares in astonishment, “It’s pronounced floo,” is all he manages to say, remembering that he said he came from the flow.
It takes a bit for Ron to answer, and he does so with spaghetti sauce on the corner of his mouth, “what’s up, mate?” He says, and Harry takes a beat to respond.
Draco gasps loudly as the child runs up to him and throws himself onto him, “Papa you’ve been gone forever I was scared that you didn’t love us anymore! Grandma said I couldn’t come because you needed rest but I couldn’t wait to see you! I saw Auntie Hermione use the flow and when Grandma was looking away I came here so I could see you, I love you!”
Before he could respond, the door to Harry's shop was opened, the bell at the top ringing for all to hear. Harry jumped back away from Draco, who was adjusting his clothes as if they had somehow gotten rumpled.
"I'm sure we can be done by then," Harry licked his way up Dracos neck, nibbling on his earlobe. Draco bit his lip.
Harrys heart swoops rather impressively, and he takes a steadying breath, “Soon, Scorp, soon,” he answers, and hopes with all his heart, so much so that it hurts, that hes right.
Rosie gives her a once over, "wow I never would've guessed! Sad to say, Draco doesn't dye his hair. I'm not sure he even knows what hair dye is! Does your red head friend know any place? I'm assuming that red isn't natural," Rosie continues, glancing back at Ron and Harry.
But why? When there’s people who love him. Who care for him? Like Narcissa Malfoy, who was the most purest person Harry had ever known. Well, apparently until now.
Now, he’s sitting on the hills with Astoria, in front of River Ouse in Yorkshire. He’s staring at her, the wind is dancing with her brown hair and it’s like waves of a sea. Her eyes are blue and they rest on the sky, looking at the stars and she smiles.
“Maybe we could learn to love the other,” Ginny continued quietly, hesitantly. “It will take time of course, and it... might not be the easiest thing to do but... we can try?”
No one else is here in the shop except them. The whole place is made of wood, and the room is filled with the smell of fresh scrolls and something sweet, much like caramel. Draco looks around, seeing several birds and cats, some snakes and frogs in their cages, containers or aquariums, and the noise of them doesn’t make him irritated, but rather cheerful.
When Draco showed him Pestilence’s card, Theo couldn’t even look at it. He was so scared he couldn't sleep for three months. His father couldn’t even touch the card.
“My host, Voldemort, somehow figured it out how to control me– and when he mastered that ability, he made me kill Regulus,” he stopped for a moment and asked, “Do you know what happens to a Horseman if they kill another Horseman, Draco?”
“The only thing you need is to read this by the end of the week.” Professor Snape said and then waved his hands at him. “You are dismissed.”
People started to gather around when they saw him fell. When they heard him fail. Everyone cheered, clapped and shouted because it was over. They had won and that’s when he realized something.
As he walked out of the Manor’s Cemetery, feeling the rain on him, hearing his footsteps on the grass, looking up to the grey sky, he could feel nothing.
Famine caressed his hair, while Pestilence touched his neck in the most gentle way as possible. “We’ll meet again when Draco dies,” Famine whispered softly. “Wherever you’ll end up, that’s where I’ll be.”
Everyone else is inside, gathered together because it is over. They have won, it is over. They can celebrate, renovate, grieve and meet their loved ones again. They are in there with warmth and peace.
Draco spat out his hot chocolate and then furiously turned around just to find himself staring at Theodore’s smugly ass face.
She brought the pumpkin juice close to her lips and tried not to focus on the nerve–racking attention she was getting – had been getting since she and Harry were a thing.
“You!” Theo pointed at Draco and then at Weasley. “You owe me so big Draco Malfoy, you have no idea! This red animal almost killed me–”
And the moment it sinks in, is the exact moment, when Robards spits out his coffee right onto the newspaper he has been reading.
Liliana still didn’t open her eyes, but Harry felt her arms around him in the next moment. He hugged her back.
Dudley looked at him a minute, and then just shrugged. This wasn’t the first example when Harry did something strange. It won’t be the last either.
Draco furrowed his brows and looked around in the dark house, just to see Cedric standing next to him, giving out a sad smile with sorrowful eyes.
For Draco, all the little or meaningless memories of other people will dissolve one day. Evaporate as if they have never been there. A memory that has a deep impression is the one that stays.
“Everyone knows by now that there’s someone out there who’s making people do things that are against their wills.” Harry started not looking at Draco at all. He feared if he’d see his expression, he’ll be crushed. “It doesn’t matter if he’s a light wizard or a dark wizard. No one can do this to anyone.”
But there are times. Times when Draco is one step behind, or simply turns around just the right way to catch the glimpse of what it really means to be powerful.
Draco feels her grip tighten and he smiles a little. Millicent then lets him go and goes through her present yet again, admiring the pastel paints, holding an orange colored tube. Draco finds himself holding one or two as well, admiring the beauty of them.
Fred Weasley did a turn and caressed his cape with his hands. “I’m the First of the Three Spirits.” He grinned childishly. “The Spirit of Christmas Past and you,” he caught Draco’s arm who gulped with wide eyes. “Are going to take a walk with me.”
He nipped his leather gloves a bit, playing with them but not taking off them. He knew if he takes them off,
“Can you explain why Relna’s decorating an atrocious Christmas tree in the hall at seven in the morn–” Pansy stopped when he saw Blaise next to Draco.
Blaise happens looked genuine and Draco felt lighter and lighter. Then Blaise let go of him and pulled out a big scroll from his bag and gave it to Draco with a hesitant smile. Draco took it and examined it.
For a moment there, Draco thinks he sees his parents’ expression, when he has pressed down that key for the first time. Or someone who has seen something for the first time, up close.
Harry stared at him for what he felt like a couple of minute, although he was sure, for Dolohov, it felt like hours.
Malfoy couldn’t have been a horcrux. If he were, Harry couldn’t have killed the beast. He isn’t immortal either, Harry’s magic could have sensed that.
Walk with force, Father used to say. But Draco has forgotten how to look ahead and walk forward with purpose a long time ago.
The rumor said, if you look into his eyes then you’ll see the Devil with horns and big wings. You have to repeat yourself ‘Do not look. Do not look. Do not look’ because if you do, you’ll go insane.
Eliza saw right through him during the second task, during that pouring rain, on that inevitable day.
“What’s so interesting in that crowd, Lady Malfoy?” the mocking voice makes Draco take a deep breath, already feeling irritated. Mother looks back, her face is unreadable. “I know it’s hard to concentrate when you’re faced with your sins, but at least try for the sake of us, okay?”
So he let out his smoke and stared back at Malfoy with fire burning eyes. Glowing, abyss green. Making him see his wish. His eyes were full of promises about breaking bones and burning people alive. And he grinned, his eyes were alive. Lightning up.
“You were the first wizard of his age he ever met on that day.” He said with gold eyes and Draco felt the ground vanish beneath him.
“Do you think that it’s normal if you burn alive your father?” Theo said and Draco shut down his eyes, trying hard to not look at the other boy. “It’s not, but sometimes people have no choice. I’m hella cool and you’re hella cool, so what’s the problem here?”
The Professor stared into his emerald eyes, but she couldn’t hold it after some minutes. She stepped away from the piano, giving more space for Harry.
He still didn’t feel a lot of things. But he swore he could feel something stir up inside of his soul and he wanted to wake it up, wanted to pour gasoline on it so that it could blend inside of his lungs and then burn
Harry forgot how to breathe as he sat up on the bench where he had been lying down, and then turned to Fred to hug him.
It wasn't one of her Woodpeckers who had lied. It was Mildred herself. For what reason? Harry had no idea, but he didn’t need to know.
Harry and Malfoy looked at the other, when they said the word at the same time. Harry then looked away from Malfoy’s eyes, to stare at Dudley’s.
Voldemort didn’t look away, his dark eyes never looked away. “Interesting,” he said slowly, and then pointed at Lucius without turning away. “Get him from the grave and hold him down with Bella.”
There is a rumor which was made up on a basic case. There was a monster he had to kill, because her power slowly made her go insane and the woman started to eat herself. Lucia was so strong and fast, he had hard time catching her. When he did, the woman wanted to bite him and eat his arm off.
Into the deep abyss, into the red flames, the glory of a broken halo. Also venom, tar, shadow and cold, bones wrecking in every edge.
He saw his father. His long light – blonde hair, his grey eyes – like Draco’s – and for a moment he couldn’t breathe. Everything stopped and he didn’t know how could he make it go again.
Harry picked up the pace and gave it spine, or wings like feather to a bird. Draco kept up with his melody and then they joined and–
“What do you think why I visited you at the cemetery?” Harry asked. “Besides the fact that I wanted to do something, trying not to think about the fight between me and my friends?”
His blind eye twitched and he slowly turned his head to his left. It was a dark cell, with a quiet person.
Harry understood, he really did. If anyone had ever understood grief, it was him. But he told him so many times, that by now, he had been only echoing himself since what it felt like an eternity.
PS: Have any of you watched Psycho-Pass? The anime? Cause if not then WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!! GO WATCH IT!! It is such a masterpiece with complex characters, a great FEMALE main lead, and the villain!!! Oh my god, it has such a mastermind villain and you don't know who you're rooting for and jesus christ, kids, watch Psycho-Pass!!
He clenched his fist with shaking hands and he bit his lips. The shouts were starting to get louder, but he felt something deep in his heart. Something repulsive and disgusting.
Rhododendrons were planted around the piano, curling up the piano stool with their large petals, light shade of purple and white. There were hundreds of Amaryllis, purple and white with crimson veins.
Charlie had been braiding his own hair, but now stopped. He looked the most confused person alive, and Harry had to suppress the laughter in his chest. “What do I think? Why are you asking me?”
He was staring rather openly at Harry while he walked close to him. Harry just tilted his head, being patient. He must have been giving off a cold aura, so he stretched out his hand and the man took it without question.
The colorful lights shone on him, making wings and halos and Harry cupped his cheeks and leaned forward with strength and power.
Kuma Lisa Fridays were always taken place around the second and the last week of the month. No one really knew what it meant – no one knew it was a code –, except the members of the Order of the Phoenix.
He felt her magic fly back in her body, wanting to escape and get away from him as quickly as possible, like if he was the Plague.
“You don’t need to be scared of me, you know.” He said, folding his arms across his chest. “I only need to kill two guys, then I’m done.” Harry wasn’t surprised by the emptiness of his tone and that scared him a little. This made him panic so he locked away the feeling as soon as he felt it. He knew it from the bottom of his mind that this was wrong but he didn’t want to feel these things. He just didn’t.
Draco loves her so much and it must show on his smile because Astoria leans closer for one last kiss. One last kiss before it’s over, before they end, before they go back to who they were before their first kiss.
Harry is unsure of what to say next so he stops and looks at Ron, waiting for a response. Ron is looking at Harry contemplatively. Slowly he crosses the room and stops a short distance in front of him.
After the’ve both showered (separately, Harry blushes at the mere thought of that) the two boys make their way down the familiar path down the street. After he convinces Malfoy to get out of bed, he promises him a good breakfast. And since Harry isn’t exactly a tour guide of muggle London, he settles on taking Malfoy to Starbucks, the only place he knows really.
Hermione looks at them both with sympathy, and if she notices the wrecked bed and clothes strewn around the flat she doesn’t mention it. Ron crosses the room with a tray of drinks from Starbucks and hands one to Draco who takes it robotically.
“What’s wrong?” he asks softly, leaning his head closer to Malfoy’s and giving him a light push with his shoulder, hoping it will warm the other boy.
This is too much, he can feel his face burning. Harry stands up from the table abruptly and Malfoy’s hand falls away, his friends seem startled and Hermione catches a glass before it can spill.
Sighing, Harry turns back around and marches in the direction of the Slytherin table. Cries from his fellow Gryffindors follow him, but he ignores it. He ignores them all. The questions, sneers, stares, everything. He ignores everything until his sinks onto the Slytherin bench across from Malfoy.
Without looking to see Malfoy’s reaction, Harry exits the great hall and follows Ron into an abandoned classroom. Hermione is already in there and stands when Harry and Ron walk in, anxiously smoothing down the front of her robes.
"This is where I can find some of the serum." He told the pair, then he meticulously looked through the shelves.
When the food arrived, Hermione and Harry smirked each other, eager to see the reaction their boyfriends would have had upon tasting pizza for the first time.
"Ah ah." Harry said, after noticing that his boyfriend had grabbed his butt. "We have to get changed. And besides, Viridis is watching." he said, pointing to the judging owl in front of them.
Draco got up from the black leather sofa he was sitting on and walked closer to the entrance to the Common Room.
"I told you, I have done nothing with him. He kissed me right in front of you just to break us apart, I'm sure. He's the one who had a plan, if anything. " said Draco, looking into Harry's eyes, risking to lose himself.
"You're just so unbelievably cute, all angry and unexperienced." Harry said, wrapping his arms around his lover.
Harry's breath caught in his throat at the sight of his fiancé. He could have sworn that he had never seen him more attractive than he was in that moment.
His fiancè's intervention was what it took to make him smile and forget about his anxiety for public speaking.
"On our left we have ze Hollyheard Harpies!" the head of the Magical games shouted, pointing his hand at the Welsh team.
"Dear, are you sure we can invest our total trust into him?" he asked her, apparently not convinced of his loyalty.
The rest of the match was breathtaking. Gwenog Jones was a wonderful beater, she never missed a Bludger. Her seeker, Stella, was also pretty amazing, Harry observed.
He found it so ridiculous that Draco could ever like her and he was damn right. But the boy wasn't willing to risk letting him know that he'd been looking at her for so long because he imagined himself as her.
When time to sleep came, he crept into his bed as fast as he could, trying to ignore the other boy in the room, who was already tucked in.
Harry and his two best friends went to the Three Broomsticks, as the Marauders Map had told them that was where Draco was located. Hermione and Ron came as Harry's moral support.
"Let's hit them from here!" The brunette whispered in a loud tone, poking her head out of the hiding spot to get a glimpse of what was happening.
"I am never taking an airplane again!" he grumbled as he got out of the bathroom in the Nantes Airport. He had just been sick there.
She wondered if the other girl's eyes had ever been more beautiful, two crystalline drops of silver.
Ginny tilted her head up and gave Luna a smile. She felt blessed to have her, without her it would have all been much harder. "Thank you, Luna. You're the only one who doesn't hate me around here." She said, taking Luna's hand in hers.
Draco enclosed his bed in a protection charm, just to be safe. He didn't buy the whole 'innocent cuddling' thing in the littlest bit. He was sure, at this point, that it had been an attempt at seducing him. Jean Jacques must have had a problem with Harry, or he was very attracted to Draco.
Shooting Draco a death stare, she tugged on her boyfriend's shirt, motioning for him to come with her.
"Yeah, that's what they all say, right?" Harry laughed in frustration. Then, he froze in horror at the realisation. "Job well done, Malfoy! You really outdid yourself on this one! You're incredibly disgusting!" He shouted.
And the birthday would have turned a ton times better in moments. Now that the match was over, it was time to meet the players.
Harry knew what it felt like to lose someone he loved, having lost a bunch in the previous year alone.
"This is so exciting." said Harry to Draco, as they sat next to each other. "I can't believe we used to play Qudditch together, it feels like yesterday!"
"Who is this whore you're screwing, huh? Is it Luna? Is it Cho? That little..." Ginny kept raising her voice, her face was red and she was a bit sweaty, she was down right infuriated.
The three of them were all outside. Luna was holding her girlfriend's hand and she was jumping feverishly.
"I'm starting to think that, maybe, Jean Jacques is not so wrong, after all... he's right to say that you never make an effort." said Draco. He was now on the verge of tears.
"Well, I can't say that I didn't find your...action creepy. But I suppose, if it's a Beauxbatons tradition, that for you it was 100% innocent. But around here, it's not that ideal. And also, I have a boyfriend, so it's not so nice." Draco said. He didn't really mind the boy's presence on his bed, probably because in the last day he had not really spoken to anyone. Except for Pansy, on occasion. But she wasn't really present lately, she was... Elusive.
He needed to break things, it would numb his brain momentarily. Then , his eyes caught a moving picture of him and Draco ice skating. He took the photo in his hand and threw it to the ground, shattering the glass.
Draco didn't notice him at first. When he did, he froze. He looked into those marvelous emerald green eyes. He would get lost into them upon initial glance, they were his weakness.
"I like it when you hold my hands like this. Also, your body is so close to mine and I love it." Luna purred.
"You can study your stuff with us!" Hermione suggested. The red haired girl seemed to consider the offer for a second but then opted to do her research for the sixth year with Luna.
"I do think it's worth it... Draco, you're so different now, after everything that went down last year and...I feel like I'm growing attached to you...I like you and I wish I could do more with you than just meaningless sex." Draco was a bit taken aback at this. "Potter, I told you. I'm not the boyfriend type."
