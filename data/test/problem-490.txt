"Of course, if we invite all houses, I mean all," Harry grinned. "Anyway, Slytherins can be brave as well, so it's not like we all belong all too specific in the labels of the houses, now do we?" he casually stated in a matter-of-fact tone, directing a smile and a wink his friend's way after he had spoken.
Draco didn't understand why she thought this was so funny but decided to ask her about it later. "Thank you," he merely said, giving her a small nod.
Harry pulled his sweater back down, making sure he didn't look that messed up before holding his hand out for the other to take.
Harry ignored his squeaking voice, ignored how his cheeks burned. Going outside seemed like a wonderful option right now.
He probably did, but that wasn't as satisfying as nagging Potter. Or rather, a lot less entertaining. Right now he wasn't joking, the essay didn't make sense. As much of a drama queen as he could be, Draco did strive for good results. He wasn't as pushy with it as Granger, but it did grant him good grades. Potions wasn't an exception. He was very suitable to help Potter, but why would he do that? Maybe if there were something to gain…
Malfoy looked down and let out a short, sniffy laugh. He'd almost forgotten that Pansy did care about him. She just rarely showed it. It was nice to have her tell him this, because he hadn't realized it himself. "Okay, okay fine," he said. "Glad you're happy because I'm happy then."
A look of surprise had crossed over Ron's face as Malfoy referred to his friend as 'Harry' rather than 'Potter' in his explanation. He had listened intently to the other, just like Harry did himself. While Malfoy seemed genuine about the things he said, the red-haired boy just felt weird about it. After all the things he had done, he seemed so genuinely guilty yet way too calm about it. Yet he was talking about Malfoy, he had never really understood that guy. Then again Malfoy was also only human, he realized. Malfoy could make mistakes like he could. Humans instinctively picked up things around them, so it could have been instinct to follow his dad's shadow and help Voldemort.
Draco felt himself stiffen instantly at the mention of his mother. "We haven't… I haven't spoken much with her ever since the war. It's become a touchy subject to my parents anyway…" Draco wasn't sure what Potter was referring to.
"I'm sure the news will spread quickly then, Hogwarts does like its gossip." Draco smiled faintly. "Though, I'm used to Slytherin parties. And I'm not sure if you've heard what they're like, but if you invite Slytherins, you invite what they bring with them. They'll come, I'm sure if the party's interesting enough."
There had been a period, just before the war, when Draco had been neglecting himself just like Potter had done. With voldemort occupying his mind, his father engulfed in shady business, a war coming up and heavy responsibilities pressing upon his shoulders, he'd fallen into terrible habits. He'd completely ignored himself and become an empty, walking shell. Just a face with nothing behind it. Eventually, the stress and poor self-care had to lead up to a burn-out, which had left him stuck in his bed for weeks. Draco looked back at Harry and put his thoughts aside.
Ah yes. Decorations. This time he didn't speak but just went off towards the Slytherin table to ask around. Wasn't he eager now? If he were honest though, he just didn't like the closure that had displayed between the two Slytherins just now and wanted to be away from it. He didn't like how he felt angry, he had no right to be anyway. Trying to fling his thought out the window was what he was simply doing now as he tried to check off the list for the party. Though if he were to keep himself busy with that event, the list had to grow even longer, didn't it?
When Draco finally started to wake up, the first thing he noticed was the absence of warmth. He shifted a little and moved a hand towards the place where the warmth should be, but only found empty sheets. It took him a while to fully wake up and realize that he was actually looking for Potter and that he'd already left.
"Anyway," Draco broke the silence, "I still believe it's best to get someone or something to accompany you. If that something happens to be me, all you have to do is ask." Yes, he had actually just offered to sleep with Potter. That sounded incredibly wrong. All of this felt incredibly wrong, but he couldn't help himself anymore. After all, he would gain something from it too. He'd noticed how much easier it was to sleep when he was not alone, how much better it felt. Now he couldn't ask Pansy to do this, and none of his other friends were close enough to even be considered for that task. He'd done it with Potter before, so he seemed to be the only option left.
She got up and darted through the chairs and tables towards the exit. Malfoy followed her, but then asked her to wait for a bit and fetched his coat from his room. Pansy decided it might be smart to follow his example, and when they were both geared up for the icy weather outside they finally left.
Draco found himself at a loss of words for a moment. Fear was creeping up his spine, accompanied by worry and panic. It had indeed been blunt to ask a thing like this, he'd made a mistake. He had to fix this. "I just thought, well, it seemed like… " Where in the world was his mind? He had to get himself back together before he lost Potter's respect completely.
Yeah. That was right. He had a lot on his mind with all the homework piling up one on another. Worrying about his relationship with Malfoy didn't help. Maybe… Maybe he should just let it rest for a while.
In his mind, old memories flashed by until it kept hanging on his two friends. Instead of concluding 'I should have more friends to spend my time with' his mind shifted to the whole other side of the story. "Or I have to find a Hermione to my Ron," he mumbled with a somewhat spotting tone.
Now that Harry was so close, Draco could actually hear his heartbeat. And it didn't just beat, no it was racing. He was probably very nervous, or something like that. Malfoy didn't think too much of it, he didn't want to disturb the peaceful silence that surrounded them. He probably wasn't able to sleep yet, but that didn't matter. He wanted to linger at this moment for a while, completely latch onto the other's warmth, and enjoy being with someone. Merlin, he had craved for a feeling like this. He had craved to be appreciated and hugged, to be personal with someone.
The sudden movement caused Draco to slowly wake up. It took him a while to figure out where he was, how he'd come here and what exactly had happened, but when he did, he immediately sat up. His eyes instantly met those of the black-haired boy, who seemed to be in the same panic as Draco was. He didn't know what to say and merely gaped at him, still very tired and a bit drowsy. After a while, he luckily found some words.
He offered a small smile the blonde's way before turning around again to listen to Hermione. Ron was chewing away on his food and didn't seem bothered by her rant and all he could do is join his best friend. Eat and nod, the easy way to handle Hermione Granger.
A shiver ran down his spine as their lips met and Harry couldn't help but pull the other in even closer.
For a few seconds, Malfoy agreed with this, but that soon changed when he realized this wasn't Harry's fault. He couldn't have known. And he hadn't shown any negative reactions to the scene yet, so...
He greeted them with a smile, which they both returned, as he asked them about the food-related task. "Sure, that's no problem at all. We got that covered," the reply came with a grin and he felt relieved. What, had he expected the Hufflepuffs to let him down or something? Harry returned to the table and put it down on the parchment.
Although he had things to do, like making sure he got that assignment all finished up and continue the organisation of the party with the other students, he couldn't help but to wet his lips as he looked at the somewhat messy sheets. Did it have their scent? He didn't know why he felt like it was such a bad thing to crawl under the sheets, but after he kicked his shoes off he dared himself to wrap in the cozy blankets which definitely held both their scents. He breathed in and groaned as he realized what he was doing before he dropped his head to nestle in a comfortable position in the pillow. It wasn't as if he was tired, he just didn't want to be bothered by all his thoughts and feelings right now. He wanted to rest, to just lay cozy like this.
He'd always been somewhat of an attention seeker, which had to lead him to become an actual seeker. He didn't like sports. He'd never wanted to engage in such messy activities. However, as soon as his rival had entered, he'd felt a challenge. It had lured him in, and with some years of training, he'd actually gotten pretty good at it. This was why the idea of competing against Potter again was so exciting to him. It would spark things up, make things interesting again. He hated things being dull, there always had to be some sort of show going on in order for Malfoy to be happy.
Still trying to wake himself up to look at least a bit more respectable. But the bed was so warm and soft, and his head was still so fuzzy. He'd love to go straight back to sleep, but there was a confused Gryffindor trying to get his attention and he owed him some responses. Not that he had the answers to questions such as 'why did this happen?', but still. He had to explain himself somewhat before Potter got the wrong idea.
The reply was higher in pitch as usual, almost hoarse too, and Draco turned to find the other gulp down his water.
Maybe that was why he loved it so much: all the drama surrounding them made it interesting and intense.
He decided to shrug it off, pretend like he was really just trying to help the other. "And I'm saying this because I think it would help," he said.
Draco didn't even know how to respond to this. It surprised him and confused him, but most of all flattered him. No one besides his mother had ever called him precious. Never mind Potter, the boy who he was supposed to hate, and who was supposed to hate him too. There was only one thing he could think about now: Did this mean his suspicions were right? Did he actually like him?
"When two people get caught under a mistletoe, they have to kiss or their souls get sacrificed to the devil…" he mumbled, repeating the words he had a girl scream in delight years back. Clueless, he had believed that. Well, until Ron had enlightened him that it really wasn't like that. At Hogwarts another rule was at play though, when two people were caught underneath it, their impulse control would be stimulated or something. He wasn't really sure how it worked, but the thing was enchanted and would make the two kiss no matter what. Yeah, he definitely didn't want to be caught underneath these things again…
Malfoy simply looked back, unphased by her intense staring. "It's as he's just explained to you, we're not enemies anymore."
He looked to his side and noticed how the other nearly yawned. Suddenly he felt the urge to curl up and just cuddle. To get back to that warmth he'd felt before, the sudden lack of loneliness. He could just do it. No one was stopping him from just laying down and going for it. It would be weird, yes. Awkward, absolutely. But impossible, no. It was in his reach, but yet… It wasn't. Not really. He was able to do it, but shouldn't.
"You sure you're okay, not cold? We should get back inside for something hot to drink and skip talking to Ron for a bit too, I don't think we have time for that anyway, do we?" He was talking fast and letting his thoughts just run, worry laced in his voice.
A lot of alarm bells started ringing, deafening him as he carefully accepted the other's invitation. It didn't matter how awkward or unusual this was, because it felt warm and a lot better than just standing there while trying to make sense of things.
He just got worried when the other seemed distressed, it was an emotion he didn't even think twice about anymore.
"Very much," Draco grinned, already loving the idea of a challenge. It had been a while since he'd had a real challenge. A fun one, that was.
Was this hug lasting too long? Do you just loosely hang your arms around the person in situations like these or do you actually pull them in tight? Ron's mom gave him a lot of hugs in different kind of situations and so did Hermione, Ron at times as well, but for some reason, he felt like he still hadn't gotten the hang of it…
Draco knew who owned this owl. Its shiny, dark brown feathers were a Malfoy family trademark. The owl landed on his shoulder, after which Draco was able to take the letter. His suspicions had been right: the dark, pine green seal wore the Malfoy emblem. He carefully opened the letter and read through its content.
As they talked, Draco's mind started wandering off. He thought about what would happen if he and Harry kept being so friendly to each other. If it was even possible to continue like that. Their friends wouldn't like each other. Draco wouldn't be liked by Granger and Weasley, and Harry would be disliked by Draco's friends as well. Then there was the fact that everyone's hero was friends with the kid of a death eater. Surely that would cause some uproar.
"Uhm," he scratched his neck as his eyes failed to meet the blonde's grey ones that were fixed on him. "That is… complicated."
"Oh, uhm, actually…" He scratched his head awkwardly, looking to the side. Why did this fluster him so much? Because no one's ever said a thing like that.
Malfoy nodded. "Well, there are a few things that have to be done. Like, when are we going to hold it, how late, who'll bring the food, the music, and maybe we could bring some other entertainments. I've heard Hufflepuff has a band, maybe they're willing to perform?" Maybe he was making the party too much of a big deal, but that's why he was a Slytherin. Go big or go home.
"About Malfoy and I. It was sudden, I know, and I didn't want to hurt your feelings. But now the two of us have set our rivalry, if you could call it that, aside I just wanted you to accept him as well. Sorry if I rushed things or yelled. That was wrong."
He wanted to mock him, saying he looked a mess or something, just to get this awkward feeling off his chest, yet his breath rather got stuck in his throat.
Taken aback he stared at the other. He was somewhat confused. "Say what? That you're precious? As I said, it just slipped." Harry knew it was vague, yet he didn't really want to go on. It was not as if he could say he- "Just put down my feelings."
Draco was glad the subject had changed. "Probably something healthy that doesn't taste healthy," he guessed. "Why are you here anyway, just because of a cold?"
"Stop it, Ron," he growled. He knew what actions Malfoy had committed, there were some he had known about and some he had heard about at the trial. But he had never believed Malfoy, the boy who most times were only bark and no bite, would do any of that if he wasn't forced to. People had died because of him as well, didn't that make him unlikeable as well? He just didn't want to hear any of it anymore, it only brought back bad thoughts.
Harry stirred when the dreaded question left the guy's mouth. Ron and Hermione hadn't asked it yet, something he had been glad for. To think it would be Malfoy to ask him how he had made it to this point of self-neglect.
It didn't break. It didn't make a sound, but he wanted to be sure. He lifted his foot again and kicked as hard as he could. Nothing.
"Mal..." He hesitantly brought his hand up to wipe the warm tears that spilled out the other's eyes away. It pulled on his heartstrings to see the other like this and he sighed as he pulled the other back in. "You don't have to say anything, just let it out."
Of course, this question surprised Draco, but he was too calm to make a big deal out of it. It was actually an interesting question, no one really asked him this. Yes, it was a bit weird to ask in this situation, but honestly, he was too lazy to care.
This went on for a few minutes until the boy got stuck. Oh no. No, no, no. Not happening. He scratched the back of his head while taking a deep breath. Malfoy just explained this, didn't he? Oh man, maybe he shouldn't have questioned himself about their situation and just shut it all out to just focus on what the guy told him.
Harry didn't really appreciate the tone of how the blonde spoke to him, but he guessed it could be worse. It was quite weird how he had the blonde help him instead of Hermione, though. But, what freaked him out more was that he finally understood what this stuff was all about. Draco explained it in such a natural way that it just clicked. Oh gosh, why didn't he have a Hermione who could just repeat this the same way?
Maybe he had experience after all, maybe Draco was just the one lagging behind because he'd never dared to get this close to anyone.
It also made him feel hotter, probably a reaction that wouldn't have happened with his 'switch rooms' remark. Still, he couldn't care less right now. He was already holding the beautiful boy in his arms, his hands were playing with the soft mop of hair and he could feel the other nuzzle closer. It felt like he was floating with his head spinning around like this.
Suddenly, the idea of them becoming friends seemed very interesting to Draco. It would cause chaos. It would make things exciting. It felt so rebellious and daring. Something about it really intrigued Draco.
They walked on, Harry gulping and sucking in breaths. He felt just worse and worse with every step he took. He wasn't getting sick, was he? As they entered the library, the first thing he spotted in the dark spots was the familiar mop of blonde hair. 'Oh, that is just great…' Draco had found his book and was now walking to the administration desk to lend it, but noticed a very dizzy looking Potter walking in with his usual attachment. He wanted to comment on the boy's dazed look but didn't. First of all, because he simply couldn't bother at the moment, he didn't feel like conversing with anyone. Secondly, he felt like he didn't have the right to mock Potter's wellbeing. At least, not anymore. And thus he just kind of looked at him, wondering what he should do.
"Potter!" Someone screamed from a slight distance. Harry didn't turn, knowing who it was just by the underlying tone and he didn't plan on spending time with that person. "Ignorant twat," the voice continued to mutter, this time a lot closer to him than before.
"So, uhm, Harry listen. I was about to go to Hermione, so if you don't mind." Noticing the fidgety air around his friend he groaned, yet a playful smile appeared on his face. "Oh no, keep that for yourself. Go." Ron sputtered for a few seconds before he gave up and said his goodbyes - less enthusiastic to Malfoy as to Harry - before he left.
The room was just so peaceful and silent, it wasn't hard to lose himself while playing. It came like second nature to him, he didn't need to think about what to do. It was great to not think about anything for a little while.
When it came to Quidditch, he had been carefully watching the other Quidditch players, Malfoy especially when he entered as a fellow seeker. The sport had been new to him but reminded him somewhat of football. With a light stretch, he pulled himself up to sit back up on the bed to look at the other. "I did watch you, close enough if I say so. That's why I said it. Care to show I'm wrong then?"
"Yes, Hermione does," he hummed, "but it's not as easy to understand." He kept writing, not minding the silence that fell back. He would have been surprised by the guy asking about Hermione if he wasn't concentrating on his work.
The last few days he couldn't sleep all that well and he hadn't quite figured out yet why that was. Although the idea was nice enough, he was pretty sure Malfoy would be desperate to keep his reputation up and would start their usual routine back up tomorrow. With a sigh, he rubbed his eyes. He should head towards the Gryffindor dorm. He could use some more rest.
He was, however, very glad that the other had stayed. He would've gone mad if he was left alone right now. That would've left him with only his thoughts to accompany him, which, as he'd found out over the years, was terrible company.
"Granger, of course," Pansy explained, wearing a slightly agitated expression. She had never gotten along with Hermione Granger, just like Draco couldn't get along with Harry Potter. He continued to butter his bread, not looking up. "What's she done?"
But Malfoy was quite a clever person. It wasn't hard to put Potter's mood, behavior, and words together. He'd told him to maybe get a lover for distraction, but now he realized that love was the actual problem. Potter was crushing on someone. He instantly wondered who it could be, and to his surprise, felt a flush of jealousy wash over him. He quickly tucked that away though and focussed on the boy in front of him.
Draco spent the rest of his day sipping tea and reading a book. The common room wasn't busy, which allowed him to do it there, in one of the cozy chairs next to the fire. Many students thought the Slytherin common room was probably cold and nasty because it was located underneath the lake, but that wasn't the case at all. Slytherin was the home to a lot of rich and pureblood wizards, of course, the dorms should fit that status.
Against his will, he looked at the other, and when he did something inside him lit up. "Again, I'm sorry for interrupting. I'll uh, leave now I guess..." Surely, it was enough to intrude on the other, he couldn't, should not ever, ask if he was allowed to stay.
"Anyway… As soon as I've finished this year I'm leaving my parents. Maybe try to find a place for my own, you know. London seems nice…" He paused. He wanted to leave the Malfoy manor, start his own life and be independent. However, things seemed to be the other way around now. He wouldn't leave his parents, they had left him. It was a good thing he was so drowsy already, the thick layer of sleepiness hid his emotions fairly well. Before he could dwell on it any longer, he shifted the topic to the other.
He sat down on the edge of the lake and started to change into his skates. Pansy patiently waited for him, looking around if she saw any other friends. Draco was caught completely off guard when she started talking again, and immediately realized she'd chosen this moment to take her revenge for yesterday's argument. Very clever.
Silence fell between them as the students around them silently muttered to one another. Harry felt his anger fly out the window as if someone just used Expelliarmus on it. "I mean… He's very busy… Very important…" Draco added to his previous words.
He really hoped this would work. He wanted to do something for Potter, and he wanted it to go well. Malfoy was a well-known perfectionist, which was a burden but could also be good at times. Right now it could actually lead to good things, even though it made him act completely out of character.
After a while, Draco was done talking. He'd explained what needed to be explained, and it was Potter's job to write it down. He couldn't become too kind towards his rival now, right?
Malfoy was relieved to hear that Harry had already forgiven him for his actions. He couldn't fully believe it, but he knew it made sense. He was right, he wouldn't have defended Draco if he hadn't forgiven him yet. So it was logical, but to Draco, it didn't make sense. He shouldn't be forgiven that easily. It would probably take him ages to fully accept Potter's forgiveness.
"Speaking of the party, I came here to take a peek at the room. That was until I stumbled in here." How subtle.
While Harry knew you had to be patient when it came to crawling away from the fragile ice, he had been chanting for the other to just hurry up and get away from it, impatient as he was. A breath of relief had left him as the other finally had gotten away and was walking over, but that same breath had itched right back in his throat as the blonde's frame leaned against him. Harry heard him mumble something before burying his head even further in his robes and he felt nicely surprised. Malfoy must have been shaken by the thing as much as he was, but he hadn't actually expected this to happen.
Why did he have to mention that? A frustrated growl came from him and he pulled on his locks to frame his face. Some kind of 'if I can't see you, you can't see me' tactic of some sort. He had been acting weird around Malfoy, Malfoy had been weird as well. To think he believed things would be less infuriating as usual. What a joke.
"It's not funny, Harry," Ron whined, pulling away from the wall as his friends came walking outside the class a few minutes later. "I told you to eat more at breakfast," Hermione stated in return and Harry grinned. "Let's just head straight for lunch. We don't want you to miss out and get sent away again," he added.
It had taken Draco a while to get used to playing the instrument again, but after a little practice, he felt himself loosen up pretty quickly. Yes, he was very rusty, but still not bad. He just started playing a few songs he had played so often that they were permanently stuck in his head. He didn't need sheet music for that.
Harry felt himself drift off and let out a yawn, not bothering to reach the hand to his mouth but rather sneaked it under the blanket to reach around the pillow. This was quite the coziest he had ever felt in a bed, even if the pillow could have been softer…
Draco had never looked at the other in the way he was now, but now that he did, things started changing. In a way, he was proud to be the one hugging him. He nuzzled back against the other, smiling softly.
The last few days he couldn't sleep all that well and he hadn't quite figured out yet why that was. Although the idea was nice enough, he was pretty sure Malfoy would be desperate to keep his reputation up and would start their usual routine back up tomorrow. With a sigh, he rubbed his eyes. He should head towards the Gryffindor dorm. He could use some more rest.
Draco hesitated for a moment, but eventually spoke up. "I'll only tell you what you wish to know," he answered, his voice still appearing awful. As much as he just wanted to lose himself in the other, thrust his problems at him, and overwhelm him with himself, he had enough decency to not do so.
'Someone. If you hear this, please send help.' Harry wanted to slam his head against the table and-THUD. Oh no, he just couldn't control himself now, did he? He groaned, feeling his forehead tingle. That hurt. "I didn't mean it in such a way necessarily," he mumbled while rubbing his head. "Take a joke, Mal." He shifted in his seat and- oh shit... He did not.
Meanwhile, the Gryffindor's kisses had turned less fluttery and more sucky in a way Draco was sure would leave a few marks.
Draco slipped back into his usual cold posture and tidied his robes, which had been wrinkled due to his little dramatic display a few minutes ago. Maybe he shouldn't have done that after all. As he walked back towards the Slytherin dorms, it dawned on him that he'd spoken badly about his father. Not only that, but he'd also shown a very vulnerable side of himself. In front of Potter. Malfoy didn't agree with his father, but he did respect him. He was grateful for the protection he offered. Speaking ill about him in front of all those students…
Draco never reached the dorms. Instead, he went to the library. He told himself it was because of his Arithmancy homework, but even he knew better. He'd seen Potter walk off in that direction. It wasn't like he wanted to be around him, but he did want to make sure he would keep his mouth shut about what happened.
What he did care about were Potter's godly touches and the fact that their clothes were absolutely slipping out of place.
As soon as they reached the right place, Malfoy walked up to the painting and tickled the pear, which granted them access to the kitchens.
He sat up and tried to rub the sleep out of his face. Then he raked a hand through his hair to get it out of the way. Maybe he should just get ready to go to class, it was Monday after all.
Harry wanted to get this over with quickly and handed the papers over, luckily he had been as handy to bundle them together neatly. Professor Snape looked at him before he slowly raised his hand to grab it, yet as soon as his hand folded around the bundle he almost snapped it from the boy's hand.
"It's okay Mal. We all had problems going back here. I guess I can understand why you would go back to the old ways, but... You're not alone in this anymore."
"Mister Potter, are you alright? I thought I had allowed you to go a few days ago, even though you returned with a cold."
He sighed and rolled over, staring at the ceiling while rubbing a hand over his face. It was no use continuing like this, it didn't work.
Harry was taken aback. They had just come here, sat down and barely eaten anything. Where did they have to go anyway? Hermione sipped from her glass before she looked straight at the other girl. "You mean to the lake? I suppose it's quite crowded there already."
Malfoy nodded. "You should talk with the Slytherins about the decorations, trust me they'll know what to do. Team them up with Ravenclaws and you've got quite a powerful combo. As for the food, can't we take another trip to the kitchens and see what they can do? Or maybe send some Hufflepuffs, their common room is right next to it so I'd suppose they have some connections…"
It took somewhat longer as he had expected, yet he couldn't complain. As soon as they were done, he'd wanted to leave, yet the other halted him by calling out his name.
Eventually, the elf came back in quite the excited manner with a glass of hot water and a few bags, clearly not sure if the blonde would be satisfied with just the usual flavored tea. Draco smiled and took the cup that was handed to him, together with one of the bags of tea.
Still conscious, he hummed at the presence of the other, trying to resist curling up against the heat. His eyes refused to open so he didn't fight against it anymore. The blankets were still draped half over him even though he had almost fallen over. "Just tired," he breathed. That was quite obvious, but he just felt like mentioning that.
"You're the most comforting thing I've encountered in a very long time. The first time we hugged, I instantly realized that I needed more of that warmth. I'm just too much of a prat to admit such things. Too much of a coward to admit that I love being near you, not only just for the comfort."
He melted instantly. The boy had been driving him nuts for the last few days. Constantly on his mind and being all damn handsome.
No one would expect such a room to be a part of the Malfoy Manor, which was dark, mostly wooden and decorated with silver and green tones. It was a practically forgotten room, which resided right next to the gardens.
His mouth felt dry and his voice was hoarse, did he snore? Hmm, he never knew he did or heard Ron complain about it.
It wasn't hard to notice, really. "Stuck already?" He asked, keeping back a sigh. Ah, he was obvious as hell it seemed. He slowly turned, biting on his lip and raising an eyebrow. "Maaaybe?" Malfoy instantly decided Potter wasn't allowed to make that kind of face again. "Right. Where?"
The few students that were present around the table seemed surprised at first as he came up to them but soon enough joined him to discuss some things. Just to stretch time, he took out some parchment to make them draw some examples. He was going to be sorry for this behavior at the end of this day, he noted as he felt his mind grow heavy already with all the thoughts piling up one another.
After a while, Draco was done talking. He'd explained what needed to be explained, and it was Potter's job to write it down. He couldn't become too kind towards his rival now, right?
Green eyes widened as he saw the other shake and kicked the blankets away, regretting it as he noticed how warm the blankets had kept him. He grabbed them back as he stood up to wrap around him as he made his way towards the other. What was he actually planning to do? He only realized he was eye to eye when he stood there, staring at the other. Well, that was going to be awkward if he doesn't say anything.
There were clear signs that it was getting quite hot and he couldn't help but to feel slightly nervous.
Writing along the boy with his messy hair took a long sip from the glass in front of him. Was there anything he missed? Harry was about to ask when he noticed Parkinson and Malfoy talking with each other, amusement still written on the girl's face. A frown edged on his face as he turned back to the list. Honestly, what was up with the girl?
Maybe he could. Maybe the room would keep it safe for him, and return it when he reopened this specific room.
He wondered what Ron and Hermione would say if they had seen him with Malfoy like this. Surely, they wouldn't believe him anymore about the guy and him 'just lately having become friends' anymore. Harry was quite sure Ron would point that out as well, whether with Malfoy around or one-on-one. And he had to be honest that there was nothing he could do to stop it. He longed for the other's touch. Maybe he should have buried this crush before it could grow. But for now, he was quite content the way they were.
There was one that immediately turned to get some hot water and glass while Harry simply took it all in. It had been a while since he had seen so many house-elves, after Dobby's death he had it quite difficult with progressing it, especially when he saw another house elf. Dobby had been one of his friends, another person that died for him. That thought made him feel grim and his smile vanished. Maybe he shouldn't have brought those memories back, huh.
The mention to 'Gryffindors' reminded Harry of Ron and he almost choked on the piece of bread he at been chewing on. That's right, he hadn't spoken with the other in quite a while. Munching on another piece of bread he watched a duo walk through a door only to have another jump in their way in order to make them stay under the mistletoe hanging there. He snorted as he watched the two students get all flustered after a chaste kiss.
Allowing himself to melt at Malfoy gazing at him, the corners of his mouth couldn't get out of their risen state.
He didn't feel like discussing it any further. Even though Harry didn't wish to come eye to eye with his friends, Ron especially as he knew Hermione would be less of the hothead from the two. He pushed his feelings aside and entered the great hall. Maybe he should just grab some food and leave…
It was a marvelous location, he was sure they wouldn't be interrupted anytime soon. They could stay there for ages.
At the end of class, Draco was left with quite a pile of homework, which was also occupying his mind when he walked into the great hall, towards the Slytherin table. He sat down and gathered some food while waiting for some other friends to arrive. Pansy was the first to arrive, holding some rune books. As interesting as runes were, Draco was very glad he hadn't chosen that class. Pansy often complained about how difficult it was. She sat down opposite him and put her books aside.
Not sure what had gotten into him, he already started to list down things in his head. A bag of candy? Nah, Draco didn't seem like the guy to accept work for sweets. Maybe a muggle pen? It lasted longer than the ink of their feathers. But then again, he knew about the 'that is what she said' thing… There was no harm in trying though. He searched through his stuff in hope of finding one, looking almost victorious when he found one "What about this?"
Harry's eyes lingered on Malfoy's face, taking his expression in. Most things had gone back to the past as soon as the war was over. Slytherin and Gryffindor clashing and all… Surely, things were a little bit more hectic the first months as the new first-years had driven him nuts. They had no idea what the students of the years above them had gone through. Harry had noticed how some had not come back. Beside the students that had passed away, others simply didn't want to continue the course after all that happened. Though surely there were students that were kept at home by their parents after the past events.
Neville jumped in to add it was a good idea, and yes it might be crowded, but they should go now before it was way too busy. It took some time before they all stood up to head out. It turned out in none of them having brought skates and only sliding on the ice, sometimes slipping and falling on their butts. Soon enough someone had thrown a snowball at Ron, Harry honestly had no idea if it came from one of them or had been a lost cause in other people's snowball fight, yet it caused one between them. Obviously, Ron and Hermione had teamed up with him, while Neville and Luna had dragged Seamus in the fight.
The fingers that caressed Malfoy's sides seemed to burn, not much different from the rest of his body.
Potter had said it was fine, but it wasn't and they both knew it. This was why he always took his time to think. This was why he was never impulsive, and always very composed. "I'm serious," he said just before they entered the great hall. "I say stupid things when I'm tired and grumpy and when I'm confused."
Draco let his eyes scan the crowd and soon found a few familiar faces. Pansy, Blaise, and a few others were occupying the cozy green armchairs in their usual corner of the room. They had probably attempted to study but were busy talking when Draco walked up to them.
He hummed as he took the ends of the blanket to wrap it tighter around his frame, feeling quite cozy in it before he looked up to answer. A surge of energy shot through him as their eyes met and his breath was stuck in his throat for a moment before the need of breathing made him let it out in a shaky breath. What was that just now? His eyes fell back on the blanket. "Yeah, people did. Snape as he gave me that stupid assignment and, like I said, Voldemort in my nightmares to state some examples."
Flushing as all the attention was drawn to them at once, Harry picked the other from the ground. Well, he tried - keyword 'tried'. "Stop it. You're embarrassing," he hissed. "Fuck if I care, unlike you I know how to talk myself out of stuff. So, I guess you're the only one being affected by this," he smirked.
"You're crushing?" He blurted out, instantly regretting it. He was acting like Potter now, impulsive and without thought. Well this time, rather because of a thought. He never acted like this, was Potter's behavior contagious? Again, he wondered why he became so uncontrolled in front of this guy. Maybe it was because he'd always been a bit of an uncontrolled prat in front of him, it could just be a habit. Maybe he was so not used to being nice to him, that he didn't know what to do. And Merlin, did it scare him. He tried several times to collect himself, to fall back into a decent posture, but got more and more furious the more he failed. Why in the world wasn't this working, it had to work, he couldn't stand this. After a while of struggling, he finally managed to get at least a bit of himself together. He didn't complain, at least it was something. He cleared his throat and cleared his face of any emotion that had been displayed on it.
Groaning, Harry squeezed his eyes shut tightly. He didn't want to wake up, it felt nice to have a pillow radiating heat on him. His mind stopped him right there. A pillow couldn't generate heat, now could it? With a huff Harry managed to lift himself up to look at what he had been leaning on, only to find Malfoy sleeping.
Draco's eyes widened as he made a very offending noise. "You… How dense… That's not how it is at all." For Merlin's sake, where were the words when you needed them? "You think spending time with me will be fun? You're forgetting that any time we spend together is filled with arguments and curse words, I don't see that changing anytime soon, not even for an essay."
He stopped. Maybe he shouldn't have said that. Maybe it had sounded way too heavy and dramatic. Maybe he was too obsessed with trying to apologize and maybe he should leave the war for what it was. It was all he could ever talk about lately and that had probably gotten annoying by now.
"Other as that I have problems sleeping," Harry mumbled. "I don't see why my lack of sleep or that I drink less would cause any of this. Or someone has to have poisoned my food or anything…" Malfoy let out a deep sigh. "A lack of sleep and dehydration can absolutely lead up to a thing like this, has no one ever told you that?" He had experience with this sort of thing, as he also tended to forget to sleep or eat during long study sessions. But at least he knew it was bad, Potter didn't seem to notice how severe it could get.
Draco sniffed, not entirely uninterested. "I've seen some Ravenclaws carry those around… An enhanced quill, right?" "It actually is-nevermind. An enhanced quill alright. It takes quite some while to run out of ink. Very useful if I say so." He moved it somewhat closer to the blonde in hope of sealing the deal. He didn't really know what else to offer him.
Astrology was a very mixed class. Most classes were held with just two houses, but somehow this one included all of them. It was probably due to the lack of students wanting to take this class, which meant there was often a max of 15 to 20 students attending. Draco didn't really know why. Though the lowered number of students following the course this year had dropped as well due to various reasons...
After a while, Draco realized he'd been spouting ideas and words at the others. Maybe he should contain himself a bit before he started to order people around. He was just so used to planning things out, telling others what to do, and coming with ideas, that planning a party like this came naturally to him. He knew what to do if he wanted something and this was no exception.
Harry stirred to a halt, eyes still on the bed. Slowly he raised his head to meet the other's eyes. Why did Malfoy not push him away? Or tell him that was just weird or stupid. It was confusing how the other had reacted and it made Harry only more unsure of himself. A soft groan left him as his consciousness registered the cold breeze on his skin before he allowed himself to softly fall back in the blond boy's embrace. "You're so confusing and infuriating."
Harry looked up for a second before looking down on his notes again. "I would say 'be as kind as to help me then' but then again, you're a Malfoy. Slytherin to top." He was silent for a while as it dawned on him that he had actually written quite some nonsense on his paper and tried to ignore the heat that sprawled to his cheeks. "Don't you have anything better to do, anyway?"
His throat was dry since he still had nothing to drink since the glass of water from last night, and his mind was a mess because of the thoughts that were clashing with one another. "I just don't understand… Why do I have to feel this way?" He let his head fall on his legs after he pulled them up towards his body.
It was however very nice to hear him say it. It lightened the Slytherin's mood a bit to know that Potter didn't loathe him for his actions. He looked at the other, suddenly feeling exhausted. That was probably due to the emotions he'd just experienced. "I guess so," he replied, referring to Harry's earlier words. What should they do now? The hug hung between them like a thick cloud, probably making them both slightly uncomfortable.
Hermione entered the common room just as the two let go of one another and they made their way outside where the two of them left Harry with wishes for the holidays and two tight hugs, which he gladly returned. Only when his friends were too far away to spot, he turned back to head inside. He should probably get back to the hospital wing first to get his stuff, but he felt like changing clothes first. He had slept in the clothes from the day before and he didn't like the feeling of it, though the smell Malfoy had left on them was rather comforting.
"I have a feeling you're not gonna leave in a while," Harry laughed. He and potions, not taking long? Malfoy had to be kidding, right?
Draco couldn't do much about Voldemort haunting his dreams, that was out of his reach. He could, however, do something about the homework. He felt terrible as he thought of how pleased he'd been after hearing Snape giving Potter the extra work. Maybe he could make that right just a little bit.
It alarmed him. This had been Malfoy's idea, he felt like it wouldn't be right if he took his distance from the planning. But he couldn't speak up for him, the other students had to decide for themselves whether they were still willing to help, to come to the party, or were fueled with too much of resentment towards the other to even accept him helping out, to accept his apology.
Eventually, the nurse left and returned with some water and a potion. She put them on the little table next to the bed and asked Harry to drink them. After that, she left, muttering something about students not taking good care of themselves. This left the two students in a slightly awkward silence. Draco wasn't sure what to say or do, he had no experience with this sort of thing. He was useless when it came to healthcare or comforting someone. "I suppose I could try to fetch your… friends," he spoke eventually, looking everywhere but at the pale looking boy.
For a moment he had wondered if he should just join the other, but that only brought questions to his head so he decided against it. He didn't need to have the fear of ice breaking added up in that messy head of his. Just watching the other would do.
"It's no problem," he mentioned faintly, still busy with his thoughts. Potter's crushing on someone, Potter's crushing, who is it, how did I not notice before… Draco really had a hard time pushing these thoughts away but didn't manage to suppress his curiosity.
Harry hummed at the blonde's reply, deep in thought. Pansy Parkinson, that was the girl Hermione spoke about from time to time. Hermione disliked the girl for some reason, though he had never listened all that much to her rants to know why exactly. Maybe she was sassy or acting mean. Still curious as he had only just thought about the guy's parents he voiced his next train of thoughts. "I would have thought your parents had set up an arranged thing, as you were so keen on pure-blood statuses and all."
Malfoy felt heat rise to his cheeks, unwanted that was. "It was a moment of weakness Potter," he hissed, not meaning to sound angry, but maybe doing so anyway. He'd told him he didn't care, and at the moment that had been true, but right now…
When the other finished talking, he simply smiled and told the other he was leaving. It was useless to stay if he couldn't keep his mind in check. He let out a deep breath and walked through the halls, not sure where to go to. Like this, he wandered around until he found himself back at the hospital wing. Harry let out a breathy laugh and shook his head while he made his way inside without questions and sat back on the bed he had left that morning. His stuff was still there and Pomfrey had filled his glass and left a note with it, stating he should drink it if he were to see it.
He continued talking. "But of course, those plans are off the table now. We haven't got the luxury to think about things like that. And besides, who would marry a Malfoy in this day and age? We're scum now."
Harry had shaken his head with a small smile before he returned his gaze at the other, who just turned out to look at him as well. Malfoy's gaze lay heavily on him, it made him feel weird to be watched like this, although it wasn't really a bad thing. When the other looked away Harry blinked.
Had his actions affected the other that much? Oh, this was a thing to mess with, there was no avoiding it now.
Heading back to the hall, there were only a few people left. Harry quickly made his way over to the ones he had actually ever spoken to, though he shortly wondered if it was weird to suddenly ask for help like this.
Harry allowed the other to come closer as he simply pointed at it. "Uhm, like right here. After the part on how not to use Fairy Wing in it."
The Slytherin sprawled himself out over the couch, as he usually did when it came to furniture like this because, yes, he liked to take up as much space as possible. Potter still seemed a bit tense.
He could feel the blood drain from his face, as he realized how impossible it was to get away from there. Maybe if he just continued walking carefully…
Draco hadn't expected the other to know any pieces anyway, but asking didn't hurt. He looked through the music sheets that were still laying on the coffee table and smiled as he recognized the pieces he loved.
It was weird to walk towards the Potions classroom when there were no classes. Halting in front of the door he tried not to groan, just knocking on the door as it almost immediately swung open. Snape was in the front of the room and he slowly rose his eyebrow as he saw him, though the man should have expected him by now. "I see you have finally decided to come by, Potter."
As soon as he'd started talking, he couldn't stop. It spilled out of him like a long-kept secret. He noticed how his hands started to shake slightly, but couldn't control it.
A glassy stare had fallen over his face, making him look even more dysfunctional. He just didn't know how to react to this and was still trying to manage his thoughts. Meanwhile, Potter was distancing himself from him and Draco silently cursed himself for not being able to do anything. He didn't want the other to leave, he'd enjoyed being so close, he hadn't scared him, right?
He should have expected his friend to ask that, considering he had joined them on many occasions through the years. But this time he just didn't feel like he should interrupt. Yes, he desperately wanted to spend this Christmas with others, he needed the company, but he just couldn't allow himself to join the Weasley family.
He glanced back at the lake once more, still regretting his actions. "I do think I'll try to skate on it, if it keeps freezing. Would love to do that.."
I'm not J.K Rowling nor is my collaboration partner and thus we don't own Harry Potter nor do we get paid for any of this.
Harry bet that if this continued, his sweater wouldn't be looking the same as before, not with the way these hands grabbed on him.
He didn't speak, not yet, he wasn't sure if his voice would betray him or not. Regaining a slow steady breathe he tried to calm himself down, or his heart rate at least. This was fucked up, why did his body react like that? Ron and Hermione had offered him their help and support throughout the year as well. Why did he only feel like this now when Malfoy said it? Something in the far back of his mind tried to speak up, yet he pressed it back to where it came from. Not now.
Returning the smile, he shifted in the chair. "̈That was no problem, really. You play beautifully, I should have to thank you."
It took him a few seconds to realize that this wasn't the Malfoy Manor, and house-elves weren't supposed to be seen as 'slaves' anymore.
"I understand," he said. "I will try to talk to him. You shouldn't be fighting with your friends just because… " he hesitated for a moment. "Well, just because we're not enemies anymore."
Pressing his hands, that were cold for some apparent reason, against his cheeks he hoped it would help him think of something, and as soon as he caught sight of the Hufflepuffs Malfoy's words replayed in his mind. In that instant, he stood up, told Malfoy to keep an eye on the list, and made his way towards the students he had spotted.
He started to whistle as he came to the end of his essay. It had been quite nice to actually sit back and not yell at one another. They should do this-ohhhhh no. NO. Stop. Right. There. Harry, keep your head cool. After this, they would just split up again and that was it… He guessed…
Harry couldn't help but laugh. "Where...-where did that come from?" Seeing the previous question, he would have thought the other wondered why he wasn't staying over at the Weasley's household if Christmas were to be like that. It nestled in him, digging for the emotions he had shielded away for a bit.
There was obviously more to it, but Potter probably had his reasons for not telling Malfoy. He didn't press it and merely nodded back. He himself had had trouble functioning normally again too, the first few months after the war. Even now the things he'd done haunted him whenever his mind started to wander off.
"Right, yes, a cold, because a bloody scarf is too much to ask before you go outside?" He snapped. There it was again, that lack of self-control whenever he was near Potter. He started pacing around, trying to hide his annoyance at least a bit by not looking at the other.
"I'm not mature enough? And you are then?" Blaise scowled. "We have endured your complaints about Potter for eight years now, you've been the most childish of us all, and now suddenly we're the immature ones?" His voice was filled with rage that had probably been bottled up for quite a while. It surprised Malfoy, but not enough for him to show it.
Still feeling the other's lips on his even though they were apart, causing him to trace his lips with his tongue as to capture it.
"Neville. I was about to finish this and search for you." The boy frowned at his empty spaces on the paper, yet decided not to ask for it as Harry continued to ask about his book, which he found to be rather more interesting as the homework.
"I told you to wear a scarf, Harry," Neville said while handing him a tissue. They had been totally into their snowball fight and his clothes had been drenched due to the wetness. Luna had stayed to slide on the ice and Ron and Hermione had gone off together while Neville had gone to fetch some blankets and hot chocolate for the black-haired guy after setting him off at the hospital wing - Pomfrey wasn't amused by his appearance.
"I," he started, "I… After the war, I didn't know how to act in front of you. I still don't. I just didn't know what to do with myself, so I put up something temporary to at least not look confused in front of others. That's why I fell back into old habits. And I eventually just went with that, because others seemed to accept it. Just like me, everyone fell back into old habits. As if nothing had ever changed. I thought it was the best for everyone, but right now I see that it was foolish of me to put up such a show."
His grip tightened, his nails digging themselves into the other's back. He was being pathetic. He was ruining Potter's nice cuddles. He was spoiling everything, and thus undeserving of the other's sympathy and care.
"You must be very dense then," he sneered back. Malfoy had been pestering Potter since year one because of one simple reason: he was incredibly easy to anger. Draco always got the reaction he wanted, it was honestly the most entertaining thing.
With a nod from him the two left, reassured he was fine. Harry let his head rest back to look at the ceiling.
It hadn't just been a notice about the Christmas holidays, it had been a subtle farewell. Draco had been foolish to try to cover it up with pretty lies. This was his parents, or maybe just his father's way of telling him he wouldn't be seeing them for quite a while. Possibly for a very long time. They had cut themselves out of his life.
As the blonde remarked about him looking like an actual lion though, his mind was a blank slate. Confused, Harry stared at the other until his hand found his locks and it clicked. His hair was a mess in the morning, he knew cause he was the person to deal with it every other single day. Well, he just brushed it out that is...
"I see you found Loony," one of them said as they came to a group of four. Harry nodded and decided to immediately mention the party, which he got surprised reactions too. He noticed that a duo from Hufflepuff were listening to their conversation as well.
Beating around the bush had done so much good now, had it? Harry didn't like to be confronted with his feelings. With a huff, he let go of the other, as far as he could even get his other arm to wiggle away.
Why was he so furious? Why was he actually acting it out, and letting it show so clearly? This was getting ridiculous.
"I'm not going to deny what happened during the war. A lot of Slytherins have acted terrible, including me, which is why you're right to feel resentment towards me or my house. I'm aware that a party won't heal all of your wounds, some are too deep to ever fully heal, but I hope this party could provide the people who've done wrong to apologize and the people who've been hurt to forgive."
Harry realized Malfoy was probably confused by his words, yet he was not planning on making it known that he may or may not be crushing on the Slytherin. Not that he was though.
They have given me permission to post this, yet didn't wish to be mentioned as re-reading the contents had made them cringe and they rather not attach their name to this fanfic lol
"Good morning," he greeted them, making room for them at the table. Ron patted his back while Hermione greeted him back with a smile.
Pansy's playful expression turned a bit grimmer, and Draco instantly regretted being so harsh about it. "Look," he said, "No one here even knows I own a violin, it's kind of a personal thing. The fact that you even know I play is because you caught me doing it once. I've never shown it to anyone, ever."
"Don't worry, I can be a very good cuddle-buddy," he grinned. From the inside, he was about to scream, yet he managed to keep himself together quite well. He didn't show, now did he? He shrugged it off, as he didn't want to linger on these feelings. He should be content with the other like this.
"Anyway," he resumed, "should we get it over with right now or can't you bear any more of me at the moment?" Still rubbing the sore spot on his head Harry huffed and turned to the other, unable to stop a small smile to form on his lips. "Oh yeah, duh. I always bang my head on tables in hopes to become friends." Once again he shifted in his seat, this time to open his books.
When setting foot back in the hall it felt as if they were returning to the world where time returned to tick forward from a secluded place where it had been put to a stop.
Hermione internally groaned. He had a point, but it was just so weird for Harry to refer to this guy as Mal, let stand let him , she had to say Harry didn't really seem on his best behavior today. He looked way too pale and tired and didn't want anything to eat or drink this morning. With a huff, she looked at Ron. "As weird as this might sound, I think we have to believe his word." Ron gasped and wanted to reply, bring her back to her senses. "Ron. You saw how Harry was acting this morning. And I bet his nightmares haven't just disappeared, which will do no better. We should at least take a look." Ron grumbled at that, knowing he couldn't deny that. He took another look at the paper before he followed Hermione, who gave nothing but a curt nod to the Slytherin. He trusted the paper in the blonde's hands. "You better seem as friendly as this letter and your story make you seem to be," he barked, leaving the library as well.
"Unfortunately for you, I do know how to take care of myself though. I mean have you ever seen me in this room because I was the one who was hurt? And don't start talking about that bloody hippogriff, I'm talking about the current time."
The Slytherin suddenly felt a bit more awake than he had done before Potter had spoken. He had just called him precious. He actually had.
They chatted for a bit in silence as both of them gave in to their faults and after some minutes they broke out in smiles before embracing each other. Harry was glad to know it was okay between them again and that Ron was willing to give Malfoy a chance.
"Right…" Draco mumbled, letting the tips of his fingers rest on the spot between his eyebrows and the upper part of his nose. He closed his eyes for a brief moment and took a deep breath. He had completely exposed himself in front of not only Potter but Weasley too. He had sunken to his lowest standards without a single hesitation, and he saw no way to climb back up again. But it had been a good thing to do, even though it hurt his pride.
"No, no, wait." He reached for the other and kissed him, just a peck lasting only for a few seconds.
Harry let his hand slip out of the other's hair to cup the Slytherin's face, thumb caressing the soft cheek as he couldn't help but smile against the other's lips, his tongue soon enough darting out again. Time seemed quite irrelevant, but Draco still faintly wondered how much of it had passed by now.
Though he wasn't sure if this was forced on him or that he had picked it up himself considering the boy had looked content and somewhere else with his thoughts as he had played just now.
Well, Draco couldn't agree to those words more. "Why in the world is it so difficult..." He mumbled against the other's chest. "Why are we making this so difficult?" He looked up, finding himself closer to the other than he'd anticipated. Merlin, why was that boy so dreamy...
His body felt incredibly hot, but as soon as the other's hand had found his skin, he felt shivers run up and down his back.
They turned around to get back to where he had left Malfoy behind, intentions set on having a little chat with the blond. As the two friends talked, Malfoy got up to look at least a bit more respectable. He patiently waited for them to finish while thinking of what he could say to convince the redhead that he wasn't some kind of demon. When they approached him he tried to look calm and approachable, making sure Weasley could see he didn't have any bad intentions. He kept this posture as he started talking.
On his way back Harry noticed the two Slytherins being even cozier and he then and there decided he was just going to leave right this moment. He went over to Luna, opposite of the table where the blonde was talking with his Slytherin ex-girlfriend. "Luna, you know where Neville is hanging out?"
Shit, that had sounded a lot meaner than he'd intended it to sound. But Potter knew he was just mocking him, right?
"I want you to forget about it. The whole conversation." He deliberately didn't answer Harry's question, because he couldn't. Just a moment he'd probably regret for the rest of his life. However, instead of being ashamed of it, it made him bitter. Angry, almost.
It was honestly a ridiculous situation. Draco Malfoy, offering that damn golden child help with his homework in exchange for a quill. What would his parents say if they knew? What would his friends think? What would his past self think? Certainly not what happened next. Draco nodded and took the pen, examining it for a bit, before nodding. "That'll do then."
Draco allowed himself to smile faintly at this. He would've been devastated if the party were to be canceled just because of him. He didn't want that for Potter, nor for the other people that were already so excited about it.
Malfoy scoffed softly. He'd actually really worried the guy, to the point where it got pretty serious. That kind of intrigued him, Potter, caring about him.
In the middle of their kissing Harry bit softly on Malfoy's bottom lip, pulling it lightly before he let go and continued their previous kiss, free hand searching for skin underneath the other's shirt. All of this made the Slytherin feel quite dizzy. His brain simply didn't function anymore, it only consisted of short thoughts, impulsive ideas that were acted out immediately. Things like moving his hands, sometimes snatching a bit of air between the kisses, and other little movements that he couldn't control.
After seeing the quick smile, Draco turned away again. That hadn't looked like staring, right? They had had fights across the hall all the time, this was nothing special.
Harry thought about that for a moment. It seemed cold outside, but he bet that if Hermione really wanted to go outside to have some time with Ron that the two could be there. The red-haired boy was quite easy to be influenced by his girlfriend.
Holding the other in his arms was great, yet kissing the other and playing with his hair was even better.
The girl frowned as if she noticed his behavior. "Well, I would suggest the library possibly to research some plants?"
Taking a deep breath he slowly nodded. "I'm not sure if I'm entirely convinced yet, though I do believe you have spoken genuinely. I… No, both Hermione and I, will give you a chance. But, if you do anything to prove me wrong or hurt Harry, I will make sure you'll regret it."
Harry couldn't help but snort. Yes, he was well aware the Slytherin house wasn't going to evacuate the school to return home. Some didn't want to return home, because they knew someone would be missing at the dinner table, and others knew they wouldn't want to come back if they finally came home. The war left a mental scar on a lot of students, which Hogwarts only made burn.
That turned around quite quickly. But did he want the other to do his homework for him? Surely, Snape would put him in detention or give him a load of extra work to do if he messed this assignment up. Yet, what could he even offer the Slytherin? He would have to do it on his own. Or, well…
"Hmm, you might be right. How could I even think about that? I mean, that your dad doesn't write back didn't even bother you the slightest bit. How could I even think you had something even close to likable in you. Thanks for confirming things," he countered.
Draco nodded with a scoffing laugh. "For your information, you've called me a christmas miracle. I think that pretty much explains how far off you were."
He had never really had the chance to think about it all that much with some evil dude on his heels. Yet he thought he would like to be an Auror. With a hum, he continued. "I know that's gonna make me have to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth… perseverance and dedication." Now he thought about that, he suddenly started to wonder if he was fit for that kind of job. Yes, he wanted to do this. But he honestly to Merlin had no idea if he was gonna make it. He started to doubt himself at times like this, at night. Maybe he shouldn't think of that right now.
The Slytherin knew his eyes had started to water, since his vision was getting slightly blurry, but hoped that the other's sweater would hide his emotions once again. Potter didn't need to know about his problems, he just needed to provide comfort. Right now, he was doing this just fine.
Harry realizes some stuff, the Slytherin and Gryffindor have a snow fight, and they talk about the war
He tried to collect himself, make himself continue talking so that he couldn't back away once again.
He turned his eyes away to stare in the distance. After the war things changed drastically, but for people to think they couldn't afford to love someone, nor to be loved by someone else. That was quite sad. Though he wasn't one to speak of that. Before Hogwarts, love was a concept he hadn't really known. It had been a luxury for him as well if he were to say so himself. He could understand where Malfoy was coming from, yet he still thought it was quite sad that a person had to have such thoughts. To think of themselves as scum.
He was so tired. He hadn't slept that well last night and Draco being this pompous jerk really didn't help him out. With one heavy sigh, he tried to get rid of all the negativity in him. "You know what, fine. I'll act as if you're not some kind of drama queen. Now, if you would please let me work."
"Hey guys," he said somewhat more hoarse as he wanted. Ron greeting him with his mouth stuffed while Hermione frowned.
"Well, you see," he stated, "I don't think it's wise to just drink potions for days." Was he going to tell the other that he thought it also had to do with the fact that they'd slept together that night? Would that be okay? He started playing with the rim of his shirt, hesitating about what he should say.
He suddenly wondered what Malfoy's parents would think if they were to find out what their son was doing with him. Though he didn't really know how to label them. While he mentioned to the both of them being friends, he knew that this was not a thing he would do with Ron - and he had been friends for a long time with that guy. Harry decided to leave that topic for now as the other boy shifted once again.
Pansy grinned sweetly at him. That couldn't be good. "Because you're finally excited about something again. I like it when you get all bossy and determined, that means you're happy." She lowered her voice a bit. "You've been all depressed lately, grumpy and agitated. This is the first time this year you're actually excited about something. Let me have my proud friend moment, would you?"
That should do. He managed to fold the paper up before handing it to the blonde. Unfortunately, it rather flew out of his hands in the air. So much for motor coordination. Luckily the Slytherin had quick reflexes. He caught the paper before it hit the ground and pocketed it. Then he put his book and the quill back. He wondered if he could actually call that thing a quill though, it didn't remotely look like a feather.
He made his way to a seat next to some Slytherins he knew and started a conversation. None of his close friends were present, but he actually didn't mind that at all. He always felt a bit more relaxed when they weren't around. When no one would notice if he let his guard down for a bit.
Yet right now, this was their own secluded place where they didn't have to worry about any obligations or other people.
"Mal!" He called out to the other. "Try to carefully lay down on the ice, either move forward on your stomach like that or roll - I'm not kidding. You hear me?" While he was worried about the other, he checked his own footing and decided to move back a little bit himself. It wouldn't help either of them as one or both of them would fall in the lake.
Trying not to disturb the other, he had silently closed it and almost tiptoed to a corner to view this rare scene unfolding in front of him.
To hear him say that surprised him, yet he felt quite grateful for that. With a huff, he flashed the other a little smile. "Thanks, Mal."
He didn't care if it looked like he was staring, maybe he should just admit already that Potter was on his mind a lot. It would certainly make things easier, but also more complicated at the same time.
"And I suppose everyone can inform each other?" Draco looked around the group of students surrounding them. "If a Hufflepuff would be so kind to inform their house, and if a Ravenclaw would do the same, we could just make a list of who's willing to do what. Then all we need is a date and time." He wanted this settled now, not later. Otherwise, they would keep running around in circles and getting nowhere.
He'd lifted a weight from his shoulders that had been pressing down on him for quite a while and felt a lot less tense now.
Maybe if Hermione explained it to Ron and Ron to him, both he and Ron would understand it, yet Snape wouldn't think of Hermione having had any influence on the project. Though he doubted the two would be in the common room after their last talk. They seemed to have a planned meeting and well, let's just say he had never thought about the room of Requirement of a dark place in that sense.
Malfoy nodded while rubbing his eyes. "That's great, really great," he murmured, suppressing a yawn. So it had at least been good for something. That was a good thing. He himself couldn't complain either, he'd slept well too. Eventually, he just couldn't bear his drowsiness anymore.
Draco sighed. If that stubborn bastard wasn't going to the hospital wing himself, he'd have to drag him over there. He got a hold of the Gryffindor's arm, made sure he could lean on him and started walking out of the library and towards the hospital wing. He didn't care what Potter's friends would think, or what anyone else would think for that matter. He'd made his decision. He and the Gryffindor weren't arch-enemies anymore.
He decided to not think into it too much, and move onto the next thing the other had said. He'd complimented him, not mocked him. And somehow, this made Draco flush a light shade of red. Being complimented on something so personal was a big deal to him, it seemed. Through all of this, he did, however, notice the Gryffindor's uncomfortable posture. He probably knew he'd intruded and was feeling bad for it now.
It was harsh to talk about his family like this, and he couldn't deny there had never been any form of love between him and his parents, but then why had they left without him? Why had his father always been so cold towards him? Why had they shown so little care over the years?
It seemed like Potter knew how to deal with things like this. Malfoy didn't exactly dislike the comfort he provided by telling him everything was okay, but would rather have never shown him his tears at all. In any case, he was a very silent crier. A result of his upbringing, he supposed.
He shifted his gaze away from the window and leaned his head back against his chair, staring up at the ceiling. He was so used to living in great wealth, that he wasn't sure how to act without it. He was used to the finest clothes, expensive stuff, servants and big manors. Would he be able to turn his back to all of those things, if that was what it took to be self-dependent? He really liked the idea of finding himself a nice job and staying in London, but would he manage to do that?
"Hmm, well you do have a nice smile," Harry mumbled. When he realized he had actually said that out loud he cleared his throat, sinking his nails in the palm of his hands in hope the heat would not rise to his cheeks. He should not have said that out loud.
"Let's enjoy ourselves for a bit then." She took a few careful steps. "Oh, and if I slip, it's your fault."
But Malfoy had heard it, loud and clear. There was no erasing it now. He simply kind of stared at the other, watching him be the most Harry Potter he'd ever seen him be. He was blushing, muttering, being a bloody mess, all due to saying something before thinking about it. This clumsiness was absolutely a Potter trait if he'd ever seen one. He suppressed a grin and kind of sniffled. "It's fine, thank you."
Harry didn't know who to thank first. God? Dumbledore? His parents? Maybe Lucius? He was just glad that the other took up on his offer, it would have been quite some trouble to find something else the blonde would have deemed 'worthy' for this exchange.
Blaise would have been right, Draco realized. But he'd changed, and so had his standards. "That's true," he admitted, "but I've changed. I've grown up."
He was already imagining what it could be like. Back in the days, he'd be repulsed by the idea of house unity, but right now he absolutely loved it. It could really work, and it could be a lot of fun. Houses had always held parties but never mixed. Or at least, the Slytherins hadn't been involved in many mixed house parties. Which didn't mean they didn't party, oh no, Malfoy was sure most students didn't really know how chaotic Slytherin parties could get. It really was something to watch out for.
"Hey, can any of you help me out?" he started as he reached for the bundle of papers. They looked at him quite strangely at the sight of the assignment, something else mixed in there as well, though he didn't expect anything different. There were no classes anymore yet here he was with a stack of papers. "I need to bring this to Snape, yet I just can't get this part."
Something in him was scared this moment would be lost forever if they did, that he wouldn't be able to get it back.
Suddenly, he couldn't hold back a small, tired chuckle. He'd realized that while Potter was an evening sleep drunk, he was a morning sleep drunk. How fitting. He shifted a bit in his robes, trying to make them fit a bit more comfortably. They were completely ruined now, full of wrinkles. They'd probably made those ugly red lines on his skin too, from sleeping in them. "My bloody clothes…" He mumbled, a bit annoyed but too dazed to actually say more about it. He wanted to blame Potter for this, because he'd caused this whole situation, right? If only that guy hadn't fallen asleep, right on top of him…
Not sure what to do under the other's gaze, confused by it as well, Harry tried not to focus on it too much. The blond acted differently as he was used to anyway. He leaned back in the chair as he thought about it.
Pansy stepped closer to look at the list, and leaned against Draco's arm, clinging onto it slightly and ignoring his personal space as per usual. She could be strangely touchy with people, but never in an inappropriate way. Malfoy had accepted it ages ago.
"You know, I was planning on mentioning it sooner, but seeing as I didn't get the chance… You and Potter have become very cozy, haven't you?" She didn't move her gaze from the people walking and sliding around on the ice. She merely waited for Draco's answer, or any kind of reaction really.
They joined Luna in the great hall, who smiled at them in greeting. There were quite some students still inside even though Harry had seen a lot of students bundled in jackets heading outside. Just as he sat down Ron and Hermione came walking in, Hermione with a stack of books under her arms.
"What's gotten him bothered?" Pansy asked, faintly staring at the entrance of the great hall, through which Potter had just left. She didn't seem confused, but rather curious.
"I already told you guys, I rather stay here. And I will not be spending Christmas alone, there are other students like Luna. Just go and have fun," he said, trying his best to remain eye contact.
Harry's mind started drifting towards his friends. Ron and Hermione as well, they had given in to old habits as well. Yet things had been so different during the war… Bad memories came back against his will and he sucked in a deep breath. Stop.
He suddenly felt a lot younger, like he'd returned to the time before his sixth year. When he'd run over the lake with his friends, being total prats but having fun nonetheless. He took a few more steps, tried to gather some speed, and then let himself slip over the ice as if he was skating already. He'd totally forgotten about the puzzled Gryffindor who was standing at the edge of the lake already. He hadn't felt this liberated in ages.
He'd kissed him. He'd actually kissed Potter. And not just that, he had done it impulsively, without a second thought and without asking if Harry was okay with that.
It amazed him how easily it came to him to actually alleviate someone, though he wondered if it was something from the Weasley family or Hermione that had rubbed off on him. Harry wasn't sure about that one, to be frank.
It wasn't until Malfoy saw the other's unease that he got reminded of the fact that maybe he did have a secret. Draco had spoken without thinking about it, but couldn't think of anything else now that he was reminded of it. Potter seemed unusually nervous, what did that mean? Was Draco right?
Harry's shoulders curled forward as his chin almost touched his chest as the man almost hissed at him. That man was quite difficult to get around with. Would have thought the war changed people for the good…
After Draco accepted the deal, his hands moved to close his stuff up. Well, how eager. He handed the assignment to his… rival? What the heck was his relationship with the young Malfoy anyway? They always seemed like they couldn't stand one another but now they just made this ridiculous deal. He just hoped Draco would actually do as he said…
Draco had been putting it off for ages but understood that he couldn't do that any longer. He had to tell his friends and right now was the perfect time, as they were all sitting at the same spot. He walked up to them and joined them after a short greeting.
"Yeah, we should…" Draco muttered, eventually looking back at the other, only to see him move away already.
After the argument at the Slytherin table, Blaise left. He clearly didn't want to have anything to do with the upcoming party, and Malfoy didn't stop him. Instead, he and Pansy informed the other students about it. He was very glad to see that nearly all of them were excited about it and willing to help. Draco decided to ask a few of them to help with the decorations, which they agreed to and assumed that the others would help in their own way by bringing stuff to the party when it started. All in all, he felt pretty good when he left the common room with Pansy to show Potter the list he'd made of people who would help them, and what they would do exactly.
Draco merely snickered, feeling like he was winning this fight already. "Are you giving up then? Look, I'm perfectly fine."
His hands found their way into the other's sweater, slipping over the warm skin that was underneath it.
It was a good thing Potter had left him some time to gather himself before he asked the question. Draco wouldn't have been able to answer with a steady voice if it had been asked just a minute ago. "I'm staying here," he replied coolly, leaving it to Harry to figure out what that meant. He would probably have a jolly Christmas over at the Weasley's house, with a lot of friends and people who were dear to him. He was the hero, he deserved that after all.
Yet it was to be expected regarding their previous relationship. Feeling a little bit daring he stepped closer. "Go ahead, I'm all ears."
There was another sound, and this time he could actually see a line shooting through the ice beneath his feet. He suddenly realized how deep this lake was, and what kind of creatures were living in it. Draco had seen them often enough through the windows in the Slytherin common room, and he wasn't keen on meeting any. He wanted to move forward, but couldn't. He was completely paralyzed.
While he had practically told the other to tell him about the book, he honestly couldn't even follow what the other was saying. His thoughts were focused on whole other things, as he still had a specific Slytherin in the back of his mind. Malfoy had said he needed time to think about it, but Harry didn't want him to. He didn't need the other to straight-up tell him that, no, I'm sorry, but i do not feel the same. If anything, he was just glad they were friends.
Draco didn't wait for Potter to catch up with his speed. He'd just have to follow him and pay attention. Just like before, Malfoy wasn't the nicest teacher, but he did get the point across using less nice methods. Maybe that was the only way to get the messy-headed boy to actually learn something.
"Any other places? I wouldn't bet on the two of them hiding in the library, but you'll never know with these two."
"The question isn't how I should do it, but when I'll get myself to do it," Draco explained while leaning back against the headboard. "I can just tell them, that's not hard. It's not some deep dark secret," he let out a short, breathy laugh. "Anyway… Have you talked to the party to anyone yet?"
Draco put the potion, which was empty now, away and averted his eyes. Yes, Potter had actually just compared his smile to a Christmas miracle. Why in the world was that such a big deal to him? "I guess I'm done here then... ?" He asked after a little while.
Not hesitating one bit he made his way out. It was only when he was far from the room, out of the dungeons and on the stairs, that he let out a relieved breath. Though he didn't really understand why he felt this shaky, somewhat put-off, around there
Honestly, he was turning into Granger. He let out a slightly irritated sigh and leaned back in his chair.
Still, his eyes didn't seem to be bothered by that as his sight was glazed over every now and then. He saw the sentences double and overlapping one another, which made him sigh way too many times as he tried to blink it away to regain focus. He hadn't been really listening to anything Malfoy said and he fiercely hoped the other wouldn't ask him for any repetition of his words.
"Listen, I'm either gonna resume my sleep or get some coffee, because this ain't working," he said as he stretched. Merlin, he hated not being brisk. "I don't know about you, but I suppose you need breakfast too."
The blonde smiled, his cheeks were a bit flushed from the compliment, but also from the kissing that had preceded it.
Man, this was sad. Tracing his teeth with his tongue before scratching his head, Harry contemplated what to do or say. Should he ask him to come along with them to Hogsmeade? He was Draco Malfoy after all… Plus Hermione wouldn't let him see another day if he did.
"You're not some object, Draco. Yes, you're right, I have no idea what your childhood had been like and I have not that much experience with any adults taking up my parents role, yet I'm sure your parents have their reasons. But please, don't talk about yourself like that." His chest felt full as he looked the other in the eyes and he barely dared to continue to speak. Though the other knew about his feelings already, it was quite hard to express them. Especially in a situation like this. He shouldn't let them get in the way right now. Harry couldn't help himself though. He bit his lip, brushing his thumb over the other boy's cheek. "You're extremely important..." he whispered.
This movement made the Slytherin curl up and utter a shaky moan. His hands slipped up to the other's shoulders out of reflex, making his arms move even more into the sweater and causing it to crawl up even more. How could Potter know his sweet spots without having done this before? Or was it a general thing?
Malfoy simply didn't care to be fussy about it anymore. He absolutely couldn't bring himself to care anymore, because he'd already let his walls down. He'd already accepted the hug. His standards were already being ignored, so all he could do was roll with it. Besides, it felt rather relieving to hug someone. He wasn't used to it, but that didn't mean he couldn't get used to it. As weird and unusual as it was, it was a lot better than feeling bad and alone.
Again, Harry's mind shifted to a whole different topic as if his basic functions were totally out of control. He turned to look at Draco, failing to notice how out of place the other felt, as he spoke under his breath. "It's almost Christmas." The blonde gave him a mildly surprised look. "Yes, it is…" He answered slowly. He'd avoided thinking about Christmas ever since his father's letter. He wasn't in the mood to discuss it now either.
Malfoy looked at the ground, avoiding the other's gaze. "Actually, I think the room let you walk in. That could mean it thinks I would allow you to enter. No one's ever done it before, and I've never been able to lock the door..." He spoke, still thinking about it and trying to figure it out.
"No specific violin pieces no, but I do know some songs with violin pieces in there or in which someone replaces an instrument like the piano with it..." he babbled on. Although he appreciated the sounds from musical instruments, Harry had never bothered to know the names of the pieces that were played. Just like now, he had enjoyed listening to the blond play, but that was about it. He had no idea what kind of piece it was.
"Well, I just happen to have lost my appetite due to my mood," Harry decided to at least tell the blonde part of the reason. He scratched the back of his head. It felt weird to have someone worry about him like this about him not finishing up his meal. Yet it felt kind of reassuring like you could fall back on that person.
The request had put the other off. Draco sounded so serious about this. But why did he ask such a thing? Was he ashamed about his actions after all? Nah, no way. He had said it himself, he was not the kind of person to be affected by such trivial things. Something about Draco's posture and the look on his face was off though. "Is that all?" he simply asked. "I suppose it is," Draco replied, taking his hands off the chair he'd been leaning on and straightening up. There wasn't much else he could say about it.
Harry didn't dare to look behind him anymore, not with his cheeks set ablaze like this. With unusually bigger steps he made his way towards the lake.
"Not sure if Pomfrey is going to let me go," came the mumbled reply. Harry casually wondered if she had seen them before rubbing his cheek against his shoulder. "Might have to carry a water tank around to be set free." It sounded kinda dramatic as if he was held like a prisoner. Ron… He didn't feel like going to the great hall after their fight. Maybe he could hang with Luna or in the library if Pomfrey decided to let him go.
Draco took some time to collect himself before he responded. He didn't want his voice to crack midway. "I'd like you to stay here, please." He couldn't be alone right now. It would destroy him. He would reduce to the ugly mess he'd been during his sixth year, the mess that had been sobbing in bathrooms and destroying himself over a heavy burden.
For once in his life, Draco didn't care. He didn't care that his hair was becoming a mess, he didn't care that his skin was beginning to stain at places that were absolutely visible and he didn't care that he was making a fool out of himself.
Harry was surprised by how determined Malfoy was to make sure he got himself checked, might as well say he felt flattered. Still dizzy, he sometimes lost footing and had to rely on the blonde catching him. It made him feel quite weird to be so vulnerable around the boy who had been so cold towards him, who he was so-called enemies with. Harry realized too late they had left the library together without any notice to his friends.
"Thank you," he mumbled. He'd never been judged for his work before, this was such a new experience. It felt a bit pressured. Especially because it was Potter.
It then occurred to him that Potter had a legit reason to be here: he'd come to check the location for the party. Totally obvious and without bad intentions. Draco had just been so stupid to not lock the door. Though, he had always assumed the room did this for him. He'd never locked the door, but no one had ever come in.
Harry wasn't sure if that ceased his worries about it, but he decided to shake it off for now. "We should decide what kind of party it's going to become then if that's the case," he stated. "Whether it's gonna be more like a gathering or a big party."
A little hum left the boy's lips. "Possibly," he mumbled. He didn't really know what had caused the nightmare to be held back. Maybe Malfoy was right and it was due Pomfrey's potion. If that were the case he would love to get some more, yet he couldn't handle getting addicted to such a thing. He hung his head down, his hands cupping around his face as he let out a frustrated groan. Why was it so hard to just deal with this? If he were to just sleep normally he wouldn't have to come back here so many these times.
It was one of the things he'd rather keep to himself. It was a shameful kind of behavior that he wasn't proud of. However, he felt like things had been getting ridiculous lately. He had to put an end to it, and the easiest way to do that was by explaining why he'd been a prat towards Potter.
Harry felt his body shiver at the tunes that came from the violin, accompanied by the feeling that radiated from the other. It swayed from higher tunes that slowly went back and forth to lower tunes, sometimes they would sound more rushed.
Harry had heard the cracking thou and had stiffened, allowing the snowball Malfoy had sent his way to him in the face. A soft curse left his mouth as he tried to get the ice away as it melted and dripped down his neck.
Harry frowned, wanting to ask why when he realized. Of course. The Malfoy's were probably trying to get away, as to why their son should have to stay at school. He slowly nodded, rubbing his forehead. "Same here," he mumbled. "I think I told you before how Ron asks me each year to come over, but after Fred's death, I don't feel like I should be there."
The Golden trio sat there for a few minutes in silence, eating their breakfast, until the time came that the couple had to pack their stuff. As Ron packed the last of his things, back at the dorms, Harry sat on the end of the bed, silently observing the other. Ron finished up quickly, and they made their way to the common room to wait for Hermione to come to join them.
As Harry walked away, Draco got up. "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAAAID." "Oh my, Malfoy. I didn't know you knew muggle memes, how interesting~" Harry grinned, making sure he kept walking. He was wasting time with this childish behavior.
"Everyone has some Potter, mine just have been hidden well enough. Don't think yours have though, mister 'Christmas miracle'." He sneered back, grinning a bit. Were they really going back to their old bickering just like that? Merlin, they really were a hopeless case, weren't they?
Draco took his time to fully wake up and then worked himself off of the bed to take a quick trip to the great hall. When Malfoy reached the great hall, he couldn't help but notice that Potter had gone back to his friends, instead of the Gryffindor dorms, which Malfoy had previously assumed. He supposed it was only natural for those three to spend their last time together before the Christmas holidays started.
Pulling back lightly, he brushed the wet stripes going down the other's cheeks away with the back of his hand, shaking his hand after he had done so. "Well, just knowing whether it was something I did or what else caused... this," he wiped another tear away to point out the obvious breakdown of the blond.
They lingered, taunting him from behind a wall of rules and standards. A wall that was now coated with a layer of sadness. Draco had reached a point where his pain had made him irrational. Where he couldn't think straight anymore because of his emotions. He was probably about to do something very stupid.
Draco gave him a confused look, not sure what to do with his words. He knew Harry often talked without giving others the right context, he'd noticed that ages ago, but this didn't help the situation he was in now. How should he even respond to this?
Hermione looked at Neville strangely until it seemed to click and her head darted forward past Ron's frame. "Your nightmares haven't stopped?"
Harry was gonna be bothered by the other moving, but he guessed that sitting up wasn't that a comfortable position to sleep in. When it got quiet and the movements stopped, he pried his other arm from underneath himself to wiggle underneath the other's neck to just slightly tighten his hold. Harry's heartbeat hadn't calmed down yet, but the heat that radiated from Malfoy was pretty reassuring.
"You are gonna regret ever saying that, Draco Malfoy." He then resumed his way to the blonde, snowball ready to throw.
Oh, bloody hell, that made so much more sense. Although, that would mean they had to spend more time with each other, didn't it? Harry wasn't too sure if he liked that. He coughed and put his stuff down again. Oh gosh, that was pretty awkward. Think Harry. "You know… You could have just simply said you wanted to spend time with me instead of offering me help with homework after repeatedly telling me how to not do it." Did that sound weird?
Draco suppressed a chuckle and folded his hands in his lap. "I know what you need. You need Quidditch. You're no good, stuck in a bed all day. Fresh air and some exercise might be better than staying put here. As soon as you're healthy enough to leave, we could just claim the pitch for a bit," he suggested.
He was nearly yelling by now, trying to suppress his angry sobs. "Why don't they care, Harry? Why has my father never cared?"
"Yes," he continued their conversation. "I'm quite keen on my role" Harry felt himself grimace as he eyed the other.
Draco nodded faintly. It had indeed been a while since he'd played, maybe he should try to pick it up again sometime.
"Yes. You will indeed," he returned, sliding closer as he felt like his heart was about to explode. This guy would cause his death, unlike the damn dark lord…
"Mornin'..." he mumbled as he raked a hand through his messy, blond hair. He probably looked terrible.
As she read it, her eyebrows arched even further. It took her a while before she could speak. Ron, curious now as well, snatched the paper from her hands. He stifled a laugh that sounded more like a scoff, as he didn't believe his eyes. "Harry calling you Mal?" he quoted, looking at the blonde. Hermione narrowed her eyes. "I don't think Harry would ever write something like this, even though this is his handwriting," she stated. Ron nodded in agreement behind her, not bothering to back her up as she raised her head a bit. "So, what did you do to Harry. Speak."
He'd said it to protect himself, but when he looked back at it, it was a bit… well, very rude actually. Maybe that was really just the thing that'd put him into Slytherin. He thought about apologizing but didn't. Potter wasn't worth his effort, right?
"I'm sorry," he said, resting his forehead against that of the Slytherin that was obviously overwhelmed by his emotions. "I should have just kept my bloody mouth shut. Ofcourse they care, they're your parents."
For a while, he wasn't sure how to react. He just kind of stood there, unable to move. Then it dawned on him, and functioning became even harder.
"Getting uncomfortably friendly, I see?" The blond boy responded, refraining from looking too surprised. Hiding behind disgust and irritation, his to-go escape plan. He and Potter weren't friends, where'd that idea even come from? Utterly stupid… right…?
Draco flashed her an apologetic smile and sat down in one of the unoccupied chairs. How should he explain what had happened? He doubted they would approve of him hanging around Potter, so telling them what really happened would cause quite some uproar. There was, however, one good thing about his friends being Slytherins: they respected each other's privacy and didn't press a subject when someone was clearly not comfortable talking about it. It was a form of respect.
"It is not, Parkinson," Malfoy interrupted her, raising his voice a bit. "I've told you what I want you to know, and I'm kindly asking you to drop the matter right now." A sneer began to form on his face, a clear sign of his anger. She just shouldn't have put it like that, she should've kept her distance. He had to admit he was a bit touchy lately, but if Parkinson was so good at reading people, she should've noticed that.
Harry's breathing came out in high, fast spaces while he stood there, shaking on his feet when their eyes finally met.
Draco frantically shook his head. "You don't understand, you don't know them. You don't know what it's like, what they're like..." He shuddered, feeling the start of a headache caused by all the crying. He ignored it.
It was when he was about to give up on his work and search for Neville, ten minutes in his work, that the said boy came walking up to him with a thick book. He looked nicely surprised when he saw him. "Harry, it's good to see you. How are you?" As the boy closed in Harry turned around in pleasant surprise.
He thought he would miss that atmosphere this Christmas, though he had chosen for this himself, yet with their plans to hold a party to include all houses that might change. Christmas at the Weasley's sounded amazing.
Breathing in the scent of the bed, which somehow smelled like lavender, Harry shifted his weight to look up. "Hmm. Maybe if…" he started, eyes scanning the room. "Paper…"
He took a deep breath, forcing himself to keep looking at the two Gryffindors. This wasn't the time to give into his emotions. "I can only hope you're willing to accept my apology. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you, please say so. I know it won't make up for the things I've done, but I want you to know I'm willing to at least try my best."
"That's the thing though. It's in your head. That's the worst place for a problem to be. Voldemort may be gone, but the scars aren't. Just like the ones on your skin, there are a few in your head. You can't see them, but you do absolutely feel them." It was all spoken out of his own experience, which was the only reason for Malfoy to be able to spill such cliché, philosophical words. "People shouldn't tell you it's 'just in your head', because that's exactly the problem," he concluded, his voice a tad bitter.
The longer they stayed like this, the more used Draco got to it and the less he thought about it. In the end, he had almost sort of accepted it, because his mind had already wandered off to the next topic. He felt too lazy to be fussy about anything right now anyway.
He grasped the other's sweater just to get a grip on something, because everything else was slipping away from him.
Harry knew it would be useless to deny it, the other was watching him and had clearly seen him shift further into the bed. "Nightmares," he simply stated. As he allowed himself to shut his eyes while resting his head on the wall behind him, a frown etched on his features. He had slept well last time he was in the hospital wing, maybe it was the atmosphere of healing and nursery that had helped him, as he wouldn't want to say it was thanks to Malfoy.
Little memories of the previous years started coming back to him. Small things he'd noticed about the other, but which he hadn't thought much of at the time. Things like how confident and handsome he looked on the quidditch field, or how kind he was to others.
No, he was not supposed to do that. He was not going to move his problems onto Potter. The Gryffindor didn't deserve that sort of weight on his shoulders. Malfoy was never going to say this out of his own initiative. Only if the other was very curious, he might be willing to share some of it to get rid of some of the confusion. But that would only be because he didn't want Harry to be confused or irritated. If he wanted to know what was up, he would have to ask. Otherwise, Draco didn't want to thrust it upon the other.
"Is it really now?" Draco mused back, shifting into a more comfortable position on the bed. He looked around for a bit and already felt his mind wander off to the events that happened there the previous day. It was never going to leave him completely, wasn't it? Potter was never going to leave him. Well, not his mind anyway.
It had been nice, the quiet undramatic moment just before that girl had come. He wondered if tomorrow things would be back to old. He kinda wished he didn't have to endure the next day with Draco challenging him again and the like.
Entering the hall they reached the Gryffindor table and sat down. For some reason, he felt quite conscious about his hair all of a sudden, as if someone had spoken ill about. Not that he could blame them, he just never got into the whole 'let's try different things to do with my hair'-period. Being locked up in a closet and all did not really do much a favor to his hair and skin after all.
Not that it hadn't happened before, she was probably just not up for it at that moment. She moved a bit closer to him, excluding the other Slytherins from their conversation. "Listen, Draco. I've never judged your unusual behavior after the war. I've tried to help you when you asked for it, but mostly let you figure it out on your own, I know you prefer that. Right now you're acting more strange than ever. If I didn't know better, I'd say it's sixth year all over aga-"
"I never asked you to stay, Malfoy," he threw back, voice somewhat forming a hiss yet lacking real emotion. "If you didn't want to stay you could have just left, I never forced you to anything. But if this is how you really think then don't stick to me, I get attached to people."
What didn't amuse him was how he noticed how long it had been that anyone had given him a hug, how desperate he himself had been to actually hold on to someone. But this was not about him, not about his needs. It would be unfair to let Malfoy have to take care of him. Unlike Malfoy, he would release hot, wet tears and get all snotty most probably. After taking care of him yesterday, it would be too much to make him have to get tissues or anything. Harry took a breath, which he noticed was somewhat shaky. This actually made him feel very conscious of the situation all of the sudden.
The blonde faintly wondered what it would look like without the sweater covering everything up, but kept himself satisfied with the accidental revealing he'd caused with his tracing touches. Draco finally understood why students liked to use this room.
Malfoy nodded. He looked back and noticed that his violin was also still there, forgotten next to the couch.
Not in a way that would leave him in pain, but in a way that would leave him both breathless and longing for more.
He sighed and dropped his hand. "Because I laughed. Or well, it wasn't really a laugh, more like a sound that kind of sounded like a laugh in some way, but you thought it was a miracle because I never laugh and then you called it a Christmas miracle because it's almost christmas." The words just spilled out in an unflattering mess. He usually preferred to keep his speech formal and decent, but this time that really didn't work, somehow.
"My parents are gone," he spoke, his voice soft and already on the verge of breaking again. "They've fled the country, left me behind."
"What's so funny?" Malfoy asked after hearing Harry's snicker. He'd had a very worried expression before, and seeing it turn to a more positive one was great, but it did make Draco curious.
It seemed like he already had though, and there was no stopping the chain reaction now that Draco had started it.
Draco had not wanted the other to see him like this. It showed that he was weak, that he couldn't even control his own emotions. That he wasn't always the stiff, controlled Malfoy others knew him to be. It showed that he was merely human after all.
"How, how in the world can you be so… So careless? Excuse me for putting it like this, but do you even know what you're doing? This isn't healthy, you've been hospitalized for it already, do you honestly want to go back just after being released for half an hour?" Yes, he was furious, but mostly because he couldn't bear to see Potter neglecting himself like this. He didn't know why he just did.
"Ooooor we just head for the kitchens and I brew you some myself." That might be a better idea, he assumed. Yet he doubted the house-elves would even let him do something at all…
It wasn't like Draco said this to be mean or mocking, he was just being practical. Maybe it was also a bit because he was very used to people doing stuff for him, but that wasn't how he wanted to treat Potter.
Harry only realized he had spoken out loud when it clicked as of how he knew his voice was hoarse, and in frustration, he started to assemble the blanket away on the bed.
Homework and the dark lord, a dreadful combination indeed. Malfoy had always seen Potter in a more confident state. He'd never seen him this tiny and tired, curled up in blankets. It was a strange sight, but somehow a bit endearing.
Once he entered the great hall, he noticed that she was not there. Neither at the Ravenclaw table nor the Gryffindor, he even checked Hufflepuff and Slytherin. With a snort, Harry looked around. Neville wasn't here as well. Where would that girl even go to around this time? He doubted if she was in the library but decided to just take a look - where, as suspected, the blonde wasn't hanging out as well.
Draco saw the hesitation on the other's face. It probably sounded a bit dangerous to him, and that was understandable, but Draco tended to like dangerous sometimes. If Potter were to hang out with him, he'd have to get used to that. He shifted a bit, trying to sit in a more comfortable position, and thought about the other's words. "Look, as much as I like to plan things out in detail weeks before it actually happens, I think it might be best to form a group of planners first. Preferably at least one person from each house. And it probably can't hurt to ask some Ravenclaws to help with this too. If we start figuring stuff out in detail right now, we'll forget half of it anyway."
This did him no good. With a little jump, he got back on his feet again, looking anywhere but at the blond on the sofa.
Flushing as all the attention was drawn to them at once, Harry picked the other from the ground. Well, he tried - keyword 'tried'. "Stop it. You're embarrassing," he hissed. "Fuck if I care, unlike you I know how to talk myself out of stuff. So, I guess you're the only one being affected by this," he smirked.
This was why he'd mentioned places like the lake or the forest to be suitable for a date. Yes, it was freezing, he hadn't really thought about that since he didn't mind the cold that much, but at least they weren't as crowded as the castle. If you wanted to go somewhere with a lover, just to have a nice time together, this would be the place to go to. He sure preferred this, as opposed to the little privacy there was in the castle.
Draco looked up, wearing a confused expression. Now that the Gryffindor had gotten up he was cold again.
Him. Walking into the great hall, looking like that, accompanying Harry Potter, who looked just as bad?
Harry's cheeks burned up at the thought of them casually hooking up and cuddling. Well, obviously he didn't mind that. Why would he even? It made him wonder what the other exactly wanted from him though. "That would be of no problem at all," he freely expressed, holding their eye contact now suddenly a way harder thing to do.
"I've never underestimated that," he said, opening up some books and looking over at the other. "Come on then."
That was not how he had planned that to go, not exactly. He felt his legs start to give away, energy drawn by his alarmed senses. His head whipped around as his arms couldn't find the soft mattress. 'Where had that bed gone to?' he wondered as he let himself fall on his butt. He was so damn tired.
Draco had never experienced something like this, and as much as it overwhelmed him, he couldn't help but love it.
With a sigh, he decided he probably should leave this place as he was spending way too much time in here. As he grabbed his things he hummed to himself. He should just drop that assignment off at Snape and dump his stuff on his bed after that. Then he could decide what to do afterward.
And he didn't stop himself from walking away as soon as Potter scared him, because it was a good thing. He should walk away from him, he wasn't supposed to be his 'pall' or in this case, 'Mal'. Potter was forbidden fruit for someone like Draco, and he damn well knew that. He'd known it for a long time.
He stopped writing as he realized how he had called up only food and drinks related stuff and scratched his chin. Maybe they could get their own floating candles in the room of requirement as decoration as well. They would need to see what the room had in store for them. "Not sure about the decorations as I have no idea what the room of requirement is gonna give us. Should have to check if there's a tree included," he mumbled as he wrote down the last few things down on the parchment.
"I didn't really know what your plans were, so for now I just put down that it was a Christmas celebration," she said, handing him one of the papers.
"They don't love me like parents love their children. They never have. My mom might, but my dad's word is stronger than hers. I'm merely an important object that has lost its worth, and thus lost its importance."
Harry's grin grew wider. He never teased someone in a matter that excited him for their reactions this much. He had teased Ginny yet she never had quite those reactions, rather laughed a bit or brushed him off. Maybe this was why Malfoy had been going around mocking people in the old days, he could quite understand it.
If they were in there, which he somehow doubted, he didn't want to disturb whatever what was going on there.
The thought that he was glad the room of requirement existed crossed his mind. They certainly could not have been doing these things in the hospital wing without anyone walking by and seeing them. He knew some people would be fairly surprised, maybe even shocked, if they were to find them like this.
"Sounds great," the Slytherin nodded and followed Potter to the kitchens. He'd never been there, but he'd heard about it. He knew Hufflepuff had its dormitories around there. He had also met some of the house elves, due to his extremely fucked up studying and sleeping schedule in his sixth year. There had been a few occasions where he'd been studying until four in the morning or pacing around the common room because he couldn't sleep. Because this was the time when house-elves tended to clean rooms, he'd met them a few times. He'd also woken up a few times with a small plate of snacks and tea next to his books. It was charming how caring they could be.
What now? Where they gonna stay in here or something? Surely, he didn't mind if he had to listen to another piece, but it also had something rare written in this scene. Because he would never think Draco Malfoy would smile at him like that. Wait, why was he even...?
While he should have just either have run or made the other forget he had ever even said that, he just laid there. This was comfortable and felt way too good for his sleep-deprived self to give up on. His chest was in knots, it made him feel paralyzed. With a small sigh, he dared to snuggle somewhat closer.
Mrs. Weasley had made him another Christmas sweater, she had probably sent it to Ron. But why? Had she already assumed he wouldn't join them this Christmas? Harry would feel bad for not wearing it. He got out of the sweater he was wearing and slipped the red garment over his head as he let out a deep breath.
