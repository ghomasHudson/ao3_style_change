-“Let’s go.”- Draco told his friends. Blaise raised a brow.
When they got to the room to which Harry had been moved, Rivers left.
-“So, your soulmate who betrayed and bullied us for years but apparently he did it to protect us is now with us. How do we feel about it?”- Ron asked.
Maybe it was for the best.
-"You know that you can change that, right?"- Draco told him, looking him in the eye for the first time since their session earlier that day.
-"Uh..I'll try. But I know that this is not the first time, Malfoy. I'm not stupid."- Harry said and Malfoy snorted.
-“You have been protecting that boy for so many years. How do I know you’re not lying?”- Bellatrix asked.
He took his cloak and silently made his way to the Astronomy Tower.
It was so juxtapose from Draco's usual behaviour that it was nice seeing this side of him.
Draco blinked and looked back at Harry who was grinning.
Harry had been escorting him to classes.
Hermione sent a Patronus to Headmistress McGonagall explaining the situation.
Just maybe..
-"You're dressing differently."- Harry noticed. Draco usually wore a grey uniform, but tonight he was wearing tight, black pants and a navy blue, long-sleeved shirt. Draco was usually self-conscious about the Dark Mark, but tonight he had the sleeves rolled up, exposing his arms and the top buttons of his shirt were undone.
-"Alright, spit it out."- Draco told Harry. Harry was a bit taken aback but casted a Muffliato first.
-“Harry, you’re gonna miss dinner.”- Ron told him, but Harry did not come down.
-"Just wanted to make sure he got back safely."- Harry said, but it felt like a lie.
But he didn’t really like touching humans and he didn’t like humans touching him.
Draco waited until he couldn't hear Potter's steps...until he couldn't smell Potter's scent of pines and vanilla any longer to smack Blaise. Hard.
-“Breathe with me, Draco.”- Blaise whispered soothingly. They breathed together for a long time. They breathed together until Draco’s gasps stopped. Until he felt like he could breathe again.
-“You like me!”- Draco stated, laughing brightly. Harry wanted to deny it, but he was drowning in Draco’s laugh. He had never heard the blonde laugh so brightly and carefree before.
He told Blaise not to wait for him and Harry took his chance.
Then, they gave him gifts. Pansy gave him a new Potions set and Blaise took him (secretly) to a tattoo parlour along with Pansy. Where the Dark Mark once laid, there was now a beautiful, moving tattoo of a Narcissus. The dark mark was barely noticeable now.
-"Why are you so angry, though? It's not like Hermione's gonna tell."-
He also knew that Harry wasn't sleeping.
-“Of course, they couldn’t be with me every time and they couldn’t go against Nott’s orders or he would tell aunt Bella and well...you’ve seen how that turns out for me.”- Draco explained.
Pour un bouquet de roses
-"Don't get your knickers in a twist, Potter. He's fine."- Parkinson started, but Harry could tell that she was nervous.
-"Harry dear, have you felt good in your last year?"- Narcissa asked suddenly. Harry smiled.
-"S-sorry. I'll come back later."- Draco excused himself.
Harry found out that even though he was highly embarrassed by the names, he didn't particularly hate the feeling Draco gave him.
Harry tilted his head to the side curiously.
Draco snorted.
-“Oh, don’t you know?”- Luna stared at him with her wand in her hand. Harry held his breath,
His friends weren’t talking to him.
-"Did he?"- Hermione wondered out loud.
-“Oh,
-"You haven't eaten in three days, Potter. Eat calmly."- Draco commented.
, but James had proven that he actually liked Lily. That he loved Lily.
But there he was, carefully petting a Thestral alone.
-"Are you gonna go to the edge tonight?"- Harry asked suddenly. Draco stared at him for a moment and then shook his head.
like you?"-
-"Where is he?"- Harry could barely notice that everyone was watching him intently and he really didn't care. Where was Draco?
-“Weasley, Granger.”- Draco greeted politely. Then he turned to Harry,
A couple of days after, Harry had felt an incredibly unbearable amount of pain.
People could argue that not feeling was scary and dangerous; Harry could argue back that feeling was just as scary and dangerous.
-“He’s not down here yet.”- Blaise said when Harry walked into the Slytherin common room.
Back and forth.
-“Draco likes me!? He likes me and I knew nothing about it!?”- Blaise rolled his eyes.
-"I'm sure Granger is very capable of keeping a secret and not betraying people's trust, unlike you."- Draco said and left Harry's office.
They didn’t greet each other in public or sat together in classes. No.
-“What on Merlin’s name are you doing in here? We are supposed to find Potter’s hiding place.”- Theodore Nott hissed.
Harry observed how Draco had his hand tightly clasped against Blaise’s and couldn’t help but feel jealous.
He would kill Draco if he ever saw him again.
-“Well, well, well, what do we have here?”-
-"This doesn't mean I trust you."- Draco muttered sleepily.
-"You'll settle just fine, Harry. Our son, Draco, is a nice boy, he's just shy."- Narcissa said, earning a snort from Lucius. Narcissa glared at him in return.
-“I need to move them. I actually…need to make uh..different movements to feel satisfied. I mean, I can control it if I want to but it just builds up inside of me.”- Harry nodded in understanding.
Hagrid had told him to buy his clothes and then wait for him at Ollivander's.
-"Oh?"-
-"Draco."- Harry whimpered helplessly.
Everything else could.
-“Please, don’t hug me!”- Pansy stopped dead in her tracks and paled visibly.
-"Why didn't you tell me?"- Harry asked.
-“Hermione knows!?”-
-"Just let him go, Potter."- Draco said quietly.
He didn't mind the jinx, he knew he deserved every bit of hate he got. That, however, didn't mean that he wasn't angry about it or that it didn't hurt. He also felt royally embarrassed at the fact that Potter now knew about it.
-“The first dance, Harry. The champions have to dance first.”- Harry’s eyes widened.
Harry smirked knowingly.
-“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”- Draco said, walking gracefully with his head up high. Harry followed him.
-“Malfoy.”- Harry greeted, petting the same thestral Draco was petting. Draco jumped a bit seeming startled by Harry’s sudden presence.
Harry hadn’t emerged from the lake just yet and he was running out of time.
Draco felt nostalgic.
He stared at her in confusion and then at Ron.
-"I'm fine, Rivers. Really."- Draco reassured.
Ron groaned.
-“This is getting ridiculous. What has gotten into you, mate?”- Ron told him. Harry uncovered his face, revealing very flushed cheeks.
Watching him returning to his seat, Harry felt a mix of emotions but most of all, he felt an inexplicably big amount of pride for Draco.
And then, it had all become slightly better. Though Harry was still suspicious, he gave Draco the benefit of the doubt.
-“For once, I’m going to trust you.”- Harry said.
wardrobe! He's never had a wardrobe for himself.
And Draco couldn't stay away, no matter how hard he tried.
-"What?"- Harry asked, instinctively checking if anyone was around to hurt Draco.
Harry held him tight and whispered nice things in his ear.
-"What?"- Harry blushed.
-“Since you what?”- Draco asked with an arched brow.
Back and forth.
-"What did you need help with?"- Draco asked instead. Harry decided not to push it because this was the first time that Draco talked to him so much. Draco was a very good teacher, Harry realised, and before they both knew it, it was time for dinner.
Draco stared at Harry’s eyes.
-“Remember when the..the D-Dark Lord stayed at the Manor?”- Harry nodded, -“Well, he..he touched me in p-places I didn’t..”- Draco’s voice broke and he curled more in himself.
-"Then why did you?"- Harry was so warm, juxtapose to Draco's usual coldness.
-"Okay...what's that?"-
-"Yeah. Have you been well?"- Harry asked, smiling a bit. Draco felt a faint rush of comfiness invading him and he was able to relax a bit.
-"Oh yeah, totally. You're my next charity project."- Draco said sarcastically.
How come he was the last one to know how he felt?
Voldemort was back.
-"I'm doing the best I can, Malfoy."- Rivers said and started treating Harry's wounds.
-"You should go back to your room."- Draco said softly, stopping in front of the entrance of the Slytherin common room.
He slowly calmed down, allowing his hands and arms to move freely wherever they wanted.
-“Draco.”- Harry interrupted him. Draco hummed.
that song.
Draco gulped.
Harry was enjoying himself that day.
That one hurt Draco physically and he had to hold in a gasp of pain.
Sirius laughed.
Harry petrified the student and helped Draco up.
-"Blaise knows. I have a plan, Harry. And I need him for that plan. After Hogwarts, I'm going to move to France and I'm going to open a flower shop. However, I have no money to do that. He has agreed that, somewhere in the future, maybe not right after I finish my studies but some day, he'll pay for my trip to France. Of course, he thinks I'm only going on vacation and has no idea about what I want to actually do, but it's the best I've got."- Draco told him honestly, ending with a tired sigh. Harry stopped caressing his hair.
Blaised raised his brows amusedly and stood up.
They were both in Draco's dorm having a mini Christmas celebration despite Draco's protests. Harry had just won a game of wizarding chess against the Slytherin and Draco was cursing quietly, making Harry laugh.
-“Harry, do you want more pumpkin juice?”- Hermione asked in a knowing tone that broke Harry out of his trance.
-"Of course, we don't want you to get in trouble."- Hermione told him.
-"I could ask you the same question. Come on, let's sit somewhere."- Harry told him gently. That comfiness from before invaded Draco again.
Draco sat down directly across him and for a moment, their eyes met.
-"What did he just say?"- Harry found himself asking.
There it was.
-"You have to understand, Harry. He
That was a lie, Blaise and Pansy listened as well, but he couldn’t talk with them. It wasn’t safe.
And Draco wasn’t talking to him. At all.
-"What about me? Can you feel my emotions?"- Harry asked. Draco nodded.
It was desperate and angry. As if Harry was pouring everything he couldn't say through words in the kiss.
-“Why?”- he asked finally. Draco raised a brow and sighed.
"- Sirius greeted cheerfully,
A moving butterfly adorned Harry’s injured wrist.
Harry sat beside him, glancing at the moving flowers that laid over the Dark Mark. Most of them were narcissus, but there were a lot of water lilies and daisies as well.
So fucking tired.
-"What? Befriending Malfoy?"- Ron asked incredulously. Harry nodded.
He found himself enjoying Harry's presence a lot.
."- the boggart said venomously.
Hedwig not coming meant that Harry had given up on him.
-"And what are you gonna do about it?"-
He noticed that Harry was eating less as the weeks went by. He noticed how Harry’s eye bags were noticeable one day and gone the next, meaning that he was glamouring them. He noticed the fake smiles, and how Harry didn’t seem happy. He noticed how Harry disappeared at least two times a week.
-"But I don't like how he treats you at all. Why haven't you told anyone?"- Harry asked curiously.
-“Merlin!”- Harry said, blushing even more. He ran his hair through his fingers.
-“I’ve been good, thanks for asking.”- Draco replied softly, and politely. It was quite a shock to Harry. He hadn’t heard him speak since the war and was quiet surprised at how much his tone had changed.
-"I ah...I don't even know how to explain it. I just, I'm spending time with this boy and I didn't even realise that I spent that much time with him till Ron pointed it out yesterday and I don't even know how I feel about the entire thing."- Harry explained quickly.
Harry and Draco laughed.
Draco was crying.
Someone used the Cruciatus Curse on Draco, but instead of screaming, Draco’s hands emitted a silver glow with purple specks.
-“You’re going to take my eye out.”- Draco said calmly, carefully lowering Ron’s finger. Ron’s cheeks went as red as his hair, feeling some sort of deja vu.
Their friendship, however, hadn't last long, for Draco had been put in Slytherin and Harry in Gryffindor.
-“May I sit? Ron’s being a nightmare, not even Hermione can stand him.”- Harry said, laughing quietly.
-“Let’s see.”- Harry breathed and kissed Draco.
-“W-what are you..”-
-“Bollocks. Come on. I can’t leave you here all by yourself.”- Harry said.
Draco scoffed.
-“Mhm.”- Harry agreed. Draco went quiet again.
like there was something more. Something deeper.
He had seen him for no longer than 5 seconds (at most).
Their friendship had broken when Draco had called Hermione a mudblood during their second year.
-“What’s wrong?”-
-“I don’t mind, you know?”- Draco told him. Harry looked at him with disbelief.
Draco’s mind stopped working and didn’t even notice that Harry was dragging him to the carriage until he was already sitting down.
. Draco's the brightest
And that only added up to his pain.
He felt to the ground, not able to hide his gasp.
-"It's over, Draco. You're free."-
In the months that followed, Harry found himself spending more and more time with Draco. At first, it was sort of awkward.
-"Course we are, you prat."- Harry was flushed.
He felt his own magic burning inside of him, aching to come out.
."- said the boggart, gesturing at Draco's mechanical arm with his hands. Draco winced but didn't back down.
-"Happy."- Harry took his time before answering,
-"That's good. Keep studying hard and we might discuss that little vacation of yours soon."- Lucius said. Draco beamed.
Harry decided to call it a night and walked out before anyone could ask him anything.
-“Leave him alone!”- Sending the group of students flying to the end of the hall as a deep red glow blasted from within him.
They both heard someone chanting a hex, but they weren't fast enough to dodge it. Well, Draco wasn't.
. I didn't
-“Ron..”- Harry hugged him tightly and Ron hugged him back.
He had noticed how uncomfortable Draco seemed whenever someone was close to him. He would only let certain people touch him, and it was always asked before done.
-"So, this is the famous Draco I keep hearing about."- Sirius greeted mischievously, making Harry blush. Draco cleared his throat.
-“Harry?”- Draco called, bringing him back from his trance. Draco was wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt with ruffles at the front, a silky black ribbon tied in a pretty bow around the collar of his shirt, and black pants. Most importantly, his hair was messy.
-“What are you..”-
But the feeling Draco gave him was neither scary nor dangerous.
-"Yeah, 'cause Gryffindork is so unique."- Draco rolled his eyes.
-"They are."-
-"Just go to breakfast. You said you were starving. I'll be there in a minute."- Draco told them, hoping that Blaise would simply shut up. He was going to murder him if he didn't.
-“I’ll help you…forget the nightmare.”- Draco told him softly.
for a moment before we go, Lovegood?"- Draco asked politely as ever. Luna smiled.
-“You happened.”- Draco blurted out before even thinking about it. Draco gasped and hid his face in his hands.
-"Death eater scum, get away from Harry!"- the Ravenclaw student shook with anger.
But neither of them could deny what they were feeling.
Everything was dark, asides from the corporeal patronus of a doe that lit up the room, moving around the piano in which Draco was playing.
-"What? It's the truth!" Harry defended stubbornly.
Darkness engulfed him, but he would never forget Harry’s face.
He told Draco about how shocked and in awe he felt the first time he saw the castle in the distance.
Nott pulled away from Draco and walked out of the door, ignoring Blaise.
His grip tightened a bit when he found it, but it was still a gentle touch. It made Harry dizzy. Uncomfortably dizzy.
-“I’ll finish it tomorrow.”- He muttered softly and then turned to Harry,
-"You are not and you will never be what you once were."- Harry said fiercely.
-“Five stirs clockwise, five counterclockwise, five minutes brewing in high heat, five minutes resting, and two teaspoons of honey.”- She told him.
Realising that he was spacing out, Draco quickly grabbed his things and walked out of the hospital. The sun was setting and Draco was surprised about how much time he had been unconscious.
-“Draco! Draco! This is all my fault. I wanted to protect you I...-Hermione! He needs something. Now.”- Hermione and Ron were by his side a second later.
-“You..uh..you sing well.”- Harry said, a bit flustered. Draco stayed quiet for a bit.
-"Fine, I'll go home."- Draco agreed.
Harry was panicking.
Draco stopped and then turned to face Harry and the latter didn't fail to notice the blush that covered Draco's cheeks. It was evident even in the dark because it contrasted with Draco's pale skin.
anything.
Harry hid his face on his hands and groaned.
-“You’re Harry’s friend, are you not?”- Hermione said with a shrug.
Draco stared at it in confusion.
-"Wow."- Harry breathed.
The night before Draco's arrival, Harry took the Marauder's Map and the Invisibility Cloak and went through one of the secret passageways that led to Honeydukes.
When Draco found himself in a hospital bed, he knew immediately what had happened. He also understood something when he
This year, McGonagall was giving the class. She wanted to teach the students how to defeat Boggarts, but she gave them the benefit of volunteering because of everything that had happened.
Food felt like an enemy to him.
-"For what it's worth, I think you'll make a great mind healer."-
Draco tried to glance at his direction and Harry wanted to face-palm himself for not noticing before.
-"You can stop this now, Harry. Go back to sleep."- Draco said tiredly before walking away. But Harry wasn't taking none of it, so he quickly grabbed Draco's arm and spun him around so that Draco was now facing him.
been a good idea.
-"Course I will."-  He said confidently.
-“Alright?”- Harry asked breathlessly.
-“It’s f-fine. The panic attacks have become less frequently lately.”- Draco said, shrugging.
Harry felt that tingly sensation all over again and drowned in it for as long as it lasted.
Draco still dressed fashionably, if he could say so himself. But he was way less stiff than before and didn't use gel on his hair anymore. Instead, wore it in a "styled" mess. He really didn't took time to do it anymore, but it was always somewhat decent.
-“Mine activates whenever I feel impotent and scared.”- Draco revealed in a whisper,
-"It's just...you're spending a lot of time with him."- Ron shrugged, and then more carefully,
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were just as chaotic, but they were less chaotic together.
He was Malfoy to Harry.
He also saw other students hexing him, and he thought that Draco would defend himself or at least tell a professor, but Draco did nothing of the sort. He kept quiet and moved on with his day, much to Harry's irritation.
What Harry didn’t know was that Draco’s family had threatened him to hurt Harry if he didn’t follow the rules.
-“Is everyone alright?”- Harry yelled. Hermione was hugging Ron.
-"Since the beginning of the year."- Draco admitted. Harry squeezed his hand and guided Draco inside of the common room.
-“He’s fine. That’s all I needed to know. He has something going on with that Diggory boy anyways. He won’t want to see me here. Let’s go.”- Draco spat with venom while Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor hugged him.
He could
-"You sure you're okay, mate?"- Ron asked, weirded out by Harry's sudden interest in school.
."- Harry retorted. Draco rolled his eyes.
-"You are an Empath. You can feel people's emotions as your own. When Harry told me about it, I knew I had read something about that. Nowadays, they are rarer than Metaphormagi so it's quite stunning that you have this ability."- Hermione explained with wonder.
What could’ve possibly happened to kill that spark he used to have in his eyes?
And Harry kissed him again, and again, and again, making Draco fall for him all over.
. He thought.
-"Huh"- Harry hummed in confusion.
Professor Lupin had intervened and taken the boggart by himself.
. Draco thought.
-“Let’s go.”-
-"I...um, could I speak with Potter
-“Why are you doing this?”- Harry asked suspiciously. Draco shrugged.
But it wasn’t the full truth either.
At exactly 8:00am, Draco came into the room, walking as quietly and carefully as possible. Harry noticed that something was different about him but he just couldn't figure out what it was.
The way Harry saw it, he was an spectator of his own life.
-"It was more of...a personal project."-
On one hand, he hated having people beside him but on the other hand, this was Harry.
-"Care to elaborate?"- Draco sighed.
-"Alright, alright! No need to get defensive. M'lady."- Blaise extended his arm to Pansy and Pansy grabbed it gracefully, both of them walking towards the Great Hall.
-"Oh, it's nothing. I just..I told Pansy and Blaise to go without me to the Great Hall. I could go by myself, but if Headmistress McGonagall sees me, I'll never hear the end of it."- Draco groaned.
'. Are you two going out yet?"-
A crack appeared on his other self's face.
So one day, he followed Harry.
-"Make it stop."- he murmured. Harry pulled Draco closer to him but didn't hug him.
-"Bitch, what are you? 50? You need dick."- Pansy said, sipping her firewhiskey.
Draco was part of the cow’s Inquisitorial Squad and Harry could NOT believe it.
So after their second week, Draco had given up, allowing Harry to follow him like a guardian pup.
Draco frowned.
-"Malfoy."- Harry called. Draco broke out of his trance and suddenly realised what he was just about to do.
They were in their Defence Against the Dark Arts class when professor Lupin told them that they would be learning how to fight off boggarts.
-"Death eater scum."- The Ravenclaw that had casted the jinx muttered angrily. To everyone's surprise though, Draco muttered back an apology and Harry decided that he had had enough.
-"I was going to, but some dimwitted gryffindork with a saviour complex decided to show up."-
-“Potter, what are you doing here?”- Poppy Pomfrey asked.
-"I thought you might like it since you're a Gryffindor. Lucius opposed, obviously, but don't you mind him. And you can redecorate if you wish."- Narcissa told him softly. Harry couldn't stop staring at the beautiful room. It was big but it seemed cozy. It was dark and cold, but somehow he felt warm. He turned to Narcissa smiling genuinely.
Granted, it came with the underlying fact that nothing felt real. His body didn't felt like his own, his life didn't felt like it belonged to him.
Draco fell to his knees.
-"I don't know. I just feel like a lot of people expect me to be an Auror or a Curse Breaker or something."- Harry said.
-"I thought you
-"Thank you for listening."- Harry said. He realised that Draco would act awkward whenever Harry thanked him and Harry liked that.
He didn’t imagine it, did he?
Smiling against Harry's neck and with a full heart, Draco told him,
-“Draco…”- Blaise said softly. Draco opened his eyes in horror. A few people were staring at him, but for the most part, everyone was busy eating or talking.
. He thought.
-"Mr. Malfoy, I need to speak with you alone after your classes. For now, Miss Lovegood will escort you to your classes and for your well-being, don't go off wandering alone. At least for now. I know you're very capable, and that it will be frustrating for you but just hang in there until professor Lupin and I sort this out. We shall make an announcement and...-anyways, you all have class. Off you go."- Minerva said and walked away, muttering something that no one could hear.
Harry pushed him jokingly and Draco chuckled.
Draco's eyes opened abruptly and realised that he was the one screaming. He sighed in relief and rose up from his bed.
-“Alright, love?”- Blaise asked Draco, handing him some pumpkin juice.
-"Alright Harry? We can come with you."- Ron said with his mouth full. Harry laughed and shook his head.
-"What?"- Harry asked in disbelief.
He was now in pyjamas that were a bit too big for him and he was watching the ocean through the window.
He didn’t fail to hear Parkinson’s whisper:
He liked Draco Malfoy.
-“But what if someone catches you?”- Draco asked concerned. Harry smirked.
-"Are we in a session, Mind Healer Malfoy?"- Harry asked amusedly. A pink tint graced Draco's cheeks.
Draco barely mumbled something and the papers that Harry had went flying directly into Malfoy's hands.
Everything he did, he did it soft.
-“Un plus un font deux
-“What’s that, Draco? Scared of your auntie?”- some slytherin shouted, earning cruel laughs from other students.
-“Scourgify.”- Draco whispered. The blood was instantly gone. Harry observed how Draco took out bandages from his bag.
-“Did something happened?”- Harry asked carefully.
-"What do you mean?"- Harry asked.
Just then, Harry emerged from the water. Draco let out an audible sigh of relief.
Harry sat beside him. Draco tried to wipe his tears away and sniffled a couple times, but when Harry hugged him, he broke down again, gripping Harry's cloak tightly and pulling himself closer to Harry. Harry held Draco tightly, whispering soothing words until Draco calmed down.
-"He's been double-shifting every day since your little fight."- Blaise told him. Pansy sipped her butterbeer.
-“What’s happening to him?”- Harry asked out loud.
Dobby appeared, throwing a chandelier to the floor.
Draco?
And another.
-"I will. Thank you."-
-"He's in our room. Come on, I'll take you there."- Blaise said and took Harry to the room he shared with Draco.
-“He will. I know he will.”- Draco said determined.
He took his hand to his mouth and gasped again. Harry hugged him tightly and Draco broke down.
-"W-What about your friends?"- Draco asked.
He wouldn't lose.
-“Yes, it’s me.”-
Draco sighed in relief, plopping onto the nearest desk.
-"Alright then. I'll see you next Saturday."- Harry stood up,
-“I like you.”- Harry said firmly. Draco smiled and kissed him softly.
After dinner, Ron came up to him and sat on his bed.
He ran until he reached the Great Lake.
After Zabini had finally told him that Draco had had a surgery and that he needed time to heal, Harry was restless. He was in a horrible mood and he was always on edge.
Harry realised that Draco had scars too and, unable to contain himself, he traced them gently.
-"I swear I'm never telling you both anything again. He's still my patient!"-
-"Draco, what's going on?"- Harry asked concerned.
Draco gasped because was this really happening?
There were no thanks, no bidding good night, no instant friendships formed. Actually, there had been no words after that.
In Harry’s arms.
Harry realised that:
-“Hi, may I?”- Harry asked, gesturing the seat next to Draco’s.
-"Blaise, don't you.."-
-“What did you do to him?”- Ron asked, pointing at Draco with his finger.
-"Come on! Don't be a stiff."- He told him and pulled him to the dance floor anyways.
He didn't bother in checking the time, but he knew it was way too early for him to be dealing with this.
-“You’re avoiding me.”- Draco stated, sitting beside Harry.
Pansy spat her drink and coughed.
Harry had had enough and had told Draco that if he was going to be mean, he wasn't interested in his friendship.
-"You know how muggles have auras? Well, we have magical barriers surrounding us. Every wizard's and witch's magic has a specific colour, most of the times said colour being the same as the light your wand gives off whenever you cast a spell. Granger's magic is a royal purple while yours is emerald green."- Draco explained.
And Harry was Potter to him.
-"Let's just go."- Draco said unusually quiet. Harry stared at him, then back at the student, and then back at Draco before nodding once.
What if Harry thought he was weird?
-"Prat."-
-"Draco, I love you but you're full of shit. You like Potter, he obviously likes you back. You're both stressed. Woman up and cut the sexual tension."- Pansy told him.
Lucius arrived that same day.
He had been so oblivious.
And Harry didn't like that one bit.
-"I wouldn't miss it."- Draco smiled fondly.
When Draco stood up to leave, Harry told him:
Before he could help himself, he was shouting,
-"Draco, look at me."- Draco did as told, his hands leaving the piano,
-“What’s wrong?”- Draco asked.
-“Were you...waiting for me?”- He asked tentatively. Draco scoffed offendedly, but Harry didn’t fail to notice the blush that crept onto the blonde’s cheeks.
Silver, purple, and red sparkles floated through the cubicle, but they were harmless.
Harry wanted to say something, but bit his lip to keep his mouth shut and started picking up Malfoy's things in silence instead.
-"I was just walking around."- Harry said with a shrug.
-"Hi Harry."- Draco said softly. Harry sat beside him. -"Nightmare?"- He asked. Harry nodded wordlessly. Draco nodded his head in understanding and did something quite unexpected: He drew himself closer to Harry and put an arm around Harry's shoulders. Harry automatically leaned in, resting his head in Draco's chest and thoroughly enjoying the contact and warmth. It wasn't often that people touched him in that way, caring and affectionately. Draco's touch was light and gentle, yet firm.
Ron stared at his best friend suspiciously.
Hermione shot him a nervous glance but said nothing.
Draco could distinguish that hair anywhere: Harry Potter was covered in blood.
-“Look, if you like him back, we won’t stop you. But if you don’t, simply tell him. He’s a big boy, he can handle it, but don’t play with him. His birthday is in three days and we’re having a small celebration in his room. Think about it.”- Blaise said and walked away.
-"Of course, thank you for coming."- Harry told him.
Draco grabbed his arms and pulled him against him, so that Harry was laying on top of him.
Draco’s mind could only think about Harry back and forth, back and forth, back and forth as they kissed.
He looked youthful, but at the same time grown up. Harry had definitely seen him before at Hogwarts, but never really talked to him.
-"So, what's the real story? Mummy and daddy didn't like you and gave you away? Or is it actually true that the Dark Lord killed them both?"- Draco pressed. Harry gasped in horror and then shook with contained anger.
Draco blushed.
You better cool it off before you burn it out
Harry was getting dangerously close and Draco couldn't think properly. He was feeling too much. Both, Harry's emotions and his own.
-"Riddikulus."- the boggart started disappearing.
-"You're right. Go straight to your room and you won't have any food until you remember your manners and reconsider about your behaviour."- Lucius commanded firmly.
-"Um..no, thank you. I'm here with my friends, actually. I just wanted to say hi."- Harry explained a bit embarrassed.
-"Are you absolutely sure about this?"- McGonagall asked. Draco nodded firmly. Despite his heart beating loudly and quickly, he knew perfectly well what his boggart would be.
It was horrible.
-"I'm so sorry."- He whispered back, glancing with evident concern at his friend. Draco limited himself to shake his head in sign of dismissal and turned to Harry.
Draco stood up and walked towards the locked wardrobe.
-“You are the best of our class in Potions, and there’s this part I really don’t understand. Could you help me?”-
Draco took his chance and hexed the werewolves and smugglers that were restraining Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
But although it was decreasing with each day that passed by, Harry had only really felt it three days ago when he accidentally greeted Draco, much to the blonde's dismay.
Draco thought.
But he couldn’t feel it.
Que je lui refusai
-“How did you even know!? I didn’t even know!”-
He opened the door and Rivers greeted him.
-"Well, he wouldn't be if
-“The what?”- Harry asked dreamily.
-"Thank you."-
-"But he's hurting himself! What do you even mean?"- Harry asked.
-“I saw them move! Nice touch by the way, how’d you do it?”- Hermione asked excitedly.
-"You can rest now, Draco."- that was the last thing he heard Harry said before falling asleep.
-"You're not Draco. You know you're not, so for once don't be a stubborn prat and tell me what's wrong."- Harry told him. Draco stared at him and sighed.
-“You…won’t tell anyone about…-about what you saw today, right?”- Harry shook his head and Draco nodded in relief.
Draco would never tell him to leave, or flip him off, or be rude, but he wouldn't talk to Harry unless it was absolutely necessary. He always kept his guard up, Harry assumed.
He loved treacle tarts.
Everyone gasped and Draco blushed before nodding once. Harry kissed him again, slower this time and pulled away when he heard Zabini suddenly exclaim:
Maybe he still had a chance with him.
-“How do you control it?”- he asked.
responsible for him."-
-"It's not really as bad as you think."- Ron told him with a knowing smile. Draco looked at Ron in confusion but said nothing.
-“What’s the fer..-I mean Malfoy doing here?”- Ron asked.
The problem was that something had changed in Draco. He was meaner, always sticking up to those bloody stupid pureblood ideals.
-“How dare you! You know nothing!”- Draco spat.
No one could fully understand what he was going through and all the emotional distress was finally catching up with him all at once.
Draco, not knowing what to do, answered stiffly:
-"What the fuck am I supposed to do now?"- Harry muttered. He was panicking.
-“I thought I saw Granger coming in here but when I entered it was empty.”- Draco lied smoothly, face masked with indifference.
-"Thank you."- Harry repeated. Draco waved his hand in sign of dismissal.
-"Anytime."- He said with difficulty. He stared at Draco until the latter one let out a little noise,
He seemed thinner, taller, and paler.
-"C'mere."- Blaise told him. Draco followed his voice and Blaise started adjusting his tie for him.
-“How are you feeling?”- Harry asked once Madame Pomfrey was gone, sitting beside him.
-"We're friends now?"- He asked incredulously .
-"Fair enough."- Draco said.
-"Make what stop, Draco?"- Harry asked, frantically. He didn't knew what to do and he couldn't see Blaise or Pansy. Draco sobbed harder and Harry couldn't help pulling him into a hug.
And he would never forgive himself for hurting him.
-"Wicked! Is it your first year at Hogwarts too?"-
-"Draco darling, that's not.."-
Draco hadn’t wasted his chance and had tried very hard to redeem himself.
-“Because no one else is doing it and I can.”-
-“I’m sorry. For hurting you and your friends. I am disgusted with what I did and I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to redeem myself. I know it’s not much but..”-
-"Ridikkulus."- Draco casted unfazed. On the other hand, Harry, Ron, and Hermione felt sick. While another crack appeared in the arm where the Dark Mark was, all that Harry could think of was what exactly had happened to Draco.
He had simply...let them hex him.
What the hell was going on with him?
-"Okay then."-
-"Well, Merlin help me if you had actually treated me like you treat
-"I can show you how to do it in your room, if you'd like."- Draco said quietly behind him, startling Harry a bit. Harry nodded and handed him the tray. Draco raised a brow but took the tray nevertheless. Harry shrugged in response.
He wasn’t sleeping all that much.
And that scared them both.
Draco realised that he was bound to lose three movements ago.
She was the only one who listened.
He felt like himself.
Draco opened the door but Harry wasn't alone.
Draco felt it immediately.
They returned to Hogwarts unnoticed and got on with their day.
-“I already knew.”- Blaise stated flatly.
It was useless to cry over what had been done.
He looked at the mirror one more time, the ghost of his past staring at him with wide eyes.
-"Hello Potter."- He forced himself to say,
-"Why won't I sit at the Gryffindor table with you? Gee, I wonder."- Draco said sarcastically.
-"Do you have any plans today?"- Harry found himself asking one day after a session.
-"Right."- Draco grabbed what was left of Blaise's drink and took a sip.
For a moment, Harry thought Draco hadn't heard him, but seconds later Draco opened the door. He eyed curiously at the tray Harry was carrying and let him in. Harry observed Draco's room. His wallpaper was a faded posh, patterned-green (much like his own) with silver details all around the room. The cealing had been enchanted so that Draco had a magnificent view of a galaxy.
-"People will talk, Potter. Think about it carefully. You know what? Just call Lovegood and.."-
Harry tossed and turned in his bed, but the sleep didn't come. Resigned to the fact that he wouldn't be getting any sleep, he grabbed the Marauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak, and exited the room he shared with his fellow Gryffindors quietly.
He was so busy goofing around Hogsmeade that he forgot about Draco.
-"Look, I don't like Malfoy. He's a bloody git and we all know that. But I also don't think that on top of losing his sight, he has to bear with the comments."- Harry said.
He shook his head and started walking.
-“He can’t defend himself, you know?”- Luna said from behind, making Harry jump.
Harry nodded and they didn’t spoke anymore after that, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes in the book.
-“Brilliant! Thank you, Draco!”- Hermione said when they were done, unconsciously touching Draco’s hand. Draco froze.
Toi, tu me tires assis, les larmes ou la pluie
-"Because if you're not, you're gonna need it. Potter is coming right this way."- Blaise announced in between laughs.
-"I'll consider it."- Harry said.
nothing of what he had felt before: all the physical pain and exhaustion he felt came from Harry.
-“Are you sure? I know that you uh..that you don’t like..well, touching people.”- Harry admitted, but much to his surprise, Draco simply shrugged.
Harry couldn’t handle it.
-"As I was saying, you will pay for our trip and you will not contact Draco by any means, or I'll make sure as hell that the only light you see is the one after the Dementors kiss you."- Harry threatened.
. He turned to face Harry.
Ever since Sirius' death, he felt like there was something broken inside of him. Something that he didn't thought it could be repaired. Until he started his sessions with Draco, that is.
-“H-harry?”- he called softly. Harry held him hand tightly.
-"I might have said some things to Father in my last letter."- Draco admitted, hiding his face in Harry's neck. Harry hummed in response. He knew that Draco said more than just '
-"Potter."-
He tensed, but didn't retreat.
What’s Potter doing here? Did you know,
Draco shook his head.
-"W-what? How..? Why did I not know about this?"- Harry asked rather frantically.
It was weird to see Draco like this.
-"I have a mark and a lot of people that would suggest otherwise."- Draco was starting to feel it again. The need to jump out of the Astronomy Tower.
-"Draco? What's wrong?"- Harry asked, genuinely confused. He thought that apologising for kissing Draco would be enough.
."- Hermione explained very quietly.
-“Harry, show me your wrists.”- Draco commanded. Harry shook his head and sniffed,
He told Draco about that insufferable blonde with gelled hair and stiff ideals, and how even though Harry disliked him, he couldn't help but feel happy about everything else.
-“Huh?”-
. It will be fine,
-"More than I should."- Draco told him,
? Is he Harry Potter?"- Bellatrix asked, yanking Draco by his hair.
-“Why would you do that!? That death eater deserves that and more!”- The Ravenclaw said, earning a punch on the nose from Ron.
It was barely there, but it was something.
-“You know, golden trio with ex-death eater.”- He said gesturing at Harry and then at himself with his hands.
He couldn’t comprehend what was going on in his own body but it felt good. Draco made him feel good.
Everyone's emotions were too much for him to deal with all at once. They all felt blurry and it made Draco dizzy.
-"I'm Harry. Harry Potter."-
So Harry told him about his first year at Hogwarts.
He pushed his feelings aside.
-"I'm gonna murder them both in their sleep."- Draco mumbled. Harry sat in Blaise's place.
-"Well,
-“Or that could happen. I think we ought to intervene now, don’t you agree?”- Luna suggested.
Draco had so many questions for Sirius.
-"So, what do you want to be?"- Harry asked. Draco shook his head.
Not knowing what to do and not wanting to seem rude, Draco nodded. Harry smiled widely and sat beside him.
here has helped me with my classes."- He felt Draco suqeezing his hand, he squeezed back. Lucius hummed.
-“I always thought that you ripping my shirt off would involve a romantic scene.”-
-“Just like your parents are.”-
-"Am I ruining your plans?"- Harry teased. Draco hummed.
-“Of course it is!”- Harry said fiercely and then softer,
Draco closed his eyes.
-"He needs you."- He said and kept walking. Harry gulped nervously and opened the door to reveal Draco crying. He had first met Draco in January. It was now October and he had never seen Draco cry. Draco usually wore a bored face, but here he was, crying in his bed and hugging his pillow.
-“I just needed a moment.”- He shrugged. Harry stopped petting the thestral and stared at Draco instead.
Ron snorted as he sipped his pumpkin juice.
thought you
-“So are you!”- Harry argued with a laugh.
Harry, unable to avoid Draco any longer, grabbed his map and cloak one night and went after Draco.
"- A big crack was heard and the boggart disappeared.
The next morning, after making sure that he was alone in the room, he took out Sirius' mirror.
people's emotions, allowing him to make deeper connections with them and making his treatments more successful. And Harry Bloody Potter was in a hella ton of pain.
Draco eyed him curiously.
-“Alright Mr. Malfoy, you’re up.”- Professor Lupin told him warmly. Draco stared at him with disdain but shrugged, standing in front of the boggart.
-“I can’t. I guess I just haven’t been angry since I..”- Harry stopped himself, cheeks blushing.
Harry's brain short-circuited.
-"I-I'm sorry. I..I was curious. Pardon me if I made you uncomfortable."- Draco told him. Harry was trying so hard to stifle his laughter but he couldn't hold it any longer. He laughed big and brightly and Draco
Surely Harry wouldn’t hurt him, right? He had spoken to his favour at his trial.
He cried so much that he had woken up Blaise, who hadn’t asked any question and had simply held him in his tiny arms until Draco had fallen asleep.
Neither of them had spoken about what had happened, but found themselves meeting the next night. And the next.
-"I see."- Draco said, turning around to leave.
-"Would that be so fucking bad!?"- Harry exploded. Ron stared at him for a long time. Or perhaps it was only for a few minutes. Harry couldn't focus. His head was spinning.
His worries faded away when Harry kissed him again. Slowly this time.
Draco felt it too and smiled wider.
-"We heard you the first ten times, mate."- Ron groaned.
Every now and then, Harry would end up in Draco's bed.
Draco snorted.
-"Are you even eating?"- Harry blurted before he could stop himself. Draco's reaction told Harry that he wasn't.
-"Thank you for the information, Ms. Granger."- He said politely and nodded gracefully.
Harry walked into St. Mungo's because he had an appointment with a Mind Healer. No one told him, however, that his Mind Healer would be Draco Malfoy.
He didn’t know how it happened.
-"Aren't you supposed to be at Beauxbatons?"- Draco asked, but relaxed in Harry's arms. Harry kissed his neck, earning a groan from Draco.
-"You don't have to."-
-"Done what?"-
-“I’m fine, Harry.”- Draco giggled and then frowned as if he had remembered something,
Two slashes.
-“It’s getting late, we need to get going.”- Draco nodded and took the hand.
-"Potter's staring at you, right?"- Pansy asked, giving a quick glance to the Gryffindor table. Indeed, Potter was staring at him, trying to be subtle but failing miserably.
Draco, Harry had noticed, was barely eating.
It irritated Draco. He just wanted to lay low, finish his studies, and move to France.
He shrugged it off and walked Malfoy to the Great Hall. As Draco predicted, their entrance made quite a turmoil. Harry swallowed his embarrassment and guided Draco to the Slytherin table. Parkinson and Zabini received them, sharing identical looks on their faces that Harry couldn't figure out.
the pain of everyone who lost a loved one in the Wizarding War.
. He thought.
Draco pulled away first.
With the little consciousness Draco had left, he managed to open his eyes just enough to see Harry's beautiful green ones.
-“I?”-
Did Harry actually like him?
-"If you want me to."- Harry nodded eagerly, extending his hand.
-"So you're married to your job, then?"- Harry chose to ask instead. Draco nodded, eyes brightening up.
-"I'm finally able to study magic without having Voldemort breathing in my neck or reading my mind. I'm grateful."- He focused back on his task, much to his friends shock.
-"Please, sit down so that we can start."- Draco told him. He himself needed to sit down. He felt suddenly drained and out of energy. Like there was nothing to keep him going.
Draco let out a shaky breath.
-"I should go, before curfew begins."- Draco told them.
Harry looked at his friends helplessly. Hermione was looking anywhere but at him and Ron just gave him a confused look.
He shook his head.
-“Who’s there?”- Harry took off his invisibility cloak and smiled shyly at him. Draco visibly relaxed and proceeded to sit back again at the edge.
It was a beautiful day. Draco inhaled and sighed happily. The sun was still rising and his flowers were awakening.
The trio stood up.
-"Aren't you gonna eat, Harry?"- Ron asked somewhat concerned, his chicken breast forgotten for a moment.
-“A french lullaby, but I changed a word.”- Draco answered softly.
And then, there were the panic attacks.
-“Draco!”-
Draco smiled weakly.
-“Knight to C6. Check.”-
After what seemed an eternity to Harry, Draco smiled big and wide, and nodded.
."- Sirius said.
-“S-sing me a song?”- Harry requested. Draco nodded.
They stayed in that position until Harry pulled away.
McGonagall nodded and opened the wardrobe. Another version of him appeared before his eyes, only this version had both arms untouched, the Dark Mark still there.
-"I'm sorry."- Harry started. Draco kept quiet,
-"Do what's right, love."-
.”- the boggart told him getting dangerously close. Draco gulped.
Afterwards, Draco focused on whatever rubbish Parkinson was talking about and didn't look in Harry's way again.
-"Oh, I couldn't help myself! It's just...he's so infuriating and Mother does nothing about it. I mean, she tries but she's scared of him. I don't even know how you got into this fucked up family in the first place."- Draco told him.
Why was he dizzy?
At first, the Slytherins were skeptical, but seeing Draco smiling softly, clapping repeatedly, and even giggling whenever he won against Harry in Wizarding Chess eased the Slytherins. Most of them anyways.
Draco’s cold hands gently cupped Harry’s hot cheeks and shook his head.
-“I..d-deserved it.”- Draco said, spitting blood with each word.
-“Breakfast is ready.”-
-“T-thank you.”- Draco whispered, once he trusted his voice enough to not fail him.
He whimpered.
Draco couldn't quite pinpoint what emotion it was exactly, but he knew that he wanted Harry to feel this way more often.
-"Out, I guess."-
-"How so?"-
-"Master Harry Potter! What is you needing, sir?"- The elf asked happily. Harry sighed.
-"What do you mean?"- Harry asked confusedly. At that very moment, as if by divine revelation, they heard it. A tripping jinx and someone falling.
As soon as Hermione left the door, Draco's face darkened.
Finally, Draco nodded.
Harry stood up at the speed of light and raised his hands in surrender.
-“Touch my son one more time and you won’t live to see another day.”-
-"Yeah."- Harry said, beside Malfoy. Malfoy nodded and casted a Muffliato.
One last chance.
Harry was running late to class and Draco was just...standing there. He seemed like he was daydreaming and dazed, lost in his own world. A lot like Luna, if Harry could say so himself.
Draco felt weird.
-“Couldn’t
-"I have, thanks for asking. So, what brings you here?"- Draco asked, and so the session began.
-"Take a break. You need it."- Harry told him. Draco stood there, just appreciating Harry's emotions for a bit.
-“Cissy!”- Bellatrix gasped offended.
-"What's the deal with them?"- he asked Hermione once they had finished their breakfast and were walking to their respective class.
Covering his ears, Draco stood up before realising what he was doing.
-“Draco! Oh my god, Draco I’m sorry!”- Harry cried, holding Draco tightly.
He was also disgusted with himself for not pressing on the issue and just assuming that Draco was corrupted.
Sure enough, Draco felt a sudden rush of giddiness that didn't came neither from him nor his friends.
-"Fine. Have it your way, then."- He said, walking towards Narcissa. Draco stared in shock and then turned to Harry, who whispered an echantment with his wand in hand and turned Draco's hair back to normal. Draco thanked him quietly and they both made their way to the ballroom, where everyone was waiting.
Now, Draco had spoken with professor Lupin before and he was very nice. When Harry had told Lupin about their relationship, Lupin had smiled and said:
-“Harry, you can see ‘im now.”- Fleur said as she entered the room.
He didn’t wait to see Harry’s reaction.
-"What about him?"-
-"W-what happened?"- Draco asked, concerned.
-"I guess he wasn't, and nobody mentioned it back then."- Harry sank. Malfoy had lost his sight to help him.
-“And this won’t affect your sleeping schedule?”-
After that, Harry and Draco saw each other secretly at night at least twice a week.
Sliding into the nearest carriage, he found Luna and Draco talking quietly.
That certainly didn't came from him.
-“Nope. That’s it. I’ll finish it tomorrow.”- Ron said, grabbing his things and standing up.
Draco had a bruise forming on his left eye.
It took Harry more than he expected for Draco to finally open up a bit towards him.
He took off the hood so that Ron could only see a floating head.
-"So, Lucius. You have a choice. You let me and Draco go to France immediately after we graduate and you simply have a sentence in Azkaban that Minister Kingsley will arrange along with the Wizengamot or we can have the Dementors kiss you."- Harry proposed.
He was only teasing Harry when he said those things about Ron. Deep inside, Draco knew that Ron was a good wizard and that he had the heart of a lion.
-"He was a bit mad for a few hours, but Ron understands. He said that he loved us both and that if it wasn't working, it simply wasn't. He said we both deserved to be happy."- Harry smiled fondly.
His thoughts were interrupted by Harry’s head on his lap. Draco gently caressed Harry’s hair.
-"D-draco!"-
-“No one can as long as he’s still alive.”- Draco said somewhat shakily.
-"You can do whatever you want. Whatever makes you happy."- Draco told him earnestly.
-"Come on, can't I greet a friend?"- Harry asked. Draco snorted.
The trio was making their way to DADA and both, Ron and Hermione, had asked Harry about the whole Draco situation that had happened the day before.
Their arms didn’t brush together like his arms did Ron and Hermione, neither did their legs (Harry assumed).
-“You’re anything but straight.”-
But it was there.
, they thought; and Draco couldn't agree more, but for an entirely different reason.
-"Very much so. I had this whole death thing planned in my head but now here I am, listening to lame stories from you."- Harry laughed.
-"Pity, I love dancing."- Harry sighed with fake disappointment and a smirk on his face. Draco glared at him as well and Harry laughed, raising his hands in surrender.
Harry knew?
Poppy Pomfrey closed the curtain with a smile on her lips.
-"Holidays will be hard for Draco from now on, Potter. Specially Christmas. Have you tried searching in the Shrieking Shack though?"- Harry basically ran to the Shrieking Shack and found Draco inside.
-“You’re not trying to protect him again, are you? Because you know what Bellatrix will do to you if you betray us.”- Nott threatened, grabbing Draco’s hair and forcing him closer to him.
He handed Ron his bag of sweets and ran towards the hospital wing.
But his short-lived happiness was shattered when he heard a very familiar voice,
Harry wanted to scream. At Hogwarts, Draco acted as if he didn't know the boy. It was the obvious choice, since Harry was in Gryffindor and Draco in Slytherin, but Harry
Narcissa had smiled at him and Lucius had nodded gracefully. They Apparated at the Malfoy Manor, where the press awaited.
..."- He gestured vaguely with his hands,
There, he bought Draco's favourite treats and quickly returned to Hogwarts.
-“D-draco!”-
Draco's heart was beating loudly because when the
Draco moaned and melted at Harry’s touch, wanting him closer. He pulled Harry on top of him and let the Golden Boy dominate the kiss.
So many hours in a day..”- Draco drifted off to sleep.
He fucking
Draco was asking for help.
-“I…I don’t know, okay?”- Harry said desperately, feeling the heat rising to his cheeks.
-"Oh, you bet I'm gonna. It's all about the D, Draco."- Blaise smirked and winked at him before following Pansy.
They quietly made their way into the Slytherin table, apparently not wanting to draw any more attention.
It was scary, but self-preservation had never been Harry's strongest feature.
-"I think you'll make a great teacher."- Draco commented out loud. He hadn't meant to, but he couldn't back down now.
His father was in Azkaban, his mother had died.
?"- He said, ever so quietly. Harry sat down on his bed.
-“Try again and focus a bit more.”-
He heard the door opening and there, blurry because of his tears, stood Harry Potter. Of-fucking-course.
He had searched literally everywhere in the goddamned castle for Draco. But the boy was nowhere to be found.
Because if Draco and Harry could tolerate each other, anything good was possible.
be the one asking you that?"- Harry shot. Draco laughed, something Harry hadn't heard from him in quite some time.
It was weird because Draco always felt way
-"Like hell I'm leaving you like this."- Harry said.
-“What if they are true?”- Harry asked while staring at Draco in the Slytherin table.
-"What did the doctors said?"- Blaise asked quietly. Draco exhaled shakily. They didn't really talked about Draco's condition because Blaise knew how uncomfortable it made him. Still, watching his friend like this...he couldn't help but ask.
-“Kissing me.”- He kissed Harry’s neck and sucked in, earning a moan from Harry.
Then again, it might be a Gryffindor thing.
-"I don't think so."- Harry stepped forward and Draco stepped backwards. There was little to no room for Draco to move now, otherwise he would fall.
Did he liked boys?
-“Fleur incantatem, fleur incantatem, fleur..”- his sobs kept him from getting more flowers on his wrist. The Dark Mark was fully covered in them, but it was still there. It would always be there.
Harry huffed.
And now, here he was, about to meet Sirius.
-"Hi Draco. Parkinson, Zabini."- Harry greeted from behind Draco. Pansy nodded politely and Blaise waved happily.
-"I know."-
Why couldn’t he feel it?
-"So, how's everything with you and Ms. Weasley?"- Draco asked politely.
Draco shook his head and sighed.
-"Wouldn't want to ruin the perfect family image you so desperately want to portray, now would I?"- Draco hissed back.
to do double shifts.
-“This isn’t the thirties, Potter. You can go to his room. Fifth room on the left. He likes the number five a lot.”- Blaise told him and Harry nodded sheepishly, making his way to the stairs.
After having a nightmare including Sirius' death, Harry took his Invisibility Cloak and walked through the castle. He ended up in the Astronomy Tower, and found himself being pleasantly surprised when he saw Draco was there too.
Was that the feeling he felt whenever he was around him?
And then, Draco had found the diary. Something to pour his emotions on, and that’s how he had ended up unconscious in the Chamber of Secrets.
Draco Malfoy was a wonder to Harry. They had a gala in which the Malfoys introduced Harry as part of the family. Draco had tried very damn hard to comb Harry's hair (earning giggles from Harry) and even used enchantments but it was useless. Instead, Draco left his own hair uncombed much to his father's dismay.
-"That's stupid."- Harry told him.
It had been difficult at first, because Draco kept pushing him away, but Harry was more stubborn.
They had just finished decorating when Draco came in with wet hair and arms exposed. Harry’s mouth went dry.
The sun was barely rising when Draco headed out of the house. His co-workers wondered why Draco always arrived so early, specially considering the fact that he
Draco and Harry went separate ways.
-"It's a long story, but basically um...he's blind because he helped me during the war. And he was getting bullied in here, so I felt like it was my responsibility to help him."- Harry defended his actions.
When Harry saw Draco for the first time after three weeks at dinner, he wanted to cry. He wanted to take Draco away from Lucius and protect him from any harm. Draco had lost a lot of weight (and he was already thin). Draco could've glamoured it if he wanted to, of course, but he wanted his parents to know what they were doing to him, even if that meant showing Harry as well. Besides, the rest of his appearance was already heavily glamoured. It's not like he was about to let Harry see how bad he actually was.
-"C'mere."- Draco sighed when he noticed that Harry wasn't moving. Harry's body acted own his own accord, moving towards Draco and sitting beside him. Draco shifted positions so that he was able to hug Harry. This time, his head was resting against Harry's chest.
Because this was a battle that Draco had to face on his own.
Draco was shaking, and rocking himself back and forth, back and forth, back and forth while in fetal position. Harry sat beside him but didn’t touch him.
Excusing himself, he exited the Great Hall and went directly to the Astronomy Tower.
-"How do you know that?"- Draco asked, but kept his arm around Harry.
-"Draco, talk to me."-
-“Did you forget something?”- Harry asked. Draco stared at him and sighed in...relief?
Draco gasped when Harry came into the hospital. He was in the middle of a session when he felt a great amount of pain that left him breathless.
-"What's wrong?"- He asked. Harry handed him the book.
-"Could you talk with the Headmistress about the announcement? I know that
After successfully (barely) avoiding the possible death of some arseholes, Harry made it his mission to keep an eye on Draco, protecting him from hexes and jinxes of other students in a subtle way.
-“Go on, Granger. I can handle it.”- Draco whispered. Hermione closed her eyes and took the dagger out.
-“Your little crush is staring at you.”- Blaise muttered, hiding his mouth from Harry’s sight by fake-drinking from his goblet.
The thought of this not being the first time that Draco had been stabbed horrified him.
-“HE CAME!?”-
Harry’s sight went from Draco to Blaise and back to Draco.
The moonlight shinning against Draco, Harry realised, made him seem like a ghost.
Draco looked at him in confusion, but before he could ask anything, he felt something sharp making contact with his stomach the moment Dobby apparated them away.
-“HOW!? Wait, wait, wait, so you’re not mad?”- Harry asked, searching for his glasses that had fallen from his face when he freaked out.
-“Since I started looking out for you.”- Harry muttered embarrassedly, making Draco blush as well.
Yeah, Draco Malfoy visited muggle shops.
-"Will you take me if you go?"- Harry asked so quietly that Draco wasn't sure if he had imagined it.
-"Good luck with that."- said Harry with a teasing smile.
Why did he wanted to talk with Draco? He didn’t know. He just…wanted to.
-"How useless. Crucio!"- Bellatrix said in a bored tone. Draco fell to the ground, whimpering silently.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly followed the source of the sound and found a Ravenclaw hexing Draco and the blonde was not reacting. He only asked for help softly.
But with everyone who had touched him.
Harry quickly made himself comfortable but Draco was really fucking nervous.
-"Nope."-
Harry's head was spinning.
-"You really need to work on your insults, Potter."- Draco told him.
-"Well, I didn't knew we were friends and it's not something I just casually tell people. They'll probably think The Dark Lord gave me this ability or something completely bonkers."- Draco ranted.
Deep down Harry didn't want him to do it.
people's emotions. Whatever they were feeling, Draco felt.
-"Oh! Yes, of course. If you want or need to know anything else, don't hesitate to come to me, Draco."- Hermione told him.
-"Oh, thank Merlin."- He murmured and Rivers escorted him to where Harry was.
Draco was walking with Pansy and Blaise towards Ancient Runes.
-"Hey! You're paying for that!"- Pansy exclaimed.
"About time."
Draco stopped playing and looked up at Harry with tears in his eyes. Harry sat down beside him quietly.
-"Thought it might take a while, with the press and all. I bet it was just fantastic,
-“Slow down you crazy child
Suddenly, he remembered that he had brought the Marauder’s Map with him and quickly went to his room to retrieve it.
To his relief, Blaise chuckled and said,
-"Y-yes. I don't know much about it though."- Harry told him.
-“Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq...”- Draco whispered over and over again, trying to control his breathing.
-“Merlin! I..I-uh I’ll see you later.”- Harry said, scurrying away.
-"I agree. You really need to get laid. Have you seen yourself lately? You're overworking again."- Blaise said, gently carresing Draco's cheek.
) family.
-"Listen to me very carefully,
-“Oh, alright!”- Hermione said, standing up and walking over to Draco.
-"You do know that I don't hate you, right? Sure, you're irritable, and an arsehole, and an absolute pain.."-
-“W-what?”-
-"But, the bet.."-
T’oublierai.”- Draco sang in between his sobs. He missed his mother so much.
On the third night, Draco brought him a treacle tart and handed it to him without a word.
Harry also started going to the Slytherin rooms.
-"So yeah. No one but Blaise and Pansy know, so I'd appreciate if you could keep this to yourself."- Draco said. Harry nodded understandingly.
-“We became friends because of it, so I don’t mind. We are friends, right?”- Draco answered. Harry’s blushed intensified, earning a smirk from Draco.
Draco couldn’t afford it. It was too dangerous for Harry. He had to play his cards well.
-“I have nothing to hide. So get the fuck away from me.”- Draco said slowly and dangerously. Nott clicked his tongue.
This Draco was much more calm and gentle.
That however, didn't stop Harry from taking another firm step forward.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand.
Harry sighed.
-"Oh, thank Merlin."-
On the other side, Draco stared at his plate.
Draco kissed back just as angrily because whom the
-"Do you wanna talk about it?"- Harry shook his head and Draco nodded understandingly. Harry bit his lower lip and unexpectedly pecked Draco's lips.
-"Well, at least he'll notice you now. Come on, I'm starving! If you don't get up in the next five seconds, I'm calling Pansy."- That was enough to get Draco to rise from his bed.
-"Now, let me go."- he squirmed and Harry let go only to cup Draco’s face with his hands.
-"What is it, Draco?"- He asked. Draco broke the contact and the light vanished as quickly as it had come.
-"You're not a death eater."- Harry defended with a frown.
That was until he had testified for Draco.
Harry just held him tighter.
-"Alright, I have a patient to attend s-so.."-
-"I have work to do."-
Harry sighed tiredly and stood up.
He simply watched Harry through his pain.
But lately, Harry had noticed that there was something wrong with Draco.
Harry dropped his gaze and focused on his food.
-“But I trust you. If the rumours are true, then I don’t mind as long as you know what you’re doing.”- He continued. Hermione gasped.
-"If you say so. You still should eat a bit. We're not getting anything else 'til tomorrow."- Ron shrugged and ate his chicken.
It felt intimate...like a secret.
-"But..my friends.."-
Never in his years of being a Mind Healer had he ever felt this way. At most, he felt a sadness that made him incapable of double-shifting, but never something that physically hurt him.
-"No. I'm not really...good with relationships. Plus, there's not a lot of people who would willingly date an ex-death eater."- Draco said, shrugging.
But he was even more beautiful when he was himself.
Draco bit his lip considering his options.
Not with Draco, of course.
-"You said it yourself, sir. She's the brightest
-"Hey Gryffindork."-
That, he knew when had started.
-“You didn’t. I need to bring someone to help you, but you have to promise me that you’ll s-stay awake.
-"Harry."- Harry corrected. Draco smiled.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked together to breakfast.
“By Merlin! He’s so into Draco it’s painful!”-
-"I honestly have no idea. I mean, I guess I could've
-“What were you singing?”- Harry whispered, watching the moon.
-"Tell me something nice?"- Draco muttered softly after a while.
Harry shook his head in realisation.
-"I'm sure I don't know what you mean."-
They simply were two individuals that understood each other.
Draco was tempted but,
Up and down.
Nothing had changed between them after that night.
He was humming softly.
-“Good night then, Potter.”- Draco started walking but stopped and turned to Harry,
This time, Draco wasn’t moving at all.
Merlin, it was so good to have Harry all to himself again.
-"They basically treat mind and emotional illnesses using healing magic."- Draco elaborated.
Harry felt a sense of déjà vu at the familiar sight.
-“Alright mate?”- Ron asked. Harry nodded.
-“You came! Come sit, I made some pastries.”- Harry said with a grin, making Draco’s heart swell with affection.
-"Nope. Not falling for this one, Malfoy. You double-shift way too much and you need a break. Take a day off and.."-
Draco knew he had fucked up.
And probably a Dementor’s presence would’ve felt warmer than how he felt on the inside.
Draco visited Harry the next morning. The latter was eating breakfast.
-"I'm sorry."- Harry apologised automatically.
And when they had come back to Hogwarts, Draco was back at square one and Harry couldn’t understand why.
-“Harry.”- Draco breathed. Harry had invited him to have lunch outside with Ron and Hermione, the pair immersed in a game of Wizard’s Chess.
Draco focused in explaining and both, Harry and Hermione, listened attentively.
-“Oh, a lot of things happened, Potter. You better go to the hospital wing in this instant or I’ll..”- Harry didn’t wait for her to finish.
"- Sirius asked, raising an eyebrow in amusement. Harry stared at the mirror in confusion.
Draco kissed back, pouring all the emotions he couldn’t express out loud into the kiss.
-"Fantastic, I presume."- Blaise laughed, making Draco and Harry laugh as well. The three of them went to the nearest clear table and sat down, talking quietly for the rest of the night.
-“No, please. Just a little bit longer.”- Draco pleaded with his eyes closed.
And someone was trying to hush him.
-“You can’t possibly..”-
-"I have not!"- Draco defended.
-“Your hands..”- Harry spoke just as softly.
-"I'm guh-gonna..I'll just..-yeah."- She said quickly, pointing at the bar with her fingers. She stood up and stumbled towards it.
-"Am I what?"-
-"I know the perfect place."-
-"Rubbish!"-
He really did try to sleep but it was useless. Moreover, he was just desperately hoping that Draco was alright.
-"Potter. W-what are you doing in m-muggle London?"- Draco managed to ask.
They weren’t friends.
Harry sniffed and quickly wiped his tears away, but Draco sat down gently in front of him and took out his wand.
-“It’s settled then.”-
-“But I..”-
-“Listen to me, because I’ll only say this once. Get away from me, alright?”- He said, pushing Harry enough to make him fall. Harry’s jaw dropped.
Some gasped.
-"Please just use a silencing spell. You know what? Nevermind. I'm leaving for breakfast."-
-“Course you are.”- Ron said without taking his eyes from the chess board,
-“But at Hogwarts..”-
Back at home, people didn't usually talk to him.
He was the reason Dumbledore was dead.
Rivers levitated Harry to the ICU, set him on the nearest bed, and started examining him from head to toe as gently as he could.
-“Bloody hell! You’re right!”- He exclaimed and started running.
Draco gasped and shook his hand with the same enthusiasm.
After a month, Harry was eating somewhat normally again, but he was feeling on edge.
Draco smirked.
-“Specially at this age, when you’re growing and changing and your emotions are out of control, attracting the nargles.”-
Then another.
-"I think I want to become a teacher."- Harry revealed. They were both sitting down at the edge of the Great Lake and Draco had brought Harry more pastries and sweets.
-"Serves him right."- a voice Harry didn't recognise said.
Draco was sitting on the bed, resting his hands on his lap.
Every now and then, Draco would gently ask the elves to cook some extra pastries for Harry.
He really did.
Maybe nothing was real.
Harry understood. So many emotions were bubbling inside of him. For one, he was incredibly proud and happy that Draco trusted him enough to tell him this. On the other hand, he wanted to kill Voldemort all over again.
-"I apologise for my lack of manners and for the way I wrote to you."- Draco said with a raspy voice. Harry had to let go of his fork, afraid that he might break it because of his grip.
Back and forth.
wasn't working. And she's a nice person, really. She deserves someone better."- Harry told
-“S-so when I came home at the end of each year, aunt Bella was waiting for me. The scars you saw back then, she made them. She wanted me to learn how to be evil. At first, I confronted her and it wasn’t pretty. After a while, a stopped confronting her and just numbed out my feelings. It was easier.”-
Draco couldn’t stand the sight of it.
-“I just...I was thinking, he’s good at Potions, right? Maybe he might be able to help us.”- Harry stuttered. Hermione bit her lower lip.
-“L-Luna!”-
Harry did have a good taste when it came to muggle cafés. It surprised Draco how good the coffee was and how pretty the place was decorated.
-"I'll find a better nickname then."- He said with a shrug.
Fighting with his own thoughts.
Harry was determined to avenge himself from Draco's name-calling, so he walked in and went directly to the Slytherin table.
Draco had come back looking thinner and paler then ever. Harry couldn’t contain himself so he kept an eye on him.
Sirius was still hiding merlin knows where.
-"Is Master Draco being punished again?"- Dobby asked worriedly. Harry nodded,
-“What are you doing here?”- Harry asked Draco more rudely than he had intended, but Draco didn’t react. He kept himself composed, grey eyes expressionless.
-“Well, for once, I’m going to trust you too.”-
Blaise was immediately beside him, whispering soothing words. Draco could only gasp and shake his head, curling himself in a fetal position and rocking himself back and forth.
-"Starving."-
Harry had called him Draco.
-"Auror."- Ron said without hesitation. Hermione smiled at him.
-“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Your new wand is supposed to arrive in two weeks and you don’t know wandless magic.”- Hermione dismissed, rolling her eyes.
Harry held his breath.
It wasn’t possible.
-"You really need a day off."- one of his co-workers told him, handing him a glass of water.
-"You little brat! After I allowed you in my home and treated you like my own son!"-
Hedwig’s visits became less frequent until finally, she stopped coming.
Had he misread Harry’s expression!? He had never been good at reading people’s expressions.
-“It happens sometimes with soulmates that share a strong bond.”- Hermione explained.
-“Thank you.”- he whispered earnestly.
He was genuinely nice to everyone and he spoke with such a soft voice that it actually soothed Harry.
Draco said nothing but kept trying to gather his stuff with a frown on his face.
than he should, so he should be grateful. But he wasn't. It wasn't comforting at all.
-"Do you...erm..need help?"- Harry asked uncomfortably, noticing how a blush crept upon Malfoy's cheeks.
-"The barrier is purple. Just like Granger's magic."- Draco muttered.
-"Malfoy."- Harry had greeted with a nod. It was simple, but it was friendly enough for Ron and Hermione to speculate.
-"You can see."- Harry gasped in realisation, opening his eyes. Draco nodded.
Not that he would (or could) cry anyways.
Some even clapped.
-"I know."-
-“Mental! Absolutely mental! What were you thinking?”- Harry simply shrugged with his eyes glued to Draco, not wanting to deal with Ron.
-"Uh guys, I think I'm gonna go earlier."- Harry said, already standing up.
Draco sighed in relief.
Hermione snorted.
Three months in, he found out the Lucius had actually been a death eater before, but no one had known about it. Dolohov had been one too and Harry couldn't be happier.
He wanted to talk with him about so many things, bond over so many things that they had in common, but most importantly, he wanted to finally have someone again.
-“Please darling. I’m your best friend and you’re not exactly subtle about hiding it. You literally give him heart eyes every time you watch him.”- Blaise said shrugging.
It was something familiar yet he couldn't exactly name what that feeling was.
-“I’m not here to hurt you. I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”- Harry revealed. Draco’s eye brows rose in shock.
to be.
-“J’ai perdu maman
. Harry thought. That trio not wanting attention was definitely something new to Harry.
Here's a fact: Harry Potter couldn't stop thinking about Draco Malfoy.
Draco had chosen to be a Mind Healer because he thought he was decent at comprehending people's emotions and the way their brains worked, but there was always this thing his body did every time with all of his patients (and everyone in general): he could
-“Maybe we can be a little less chaotic together.”- Draco whispered, staring at Harry’s big green eyes as he gently placed the glasses in Harry’s face properly.
-“You’re literally impossible, you know?”- Blaise gave him a kiss on his cheek.
-“Yes, your favourite: camomile and mint.”- His mother turned to face him and looked at him with a funny expression that Draco couldn’t quite decipher,
-"But mother was quicker, she put herself in front of me, protecting me from the curse. Still, the spell rebounded and it hit my arm in the process. I tried saving her but I...it was.."-
-"Tell us, Harry!"- Hermione encouraged. Harry looked at Ron and then at Hermione.
He was tired, but he nodded anyways.
-"He was simply trying to make me feel more comfortable, sir. We tried to do my hair but it was useless."- Harry said as innocently as he possibly could. Lucius stared at him for a long moment. He tried doing enchantments to Harry's hair but they didn't work. Sighing tiredly, he turned to Draco.
-"I wanted to."- said Harry honestly. Draco stared at him for a long moment until he finally glanced back to his notebook and kept writing.
The boggart had taken Draco’s arm in a way that Harry hadn’t liked at all.
He would never admit that either.
alright if you two are friends, but are you sure that's all you
-“Oh, focus on your chicken Ron.”- Hermione told him, effectively shutting him up but not without him grimacing.
-“Anytime Haz.”-
Harry didn’t care what he felt for Draco.
-“Potter, put your cloak on and get out. Whatever you see, whatever you hear. Don’t stop. Did I made myself clear? Go.”- Draco whispered quickly. Harry put on his cloak just as the door opened.
He also knew that Draco was checking up on him as well. Every night, he would find one of his favourite pastries on his nightstand and that was all Harry would actually eat.
-"I'll come back later."- He muttered quite angrily. Blaise chuckled and stood up.
He had broken his bond with his soulmate.
-"You...you are my patient."- Draco said nervously. Harry grabbed his hand.
-“Are you sure it’s a good idea?”- She asked carefully. Harry shrugged.
-“Expelliarmus!”- Narcissa yelled at the same time Bellatrix casted the unforgivable.
That effectively eased Draco a bit.
He was unbelievable.
-"It seems that you two get along quite nicely."- Hermione pointed out. Harry shrugged again. The owls came, delivering the mail and Harry noticed that Draco had received a Howler. Draco paled and excused himself, Blaise following behind.
-“He forced himself in me. A few older Slytherins started doing it as well, and since I was so tired of everything and didn’t really stop them, they did as they pleased. Blaise and Pansy discovered it once and went bollocks! You should’ve seen them hexing the life out of everyone who got too close to me.”- Draco chuckled, but then frowned,
Harry ripped Draco’s shirt and gasped.
not to be adopted into your family."- Harry admitted.
-“How is he?”- Harry asked.
-"Wipe that smirk off of your face. I can
Suddenly, he started feeling everyone else's emotions.
Harry's emotions more intensely.
By the end of it, Draco felt like he was going to pass out from how much pain and exhaustion he was feeling.
-"No, he's not. You're going back to your table."- Draco commanded. Harry laughed along with a couple of Slytherins.
-“I wouldn’t go in there if I were you.”- said Myrtle.
-"Because I know you."- Harry whispered.
Apparating took more strength than he had at the moment. Harry gently carried him to his room and tucked him in his bed.
Harry had never been good at dealing with his emotions, so when that numbness suddenly took over him, it felt like a relief.
-"Didn't you like the names, Harry? I personally think I was quite creative."- Harry snorted.
Harry did the logical thing: He ran away and locked himself in his room.
-"You see, it has been found recently that Lucius is an ex-death eater."- Harry said casually, earning a shocked gasp from Draco. He hadn't known, but he should've.
. That's how he felt.
-"You had to pick today out of all days to go public. You couldn't have kissed him yesterday."- Ron complained sorrowful, handing his money to Blaise.
-"It's not..I..-He's not interested in me, okay?"- Draco told them defensively, gulping all of his butterbeer and Pansy's firewhiskey. Blaise shot him an amused glance.
-"For Merlin's sake, Draco!"- He said, enchanting Draco's hair to be perfectly combed to the side, making Harry gag on the inside. Personally, he didn't like Draco's hair like that.
-“They hadn’t been able to get under my skin in a long time. I started imagining it was you touching me.”- He kissed Harry’s lips,
-“Now, let’s see...papilio incantatem.”-
The morning came and Harry couldn't wait any longer. He slid into the Slytherin common room and waited for Draco in his room, much to Zabini's dismay.
-"Right? It is a small world.."- Draco followed.
Was Draco really okay?
Harry's pain, frustration or whatever Harry felt in that moment.
Harry screamed in frustration and ran to grab Draco’s arm.
-"Blaise."- He whispered shakily. Blaise's eyes widened in horror and quickly dropped his hand.
They sat on a bench near a park.
Then, Draco guided him to his room and Harry quietly slid into Draco's bed. Draco closed the curtains and casted a Silencing Spell.
-“You coming, mate?”- Ron asked him. Harry realised that he hadn’t moved from his spot and neither had Draco. Draco was watching him with hungry eyes.
And Draco, contrarily to Harry, wanted to feel something.
-"Ron, 'Mione, please bring Headmistress McGonagall."- Harry told them. Hermione and Ron nodded with wide eyes and quickly went to look for McGonagall. Harry sighed tiredly and turned to Malfoy, who was struggling to get his things.
One last year to be at Hogwarts.
Zabini and Parkinson looked at each other and then at Harry.
-"Well hello, saviour-complex boy."-
Even after what had happened, Draco was feeling something other than pain and Harry was feeling something bubbly that, for once, he didn't hate.
-"It's not appropriate."- Draco said, feeling slightly disappointed at his own words.
-"It's fine. I don't really see them all that much anyways. Lucius is always working and Narcissa is at the gardens most of the times."- Harry told him.
Draco was not how he remembered.
Harry stood beside Lucius and Narcissa awkwardly while watching Draco talk quietly with a friend of his, Blaise or something. From what Harry could see, Draco was upset. Blaise was listening, sometimes nodding, and whispering what Harry assumed where comforting words, because Draco seemed to visibly relax. Blaise told something to Draco, and Draco turned to stare at him. Harry blushed and looked down. Draco and Blaise made their way to Harry and smoothly snatched him from Lucius' claws.
The eyes he would recognise anywhere.
-"Excellent, Draco. 30 points to Slytherin."- Professor McGonagall told him half concerned, half proud, making Draco blush.
Christmas holidays came sooner than he expected, and Harry was surprised to find out that Draco was staying at Hogwarts.
films.
-“Aren’t you going to be late? Defence Against the Dark Arts is on the other side of the castle.”- Draco pointed out softly. Harry’s eyes widened and he flushed.
-"How's living with the Malfoys?"- Ron asked one day at breakfast. Harry shrugged.
-“I’m s-sorry. For e-everything.” Draco gulped harshly, finally letting himself cry.
It had started after the war.
-“No.”- Ron shook his head,
-"This will guarantee our safety Draco. You can't make any mistakes now. Think of your mother."- Lucius told him sternly.
-“This one looks different.”- Harry noticed. A name appear above the moving butterfly, making Harry choke up.
His confusion only grew when they arrived at Hogwarts and he saw a couple of students hexing Draco.
-"Don't do this to yourself."- He whispered, pressing his forehead against Draco's.
Harry hadn't even noticed how much time he was actually spending with Draco. He hadn't noticed when he started regularly accompanying Draco to the Slytherin common room (and soon to Draco's dorm). He hadn't noticed that he had learned the password. He hadn't noticed that pretty much all of the Slytherins had gotten used to his presence. He hadn't noticed that he actually enjoyed talking with Zabini and Parkinson as well. He hadn't noticed he had started calling Draco by his first name, but he bloody well remembered the first time Draco had said his.
-"So, how are things going with Malfoy?"- Ron asked once at dinner. Harry, who was too busy staring at Draco, suddenly came out of his trance.
Draco fidgeted with his hands.
-"Oh, you see...if you lose then Harry will.."-
-“I’m so sorry, Draco. I forgot.”- She said quietly, raising her hands in surrender and backing away from Draco to give him space.
Harry’s mouth went dry when he saw Draco walking down the stairs behind Hermione.
Which then grew into a hope
-“I know.”- Harry assured her. He looked back and saw that Draco was still petting the thestral.
-"It's perfect. Thank you."- He said. Narcissa smiled wider at him.
He grabbed Draco by the collar of his long-sleeved shirt and pinned him against the nearest wall.
-“Of course you can.”- Luna smiled and Harry smiled back, sitting beside her.
Draco Malfoy was undeniably beautiful.
-"Glad you're enjoying my misery, Harry."- Draco had said sarcastically, as if he hadn't noticed that he had called Harry by his first name. Harry had beamed for the rest of the week.
-"What NEWTs are you taking?"-
His mother walked towards him but kept some distance between them. His personal distance.
-“I can’t really sleep.”- Draco admitted bashfully.
-“Well, yeah. Pansy and I both knew it, but we wanted to let you discover it. You’re not a child anymore, Draco.”-
-"Breakfast?"- Draco said tentatively when he couldn't feel Blaise's hands any longer.
They decided to seek help from a Mind Healer and that definitely helped them a lot.
Harry pulled up the hood and made his way to the Slytherin common room. Giving the password impatiently, he was allowed in and because he was invisible and his mind was on autopilot, he crashed right against Draco who was about to head out of the common room.
-"I'll take that as a '
-"I'm sure you'll be a good Auror, Ron."- Harry was now watching them both and nodded in agreement at Hermione's statement.
As soon as he closed the door, he ran.
He hadn't seen him since his trial.
-"How's the Auror life treating you?"- Draco asked finally when he calmed down. Harry chuckled.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut.
Harry thought.
Draco watched Harry unconsciously.
He would shyly wave and smile at Harry whenever he found Harry looking at him, and Harry would do the same whenever he caught Draco staring at him.
-"But why not?"- Harry whined.
Harry found himself opening more and more to Draco as the weeks went by. It was weird.
Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Ginny Weasley were also in the room.
-"I'm sorry I lost."- Harry waved his hand in dismissal.
Ron’s guard visibly rose up.
-“He better be. If he dies, I’m going to kill him.”- Draco mumbled incoherently.
-“It’s part of his probation. He’s not allowed to use his wand neither outside of Hogwarts, nor inside of it. Only during class and he has to be supervised.”- Luna explained,
-“But apparently, they didn’t intended to do it as much as they thought they did, because it didn’t hurt nearly as much as the one from the first day. I just lost control.”-
-"I greeted him, didn't you see?"-
-"What's the bet about?"- Ron smirked at the question.
The way wasn’t full of blue skies and sunshines, but it was full of flowers and butterflies.
He had almost used an unforgivable on his soulmate.
."- Harry spat full of venom, then he cleared his throat.
No matter how much of a prat he was, Harry Potter deserved to be happy. And Draco was going to help him.
Draco smiled and he didn't had nightmares that day.
Sans l’avoir mérité
They made their way to the castle together. When it was time for them to go in their respective ways, Draco asked him fearfully:
-"He's in a lot of pain."- Draco said impotently.
-"You're seriously not gonna stay standing, are you? Sit down and help me eat this. It's way too much food for me anyways."- Draco said, not looking at Harry. Harry noticed a faint pink tint on Draco's cheek but shrugged it off. Harry ate with him quietly.
Harry noticed the small blush on Draco’s cheeks.
Blaise was reading peacefully while Pansy made an essay.
-“I’m friends with Draco.”- Harry said flatly.
-"Draco! Nonsense, come in."- Harry encouraged with a small smile. Ginny was holding Harry's right hand and Draco felt something weird on his chest.
Harry observed the ruins of the place his godfather had grew up (and had been abused) in, shivering when the thought of doing the exact same thing to his cupboard at Privet Drive entered his mind, floating like a bubble inside his brain.
-“I like you too.”-
-“G-Granger! What are y-you doing in here?”- Draco asked, rather nervously. Hermione’s face softened a bit.
Draco simply turned and headed towards the door.
-“You’ll pay for that, Potter. Cru..”-
-"My, my. To what do we owe the
He was floating.
-“PANSY KNEW!? Is there anyone who doesn’t know?”- Draco asked dramatically.
-“Well obviously, you’re soulmates Harry. The bond is stronger. You don’t have to date him but you both need to have an agreement if you don’t. Otherwise it’ll drive you mad. Believe me.”- Hermione explained.
But Draco had disappeared.
Harry chuckled bitterly.
then tell me why are you still so afraid? Hm
-"I know, I just wanted to help."- Harry explained. Draco nodded.
-"Bugger."- Harry muttered frustratedly. He was at the library with Draco as usual, but couldn't understand a single thing about his Potions’ essay.
-"S-stop."- Draco pleaded. Harry was kneeling with him.
-“When did they started? The panic attacks, I mean. You don’t have to answer if you feel uncomfortable. You know what? It was silly of me, you do..”-
-"That's..-it's been two weeks! Is he crazy!? Why didn't any of you stop him?"-
They weren’t friends.
-"I'm sure we will."- Draco agreed.
Ron choked on his pumpkin juice and cleared his throat.
-"Master Lucius punishes him often."- Dobby muttered, Apparating away. Harry paced back and forth impatiently. After what seemed an eternity, Dobby returned with a tray full of food which Harry gratefully took. He walked towards the room that had engraved "
-"Fine then."- He grabbed Draco's mechanical hand and guided him to the Slytherin table, much to everyone's surprise.
-"I ate sweets from the trolley. I'm full."- He lied smoothly.
-“Why are you on her side?”- Harry asked.
-“Malfoy?”- A voice called. Draco gasped and took out his hand.
-"Well, I reckon you can beat Ron here in Wizard's Chess but Ron said I'm delusional, so we made a bet."- Harry explained. Draco raised a brow.
-"Are you close, Potter?"- Draco asked.
-"What if he doesn't like me?"- Draco asked with wide eyes. Lupin laughed.
-"You should be more careful though, Potter."- Draco advised.
-"What’s that supposed to mean?"-
Not this time.
-“Why me?”- Draco asked suspiciously. Hermione sighed tiredly.
?"- Sirius asked, suddenly feeling a lump on his throat. This felt similar to when James had confessed to him that he liked Lily. Of course, Sirius had dismissed him at first because this was
-"Good. What about you Hermione?"-
He grabbed Draco by his tie and pulled him closer to him before kissing him in front of everyone.
-“How are you feeling?”- Harry asked, gesturing the injury.
The boggart took it’s time before shifting into his aunt Bellatrix. Neville gasped in horror.
-“Shall we eat then?”-
had Harry James Potter grown to be so bloody handsome?
Harry stood there shocked.
When Draco Malfoy saw Sirius Black, he felt home.
-“Then I’ll punch him straight in the face.”- Ron shrugged. Harry chuckled.
-"Is there anything I can help you with, Mr. Potter?"- He asked.
As soon as those words left his mouth, both Draco and Harry felt it inside.
Narcissa showed Harry around and the latter one was impressed. Narcissa opened the door of what it seemed to Harry was going to be his new room. The room was bigger than his cupboard. It was actually bigger than any other place he had been in. It was beautifully decorated with a faded red-patterned wallpaper and golden details.
-"Padfoot, you there?"- Harry asked. To his delight, Sirius appeared.
-“They can’t get under my skin if I don’t let them in. So you can’t let them get to you either. We’re here now. Together. That’s all that matters. I don’t know if it’s enough but you can willingly have me. All of me.”- Harry kissed Draco hard.
-"No one should take away your food."- Harry whispered, looking down. He dared to glance at Draco, who was looking at him with a expression that Harry couldn't figure out.
Deux plus un fait trois
-“This is going to hurt for a moment. Stay still, alright?”- she said. Draco tried to smile at her but it looked more like a grimace.
Harry was angry. Draco could feel it. Before he knew it though, Harry was kissing him.
Blaise had hexed the student commenting on Draco.
-“Mate, you coming?”- Ron asked, putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry was joyful, and therefore, Draco felt joyful as well.
Draco froze on his spot at the sight of Harry.
.”- She promised.
-“I thought about giving up a few times, y’know? But seeing you smiling with your friends was enough to keep me going.”- Draco said so softly that for a moment, Harry though he had imagined it.
And it felt
-"I talked with Mcgonagall. She reckons the announcement is necessary, but she won't mention you or make any indirects that could possible affect you."- Potter told him. Draco sighed in relief. It was better than nothing.
-"How so?"- Harry asked curiously.
Rivers scoffed, slightly offended.
Back and forth.
’ with you befriending the ferret. You could befriend Moaning Myrtle for all I care, but the fact that you hid it from us all this time!? What if something had happened to you, huh!? What if he hadn’t changed!? I’m thankful he did but what if he hadn’t, Harry? What then, huh?”- Ron said with pain in his voice.
-"Hey! Don't call my friend stupid. He was out of his wits."- Harry defended, earning an eye-roll from Draco.
-“You look great.”- He told Hermione, but his sight never left Draco’s body.
-"Yeah, I think you're being delusional."- Harry said coolly. Draco wanted to wipe that smirk off of his face.
them echoing all around him.
-"Chosen one."-
-“Thank Merlin you came!”- Blaise told Harry. Harry had just arrived to Draco’s room to find Blaise and Pansy there. They were both decorating the room.
-"Facts!"- Pansy followed.
-"Very well, I shall fetch Draco so that you can meet him. He might be very quiet at first, but he'll warm up to you in no time."- Narcissa told him and left the room. Harry let out a gasp and starting unpacking his few belongings.
Harry had invited him to Remus' and Sirius' cottage because he lived with them and he wanted Draco to finally meet Sirius. Harry knew how badly Draco wanted to meet him.
Pansy laughed humourlessly.
-“Salazar! Say no more, M’lady.”- Blaise said and they both exited the room much to Harry’s dismay.
-"What the fuck, Draco!?"-
A warm, bright light engulfed them both the moment their hands came in contact with each other, making Harry gasp.
Draco sighed and nodded.
-“Come on, Draco. M’sleepy.”- Harry said, tugging him from the sleeve of his shirt.
What could’ve possibly happened during vacations that made Draco change so much?
-“Nervous? Panicky? Not good, that’s for sure.”-
-“You sleep just fine with me.”- Harry said and then he realised,
But he wanted to give Harry some space.
-“I just realised something and it took me a while to calm down because I kinda…freaked out.”- Harry admitted.
He owled Lucius and asked to see him with McGonagall.
Draco bit his lip but nodded and went back to his office. He found out soon enough that he couldn't concentrate.
this Draco.
Harry would wait for Draco and walk him to his classes. This happened a few times but not so often that people would get suspicious. After all, the only classes they shared were Transfiguration and Potions.
Harry was about to hex the life out of the petrified Ravenclaw when he suddenly felt a cold hand intertwining with his.
-"I..uh..I need to speak with Malfoy alone."- Harry told him.
. If anyone asked, she'd say she was learning a new language, but Draco bloody well knew that she had learned the word from The Lion King II.
So why in Merlin’s name did Harry’s heart skipped a beat every time he saw him?
-"I'll take you."- Harry offered.
-"Hi. I'm Draco. Draco Malfoy. Are you going to buy your robes as well?"- He asked, turning to face Harry.
Draco entered despite Myrtle’s warning and found Harry on the floor, blood dripping down his wrist and pained sobs fulfilling the air.
Draco opened his mouth but closed it again. He was fine. Rivers simply didn't understand.
But he had completely forgotten about them.
He didn’t know how he felt about Draco.
-“He went to take a bath. He’ll be back in any minute.”- Blaise told him.
-“Would it be so bad if the rumours were true?”- Harry asked.
His own glow however, was dark red.
He knew it wasn’t healthy but he had so much rage inside. He couldn’t even mourn properly because of the Dursley’s, so that only added up to his anger.
In times like this, he wished he had his dad, or Sirius, or Remus, or anyone to help him figure things out.
Draco could
-"Where is he?"- Harry asked. Blaise and Pansy exchanged looks before looking back at Harry.
-"Y-yes."- Said Harry rather shyly.
Harry was acting weird.
-"Speaking of that, I should really get back."- Draco said, looking down. Harry nodded.
-"You'll be a wonderful professor."- Draco sighed. Harry chuckled.
On Saturday, Harry went to see Draco since it was a free day.
-"Why do
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile
Harry asked several trivial questions. Draco wouldn't exactly answer them, but he wasn't ignoring Harry either.
-“He was keeping me company. Draco can be very nice when he wants to.”- Luna replied smoothly before Draco opened his mouth.
He knew that he could've studied at Beauxbatons but it just didn't seem right to him. Hogwarts was his home.
-"Do you do double shifts often?"-
Draco was terrified.
-“Our carriage is the last one. Come with us.”- Draco shook his head vigorously.
Harry stroked his hair gently.
But this side of Draco was rarely seen, and Harry soon realised why.
She guided Harry to Draco’s bed. Draco opened his eyes slowly.
-“Follow me and be quiet.”- Harry nodded, -“Someone used an unforgivable on him, causing him to lose control of his magic. He blasted off the boy’s bathroom on the second floor wandless.”- She explained.
Harry stared at Draco for the longest time until Draco looked down, automatically rubbing the arm on which his new tattoo rested gracefully.
-“Checkmate.”- Harry whispered.
He stopped dead in his tracks, however, when he felt an inexplicably huge amount of pain.
-"Aren't you friends with that muggleborn...what was it?...-Granger? I heard
Maybe the answer was hidden in the problem.
-"That's a lie."- Harry smiled.
-"It'll be our little secret Harry."- Lucius had said before leaving.
Up and down.
-“I’ve got my Invisibility Cloak.”-
Harry James was a panicky mess.
What could’ve possibly happened to make him meaner?
-"You betrayed my trust."- Draco whispered back. He was tired.
Voldemort was back.
Harry had tried to contact him in at first, sending Hedwig once per week. Draco would take the letter from Hedwig, feed her, and then send her back without anyone noticing it.
-"He's always out of his wits."-
Harry didn’t waste time and kissed him softly. Draco kissed back.
Harry Apparated in St. Mungo's and asked to see Draco as politely as he could, considering he was fucking pissed and he didn't even knew why.
He genuinely did.
Draco didn’t like change.
-“Oh you know, suppressing your magic is never good.”-
-"Draco, is this
."- Blaise whispered tauntingly, earning a laugh from Pansy and another smack from Draco.
He stood up from Draco's bed rather clumsily and gave Draco a nervous smile.
-"Sorry."- Harry said, letting out a nervous laugh but didn't move.
-"I was planning on double-shifting."- Draco admitted.
-"Merlin! People will always talk. Just grab my elbow, you git."- Harry told him. Draco nodded decisively and grabbed Harry's arm ever so gently, searching for his elbow.
Harry stayed silent for a few minutes.
Harry shrugged.
So of course, the news reached the entire school by the end of their third week.
He told Draco about how marvelled he was when he went through the lake.
Harry couldn’t help himself and he kissed Draco. Draco kissed him back softly but he was the first to pull away, earning a small whine from Harry.
.”- Draco casted sternly, not paying attention to the comments. But the boggart didn’t crack.
-"But he seemed fine at the trial."- Harry pointed out.
Harry was astonished. Blaise nodded.
He always ended up in the bathroom with Myrtle.
-"How did Ronald take that?"- Draco asked, sipping his coffee.
-"Oh..oh, Merlin!"- He moaned softly while eating.
-"Well?"- Draco asked expectantly.
-"Thanks."- Draco muttered, apparently as embarrassed as he felt. Harry froze, and without saying anything, he simply nodded and walked to his table.
. Draco thought.
-"Uh, what's this about?"- Draco asked nervously, letting go of Harry's hand. Harry took his hand again.
He was avoiding Draco, and the latter didn’t like that one bit. So when he finally caught him in the Astronomy Tower one night, he confronted him about it.
-"Thank you for the coffee."- Draco said politely and stood up. Harry too, stood up (rather clumsily).
-"You are
Cedric was dead.
-“I don’t trust Malfoy.”- Ron said slowly. Hermione sighed,
Unfortunately, Harry was long gone and hadn’t heard those words.
-“I’m avoiding everyone, Draco. You’re not that special.”- Harry spat, but Draco seemed unfazed.
-"Absolutely not."- Draco said firmly.
Every now and then, when the halls were nearly empty, Harry would walk close enough to grab Draco's hand.
-“He’ll be fine, Draco.”- Pansy told him, grabbing his hand.
He was behind his schedule for fifteen minutes.
-“I like you, Draco. Merlin, help me!”- Harry said nervously, moving closer towards Draco. Draco blushed, -“And I’m going mad because you keep avoiding me, so can you please stop and let me kiss you?”- Harry asked helplessly.
So much that he wanted to gag.
-"I'll take you!"- Harry offered. Draco didn't have time to protest because Harry was already grabbing his cloak, so Draco followed him.
-"You got the D, then?"- Blaise asked him. Draco groaned.
-“On who’s side, Potter?”- Draco smirked.
-“I deserve it. I was a bully and an arse.”- Draco told him quickly, resting his hand on top of Harry’s. Only then did Harry realised that his hand was emitting a soft, red glow.
Bellatrix screamed.
Did he liked Draco?
And Harry felt something in his stomach that he hadn’t felt in the short time he had dated Ginny.
-"Of fucking course. He's everywhere! Gimme that."- Draco murmured, gesturing with his hands dramatically and grabbing Blaise's drink.
Harry felt overwhelmed yet numb at the same time.
Harry had learned how much Draco liked routines and him doing his hair was one of them. Seeing Draco like that made Harry blush.
Harry was disgusted.
-"I think I'm much better than I was before our sessions."-
Draco raised his hand and Harry raised a brow, watching the blonde intently.
-“Like hell I’m leaving you here. Not with Malfoy around out of all people.”- He told Harry firmly. Harry sighed.
Harry said nothing about it and instead stood up, extending a hand for Draco to take.
-“Blaise!”-
No need to say goodbye..”- as Draco sang, Harry kept whispering “Fleur Incantatem” on Draco’s arm.
-“I’ve handled worse, Potter.”- Draco responded with a raspy voice, swallowing hard.
But then, the year ended.
-“You know exactly what I’m talking about. Who was that? Why did she held you like that?”- Harry asked. Draco sighed and stopped. The hall was empty.
Draco cleared his throat.
One time, Harry and his friends were walking to Potions and Harry was feeling specially happy because he shared it with Draco when he heard him.
-“I haven’t been scared since you started looking out for me. Asides from Pansy, Blaise, and Luna, you were the only person to treat me like an actual human being.”- Draco admitted.
-“Obviously, you can glamour them as I’m sure you’ve done in the past; however, I suggest you keep the bandages at least for three days, otherwise they might get infected.”-
Harry felt himself calming down.
Harry shrugged and kept walking.
-“I know what I’m doing.”- Harry affirmed. Ron shrugged.
-"You know Potter, this is one of Draco's favourite songs. Why don't you take him out for a dance?"- Pansy suggested. Draco choked on Blaise's drink. His throat was burning and his heart was beating way too fast.
-“Is it bad?”- Draco asked shakily.
Removing her hand gently, Draco excused himself in no more than a whisper. Grabbing his things, he ran as fast as he could to the prefects bathroom.
So instead, he would read them and memorise them before burning them.
-“Leave him alone!”- Ron yelled, surprising both Harry and Hermione.
He even was happy to be able to finally do essays without the threat of imminent death knocking at his door.
The war could wait.
Harry smiled.
-“I’ll uh..I’ll catch up in a minute. G-go ahead.”-
Harry was sad.
-"You know exactly what it means."- said Draco coldly, surprising Harry by the sudden change.
Draco made his way to him.
So Ron made no comments and ate his breakfast quietly, giving Hermione a knowing look when she was about to comment on Harry's eating habits.
-"Sorry you had to see that. I'm fine."- Draco told him.
-"He'll be alright. You can see him now."- He told him.
secret.
They didn't spoke anymore but Harry couldn't sleep.
Harry squinted his eyes to see better and soon enough, his walk became a desperate run.
Running had
-"Yes! I...well.."- Harry ran his hands through his hair exasperatedly. Now that he remembered, Malfoy hadn't look at him once during the trial. Malfoy, Harry recalled, seemed to be frozen on his spot. Realisation hit him,
-“One of those nights?”-
A lot of people were whispering and gossiping, Harry could hear them; but his focus remained unwavering towards Draco.
Yet again, the feeling was addictive.
Harry didn’t understand what was happening or how he could hear Draco’s voice inside his head.
-"And you can see everyone's magical barrier?"- Harry asked. Draco nodded.
-"Were you with Malfoy again?"- Ron asked. Harry limited himself to nod. Ron groaned.
-"Why? Is he okay?"- Harry asked. Zabini looked him straight in the eye.
-"Mother grabbed me immediately and we Apparated at the Manor. Death Eaters were waiting for us. One of them casted an Incendio towards me."- Harry wanted to vomit. Draco sighed,
?"- Blaise said amusedly, earning a glare from Draco. Blaise winked at him and walked out of the room, leaving Harry and Draco alone.
Harry stared in awe and saw what Draco couldn’t see in himself: beauty.
-"A mind healer."- he said at last.
Draco was broken out of his trance and helped Harry to pick up his books, much to the latter's surprise.
Other than widened eyes, Draco didn’t show any signs of hurt.
Harry’s mouth went dry when he saw him.
-"Excuse you, I'm a delight."- Draco rolled his eyes. Harry smirked.
-"You're in good company. I'll come by later. Ms. Granger, Ms. Weasley, Ronald."- He greeted politely and walked out of the room.
Wormtail had brought him back to life.
-“It’s a bit weird, don’t you think? That we can now see thestrals.”- Hermione spoke, breaking the tense silence.
At first, Harry was simply going to wander around without any particular destination in mind, but after seeing Draco in the Astronomy Tower, he couldn't help but feel curious.
-“You were always more than enough.”- the kiss soon heated up, but Draco pulled away.
-"What about Draco?"- Hermione chimed in.
He knew that Harry wasn't eating.
Draco really was against him.
Harry discovered that Draco was at the Astronomy Tower every night. Harry went there at least three times a week because of his nightmares, and Draco always held him quietly, comforting Harry as best as he could. Draco didn't treat him differently in the mornings or even mentioned it, but he stopped ignoring Harry.
-"You don't understand! I embarrassed myself in front of him, Blaise!"- Draco said dramatically, burying his face in his hands.
Harry grabbed his hand with extreme care. As if he knew Draco felt uncomfortable with human touch.
-"Don't get your knickers in a twist, I'll help you out. I'll teach you everything you need to know."- Draco offered. Harry beamed.
-“Harry, show me your wrists.”-
-"Shut up."- Harry hid a smile, finishing his breakfast instead. Draco laughed.
-"Draco? Is that you? Are you okay?"- Harry was standing right in front of him.
Draco began opening more and more towards Harry, allowing gentle knee touches and arms brushing.
Harry saw him.
Harry sat down and Draco started humming again. Harry listened closely until Draco stopped.
-“I’m sorry I can’t do more.”- Blaise said shamefully.
-“Wait what!? How could you possibly know? I didn’t know!”- Draco asked shocked.
They weren’t friends. Draco had to remind himself when he felt his heart drop a bit.
Panting, he sat on the soft, ticklish grass and let his hands roam through it back and forth.
Draco really tried not to react.
-"W-what!? What!? What was that all about?"- Ron asked. Harry shrugged, trying to act nonchalantly as if his heart wasn’t threatening to burst out of his chest.
-"Moony, that you?"- Draco heard Sirius' voice.
-“What are you doing in here?”- Draco asked shakily.
Ron shook his head.
?”- Blaise exclaimed theatrically with fake surprise.
When Harry learned that Draco was his soulmate, he had been so excited. He didn’t quite understand what Draco had meant when he had told him that they were soulmates but the idea made his heart flutter.
-“Is your head full of nargles too, Harry?”- Luna whispered. Draco observed from the corner of his eyes, smirking internally when Harry flushed.
Did he liked everyone regardless?
Draco looked over.
Harry realised that he really was in the palm of Draco’s hand, so he kissed him.
Not even Draco himself was able to understand what was going on with him. All he knew was that he could
-“Accio Dittany!”- Hermione chanted to her open bag. The bag threw her a small bottle and Hermione took a shaky hold on the dagger that was on Draco’s left side of his stomach.
Harry was going mad but he didn’t knew what to do. Until that day.
-“It’ll be right, I promise.”-
The only sounds he could hear were those of nature and those actually helped to sooth him down.
-"You so have."- Blaised said amusedly with a laugh, touching Draco's arm. Draco froze.
Draco squeaked, making Harry laugh loudly.
By now, Harry had heard and experienced how good Draco was at his job but he
Pansy and Blaise came back with more drinks, eyeing Draco knowingly.
He ran and ran and ran out of the castle.
It had been a few months since he had spoken in Draco’s favour during the trials and he hadn’t expected him to come back.
-"You have to get up, you
Draco opened his eyes abruptly feeling like he couldn’t breathe.
Did Harry not like him!?
The boy spotted him through the mirror he was looking at himself in and immediately grinned.
Of course, he didn’t know back then what he knew now. Still, that didn’t comfort him.
That’s how they work, how they would always work.
-“I certainly had
Painful memories of the Dark Lord touching him in places he didn’t want to be touched came rushing all at once. He could feel his breathing becoming harder.
! I'm sure he'll be fine."- Hermione had told him, but before Harry could say something Ron told her,
Draco was undeniably beautiful.
-“Put your head on my lap.”- the blonde said at last. Harry gasped.
-“Where have
It had never been that much of a problem until the day he reencountered with Harry Potter.
talk about my parents again."- Harry threatened, voice low and dangerous. He let go of Draco and the latter one stared at him with wonder and curiosity.
Harry lifted Draco’s chin and finally, he could see those grey eyes. The real him.
-"I'm assuming mother already told you, but in case she didn't, my name's Draco."- He introduced softly before walking away.
But neither Draco nor Harry had heard him, too lost in each other to care.
-"Thank you."- He said sincerely.
Draco wished he did.
it."-
-"I'm always third-wheeling Hermione and Ron. I'm sure they won't mind."-
-"This is not your book, it's Granger's."- Draco commented, observing the book carefully. Harry nodded.
-"Thank you."- Draco told him once they got to the entrance to the Slytherin common room.
-"No."-
Harry stared at him, then at Luna, and then back at him with a sneer, his wand in his hand.
-"I noticed."- Harry said simply. He felt Draco nod but didn't dare to look up.
In his mind, Harry would enter into the Slytherin common room, find Draco and declare his affection towards him in a decent way....but he was Harry.
-"I need a favour. You don't have to do it of course."-
-"What. About. Now?"-
Draco thought that maybe if he ignored Harry long enough he would just leave.
So the logical thing to do was to grab his Cloak and pull Draco into the nearest, empty classroom.
-"Petrificus Totalus!"- He yelled with his wand in hand, effectively freezing the Ravenclaw on his spot.
The need to feel that everything would finally end.
So instead, Harry sneaked into the Slytherin common room clumsily and ended up crashing against Draco, knocking them both on the floor.
-“Mental, that one. Kept hanging out with mudbloods and blood traitors. No wonder why his father punished him.”- someone said.
He excused himself for a moment and headed towards the source of the pain.
-“Yeah? Well, if you must know, I have no ‘
To an extent, he felt alone. Sure, he had Harry, Pansy, and Blaise, of course. But he also wanted (
-"I just don't get why you wouldn't tell us about this."- Hermione insisted. Harry shrugged.
Turns out that Draco had been trying to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts all along.
Draco remembered that he still had a patient.
His friends weren’t allowed to contact him.
-“Oh, butterflies.”- Harry answered nonchalantly, but Draco saw how Harry pushed down his robes to hide his wrist.
-“We can even pact it if that’ll make you feel more comfortable.”- Draco suggested. Harry shook his head.
Like a rest.
One of the few memories that remained untouched in his mind.
He casted off the Muffliato from his room and headed to his bathroom to get ready for another day at work.
He covered his hands with his ears but it was no use because he could
No. He had to go. Hogwarts was waiting.
-"I like Draco. By Merlin, I like Draco Malfoy."- Harry exclaimed frantically.
-“Alright then, if you’re absolutely sure about it.”- Draco told him. Harry nodded solemnly and stood up.
-"His mother grabbed him and apparated them away."- Ron chimed in.
Draco was holding Zabini's and Parkinson's elbows with his hands. He held them in such a way that no one would've noticed that he was holding their elbows instead of their arms. If only it weren't for the gossip.
His mother was making him breakfast and a cup of tea was waiting for him at the dinning table.
When Harry talked about painful events or something that frustrated him a lot, it seemed to him that Draco was in pain...like he actually
He wasn't the best at labelling either.
He just wanted a bit of goddamn peace and instead, he had embarrassed himself in front of Potter.
-"Why, hello Draco."- He greeted happily. Draco turned around and raised a brow before standing up.
people's emotions. It got worse when my mother died. I don't know how to tune people's emotions out, but I do know how to focus on just one person's emotions and feel those deeper and stronger for a bit, which is why I can work effectively with my patients."- Draco left out the fact that he could feel Harry's emotions more intensely because that just seemed a bit too much to reveal.
-"Why are you here, Potter?"- Draco asked.
-"Come on, little ones. Time to rise."- Draco whispered softly, watering the plants. He heard the bell ringing and felt a pair of arms wrapping around him.
In the weeks that followed, Harry spent more and more time with Draco, finding his presence quite calming. Draco became the definition of soft.
A lot of things happened all at once.
-"I wanted to give it a shot. I had nothing to lose, and I had nowhere to go. Well, that's a lie. McGonagall did offered me to stay with her until I could afford a place but I didn't want to bother her. I didn't want to bother anyone. So when your parents offered, I took the chance. Narcissa seemed nice and Lucius was decent enough with me."- Harry told him. Draco hummed in response,
After the war, Draco finished his studies at Hogwarts and trained to be a Mind Healer. At the beginning, people distrusted him...some still do. But with Potter's testimony, people knew better than to gossip in his face. He didn't care about the rumours because he was pleasantly surprised when Potter testified for him.
Little bits, but he still counted that as a victory.
Draco scoffed.
Harry thought of the first time Draco had said his name,
idea, Blaise. But I do believe we forgot the cups to pour the drinks, shall we fetch them?”- Pansy said with an equal tone, earning a glare from Draco.
to come here. I didn't ask to be
He talked until Draco's breaths found their normal rhythm.
Harry noticed how, even though they were sitting relatively close, both Blaise and Pansy gave Draco a little space.
-"If I pass my NEWTs, I'll tell you. That alright with you both?"- Hermione and Ron nodded unsure,
Harry shook his head and chose to ignore it.
-"Would you like to join us, Potter?"- Blaise invited politely. Draco sneered and Blaise coughed a laugh.
It was the first time Harry had seen him cry.
Draco stood up with a bit of difficulty, but still gracefully.
Draco laid beside Harry rather stiffly.
-“What do you mean?”- Harry asked confusedly. This time, Draco looked down and fidgeted with his hands.
Harry let out a gasp of horror and realisation. Two weeks had gone by and Draco was avoiding him.
His mind was spinning with “what if” thoughts but he didn’t want to worry his mother.
something more. It was physically hurting him.
-“He was worried about you and told us what happened. I told him to wait for you at the Slytherin dorms and..-don’t look at me like that, we know you’ve been sneaking out. You’re not subtle. Anyways, I told him to wait there while I talked to you. You have the Invisibility Cloak but he has nothing, he could get in trouble for being here. So, you better get your arse out of that bed and into the Slytherin common room.”- Ron said. Harry nodded decidedly, grabbing his dad’s cloak and putting it on.
-"Checkmate!"- Ron said brightly. Draco extended his hand.
-"So, Harry Potter. Draco's told me about you."- Blaise said with a raised brow. Draco scoffed.
Distant sobs were heard. His own, he realised.
-“I..I think so?”-
And Harry was kissing Draco again.
He didn't really remembered how he had ended up in the Court Room, but he did remembered how he felt when Draco saw him.
-"Mr. Jones, we do not condone any type of bullying here at Hogwarts. Professor Flitwick will arrange your detentions and Ravenclaw will lose 70 points. Go now, and you better hope I don't find out that you did this again to Mr. Malfoy or any other student or I won't be so nice. Flitwick."- Draco couldn't see it, but he could imagine Headmistress McGonagall nodding at professor Flitwick.
By dinner, Harry realised why he was adopted. Lucius was staring smugly at a copy of The Daily Prophet, in which he appeared on the first page, along with Narcissa and Harry.
He fucking liked Draco Malfoy.
Harry woke up on Friday night of the first week after an awful nightmare including Voldemort and wandered off to the Astronomy Tower. He found Draco there.
He didn’t notice that Harry was watching him the entire time.
He hadn’t the faintest idea.
He stared at those goddamned green eyes.
-“Sometimes…it’s all too much. The people, the lights, the smells, the sounds, everything. Sometimes I just need to stay away for a bit to calm down.”- Draco admitted softly, hugging is knees.
-"Harry Potter, I presume?"- A soft yet piercing voice said, startling Harry. He turned to find Draco standing in front of him.
-“I’m afraid you’ll have to be more specific.”- Draco told him dismissively.
-“You were my birthday wish.”-
-“Ah, ah, ah...I wouldn’t do that if I were you. At least I’m a man. Is it not better that I do it?”- Nott whispered before forcing himself onto Draco.
-“We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”- Draco said shakily. Harry took Draco’s hand in his and intertwined their fingers together.
Draco could feel that.
-“I..well, I don’t want to...am I even welcome here?”- Draco asked, very confused.
-"A nuisance, that's what he is."- Lucius muttered, letting them all in.
-"What about them?"- Harry asked back.
All the butterflies had left Harry.
It was as if he was heavily drunk or drugged all the time.
-“It started out as a feeling
-"You really don't have to."- Harry said, smiling tiredly.
-“Let’s go, Draco.”- Harry interrupted Draco’s protests with a soft yet firm order.
Like a warm light illuminating the night, the broken bond was mending inside of them.
Draco was about to open the door when Harry shouted from the end of the hall,
-"I'll lead you to your room, Harry."-
-“Really? That’s good! How’d it happen?”-
-"He has nightmares. He relives the day after the Wizarding War every night. He can
Maybe it was because of that or maybe it was because Harry felt different that Draco realised that he liked touching Harry.
-“You like Draco, don’t you?”-
-“I know enough!”- Harry spat back.
Harry told him put his hand on Draco's shoulder. Draco nodded at him.
And it was addictive.
-“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Cruci..”-
Ron stared at him with a quizzical expression.
-"Draco, stop!"- Harry complained one night. Draco tensed for a second but then relaxed.
Jamais je ne
-"I'm sorry, I know you don't like to be touched."- Harry whispered. Draco tensed.
it. But he could
Harry sat beside him awkwardly.
Harry had been the last one to leave Transfiguration and found that Draco was outside, apparently searching for something.
-"Hi, golden boy."-
Draco Malfoy was walking through the Great Hall, along with Blaise Zabini on his left and Pansy Parkinson on his right.
-"I know. Come with me, you'll rest for a bit."-
Recovery wasn’t easy for either of them. There were a lot of ups and downs.
-"What do you mean?"- Harry asked innocently.
He had let the death eaters in.
It was better to tire himself out working and helping people than being alone at the manor reliving everyone's pain each night.
. He thought as he squeezed his eyes shut.
-"I know I shouldn't have done that."-
-"Why am I here?"- Draco asked suspiciously.
Draco breathed heavily, and with a strength that Harry had never seen on him before, he stood up.
-"Are you?"- Draco asked.
-“He has liked you since fourth year, Potter. I’m actually surprised you didn’t figure it out earlier. Draco said you were oblivious, but this is next level.”- Said Blaise with a laugh, not caring to hide his amusement.
Still refusing to turn and face Harry, and before he could think any better, Draco said:
-“Pans.”- Blaise warned, grabbing her shoulder gently.
-"He really isn't. He's brilliant."- Harry went on telling Draco about Ron, and Draco listened carefully.
Draco sat in between Blaise and Pansy, who greeted him with soft smiles.
Draco could feel his nervousness.
-"But I could really have a coffee right now."- he added somewhat unsure.
-“Y-you know..”- Draco said softly to Harry while Hermione was pouring the Dittany on his injury,
-"I don't know. Not...this, ugh."- Harry told him, gesturing vaguely with his hands.
-"You'll take care of him, right?"- Draco asked, still concerned.
He stormed to the Slytherin table, specifically towards Zabini and Parkinson.
, Harry. I know. But that's how the Ministry saw it at that time. Anything that might have happened to him during the war does not concern them. And you know he wasn't the only one injured."- Hermione's voice dropped at the end and stared at Ron. Ron waved his hand dismissively.
Maybe they were friends after all.
-"Honestly, Potter. It was an innocent jinx. Just let him go."- There was something in Malfoy's tone that almost made Harry comply.
-“That’s what friends are for.”- Harry answered.
Draco had spent twenty minutes trying to fix it but the moment he looked at his reflection in the mirror, he only saw a young, thinner version of Lucius. Not recognising himself, he sighed painfully and messed up his hair frustratedly, his sleeve rolling in the process, revealing the faintest sign of a scar where the Dark Mark once rested.
He yelped and grabbed his head with his hands.
-"How can he even notice that sort of stuff? It's not like he can
Harry was even more shocked to see that the arm in which once rested the Dark Mark was now gone, being replaced by a mechanical arm.
-“Don’t even ask.”- Harry told him and Ron shrugged.
And if he died, that would be better than seeing Harry’s face of betrayal.
He should’ve known that his safe haven would be discovered sooner or later. He just didn’t think that it would be discovered by his soulmate.
Harry walked into Madame Malkin's shop to buy his Hogwarts robes.
Draco woke up already feeling nervous. His hands were sweating and his body was shaking.
-“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”- Draco finally stopped petting the thestral and turned to face Harry,
-“A-Are you sure it’s alright for me to be here?”-
Harry wondered when and why exactly it had happened, but the only answer he received was his breaths becoming shorter and shorter with every passing moment he thought about it.
-"If you must."- He guided Harry to his office and closed the door.
-"What are you doing here, Potter?"- Draco spat with as much venom as he could possibly muster.
Harry was frantically searching for Draco and ended up in the entrance that led to the Slytherin common room. Blaise was just about to go in when Harry called him. Blaise turned and sighed in relief.
-“If you have a problem with it, spit it out.”- Harry said, equally heated.
-"What about you, Harry?"- Ron asked. Harry's mood visibly changed.
Pansy threw herself over Draco to hug him, but Draco exclaimed:
Draco cowered when anyone came anywhere near him, recoiling rather visibly. He never defended himself whenever someone hexed him or insulted him. He kept his head low and became very quiet.
Harry blushed.
Harry felt frustrated and angry.
-"Harry,
-"I'll walk you out."- Draco added, rising from his chair.
-“I..uh, yes. Let’s go.”- Harry agreed. The trio walked past Draco, but the latter didn’t seem to notice them.
Fais chavirer les nuages
Harry was eating them all with ease.
If he did, he would’ve seen a smile that reached those goddamned green eyes he had fell in love with.
-"It seems that Malfoy was hexed by...oh, dear..-Voldemort himself during the war. You know, when he handed you the wand when you
-“You.”- Draco whispered, giving Harry a small peck.
A positive emotion.
-“Williams, to my office. Now. Zabini, take Mr. Malfoy to the Hospital Wing.”- She commanded. Draco shook his head vigorously.
He was so busy admiring the carved details of his new wardrobe that he didn't notice a figure entering the room.
It was so. good.
-“Harry, are you absolutely sure about this?”- Hermione asked cautiously.
-“It’s alright.”- Draco said, a lump forming on his throat.
Draco stood there for a bit, wondering why hadn't he ever been able to feel Harry's pain before. After all, they had spent six years together at Hogwarts.
He didn't saw that Draco had watched the entire scene.
He didn't cry.
impossible. He's my patient! That...that wouldn't be ethical."- Draco said.
-"I understood everything, thank you."- Harry said politely.
He told Ron and Hermione that it had been a pretty tiring day and that he just wanted to rest for a bit. It wasn’t a complete lie, he was tired.
Draco came out a few minutes later and Harry couldn't contain the gasp that escaped from his lips. He looked even paler than he usually did, his hair was disheveled, he had dark circles under his eyes and..-
Harry caressed his hair and started singing ever so softly,
-“I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it!”- Ron said angrily.
treated him kindly for once."- Narcissa mumbled through gritted teeth. Then, she turned to Harry with a sigh and a smile,
Harry shrugged
Draco stared at their hands.
-"Of course. I have to go now. Sit with me on the train?"- Harry nodded even though he had no idea what Draco was talking about. Draco grinned.
What mattered the most to both of them in that moment was that there they were, all over each other’s skin.
As usual, Draco was sitting at the edge of the tower.
Draco felt someone staring and along with his friend's comments, he couldn't help but blush.
-“We’re not done talking about this. But for now, rest up.”-
Harry snorted.
did Harry thought he was? He had betrayed his trust.
But Harry had felt something.
Draco's eyes were watering but he didn't let himself cry. Instead, he sighed.
His heart would break every time he burned a letter, but it was too dangerous to keep them.
-"You should've been there, Draco."- Lucius hissed.
Draco had changed a lot in a span of a few months.
He had apologised to Hermione personally and had let her punched him.
-“He’s changed. He really has.”-
-"Sorry, I couldn't help myself. I'll go now."- Harry sighed, unwrapping his arms from Draco. Draco turned to face him and gave him a peck on his lips.
He had the scars from Harry’s spell, but he also had other scars that he hadn’t made.
-"Enjoy your breakfast, I'll see you in Divination."-
Harry had done the right thing.
-“Considering his obliviousness, I’m gonna say Potter.”- Blaise teased.
-“Someone used an unforgivable again?”- Harry asked fearfully and Draco nodded.
-“I want to kill them all.”- Harry grunted, pulling himself away from Draco to grab a breath. He could hear Draco’s ragged breaths underneath him.
In any way, Harry hadn't noticed that he was the only one allowed to actually touch Draco without the blonde's consent (Draco would hex anyone who came anywhere near into his personal space in his mind. He wouldn't actually do it because he was scared of getting into trouble, but felt extremely uncomfortable and froze every time), whether it was holding hands, playful shoves, or arms linking. He hadn't noticed all of this until one January night, after leaving the Slytherin common room, he was confronted by none other than his best friend.
He needed to get up.
-"Grace us with your presence, Potter?"- Blaise asked amusedly. Harry grinned.
Draco had left, but both Ron and Hermione stared at Harry in disbelief.
So why the sudden change?
like me..?"- He said confusedly.
Harry was still staring at him though.
He wouldn't show it, obviously. It took a lot of observation from Harry's part to realise it.
-"Really? You'd do that for me?"- Harry asked excitedly. Draco nodded.
Harry was panting when he arrived to the Great Hall for dinner.
Up and down.
. His voice sounded in Harry's head.
-"I love my job. And I'm really thankful that people trust me despite everything. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad I didn't gave up."- Draco said with sparkling eyes,
-“Harry! Are you even listening?”- Hermione’s eyes travelled to the boy Harry was currently watching. Draco Malfoy. How convenient.
What the fuck was he supposed to do?
a Malfoy, an ex-death eater, and he.."-
Draco un-petrified the student and quietly made his way back to his dorm with Harry following close behind.
-“Any time.”- Harry whispered back, finally allowing himself to sit beside Draco, arms faintly brushing.
Bellatrix pulled him closer to Harry. So close that their noses were touching and Harry just needed to lean in slightly in order to kiss him like he had dreamed so many times before.
Where's the fire? What's the hurry about?
I’ll come back when it’s over
-"You asked me before why I can see the magical barriers. Well, it was a "special" gift from the Dark Lord when I succeeded in letting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. It's a wonderful ability, it really is. But I hate it. It reminds me of what I once was. Of what I will always be."-
He decided to go for a coffee at his favourite muggle coffee shop.
Draco and Luna had become really good friends and Harry took his chance one time when Draco was studying with Luna at the library.
-“You never know, you could even accidentally create an Obscurus inside of you because of all that suppressed magic.”-
-"P-Pansy!"- He gave his friend flustered glare and then turned to Harry,
-"Fair enough."- He said nevertheless, casting off the muffliato. Luna stepped forward and Draco grabbed her elbow, both of them making their way to Potions.
Harry let him go as soon as he made sure that Draco was safe.
-"Alright. Where the hell have you been?"- he told him once Harry arrived to their dorm. Ron was alone, apparently reading something until he had seen Harry.
No masks.
He had also took a punch from Ron for calling her that nasty name.
-"B-but I'll let you know as soon as I am. Alright?"- Draco said nervously. Harry smiled. That was enough for him.
-"I uh...thank you."- Harry said genuinely. Draco nodded.
He actually thought of how he felt. Of every moment he had shared with Draco. Sirius watched him through the mirror for a couple of minutes until Harry's eyes widened out in horror and realisation.
-“Potter.”- He nodded as a greeting sign, his sight never leaving the thestral he was petting.
At last, Draco nodded and firmly grabbed Harry’s hand. As if Harry was his anchor.
Draco leaned in closer and closer until he kissed him.
He didn’t even know why.
-"Oh?"-
Harry could only focus on his eyes and how pretty they were.
-“You’re falling asleep, Draco. Let’s get you to bed.”- Harry said gently when Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder for way too long.
Harry didn’t want him.
Harry shook his head.
-"Parkinson, Zabini."- a voice that Draco could recognise everywhere said.
-"We both know."-
-“Mother, did you made tea?”- He asked, the small shake in his voice subtly hidden by his serious tone.
Finally, Ron tore his gaze away from him and looked down.
-“I need to talk to him eventually, you know? About the trials and stuff.”- Harry lied.
He didn’t hate him per se. He had spoken in his favour during his trial after all, but he didn’t like him either.
He didn't knew much about Draco, but he found himself feeling more and more intrigued by the blonde with each session that passed.
-“Are
-"T-This is...it can't..can it?"- Draco muttered incoherently.
Actually, he wasn’t sleeping...at all.
From the distance, Harry was watching them. Unable to wait any longer, he stood up with his things and walked towards them.
This also seemed to be the limit for Draco, who screamed loudly:
-"Why do you ask?"-
. Draco reminded himself.
Sirius Black though, that was another story. Draco admired Sirius. He just couldn't believe how brave Sirius was, walking away from the Toujours-Pur-Blacks, coming out openly back then when he fell in love with Remus, and essentially being the person that Draco
He didn't scream.
-“Why wouldn’t be?”- Harry asked innocently.
Harry headed towards the Astronomy Tower and was actually surprised when he saw Draco dancing in the edge.
Draco and Harry kept on seeing each other a bit more often. Now they greeted each other in public and whenever they did, Harry would smile brightly and Draco would swing his arms back and forth, back and forth, back and forth happily.
He only allowed Zabini, Parkinson, and surprisingly, Luna to touch him.
And then, he discovered it. Well...half of it anyways.
-“Potter better kill the Dark Lord very fucking soon. I don’t know how much longer I can keep myself from hexing the life out of that arsehole.”- Blaise said, leaning in the doorframe.
-“What are you doing here? You shouldn’t be alone, you know? Could be dangerous.”- Harry told him casually. Draco raised a pale brow but didn’t look in Harry’s way.
Harry didn't even think about it. He kissed Draco softly, with so much care and affection, that Draco felt safe for the first time in a long time. After that incident, Harry did his investigation in silence and boy, did it paid in the end.
-"Won't they be mad that you ditched them?"-
The memories, the touches, the faces...they were all too much. Draco shifted into a fetal position and starting rocking himself back and forth, tears falling down freely.
Much less for that place.
Not that he was going to tell anyone though. Pansy could and would hex the life out of him if someone else found out.
-“It happens to me too whenever I’m too angry.”- Harry whispered, looking at his hands because he couldn’t hold Draco’s unreadable gaze.
-"Still, I felt responsible for him. I
Anything.
-“Good. Granger and the Weasleys did a good job.”- Draco admitted in a carefree manner.
-“It’s a reminder. He’s always there with you.”- Two other names appeared above other two butterflies,
-"Indeed."-
Harry smiled.
-"What happened back there?"- Harry asked, once Draco had calmed down and Harry had given him a cup of tea.
Draco found out that he didn’t mind when Harry’s arm brushed his.
As if he wanted to grab Harry’s hand.
Minerva McGonagall came along with Ron, Hermione, Luna, and professor Flitwick.
Draco hugged him and Harry hugged back.
everyone's pain in his dreams. It physically hurts him. Just like your negative feelings do."- Pansy explained, chugging the rest of her butterbeer.
-"I...don't know how or why but I can
Well, there goes nothing.
-“Oh..”- Draco said, biting his lower lip. Harry was staring at him the way he stared at Harry every day.
-"You're not."- Harry noted.
-"So, I guess that's it for today. Do you have any questions regarding your treatment and the process that we'll be following?"- Draco asked. Harry shook his head.
-"There aren't a lot of options for death eaters, Potter."-
Hence to why she was chanting
-“Course not! I need a break from Ron’s snores anyway. He always forgets to cast the silencing charm.”- Harry said with a laugh.
-"Harry."-
She was suppressing her anger, Draco assumed. He just didn't understand why would she be angry. He deserved it.
-“You blithering idiot! I couldn’t care less about you. You left Draco!”- Harry paled.
-"Well, go on then. Keep on walking."- Draco dismissed.
Harry melted but the back of his brain was screaming angry warning because how dared they treat Draco like that.
-"No. He's not Harry Potter."-
He didn't mind though.
-“Nothing’s wrong, okay!?”- Harry exploded, fidgeting with his fingers.
Slowly (painfully slowly) but surely, Draco acknowledged Harry with a brief nod. It was almost imperceptible.
Potter might have not notice, because he was absolutely oblivious, but Draco noticed that although McGonagall's voice was firm and apparently calm, there was a light shake in it.
-“You’re what!?”- Ron exclaimed offended.
-"Are you sure?"- Draco asked with genuine surprise.
-"Is this seat taken?"- Harry asked, pointing at the seat in front of him. Draco looked up from his notebook to Harry and shook his head. Harry sat down and took out his things to work.
-"Good game, Weasley."- He said, smiling a bit. Ron blushed and shook his hand.
-“How..How have you been?”- Harry asked Draco awkwardly.
-"Lucius!"- Narcissa hissed and then turned to Draco,
-"Welcome back."-
-“Ten minutes, Potter. That’s the most I can do. He needs to rest.”- She left them alone.
That you won’t..d-die.”- Harry’s voice sounded like an echo. He was yelling something but Draco couldn’t hear him anymore.
-“Malfoy! Where are you!?”- someone yelled. Draco’s expression went from calm into horrified.
-"He'll be back in a week."- Zabini revealed quietly, staring at his goblet.
-"Draco."- Harry breathed. Draco turned around and Harry gasped. In the moonlight, Harry could see Draco's eyebags and sunken eyes. Harry realised that all this time, Draco had glamoured them.
Harry blushed.
He would never admit that though.
He had
."- Blaise told Draco, but Draco did not move from his bed.
No more words were exchanged for the rest of the ride, leaving Harry very confused.
-“May I kiss you?”- Harry asked, making Draco blush.
-“It’s fine, Harry.”- Draco whispered, fidgeting with his hands,
-"Yeah. It's been quite a difficult year so far, but
-“You need to go. You’re gonna miss the first dance.”- Draco told him, reluctantly pulling away from him.
-"I presume you have learned your lesson."- Lucius commented offhandedly. Draco nodded.
But they sat in a comfortable silence, shifting positions so that they could watch the moon. They stayed there until Draco got up and went back to his room.
-“I know.”- Harry whispered.
He knew that Draco was spending more and more time in the Astronomy Tower, which scared Harry.
Trois moins un sous le M
-"I should thank you, then? It wasn't your secret to tell."- Draco told him. Harry's temper was rising. He only tried to help. Draco could felt his anger and flinched a bit. He didn't like how it felt when Haryy was angry.
Harry casted a Muffliato before saying,
-"Draco I.."- Draco had shook his head repeatedly, interrupting Harry by hugging him. Harry hugged him back tightly.
-"Where are you taking me?"- Draco asked suspiciously. Harry giggled but said nothing. They arrived to the Headmistress' office and Harry said the password.
Dinner started, and while the situation was soon forgotten because of the food, a tiny smile made its way to Draco’s face when he thought Harry wasn’t looking.
He wanted to vomit.
Maybe he really was and Harry hadn't noticed before.
-"What am I feeling right now!?"- Harry asked excitedly, grabbing Draco's hands.
Draco had now heterochromia iridum as a result of the hex. His right eye was still stormy grey, but his left iris was now tinted with a pretty shade of violet.
He returned with a bag full of sweets, only to be scolded by none other than Pansy Parkinson.
Harry turned to face Draco and automatically rested his face against Draco's chest.
Draco nodded and Harry wasted no time.
After Harry had seen everyone grieving over dead bodies and couldn't help but think he was one too.
-“Sing another song?”- Harry requested.
Harry wasn't allowed to see Draco either and that just pissed him off even more. Draco was only allowed to come downstairs to eat after both Narcissa and Harry had finished their business downstairs.
-“You’re chaotic!”- Draco laughed when Harry’s glasses fell on his face.
-"Uh, thanks?"- Harry said, uncertainly. Draco looked at him for a moment before nodding in response, leaving Harry intrigued as to how a person could change so much in such a little time.
Harry smiled.
-“Malfoy.”- Both Ron and Hermione greeted at the same time and then laughed.
-“Mate, these rumours about you are crazy! You protecting Malfoy? Really?”- Ron snorted as he grabbed another piece of chicken.
-"Happy."- Harry said without skipping a beat,
More importantly, he couldn't
-"You do? You don't think it's stupid?"-
Harry made it his mission to bring Lucius down the moment he entered Draco's room on the last day before going back to Hogwarts when Lucius was just leaving it. Draco was crying hard, his lips were swollen, his hair was a mess, and his robes were torn.
Harry’s mind swirled thinking of where Draco could be. He literally could be anywhere.
Harry stood in his room slightly confused. One minute Draco was a nightmare and the next he was being civil.
Harry forgot.
He unconsciously shook his head quickly, but it was like a shudder. Somewhat like a tic but not quite.
He felt the warm breeze on his cheeks and inhaled deeply.
Draco wouldn’t let anyone touch him. No one knew why or what had happened after the war, but Draco came back to his eighth year completely changed.
-“Alright, but if he makes any sign of harm or sudden movement, I’ll hex the life out of the git.”- Ron threatened.
-“Harry!”- Hermione yelled, pointing a blond figure lying on the ground.
He deserved it.
-“Draco, someone needs to treat your injuries.”- Blaise said gently, kneeling in front of Draco.
Harry was by his side immediately.
Harry crouched down and started whispering soothing words to Draco. Harry’s mere presence was soothing enough, and Draco found himself feeling infatuated by the Golden Boy in the best way possible.
Harry smiled.
-“Is your head full of nargles again?”- Luna had asked. Draco had rolled his eyes, the faintest hint of a smile gracing his mouth.
-"Anytime."- Harry smiled, but Draco shook his head.
Draco liked touching things. He liked feeling different textures. It soothed him.
-"Why's that?"-
-"Ah, the young love."- Blaise sighed.
-"Merlin....Merlin! This is madness. This is absolutely bonkers!"- Harry exclaimed all panicky. Sirius laughed harder.
-“Are you alright?”- Harry asked frantically on top of Draco, looking for any sign of injury. He slowly pulled his hands away from Draco’s head so that his head was resting on the floor and he took off the cloak so that Draco could see him.
-"No need, I was just about to head out. Wasn't I,
The unexpected happened the moment Harry decided to hug Draco: Draco started crying and shaking.
-"You know, I feel like you're feeding me on purpose."-
-"They're not lame!"-
-"Don't remind me. I already feel bad about it!"- Draco sighed and hid his face on his hands.
He offered her a small smile and she smiled back before walking back to the kitchen.
A week after that, their relationship shifted again. They weren’t dating, but there were stolen kisses, midnight picnics, hands holding, hugs in Draco’s bed, and those ridiculous names that Harry hated (not really).
-"Give him a break 'Mione. I would be worried too if it were you."- He had given her a knowing look and Hermione had shut up after that.
-"You don't go out on coffee dates with your patients."- Blaise pointed out.
-“I’m going to tell you something but you have to promise that you won’t freak out.”- Harry warned. Ron stared at him with the most stern expression and then he said:
