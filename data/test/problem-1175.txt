Behind the shining portrait of Jesus Christ was a mafia backroom that put all of Hollywood's depictions to shame. Plush velvet sofas were strewn around the soft carpeted room, and on each of the walls hung endless displays of forbidden luxury: they were surrounded by priceless antiques and surely-stolen artwork, blades still stained with blood and guns so meticulously ornate that if they were pressed to your skull you'd think of Michelangelo before you thought of God. The physical was only the tip of the iceberg, though; the entire room thrummed with power, so much so that Harry could swear that the ground was shaking beneath her boots.
Harry wrapped her hand around her willstone and closed her eyes, gathering up every ounce of black hatred present in her body. She thought of her parents, their lifeless bodies dripping crimson nightmares onto the sheets of a bed that had previously been her sole refuge. She thought of the youthful ruddiness of her mother’s cheeks, of the bright sound of her father’s laughter; they were so
The thing about Harry and being afriad was that she just didn’t give a fuck— she wasn’t scared of death or heights or spiders or God —after what happened, her body had evolved so that fear was a chemical formula that just couldn’t be registered by the enzymes of her brain. 65% water, bones wrapped in nerves and muscles and blood and skin, ugly thoughts that kept them up at night and a heart that was never taught to work just right, those were the things that made a man. So how could Harry be scared of Sirius Black, when all of those things lived inside of her, too?
The thing about Draco Malfoy, Harry thought, was that she had a face like shattered glass. In her she saw her filthiest vices and her purest virtues, the things she smoked when she wanted to forget and the things she held onto when she needed to remember. She was a serpent through and through, and had somehow managed to build a home for herself behind Harry’s shaking ribs and right next to her heart: a brilliant vantage point, if one ever thought to strike.
Harry looked to her right, and felt her heart twist inside her chest as she watched a little girl curl up in her mother’s lap, wide eyes blinking blearily as she did her best to fight off sleep. Harry looked to her left, and felt her heart twist yet again as she saw Draco Malfoy, wide eyes as distant and empty as they’d ever been.
“No, you’re not,” Draco replied, wiping the back of her hand across her face, a streak of red painting her cheek, “But you’re brilliant at pretending you are.”
Lucius Malfoy died like the animal he was: loudly, with blood oozing out of every hole. One last twitch, a guttural moan, then finally, silence. Harry was filled with a warm satisfaction; whoever said revenge was for the weak had never felt what Harry had, couldn’t possibly begin to understand the raw power coursing through her veins. Then she looked down, and realized that the warmth wasn’t just her own morbid sense of fulfilment— it was blood, dripping scarlet down her shirt, trickling over her bare stomach.
After breakfast, they cleared the table and spread out all of Hermione’s journals instead— which was a lot, to say the least. Harry was kind of baffled to find out that someone else had been researching the Godric Hollow murders as intensely and obsessively as she had, but for the most part, she was just grateful that she didn’t have to go through it all alone. After roughly an hour and a half, they’d gathered that they were roughly on the same page: the Iraqi government was possibly involved, the Blacks were probably involved, and the Malfoys were
Nothing that came after mattered much, as far as Harry was concerned. Because while it was only James and Lily Potter who were murdered on October 31st, 1986, it was Harry’s heart that was buried with them.
At that moment, Harry was all the way in 1960s America. She imagined she’d ran away from her small rural town, dissatisfied with the wearying expectations thrust upon a colored woman such as herself, and starving for just the tiniest taste of something real. She had no plan whatsoever— she was tired of the restraints, and craved true spontaneity— in all honesty, she’d probably end up getting murdered by one serial killer or the other. Harry wondered what exactly it said about her that all her happiest fantasies ended up with her dead in a ditch, somewhere far, far away.
“Why don’t I have one?” Harry asked, curling her knuckles against the edge of the tub as Hermione poured antiseptic over her wound.
February 1st, 2003 marked exactly one month since Harry Potter had last felt her heart beating inside her chest. She wasn’t dead just yet— she wasn’t
But she knew exactly why, and she was deadly afraid that everyone did too, that they could all see right through her. She didn’t deserve the life she’d been given— whichever part of the universe decided her miserable life was anywhere near equivalent to James & Lily’s must have been horribly malfunctioning. How could she ever deserve to be happy, when they’d been six feet under for seventeen years now, while the men who killed them drank their scotch and loved their wives as Sirius rotted in a dark, filthy prison cell in their place? So yeah, Harry wasn’t very happy; not yet, at least.
She wondered what type of long-buried tragedy it was that made him choose a life like this. Working for the MI6 wasn’t something you sought out or applied for; it was something that just happened to you, and then one day you’d wake up and ask yourself when exactly it was that you decided that this was how you wanted to define the word
that morning. All she knew was that it smelled like cardamom and honey and the air was cool on her burning skin. The sky-blue, Moroccan-tiled walls were far far away and finally, she had some room to fucking
obsessive.” She took a step forward, so there was barely a foot of space between them, and brought her tiny, ringless hand up to Harry’s sternum. She let it hover over her willstone, hanging by a thin golden chain, and Harry stopped breathing altogether, intoxicated with anticipation. “It’s quite strange, haven’t you noticed?”
“Yes, yes, will do sir… you take care of yourself, now, sir, we need another heir out of you!” Thicknesse laughed awkwardly, slowly snaking out of his boss’ presence in the hope of snorting a couple more lines before sunrise.
“I wouldn’t fuck you if you were the last woman alive, Malfoy.” Harry avowed, but the fire in her eyes said otherwise.
“Say hello to your mother for me, Ronald,” Sirius said, finally, as he grabbed some powder off the mantle and tossed it into the fireplace, turning it a blazing green, “Tell her Remus and I are still on for Sunday brunch, if she is.” And with that, Sirius Black brushed off his suit, stepped into the fireplace, and disappeared once again.
She then spent three days and three nights going through every single piece of physical evidence that James and Lily Potter had left behind. She knew her mother had been an artist, could still recall the warm summer days she spent sitting in her mother’s lap as she painted canvas after canvas, and when she eventually ran out of those, the walls of every room she could. It was sitting in those very rooms, enveloped in swirling colors and dreamy lines, that Harry learned that even ghosts could love you, and that sometimes, there wasn’t much to do but love them back.
It was after several bouts of hysteria and senseless banging that Harry lay her hands flat against the well-worn leather of the chest and whispered, eyelids fluttering like baby butterfly wings and heart stuck in her throat, “I promise to protect you.”
Normally, Harry held back from the burning urge to admire, but right now, it was simply impossible to resist. He shone even brighter amongst the beasts and the bastards; pure and good, a true golden boy. She took a moment to admire the firm movements of his back through his white t-shirt, tucked safely into well-fitted black slacks. Then she took another for the soft hairs curling by the nape of his neck and the quiet glow of his ebony rosary beads, shined to perfection with a thousand silent prayers on missions just about to go wrong. He was nothing like the slimy, parasitical men that surrounded him; he positively glowed with power, an energy only given to those who God knows would never even think to misuse it.
“So if I’m… magic, too, then why am I so sensitive to them? Everytime I’m in a room with more than two willstones, I get nauseous.” Harry asked, drawing in a breath as Hermione ran her hand across the wound, muttering in a far away language, her willstone glowing in the hollow of her throat. Harry could feel her skin knit itself back together beneath her palms— it was a strangely satisfying feeling.
“Yes, Potter, I think we’ve already established that you want to shag me,” Draco smirked, swirling the glass in her hand so that the ice cubes clinked together, softly. She looked
You see, Harry had dedicated the better part of the past ten years to researching the Blacks’ criminal empire, and she knew that Draco was both blade and key when it came to dismantling the whole goddamn thing. She was the sole heiress to both Black Scotch, the UK’s largest producer of Scottish whiskey and distributor of illegal drugs, and Malfoy Enterprises, the world’s largest private oil company and main suspect in a chain of illicit arms deals all over Europe and the Middle East. Draco Malfoy was a three-sided coin, and Harry had no fucking idea how she was going to land.
But she didn’t mean that— nothing about Draco was even remotely filthy. She was spotless, every arch and bow in her face precisely drawn and every movement of her body strictly calculated, a macabre version of a prima ballerina. When Harry looked at Draco, she saw equal parts wolf and snake, and she wondered which side would win.
The other thing Harry loved about Edinurgh’s people, though, was just how easy they were to exploit; for a city that’d been captured twenty three bloody times, you’d think maybe they’d stop being so trusting. So when Harry first found out she’d been stationed in rainy old Scotland, she was pretty damn happy about it. For one, that night’s mission was relatively easy: gather intel from the bartender with the ugliest snake tattoo in the room. He had been a low-level serpent, recently excommunicated— he was too rich to be killed, but not rich enough to be forgiven; it was something about being somewhere he wasn’t meant to be, or shagging someone he shouldn’t have shagged. On any other day, a mission like this would’ve been an absolute piece of cake for Harry; the past couple of years had made her exceptionally good at cozying up to pretty strangers in dark rooms. Tonight, though, seemed to be a slightly different story— she just couldn’t seem to get last night out of her head. Oh, and that right there was another perk— there was absolutely no way she’d run into Draco Malfoy here.
“Why’d you save me, you beautiful fool?” She heard a voice sob, somewhere far, far away. She saw Draco, kneeling above her, tears streaming relentlessly down her hollow cheeks. She was pushing down on Harry’s wound, begging,
She thought of Sirius, drenched in blood and crumbling by the second, and Remus, tearing the hair out of his skull and begging, begging, begging. She thought of the way Remus’ sweaters were alway much too big, and how even now, Sirius’ eyes remained hollow and dull. The harder she focused, the larger this feeling inside of her grew, this swirling blackness, this raw, undefinable power. She felt her feet slowly lift off the ground, her body propelled by a force that was at once benevolent and also rightfully
“I like your hair better curly, you know,” Draco said, voice low and matter-of-fact. She reached out, slowly, and tugged softly at a lone curl, watched it stretch beneath her fingertips and spring back up upon release, eyes lit up in utter delight at just how much her nonchalance was pissing Harry off. Harry clenched her teeth but did nothing, even more pissed off because she liked it better curly, too. Suddenly, she was wondering if maybe she should relax it, or shave it all off again. “For next time.”
The other part of the uneasy feeling swirling in Harry’s untouched champagne glass was something she couldn’t quite explain with words: an anxious buzz of energy floating through the air. It was raw power, the likes of which she had only encountered twice before: what was presented to her the day Cedric died, and what began to grow within her the day her parents did. Deep down, she knew exactly what it was: five letters that held so much more than a single word ever should. But Harry wasn’t insane, and she wouldn’t have anyone else believing so either, so she pushed her worry down to the pit of her stomach and decided to focus on a more pressing matter instead. So, she opened the bathroom door.
She knew all the documents they couldn’t burn but didn’t want anyone to find were kept here, in this dull, barren warehouse, hidden amongst the achingly mundane. But she couldn’t find a single thing to tie Lea to the Notts; there was no birth certificate, no vaccine card, no school registration form. Nott hadn’t just covered his tracks— he'd buried them, and he’d buried them well.
deserve. And what is a woman to do, when so honestly presented with all the grime and glory of death, but to beg for one final dose of cosmic morphine?
“That,” the red haired girl replied, and Harry noted that this was the first time she’d spoken; her voice hadn’t been among those screaming earlier. She pointed to the dark-skinned girl, whose hair had grown even bigger from all the nervous raking it had endured, “is Hermione Granger. She’s had an unhealthy obsession with the Godric Hollow murders since before most of us even learned to read, and is the self-appointed President of Everything. Although, to be fair, she’s more than capable.”
around others, and it almost put her on edge, as if it was all just a hyper-detailed fever dream and she was bound to wake up at any moment, disoriented and alone.
Harry turned her attention to Draco, who was sitting cross-legged, elbow resting on her knee and head placed casually in her gentle palm, seemingly collected despite her bloodshot eyes. Harry made a point of staring directly there, and not anywhere below. “If Sirius didn’t kill my parents, then who did?”
Gone were the flickering flames of youth, but in their place was a roaring, steady fire, burning beneath her skin and glowing through the smoke colored stone hanging around her neck.
“In another universe, this is our first date,” Someone said, tone sweet as honeyed wine. She didn’t have to guess— she’d know that voice anywhere. Harry looked up, and Draco was seated right across from her, just as effortlessly stunning as when she’d seen her last. It should’ve pissed her off, the way Draco held her beauty like a knife in her hand, but she couldn’t help but respect it instead. Too many pretty girls thought they were ugly, and Harry had had enough of stupid, powerless girls. Draco dropped a second straw into the melting strawberry milkshake, and took a long sip, raising an eyebrow at Harry.
“You reckon she’s fine, yeah? Yeah?” Ron asked, chewing tirelessly at his bottom lip; Hermione was meant to be back from her recon almost 30 minutes ago, and Ron’s leg hadn’t stopped bouncing since.
“Why do you care, Draco?” Her name in Harry’s mouth was as sharp as a weapon, as ugly as a snare; I know your vulnerabilities, she screamed, and I will not hesitate to use them against you. “Isn’t daddy disowning you, anyway?”
She reached up to her willstone, trying to feel any magical connection to the place; she’d been able to do that, lately, at historical sites. She remembered Hermione telling her it had something to do with heritage magic, how historical sites she was ethnically connected to could somehow enhance her power, how spells spoken in her mother tongue could be up to ten times as powerful. She didn’t really understand how it worked, but then again, she hadn’t been understanding much of anything lately.
“Soft, pretty magic,” Draco whispered, staring at the ground, and the vulnerability in her words was so out of character Harry had to pinch herself to make sure it was real. She looked up, and her eyes were light and glassy. “That’s all I can do now…”
“In another universe,” she began, her voice soft as daisies and just barely louder than a whisper, the dim lights casting shadows on her weather-worn skin, “My daddy never killed yours. You grew up loved, wanted, in a house that was yours and with a family that would die for you. You’d spend summers in Baghdad, where your biggest problems would be making sure to pronounce your vowels right and bring enough sweets to the neighbour’s door on holidays. You’d take awkward pictures before senior prom, have a little black dog that’d follow you wherever you went, cry on the last day of sixth form because you just realized how much you’d actually miss that crappy old town. You’d live a normal, happy life, uninterrupted by neither senseless violence nor fatal misunderstandings. Then you’d go to uni, and everything you thought you knew would be snatched from beneath your feet.
it. And yet despite that, Harry couldn’t trace a single violent crime back to her in five whole years; she was sure there had to be
“In an alternate universe, you’d be here as my date,” Draco said, but this time, there was no humour in her voice; only softness. She could feel her words twist like smoke, hook into her lungs and pull her impossibly closer. Every cigarette she’d ever smoked, every shot she’d ever taken, every bullet she’d ever fired, were all nothing in comparison to this, this heady rush, this pure, sweet cocktail of chemicals swirling through her bloodstream.
“No,” Draco smirked, eyes gleaming. When she spoke, they all listened; she was both judge and jury, both choir and conductor. She revelled in the attention, glowed golden beneath the scrutiny. “I think it’s all us.”
Draco let her storm-colored eyes pour into Harry’s, rain in a twisted forest. In her dilated pupils Harry saw the answer to every question she’d ever asked, the key to every locked door in her mind. She could
She could tell where they came from, how old their money was, if they had it at all. She could tell if a man was armed by the raise of his eyebrows, could weed out a spy by the way the light shone through her eyes. When you grow up the way Harry Potter had to, you waste no time coming to the realization that pretty distractions are an unaffordable tax when the price was staying alive.
No matter how many years passed, Harry could never seem to outgrow the childlike sense of wonder that filled her everytime she set foot in a church. She wouldn’t say she was particularly devout— in fact, she had a lot of things to say to God, and most of them were rather unpleasant— but there was something about the grand, undeniable beauty of it all that captivated her, and St. Paul’s Cathedral was as grand and beautiful as churches came. Gilded ivory pillars held up a domed ceiling towering so far above her head that its painted angels might as well have been genuine, and the low-hanging chandeliers cast a warm glow over the vast space, being the only source of illumination besides the twinkling fairy lights strung around two massive evergreens, all decked out in holly and pine.
For as long as she could remember, Harry had been fascinated by sunrises. She could never quite contain the awe she felt as the sky smeared itself in shades of orange-pink, the sun crawling away from the horizon in impercentable fractions. A part of her knew that the real reason was that she knew just how much could change between one sunrise and the next. Early morning had become somewhat of a sacred time for her, and being so close to home, surrounded by tangible bits of history that seemed to thrum with an ancient sort of energy, only served to ampliphy that feeling.
” a voice as soft as spring sun drifted through the room, wrapping itself around Harry’s limbs and gently pulling her forward. On a small, parqueted stage were three alternate versions of the same girl: to the left, a brown-skinned girl with big, curly hair wore a dress as red as her lips and broke her violin’s heart with every stroke of her bow; to the right, a freckled girl with flaming red hair wore a dress as green as her eyes and caressed the keys of her piano as if this was the only way she knew how to love; nestled between the both of them, a girl with skin like moonlight and hair like the sun wore a pitch-black dress as velvety as the voice escaping her, blue eyes staring directly into Harry’s green. “
Remus had screamed, tearing his hair out of his own skull as two officers pulled him away by the arms,
As she strode through the dimly lit halls, she couldn’t help but replay the last couple of days in her memory: the party, the Burrow, Hermione, Sirius, Draco. She’d woken up in the bathtub— no one could move her, not even Ginny— with a sore neck and even more questions to ask. She demanded to be bonded immediately, and lucky for her, the Weasleys happened to have a patch of willstones in their backyard, fresh for the picking just in case another one decided to pop out. Hermione insisted on giving her a rundown of everything she wasn’t allowed to do, first— the Dark Arts, blood magic, and the Unforgivable Curses. The ritual itself was strange, but not too difficult; a fire, some chanting, an oath, some pain— nothing Harry hadn’t encountered before. She picked the stone out herself: a bloodstone, emerald green and flecked in scarlet, smooth and pretty as a dragon’s egg. Speaking of dragons— she thought of Draco, who had slipped away sometime in the early morning, without a single trace; even the throw-pillows were perfectly in place.
The other two followed shortly afterwards, and then there were six people standing in one bathroom, each more powerful than the next. The air was thick and thrumming with energy, and Harry just couldn’t fucking take it. The last thing she thought before she blacked out was that it was about time she got a pretty stone necklace, too.
“You’ve got to let us help you, Harry,” Hermione insisted, lips pursed and eyebrows stern, “If you let yourself bleed out any longer, you’ll end up dying of either dehydration or infection, or both.”
the Black and Malfoy crime syndicates were joint, but no one would believe her; in fact, most didn’t even believe a Malfoy crime empire
. Sure, it was at best a watered-down version of what she truly craved, but what didn’t feel faded and dull in comparison to the endless fields of her memory, to the unparalleled euphoria of a childhood romanticized by the soft caress of ever-expanding distance and time? Because the truth was that Harry didn’t want present-day Baghdad; Fady and Yasmina Potter were long gone, and Harry had nothing left for her in those winding streets that couldn’t be accessed with a little bit of mopey reminiscence.
“I’m sure she is, mate,” Harry said, trying her best to be reassuring. She wasn’t used to dealing with other people’s emotions, and with Ron, there tended to be a whole lot of them, “She’s more capable than both of us combined. She’ll be fine, yeah?”
Harry yelled, and blinding green light filled every inch of her eyesight, seeping out of her soul, a final thunderstorm.
They weren’t alone. Lucius Malfoy stood with his hands folded behind his back, and Harry didn’t need to see his face to know that it was likely impassive, observing, as ugly as it had ever been. Narcissa was there too, but she seemed shrunken, almost wilting, a voiceless shell of a woman. Harry got as close as she could as quietly as she could, and noticed that Flint was shaking violently; he didn’t want to do this, Harry realized. He was stalling. She was 10 feet away when she noticed shards of grey scattered across the marble floors.
Harry took another puff of her cigarette, let the peppermint and nicotine swirl around in her brain and run through her gushing blood. “Where did you take me?” She sent out another jolt of pain, a quick reassertion of her power, “If any of you lie, you all die.”
Lucius Malfoy spent all of New Year’s Eve hiding in the shadows of his own home; or that’s what it felt like to him, at least, since that useless excuse for a double agent was taking ages to show up. He could feel the night weighing down upon him, sinking into the soreness of his bones and heaving through his lungs as he coughed, dry and tinged with blood; he couldn’t wait much longer. Lucius adjusted the lapels of his suit jacket and glanced at the watch glittering on his wrist: it was 11:55 PM, already. Just as he was about to walk away, a shadow crept up the stairs.
“Because there are a million universes where you get to be happy, Harry. There are none for me.” And then she got up and walked away, church bells chiming in her wake.
Millie pinched his cheek, and Harry threw up inside her mouth, “Meen kan momken ekhamin ena malaakna Cedric hayetla’ alil adab heyk?”
“Ginevra Molly Weasley,” she continued, pointing at herself and grinning widely, “Also known as Ginny. I’m only here because I like beating people up.” That got a snort out of Harry, and she slightly relaxed her grip, earning a collective “oomf” from everyone in the room.
“The Burrow,” the ginger boy said; Rob, or Rock, or something like that. He seemed to be the only one home, his eyes still bleary with sleep and his scarred torso covered in freckles. There was a nagging feeling in a faraway back alley of her brain that insisted that it was safe to trust him, that in another universe, she knew him inside out. Harry shut that part off from the rest of her gushing thoughts and focused on the pain instead. When he spoke again, there was no fear, no rush— as if he knew exactly how to calm her down. “We’re in Devon, just by St. Catchpole. No idea why you’re in my house or how you knew to come here. Or who the fuck you are, really, but hey, not the weirdest thing to come out of this lot.”
because deep down, we’d be afraid the whole thing was too good to be true, that it would always be more dream than reality.”
“Think you’re mighty cool, eh?” Remus replied, grin barely contained as he swung the little girl up into the air while she desperately clutched onto the long pointed witch hat she refused to take off. “Too cool for little old Moony, hmm?”
And you overestimate me, Harry Potter.” Draco replied, pulling her straw out of the drink and swiping it across Harry’s cheek, dripping pink sugar down her slackened jaw. “I’m just here to have some fun.”
But for now, she was okay with just sitting here, in this pretty 60s themed diner with it's black & white checkerboard floors and the quirky license plates hung up on the walls and the jukebox in the corner playing a constant loop of Beatles classics, John Lennon’s mystic words floating through the hazy mid-afternoon air.
The last thing Harry remembered before she blacked out was Draco laying flat on the ground, lifting her palm, and whispering “
“No, I promise—” She attempted between fits of giggles, trying her best to climb up onto his shoulders and extend a hand down for him to shake, “I’ll give you a chocolate if you run me to the house?”
“Harry, you don’t have to—” Hermione started, but Harry slammed her jaw shut with a wave of her hand.
“The longer we spend apart, the brighter this thing inside of you burns.” Draco replied, and Harry was confused, for a split second, before the recognition settled in. Suddenly, it was 6 years ago, in the backroom of a memory she’d do anything to forget.
Harry realized, and a feeling both oddly vivacious and entirely familiar fired up inside of her. Draco might have been a dead man, but Harry wasn’t, and she would
“I was taking a walk.” Harry spit out, and Draco pushed the gun against the side of her skull until her face tilted with the force of it.
Despite all her preparation, something felt off about the night of December 31st, 2002. Part of it was the simple fact that Harry
She asked, but there was no malice in her eyes when she looked at Harry, so she smiled and pretended she didn’t understand a word. Between her shaved head and her icy green eyes, Harry wasn’t very surprised that she didn’t pass much for an Arab.
Harry let her eyelids flutter shut, felt the warmth of Draco’s breath against her parted lips. “Oh, for fuck’s sake, won’t you kiss me you absolute—”
Harry cringed internally; Michael Zabini was rather well known for his homophobic rampages. She said nothing, though; she didn’t know why Draco was helping her (she almost didn’t want to), but what she did know was that she didn’t trust it, not one bit.
person; she refused to let herself become her father. She was drowning in guilt as it was; there was no way she could carry the weight of an innocent life atop her own. So naturally, pain was the only answer; hurting herself was one of her finest skills, after all.
She knew that for her, there was no choice; there was the horrors at night and there was this during the day, and that was that.
“Home won’t ever leave us alone, will it?” Cedric asked lightly, glancing over his shoulder to smile knowingly at her. It scared her, just how easily this boy, with his messy, sun-streaked hair and his perpetually twinkling eyes, could read her. Almost like he could sense her emotions before she even had the chance to.
“You’re a constant in my life, despite all the fucked up shit you say, all the tragedies you stand by and simply let happen. But in a way, you never asked for any of it, did you?”
“Well, time to move this one, then,” Ginny decided, and carried her bridal style to the couch, then set her down gently. Harry wondered why they were being so good to Draco, if they really were on her side. Maybe they were just good people— Maybe they knew what it was like, to be a little kid caught up in something much more sinister than yourself.
, like she’d split at the seams at the slightest attempt at unravelling. Seeing her so open made Harry feel weirdly warm, like honeyed tea after coming in from the rain or hot chocolate on Christmas morning.
Draco tossed a pack of Dunhills across the floor, followed shortly by a box of matches. Harry struck one, lit, inhaled, exhaled. The swirling smoke distorted her features into something closer to how she felt inside: rotten and sinister, shrouded in the shame of compulsion.
For the first time in 15 years, there were no physical or social barriers keeping Harry from beating the shit out of Sirius Black, and Harry loved beating the shit out of people. So she pounced, heard the sound of his skull reverberating against the floor, gathered every ounce of boiling, dirty hatred and missed childhood memories into her fists and let go.
“Prison,” Millie interrupted, just as Cedric said, “—boarding school.” Harry’s laugh was near genuine, and when her handshake was rejected for a kiss, she felt her insides twist at how little like a mission this had all begun to seem. She knew she had to stay focused, tear her mind away from these senseless sentimentalities, but between the smell of apple hookah and the twelve years she’d spent away from home, she just couldn’t bear to.
“We did,” Draco replied, the corners of her lips pulling upwards, teasing. Harry focused on the energy in the room and twisted, pulling from the pain pooled in her belly and pushing it all out. The others grunted in discomfort, but Draco only smiled wider. She was a serpent, and serpents thrived in agony. “Then we framed Sirius, because he’s a filthy scumsucker and always has been. Well, it’s not exactly
She’d arrived at Godric’s Hollow just before the strike of midnight on Christmas Eve, and couldn’t help but think about how fitting the name was for a place like this. It was entirely untouched and hollow of anything with a soul; even the marigolds in the back garden had wilted and blown away a long, long time ago. The floor creaked uneasily beneath her feet, but Harry found that ultimately, this house accepted her.
While her memories of the time were more likely to be whimsical fantasy than fact, there wasn’t much Harry could do to forget the five summers she spent running barefoot through the alleyways of Baghdad, chasing kids who called her Haya instead of Harry and knew nothing better of England than to ask if she’d had tea with the queen yet, or if it was really true that in the west, every man got a Mercedes and every boy got to be David Beckham. While she tried to figure out the best way to tell her friends that she lived in West Country, not heaven, James and Lily sat a safe distance away in her grandmother’s cafe, sharing milkshakes and rolled cigarettes and talking politics with everyone and anyone who would care to listen. So no, this sleazy little wannabe speakeasy did not intimidate her, nor did the beady-eyed men in it; she had her fair share of experiences with Bad, Bad Men, the type who would make these bastards look like little boys in school blazers.
resounding through the room. Everyone froze for a second, then two, as if anticipating the oncoming avalanche, deeply concerned yet powerless to stop it. Then, Harry was being slammed into the ground, wrists held firmly above her head.
He leaned forward and looked up at her expectantly until she rolled her eyes and kissed him three times; twice on the left and once on the right.
“You’d run into me, somewhere warm and non-discreet— outside a lecture we were both late to, in the bathroom of a party neither of us really wanted to be at, or in the library at 3 AM, high on no-sleep and caffeine and especially prone to making very bad decisions. We’d become friends quickly, despite our differences— in a softer light, it’d be very easy to see that those were all merely surface-level. We’d stay that way for a while, despite the fact that we both wanted more.
, could feel her legs walk her right up to the table and sit her down as her partner swapped Arabic for English for French, could sense his absence from the room when he left with Theadora to a backroom of victims (conveniently connected to an alleyway exit, where all their men were waiting), and was just distracted enough not to care that she was making him do all the actual work. Because right where Jesus’ final meal should’ve been, perched silently on Lebanese mafia boss Theodora Nott’s lap had been Draco Malfoy, the most dangerous woman alive.
“There’s an old wives tale,” Draco said as she leaned into Harry, her voice low and smooth as skipping stones, “That our willstones have will.”
But she couldn’t deny that he looked equally terrible— no amount of money or glittering extravagance could cover up how his skin clung to his bones with no mediator, how the bags beneath his eyes carried a decade and a half of night horrors and insomnia, how his smile, once as bright as all the stars he was named after, was now weak, empty, hopeless. Harry looked at this skeleton, this shell of a man she’d once loved as much as the father she’d never gotten the chance to truly know (because really, Harry hadn’t lost one father that rainy November morning— she’d lost three, each as painful as the next), and asked, “Where’s Remus?”
deserve. And what is a woman to do, when so honestly presented with all the grime and glory of death, but to beg for one final dose of cosmic morphine?
As Harry towards the ruins of Baalbek, she recalled all the mythos she’d read in her time here; the desert was a lonely place, and Harry hadn’t been much for opening up lately, so reading was often all she could do to distract herself. No one really knew who built this place— some said Cain built it to hide from the wrath of God; giants built it, at Nimrod’s command, and it came to be known as the Tower of Babel; Solomon built it, with djinns’ assistance, as a palace for the Queen of Sheba. Most historians agreed that it was a temple honoring Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and chaos, but Harry liked to think its roots stretched farther than that;  after all, the name “Baalbek'' came from Baal, the Phonecian god of fertility, Prince of the Earth. Whichever god this temple was built for, its architect clearly lacked piety; it was never completed. So Harry slowly approached stones older than she was possibly able to comprehend and tried her best not to think about all the loose ends in her own confusing, tangled up life.
She’d watched her first crush die before her eyes, went to his funeral instead of senior prom. When everyone else her age was getting smashed at freshers week, she was on a stakeout mission in the unforgiving deserts of the empty quarter, no music but gunshots and ticking time bombs, a hands-on dismantling class. She’d had knives, bullets and molotov cocktails alike hurled at her in blurs of maddening fury, and yet here she was, alive and well with all but a few scars to show for it, dressed in a slit dress as dark as the night above her and standing in the middle of the Malfoy Manor’s foyer. She was surrounded by a blur of guests whose bodies were adorned in the finest silks and purest diamonds, yet whose brains were filled with no more than horse shit. But if they were horse shit, then Harry was the flies that buzzed around them; if these men and women didn’t stain the country with their corruption and filth, then what would Harry be spending her life cleaning up? Something less bloody, she hoped.
“Apologies, sir,” Pius Thicknesse said, his words jittery and his nose sniffling, “You must know that you host one hell of a party.” He smiled, and an insidious mixture of grime and filth dripped from between his teeth.
When Harry opened her eyes, she saw nothing but a flower arrangement and a marble wall. She looked around— everyone else seemed entirely unphased, as if nothing had changed, and nobody had ever been there at all.
“That’s her fucking job, you absolute knob,” Lucius muttered beneath his breath, too bone-tired to be properly angry. “Keep an eye on her.” He ordered.
Normally, Harry would be wary of the fact that she was being singled out when she was meant to be blending in, but something told her that this was not an alarm.
it, could feel the black, heavy magic hanging in the air. The difference between magical guns and muggle guns was that while muggle guns killed your body, magical guns could get to your soul, too. How many sacrifices had been made at this very altar? How many had been slaughtered, in the past twelve months alone? She didn’t know, but what she was damn sure of was that she’d burn the whole world alive before she let Draco become the next.
“but her father has copies of practically every single magical newspaper ever printed, so we keep her around. Also, she’s pretty hot.” The ginger girl grinned slyly, and Harry was keenly reminded of a fox. Luna smiled and waved, a far away look on her soft-featured face.
She was built like a working woman, with broad shoulders and bright, hooded eyes, but her hands were soft, as if she only worked because she liked to. She looked at Cedric like she knew him deeply, in ways only forced proximity could create, and Harry squirmed internally.  “Meen el ajnabeya?”
“We begin to sit closer and closer, sharing mismatched thoughts between puffs of cherry-rolled cigarettes. You can feel yourself falling for me, a slow trickle at first and then a crashing typhoon of emotions, so heavy on your poor, damaged heart that you can barely bear to hold it all in. But I’m achingly cold and dauntingly mysterious— I only want what I can’t have, and you know that. So you never confess your love, and neither do I. We begin to slowly forget this place— either the owners go bankrupt, or we are simply pulled apart by the meddling strings of fate. But we never forget each other, despite the decades of separation. We grow old apart, never quite knowing what would’ve happened with the one that got away.”
much easier if only she could speak Arabic, could decipher the endless records in their original form, rather than have to scour the ends of the Earth for barely-useful translations. But half-forgotten song lyrics and faded memories of endearingly whispered “
it. But she couldn’t admit it, she couldn’t she couldn’t she couldn’t and so for now, this was enough.
“I’m sure—” Harry began, but was cut off with a hastily muttered “I’ll be back,” followed by a quick scuffle of a chair, and suddenly she was sitting alone, staring at the bright red vinyl of the seat before her.
“One,” Harry pounded her fists into the ground, and a neat circle of bodies dropped to the floor, “you all sit the fuck down.”
What she hadn’t told the serpents when she’d begged for more time, though,  was that she had already tried to kill Lea— and she’d failed miserably. She just couldn’t do it; she couldn’t look into the wide, hopeful eyes of a child, glassy and brimming with salt-ocean tears, and take her life away. She couldn’t do it, and she refused to let herself become
Now, it would be very easy to assume that Draco Malfoy’s danger lay in her physical capabilities, for physically capable she was, and she certainly looked the part too, with her platinum hair cut sharply just below her chin and her slender body perfectly clad in cloth the shade of midnight, an array of knives always within arms reach. She had a face like razor blades, full of cheekbones so sharp they’d cut you if you brushed them and aristocratic bows bathed in the shape of old money, grey eyes tinged in blue frostbite and lips red as blood.
“Noo, don’t take my dragon away, daddy,” Draco mumbled, rolling across the floor. Harry couldn’t help but admire her exemplary diligence at being the center of attention, even when drunk and unconscious.
“We come here everyday, and sit at opposite tables. I write clever yet heartwarming stories about all the regulars here: about the grumpy old man, standing right at death’s doorstep, absolutely hell-bent on feeding every stray cat possible before he goes. About the middle aged cashier, stuck in a foreign country where he knows none and is loved by even less, yet never fails to ask after everyone else’s kids. About the teenage waitress, so characteristically ready to run away but simultaneously determined to make every moment count, because she knows better than most that nothing in life is truly guaranteed. Meanwhile you sketch them into life, smearing charcoal onto coffee cups, across your face, somehow into your hair. Together, we unknowingly preserve this very moment into a sort of artistic immortality that not even time can wither.
The first thing Harry could think of as she began to come to was whether or not it was normal for snakes to fly, blood red and swirling right before her eyes. She thought she saw some fish too, pretty blues and yellows and purples, dancing across the dim, unfamiliar ceiling. And then someone slapped her real hard, and Harry went “Ungh,”
“Spare me the pleasantries, will you.” Lucius said, in a tone which perfectly enunciated just how unpleasant he found Thicknesse to be, “Are those sniffling bastards at the MI6 still digging around?”
“Watch your mouth, Potter,” Draco warned, and tightened her legs around the back of the chair, “I’m the one asking the questions, remember?”
“We didn’t take you anywhere, Harry,” Hermione explained, speaking slowly now, as if afraid to startle the beast, “You brought us here. I’m guessing you used apparition, although I have no bloody idea how you pulled that one off. Technically, it’s impossible to side-along without physical contact, and you were only touching Draco. Also, you don’t have a willstone, so technically, it should also be impossible for you to do any sort of magic at all, aside from perhaps blowing bubbles, or blooming flowers, but definitely not apparating six people at once.”
“Actually, I’m here to do you a favor,” She said, her elbow on the table and her cheek cupped casually by the palm of her hand, “That one,” She glanced inconspicuously to the left, “Won’t give you what you want. He’s not very, well, female-oriented. Also, he’s useless— all he did was fuck Blaise in his father’s office, which didn’t go over very well, as I’m sure you could imagine.”
So she wandered, running her hand across the shelves and letting her thoughts roam, lost in the twisting forests of her own thoughts. She rubbed the ring on her finger as she walked, taking it off one finger and slipping it onto the next— it fit perfectly, no matter where she kept it, a slithering baby serpent. She’d forgotten Draco had given her it at all, and she knew she should’ve tossed it away as soon as she noticed, but she just couldn’t help it; it was pretty, and Harry had a strange affinity for pretty, misplaced things.
Fifteen punches for fifteen missed birthdays. Two kicks in the gut for the two empty seats at her sixth form graduation. He just took it, said nothing, didn’t even try to hit back or get her off, as if he too believed he deserved it. And he did deserve it, so she kept going. A broken nose for her broken home, cracked ribs for the best friend she’d lost, another for the self hatred she was given instead. Two more kicks in the gut for two people she’d never get back, no matter how hard she hit or how much he bled. Ten more punches for ten long, silent years spent in witness protection, trusting no one and loving even less. Two hands wrapped around his neck for the image of Remus burned bright into her brain, sobbing and begging, on his knees in a filthy police station.
“I swear to every god in existence,” Harry promised, her voice shaking like holly leaves in December wind, “I will fucking kill you, Draco Malfoy”
“Oh, I’m sure you’d love that,” Draco purred, running her free hand up Harry’s sternum and back down again, then leaning down to whisper in her ear, “Want your hands all over me, don’t you? On my thighs, my waist, just a little bit below, a little bit above? But we can’t have everything we want, can we now?”
Draco mouthed along to the words as they floated into the room, and now Harry was dead sure that she was way too drunk to recognize her, because if she did, she definitely would not be looking at her like that. Like Harry was the answer to every question she’d ever asked, the key to every locked door in her mind.
Harry wanted to scream. It was the only thing she’d been able to think of, from the moment she’d woken up on the dusty warehouse floor, unbound and unharmed. “Fuck you,” she said instead.
Everything in Harry’s life had changed, but Draco Malfoy stood still, as if waiting for the rediscovery. The fear had left her, though, and her platinum hair was slightly longer now, brushing her pretty collarbones and framing her face. She was a little bit taller than Harry, but then again that could have easily been the red bottoms she wore, sharp enough to act as a weapon in and of themselves. She really was deadly; her lithe frame was draped in a silk slip dress that fell perfectly at mid-thigh, stained the color of midnight and doing a maddening job of accentuating every delicate dip and curve of her body. Harry noticed several swirling black lines decorating her milky white skin, and had to hold herself back from the overwhelming urge to
“Oh, shut up, you imbecile,” Lucius sighed, attempting to rub the incessant migraine out of his temples, “Have you noticed anyone who’s particularly out of place?”
“Oh yes sir, we should expect them to stick around for quite some time now, you know how they are, stubborn lot… but it’s all low profile sir, nothing to worry about… they haven’t found anything substantial for quite some time now, oh yes, we haven’t given the dirty bastards any chances…” Thicknesse rambled, his face twitching oh so slightly as he spoke, “Made sure the case ran cold, you know, sir, I have been working quite hard for some time now, and I’ve been thinking— ”
“Yeah, well, you’re not the first girl to call my willy remarkable,” Harry half-grinned, half-winced as Hermione tightened the final piece of gauze around her waist.
When Draco spoke, every word that slipped through her lips was precisely calculated, meticulously chosen from the reservoir of thoughts stacked neatly inside her brain and presented to the rest of the world on a shiny silver platter of eloquence and charm. She didn’t always say what she meant— she was brilliant at compartmentalization, and knew which words were soft and pliable and which were sharp, indispensable weapons— but she always, always meant what she said. So maybe that was what hurt Harry the most: the fact that whenever Draco was being cruel, she more than meant it; this was a girl who made no miscalculations. Or maybe what was worse was the fact that Harry let herself reach a point where she could be hurt by the words of a girl who, in the end, she scarcely knew at all.
Harry’s very useful brain quipped, “Or if you’re actually the Chosen One,” Harry struggled and squirmed, but Draco’s weight was solid atop hers, her thighs wrapped tightly around Harry’s quivering midsection, “Hell, I don’t care if you’re Merlin himself,” Harry attempted to get ahold of the energy in the room, tried to twist it to her favour, but it slipped through her fingertips like hot sand; she couldn’t focus, no matter how hard she tried, “You do
“I haven’t exactly figured that one out yet,” Hermione replied, almost annoyed that there was a question she couldn’t answer, “When you apparate, you’re essentially relocating yourself from one spot and simultaneously appearing in another, as quick as the thought that prompts it. But as far as I’ve read, not even Dumbledore himself can apparate to a place he’s never been before.”
“Uh oh,” Draco ran the gun over the left side of her face, then the right, “I warned you once already, Potter. I don’t like girls with dirty mouths,” She placed the muzzle softly over Harry’s pretty pink lips, pushed downwards oh so slowly, until they were parting open and ready, “Want me to clean it out for you?”
“You’d watch me decay, grow weaker day by day until you can barely recognize the skeleton before you, a flimsy shadow of the girl you once knew. I’d find a way to fuck it up, somehow, eventually, find a way to drag you into the mess that is my family until you were so far in, your life so intricately interwoven into the web of mine that my daddy would have no choice but to kill yours, and we’d fall right back to where we began.”
In the ebony doorframe stood Uncle Padfoot, dressed in a crop top riddled in artfully positioned holes and wrapped up in Moony’s frayed denim jacket. His hair was wind-tousled and his cheeks were bitten red with cold, and Harry could see a million and two stars swirling in the grey of his eyes, begging to be threaded into constellations. He smiled at her like he knew her and looked at her like he loved her, and when he stepped forward, Harry wanted to let herself break.
The thing Harry loved most about London, she thought, was that most of the time, it didn’t feel very much like London at all. It was a million cities in one, infinitely filthy with her shark-toothed businessmen and in the way you weren’t allowed to love her unless you sold your kidneys to pay the price, but also infinitely beautiful with her warm, laughter-brimmed pubs and in the way her streets lit up every single night, shifting constellations to make up for the smog-obscured ones above; in each of these million cities, Harry was afforded the complete, devastating freedom of becoming a whole new person.
Then Harry turned a corner and found Draco Malfoy amid the scattered papers and broken bottles, her limbs writhing in unnatural positions, splayed out on the floor like a dying animal. Her skirt was all torn up and her top smothered in dust; she was suffering, but she was making no sound at all— only silent tears, streaming down her grubby face, shining white rivers among the dirt. She recognized the curse—
“That they choose us, and not the other way around,” Blaise spoke from Draco’s left, lazily resting his chin in his palm, a man with all the time in the world. Harry noticed a gleaming silver snake twisting its way around his middle finger: the sign of the baby serpents. They all wore them, a crooked form of a children’s friendship charm.
Draco took her hand and pulled it up to her willstone, gently wrapping Harry’s fingers around it. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut and Harry had to take a long, deep breath to steady herself; it was as if every nerve in her body was on fire, warmth and power flowing through her at an unimaginable concentration. When she looked up, she found a dozen baby pink butterflies floating through the room.
“I promised to kill you, remember?” Harry whispered. As the light faded, she couldn’t help but think that Draco looked like an angel, her hair haloed by the rising sun. Slowly, she began to remember.
Despite Harry’s squirming discomfort towards her physical appearance, what made Draco truly dangerous had nothing to do with the sinful curves of her body (and
could sneak up on Harry twice, and she knew the bittersweet cadence of her voice by now. “Stop fucking following me,” Harry spat, the air escaping her lungs in loud, irregular cycles. She took a moment to look at Draco, to
One of the things Harry had found during her salvation of the dusty Potter Cottage was a big, brown chest tucked into the corner of James’ study, seemingly unlocked yet absolutely impossible to open. By the time she’d reached the top floor, Harry was already running on roughly 34 hours of no sleep, and when paired with the fact that she’d read every single political analysis James had ever written, things weren’t looking too good for her sanity.
girl.” Harry understood now, why Draco had reacted the way she did, that very first night in the Malfoy Manor’s bathroom. “I’d piss everyone off with how little they mattered to me— how could I pretend to care about their shallow smalltalk, when you
“I guess you’d believe me now if I told you I wasn’t following you,” Draco said. She was beautiful in a way that reminded Harry of the snowflakes piling up on the pavement: intricately complex, cold, and right on the verge of disappearing.
Harry had always thought that she wouldn’t be so goddamn sad all the time if she just had someone to spend it with; after Cedric, she wasn’t very keen on opening up to people. And at first, it really did seem to work— she now had a close circle she saw almost every day and an extended one every week, and they were never short on pranks to pull or pubs to crawl between. If you looked at it from the outside, Harry’s life had been steadily improving in all aspects; having a willstone meant she finally had control over her energy, and wouldn’t space out (or black out) nearly as often, and they’d even finally begun to make progress in the Malfoy-Black case. Hell, she hadn’t been stalked by the former for nearly three months, so why the fuck was Harry still so bloody miserable?
, thirty two pissed off, bearded Lebanese men unanimously turned around and stared back at her; it was like those old hollywood films where the damsel in distress walks into a dark, scary biker bar and is immediately overcome with jitters, a bunny in a fox den. And while Harry might arguably be in a constant state of slight to moderate distress, she was
” Draco hissed, her face only centimeters above Harry’s own, her eyes filled with a sort of malice she hadn’t seen in a long, long time, “If you’re some sort of magical prodigy,”
But then Harry Potter just had to walk in, and ruin everything all over again. So Draco did what any sane person would do in her situation— she stunned her, bound her ankles and wrists to an old wooden chair, climbed onto her lap, undid the top three buttons of her shirt (for dramatic effect), pointed a pistol at the pretty hollow of her throat, and waited for her to wake the fuck up.
“Look, Moony!” Harry cried, tugging at the frayed end of his denim jacket, “Look what I’ve got! I have Kit-Kats, and Snickers, and Aeros, and Smarties, and— Aagh!”
In the center of the room lay the undeniable source of that power: Theodora Nott, flanked on both sides by men and women so achingly beautiful Harry couldn’t help but recall The Last Supper. She recognized some of the disciples from another case’s files: Pansy Parkinson, heiress to the Parkinson Real Estate fortune, Marcus Flint, son of legendary footballer and notorious lothario James Flint, and Blaise Zabini, star record producer Michael Zabini’s bastard child. She wondered which one of these rich, pretty faces would be their Judas.
The thing about pain, Harry thought as she bled out onto the shining ivory floors, was that it does everything it can to make sure you feel it. It crawls beneath your skin like filthy parasites, twists into your veins like the flames of hell, squeezes your organs into whiskey wet rags until all you can do is feel God’s wrath crash into you, the waves of an Abrahamic typhoon you
“You underestimate me, Draco Malfoy,” Harry said, but she didn’t mean it; all she could see was James & Lily in their streetside cafes, and how much her father loved chocolate but Lily had an addiction to strawberry milkshakes and he had always loved her more, more than anything else in the whole world. She had to actively fight the urge to shut down completely, to curl into herself and never speak again.
Harry Potter knew a thing or two about beautiful girls, but beautiful was not a word fit to describe Draco Malfoy. It was a word made for soft girls who loved their husbands and respected their fathers, and knew nothing of blood bonding rituals or how to torture a man without killing him. Draco Malfoy had always been more weapon than woman; she was not beautiful. She was
Cedric Diggory knew everything there was to know about MI6 Case Focus #021A04 Theodora Nott: he knew she was born twenty seven years and fourteen days ago to a Lebanese mother and a French father, knew that she grew up tossed between gangs because they couldn’t decide what to do with her, knew that she harbored a strange affinity for barely-legal girls and that she slept on her right side because her left shoulder had been dislocated when she was nine years old and never set properly. He knew her shoe size and her favorite color, knew how she took her tea and what type of cigarettes she smoked when she was particularly stressed. What he didn’t know, however, was that she could smell a clean man from a mile away, and Cedric was as clean a man as they could come.
look at her: spread out on the concrete, pretty little hand cupped against her bleeding nose, dripping blooming crimson flowers onto her white top. Her pale hair was falling out of its ponytail and her light eyebrows furrowed in concentration, as if she could move the blood back into her body by force of sheer will alone. She couldn’t help but remember the first time she’d met Draco Malfoy, and just how different she’d been then. Her eyes had been filled with an unquenchable fire, a combination of mischief and bloodlust and the thrill of girls who had never been taught the word “no”. But they were empty now, weighed down by bags the color of bruises and hyacinth and falling night. She was skinnier, smaller, talked less and listened more— she’d been stripped of her invincibility.
“In another universe, you let yourself believe.” Draco replied in lieu of answering, and there were a million things she could’ve meant by that: believe in God, believe in Draco, believe in herself. But for some reason, Harry was sure she meant nothing at all.
“He didn’t fucking do it!” Draco screamed, and Harry let go, more out of shock than anything else. Then she noticed everyone else had been screaming too, but she only heard Draco.
She didn’t have a real explanation as to why she’d chosen to drive to Baalbek that morning; she’d woken up uneasy, drove aimlessly, and just happened to end up there. She’d been in Lebanon for over a year by then, working a bureaucratic corruption case. If you’d asked her two years ago, she would’ve never guessed that this is where she’d end up, but she knew it was equal parts punishment and protection. It was meant to serve as a warning against attachment, and a plea to be more careful with where she put her heart. Harry appreciated the sentiment, but she doubted it’d do any good; any efforts to reweave the strings of Harry’s heart were more than futile now.
s didn’t exactly count as literacy, and there weren’t too many proficient English scholars, it seemed, who were interested in the oil fields of the western Levant.
Draco pushed the gun into Harry’s mouth, slowly, carefully, watched her eyes grow wide and her pretty eyelashes flutter, her cheeks tint the faintest red as they hollowed around the cold, unforgiving barrel. She felt her squirm beneath her thighs as she pushed the gun in and pulled it back out, slow and steady. She watched her willstone glow, the prettiest bloodstone she’d ever seen, on the prettiest girl she’d ever seen. Then she pulled the gun out.
Harry reached down to feel her gut, which was slashed open and trickling blood; what a shame— she really did like this dress. She nodded at Hermione, and let her guide her to the bathroom. She may be extremely stubborn and just the slightest bit stupid, but she also knew that Hermione was right; if she delayed her wounds any longer, she’d end up in the ICU, and that was never a fun time.
“So, Harry Potter, what brings you to this grand establishment?” Draco asked, voice low and condescending.
the three girls warned, threatening danger hidden between floating notes and swirling champagne. Although she might be caught amidst a castle of beasts, at least there were three golden sirens on her side.
But she knew she wouldn’t be getting any sort of rest if she didn’t keep going, didn’t chase this seemingly endless paper trail until she caught it by its slippery-ass tail. She ran a shaky hand across her face and sighed; this all would’ve been
So really, Harry could not be blamed for choking on her cocktail the second she looked up, and was met with storm-cloud eyes (more like wet cement, Harry thought) and cheekbones so sharp she was sure they’d cut to the touch (it was a public safety hazard, honestly) and glossy-pink lips (she couldn’t even pretend to come up with an insult for those) that curled prettily around the rim of her rum and coke, tweaking into a smile as soon as she saw Harry fighting for dear life. And the worst part was, Draco fit right in— if 18th century France had a one night stand with Gothic England, the Voodoo Rooms would pop right out. Everything about it was dark and expensive, from the black leather seating to the gold-arched ceilings and glittering chandeliers; it smelled of sweet vanilla and old money, and Harry would be lying if she said she wasn’t just the tiniest bit infatuated.
want to get between Harry and her scotch. And yeah, maybe she did have a bad habit of acting like she was all tough and intimidating, but the truth was that her favorite part of Edinburgh had always been it’s people, and just how kind, warm, and
“Well, there is this one girl, Julie Michaels, nosey lass, yes, a bit too curious for her own good, that one… had our eye on her for quite some time now, but she never does much, always listening…”
When Harry looked at the Daily Prophet warehouse, all she saw was a broken mirror of herself. The towering aluminum walls were riddled with rust and faded with sun, half-heartedly locked away for decades, and not a single soul had ever bothered to transgress. She felt a strange kinship with this run-down, forgotten old building tucked away in the edges of London, felt the faint echo of all the stories it held as she ran her fingers across the ragged walls and pushed the door open, slowly, gently, wary to its needs and responsive to its reactions. And when the Daily Prophet warehouse looked at Harry, all it saw was a broken mirror of itself; a faux-fierce little girl in a white button down, sleeves rolled up and heart tucked in, locked away in her rattling ribcage for decades, and not a single soul had ever bothered to transgress.
“Sirius Black, is that you?” He rolled his eyes, but shook her hand anyway, her stubby little fingers enveloped entirely by his own. “Hold tight, Harriet.”
, dressed in a snakeskin skirt and a black turtleneck— and it was pissing Harry off, so she twisted her barstool back towards that idiot of a bartender, motioned for another glass, and said nothing.
Harry thought, as she sat in the empty bathtub, watching the patterns swirl on the tiles overhead. Hermione was on her tip-toes, scouring through the medicine cabinet and looking stressed, which really did not make Harry feel any better. “What’s a willstone?”
She pointed to the blonde haired girl next, who was busy admiring the dust mites shining in the moonlight, “That’s Luna Lovegood. Hermione hates her—”
So she honed in on it, remembered Cedric, bleeding out on the floor with a smile on his face, bastardly selfless until the very last second. She saw Draco, writhing on the dusty floors of an abandoned warehouse, her face twisted in self-inflicted agony. She remembered the months she spent watching her deteriorate, shriveling into herself, reduced to no more than a whisper of skin and bones. Harry pulled years of pain, loneliness, and desperation into the bloodstone now hovering in front of her, and pushed it all out through the two words she’d been searching for, dying for, for the past twenty five years.
locked the fucking door. Draco sensed the tension beneath her skin and tightened the hand on her waist; even when drunk off her ass, her instinct was always to protect.
“I'm afraid I'm not too well versed in the art of being an absolute vile piece of shit,” Harry said, voice faux-calm and level, “I’m not made of the filth you are.”
“But why would I come here?” Harry asked. The words “magic” and “willstones” rang in her ears like tinnitus, but she held back.
“He’s in London— We’re in London,” Sirius replied, his voice raspy and warm, just like Harry remembered. He sounded ashamed, almost, for just how long it had taken him to speak up, “I know this is a lot for you to process right now, but we— Remus and I— we want you to know that if you need somewhere to stay, you’re always welcome. We miss you, Harry.” There were roughly a million and one things that Harry wanted to say in that very moment
. With every paper she read and every journal she unearthed, Harry grew more and more certain of the one thing she’d known all along: that everything led right back to Draco Malfoy. The sole fact of her existence enabled a coalition of business and pleasure that London’s gangs had never seen before; she had a multiverse of power just within arms reach— all she had to do was
they were; she wasn’t quite accustomed to having that sort in her life, and spending 17 years in cold, stony Britain had done nothing to extinguish the flaming hearth of homesickness which burned ceaselessly behind the rungs of her ribcage. And sure, Edinburgh was no Baghdad, but for now, it was just about close enough.
In a cozy little living space littered with pretty trinkets, souvenirs, and odd floating objects were three deadly sirens, a runaway murderer, the sole heir to two of London’s largest crime syndicates, a ginger boy wearing polka dotted pajama bottoms, and Harry, bleeding out onto the otherwise perfectly pristine hardwood floors. She tried to get up, but her knees gave out beneath her and she crashed into the floor, right back to where she came from.
When Harry Potter looked at people, she could tell exactly what they were made of. But when she looked into Draco Malfoy’s eyes at 11:55 PM on New Year’s Eve, she saw nothing at all.
The thing was, though, was that she was nothing if not prepared; the second Rubeus had assigned her to gather intel for the Black case, she knew exactly what it would entail: a lot of parties and a lot of pretending, both practices which Harry had many, many years to acquaint herself with. She knew that in order to get anything out of these snobby socialites, she had to know exactly how they thought, had to learn all the dirty secrets that kept them up at night. So, for the first time in sixteen years, she’d headed straight back to her childhood home, back to the pretty little cottage on the edge of West Country where her rawest thoughts and dirtiest secrets were held, where all her brightest dreams and most vivid nightmares had been born.
In the quarter of a second that it took Harry to whip a revolver out, Theodora had ripped Cedric apart with her bare hands. Streaks of crimson blood lined his chest, his hand clutching his heart, black rosary beads slipping through his fingertips. Harry was sure that Theadora Nott
The gun in Flint’s hand was a magical one; Harry knew this by now, could easily distinguish the ornate gold runes engraved into the grip. But more than that, she could
“Oh, so you weren’t?” Harry quipped back, but she didn’t have it in her to sound suspicious, even though she knew she probably should be. Not anymore, not after everything.
And then there was Sirius Black, splayed out in the midst of it all with his perfect suit and his perfect hair and his dead, empty eyes, and Harry could feel ghosts swirling inside her bones. For a second, she thought she saw the shadow of a smile, saw in this shell a shadow of the Uncle Paddy who carried her on his shoulders and chased her across the yard and tucked her in at night and loved her more than all the stars in the sky.
“D’you reckon you could help me?” Cedric asked, smiling. Cedric Diggory was bleeding out onto the carpet, seconds away from facing the grim reaper, and he was smiling.
That morning, they ate together. Ron prepared a full English brekkie: blueberry pancakes and fresh orange juice and eggs from the garden and real bacon, fried in real butter. Harry hadn’t eaten so well in
“You’re a funny one, aren’t you?” Hermione laughed, leaning against the door. Her hands were stained red with blood and antiseptic, and Harry couldn’t help but feel grateful. “Jokes aside, though, you’ve taken this all pretty well. We were expecting more shock, and a lot more denial.”
The thing about pain, Harry thought as she bled out onto the shining ivory floors, was that it does everything it can to make sure you feel it. It crawls beneath your skin like filthy parasites, twists into your veins like the flames of hell, squeezes your organs into whiskey wet rags until all you can do is feel God’s wrath crash into you, the waves of an Abrahamic typhoon you
The thing she loved most about Edinburgh, Harry thought as she swirled her nearly-empty cocktail glass, wasn’t the centuries of history infused within its gorgeous cobblestone streets, the endless array of mouth-watering restaurants lining said streets, or even the fact that 90% of scotch was made within its very borders— and trust me, you did
“That’s my brother, Ron,” She pointed at the ginger boy, who was still shirtless, but now held a throw-pillow over his torso, as if that helped, “He’s the only one of us that still lives at home, because he’s a wuss and a mummy’s boy—” She was very rudely interrupted by a pillow in her face.
lucky. Rather, it was that now, every time her body was pumped full with adrenaline, be it from pre-mission nerves or the sound of late-night footsteps outside her door or snake-mouthed girls with hollow eyes and empty smiles, she felt every flutter, every skip and pause, all pumping into the dark, dark stone hanging just below the hollow of her throat. And so that night, as Harry ran and ran and ran, she could hear her heart much louder than ever before.
When he closed his eyes, Harry ran. They were beasts, so she ran and she ran and she ran. She ran past Draco, who was wracked with dry, terrified sobs as she clutched Theadora’s face, begging her to “Wake up Thea, please Thea please wake up wake up wake up fuck.” She ran past thirteen girls with empty eyes, strewn across the hardwood floors and barely aware of her presence, too doped up to realize, or care that they were about to be sold away. She ran past all the dead men that littered the alleyway, through the dark, winding streets of central London, and up to the Thames, where she stuck her fingers down her throat and begged her body to throw up everything that had happened, pour the whole night out of her till she collapsed into herself, a million unanswered questions swarming her mind. (
He leaned in further, his voice barely a whisper yet entirely audible, “Hkeya an el banat eli bitkhabuhm mini. Mosh eyb, heyk?”
Then, a storm poorly disguised as a girl barged in, and caught Harry’s wrist firmly in her hand. It was the dark-skinned siren from before, her expression both deeply understanding and disapproving. “No,” she said, and pushed Harry’s hand down from where she’d been holding a blade against Sirius’ neck.
“I’d force you to dance with me, because I know you’d suck at it. You’d stumble and blush, like some sort of adorable, lethal baby deer.” Draco brought her other hand up to Harry’s cheek, the soft pads of her fingers moving back and forth, “Then I’d kiss you, slowly, beneath evergreens strung with fairy lights, after we’d both had a couple of drinks and nothing would matter but the little sounds you’d make and the way my hands would twist into your hair. I'd apparate you home and we’d trip over each other in the hallway of my apartment, and you’d say something dumb and wonderful about how you still couldn’t believe things like that were really possible.” With every word, Draco inched closer and closer.
“Magic can be really overwhelming to your body, to say the least. That’s why we need willstones; without them, it’s just a bunch of raw energy everywhere, fraying at your nerves and messing with your body’s natural balance. Cases like yours aren’t common; magic is precious, so wizards don’t tend to leave many orphans, or bastards. But usually, wizards without willstones are drawn to magic when it’s in small quantities, and repulsed from it when it’s in abundance. The fact that you were able to do anything substantial without a willstone is really quite remarkable.”
her as she moved closer, all the way in until their faces were only a whisper apart. Could feel the vibrations of her pretty throat as she hummed to the distant music.
Draco didn’t seem to notice Harry at all, too caught up in her own torment to acknowledge her presence.
He gave her a real, slimy grin, and for the first time, Harry saw something truly disgusting in Cedric: she saw all his want, and none of his fear.
For once, Harry wasn’t surprised to see her; in fact, it seemed as though today, she was the one doing the surprising, if the way Malfoy’s eyes widened as she looked her up and down (and then down again) was any indication. It was a Malfoy wedding, and usually, that meant dark, but today, Draco was the softest Harry had ever seen her. Her dress was floor length, baby blue flecked with gold sparkles that seemed to shift into constellations, and Harry supposed they actually might be. Her hair was pinned away from her face, laced with tufts of baby’s breath.
“Hermione, she’s alive!” a boy said, his voice echoing from somewhere very far away. Slowly, she began to remember: a party, a bathroom, a knife,
“That they choose people and make us want them,” Pansy spoke from Draco’s right, her nearly-black eyes glowing with barely-contained mischief, “Lure them in, make us believe it’s real. Call it fate, or soulmates, or pheromones.”
In the corner of that room, just a few steps away from the corpses of her parents, sat a beast, legs curled into a heaving chest. His hair was dark, messy, and tinged with blood, as if he’d spent hours raking his fingers through it, and his eyes were frantic, grey as storm clouds and dripping tears like last night’s rain. It was his arms that gave him away, though, soaked to the elbows in crimson blood. Later, she would be told that he was holding a knife; onyx black and wolf-headed, carved with three tiny initials that would keep a man behind bars for the remainder of his life: S.O.B.
In the past three years, Harry had been to more superfluous balls and unconscionable banquets combined than she could possibly count; she’d seen it all, from charity galas where they served gold-leaf champagne to baby showers where the farthest you’d have to go for a line of coke was the little girls’ room. Yet somehow, there was something about weddings at The Ritz London that always managed to steal the air right out of her lungs, to make her feel like a teenage girl in stilettos that didn’t quite fit just yet. It held a type of beauty that was hard to deny, from the scarlet-gold carpets to the ceiling high mirrors to the delicate crystal chandeliers, dripping in elegance and draped in etiquette so foreign to her she might as well have shown up in her underwear. In that ballroom was everything Harry had always wanted yet knew she could never have, and Draco Malfoy was no exception.
“I’d treat you right,” she continued, her fingers curled softly around Harry’s willstone, “Keep my hand on your waist so everyone would know you’re mine, only mine. I’d show you off, introduce you to every single one of my homophobic aunts and racist uncles as
Harry had never been the type to sleep in; even her prettiest, most peaceful dreams had the tendency to twist into rather grisly nightmares, and she suffered more than her fair share of mortal anguish during the day, thank you very much. But in that moment, sitting on the hard, dusty floors of the London Library for the fifth hour in a row, there was nothing she craved more than the weight of a fresh, warm duvet on top of her and the type of bone-tired, 15 hour sleep that left no room for any sort of dreams, let alone nightmares.
“Yeah,” Ron sighed, but it was clear he was far elsewhere, twisting a million different scenarios inside his head, each one uglier than the next. Harry felt a black pool of guilt swirling inside her stomach; she so badly wanted to comfort him, but hadn’t the slightest idea how.
He pulled his glasses off and tucked them into his shirt, then gave a subtly unsubtle glance towards the wall behind her.
