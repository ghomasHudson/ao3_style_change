“Yes,” Hermione yelled. Oh, good, they were listening. Narcissa shot her a quelling glare, but she whipped out the blackboard and the tome and rushed over, talking through her theories.
Blaise pocketed his wand and held out his hand for Draco, who shuffled across the front step. The minute he touched Blaise’s arm, Neville apparated them to the back parking lot of the shopping center. There were dumpsters.
“Are we going somewhere? You’re all dressed.”
Could I tempt you and Ron to dinner sometime next week? Remus is going to the Midlands on some course about gastrointestinal things, so I’ll be especially lonely.
Harry blew out of his nostrils. “One, that was S.P.E.W., two, it’s now an international organization that coordinates elf demands and strikes, and three, the name of my club is perfectly fine, and most of the kids just say ‘waw-fan,’ so, it’s fine. It doesn’t need to be marketable. It’s a Hogwarts club.”
Astoria nodded and then realized he couldn’t see her and choked out, “Ok.”
Minerva said with a smile, “Since we all will be chaperoning, I’m sure we can break up any of the more inappropriate maneuvers. If necessary, I’m sure a simple
“Ron?!”
Draco looked a bit startled and said in a vague tone, “I’ve never had a requited love before,” and then he coughed and broke into some concluding remarks.
Harry knew he shouldn’t pry at that one, but he really couldn’t resist raising his eyebrows.
“Don’t you have anything to do?”
“The humors?”
“We thought we were all working together for the good of the school, but she was only out for herself.” Audrey sighed and blinked a few tears from her lashes.
Astoria nodded but her eyes were so hard to hold open. Maybe it would be easier if she just shut them for a minute. And then—
Malfoy’s grin vanished. Stabbing one very pointy finger into Harry’s shoulder, he hissed, “You don’t understand anything, do you, Potter?”

Marcus is craving ginger ice cream and boiled peanuts, which are a weird American food we first tried during the 2001 QWC and are just about impossible to buy pre-made in the UK. Dear baby, stop making your dad want boiled peanuts, love, your other father who’s losing his fingerprints shelling raw peanuts. Please send us any and all pregnancy and childcare tips!

Two and a half hours later, Lavender had collapsed onto a horsehair couch (slippery motherfucker) and threw her legs over the arm.
Sirius was very distracting.
How very curious, Blaise thought. He penned a quick note back, sealed it, and handed it to the owl, who chirped twice and swooped out the window.
“At least I don’t have a stick up my—”
Pomona sniggered. “He’s always struggled teaching kids who don’t have natural aptitude.”
Not that she could see that right now. It was dark as fuck. Glowing orbs hovered along the drive, lighting the way towards the columned front entrance.
“SEVEN!”
“No, papa,” Victoire whined. “No seat.”
“Addie, come now, surely you can do better,” she said and struck a casting pose. “On the count of three—”

“Any particular kind?”
The next three weeks were terrible. Harry spent that first weekend sewing historically accurate Elizabethan era costumes for his fifth-year class and mulling over how Malfoy’s history had just spilled out of him. It was inexcusable. Malfoy had killed a Squib. Malfoy had broken Harry’s nose on the Hogwarts Express. Malfoy had yelled blood purist shit at Hermione. Malfoy had tried to kill Dumbledore. Not that Dumbledore had always acted to protect Harry—no, Dumbledore had raised him to be a sacrificial lamb—something Harry had spent months working through with his therapist—but the thought stuck in his throat until he shook his head. He didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t forgive Malfoy, but it seemed just as fucked up to hate him for actions he now regretted, and he couldn’t continue with the Flirting Plan. He sent a quick note to Ron and Hermione (
She wasn’t going to let him just drift away from the subject.
Neville shifted, his eyes darting from side to side. “Hour and a half, tops.”

Harry shrugged. Yeah, maybe he should have. But it was going to happen now; he could feel it in his stomach. It was the right thing to do. People weren’t supposed to be lonely on Christmas. Plus they couldn’t get Teddy the same things. That would be stupid and a waste of money and Teddy would be annoyed. (Teddy would not have been annoyed. He was a thoroughly unflappable child who didn’t care much about material objects beyond one ragged stuffed wolf he called ‘Lupy,’ and a framed portrait of his parents from the day he was born. But if Harry needed to think that, well, fine.)
“I might have had another piece of goose,” Harry said in protest. Kreacher shook his head. Harry pouted for a minute, then picked up a cracker. “Draco?”
“Yes?” he said, clutching his teacup.
“Come off it, Malfoy, like that would work.”
Teddy opened his mouth, took one look at Harry’s face, and shut it again.
Harry hummed, feeling the subtle shift in the air. Malfoy’s magic was much softer than it’d been as a teenager, which was to be expected, but Harry hadn’t realized how much his magical signature had mellowed. If Harry’s magic was a lightning blaze, crackling and fierce, Malfoy’s magic was like gentle waves or a slowly coursing river, slowly causing shifts in the fabric of space and time.
“Fine,” Harry groaned. “You can come too, and we’ll go to Waterstones so you can get more trash to read.”
“Do you uh, want me to bring you my copies of the
“And who else do we have tonight?” Val surveyed the group, recognizing almost everyone except the gorgeous young man Neville had his arm around and the—wait, was that Draco Malfoy?! Val felt a spike of ice run down their spine. They tilted their head.
“Ron didn’t want to leave the roast unattended,” she said, with a quick glance in the rearview mirror at Malfoy. “You know how he gets about basting.”
Actually, it wasn’t bad at all.
“I’ve never even seen that one before.” Harry was trying the swallow the lump in his throat. “Where’d you find it?”
“No, no, please,” she said, to whom she didn't know.
“Do you have some homework or something to work on before we eat?”
Not that it really mattered. He was totally chill. This was just a fun lark. An amusing little contest. Something to spice up the monotony of the summer.
“No,” Harry blurted. “No.”
Minerva nodded several times. “Professor Malfoy has changed since his—” she seemed to be searching for a word—"misspent teen years at this institution.”
“Serpens semper.”
Sirius was about to respond when he realized that might be contradictory to the order. He downed the whiskey. Remus would have been able to explain it better. At least he had a calming voice. And he didn’t really ramble. He was efficient. Sirius bit at his pinky nail.
There was a yelp from the armchair. “Potter!”
She took a shaky breath. “Does Draco love someone?”
Harry blinked. How did Draco know about that? Hadn’t he been in Europe, swanning about libraries and writing books? Harry had updated him on the general revisions to the O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. tests, but he hadn’t mentioned how he’d overhauled the entire Muggle Studies curriculum.

Harry hummed. “You don’t like, regret not getting together sooner?”
Harry thought, and grinned. He tucked the quill behind one ear and saluted Minnie on the way out.

They’d all passed their classes, more or less, and then they’d graduated—the first and hopefully only eighth-years Hogwarts would ever see.
“Thanks, Mum,” Harry said with an eye roll as they pulled themselves vertical.
Thirty-four minutes later, Draco attempted puppy-dog eyes, but Harry was resolute. He had already grabbed the sticky notes and added them to Draco’s pile. Twelve mysteries. Draco would be done with those in four days. Fucking brainiac.
Re: Powerpoint

“Well,” Harry stretched out the word to give himself time to think. “I believe Professor Malfoy and I can assemble a panel who can speak to, uh, any questions you might have.”
“It’s just a look,” he said. “Robes and sunglasses and scarf—it’s a lot.”
Harry gulped some cocoa down. Damn, it was quite hot and the Firewhiskey didn’t help.
But then it was on the floor. Harry blinked. He was sure—

“Er, wait,” Blaise said. “We’re going to a mug—er, non-magical shopping center.”
Turning it over in his fingers, Harry saw it was a silver cigarette case—a bit battered and dented and with a complicated family crest.
Harry didn’t look back on the way down the bleachers. He had to wipe his hands on his pants twice.
In the moment of silence between songs, Elspeth wriggled a bit and said, “Britney, what’s he bringing out? I don’t understand—”
“One, Blaise said a necklace cursed with some kind of sexual spell was stolen from the Oliver-Winger residence last night. Two, he was alerted to this around six in the evening, but the family first noticed it had gone missing around five. Three, he and Ronald arrived on the scene at six-thirty, boring police questions were asked, etc., the full details to which I am not privy.”

Luckily, Luna came through the floo and it took all of Harry’s attention to attempt to untangle the strands of vaginal amulets from her hair. He was trying to politely explain to her that maybe it was best to just give the teenagers the highlights of tantric sex communication and maybe not to wear the aforementioned amulets when Hermione burst through in an explosion of papers.
ill, Harry thought. “I saw you dancing.”
He rose and waved his wand, sending an almost opaque blue cube into the center of the table. Seconds later, a transparent red sphere joined it. As they bumped alongside each other, Draco continued, “For years, we’ve been trained to see magical and muggle history as two separate entities, with muggles—” with a flick of his wand, the blue cube sent spikes into the red sphere—“interfering in our affairs, thus situating wizards as the victims. However, historical research has demonstrated that the two worlds have been interlaced for thousands of years.”
The air was pressing in on Harry’s ears.
“This device was released two months ago. As in, it’s new. It’s a very nice present from Harry.”
Someone who would push him to be a better person, friend, educator, godfather.
“No,” Sirius protested and vanished something.
A silence stretched between them.
“Mr. and Mr. Lupin?”
“Hey,” Bill growled. “I have a fang earring.”
“Our parents are fucking—”
Well, fuck, that was early.
An ‘er’ in Bertramese was a strongly worded Fuck You, and Astoria squeezed his hand. “Thanks, Bertie.”
Malfoy, who was sitting side saddle on his hovering broom, said, “Punctual as ever.”
“I know you’re a big girl, Vic,” Bill said, lifting her up and setting her on his hip. “But grandma thinks you’re little still, so sometimes we have to pretend you’re little to make Grandma Molly happy. Can you keep the secret with me?”
“Darling, firstly, Pride was last month, and secondly, you should use a clarifying shampoo. At least occasionally. Oh, thanks, love,” she said and blew Ron a kiss as he handed her a cup of tea.
They were a little dry.
“I’ll have to keep you entertained, then, won’t I?”
“Ah,” Draco said, pressed his lips together, and jerked his head in a little nod. “Ok.”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up, then fell. “Oh, Gin. Duh.”

Ron’s birthday came around and Harry didn’t even hesitate before sharing the details with Draco. He turned up with a wrapped present (a tin of fancy broom polish, as it turned out), wrapped one muscular arm around Harry (for the Floo, he knew, only for efficiency’s sake), and brushed soot off Harry’s cheek. There were lots of drinks and Harry found himself at half-midnight talking to Dean about love.
“Yeah? They’re engaged? That’s why Ollie transferred to the Cannons. Pudd wanted him to keep his engagement secret. Bullshit,” Andre said, cracking his knuckles.
Draco blinked rapidly. “It’s not, it’s not—Mr. Lupin didn’t—” he dropped his voice to a whisper, “curse Sirius?”
Harry shrugged. “Whatever.”

“THREE!”
Draco assisted me in collecting botanical samples for herbological studies, for my own academic studies and for others who requested samples. This was largely manual labor (digging, hiking, walking, hauling, crawling, camping, pruning, etc.). This was difficult for Draco at first, who seemed to be suffering from a combination of malnutrition and PTSD, but I realized this and tried to adjust our activities. Gradually, he was able to work his way up to more intense hiking, hauling, and chopping. I prefer not to use magic while collecting, as human-related magical spikes can disturb botanical magical networks, so there wasn’t a great shift in our activities after Draco got his wand back. He seemed most interested in the magical effects or abilities of plants, rather than the processes of collecting, which is hardly surprising, given what I knew of him at Hogwarts (not a field work bloke, no slight on him personally, just … a different type of personality).

Andromeda nodded, then realized he wasn’t looking at her, so said emphatically, “Yes.”
The days of Christmas shenanigans at the Burrow were enough to drive anyone mad. At least Molly didn’t hate her anymore, but there were just too many Weasleys for there to be even a moment of peace and quiet.
“Tell me why I shouldn’t curse you,” Talbott said calmly. “You’ve got thirty seconds.”

“Lord,” Astoria said with a sigh. She grabbed a napkin, went over to Draco, smiled in greeting, brushed the crumbs into the napkin. “They’re crackers.”
§145 of the Legal Reform Act of 2004 did not abolish underage marriage contracts bound by blood dating before 1990. This means that until the contract is voided, it remains binding.
Andromeda poured the tea and set it on the table. The Black armor was too heavy, so she set it aside and said in her ordinary voice, “You couldn’t lurk in doorways at Grimmauld because darling Auntie Walburga had enchanted them all and you’d come out in boils unless you went through rather quickly.”
Neville appeared to be blushing. Again? Still? Luna blinked a few times. She wasn’t used to his bashfulness. Re-bashfulness?
Draco swallowed and pressed his hands across his thighs.

“They’re not that dry,” he said.
He’d been working on not doing that. Or at least on hiding it better. And now Neville might know or guess or intuit that he wasn’t all quite there or quite alright. All right in the head. And it was fucked once again.
Parvati was still sitting on the couch.
Growing up in a non-magical household with abusive relatives—who treated Potter’s early magical accidents as dangerous—has given Potter a seemingly endless well of compassion for anyone outside the magical “mainstream.”
Andre sat back down in the armchair, stared at Harry, and tilted his head to one side. He rotated one earring and said consideringly, “I think our dear Professor Malfoy will have a shock in the morning.”
Talbott’s mouth quirked into a grin. “Ever since the Death Eaters were so easily able to take over the ministry and get ahold of all its records, I’ve been a bit, shall we say, wary?” His red eyes glowed in the firelight. “There aren’t any long-term deleterious effects! Audrey and I became animagi when we were kids and we turned out alright.”

“Do you have class today?”

Remus couldn’t avoid Sirius’ gloating expression. Only opening crackers with one other person was not a very obvious mode of flirting, and Remus wished he’d spent more time trying to teach Harry how to express their intentions.
When he woke up, Malfoy was still in his armchair with his nose in a book.
“Let’s go take some house points, Professor Potter.”
“Oh, that little blond boy?”
They shook their head, bit their lip, and then, in a slightly lilting tone, recited: “He visits my town once a year. He fills my mouth with kisses and nectar. I spend all my money on him.”
Malfoy licked his lips. “It’s gotten lots of compliments, you know,” he almost purred.

Harry shot him a confused look.
But interwebz = the internet. It’s the world wide web (like that’s where www comes from).
“That’s nice, dear,” Mum said, thrusting another cup of tea in front of Ron. “Drink up, get your strength back.”
Remus shot them a gentle smile. “It’s ok.”
It turned out that Malfoy had spent five years traveling the world and spending time with wizarding enclaves, many of which were much more open to more sexualities than wizarding Britain acknowledged. The long independence of Japan from the bigotry of Christian and wizarding missionaries allowed a flourishing of same-sex relationships, while entire villages of Kenyan witches shunned men. Malfoy’s eyes shone as he explained the intricate courtship rituals of northern Europe, the yogic wizards of Mumbai, and the community of Animagi in rural Idaho who embraced wizarding children who’d been disowned for showing “abnormal” traits.
“Normal werewolves get heightened senses, but,” Remus said with a shrug. He just always forgot that other people liked … well, the taste of things. If it was hot, that was good enough for him.
That eyebrow raise was the same, anyway.
“Hello, darlings,” Lavender trilled. She dropped Harry’s elbow and kissed Astoria on both cheeks. “Well, isn’t this cozy.”
“Balsamic? Or is that too obvious.”

“This cake is so good,” Harry said suddenly around a mouthful of cake. They stared at Ron.

At Harry’s confused look she said, “It goes directly to the Unspeakables’ archive. They process it and put it into the vaults for research purposes.”
“A partner would be jolly,” Harry said and sighed. “But everyone just wants the Boy Who Lived or whatever.”
He snapped his book shut.
She wasn’t sure she’d ever get used to the brass plaque screwed into the oak door. When the chair showed her around the department on her first day, Hermione hadn’t actually read the names on the plaques and had just assumed that it was a holdover from 1909—not that they were updated and engraved with the current faculty’s name. It made sense, once you thought about it, because what would be the point of labeling offices with the names of long dead men, but at the same time, the cryptic workings of the London Institute of Magical Studies wouldn’t have surprised her.
“Shit,” she said. The tears were coming again.
Yours faithfully,
“Potter. Come now.”
“Er,” Ron said. His insides were doing something weird. “Frogs.”
“Merlin, you brought it?!”
Andy burst out laughing. “He what?!”
“Yeah, Malfoy, no worries. Just missed you at dinner and wanted to make sure you were ok.”
He tore off a piece of parchment and sat at his desk.

Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm as the opening lyrics of ‘Chasing Cars’—
“It’s not fancy,” Harry said sternly. “I bring a bottle of plonk and we have crêpes and Teddy always has too much sugar and ends up crashing by eleven. There are tears. And you’d have to get him presents. But not the ones I’m getting him.”
He’d never have expected to one, befriend Harry Potter and two, develop a huge crush on Harry Potter. Well, the second was way more likely. Who didn’t have a crush on Harry Potter? But befriending Harry Potter. That still seemed mad.

Reinstatement of Library Privileges
“Harry seems like a generous person.”
Remus just looked at them evenly. A few years ago, Sirius would have roared right back, but now he waited. They both waited.
He scratched his nose. “He was friends with Draco at Hogwarts, but I, uh, I haven’t mentioned that Draco’s assisting me up here because I haven’t wanted to get into the whole blood supremacy thing like, I don’t think Blaise has those views like he was talking about how he’s been really impressed with all the changes to magical society in Britain in the year he’s been back, but we’ve only spent four days together, and now it’s gotten to that point where I don’t want to fuck things up because even though it’s only four days, I really like him and I keep having these dreams—er, well. Yeah.”
Welcome to our first family Christmas letter, where you all can be treated to self-deprecating notes on our successes and a glossy bandage applied over all our failures. Compare your own lives and weep (just kidding! Please don’t!).
The back of Neville’s neck reddened. “Andy, Blaise, Blaise, Andy.”
She made a frustrated noise and rubbed her temples.
Dear Mr. Malfoy,
“Where is he,” she ground out.
“Be careful,” Draco demanded as Blaise flicked his wand. “It’s House of Merlin.”
Harry chose to ignore that and held up the snitch.
It flew open again and Malfoy was shoved—Neville swallowed a grin—onto the broad front step.
“Do not want to know,” Harry interrupted. They crammed a gigantic piece into their mouth.
“And even that was a bit much.” Harry washed down a prawn with a swig of non-alcoholic butterbeer. “They weren’t even really grinding. Just sort of pre-groping.”
o lol ya I see
is a popular culture icon. An ideal suggestion, Mr. Lupin.”
Malfoy peeked out from behind one hand.
If you find out what he’s confused or concerned about, please let me know.
“Yeah, I’ve the most experience with dark artefacts, thanks to you, mate, and Blaise is good at the jewelry stuff, so, yeah. We’re working on it.”
It was Parvati.
“You won’t do anything stupid.”
She touched the brim of her hat, which floated off her head. She snapped and it dropped on the nearest desk. Another wave of whispers. “No, not wingardium leviosa.

She walked across the room to where Harry had frozen, looked down into his tea cup, wrinkled her nose at his milky brew, and then looked straight up and him and hissed, “If you fucking hurt him, I’ll kill you.”

This was amazing and terrible, Astoria realized and bit the inside of her cheek.
4 months tho u been counting hmmmMMMmm
Then again, he went to fancy libraries and studied old books.
Harry squinted. Was Malfoy trolling him?
Harry blinked a few times. “You were crushing me with your muscular thighs!”
“I’m actually staying here, Potter.” He looked down at the list of students’ names. “The Manor was confiscated as part of our reparations.” A pause. “I haven’t been there in years. I think it’s a sanatorium now, or something.”
It missed him and fell into the grass.
“No, no, no, like from being a professor,” he protested. “And from schooling the fucking Ministry in court. Ya know. Just casual Hermione things.”
“Prawn shelf,” Harry yelled. “For later.”
“Working too hard, again?” Remus asked after Sirius had done his full bounding tackle and hair-ruffle and kiss routine.
“Haven’t been since he fucked off to Tanzania with his secretary.”
like some kinda meeting
“I do not!”
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry said weakly. He’d completely spaced. He wasn’t even sure they’d learned Ebublio in school.
“I think she was bored, anyway,” Sirius said with a grin that faded under Harry’s glare.
Minerva raised an eyebrow.
“Which is a significant investment of time and effort.”
“Like what?” Hermione didn’t buy vague statements.
It wasn’t as though Malfoy was chummy. They did spend a few hours a week discussing upcoming lesson plans. Malfoy didn’t know much about the O.W.L. or N.E.W.T. reform, so Harry filled him in on the new standardized levels and the focus on experiential learning. Malfoy would roll his eyes and go off into some lecture (honestly) about how lecturing was a time-tested method that helped younger students form a narrative from a series of disconnected historical facts and how this was a much more age-appropriate introduction to historical research and methodology than digging through the archives, which they could get into if they decided to pursue a post-N.E.W.T. year or go on to graduate work in the field. Harry would groan and insist that lectures were tedious and multiple studies had shown that students actually remembered their hands-on lessons. That wasn’t friendliness. That was just two colleagues debating teaching methodologies. Once a week. For at least four hours. Usually over a scotch or two.
Malfoy tutted and Harry panicked; he sounded just like Umbridge and Harry was mentally thrown back into detention with the horrible woman. Rubbing the scar on his hand, he tried to do some breathing to prevent the trigger from turning into full-on panic. His Muggle therapist Donovan had taught him 4-7-8 breathing and he closed his eyes and briefly envisioned his escape to Malaga.
“Uh, yeah,” Pansy said.

Draco hadn’t wanted to do it. Astoria had looked up from her doll and smiled. But Draco had pitched a fit, a real and proper fit with a scarlet face and spittle flying everywhere until Lucius had yanked him out of the room. She’d never asked about what happened in the hallway.
Hermione shot Ron a Look and continued, “I think the war really changed him and if you’ve read his book—”
Remus wondered.
“I’ll just, er, mate,” Harry said, clapping Ron on the back.
Fighting the urge to respond with an honorific, Harry nodded. His mouth was too full of toast to open.

Blaise shook his head and said, “Maybe you can like, work some gay plants into your curriculum.”
Harry shook his head and grit his teeth. “Nope, cupboard under the stairs. Sandwich?”
“I’ve always been a lot,” he said eventually. “You should know that more than anyone else.”
Pansy sipped her tea.
“It was going to be useful when I got out.” Draco lifted a ginger scone to his mouth, then set it back on his plate. “But it turns out things are very different.”
“Right,” Neville said and flipped his lab notebook open. “First, we could continue titrating the flebotomos lousewort.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I mean, he’s a really fit bloke, so I wouldn’t mind being with him—”
🝆∧ [oil and]
Remus didn’t think Harry would, but better to draw a line in the sand now rather than later.
“We’ve got to go get … the stuff,” he said.
“Oh, darling, I was the spotty, weedy, ginger terror for you. Always.”
“And tomorrow—” a shadow passed over Harry’s face. “Tomorrow they’re going to Andromeda’s.”

“Professor Malfoy—” Draco abruptly moved away, and Harry felt cold—“has proposed some changes for the History of Magic curriculum.”
Harry laughed. “You can’t help it, can you?” He reached out and grabbed Draco’s head, ruffling his hair. Draco yelped and fought for a moment, and then submitted, drawing in a long breath. Harry felt how soft his hair was, watched the rise and fall of his chest and how his almost-clear eyelashes still made little shadows on his pale cheeks.
“Well, times change.”
The door slammed shut and Neville’s head shot up. Malfoy better not have hurt Andromeda, or fucked with that door, which Neville had just got to hang right again after the wet winter—
Dear Mr. Lupin,
reader, but thank you.” Again, the mouth twitch.
He pulled the shrunken presents out and told Teddy, “I’ll unshrink them once you’ve unwrapped them, otherwise you’ll know what they are immediately.”
She was concentrating so hard on not allowing her leg to spread out to touch Parvati’s that she had no idea what they were discussing. Something something MACUSA, something auror, investigation, BAME mandate, non-magical blah, blah, blah.
“Ok, really not supposed to tell you this, but we were called up for a B&E, and it’s like, this horribly cursed jewel? That someone in Hogsmeade was uh, working on?”
We’ve missed seeing you at Kielder Library!
(Or even vaguely single?)
They probably weren’t fans of the humble sticky note.
“I thought this was going to be more of a dance scene,” she said and pushed herself into a sitting position. “It’s like, canapes and talking about the economy.”
Shaking the tears from his eyes, Harry turned back towards the castle. He flew towards the unmarried professors’ tower—God, it needed a better name—and towards the light. As he drew up to the lit window, he realized it wasn’t his room.
Harry had no idea how much time had passed. He was hot and his palms wouldn’t stop sweating. Wiping them once again on his faded black jeans, his fingers bumped against Malfoy’s leg. Malfoy shot up as though he’d been shocked.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Fuck off, Potter. One, I can find whatever I need, and two, I tip the elves extra extra at Christmas.”
Harry grinned and danced out of Florian’s reach.
His grey eyes were as flat and even as his voice.
Draco was blinking. “I would love to.”
She squinted one eye and rubbed it out with the edge of her cardigan.
Draco loved him.
Malfoy wasn’t breathing.
She fixed the pillow. Draco perched on the edge of the bed.
“You look better than her drawings,” Adina said seriously.
“Ah, Harry,” Minerva McGonagall smiled up at him and gestured to an empty seat on her left. As he sat, Prof—no, Filius—poured him a cup of tea and passed him the sugar bowl and creamer.
“Oh,” Neville said. “That didn’t even occur to me. Yeah, that makes more sense.”
Draco’s eyes widened.
Andy narrowed her eyes. “Artichokes, you pretentious asshole. But fine.” She picked up the phone, dialed from memory, then said, “Hey, Alf. Yeah, we want the usual. But then can you add a small veggie—”
“Thanks for the ice creams!”
Well, he still had perfect posture and cheekbones.
“Charming, darling, bet the boys love it when you do that,” Sirius said and winked. He could be a little shit, too.
He shrugged. “It’s fun watching you get all flustered. I can practically watch your thoughts get all stopped up.”
“Draco? As in, Draco Malfoy?”
“The damned spot.”
Tomorrow was going to be complicated.
Ron’s mouth twitched. Mum and he had spent a few minutes in the kitchen, prodding the burned and yet raw cake with their wands to spruce it up a bit, then realized it was hopeless, binned it, and whipped up another banana bread, compressing the baking time with magic, so that by the time they returned to the table with perfectly sliced, warm banana bread, no one had noticed they’d even been gone.
“Uh … you’re … not straight?”
He’d have to wait for the snitch to come to him. Which, statistically speaking, was unlikely.

It had been, what, eight? nine? years, since Blaise had set eyes on him.
Thanks for your e-mail (email is also acceptable). You have successfully completed the assignment.
“Oh, Potter,” Malfoy said in a soft voice, “but it so often is.”
That was kind of a non sequitur. She raised an eyebrow. She’d never been quite as good, and she could tell that she still hadn’t quite gotten it right from the way his left eye narrowed.
Harry’s head shot up. “No,” they said, “I assumed he would be but, well, I don’t know.” They leaned against the bar and slowly rotated the glass. “He, er, came to Conciliatio with Nev, and he’s still on parole, so he’s got to take this non-magical studies class but like, he discovered the internet, and, look, he brought me my coconut back.”
Harry undid the bands and opened it. There were magical duplications of documents written in spindly old handwriting, a magical photograph of a dignified and elderly couple labeled “Monty and Effie”—were those his grandparents?— and snippets from the Daily Prophet and other wizarding newspapers, all about the Potdar family and then the Potter family, his parents’ wedding announcement, and—
“Blaise uses he/him,” Neville said. “He’s—I—so I met him at this conference in London, just by chance, he was grabbing a drink at the bar with a friend and recognized me—recognized me—”
Then there was a bark from the other room, followed by a hissing noise.
There was another silence. Ok. She made a mental note to email Jason, but that was it, ok.
“Oh,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t know how to do that.” He still had occasional nightmares about Madam Pince.
Draco paused again. “I think the rainbow flags all over my classroom tend to help, but,” he shrugged again. “Maybe it’s the introductory session on how we’ve got to read diversity and inclusion from in between the lines of history written by straight, white, cis men? And I’m certainly a white man, so they’re probably guessing between the straight and cis, unless they’ve just assumed I’m extremely liberal or generous, but they know I’m a Slytherin, so they probably assume it’s out of self-interest, and then most of the children probably aren’t thinking that deeply about it. Regardless—”
“And,” Hermione said, “since we don’t yet have a medicinal form of male birth control, this is something that evens the playing field in terms of pregnancy risk in heterosexual relationships. You both should be participating in safe sex!”
“It’s happened,” Neville said and kissed his forehead. “But the point is that it has nothing to do with what you look like. It’s all about how you make me feel, and, I hope, how I make you feel.”
There was a little frustrated huff near the door.
“Hug,” he said, put his wand back in his pocket, and embraced her.
It wouldn’t hurt to ask Draco if he’d heard anything from Blaise, though.
“Anyway, Malfoy, what are we going to do about this?”
Teddy flew up to him, grabbing his arm in a clumsy dismount, and gave Harry a long look. “You and Uncle Draco have the same Patronus species,” he said seriously. “Drommy told me that’s something that happens when you get married.”
He didn’t speak as they made their way to the staff room. Malfoy threw a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace and held out his hand.
l o l rite
Malfoy looked as though he’d forgotten he had a sandwich. He picked it up, then put it down again. “When you say cupboard, you mean a small room, right?”
“Thank you,” Harry whispered back.
Padma shrugged and continued: “She got a job doing translations for British wizards in India. One of them took a shine to her and hired her for a translation job at the Wizengamot. I guess my dad ran up to her and grabbed her hand just as the international Portkey went off. And then he didn’t have any documents, so they got married as soon as they landed in London. Like, they were already engaged, but. You know.”
The rest of him was, to put it mildly, a surprise. Draco’s hair was already receding (Blaise felt a vicious spike of elation), or maybe it was coming out in patches (and he felt guilty), and he was wearing jeans, trainers, and a t-shirt with some 5k logo.
Neville was still standing squarely in front of Blaise. Like he was protecting him from the Malfoy on the steps of their castle; Blaise barely had time to shake himself for that ridiculously romantic thought before Neville had turned and muttered, “Are you ok, babe?”
selfish selfish lol
When the alarm went off the next morning, Harry groaned. He wished Dean was here to throw pillows at him until he got up. God, he missed sleeping near people. It wasn’t even a sexual thing. He just felt so … lonely. Eight years of dormitory life was heaven to a little boy who’d spent most of his childhood alone, under the stairs.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said, “I won’t let anything happen to you.”
We love you.
He seemed pleased, though, and bumped his hip against Harry’s as he leaned in again for a closer look.
Jesus, Andre had made him hot. He’d shortened the hair on the sides of his head and cleaned up the top bit, so it looked slightly damp but in a cool and carefree way. Fuck, he wasn’t half-bad looking.
His granddad had been murdered.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“That's speculation,” Harry said irritatedly. “You don’t really know that it’s true about my family in particular.”
Found his elbow in Malfoy’s steadying hands. Again.
The snide tone in his voice made Harry leap to his feet.
“It does, sir! How can you even like someone until you know them, like, really know them, and that doesn’t really have anything to do with what bits they have or whatever!” Perry seemed a bit outraged.
“Yeah,” Harry said with a grin. “He’s convinced that was his whole come-to-Jesus moment, like we had magic, but non-magical people invented the internet.”
Malfoy was breathing heavily (not that fit, Harry thought childishly and inaccurately), and he tensed his abs while craning his neck up to look at Harry.
His lip curled.
Rubbish, he thought, and urged his broom upwards. But he felt better as he got into bed. Christmas was tomorrow. That made everything feel better. That and the flying. Nothing else.
Lavender turned it over in her fingers. “Yeah,” she said to Astoria. “That’s why it didn’t fucking work.”
He was waiting to perform until she had indicated what emotion would be acceptable in this situation.

“Why’d you ask me?” Andre said and handed Harry a cup of spiked hot chocolate.
♚ 13.03.07.
It was the second week of December, and they were supposed to be taking names of students who wanted to stay at Hogwarts over Christmas. God knows why but Minerva had tasked the two of them to sit in the Great Hall (seniority, she would have responded) all Saturday and gather names. Harry had brought a stack of papers to mark, but Malfoy wouldn’t shut up about when the newest Tana French was going to come out.
Draco’s Latin hadn’t rusted in Azkaban.
“I have my fucking hand around the snitch.”
“I know it’s a bit odd—”
“Wait, seriously?” Harry was shocked. “Molly would be over the moon to get another son-in-law. She dotes on her boys! And even more on the boys that she got later in life!” He paused. “I guess Percy hasn’t been around since Ginny came out, though. Molly tried to knit a sweater that says “Proud Mom to Gay Kids” but it came out a bit lumpy and looks like it says “Proud Gay Mom” but like, she still wears it.”
“Yes, thank you, Moony,” Sirius said. “When I die, you, Harry, will technically be responsible for Malfoy within the House of Black, but I don’t think that it creates some kind of familial relationship. Otherwise you’d be a god-cousin but second? A second-god cousin?”
“There isn’t anywhere else … there wasn’t anyone else we could think of,” Sirius said lamely.
It didn’t feel like enough because
The judges conferred, then Edna withdrew the third-place ribbon. A buzzing filled his ears. No one turned towards him, so it wasn’t his. Then second place. Again, nothing.
“It’s for my next book?” Draco said a bit faintly.
“Oh, no, no, no, no, no,” she whispered, pressing her hands together and then against her eyes and then together.
“I don’t think it worked,” Astoria said, fighting to keep the panic from her voice. “I, um—Susan—”
“Does he—does it, like, come back?” Susan asked, reaching one hand across the table.
Padma and Hagrid exchanged looks.
Harry shrugged and sipped the coffee and gagged.
“He’s not like thirteen anymore, so he’s probably not a git.” Fleur studied Harry’s face. “An asshole, maybe. What happened?”
They sat down to a game of charades, but Andromeda and Harry kept losing track of what they were supposed to be acting out and got thoroughly trounced by Elen and Ted. Harry didn’t know why Andromeda would be so worried about Draco—unless she was afraid that she and Elen had somehow poisoned him and they’d have to face the wrath of Narcissa—but he couldn’t stop thinking about the two glowing patronuses circling each other in the dark cavernous space of the ballroom.

The blood was rushing in his ears.

“You’re more of a wine ‘em and dine ‘em, I’m sure,” Harry said around a mouthful of sandwich. “Fancy champers and all that shit. Caviar. Silk sheets.”
Harry ran one hand through his wet hair and shook his head a bit. He was going for a “Muggle perfume ad of a dude getting out of a pool” look. But shit, that guy never had glasses. Now his glasses were spattered with water and he couldn’t really see and his wand was still in the bathroom. Placing one hand firmly on the towel, he walked across the room and bent to his dresser.
“What.” Harry said stupidly. “Why can’t Padma?”
“TEN!”
“He’s just a bit weak,” Malfoy said. “Not used to exercise.”

Malfoy tilted his head and looked at him consideringly. “Seekers’ challenge?”
Her dad was from Ventura, California. He’d dropped acid in London, knocked up Susan’s mum, and fucked off to Australia before she’d realized she was pregnant. Cue several years of detectives and spells until he’d walked into Susan, literally kicked her in the back of the head by accident because he was looking at the top of the Nelson monument and she was sitting underneath it on a school field trip and her mum, summoned by the magical flare he’d inadvertently triggered, had screamed so many bad words that Mrs. McNulty had to send a letter home of apology with the rest of the year fours. But then there was some kissing, and he’d moved in the next week and made them eat hummus and do yoga and polluted Susan’s brain with strange words.
He’d promised Draco a trip to Edinburgh for stickies, novels, and—Harry had to mentally take a deep breath at this part—the props for the sex ed panel. Minnie and the rest of the profs had approved of it immediately. And then it was on the calendar. And then it was next Friday afternoon. Like, tomorrow.
“My dancing didn’t convince you?” Harry said and wiggled his hips.
“We’ll be in the potting shed,” he rumbled. “Come along, Mrs. Malfoy.”
“Mhm,” Remus said, returning to the crossword. “Consider chewing, because I’m the only one who knows the Heimlich maneuver here, and I am very invested in this crossword right now.”
?!” Harry shouted as he read the proposed cuts.
“I thought I could paint your nails,” Lavender said. Astoria smiled at her. “I brought you green, pale pink, and a nice ochre since it’s October.”
He thought he heard a knock, but he might have been dreaming.
“Yes?” Malfoy smiled. “I heard it’s the done thing to support all of one’s students.” He paused and gave Harry a once-over. “Though I don’t see that you’ve ascribed to that suggestion.”
“But?”
“Everyone else is like,” they waved a hand around the party, “paired up and they’re not budging because it’s getting closer and closer to midnight.”
Her face lit up and she said, “Thank you, Professor Malfoy,” and then buried her face in the book, flipping to chapter five immediately. Harry felt a hand on his elbow steering him towards the drinks table.
She stared down at Harry and continued: “Was it that his dissertation was on anti-fascist movements in Muggle and Wizarding modern history? That that dissertation’s been published as a best-selling book in five languages? That the introduction to that book made me cry because he writes so heartbreakingly about how he thought if he could just conform to his family’s fascist ideology, they’d love and accept him even though he’s gay? When he thought you’d died and—” she broke off and pressed her hands together, touched them to her lips, and then pointed at him. “Harry, you have to read it.”
She bit her lip. She couldn’t ask if Malfoy was gay. She and Ron had debated that back and forth from the moment they’d finished reading Ginny’s owl. It was definitely rude to ask, because even though both of them were bi, they went to the Thursday meetings sporadically, and it felt like a breach of confidence to ask Harry or anyone else to out Malfoy. If he was out at all.
Astoria nodded.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
“Up here, on the left.” He announced the password—earwig—to a dour fourteenth-century jester whose portrait swung to the side to reveal a polished wooden door and a spiral stone staircase.
“A bit like that,” Draco said and slid the paper across to her.
“So it wasn’t an accidental mating?”
“Uh,” Harry said, when Draco broke in and said, “We were making out in your closet and didn’t realize everyone had left.”
Harry made a face.
“I used to struggle with a lot of anger,” Potter reveals, “Especially when I realized I had to kill Voldemort and when I found out I was a Horcrux. But I’ve been in therapy for years. Which kinda helps. But I think getting older helped a lot, too. And being able to change the shitty parts of the world—or to try, anyway—definitely also helps.”
“Do you think they’ve gone off to get us things, then?” Draco said, practically rolling over on the counter.
But Harry was trying to think of something to say that didn’t mention Malfoy’s abs, arse, or arms, none of which were visible at this moment, so citing them would imply that Harry had been considering said body part for a while, which was not, absolutely not, the vibe he wanted to give off to a colleague. Just because he was hot didn’t mean he deserved to be sexually harassed on the stairs outside his bedroom. Even if he did say Harry was handsome. That could be a work-appropriate comment.
By colleagues he means the dragons. Asked for advice to give to our readers, Weasley mused for a few moments, then grinned and said, “It’s great! You can really focus on what you’re into—whether that’s international trade law, making ice cream, embroidery, or, the best thing in the entire world, dragons!”

On the eve of the eighth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, the Hero of the Wizarding World, Harry James Potter, agreed to sit down with
in gold letters across the front.

idk perc says lots of peeps there take shit
Remus kissed Sirius’ hand perfunctorily, then said, “I believe you need to dissect the child so we can indulge in a spot of light cannibalism.”
“Makes you easy to feed, love,” Sirius said with a lascivious wink. “Now that I’m a kept man and you lock me in the kitchen all day.”
He had a sudden flashback to finding Malfoy in the bathroom, sobbing into the sink. He’d been so pale then, and so skinny, and his whole frame had been wracked with his sobs. It had sounded like Malfoy was retching. And then Harry had—and then he’d used Sectumsempra, without even knowing—and then there was blood everywhere—and Harry had something in his eyes now and was blinking furiously. He wasn’t going to take his glasses off. That would be admitting he was crying. At himself. In Ron and Hermione’s bathroom.
“To make sure you weren’t doing anything evil!” Harry almost shouted. Why did things just leap out of his mouth around Draco?
“And how, exactly, do you calculate that?”
The WAWFAN meeting with Draco was a success. He’d sidled in five minutes early, poured himself a cup of tea, and settled into an armchair at the back. He didn’t push in or make himself known, but when Justin crowed, “And we have a new face, so let’s all welcome Professor Malfoy,” he did a little wave. And then he was mobbed after the meeting. Harry could barely see his blonde hair popping out from the crowd of students surrounding his chair.
Between ‘Dirty Little Secret’ and ‘Hey There Delilah,’ Malfoy appeared at Harry’s side.
k just dont get weird about it
Hermione took the proffered hand and shook it. “Your article about the inhumane working conditions of gillyweed harvesters was groundbreaking,” she said. Harry shot Draco a look. Draco caught his eye and shrugged a little.
“Draco, please,” he said, jutting a hand towards her.
Malfoy cleared his throat and fixed his cuffs. He wasn’t wearing his black robes, just a white Oxford without a tie and charcoal grey trousers.
One Sunday, pacing his room like a caged tiger (he didn’t dare to go out flying, for fear of running into Draco in Quidditch leathers), Harry remembered Hermione’s words—
Draco nodded.
“Ugh,” she said, “Don’t call me that.” They air kissed, and Pansy snuggled herself into Draco’s side.
“Welcome—”
“Hm,” Draco said and moved towards the door, “I’ll just take your hat.” He plucked it out of Harry’s hands before he could protest. “You have a hood.”
It was the aurors, Narcissa knew, and turned. “I’ll go quietly, just let me—”
be dramatic about it.
“How’s it been with Malfoy, you know, at the meetings?”
Harry didn’t see Draco for days. The elves told him that he was holed up in his room, “Writing, sir, lots of papers flying about,” and consuming large amounts of toast with Marmite. Harry could barely believe that Draco would eat Marmite, but he also knew that Kreacher had no incentive to drag Draco’s eating habits.
“As many of you know, we’ve decided to hold her back from Hogwarts a year because she’s still getting outbursts of temperamental magic, but she’s rather glum about another year at primary even though she’s halfway through already and it would be just lovely if you all could come and get her excited about next year!”
Narcissa shrugged. “I don’t remember.”
Then Draco did something strange. His long, pale fingers flew over the jumble of digestives and jaffa cakes and rich teas, and then they were all sorted by type, overlapping in a circle around the plate, presided over by a small pyramid of the custard creams.
22⟞ ⧉ thurs night social club
“I just, I don’t know why they went to see Malfoy instead of coming here.” Harry shut their eyes.
The mug of tea warmed her hands. “Audrey’s much better. Transparent. Big ideas. Clear values. Nothing is just allowed to,” she cast about for the right set of words, “exist because of tradition. Or serve some secret world-saving but fucked up purpose.”
“Draco, shush,” Audrey said, pointing a finger at Harry. “Don’t move.”
Draco turned up on Friday afternoon, his arms full of papers.
“Sorry,” he said, pushing a mug of tea towards her. “You just, I don’t know. Sorry.”
Harry laughed, and then the two of them were laughing hysterically and wiping away tears—of joy, of sorrow, it was a bit unclear. Andre walked him to the door and batted his hands away from his hair.

“Hands in the air!” Britney shrieked suddenly, throwing her arms up. Elspeth followed a beat behind, looking supremely unsure about the entire thing.
Getting glitter in your eye was a fucking pain. Someone should invent some kind of eye-repellent makeup, which would be fairly simple if you modified its base to be repellent to a particular type of protein that appeared only in the eye with a tracking or repellent spell, but Fleur sighed, remembered she’d given up on chemistry, and refocused.
Neville looked like he didn’t believe her.
Heads flicked between them, watching the volleys.

“I bet, babe,” Lavender said, rubbing Astoria’s cheek. “You look a lot better than you did though. You were literally grey the last time I saw you. It was scary and also gross.”
That’s when he saw a shock of white-blond hair.
Best wishes,
“Potter, really,” Malfoy scoffed. “What is this, broom-borne yoga amateur hour?”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “I can’t tell if you’re trolling me or not.”

Harry closed his hand over Malfoy’s wrist. His mouth was dry. This was so much worse than he’d imagined.
The evening of the Winter Ball was crisp and clear. A soft white snow covered the Hogwarts grounds. The students had been given Friday off after lunch, and the hallways were oddly silent in the hours leading up to the Ball. Harry’d done a bit of grading and then realized it was almost half-seven and sprinted to his room to get dressed.
ahhh???
─────── ⎎ ───────
Sirius nudged Remus’ thigh under the table. Remus nudged him back.
Harry grumbled and fiddled with his wand.
Malfoy hacked up a bite of sandwich.
Draco waved his hand again. “A momentary shock of genius. You must have briefly channeled the spirit of Oscar Wilde.”
“Uh, what book?” Harry said with a shaky laugh. Surely Audrey wouldn’t have allowed her offspring to read the salacious Rita Skeeter faux-biography.
Bending over it, he realized that Draco was suddenly right behind him, practically leaning into him as he craned his pale neck to look at the moving dots.
Harry ground his teeth. No students had come for a good forty minutes, and he was just about to strangle Malfoy.
“Blaise,” Neville said, and wrapped him in his arms, pressing his forehead against Blaise’s. “You are a wonderful human who happens to be super funny and bizarre and I love how you like salty licorice and want to save all the alley cats and the way you kiss my left shoulder when I’m driving and the way that when I’m in bed with you, I feel like everything in the world is going to be fine, whether it’s because we just had amazing sex or you farted in my face—”
“Sticky notes,” Harry said with an air of resignation. Draco had traveled the wizarding world but was still like a fawn in the muggle one.
“You’d think she came up with that,” Draco whispered to Harry. His breath was hot on Harry’s ear.
The girl wasn’t wrong, Narcissa thought with irritation as she stood. She hesitated, then kicked her shoes off and ran towards the house.
Re: Welcome 2 the interwebz
“And the salt!” she yelled after Sirius. He gave her a two-fingered salute. “Charming.”
“Draco, give it,” she ordered, holding a hand out.
“They’re married?”
“Hey,” Neville said with a smile. “I brought Draco.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t watch him. That’s bonkers.” Padma snorted. “Ok, no, you know what, fine, I watch everyone. It’s not just him. My past fuels paranoia. C’mon, Padma.”
“Not like this.”
“He’s being sarcastic,” Andromeda said, without turning around. “That’s his voice.”
“Are you wearing eyeliner?”
She didn’t even need the sparklers. Her smile was enough.
“I love you, too,” he mumbled.
“A good fuck you to Daddy.”
Twenty minutes later, he was tucked into bed, with Kreacher and Winky flurrying about him and a Malfoy draped across his armchair.
“I just thought it was a myth. Like a romantic reason to fight Voldemort. Love prevails and all that.”

“I’m so glad you’re here,” Parvati said. She sounded like she meant it. Even after that wine-drunk kiss that led to nothing and nowhere. “You can meet Hector.”
“I eat way too much ice cream already,” Florian said with a shrug. He spun around to take in the space.
“Put that in the minutes, mind,” Harry said, tapping Malfoy’s book. “Charity begins at home.” He knew what the minutes were, now. Not that he’d read them. But he knew that Malfoy wasn’t just taking devious notes in a giant book. He was trying, God forbid, to be helpful.
“You know, Otto, I think I feel like an outing today, too,” Andromeda said. “Let me just get my hat.”
Gesturing at the tomato, which Malfoy hurriedly wiped away with his hand, he shrugged. “You know, cooking, cleaning, gardening, whatever. When they let me out.”
Otherwise, eat a shitload of pudding
and longtime girlfriend of Quidditch star (and Potter’s ex) Ginny Weasley, “found this amazing place that used to be an apothecary and it has the best windows.” Potter pauses, roll halfway to their mouth, and stares into the distance. “I think they’re like … uh, well, in the non-magical world they’re called bay windows, but I don’t know if there’s a magical word for them.”
Tilting his head, Harry had the sensation that they weren’t talking about covert operations in the muggle world. But he didn’t want to press it, so he confined himself to: “Really?”
He fought the urge to shove Malfoy into the wall.
“It’s magical pomade. Just stop messing about with it and it’ll look good for a week.”
“Right,” Harry said again, ignoring the burst of warmth along his left side. “Books first. You’ve got thirty minutes at Waterstones. That’s it.”
There was some silence. Well, it could hardly be called silence when they were surrounded by a wall of conversation, Celestina Warbeck, the sounds of children’s shrieks, and the occasional pop of a cracker.
Harry scrunched his face. “I’ve never done Diwali.”

Starr had an entire box filled with different sex toys, packers, lubes, condoms, harnesses, plastic models of reproductive systems, dental dams, packets of birth control, and they were walking Draco through each of item, explaining pros, cons, what was accurate and what wasn’t. Harry leaned against the counter and watched the two of them.
Harry took a sip of tea and was surprised that it was exactly how he liked it. He glanced over at Draco’s cup, which was black. Fuck, she had been watching them.

“You know, this came out like two months ago.”
“Ooh, wow, aren’t you a bright wizard,” Harry said mockingly, and accioed a piece of paper. “Look, now I’ve got paper.”
“Well, we certainly didn’t want him.” Remus glared back at Harry. “We didn’t think we could handle trying to reintegrate him into society. But it’s necessary. We can’t just let him sit in Azkaban forever.”
“Oh, you little shit,” Sirius said fondly, “mock the old man.”
Sirius sucked his cheeks in. “With Andromeda.” As though that explained something, anything, like he’d be safe with Andromeda, whose own daughter had died—in a battle, fine, but it wasn’t like she was the optimal choice for childcare.
And half the time, it felt like he’d only ended up on the right side of history through a combination of luck, sheer pigheadedness, and having spectacularly bad enemies—that is, the grace of having enemies who were mostly irredeemably evil. Voldemort, Umbridge, Lucius, Bellatrix had all been pure evil.
“Babe, can you just transfigure it?” Neville asked. He had samples to classify. This fashion trip wasn’t his idea of a fun Saturday morning, but the aurors weren’t expanding the list of people who could apparate Draco. Which was fucking dumb, because it was almost nine months after he’d been released and he hadn’t done anything evil, so either he was really good at the long con, or maybe he wasn’t as dangerous as the Ministry thought.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked over his body and then firmly settled on the floor.
Entirely uncaring, he narrowed his eyes. Why did Malfoy look like an angel at a distance?
Draco sounded half-resigned and half-pleased as he said, “Fine, alright, fine.”

Harry felt sweat break out on his forehead.
He slammed the door shut. Pansy twitched.
“You’re also more fragile for the week or so after my transformations, because you’ve spent a lot more time in canid form which, if you ever listened to me, isn’t a good idea because your body is also becoming less flexible with age, but you never—”
He didn’t move his arm. Harry couldn’t move his hand away. Malfoy’s skin was so pale, almost translucent. The Mark didn’t move. He could remember a time when touching the Mark would have pierced his skull with pain. But it didn’t have power anymore. They lost. He’d won. He was free, but the past kept reaching out and dragging itself into his life.
“A lot of this stuff’s like, more recent,” Harry said, pushing the photostat of his parents’ wedding photograph towards him.
A person wearing a pink t-shirt emblazoned with the same lipstick print appeared from the back of the shop and glided towards them. A big pin proclaimed “they/them,” and their name tag read “Starr.”
“She can’t even, like, talk yet,” Cho said in an undertone.
He lifted his chin and looked straight at Harry. With his mouth set in a firm line and his nose upturned, Draco looked every inch the haughty Malfoy heir Harry had met in Madam Malkin’s. But he could see Draco’s glass trembling, knocking the bubbles off-kilter as they streamed upwards.
Harry nodded, focusing his mind on the golden shimmer.
Draco shut his eyes and exhaled through his nostrils. “Do you know how hard it is to not say something filled with innuendo right now,” he said flatly. “You’re inviting me to your room after dinner to talk.”

The next question came from Shuo, who was wringing his hands with anxiety and stumbled over the first few words. “Ms. Granger-Weasley, and anyone else on the panel that this applies to, how do you handle being in an intercultural relationship? Does the fact that you grew up muggle and your husband grew up wizarding have an impact on the day-to-day of your relationship or sex life?”
It was Malfoy’s.

Ron and Harry exchanged a glance and then yelled, “FUCK!” at the same time.

“Look, it’s like radio, but with the internet. Anyway, this isn’t what I’m trying to talk to you about.”
Blaise tapped his microphone and said, “That goes for you too, gay kids. No condom, no dice. Many STIs can be cured, but some can’t. Wizards haven’t come up with anything better than a good muggle rubber, so use them.”
Harry squinted at Malfoy. What was he hinting at? Why was he smiling?

Ron put his scone down and leaned forward. “Blaise is an Unspeakable. I think he’s like, head of some division or something. They sent him up here with me because he’s the Ministry’s expert on magical jewels? Ah, shit, maybe I wasn’t supposed to say that. Don’t tell anyone,” he said, pointing a finger at Harry. “I mean, I trust you, but don’t tell anyone anyway.”

Harry opened his mouth and Kreacher shoved a thermometer inside, shaking his head with a dour look. “Mr. Potter is not allowed to be unwell,” he said sternly. “Who will I bother when you are dead?”
“Harry, you did what you could. The Wizengamot was out for blood.”
“Potter, I saw it happen.”
“He has such a good parent voice already,” Hermione agreed. “I’m hoping mine will like, come with the pregnancy. Or the birth. As long as I get one eventually.”
“Yeah,” Neville breathed.

The questions kept coming and coming and Harry hoped Draco was timing the event, because he’d abandoned Sirius’s organizer in his room and then he zoned back in and realized the panel was talking about how they knew they were in love.
“What? My dad?”
Neville swallowed. “I guess.”
Harry tilted their head. “I don’t get it.”
This was veering into dangerous territory. He’d come here to make sure Malfoy was fine, which he clearly was, eating the sandwich like a ravenous hippogriff, until Harry had opened his fat mouth about something he really, really didn’t want to talk about.
Astoria poured herself a plastic cup of the shitty wine Harry had provided and settled into the couch which was, somehow, already musty. The Conciliatio offices had been open for what, three months? She drew out her wand and muttered a freshening incantation.
against the dark arts for a reason,” she said, glaring at the fireplace. “For far too long it was about learning the dark arts, under the guise that knowledge was power against them. But it’s not! All evil things work in fundamentally the same way! You don’t need years of education to know that!”
“Is that—” Remus snatched Kreacher’s latest offering out.
Malfoy swallowed. Harry was put in mind of a snake unhinging its jaw. He could practically see the lump move down his throat. “No, the no-strings-attached stuff.”
“How did you, like, know?”
Britney shook her head and smiled fondly at her. “It’s a metaphor; we reviewed this, and the most common euphemisms, like lollipops are—” The introductory beat of ‘1, 2 Step’ saved Harry from hearing the rest of that sentence as she screamed with joy and dragged Elspeth to the dancefloor. Elspeth was trying to copy Britney’s moves. Trying so hard. It was precious. Britney put her hands on Elspeth’s hips to try to establish a rhythm, but the minute she took them away, Elspeth was back to irregular jolting. Harry felt a surge of protectiveness.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Jesus, Malfoy, what are you doing?” Harry scrambled to find a jumper and closed the window with a spell across the room.
She used the whole thing.
“I did n—oh.” Harry was hit with a memory of Britney egging him on.
it was actually nev’s choice, so u can blame him. we’re going dancing after obvs so practice your moves don’t want to let down the honor of slytherin lol bet salazar had some sickkkkk moves
“Neville’s friends with Draco?”
“Harry, that’s so sweet of you,” Astoria said, since Draco was sitting there like a lump. “Why don’t you show Draco how it works?”
“It isn’t what matters about a family.” Sirius looked at Harry and Remus with a sudden fierceness. “Love is what matters.”
He saw it, smiled slightly, and poured her another cup of tea.
“Baby?” Draco half-whispered.
Neville finished his piece of toast, considering this. “He has been asking a lot of questions about plant reproduction lately.”
Remus pinched the bridge of his nose. “I know what you’re doing, Kreacher, and I will not be distracted from my interrogation.”
“Oh?”
Without meaning to, his eyes flicked down to Malfoy’s lap. Malfoy pressed his lips together until they went white and crossed his legs suddenly and adjusted his robes.
“And how does that make you feel?”
Our darling Harry is out there forcing
“The Ministry of Magic said they were more worried about someone killing him than him, uh, perpetrating more crimes,” Sirius said. “I mean, he still sounds like a shit, but—”
𝔅𝔢𝔯𝔱𝔯𝔞𝔪 𝔚𝔬𝔬𝔡𝔰𝔢𝔩𝔩
“You’re bi, right?”
“Perry, are you on drugs?” Harry hadn’t wanted to confront anyone about drugs ever; that wasn’t his job, really, even if they did talk about the American program D.A.R.E. and the sociopolitical implications of the crack cocaine epidemic.
Pansy broke a piece off her scone. “Skeeter thinks we’re elves. Or vampires.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
She rolled her eyes. “You’re wearing eyeliner.”
Hagrid patted Harry on the shoulder and almost sent him into the table. “Don’t worry, ‘Arry, he’s changed.”
“The Victoria sponge, by a Mr. Ronald—ah, of course, it’s a Weasley—” but Edna was grinning at that, and then in a voice he couldn’t have guessed was hiding in a four-foot eight woman, boomed, “CONGRATULATIONS RONALD!”
Lavender put her hand to her head, widened her eyes at Astoria, and mouthed, “What the fuck?”
“Did you really invent the bra fitting charm?”
“Do you have some butter?”
15th March, 2007
Harry wished they’d practiced this a bit.
“No, I’m fine,” Harry said at last, a bit unsure if Malfoy was still there. His voice was still a bit wobbly. “Just got into one of these loo books.”
Hermione’s eyes widened.
“Anyway, since these students could clearly use someone who has more than half a brain to guide them through the complicated process of coming out in magical society—”
“Oh, the robes aren’t gonna work?” Andromeda’s smile was too broad. Her voice was just a tad too innocent, and, of course, she’d been a Slytherin. And a Black.
He flopped back into his chair and sighed.
Remus fought the urge to roll his eyes. “I’m a GP. Who is currently married to the bloke who’s got a UK top 20 single.”
Draco sat down at the table. This was not going according to plan. Sirius wanted to tackle Andy first. Alone.
“Er? Who?” Neville glanced at her, then returned to serving himself roast beef. “Louis?”
Lavender and Harry blinked at her.
Harry rolled his eyes at the door, finished his ablutions (he didn’t look that splotchy, and he didn’t run into Malfoy on the way back to the living room, so no one was the wiser), tucked himself into the sofa, and had the best sleep he’d had in months.
Malfoy pursed his lips. “Well, I was a shit about it.”
They were just kids.
Addie dissolved into giggles and crashed into Padma’s chair.
They sipped their tea.
“I mean, if anything, I think he’s my fourth cousin once removed or something, so I supposed by some kind of blood purist point of view, I should feel compelled to help him, but—” Luna paused and closed her eyes.
“Well,” Sirius said, “we’re going to have a quiet Christmas Eve, just me and Remus and some of our presents—”
“So,” Sirius said, rubbing his chin. Remus liked the stubble, but it was a bit long for him now. But his public. Well, fuck the public. He was lazy. That was the real problem. Right, to the theme. “So Lucius—”
“Care to explain why you’re talking to me again? Couldn’t resist my charms?”
or drugs anonymous
They weren’t supposed to do this for two weeks. This had absolutely ruined his lesson planning. He’d have to move forward the staging, which meant costumes, which meant his weekend would be spent magicking up panniers and hose. Malfoy was going to pay for this.
But the good kind. The very, very good kind.
✰ ✰ ✰ ✰ ✰
Harry whipped his hand away from Malfoy. This was definitely a joke. But maybe it wasn’t? But maybe it was? Malfoy seemed to have gotten ahold of himself a bit and cleared his throat again. He was determinedly staring right at Harry’s chest. That sort of implied it wasn’t a joke, right?
Mum sidled over and patted his arm.
Harry stared at the juice and blinked. “I think we know who we want to be with at fourteen, but it’s usually not the same person you want to be with when you’re nineteen. Or twenty-six.”
“I took the Mark for him.”
I look forward to hearing about your progress. Our office has been unable to unearth further precedents.
Draco smiled one of his pointy grins. “Zabini.”
Draco Malfoy
Harry lost his fucking mind with excitement. “God! YES!”
Everything was just peachy.
entrenched in the idea that magic users just need to learn how to “pass” long enough in the non-magical world if they get “stuck” until they can escape back into the magical world. Hence Dawlish’s pressure on me to include “beauty” as a key component of non-magical identity education; I’ve tried to massage the lesson, but ugh. It subtly reinforces the division between the worlds, because the magical world is just as influenced by the same Eurocentric beauty standards, but I’m not supposed to get into
“I mean, the war is over and we’re, well, Greg and I are officially rehabilitated, but there’s, you know. Lingering resentment. But it’s ok because night baking, and then we just go home before the bakery opens.”
He couldn’t think about anything else.

Malfoy rose quickly and stormed out of the room the minute it was over. He had abandoned his quill, Harry noticed, picking it up and twirling it in his fingers. The minutes were unfinished. Harry pulled the book towards him and scratched in:
“Does that matter?” He couldn’t handle strong emotions this early.
“Yeah, and you stalked him. All year. That wasn’t entirely necessary.”
“Look, Malfoy, what are we talking about?”
A tear blurred the green ink.
HAHA WOW
Harry had whiplash.
Her husband smiled at her.
“Ah, yeah, well,” Sirius said, shooting a glance at Andromeda’s back, “she didn’t quite know I was coming, either.”
Harry flapped one hand at her, then gathered the invisibility cloak around themselves, stood, and disappeared.
wait how are angie and baby artemis
Narcissa exhaled through her nose. “We didn’t
was great, except Hufflepuff was already first in the school Quidditch tourney. We’re impartial, though, so, good job, Puffs!
Hermione spilled out of the car shouting Harry’s name. Malfoy gathered the bags and hung back, letting them hug each other. She studied Malfoy for a moment, then pulled him in for an embrace; he wasn’t expecting it and stood stock still, clutching their packages.
“Ron,” Hermione said, approaching the table with a handsome man with dark curly hair and a very fucking cool short-sleeve button down shirt with frogs. “This is Jason, who was an intern with me at the Ministry, and now he does the non-magical education programs.”
Andre raised his eyebrows but mercifully didn’t comment and ushered him in.
Adjusting a red pointed hat and a long grey beard, Harry shuffled into the Great Hall. He hadn’t put much thought into the movement potential of the greyish-brown orb that surrounded his body. His knees banged against the transfigured cardboard with each step. Maybe Addie or Filius would have an idea of how to make it a bit more flexible.
He folded the parchment and dropped some sealing wax on it. He chirped to Ulula, his large tawny owl, who flapped her wings expectantly and hopped across to the desk. He’d chosen her specifically because her chattiness was so different than Hedwig’s stately and arch demeanor.
Yet, fifteen minutes later, that’s what they were doing.
Completed
“Oh, no, no, not morally. Horrible like, he doesn’t know what the fuck he’s doing.” Susan stared back at the letter. “Neville would have a better collecting season without him. But like, he has a heart the size of a, uh, dustbin or a breadbox or something.”
“I don’t have—” Draco glanced up with pleading eyes, “bad thoughts about homosexuals.”
Draco picked it up gently and watched Lily and James beam. He had his hands around her waist, and she was clutching her bouquet, and then behind them were Remus and Sirius and Harry’s grandparents and the Tonkses and Minnie, caught in an eternal loop of throwing rice into the air.
She turned to Hermione, who had one edge of her lip drawn between her teeth. Suddenly, Narcissa leaned forward and grabbed the other woman’s forearms. “You have to be sure they both have someone else in mind. It can’t be an abstract idea, of finding someone else you love, or the magic twists that fantasy into the person in front of you.”
nothiNG OK
“I haven’t,” he said eventually. “I was the help at my aunt and uncle’s.”
“You haven’t seen anything yet, darling,” Val said with a grin. “Shots?”
“What?”
“Thanks,” Harry choked, “for letting me know—”
“But, like, it’s fine if we do
Harry laughed. Was he the heir? He should probably look into that. He’d gotten occasional letters from the company, but he could have sworn his grandfather had sold it when he retired.
Without waiting for Malfoy, Harry kicked off. The first swoop was fantastic. It was futile to seek the snitch in the thick grey fog. Harry tried out some upside-down moves. God, he hadn’t flown since the summer, and his muscles ached already. They’d been flying for maybe two minutes.
Hi Bertram,
“Let’s start with the panel, alright,” Harry said with a murderous glare at Malfoy. He’d reverted to Malfoy, the malicious bastard who liked to drag him into these awkward situations.
Sirius slammed a platter of French toast down on the table. “Bon appetit, my most beloved godchild and my favorite sexy werewolf doctor husband.”
Neville glanced towards the ceiling.
“Sirius won’t let him be an asshat,” Bill said. “Plus he should know not to fuck with werewolves. We could get him.”
“Oh, Jason!” Hermione piped up.
“Potter,” Draco said in a reverent tone. “I hardly think the students will be put at ease by a footlong dildo.”

“You’ll need a hat,” he said at last. “We can’t use warming charms.”
“Andre, please. Tell him it’s ok. Tell him his parents miss him. Please. God. I’ll get Ron or Ginny or someone to write him.”
☞ [manicule, i.e., note]
Harry attempted to stare straight forward and look to his left to watch Malfoy at the same time. It was giving him a headache. Malfoy didn’t seem to be doing anything too untoward yet, just seducing people with his fake personality and his shiny hair. And worse, Malfoy wasn’t wearing a hat. His hatlessness was breaking the rules already. He intended to mention this to Padma, but she was staunchly ignoring him in favor of Hagrid and Flobberworms. Dinner and Minerva’s speech passed in a blur. He stood and waved when introduced (did he really need an introduction?), as did Malfoy. There was applause for him and for Malfoy, which seemed a bit insane. Only one of them had saved the wizarding world.
“Oh, no, no,” Sirius said, holding his hands up. “One of those super ethical Vane ones, where it only works if there’s already, emotions, or whatever.”
“Wasn’t so bad, was it?” he whispered and winked again.
Yeah, whatever that meant. Why did Andre keep bringing up Malfoy? (Why did Harry keep bringing up Malfoy?) Harry stuttered out his thanks and downed the rest of his cocoa. He paused for a minute looking at a few snapshots of Andre holding a baby and Audrey peering over his shoulder, an older black woman handing a cup to Andre (they were both dressed in Pride of Portree jerseys), Andre with a ginger man and Oliver Wood—
“The one who came up with the Licet charms?”
“What?”
“Can you get the car seat?” He had Victoire firmly by one hand. “I think Dad might have bought a car and he’s sure to want to take the kids. Plus it’ll be a good booster seat for dinner for some people.”
Malfoy pursed his lips. “‘An’ is the correct article, Potter.” He raised his eyebrows and shrugged. “And I always thought it would be great fun to be a dandy, between the powdered wigs, silk waistcoats, and the rotten teeth and gout. Of course, you’d know all about this, given how the latter two weren’t understood by Muggles until well into the twentieth century.”
Harry rubbed his forehead. “Why do you think Luna would be good?”
Hermione scrutinized Harry’s face. They were looking … not quite happier, really, but more at ease and less frazzled than they had in some time. Even with glitter dandruff.
k lol
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Fucking love, dude.” Harry cracked his knuckles. “That’s what saved me. My mum, she loved me so much, Voldemort’s Avada Kedavra couldn’t hit me. That’s what the scar’s from,” he said, pushing his hair up.
Cho Chang straightened the brim of her pointed hat, took a deep breath, and opened the door.
— change slide —
He had to distance himself from this weird train of thought. He shouldn’t be feeling any kind of way one, about a colleague, and two, about Malfoy. Maybe if he stepped on Malfoy’s foot? Malfoy would be sure to be pissed off, and then it would be back to normal. So just as the final beats of the song played, Harry stepped down quite deliberately on Malfoy’s foot. Malfoy didn’t even curse, just winced a little. He seemed a bit far away.
She shook her head. “Just a little Irish blessing.”
lol ya ur probs right
but ya shes right
But this was just the thing he did and kept doing. The thing where he snapped back into aggression if he felt she was babying him. But he fucking deserved to be babied, if that’s what he thought kindness was.
“They have trouble adjusting sometimes,” Talbott said, “since they’re not really sure of their bodies in either form. Sometimes Audrey sleeps with Viv like that. It helps her settle.”
Which, of course, Potter immediately objected to. With an irritated tear of the delicious French bread, Potter corrected me—magical world, readers! To keep smashing that patriarchy, check out the sidebar feature!—about the future of Conciliatio, the charity they established to break down prejudices: “We’ve been working largely with students at Hogwarts and with young people across the magical world from a variety of transitory locations, so our next step isn’t exactly a paradigm shift, it’s more of a, uh,” and here, dear readers, Potter blushed and held out their hands in a gesture of adorably flustered confusion, “Uh, anyway, we’re getting a building in Diagon Alley.”
Harry wanted the floor to swallow him up. This was completely out of hand and now he was flashing his bare arse at a colleague and he still didn’t have one more iota of information regarding Malfoy’s syllabus, so this was really all quite a waste. This was not according to the Plan. As he bent down to the towel, he realized it was already wrapping itself back around his waist.

Draco elbowed him and turned his head halfway around to glare at him. There wasn’t room for more.
Malfoy shook hands with Filius and Pomona and looked down the table, nodding at each professor in turn—he knew them from the interview, the rat bastard—until he got to Harry. Malfoy’s smile went a bit stiff and then broadened. Harry gave him a quick two-fingered salute and then turned to his roasted sprouts.
“Potter, don’t be ridiculous. It’s half-ten. I’m not going to run about like I’m a student wrapped up in your silly little invisibility cloak with you peering in Audrey’s windows.”
idk perc said he was in a conference room idk
“Nice to see you, Draco,” Blaise said.
Hagrid boomed out a laugh on Harry’s other side.

The first question was from Elspeth, which surprised Harry, until he realized that “What are some commonalities and differences between wizarding and muggle birth control?” was a question he might have written on a practice O.W.L.

Draco curled into Harry’s armchair like it was his.
“It’s fine.”
Lavender would have done the reflexive bisexual peace sign but both her hands were full. “Cool, cool, cool.”
She shook her head. “You didn’t.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
Talbott laughed again. “That’s my girl.”
You could lead a horse to a stream, as Susan would say. She sniffed. Everything was so, so fucked. But all these little pieces had begun to add up to something and that was that there was a fourth heart. Whether it was requited or known or—she fought the urge to shake Draco by the shoulders—he might have killed Susan.
“Wait, how do you know?” And how did he know Harry preferred red wine?
Just wanted to check in with you about what Module 3 in the Respecting the Non-Magical World Curriculum is. I just had one of my monthly check ins with Draco and he just kept mumbling about “module 3” and he “didn’t know.” He seems disturbed by something that might have happened in class, or perhaps the content of the module?
“Well, I’d hardly like to waste the gold prize winner’s baking talent on something boring.”
“No!" Harry roared back. "My mum's white family raised me and the last thing they wanted to talk about was the fact that I was brown!"
He thrust out the napkin with the sandwich inside. Malfoy took it and padded over to his desk to unwrap it.
“I’ve been worried sick, being so close to Hogwarts! Usually the wards here keep everything in, but,” she made an angry little huffing noise.
Ron leapt up and grabbed Harry into a huge bearhug. “Harry!”
He was glad he’d said what he wanted to, because now he was crying too. Blaise nodded furiously, then buried his face in Neville’s shoulder.
Then for some reason, he opened his mouth again and said, “I used to watch you on it.”
“Or, you know, champagne or eggnog, but I assumed you wouldn’t be drinking because of Gabby, but, I don’t know what we’re supposed to be doing or not doing nowadays,” Angelina said.
“Yeah, but he has me and Pansy and he doesn’t want anything else right now, so, like, whatever.” He popped the crust into his mouth, and then said, half around it, “I couldn’t handle that at all.”
idk what he was doin
“I simply meant Accio Katafractaria,” he said blandly. As though butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth.
“Love,” Harry scoffed. “We’re coworkers and former arch-nemeses.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Blaise is like, what, a ministry official?”
Then he saw Malfoy watching him while pretending to be entirely uninterested.
Fleur felt her insides grow hot. It shouldn’t be allowed to wink at your wife while standing in an alleyway in Cairo. That should be a law. Against. That. A law. Fucking fuck. There wasn’t time to deal with that explosion of desire. They were late already.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Charades,” Kreacher insisted. “We must play charades now. It is tradition.”
Ron swallowed. They’d talked about this, the possibility of introducing someone else and this sounded like maybe it was an overture. He blinked away a vision of being sandwiched between them on a couch, in their bed, two sets of hands holding him and two mouths kissing him.
“Hope you’ve been practicing Ebublio, Potter.”
Harry waited, leaning back against one of the student desks.
I know Draco is taking some kind of non-magical world course through the Ministry, and think it might be helpful for anyone who’s working with one of your clients to get a copy of the syllabus or program. I think he wanted to discuss some of the topics (“modules”??) but I often didn’t quite understand what he was alluding to. It would be good to be more aware of the other parts of the probation program so we could provide a more integrated experience.
“FIVE!”
“Don’t worry,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I talked him down to just the sex ed panel. But now I’ve got to come up with two people for it.”
“Sure, Malfoy, sure.” Harry balled his hands into fists and released his fingers in an effort to not smack the small smile off Malfoy’s face.
His sheets were crisp and cold and empty.
Malfoy released his fingers and the snitch flew away.
The Heads of House—Filius, Audrey, Hagrid, and Bastian—led their first years from the Great Hall. The other students vanished in a stampede, and the teachers rose, nodding to each other as they headed to their quarters. Tired of waiting for Malfoy to finish his coffee (so he could follow him and make sure there wasn’t anything suspicious), Harry finally stood.
Talbott dropped his wand from Draco’s neck and settled into an armchair.
◼Plan spring recipes/menus
“Er, ok,” Ron said, glancing back at the judges. They each had a forkful of cake. It was approaching their mouths.
“Like, when Malfoy’s there, why did they go this year?”
“What?!”
Remus didn’t raise his eyes from the crossword. This was often how Harry began conversations they weren’t quite sure about and Sirius would do enough jumping in for both of them, so—
It wasn’t all good. God, there were so many nightmares. Screaming and crying and they were all a bit fucked up. But they were all there, together, and they made it through.
“I just, I don’t, I’m not sure,” Draco tried, then dropped his head into his hands.
Harry poured some into his hand, then looked at Draco.
She wasn’t sure Bill should just take that tone without knowing anything about what was happening, but it seemed to put Harry at ease as they settled back into the couch.
Re: Re: ur alcohol
Ron and Hermione were exchanging some coded looks but Harry decided to ignore that and ask for more tart. He deserved it.

Some twenty minutes later, Filius and Pomona had drifted away from the breakfast table. Minerva set down her teacup and stared evenly at her youngest professor.
P.S. Don’t forget to bless your local Grackle! Leave out some crusts soaked in milk on Christmas Eve (next to the carrots for the Klausian reindeer)!

ronald bilius weasley, 26, died tuesday at his residence in newton poppinford frOM LAUGHING AT HIS BEST FRIEND LIKE THE DICK HE IS
“You’re not with the Weasley girl?” Malfoy’s eyes were on his nails again and he sounded suspiciously casual, given his recent apoplectic outburst.
Pansy Parkinson swallowed and tucked a strand of her black bob behind her ear.
“You’ll have to tell Ron tomorrow, love.”
Ginny and Luna found each other. And Harry came out as bi. He’d started WAWFAN then, bolstered by Hermione’s frantic poster- and button-making, and even if the first meeting was just him, Dean, Seamus, Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Hermione, he was grateful. (Ron had thought it was the following Tuesday. He’d been left to his own devices and had fallen asleep down in the Quidditch shed. Ron slept a lot. The scars from the Ministry still drained his energy.) It picked up speed several months later, with a young Slytherin came up to Harry after the meeting in tears because he didn’t think he belonged in the girls’ dorms—he was a boy. A sixth bed appeared in the Slytherin boy’s dorm that night, and each house was expanded by a set of gender-inclusive dorms. As the atmosphere in the castle became more and more welcoming, non-binary students filled those dorms too. Harry kissed his first boy, a kind sixth-year Ravenclaw named Stephen, and had a few good afternoons figuring things out before Stephen told him he wasn’t ready for a serious boyfriend, let alone dating the most famous guy in the British wizarding world; Harry was flattered and mortified.  There was too much firewhiskey, too many games of Exploding Snap in the back of Binns’ class, too many Canary Creams slipped into beakers of hot chocolate.
They surveyed the contents of the desk. Maybe just a quick tarot pull.
A silence spread across the Great Hall as the doors creaked open.

scratching the answers to the crossword in with a fountain pen—he point-blank refused to recognize a biro as a writing implement—and worrying his bottom lip with his other fingers.
Perry broke in. “Professor Malfoy also told us about how they wouldn’t let women go on stage so all the roles were played by men and some people think Christopher Marlowe actually wrote the plays, but he said that’s a load of rubbish.”
Marcus looked like he was going to ask more, but then Posie started making a choking noise and he was distracted.
“I’m not—I wouldn’t—”
Draco drew the paper back towards him. “He thinks it could make healing potions stronger.”
“The thing that matters,” she said, “is undoing this spell now. Astoria is severely ill, and Draco can’t leave her side.”
Not that he’d be dancing with his students.
might have scooped us on the original announcement, but
“And Kreacher can’t put in any Black family trivia,” Draco said suddenly. “It’s impossible to mime the Great Division of the 1878 Railroad Wand Incident.”

Minerva cleared her throat.
By some wizard fascist.
And now Malfoy was coming to his room and he hadn’t decided upon a single move that would reveal Malfoy’s innermost thoughts—well, just the ones regarding his syllabus and lesson planning for the rest of term—without Harry having to go too far and actually having to kiss him or something even more odious.

He sighed. “I may have augmented its charmwork a bit,” he admitted. “Dragons shouldn’t be flightless.”
Narcissa pressed her nails into her palm. Her mother had said it wasn’t worth the struggle—the memories of Nils would fade—better to avoid subjecting the family to the humiliation of a counter ritual she would surely fail, anyway. She stared at the grass. Her toes were numb. Hermione noticed her glance and summoned her shoes. Narcissa slipped them back on, heedless of the dirt and grass.
Addie grinned. The dungeons classrooms were notoriously ill-ventilated.
We are pleased to welcome you to the postgraduate course in Potioneering.
Blaise wouldn’t normally have looked twice at someone in dungarees, but the way Neville filled them out—and he’d bent over to tie his boot or something, and Blaise allowed himself to just appreciate, his hands wrapped around the mug of tea.
“Yeah, right,” Harry yelled back a bit nonsensically.
Shit, Malfoy was in his armchair.
“I, er, one day, sure,” Neville blustered, sweeping his hair back from his face.
But Neville took a deep breath, remembered that this was probably Blaise’s past crowding all kinds of nonsense into his beautiful soul, and asked, “Hey, can you look at me?”
“Lavender?” a voice called out of the darkness.
“I think I’m going to go, uh, make sure Ginny wins,” Dean said, getting up from the couch.
Sirius stared at his fingernails, which, Remus realized, he’d been biting again. “So, you know how I’m the Head,” he said with a sigh, “When Lucius went to Azkaban, Narcissa was released from her marriage, so he’s technically—ah, fuck, what did Murdock say? Something like a cadette branch of the Blacks now. It’s all bullshit, but …”
“I know you tried,” Ginny said, and kissed her.
They just didn’t know if they were wanted for being them or for being the Kid Who Lived.
“Oh,” Draco said, his cheeks quite pink. “I’ve a lot of marking, actually, since I’ve been working on the novel, and—”
Harry stared at Draco. How could this man have written a book about muggle history and not know what a sticky note was?
was a disaster; Marcus tore his rotator cuff battering a bludger during a Wanderers’ friendly against the Magpies (the Magpies made it even worse), and it quickly became clear that his days as a beater were over. (Let the record state that Oliver was even more depressed than his husband who’d just suffered a career-ending injury.)
“But flatter,” Cho concurred.
“Ooh, dead rat,” Draco said.
“Oh, but you wouldn’t mind with just me?” Malfoy purred.
Neville didn’t miss Blaise’s quiet huff.
“We reviewed that several times,” he said dryly. “I doubt my practical skills would have improved after years of solitary isolation, but I hope that I would be a more, oh, shall we say, considerate, paramour nowadays.”
He found himself holding only one other wand.
He gulped the tea. She smoothed his hair, then reached forward to straighten the red ribbon pinned to his chest.
“You’re getting rid of
She held up a finger. “I’m thinking.”
“See what?”
Harry decided to overlook that statement and said, “I thought you gave me Sirius’s cigarette case. I just thought it was stuck closed. I didn’t know it did anything.”
The librarian might be able to help you with their particular machines. I’m glad to hear you’re spending time in a non-magical space. Maybe we can discuss your experiences during our next class?
Val fought a laugh. “It is indeed my establishment.”
“Jean-Antoine!? What kind of a stupid name is that?” Harry suddenly hated him.
Malfoy sat up straighter and stared out at the pitch. “Certainly not, Potter, which is why I cut off my editor at ten exactly. I still forget that it takes time to get places without apparition.”
Fleur sighed and pressed a kiss into baby Gabrielle’s soft hair. She still smelled like baby. Fleur’s heart choked. Soon she’d be like Victoire, running around and bashing her toes and talking, but right now, just for a few more months, Gabrielle would still smell like baby.
He couldn’t attend Nick’s party, as he told the ghost, because the professors paired up and had to patrol the halls. He didn’t mention in front of the pre-adolescents that this was to prevent any Hogwarts babies or too much exhibitionism—he didn’t want to inspire the twelve-year-olds to attempt some largely premature experimentation.
Hermione rolled her eyes, sighed, and kissed him on the head. “Just promise me you’ll read the foreword,” she said on her way out. “It might clarify some things.”
“I believe a DJ will invite certain styles of dancing that are definitely not appropriate, Headmaster.”
“Oh, fuck,” Blaise said, and called for his own owl.
Malfoy shook his head again. “He’s an Unspeakable. Very cloak-and-dagger shit. Absolutely no intra-office drama allowed. So, of course, everyone’s fucking like rabbits. But no feelings. None.”
“It’s medical,” Draco blurted, his eyes fixed on Harry. “She gets sick. There’s a blood marriage contract.”

Malfoy crossed his legs and laced his fingers together over his knee.
He whipped his wand out of his pocket and levitated the yarn away from her feet.
Blaise made a little moue of distaste. “I don’t take anti-Slytherin prejudice personally.”
“And Remus.”
“Which is, in case you don’t know, an immaterial and material communication system that spans the globe,” he said, without a single trace of irony. “Wizards have never come up with something like that. We were still using bird feathers to write on what are essentially tanned hides when they came up with this.”
“Neville,” she interrupted, “you’re very memorable. You’re a war hero and six eight.”
Slapping it down on Harry’s desk, Draco said tersely, “Here.”
“Why do you care about looking good, anyway, Potter?” he said to himself.

He’d transformed his robes into a long black wool coat. Under that, he had on a tight black polo neck tucked into black jeans. With black suspenders. And then he was wearing Doc Martens.
“Oh, shit,” Sirius said and leapt back.
Leaning back into the cushions, he waited until the deluge of questions—and Ron’s chanting “I knew it!” over and over—settled a bit and then he held up his hands.
Susan’s arm twitched. Astoria reached down to stroke it, but wherever she touched Susan, welts bloomed.
“No, no, Potter, not like that! It’s just hard to explain that you used to be a wizard fascist because the divisions don’t exactly map onto muggle issues like racism or homophobia, so it all comes out kind of wrong when you’re trying to explain why you hated certain groups, and besides, I’m terrible at lying. And you’re not supposed to lie in therapy!” He held up his hands in supplication. “It’s not some leftover anti-muggle bias. Swear to Salazar.”
“Is this related?”
“I did a lot of bad things, Potter. I fucked up. I blamed him for a long time. But it was my choice. I could have chosen differently—I could have—but I wanted—"
He was still staring at Blaise, his gaze flicking to Neville and then back to Blaise.
“I didn’t insult him. He is a werewolf.”
Harry felt the silence stretch out between them. He didn’t quite feel up to bringing up Sirius’s cigarette case; it was a bit too fresh to speak about without his eyes burning. He’d sent Draco an effusive thank you note. That was enough for now.
“Great,” Sirius said. “I think it will be really nice. Toast to the end of the whole marriage contract thing.”
“That,” Audrey said, almost reassembling the piece so they could see its original form, “is a sacred amulet of Priapus.”
“It’s not all fast,” Harry said with a shrug. “There’s slow songs too, like The Plain White Tees song they just played?” Malfoy blinked at him. “Wait, wait, this one’s slow!”
Harry rolled his eyes and said, “Right, sit, Malfoy.”
Draco shrugged.
“You don’t want to go back to Pret,” Harry said. “We don’t have time, anyway. We’ve got to go get the … things.”
“What? Like there’s a dark wizard in Hogsmeade?”
There was a kind of sadness surrounding her thoughts concerning Draco. A light blue-purple, a darker periwinkle. Touched with that grey sadness and fuzz that surrounded those memories of the Manor. She could appreciate that she could think of it and keep breathing. He wasn’t quite there-there, but he wasn’t not-there.
“Potter, don’t be ridiculous. I’d bet fifty Galleons your father also had one.”
“You bring out something weird in him, that’s for sure,” Ron said. “He’s never even offered to give me a lap dance.”
Dear Jason,
was good at flirting.
The dining room was filled with purple smoke. Harry stumbled out of the cloud, dragging Draco by the hand, and choked, “It just went off.”
Harry was still stuck on his terrible compliment.
He shuffled into the kitchen and sat down on the edge of one of the wooden chairs.
“No!” Harry hissed. “No! Explain!”
“Oh, yeah, good, Malfoy, let’s just plan a huge event without even bringing it up at a faculty meeting. Great.”
Neville always forgot he wasn’t an academic. It wasn’t like Azkaban had a subscription to

“Right,” Malfoy said finally. “If you’re sure you’re fine—” he paused, but Harry didn’t make a noise—“I do also have to use this bathroom and would like to go to bed sometime in the next twenty minutes, so …”
The silence was deafening. Harry pulled a bit too hard on the bottom drawer and it crashed onto his foot.
“Oh, I know, darling,” she said, lacing her fingers into his. “You’re a very cool father. You have a fang earring.”
“Oh my god, I’m not a child,” Harry said around the gigantic mouthful of food.
Padma rolled her eyes at Harry and handed him a pumpkin juice. “Drink up, sweetheart. The dungeons are going to be popping if it’s anything like last year. They think they can get into my Amortentia.” Addie giggled at the last word and Padma shrugged. “They’re all idiots who want to find true love. As if anyone knows who they’re meant to be with when they’re fourteen.”
“So,” Harry said after they’d demolished the platter’s contents.
Harry nodded, and then realized that Malfoy couldn’t see through the door, and gulped out an affirmative noise.
Florian bit back a smile as the door opened inwards and Ron Weasley peered around it.
Tea leaves weren’t her thing. She was more of a tarot, crystal ball, photos, clothing, anything solid, kind of seer. She wasn’t into plants. Even if they were dead and boiled. They were still leaves.
Ron heard a gasp.
“Loons, you’ve gotten a letter from Nev!” she shouted to her better half, who was probably doing something mysterious and potentially dangerous with her eyebrows in the bathroom. She’d been in there too long at a not-pooing time.
Lavender pushed herself off the pilaster and held a hand out. It was gripped firmly by the man hovering by Parvati’s elbow. His dark hair was slicked back. He looked like a fucking weightlifter. In a classy way. It was probably the unbuttoned Oxford.
“Draco’s still in the closet,” Harry heard himself saying. Everything felt very far away. “Literally, apparently.”
“Are you propositioning me at lunch, Mr. Potter?”
Sympathy pats.
“They said I have to stay here with you,” he said, slipping the iPod back into his robes. “Every time I leave the room, you go back into a coma.”
“I mean, you’re a good man,” Luna said, “and it makes sense that you care. You’re a very caring person, Neville.”
“I still don’t see why you care so much.”
PPS. E-mail can be a more casual form of communication, as discussed in class. Maybe try sending one to a friend or using an emoticon (a portmanteau of emotion+icon) like :) turn your head to see it as a smiley face.

“As I was saying,” he began again, “These children need someone who has extensive experience with LGTBQIA issues specifically within the wizarding world, and while I appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to support them as an ally, I have spent the last several years—”
“Fuck, Potter, don’t scare me like that!”
“SIRIUS AND REMUS ARE COMING FOR CHRISTMAS.”
“Didn’t know you drank beer.”
Harry panicked. “Fuck, we’re supposed to?”
“My mum’s abusive white family,” he said with a flippant grin.
“Doesn’t it look ace?” Britney shouted at him across the prawn bowl. She grabbed a prawn, downed it, slid the tail onto one of Harry’s several plates, licked her lips clean, pulled out a lip gloss, reapplied and pursed her lips at Elspeth, who clearly had been briefed on lip gloss duty and nodded seriously. “You look good, Professor!” Britney shouted. “Love the kit.”
“Uh, yeah, I think so,” Susan said. She was halfway through the next paragraph (Neville wasn’t even labelling his emotional state while collecting?! How were any of his samples going to be cataloged with the
Maybe, it was even good?

Harry found his voice. “Love shouldn’t be conditional.”
“So you knew he was out and you didn’t tell me?”
She picked up the server and removed the slice to a plate. They bent around it, concealing the cake from general view.

“Exactly,” Luna said, even though she wouldn’t ever have said that or thought that. But maybe there was some good dirt down in there in his soul. Or his bones? Perhaps bones were the human roots.
Harry and Remus snorted at the same time.
“You’re not, though,” Sirius said, holding up a finger to Kreacher, “I specifically freed you and gave you a very good pension because you’re not beholden to me at all, but you were the one who wanted to live at the bottom of the garden—”
Harry laughed. “You didn’t know? The whole ‘Bi-Who-Lived’ series of articles in the Prophet? I run a foundation to help orphaned LGTBQIA witches and wizards? I did a nude calendar? With pygmy puffs tastefully covering certain bits? I’m sure I have a copy of it somewhere, if you’d like …”
Draco Malfoy
Hermione rolled her eyes. She hadn’t even said anything.
“Nope.” Malfoy popped the word with a grin.
“Harry?” he said, his voice a bit groggy. “Are you alright?”
FHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
“He was a right fucking nutter,” Pomona said with vindictive glee. “Minnie and I spent years trying to get him fired, but Albus wouldn’t hear of it.”
“Dean’s been hogging you,” Draco said with his eyes fixed on his beer bottle.
“Ah,” Draco said, with an air of sudden realization.
“Harry, stop pacing,” Ron said.
“I’m glad you’re in. I don’t know what to do.”
“Harry,” she said. “Have you ever thought that there’s maybe … more? To your relationship?”

“Maybe I’ll stay around for a bit.”
Yeah, fuck it.
“Ok, fine,” Hermione said with a sigh. “If he’s being released, he must have served his sentence.”

“This man has a gun in his drawers?” Draco said when Harry lowered the volume. “I didn’t know they called them drawers in America.”
“No, no, it’s fine, don’t worry.” Harry panicked. It was supposed to be a casual invitation. But why was Draco blushing? Did he think it meant something more? Did he think Harry wanted to thank him in some lewd way? Just inviting him up and dropping to his knees and—Harry blinked a few times.
See above.
“Long story short, Rakepick trained me, Bill Weasley, and Merula Snyde, you know, Perry’s mum? She’s an Unspeakable now?” Harry blinked. Perry was the child of all-around badass Merula Snyde? The witch who’d taken down a record number of Death Eaters? Perry was so … floaty. Harry had known they had the same last name, but he’d never really connected the dots.

“You are a catch, my darling,” she said approvingly. Blaise must know a good man when he met one. That was worth something.
“He’s obsessed with the internet.”

Hermione had put Malfoy in the guest room (“Unless you want to share,” she said with a shrug, to which Harry and Malfoy had not bothered to respond, unless you considered staring off in two separate directions and not saying anything for a good minute to be a response), so Harry was on the couch. While they were draping a sheet over the couch, she turned to Harry. Ron and Draco were off doing the dishes. It was just the two of them in the living room. The muffled sounds of water and clinking floated through the air. Harry knew this moment was coming. But he wasn’t looking forward to it.
She really had no facial recollection of a Blaise Zabini, but names always stuck in her mind.

Harry stopped and folded his arms.
Draco stared at him unblinking.
“Are you sure?” He said, almost in a whisper.
DAAAAARRRRCOOOOOOOOOOO MALLLLLFYOOOOOOOOOOOO
And then before he knew what he was saying, he was offering, “You could come to Andromeda and Teddy’s with me on Christmas morning? We’d come back here for dinner, but you’re related to them, and I’m sure Andromeda wouldn’t mind another mouth to feed.”
He was just slipping out the door when Malfoy swanned in, midnight blue robes swishing behind him.
“Harry?” Malfoy said softly. “Are you ok? You’ve been in there a while.”
Re: Re: Welcome 2 the interwebz
“Good for you!”
Despite thousands of galleons of legal research, Sirius hadn’t been able to end any of the patriarchal blood supremacist nonsense that was his birthright. Or his birth millstone. Which, in Remus’ opinion, had led to Sirius embarking on a career that was a big two fingers up to the surviving members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.
“Look,” she said with a sigh, “Just give him a chance. A little one. You sat next to him today at dinner and nothing exploded.” She smirked. “You did have to drink about a liter of butterbeer, but—”
She was in a hospital bed. Hermione was shuffling through papers, Sirius was pacing, Draco was leaning against the wall, and, strangely, Bertram was sitting next to her, holding her hand.
“Azkaban is top of a rock, though, technically, as the lower cells are carved into the rock, I could claim that I have been under and inside of a rock.” The corner of his mouth twitched.
“Waiting to give me a goodnight kiss, Potter?”
Harry felt a bit unsettled by her stare and said, “Your eyes are purple.”
And, to everyone’s surprise, Sirius’ most of all, he was a damn good one. He’d sold out the O2 last year. Remus felt a blush rise to his cheeks at that night’s memories.

“Have you read his book?” she said at last.
PS. You don’t have to sign your real name and include your e-mail address. The e-mail address appears in the “from” section at the top of the e-mail. I like your choice of e-mail address, though. I can tell you considered it carefully.
“I won’t let you go until you tell me,” he said, his eyes blazing.
“Oh, right, that’s fine.”
Harry narrowed his eyes.
But after a friend approached her about brewing a potion to help their lover rekindle their sexual desire after a magical fire mishap, Vane began to reconsider. “They saw me together and explained how this accident had caused some physical or chemical barriers that they didn’t totally understand, but that neither of them could feel the sexual excitement they used to experience, even though both of them desperately wanted to. They wanted something that would help those feelings and emotions re-blossom.”
“Back at you.”
“Anyway,” Hermione continued, “it’s all just a matter of figuring out what you can and are willing to compromise about. When we do have children, Ron has some, uh,” she coughed a little, “particular ideas about under which star signs children should be conceived.”
“You’re a fucking prick,” Harry said with a laugh. “You honestly can’t stop yourself, can you?”
They chewed in silence.
“Potter, lovely to see you.”
Neville blinked and stared up at the ceiling.
“Er, yes?” His hand closed around his wand.
“Draco Malfoy.”
“It’s proof that wizards are probably inferior,” Draco said. “Definitely not superior or more intelligent or creative or whatever the fuck Voldemort and my father and I thought for so fucking long.”
“Yeah,” they said. “I know.”
Harry laughed. “Yeah, I was trying to distract from this huge-ass facial scar. Or balance it out, I don’t know. Give the people something else to talk about.”
Harry’s nose wrinkled.
Malfoy cleared his throat. “Indeed.”
He looked around for Malfoy, but the blond man seemed to have disappeared.
Harry crossed his arms. “Rather generous.”
Draco picked up the pestle and returned to his work. Neville was about to give up on the conversation when he said slowly, “I thought it was only a non-magical thing, from class. But then you kissed Blaise in front of me, and Sirius married Remus Lupin, who, my father said, had attacked and forcibly bonded to Sirius, which I now see is a horrible, prejudiced way of distorting what seems to be a partnership of equals. So it’s clearly a human, or, as you attempted to begin this discussion with, a plant, thing.”
Luna sighed. “Ginny is no fun at all,” she said and sighed.
Draco blushed.
“Don't wander off!” Harry shouted into the wind.
Malfoy was quite warm through his robes.
His heart was in his throat.
“Andromeda? I don’t think I know her.”
Ron nudged Harry in the side and mouthed “preggers,” with a nod at Angelina. Harry fought the grin that threatened to burst out across his face. Like George, he buried himself in his drink. Luckily, that was when Andromeda and Teddy fell through the Floo, and from that moment on, Harry had his hands full with Teddy, who immediately morphed his hair to match Harry’s new style.
At least he used a refillable fountain pen instead of a quill. He had enchanted it to look like a white peacock feather. He was still a Malfoy. Though maybe it was the Black penchant for theatrics. God, Sirius would have laughed.
1969), take up jogging or something.
“Yeah, the icy silence and all the drinking isn’t because of Malfoy. Not at all. Completely unrelated.” She waved her wand emphatically. “You’re completely fine at faculty meetings, entirely chummy, work together on related curriculum, all that shit. You’re absolute mates.”
“They’re coming. Just stay calm.”
“It’s like Granger’s spewing initiative; absolutely disgusting and not at all catchy.”

Pushing open the intricately carved wooden shutters, Fleur leaned out the window and yelled, “What?”
“Er,” he said, glancing back into the room.
He turned around. Somehow Malfoy had opened his window and flown in?

That seemed like the conclusion to a lot of their meetings lately—Draco gone, Harry sweating and confused and a bit disoriented.
“Potter, stop fiddling,” Malfoy sniped. “You’re jostling the table.”
Andromeda studied his face as he withdrew his hands.
Harry started seeing black spots swimming across his vision, and then Malfoy’s breathing sounded very far away, and then it was just black.
“Draco and Astoria,” she said. “But they have to—it was supposed to work as a last attempt to make the pair fall in love—sequestering them away, sharing each other’s breath, with the hope that they might realize that the other person wouldn’t be so bad to marry.”
With gentle fingers, he prised Harry’s hand off his arm and returned it to Harry’s lap. He rolled his sleeve back down and slipped the cufflink in. He straightened in the armchair and cleared his throat.
“The what?”
Malfoy looked taken aback. “Potter, if you think I could concentrate while sitting in the Great Hall, next to you, no less—” he broke off and looked down at his cup of tea. “I need silence. Absolute silence. And about five hundred books. And a fresh cup of Earl Grey. I couldn’t even consider starting an article in these circumstances.” He waved his hands around a bit.
Luna batted her eyelashes at him as sarcastically as she could.
“Anyway, it’s not really on the menu right now,” Neville blundered.
“Please, no presents! Your presence is present enough,” she said and giggled.
Biting his tongue, he glared at Harry, then took a deep breath.

They set off towards the castle, no closer to the bottom of the mystery than when they’d started. But Harry did kind of know what Draco smelled like, so the evening wasn’t a total failure.
“Don’t start in on Luna, you don’t—”
“Ronald,” she said sternly. He glanced up and her face softened. “You’re the only one of my children who can bake.”
Eight years ago, he’d started his final year as a student—the first year he’d had at Hogwarts where no one was actively trying to kill him. Then he’d muddled about as an Auror for a year before realizing that he’d loved Dumbledore’s Army because of the teaching, not the fighting. Harry started with muggle primary schools, then went to wizarding uni for education. Now he was two masters’ degrees and years of student teaching stronger. And he was ready to take on Hogwarts.
“Just, you know,” Sirius said. “A little modified love potion.”
“I mean, that way it’ll be balanced no matter what nutcases Malfoy brings.”

He paused. “I would have done anything to get my father to look at me without hatred.”
He hoped he wasn’t going to have to draw diagrams.
Remus Lupin glanced at his husband. “Ah, the perils of age,” he said with mild amusement and turned back to the crossword.
Harry found himself nodding along. The Oliver-Wingers were both very odd and very powerful, but their magic was filled with so much love and light that it made Harry ache. He wanted that. He wanted a little cottage filled with kids and a spouse he’d do anything for—anything good and righteous, that was.
Owain shot his eyes at Minerva and then at Lachlan Leith, who had taken over Filch’s role with a penchant for restoration and a distaste for shackles. Placatingly, Lachlan talked Hagrid down by promising to make him a special slug cage that strictly required Hagrid’s magical signature to open.
“Wait, wait,” Harry said, beckoning him closer. Now that they were closer to the ground he could attempt broom-surfing.
I hope this owl reaches you, wherever you are. Draco needs you. His future—happiness and quite literally, life—depends on the undoing of this evil marriage contract.

“That tends to fuck with a person,” Fleur said.
“Nah, mate, can’t help you,” Harry muttered. He had three hours to whip up a Halloween costume—he’d promised five house points to the student who first guessed what he was—but that required some kind of witty and Muggle-related fancy dress.
Affecting a slightly different voice, Harry continued, “Who, girl, your man?”
Padma watched the two of them over her steaming cup of tea and hummed to herself. Things were coming along marvelously. She was going to have fifteen Galleons before the new year, she was sure of it.
“Really?” Harry said, pushing his chair back so it balanced on its back two legs. “Sounds like it.”
Mum glanced over at him and flashed him a smile.
This was what always happened.
Malfoy gasped a little. Harry stopped.
“Uh, sorry, Alf, we want a small veggie with artichokes and pepperoni. Yeah, the usual, and then that one. No small veggie. Yep, delivery, great. Thanks. You have a good night, too.”
Draco closed his eyes and said slowly, “It was all my idea. Blaise told me about the cursed necklace that went missing from your house, and because of my past, I convinced Harry that you’d use it against me, so I talked him into—”
He didn’t need anyone else, he knew that.

—and calmly said, “I think that means we might investigate.”
But when he raised his head, Perry was there.
“Watching me, Potter?”
“I don’t want veggie,” Sirius said, “I want pepperoni and artichokes.”
Addie raised her eyebrows. “Cozy,” she said at last with a sidelong glance at Padma. “Well, can’t be late!”
“You’ve always been too much,” Malfoy said.
“He’ll be helping me set up the greenhouses before term, but then he’s going to start a potions internship.”
The timer broke the comfortable Sunday morning silence reigning around the dining room table. Remus jerked and dropped his pen.

“Oh, right, so that’s Blaise, Nev’s boyfriend,” Blaise gave a wave, then retreated to Neville’s shoulder—
Arthur patted her knee. “I know, love, but maybe it’s time to work on forgiveness a bit. I’ve been reading about this muggle character called Jesus, you know, the one who inspired Christianity, and one of his mottos was ‘turn the other cheek,’ which, to be fair, I’m not entirely sure I understand the story, but the gist of it is that you’ve got to allow people a second chance to hit you. And then if they don’t hit you again, they’ve probably regretted hitting you the first time and you’ve shown you’re the better person anyway. Or something.” He patted at his cardigan pockets and took out a tiny orange New Testament, which he began flipping through while mumbling to himself.
At least they’d been able to skip the eve of Christmas Eve this year, since, as Fleur had pointed out to her husband—she loved saying that, thinking it, running her hand across Bill’s arm at a restaurant or as an introduction, thinking that he was hers, all hers, the father of her children, the sudden sunlight dream explosion of a million romantic thoughts she’d always denied or subsumed into charmwork because falling in love was stupid and then, there he was, and now he was her husband—no one else even thought that was a holiday.
He rolled his hips for a few beats.

“Are you alright?”

“Raspberries?” Ron was already sketching the cake in his mind. A ganache, fresh berries on top, at least two layers of cake with espresso to deepen the flavor, yes, it was all coming together.
“If Professor Malfoy would care to help out a colleague, I’d appreciate it,” he said with a smile. He could have pointy teeth too.
“Commandeered by the grandmama,” Fleur said. “She gathers all the babies to her like an extremely powerful magnet.”
“Potter, why do we care? That’s Auror stuff.”

“I stomped on your face. I tried to kill Dumbledore. I betrayed Hogwarts. I murdered a Squib, I tortured fellow Hogwarts students. I mean, I was a fucking bad person. A life term in Azkaban would have been generous. I should have been Kissed. My father was sure that cooperating with the Wizengamot would decrease his own punishment. I think he was pleased to reveal my transgressions. Not that I was gay, of course. That wasn’t about to become public knowledge. Preserve the Malfoy honor and all that. He thought if he told the Wizengamot everything I did, he wouldn’t get Kissed.”
When he came to, Malfoy was kneeling next to his head, with one hand on his forehead. Harry still had the snitch in a death grip.
There was a momentary silence. Harry blinked at himself in the mirror.
“Indeed.”
“I’ll let you know when I need it back,” Draco said. “The archive location is written on the back of each copy; in case you want to go see the originals.”
Draco hummed a little.
Since this (sadly) isn’t an interview about dragons, we dove to the heart of this series:
“You,” Harry said, poking a finger into Malfoy’s (well-muscled) shoulder. His robes were quite soft and a midnight blue. Definitely stretch velvet, the way they caressed his biceps and then Harry’s mouth was saying, “are very confusing and also you look nice, so there's that.”

“Never!” Blaise gasp-sobbed.
“You’re happier now, sir,” Perry said. He’d put all his books in his bag. “You’ve just got a better vibe.”
Without any word of warning, Malfoy tilted to one side and fell off his broom, but before he could fall, he caught it with one hand. Harry, shocked into clutching his broom again, watched as Malfoy grabbed it with his other hand.

She and Harry had both been in a lot of anger management therapy postwar and she didn’t want to be eaten up by rage at all the inequalities and injustices, which, thank God, were lessening through the waves of activism that thanks to Harry and everyone, but there still was so much wrong. So much to fix. So much to break down and burn to the ground. Not so much to mend.
“We can hardly fire him before he’s started, Potter,” she finished tartly, folding her napkin and laying it on the table. “Try giving him a second chance. If only to keep the peace at faculty meetings.”
“There is blood, of course, but it was a pinprick,” Narcissa said. “Just enough to dampen the salt. That’s why there’s a two—blood
“What?!”
Draco nodded, his face suddenly serious. “Yes, but we’ve got to take precautions. We shouldn’t search alone at the house, in case they’re actually dangerous undercover dark wizards dressed up as a seemingly ordinary country wizarding family.”
Fred nodded. “She’s a supernatural force.”
“Doesn’t sound half bad, actually,” Florian said. Harry was such a square.

“You split the last piece with the elderly woman,” a voice from behind Jason said.

“Exactly! You can’t do an exchange with a snake school!”
Sirius gagged.
And she was going to have to write to Sirius to inform Malfoy about the whole contract thing if he hadn’t yet, because it was, according to her research, going to be difficult to break, but not impossible, but that was something that Malfoy would definitely have to be involved with personally. So she’d probably be seeing Malfoy sooner or later. Though it might be nice to re-meet him socially before having to demand that he open a vein or something equally grim.
“I mean, I can get it out without taking my trousers off.”
“What are you doing lurking about in hallways?” Padma said, a bit more slowly than usual. Ah, they’d been drinking.
“Well, excuse me, Miss Politeness Patil.” He stabbed a chunk of potato. She rolled her eyes and turned to talk to Hagrid about harvesting Flobberworm slime.
But he came back with a pointed hat—as if anyone wore those anymore, but he could do him, and besides, the hair thing was clearly still a point of self-consciousness—and lurked in the doorway, shifting from one foot to another.
“I like the heat,” Florian said. “And I make a fuckload of money when it’s hot. So.” He shrugged and plopped down on a couch.
Three hours later, Harry woke up from a sweaty nap to an insistent paper crane tapping his forehead. He grabbed it, rolled over to reach for his glasses on the nightstand, and heard a crunch.
“You’re right, Malfoy. I could use some help with the club.” He tried for a sultry tone. “A more worldly role model, one more well-versed in pureblood culture and those nasty little upper-class morals, might be helpful. You could teach them how to buy cufflinks or something.”
“You are so fucking dramatic,” Andromeda hissed, stabbing a finger into Sirius’ chest.
Malfoy’s back was ramrod straight.
Harry snorted. “He’s not as much of a dick as he was.” They glanced down at their water, then started picking at a cuticle. Val fought the urge to slap their hands. “He’s less prickly. More, er, curious.”
Harry laughed, and shoved him a little bit. “You complete git! You think my curricular reform plan is good!”
nev gave me your email, hope that’s ok, but i realized i went home with the smirnoff you won in the bottle tombola which was a complete accident and i don’t want you to think i’m the kind of person who steals other people’s alcohol even if you were the one who said it was tiring to carry around so i was actually doing u a favor
ok so like what was malfoy doing
Sirius shrugged. “It’s not hard to reconfigure magical objects.”

Draco’s eyebrows drew together. “A what?” She handed it back to him.
Malfoy was now florid, and the crisp breeze had died down. He shook his head and muttered, “I don’t know what Khan is talking about.”
The latter sentence was drowned out, at least to Harry, by Teddy’s frantic yelling. He’d given up on Draco and was patting Harry down for hidden presents.
yeah but u didnt ask me that lol
“This device is homosexual?” He glanced down at it.
Well, maybe it was pacing.
The first few weeks of term passed smoothly. Harry’s ears perked up when his fifth-years came into his class on Tuesdays—directly after a double period with Malfoy—but he couldn’t glean much. They seemed chipper. They must be sleeping through Malfoy’s tedious lessons.
Professor Malfoy was currently smiling and staring down at his tea as the students trailed out.
Remus says I should write, “I had hoped to hear from you by now.” I’m giving you three more days before I use the Summoning.
“Oh, fuck!” he yelped, and grabbed his toe.
“What?”
“She’ll start with chapter five,” Draco said with a smirk. “But those are the antidotes, so,” he gave a little wiggle and handed Harry a glass of red.
10:58 am, Feb. 8, 2007
“I do not fucking—I was saying you suck ass at Quidditch—fuck you—you’re impossible. Get your mind out of the gutter.” Harry balled his fists up. He was trying to be an adult here, and then he just catapulted back to his irate schoolboy self. Ready to fight. Ready to hit harder, give worse. Malfoy was such a fucking idiot.
at’s end of a stick. We’re still
Draco pinked a bit, but Harry knew he couldn’t resist a present.
“A dwarf planet, Potter? How creative.”
But then sometimes, Val thought, you needed a little help.
I DO NOT
P.S. "Splat the Rat" is a traditional fête game that tests the reaction speed of participants. It has historical precedents dating back to the 3rd century, when it was colloquially known as occīdōte mūrem. I can give you a citation, if necessary.
“Ah, well, a worthy spell.” She finished her toast. “When are they coming for you?”
“Still blessed with keen observational skills, I see.” Malfoy folded his napkin and placed it under his saucer. He smoothed his hair and stood. His black robes stretched across his now broad shoulders and fell without wrinkles in a long swoosh of dark fabric.
“You pimping for the butter council or?”
He leaned back against one of the student desks. He didn’t seem like he was going to say anything regarding the whole Christmas Day Patronus Incident. Or really like he was going to say anything. Well, that was fine. Harry wasn’t going to bring it up then.
The avoidance seemed to indicate that Draco didn’t want him.
Andromeda and Malfoy huffed in the same tone and picked up their coffee cups, pinkies out.
The client appeared alert and engaged throughout the meeting, a noticeable difference from a year ago. Dressed tidily in black robes.
Harry knew a dismissal when he heard it. Something had gone wrong and he wasn’t really sure how or what or why.
Harry looked, really looked, at him in the clear sunlight. Malfoy squinted up into the sky, wrinkling the skin around his eyes and across his forehead as he followed the match. The wind ruffled his white-blonde hair, and he pushed it back behind one ear without taking his eyes off the field. He reached into his robes, withdrew a glasses case, and put on a pair of black Ray Bans.
Audrey beamed and tucked a strand of her whitish-grey hair behind one ear. Here wand was sticking out of a messy bun.
“Well,” Draco said, “And I kind of figured that you weren’t super into archival research and if I ever ran into you again you might want to know that this stuff is out there, so.”
♚ October 27, 2007
“Andre, I’ve fucked up my hair,” Harry said.
The rest of the morning passed in a lazy haze. Teddy went absolutely bonkers for his
Yelling incoherently, Teddy collected his offerings from Malfoy as well and raced off to deposit them on the long dining room table.
Harry barked out a laugh. “Anyway, my identification is a bit of a theoretical issue at this point, since I’m not seeing anyone…” Well, that wasn’t at all relevant to the issue at hand, which was protecting the kids from Malfoy and his pernicious influence. He could be a gay racist. Or a gay wizard fascist. Apparently, he had been a gay wizard fascist as a teen. Still trying to wrap his head around that one, Harry snorted.
Fuck. Harry ground his teeth.
were murdering people, Florian had confessed to Harry, but he couldn’t bring himself to actually kill someone.
“Why?”
He couldn’t help it.
Sure enough, in Draco’s spindly handwriting, he read:
“Oh,” he said and breathed a sigh of relief. “You’re back.”
“Is this the singles couch?”
Harry noticed the remnants of a jar of clotted cream and a pot of jam sitting near a plate.
Trust you to become emotionally attached to a hairy fruit. I will bring it to your birthday party. I question your choice of Wetherspoons as a delightful birthday location (I have been learning things, you lout), but I shouldn’t quibble with the birthday human.
He and Draco spoke into the magical microphones at the same time. Titters broke out across the room.
Then it was mid-November and he was sliding a lemon cream biscuit onto Malfoy’s saucer at a faculty meeting.
But that pathway was dangerous, so Harry turned his attention to the rest of his colleagues. Time to argue that what he’d just done was educational. “As you can see, while it can be a rather insinuating style of dancing, it also doesn’t involve any actual sexual activity.”
Harry shook his head to let his hair fall across the scar again. “It’s the truth. I still don’t get it, but it’s true.”
Ron rolled his eyes and scoffed. “Gotta get the baddies. Never-ending, apparently.”

“Tomorrow you might need the coffee,” the older man said conspiratorially. “I can never sleep before the first day of classes.”
I apologize that I could not find the correct button to make the accent in your last name. I do not want to be rude.
wots the drug one that
Luckily they were back to the thumping beat of Eminem before Harry could consider how he’d just asked Malfoy to dance and danced to a slow dance with him and he’d thought about Malfoy’s eyelashes, which was definitely not on, so he’d just go over there and separate Justin and Perry (he knew it!) who were making out quite vigorously and rubbing against each other frantically (“Less action,” Harry barked, tapping Perry on the shoulder with his wand)—who had approved of this music?! He had. Right. This was being hoisted by his own petard. Well and truly hoisted.
“How have you been?” he asked at last, his back to her.
“Astoria?” Bertram’s voice was gravelled. “What’s happening? Do I need to call St. Mungo’s?”
Mr. Draco Malfoy
, he thought,
Malfoy made a harrumphing noise and brushed past Harry.
The gorilla was probably not really wearing a tutu in real life.
Fleur rolled her eyes. “Yeah, like he’s really going to be scared of a professor of ancient runes in a battered leather jacket.”
“I didn’t want to ask but fuck YES!” Harry said gleefully.
“Oh, thank God,” Harry said.
Harry was stunned into silence. His mind was doing the fuzzy thing again, and he felt the edges of a headache curling up inside his skull.
Draco looked him up and down and shrugged. “I suppose you’re ready for something,” he said, and began to unbutton his academic robes. His long fingers pushed each of the silver buttons through the fabric with a seductive grace—Harry shook his head and concentrated his attention on his cap. Molly had knitted it for him a few years ago, and he picked some of the pills off it.
“Well, you certainly made it a surprise. We usually just sit around and drink wine and talk shit. But,” Astoria shrugged, “you made a shocking entrance.”
, Sirius quipped as his head floated among the green flames.
“Ugh, he’s doing such good work at the Ministry, like, more power to him. Maybe you should get him to come do a talk here.”
Malfoy caught him staring and said archly, “Yes, Potter?”
“The, er, fuck—” Harry said, waving one hand at towards the other side of the tent.
“Music is a very expressive and emotional medium,” Lavender said with a bright smile. “Can I see some of your playlists?”
“Ugh, fine.”
Neville’s heart was in his mouth, but Draco just pulled an envelope towards him, decanted the powder into it, and refilled the mortar.

The WAWFAN meeting was not a success. It had been a terrible idea to invite Malfoy.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Fine,” Draco said, shrugging out of his coat and placing it on a nearby counter. He crossed his arms and said in an even tone, “We are two secondary school teachers who have been tasked with coming up with an LGTBQIA-friendly sexual education panel for fourteen- to seventeen-year-olds and we have come to your store to purchase several items to be used for demonstration or as examples of things students may one day encounter or wish to purchase for themselves at some point in the future. When they are of age.”
He wasn’t sure if he still had a job.
“Nice treat for your boy,” the till girl said as she ran Harry’s debit card.
“But your cake.” Jason cut off another bite and studied it. “I’d ask for the recipe, but I can’t bake for shit.”
“Ok,” Neville said. Fucking jump into the breach, though, now, because Blaise had asked him, but also because Draco wasn’t a complete shit and he needed to know if this was going to be the end of their semi-comfortable working relationship. “Because sometimes it seems like you don’t, uh, totally get it?”

Fleur and Harry exchanged a glance. Harry smirked at Bill, then got up and vanished into the crowd.
Harry drew their head back. “Wait, what?”
She jerked back.
Narcissa cleared her throat. She’d broken him of using filler language by age five. “Look,” she said, turning to Sirius and Hermione, “Can you just—” she waved a hand, “as a Muggle from television would say, Give us some space.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
This grinning, windblown Malfoy was so different than the sneering, controlled Malfoy of Harry’s youth. He knew what had happened, but he didn’t really know what had
“What is it?”
“Do you have anything else?”

Yours faithfully,
Half-bemused, he shook his head at her.
“Hey, hey,” Marcus admonished the baby, who’d reached for Cho’s fork. “That’s her fork, not yours.”
He tilted his head.
DARCO MALFYO
paired with Neville Longbottom (PhDB, University of Auckland), wizarding hero who has mentored several former blood purists through their community service stints and is currently carrying out a study in magical plants in Northumberland, thus convenient for Dr. Longbottom to pick up the client in Otterburn each morning as the client cannot use magical means of transportation without supervision. Wanted to review the contents of the referral packet given to Dr. Longbottom, but OP growled and said “We’ve already been through it three times, we know what he’s guilty of,” so I did not push my luck on that front. However, the client already knew of this plan, made no noise, continued to look out window.
“Ah, censoring yourself now. Sensible,” Draco said with a quirked eyebrow. “Griffin’s probably going to eat out on that for weeks.”
Ron pressed his lips together. His face hurt from smiling.
There was a silence, and then Pansy was crossing the room and holding out a hand to Hermione.
Harry found himself nodding along before realizing that Britney was always at the bottom of him doing something completely ridiculous.
Remus blinked down at the crossword.
Malfoy sat back on his heels. “Fine, Potter, you can have this one. Charity point.”
Hermione and Ron visited and took him out for drinks at the Three Broomsticks, where Hannah Abbott, who’d bought the pub from Madam Rosmerta a few years back, served them crisp cider and piping hot chips and let them in on the Hogsmeade gossip. The men who owned the pet store wandered in and ordered their usuals, then fell into conversation with Hannah, and when Harry found out they’d been married for almost fifteen years, he invited them to the next WAWFAN meeting. Ben, despite choking on his glass of white wine, agreed, and Barnaby nodded happily, clapping his huge silver-ringed hands together in a jangly excitement. The meeting was a huge success, probably because Barnaby brought five Puffskeins, but Harry vowed to invite more community members, if only to show the students there was a world of happiness outside Hogwarts. (And that there were older gays, even if the
“I’m not done yet!” Harry would say. He’d taken to hiding the books inside pedagogical covers. Of course, Malfoy would devour a book in a single sitting. It made Harry feel slow, plodding through books in days rather than hours. But he wasn’t slow. At least Malfoy couldn’t do any kind of maths. Addie had told Padma who’d told Harry that Malfoy marked everything out of tens just so he wouldn’t have to do complicated fractions. Harry started giving everything odd amounts of points, just to keep his students on their toes. That was the only reason. Not showing off how quickly he could add when he and Malfoy sat in the staff room grading late into the night. Not at all about that.
She wanted to crawl back into bed and nestle down with her littlest one.
He returned and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair again. It smelled like pine and amber.
“You fucking fainted.”
Cho’s eyebrows drew together. “In what sense?”
Ron waved his wand and the temperature in the room dropped.
“Try to cut it off?” Malfoy’s lips quirked. “No, Potter, I was trying to die.”
Sirius spread his hands on the table. “He’s technically a Black now, so I’m—”
“I can’t let you suffer alone,” he said with an innocent expression.
Narcissa shook her head. “You think I’d cut my son in the heart?”
Jason tilted his head. Ron traced the movement with his eyes, wishing it was with his hands or his mouth, and fuck, this was wild.
They had no sooner ducked out from Andromeda’s mantel than they were attacked by a burst of turquoise.
Malfoy looked up at Harry. He didn’t say anything but nodded, with a small, private smile gracing his face.
(He hadn’t wanted to discuss any of this with Eileen; the strange camaraderie of having a mutual mission had done wonders for Draco’s prickliness and Harry didn’t want to have to examine why tracking down this purportedly missing cursed necklace was so important to him. Or the paranoia that had started this whole mission in the first place.)
“No!” Harry shouted, grabbing it and holding it to his chest. “Nope!”
“Roger that!”
He’d become a muggle rockstar. Fuck, non-magical rockstar, Remus reminded himself.
Ron’s eyes widened. “What the fuck, mate?”
Florian Fortescue tapped the glass door and waited. He’d seen a few shapes moving around behind the brown papered windows, and if he knew anything about Harry Potter, they’d be in there, sweating away in the late summer heatwave without even thinking about taking a break.
“You’ve just pulled a muscle,” Remus said and pushed Sirius’ hand away from his neck. A quick
Harry could hardly stand still the day of Alina’s birthday party. Audrey hadn’t been acting any differently; her dot was always in logical places on the map; he and Draco had both made it through several weeks without having any encounters with cursed jewelry. They’d been spending evenings in the library searching for sex-related necklaces in the former Restricted Section, now open to all students, except for the really dangerous books, which Mrs. Hardbroom kept in little cages behind the reference desk; they hunched over desks and whispered to each other until late into the night. It felt a bit like a research project with Hermione.
With wide eyes, Malfoy continued: “I have, perhaps, researched contemporary Muggle music—”
It was like seeing a dead person eating candy floss.

A pause.
“I can’t imagine you without it,” Padma said. “It suits you. So does the eyebrow piercing.”
“I just—I’m—” Harry glared at the table. Well, that was a slight improvement. “Aren’t they supposed to let people know?”
“Darling,” Sirius said, “that was
“We can pick up a few things when we’re in Edinburgh next,” Malfoy said, completely ignoring Harry, throwing his legs up over the chair’s arm. “When we go for the stickies. And my books.”
—but it was a bit late for that. Anyway, they’d recommended a shop. Harry hustled Draco into a taxi and then hustled him out again at the corner before the shop. No need for the cabbie to know too much of their business. Draco had been far too nosy about how the man knew all about how to use the “taxicab,”
Malfoy looked away and shrugged. Harry felt like he was missing something. There was something that was just out of his reach, and he didn’t—
harry mate u ther e ??
Draco continued buttering a piece of bread and raised his eyebrows.
“We, are, not,” he said, poking Malfoy in the shoulder between each word, “going, on, a, sex, field-,” poke, “-trip, with, students.”
She turned and her stomach flipped.
HAHAHAHHHFHHAHAHAHAHFKDHAHAHAHAHALHFKLDAS HAHAH
The front had Draco’s monogram and the back had the Black family crest. It looked like there had been another coat of arms, Malfoy, Harry assumed, to balance out the design, but it had been effaced.
“Butter makes everything better.”
Draco made a noise of agreement.
Andre croaked, “Yeah, I’ll tell him to write.”
Hermione sighed and twisted her wedding band. “One day, Ronald. When…” she trailed off and Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Oh my God, no,” Harry moaned, dropping his head to the desk. “I knew you’d overreact like this. It’s just a raunchy band name.” He said all of this directly to the polished oak desk.
george spit out his pumpkin juice
“Wait, there are gay plants, right?”
“Kids,” Ron said. “Four more years, then kids.”

Draco was back to sticking and unsticking the note, this time to his hand.
“Oh, she can have it,” Cho said. It still weirded her out that first, Marcus was married to Ollie—not because she was homophobic but Marcus had been a violent, monosyllabic cretin during their student days, which, in many ways, was the more confusing second prong of that thought—second, that Marcus had grown into a gentle, brawny man who liked babies and cats and knitting and third, that he was one of the most universally-beloved and crushed-on teachers at Hogwarts.
Andre hummed and asked, “What are you thinking for your hair?”
Her legs felt like they had forgotten how to make a knee work. Bending? Was that a thing? Fucking legs. Disaster knees.
“Hm,” Harry said and tilted their head to the left. “I don’t think so, but I can look into that. New project?”
do they have that @mom tho
“Right,” Ron said, putting down his scone. This was serious. “So, she’s super proud of being a lesbian, right, and she doesn’t care if people ask stupid questions, and she knows a lot about tantric sex magic.”
Still, though, it seemed like Malfoy 2.0 was trying. Which was good.
Thank you for reading! If you leave me a comment, I'll probably cry about it from sheer happiness and leave you a mostly incoherent reply. ♡ ♡ ♡
“We weren’t holding hands,” he said with a little moue of distaste. “Harry and I are colleagues, as he has exquisitely reminded me on multiple occasions.”
The risotto burst into flames.
“Nothing,” Draco almost shouted at the same time Lavender said, “Love.”
“Regarding Malfoy. You’re not going to do anything stupid.”
Padma raised her eyebrows at the entire situation; Harry didn’t want to tell her Draco’s secrets and told her they’d had a disagreement regarding the name of WAWFAN. He wouldn’t tell her anything else, and she stopped prying after Harry was ranting about Malfoy and waved his wand too emphatically and half the beakers in her classroom shattered. He did feel bad about that, even if he had a strong Reparo.

Then there was a wolf-whistle and Addie leapt up clapping. “That’s my boy, Potter! Fucking work!”
Neville was kissing his neck. He was going to melt and keel over on this stupid formica table. “I’d much rather stay here. With you.”
Harry buttered his toast and glanced about for Malfoy. He shouldn’t be expecting him. He never came to breakfast. Anticipation of the first match that thrummed in his veins. A good spar with Malfoy spiced up a Quidditch match like nothing else. But he’d promised Padma to give Malfoy a chance. Whatever that meant.
He was having a heart attack. Like, actively dying. And his fiancée was bouncing on her toes and his mother was patting his arm. Couldn’t they tell he was seconds from seeing the Grim?
