"I swear, Potter, if you don't fuck me soon I'll never forgive you," Malfoy said, and the words were like a jolt of electricity. Harry ground his hips one more time, moaning slightly as he did.
“Draco, it’s still me.” He rubbed a hand across his face, in a gesture that Draco knew well. He could see the clay on Harry’s hands, but at the same time he suddenly remembered seeing Potter make the same gesture, hundreds of times, at Hogwarts. Why hadn’t he seen this before? Why hadn’t he noticed?
Henry sighed, and ran a hand through his hair. “Sorry. I wasn’t expecting anything like this to happen. Although if I had brought someone home I suppose one bed wouldn’t matter—” He stopped when he saw Draco’s face.
“Harry!”
“I hope so.” Hermione frowned. “I don’t know why, but I find potions easier than this.”
Inside was gloomy, and Harry felt awkward in the space. He'd never really done much to the place, but it was still his home and he just knew that Malfoy would be full of cutting little observations.. Suddenly he saw it through a stranger's eyes, and he was all too aware of the damp, and the faded fabrics and scuffed furniture. He also hadn't forgotten that it was originally a Black house, and that if Sirius hadn't left it to him it might actually have become Malfoy's, instead.
Harry ignored the small spark of misgiving at the idea of anything involving cauliflower as a surprise, opting instead to accompany her down to dinner with a smile.
Hannah had spoken, her kind face open as she looked around the room.
Each strip of metal needed to be bent or twisted until it was the exact shape to fit into the mechanism hidden within the Snitch. Draco adjusted each to be perfect, tapping with his hammers, squeezing in vices and pulling – always gently – with pliers. His hands, inside his gloves, grew hot. When he took his gloves off at the end of each day his flesh was soft and swollen, pink with heat and moist with sweat. He would blow on them, the cool air like the finest of prickles travelling over his sensitive skin.
“Depends what you do.” Harry couldn’t resist looking over at Draco again. Draco was smiling, regarding Harry with what Harry hoped was warmth. His insides flickered and danced.
“Exactly,” Hermione said. “Although I hope we do have chances to do things like this again. Maybe this isn’t our last chance, but our first one. We’ve never had a holiday before, have we?”
“Sorry, I wasn’t expecting to be sharing my bed tonight.”
“We fixed this room together,” Harry said. “Everything you see came out of us learning to find peace between us.”
“You’ve fallen for me?”
“It is good to see you,” Harry said again. And then he touched Draco’s hand, which was resting on the sofa between them, brushed it with the side of his fingers. He was instantly rewarded with an opening of the tightness of Draco’s face, and a soft smile.
Malfoy had a point, but Harry held firm.
“I’ve seen the index cards.” There was a huge box of them, all colour coded. Draco and Blaise would sit with them, choosing which tours and routes to offer each week. Blaise maintained that a bit of variety was important, but Harry suspected that Draco would have been happy giving the same tour, day in day out.
Altheda hooted.
Harry and Draco stopped at the far end of the decking which ran to the water's edge. Muffled voices could be heard from the house, but the everything else was quiet; Harry could hear the gentle sound of water hitting the shore, and the sun was almost at the horizon. Harry put his arm around Draco and pulled him close. He breathed in the skin-soap-man smell that always felt like home. They stood there a while, watching as the sun dipped down, the last low flare of colour fading with it.
"It’s written all over your face," she said softly. "You’re suffering."
“Maybe. It’s a lot to go against though, isn’t it? Your friends, your family.”
The leaves were beginning to yellow, here and there. Harry sighed. The long march to winter had begun. The summer had been warm but also wet and thundery, and he’d not enjoyed it as much as he had hoped.
“The next time I see you will be in a week's time, with Draco, at Auror training.”
Draco stopped. “And you looked very fetching in your underwear.”
“Me too.”
Kingsley nodded. “And I’m looking for a present for my grandchildren. Not that my daughter will thank me, but what’s the point if I can’t spoil them a bit?”
Hermione took a breath as though about to speak, but seemed to think better of it. She turned sharply on her heel and rushed off up the stairs. Before the bedroom door above clicked shut, Harry heard a rather urgent, “Ron, wake up!”
“Don’t you like me?”
“I sold three. And then I tripped over the table and they all slid…” He looked down at the ground.
“I hope you were paying attention,” Henry said, when he’d finished. Draco certainly had been paying attention: to the flex of muscle beneath Henry’s t-shirt, and the mark on his lip where he’d bitten down. “Because it’s your turn now.”
“Andromeda didn’t hate you.”
“Harry?” asked Hermione, then she turned to look at the group too. “Are you OK?”
“But now I can study with Lisa and Daphne, and I’ve talked to Millicent a bit… I think she’s being really brave.”
Potter strokes his back, his hand moving in long arcs and swirls. The pressure is surprisingly firm, and it calms Draco.
“Even though you’re so good at it?” Harry said with a soft smile.
“Are you always in such a rush? I bet your socks have shrunk and your toes itch.”
Draco woke from a dream of long limbs and murky water, of breaking through the surface to bright sunlight. A memory, he realised, from long ago. The soft sound of birdsong signalled the start of a new day, although the light that filled the room was still grey and weak. Beside him, Harry murmured in his sleep.
"Can I… can I join you?"
"And then when I let go," Potter continued, "all the terrible feelings came back. I slept that night wrapped half around the tree, just to get to some peace."
"And during the process, I will be able to discover if any wider curse is associated with an object in your home. Or so I hope," Malfoy added. His face softened a fraction as he returned Harry's smile.
Harry closed his eyes and relived some of those memories of the early days before looking into the Pensieve again. He’d grown to love Draco’s flat, and when they decided to find a place together a few years down the line, they’d come back to the narrow streets by the river. Harry was still very fond of slow breakfasts and lying naked with daylight playing over their bodies. He sighed: they’d always had demands on their time, but they had less to spare now that their responsibilities at work had grown. He brought his knees up to his chin, and rested his head while he stared into the empty Pensieve. They weren’t getting any younger, and Harry knew that Kingsley was quietly training him to take Robards’ place one day.
Draco’s body stiffened, and he made to pull back, but Harry kept his hand on the lower part of Draco’s back. "I don’t care," he whispered in Draco’s neck. "I’m not ashamed of you, I won’t hide this."
Eddie rolled out a little call – not quite a hoot – and up on her perch, Gladys ruffled her feathers, and Harry laughed. “I’ll take that to mean you don’t want me to step on Eddie, either,” he said. “Whatever you actually meant.”
“Knock it off.” Pansy lit a cigarette, her hands working automatically as she scrutinised Draco. “Something’s different,” she said after blowing out her first cloud of smoke. Harry recognised the small twitch of Draco’s nose. He was probably considering casting a Bubble Head Charm.
Draco gasped, and the sound filled the hallway, the touch of it bursting the illusion. The lines of light and shadow shifted, and Draco stumbled as the world seemed to sway around him. He steadied himself with a hand against the wall, and looked around to find that he was again alone in his hallway. The only evidence of his vision was his still racing heart and – damn it! – a hungry lick of arousal filling his belly. He could almost, but not quite, feel hands ghosting across his skin.
“No, it isn’t.” Draco got even quieter, and Harry could have kicked himself for saying anything.
The food arrived and they settled down into their familiar chat and laughter, and Draco wondered what Potter was doing. He banished the thought as soon as it popped up, chiding himself for the sentimentality.
“What?” Draco swam back up from his cataloguing of all the pleasant sights of Henry. “I’m not getting my hands stuck in that.”
“Do you need to sit down? Your le—”
“You living with him?”
The others fell silent, until somebody whooped. The light seemed to swirl around the room for a moment more, then disappear up into the arched ceiling.
“It’s quite satisfying, actually,” Hermione said. “Although it takes so much longer.”
After Potter left, Draco returned to his workshop. His hand wavered as he picked up a strip of metal, and stopped, hand and metal mid-air. He stared. Perhaps he should go upstairs and have a cup of tea before returning to work. A strange, unsettled feeling had befallen him, as though he’d been drinking coffee for hours. As Draco put the strip down he shook his head; no one should have to see their heroes fallen.
“What? Yes,” Harry said, his voice rippling with amusement. “‘Naked sunbathing this way’, remember?” He wiggled his hips, causing his tanned erection to bob in front of Draco’s face. “Enough with the looking though, you can do that later.”
Harry
“I know.” Harry sighed. “But there are some good practices… It’s just the timing, really. There are so many files to go through, and doing it in a week at any time of the year would be hard, but knowing Christmas is coming…”
“We can walk and talk,” Zabini said.
“I think… I think Potter was still nearby. He isn’t always in the visions, but they are always about him.” Draco was reluctant to describe the times he’d seen himself alone, grief-stricken.
Hannah coughed from the other side of the room.
“You can be those things,” Harry said, “and also have moments of happiness.”
“Honestly, it’s fine.” Harry reached out for Draco’s arm again. It was more still this time, as if Draco were feeling calmer. “And you’re not that bad, you know. As company.” The slow blush grew on Draco’s face again, and Harry decided that it would be worth paying him some more compliments at some time, just to see that reaction.
Draco shivered, because fuck yes that’s what his body craved. He leant forward, and steadied his hands on the wide smooth trunk of the tree, and waited with body braced against earth and tree.
"Bits come off all the time. They like giving them up to birds for their nests, too."
George put his fork down and sat back in his chair. “Do you know what you’re becoming, Harry?” he asked.
“She’s not here,” Draco said. He looked around the room. “I guess this is goodbye,” he said.
Draco kept quiet, because in many ways that was precisely what this one had done.
A breeze cooled the sweat on his skin a little; by midday, the heat had once more become unbearable. The change in temperature possible within just a few hours was almost as hard to adjust to as the heat itself. As Draco cooled down slightly, he was able to take in his surroundings a little better. Bright green leaves swayed on thin, striped-white trunks. He’d always liked birch trees; in his mind, they always seemed as though they could up sticks and walk away whenever they fancied.
Potter smiled then, just enough to lift the corners of his mouth. “I was curious about what your reaction would be.”
Draco nodded. “Several can be used in one Snitch, or only one. It all depends on what you want from your Snitch.”
“I see you’ve made the most of the morning already,” Hermione said. Harry looked up to see Malfoy walk into the room. Harry’s hand froze, his spoonful of porridge halfway to his mouth. Malfoy’s hair was a pale purple colour. Lilac, Harry thought. And it was… sparkling.
"Oh." She blinked a few times. "How lovely to see you, Draco. Harry said that you were here."
"What exactly did Guillaume tell you?"
“Er, hi?”
“Muggles are more used to injuries being permanent?” Odwolfe asked.
“Cup of tea and something to eat, then? I’m hungry.” Draco wasn’t actually that hungry, but the tremor he’d seen in Potter’s leg may have been to do with more than excitement, because it hadn’t gone away since they’d left the Wasps’ stadium.
“Just call us by our names,” Harry said wearily.
Draco stared at the folder. He wanted to go back downstairs to get all the wings pressed out, but at the same time he knew that if he did there was a good chance that he’d be preoccupied with wanting to read through the file. He sat back down again, and laid out all the clippings, reports, and photos. Better to puzzle for a few minutes than ruin a day’s work by being careless.
“I would like to see the Snidgets, you know,” Potter said when they left.
“These two thought that it would be fun to pick on someone half their size.” She turned to the boys again. “Look, I get it. But there are other ways to prove how tough you are. Ones that don’t hurt people. Consider Harry here, he’s done his hero thing, but I think it’s also great that he’s been making friends since the war. It… it doesn’t get better unless we make an effort. We had to learn the hard way, but you lot have a chance to do better now. So apologise.”
None of these things explained why Malfoy had crept out of bed at night, or what he was doing in the burned-out husk of the Room of Requirement.
“I—” Draco looked about him in horror, at the ruined food, at the crumbs and the faces peering at him. He could hear the whispers start and he could hear the name ‘Malfoy’ being repeated with laughter. He wanted to sink into the floor, or better still vanish entirely. Instead he rose to his feet and ran back to the screens at the back of the door. He had to get out, and then he could Apparate home back to Henry and he’d just never come here again. There must be other places that needed dishwashers. He ran blindly out, pushing past people in his eagerness to get to the exit.
, he added mentally.
“Only there’s more chance of you and Harry getting tog—” Weasley’s eyes went comically wide as he took in Harry leaning into Draco, and then he closed them tight. He grunted as he stood up again. “I better go find someone to fix me up. You two… I think you two have some unfinished business.”
He remembered well their first chance meeting; Draco’s memories merely added another layer to his own. Borough Market had been busy, with low striped awnings fluttering in the spring breeze. Harry’s bag was already filled with the kind of foods he’d never had as a child: olives and preserves, fiery chillies, and cold-pressed juices. He was tasting cheese at a stall when he was jostled from behind. Turning to apologise, the words had died on his lips as he had realised that it was Draco Malfoy who had bumped into him. The surprise of seeing him in the busy market filled with strangers – in Muggle clothes no less, and with close-cropped hair – had left him blinking and bumbling. Watching in the Pensieve, Harry winced slightly at how clumsily he had spoken to Draco. At the same time he could see too how Draco’s eyes had widened, the slight pinking of his cheeks, and his nervousness around Harry.
There was no denying that he was a man in peak physical condition. And easy on the eye. Draco thought back again to Granger’s question, and an unexpected pang of regret hit him: there really was too much past, but if Potter were a stranger, then yes, Draco could admit that he would be interested. If only for a one-time thing: Potter didn’t seem to be the settling-down type.
There was no moment when Draco was not conscious that this was their last day alone like this. His last day when he could swim naked with Harry amongst the tiny silver fishes. The first day he could stop and kiss Harry in the middle of the pool.
It was like being a tree, being fucked by a tree. Draco felt the flow of the earth through his hands, through Harry’s cock, through the rhythm of Harry thrusting into him. Was it like fucking a tree for Harry?
“I like to mop,” Luna said. “I make the mop dance.”
“Did what?” Malfoy said, affecting innocence. His hands behind his head, he stretched into a lengthy yawn. The green silk of his pyjamas slid down his arms a little, revealing the edge of a faded Dark Mark. Harry’s throat went dry at the sight of it, and he made an effort to wrench his eyes back up to Malfoy’s face. “I’ve just woken up, and I can assure you that I’m not doing anything on purpose just yet.”
Hermione cleared her throat. “I… Maybe I was a little abrupt just now. I’ll think about what you said.” She dipped her head then offered Molly a shy smile. “And thank you. I’m glad you’re Ron’s mum.”
“These copies all look identical, you did a good job with them.”
“Why do people keep saying that?” asked Draco, while Henry blushed. Privately though, Draco could admit that perhaps his glances at Henry sometimes lingered a little longer than they should. Henry was, after all, a good-looking man. However much they cooked and slept and even occasionally worked together though, they weren’t a couple. If they were it would be simple for Draco to reach out and squeeze Henry’s leg, or brush that bit of hair away from his face. Or even to lean over, and plant a soft kiss by his ear.
“Come on. I’ll show you around. It’ll only take a minute.” Henry chuckled and Draco scowled. He opened the door to the small cottage – it was unlocked, Draco noticed – and stepped aside to let Draco in.
Only when Harry’s body seemed completely loose to Draco, did Draco sit back and admire his handiwork.
Draco thought about it. "It must have been bad, whatever it was, for you to run away."
As the counter began to click round, Malfoy and Parkinson both sat forward and began to shout out words.
“Oh yes,” Harry said, watching the way Malfoy grinned and looked up at the same time. He looked as though he were up to mischief. Delightful mischief. “They seem to be getting on.”
“Draco here is giving me the most fascinating introduction to the world of Snitches,” Potter said, smiling broadly enough to show his teeth. Draco stared at him. “I’ve already had a glimpse of his workshop, but he spoke in such high terms of the work you do here at Ogilvy and Taylors, I knew I had to see it for myself.”
"Oh?" said Harry, wiping the plate dry and putting it away. He had been lost in thought, remembering how lonely a job washing up used to be for him. "Sorry, what?"
. Harry got such a thrill from hearing that. Draco sounded so… bossy.
"She is well, and sends her thanks for the new Calming Draught you sent," Draco said. Severus nodded in acknowledgement and showed them in. His home was dark, and the rooms small, yet it looked comfortable, and Harry knew that in the evening with the fire lit, he might even go so far as to describe it as cosy. Although not within Severus's hearing.
“Will Master be wanting bacon with his toast this morning?”
“Oh, good,” Harry said. “We didn’t really talk much yesterday, did we?”
“I mean do you remember the stuff that was in here? It was a treasure trove. All that hidden loot.”
“How’s training? Ron raves about his and Neville’s mentor – what’s his name, Savage? – in his owls.”
Twilfitt and Tattings, Harry thought, not Madam Malkin’s. He’d never hear the end of it, otherwise.
"It’s like an echo. Like the past just won’t let go." Potter sagged slightly, his shoulders dipping down. "I made mistakes, too. I hate being close to them. I… I think I get what you mean."
"No wonder you have to be careful lighting fires around them."
Their first port of call was the new sitting room. Without the others around, the room seemed lifeless.
A cold wind blew around them, carrying with it a promise of snow as Harry and Draco Apparated home, arms still clasped firmly around each other.
“And brandy, too.”
“I’m looking forward to seeing Ron and Hermione, too,” Harry said. “They’re staying with George, and will still be here tomorrow. I think Hermione said something about Millie coming, too.”
to match Hermione's, and then cleaned and healed the deeper cut on his shoulder.
idiotic boy. And I think Draco is yours. And to be honest, you are being so thick-skulled about this I rather think that you’re matched on the idiotic front, too.”
He was only halfway through both his list of contraindicated herbal combinations, and his tea, when Susan had come to sit next to him.
“It was a timer, for you, which would have told you how long you had left before each bond wore off. I had it charmed to change colour, and, er, I’d tried to align it a little to the magical signature of the curse.”
When Malfoy got to the glass-doored cabinets on either side of the fireplace, he sighed. "It seems my work here is done," he said. "But I bet these were crammed to the top with evil little things, weren't they?"
"You don’t need me. No, you need Monsieur Pas-de-baguette."
And what was Draco, then? Another temptation? Another way to numb the feelings?
“Almost as though to suggest that you are… available.”
“Oh, darling, you’re home!” His mother rose and threw her arms around him, in a most un-Narcissa way. “I was so worried. We both were.” She held onto his shoulders and looked him over. “But look at you! Your hair needs a good trim, and we need to get you into some proper clothes.”
“I’m not sure I’m following.”
"I don’t fucking know. And I didn’t come here for you. I came because Ollivander threw me out! Told me I didn’t get the soul of trees, and not to come back until I did!"
Ollivander’s chair creaked as he leant forward again, and Draco’s attention snapped back onto him. "This wand is different to the ones I make. It’s also different from the ancient ones I’ve seen. It seems that you, Draco Malfoy, are becoming a wandmaker. A true wandmaker finds their own way, makes their own mark on the world of magic."
"Mmm… beech," said Ollivander. "Around 10 inches… flexible… and…" he weighed it in his hands, and Draco watched fascinated. He’d seen Ollivander do this hundreds of times before, but always imagined it was mostly for show, the wands memorised or their labels read. But now he could see the shifts in Ollivander’s face, even in the way he held his body, that meant he was feeling different aspects of the wand. "Ah, unicorn core."
Andromeda waited until he’d left the room. “Draco, Harry tells me you’re living as a Muggle now.”
“Fine. Greg dropped something there when we first moved in. A potion. The magic seeped right into the floorboards, and we don’t know how to fix it without ruining them. We don’t want to lose our deposit, and the effects are… interesting. ”
He took up position in a corner, wrapped and hidden in his cloak.
Flitwick stopped the class to explain the two charms needed to complete the Protean Charm. “Remember that this charm changes the
Maybe Draco was right. Maybe Harry’s life was a little too safe, a little too predictable. Perhaps it was time for a change.
Malfoy took a deep breath before saying the next name, and his wand wavered, for just a second. When he spoke though, his voice was strong and clear. "Andromeda Black, married Edward Tonks," and the names slowly appeared. All the old scorch marks were accounted for, but Malfoy didn't lower his wand. He looked over at Harry again, and his eyes were sad. He returned to the tapestry. "Nymphadora Tonks," he said, "married Remus Lupin." Finally he added "Ted Lupin," and stepped back. There was no more gold thread left.
Merlin, he was drunk. He hoped he didn’t remember this ode to Malfoy’s fucking eyelashes in the morning. It had just been too long… not that Harry really looked at anyone. Too busy being miserable. Except now here he was, with charming bastards and lovely lashes all around him.
“About that,” the minstrel shuffled from one foot to the other. “I flew here; is there any chance of a broom for your boy? Unless he wants to share, of course.”
She shrugged, and glanced over at Harry. “Not too bad,” she said softly. Harry felt his cheeks heat, but he was glad that she didn’t seemed as annoyed with him any more: that Silencing Charm had saved the day. Maybe it wouldn’t be too bad if they ended up stuck together for more than a few hours.
“Don’t say that,” Ron said, staring at Malfoy’s red hair. “Mum will be inviting him over for lunch and trying to feed him roast potatoes before you know it. I’m not sure I’m ready for that.”
Malfoy stared at him. "Your home which has been, in your words, trying to kill you."
“Yes.”
“What?”
Potter nodded. "Well, it’s not too hard to work out when the limb is lying beneath the tree, is it? Oak wood, and oak tree", he said pointing at the fire and then the tree. "Plus it… felt like it belonged."
“Oh, I assure you, I did. I think what happened to him was the beginning of every doubt I had about Voldemort. Such a waste.”
“Nor did I! But it felt right. Are you going home now?”
"Thank you," she said. "And thank you for all the help. Now, come inside properly."
“I can’t believe you didn’t ask me what they were called before you went on your naming spree.”
Potter was smiling – grinning, really. "I think you’re getting it."
“Oh come off it, Harry, I know you’re not that stupid. He was practically sitting up like a puppy dog, hanging off her every word.”
"Is that all, sir? Only perhaps I should go and owl Malfoy to let him know—"
“I always assumed that you lived in a little Muggle house somewhere.”
“Okay?”
“OK, meet you by the steps,” Ron said, and he packed up his stuff more quickly than Harry thought possible, and gave Hermione a quick kiss, then headed off.
After the weeks of blue skies and still, hot afternoons, London was a shock. The skies were grey, and soft drizzle fell, giving the streets a misty, washed-out look. Draco’s leg felt stiff, the soft ache of the break a constant as Draco travelled in a daze, one foot following the other until he found himself back at Greg’s front door.
"The back room above yours would make a better bedroom for you, you know," said Malfoy.
the Quaffles like Asher,” Malfoy said. He sounded so like his younger self, Harry got goosebumps.
Potter smiled. “That’s interesting.” He made a note on his parchment. “You’re being very helpful, thank you.”
“So did your mum and dad really have to dance naked around a Beltane bonfire?” Harry asked Ron.
“I don’t think so, mother. We’ve got to get back: it’s market day today and we’ve got work to do.”
Wary of disturbing his now-perfect sliver sheet, Draco moved towards Potter. “Let’s go upstairs. I don’t want to mess up anything in here.” He removed his apron, and carefully pulled off his gloves. They stuck slightly, hot and damp with sweat inside. He persevered, inching them off a little at a time, then laying them beside his apron on a clear section of worktop.
Second, Malfoy wasn’t eating enough. Harry watched him carefully at meal times. There were no more treat-laden owls from home, but Malfoy was also only managing a bite of his toast in the morning, half a sausage here, one forkful of mash there. His skin was looking paler than ever, and the dark circles under his eyes got darker every day. Every plate he pushed away infuriated Harry; he longed to pick up a fork and get Malfoy to eat more.
"I do not."
"I think it's time for bed," said Harry, still watching Malfoy. He had unbuttoned the top of his robes, and Harry could see the hollows of his neck, just visible through the gap.
“You… I…”
The lake water was cold, but Harry still wiggled his toes in appreciation. His friends were both working, and he was grateful for the peace and quiet, for this chance to sit outside with his feet in water. He picked up a small stone and threw it in, watching as dark shadows rose in its wake. It disappeared from sight, and as it sank Harry returned to his rambling and confused thoughts about Malfoy.
“I do, but he’s at Hogwarts now.”
"Just meeting your basic physical needs," said Harry, and he was gratified to see a hint of a smile on Malfoy's lips. As they walked up the stairs, Harry felt hopeful that today Malfoy would be a little more... bearable.
"Neville Longbottom sent me here."
“You don’t know how we’re going to react until you actually say it,” Ron said gently. Harry suspected Hermione hadn’t been entirely right with her teaspoon comment.
Harry doubted it. Why else have the two handprints on the door? He could see Malfoy would need some persuading. Or simply didn’t want that to be the answer.
“I– I’ve met someone.”
“I don’t know what you hoped to achieve with that little meeting.”
Harry realised that he was staring again. Malfoy kept surprising him, with his startling tendency to say exactly what he was thinking. Also, Harry quite liked the hawk-like brightness Malfoy wore along with his look of amusement. There was a challenge to it, and it was a change from the fawning of people like Bob.
"I need…"
A stumble had them all spinning round, in time to see Ron narrowly dodging a Stunner as he came out from behind a mirror, Neville following closely behind.  “Savage,” he said, his voice tight with nerves. Draco met Harry’s eyes: Ron had come from the other direction to Hestia and Savage.
When Harry released him, Draco was panting.
“Nah, mate. Thanks though. I’ve got to get to the shop. George wants me to get the Christmas stock ready, can you believe it. Christmas! It’s only just been Halloween.”
“I wondered about the balls. Did you use yours, or were they switched for League balls before the match?”
Harry wondered how long Ron could talk around the question he was obviously working towards. Luckily, Hermione wasn’t as patient.
“We’re not going to get the first one perfect, are we?” Malfoy said. “And there are still five more to come out.”
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Harry said with a cough as Draco’s spell took effect. “It was only a stunner.”
“I didn’t say I’d
Malfoy approached Harry with a speculative look on his face. Harry, for once, felt confident about his ability to escape any kind of hold that Malfoy could try. Malfoy reached out for Harry, and paused before he touched him. Harry nodded, appreciating the gesture. Malfoy was always an impeccable opponent in any sparring or duelling. Even Harry could admit that he’d changed in that regard since Hogwarts.
“Don’t you want to see it?” Draco asked.
“I’d like a word with you, Harry, when I’m done. See you in my office at 10, okay?”
“Ghost.” Pansy sat back with a biscuit, looking pleased.
“I was right about one thing though.”
“We’ve missed you.” It was and wasn’t a reproach. Guilt curled within Harry; he knew not seeing Andromeda and Teddy was one of the reasons he couldn’t sleep at night. The sense of duty was like a dead weight, pulling him down.
Henry shrugged. “I was doing fine until you came along. That’s not to say that it’s awful having you here, it’s just that for us to be able to stay here, like this, you’re going to need to get a job.”
Harry kissed along Draco’s legs, then began to undo his trousers. He could still smell the intoxicating scent of his arousal from before, a sort of sense-memory that mingled with the touch of fabric on his face, the warmth of Draco’s skin, and then the heat of Draco, hard under his mouth.
Luna smiled, as though she knew something Harry didn’t. “It’ll be fine. You’ll see.”
“Nothing like a swim in open water on a day like today.”
“I haven’t heard anything, and I don’t really expect to,” Draco said.
Harry closed his eyes to a sudden onslaught of dizziness, and saw again Malfoy in the dark, his hair gleaming in the moonlight. His heart started thudding in his chest again.
"Breathe," Draco said. "I’m going to make you feel so good."
Potter’s eyes were wide and bright when he asked his next question. “I wonder… who supplies which team?”
Harry felt a surge of panic rush through him.
Lukewarm but still good, the coffee was strong just the way Draco liked it. He drank slowly, watching as Potter packed up their small camp. When he put his cup down, he ran his hand through the dry leaves beside him. They were hard, smooth-edged, and thicker than the leaves in the woods at home. He couldn’t work out what they were, and it was frustrating: he’d spent a year learning the trees of the British Isles but this one was new to him.
you find someone in time? Gamble with our futures?”
Draco ran a hand across Harry’s back. Harry was all warmth and skin, and he stopped moving for a moment, then turned and bent down to kiss Draco with a mouth that tasted of Butterbeer and chocolate frogs. He got a hand under the covers, and hummed in appreciation.
"That's not a very encouraging response," said Malfoy. "Maybe it's just not something you've been aware of before." He sucked his top lip in as he thought. "We'll test it," he said, "I'll go outside, and walk up to the door. I want you to pay especial attention to anything that feels out of the normal, no matter how slight."
"I was going to leave this room until last, but seeing as I'm here now I think I might as well examine it now."
Ron sat back and folded his arms. “Yeah, but you didn’t, because you didn’t want to.”
As it turned out, there really wasn't much of interest in either Sirius or Regulus's rooms, beyond old school books, a dented old set of gobstones, and a wizarding chess set with a missing knight and a huge crack across the board. Which only left another three floors to explore.
“Well, yeah. Draco doesn’t make things up. And, er—“
Harry’s resolve crumbled. He had thought she looked a little peaky, but he was so used to Draco and his weariness when he was on nights… Crumbs. Three days without sleep? “Of course, sir. I understand.”
Malfoy spooned out the grey goop. No one could quite meet his eyes.
do, a little bit,” said Ron. “And you do too, don’t you, Harry?”
As soon as they had acknowledged one another, Potter moved towards the table and ran both hands along the case. Draco, knowing what was coming, stood back. Secretly, as soon as he’d heard it was a violin he would be evaluating, he’d been hoping that Potter might turn up. Potter eased the clasps open, the clicks echoing in the quiet of the room.
"I didn’t bring anything with me," Draco said. "I’m going to have to wear your clothes. This is your last chance to unbutton me for a while."
"I never use it," she said. "I was going to try deliveries, but my time is better spent in here. Go on." She thrust the broom into his hands.
Harry reached out for Hermione’s hand. “We shouldn’t have had to live through any of that,” he said.
Malfoy’s smile became a little strained. “It’ supposed to last a few hours. But, er, Greg’s been like this since breakfast.”
Harry remained silent. Because how could he answer that, after what he’d just read?
“Isn’t until the week after.” Robards started rifling through the papers on his desk with such force, several of them fluttered to the floor. Harry knew better than to attempt to pick any of them up or acknowledge that they’d fallen.
. The words were hard to say; they hurt coming up. Draco couldn’t bring himself to say the last ones aloud, but he thought that perhaps Harry had heard them anyway.
“Sorry! It’s just Malfoy’s been stuck to him and—”
“Yes, yes, of course, sorry,” said Harry. “What’s your name?”
“I wanted you to meet my husband, Draco Malfoy,” Harry told the assembled group of his friends. Draco almost fell over – whatever introduction he was expecting, it hadn’t been that – but Harry held him steady.
Working, and talking.
Harry sobbed into Draco’s shoulder, unable to do anything else as the sadness filled him.
“What do you use the magic for, then?”
“You have concrete evidence to present to the Wizengamot. Considering that Thompson’s house was Unplottable, I’d say that was an achievement. Robards will be pleased.”
"This bed is not, nor has it ever been, cursed," announced Malfoy as the bead of blue light made its way back to his wand. "It is now just an ugly pile of broken wood: there's no need to keep it around," he added. Harry took this as his cue and Vanished it with a twist of frustration.
"I see them all," says Potter. "The ones who died. Sometimes I think I'm going mad."
Images raced through his mind: twisting stone lines growing and stretching, the changing shapes of blue and green glass, all interspersed with Malfoy’s bright eyes, Malfoy’s hand on his arm, Malfoy calling him ‘Harry’.
“You can’t go back to the eighth-year rooms looking like that.”
"It was an accident," Harry said, wincing as he shifted his weight to sit up a little.
“It’s lucky your roast potatoes are nearly as good as mum’s,” Ron said. “We wouldn’t come otherwise, you know.”
“My landlady kicked me out when she found out who I was.” Greg looked miserable. “But I don’t expect you’ll want me here, either.” He looked up and met Harry’s eyes. “I’m not welcome anywhere.”
“Only…” She sighed. “He’s fragile at the moment.”
“Draco,” he said. “Draco.”
"Yes, well I'm sure that you'd be enthralled to hear some 'little theories' about what you're doing with the Weasel here, but I'll refrain from sharing them," Draco said.
“I’ve seen you cooking. That’s enough.” Draco smiled to himself: he quite liked how Henry bit down, denting his lip and half-frowning as he concentrated.
"Then why isn't it dogs? These look like... greyhounds, don't they?"
“Fuck me,” Draco said, and Harry could barely see as he nodded and brought a hand to Draco’s arse.
A combination of begrudging respect for his abilities and anger at his lack of remorse left Harry in a constant state of confusion. He was torn between watching Malfoy with undisguised fascination, and wanting to see him break down with guilt for what he’d done. How dare he be so bloody competent? Secretly, Harry knew that he also wished that he had half the confidence that Malfoy showed in each and every session they shared. He felt as if there was some kind of barrier between his desire to become an Auror – still burning strong – and his actual ability to fulfil half of what they covered in class.
"No," said Harry. "Tell me that this isn't your plan to 'talk to the house'." Malfoy stopped, and looked back.
“That—” Potter’s voice sounded tight, and he cleared his throat. “That would be helpful. I keep getting to the limit of what I know and… well, that’s why I came to you. Because you know about Snitches.”
“Yes.”
"Even when snow comes through the roof?"
" Malfoy said, moving his wand in a looping gesture between the tree, and Harry. A faint line grew between Harry and the family tree, blinking in and out of existence.
“I, er, I’ll bear that in mind.” Now the silence definitely was awkward, and Harry wished the bed would swallow him up. Instead, he rolled away.
Harry was dimly aware of the front door opening and closing. He’d lost track of where Blaise was, and wondered if he was leaving or arriving. Either way it didn’t matter: everything that Harry needed was right here.
He could also see how he’d been looking down on the training sessions, the talks, even the other Aurors. Because what did they know? Had they died? Had they seen into Voldemort’s soul? Harry felt shame, hot and bitter, sweep through him. For all that he couldn’t work without a team to back him up, perhaps his real weakness was that he pushed people away and only focused on himself. He really was no hero if he could think like that.
Harry’s heart was tight and full in his chest; it felt as though it could burst at any moment. He swung the gate open with a flourish, and took advantage of Malfoy then being ahead of him to admire his whole figure. How could grey wool suit someone so well?
Draco flew down to the pool and dismounted. The rocks, not yet sun-warmed, were cold, and the place felt empty. He washed his face, picked up the broom, and headed along the familiar track to Harry’s place. It felt good to be moving again after the long night on the broom, and Draco noticed too that even with the aches of his journey, it was easier than it had been with his partially healed leg.
They walked back afterwards, pleasantly full and in a companionable silence. When they stopped by the front door, the thick snake which formed the doorknob uncurled slightly to greet Harry again. By the time they had got inside, Harry's cheeks were burning, the snake having asked him how the sex on a stick was; Malfoy also looked a little flushed, and Harry resolved to find more opportunities to talk to snakes.
“What, like Mrs Snettisham?” Potter shot back. “She was delightful, wasn’t she?”
Draco was too in his body for words, so responded instead by building up to a rhythm of in and out.
“Accidents, each time.” Harry frowned though: it had been, what, three, four times? “He just happened to be there at the wrong time.” He stopped walking, and someone jostled into him and muttered under their breath about idiots. Harry ignored them. “It was an accident, wasn’t it?”
Empty corridors at night made him think of invisibility cloaks, and magic maps, and huge dogs with three heads, and Harry smiled. His smile fell though, as his thoughts returned to Malfoy. Sometimes he thought he’d seen Malfoy watching him, a speculative, almost hungry look in his eyes, but Harry wasn’t sure. If Malfoy came too near to him, Harry would often act overly aggressive, which seemed to keep him at bay. Harry wasn’t sure if he did it because Malfoy annoyed him, or because he wanted to be pushed to the ground again. He tried not to dwell on it, dreams excepted.
Draco looked at Harry once more, planted a kiss on the end of his nose, then raised his head and said, “Come in!”
Harry’s voice had got louder, and Seamus turned to see what they were talking about. “Something you want to tell us, Harry?”
When Henry found the right space – near a bin and at the edge of the market – he greeted the woman at the nearest stall.
Harry continued to stare at the rather unexciting wall. He wanted to fix this, all of it, but he didn’t know how. Any further attempts at conversation were mercifully avoided when Hestia opened her door and ushered them in.
A knock came at the door, and Draco snorted. “A bit late now,” he whispered. Harry bent down for just one more kiss; he really didn't want to have to let anyone into their little bubble, and he knew Draco didn’t either. Reluctantly, he reached for the duvet - long since abandoned on the floor - and covered the both of them.
Draco kept moving, pushing his crotch onto Harry’s even as Harry was thrusting with each spurting wrench of ejaculation. Then he too came, making a small noise almost like a cry. He dropped down onto Harry.
“I’m… I…” The words weren’t coming out at all now.
“So?”
“I– He’s visiting for a while. Thought he could give me a hand with selling.”
Draco wasn’t at all surprised to hear this. “Are you staying for dinner?” Luna asked.
“So where do we start?”
"Okay," said Harry, still feeling stunned.
They walked, side by side, their arms brushing from time to time. Draco didn’t know if Harry felt it too, the waves of delicious shock sent through his body with each touch. If he did, he didn’t show it. Draco lost track of where they were, of anything around him, as he focused on the touches, on the warmth of Harry in that tiny moment. He only became aware again of his surroundings when Harry stopped walking. To the left of the path was a small body of open water, filled with Muggles.
"I think it’s best you stay with me for now. I can’t have you hacking away at trees or handling bits of wood you don’t understand. Sorry, but I feel… responsible for these woods now. At least the magical part, anyway."
Harry snorted. “Nor Slytherin.”
“I’d like you to have three months off. A sabbatical, we’ll call it.” Robards said. He held his hand up to Harry’s protest. “Kelvin agrees.” Robards slid a parchment over, signed at the bottom by the departmental Healer.
Malfoy turned to Zabini. “Don’t you ‘Draco’ me, Blaise. You know how angry I am.”
Potter wasn’t talking about trees, Draco knew that. He moved his face closer to Potter’s face, saw the way his eyes widened. He felt the ground beneath his body, the layers of leaf and dirt, the tangle of roots and worms. Rooted in the earth, rising from it like a tree, he leaned forward and touched Potter’s mouth with his lips. The response he got was immediate: warm and hungry, Potter’s mouth fitted to his own. A groan rose from deep within Draco, and he grabbed Potter’s t-shirt to pull him closer.
“Does Draco seem a little… more tense than normal?”
"Maybe." Harry sounded though he were sporting a cheeky grin on his face.
"Oh yes," said Draco, "I could see how she could pity you this." Above them the blue sky shone with the intensity of a jewel, and around them leaves muttered and whispered amongst the loud insects. "It’s terrible here."
Harry smiled at Luna. “Brilliant. So what did you find out? Can you do it now?”
“You really don’t want to be here, do you?”
“You’re exhausted.”
Draco declined her offer to collect any of his belongings, and he and Harry set off to walk back down to the gate.
Draco hesitated. The last time Potter had offered him tea, he had found the whole experience distinctly uncomfortable. Neither had anything to say to the other. But he could do with a proper cup of tea, and the fire did look awfully inviting.
“Yes. And… do you want to move a little closer. I bet you’ve been worrying away there and shivering at the same time, haven’t you?”
. Malfoy it would stay. When he and
Now it was a rattling house with an aloof cat, and at its centre, Draco. Beyond the clouds, the sky was a bright, clear blue. Maybe what he was feeling was just a strange and tingling-skin crush, and maybe it would pass. But then again, maybe it was a chance for something new in his life… maybe it was hope. Sadness mingled, bitter-sweet, with longing. And threaded through both, a deep fear that somehow this couldn’t be, that Harry didn’t really deserve any of it.
"Of course," Malfoy said. "But I thought we had already covered the topic of my need to wear well-fitting clothes."
“I’ve read
Harry was having trouble breathing. He was used to Draco lying next to him in bed, but this felt so much more… public. One of Draco’s legs had come free of his robes, and was lying, naked and hairy, next to Harry’s head.
“You want me to tell you every little detail?” asked Draco. “It’s not that interesting.”
going to be the one to define who I am, what I do, not anyone else. Certainly not you, with your little pity-party and fumbling half-arsed attempts at every task put before you. I don’t know why you don’t seem able to give a shit about trying properly, and quite frankly I don’t care. But you are not going to mess up my chances. Understand?”
“Oh, right. Where was I? Oh yes, she said that you’ve got loads of rooms. And, er, I need somewhere to stay.” The smile faded from her eyes. “Dad’s at St Mungo’s, and our house… it’s…” She didn’t finish her sentence. Luna took a deep breath. “We’d only just finished rebuilding Rook House and now… it isn’t there anymore. We had a small problem with some walking Whomping Willows, and I don’t know if it was them or the shock, but Dad’s not in a good way.” She gave Harry a piercing look. “So can I come in, now? It’s freezing out here.”
“I… I was. Or scared, maybe. But then… I’d never been allowed to experiment like I have been here.”
“What many people don’t know is the unique history of St Paul’s. Used all over the world as a symbol for London, it was actually built after a firm of architects saw the 1964 movie
Harry thought of watching TV, never having to talk about the war or having his scar stared at. The tightness inside of him loosened slightly at the thought of it, at the thought of stepping out of his life, just for a while.
“Thanks.” Whatever other words Draco might have had disappeared when Harry walked in. He looked smaller somehow. Draco’s heart clenched at the thought that he’d done that to him; taken away some of Harry’s irrepressible energy.
“It doesn’t take much. And I can show you the basics. I’m not asking you to do all of it, just your fair share.”
“Watch out, Potter!”
The room felt even quieter than before once Potter stopped playing. “It’s exquisite, as well you know,” Potter said, then frowned. “What do you think Mrs Snettisham wants to do with it?”
"Oh," said Hermione. "Oh," she said again, and this time she was smiling through her tears. "I think maybe, you’ve both come home."
Harry breathed out in relief when he saw his spell had worked. When he looked up, Malfoy was holding a broom in his hand that looked not too dissimilar to a racing broom, with crooked handle and pointed bristles. Harry’s on the other hand, was Muggle-style, with a long wide head and even bristles.
“You keep taking away my reasons to kill you,” Pansy said, pouting. “But you do know how to keep me happy.” She sighed, and stretched back into the armchair, then flexed her stockinged toes. “I might not have had any war heroes or grande dames to deal with today, but work was still a bore.”
Malfoy pointed at her portrait, and there was another mumbled "Young man!" as Harry lowered it in front of Malfoy.
“You should have hit your head harder,” Draco said. His heart was racing.
“I am trying.” Draco sighed, but pulled the basket close to him again, grasping it carefully as he again tried to bend the reeds and weave the sides. “And it’s supposed to round out?”
“At the moon? Oh, I say,” Arthur said. He stared at Draco, then at Harry. “And whose idea was that?”
," said the snake, and it slithered back into a tight coil, gave one more hiss, then stopped moving. It was, again, a doorknob.
“Oh.” Harry sat back. He remembered Hermione cosied up to Draco, and the two of them laughing. Had they been talking about the tours, all the way back then? A novelty tour made sense. More sense than all the thoughts that had gone through his mind. A sick feeling of shame climbed and gripped Harry from the inside.
"At the top," said Malfoy immediately. "We'll start in the attic then work our way down."
He knew he would have to talk to them, soon. It was growing uncomfortable, not being totally honest with his two best friends. Harry stashed the thought away; it would be OK, and he deserved a private life as much as they did. At this moment the thing he needed more than anything else was to see Draco.
is it?” Harry finally looked up. “How long did it take you to stop calling me ‘Potter’, and yet you have no problem calling her ‘Hermione’?”
“Draco.” Harry took a deep breath, as though bracing himself for something terrible. “I–“ He started again. “Haven’t you learned yet never to doubt Hermione’s research?”
Trust. Draco had never thought he’d ever hear Potter talking to him about trust. Something – pride perhaps, or a long-seated desire for approval made him sit a little taller. Despite himself, Draco found himself nodding slowly.
“You’re still you,” Ron said softly, having calmed down instantly when George mentioned Fred.
When they got back to Grimmauld Place, Malfoy caught sight of himself in the large silvered mirror in the hallway. Harry watched as he scowled and got his wand out, Vanishing the smudge.
“You’re not even taking this seriously, are you?” Draco said.
“I notice that he didn’t put ‘Vanish owl shit’ onto his precious rota,” Harry said. He zapped another owl pellet and watched it disappear in satisfaction. “Although that was more a regurgitated mouse skeleton, wasn’t it?” He shuddered, then spotted another one that had rolled into one of the fireplaces, and Vanished it, too.
Harry gritted his teeth. Malfoy was as capable of being as much of a git as ever. It made the fledgling idea he’d had even harder to articulate.
"Did you bring the tent?"
“I… it’s complicated.” Frustration rose up in Harry, tying knots in his chest as it went. “Everyone thinks I'm this hero. First years stop talking when I come near. And here I am, unable to do a charm everyone else has cracked!”
that they were remembering the same thing. Potter looked away.
opinion?”
When everything was stowed away, Henry brought him a cup of tea.
“Oh, don’t give me your sob story, I’m in no mood to hear it. ‘It’s all so difficult and no one will let me do whatever I want to do.’ Well boohoo, Potter.”
Harry shut Draco up with a well-placed squeeze of his hand. “Let’s not talk about them at all. I’ve got a much better idea.”
“I—” Draco didn’t know what to say. He thought of his workshop, of the work left to do to finish his current batch of Snitches. “Maybe… tomorrow afternoon? I do need to get some work done.”
Seeing the look of determination on Malfoy's face, Harry was struck with the certainty that Malfoy really would do it.
Harry had already walked down the local high street - it was where he’d seen Dudley in the laundrette - so he decided instead to head into town. The main road was broad, busy with buses and trucks, cyclists and a mix of tired-looking town houses, shops, and offices. The skies though, were high and clear above; overnight rain had cleared the worst of the thickness from the air. There came a point, after a particularly busy junction, when more restaurants and sleeker-looking shops appeared on either side. Tall trees in full leaf provided shade, and Harry walked on, lost in the rhythm of his feet. The smarter the area became, the closer he thought he must be getting to the river. Soon enough he came to the back streets of Southwark, and correspondingly, large groups of tourists.
Malfoy shook his head, his lips sealed tight.
“Right.” Draco’s head felt light, and he took a sip of tea to try to steady himself a little. “You want me to weave baskets?”
"No, I can see that," said Malfoy, but Harry got the impression that he wasn't paying any attention to their conversation, as Malfoy's eyes moved around the room.
“I’m coming, Malf—“ He turned to see that it wasn’t Malfoy at all, but the woman they had seen earlier. “Oh, fuck.”
“How could I have not noticed before?” Hermione said.
There were pieces of parchment laid out across the table, each covered with flowing script and tidy diagrams. The weather had turned chilly overnight, and a fire was lit in the grate. Grey light filled the room as it rained steadily outside.
“Yes! But I’m good at potions, and I followed the recipe. I thought they were supposed to be the same.”
The flicking of the pages stops when Harry pulls out the chair beside Malfoy. And then, slowly, Malfoy does look up. His face looks pained, at war with itself. Harry just stands there, waiting. He knows that Malfoy can't afford to make a scene in such a public place. Malfoy's arm is cradled around the book now, his lips pressed tight together. His nostrils flare, but then he nods his head, unwraps his arm, and shoves the book into the centre of the desk.
Draco sighed. "No soul. I don’t get the soul of the wood."
“There are some individuals, however, who are still… struggling to find a place in today’s world.” Like Ollivander, who had been left shaken and scarred by his experiences. All wand fittings were now by appointment as he couldn’t cope with being around large numbers of people. “I understand from Hermione that you’ve take in young Goyle?”
"Oh," said Harry. He felt a rush of embarrassment at not having thought of that himself. "Well if you put it like that... Fine, we'll do it your way." He turned back and shuddered when he saw what the first thing was: he wouldn't have wanted to touch this anyway. He levitated the dried up old house-elf head towards to Malfoy, and lowered it in front of him. Malfoy's eyes lit up.
“we don’t really know each other, Potter.” Draco tried hard to maintain his air of insouciance.
"Look," said Harry, "it's all academic if I can't actually live there, isn't it?" Malfoy gave him one of his affronted glares, but sat back and took a sip from his coffee.
The sound of weeping filled the room. Harry couldn’t see Draco’s face, but he could imagine how it looked, screwed tight with pain. He had seen it like that before, in the moonlight. But he’d never heard his name.
Blaise looked rather as though he’d been hoping Harry wouldn’t turn up at all, giving him a small glare before turning his large, lopsided smile on. “Good to see you, Harry.”
“If he’s so wonderful, why would you want to?”
He cast his eyes at his fellow trainee. Malfoy's nose was pink in the cold, his breath misting in front of his face as he surveyed the space between the forest and the farm. They were supposed to be using Muggle techniques in Stealth and Tracking, to identify what kind of activity was taking place in the valley. So far all they had learned was that it was cold, and that Muggle clothes weren’t as good as warming charms.
"For how long though? One day? One week? One month? It won’t be summer forever."
Harry nodded. “Is that OK?”
“Did you know that the amount of time you knead dough for makes a difference to how the bread turns out?” she asked Harry as he stood in the doorway. “I’ve been experimenting,” she added.
Harry didn’t own many robes, so it didn’t take long to push them to one side. Emptying a drawer didn’t take much longer. He paused at the door. “Can I get you anything?”
"Stop thinking! I can see you, thinking." Harry’s eyes were dark. Predatory. "Yes, it would be OK. It would be great. It’s all… I’m… It’s been a while."
“It’s Greg.”
Potter looked over at Draco. “I… I suppose.”
“It’s not always about the recipe,” Harry said. “Sometimes it’s more about what works together. It might look awful on paper, but the most unexpected sets of ingredients might go to together.”
Beside him, Draco felt Narcissa tremble. Perhaps he shouldn’t have mentioned death. Lord Voldy had been pretty pale, hadn’t he? He swallowed down distaste at the thought.
thorough," Malfoy said, and then he did his sweeping off up the stairs thing again.
Hermione stretched, cat-like, dipping her toes lazily in the sea before looking around her. “I used to go on holiday with mum and dad, but nothing like this.”
"... and the most interesting thing about the fact that the decor remains unchanged, is that there are snakes everywhere," said Malfoy, pausing and giving Severus a meaningful look
“Come on, you’ve got to admit it’s a good idea.”
Potter laughed, a low rich sound. “I think I must be the most straight-forward person around. I like making violins, I spend time with my friends and I drink a lot of tea. What else is there to know about me?”
Harry looked over at Ron. He had hoped this wouldn’t come up, but it had, and now he had no idea what to do.
Harry sighed and stopped bouncing. “I think that I’ve cocked this all up.”
And then he’d been spun, roughly, and pushed against the high counter.
“But more than the workmanship, I want to know how it sounds.” Potter reached for the bow, and Draco silently clenched his hands at his side, letting his nails dig into his palms. Potter tightened the bow, turned the pegs and pinged the strings until he was satisfied that it was in tune. Then he closed his eyes for a moment, before playing a simple phrase, the elegant sound of Bach filling the room.
“You did a good job.” Harry decided it would be best to ignore Ron’s bad mood.
“No!” Draco flushed red. “I don’t want to. I can’t—”
"Not now," he murmured.
Harry smiled over the table at Draco, who was twirling spaghetti around his fork. The candlelight, soft music, and the wine were all working their magic on Harry. Gradually, his shoulders began to relax, and the buzzing that had filled his head all day eased a bit. He noticed the way that Draco’s eyelashes caught the light, and the way he talked quickly when on a subject of interest. He watched Draco’s fingers tear bread with efficiency and precision: a surgeon’s hands.
“I wonder how many wizarding traditions are based on fact, and how many are based on habit?” Hermione said, frowning.
“I’m sorry,” Dudley said, looking genuinely remorseful. “I’m sorry I was so mean to you, and I’m sorry your friends died.”
“What were you thinking, Potter?” he said, barely moving his mouth as he ground the words out. He held a hand up. “Actually, I don’t want to hear your excuses: save them for Hestia. I
"You would think you'd want to run a mile from your past," muttered George. Harry stepped forward to say something, but Draco put his hand on Harry's arm and shook his head.
“But this isn’t you and me in my workshop. This is your friends… your
“Care?”
The air outside the owlery was considerably fresher than inside.
Proudfoot’s eyes tightened, but he nodded at her. “Just don’t take too long.”
They swam back and forth until the water stopped feeling quite so cold, and Draco’s aches and pains were forgotten.
She hooted twice at that, and finally flew down to his shoulder. Altheda nuzzled her head in Harry’s neck.
There was a moment of silence before Harry cleared his throat. "So, er, where do you want to start?" he asked.
“You think my pots are lovely?”
“I'm serious.” The hand stopped moving, and then Harry found his head pushed off Ginny's lap. Sitting up to see what was wrong he saw that Ginny had drawn her knees up to her chin, and was hugging herself close. He tried to read the emotions playing across her face, but there was too much there. She was tense though, he could see that.
"Monsieur Pas-de-baguette."
"Ah," Luna said, sitting back in her chair, and a smile lighting her face. "Now I know why you’re here."
A shiver of breeze dislodged a scattering of heavy raindrops from the leaves above. A drop ran down Potter’s cheek like a tear, and Draco moved closer still to wipe it away. He moved his free arm to Potter’s jumper, pulling on a loose piece of yarn with his finger. “You wear the most awful clothes, Potter.”
"Some of the Order. Molly Weasley, Fred and George, Sirius. Ron and Hermione, too. We, er, we mainly bashed things to stop them working," said Harry.
“There is no way that you are anything other than a Gryffindor.” Draco shook his head as if he were trying to work out which other house Harry could possibly have been placed in.
“Oh,” Hermione said. The exact same response as George; was everyone going to say the same thing every time Harry had to come out? And how many times was that going to be, exactly?
“Of course,” said Ron. “But it’s your fault for making me watch all those films. And I don’t think that a Muggle cliché counts: as far as I’m concerned, it’s just a great idea.”
“Gregory Goyle brought him home, felt sorry for him. Insisted we give him his room when he fucked off to live with his girlfriend. They worked together. Bouncers.” Malfoy’s eyes were still wide, and he was staring at the TV. Harry suspected none of the adverts were going in though.
"No more strange than you turning up here with Harry in tow in the first place," said Severus. "And I thought that I'd taught you well enough that a little interruption wouldn't halt the flow of your thinking: please, tell me what you have ascertained so far."
Draco sighed. “And why do you have to be right, too? My father is odious.”
"Harry," Draco whispered, and he kissed Harry, like he meant it, just like he had the first time. Harry felt himself melt in warmth and the feeling that he was home.
“Something tells me you’ll cope.” Harry knew how much Draco loved a challenge. And suddenly, so did he. Harry was going to be a great Auror. For the first time, he believed it.
“I do not! How many times have I woken up to find you cocooned in a nest of blankets? Or curled up right up against—”
“It’s none of your business what I eat.” Malfoy said. He took his bowl into the other room, and didn’t talk to Harry again the rest of the evening.
“I’m freezing,” Harry said. “Do you want to walk back with me?”
“Killed them. By the mid-fourteenth century they were endangered. But luckily Bowman Wright invented the Snitch.”
Luna brought Harry lunch, and stayed to eat with him as they chatted through her investigations. Harry chewed carefully on the surprise sandwich she had made for him: the surprise, apparently, was that she’d put anything she fancied into it. The first bite of cooked apple had been somewhat interesting, especially combined with a large chunk of raw onion.
He stood, and walked away from the Pensieve, frustrated. It had been a long day, and he was too tired to deal with any of this.
“As it is a curse, it needs to be ended by someone, too. But the person who set the Fiendfyre in this room died before he could do that.”
Harry’s hand relaxed, letting the Snitch loose.
“No one could like me sweaty.”
Ron came to join him. “She’s beautiful, isn’t she?” Ron said, a tender smile lighting his face. “I love it when she’s happy like this.”
"And I care about honesty. I can’t believe you lied
“It’s OK,” said Ron. “Maybe I can stay after the others go back?”
"That doesn't have to be true," Potter says, and his voice is muffled next to Draco's ear, but the words spread through Draco like an ache. He doesn't know what he's doing, being hugged by Potter in a tent, but it feels so good to be close to someone like this, and so Draco hugs back.
"And you have your trees."
She smiled fondly. “All the time. We get to hear about your brilliant research ideas, and how amazingly pale your skin is, all over. Except when you blush.”
She linked her sun-warmed arm through his. “Of course it is,” she said.
“But you also wanted me to fix everything?”
Malfoy nodded at Ron.
“Please don’t,” Henry whispered. “Not… not now. I’m sorry.”
“Don’t worry, I’m not going to ravish you here and now. But… maybe we could… you know, try some stuff out?”
"I was when she checked on me. But before that, I died."
"Each individual tree. This one," Potter patted the tree, "is old. I think it prefers autumn to summer."
"Draco." Harry’s whisper roused him in the dark.
"You can do that?"
Harry focused on marching out of the building as fast as he could. He made for one of the quieter side exits, hoping not to bump into anyone he knew. Shoving the door open harder than he would do normally helped his mood a little. It was cold outside, but he sucked the cool air into his lungs as if he'd been deprived of oxygen. The ache of it also helped, as did kicking a wall. Harry went to his favourite place to mope: his room at the training centre was no good, only giving the semblance of privacy.
“It was mine,” Harry said. “And yes, I do know what it means. I think, anyway.”
“We are friends. Or… I thought we were.”
"And it’s OK you getting the time off work?"
,” Malfoy supplied. “It’s essential reading for all wizards.”
“Peppermint tea?” Harry asked. “With a spoonful of honey?”
"Is this where the house-elf heads were?" Malfoy asked, peering up towards the silhouettes of the boards they'd been mounted on. Harry was happy to skip the small talk.
She snorted, but smiled and patted his hand before opening her bag and pulling out her notes on Protean Charms. “Maybe you’re finally ready to study without needing me to—”
Although Ernie and the rest were laughing and chatting, not everyone joined in with the excitement. The four Slytherins stood back, eyes down. They all looked lost, and weren’t speaking to each other - let alone anyone else. Harry wondered why they had come, whether their parents had forced them to, or whether they had been the ones to insist.
Behind Harry a bank of grass dropped down to another pond. Light glinted off the murky water, the pond fringed on the far side with a dense line of trees. And men sitting, sunbathing and swimming all around them.
Draco followed Mike and Potter through a warren of corridors until they reached an equipment storage room.
"That's enough, Potter," Malfoy said, quietly. "I'd appreciate it if you let me do my job, without interruption."
Deeply satisfied at the knowledge that Harry was already coming undone, Draco gave him an approving pat on the leg. "You’re almost ready," Draco said.
“She nearly didn’t,” Hermione said quietly. “She lost so much blood… if St Mungo’s hadn’t sent over that extra Blood-Replenishing Potion…” She blinked back tears.
Draco squirmed when Harry climbed back into bed.
Potter didn’t reply, but turned instead to look into the forest. "I don’t know what she’ll do about you being here, or how long it will take."
Malfoy felt his
“So how was your first day at work?” Henry asked when Draco got in.
“Do you see your mum much now?”
The memory was thin and wispy as it poured out, and yet it seemed to take longer than the others. Harry knew that was probably not true, but he was pissed off with Draco.
“Thank you, Minty, that will be all. Do you think that you could wait outside the dining room while we have a look inside? We won’t disturb anything, and it would be most helpful to us.”
In the end, no one saw them walk in together. They were swallowed up in the stream of other students also rushing in eager not to miss the start of dinner, and then Professor Slughorn stopped Malfoy before they could reach their table to ask him a question. Harry’s heart, which had been burbling up high in his chest, dropped like a stone. Hermione barely looked up as he sat down beside her, and when he looked back at Malfoy, still stuck with Professor Slughorn, the way Malfoy’s shoulders looked, tightly set, seemed to Harry to suggest a kind of disappointment, too.
Draco’s room still held the illusion of safety, even though he knew that walls, doors, and locks were no impediment to the Dark Lord or his hideous, slithering companion. Tucked in his bed and willing for sleep to take him away from this house, just for a little, Draco picked up the book he had bought earlier that week,
On this morning, though, Draco felt more than the clearness of his head in the bright space around him. There was also a lazy warmth, borne of his dreams, still licking pleasurably through him. He closed his eyes, and let himself fall back into the images that had filled his night.
“We’re not getting anywhere.”
Draco did not look convinced.
“Hi, Ron,” Harry squeaked out. He wobbled, but managed to right himself with his one free arm.
, you know. In the end.”
“If those are the kind of resources needed to investigate this, I don’t understand why it isn’t someone from the Ministry in charge.”
Wilson gave a weary salute from her side of the table.
After his break away, everything felt different. When he, Ron, and Hermione arrived in Hogsmeade, a little travel-weary, small green leaves were unfurling from the trees, and the afternoon stretched into a light-filled evening. It felt as though the world had changed.
“Thanks, Harry. And if you don’t mind me saying, you should have the same. Take the chance you have here, to have a break from the big bad world out there. And use it to be young again, to have fun, if that’s what you want to do. But if it means being quiet, having time to be sad or to work out who you are… that’s OK, too.”
Harry dropped to his knees, and now that Draco could see his face, it didn’t matter. The fact that Harry’s mouth was wrapped around Draco’s dick helped, too, of course. Warmth, and firm hands on his buttocks, was all that Draco could focus on. Draco groaned as Harry’s finger grazed his hole; at the sound Harry began to tease and stroke and probe. His touch was sure, and Draco saw again the way Henry shaped a pot on the wheel. The double sensations of being sucked off and fingered at the same time set off a rolling orgasm, Draco coming in Harry’s mouth, and groaning as he felt Harry swallow down around him.
He put the Snitch away, then moved towards the door, but Potter remained on the sofa. Potter was massaging his knee, and looked unhappy. “I, er, I need a hand up. My leg’s locked. It doesn’t happen often.”
Zabini rested his head in his hand. “Draco,” he said.
"What did you say, at the beginning?"
“Yes,” said Ron. “But not doing whatever else it is you two get up to.”
The sheer physical labour of cleaning the Room helped Harry forget all about Charms and homework. His arms ached and his hair was entirely wet with sweat, but seeing the soot clear away made it all worthwhile. A hot shower would be most welcome, though. With some wistfulness, Harry remembered when the Room could provide whatever was needed.
Harry rubbed at his chin. He probably needed to shave. Not going into work each day had broken his routine in the morning. After another yawn he reflected that he probably needed to brush his teeth as well. Looking up, he saw that Malfoy had stopped talking and was staring at him. “Go on, go on,” he said.
“Too… empty, maybe.”
Malfoy petted Bertie, who gave his odd little squawking hoot and raised his ear tufts at Harry.
“This book is interesting,” Harry said, sitting back down as he didn’t know what else to do. “I think the Room’s trying to encourage us.” Harry didn’t know if the book was interesting, he’d not been able to read a word of it.
"I did learn something," said Malfoy. "As soon as I stepped out of the house, it tried to kill you. And when Pansy stepped through the Floo, I felt a slight... something." He frowned. "I hate being so vague, but I was a little panicked at the time too. You looked—" He took a deep breath, but his eyes didn't leave Harry's face. "You didn't look great. I should have considered that something like this might happen."
“I’m not sure—” The minstrel glanced over at Draco. “I really was only hoping for a few coins.”
The door opened slowly this time, and Dudley stepped into the room.
“I was scared for myself and my mother every day. I… I was very unhappy,” Draco said. “I saw things I’ll never be able to unsee. But I do know that still doesn’t make what I did OK.”
“And by
This was one of those moments when Harry wondered what he was doing, having Malfoy in his home. It was an impossible situation. Malfoy seemed to think so, too. He gave Harry a stiff half-bow, then walked away.
"Yes, like she's the typical Ravenclaw."
"Yes."
Harry pulled out of the memory, confusion and anger beginning to build. Why was Draco showing him this? He knew that Draco had found it hard after the war. He knew that Draco’s extra year had been lonely, and unhappy. But a lot of people had a tough time after the war. And Harry had needed that laughter, had needed a bit of time before facing the world. He wouldn’t wish it away merely because Draco had been miserable at the time. Harry thought back to his words of the day before. “I didn’t see,” he’d said to Draco, and he hadn’t. He didn’t know what purpose it served to make him see now. Unless it was just to make him squirm.
A familiar voice, spiked and sure, brought him out of his quiet reverie. Harry smiled, because of course Draco was here. It was as though he’d conjured Draco from desire alone. Although if he was honest with himself, he had come here hoping to see Draco.
Harry reached out a hand and covered hers. “I know. It is hard, but we need to find a way to live together.”
Harry grinned. “It seemed fitting.”
“Can I help?”
“There’s time enough for that,” he said. “But what I want right now. What I
Cold, flat January light filled the Room. Somehow now there was nothing left to clean, and the windows were all sealed, it felt cold and empty.
"I simply want to save time."
“No, it’s somewhere there’d only be the three of us.”
Harry silently cursed the old range: the kettle took forever to boil on it, and he would have been grateful for the distraction of making tea. He fetched a pot down, and two mugs while he waited. “I trust them, you know. Greg’s done loads to the house already and it’s all been fine.”
, they were saying. A prickle of panic disturbed Draco’s carefully maintained calm. Was he going to have one of his bloody Potter visions, here of all places? His feet moved more quickly until he looked up and saw the familiar painted quills that marked the bookshop. Relief made him giddy: he had avoided a vision, and would be finished with this terrible shopping trip soon.
“Wow, that sounds great!”
“We can’t all go through life looking like we’ve just stepped out of Madam Primpernelle’s.”
First, he found Marseille, then Paris, looking at the distance between the two. But the land around Marseille didn’t look right, and he wondered where exactly it was Harry lived. There were several large forests or national parks marked on the map, and he wondered which was the one he had spent all those weeks in. Staring hard at the topographical lines only made his eyes hurt, and he sat back and sighed. If only Luna was here now, with an answer readily up her sleeve. Or Millicent, with her brisk efficiency. But all he had was himself.
Harry persisted. “I don’t think you’ve got much to apologise for.”
"I think it might be," said Draco, and he pulled Harry in for a kiss.
"I don't think that is anything I ever thought I would see," he said.
As they walked away, Potter whispered, “Was he just saying what I think he was saying?”
“It’s not that,” Malfoy said. He sniffed. “I’m surprised they’ll allow it, it’s the American spelling.”
"I– I wish I had listened," he said quietly. Severus's expression changed, softening as he looked at Harry.
“What are you two losers talking about then?” Anthony asked. “Only joking!” he said, when he saw the look on Harry’s face, and ruffling Harry’s hair as though to prove it.
him.”
When Harry shut the door – quietly, so as not to disturb Walburga Black’s portrait – the hallway felt more empty than ever before.
A door clanged open, but they ignored it.
Draco was quiet. “I like Dudley,” he said in the end, turning to face Harry. “He reminds me a bit of… well, me, actually. He told me once, how he and his friends used to treat other people.” He looked at Harry. “He meant you, didn’t he?”
“It’s more than that, though. I know – or rather, I think – that things are a little more relaxed between us.”
George dealt with a customer while Harry browsed the shelves. When he rang up the sale, he called Harry over. “Ron’s not here, you know. Probably trying to placate Mum after another row with Hermione.”
A strip of wallpaper had become unstuck behind the front door. Each time Harry opened the door, it would flutter down. For some reason – probably the damp – Sticking Charms didn’t work, but at least it wasn’t mouldy. The same couldn’t be said about the front of the dining room, or the back of the wardrobe in Harry’s bedroom.
Greg nodded. “I need the money.”
“It’s just…” Harry wanted to cry.
Harry cast the charm, feeling with some relief his buttocks lose their chill. The pallor of Malfoy’s skin began to look a little less deathly.
Neither spoke. Harry got into bed, acutely aware of Malfoy next to him. Harry had the impression that Malfoy was holding himself stiffly, that he was very close to holding his breath. With a sigh, Harry tried to get comfortable.
A small owl swooped past his head and landed unsteadily on the desk beside the door. It turned its head and fixed Harry with a dignified look.
“Ganma! Ganma!” Teddy exploded back into the room, his hair now the same silver-gold colour as Malfoy. In his hands though, was a miniature Harry Potter in Hogwarts robes. Harry was pleased to see he hadn’t been totally usurped in Teddy’s affections.
“I know,” said Draco. “You were too busy being the hero and dreaming of your ginger girlfriend—”
Draco had been expecting a chaotic space, but the workshop was neatly ordered and arranged. Large bins and shelves lined the walls, with a set of worktables and a turning table at the centre of the room. One wall held unfired bowls and pots, while the one to the right of the door held finished works. Clay, pale and dry, was splattered all over the room. No wonder he came home filthy after a day in here. As Henry talked through each section of the room, Draco began to see the flow: clay in one end, pots ready to be fired out the other. It reminded him a little of a well-run Potions lab. Draco wondered where Henry had gone to school: he didn’t recognise him from Hogwarts. There were other schools and some were educated at home, of course. Apart from the fact that Henry’s parents were dead and that he had a friend who disapproved of his life, Draco didn’t know much about Henry. But then he hadn’t exactly been forthcoming about his own past.
“You and the rest of your House.”
“Er, hi, Luna,” Potter said. “I didn’t know that you were coming here today.”
“Did you see that?” Malfoy said, his voice rising in excitement.
Pansy regarded him as she pulled her top lip tight with her teeth. “Yes… maybe. Draco, how many times have you seen Potter this week?”
Potter was treading water in the deep part of the pool. "Come in while you’re still hot, it’s the best way to do it. Splash your hands and your face, then ease your way in. It’s the most wonderful thing ever."
"Oh, just get on with your Pink spell," said Harry, who had been hoping for at least a smile.
“There won’t be a next time.” Henry shook head.
Harry unwound his scarf. He had forgotten how cold Scotland in winter could be, and snow lay thick on the ground outside. Beside him, Draco was still stiffly buttoned up in his long black coat, looking like a Muggle version of Snape.
"Already?" said Hermione. "I've enjoyed having someone to wash up with." Harry smiled.
Together they sat in silence, watching the slow passage of clouds in the sky, the odd silhouette of a bird high above. The world seemed a collection of lines, black and white, and they the only dots of colour in it.
Draco’s collar felt tight, but he kept his voice even as he answered. “I’m fine. And thankfully not shady. I would appreciate it though if you could tell us if you saw what happened to the violin.”
A fallen tree provided a lumpy and hard seat, but he didn’t care how uncomfortable it was. Sweat stung his eyes, and the cut on his arm smarted. A wave of images washed over him, bringing back unwelcome memories of sitting in front of that cabinet, the pressure to do the impossible. And then he saw Ollivander’s face, the way he had looked with pity at Draco as he told him he had failed at his apprenticeship.
"I have a few ideas, but I don't think that you will like what I have to say." Severus sat back in his high-backed armchair. Privately, Harry liked to refer to it as his throne: it had that kind of an air about it. "Firstly, you will have to overcome your... objection to Parseltongue, and together with Harry try talking to the house." Harry suddenly realised that of course, Parseltongue was what Malfoy had meant by 'talking to the house'. "Secondly, I would recommend that Harry is not in the house without Draco also being present."
"I can give you a hand if you want."
“Was that so hard, Harry?”
“Draco, you look terrible.”
think it’s perfectly comfortable.” He looked at his assembled housemates. “Are you okay with Malfoy staying here? Kingsley put me in a bit of a bind, yesterday.”
Potter though, was not tending to the fire nor sitting by it. He was instead standing by a tree on the other side of the clearing. Something about the way he stood there halted Draco both in thought and movement; Draco stopped and tried to work out what it was about the way Potter stood there.
“He’s changed,” Harry said.
Draco in some way.
But now he was here, Harry didn’t know what it would be like to actually see Draco again. Their messages had been terse, the marble and badge not being able to contain more than a few words at a time. But the few words they had exchanged had been enough to set a fire in Harry, a desire always for
“Turning your hair green meant you could fancy me?”
As Hestia stood up, everyone stopped and turned to face her. “We’ll reconvene at the training centre in ten minutes, and go over all the positives and negatives of this exercise.”
“They were irritating me.” Malfoy looked down at his hand, as though only now realising what he’d done. “I took your wand,” he said, sounding surprised. “I used magic.”
“It’s complicated. And… it’s more than about just cards, or Muggles, or trust.” Harry uncurled his hand, showing Draco what he’d carried down from his bedroom.
They walked through trees, across a meadow of long grass, and up a hill. The air was filled with chirruping insects and the odd bird call, as well as the inescapable heat. Draco tried to keep up with Harry without showing that his breathing was becoming more laboured, or that his head was beginning to ache in the fierce sun. If he had known that they were going to walk cross country like this, he would have brought a bloody hat.
Draco shuddered at the word ‘suitors’. When he’d been at Hogwarts, with Greg and Vince tripping over their feet to keep up with him and Pansy accidentally letting her hands graze a little too low in their dance classes, he’d never imagined he’d be reduced to the indignity of being paraded around like a prime cut of Malfoy meat.
“Er… What should I do now?”
“You and Ginny Weasley,” Zabini said. “I wasn’t sure, so thought it best to ask: is it over? Between you two, I mean. The papers have had so much in them, it’s hard to know what’s true.”
“Not that. I thought you would be busy. But all I’ve seen you do the past few weeks is mope around the house.”
"Oh, it's not that I don't want you to be happy, mate, you know that. It's just... Malfoy?" Harry shrugged. It didn't make sense, but Malfoy was just... exactly who he wanted. He was pretty sure that Ron wouldn't like the details, so he didn't say anything. Ron sighed. "We should probably get back to this," he said, unrolling a large map of the Lake District. "I've got a theory..."
