Potter had grabbed the front of his shirt, and Draco was prepared to be punched or thrown or anything, really.
Your mother and I have heard some concerning rumors from the Greengrass family originating from your friend’s sister, Astoria. Her mother claims that Astoria told her you and Daphne have kissed. I shouldn’t have to tell you how problematic this is, my dear. You will grow up to marry a nice pureblood. I do not believe I have to remind you that pureblood will be male. It is best if you stop entertaining these feelings you think you have, and pursue boys your age; I know you and Draco are friends, perhaps him? You could do far worse than a Malfoy, my dear. You won’t be punished for this, but I can’t say the same for future instances if there are any.
“I don’t know,” Harry replied honestly. “I just want you all to get along better. He is my boyfriend.” Harry dropped his voice low, making sure nobody was near enough to overhear.
Potter didn’t immediately reply, and Draco rubbed his neck in a rare show of self-consciousness. “See you, then.”
“So basically, every time I look at him I feel kind of sick but in a good way and I really want to kiss him.”
“Where'd he go?” They both looked around frantically. That was Hermione. As Draco began to look around for a clearer path, Harry was pulling his invisibility cloak out of his pocket. He pulled Draco close to him and threw it over them both, pulling Draco down so they were crouching.
It had been silent for too long, and he reached out for words. “So, if you’re not too busy with studies and Pansy, what else are you going to be doing? Hanging out with the handsome Slytherin you ate breakfast with?”
He pushed himself up and sat back, patting his bed for her to sit next to him. Everyone else was still sleeping. Nott was snoring softly. Crabbe and Goyle were snoring not so softly. “I thought I’d be the last person you’d talk to. I… I was going to find you today and apologize. I’m sorry I-”
The Slytherins got into a line, and Draco wasn’t stubborn enough to ignore the nervous excitement they all felt. Even if Lupin looked like he had been living on the streets all his life, he was a few steps up from the moron they had last year.
It wasn’t so much that Draco liked boys. It was that the boy he liked was Harry freaking Potter. The only way he could do worse was by falling for a Weasley.
“She hasn’t missed any of ours, right?” Harry asked. It was hard to tell now that they weren’t talking, but he was certain she was always there.
Draco looked impressed. “And it still works this good? Even the really pricey ones quit working after a few years.” Harry shrugged. Draco swallowed. “Right, well. Are you?”
Potter took off his robes and rolled his sleeves up to his elbows. Draco tore his eyes away from the light brown skin and tried not to imagine being held by him. He did the same and brushed his hair back with his hand, not excited for the upcoming task.
They all shook their heads. “I woke up because Ron was screaming, but I didn’t see anything.” Neville said.
The intensity of the crowd had reached a peak. The raw emotion emanated, and different cheers and chants melded into a mass of white noise. Harry flew quicker around the pitch, his eyes scanning until they landed on a gold flutter close to the ground. He dove for real and Draco followed, keeping up better than he expected. They were neck and neck after the snitch, their fingers both outstretched. Harry tipped forward, his hand brushed past Draco’s, and he nearly lost balance as he caught the Snitch.
Draco glared and stepped toward Harry, who took a step back so his back was pressed against a tree. “Listen, I might not be some selfless hero like you, but I’m certainly not evil and maybe I don't want to see you fucking dead!”
“And Flint scores.” The Slytherins made a decent amount of noise, and Draco whooped and hollered as the scoreboard showed 30-10 Gryffindor.
Harry came back to Gryffindor tower feeling euphoric. The feeling lasted a few more days before Ron woke up shrieking that Sirius Black had tried to kill him.
He was puffed up, angry and passionate. And so close. Harry reached out and grabbed his face. Immediately Draco was sated. “What-”
“And leave you alone? Have your death on my conscious? You think I would want everyone after me because I left their handsome hero Harry Potter to be brutally murdered by a psychopa-”
“Leave him alone,” Ron replied. Hermione gave him a withering look but he ignored her, and Harry was grateful for it. He didn't know if he would tell them, or if he could, but he would do it on his own terms only.
“Very close. It’s hard to be fearless. It’s much easier to be amused. The spell we use is Riddikulus, and you must think of something funny. I’m sure you’ve heard about what happened in one of the other Defense Against the Dark Arts classes?” How could they have not. Longbottom was a disgrace in every sense of the word, and it was unbelievable that he had dressed up a Snape look-a-like in his grandmother’s clothes.
Draco yawned, then said, “Right. Sorry. Habit, I guess. You can handle the beetles this time, I’ll do the matchsticks.”
“I already helped. I did half the work. It’s not my fault you’ve never lifted a finger in your whole life.”
“What?” Then it clicked, and Draco realized that Pansy knew exactly what he was. Which was fine. She was queer, she would know more than anyone how sensitive his situation was. But the words were stuck in his throat, and he could only say, “You’re wrong.”
Draco shoved his face into his pillow. This was awful. He had to get Potter’s stupid face out of his head. His thoughts wandered to Quidditch, which was generally a horrible experience thanks to the crippling feelings of self-doubt that came from losing a game he had been playing since he could ride a broom to a brat who picked it up for the first time but two years prior. But Harry was an athlete by nature; he was lithe and quick and likely somewhat strong, strong enough to make Draco wonder about certain things he would rather not think about.
The snitch gone again, Harry began searching again. Bole hit Alicia with the club and George nearly brought them both down as he fought back, and another dual penalty was rewarded. Everyone but the Slytherins screamed with joy as Gryffindor scored and Oliver saved, bringing it to 40-10.
“Could always fly him away from here,” Ron said. “Maybe Charlie would pick him up, too. Might like him.”
At the end of the day, they walked to the Great Hall together, where Drao pulled them aside. “What’s the matter?” Harry asked, doing his best to cover that he was talking kindly to Draco in public.
“No. I just told my parents I wanted to stay caught up in my classes. Besides, Pansy is stuck here.”
And there's the second chapter for the day. I hope you guys enjoyed, and I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate all the love this has gotten. Whenever I get kudos I get all warm and fuzzy and gay. Stay safe, stay healthy, and I hope to see you all again soon. Until next time~
“Not many Muggles are… Like that. And the ones who are don’t say it, really, because people can be really cruel to them.” Hermione looked almost ashamed to say it.
In the weeks that passed, Draco became noticeably less tense about Hermione and Ron’s knowledge of their… Arrangement? Predicament? It hurt Harry’s head to think about it. His stomach would twist and turn and he’d feel very light and heavy all at once. It was easier to focus on little things. He was starting to get grateful whenever found the time in her packed schedule to sit down and force him and Ron to do their homework. And Oliver’s dedicated practice schedule kept him too tired to stay up late thinking about Draco.
“Yeah. Right.” They worked in silence. Draco was loathe to admit it, but the newly transfigured beetles well contained in the box, thought they crawled around and over each other. Potter had the needles spread out on the table as he transfigured them back into matchsticks. Draco kept his eyes glued to the buttons. He was unbearably close to Potter. He could see the small flecks of different shades of green in his eyes, could see how his messy hair fell over his old, breaking glasses, how he pursed his lips as he focused-
Then, they heard the door open. Then, they heard an axe swinging, and something slice open. Hermione covered her mouth, and Ron looked up in horror. Slowly, one hand still gripped tightly around a struggling Scabbers, he reached out to hold Hermione. And Harry leaned against Ron’s shoulder.
Draco didn’t keep him waiting long. In his hands were two bottles of butterbeer and a large cloak. At Harry’s questioning look, he admitted, “I bought it. I got cold.” He tossed a bottle to Harry, who caught it appreciatively. Draco vanished some snow from the ground, leaving a slightly damp patch of grass. Harry sat and looked to Draco, still standing over him, who blurted, “Wecouldshareifyouwant.”
“You’re all too busy,” he said. “You can’t be comin’ out here at night, and Hermione’s got too many classes.”
“Buckbeak deserves a last defense,” Hermione insisted. Harry looked out the window to see the Hippogriff sleeping, tied up to a post. Completely unaware.
Filch walked Potter and him down to Hagrid’s hut, grumbling the whole way to remind them how worthless he found them. The giant oaf- though, if he was going to be good on his promise to Potter, he might as well extend polite thoughts toward his favorite professor- opened the door and grinned.
“We can’t talk about this now. But… Later. We’ll come to the Slytherin common room,” Harry said, flying, as he usually did, by the seat of his pants.
As far as Quidditch went, the nicer weather meant practice was more tolerable, a necessary thing now that Wood was obsessing more than usual. They had a chance. They had a chance, a Firebolt, and they could beat Slytherin.
A ladder had been set up so they could reach the awards higher up on the shelves and walls. “I’ll handle those ones if you do the bottom,” Potter said, running his hand through his hair. Merlin, Draco wanted to run his fingers through it.
“I’m going to be keeping this,” Lupin said, holding up the map. Harry didn’t protest, though he desperately wanted to. “And remember. We’ll start your private lessons in January. Have a pleasant rest of your break.”
Black had done this to him. Quite literally, his very presence had brought the dementors to Hogwarts (Fudge had pushed hard to let them back into the school after Black was found in Gryffindor, but Dumbledore was resolute in his decision).But it was Sirius’s betrayal of Harry’s parents, of his best friends, that left him here, only able to hear his mother’s words when his soul was being sucked out.
Harry was at a loss, and he could imagine Crabbe and Goyle were quite literally lost without Draco to lead them around. The first day it happened, Ron sat wordless beside Harry, who was a normal distance from Draco as they enjoyed the warm weather next to the lake (he decided this was where if they both set their hands they were mere centimeters from touching while still looking casual enough to dissuade suspicion).
“Quidditch practice!” Potter spluttered, and soon words were spilling out of his mouth. “Professor McGonagall, please, we’ve been practicing everyday, and Oliver will kill me if-”
It was quick. Harry didn't want to say it was too quick for his liking, though that was the case. His mouth was soft and tasted minty.
Lupin turned to look at Potter, who was looking down at the ground with a slight blush on his face. “Hey,” he muttered.
“Fine. They don’t count and this is a date.” Draco visibly lightened. “So… are we dating?” Draco didn’t respond at first. “Have we been? I didn’t really know if we were going to call… this anything.”
The fight Ron and Hermione had wasn’t massive in volume or length, but in the effect it was monumental. They hadn’t spoken in two weeks. Harry was in a bit of a crossroads, given he very much agreed that Crookshanks had it out for Scabbers. However, he didn’t have the heart to tell Ron that Scabbers had likely lived well past his natural lifespan. The best he could do is not give as cold a shoulder to Hermione, who was content to focus on the hours worth of homework she had.
“You know what?” Harry said loudly, seeing them both reach for their wands. “I’m gonna go somewhere alone with my boyfriend!”
Before Hagrid could respond a vase near the window shattered. Pansy jumped, and many things happened in succession. Ron shouted, “Scabbers!” and the mangy rat ran across the floor. Ron dove, Fang barked, Hermione shouted, “I knew Crookshanks would never!”
The rest of the Slytherins murmured a greeting in response. Lupin grinned at them, not unkindly, and showed them the dresser he was standing in front of. “For our first lesson, I thought we could do something hands-on.” The dresser jumped and shook, and Draco sat straight-up in his seat. “Can anyone tell me what we have here?”
“No, actually. See, in wizarding households, we don’t stoop to do Muggle work. We consider it quite beneath us.”
“I go to the classroom, and then I’m done,” Hermione replied. Harry got the hint and didn’t push it.
“My dad’s not abusive,” Draco said, pushing himself away from them. “I’m not having a flashback or something. It was stupid, just like the siren or whatever the hell you saw.”
Right now, they were sitting in a dim spot and just talking, their hands brushing together whenever they moved. “Hogsmeade trip tomorrow,” Draco said.
For a few seconds Pansy didn’t reply, and Draco worried he had been too quiet. Then she asked, “Does it matter?”
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. It was nice to feel Harry’s hand around his, and he wanted more. “I’m perfectly fine on my own, thank you.”
The crowd went wild. Lee Jordan was sobbing, and Oliver pulled Harry into the tightest hug of his life. He was dragged away before he could say anything to Draco, who did his best to give a good natured nod.
Harry walked back to his room feeling much less proud. He was tired. Sore. His head was throbbing in pain. And his mother’s voice was ringing in his ears, though he wasn’t sure he was as upset about that one.
Nott was first, and a large, black cat sauntered out of the dresser, it’s eyes large and yellow and pinned on him. It was a panther, Draco realized, and it silently moved closer to Nott, its impossibly large mouth opening to reveal many sharp, white teeth. Nott forced out a shaky, “Riddikulus!” and the panther transformed into a small, fluffy kitten. He let out a sigh of relief and the class laughed as Daphne, who was behind him, pushed him out of the way.
In the dark and quiet the dungeon always provided, it was easier for intrusive thoughts to worm their way into his head. Was Potter stupid? Yes. That much was objective. Was the hero worship of him ridiculous and annoying. Yes. It was, once again, objective. Was he ugly. Yes. No. Yes. His eyes were beautiful, and his thin face had an almost innocent type of beauty to it.
“It’ll be quick.” Draco closed his books and followed Pansy out of the common room and into an empty hallway. Few people were wandering the halls as classes were still in session. “I told you my secret, now you tell me yours.”
Harry couldn’t look at Draco. It felt too raw, too much like something he shouldn’t be allowed to see. Being vulnerable was dangerous, it was more for the Dursley’s to tear to shreds. Harry got the idea something similar happened to Draco growing up. Yet here he was, baring his soul in a sloppy, real way.
The mood of the Gryffindor team soured that of the whole house, and Hermione was doing her best to not pay attention to it. Though, as Harry saw the piles of books surrounding her as she did homework, she likely didn’t have the capacity to care about it.
Not wanting whatever uneasy friendship they had to go away, Harry tried to concede. “I told Ron and Hermione.”
Draco put his hands to his temples. “That's a Grim, you idiot. It's serious stuff. Aren't you at least a little concerned since Sirius Black is trying to kill you?”
The next time Ron joined, he brought his chess set and challenged Harry, who obliged to lose. “Merlin, Harry, have you ever played chess before?” Draco asked as Ron took his queen in record time.
“Just like your dad, Draco. Too much of a coward to do your own dirty work, so you’re hoping Black does it for you.” It stung, but it was probably fair. He went after Potter’s parents every other week. “At least you’re decent enough to rely on a criminal. You’re dad wasn’t capable enough for something a little girl could do.”
“Enough,” McGonagall said, and they fell silent. “If you two fight during any of these detentions, you’ll be given another one. I suggest you two learn how to get along.”
He wasn’t. The boggart hovered over him and though, admittedly, it was nowhere near as exhaustive as an actual dementor, he was still immediately drained.
Potter’s face was red and he was pressing his lips together firm, almost as if he was forcing whatever he was thinking to stay inside. Draco was too fixated on his lips to raise any protest. Finally, Snape said, “Let’s go, Draco.”
“Look, you’ve been injured enough times for me to be worried. Merlin knows how your friends manage to stick around you.”
“Fine,” Draco said in the least respectful tone he could. He nodded at Crabbe and Goyle and they turned back to their table.
Harry was sitting in Professor Lupin’s office. “The only way to get rid of a dementor is a Patronus charm,” Lupin explained. “It won’t kill them. I’m not sure if a dementor can be killed. But it pushes them away, makes them have less effect over you.”
Tentatively, Draco reached for Harry's face. His wide eyes flickered from Harry's eyes to his mouth. Gently, he pressed his lips to Harry's.
“Expecto patronum!” he yelled, thinking of everything in tandem, now. Quidditch, and how he was allowed to have fun. Ron and Hermione, his first friends. Draco.
He lifted his head. Ron, tall and awkward as ever, was standing at the door frame, clearly worried about him. “What?”
“What’s the matter?” He was sitting with Draco, in one of their private corners. He wasn’t there, and he knew Draco would notice it. In his head, all he could think about was Sirius Black, and how he betrayed his best friends. It was tearing him apart; he was angry all the time.
Hello everybody! Sorry this took a hot second, but here's another chapter. Please tell me what you think, and I hope I'll be back soon.
“I hope he gets in,” Goyle said. “Maybe he’ll finish the job on Potter.” Draco looked up at him and Crabbe. Death was less of a foreign concept when you were surrounded by ghosts, but he could hardly imagine someone their age being killed. He wasn’t sure he would want any of the kids are Hogwarts dead, even if it was Potter and his crew. He believed Crabbe and Goyle felt the same, though it was impossible to ignore the odd gleam in Crabbe’s eye.
“I know. He should. But you haven’t been a saint in the past, and they both have a bit of pent up anger,” Harry said, grabbing one of Draco’s hands. “It’s not your fault, and they don’t know that you and your dad are separate people, yet.”
Going into the Ravenclaw match, he felt better than he ever had. Oliver was repeating the amount of points they had to win by and the current team standings. Harry was fine. He had the points memorized weeks ago, and with the Firebolt he knew it’d be a cince.
Ron glanced at Harry and launched into his tale. “I woke up, and Sirius Black was standing over me. He had a knife, and had torn up the curtains. He mistook me for Harry, because it was dark and we were all sleeping. When he saw me, he tried to kill me so there wouldn’t be any witnesses. So I stood up and fought him off-”
“I’m capable, Potter,” Draco sneered, and Potter rolled his eyes with a slight grin on his face. They set to work, and it was just as boring as Draco feared it would be. Soon enough, his arms and back were burning with exertion, and he kept glancing up at Potter to see if he was feeling the same. Filch was muttering about how they deserved more traditional punishment; at least, that’s what Draco assumed. He had Filch blocked out since second year.
“I know you aren’t fond of Harry. And I understand the Slytherin-Gryffindor rivalry; that was certainly just as prominent when I was a student. I think you two have more in common than you think, though. I remember petty feuds from my past, and I wonder if nipping them in the bud like this would’ve been more beneficial.”
Potter grabbed Draco’s hand and shoved it into the bucket despite Draco’s protests. He pressed Draco’s hand into a fist around one of the pieces of meat, and he gagged as he felt it squish in between his fingers. Potter let go and Draco shrieked, pulled his hand out of the bucket, and threw the meat away.
Harry ran. He was out the door and back in the Gryffindor common room before he knew where his feet were taking him. It was too early. Ron and Hermione would wait for him in the common room, but they weren’t alone.
The weather was perfect. The wind wasn’t too strong and the sun not too bright, allowing for fantastic visibility and flying conditions. Draco continued to follow Harry, and Harry found his attention split between the pitch and his boyfriend. Draco was significantly smaller than the last seeker, but the uniform had been shrunk to fit him handsomely. Green had always complimented him well, and the few blonde hairs that were out of place added a handsome, almost playful feeling.
“Well, I’m not a light sleeper, but I’m sure it’s a small house compared to whatever manor you live in.”
“Professor!” Granger interjected. McGonagall turned to face her, fury in her eyes, and Granger, taken aback, said, “Ron was trying to pull Crabbe and Goyle off of Harry. He wasn’t trying to hurt anyone.”
“We’re sorry,” Harry said. “It was perfectly safe, though.” Hermione stared Harry down, then turned to Ron.
“Maybe you were right to turn it in,” Ron admitted. “But I still think it’s a reach to murder someone with an expensive Christmas gift.”
More footsteps, and Hermione skid to a stop behind Ron. “You shouldn’t have run off like that! What if your cloak fell off or if you got caught in Honeydukes or coming back in or-”
If he could ignore it, maybe it would go away. All he had to do was block him out for Care of Magical Creatures and Double Potions. That would likely be difficult, though; Hagrid (Professor Hagrid, Draco corrected sarcastically) worshipped Potter nearly as much as Dumbledore did, and Potter was too much of a dolt to get through a Potions class without drawing attention to himself.
“And I’m with him whenever he’s not with you,” Draco said. “And I’ll be on the pitch next Quidditch match.”
McGonagall pressed her lips together in a tight line. “Very well. If you three were trying to break up the fight, I won’t punish you. But you two,” she said, turning to face Draco and Potter, “will follow me to my office where we will discuss your punishment.”
“Wait, are you gay?” Draco's face was bright red, though he wasn't sure if it was embarrassment, rage, or both. His shoulders were taught and his hands balled up in fists, his hair was mussed. He was handsome.
The Gryffindor crowd was going crazy. Ravenclaw came back by 30 points. Harry was circling the pitch in tandem with Cho.
“Would you be jealous if I did spend all of break with Blaise?” Though the tone was still teasing, Draco suddenly looked vulnerable.
The kitten fixed its round eyes on Daphne and shifted into a large hulking beast, covered in thick, gray tufts of fur and patches of bared skin barely concealed by torn shreds of clothes. It was a werewolf, and Draco and a few others were taken back, including Professor Lupin, by the looks of it. Daphne squeaked, “Riddikulus!” and it transformed into a puppy laying on a denim jacket.
I'm back my friends! I'm starting to think I'll have this finished before college at the rate I'm writing! Hopefully. Fingers crossed y'all. I hope you guys enjoyed, and hopefully the timeline isn't so egregious compared to the canon one. Until next time~
The door opened again, and they both turned again to look at their professors. “Detention every night this week. One hour of tidying up classrooms. And ten points will be deducted from Gryffindor and Slytherin,” McGonagall said.
“Good luck backtracking your way out of this one,” Ron said. “Suddenly you love Hagrid? Right. Malfoy already acted like the thing bloody killed him.” Pansy glared at him.
Draco bit his lip. Daphne had always seemed genuinely nice; while he could imagine other girls Pansy talked to immediately revealing her secrets, he felt Daphne was better than that. “I don’t think she did this intentionally. She probably got a letter from her parents, too. It’d be a good bonding moment.” Pansy shrugged, turning away from Draco and instead looking in the general direction of Crabbe. “Did you?”
“I don't want to bug him, actually, but the Grim is real! You can go from thinking magic is fake to accepting it in a heartbeat but the weird stuff that comes with it is too much?”
Still, Draco could see that Harry was stressed about the match, and placed his hand on his back. It felt like Harry had opened something between them when he talked about the Dursley’s. Never had it put it so plainly before. He got the feeling Ron knew exactly what they were, and had the sneaking suspicion Ron had asked his family to put together something for Harry for Christmas and his birthday knowing that they would give him nothing. He didn’t feel as confident with Hermione, but knew she understood he wasn’t fond of his relatives. But he had never said it. Never said Hogwarts was the first time he wasn’t hungry, or that he grew up under stairs, or he never had clothes or glasses that worked properly until Hagrid fetched him.
They parted ways without a word. Draco had assumed the truce would be for the duration of the detentions. Still, a small part of him was disappointed. Whatever. It wasn’t as if they’d come out of these detentions as friends.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw a gold glitter. His stomach tightened. He could likely depend on Draco being so reliant on Harry to react that he wouldn’t even look for the snitch, but if he did see it Gryffindor would suffer an embarrassing defeat.
It was Draco's fault, and that was what made this train of thought particularly painful. Draco. He provoked Buckbeak, played out his injury, and saved Slytherin from playing an inconvenient match.
“Hope you aren’t getting distracted,” Draco teased. Harry didn’t reply but did a nosedive straight down, drawing everyone’s attention. Then he pulled back up and hovered back over the game, dodging bludgers and searching for the Snitch.
Though Ron was happy to accept that Harry had a boyfriend, he was incredibly against spending any time with Draco in any capacity. And, given they weren’t on speaking terms with Hermione, Harry was left alone with Draco.
Ahaha.... I'm posting this instead of studying for my physics final, which is tomorrow and I need to get a 100 on to get a B-. I love you all. Thank you for the comments. Until next time~
Blaise hummed an acknowledgment but didn’t say anything else. They were at the door to the common room. Draco turned to face Blaise. “Thanks for walking me back, I guess.”
Harry stayed with his hand over Draco's mouth until they couldn't hear Ron and Hermione walking anymore. Then he pulls away, painfully aware of how close they were. They stayed underneath the cloak. Harry's eyes were jumping from Draco's to his mouth.
“Shut up,” Draco said. “Anyway, I buy you food-” Draco raised his hand to Harry’s mouth to stop further protest, “-and we talk and kiss and stuff.”
Ah, you may have noticed I was functionally dead. Over winter break, my laptop broke, and then the spring semester started and I was doing 6 classes with work on top. Mandatory quarantine has given me a lot of free time. Have two chapters today as a treat :). I hope I will have time to update semi-regularly. Until next time~
They ran to the forest, where they hid behind a rock and listened. For an unbearably long time, there was silence, and Ron contented himself with Scabbers. Harry resisted the urge to look over the rock, to see if he could catch someone’s face through the window and guess how it was going, how Pansy and Blaise were managing.
But now it was Christmas. Hermione, though studying, was taking a much needed break from classes. Oliver was home for the holidays (though Harry, Fred, and George all agreed he was practicing at home and muttering formations in his sleep). He was left undistracted with his thoughts.
“If you ever touch me again-” Draco began to shout, but he noticed that Potter was grinning, his handsome green eyes sparkling. “What?”
“Not in a rude way. In an honest, I made a promise way. I can’t tell you. All that matters is I was up at four and I can’t wait to get back to bed.”
Pansy stood up and came over to him to gently pet his hair. “It’ll be okay. It might go away now that you can talk about it.”
“You should’ve given this to a professor. If it was left lying around, Sirius Black could’ve found it. I trust I shouldn’t have to tell you why that would be bad.”
Honeydukes, though not bustling with Hogwarts students, was suitably busy to allow Draco to slip out and act as though he had been there the whole time. He perused the candies, picking out sugar quills and, at a poke on the shoulder from Harry, some fudge.
“Perfect. Harry, you can go. Draco, if you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with you for a few minutes.”
“People might start to look for us,” Harry agreed, though Hermione, Ron, Pansy, and Blaise were all more than prepared to lie for their respective friends.
“Oh no, he’s blushing. Honestly, Malfoy? The one who we thought opened the Chamber of Secrets last year? The one who you just punched in the face?” Ron was becoming more passionate as he continued, and Hermine placed her hand on his arm to quiet him before they told all of Gryffindor about Harry and Draco.
They sat there for a few minutes. Pansy and Blaise were likely looking in Hogwarts to tell them they had failed. The sun set began to set, and, finally, Harry stood up. “Let’s get back, then,” he said, his voice hollow.
Lupin, almost unwillingly, agreed, and opened the dresser. Harry thought about Hagrid telling him he was a wizard, how his life with the Dursley’s would end for the most part and he could finally live free from bullies with people who would talk to him without fear in there eyes. Three meals a day. A room without locks. Possessions. Clothes that fit.
Ron shrugged. “The Purebloods are a bit touchy about it because they’re stuck up about everything. I can’t imagine the Malfoys being okay with their precious son going around snogging boys.”
They clinked the bottles together and clinked. It was chilled from the cold air and not nearly as satisfying as the warmth from inside the Three Broomsticks, yet it was the best thing Harry had ever tasted. “Thanks. I’ll pay you back when we get back to Hogwarts.”
“No. You’re right.” Harry stood up, only leaning slightly on Lupin. “If I can’t do it then, it won’t matter. Let’s go again.”
She handed the box to Potter, who did not look excited for the menial task ahead of him. Them. Ahead of them.
Half of Draco was rejoicing. Yes! Less manual labor! The other half was freaking the fuck out. Harry was now standing next to him, sleeves rolled up to his forearms. His arms were slightly defined in combination of how thin and active he was. He smelled like the soap they had been using and, faintly, of sweat, but not in an overpowering, unpleasant way.
He stood up and tried to not noticeably pull his eyes from Potter’s mouth. As he and Snape walked out of McGonagall’s office, he could hear McGonagall resume scolding Potter. “Go see Madame Pomfrey, Draco.”
He fell down to his knees as though someone knocked him down. In his head he heard a thud and a shriek. He was no longer flying.
“You know there’s a difference between goons and friends, Harry. Would you compare Ron and Hermione to Vincent and Gregory?”
“What?” Ron asked, puffing up and standing taller. It was more awkward than any run in with Slytherins had been, including when they pretended to be Crabbe and Goyle.
He got back to the Slytherin common room. It hadn’t even been an hour, so it was hardly late, but Pansy was nowhere to be found.
Ron groaned. “Mate, you know you’re like a brother to me, and I am completely fine with your choices. But please don’t make me spend any time with Malfoy.”
The boggart seemed to have figured it out, though. The woman was changing shape again, growing slightly taller, more masculine, more…
“How’d it go?” he asked, setting down a quill. They had a potions essay due. Harry hadn’t even started it.
“Good night.” He tiptoed into his dorm, where Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, and Blaise all slept. He closed the door as quietly as he could and crawled into his bed, distracted by the concept of having feelings for Potter.
Tears had formed in the corners of her eyes, and her voice had slowly raised during her quick monologue until she was nearly yelling. “Pansy, quiet down before you wake everyone up by saying you’re queer!”
Quidditch was miserable, and Harry was beginning to resent even being on the team. Surely anyone with a broom would be better than he was on the school brooms, which moved at clunky, uneven speeds and vibrated uncomfortably at certain heights. This was it. This was his worst moment. Going to practice and trying to catch the snitch only for the broom to revolt entirely. Oliver’s wails in the showers could be heard by all of Gryffindor.
“Yes, Draco. Thank you for cleaning up the tanks. I won’t bother you about this anymore.” He gave one last smile, and Draco left.
This led to a few more things happening. Draco’s hand erupted in white hot bursts of pain, and he yelped as he pulled his arm back. Potter didn’t make a sound but kicked Draco off of him, and then jumped on him to get in a few punches of his own. Crabbe and Goyle caught on and pulled Potter off of him, Weasley was straining to pull them both back, and the Head Weasel was shouting for them to stop.
Quietly, Draco said, “Do you think the You-Know-Who is really coming back?” Crabbe and Goyle shrugged in unison, and Draco was reminded that it was doubtful they thought much of anything about anything. As usual, Draco was left to ponder this on his own. Every year something had happened. Quirrel had been trying to bring He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named back, then the Mudbloods had been attacked. Both instances had the Dark Lord appear in one way or the other.
“Remember how well that worked out last time?” Hermione asked. “We’d probably get worse than the Forbidden Forest if we get caught with Buckbeak. We need something safer.”
Harry shrugged. Obviously he couldn’t tell them he was sneaking around to snog and, even worse, occasionally talk to Draco. They knew he wasn’t always running off to Quidditch (though that did take up the majority of his free time). And they knew his Patronus lessons with Professor Lupin were limited.
Harry nodded, thinking of his first broom. Something he was good at. Something people appreciated him for. “Okay.”
Alone, Lupin seemed more relaxed. “I’m glad that you reached out and became his friend. That can be the most important part of someone’s life. Thank you, Harry. I’m proud.”
He pulled apart from Draco. His heart was either beating so fast he couldn’t feel it or had completely stopped. Draco was in shock. Harry was sure he was, too.
O fuck y'all. So basically whenever I get an email about kudos on this story I'm like "??" but I get so happy that you guys like it. Leave a comment babes, I'd love to hear what you think. Until next time~
The day flew by in a haze of disappointment and pain. Transfiguration was fine, and he got through Potions by ignoring Potter completely, even though Crabbe and Goyle couldn’t quite understand why. Pansy ignored him.
Harry’s head whipped to the door. From outside, he heard Dumbledore’s familiar voice. “Yes, the pumpkins came in beautifully this year. Hagrid is a wonderful groundskeeper.”
Draco’s face blanched, and he turned to face Pansy, trying his best to hide any of the obvious fear on his face. He wanted her to start laughing at the absurdity of Draco having any feelings other than loathing for the Gryffindor prat. Instead, her face was still, as if she was trying her best to stay neutral and allow for Draco’s assumptions to bounce right off of her and back to him. “Good night, Pansy,” he said, his voice suddenly dry.
“Is that her name? I never knew, and I doubt he did, either.” Draco looked forward, almost vacant, to the wall. “He’s not an evil man, but he’s capable of evil. And that’s all anyone sees. And then they see me, and they connect dots, and the good families tell their kids to stay away from me, and my only friends are playing their cards right to cozy up to a pureblood family.”
“She doesn’t feel the same. I just wanted to test it, and she’s one of my closest friends, so I convinced her to kiss me. She’s boy crazy, she just thinks it was a silly thing we did.”
“I’ll buy you something from Honeydukes,” Draco said, every word seeming to blow a soft breath that sent shivers down Harry’s spine.
“I didn’t know you were staying over break.” He meant it to come out a little miffed, but he sounded happy. “Did anything happen?”
Hermione took Ron’s arm. “Yes, let’s leave Harry alone with… Well, come on.” Harry watched as Hermione dragged Ron away.
“In the middle of the Great Hall? Potter, I am appalled. Never, in all my years-” Draco tuned out. He could guess the majority of this would be McGonagall harping on Potter for putting Gryffindor house to shame. Besides, he had something better to do, like nurse his aching thumb. Merlin’s sake, how did he break his thumb?
“Right. Well, they gave me a map.” Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out the Marauder's Map. “I solemnly swear I’m up to no good,” he said, ignoring Draco’s odd look and tapping it with his wand. Sure enough, the ink blossomed into a map of Hogwarts. “See? It shows where everyone is.”
He didn’t talk with Draco about his plans for Christmas break. It was a surprise to see him at the Slytherin table with Pansy and another Slytherin he didn’t really know. “I didn’t know Malfoy stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas break,” Ron said, voicing Harry’s thoughts.
“He’s alive!” Ron said, hugging his pet close once he was safely in his hands. “Oh, Scabbers!” He looked to Harry with joy, then to Hermioned, then he remembered the past month. “Oh. Er. Sorry.”
Draco jumped as a loud crash sounded through the hall. “Stay here,” Filch growled, and Draco and Potter looked at each other before watching him limp out of the room.
Harry was grateful to hide under the invisibility cloak until they were back in the tunnel. “So. Biting, huh?” Draco asked.
No. Blaise wasn’t asking questions. He seemed content to just follow Draco, almost as if he was playing the part of Crabbe and Goyle. Truth be told, Draco hardly talked to any of the other Slytherins in his year. Crabbe and Goyle were his go-to friends because they were hopeless without anyone smarter to lead them around, and Pansy was a recent addition. Generally, the other Slytherins seemed scared of the Malfoy association with You-Know-Who. Having Blaise around would be much appreciated.
They were face to face, and Draco was conscious of the fact Potter had grown since they first met, and he now had an inch over Draco. “You’re just scared.”
Hello darlings. I'm back and very busy. Until the 10th I'm babysitting, so I doubt there will be another chapter this week. Sorry. After that, I have a friend's birthday and then a two day beach trip. And school starts on the 26th. So... Stick with me? ~Until next time.
Lupin examined him, and Draco pulled back into his chair. “I know that Hogwarts can be tough. Sometimes, you find friends and your years here are easy. Sometimes, you don’t. It can be incredibly lonely here.” Lupin was somewhere else, and Draco took this moment to search his face. The lines on his face and the gray in his hair seemed so much more prominent than usually; generally, he only looked tired. Now, though, he looked old despite his age.
“Nothing.” She looked up from her nails into Draco’s eyes and he repeated, “Nothing! I’m tired, okay? I’ll just head to bed.”
“No,” Harry said. “We can’t just let him run free, either. He’s too comfortable, I think. He’d probably just stay right we he was if we cut him free.” He huffed. “I just don’t know.”
Pansy shot up and slapped him, and they both froze. The sound seemed deafening, and they held their breath as they expected someone to wake up. But all that happened was Blaise shifting under his blanket, and they both sighed.
“No, go to Hogsmeade, have fun, bring me back something if you really want,” Harry replied, hoping his forced smile at least looked genuine. “I’m fine, guys.”
Lupin smiled. “I don’t want to ask about the boggart, if that’s what you’re worried about. I understand the nuances of fear. I certainly don’t appreciate people asking about mine.” Lupin walked behind his desk and sat down, motioning for Draco to do the same. Draco pulled up one of more comfortable looking chairs and sat.
So Harry flew as fast as he could away from the Snitch, doing his best to keep an eye on it. Draco was well behind him, the Nimbus 2001 no match for the Firebolt. He slowed to a stop and turned to Draco. “Whoops. Missed it.”
“Don’t think so. She’s probably getting extra work from the other classes. Like an independent study.”
Hermione stood, then gave Ron her hand to help him up. “Draco’s lucky he changed his tune,” Ron said. “I’d kill him otherwise.”
Draco grimaced and got into the common room. The misunderstanding hung heavy over his head. He wouldn’t run and tell, obviously, but he felt dirty being privy to information because Blaise thought he was in a similar position.
Harry was, at the moment, quite the opposite of fine. Once all of the professors left the Three Broomsticks he ran, holding his invisibility cloak closer with the goal of getting to Honeydukes as fast as possible. Sirius Black was his godfather. He was their best friend and he sold them out. It made everything so much worse somehow.
The day flew by. Pansy was kind enough to refrain from teasing him whenever Potter was near, and Draco found himself not too worried that she knew his darkest secret. They were normal again.
“I won’t force you to do anything,” Harry replied. “Just… Next Hogsmeade trip, maybe we should actually go somewhere together and be civil. We could even bring Hermione?” Ron didn’t respond, but made a wishy-washy gesture.
They came to the exit to Honeydukes, and Harry carefully opened the door. Seeing nobody, he slipped through, helped Draco up, and put the invisibility cloak over both of them. “Don’t want anyone seeing us coming out of the back room,” Harry whispered, dreadfully close to Draco’s ear. He was sure he didn’t imagine his shiver.
“Good evening, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said. “I heard your detention with Professor Lupin went well yesterday. I hope you can continue that streak. Tonight will be the same as Monday night. Please behave.”
Draco stared in detached disgust as Hagrid left them to tend to the invisible creatures. Potter reached into the bucket and threw a piece. “Are you going to help?” he asked.
The crowd erupted in anger as two bludgers were hit directly at Oliver, who nearly fell of the broom. “It seems that Slytherin has no qualms about playing dirty today, as they seemed to have realized they have no skill otherwise,” Lee Jordan said, McGonagall clearly protesting in the background. “Johnson scores the penalty!” Draco scowled. “And Spinnet recovers quickly and scores again!”
“I want to kill Sirius Black because my parents trusted him more than anything and honestly if either of you did that to me I’d be too devastated for words and I can’t imagine how anyone can be so evil and frankly I’m tired of Voldemort always trying to kill me in one way or another and I’ve been snogging Draco and my broom’s broken so I don’t know how I’ll play in our match against Ravenclaw and I still have about twenty essays to do and-”
They walked back to Hogwarts together. They were probably only out for a half hour so Filch wasn’t too upset to be letting them back inside. “I’ll see you tomorrow. Last one,” Potter said with a small smile, and Draco had the sudden, strongest urge to pull him close and kiss him.
Draco was in the common room doing homework. Classes were wonderful again with Pansy talking to him, and Blaise was slowly inserting himself into their friendship. It was probably desperation, but the second day of this happening made Draco feel like he was invincible. He was happy.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck and Harry suddenly felt guilty. “Right. Sorry. Well, I’ve got an essay to work on. Get back to your friends.”
It was as though they won the Quidditch cup in the Gryffindor common room. Harry managed to slip away from the celebrations and sneak down to one of the spots he and Draco met up at. Sure enough, he was waiting.
“He was standing over me with a knife! The curtains were slashed and, and I think he thought I was Harry because when I woke up and screamed he was gone! ” Ron said, barely breathing between sentences. All of Gryffindor was awake, and Hermione was next to Ron, holding onto his arm. Harry was somewhere between panic and feeling nothing. Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all wearing varying expressions of morbid excitement.
“They aren’t too happy it’s you, but it could be worse.” He nodded. “They won’t say anything. Even if they wanted to, they wouldn’t do that to me.”
The silence was deafening. Then a few people screamed, and everyone started to talk until McGonagall and Percy managed to quiet everyone. “Sir Cadogan! How could you let him in?”
Weeks passed. Harry’s days were split between homework and classes, Quidditch practice, and slipping away to quiet corners for a few minutes to see Draco.
“I think I already know the answer to this, but have you ever cleaned anything in your life?” Potter was scrubbing at a large splotch inside one of his tanks.
Based on Harry’s timid hand as he took a… snack, Pansy and Blaise cautiously took one and avoided any ingestion. “It’ll be okay, Hagrid,” Harry said. “If anyone can convince them, it’s these two.” Pansy grinned.
He heard footsteps and he managed to get himself more onto his bed, where he could reasonably feign sleep. “Harry?”
“You finished it already,” Pansy replied, looking at her perfectly filed nails. “What’s going on with you, Draco?”
When they first arrived at Hogwarts, Draco and Pansy held each other at an arm’s distance, only interested in what they could gain from each other. Somewhere down the line Pansy had transcended all else to be something he sorely needed: a friend. Now he was scaring her off. “He thinks he’s Dumbledore’s golden boy,” Pansy said, sounding rather bored.
Ron looked shocked, but covered it by taking a bit of his food and saying, “Well, alright then,” through a mouthful of toast.
Draco gave him a thankful look. “Well, exactly. And he hasn’t been a saint recently. What he did to the Weasley girl-”
“There still are dementors everywhere! How were you going to propose we sneak out?” Draco made a face very much along the lines of I-asked-you-first, and Harry sighed. “Fred and George, you know them right?”
He watched Potter walk away and felt a sudden conviction. He rushed to the common room and penned a quick letter, which he sent to Pansy. He could no longer keep this to himself.
“I was hoping I could speak with you about that.” Professor Snape nodded, and they stepped out of the office. “I should hope I can leave you two alone for five minutes.”
Eventually, he got himself out of his bed and joined Ron and Hermione to get breakfast. “What happened last night?” Hermione asked, jumping right into it.
“I obviously wouldn’t bring a dementor here. Professor Dumbledore already banned them from the grounds, but it would be too draining for practice. However, for you to do the charm without stress acting on you would be pointless. Instead, we will use the boggart.”
Harry looked at Ron, thought for a moment if he really wanted to say it, then said, “We should all hang out.”
Yes, he wanted Ron, Hermione, and Draco to get along. He was certain they would if Draco continued to be real instead of aloof.
“No, you won’t,” Blaise said. They held a tense glare. This was a discussion they had had many times. For Blaise and Pansy to defend Buckbeak wasn’t inherently bad; one could insist they wanted to buy it, and Lucius would be killing a worthy purchase. But for the Gryffindors to be there would raise questions about any friendship, which could turn back dangerously on Draco. The three of them were there to mollify Hagrid beforehand.
Draco grabbed the front of Harry’s shirt and pulled him into a deep kiss. He fell onto Draco, who was half on the snow and grass and half engulfed by the cloak. They were frantic. Draco was grabbing and pulling Harry as though he were falling, and Harry was doing his best to catch him.
“You what?” His eyes darted between her and Blaise, and then behind them to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Hagrid shook his head and Fang looked nervously up at him before finally sniffing the Slytherins, who couldn’t mask their fear. He grabbed a plate of… dubious baked goods and turned back to them. “Fine. Eat if you’re goin’ to stay.”
“He has friends! You’ve seen the two goons that follow him around everywhere.” What was Potter doing there? Why was Lupin talking about him?
Draco did his best to not stare back at him, mouth agape. “I’ll keep that in mind.” Blaise nodded and pulled back, and Draco watched as he made his way to arithmancy. He mulled over just how outlandish that was. There was a reason Slytherins were characterized by snakes, and it wasn’t just for their founder’s Parselmouth status. They were a group that desired success no matter the cost, and knew that exposing themselves could lead to their downfall. For Blaise to trust Draco with a history of abuse, if that was what he was implying…
Draco felt himself tense up, and decided he had quite enough of snooping around. He took a few steps back, walked normally toward the door, and knocked. Lupin answered. He smiled. “Good evening, Draco. Harry and I have been waiting.”
They walked to the pitch, the cheering more thunderous than ever before. Harry and Draco avoided the others eyes as the teams faced off. Oliver and Flint glared, tried to break each other’s hands, then half-listened as the rules were reiterated.
“Oh, we get caught plenty,” Hermione muttered. “We’ll get caught now if we aren’t careful. Next weekend, Buckbeak is going to be executed. We have to help him escape without anyone noticing.”
Guilt hit Harry like a ton of bricks. It wasn’t the same for him. Last year, everyone had hated him, and the Dursleys couldn’t possibly think less of him. As much as he would prefer nobody knew to avoid the trouble, he would survive. What would happen to Draco? What about his family?
He was doomed. And, as horrifying as it was to believe that anyone had picked up on his obsession with Potter, Pansy knew it.
Harry followed Draco to the Quidditch pitch, the grounds empty as everyone spent the crisp morning in the Great Hall. The locker rooms were no good, as eventually a team would come in, and the field would soon be crowded. But the rafters beneath the bleachers were a good spot to hide, and Harry pulled back some of the fabric to let Draco in first.
Ron was awake waiting for him, and Hermione was awake doing homework as far from him as possible. They still hadn’t spoken since McGonagall took the Firebolt. It was a sore spot neither of them were over (though possibly nobody was as distraught to Oliver, who had apparently taken to crying in the shower again).
“You’re both weird,” Ron said, rolling his eyes. “Anyway, I hate to change the subject, but we should really talk about Sirius Black.”
“Why do your lot always play dirty?” Harry asked. Alicia scored, and Harry joined in on the cheer as Draco rolled his eyes.
“He’s Malfoy,” Hermione replied. “He’s a bully and he’ll probably sell you out the first chance he gets. And… Well, would you want to date a boy in general?”
Draco wondered what Lupin’s time at Hogwarts had been like. Did he see Potter and admire him for the adoration he received? Did it make him remember his own time in the wide, empty halls, sitting alone in his common room as he tuned in and out of the conversations of people around him, never truly knowing how he could come in or if he was wanted. Or had he been like Potter, and had merely glanced over the lonelier kids, only trying to relate to Draco now out of some past guilt?
Draco did fall back asleep once Pansy had left, but it had been a while after, and he only ended up catching a quick extra thirty minutes. He and Pansy were groggy the whole day, and he was grateful Hagrid had cowered so much to his father to reduce lessons to caring to flobberworms. He noticed the occasional glances Potter would take toward him; he figured this was his way of making sure he didn’t fake anymore injuries.
Part of Draco wanted to bite back. However, he replied honestly. “I had to wake up early this morning. Four in the morning early.”
Hagrid’s eyes flickered back and forth before he moved to let them inside his hut. He stopped Harry. “What did you do?”
Draco looked at his slimy hands in disgust before disappearing the remains of meat and juices. He turned to Potter and did the same. “What was that for?”
“Of course he likes him, they’ve been swapping spit for a while now.” Hermione and Harry both made disgusted faces and turned to glare at Ron. “What?”
Harry had moved through the weekend in a haze. The Gryffindor match against Hufflepuff still weighed heavily on him; Oliver was running them ragged with practices and he was not excited to jump in after missing them for a week. And the way he had just passed out after the dementors appeared… Not to mention his broom was permanently out of commission.
He wondered, idly, what Ron did when he was off with Draco, and one day asked. “No offense, mate, but I’ve seen how Fred and George act with you, and I don’t think they’d hang out with you that much.”
“Hermione… I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have blamed Crookshanks, and I really shouldn’t have blamed you. Can you-” was about as far as Ron got before Hermione had her arms wrapped around him with a wail. Harry’s heart sank when she explained how lonely and stressed she was even without Divination, and they spent the rest of their Saturday in the Gryffindor common room making up for lost time, sitting close together.
Draco looked down at his fist and moved his thumb accordingly. “Do you get into a lot of Muggle scuffles?”
The Head Weasel explained what happened and Draco pushed himself up and looked around. His hand hurt, his thumb especially, and his ribs hurt from where Potter had punched him. Potter was propped up against the table, a red mark on his cheek and his glasses somewhere on the floor. Granger was pulling up Weasley, who didn’t look hurt, and Crabbe and Goyle got to their feet, also unharmed. Everyone in the Great Hall was looking at them. He could see the other Weasleys standing a ways away, as though prepared to have jumped in, and he could see Pansy and Daphne, standing up to see what trouble Draco had made for himself.
“I’m not leaving you two alone, I just have a very busy class schedule,” Hermione replied, sticking her nose up and setting her runes textbook down. “Where have you been, though?”
“Until our detentions are over,” Draco agreed, his heart threatening to jump out of his throat and proclaim, “HARRY POTTER I LOVE HARRY POTTER PLEASE KISS ME HARRY POTTER.”
Potter tossed another piece of meat. “Are you going to keep complaining, or do I have to keep forcing you to help?”
“If I’m going to be nice to him, he’s got to be nice to me,” Draco said, clenching and unclenching his hands and staring angrily at where Ron had been.
“Everyone’s already against the Slytherin house. We don’t have to be against each other,” he said, swiping Draco’s essay from beneath his quill. “It’d be worth it to talk befriend the Slytherins, then, and not just stick with your two lackeys.”
Harry looked at the dresser, which was thumping and shaking, and nodded. He had suspected as much when he told Lupin he feared them. “Okay. I’m ready.”
Harry fell asleep only after he thought about his mother’s voice. For the first time since they had died, he was able to hear her.
“Not Malfoy for sure,” Harry replied confidently, not really feeling it. It was impossible to explain that Draco had been kinder, much to his word that he would leave Harry’s friends alone. He had extended this to professors and other Gryffindors. He was capable of growing.
He focused his attention once more on the few buttons he had left. Potter had finished the needles and was putting the matchsticks in the box. Finished, Draco picked up the box and brought it up to McGonagall’s desk. “We finished, Professor.”
In about a split second, a series of thoughts ran through his head. He didn’t know what his greatest fear was. Not snakes. Not heights. Probably not spiders. Not vampires. Not werewolves.
Draco shrugged. “Well, Crabbe and Goyle aren’t smart enough to. And Pansy and Blaise have their own issues.”
For their part, they handled it well. Hermione seemed more put off than Ron, which Harry was not expecting (though if you asked him why, he wouldn’t be able to explain it). “Hermione, what’s your problem?” Ron asked, surprisingly defensive.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, we definitely do those things. But… Something is off. It’s my father’s fault. Everything he did when he was younger and-”
“Okay, fine, jeez.” Draco picked up the box and looked away. “I’m sorry, okay? I am. It’ll stop today.”
“Bullshit,” she hissed as they heard footsteps down the hall. “I noticed how you used to look at Blaise, and I know how you feel about Potter. If I came out to you, you have to do the same for me.”
“I know. It’s spectacular. Fred and George showed me this passage, by the one statue, you know the witch?” Draco nodded. “Right. There’s a tunnel, going right into Honeydukes. From there I went with Ron and Hermione.”
Draco eyed them all now that he was closer. It looked like Weasley and Potter rolled out of bed in their robes for how rumpled they were. Draco doubted Potter ever attempted to comb his hair, and it was hard to tell if Weasley’s face was covered in acne, freckles, or both. He’d give it to Granger, her clothes were tidy, but her hair gave him the distinct impression she had been struck by lightning, and the bucked teeth made her look like a mouse. “Read the news lately, Potter? Or do you rely on Granger to read it to you?”
He was given detention for the rest of the year. All of Gryffindor slept uneasily that night, and the rest of Hogwarts was near riotous in the morning, and Ron had turned his story into how he single handedly fought off Black, and the commotion woke everyone up. Harry and Hermione shared tired looks.
He looked crushed. “Okay.” He stood up, unusually quick and awkward. The invisibility cloak pulled at his shoulders and off of Harry, creating the effect of half of Draco's torso going missing.
Hey! I'm back quicker than I thought I'd be. I'm glad you guys seemed to enjoy the first chapter, despite how short it was. Don't worry. We're getting into plot and fluff. I hope you enjoyed. Also! I do not have my copy of the third book on me as of writing it, so I'm playing kind of fast and loose with the official timeline. If you read this and think, "Wait, this doesn't happen until a few chapters later," you're probably right! You are more than welcome to tell me; one day I will return to edit and that will be worked in. Until next time~
“I can’t imagine they look anything alike, even in the dark,” Pansy said. “Weasley’s too pale, and Potter’s hair doesn’t look red in any light.”
“No,” Harry replied honestly. He didn’t have a monopoly on Draco’s time and he wasn’t even sure what they were so who could possibly care about that, right? But Draco, hiding it poorly, looked a bit put off, and Harry recovered with, “But I’d be a bit lonely, I guess.”
He looked outside. It was a rare sunny day despite the frigid temperature, and he had a feeling Hermione would bring them outside so she could study in the pleasant weather. And he could guess they were still curious as to why he had gotten back so early and why he didn't want to talk about anything that happened.
He had asked his father about Black as soon as news came out that he broke out. All he knew was that Black was a double-agent, so deeply involved that he, someone in the Dark Lord’s inner circle, had never even known he was a Death Eater. He didn’t know if he was acting out some plan to revive him. Draco got the feeling he wasn’t excited about that outcome.
First thing's first: my tumblr is unprofessionalartist if anyone wants to find and talk to me there :3
Draco didn’t bother to look back at Blaise as they walked down to the dungeons, and Blaise made no attempt to spark up a conversation. Draco wished Crabbe and Goyle had tried to drag him away instead, so he could be around people who wouldn’t try to figure out why his father was evidently his greatest fear.
Draco rolled his eyes but did scrub harder at the splotches on the tanks. By the time he had finished his first tank, Potter had finished both of his. “A little help?”
Percy, stuck in the usual gravitational pull he found himself in when anyone of authority was around, was behind McGonagall, apologizing fervently. “I am so sorry about my brother causing this commotion over a dream,” he bit, staring down Ron.
“No problem.” Blaise glanced down both ends of the hallway, and, seeing nobody, leaned closer to Draco and said, quietly, “I knew the look on your dad’s face. I’ve seen it on… Enough people. If you ever want to talk about anything, I’m here.”
McGonagall had sent an owl to Draco with the time and location of his detention (her classroom at eight). He wound up at her classroom at almost the exact same time as Potter, and they exchanged less than friendly looks. McGonagall saw them walk, in shooting each other death glares, and said, “I hope you both act better than that. You’ll be transfiguring these items back to their original states.” She pulled out a bin full of needles and buttons. “The needles were matchsticks and the buttons were beetles. Do be careful not to squish the beetles.”
For a little bit, they were silent. Harry wasn’t quite comfortable, and he wasn’t sure Draco was, either. So he said, “Did I tell you about the family I live with, yet?” knowing full well he hadn’t. Draco said as much. So he told him.
“What if we just show up and use our Slytherin charm to talk the Ministry out of going through with it?” Pansy batted her eyelashes and put her chin on the intersection of her fingers. “After all, that’s what got us into this mess.”
Pansy stroked his hair and he frowned. He could guess that she was bored of his favorite conversation topic and, in all honesty, he was too. Yet here they were; he was laying on one of the common room couches with his head on her lap to vent about Potter’s existence. It was well into the morning, allowing them privacy that was rarely found in the Slytherin common room.
“Exactly.” There was silence and Draco wondered if he should come in, but then he heard Lupin continue. “Alright, you don’t have to be his friend. Just try to be nicer to him. Or, at the very least, don’t get into fist fights in the middle of the Great Hall.”
Dean had once again drawn a large banner with the crest of Gryffindor skillfully drawn in the center. Hermione had helped him jinx it to roar every few minutes. At breakfast, Harry was surrounded by teammates and friends all excitedly discussing what was to come. He caught Draco’s eye, nodded at his motion to escape the Great Hall, and relied on Ron and Hermione to keep anyone from finding him.
It was easier to meet in a quiet corridor with most of the students gone. Draco came to one of their usual spots, near a window in a hallway rarely used. “I figured I’d find you somewhere,” he said.
Draco let them into the shared boys dorm, where Blaise was leaning casually on a chair and Pansy was sprawled out on one of the beds. Once Draco closed the door, Harry removed the cloak and Pansy gasped. “That’s not fair,” she said.
He glared at him. “Be my guest. Put them back in the box before you transfigure them so they don’t escape.”
He couldn’t stomach much at breakfast. Pansy sat beside him and didn’t bring up anything from their conversation, which was good considering he was sitting with Crabbe and Goyle. He looked over a Potions essay as he twirled his fork in his fingers. “Check out the paper,” Pansy said, handing him the copy of the Daily Prophet she had been reading.
Hey all. Being fully employed takes a lot more time than I expected. I hope I didn't keep you guys too long. Thanks for sticking around and reading. Excitingly, I have finished writing this draft :) So this fic will be finished in due time. Until next time~
“I’m not asking you to go easy on me, because that would be like saying you’re better than me, which I’m not saying, but would it be so awful to make sure your boyfriend wins a match?” Draco, of course, knew that was out of the question, not only because Ron had placed a bet, but because of Harry’s competitive nature.
“Okay,” Harry replied, his heart twisting. Draco sat beside him and threw one shoulder over Harry and another over himself. It was certainly bigger than either of them, but not necessarily so large they could both sit under it without half sitting on each other. Dracos right leg was slung over both of Harry’s, and he his right shoulder was pressed against Harry’s chest. “Right then. Cheers?”
He swallowed and drew back out of his head, turning his attention back to stroke Draco’s shoulder until his breathing steadied.
“Nobody knows what they look like,” Blaise replied. “They change their form to look like your worst fear.”
“Good. I didn’t break it. You did. How-” he stopped himself, sighed, then turned to face Draco. “I don’t like you, but this is awkward. Truce?”
I feel like two months is a personal record for update times. Thanks for sticking around. A fair warning: it's a it plot heavy for a while. But fear not. There will be fluff :) Until next time~
“I’ll teach you as soon as I figure it out,” Harry replied. “You just have to think of a happy memory. It’s the hardest part to hold onto a memory when they’re sucking out all of the joy from you.” Draco looked at Harry, an odd look on his face. “What?”
They weren't the only students enjoying the weather. Some first years were playing games while older students simply walked alongside the lake. Harry looked around at everyone around them and spotted white blonde hair. There was no way Draco had always been this present and Harry was only noticing now, as he always had noticed Draco. He had to be following him.
“Professor Hagrid,” Pansy began, looking as though she was trying not to show she had just stepped in raw sewage. Hagrid’s face screwed up in confusion and hurt. “My friends and I would like to personally appeal to the Minister in defense of your Hippogriff.”
Pansy glared and turned as dramatically as she could, her short, black hair swaying as she walked away. “Nice,” Blaise said. “You pissed off your girlfriend.”
There was a horrifying moment where Pansy looked directly in his eyes, almost as if to silently communicate that she knew it was bullshit and would call him out on it, but she leaned back again and said. “Alright. Puke-y eyes, I guess.”
“Weasley!” They all turned to look at Draco, Pansy, and Blaise.They were outside between classes, mostly alone. Harry felt guilty at the unease of seeing three Slytherins at once.
“Weasley threw his bat,” he defended as Oliver blocked the shot and Harry cheered once more. 20-0 Gryffindor.
Their detention that night would be overseen by Filch, and his stomach dropped. He wasn’t sure what would be worse; the manual labor or the nonstop insults that would come their way. At eight they met in the trophy room, where Filch told them they would be polishing the trophies and plaques. All of them. No magic.
Draco stared at the entrance. Kids shuffled in tiredly, and a bushy mane of hair caught his eye. He scowled. If Granger was here, it wouldn’t take long for Potter and Weasley to follow. What a pain. Sure enough, the three were together, Potter between them. Him and his stupid messy hair, which barely hid his stupid scar and beautiful eyes.
Together they half carried Draco out of the classroom. “Should we take him to Madam Pomfrey?” Blaise asked, supporting most of Draco’s weight. Draco found himself blushing. It was a short-lived crush, but Blaise was aggressively Slytherin and handsome in a put-together way as opposed to Potter’s I-rolled-out-of-a-dumpster-but-it’s-kind-of-working way.
“Which one of you wrote down every single password,” McGonagall hissed, turning to face the Gryffindors, her anger emanating off of her. Perhaps it was Neville’s red face and downcast eyes that made everyone turn to look at him.
And then the verbal barrage started. “To think I wasted thirteen years raising such an ungrateful disgrace, an utter disappointment, someone willing to throw the Malfoy bloodline away for trash, because he’s too weak to get over-”
“I could’ve gone my whole life without going back into the Slytherin common room,” Ron murmured as, huddled underneath the invisibility cloak, they waited next to the door. Hermione was nearly vibrating with nerves and Harry couldn’t blame her.
O shit gays y'all dig this huh. Thank you so much for reading and I hope this update didn't take too long. I just got a job and I start on Monday so let's see how frequent updates are gonna be? That being said, I'm super good on homework right now and spring break is SO CLOSE. Until next time~
Now that he had the Firebolt, he was spending more time with Ron and Hermione. Well, Ron at least, as Hermione was nearly frantic from the exponential growth of her work. They could spend some time researching for Buckbeak’s case, but he was busy with Quidditch and the Patronus.
“We’re all worried about Harry,” Hermione said slowly. Harry was beginning to regret things more. “Maybe we can all work together.”
They transfigured the items back to their original forms for a few minutes in silence before Potter asked, “You seemed tired today.”
Wide-eyed, Hagrid pushed the Gryffindors together and Harry covered them with the invisibility cloak as Fudge could be heard saying, “On with it, Professor, I have other meetings to attend to.”
“Why would you tell them? They probably think you’re disgusting, and they’ll tell everyone about me, and, oh Merlin-”
Draco let out a sharp laugh. “My ears would bleed! Ugh, and his face. He’s hideous. He’s all gaunt-y and gross and his eyes are too green and pretty-”
“He can make it work. I’ll get Crabbe and Goyle out of the room and we can meet there,” Draco replied. Nine?”
To erase the subtext and make it real was horrifying, but Draco had listened and said nothing, only resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
This was how Draco finished his lengthy explanation of everything he had been feeling for the past few months. Pansy listened with a blank face until he flopped over onto the couch, alone in the common room in the early hours of the morning. She cracked a smile and said, “You fell hard.”
“Are you okay?” Hermione asked when he fell into the open chair next to them. They were playing chess. He wasn’t great at the game by any means, or even good, but from what he could tell Ron was winning.
Classes were classes. Though Ron and Harry were nowhere near as busy as Hermione, their classes, save for Care of Magical Creatures as Hagrid had yet to regain confidence for anything bigger than a flobberworm, were stacking on work as the end of the year drew nearer. Even divination was becoming more difficult, not accounted for Trelawney’s continued claims that Harry was about to drop dead any minute.
“Gryffindor starts with the Quaffle, Johnson to Bell, then Bell to Spinnet, and back to Johnson, who scores early!” The applause was deafening, and the score was 10-0 Gryffindor. As Lee Jordan continued narrating, Harry noticed Draco was trailing not too far behind him.
“It’s good that you’re learning how to get rid of them. I wish I could,” Draco shuddered. “I don’t faint, but I don’t feel good, either.”
He didn’t have to deal with Draco anymore. He could skirt around him in class and hope he was too embarrassed by their kiss to bring it up to anyone. He could ignore this. He would be fine.
The door opened, and he and Potter both turned to see Professor Snape. “Minerva,” he said, with a slight nod. “I’ll handle Draco’s punishment from here.”
They sat down, leaving a chair in between them, and Potter poured the buttons and needles gently onto the table. Then he started picking up the buttons and putting them back in the box.
They agreed on it, but nobody was quite happy. It felt like nothing had been accomplished, and Harry could see the defeat on Draco’s face as he snuck them back out.
Draco returned to the common room in a much more annoyed mood than when he left. Pansy hadn’t returned and he tried to focus again on his homework. Their detention would be with Hagrid tonight, and Draco was not looking forward to his return to the Forbidden Forest. If it wasn’t for how embarrassing the situation was, he would’ve written his father about the excessive punishments used by the school.
“Fine. I trust you.” Harry wasn’t quite sure how to explain how hearing that made him feel. Alarmingly, he wanted Draco to trust him. Him conceding this far gave him an electric feeling. He thought about what Hermione said, and he wasn’t so sure he was firm in his choice to not date Draco. More than this could be nice. More than this would mean Draco’s family, though, and the response of their peers. And whether or not Draco could be serious about this.
“It’s an imposing name,” Blaise said. “Remember, Draco, just because we supported the movement doesn’t mean most of our parents didn’t also fear it. I’m willing to bet your father felt the same. Him being in the inner circle intimidates plenty of us.”
“I got it back!” Harry shouted as he came back into the common room. Ron, George, and Fred all whooped, and Oliver fell to his knees and let out a sob. He looked at Hermione, who was glaring at him, and he felt a pit in his stomach. He grabbed Ron and brought him to her table, which was overflowing with books.
They lifted into the sky, and Harry relished how smoothly the Firebolt responded to his movements. He knew after their last practices that his team would excel. Oliver was performing better than he ever had, and Angelina, Katie, and Alicia had them up to an 80 point lead.
“That’s not what I meant,” Draco hissed, doing his best to not yell. “We’re two underage wizards and he’s literally blown people up!”
Hey hey hey, college hasn't gotten too rough yet! So have a chapter my lovelies, I was really happy to see that with one short chapter everyone still seemed excited. Feel free to leave a comment, I love to hear what you think! Until next time~
Draco sat next to Potter and took the box of buttons. “I can handle a few beetles, you know,” Potter said.
“Eugh. I see why you let me in first, there’s spiderwebs everywhere,” Draco muttered, wiping at the air in front of him, then at his chest. Neither of them were in their uniforms today, but Draco was still wearing immaculate robes. Harry, in a hand-me-down shirt, pair of pants, and pair of shoes, shrugged.
Seeing that there would be no conversation continuing between the two, Lupin said, “Right, well, the grindylow tanks need cleaning. I’ve already removed them, so the both of you will be able to handle it. Oh, and you can’t use magic. You’ll have to do it by hand.”
He knew why she was ignoring him; he wasn’t an idiot. He just didn’t know how he could apologize. Apologizing would mean opening up about his fear, which would mean opening up about everything else he had been feeling. He couldn’t admit he liked Potter to himself, much less anyone else.
They separated and smiled, and fell right back into place like nothing had happened. Hermione was, in fact, doing far too much, but, “I made time to go to the Ravenclaw match already, so don’t worry. Besides, I dropped Divination and that’s made it easier.”
“Let’s go to Hogsmeade, then. We can sneak out under the invisibility cloak. And you weren’t able to go on the last trip. I can show you around.” Draco was grinning, more than he usually allowed himself to, and his cheeks were tinted red. He was beautiful.
“The map.” Lupin stuck his hand out and Harry gave it to him without a second thought. His mouth fell open. “The Marauder's map… Where did you find this? Filch took this years ago…”
“We could make sure someone’s with Harry at all times,” Ron said, the ultimate act of betrayal. “Hermione and me are in all of his classes already.”
Lupin nodded. “It’s not an easy spell. You hold your wand just so, and say expecto patronum. But you must think of something that makes you truly happy. Happier than anything, something to hold onto while the dementor tries to chip away at your sanity. That’s what makes it so difficult.”
“So neither of you have seen them? That’s good. They bring the carriages to Hogwarts from the train. I’ve got the only trained herd.”
Draco felt like he was shaking. They were still facing each other, mere inches apart. All he could think about was Sirius Black himself, lanky and grimy with madness in his eyes, bursting through the doors. “You’re shaking.”
Hagrid opened the door and Harry, Ron, and Hermione scurried out. “Right, come in, then,” Hagrid said.
“Alright then.” Potter finished the matchsticks and turned to help Draco. “Not used to waking up at four?”
“Shocking,” Potter replied. “Well, actually scrub the tank instead of gliding over it. You’re not doing anything, and I don’t want to end up cleaning all of these.”
He almost asked what Lupin’s boggart was, for he hadn’t seen it in the commotion of his last class, but he stopped himself. “What is it, then?”
“Don’t worry about it.” Generally, they would make out for a bit before sitting in comfortable silence. Today, Harry had pulled away before anything happened, and the most Draco had done was lighty grab his sleeve to pull him to sit next to him.
“Well done Harry!” Lupin exclaimed, and the boggart was gone. Harry finished his chocolate bar, his head clearing but his energy gone. Lupin handed him another.
And the screams returned, and Harry was felled instantly. His mother’s voice dragged him down, and he slipped into it, somewhere close to willingly.
I DIDN'T DIE! I am in college tho so, same diff. I've been so excited to post this chapter. It is..... my favorite, and I hope you enjoyed. I have no clue when the next chapter will be, so please bear with me. But fear not, dear friends, because I'm not abandoning this! Until next time~
Harry had the idea that they were probably going to agree to something incredibly stupid. “Yes. And?”
He was working on a Charms essay when Blaise sat across from him. “Are you going to talk to Pansy?” he whispered, conscious of Madam Pince lurking a few shelves down.
Harry pulled out the Marauder's map and, finding the corridor clear, let them both back into Hogwarts. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
“Right.” He watched Draco stride away. He wasn’t quite sure what they were, or if they were anything. He wasn’t even sure if he wanted them to be anything. The thought of Draco staying back to spend the day with him did give him an odd, not entirely unpleasant feeling in his stomach.
She looked in the box and gave them both a small, sincere smile. “That was faster than I expected. I hope you’ve realized it isn’t so hard to not be at each other’s throats all the time?” They both murmured an agreement. “Very good. You’re both dismissed. I’ll will send you the details of your next detention tomorrow.”
Without the Marauder's Map, Harry was unable to sneak out to Hogsmeade with Draco, and their time together was spent in a quiet corner or, as the weather got nicer, a secluded area outside. Now that they were more comfortable with each other, being boyfriends after all, they could only be paranoid over anyone finding them. Four people knowing seemed too many, and Harry appreciated Draco’s initial anxiety over Hermione and Ron once Pansy and Blaise knew.
“I think the best we can do is try to talk to the Minister,” Draco said. “If my father is there, then so be it. I’ll explain that… I don’t know, me and the beast had a magical connection, or something.”
“She’s not my bloody girlfriend,” Draco scowled, starting to walk back to the common room. To his dismay, Blaise followed. “Don’t you have somewhere better to be?”
“Okay. How do you make a fist?” Draco set down his wand and showed him. “See, you can’t keep your thumb inside your fist, that’s how you break it. You keep it outside of your fist.”
“Right. Ignore that.” He let out a soft exhale as Pansy gently pulled back the hair falling onto his forehead. “He’s got an annoying voice.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “It's not the Grim,” he replied, breaking their argument up before it could go on any longer. “I'm behind on homework and Oliver is insane. Is that enough?”
So he spent weeks feeling nauseous and despondent, regretting as a day passed by and brought him closer to the inevitable loss of the match. He got no further in the dementor lessons, too constantly upset to conjure a happy memory.
“It’s weird,” Harry replied. She looked afraid to admit it, to admit how uncomfortable she was with the concept, and Harry said, “It’s okay. I get it. I think it’s weird, too.”
“There they are,” Hagrid said, and he tossed a piece of meat into the grass. It hit the ground then was lifted into the air, and bits of it began to disappear.
Draco folded the letter back up and handed it to Pansy. He didn’t know what to say. Neither did Pansy, as she was staring wide-eyed at him in frightened anticipation. “When did you get this?”
Blaise stared at him, then, slowly, ripped his essay in half. “I knew my father. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Try to be less of a dick.”
“Ow.” They turned around, Hermione’s face red, to see Pansy and Blaise approaching them in the flesh. “And here I was all eager to start this group project.” Blaise nodded at them all, and Harry got the feeling that they were all, likely, in over their heads.
“According to Mary, hiding in her basement.” Pansy grinned and took her paper back. “It’s all bull. I doubt Black is anywhere but Hogsmeade.”
“I’ll do the buttons, thank you very much,” Draco said, grabbing some of the buttons. “I don’t trust you enough to not squash them.”
They didn’t believe him, but they were willing to let it slide given the amount of people around them. They probably thought it had something to do with Sirius Black; Sirius, who was certainly somewhere near. Not the mention that the dementors, though no longer on the school grounds, were a concern. He didn’t want to pass out again and give Draco more ammunition than he already had.
Potter clenched his draw and pocketed his wand, the beetles now restored to their original form. “Stop insulting my friends, Malfoy. I don’t care how many detentions we get.”
“Bless you,” Ron said. Trelawney’s fun as an oddity to giggle at had worn off long ago, and Hermione’s outburst in class was the most worthwhile thing to have happened so far.
The Ravenclaw girl was a pretty girl named Cho Chang. She was an excellent Seeker with a good broom, but so was Harry. And he had the Firebolt.
“You think those dolts can help with anything?” Draco replied, and Ron, very much against his will, snorted with laughter. Then he looked horrified with himself. “I asked Pansy and Blaise because they’re smart. And I trust them.”
*looks around, left to right, like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction* So.... Been a while. Listen, I'm the fool for thinking I could be productive in my writing projects in a global pandemic in my senior year of college. Thanks for sticking around, y'all. Hopefully I'll be back sooner this time around, though that feels like a jinx. Until next time~
“Well, make sure they know we are.” He glared at Harry with no malice, and Harry couldn’t stop him as he went back to Hogwarts.
Guys, the support this story has been receiving means so much to me. I'm glad you guys are digging it. I hope to update again soon, but college and work and bleh. Y'all know. Until next time~
Draco turned red. “Harry.” Pansy and Blaise glanced at each other, blank faced. Draco coughed and focused back on Ron. “What happened last night?”
“We certainly will, Miss Granger,” McGonagall said, and she went outside the common room to speak with the portrait, Ron directly behind her and everyone else standing as close to the entrance as possible. “Sir Cadogan, did you let Sirius Black into the common room.”
The boggart was released, and it didn’t go much better. The screams were louder now, his grip on his wand and his voice both felt weaker, and Lupin stepped in sooner than last time. As Harry ate his chocolate, Lupin said, “It’s harder the longer you go. You were already weakened from the first time. It would be best to stop for the night.”
He held onto his first time flying as best he could through his mother’s screams and choked out, “Expecto patronum! Expecto-”
Potter shrugged. “I always woke up whenever anyone went downstairs. Sometimes my uncle would have to leave early for work.”
“He can’t,” Harry replied. In truth, he hadn’t spoken to Draco about it, but had an idea of where things would go. “His dad wouldn’t listen.”
Next was Pansy. The puppy turned into a beautiful woman with impossibly blonde hair, shimmering skin, soft red lips, long lashes, and curves in all the right placed. He heard Crabbe and Goyle gulp behind him. The woman came closer to Pansy, grinning and holding out her arms, but the closer she came the more Draco saw that her teeth were sharp and her hands were clawed. With a steely voice, Pansy said, “Riddikulus,” and the woman’s dress ripped, exposing her bra. The class roared in laughter, and Draco caught Pansy blushing as she moved to the side for his turn.
Draco made as if to say something, and Harry pushed his hand over his mouth. “He came over here, right?” Ron asked, stumbling a few feet away from where they were hiding.
McGonagall had been awoken by the commotion and was listening to Ron’s explanation. “I don’t see how he could’ve gotten into the common room,” she said. She turned to Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Harry. “Did anyone else see him?”
Lupin looked again but this time was stuck on the map. “What’s that?” he asked, his tone a cross between angry and anxious.
As the match against Slytherin drew closer, all of Hogwarts was hectic. Percy, in the spirit of his brother, asked Harry to win the match for the sake of a bet he made with his girlfriend. The week leading up to the match, McGonagall laid off a noticeable amount of homework, and Snape piled on a noticeable amount of extra work for the Gryffindors (when Harry noticed only Gryffindors got extra assignments, he turned to glare at Draco, who grinned and stuck out his tongue). Lupin gave an encouraging pep talk about Harry’s father after a private lesson, and even the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws seemed on his side. The whole school seemed to have taken a deep breath that it only promised to release after the match.
“See you in Potions,” he replied as Crabbe and Goyle looked between them, trying to find out how they could possibly fill a quote for stupid (or, more likely, what quota meant).
Automatically, Draco looked to Potter, who shrugged and left without a word. Draco swallowed and said, “What’s the matter, Professor?”
He was back in his room before he realized it, and was thankfully alone. He let out a scream and slammed his head into his pillow, his whole body hot with rage. Why didn’t anyone tell him?
“Okay.” Draco looked to the window, where he could see sunlight starting to fade in from above the lake. “I want to go back to sleep, if you don’t mind.”
The locker room was dead silent, a mixture of excitement and dread. Oliver was murmuring the same thing over and over, the same thing they all had memorized. The amount of points they had to score before Harry caught the Snitch. They had to win by 210. Sixty points. That’s all they needed.
They were all strained and tired. Ron was still mad at Draco and the Malfoys in general, Hermione was exhausted, and Harry was just tired.
