'No, not at all. I'll let you know that I am an man of language, as so I am encline to receive every word which happens to land in my ear. A flawless ear, that goes without saying.
You git. Whatever, I don't care, it will not be my fault we are reduced to a pulp when Hermione comes back.
You're Potter, your last name contains everything you are: mighty, wealthy, selfless...
No, nothing, I don't need anything thank you, everything is taken care of so quit your matchmaking business.
More like she wants you to talk to me about it.
Harry started and stopped the device. “What did you say? What-“ He dropped his sentence when he saw Draco’s annoyed face. “What is beige anyway?”
Touché. “Well, I think it’s because someone burns everything they cook.” Draco said, always wanting to have the last word.
Here you go.
It made Draco smile. “Don’t be so childish.”
Yes, evade the subject with tea-making.
Did you ask Weasley, you know, ginger, tall and your best friend?
“Classy.” Harry side glanced at Draco, he relaxed his arms, and put his right arm over Draco’s shoulders. Draco whispered “sweet” and Harry answered cockily “I know”.
You should have asked if you needed compagny.
What ? Don't you have a scathing remark?
You truly are an idiotic Griffindor.
“That my water you’re drooling into” Draco’s nose wrinkled in a mimic of disgust. Harry knew that he wasn’t that mad about it because he let him swallow two more mouthfuls without hexing him. He eyed him warily though. Harry liked that obsessive part of Draco, the one that hated germs, wanted everything to be perfect, overall, Draco’s perfectionist side was sometimes a pain and sometimes adorable. Well, in general, he was sometimes a pain and sometimes adorable, thought he would never admit to being cute. “I’m handsome, gorgeous, magnificent not a cute, fluffy animal, Potter”.
Thank you. I have to add that I like my tea with a mug and hot water, but what should I except from you, raised by muggles...
“I SAID, POTTER, CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY PUT A BEIGE ROBE ON HIM?” Draco yelled.
Sugar? Milk?
And the other years. You're a magnet for trouble Potter.
“Don’t. You’ll mess up your hair.” Harry thought that he will never understand Draco’s fixation on hair. His hair was never going to be tamed and gently lean on one side like Draco’s did.
Since the war people changed, minds are more open now.
“Hm, yes, I’ll send him an owl, pressing him to pass by at the party” Harry said, letting his thumb brush Draco’s bare shoulder, thank Merlin vest tops exist.
'Wow, I would never have thought to hear Draco Malfoy say the word amazing ! Not too plebeian for your taste ?'
Your mother kicked you out of your house.
As stubborn as ever. Well, I'm sure Pansy and Hermione will kill me the next time they see me, but I have to go. Thanks for the tea.
Fine, but he'll keep his ginger hair, and his freckles, and his lanky body.
Hermione ignored Draco, like she did most of the time, he was, after all, insufferable in the mornings. He was slouched in one of the kitchen’s table. Yes, slouched. Harry had never thought he would use this word to describe Draco Malfoy, but he was definitely not a morning person and not even a functioning person before he drank his full and dark mug of coffee. Draco simply frowned and went back to staring at the bottom of his mug.
She has poor taste, in gifts and in men.
How dare you? I would never!-do not give me that look.- Can't I experiment a little?
Draco laughed, “I’m always classy, didn’t you know that? Plus, you’re a way better match.”
But, um, aren't same-sex relationships taboo in the wizarding world?
“Hm, definitely…” Draco approved.
And that's why you don't have any decent friends.
Thank you Malfoy, that means so much to me.
“Couldn’t you bribe him?” Draco looked at Harry and saw him frowning, “or is that not a Gryffindor thing? That’s not a Gryffindor thing, right? Well, what about sending him chocolates? Or…” Draco trailed, an amused grin slowly blooming on his lips, “a signed version of
Why? Because you find it embarrassing? I heard that talking about women is what male friends do, I'm only trying to be friendly.
Do you have Earl Grey?
The one you silently agreed on.
“No, I think we weren’t talking about the same wood” Draco said with a grin.
You might have a point here. I heard the story of a wizard who did everything with his wand, not moving an inch-I think it was an article in a magazine...
“Well, at least my breakfasts are great” Harry said thinking about the numerous time he had done breakfasts for the Dursleys. He didn’t know how to feel about the fact that he was thankful to them for that, or at least glad he knew how to use a pan which wasn’t the case for his current boyfriend. Draco tried to boil eggs the other day and managed to burn then shrink the stove, even Hermione didn’t know how he did that (it was also maybe she was laughing too hard while Ron had completely given up and was silently laughing on the floor). He said he used the proper spell but as he put it: “his wand is not meant to cast such simplistic spells”. So, they (meaning: Hermione, a reluctant Ron and himself) were currently in the midst of teaching Draco all about cooking spells (with Molly’s advices), and it wasn’t pretty to see.
'Sod off Malfoy. See ? He's going to be an insufferable prick like he always has been. You can't seriously think of leaving me alone with him. For three hours !'
I'm sarcastic, there's a difference, and you would be if you had been brought up a Malfoy.
Harry looked at the moving picture of an Oliver Wood slowly turning on himself, wearing only an underwear, sighed, and admitted, “I can see your point, he is indeed handsome.”
What is cute in a Pygmy Puff?
What's not healthy is your obsession.
That means she doesn't think you need to know about it in depth.
Harry looked at Draco skeptically.
Are you physically unable to wait and shut up at the same time, or do I have to suffer through your unending complains?
I'll talk to Neville about it, maybe he could do something.
Your face is constantly on the front cover of magazine, articles are written everyday about you, your love-life has never been a secret.
I said something nice ! I was being a gentleman, of course it's a shame you're not a lady, for a wizard should always be agreable around witches, that's etiquette.
'Draco, please dear don't scowl like that, the kitchen table won't bite you.'
He's a teacher, and not even head of a house, he has next to no power, or voice. And being an active member of the fight in the war won't help him much this time.
Nice change of subject Potter, very subtle.
He's qualified for it, he went to study Herbology in South America after all.
I could be your therapist, oh, I'd be great at that, I'd love the office for sure, and sitting all day, pretending to listen to you and dropping a few comments about your hero-complex-because really, that's all it's all about-... What are you doing?
Hermione is not like that!
“So, you know him? As in you two are close?” Draco said trying to make his tone sound as neutral as possible, he definitely was not interested.
“Hm, I think I have an idea of what I’ll be wearing...” Draco grinned, got to his feet, and took Harry’s hands. “I think you could help me choose.”
“Oh wait, yes, it’s that color you hate so much”. Harry was glad he remembered it from the Ministry’s annual ball, Draco pestered Ron all the evening because “how dare he wear something so dreadful?”.
“Hello Granger, it’s also nice to see you, how has your journey been?”
“I wonder too.” Harry crossed his arms. He apologized mentally to Hermione for forcing her to see them flirt. Well, he had supported years of indirectly flirt from Ron and her, she could handle it.
“When I explain to people that I am with someone and that this someone is the savior of the Wizarding world it has more impact than saying this person is a mundane quidditch player.” Draco explained, “and it’s not like you don’t have the body of a quidditch player.” He traced the contour of Harry’s pectorals, stopping a while on his right nipple.
Potter, the war was six years ago, your love life has been nonexistent since then, how do you explain that ?
No, I'm only surprised me or Ron never realised it.
I prefer being a sugary person than a bitter person.
Draco was reading a monthly wizard fashion magazine, or something like that, Harry thought he saw the word mode on it but he wasn’t really interested in any of it. He could tell it was fascinating because Draco would nod or make a disgusted face from time to time. “Can you believe they put a beige robe on him?”
I won't be thrown to the ground and stomped on by two angry young ladies!
She doesn't mind people being fierce you know.
Thank you for the compliment. And to answer you, I don't know why she decided I needed to know about your miserable childhood among muggles.
Yes, both of them would destroy us.
Eighth year, you kept on asking Hermione if I was seeing anyone.
Will you stop being so stubborn? I'm trying to have a conversation with you, and it's hard to do when the person you're talking to is not frank.
At least I don't have a pitiful love life.
You're going to jinx it.
What would you call it then?
'Fantastic'
Nothing, I knew you'd be a sugary person.
“What? Look at him! LOOK!” Harry could have looked if Draco hadn’t shoved the magazine into his face preventing him from seeing anything.
You've been obsessed over me, now I am obsessed over you, I'm being fair.
We were Head boy and Head girl, so yes we talked, and since there wasn't much to talk about, we talked about the Wonder boy.
No, we're definitely not talking about that.
And now you're old, mature and selfless?
Like what? You mean that she has to truly love somebody to shag them, how innocent can you be.
I'm not some animal in a cage, I don't need to be set free.
So, are you answering my question or not?
They both fell silent. Harry was left with his thoughts, remembering past quidditch games and the potential quidditch career he had said no to. Would he be in the same place as Wood? He let his thumb brush the paper, blushing a little when he realized where he had brushed Wood’s picture. Sure, he liked quidditch, but he saw it more as a hobby than as a job. Now, Harry was more concerned about Draco’s fascination for Wood, he was also maybe a bit jealous.
And Pansy.
Except trying to be alive by the end of my seventh year?
I once had an elve carve my bust in marble and put in on the mantel of the chimney.
You're maybe right, but it's a gift, I can't throw it away.
“Mr Malfoy, please stop!”
“Yes,” Draco says, trying to compose himself. “She probably stumbled upon the culprit, but was able to escape.”
Draco scowls at his relaxed face. It might not be a big deal to him—although Draco isn’t sure if he’s just saying that to lessen the embarrassment—but it sure is to Draco. He doesn’t do… things like that. It was very indiscreet and foolish. And it won’t happen again.
“Don’t— Don’t stop,” Harry groans. He arches his back when he feels Malfoy slowly massaging his cheeks. He’s so close. His hand stills and his lips part when he suddenly feels Malfoy’s fingers on the tip of his length.
“Do you think…” Ron gulped. “Do you think it has anything to do with that potion?”
“Did you take everything out beforehand?”
This seems to snap him out of his stupor. His mouth twitches and his head whirls around to the far corner. To Harry’s bed.
“I’ll send you an owl later, okay?”
“Oh, well, if you insist.” He watches Potter closely as he unbuttons his shirt, revelling in the fact that Potter is unable to look at him. “Done. Your turn.”
Malfoy tilts his head, as though he’s thinking about. “No, not really.” He bends down and starts nibbling at Harry’s ear lobe. Holy… shit. “Are we allowed to do other things?”
“Are you really okay with this?” he asked.
When he hears the door close behind her, Harry finally relaxes.
Is this Potter’s idea of payback? Letting Draco sit in this mostly empty, awful pub by himself? Is this supposed to be humiliating or—Oh no. Please, NO!
Surprise flashed across McGonagall’s features. Her eyes rested on Potter as her expression slowly softened. “Potter, I think you misunderstood.” At that, Potter’s eyes snapped up to hers. “When I promised you to help you become an Auror, it was a promise to help you fulfill your dreams. Dreams change. There’s nothing wrong with that.”
“You’ve got some nerve, bringing a guy here and—”
“Well… I’m not proud of it, but I’ve had a few flings that didn’t really mean anything to me.”
“I wasn’t expecting anyone at this hour.”
Harry rolls his eyes and puts her down on the table between them. “Hmmm… maybe… err… Lettuce?”
“Hey,” Potter simply said.
“Baxter,” he called out, hoping the koala would come crawling to him from under the bed, out of the bathroom… But nothing happened.
“Fine,” he sighed.
Potter might as well just punch Draco in the gut.
“Right. And whose fault is that?”
Harry blinked, panic bubbling up inside him.
Draco rolls onto his back, stretching his arms away from him and slowly opens his eyes. He’s in Potter’s bedroom. He’s in his house. His home. He doesn’t know why it makes him feel so giddy. Maybe because it feels like Potter is finally letting him in, opening up to him. He’s so guarded these days. Much more than he used to be in school. Draco wouldn’t exactly describe himself as an open book, either, but it’s different with Potter. If only he knew Potter felt the same. Maybe he does. He took Draco past the Fidelius Charm. He let Draco spend the night. And he’s making breakfast.
Draco turned over in his sleep, cursing under his breath. He didn’t want to admit it, but it felt strange lying in bed without something curled around his midriff. Four days had passed since the Dark Mark-incident and since then, Baxter hadn’t looked at him once. Draco snorted whenever he saw the koala’s back turned to him. It could mope all it wanted. It had attacked Draco, not the other way round. Still, he had expected the koala to crawl into bed like it usually did.
“Merlin, Draco, please,” Potter groaned, “use your tongue or you fingers, I don’t care, but please—”
Draco mentally swore. What should he do now? Harry seemed to be asleep, but what if he woke up, just to find the manifestation of Draco’s excitement poking his hip? Fuck, that would be so embarrassing! He had to turn over. It would mean not lying in Harry’s arms anymore, but if that was the price he had to pay…
“Draco, you know I don’t need any grand gestures. You’re-”
“Are you—Ah! Are you getting sentimental on me, Potter?” Draco smirks. “You probably—Oh fuck! You—Ah!—You’d probably say anything right about now and—Ah!”
“Is that all?” he asked.
“What?”
“Malfoy?” Potter seemed stunned. He was holding a toothbrush and was only dressed in a green t-shirt and pants. “How did you find me?”
“Is it really that important to you?” Potter says quietly.
bumbling idiot.”
“I’m not just talking about the sex, Draco.” Potter takes a deep breath. “Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed what we were doing, but—” He hesitates. “I… don’t hate myself when I’m around you. I guess I’m too busy being annoyed at you.” His lips stretch into a weary smile.
“Just… move slowly.”
“Are you sure about that?”
“I—What? Why should I apologise? He’s the one who stormed off!”
“Well, after nobody said anything for
“Huh. Maybe you’re not going to hit me after all,” he says, feeling triumphant.
Draco resisted the urge to scowl at him. “Why? Am I not allowed to enjoy myself?”
“Come on,” Harry says again. “Live a little.”
It hit him with such force, it nearly knocked him off his feet. He had known it from the day Draco had lain beside him, softly snoring into his ear while Harry had shivered from the coldness of his feet. If it had been any other person beside him, Harry would have probably tried to slip out of bed. But with Draco, everything felt right. Harry wanted to keep him warm, be there for him… be with him.
“What?” Draco asked, taken aback. Potter seemed to consider something, but didn’t answer before lowering his head to kiss Draco’s neck again. “Oh!”
Draco felt his cheeks burn up as his eyes darted from Terry to Harry.
“You’re the only one who can save these children, Harry Potter.”
“You work too much.”
Draco snorted, which almost turned into a laugh. “Merry Christmas, Potter,” he said, before he Apparated back to the Manor.
Draco tried to keep his face impassive. “What?”
Potter leaned back again, his expression turning sombre. “I tried to stay out of your hair today,” he murmured.
“You’re the one who wanted to go flying,” Malfoy says, his tone bored.
Draco turns away, balling his hands into fists. He feels out of place, watching Potter and his friends reunite. It doesn’t exactly help that they know what’s been going on between him and Potter. It’s the Erumpent in the room, which Draco hopes everyone is going to ignore.
“Oh my god, Harry, that was scary,” Hermione wheezed.
“Ugh.” Potter rakes his fingers through his hair. “I’m not even halfway through.”
Casting silencing charms wherever he went had become an automatism at this point. After locking the bathroom door, it was the first thing he did. He had a feeling the koala wouldn’t exactly be cooperative. And, boy, was he right.
“No, I’m not going anywhere. And honestly, you should—”
in a house full of illegal potions. The nerve!”
“Still, it was… the first time. For both of us. I always thought you would have wanted to—”
he thinks darkly.
“Um…” Well, shit. He couldn’t voice any of his concerns, because they’d all expose him. “Ugh, fine,” he snapped. “But no cuddling.” He pointed his index finger at Potter, as though that would make him keep his distance.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fire,” someone yells.
It takes Harry a moment to fully understand Malfoy’s words, or at least try to interpret them correctly. Is he saying he loves Harry as well?
“Maybe that’s why I heard that voice.”
Potter nods. “Greyback killed her,” he says after a moment.
“Hmm-hmm.”
“Of course he is,” Draco mutters under his breath.
“I don’t know how to say this,” he murmurs, his voice sounding raspy, “but… can I touch you? I promise, I’ll be careful about… you know.”
“I tickled the pear,” Potter shrugs.
Harry still has no idea what possessed Malfoy to do this. Is he trying to lull Harry into a false sense of security? Because that’s definitely not going to happen. But… it does feel comforting. It’s actually better than being bombarded with a thousand questions about what he just saw and what it means. Huh. Malfoy won’t do any of those things, Harry realises. He won’t ask questions, he won’t be able to say something nasty…
The amount of relief he feels when Malfoy answers with
Malfoy lets out a seemingly involuntary laugh; the sound pulls at Harry’s heartstrings in the best way.
“Give it back!”
“I swear to Merlin, Potter, if you interrupt me now—” He took another deep breath. “I don’t think I can say what I—” He quickly looked sideways, every muscle in his body tense. For once, Potter seemed to be doing as he was told, staying silent. Drumming his fingers against his thigh, Draco braced himself for the most difficult part yet. “I didn’t think it was possible, that you could like me like that. Ever. Astoria and I, we’ve been friends for years. And even though we aren’t involved romantically, we decided getting married was the best option we had. Her family was pressuring her to find a husband and settle down, and even though my mother did no such thing, it was very much implied she was waiting for an heir. Everything was going as it was supposed to… until you stumbled into my life again.” He rubbed his fingertips against his forehead as if that would help him think. “It was different than it had been in school. Everything was suddenly… intensified. I never told Astoria how I felt about you, but, funnily enough, she already knew when I told her I wanted to call off the engagement. I guess it was more obvious than I thought.”
“You just had to lead with the backhanded compliment, didn’t you?” Draco grunts.
“Oi, Malfoy! What do you think you’re doing?” It sounds like Ron is getting out of bed. “That’s right, you bloody coward! GO AND HIDE IN THE BATHROOM!”
He tossed and turned, cursing under his breath. He was just about to get up and get himself a glass of water when he heard a hesitant knock on the door.
Draco blinks, unconsciously holding his breath.
He starts walking again and this time, he doesn’t hear any footsteps behind him.
“Harry, you don’t look so—”
“You—You said you’d kiss me once you got back,” Draco whispers. His heart rate increases when he sees the worry melt away from Potter’s face.
Malfoy huffs but gently takes her in his arms and cuddles her to his chest.
Draco makes another face and sips his coffee. There’s something bright red right in front of him. It might be some kind of vegetable. It smells absolutely horrendous; kind of… sour and… just… really smelly. The only thing that doesn’t look revolting is the sushi. Except… is there even any fish in it?
“But… he can’t talk.”
Something warm unfurls in his chest when Malfoy rubs at his eyes before he drapes his arm around Harry again. If he knew how tousled his hair is, he’d probably throw a fit. Harry thinks it’s almost endearing. Especially paired with that thing Malfoy is wearing.
Draco studied his face, but hastily looked away when Potter’s eyes locked with his.
“What—How—” Draco cringed as his headache intensified. This was just too much. What the fuck was going on here?
“Potter, what are you doing? Potter!”
“Draco… Draco.”
“I’m still here if you need me, yeah?”
There’s an ear blasting bang and it’s almost like the whole castle is shaking. Draco scrambles off the floor, getting to his knees, his eyes wide in terror. Everything is quiet for a moment, except for Draco’s frantic heartbeat, before he hears blustering screams. Fear bubbles up inside him. Something’s happened. But what?
“I don’t,” Potter said.
Draco looks at it with mild interest.
“Harry would never do something like that,” Draco announced decisively. Harry blinked at that.
The answer comes half a heartbeat too late.
“I see you’ve been keeping tabs on me.”
Draco shudders. He pushes the thought that Potter might really die this time out of his mind. He knows he won’t be able to stop Potter, but he has no idea what to say to him to make this easier. What do you say to someone who’s willing to sacrifice himself, when all you want to do is cling to him and beg him not to? Draco can’t do this. He needs help.
“Err… Professor—”
“You were leading me on!”
Draco furrows his brows. What the bloody hell is he talking about?
“Of course! Because everyone else is a bloody coward, compared to the great Harry Potter,” Draco snarls.
If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d think he’s kneeling in front of a marble sculpture. Every muscle in Malfoy’s body seems to have tensed.
“I know you had no idea it was me,” Potter said, his voice quivering. “You wouldn’t have done it if—if you had known—” He broke off, his eyes going wide, when Draco impulsively, and foolishly, covered Potter’s hand with his own. He just couldn’t bear Potter’s pain, the self-loathing that was seeping through his words. It was heartbreaking. And to Draco, it was also very relatable.
“Stop being such a prick and take off your clothes.”
He slowly turns around and tries not to show any reaction when he finds Malfoy smiling at him.
“That’s it, that’s it. Now, be still while I go and fetch some more Dittany's essence. I’m warning you, don’t move Mr Malfoy! You’ll only make it worse.”
“I made everyone keep their mouths shut,” Potter said. “I didn’t think it would work, but…” He shrugged again.
Draco grits his teeth. Damn Granger.
He feels Potter’s arse cheeks clench and to his absolute and utter horror, his cock shows interest in the movement.
“How are we supposed to work together if you won’t talk to me?”
Sweet Salazar, this can’t be happening right now.
“They seriously printed this?” Draco asked. Why hadn’t he seen these before?
Draco was too far gone to to give him a snappy retort. He was too busy catching his breath.
“Can we go now?”
Trying not to look too disappointed, Harry nods and gives Dean a smile. “Thanks, I appreciate it.” He doubts a children’s book is going to be any help, but, at this point, he’s desperate enough to clutch at every straw. It’s obvious by now that this isn’t going to go away on its own. If only he knew what’s causing the flowers to spring up and how to stop it.
It took everything in him not to thrust into Potter again. Slowly, he pulled out his cock and sat back on his heels.
“Not really,” he whispers. “I made a special exception for you, Potter.”
“It started out with a few tests,” Draco shrugs. “Similar to what they did when I was on trial. Only this time, it was off the record.”
“The two of us?” Harry couldn’t imagine a scenario in which he and Malfoy could be referred to as ‘the two of you’. All he and Malfoy ever did was fight. Or ignore each other. Well, pretend to ignore each other would probably be more accurate.
“What?”
“Let him go,” Harry hears himself say. Voldemort lets out another high-pitched laugh, tightening his grip on Draco’s throat.
Potter suddenly looks torn. “They weren’t. And I thought you changed, but—”
Draco frowned at her. She sounded like it was a big deal. “Of course I—” He paused. Wait. He had noticed something strange about that, hadn’t he? When Potter had brought him breakfast, when they had been at the restaurant and at Potter’s flat… he had barely eaten anything. He had looked tortured and uncomfortable. “Luna,” he said, his tone suddenly urgent. “Is there something wrong with him?”
Draco clears his throat and quickly withdraws his hand from around Potter’s body.
There’s no answer.
Malfoy presses his lips into a tight line. That’s all the answer Harry needs. He wonders what else Malfoy wanted to know about him and he feels the corners of his mouth curving upward.
“Are you really telling the truth?” Teddy asked, sceptically.
“How do I look at him?”
Draco purses his lips, trying to think of something. He gives Potter a lopsided grin before he pulls out his wand and points it at the grass.
“That’s rubbish.” Harry knows he can’t change Draco’s mind when he’s in this mood. They had talked about this a lot. Draco still felt guilty about his role in the war. If the roles were reversed, Harry would probably feel the same. Draco had gaped at him when Harry had said this to him one night.
“Care to find out if the rest of me is as soft?” Harry asked, his lips stretched into a grin. His heart thundered against his chest as Malfoy gave him a lopsided grin in return.
“That great, huh?”
“I HATE YOU!”
, he reminds himself, grimly.
“You know what, you’re the disgusting one, Potter! You disgust me!”
Draco makes a face. “That’s not what I mean. It’s just… At that point, I didn’t understand how you weren’t disgusted by me.” Draco sounds like he still doesn’t understand.
“Merlin, this is so wrong,” Potter mutters.
Draco’s mouth twitched, in spite of himself. Damn it! Why was Potter’s smile so infectious?
“Well, we can always make up for it today if you’re in the mood for it,” Draco said evenly. At this point, Harry was pretty sure he was hallucinating. “I won’t be mad if you’re not,” Draco continued. “I understand. But…”
Harry coughs again and clumsily rubs his eyes. He wants to complain when Malfoy seizes his arm and gruffly pulls him up, but he starts walking so fast, it leaves him breathless. Malfoy pulls him into a room and slams the door shut behind them. Harry doesn’t dare utter another word. Malfoy seems livid. He hears something squeak and then… splashing.
“Well, that was more than two years ago. People change.”
“Clearly, it was a mistake. Trust me, it won’t happen again.”
“You really shouldn’t encourage his OCD.”
“Good luck with that,” Weasley mumbled.
Harry’s cheeks slowly but surely heat up as his mind, unhelpfully, provides him with images of Malfoy naked, with a faceless girl sprawled beneath him. Ugh. Also, it’s been over an hour. How long can he go?
“Can I try adding another? I think you’re ready.”
Draco moves his brows, silently indicating he’ll need a better explanation than that.
Draco grits his teeth at the blatant insult. It doesn’t matter that he technically agrees. Being shagged by Potter. Ugh. Or worse. Him, shagging Potter! Merlin!
“Yes, what is it, Harry?”
Suddenly, it’s very hard to breathe. It’s hard to stay upright.
“They taste fantastic,” Harry said, pulling the kids into another hug. “Thank you.” He caught sight of Draco watching them, understanding and sympathy written all over his face.
He can’t talk to Malfoy, he can’t talk to Ron, he can’t help Dumbledore with the horcruxes…
“Oh god, do it, do it!”
“Are you that much of a chicken?” Draco smirks.
“WHAT?” Harry blurts, feeling an uncomfortable prickle in his throat.
“I noticed,” Draco said curtly. “You could have just told them to leave you alone.”
“Showoff,” Draco mutters as his fingers curl around the mug. Potter doing wandless magic is one of the sexiest things ever and the problem with that is, Potter hardly ever uses his wand anymore. Which means Draco is sporting a hard-on almost all the time when he’s around Potter. Well, that’s not entirely true. Just thinking about him is enough. But who can blame him? Anyone in their right mind would feel the same as soon as they lay eyes on that toned body. Not to mention his irritatingly cute puppy dog eyes and his hot, hot arse.
“Yes,” Draco grumbles, the same moment Potter practically yells, “No!”
“Professor,” Potter begins, stepping closer to the portrait. “Do you know anything about this?”
Potter shifts in his seat. His face is unreadable.
“What’s that?” Harry asks.
Mentally hexing his friends, he let Pansy grab his arm and Apparate them. She didn’t even wait for him to catch his balance before she dragged him into… Where were they? Ah, a pub, it seemed. It was already crowded, which Draco detested. There were no more empty tables. But Pansy didn’t seemed to be bothered by that. She walked straight up to a table in the corner, pulling Draco along with her. Everything happened so fast, he had no time to protest. He did, however, raise a confused eyebrow when he saw dirty blond curls and a warm smile.
“A tent, sleeping bags and… I’m actually not sure what else is in there. I was in a hurry.”
“Are you feeling okay?” Potter asks, propping himself up on his elbows.
Draco grits his teeth, his eyes narrowed into slits. “This,” he takes a threatening step forward, “happens to be my favourite book.”
“So…” He exhales loudly. “I’ve had sex with them, but they never—I never—” Potter bites his lip again as his eyes find Draco’s.
Hermione bit her lip and put a hand on his shoulder.
it’s not like that. But the greater the possibility of Malfoy being forced into becoming a Death Eater becomes in Harry’s head, the more disgusted he feels with himself. He never should have used that spell on Malfoy. No matter how he looks at it, it always comes down to this.
“It is very peculiar. I have never heard of such a thing. Mr Weasley didn’t respond to anything, you say, Poppy?”
“I can’t change who I am,” Draco retorts. “We’d both have to… make sacrifices.” Draco’s face twists in disgust at his own words. “Which is why I think it would be better if—
Draco screws up his already swollen eyes. The tears won’t stop. There’s a strange sound filling the room, but Draco only registers deep in the back of his mind that it’s coming from him.
Harry hated the way Malfoy’s eyes gleamed as he looked at him, the way his smirk was crooked, his stupid white teeth and his hair… his hair that had felt so soft when Harry had touched the back of Malfoy’s neck.
Seeing himself lying on the ground, eyes torn open and face grotesque, leaves Harry stunned. He watches his own head sway from side to side while Draco keeps shaking him, sobbing helplessly. Harry still doesn’t understand what the hell is going on. Is this some kind of premonition?
Draco’s laughter instantly died in his throat. Somehow, he felt caught. He usually wasn’t like this; he didn’t let people in that easily.
The koala didn’t budge.
“You truly are a spoilt brat,” Potter grunts as he pops some cheese into his mouth.
“I—I—” Potter gulped. “I don’t remember anything.”
“Yes! Oh god, y—Oh my god, what is that?”
“I’d swallow them all, distracting you with my mouth. Merlin, I really,
“In the chairs?” Harry can already feel the ache in his back just at the thought. “Malfoy.” He rubs at his eyes again. “The last thing we need is being tetchy because we couldn’t get enough sleep. Just get in the fucking bed.”
“It is not to be seen, but to be observed with the mind.”
“It didn’t. Not even nearly. You really need to get over it.”
“Of course.”
“Um, Lupin. And your godfather.”
Draco can only stare at him. Did Potter just make him believe all his dreams came true, only to crush them in under a minute?
“I’m so glad you find this amusing,” Malfoy says dryly.
“Potter?”
Ah, this must be what it feels like to be petrified. The feeling only intensifies when Potter moves closer. Oh Merlin, he’s going to do it. He’s going to kiss Draco. He’s going to… pull him into another hug?
Harry balls his hands into fists. What is Malfoy playing at?
Harry ignored them and got out of his seat, never taking his eyes off Draco. He pulled the Slytherin into a standing position in front of him and gently cupped his cheek.
“That’s what I’m trying to find out.” Draco pauses, trying to gather his thoughts. “I just—I noticed a few odd things lately.”
The words ring in Draco’s ear, as though he used a Sonorous Charm.
Not being completely sure what’s happening but not wanting to blow a potential chance, in case he has been utterly wrong about him, Harry quickly crawls backwards on the bed, making space. Malfoy only hesitates for another second before he slips under the covers, next to Harry. As if that isn’t surprising enough, Malfoy moves closer, takes Harry’s hands in both of his and puts them between their faces. Harry lies there, stunned, as the gush of Malfoy’s warm breath pleasantly caresses his fingers. He has no idea what’s going on or what came over Malfoy, but this is even better than what Harry planned to do. And, as confusing as this turn of events might be, he decides not to push it right now and forces himself to relax. He tentatively moves his fingers, his fingertips brushing against Malfoy’s skin. He almost smiles when the other boy does the same.
“Thanks for dinner,” he said with a little smile. Draco just nodded. They were still very awkward around each other, but that was to be expected.
“I’m sorry,” he said, trying to sound earnest. “I should have warned you that something like this might happen.”
“WHAT?”
Korean,” Potter shrugs, as though it should be the most obvious thing in the world.
Harry opens his mouth and Malfoy loses no time in slipping his tongue inside. Harry pushes back with his own, releasing an enormous swarm of butterflies inside his stomach. More than once, their teeth clash against each other; it only encourages Harry to yank harder at Malfoy’s hair, to brush his tongue more firmly against Malfoy’s, to step closer so there’s absolutely no room left between them.
He can’t believe they just did that. What the fuck.
“I told her we hadn’t murdered each other and that should count for something.”
He had ruined everything.
“What?”
“We already are, Draco,” Harry smiled.
For a moment, Draco considers just staying on the ground. His entire body aches. He can still feel Potter inside of him. He chokes.
“It, err, can be quite painful,” Potter mutters, “not to finish.”
“I love you,” Harry whispers.
“Shut up, Pansy.”
Potter sips at his coffee and, to Draco’s horror, has the audacity to grin.
could have died that day.” He paused, trying to gather up the courage to say the next words without sounding like he was being chased by a Dementor. “That… was the first time I realised I had feelings for you.”
Draco felt his left eye twitch before his brain finally provided him with the basics of how walking and sitting down worked. He watched Luna warily as she thanked the waitress and took a sip of her lemonade. Never taking his eyes off her, Draco discreetly cast a
One tap. No.
“This is unacceptable,” Malfoy mutters for the umpteenth time.
“Yes, Potter, I know,” Draco says through gritted teeth. “The girl was frantic. If I had pushed her any more, she—”
“How the hell should I know?” Draco retorted.
“You want to know where I’m taking her, don’t you?”
Harry rolled his shoulders experimentally and regretted it as soon as the pain of his clenched muscles shot through him. His arms were heavy and holding his head up became more difficult with every passing second. He was simply exhausted. He dragged his feet across the floor, not caring about the mud on his shoes. He almost collapsed when he reached the stairs; he couldn’t go up.  He could barely move!
“Draco—”
“Oh thank Merlin,” Professor Sprout exclaims, clasping her hands together.
Dear Merlin. This boy lost two people he was close to. No wonder he’s such a mess.
“Err, I—”
“Or is there someone else here I should know about?”
Harry licked his lips.
Harry immediately wants to deny it; he doesn’t want to, not in a million years, but his mind unhelpfully starts murmuring at him, asking him if he ever uttered a more blatant lie.
“Malfoy! No more talking of your arse!”
He feels his muscles contract as stars explode in front of his eyes. Without realising what he’s doing, his hand dips into Potter’s hair, grabbing it as heat spreads through him.
While Harry can’t disagree, he’s getting really tired of hearing those words. He knows he fucked up. Big time. He’s glad Hermione isn’t here or he’d never hear the end of it.
The way they interacted with each other now was so comfortable and sweet (minus the occasional fighting), Draco was genuinely happy with how things were. It almost felt like they were a couple. A couple nobody knew about…
He is.
Draco leans forward and sniffs at it warily. It doesn’t smell too bad. He carefully opens his mouth and takes the whole roll from Potter’s chopsticks. He chews as slowly as possible, expecting to be hit by weird tastes at any second. Ew, there it is. The pickled radish. It has to be. It’s… weirdly sweet. But… the weirdest part is… it’s not as horrible as Draco thought. It actually goes quite well with the omelette, which must contain at least one pound of salt. It’s extremely weird. But also… kind of tasty.
Draco experimentally loosened his grip on Potter’s waist, only to find that Potter really couldn’t stand on his own.
Bringing himself into a more comfortable position, he pats his thigh, indicating that Potter should sit on his lap.
This was inspired by... well, me being one of the people who are still not over the fact that *that* scene didn't make it into the movies :D AND there's also
Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest. Now he definitely knew something was up.
Draco nodded again. It was ridiculous, really, that Potter had the ability to render him speechless like that. He watched Potter as he took a pinch of floo powder and stepped into the fireplace.
Draco grits his teeth, his own words out of Potter’s mouth punching him right in the gut.
“Since when do you worry so much about my education?” Harry snorts.
“Excuse me?” Draco’s jaw drops to the ground and he feels himself panic as a murmur goes through the crowd.
“You should hire more people who work
“Why do we have to be naked, though?”
Slowly, Draco removes his finger from Potter’s arse. He places his now free hand on the mattress and tries to calm himself.
“You asked,” Potter shrugged.
“Honestly, they’re too dense to notice anything, really.”
“Ugh, I hate this,” he repeats, a little louder this time. “We should at least be allowed to go outside. I don’t know why Madam Pomfrey insists we stay in here. We’re basically trapped. I feel like I’m suffocating.”
Draco narrows his eyes. “And you don’t find it the tiniest bit weird that he can’t seem to remember her name? I got the impression he doesn’t even care.”
Draco can visualise it perfectly.
“Hold on, the Basilisk? There was a Basilisk? Here?”
“I mean,” Potter looks utterly uncomfortable. “Is anybody truly happy?”
“No, no, Kreacher, stop!” Draco bends down and helps Kreacher up. “Don’t do that!”
“Would it help if I told you I think about you all the time, too?” Harry said, hesitantly.
“It took everything in me not to jump you when you showed up on my doorstep.” His fingers slide down to Harry’s collarbone.
Without waiting for him to agree, Draco takes the lead and starts twirling them across the grass.
Harry mentally snaps at himself. Deep down, he knows he’s being irrational, but that seems to be a common theme whenever it comes to Malfoy. Not wanting to ponder on this anymore and burning for answers, he makes a snap decision.
“What?”
Harry’s words echo through the room as he tries to regain his composure and prays he didn’t wake the Dursleys.
Potter hummed and started to draw circles around his nipple with his tongue. No matter how often Draco had touched himself, it had never felt anything like this. When Potter moved to the other side, to continue his blissful torture, Draco couldn’t help but gasp.
“Your Patronus said to come find you.”
“Are you going to eat that?”
“This…” He took another step forward. “Did you charm the ceiling?”
“What— Did I do something?” Potter asks. He sounds genuinely worried. “Did I hurt you? Do you not like it when someone touches… your… arm…”
“Weirdly enough, I don’t feel that bad about you not having to dance half naked in front of strangers anymore.”
“I told you to
“Draco!”
“It’s not a compliment at all,” Potter rectifies. “It’s simply a fact.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asks carefully.
Draco tried to stifle the laugh that was threatening to leave his throat. “Be grateful it didn’t do worse,” he said, trying to keep his face impassive.
“There isn’t really an ancient house-elf—”
“Well, I guess if we were in the Muggle world, we would err… go out and eat ice cream or… go to an amusement park or something.”
“Hey, where are you going?” he asks when Ron gets out of his seat. “Don’t leave me alone with all these books.”
“Don’t touch anything,” he hisses.
“The report won’t be writing itself,” Draco says. He has a feeling Granger noticed that he evaded her question. Even Weasley might have, with the way he’s looking at him.
Half an hour later, Penny is still playing with her Galleon while Harry and Malfoy both stare at the ceiling.
“Don’t twist my words, Malfoy.”
“Malfoy. Malfoy, wake up.”
“What did you put in there?” Draco asks, scrunching up his nose.
“A simple antidote. It should reverse whatever spell was cast on you.”
“Were you going to marry him, too?” Draco scoffed. “Out of spite? Do you still have to beat me at every—”
“What?”
Draco gave him a lopsided smile and let his hand travel up to his neck where he buried it in his untamable hair. He wasn’t sure if he should be worried about the fact that these kind of revelations didn’t seem as scary anymore and felt much more comfortable on his lips.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been lying there when he hears the door creak open. He turns to see Potter approaching him. His frown wrinkles are on full display and—
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Draco gripping his wand a little tighter. Afraid to look at his expression, Harry keeps his eyes there.
Draco nods, already in too much pain to talk, and follows Potter stiffly.
“Because,” Harry starts, without knowing how to continue.
“Ugh, I hope not! I have no idea,” Potter groaned and hid his face in the crook of Draco’s neck. His face emerged again with a scowl when Draco burst out laughing, his entire body shaking.
“Does everyone know?” Harry asks, throwing his hands in the air in exasperation.
“Draco?”
“That’s not what I’m doing. I’m trying to survive.”
“Potter,” he exclaimed indignantly. “What the fuck are you doing?”
“Love without hope is a rather cruel concept, don’t you think?”
“Tell me why you’re getting rid of all this stuff,” he whispers. Malfoy shudders and his eyes flick to Harry’s lips. His breathing is heavy and Harry faintly feels his pulse racing, as he moves his finger down Malfoy’s neck.
“How is this—Oh!” Draco’s hands curl around Potter’s hips to keep himself from falling over.
Her brows furrowed as she looked down at her hands. She wrapped one around the other, slowly lifting one finger… two fingers… three fingers… When she lifted the fourth, she looked at Draco in silent uncertainty. He smiled at her, patting her head, and nodded. Still tear-stained, but now beaming, she turned to Potter and showed him her hand.
“Take a seat, I’ll be there in a sec,” Potter says. Draco gives him a look in mock scepticism but follows his floating plate to the table. He puts down his mug and inspects the pancakes while a few frozen raspberries come flying out of the freezer and place themselves around the pancakes. They don’t look so bad. But food can still taste horrible, even if it looks okay. Draco should know. He’s running out of excuses on why he can’t come over to Pansy’s for dinner. Apparently, she’s discovered her love for cooking. Unfortunately, she’s not as talented as she thinks she is.
“Yeh look a lil pale. Are yeh alright?”
So Harry tries to let go of his remaining apprehension as Malfoy leans down and kisses him again, gently at first, lips softly brushing against each other, before his mouth moves with more urgency and he pins Harry down with his full body weight. Harry’s hands move without him noticing, up Malfoy’s back, into his hair. He can smell the roses they’re lying on, fresh and sweet and full of promise. Something about it makes Harry’s heart ache and he’s gripped by the sudden urge to let Malfoy know. Malfoy needs to know. And maybe Harry needs to hear himself say it as well.
“Gloat all you want. It’s the only thing you’re ever going to beat me at.”
“Hmmm,” Malfoy smirks. “Should we call it a night, then?”
Harry gulps, overwhelmed by the prickling on his scalp and the vehemence of his heartbeat.
“Yeah. I haven’t seen you like that in a while.”
“I like it here,” Potter whispered, and for a second, Draco wasn’t sure if he had heard him correctly. “I never thought I would say this, after everything that happened here.” He let out a humourless laugh. “But all that stuff you told me… I realised there are a lot of things I didn’t know about you. I think I understand it better now. You know, you becoming a Death Eater and… everything.”
“You know, I think there is something that might, err, keep me from, err—”
“And you’re still shaking.”
“Something bothering you, Malfoy?” Harry asks. His voice sounds much more condescending than he intended. But he can’t help it. He’s irritated. “How about you mind your own bloody business?” he snaps. He grits his teeth, imagining what Malfoy would be saying to him right now.
Harry chuckles. “I guess she’s attracted to it because it’s so shiny. Like gold.”
“Nothing,” Draco says evenly. “But… she knows something.”
Potter squirms beneath him. “It’s, um, it’s been a while since I’ve let anyone do this to me.”
“At least I can tell you want that.”
“Malfoy!” Harry ducks as sparks explode around him and several logs fly through the air before they plop back on the ground, scattered around them. “What the fuck!”
“Because he’s insecure,” Luna says.
“But—But that’s—”
“It’s an antidote,” Malfoy repeats and lets his hands slide down Harry’s chest. “I brewed it myself.”
“Come on,” he whispers. “Do it. I dare you.”
Oh no.
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Granger, he—”
Teddy’s frown slowly but surely disappeared from his face and was replaced by a look of wonder and uncertainty. Draco watched him as he studied Potter, his mind undoubtedly reeling.
“Oh?” Potter said. He sounded far too cocky. “Why then?”
“What were you thinking?” he said quietly, hoping it would encourage Potter to finally say it.
“Merlin, you’re such a heathen, Potter.”
“Don’t get any ideas, Potter,” Draco drawls. “I’m not going to be your house-elf.”
“I can’t have a partner who’s mentally unstable.”
“Could you be any more vague?” Harry clamps his mouth shut when Hermione narrows her eyes.
“Um, excuse me, everybody thinks I’m adorable.”
And suddenly, something occurs to him.
Internally grumbling, he jumps out of his seat. Before he even reaches the stairs, however, he feels a hand on his shoulder.
“I—I’m sorry,” Harry mumbles.
“This isn’t—Ugh! Listen to yourself! Not everything is your fault!”
“I’m sorry, was I supposed to get your permission first?” Draco quipped. His heart skipped a beat when he saw how flustered Potter suddenly was.
“I see.” Draco gave him a suspicious glance while Potter went back to studying the bottle in his hands. Did that mean he hadn’t seen their picture? Some of his friends must have shown him at least. But he hadn’t brought it up yet, which made Draco even more uncomfortable than if he had been teased about it. Ugh, the prat was so bloody irritating!
Why had he wasted so much time hating Harry? It hadn't been how he really felt.
“Me too,” Weasley chuckles. “Merlin, it’s so good to be out of the house.”
“I was trying to solve the case,” Draco snaps.
“Harry, my boy.”
“Don’t—Don’t stop,” he wheezes.
“Hey, Draco?”
Basically, he only knows what Malfoy lets him see. There could be so much more Harry has no clue about. And that’s not all. There are a few other things that keep bugging him. For example, why had Malfoy been talking to Myrtle of all people? Why not talk to one of his cronies, who are probably next in line to become Death Eaters?
“What?
After Ginny finished her lecture, Harry tried to convince her to take over as Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team in their final match against Ravenclaw. She would have to play Seeker, and Dean would have to rejoin the team, replacing Ginny as Chaser. She was reluctant at first but, in the end, she agreed.
“Should I—”
“And… you’re worried it’s not you?”
“Seriously?” Harry yells and starts flailing around. He hits Malfoy twice, although he doesn’t know where. He grunts when the Slytherin tackles him and shoves him against a wall, right under the running water.
“To do what?”
“The Headmistress wants to see you in her office.”
“That reminds me,” Draco said, “we have a little surprise for you.”
Feeling himself panicking, he shuts the book and jumps to his feet. And Dean thought this would help? This is… No, it can’t be. He’ll find a way to fight this.
Malfoy slowly nods, a tiny smirk forming on his lips. “Right. Glad we cleared that up.” He turns back to the telly, completely ignorant of the thunderstorm that’s raging inside of Harry. Holy fuck. What is going on?
Um. What?
“I did find it. And now I need your help.” He lowers his voice, suspecting Malfoy is trying to listen in. “I need permission to go to the Restricted Section.”
“That’s the last thing I want,” Draco snarls. “It’s the truth. Potter doesn’t need me.”
“Get off me!” He toppled over backwards, the koala sitting on his face, practically smothering him.
“Um, Professor?” Harry says, turning to face Slughorn. “Where’s Professor Dumbledore?”
“What— What are you doing here?” Draco asked. He watched as Potter’s eyes quickly darted down his body and back up, his mouth falling open.
“Please shut up.”
“Oh please, we both know—”
Harry turns to Hermione, who’s sitting on the edge of the bed. Her quiet sobs fill the entire hospital wing.
“What—What other things?”
“Interesting, isn’t it?” Firenze says. “How easily the hardship we carry with us can be revealed.”
Draco felt himself blush. "Like what?” he snapped.
Shit. “I want it now,” Draco corrects.
“You don’t even know for sure?” Draco yells. “Potter, no.” He turns to him with pleading eyes. “Don’t do this.”
“Shut up, Blaise.”
“Forbidden,” Harry repeated dumbstruck. “You mean to say…”
Clearly, Potter had planned this all along, since he seemed to have made reservations at the Muggle restaurant he had hauled Draco to. The only question was: Why? He didn’t seem particularly hungry now, pushing his steak from left to right on his plate, instead of eating it.
“It’s not your fault, Jacob,” Draco says. “It doesn’t sound like you could have done anything.”
Malfoy had sobbed.
Potter moves and Draco fights the urge to cling on to him, to keep him in place. He doesn’t want this moment to end, afraid of facing reality again. When Potter slowly starts undressing, Draco is suddenly very certain he’s actually dreaming. Of course he is. That makes so much more sense. He watches Potter push down his bottoms, with his mouth hanging open.
Draco could feel the disbelief and gratitude radiating from Potter; he wondered if Potter even realised what his magic was doing right now, seeping into Draco. It felt so intimate.
He spots the Pensieve on the desk, the vial he gave Harry months ago, sitting beside it.
“I know what it is,” Draco snapped. He took a sip of his coffee and slammed the cup back down on the saucer.
“You know what, fine! I’ll go then!” He threw back the duvet in a rather unnecessarily dramatic manner and swung his legs over the edge of the mattress. Draco watched him as he pushed himself into a standing position. “Oh.” Before he could even take one step, his knees gave way and he tumbled onto the floor.
Malfoy nods, his gaze wandering back to the fire. “How are Granger and Weasley?”
“So… what exactly are you teaching them?”
“Now we cast the spell. But we have to do a dance as well.”
He can’t help but notice the grotesque irony of the situation. A few days ago, the roles were reversed. Malfoy was the one to comfort him in the aftermath of what Harry had seen in Voldemort’s mind. He remembers how it felt when Malfoy touched his hand for the first time. It was such a simple gesture and yet, it unleashed so much in Harry.
“Miss Brown, are you alright?”
“Ooooh, what do we have here?”
“How can you be so calm about this?” Potter demands.
“What are you talking about? And who’s ‘all of us’?”
“Potter, just because she likes lettuce, doesn’t mean you should name her that.”
Draco wants to slap the smugness right off his face.
Draco wants to storm inside and punch Potter in the face.
“You are such a sap,” Draco mutters, a smile tugging on his lips.
It’s frustrating, being trapped in the stupid hospital wing. He can’t move things forward with Ginny, he can’t help Dumbledore… he can’t do anything for Merlin’s sake! He made a bloody mess for himself. No, not just for himself. He dragged Ron down with him. And as relieved as Harry is that Malfoy is incapacitated, he still can’t shake the feeling of guilt that bubbles up inside him every time Madam Pomfrey checks on Malfoy’s wounds and comments on them. Apparently they’re mostly healed, but now Madam Pomfrey worries about the scarring.
“I didn’t break up with Astoria because of you,” Draco said, very aware that he sounded like a stubborn child.
“Jacob?” Potter looks around the room for a response.
“So,” Malfoy says, turning around to Harry. “Want to find out how loud I can make you scream?”
“Yes, well, and whose fault is that?” he snapped. “Thanks to you, showing up here completely unannounced, I didn’t have time to get dressed. Properly,” he added, hastily. Potter didn’t need to know he wasn’t wearing anything underneath. “Which brings us back to my question, Potter. What are you doing here?”
Draco just stared at him. He couldn’t possibly mean that. Could he?
“What suspicions?” Potter asks.
“I’m just saying,” Draco says with another shrug.
“Let’s do it tomorrow,” Potter sighs. “It’s getting dark and we’re both tired.”
Draco shudders as his heart gives a painful squeeze. How is he supposed to let Potter go now? What if he never sees him again?
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. After a moment, he turned and walked to the edge of the balcony, resting his elbows against the railing.
The second he stepped out of the Headmistress’ fireplace, his eyes fell to Dumbledore’s portrait. It was empty, for which Draco was eternally grateful. One awkward conversation was more than enough.
Malfoy starts kneading his shoulders, his neck, with a huff.
Still, Draco cringes a little when Potter whimpers again. It sounds like he’s having a nightmare. Draco has some experience in that particular field. He wonders if Potter ever dreams of the Dark Lord as well. Is he dreaming of him right now? Even if he is, it can’t be as bad as Draco’s dreams. Not after what he saw the Dark Lord do to all those people. Wizards and Muggles alike. He tortured a witch because she hadn’t wanted to pledge her eternal allegiance to him by killing her father, a Muggle.
Draco glowers at him, wondering why the fuck he brought them here of all places. He can’t even Apparate.
Potter jerks and keeps struggling against the branches.
Draco struggled to free one of his hands and ran it across Potter’s cheek. “So are you,” he whispered. Before Potter could say anything else, he pulled him back into a scorching kiss.
“Alright,” Professor Sprout sighs. “I trust your judgement. But I don’t think you need my permission. You’re not underage anymore.”
“What?” Malfoy asks, apparently having caught the apprehension on Harry’s face.
Taking a shower normally relaxes him, but when he walks into his and Harry’s bedroom, his muscles are still tense and the scowl still won’t leave his face. The crease between his brows deepens even more when he sees something odd on his bedside table. That bouquet of peonies wasn’t there before. When he hears Harry enter the bedroom, Draco doesn’t turn around.
Pansy flinched. Clearly, she had no idea what she was supposed to say in response to that. Perhaps, had they been friends, she might have been there after it happened to comfort him. Perhaps, if he’d been better at caring and understanding people rather than using and manipulating them, he wouldn’t have been left hiding behind Crabbe and Goyle, as though they could possibly shield him from the world and his own stupid mistakes.
‘I hope it’s enough,’ Draco asserted. ‘What good is cleaning out all the corruption if the laws don’t change?’
But also, he really needed to get Harry a decent moisturiser. The cold had made his skin chapped and although the room was only lit by a couple of candles, Draco just knew if he looked closely, he’d see evidence Harry was skimping on his skincare routine. The fact he’d never had one before always alarmed Draco. Also made him slightly jealous, because there was no way he could have gone through puberty looking as effortlessly handsome as Harry had managed – the man had the mildest case of acne ever, the lucky prat.
He wanted no attention for this, wasn’t about to start spouting about how his father would hear about it. If he was lucky his father would never hear word of what had happened. He didn’t think he’d be so lucky as to avoid the entire school seeming to know about it all. Nothing stayed secret at Hogwarts for long and a rather public duel between an ex-Death Eater and three seventh years in broad daylight, in the middle of a corridor, wasn’t going to go without comment.
‘You don’t have the attention to detail needed to hold that kind of spell.’
‘The compulsion charm is old – twenty years, perhaps?’ Draco studied what he was seeing, cast another spell, his frown deepening. ‘There are other spells here too.’ He turned away from the portrait and looked at the other paintings. ‘Why aren’t any of them speaking? None of them look empty either.’
They sat in (shockingly) companionable silence for a while before Draco said, ‘I’m sorry for treating you the way I did growing up.’
‘I don’t know that any of us will be sleeping tonight.’
Over the weekend, he locked himself away in his dormitory, not even venturing out for food or library books. He chose instead to send Kreacher for what he needed. The house elf responded well to Draco, much better than he ever did Harry and Draco didn’t mind taking advantage of that fact if it meant he could have a weekend of peace where he didn’t have to watch his back.
They fell into a comfortable silence as they made their way up the road toward the castle. Hermione was content to walk beside him in the quiet, but she could tell he had something on his mind that he was working toward bringing up.
‘I think I’ll let you figure it out.’ Draco took a bite of toast and deliberately changed the subject.
Draco ignored Luna’s, ‘I usually am,’ and looked over at him. Apparently, instead of getting dressed, Harry had been staring at Draco as he pulled on his clothes. Not something Draco was opposed to, but Harry really needed to work on his timing. There wasn’t really time to act on Harry’s heated gaze and with Luna sprawled on the bed there wasn’t any privacy either.
That probably would have been the end of the conversation if Hermione hadn’t slipped into the spot beside Ron and questioned, ‘You don’t have access to your money? How have you been buying things?’
He looked to Harry, helpless to explain anything to her when all he could speak was hisses of Parseltongue and stilted hand motions of WSL (which Hermione “hadn’t the time to learn”).
Draco had only managed to grunt in acknowledgment of Bill’s words, somehow managing to convey a desire for an explanation while trying not to end up cursed. He liked his fingers exactly where they were and didn’t fancy having to allow Pomfrey or Bill to reattach them. It might have been a mild curse he’d been set to dismantle but he was struggling to use the new diagnostic spell Bill was teaching him because it required so much attention to detail in a type of magic Draco had never used before.
His old bodyguard should have been in Azkaban. He’d been a willing participant in so many of the horrible things the Carrows had been up to in that last year. He and Crabbe had both taken pleasure in the things they were learning; in the new ways they could cause pain and suffering. It was only the backfiring of a spell that had saved him. It was only his own stupidity that had him attempting a spell he’d never had the brains to even contemplate before. One he’d never have tried before the Carrows and Voldemort made him think it was okay.
Sixth year had happened and then he’d spent seventh year trapped in the Manor with Voldemort and so many Death Eaters that it had taken those months of Harry’s friendship after the war for him to realise the basic attraction had flared dramatically until it had somehow, almost without his notice, become a raging inferno of attraction and
‘But that’s not true!’ she insisted. ‘Harry had plenty of people in his life who cared about him.’
Luna gave him a soft knowing smile. ‘Professor McGonagall asked me to help interpret when Astoria needs it. She said St Mungo’s can’t do anything more for her and she wants to return. McGonagall said she wants things to be normal again.’
He failed.
‘We’re bloody well going to try,’ Marigold snarled. She added a few things under her breath, again in Tamil, although this time Harry suspected she was wishing she could cause bodily harm to the Carrows. He did hear something he thought might have been about necromancy and he had to laugh.
Growling in frustration, Draco made a sharp movement with his wand and then tried again but whatever he was hoping to achieve, it wasn’t working. The words flowing from his lips were a fast murmur, almost a plea but they didn’t seem to be having any sort of effect on of the ward.
And speaking of Hogwarts, ‘Can we talk about that letter you got, now?’ Harry questioned softly.
Harry reached across the table to take Hermione’s hand and squeezed it reassuringly. ‘You don’t need to explain. I don’t blame you for saying yes and wanting to hear him out. I never meant for my relationship with Draco to come between the two of you.’
‘You’ve lost one of my moons,’ she told him mournfully and he tried not to shiver at the feel of her fingers tracing over freshly healed skin. ‘And the tip of an antler.’
They were lucky Draco had left them jinxed and spelled. He could so easily have left them dead.
Changing the direction of the conversation rather than think on
Ron ran away. Then he came back.
This time, Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head. ‘It’s easier to be brave now,’ he explained truthfully. ‘You give me a reason to be brave.’
She imagined it was harder now when he saw Harry with Draco who was possibly richer and just as good looking and even if his fame was more infamy, he was still rich and famous and powerful. He was Harry’s equal in ways she and Ron could never be (that she at least never wanted to be), and she could only imagine how that made Ron feel. Ron who had struggled to see beyond his second-hand clothes and his attitude that everything he owned was “rubbish”. Ron who struggled with being stood in Harry’s shadow even when Harry never cast him there.
They’d never found the time and Harry has stopped wanting to. He hasn’t stopped to think maybe Ginny was still waiting.
‘What?’ he asked, voice thick with the promise of sleep. He shook his head slightly to force the edges of sleep away in order to give Harry his full attention.
He started to shake his head but finally remembered how terrible an idea that was and settled for voicing his disagreement instead. ‘Can’t. Waiting on Fleur.’
There was a tiny part of Draco that wanted to interrupt with a crack about Harry’s orientation having more to do with him than any particular awareness of either sex but Ginny would likely have been the only one to properly appreciate such a teasing comment, especially in the current situation.
‘Salazar, you arse, you’re freezing!’
Something in his thoughts must have shown on his face because Robards’ scowl deepened. ‘Get out of my office, Potter,’ he commanded. ‘You’re late for your session with Smith.’
The old Draco would have been crying hysterically over something a lot smaller. The old Draco hadn’t spent three months in Azkaban after living with the Dark Lord for over a year. Honestly what was a little flesh shredding and a stabbing compared to a prolonged
He nodded.
‘You’re going to make it possible,
The words hurt, more so because they were something he’d been considering for a while. Something he’d had to come to terms with when he started building friendships with Harry and Luna – even grudgingly with Ginny and with Bill through their work.
Possibly it was the shadows under hers eyes and the tear stained cheeks but it could have been the ugly slippers and state of dress that had Harry blurting out, ‘Fuck, Hermione, are you alright?’ rather than address the fact he’d just been caught kissing Draco in the middle of the Entrance Hall at six in the morning.
‘We didn’t know what was happening at all,’ Ginny put in and went on to explain how, to everyone else at the table, it had looked as though he and Harry had both frozen, eyes snapping to Harry’s arm in unison. ‘It was creepy,’ Ginny mused, ‘but also kind of wicked.’
Robards once again spoke as though Harry hadn’t said anything. ‘Bill Weasley has volunteered to work with Malfoy.’
‘Of course, you did,’ said Draco, and he was quite happy he’d managed to keep his own feelings about their late headmaster out of his tone. ‘You trusted him.’
It was quite pleasurable listening to the outraged shouting and ineffective threats being shouted his way as he walked into the Great Hall with Harry by his side. He didn’t even put up more than a token protest when Harry followed him to the Slytherin table, taking the seat across from him while Luna sat beside him. It was a little hard to protest with his feet tangled with Harry’s beneath the table and Luna telling them all about the trip she and her father were planning for their Christmas holidays.
Harry snorted. ‘Timed that well then.’
‘Teaching,’ Hermione answered. ‘Non-verbal spells, specifically.’
‘I need you to turn around and tell me exactly what you see.’
Hermione laughed and stepped up to give him a fond kiss. ‘I love you just as you are.’
‘Oh, shut up,’ she snaps. ‘Don’t be so good about it. I’m allowed to hate you! You cheated on me! You fell in love with another fucking man – Draco Malfoy of all people! – and still managed to get me pregnant.’
There was no way, Harry would have come to love the boy he’d been.
He straightened up, took a grasp of the bottle and refilled his and Pansy’s glasses. He downed the contents of his in one fiery swallow and then refilled it. ‘You wanted to marry me when you were five?’
Draco had been told more than once that he radiated heat, that he was always, if you didn’t count those three months in Azkaban, running hotter than other people and Harry – who had always slept with layers before – now slept in a t-shirt and pants in the middle of winter. He complained about how hot Draco was but that didn’t stop him from draping himself all over Draco in the middle of the night.
‘Yes,’ Draco replied smartly. ‘There’ll be a lot of fucking conditions attached to any money they donate, though.’
Hermione didn’t seem convinced, but she didn’t say anything more on the subject and Draco was happy to let it drop. ‘I’ll start on a list of muggle subjects I remember if you want to go through the OWL and NEWT catalogues,’ she suggested.
Would Harry’s still be a dementor? Draco glanced at him and saw that Harry wasn’t any more eager to find out than Draco was. ‘Did Luna give you her boggart speech?’ he asked Harry.
Draco gave him an amused look. ‘Not surprising, there’s a lot of money here.’
If they’d realised how often she crawled into bed with him as a shield to her own nightmares and not just his, they’d realise it was perfectly normal. That didn’t mean he was going to offer an explanation, let them think what they wanted about his relationship with Luna, the two (three) of them knew the truth and it wasn’t anyone else’s business.
This set Hermione off again, but it was nice, seeing her smile and watching her start to understand just how long this thing between he and Draco had been building.
No, if the Ministry could so viciously disregard the life of a broken boy trying to make amends while drowning in guilt, then Harry would not work for them or with them. How would that go, he wondered, when they were forced to acknowledge Harry’s refusal to work with them to the wizarding public? Would they listen then? Make the necessary changes? Take actions to safeguard Draco when he was out with the DMLE doing such vital work?
Given that Harry didn’t actually expect Ron to do much looking – half the bloody stuff in this vault was probably cursed – he didn’t hold it against his friend. It wasn’t like he’d been dragged along as another set of hands. If Pansy had been the one to come with him as he’d originally planned, she’d definitely have draped herself dramatically across the couch to shout criticisms at him from a safe distance.
Some of Harry’s annoyance gave way to embarrassment. ‘Was everybody in on this?’ he grouched.
‘I know.’ And Draco did know, because part of that conversation he’d gotten stuck in with Granger had included her expressing a desire to understand the traditions purebloods were so afraid of losing. ‘I also think having proper Muggle Studies classes in necessary.’
‘Over the summer,’ Harry confirmed.
Harry sighed, dropped his chin to his chest and just took a moment to remember why he’d thought this was a good idea. With Draco’s smirk (not his smile – again, things about Harry that should probably be discussed with a mind healer) fixed firmly in his mind, Harry lifted his chin and stepped into the vault. Ron followed after him and immediately took a seat on the fancy looking loveseat right inside the door on the left. The thing was probably five hundred years old, if not older, and had clearly been placed in the vault by a wary spouse, fed up with just standing around while the other half got on with the poking about.
‘Well, they haven’t killed me yet,’ Harry had pointed out but then Draco had been forced to demonstrate how the blood runes could be made to rise to the surface of Harry’s skin and he took some pleasure in making everyone uncomfortable by licking the side of Harry’s neck right there in McGonagall’s office.
Draco refused to flinch away even if getting such an up-close look at Weasley was disgusting. ‘Yes.’
Harry shrugged. ‘It seemed like a good idea at the time.’
Legally and magically Harry was a Black. Sirius had known what he was doing when he left everything to Harry, and the intricate bond he and Draco had linked them tighter than any magical marriage ever could. For all intents and purposes, Harry was a Black by soul and marriage and most of the protections should recognise that. That didn’t mean Harry was going to go blindly poking about, the Blacks had generations of magic soaking everything in this vault, there were bound to be some nasty surprises.
‘The vine didn’t kill her,’ Mustafa grunted, eying the ground around Marigold cautiously. ‘It just ate her.’
He turned his gaze back out the window and tried not to listen to Ron quickly explaining to Ginny what was going on. He didn’t know how much Ginny knew about his summer, not all the details. She knew he’d been visiting Draco, but he doubted she realised how often he’d been out to Azkaban although he suspected Arthur and Molly had some inkling. They’d all made a point of asking him what he was doing, and he’d been honest with them both when he’d first told them he was trying to understand, trying to be better.
The realisation hadn’t come until he was halfway across the water, back toward the dry warmth of the mainland. He’d taken that journey multiple times, possibly dozens of times, by then, and yet that was the first time he leant over the side and retched.
‘I wish you hadn’t done it but I’m not angry, Draco.’
He'd had similar thoughts before, but the more Draco knew about how the muggle world worked, about the advances in technology and culture they’d made, the more he was coming to realise that the magical world had stagnated in so many ways.
There was a hate he’d tentatively believed was beginning to bloom into something that might one day be forgiveness. He’d thought the way they’d been talking, the way they’d been working together and the way that she’d stopped harshly demanding explanations to some of the magic he used, meant that she was beginning to see that he’d changed. He didn’t expect her to like him – had never expected that – but he was realising now that somewhere along the way, he’d let Harry’s insistence that Hermione would see the changes in him and come to maybe accept him as Harry’s partner and one day maybe even a friend, trick him into believing it was possible.
Harry had, without meaning to, choked out a laugh and explained, ‘Half the time I think I want to kill him.’
She surprised him by saying, ‘Being a good student doesn’t necessarily mean you’d make a good teacher.’ She studied him thoughtfully. ‘Is that what you want to do? Teach?’
This hardly endeared him to Draco and although it had only been a week, he couldn’t see Joseph being a successful teacher if he didn’t change how he viewed most of the students. So far, he hadn’t taught them anything Draco didn’t know. He didn’t know if that was a reflection of Joseph’s teaching or his own extensive studies, however, and it wasn’t like he was in a position to ask anyone. He hadn’t spoken to anyone other than Luna in the four days they’d been back at Hogwarts. He was making a point of keeping to himself and ignoring the insults and slurs the other students sent his way whenever they felt they could get away with it.
‘You didn’t have to do that,’ Draco’s voice was soft, some of the heat from his gaze melting away as they navigated the empty corridors.
Harry thought about it. He thought about how Kingsley was the highest-ranking member of Dumbledore’s Order still alive, how he’d called on his old instructor to help clean up the Ministry and how Robards had earned his position. He thought about Percy messing about with the laws and how Harry himself had used that to help Draco and all he could do was growl.
And he didn’t want to have to get it, sleeping drugged and alone on the couch while Draco attempted to sleep without all the worried tossing and turning in their bed.
And possibly worst of all was that he couldn’t just tell them. He couldn’t give them a tired smile and tell them he just wanted to be alone with Draco. He couldn’t tell them that he didn’t want to answer their questions because once he did things would be different. He was tired and worried and for one horrible moment he wished it was summer again. That it was just him and Luna watching over Draco as he recovered from Azkaban. That Narcissa was there, showing Harry that, in spite of every bad choice she had made, she loved her son more than anything in the world.
He was stubborn and prideful, and his father taught him how to manipulate people. He taught him who he should associate with and impressed upon him with love and (his idea of) gentle guidance the sort of people who a Malfoy should be associated with. That little boy who’d cried himself to sleep because he’d been hurt was determined to follow in his father’s footsteps and prove that he was exactly the right type of wizard. He didn’t need Harry as a friend to become powerful and influential. He was a Malfoy and Malfoy’s did not have friends. Malfoy’s had admirers and acquaintances and people who could get things done with a whisper in their ear.
He makes sure Malfoy doesn’t see who the letter is addressed to and gives the barn owl a treat before he sends it off into the evening sky.
Draco blushed, quickly hiding his hands behind his back.
“Ah, finally decided to respond to Granger and Weasley?”
“I don’t know, okay?” Potter interrupted him. “I don’t know.”
“You died for fuck’s sake,” Draco said, irritation flaring up in him. “You died to save all of our arses. You don’t owe anybody anything. If anything, the rest of the world owes you!”
“Fuck, Malfoy, what do you want me to do?”
“What did you expect?” he muttered as he sipped at his wine.
Draco studies him for a moment and narrows his eyes. “I thought you didn’t trust me.”
Draco gulps. This is a nightmare. Potter can’t be serious. There will be skin on skin contact!
“Don’t mind him,” Draco says, turning away from Potter. “All he does is work. He doesn’t know how to have a good time.”
“Draco-”
He finally understands the regret he heard in Potter’s voice when he had talked about Sirius and not being able to get to know him properly. It was only in these last few weeks that Draco got to know the real Potter. He thought he knew him, but, apparently, he spent fourteen years in utter ignorance.
“It doesn’t even smell like anything.”
“Merlin’s beard!” Slughorn freezes when he sees Potter lying on the ground. “Is he—”
“Strawberry?” One tap.
“There’s no other way.” Potter leans forward, until their foreheads are touching. “Look, I don’t—I know this is going to sound stupid, but… the thought of coming back to you is—it’s—”
“He really likes you, Draco,” Luna said softly.
“Fair enough,” Potter said. “I’m looking forward to having my mind changed.”
“What they mean by that,” Andromeda said patiently, “is that you pay the zoo some money so they can take care of the animals, but we’re not allowed to take them home with us.” She gently brushed her fingers through his turquoise hair as he looked at the ground, crestfallen.
Malfoy let out a snort and Harry was pretty sure he was rolling his eyes.
“It makes me sick, thinking about it,” he hears Potter mutter.
finally
Malfoy shrugged.
Harry snorts, trying to make it sound indignant. “For your information, I happen to like this café.”
Harry shivered as all the disappointment from that morning washed over him again. That had been a week ago and he still hadn’t said anything to Draco. Instead, he had tried to go back to how things were.
“Fuck! You’re not wearing any underwear,” Potter groaned. His husky voice sent unimaginable desire through Draco. He almost lost his balance when he bumped against something, but Potter held him in place. His eyes snapped open and he blinked, disoriented. Potter had led him to one of the armchairs; his body was still pressed firmly against Draco’s from behind. Slowly, he pushed down Draco’s trousers, until they pooled around his ankles. Potter’s hands slid up his thighs, pausing when they reached his backside. Draco felt him lean in, his hot breath ghosting over his ear.
“I wanted to keep talking to you,” Harry said, surprised Malfoy had to ask.
“Why are you here, then?” Malfoy asks, moving so close that his nose brushes against Harry’s.
“Oh, Harry, you really shouldn’t drink that. What if you tell everyone about—”
Harry smiles awkwardly and clears his throat. He really misses playing Quidditch. But these last few days, he hardly ever thought about it; his mind has been preoccupied stressing over Malfoy.
“Promise you won’t tell.”
“No! NO!”
“Of course he is.”
“What?”
“I’m sorry, mate,” Weasley says quietly.
“It’s my fault. It’s all my fault.”
“Come to us if you think of anything else that might help,” Draco adds.
What the actual fuck?
had said it, with the way he’d said it, almost awestruck, made Draco momentarily lose his balance.
Malfoy says nothing, but the silence that follows makes Harry think he agreed, and that Dumbledore is performing the spell on him now. He hears Dumbledore move to his other side, indicating he’s now doing the same to Ron, who is still asleep.
“A few come to mind, actually,” he said in his poshest voice. “Awful, uncouth, dowdy, dense…”
“What do you mean?”
neither of you need me for that.”
“Well, then what are you waiting for?”
“Only because you make it to so easy.”
“Exactly,” Blaise said cheerfully, touching his glass to Draco’s with a toothy grin. “I can’t wait till Potter gets to us.”
“I— I thought—” He felt the muscles in Potter’s arm clench. “I thought I would be okay with— I thought I could—”
“That’s not—”
“Comforting me again?” Malfoy asks. He sounds almost amused.
“It’s part of the game,” Draco shrugs.
That seems to catch Potter’s attention, although Draco can tell he’s trying to look only mildly interested.
When the morning sun glitters through his window and he hears birds chirping cheerfully, he finally gives up on sleep.
“Try what?” Malfoy said through gritted teeth.
“So we don’t know if they ran away or if they were kidnapped,” he mutters. “Is there anything else out of the ordinary you noticed over the last few months?”
“THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!”
He almost sighs in relief when Malfoy drops his hand to his crotch and starts to rub him. All the sorrow and confusion he has felt, since Malfoy left his bed, are completely forgotten as Harry loses himself in the sensation of his touch. Tentatively, he reaches out until he finds the other boy’s bulge, teasing the tip through his pyjama bottoms. Malfoy gasps and Harry feels heat rushing through him, caused by that little sound.
He didn’t want to turn and look at Potter, he really didn’t, but he couldn’t stop himself. Before he knew it, their eyes were locked in silent understanding.
“What’s the matter? Not so eager anymore?”
“You could wear a hessian sack and I would be turned on,” Harry replied over his shoulder. “And you can’t tell me you don’t love that.”
Trying to keep his voice even, Draco scoffs. “If this is so unbearable for you, I guess we can go back to—”
“Um, no,” Potter croaked. “But, given the circumstances, I, err, think it would be easier if you were the one to… err…”
Harry watched his friends and was shocked when Hermione clutched her chest and put her other hand on Ron’s arm. He smiled at her and nodded.
“It’s not,” Teddy said, frowning.
After his initial shock, Draco couldn’t help but smile at her enthusiasm. “It’s an infant school, not the Triwizard Tournament,” he sniggered. “But your ideas don’t sound too bad. I think they might like it.”
“Hmmm, I guess I finally understand your obsession with lip balm,” Harry breathed amusedly. He stroked Draco’s cheek with his thumb and brought their foreheads together, suddenly feeling really dizzy.
It takes Draco a moment to recognise his own words.
Draco scowled at him, but before he could come up with a proper insult, Potter was touching his cheek, making him feel hot all over. Their lips were inches apart and Draco almost started trembling.
“I’m getting the impression I should be the one apologising,” Malfoy drawls.
“Then why- What are you doing? I can’t even tell if that was accidental or not? If you regret it or not? What is this- What are we-”
“You can’t run away forever, Potter.”
“But you don’t believe in what it stands for, do you? I think you haven’t for a while.”
“I—What?”
“Did you find anything last night?” she asks, lowering her voice to a whisper.
“Harry.”
“Times have changed,” Malfoy shrugs, as though this isn’t a big deal. Wow, he really is different, isn’t he?
“What the—” A splash of tea landed on his trousers when he jerked and turned his head. He stiffened when he realised Baxter had climbed onto his shoulder. The koala didn’t seem to want to cuddle, though. Its eyes were fixed on the Daily Prophet.
Potter grunts and shakes his head. “A disaster,” he grumbles.
Harry looked at him in astonishment.
“Err…”
He follows Potter, mentally berating himself, and knits his brows as he takes in his surroundings. The colour scheme is positively ghastly. Even the bloody armchairs and sofas are scarlet.
“Honestly, Draco, you’re not even trying to come up with a proper lie. I know you. I’ve gotten to know a whole new side of you and I can’t pretend it didn’t happen. And neither can you!”
“We will make mistakes,” Harry said, kissing the tip of Draco’s nose. “That’s inevitable. We’ll just figure it out as we go. Just like we did… with us.”
“Silencio.”
Draco smirked as he guided Potter’s hand to his backside and leaned down to breathe against his lips. “Finger me, and then we’ll see what I can or can’t do.”
Malfoy sighs. “Believe me, this is the last thing I ever wanted to wake up to.” His left eyebrow twitches. “But it is what it is.”
“It’s just, um… It’s warm in here. You’re warm. It’s—”
“Where are we going?” Potter asked, sounding amused.
Shit!
“What?”
Draco couldn’t suppress the choking sound bubbling up in his throat. Overcome with a wave of strange emotions, he crawled forward and wrapped his arms around the child, momentarily forgetting about the furry creature in his lap.
“Oh.” Malfoy furrows his brows. Why does he look so gobsmacked? “Is that why you kissed me?”
“So you’re not mad?” Potter asks.
What the fuck.
The teachers don’t seem happy about it, but they all turn towards the door. Draco follows them.
“Alright, off you go, then. And report back to me as soon as you find anything suspicious.”
“What did you just say?” Draco whispers. Potter just stares at him. “What did you just—” Draco breaks off as his brain goes into overdrive. There was something Potter said last night. Something Draco didn’t think much of when he woke up this morning because, surely, that was a dream. It was only a dream!
That night, Draco stays at the office much longer than he usually does. He just can’t seem to find the strength to get up. Potter doesn’t want to work with him anymore. And he didn’t even have the courtesy to tell Draco himself. What does he expect Draco to do now? To forget everything that happened? To avoid him and never talk to him again? Well, Draco decides, as he finally pushes himself out of his seat, that’s exactly what he’s going to do.
“What am I doing here?” Draco stared at him incredulously. “You’re the one who just showed up here and made himself comfortable in my shower!”
“What is going on?” Madam Pomfrey inquires, sternly. “Barging in like— Oh! Is this it? You managed to do it?”
“Alright,” McGonagall says. “But not right now. I haven’t informed the students about your arrival yet. I’ll do it tomorrow, at breakfast. I don’t want to alarm the students just before bed time. If you could lay low until then, I’d very much appreciate it.”
“Can you take care of it? Professor Sprout told me to ask you.”
Draco lets out a humourless laugh. “Oh, Potter, you have no idea.”
“He doesn’t like me.”
“I want to know exactly what the sod did.”
“Please don’t take it out on her. I made her tell me. And she trusts me. And I trust her not tell anyone else. But honestly, I don’t get it, Draco. Why are you keeping this a secret?”
“Which is why you could easily cast an umbrella charm.”
Right. Work. Because that’s all that matters.
“Oi, Malfoy!”
“I really wish you wouldn’t,” Harry said, suddenly feeling exhausted.
“I’m not making—”
Malfoy doesn’t move.
Before Draco knew what was happening, he felt a hand on his hip which pulled him against Potter’s side.
“I mean if you are, that’s… whatever. Although I would prefer you didn’t turn my flat into a brothel.”
“Ugh, I can’t believe we have to hand in all the homework we missed. By the end of the week! Are they mental?”
Draco was sure he was about to faint. The heat wasn’t exactly helping, either.
“Even,” Malfoy snorts. That little noise sounds so derisive, it makes Harry grind his teeth.
“Thanks, Professor,” he murmured, before he resumed wallowing in self-pity.
“So you didn’t
Ugh, unfortunately. Draco’s lips move without his permission. “Yes”, he breathes. He’s already imagining it.
“Expelliarmus,” he yelled. Malfoy’s wand flew across the room and Harry caught it with his free hand. “Seriously, Malfoy? What is wrong with you?” Harry watched as Malfoy’s shoulders slightly slumped. Without another word he stormed out of the dorm, slamming the door behind him.
What the fuck just happened?
“You’re not doing anybody any favours, being all tortured and broken up about it.” As he reached for his cup, Draco made sure his eyes didn’t leave Potter’s. It was harder than he had anticipated. He was being a hypocrite. Because that was exactly what he was doing, but, apparently, he was better at hiding it than Potter. But it wasn’t like he wasn’t working on it. He was trying to be better. It just took time. Apparently.
Oh, but it isn’t. It really isn’t, Draco realises as Potter’s tongue brushes against his lips. It’s the most amazing feeling, and yet, it’s not enough. It’s not nearly enough. Draco wants to crane his neck, push their mouths together, grab Potter’s hips and pull him closer. He almost does.
Harry looks at him, curiosity sparked.
“Where were you?”
There, in the middle of his tiny room, stands Draco, only illuminated by the faint moonlight glistening through the window. Still, Harry can clearly see the swollen, purple mark on his left cheek, the cut on his bottom lip, and the angry red streaks on his neck.
“Wait here for me,” Draco murmurs.
“You fulfilled your destiny. And yet, destiny still has a claim on you.”
“What?” Draco breathed. He was too dizzy for a clever response.
“Well…” She looked at him sheepishly. “It’s more what I didn’t do.”
“Like what?” Harry asked, skeptically.
Harry scowls at Draco, his chest heaving.
Potter looks up, his brows furrowed and his mouth set in strange line. “Why are you so eager to set me up with someone?”
Harry freezes before Malfoy does. He starts to choke. He pulls back his head, releasing Malfoy’s cock and panting furiously.
“Merlin, you’re so hot,” Potter breathed in his ear. “I can’t wait to fuck you.”
“Ron, I’m sorry, I—”
“Um, there’s… there’s somethin’ I’ve been meaning ter tell yeh, Harry.”
he asks himself.
“What?”
He slaps his palm against the wall. Potter has no right to act like this. Potter has no right to act like Draco actually means something to him.
“The lake seems like a good place to start,” Draco says. “We’ll pass the greenhouses on our way. Maybe we’ll find a connection.”
It feels like he’s surrounded by fire, scorching his flesh.
“That’s what you’re doing. I’m filling out important paperwork.”
“You only invited me to one gala.” That definitely sounded a little reproachful.
“I mean, if I, um, took the edge off—”
McGonagall looks torn, but she finally gives a curt nod and gestures for the other teachers to stand beside her.
“Auror Potter! We didn’t expect you to be back so soon,” the middle-aged man said, clasping one of Harry’s hands and shaking it vigorously.
Another tap. Harry feels something twist in his stomach that quickly spreads to his loins. Before Malfoy can change his mind, Harry drops to his knees, intent on replacing his hand with his mouth. But... now that he’s kneeling in front of Malfoy, his face inches away from his cock, he suddenly doesn’t feel so bold anymore.
“How would you feel about a compromise?” Potter proposes quietly.
“The mind?” Draco echoes.
“Would you rather hand in something that’s full of mistakes?” Malfoy retorts. “You’re welcome by the way.”
“I don’t know about that,” Harry mutters, looking down.
His father’s voice sounded strained, almost like a scared whisper. He hesitantly stretched out his arm, his hand balled into a fist. Draco swallowed hard as several heads turned towards him, watched him. He was sure they all expected him to walk across the courtyard without hesitation. It was where he belonged after all.
“Oh. Do you not like that?” More heat rushes to Harry’s cheeks, but not in arousal. What if Malfoy wants to stop? What if he just realised he doesn’t like Harry touching him, after all? If he could just see his face. His suspicion seems to be confirmed when he feels a tap against his wrist. Just one.
Harry’s only consolation for the moment is that, whatever Malfoy is up to, it doesn’t seem to involve hurting Harry. Not directly at least. But letting Malfoy see this vulnerable side of him might expose Harry. It might play right into Malfoy’s cards. But, Harry reckons, if he wanted to harm him, he would have done it already. He has had enough opportunities.
“It’s not the same,” Ron grumbles as he falls into step beside Harry. “Gryffindor would have won the Quidditch Cup for sure this year.”
“I’m pretty sure the answer to that is painfully obvious.”
“Nobody said anything about fair, Potter,” Pansoyle smirked.
Something that almost sounds like a moan escapes Harry’s throat. He’s feeling so dizzy, he’d probably collapse if Malfoy wasn’t holding him in place; actually, he’s pulling Harry closer to him.
Patience has never been his strong suit.
Harry takes a deep breath, deciding to show the other boy how much he wants this. He places Malfoy’s hand on his chest, right over his heart.
“I don’t care,” Draco whispered, closing the gap between their lips again. Harry made a pleased humming sound while his hands wandered to the small of Draco’s back.
“What?” Harry stared at him in bewilderment. “What— What are you saying, Malfoy?”
a virgin.”
Potter meets his gaze and he seems to think about it for a second. “I don’t know.” He looks like he’s biting the inside of his cheek. “Maybe I shouldn’t have.”
“I didn’t, actually.”
“Are you ever going to talk to me again?”
Draco gives him a lopsided grin, even though disappointment bubbles up inside his chest. Potter was supposed to grab him and kiss him, not cower in the corner like a scared animal. Why is this so hard? Why is Potter making it so damn hard?
“We need to go,” Potter says.
“Wait,” he hears Potter murmur and pauses.
Potter’s eyes find his and Draco’s heart squeezes as he drinks in their emptiness.
“I can’t remember when I last took the time to watch the sunset,” Potter says quietly. He sounds so relaxed and content, it makes Draco smile. He lies down on his side and props up his head on his hand.
Harry does, expecting the task to be nearly over, but…
“No,” Dumbledore replies. The finality in his voice makes Draco shiver. “Nobody regrets this more than I do,” he continues quietly. “Harry’s bravery—”
“What happened?” Harry asks and immediately flinches. It feels like someone shoved nails down his throat.
Hermione shrugs again, as if it’s nothing. Ever since she and Malfoy started working together, Harry has been losing his mind. She’d casually drop his name in conversations — she calls him Draco now for crying out loud! — and Harry has to stop himself every time not to bombard her with a million questions. He was surprised when he heard Malfoy started training to become a healer. Apparently, he and Hermione are very competitive. Not that that should surprise anyone. What is very surprising, however, is the fact that they’ve become somewhat friendly. Harry can’t deny he’s kind of jealous of their relationship. Not that he’d ever admit that to Hermione. But looking at her now, he has a feeling she already knows.
It still feels like he made progress today. They had their first civil conversation.
After a moment of hesitation, Ginny starts moving. They walk for quite a bit until she comes to a halt, obviously unsure of what to do next.
“Sure,” Draco replied, his voice sounding indifferent. He knew that was just an empty phrase, something you said to someone you secretly hope to never see again. He let go of Potter’s hand and turned away, intent on going home as quickly as possible.
“And how I’d love to get you out of these trousers,” he purrs, gently brushing a finger against Potter’s thigh. “If only you knew how much I’m dying to get on my knees for you.”
“Merlin, you’re so gullible,” Malfoy laughs.
, Harry thinks, a sly smile creeping on his face. Malfoy jerks and Harry quickly releases him.
“It wasn’t.”
Harry tries to swallow his anger and keep his voice even. “Why can’t we just be… normal with each other? The war is over. He’s gone.” Harry pauses, trying to decipher the crease between Malfoy’s brows. “Clean slate?” Harry asks, stretching out his hand and waiting for Malfoy to shake it. He doesn’t. He just stares at it and clutches his book a little tighter.
“You’re not seriously comparing me to Malfoy, are you?” Weasley looks deeply offended.
“It’s not. He assaulted you.”
“Poor choice of words. Potter knows what I mean. Alright then. See you around. Granger.” Draco nods at her before he flees the scene, but not without overhearing Granger bombarding Potter with questions about what the hell is going on.
“Oh no,” Harry muttered. Malfoy took a look over his shoulder and rolled his eyes.
“I like to keep myself busy. I don’t see a problem with that,” Potter shrugs.
For once in his life, Harry heartily agreed with Malfoy. This really was ridiculous. What was Dumbledore thinking? True, things had gone a bit out of hand after the last Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin but that didn’t justify… this!
“You can’t tell me you’re supporting this— this— maniac because you believe he’ll make the world a better place for you.” He leans forward, focusing on Draco’s eyes. “You’re doing this because he’s threatening to kill you and your family.”
The koala only gave a sleepy squeak and stayed curled on its side, right next to Draco.
his brain unhelpfully presses,
Potter rubs his chin and slowly shakes his head. “I can’t believe you made us both suffer over nothing.”
“I read about it years ago.” Malfoy’s sombre tone isn’t really helping.
“Potter! Stop fighting it,” he shouts. “Stop—” His voice breaks yet again. His eyes lock with Potter’s and his stomach drops when he sees his tortured expression. “You can’t fight it,” Draco says, not knowing if he’s helping Potter or if he’s sealing his fate. He can only hope Dumbledore knew what he was talking about. “Stop fighting it. Concentrate on what you’re feeling.”
“Hey, hey,” Draco chimed in, getting down to his knees. “I’ll buy you a plushie instead, okay?”
“The weather,” Malfoy promptly answers.
He stumbles off, hoping Malfoy will follow him. He grips the edge of the sink, his entire body shaking. When he hears someone shutting the door, he doesn’t waste another second. He staggers forward, pushing a seemingly surprised Malfoy against the door.
Draco when he betrayed him like that.
“You told me you couldn’t be with anyone right now.” Her tone isn’t exactly accusatory, but…
Understanding slowly dawns on him and for a second, he is completely baffled. “You never let them stay for breakfast,” he breathes.
“Potter, what are you doing?” he said, almost choking on the words. His eyes darted down when Potter licked his lips in one swift motion. “This is what I’m talking about. You can’t just keep playing these games with me.”
“No,” Malfoy breathes, dread ringing loudly in his voice. “This can’t be happening.”
Draco sighs and puts his hand on the dividing wall, palm turned upwards. Potter just blinks at him.
“She said there’s a Niffler on the loose and it scared the Mandrakes. Apparently, the Niffler dug the poor things out of their pots.”
“But we’re still missing some details,” Dumbledore continues. “We know the curse you cast, Harry.” He ignores Harry’s flinching. “But we’re still not sure how it might have lead to this.”
He wants to back away, take a step back, but the cold hands keep him in place. He wants to struggle, and moves his hands to break away from Malfoy, only to feel the marred skin beneath his fingertips again. A weird stabbing pain shoots down his spine. He can’t bear it. It’s too much. Too much.
“Usually, you never go anywhere without her and Weasley,” Malfoy drawls.
Pansy stepped aside, giving him a clear view of the person sitting next to Luna.
“Like what?”
“I’m so sorry, Headmistress,” Draco said, hurrying around the desk. He heaved the koala out of her lap and waited until it had wrapped its paws around his neck. “Well…” he felt incredibly awkward. “Thank you for the opportunity and um… I guess we’ll stay in touch?”
“Y—Yes,” he groaned. Damn it!
“For Merlin’s sake, Draco, just put it in already!” Harry tried to guide Draco’s hand in the right direction, but the other man was fighting him.
Harry hastily wipes his face with his sleeve. He’s still not sure what the hell he’s doing. But before he can stop himself, he hears himself whisper, “Could you… could you stay here for another minute?”
“These will do,” Malfoy says and thrusts one of the brooms into Harry’s hand. “You’ll never catch me,” he smirks, and before Harry knows what’s happening, he zooms off into the sky.
“Hmmm, this is nice. I’m glad we came here,” Potter murmurs.
“I guess I need some time to figure it out.” He sucked in his bottom lip and started chewing on it. “And I know I can’t stay here forever. I’ll try to find somewhere else to go soon.”
“What the fuck is going on?” Ron shouts. He whirls around and draws his wand.
Without breathing, he leans down. He knows it’s risky, he knows it’s stupid, but he wants Potter to
When Draco saw what Pansy was holding, his mouth went dry. It was a cheque. For the school.
Draco is just about to propose they go down to the greenhouses and further investigate the grounds when he hears it. A whisper. Barely audible. But it’s there. And it’s calling him.
“So…” Trying to make sense of this was giving Draco a massive headache, but he was starting to feel… strange. Still no sympathy. Not exactly. But if Potter was telling the truth, this was really messed up. “We still don’t know how you turned into a koala. And why. All we know is you ended up in a zoo.”
“Potter is good in a duel, but intellectually…” Nick smirks.
Before Potter could say anything to that, Draco got down on his knees in front of him.
“He’ll never let anything bad happen to you.”
“Bloody fantastic.”
Harry felt the initial shock fade and started snickering.
Malfoy’s hand slowly slides down from his mouth and Harry finally realises he hasn’t said anything else.
“What is there to talk about?”
“Have dinner with me tonight?” Malfoy asks, his voice raspy and his tone… almost a little shy. Harry can only nod silently. “Can you pick me up at work? It’ll be easier.”
Jacob slowly nods, even though it’s very clear he’s the opposite of okay.
“Well, then don’t stop on my account,” Potter says, his voice low and husky.
It took an agonisingly long time until Potter put his trembling hand in Draco’s. He let himself be tugged back to the bed where they both sat down.
“Oh please,” Draco snorted. “You know how good you are. You would have beaten me in that race yesterday if it hadn’t been for that bird.”
“I’m sorry, Harry. I’m afraid we will need to have a deeper look into the matter. All the teachers are trying their best.”
Harry grins at him, the fork still in his mouth. He pulls it out deliberately slow and gives it an extra lick. His eyes sparkle in the candlelight and Draco can’t help but think how lucky he is and that Harry has never looked more handsome.
Someone clapped a hand on his back and then everyone was going about their jobs like normal except for the messy haired man who was Harry fucking Potter because he had a wide grin on his face as he walked toward Ron. In a desperate need to not be humiliated he nipped back into his office with a smile he thought was welcoming and dove behind his desk where he hoped the sturdy wood and gathering clutter of paperwork would hide the wobbly belly he’d developed over the years behind a desk. Would the light hide his thinning hair? And he knew Hermione said it was nothing, but Ron was aware he’d started developing a bald patch a month or so ago.
His attackers had all been sprawled on the floor incapacitated and it wasn’t what she wanted at all.
‘What?’ she’d asked, bemused.
Honestly, Harry would have liked her for that alone, but she got along well with Luna, was another person who could check in on Narcissa and she was a part of Draco’s life from before that he could be proud to cling to. She was a relationship he didn’t have to be ashamed to still want. Not that he should be ashamed to want any connection to the people he’d once cared about. Because he had cared about them, in his own way. Rebuilding a proper – healthy – friendship with Pansy had shown him that, at the very least. Draco had never shied away from talking about the past with Harry, hard not to when most of their important conversations had taken place in his cell in Azkaban, but Harry had noticed that since becoming reacquainted with Pansy, Draco found it easier to talk about Crabbe and Goyle.
Still, he Ron figured that when he rocked up for his first day and held that first meeting with his aurors he’d get to see his old friend again and with the power he had as the new head of the department he could pull him aside for a quick word and a request for a catch up without having to make excuses for blowing off work for a bit of a chat.
Draco tried not to think about a time when the Manor wards might have had similar leanings. He tried not to think about a time when he himself had similar leanings – even if it was as little as a year or two ago. He had the advantage of youthful stupidity and the chance to grow and learn. His mother was doing her best to change and grow with a changing society, but he wondered what would have happened if there’d been a stronger fight from the purebloods after Voldemort’s death. He couldn’t help wondering how things – how he – might have been different if it all hadn’t simply fallen apart with their leader’s death.
A sulky voice from upstairs shouted, ‘Dad! Astara’s yelling!’
‘Yeah, Pansy gave it to me for a laugh.’
Draco opened his mouth to point out he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t decide on that and then closed it before he nodded, acknowledging now wasn’t exactly the time to get into the debate again. They’d gotten as far in their plans for the future as to agree they’d live in the Manor for a year with his mother while they got settled into their careers. Well Harry did and Draco just did whatever he wanted while the Ministry sorted out exactly what he was allowed to do. The plan was to finish stripping the Manor of harmful magic and further the renovations to make it into a suitable school for young children.
His rich friends weren’t the only ones who had things to make up for. Most of them would be lucky enough to earn back society’s respect with donations and charitable acts. Draco had much more to work off, many more horrible acts that he needed to atone for and there were still times when he didn’t even think his work with the Ministry could make a dent in that list.
Harry hadn’t needed to come with him, though Draco desperately appreciated the support and comfort Harry unwaveringly offered.
Silence fell at that and all eyes turned back to look at the professor.
Draco was sort of sad he’d missed that whole enlightening process – Luna assured him it had been quite entertaining, trying to make sense of all Harry’s awkward questions and trailed off sentences that ended in blushes and more stammering. Without Granger to do his thinking for him, Harry had been forced to make his own assessment of certain actions.
‘You,’ Draco answered honestly. ‘Learning techniques. Have you ever wondered why there are so many empty classrooms in the castle?’ Draco didn’t look at Harry, instead, he cast the detection charm and watched the silver light pulse from his wand, spread wide until it was a massive shimmering wall that swept the width of the corridor. The light of the spell clung to the walls, washing over portraits and suits of armour as flowed down the length of the corridor, right to the very end.
‘You hit him in the back with a stinging hex,’ someone spoke up. ‘Professor, Chris needs to go to the Hospital Wing.’
Arthur had been reading the paper, Molly putting the finishing touches on the mountain of eggs and toast she’d expect him to eat, and he’d been sat there, thinking about the way Draco had smiled at him, the way his eyes cleared after Harry’s stag had filled the cell with light and warmth and the hope that always seemed to fade when Harry was gone. He’d been lost in thought, thinking about the smirk that used to draw Draco’s mouth up, the way his eyes crinkled, and he’d always have a smart remark or sharp bitter words. He’d been thinking about the conversation he’d had with Luna, about his plans for the next week when Draco was due to be released, and he’d just realised with startling clarity that he loved Draco.
They ordered drinks and chatted about Hugo’s new friendship with their muggle neighbour and were just starting to wonder if home schooling him for a year was the best idea when Harry dropped into the booth and slid across to the wall so he was opposite Hermione while his companion slid in beside him.
‘Still the best-looking bloke I’ve ever seen,’ Harry assured him.
‘Maybe?’ Ginny replied, sidestepping around a wizard who seemed to be struggling to contain his three small children in all the excitement of the snow. ‘Bit before my time, yeah?’
Draco had been mulling it over for days since they’d had it out with Hermione, and he still didn’t know what he was hoping for. A Harry without Hermione and Weasley tying him to the broken boy he used to be had flourished. Draco couldn’t take all the credit for that, and he’d never try. Luna could take credit. Molly and Arthur, Andromeda and little Teddy. Kingsley’s support and Smith’s training and time spent with his mother and all the time spent talking to a mind healer and Madam Pomfrey with her nutritional potions. Those people played a role in helping Harry heal and become who he was but Weasley and Hermione?
‘Nightmares?’ Ginny asked from across the table, looking her friend over in concern.
Ron didn’t have a clue how they worked, only that they were starting to come out of America and something about a deal with a pear and a runic discovery that let magic and technology work together. Rose had started begging him for one the moment she’d heard they existed. But though they weren’t exactly struggling to make ends meet they certainly didn’t have the money to waste on something so fancy and frivolous.
He waits a beat, debates whether or not to say it and then thinks that so far this has been a night for brutal honesty so why not just say it? ‘I want it.’
Something about that thought alarmed him but the potion was starting to take affect and he couldn’t think why his mother shouldn’t know what had happened. He was going to be fine, better she heard about it from McGonagall than in the papers because if the Ministry knew then it was sure to turn up in some newspaper. Everything about his life did, these days, well at least it had over the summer when he’d been with –
Weasley turned red and looked as though he wanted to reach out and grab the front of Draco’s robes, but Harry had had enough. He stood up, shoved Weasley back into his seat with a firm hand on his shoulder and turned to look at the fourth year whose smug expression upon seeing Weasley stand up for him rapidly fell at the sudden and intimidating sight of the Boy Who Lived glaring down at him.
Here he was now showing her the Ron she’d fallen in love with.
‘Don’t apologise,’ she told him softly, shrugging off his words as though they were unnecessary – he felt they were. ‘I’m not trying to tell you what you feel is wrong,’ she murmured, ‘I’m just trying to understand how it happened.’
‘Against you?’ Harry asked dubiously, brow wrinkled.
She stayed and she talked some more with Ron, but it wasn’t like it used to be. She could feel it there, the pull she felt toward him, but she didn’t know that Ron was ready to get back together. She didn’t know that she was, when she had so many thoughts swirling around in her head. Thoughts about her parents and what she’d done. Thoughts about Draco and Harry and all the things they’d done and the things they were still doing now.
He still had the scars across his chest to remember that lovely little moment. They were a part of him now, a reminder of what war could do and all that he’d survived. Harry hated them, hated that he’d left such a permanent mark on Draco when he’d never even known what the spell did. Draco had forgiven him long before they’d even become friends, but he wasn’t sure Harry would ever forgive himself, not truly.
Harry closed his eyes, took a deep breath and when he opened them, he looked more tired than angry. Draco didn’t blame him. They’d been out here in the cold for hours when they were supposed to be warm and safe at the Burrow celebrating Christmas with family. And the Weasel. Actually, judging by the stars that he could see when the clouds moved on, they should have been home from the Borrow hours ago. They could have been snuggled together in the warmth of their bed at the Manor rather than freezing cold in a random muggle village.
Harry automatically moves to reclaim his chair and Draco reluctantly sinks into the one beside it. No one speaks and it is so unbearably awkward that Harry catches Draco twitch out of the corner of his eye, something he knows the man would never normally do. Draco managed not to twitch or betray his feelings even once during his trial before the Wizengamot. Ginny should probably be proud that she can make him.
Hermione, as he’d suspected she would, found his bond with Harry fascinating. Draco, as expected, found her enthusiasm irritating. But he’d found McGonagall’s astonished look amusing and Bill’s gobsmacked expression somewhat delightful. Madam Pomfrey had only sighed after he and Harry had explained it all and promptly run a series of diagnostics on his and Harry’s magic while Bill and Hermione were still firing questions at them. The fact Madam Pomfrey could find nothing wrong with either of them and no real evidence of such a bond had only spurned Hermione’s fascination and had Bill calling on Fleur because he thought her understanding of blood magic might help.
‘How would this even work?’ The words were as close as Draco would ever come to admitting he wanted to be the one.
‘…Pet it?’ Harry repeated incredulously. ‘You want me to pet the metal object trying to chew off you foot?’
He didn’t know what time it was but the fire in the common room was burning low and there were still two or three people dotted about doing their homework or – in the case of Weasley – sleeping while his girlfriend read over and fixed his homework. Draco offered her a small smile when she looked at him questioningly.
Because there was nothing like standing around like a frozen idiot in a field while his boyfriend pulled off some truly spectacular spell work to make Harry look like the underqualified wizard he technically was. And actually, if Harry concentrated on admiring Draco, the way he stood straight and confident, wand moving in precise movements that should have looked sharp and unforgiving but had a lazy quality about them, then he didn’t have to think about the fact that he wasn’t sure he could feel his toes anymore – and he’d put on the spelled wellies he’d worn to the market last month, the ones with the extra wool lining and enough warming charms to set the average person on fire.
Harry was still thinking about it when they arrived home and he stopped in the sitting room to speak with Narcissa about her own education – being a Black he wondered if she’d had tutors and extra studies outside of Hogwarts. She had, which was something to think about, she’d spent summers between her years at Hogwarts learning the things that Hogwarts didn’t offer that any person wishing to be successful would need – like basic mathematics.
Draco didn’t seem to know what to say next and Harry nudged him (gently this time) under the table. In response, Draco kicked him sharply in the shin. Harry’s pained grunt was swallowed up by barely concealed mirth.
Draco had only just started on his tea and was unabashedly staring at Harry as he piled pancakes high on his plate with berries and maple syrup, when the post turned up and dropped an official looking letter in Harry’s lap. He picked it up, gave it an annoyed look and then tossed it straight to Draco, telling him without needing to look who it was from.
He’d never had to. Molly and Arthur Weasley had been hesitant but kind. They’d accepted his apologies and offered understanding in place of forgiveness. Perhaps the forgiveness would come – in some ways it already had – but Draco only needed them to support Harry, the rest would come or it wouldn’t, and that was okay, he would handle that.
The last of Harry’s bad mood was whipped into shape quite thoroughly during the next hour of training with Geraldine Smith, an old – though surprisingly spry – witch Kingsley had begged out of retirement to help clean up the Auror department before she’d seen how bad things had truly gotten and imposed herself on the entire Ministry. So far, she’d been responsible for the dismissal of thirty-nine employees, the suspension of ninety-four more and had, by this point, arrested twenty-three and sent another fifteen off to St Mungo’s for treatment of suspected
‘So I’m being forced to buy you an expensive breakfast?’
Draco’s smirk was a little nasty, but it was well satisfied by the time he was sitting at the Ravenclaw table across from Granger, who took one look at him and didn’t seem to know whether to laugh or duck her head in embarrassment.
two twelve-year-olds and an eleven-year-old go after the philosopher’s stone.
Draco set his tea aside, picked up the envelope and cracked the wax bearing the elaborate Gringotts seal. He read the letter with growing amusement, nudging Harry with a booted foot under the table to get his attention when he was finished.
It was Draco’s turn to be taken aback but he recovered much faster than Harry, who in this instance wanted to giggle. He straightened as best he could and offered an impressive bow, given he was crouched down to look beneath a table. Harry had never had occasion to see Draco in full stuck up Lord mode, with the fancy suit (and robes) and manners being paraded about, but he had a horrible feeling he’d find it just as attractive as he found it when Draco pulled his arrogance around him at Gringotts.
Draco nodded, studying her cool expression. ‘Are you angry at me for hitting Weasley?’
‘I don’t know. Maybe?’ Harry shifted onto his back and then wriggled across the bed until his side was pressed tightly against Draco’s front.
This felt like an appropriate place to get in a reminder that he and Harry, despite how they’d started, actually had a very healthy relationship. ‘Probably not, communication is necessary for any healthy relationship.’
Even at eleven, Harry understood better what was right and wrong.
‘Well, you did insult it, Harry,’ Luna pointed out. She was still patting the wall. ‘It’s a beautiful house.’ She looked at him strangely. ‘I thought you were planning on living here?’
Draco grinned at Kate. ‘Not possible,’ he informed her, accent crisp, poshness exaggerated in the exact way he imagined Draco came over when stuck at official functions with his parents as a kid. ‘Surely it’s you who is the princess?’
‘He does do a lot of the touching,’ Hermione smiled softly and the way she canted her head toward him and wiggled her eyebrows said she knew exactly how that sentence could be taken.
Harry wasn’t back when he and Hermione returned from McGonagall’s office, weighed down with course catalogues and notes on the number of students they would need to accommodate over the next five years (just to start with and because after that evidence of magic in muggleborns was spotty because they were still so young). Draco unthinkingly led the way up to his dormitory and Hermione followed without comment. She did raise her eyebrows though at the protective wards on the door as she followed him inside.
‘Just try to get it down as quickly as you can,’ Marigold added.
He didn’t mind so much when Draco was the one “handling” him. But Ron – Ron! – had bloody been there stealing that dragon too and yet they were perfectly willing to let him just wander on in and set up his very own vault. And really –
Ron laughed and Harry turned away from his friend to glare at the air above the goblin leading the way. Harry hadn’t been given the goblin’s name, he’d just been hustled off to the side the moment he’d set foot inside Gringotts, surrounded by angry looking security goblins and then been forced to wait while they ran through exactly what he was and wasn’t allowed to do while in the bank. Again. As though they hadn’t made it clear every other time he’d tried to set foot in Gringotts since they’d lifted his ban – conditionally, of course.
‘No, that will be all.’
He put on the blank mask of arrogance his parents had helped him create and started on the food Luna piled on his plate with only a softly murmured, ‘Thank you.’
‘Oh Harry.’ Molly had sniffled once before she’d sprung out of her chair and practically launched herself around the table to envelop him in a tight hug.
Remembering the weekend spent cleansing the castle wasn’t especially pleasant. They hadn’t been the only ones to turn up a creepy sex trap and there’d been plenty of other things turned up during the extensive sweep. Spells and enchantments that had been in place for decades – some had been around working softly for centuries. Not all of them were harmful but they were all additions to the castle that shouldn’t have been there and had been overlooked during the summer’s initial sweep. Some had been overlooked by the restoration team who had been tasked with repairing the castle as they were not strictly checking for unwanted additional enchantments.
‘Hermione,’ Harry said again, giving Draco a bit of a nudge, and not feeling at all bad for distracting him with this. ‘She’s been acting a bit funny for a few days now.’
‘Mate,’ Ron spoke softly, words calm but firm, ‘I think you should go see Madam Pomfrey, get her to look you over.’
magic.
Ron nodded, not even pausing to think about it.
‘I don’t know,’ she admitted. ‘I don’t think you knew how to be friends, Draco.’
Harry likely looked a lot healthier than the last time Pansy had seen him too, when she’d tried to hand him over to the Dark Lord. Months of running and hiding in a tent with no proper food and a constant thrum of fear were almost as detrimental to Harry as Draco’s Azkaban stay. Although with a lot less physical maiming.
Hermione (somewhat) interrogates Harry.
‘What’s a bloody stupid idea?’ Ron asked, dropping onto the bench beside Harry at the end of the Hufflepuff table.
Draco pulled a face. ‘That’s a nightmare, Harry, and also has nothing to do with me. Try again.’
‘What?’
At least that’s how it would look later. Much later.
Hermione sputtered, ‘I’m sorry – what?’
‘Why the fuck not?’
‘It’s just gone eight,’ Hermione replied distractedly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shrugged, unconcerned. ‘It’s good to try new things.’
‘Hey,’ he grins and then frowns like he’s read something in Harry’s expression. ‘Did it not go well?’
Given Hermione’s fascination with their bond he didn’t see any reason not to explain, ‘I got another tattoo over the Christmas break. A snitch.’ He motioned over to Harry and the now covered tattoo. ‘It seems to travel back and forth between us at will.’
Harry seemed to be struggling to find the words to express just how much that meant to him – or possibly to try and defend Dumbledore, in which case he was coming up empty. Draco didn’t need him to say anything, Harry might have been the reason he pitched that addition to the plan to his mother, but Tom Riddle was another. How would things have been different if a young Tom Riddle had been with other children like himself. Would being with other magical children have changed things for the better or worse? Would it have changed things if there were competent and knowledgeable adults around who could recognise what young Tom had done?
And he didn’t know how to explain that to her when he didn’t want to explain it at all. There were pieces of himself he owed nobody, ones that he’d chosen to share with Draco because, it turned out, once he started talking to Draco he didn’t know how to stop. Everything with Draco was easy, even when it was hard. There were moments in those early days, when all he wanted to do was punch Draco in the face or hex him, but he kept going back. He kept seeking Draco out and Draco always welcomed him.
‘My feelings of inferiority,’ he answered sheepishly. ‘How I feel like I can never really live up to my brothers. How sometimes Harry makes me feel self-conscious.’ He looked at her nervously, eyes darting away before he said, ‘The feeling that I’ll never be good enough for you.’
Harry couldn’t take his eyes off the portrait and the same was true for Fleamont Potter. The painting might only have captured the memory and personality of the man but that was so much more than Harry had ever had before and he stared at it in wonder, taking in every detail he could. Green eyes soaked in everything from the dark mess of hair to the thick brows and the small scar on the side of his grandfather’s nose and the older man did the same. Fleamont scrutinised hair and scar, seeing the man who’d grown from the tiny baby he’d watched over all those years ago.
Draco could have kissed Harry for his casual shrug and his, ‘Yeah, I’m pretty sure it only turned out so well because he didn’t let me near it.’
‘Oh,’ she abruptly dropped the parchment in her lap. ‘I’ve just had a thought.’
If he’d thought people were looking at him and whispering about him before his duel with Harry, it was nothing compared to now. Before he’d been a Death Eater, yes, and students had thrown harsh words and curses his way but there’d been a lighter element to it. As though they’d been acknowledging him as a Death Eater while still viewing him as a kid, as just another student like them. The duel with Harry had altered that perception. Before, his being a Death Eater was an excuse to torment him, to curse him and jinx him for being a git and an ass who chose the wrong side. They’d treated him more as the son of a Death Eater than an actual follower of Voldemort and their spells and attitudes had matched that belief.
‘That’s honestly quite disturbing,’ she muttered under her breath.
This actually had Draco turning around as he stepped off the stairs onto the fifth-floor landing. Looking at Harry he was confused to see genuine bafflement. ‘Didn’t you have to sit through the lecture on safe sex in third year?’
Draco’s hand stopped running up and down his back and he started to snigger as he replied, ‘A group project, house unity, definitely some snogging in the library.’
It was Bill who said, ‘Okay, Draco, you can let the protections drop now, I’ve got them.’
Hermione actually growled at him. ‘He shouldn’t have a master at all,’ she snapped.
I have put Astoria's signs in bold and kept them blunt and to the point because she's only been signing for a year and Draco, a month or two. I am also aware that when signing sentence structure is a bit different but it's been about fifteen years since I've had to sign anything more than the alphabet or a thank you so I thought I'd just stick with this.
It wasn’t. Draco understood now that Hermione had been doing everything she could to stand by Harry, even if that meant tolerating Draco, because she fully expected it to blow up in their faces. She was expecting Harry to get hurt, for Draco to do something that would tear them apart, and that she wanted to stay by Harry’s side to be there when it did.
Oh, so, that's because you were stalking me.
“You mean if I had any fantasies of a sexual kind?” Draco nodded. Harry scratched his head, ruffling his hair even more than usual, and said “I mean, I don’t know, maybe once or twice?”
This mug is horrendous.
How do you know that exactly ?
You don't know it, you think people are open-minded and they throw you out of your house without any warning.
Have you seen him since the end of the Eighth year?
I'll still have a word with Neville, whether you like it or not.
I had other priorities, I think it was a war, heard of it ?
There's nothing wrong with trying to be cordial, I'm friend with Hermione, and she's friend with you and this adorable ginger person.
adventurous, trouble is nothing for me, I live for trouble.
Even knowing that it's Ron's?
I don't need to hear that thank you.
An intellectual reading huh?
Oh, so we're back to this subject? Very subtle.
He heard Harry hum in response, too distracted by what he was doing to really care about what his boyfriend was babbling abut (he babbled a lot according to him, Draco called it casual chatter and never missed to say that he at least had conversation).
What is it?
“Really?” Harry’s voice was a bit hoarse, he coughed and carried on, “I think I may have eaten too many pies Hermione made.”
They're fluffy and look at their little eyes, don't you find them adorable?
I am being nice to you, can't you say something nice too ?
She did, and I still resent her for that. And before you ask, yes, it was for that reason.
Is caring about other people's well being obsession?
That's what I just said and please refrain from insulting her.
Why did you hesitate?
I personnally think that's part of her machiavelous -you do know this word, right ? Oh, don't give me that look-, plan she probably named 'marvellous Draco and sad sad Harry's friendship adventure'.
Draco raised an eyebrow. He didn’t have to speak, Harry knew this eyebrow meant either an interrogation mark or a spiteful remark was going to come out of Draco’s lips.
I already told you that I wasn't. Anyway, I actually knew you were gay, I'm not as oblivious as you think I am, I can read a situation.
Alright, but I continue to say that it's not healthy.
You weren't reared in a wizard family, a wealthy wizard family. The values you are told are not the same as the ones you heard from your muggles relatives.
And I can assure you that you will stay Malfoy.
My childhood wasn't miserable, thank you.
Potter, you are Potter and will never be anything more.
'Can't I come with you and Pansy ? I think talking about books for three hours will be more interesting than with somebody who has the vocabulary -and the mindset- of a six year-old.'
'Oh, I'm happy to know that you're still the same old narcissistic bloke.
People don't want to talk about it, don't want to see it. Stupid bravery won't change it.
Nobody has ever described me this accurately, you understand me Potter, I'm moved.
A Malfoy's compliment is valuable, but to come back to your ignorance-"
How vain can you be?
Right.
And you think it would displease me?
Draco’s voice rose behind him as he was starting he engine. « Why do you insist on mowing the lawn by yourself? A house elf could do it” The simple question brought up numerous answers. Because he liked to do things “the muggle way”. Because it reminded him of Summers at the Dursleys where the only moment he could be alone with his thoughts was when the buzz of the lawn mower covered all the sounds. The cars driving by, taking and dropping people, the children screaming, his cousin’s mocking giggles, his aunt’s shrill cried, his uncle’s loud growls. Because he didn’t want to use a house elf for something he could do by himself. It was one of the perks of not having been reared in an aristocratic family. Even though they didn’t talk much about it, there was still a social and educational gap between them. Harry chose the last reason. Talking about muggles was still too touchy and he didn’t want for the Dursleys to ruin his mood.
It's unfair.
Caution.
Weirdly imaginative ? I'm happy to know you value my imagination. Wait, you're not trying to be friendly are you ? I thought we had a silent agreement.
No! The-the tea is ready.
I don't know...
“I didn’t know he was a model… Wait, you recognized him?” Harry asked a bit lost. He didn’t think Draco knew Oliver Wood that much, he probably was aware of the fact that he had been captain of the Quidditch team, but Draco had had trouble remembering Seamus’s name and face (too average for him he said, but Harry was convinced he faked it), so how could he remember someone he had not seen in a decade?
I already said that we won't have this conversation.
Are you fine Malfoy?
More like you stalk them.
Hermione left us three hours to talk things out, I think we could be reasonable, admit that we have qualities and flaws and that we are human beings who can get on. Whatever our past may be. We're twenty-four, we should be able to leave everything behind us and start anew.
She told me she would reveal all of your shameful secrets to me and I had to tell her all about Pansy.
Neville is a kind man, she is happy with him.
this?
What silent agreement ?
“I always come for you”, Harry winked and stifled a laugh when Draco turned an “I’m not amused” face mixed with a “why did I accept to go out with you again?” face to him.
'Adults who behave like teenagers. I know you have a past but moving on is a part of the experience of adulthood. You're twenty-four for Merlin's sake. »
Quit mumbling Potter, that's not pleasant to hear.
You see value in people only if they are attractive?
Oh, I don't. I've never felt more liberated than after that.
Being a Malfoy is not solely who you are, I am not defined by my last name.
Draco’s breath hitched, he wetted his lips, and croaked. “You know I can’t turn down an invitation so… inviting.” Harry smiled and let himself be led into the house by Draco’s hand.
We're talking about Longbottom, he would apologise to dementors for causing them trouble.
I know what you're thinking, it wasn't as bad as you think. At least I was loved.
Thank you Potter. Talking with you was oddly pleasant, I didn't think you had this in you. Well then, see you. I'll send you an owl to let you know.
“Git, you know who I’m talking about” Draco said. There was no way he was directly asking Harry, he didn’t want to look that interested.
She wouldn't come up with a name that stupid, she is clever not weirdly imaginative.
Fine.
'Alright, Harry you sit here, Draco you sit in front of him...'
Draco shrugged, “I don’t know, I’ve always liked fictional works, and a lot of it is fiction so that’s ok with me”.
It is my business ! Making fun of you is not challenging anymore, you're making it too easy.
I'm trying to be sympathetic here.
“He said he will try to come, from what I’ve heard he’s very busy these days.” Harry shrugged. Wood was still a professional quidditch player from what he knew add to this his modelling and other charity he did and he was not the most available man in the Wizarding world.
I thought Hermione told you.
'Great'
“Technically speaking I’m not wrong, she is a Weasley, and the only woman to boot”, Harry’s look stopped Draco’s explanation, he raised his hands and mumbled “alright, alright”. “So, is there any chance that former players of the gryffindor quidditch team, let’s say for example a keeper, would come to the party?”
Can I carry on answering you or do you want to have the last word everytime ?
True, but the Ministry -and the majority of the society- won't even hear of it, so yes, Pansy and Hermione had better be hiding whatever was going on between them.
I have tickets for a quidditch match : Tutshill Tornados vs Holyhead Harpies. I thought you would maybe want to see it.
Good for you.
Give me this mug back.
Your model childhood ?
How could she do that to her only child?
“It’s already messed up anyway.” It has been since he was born.
My marvelous mind is my greatest flaw, you are right Potter. What
Oh, what a joyous day, we agree on something.
I wouldn't trust Lovegood with something edible... Who knows what's in her herbal tea?
I like my dull life if it enables me to stay alive and not defeat dark wizards.
Why did she agree on that?
Blaise's, he's been kind enough to lend me his guest room, I'm considering finding another flat, you see he wants Tracey to move in with him and I'm in the way.
“Is that an invitation?” Draco smiled. It wasn’t his seducing, I-can-make-every-witch-and-wizard-fall-for-me smile, but a more earnest one, just Draco’s open smile, and it made Harry glad he dropped by Draco’s shop one afternoon five months ago.
“Well, I think it’s because someone doesn’t know how to cook.” Harry said.
To the point of not even using my own hands?
“I think I need a shower. Care to join me?”
Harry wasn’t paying attention to what he was saying mainly because he was busy pushing the lawn mower. Plus, Draco had insisted on putting a silence charm around him. Too much noise for him, could have terrible headaches, not possible, huh huh. While Harry was busy imitating Draco in what Draco would have qualified as a childish manner, Draco cancelled the silencing charm and cast mild sonorous charm.
I-I don't know what to say.
“It’s not important in his case but in other cases you always complain about some people’s conversational skills” Harry crossed his arms, he didn’t want to appear sulky but it was clear that he was pouting.
You're a lost cause.
'That's exactly what I'm planning on doing. And let me tell you this : if when we come back you are not sharing a heartfelt moment of friendship, I'm going to be mad, furious even, and you don't want to endure that.'
It was a remark, nothing else, don't be so uptight. Oh, can I have this mug?
Very funny Malfoy.
That doesn't seem too complicated. I'll consult my schedule and see if I can.
Even knowing that it's Weasley's.
'Pansy and I are attending a meeting for our reading circle, we'll be out from one pm to four pm. I want you two, no, I demand an exemplary behaviour of you. '
No, she was just in your circle of friends, so I knew about her, that's all.
Draco hummed, “How I understand you, he was already terribly charming at the time.”
She's the only who offered you that?
I knew before anyone because I observe people Potter, I study them and then I draw conclusions. That's called using your brain.
'Oh my, we know a big word Potter ! My my, what will you learn tomorrow ? Should I tell you a new word or will your poor brains explode ?
Oh, they weren't technically dating, I don't think they saw each other much, or at least talked much.
No, and I'm glad for that.
“Let’s get back to Wood shall we?” Draco asked, interrupting Harry’s internal monologue.
