She plopped down on Draco’s bed. ‘Potter has been attacking you since second year and you always defended yourself. Why not now? Did you forget what to do? Panic?’
. You cannot ignore me, forget me, rat out my family, steal the Snitch from right under my nose, beat me senseless, and go on in one fell swoop to claim to the world that you are in
Pansy clung onto Draco. It yielded her a withering look from her mother, who grabbed her daughter and hauled her away to a circle of girls a little further away. Draco heard her hiss something about ‘always hanging out with boys’ and ‘no suitable company for a young lady’, while the other guests spread out across the garden again.
Finally Draco saw, with sudden clarity, what everyone else had always seen: Harry Potter was a self-centred bastard. He only ever wanted Draco on his own terms. He only wanted Draco to
Draco was musing softly now, like they were having an intimate conversation. ‘They say if blackbirds look straight at you while singing, it means you’ll meet the love of your life.’
‘I can assure you,’ Draco’s father went on, ‘Mr. Yaxley here is the best duellist of my generation. I have seen him at it, and you do not want to be on his bad side.’
Draco sighed. He couldn’t even blame him, really; life was a lot easier with that pendant around your neck. At least he gave it back now.
Draco shivered. This couldn’t be happening. All alone, in his beautiful robes, with no one to admire them. Inside the Great Hall, he could hear the Weird Sisters being announced. For a moment, Draco thought about going in on his own, but he realised he couldn’t care less about any band anymore. He just wanted to know why Harry didn’t show up.
Smirking to himself, Draco clattered to the library to start revision for Transfiguration straight away. He had to at least do better than the famous Potter.
‘Well,’ said Draco, ‘partly, Potter. But there are other benefits, too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.’
"Here, Draco," Hermione called, "I've got it," and at the same time, Draco got to his feet, stepped over the Weasley girl, and ripped the diary from her hands.
"You may fit anywhere, and you may fit nowhere," the Hat singsonged. "You might be fearless like a Gryffindor. But you might be too cruel to ever belong in that house. You might be brilliant and inventive like a Ravenclaw. But you might let your wisdom be overshadowed by revenge. You might be loyal like a Hufflepuff to the memory of your mother. But you might betray even her someday too-"
Mother was staring at him, watching him stand there silently shaking. At least he hadn't drawn his wand. "Never mind," Draco said, and walked out of her dressing room in such a fury, he almost
"Then, I suppose you don't feel shame for very much. And of course you've succeeded at it. Good job, Draco. I really expected no less, from you."
"Is that why you forgot to close your curtains?" Harry laughed. He put Draco's book on spell creation aside, before drawing up his feet. Draco made a face, and Harry quickly kicked his shoes off, then cast Spelunca secure and Inmotus, showing how well Draco had taught him certain things. "Here, I'll feed you, then, you lazy dragon..."
." He tried to unobtrusively shift his weight backwards, but that threatened to send him falling over if he wanted to stay inside. He just ended up clinging to Potter more tightly in the cramped dark, with one of Potter's hands right against the side of his neck. "I suppose you've forced me in here not just to grope me, but because you expect me to save your chosen arse? I hoped to avoid being dragged into any more of your Gryffindor follies, but the year hasn't even started, and already-"
"Weasley's rat, of course," she said irritably, and pulled the flap down lower to show bars beneath the mesh, between which peered out the terrified face of Scabbers.
"Stolen," Draco hissed without thinking, "Stolen power," hand tightening around his wand in his pocket. He grinned wider at her confused look. "It's just my wand, Professor. That's what makes me seem so special. I just have a wand with more power than anyone else."
Moreover, they had friends in common, which meant that they could throw themselves together into planning Hermione a seventeenth birthday party. Seventeen was an adult in wizarding terms, though Hermione said she would still be considered a minor by Muggles. But she
As soon as Draco cast Legilimens, he was inside, although in Draco's experience, that might be his own fault. Harry's ability to keep him out seemed inversely proportional to how much Draco had flirted with him before the attempt. Harry must have gotten very hot and bothered, because the images came flashing with clarity, no less so than in their first session:
"We can talk about all that later." Draco checked his watch. "But it's getting late, and we'll be living together, so that's what we have to address." He'd been pleased to see there were six beds now, one with Draco's trunk beneath it. It wasn't a tight fit in the very spacious Ravenclaw Tower. "You've all been sharing for five years, and here I am, inserting myself. So you'll all feel more comfortable if you know what to expect, right?"
"Azkaban is awful! Would not recommend!" Draco called out helpfully, before a glare from Ron and Potter made him shut his mouth.
"And if we lose," Pansy said, "You have to let us ritually burn all seven of them in the common room fire?"
this is. I have to go." But Harry called out to wait. "Don't worry, I'll tell you all about it after, okay, I promise?" Draco said, with no intention of following through. "Here," he said, and left the bag from the Manor beside Hermione, before walking as fast as he could out of the pub.
"Oppugno!" Harry shouted, and suddenly, improbably enough, Draco had to deal with the one other object in the room, the glass observation cage, attacking him. "Expelliarmus!" Harry shouted, ganging up on him along with the rolling cage, and the red light hit the top of the glass and exploded it over Draco as he ducked.
Draco laughed, and mimed tugging out Ron's eyeballs, pulling them to his mouth, and happily slurping them up like escargot.
The train sped on, with an almost suspicious normality to its progression. Neville's plant story ended up livening things up after all, once its climax was reached with the arrival of his exciting new birthday present. He produced the hideous 'Mimbulus mimbletonia' from his bag, which by all appearances seemed to be a cactus that had been infected with the bubonic plague.
He sped back through the Honeydukes cellar and the secret passage to Hogwarts with an excitement that made a trek he usually complained about seem rapid and effortless. He went straight back to the dungeons, and found Severus still in his office to tell. "Outside Grimmauld Place," he said with a frown, and Draco showed him a London map that Hermione had bought him and some Polaroids of the street. "12 Grimmauld Place. The old Black family townhouse?"
Severus's face remained in his hands longer than Draco would have imagined of him, for any show of weakness, if it was weakness submerged under that makeshift mask. When the face finally emerged from behind it, it was a new kind of mask, which Draco could not have described except to say it was cold. "Very well, then. By all means, in April. A high time for a Hogwarts class reunion."
But he prevented one neatly when his spell detected a man behind one of the doors. He flung the door open and cast Expelliarmus before a preoccupied Karkaroff could react. Karkaroff's wand flew to Draco's hand, zooming past a room full of maps. "Look, Igor," Draco drawled, "
!" Draco yelled, and the candles in the air went up higher without him meaning to. "And you're Harry Potter's best friend! You're the one he chose, aren't you, Weasley?" He turned on Potter, the real object of his disappointment. "You're Harry Potter!" Or he had been, unless Draco had ruined things with Granger somehow, and the world was going to end because these two wandering ventriloquist dummies would be sans ventriloquist.
"What," Draco yawned to Potter's trio as he joined them outside the entrance, "Could possibly be important enough to justify disturbing my practice at blood magic?"
of Harry's possessions?" Ron groaned, Firebolt clearly on his mind as he shook his head, and Hermione looked speechless. Hermione was quivering so hard, clutching her heavy books to her chest, Draco almost feared she might topple over the railing. The sound of the party kept coming through in fits and bursts even through the closed portrait hole, like another source of condemnation.
Phineas's wand flew to him. "Really?" he said after, looking almost disappointed as he pocketed it. "I expected
been talking to, actually. The moment we got back, he went straight for her, pulled her aside, and they've been spending lots of time whispering together since."
Draco stayed with the others through the ceremony, but when the stands began emptying, he went in the opposite direction from his friends and the Weasleys. "Draco, we're all going to celebrate with Harry, you heard," Hermione said, and Draco rolled his eyes.
the mountain, these endless steps up and up, out into the center of the castle. They said the passage predated Grindelwald, it was why he'd chosen the location, but it's since been closed- ever since the decision was made that if Grindelwald kept on for decades more corrupting visitors, they just wouldn't allow him any more of them."
"No." Draco rolled his eyes. But he couldn't explain that they had been in the blue loop. By that rationale, Harry should still end up with Ginny. If Draco needed anything to spoil his day, that was a good thought for it.
"It could be worse," Luna said brightly. "He's found out he's a pyromancer, apparently, and that's not just divination, that's fire manipulation. So he's plotting for the
"Evil? Not quite," a lighter voice said from behind them, and they turned to see Albus Dumbledore stepping in through the rubble.
Or not. Harry was running away from him, towards the broken grave and past it. He was running right for Draco, where he was lying on top of Wormtail, his hands still bound. Voldemort was yelling to stun him, and Harry dodged the red light, hiding behind an angel. Draco saw Harry's silhouette lit up in red in front of the dark angel wings, before he called out, "Lacarnum inflamari!" There was a wall of flames, a real firestorm surging between everyone but them and the corpse.
Harry Potter... but it almost seemed to her like she could understand what the snake was saying, so she knew it didn't mean any harm... really, none of you even noticed that? She nearly gave the whole game away..."
"A stone that makes gold and stops you ever dying!" said Potter, because the uneducated were always getting astonished at everything.
"I ran into her on the way and told her I needed to speak to you first." Remus and Sirius had both been in residence at Hogwarts since the events of the Third Task, Sirius largely in Animagus form. "And call me Remus, please. We haven't had a chance to talk in some time, have we, just you and I? Not since I was leaving my position at Hogwarts. Do you remember what you said to me then?"
Sirius's scream echoed throughout Courtroom Ten, the civilized veneer over the proceedings dropping, as the depths of the anguish of Azkaban was let loose into the heart of the Ministry. It was like a Dementor appearing in their midst, but instead of pulling at the onlookers, it froze them. No one spoke in the entire room for quite some time, and the only sound was the frantic scratching of Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill.
"It's not just romantic," Draco explained. "It's the greatest desire of your heart, whatever that is. For Harry, it's seeing his dead parents, alive with him again. For Ron Weasley, he was Head Boy, Quidditch captain, winning the House Cup, all that. For Hermione Granger, it was defeating the Dark Lord and all of us living through it. You get it?"
of interest in men, it was hard to believe that attachment hadn't been at least slightly reciprocated, if perhaps never consummated. Lupin had let Black go, after all, while still believing him guilty of the death of three of his only friends in the world, two indirectly and one by his own wand. If Draco wanted to get control of this situation back, here was a lever to use.
Potter nodded manfully, though he looked like he'd rather be conducting a search party with Umbridge as company. Not that Potter had ever met Umbridge, and might never do so if the blue loop diverged enough...
"Okay. Here's how I operate. The Slytherins I lived with managed to deal with it, so I can't see why you all wouldn't, you're far more intelligent.
"Dracosanguis," he cast, and screams that had begun to quiet turned shriller than ever. The blood from where she hit her elbow falling began to burn. "Dracosanguis. Dracosanguis. Dracosanguis!" His eyes were sparking finally with excitement. "There, that's better, Elizabeth. Are you feeling it? Do you? Do you understand the pain now?"
"Better ride than the spiders!" Draco shouted rather hysterically, but he heard the two of them laughing, before the pipe unceremoniously ejected them all in a heap of slimy second-years. Draco's hand went immediately to check his wand at his side, but it was no more bent than usual. He took it out instinctively, and couldn't make himself put it back in his pocket.
"Draco?" he said softly, then looked around rapidly for onlookers or eavesdroppers. "Muffliato. What are you doing here? Has something happened?"
The images of stag horns, blue sheets, black feathers, the smell of Harry and amaranth swam through his mind. He dismissed it as a dream. "Yes."
The voice was Pansy's, and she was standing right in front of the fire without seeming to feel the impact of the blaze near her shins. She was fidgeting from foot to foot, with her hair pulled back half-up and with more make-up on than usual, socks black and going up to mid-thigh instead of her usual knee-high length. But Draco didn't have a ghost of a suspicion, mind going to Pettigrew again, until the entire common room burst out hooting and squealing. "Go on, Pansy!" some of the seventh-year girls called out, and Draco couldn't tell if they meant to be encouraging or mocking.
. I knew that woman when she was your age, and you have so much less in common with her than you ever might think. Blood, a wand, and power. Those are the three things. The

Sade's blood ourselves. You didn't want to have gone from rebuilding a castle Sade made to rebuilding another castle Sade made. From serving him to serving... his descendant." It was easy to forget Karkaroff's quiet, resentful presence in the rush of sickening realization, all the many things Gilderoy must have had in his head that he wouldn't say. "I don't remind you of him, do I?"
"I do not have all day, Adrast," Draco said, cold as the grave. "Or should I let your superiors at Gringotts know you lack full understanding of inheritance law in House Black, as opposed to less
"Third- to Mr. Harry Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room couldn't have been more silent. "...For pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."
A Bludger came hurtling from above, clumsily hit by Peregrine with a yowl. Potter dodged it cleanly, while despite Peregrine's shout, Draco saw it coming too late. He tried frantically to get out of its way, with it honing in so close to the ground-
Draco cast Theo and his lip-biting out of his mind, but Theo's concern bore unexpected fruit, not that evening but the next. Draco was reclining in his bed, reading the book Hermione had snuck him on wand science without his curtains locked- Severus's express orders, before he was deemed fully recovered. It made it easy for his dormmates to get his attention when they entered in a knot, unusually quiet.
"If it wasn't for libel law, they probably would have," Draco muttered. But he tried to put on his most unbothered expression, with more and more people reading their copies of the Prophet or being shown.
Draco had to repulse Harry's attempts to truly snog him into oblivion then. Even if Harry's tan made his eyes look even greener, and kissing put the most beautiful flush on those already very pink lips...
"Yes," Dantanian said with a shudder of revulsion. "I suppose I do. Now tell me who you wish to spare."
Draco nodded, pulled Ron away, and turned as he left to give her a teethy sort of a smile. He could see Cedric Diggory staring after him with more dislike than ever on that handsome face. But hey, maybe beautiful people like him and Delacour
"Why would I?" she said briskly. "You didn't choose this knowingly. And I don't know how many of those symptoms in that book for a coda you've experienced, but you'd told me already what you and Theodore Nott found out, about Astaroth the dragon. That was back in fourth year. This just makes that make more sense. If you've been hiding yourself away because you think you're a monster, Frankenstein, I'd appreciate it if you put
"It is." Draco kissed at the clothed shape. "I love how it feels in my mouth. You're so thick, and so
Finally, he started getting somewhere. "Underwater..." Harry said slowly. "What lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?"
It was such that Hermione found them at her evening visit, just under a half hour later, with two beds pulled to the side of Draco's for Potter and Ron to sit on, as Draco had refused to do them the dignity of getting out of bed, sitting up, or even getting out from under the covers. Potter and Ron both had their Potions textbooks out and were frantically jotting notes as Draco lounged answering their questions like a sultan awaiting obeisance. She was furious at first to find that Draco had agreed to help them where she had refused, until her know-it-all side seemed to get the better of her, and she was answering questions as well, and hazarding a tentative few of her own to Draco.
"Most of the judges-" Bagman's look at Karkaroff made no secret of the dissenter- "Feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks. However... Mr. Potter's score is forty-five points."
"Really, Draco? Did you have to put on such a performance just to request my help? If my father ever hears about the puerile
As Draco fled Severus's rooms, there was no hallucination like on the Hogwarts Express in his first year, but nor did he feel as though the Fiendfyre he imagined flaring to life inside Severus's shields was leaving him untouched. There was a curious kind of heat at his heels, a flickering warmth that only seemed to grow with each step he took away, as if the strength of whatever made the heat was growing and beginning to pursue him the way Fiendfyre did, licking at the back of his calves but still at something of a distance. Each time he turned, though, casting Lumos and even a Protego behind him several times in the darkness, nothing was following but his own shadow.
They comfortably resumed an old argument about nature vs. nurture and social conditioning as they reached the top floor. Hermione had to snag a book she had left in Regulus's room, which their major project was preparing to be Harry's room soon. For starters, they'd had to move a number of stolen items into Draco's closet. He'd tried to pretend he didn't get a kick out of potentially deadly dark artifacts sharing space with his best cashmere sweaters.
"Listen," Draco growled, "You're wrong, but it doesn't matter. I am the captain, and that's not going to change. For everyone who's tired of all this whining and carrying on like a bunch of first-year
"'Up in the Chamber where the secrets are stored, the Boy Who lived raised the Sword of Gryffindor'- Draco! Shut
you. And now you're ruining it! Of course you are! This is what I get for-" Draco opened his mouth, and she held up a hand warningly, not quite done venting her spleen at him. "And if you ever call me
"Well, take a look at me, Potter," Draco drawled, leaning back beside Potter and gesturing over his body. "No, seriously, go ahead. Take a look. Take a nice long look, yeah, as long as you please." He waited until he could see Potter's green eyes traveling over him. "That's a nice Gryffindor red that's put on your cheeks. Well, what do you see when you look at me?"
Draco only wished for Harry's confidence. It had been distressingly easy to get used to this, being able to touch Harry Potter almost whenever he liked. Some part of him felt he had the right, with Harry's initials around his neck.
He couldn’t imagine The Boy Who Lived appearing in front of the entire Wizengamot, just for defending himself in front of his own family. That sounded wildly excessive. Would they really expel their favourite wonderboy over something like that? And more importantly: had Harry really been attacked by a dementor? Out in the open?
It awakened him from a deep trance. He’d been standing in front of a bookcase, engrossed in a novel. By the feeling in his legs he’d been standing like this for, quite possibly, hours.
The end of his wand exploded. He watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike.
Draco wasn’t prepared for the Boggart. And he wasn’t prepared at all for this Potter. This Potter with his arms around Draco’s waist and love in his eyes.
It wasn’t just the tips of his fingers: both of Potter’s entire hands felt like hot packs. The warmth of them glowed straight through to Draco’s bones and warmed up his entire body. His skin tingled as Harry ran his fingers over the lines in Draco’s palm, the top of his hand, and along his fingers to stretch them.
As soon as he caught the Snitch, Harry headed straight for the ground. His eyes looked weirdly hazy and he seemed to only grip the broom with his legs. There was a yell from the crowd as The Boy Who Lived hit the mud with a splattering thud. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle.
,” said our beautiful local auror, his soft-spoken augury sending shudders through his subjects... Now, isn't that intriguing?’ The wireless man inhaled slowly through his teeth and laughed softly. ‘Oooh, you know we will keep a watchful eye, Mr Potter.’
‘Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,’ said Snape silkily. ‘Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you.’
‘Yesterday evening, Stanley Blake from Christie’s Coffee on the Corner was overheard saying “Can we please keep this out of the news?” An intriguing phrase. What is it, Stanley, that you are so desperate to keep hidden? What are you shunning from the light of day? If anyone has any information on what has been going on under our radar, please let us know. The people of Brookley deserve to stay informed.’
Grumbling, Draco tried to ignore the taunting of his house mates as he sat back in the window seat. ‘“Something has come up…” It’d better be Mabel’s Devil’s Snare, or every single ancestor in our graveyard. I’m not a freaking crup they can dump wherever they like. I could just stay here, you know, like a bloody orphan. See how they like that.’
The other two curses – the Cruciatus Curse and the Killing Curse – had been forbidden to practice by Draco’s mother at the last minute. Apparently, she did not want the Slytherins to be “trained as child soldiers.” Father and Mr. Yaxley were clearly miffed about this, and Draco wondered how his mother had even convinced them.
‘Galloping gargoyles… Good thing I didn’t know that.’ Draco blinked and squinted. ‘Was Weasley Rapier? He cracked me up.’
Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now. Draco straightened the paper with a flourish and read on.
‘I bloody hate interviews, you git.’ Harry tried to stay calm. ‘I'm on duty. I just wanted to inform you of my investigation.’
Draco followed Harry’s eyes, drifting from the table, and saw Ravenclaw’s seeker, Cho Chang. His heart fell. Maybe Pansy was right when she’d said Draco was out of sight, out of mind with Potter.
Instinctively, he had backed away, before noticing it looked stunningly beautiful. As it circled around them, it made Draco feel all kinds of things he wouldn’t expect to feel at that moment. Sat in the cold, damp grass, laughed at by the entire school as he struggled to get out from underneath a huge cloak, with his hair looking messy and a red hot face… Draco felt safe, loved and blissfully content.
‘Fascinating… Troubled young man…’ Father leaned his head on his index finger, staring at the ceiling for a few seconds before shooting his next question. ‘What does he want in life? His hopes and dreams, if you may.’
Draco was shaking on his legs, but the boy walked on, sniggering fondly. ‘She’s a snorer.’ He patted the dragon behind the ears, looking half in love with it. ‘Isn’t she gorgeous?’
As quick as he could, he tore his gaze away from the lashes and the smile and the scar. ‘This potion is so easy, you might as well leave,’ he said. ‘I have no need for you at all.’
Draco turned around… and in walked his Boggart – or, no… it was probably the real Harry Potter. Almost dropping his wand, Draco jumped away from the box.
Lee Jordan’s commentary rang through the stadium and Draco listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing.
Harry looked up at him, slowly blinking away the misty look in his eyes until it faded to a frown. He shook his head as if to wake himself up.
Harry wished Draco ran a tv show instead of a wireless show, so he could watch him in his highest  form: all fired up.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. He glanced at Pansy and Zabini, who quietly wished him and Nott good luck. Draco walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand.
want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around… they’re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.’
Draco lifted his head to look at him. ‘Are you joking?’ he snarled. ‘What do you mean “what boy?” Who cares
Still, he’d gotten away with the least injuries of them all, he realised, not letting the Gryffindors leave unscathed either. That should count for something.
A hand clasped Draco’s shoulder. ‘Interesting,’ Father drawled coldly. ‘We knew they were stupid, but this is a new low.’
Draco felt restless. This conversations was such a repetition of moves. They kept going over it: who could be the heir of Slytherin, who would be the next victim – it was infuriating not to know. He wanted to go out and investigate, but no – ‘Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it.’
It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.
‘Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,’ Draco went on. ‘He’s another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he’s Slytherin’s heir! I wish I knew who it is,’ said Draco petulantly. ‘I could help them.’
‘He keeps drifting off to follow the Chasers,’ said Bletchley with a pondering frown, ‘leaving the center hoop completely open. Rookie mistake.’
Some Gryffindors had painted a large banner on some bedsheets, saying Potter for President with a large lion underneath. Draco wished he’d thought of it. No, wait – they were the enemy.
‘Is that you, little Abraxas?’ called his Auntie Mabel Malfoy, who drank herself to death in the eleventh century down in the Malfoy’s wine cellars, after her fifth and last child had moved out.
"We are forced to inform you that further dealings with him will be the death of the honest pride with which we have always considered you. We would blush to see you, to hear of you, to think of you."
It was his favourite thing to say, “Potter and I”. If he hadn’t been a Malfoy, he’d definitely have shortened it to “Potter-n-I”, as if it was just one word; as if the two of them were a package deal.
Draco was too angry to back down. ‘I do not appreciate being put on the spot like that, father. You knew I was not in the position to decline, for the sake of harmony –’
But Draco was watching Harry closely. He leaned across the table. ‘Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?’
The gang of girls laughed like they’d never heard a better joke in their life. Draco glared at them.
Potter looked terrified. Clutching his stomach, Draco sank down on the chair. ‘Potter… what the fuck.’
The great black dog gave a joyful bark and gambolled around the group, snapping at cats and owls and chasing its own tail. Potter seemed highly entertained by this and couldn’t stop laughing.
He became aware of his arm leaning on Draco’s knee; he left it there, walking his fingers up and down Draco’s leg.
‘Harry!’ said Percy loudly. ‘For the hundredth time: no magic in the corridors. I’ll have to report this again!’
Smirking, Pansy grabbed Draco’s arm and took him to the furthest corner of the Great Hall, where Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him to tell them what he saw and heard. They were rapidly firing questions at him and theorizing about all sorts of thing.
The door flung open with a flourish, making Harry flinch back instinctively, as a silver-blonde man in light jeans and a colourful shirt leaned his forearm in the doorway, crossing his legs at the shins. One of his sleeves was rolled up tightly around his bicep to keep a pack of cigarettes tucked between skin and fabric. He appraised Harry with a lazy sneer, clearly not at all surprised to see him.
to see you make your hands dirty, my heartbeat, you know how much of a turn-off a working woman is to me.’ He punctuated his words with his walking stick, ‘Dirt! Callus!’
‘Oh really?’ Draco's voice was so dripping with challenge that even Harry recognized the provocation.
Lupin sat down, looking more gloomy than ever before. He nodded. ‘Yes. I understand. If you want, I’ll turn in my resignation. Let me know.’
Sauntering across the lawn, she grumbled, ‘Bet you two Galleons Crabbe and Goyle are eating my food.’
Draco pretended to put the pamphlets into a certain order, buying himself time to think, while Snape sat perfectly still in his chair.
It was safe to say that Draco’s entire being shut down. For solid seconds, his mind went completely blank, his muscles gave up and every cell in his body seemed to be fruitlessly gasping for breath.
Draco blinked, wondering if this was a card he should have kept to his chest. ‘Well, I cannot be sure of course, I am only fifteen –’
‘Master Malfoy,’ complained the portraits of his ancestors, squinting in the light, ‘this is no hour for a walk!’
The first reaction Draco spotted was not Oliver Wood’s, but Harry Potter’s, who seemed barely able to hold his laughter. When their eyes met, Harry picked up his chin defiantly, grabbing his broom as if he was keen on taking off straight away.
"Sit down, Severus," Remus said, guiding him into a chair in the living room. "Sit down and we can talk about this like responsible adults. All of us. And no more talk of Harry's parents, please. No more talk of the past. Just the present. Harry and Draco,
"An ordinary, common, or garden rat like this can't be expected to live longer than three years or so," said the witch, which sounded to Draco's ears like this rat must have special powers of longevity if nothing else. "Now, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these..."
I'm spending so much time with Ron and Harry. So I can convince them you're innocent! I have this project, I can't tell you yet, it's why I've been so busy, but it's for
"Wizard? What kind of nonsense is that?" Frederick barked, walking over to ensure the door to the small sterile room was shut. "My son was
Draco found it difficult to understand the chants, let alone to sing along with Mr. Granger. But he did enjoy when Mr. Granger would point out the threatening parts, such as
"Oh, stood over there, did they?" said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. "Said an incantation, did they? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy- watched your little Death Eater friend do it, did you?"
"Lacarnum inflamari," Draco tested. The fireball soared into one of the walls and singed it, but was absorbed well enough. Satisfied in his choice of venue after all, he went to find his second.
And she had asked him a question. He had never thought he would care this much about letting someone down easy, let alone someone who wasn't even his friend. But their relationship in the blue loop made him feel irrationally guilty for not repeating it, as if he was cruelly discarding her, when this Pansy had no claim on him besides her own disappointed fantasies. "Pansy, I'm gay." Was there a way to rig up a button he could push and it would say that phrase for him?
He turned towards Voldemort before he cast, and the green light shot out of his wand, a great emerald burst of it, in the most perfect of déjà vu there in the darkness.
Nothing went smoothly when it came to him and Hermione's plans with Black. Draco's Quidditch season being over meant he had a lot of free time. But Draco barely spoke to Hermione for the first couple days after break anyway, on account of her having told
Draco rose to his feet. "Speaking of my godfather," he said with a forced smile, "I think you've been right, Hermione, that I should talk to him. Bury the hatchet and all. It's bury the hatchet or bury the hatcheted, right?"
Severus eyed him scowling. "There, now if you would kindly refrain from impeding your own rescue..."
Grindelwald's eyebrows raised, looking more tickled to have gotten out that reaction than he would have been by obsequious praise. "So genocide is
"YES!" Draco cried out, pumping his fist. He saw owls delivering a dozen other copies to students at the other three tables. No self-respecting Slytherin would have subscribed. But Draco had the feeling issues would soon be circulating the school at a record pace. He remembered copies passed around even Slytherin well after Umbridge's decree against them. He opened his, found the article, and there were several better pictures of Harry in there, especially one Rita had taken of him when he wasn't looking, staring out the window pensively during a break in the interview. Yeah, threat of expulsion or not, Draco was going to hold onto this issue.
like this! I want to be happy for Neville! For everyone! For you and Theodore bloody Nott! And- I know you'll say there's nothing there, I just-" His hands had gone to fists on his lap, and they trembled. "There's just so many things I want that I'm never going to get. And I- I suppose that- I suppose I just need to
"When we kissed under the mistletoe," Harry sighed out, and Draco smiled. "If I just hadn't pulled your hair, then maybe..."
"No," Luna gasped, and buried her face in Hermione's hair. Hermione shot Draco a look over Luna's shoulder. He wondered if Hermione was thinking what he was. In that moment, he wished he had never gone back in time, if this was what he had done to Luna.
"Mr. Potter," Fudge greeted Potter, who got up to shake his hand, though hardly so officiously as Peter, who broke his glasses bowing. Draco stayed sitting, remembering the man's ostrich strategy when it came to Voldemort. When Fudge made his best condescending effort to greet Potter's friends, his resources went completely dry when it came to a green-haired Draco. "And, ah, you must be, ah..."
? Of course I wouldn't want to be friends with you if you're that kind of people, if that's what you believe, because it's
But he was not finished. With the delicate touch she had taught him for removing her jewelry for her after galas, he took the Black sigil earrings out of her ears, pocketing them beside her wand. "I'm giving these to Luna," he said, before he left her and ran down the steps of the library tower.
Though that had to be Draco himself imagining it. Neither of them seemed sane at all, or even truly aware. Neither was moving towards him, but Mrs. Longbottom still had her hand raised, fingers outstretched in the air now, terrible and beseeching. For what, he could not know. It felt for all the world like he was the one who had done this to them, the one who had put them there, and this
Highbury was a tumult, reminding Draco of nothing so much as when he had attended the Quidditch World Cup in fourth-year. Though despite his jokes to Hermione, he did believe this match was far less likely to end in dark magic and chaos. Or at least he hoped. This did seem to be truly an excessive number of Muggles to pack into a small space. This tube thing they had used to arrive there had been so crowded, Draco had almost decided a vanishing cabinet would be a superior way to travel.
By the last day before the Hogwarts Express, Draco had at least gotten his bags packed, sent letters to reassure his friends, ordered a lovely pair of replacement pajamas for Luna, kept harm from befalling his all-precious wand, gotten a large supply of numbing potions to bring to Hogwarts, and completed a full list of objectives. He hadn't stuck to all his second year objectives, but he might have if he hadn't lost his mind that one moment in the Gryffindor common room, and run off with Riddle's diary in broad daylight like a common Hufflepuff. He had a bad pattern of resolving not to involve himself, then choosing to at the last minute. He had once again at the World Cup, but that would be his last deviation from carefully-laid plans. He was older and wiser now, and he had an unalterable plan, albeit one that did unfortunately begin with,
"Because I'm going to be an Unspeakable." Over and over, until maybe they would get the message, and the first-year Slytherins would do what everyone in all the other houses and years did, and leave the quiet scowling Malfoy boy alone.
here? I don't want... I can't be the same... this useless coward! I wanted to save Sirius... because he, he can change,
. That he was everything he'd said he was, and that he hadn't been a monster who used you and made you do awful things. It's not like you saw him as he was in the Chamber of Secrets. You saw the fantasy he made. The lie. You saw it coming true. And maybe that's... maybe it's that it would be like taking it all back, all the awful things that happened to you, making it right." Draco bit his lip, trying not to let his voice crack as he said, "Going back in time, almost. Making the bad things never have happened. Redeeming them."
in Slytherin. I asked for Gryffindor, over and over, and the hat wouldn't even consider it. Just said I could never be a Gryffindor."
said a weak voice in Draco, though most of him was cringing at his inability to obey a Death Eater, like he knew he was supposed to. But it was good to see Wormtail suffer. He wanted the whole world to suffer for whatever this was, whatever was left of Draco before he could climb down gratefully under the ground where it would be warm...
Draco's memory came to him clearly. "I'd think it was a transparent attempt to manipulate the public. Remind them you're poor orphaned victim Potter who deserves their sympathy, all their coddling to make up for the parents he never had, so it's only right for him to be given the world."
"So what you're describing," Blaise said calmly, "Is not a personal dislike, but an ideological chasm." Vince and Greg looked confused. "He's saying he didn't stop being friends with us because he hates us. He's saying he stopped because he knew we wouldn't hold with him running around with all those Gryffindors."
"Yes, we were getting our wands together," Potter said, an astonishingly charitable rendition of events. "This is Draco-" He faltered when he didn't know Draco's last name, because Draco hadn't actually told him. He should have, to have avoided Potter's excruciating fumbling before he had to fill in for him,
He grabbed Draco's hand and forced his finger beside the faces of Frank and Alice Longbottom in the long photograph of the Order of the Phoenix, standing there together picturesque as could be, before they had gone mad. The panicked squeaking sounds of the spider, despite the peacefulness of the photograph, almost seemed to be emanating from within it. "Pass the photograph around the class, Malfoy, and point out the witch and wizard that
?" he gasped, grabbing at his stomach as it began to hurt from laughing too hard. He got severe looks from the trio. "Millie thinks I'm trying to
"This is so ridiculous!" Hermione took up the theme. "He did nothing except try to defend us! You all just Apparated in and shot spells at us! He couldn't see you weren't Death Eaters! We all vouch for him, it wasn't his wand to do it, and just because he's a Malfoy, that doesn't mean-"
(In my head the one called Geralt is a cross between Geralt of Rivia and Gerard Way in his black parade ensemble. Although that’s probably historically incorrect.)
Draco and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad sniggered at that. It made Potter so angry he was shaking.
‘There’s four dragons and four champions,’ Zabini calculated, the little arithmetician, ‘probably not a coincidence, right?’
‘No. Absolutely not, thank you very much. Was it Rotilda again? No matter, I’m going to get a bit of food for the road.
Shivers ran across Draco’s spine and he almost giggled. Thankfully, he kept his cool, because that really would have been embarrassing.
He dragged himself down to Snape’s dungeon, just following Vincent and Gregory’s feet in front of him, but as soon as they arrived outside of the classroom, he was hauled into Pansy’s gang of girls, who shoved the article they’d been giggling about in his face without his consent.
‘Where’s Hagrid?’ asked Harry loudly. His eyes kept shifting to the hut, where all the curtains were closed.
‘Ssh!’ Draco’s forehead bumped into Pansy’s, trying to stifle the sounds of her shrieking laughter. ‘It’s not funny!’
Weasley turned a magnificent shade of scarlet, and Draco backed away when he made to whirl around, but then Harry quickly pushed his friend’s head down. ‘Don’t!’ Draco heard him hiss.
They stuffed his pockets and, still roaring with laughter, they pushed him out of the compartment with such force that he tumbled on the floor.
At half-past two on Monday, Draco was expected in Professor Snape’s office, which meant missing most of History of Magic. Not a great loss.
‘Indeed,’ Sprout said dryly. ‘Now, this ball will be open only to fourth years and above, although you may invite a younger student if you wish.’
Another one was a scrawny looking, mousy-haired Mudblood boy who kept walking around with a Muggle camera, looking at Harry like he personally saved the kid from a fire.
‘You know what I think?’ Pansy said softly, wiggling her eyebrows. ‘I think Potter loves pain as much as you do.’
He perched an eyebrow, but she seemed rather serious, so he put down his book and the quill with which he'd been scribbling his opinion into the margins. ‘What? Did someone die?’
Two figures had appeared out of nowhere at the entrance of the maze. They slammed to the ground and one of them was holding a large cup – the Triwizard Cup. The crowd went wild; the torrent of sound deafened Draco.
His breathing quickened, his heart raced. He knew he should stop this at once, lean back and duck away from the Boy Who Lived before it could get even worse –
'But, moonbeam, imagine the looks when our guest notice the same house-elf twice. What will we do?’ Mother rubbed Father’s arm and shoulders. ‘I
Snape pulled up a stool too. ‘Listen to me, Draco, if you play with things like these – well, it would be… prudent to prepare yourself for the very real possibility… that, at a certain point, your – ring
Draco didn’t dare look at his team mates. While their Wonderboy demanded everyone’s attention, Draco used the distraction to fly away. It was his first instinct, his natural reaction whenever something happened: flee. Get away as far as possible, as fast as he could.
‘Now, please!’ Father’s voice boomed through the manor, demanding immediate obedience. They had company, Draco surmised.
A hush fell over the onlookers. Of course, the Girl-Weasley was part of the crowd again too, staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified for her little crush.
Harry pursed his lips. He ran the people he’d met through his mind and wondered which one of those perfectly respectable-looking people was selling drugs to Draco Malfoy.
something going on! And there’s more than one person involved? What happens when you talk about them?’
‘Why him?’ said the voice, sounding oddly familiar. ‘Why his perfectly handsome face? Why that horribly beautiful coat? What does he want from us? He says he’s an auror. Well, we’ve all felt like an auror at one point or another. Why now? Why here? And just what does he plan to do with all those Sneakoscopes and Probity Probes, in that shabby condo he is renting – the one above Little Rico’s Pizza.’ The voice switched from brooding to cheerful: ‘No one does a slice like Little Rico. Come and have a taste! 50% off for all families, this weekend only!’
Harry burst out laughing. He quickly stifled it, but it was too late: Hagrid showed up and forced them to re-join the class.
Harry stopped dead in his tracks to stare at him; instant anger flared up in his eyes. ‘Burnt her sketchbooks?’
Harry inhaled sharply. His eyes swept over Draco – from his chest and his hands, to every inch of his face, at last coming to a halt at his lips. Draco stopped breathing in dazzled anticipation, but then Harry pressed an eye close as if he was looking into the sun. ‘Maybe,’ he said, ‘we could go on a date first?’
Under loud protests of his fellow Inquisitorial Squad members, he marched off. He would write to his father about this at once.
Draco was disappointed. After the way his father had talked about the Unforgivable Curses, his hands were itching to try them. Knowing he had to really mean it, he already knew the perfect victim for his first Cruciatus Curse. Draco couldn’t wait to restore the balance in that fragment of his life.
Madam Pomfrey seemed to be undecided whether to laugh or to preach at him. In the end, she just sighed. ‘So far,’ she repeated. ‘Try not to worry, alright?’
Zabini wagged his pinched fingers, which Draco took to mean something like, ‘The heck did she mean?’
On Sunday morning, after a long, long night and an even longer week of isolation in the hospital wing, Draco was staring out of the far window to the square of solid blue that was his only outlook on life these days. He was watching it turn from black to ink blue, to indigo, to –
His parents were standing by the large dining room window. Father had been holding his sleeve up to show Mother something, but before Draco could say ‘good morning’ his father had covered his arm again and Mother was pouring them all a bit of tea.
Professor Lupin seemed baffled. For a moment he considered what to do with Draco’s insubordination, then he stepped forward –
‘Kreacher is happy to help, sir.’ Facing the floor tiles, the house-elf kept muttering under its breath. ‘Nasty old blood traitors messing up my mistress’s house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they’ve let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, poor old Kreacher, what can he do...’
The clipping was still in his pocket when they arrived at their next Care of Magical Creatures lesson. Hagrid wasn’t there. Instead, Professor Grubbly-Plank, their replacement teacher, stood in front of the group.
They were all awfully quiet. No shouting or crying from Pansy, no grunting and grumbling from Vincent and Gregory, no reprimanding snarls from Snape – it had to be really bad.
Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, Harry was speeding towards the ground, towards the eggs, now unprotected by her clawed front legs.
‘Well, well, well – Arthur Weasley.’ Father was suddenly towering over Draco with his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
The group split up, and Draco rushed towards the Room of Requirements, where he snuck into a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase to await his enemy’s arrival. Not a second too soon, it turned out, because right that moment, a door blew open and Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors pelted away from it at top speed.
Lines appeared in his father’s forehead. He was studying the ceiling like there were tiny answers written on it. ‘Interesting…’
It made them both jump to their feet. The girl was glaring at Draco like she had the monopoly on Potter. It appeared all the Weasleys were as possessive of the Boy Who Lived as the Monkey-Weasley was.
Fleur Delacour was at the epicenter of one of the lovely bursts of snowy silver mist, highlighting her Veela heritage to full effect in her powder-blue Beauxbatons robes, and even Cedric Diggory seemed to fade in magnetism beside her. Ron was coming inside with Neville, Seamus, and Dean, but he stopped dead at that arresting sight. Draco called out a hello as he passed. When Ron didn't answer, Draco turned back around, and nearly had a heart attack at the sight before him: Ron striding up to Delacour with the same queasy determination on his face as he faced his Potions finals each year. Except in this examination, Draco could do nothing to help him.
For those curious about the dom/sub tag, that was kind of inevitable lol- I am, like, physically incapable of writing anything which does not have at least undertones that way. As I hope was shown previously, Draco is indeed the one with the bottom/sub vibes. Sorry for anyone who prefers the other way! I myself find it easier/more comfortable to write from the dominant perspective, but I think a lot about the psychology of my characters, and that is definitely the way I've drawn Draco in my head.
Peer pressure was a powerful thing, but fear could be the most powerful motivator of all. On one level, Draco supposed he had to be impressed they'd all had the nerve to openly defy him, however much they might regret it now. "Is it your fathers?" Draco asked, dropping to sit with them in their circle as just another member. "Are you worried what they'll think if you play on a team with girls? Don't think I don't understand that."
The next moment, footsteps sounded in the Hospital Wing, and Dobby pushed a finger to his own mouth, before turning to present it like a warning to Draco. Draco put a finger to his own mouth in acknowledgment, before peering his head around the bed and table to look towards the front of the wing. Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue, but which Draco recognized all too well. McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying the feet. Together, they heaved the boy onto a bed, before Dumbledore whispered something to McGonagall and she went off, coming back with Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. Her hands seemed to falter as she saw the statue of a boy that awaited her, a gasp coming out of her normally unflappable face that sounded eerie in the night.
"It's him! Harry Potter! Excellent work, Mr. Nott. 50 points to Slytherin. And..." She visibly paled at the sight of who was holding Harry, who looked to be thinking of drawing his own wand, while also deciding against it, face set like stone. Draco's face frightened Umbridge far more. "Mr. Malfoy. You... you must have been helping Mr. Nott at searching..."
They call us a new team? They're newer than us. We've known each other our whole lives. I know you all have many, many innumerable flaws-" He ignored Greg's mutinous rumblings. "But you know what I know each and every one of you isn't? A wimp! We've got a Keeper whose cat attempts her life on a regular basis, every time she lets that scoundrel Mr. Wilberforth out of his cage, but did she trade him in for another cat like a fucking coward?"
Despite what Draco had just told Longbottom, it did strike him as genuinely negligent, forcing students into the Forest like this, first-years at that. Hogwarts did seem extremely light when it came to child safety precautions.
"You tell him about testifying at the Sirius Black trial this summer?" Draco drawled. "No offense, Neville, but I think she might have you beat there when it comes to eventful summers."
Severus said nothing for a good, long while. "Is this belief of yours," he said finally, "Why you have not been speaking to the Potter or Weasley boy this term?"
"I don't know, he never hangs out around anyone male but Professor Snape, so," Ron joked, and Harry took him far too seriously.
"Are you under the Imperius curse?" Draco demanded, searching desperately for any explanation that made sense, because he knew the
Draco turned on his heel and took one, two running steps away, towards where he'd left the school broom in the hallway outside, towards his fastest way to avert a scene he had already known in the blue loop, a scene that once again it seemed he had been instrumental in bringing to life. Perhaps Hagrid's hut was already burning. And when Harry and Dumbledore returned-
Harry's face broke into partial relief. "Cleared," he said, "Of all charges," and Mr. Weasley beamed at him with the most paternal pride imaginable.
"Don't look at me like that," Draco drawled to Potter, who went red and quiet the moment Draco sat down. "Even the Heir of Slytherin needs to sign up for third-year electives."
He wondered if Theo had placed them randomly, or somehow intuited that Sirius would be the one proposing. It was simultaneously impressive and creepy if Theo's quiet intelligence extended that far. But it was not petty details of placement seemingly occupying Sirius. He was staring at the words
Perhaps one had been wrong to let the other second-years off so easy, with there coming to be so little fear for the name of Draco Malfoy in Slytherin house.
," Gilderoy said carelessly, "You've fancied Harry Potter since you were a child," and laughed at Draco's gobsmacked expression. "I didn't think you were trying to hide it," he said guilelessly, looking surprised by Draco's surprise. "The way you acted in that duel against him... it seemed so obvious you were enamored of the boy. That snake you conjured just to impress him..."
"So Bellatrix Lestrange was more generous a correspondent than you led us to believe," Severus observed wryly. "Another secret you bring. How recent was this Black Dagger? For the death of Karkaroff, or-"
"It's just awful," Hermione breathed, tears coming to her big brown eyes. "It's barbaric. Like they're just animals, not thinking beings that can speak and feel. Draco, imagine if this was Dobby. If it his head was one of the ones up on this wall."
Lockhart got a supercilious look on his face. "I have heard you've applied for the Defense position several times, Severus. I would think you would welcome the chance to show off your skills as an instructor in that position. Unless you feel you are not up to the task." This transparent attempt at manipulation was playing with fire. Draco had rarely seen anyone make Severus go from 0 to 100 this rapidly, as he could feel the air drop 20 degrees in the already frosty dungeons. "I would understand, if a mere professor would hesitate to undertake a dueling demonstration with as storied and accomplished a wizard as myself-"
. Langlock!" he cast, and Ron's hand shot to grab at his tongue incredulously, making incoherent sounds of panic.
"Revelio," Draco tried, then an Aparecium, again with no luck. But he had a back-up plan, one available to few if any others, given he was supposedly the last living heir of House Black. He carefully cast, "Diffindo," and his left palm cut open just the right amount, letting Draco's blood spill onto the pavement between houses 11 and 13. "Sanguirenere," Draco called.
"Draco?" Remus breathed, in such audible horror that Draco had to turn. Remus had never looked more caught off-guard. "What is it you expect me to
"Hey, maybe it won't come into play," Draco mused aloud, and fortunately, Harry didn't ask what that meant.
"Oh, he didn't think he was lying," Riddle drawled. "And I might have become better friends with him after his failure, were it not for you
"Shut up," Harry groaned. "You make it all look so damn easy, don't you? You can pick up the fire in your hands and play with it, pull it around with your fingers, and I can't even..."
"A complicated legislative business, which my burdensome godson need not to overexert himself to understand, save for the fact that he has once again
So the match stretched on, much to Gryffindor's detriment. Johnson called a timeout after Nott scored and made it 70-10, but nothing she said could change that they had prepared for a Slytherin with entirely different tactics than they were using. Clearly, they'd assumed Slytherin would be at its old shoving and taunting and child's play, not prearranged attacks from a professional Quidditch playbook. She couldn't snap her fingers and magically make them ready for that. Nor could she magically keep their petrified Keeper, his confidence already wrecked, from letting in almost every throw of the Quaffle that went remotely near the hoop.
What seemed to soften Ron's jealousy, then, was Draco's invitation to practice with him on his night flights. Upon Draco's ascension to Seeker, Severus had increased his blanket permission to extend from Friday to Sunday. Granted, Ron spent the first night with his wand out half the time, looking convinced Draco would curse him to fall to his death. But by the first Sunday, he was joyfully repelling Draco's poor Quaffle throws with the swagger of sixth-year Weasley vs. Slytherin.
"Guess you don't owe me a life debt anymore," Draco said lightly instead. "Ron, he's still on the hook."
"You don't know what it was like back then. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was taking over everywhere! Wh-what was there to be gained by refusing him? He would have killed me, Sirius!"
Neville shot him a glance. "Do you... you... oh, no, you know what happened to them, don't you?" he said, voice breaking again, and first his hands began to shake, then his shoulders.
! Why is he imprisoned? And there are Dementors! I thought they were gone from that wretched place!"
"Dementors," Severus said impatiently. "What else? Did you imagine I'd murdered them in cold blood and buried them under our feet? It seems that whatever Potter and Granger's feelings on Slytherin, they were unwilling to leave them to have their souls kissed away. Or their little friends. Potter had his wand from the ground. He produced a quite impressive Patronus, while a wandless Granger evacuated you and Weasley and Lovegood, and then all of Slytherin House. The Dementors got in hunting there as well, in after Mr. Crabbe propped the entrance open for Mr. Goyle to smuggle a chocolate lava cake through-"
"Party time!" Luna exclaimed, bouncing over, and presented Draco with a birthday crown made of green and silver balloons. Draco had no intention of wearing such a thing in front of Harry, until he saw she had drawn or enchanted the heads of the long slender balloons to look like snakes, complete with hissing red tongues, and then nothing would do but to wear it. He had an appropriately Slytherin headpiece for the occasion when his housemates arrived.
"The truth..." Draco closed his eyes, letting his voice trail off. He felt himself at risk of waxing poetic, but it was hard to even think before speaking when he was this tired. "Potter, you don't know how many things can be true at the same time, things that all mean different things and contradict each other. And yet they're all just as true. At the very minimum, there's always two different truths existing at once, even if everyone can't- can't see them..."
"Draco?" hissed the voice that judgment wore in his imagination, colored in Avada Kedavra green. When he pulled the cabinet open, Potter's green eyes were glowing out from the shadows like a little cat. Though not as little as Draco remembered from the start of summer.
"Draco?" she called back, and Draco ran towards the left, towards his open eye, and slipped and fell. He fell hard, and felt his mouth hit the stone and draw blood, like he had known he would fall, but at least the sound of his fall brought Luna. He would almost have wished her away, though, rather had her drifted off into the depths of the dungeons and lost there forever, than have to face the specter of her now, too indistinct with one eye in shadow to look any different, with her halo of light hair, than she had in seventh-year, patiently waiting for him to bring her the only food she would get...
"No!" Harry exclaimed, looking bizarrely hurt. "I thought it was just you! And wait, you two weren't even close back when we were in second year, and you sent me that one about the toad..."
Maledictum was very large and a very striking mintish silver-green. Her mournful ice gray eyes- Periander said she was a
"What are you doing going flying like that anyway," Harry laughed. "You're dressed way too nicely for..." Finally, his brain seemed to click into place. "You... you are dressed up today, aren't you? I mean, not that you don't always look good, but... hey,
The third recitation did not spark up with a wall of flame this time. It just turned the potion to a deep, perfect, pomegranate wine red.
Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder. The Mudblood offered Potter her handkerchief, which he wrapped around his hand. Draco, feeling victorious, laughed derisively.
Most nights, Draco couldn’t sleep. He felt hurt and resentful and he hated it. He hated feeling like this. He hated how Harry’d forgotten him and how he didn’t bother at all to fix things. And Draco didn’t even
‘All right there, Scarhead?’ yelled Draco, shooting underneath him to show off the speed of his new broom. It outperformed Potter’s backdated one on every level.
Father arrived in great spirits, that Monday morning, stepping out of the fireplace with a flourish. ‘Top of the morning, everyone!’
Vincent and Pansy got up to catch their envelopes, but Draco pressed his eyes closed. He was dreading going back to that place – that place where he had his heart shattered. Maybe if he didn’t open his letter, he didn’t have to go back.
Out of habit, his eyes wandered over to the Gryffindor table. After looking the table up and down a few times, he sat up straight in surprise.
Without even looking around, Potter pulled off his shoes and socks – nothing more than that –, grabbed something out of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth… and he waded out into the lake.
‘Yeah,’ said Draco, putting on a brave sort of grimace as he felt everyone’s eyes on him. He winked at Potter, who shook his head, the scowl he’d been wearing vanishing at once.
Something landed on his chest and he sat up in shock. It was a pair of pants. ‘Potter! Sod off!’ A shirt hit him in the face. He snatched it away as Potter laughed.
‘And now for an update on our local Auror Department. Our august auror seemed to be in a rush this morning. He was spotted hopping around with only one leg in his trousers. How curious... ’
While Harry recovered, Draco inspected the curtains. ‘Damn it, Potter… You ruined my curtains.’ He picked the joint from the windowsill. ‘And I wasn’t even halfway finished with this.’
‘I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,’ snapped his father.
‘Tell me,’ breathed Draco. Noticing he was leaning eagerly on the foot of the bed, he quickly went back to Jason’s cassettes, turning a few of them over and over in his hands unseeingly. ‘Harry’s hair? What of it?’ He lazily dusted his sleeve. ‘Does it have magic? I bet it has, I hear it sometimes.’ He carelessly looked round at the squid swimming past the dormitory, flicking his hair from his face in a bored kind of way. ‘Not that I care,’ he added for good measure.
Suddenly the dog started barking and jumping. When Gregory shouted something, they all looked up to see four owls sweeping through the open sliding doors to the garden. Matilda the dog tried to catch them, jumping and snapping her teeth at them.
The boy’s legs snapped together marvellously, just like it was pictured in the book, and the way he stumbled to the ground was so similar to Draco’s bit in the common room that it had the three of them rolling on the floor laughing.
‘I must say, I’m looking forwards to seeing Malfoy’s mother’s face when he gets off the train,’ said MacMillan, watching Draco squirm with a malicious smirk.
The day before the match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit.
The whisper floated through a crowded corridor. Draco couldn’t figure out who’d said it, but as he and his friends made their way to the Great Hall at lunch break, more scraps of the same conversation filled the castle.
Nott and Draco were sitting cross-legged, facing each other, as Nott had claimed he could put Draco's sleeve button back on better than Draco himself could.
‘Merlin, Potter, you’re wrecking my nerves, please answer the question.’ Draco’s fists were clenched, his cheeks flushed and his eyes wide in… distress?
Back in his dorm, Draco sucked on the end of a Deluxe Sugar Quill while pondering how to ask his father about his whereabouts during the third Triwizard Task, without revealing anything if the letter fell into the wrong hands.
‘There you go, Harry!’ Weasley shouted over the noise. ‘You weren’t being thick after all – you were showing moral fibre!’
Draco reached for Harry’s blanket to pull it up, but somehow, in the middle of that maneuver, he lost his balance and toppled smack on top of Harry.
‘Obviously not,’ he said, sharing a look with Draco, who was sniggering. ‘Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?’
He felt nauseous the entire week. The last time Potter’d been on a broom, he had hit Draco with that incredible Patronus, which was a curse even adult wizards struggled with. Following that, he had bombarded Draco with yucky mud. And as a cherry on top his best, Mudblood friend had slapped Draco in the face.
‘Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a
On the whole, though, Draco thought he’d done rather well. During the practical examination, he remembered all the counter jinxes and defensive spells from the times they practiced them with Yaxley. Even if he wouldn’t get any bonus points for extracurricular Patronus Charms, he thought he might have scooped up an O.
‘You don’t believe me,’ Draco snarled and he started to unbutton his pyjama shirt to show Harry the wound. These days, he knew how to remove the bandage and put them back on again without any trouble, so he could inspect it himself. It had been all in the books how to do it.
‘How very touching,’ sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. ‘Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter –’
A thump and a groan told them Harry’d hit his head as he got out from underneath the table. With a disdainful look, Draco fired an inconspicuous kissing charm. Harry winked at him and Draco nearly lost it, shoving his hands in his pockets to prevent himself from doing anything that gave them both away. With a hint of sarcasm, he pretended to tip his hat at McGonagall and strolled out of the classroom.
They spent most of the show joking; the brewer had a fondness for puns and Draco was laughing loudly at every single one of them. Harry couldn’t believe his ears the first time – and he still couldn't when Draco finished the interview with a pun of his own that, in turn, made Bert roar with laughter. Even Harry caught himself grinning.
It angered the boy, but Zabini and Pansy laughed scathingly. They introduced the rabbit as Theodore Nott. Draco recognized the surname from the Sacred Twenty-Eight and politely asked what school he went to, which made Pansy and Zabini almost fall over from laughing.
you talk about them,’ drawled Malfoy, ‘you’re next. And I do not care to be next. I ran my blabbering mouth too often already, and I will not be the one to crack and tell the local auror everything to top it off.’ He offered the blunt  to Harry.
When they approached Umbridge’s office, the corridors got increasingly emptier. Umbridge held up a hand to stop them and listened carefully. Then she told Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy to go around and walk up to the office from the other direction. Draco, Bulstrode, Clarinedna and Warrington went with Umbridge.
‘Good morning, Mr Potter,’ said Amanda Henderson, on her way to school from the bakery. ‘I like your shirt. Are you a fan?’
It looked amazing though. They walked into the Great Hall, but it was deserted. The walls had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, all empty. Along the sides were tables filled with food and drinks, and there was music coming from an unknown source, but just as loud as Draco supposed it was downstairs in the real Great Hall.
As Draco stood there, the Great Hall steadily filled up. Crabbe and Goyle arrived, swiftly stuffing their plates as usual. A while later even Pansy strolled in, looking clean and flawless and eager to kill.
‘Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,’ Draco drawled. ‘You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.’ He smirked at his friends.
Hurrying footsteps; arms around his neck; a soft voice in his ear. ‘You should have seen your face, Dra,’ said Harry. ‘Have you ever considered theatre school?’
‘It’s just,’ said Draco, trying his best not to show his malicious glee, ‘we noticed our fellow Prefect Weasley was missing today, and we got worried, you see –’
Hoping to fast-forward this visit somewhat, Draco asked, ‘Will this “help” involve detention in any form, sir?’
Before Weasley could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Draco's elbow. ‘Not arguing, I hope, boys?’ he squeaked.
His face had been amazing though. Draco couldn’t hold it any longer; as soon as Madam Hooch was out of earshot, he burst into laughter. ‘Did you see his face, the great lump?’ he yelled at Pansy, who was standing further down the group with some Slytherin girls. He imitated the stupid, scared face the boy had made, and the girls started giggling.
‘There is absolutely no reason to follow the rules this strictly!’ Draco complained in a furious hiss to his friends during Herbology the next day.
they were talking about, their very own Wonderboy. The boy everyone used to be in love with the minute they saw him, because he was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, powerful enough to beat the Dark Lord as a mere new-born. The Boy Who Smiled at every little thing: someone looked at him, he smiled; someone handed him something, he smiled; the slightest hint of daylight hit the rain-drenched window, he smiled. There was no limit to what cheered up Harry Potter.
‘Suit yourself,’ said Harry. ‘Well, I’ll er… I’ll be going then. Good luck on your show. Oh… you left the button on again.’
The other Slytherin students fell back in their chairs, groaning softly and dropping their shoulders, but Draco was still standing to watch Harry walk over to the Gryffindor table. ‘Well, it made a mistake,’ he said, ‘obviously.'
After their family reunion, the Parkinsons quickly followed up with a big garden party. Draco’s parents and his friends all insisted Draco would come, and he couldn’t think of a solid excuse.
Draco clenched his fists. Did the boy just walk around with injuries like that, he thought, as if they were a part of life they just had to bear?
‘Buffoons!’ Draco hissed at his friends, pushing them along the corridor to get them to Pansy or Alexander Orlando.
The room was dark and empty when he arrived; Lupin was late, as usual. Draco lit the lamps with his wand and waited.
That evening, Draco was so glad to spot Harry walking into the Great Hall again that he jumped up to shout at him, ‘The Dementors send their love, Potter!’
‘You have got to stand up to it,’ Father boomed as Draco swayed on his feet from the summersaults. ‘Recognize the feeling and close it down. Push it away. Come on, Draco, even Potter could do it.’
The rest of the afternoon went by in a blur of anger and worry. As Draco was the only one who witnessed the whole scene and lived to tell the tale, he had to be the one to relate the events to their Head of House. He did so while assisting Madam Pomfrey in the hospital wing.
He stared in astonishment, while around him the common room erupted in wolf-whistles. Before he could recover, Pansy jumped up to strut off to the dorms, only looking around to wink at him.
Inhaling sharply, Draco forced down his resistance with all his might, and managed a smile at Mr. Yaxley. ‘Overjoyed, Mr. Yaxley. Thank you so much for this opportunity. It will be an honour.’
The first Hogsmeade trip of the year was planned for the weekend of Halloween. Pansy had a lot to say about it.
As if any of them had something to do with the stoned cat and the blood on the wall. Potter and his friends were clearly far too honourable to have done it, and Draco hadn’t even been near the spot all day.
The last two weeks of the holidays, Mother kept checking the owlery and became increasingly more agitated every day, sending Agatha into a spiral of stress with her. The booklists still hadn’t arrived.
She quickly waved a hand. ‘It doesn’t matter. I simply didn’t expect them to wander through my sister’s parterre, that is all.
?! Well?!’ Deep breath – ‘THEN HOW?! WAS IT THAT HARD?! TO MIND! MY ONE! REQUEST?! ONE – SIMPLE – REQUEST!’
Still panting in shock, Harry was leaning on his knees. ‘Your back pocket, love.’ His heart was racing – it didn’t matter how often he had to respond quickly or landed himself into a stressful situation, it was still hard to shake the adrenalin. The size of the fire didn’t matter much. He’d been living on the edge for so long his nervous system had taken root there.
‘Forget him,’ she said, shoving a glitter picture towards him. ‘Here, look at Robbie, he’s good for the soul.’
Potter’s face was burning a deep red, and Draco hadn’t felt so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid. ‘I didn’t know,’ he said, leering at Potter.
