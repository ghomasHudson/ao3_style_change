Lucius scowled. "She's not being absurd, Narcissa, she's being foul," he said darkly, rising from his chair and towering over Draco. "And she's going to stop it this instant, aren't you Alya?"
“You know, Robards is starting to complain about my handwriting…” he teased. “You may find yourself under direct orders to fill out the reports, yourself.”
“Up! Up!” he squealed, as Draco collected the shoes and scolded himself, for the umpteenth time, for lying to his son. He really should stop that.
“Wh-what was that for?” he asked, unable to tear his eyes from Harry's.
Draco smiled—a dopey thing he'd deny for the rest of his life—at the thought of Harry standing at the end of the aisle, dashing in his green robes with vines climbing the arms and back, large jungle flowers in a bouquet of colour about his shins. Draco's were a deep blue, darker than the cove, and rippling like water, pouring to crash at his feet with the white of turbulent seas and rapid rivers.
He could afford to be cocky about it; nearly a year before, Draco had returned to England, brandishing glowing recommendations from the DMLE in France. Aurors there spoke highly of him, suggesting that the British Ministry would do well to hire him and put his skills to use. Originally, Harry doubted the validity of those skills; surely, if they knew Draco Malfoy, they wouldn’t endorse him. But, he'd learned better. Since beginning his post, Draco quickly built a reputation. He was cold, clinical, and kept to himself but, during their first case together, he'd proved himself worthy of those recommendations, solving Harry’s case nearly single-handedly with little more than a strand of hair and a fingerprint.
"Draco Malfoy? I was under the impression Lucius had sired a girl."
“You know damned well,” was all Harry said before flicking a glance at the children and back. “Come back to mine, after this. We can put a cot in Teddy's room for the night, and I'll make breakfast in the—”
“We're going to see X-Men!” Teddy informed her, pushing his vegetables around with his fork. “Right, Harry?”
“I'm going to be in Hufflepuff, just like my mum!” Teddy answered, immediately.
“Good night, Auror Potter,” a voice called, and Harry looked up with a smile and a wave for the cheerful blonde who was already making her way toward the Floo banks.
“Edward Lupin!” Andromeda scolded as he sprang to his feet. “Harry's presence is no excuse for rudeness.”
"Draco," he began but Draco didn't hear the rest as consciousness faded…
"Merlin, chew your food," Draco admonished him, but Harry didn't appear to hear him.
The absurdity of the situation coupled with the creeping fatigue worked like a balm on Draco's frayed nerves. Months of worry, of wonder, and of all-around stress were finally over. And here was Harry Potter himself standing there in the dim infirmary, assuring Draco his modesty was intact.
"You're… different," Potter replied, crossing his arms over his chest as he spoke.
“That’s irrelevant,” Robards barked. “What’s important is to catch the thief and produce a believable cover story for the break-ins. I’m sending you in as MI5-”
Suddenly, Harry's lips were on his, cutting him off and drawing a quiet gasp from Draco. But, as quickly as it began, he was pulling away and dropping his forehead to rest against Draco's and holding his eyes in a heated gaze.
“To talk about the case, then.” Harry gave Draco's hand a little squeeze. He wasn’t going to give up that easily, not this time. “You’ve been working on it, already, so you must have some insight.”
But Harry rose to meet him halfway through the room, taking the offered newspaper.
“I am aware, sir. However, I am a citizen of the world and, as such, am privy to the goings on within it. And, as I am working on this case personally, I could not help but see the similarities between the media's reporting and my case.”
"Suit yourself, Draco," Potter replied with a shrug. "I really am curious, though. How did you have a baby?"
“Who’s working that case? Why is it being passed to us?”
Well, the room was dark. And, as such, so was the figure. But there was no question of legality. Stealing is against the law, even I knew that.
Draco laughed. “Okay, then you can hold him when we get to the restaurant.”
A thought niggled at the back of Draco's mind, sapping his focus as, for what seemed like the first time since his days in university, he felt the hours of work deep in his bones long before the clock on the dungeon wall confirmed it. Rising, he levitated the remaining records back to their proper places without bothering to call for Flemm as he let the thought form, fully.
Polishing off the last of his lunch, Draco sucked a dab of the rich masala from his thumb and shifted the rejected records to a corner of his desk before burying himself again. But, as he flipped through the records, finishing his stack and returning to the dungeon for another, he began to doubt he'd find anything of import within them.
“Oh? Will little Rose be joining you?” Andromeda averted her eyes, picking uncharacteristically at her chicken, and Harry laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
, for the love of—” But it was too late. The boy was on his feet and through the door before she could finish the order. Shaking her head, she eyed Harry. “That child is going to be the death of me.”
“I heard,” Harry said, ruffling Teddy's hair. “You're quite lucky. As I understand it, Draco is very protective of his son.” Looking up, he locked amused eyes with Draco's, smirking up at him. “Isn't that right, gorgeous?”
“Very well, touch me up, then,” Draco chuckled, bringing the apple to his lips. Then he paused, “You know, you could probably do with a touch up, too,” he said with a sly wink, and crossed his arms.
“No!” Scorpius squealed, clapping his chubby hands together and beaming at Draco.
Turning, he glared at Harry. "Potter, what are you doing here? It's bad luck to see each other before the wedding."
"Father will understand one day."
“Oh no,” Harry insisted, catching his chin for a kiss. “My idea, my treat.”
A little thrill that had no business running down his spine in the middle of Diagon Alley did exactly that and Draco flushed as he passed the squirming toddler to Harry. Who immediately jiggled the boy into a fit of giggles before tossing him in the air and catching him under the armpits, promptly giving Draco a minor heart attack.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That's not the point, Harry.” Ron glowered.
Draco softened, the anger that had led him to ordering Jinx to hack off his long, treasured locks smoldering under the pain he'd obviously caused his mother.
Her eyes shifted, understanding dawning, and she gripped his hand. "Your father--"
“Y- yes.” Nodding, he glanced down to Scorpius, who was watching them far too closely, and jiggled him a little. “Aren't we, Scorpius? You're ready for lunch, I'd reckon.”
“Things are well, Harry. Thank you.” Dabbing at the corner of her mouth with a linen cloth, she made to stand. “Would you like a plate?”
Tripping over some unknown object in the dark, I cursed and spun around, peering toward the glass panelled door and the only source of light in the room. It was narrow, not like the large Tesco buildings in the busier areas of London, and what meagre light filtered through the grimy glass was obscured by the figure standing just inside, silhouetted by the trickle of light. Although I couldn’t see her face, I understood her displeasure; it coursed through me, reminding me of my task, sending prickling fear singing down my spine. Hurry up, she seemed to say, though she didn’t speak. She never spoke in those quiet, sacred moments.
Rising, he left the office and did just that, avoiding the office of one Harry Potter when he heard raucous laughter coming from the closed door. He'd see Potter and Weasley soon enough.
Scowling, Draco took another bite of the sandwich he didn’t want.
Draco started at the vehemence of his words, the hatred in his eyes. “You,” he said, realisation dawning as Ron held Creevey back. “You did this.”
“Do what?” Harry asked, all innocence.
“That’s all I’m sure of, yes. I was holding it for a friend of mine who’s due soon. If she couldn’t afford it when the baby came, I was going to give it to her.” Her eyes drifted to something over Draco’s shoulder just before a hand landed there, claiming his attention just as Potter reached out to ruffle the boy’s hair.
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Robards narrowed his eyes, frowned, but conceded. As he should. The moniker of Head Auror meant he couldn't ignore a potential wizarding crime in his jurisdiction.
“Today,” he began, offering a brown paper bag, dotted with grease spots, “for your eating pleasure, we have-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, Harry assured him that wouldn’t happen, but Draco still worried. Lost in thought, he lifted the apple to his mouth, only to have it batted away by Pansy’s busy hands.
“Good night,” he called, anyway.
When she finished, she stood aside and let him look himself over. Turning this way and that he admired the glow of his skin, the way his eyes seemed to pop. He looked amazing, he thought, and Harry would think so, too.
“Yes, it is, Harry. I'm married to Hermione! You aren't even dating him.”
“Yep,” Harry snorted. “That’s the problem.” Digging into the bag, he fished out one newspaper-wrapped packet and tossed it to Ron before dumping his own onto the desk, crumpling the bag, and binning it. The headline covering his food, nearly illegible through the grease, shouted “Third Impossible Break-In This Month.” Shaking his head, Harry peeled it back and picked up a chip.
Hurrying up to his lab, Draco rushed to pen a letter, then gathered his belongings and dashed back out. And right into Harry.
It was then that Draco remembered what exactly he said that caused the scene taking place before him. "So," Draco started, causing everyone to whip their heads in his direction. "Professor Snape isn't the Secret Keeper. So, who is?" Draco had to admit... he was a bit pissed off. If Snape wasn't the Secret Keeper, that means that the man spilled Draco's secret to some random person without Draco's consent. The blonde confided in the greasy man because he trusted him. Draco came all this way because he trusted him. Draco is now being interrogated by a bunch of weirdos because he trusted him! And for what? For the man to spread Draco's misfortunes around like its daily gossip?
“I was placed up here, so you could spy on me,” Draco soberly stated.
Draco spluttered again-- both boys ignored him.
Harry let out a sigh and ran a hand through his tangled black locks, "I don't know. They were saying that Malfoy and some girl named Estella went missing?" Harry recounted as he tried to remember the rest of the dream. Suddenly, Harry remembered the reason Malfoy's mother gave for Malfoy's disappearance and blushed. Hermione, being the observant girl she is, noticed the blush immediately and pounced on it.
Draco rolled his eyes before walking towards his and Estella's room for the time being. The aristocrat stopped abruptly, “What…?” On the wooden door hung an old paper sign with the words 'Do Not Enter Without the Express Permission of Regulus Arcturus Black' written on it.
Because you seemed very excited a week ago," Narcissa reminded Draco, smirking as she did. Draco frowned, remembering the high-pitched scream that erupted from his throat after he received his Hogwarts acceptance letter.
Draco shook his head violently as he took his hands off of his mouth. "Gods, no. I got out of there before he could," Draco said. He then felt the push to say more and tried to hold it back but- "but... he would say things. About me. And how he wanted to do things to me. And how he thought I was pretty. And how-" The blonde let out a shriek of frustration before aggressively biting down onto his bottom lip, breaking the supple skin and causing his lip to start bleeding. "What is this? Did you slip me Veritaserum or something?"
“HARRY!”
The three purebloods left the compartment immediately. As they left, Draco overheard the average boy making a comment to the Weasley, "-He's a weirdo, Ron. I met him when I went to Diagon Alley and all he did was stare off into space like a creep-"
"-Hey! Are you okay? You still there?" the average boy exclaimed, waving his hands in front Draco's face before being chided by Madam Malkin, who was working on his robe, to stop moving.
“Right,” Ginny said with a curious gleam in her eye. “You're like the defacto dad, huh?”
Also since I've been busy with driver's ed and ACT studying, it takes a while to find time to just write. Usually a chapter takes at least a week or more for me atm.
Draco looked over at the front of the shop to see Madam Malkin squatting in front of a thin boy. The boy's hair was dark and disheveled, he wore clothes that were too big for his small frame, and had large glasses that did nothing to dull the bright green hue in the boy's eyes.
"My eye?" Draco interrupted, his eyebrows furrowed.
Draco shuddered and immediately went back to staring at his food (and he could've sworn he heard Millicent's evil witch laugh but that was besides the point). "You know," Draco's head shot up to see Terry watching him. "You can still be friends with them. I heard that Slytherins and Gryffindors hate each other, not Ravenclaws and Slytherins."
Also, thank you guys for the nice comments!! They motivate me to write more and they make me feel so fuzzy inside omg. I was planning on having this chapter finished by the weekend but finished it days earlier than I anticipated! Thank you guys for giving this fic love!!! It really helped my writing process!! I love hearing your thoughts and theories about the plot!!
After dinner, Draco headed straight to the Divination's classroom-- he got his directions from the Ravenclaw prefects a day prior. Unfortunately, the question did not come without consequences. Robert Hilliard and Penelope Clearwater looked at Draco as though he was crazy for willingly visiting Trelawney when he wasn't even taking her class. ("Divination is a useful subject!" Robert told Draco, "But Trelawney is a fake. She told Clearwater that she was going to die a painful death by the end of third year. Unfortunately, her fat arse is still alive." Robert got a kick in the shin from Penelope after that comment). Apparently, word spread about Draco's interest in Divination and now, all of Ravenclaw house thinks that Draco is some delusional nutter who believes that his tea residue holds the answers to his History of Magic assignments.
"What is your age?"
The dark-skinned Auror who Draco now knew as Shacklebolt nodded, took a moment to gather his thoughts, and then began talking again. "You said earlier that you confided in Snape over things that were worrying you, yes?" Draco nodded, not liking where this line of questioning was going. "What was worrying you?"
The Ravenclaw sighed before following Trelawney's instructions. He placed his elbows on the table and leaned in to get a better look at the crystal ball. At first, all the blonde saw was fog. However, as he continued to gaze into the ball, the fog slowly evaporated to reveal the face of a wrinkled old woman. Her eyes were a dark brown and her hair was brown streaked with strands of grey. Draco already knew her voice and now, he realized, he also recognized her face. "I know you," Draco said, his voice trembly and nervous.
is none of
“Please?”
Eventually, Draco was lying down in his new dorm room. His roommates--Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot-- were already sleeping while Draco was wide awake, staring up at his ceiling. Draco's whole entire life had changed drastically in just a few hours... and he hoped that it didn't change for the worse.
“No shit,” Ginny said with a snort. Remus gave the girl a warning glare and Ginny ignored it and continued to speak, “you looked like you were about to drop dead this afternoon. You looked like you need a nap.”
"Draco. Draco!" Trelawney said, trying to get the young boy's attention.
Remus eyed the group of Gryffindors with a look of suspicion. “And pray tell, what is your definition of normal?”
"I c-can't! I can't breathe!"
"Can someone tell me why the ferret is here?" - Ron
The next chapter will probably be up next weekend! I'm already writing the next chapter and I'm super excited to get this plot moving!
The woman in the crystal ball gave Draco a small smile, "I'm sure you do. Your reaction to my voice said as much."
The eleven-year old shook his head in disbelief. His mother was right about the so-called "pre-Hogwarts jitters" she was always rambling about. That dream, whatever it was, must have been caused by his nerves. Draco understood it perfectly... why he would be nervous, that is. In less than two months, he'll be in Hogwarts. Draco would be sorted (into Slytherin, of course) and he would be in classes and he would be the top of his class and he would be-
Anthony stabbed the slab of meat with his fork before shaking it in front of Draco's face. "Does this look raw to you?"
"Father, I'm excited, that's all," he explained as other wizarding families rushed by them without care. Narcissa sighed before cupping her son's face with her pale, thin hands.
Malfoy regarded Hermione for a moment before answering, “A year. She was born in July of last year.”
"I said but nothing!"
, a list of old wizarding families that were truly pureblooded. Draco felt himself smirk; his family was very high in the food chain, the Greengrass'... not so much. Of course they weren't too low, but in pureblood standards they weren't very high, at least, not compared to the Malfoys.
That seemed to shut the rude boy up. Draco smirked, turning back to the average boy, "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
"Wait...
"Yeah," a blond boy sitting across from Draco said, "I don't think you have the right to call anybody broody, Michael. Not when you look like that!"
"So..." Blaise started awkwardly, staring at Draco as he did. The blond had been glaring out the window since he returned to the compartment five minutes prior; meanwhile, the other boys sat there in silence and stared at the blond. Blaise had been the first to break this silence. "I take it as Potter wasn't recruited?"
One by one, each student was called up and was sorted into their separate houses. "Malfoy, Draco!"
with you!” Hermione exclaimed. “He stayed up all night making those 'Potter Stinks' buttons last year! I overheard Parkinson and Greengrass talking about it!”
Estella... she was the main reason why Draco fled. If Estella wasn't there, the teenager wouldn't have even entertained the thought of abandoning his mother like this. However, Draco felt like he had no choice but to run. The girl was only twelve months old— she was born in the month prior to the Quidditch World Cup. The toddler was so tiny and vulnerable... she had no place being near monsters like Greyback or the Carrows (or even his own father, aunt, uncle, or especially the Dark Lord... but Draco would never say that traitorous thought out loud lest he be put under the Cruciatus Curse for the rest of his life).
“Who's the baby mama?”
McGonagall glared at the fugitive. "Mind your tongue, Sirius," the professor threatened. The old woman stopped glaring and then let out a soft sigh. "However, you are right. Malfoy's appearance would be easier to explain with him here. Merlin, what was going through that man's mind?"
Draco never hated the rule about first-years not having broomsticks more than he did at that moment.
that?" The aristocrat shook his head in disbelief before continuing, "Trelawney said that the beef would be raw!"
The blond blinked a few times before he took off the hat and quickly walked towards the Ravenclaw table. Slowly, the Ravenclaws began to clap for their new member, who had already sat down next to another first year at the end of the table.
“I know,” Malfoy said as he cleaned up some food that dribbled out of the girl's mouth. “Cute, but hard to take care of.”
The blonde violently flinched as he came to. Draco blinked rapidly as he suddenly found it hard to breathe. He could hear his heartbeat berserkly pounding as his body began to shake uncontrollably. Chills ran down his spine in contrast to the sweat that seeped from his pores. He was dying. He felt like he was dying.
cool). Other than that, Draco didn't really know anything about the other boy. He was always quiet and only spoke when asked or to make a snarky comment. He was harsh... that much Draco knew.
Suddenly, a fist slammed down onto the table, causing Draco to jump in his seat. "Jokes can be exchanged later," Moody exclaimed, leaving his fist on the table. "We have company, remember?"
“This beef isn’t even medium-rare. If anything it’s dry!”
That's all he had to say, really. Daphne's confident expression faltered slightly as silence traveled across the compartment shortly after Draco's introduction. "My father has told me about you," the girl said slowly. The confident smirk that disappeared earlier had returned to her face as she continued to speak, "nice to meet you, Malfoy."
more time," Black growled, the aggression in his voice causing Estella to cry out in fear. Draco frowned and held the toddler closer to him as her tears stained his collared shirt. Sirius Black glanced at the baby, his enraged face softening at the mere sight of her. The fugitive then let out a breath of air before continuing, "how did
After Trelawney's strange omen, Draco spent his weekend drowning in anticipation. While the rest of Draco's roommates dismissed Trelawney as an "old tart that's slightly off her rocker", Draco found himself unable to ignore Trelawney and her strange statements entirely.
As for how often I'll update... I really don't know. Probably once a week or maybe once every two weeks? It depends on how long each chapter takes to write. Be prepared for once a week though-- at least for the summer! thanks for reading and please comment if you have any questions or criticism or idk.
I had school. that's it LOL! I was so burnt-out and I took the first part of summer to just do nothing. Finally summer is here and I don't have to pretend to understand my algorithms homework lmao.
“Voldemort killed him,” Black bluntly answered. Draco flinched in response, while Black stared. “Anybody who tries to back out, fails. And anybody who fails, dies,” Black let out a small sigh as he eyed the teenager in front of him. “You got lucky. For now, at least.”
This chapter ended up being much longer than I anticipated RIP.
the location?"
"Oh dear!" Trelawney exclaimed before crouching down in front of the first year. The professor gently placed her hands on the blonde boy's shoulders and said, "Draco, I need you to breathe for me."
“Ginny, that baby is too cute to be Parkinson's offspring,”
"You too, Greengrass," Draco replied, his smirk still evident on his face. Draco then turned his attention to the big girl next to Daphne. "Who's the cow?"
Sighing, Harry decided he’d take what he could get, so he shrugged and nodded. “All right. When you bring by the report, then.”
Draco smoothed his features out, offered a sympathetic smile instead. "Yes, but many are moving forward, starting over."
(See the end of the chapter for
“So is the Slytherin common room!”
“Of course, sir, but this is matter of some importance. Not to worry, it is relevant to my current case.”
Draco was already scrambling to pack up his equipment, throwing a stasis charm on his potion, and shoving his arms into his robes. “Yes, thank you, Potter.”
"For the language, I mean," Potter clarified staring dead into Draco's eyes as he spoke to Madam Pomfrey, who chuckled warmly as she passed with fresh sheets and set them next to the basin she'd already filled and warmed with a few flicks of her wrist.
’s society pages, but this was a rather large step. Narcissa took Scorpius into wizarding London, but Draco had yet to do so himself. Between officially showing his son to the world and puttering around Diagon Alley with Harry Potter and Teddy Lupin like they were a ragtag family, Draco was relieved Harry didn't take his hand for the duration of their walk to Fortescue’s.
"Can't you give him something?" he asked, and Draco realised belatedly Potter wasn't talking to him.
Nodding, I turned to hug Harry, too, before looking back to Teddy. He smiled at me and took my hand, and we raced across the platform together.
“Oh, I know. You take him to the cinema and I let him fly around Malfoy Manor.”
“Oi!” Ron cried, but Harry just watched Draco chew the stolen chip, his pale lips closed tightly, before swallowing and bending to select another.
"Oh, this is Crabbe, and this is Goyle," Draco said, gesturing to his friends. Then, his chin tilted up importantly, he gathered his courage and continued. "And my name is Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
“Yes!” Teddy exclaimed, bouncing in his seat. “Grandma says we can go shopping for my list next weekend!”
From mother of pearl combs that tightened in one's hair until they scalped the victim to a pair of diamond studded iron shoes that heated themselves without the use of actual fire, there were plenty of gruesome trinkets designed to bring suffering upon the user, but each record was very specific, each item named. “Ruby necklace rumoured to have vague magical power by clueless Muggles” did not yield any viable results, though Draco knew it wouldn't before searching. Which left him poring over stacks of records. Every golden necklace set with a red stone was recorded, and there were hundreds.
“That's very exciting, Teddy, but you aren't going anywhere until you've finished your dinner.” Andromeda chuckled when Teddy hunched his shoulders with a sheepish grin, then turned back to Harry. “How is work, dear?”
Harry was smiling at him again by the time he reached his side, and snaked a possessive arm around his waist, dodging Scorpius as he leaned in to capture Draco's lips in a sweet, lingering kiss. Teddy's groans and muttered “grown ups are so gross” went unheard, unable to penetrate the roaring in Draco's ears.
Everyone seemed to think he had some kind of hero complex. Sure, he enjoyed helping people, but what was wrong with that? Okay, so Draco was free because Harry testified on his behalf, but he didn’t feel the need to free any legitimate Death Eaters, did he? Deep down, he’d always known that Draco wasn’t evil, wasn’t in control of his actions during the war. He was always a pointy git, but that was another matter.
“I thought it was Gryffindor,” Harry said, frowning. “Like me and your dad.”
Dragging in a deep breath, Draco slid the compartment door open and strode inside. He eyed the boy nervously before speaking.
Draco gave an exaggerated shudder as he relinquished the bag. They had been sitting on the floor, Scorpius’ little bum planted on the carpet between Teddy's legs, when he rolled himself away to chase a toy that had toppled out of his hand. On a cushioning charm. Poor Teddy was so worried he'd hurt his cousin, and swore it would never happen again.
Outside, the shadows were lengthening as afternoon bled into evening, and Scorpius had more ice cream down his front than he had eaten. Teddy waited patiently while Draco tidied the baby, then him, before lifting Scorpius and turning toward the toilet.
“As always, my dear.” With a flourish, Draco swept his robes to one side and sat. “Alright, work your magic.”
Pansy scoffed but glanced at the mirror. “I don’t know what you mean; I look perfect.”
She stared at him for a moment, then her features hardened again. She released his hand and took a step back. "Alya," she repeated, though she couldn't look at him as she said it. "Go to your room. Your father will hear about this."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sinking to his knees, he let the tears come, let people watch him fall apart, even let them comfort him. But, as Hermione fell to the ground at his side, there was a gasp, a collective intake of breath followed by utter silence broken only by the force of Draco’s grief.
I was still a bit afraid of Draco, but I knew by then how much he liked arguing, so I spoke up. Albeit, softly. “It could happen,” I said. “Teddy’s a really good flier.” And everyone beamed at me. Ridiculously pleased, I ducked my head as my cheeks heated.
Thanks for reading! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a bit politer, you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either…"
When they finished eating and had ordered their ice creams, Harry helped cast the necessary protective spells on the chairs, floor, and table, then Draco settled Scorpius in Teddy's lap and left the boys to slurp at their cones, together. Harry's hand rested on his thigh again but, this time, he lowered his own to cover it, smiling warmly.
It wasn’t a great shock when Harry was pronounced dead on arrival. It was determined that he’d been poisoned, though none of the usual antidotes had worked, not even a bezoar. Draco wasn’t coping well. He was still numb. He hadn’t cried, hadn’t flinched, not in the week since his wedding day.
“Fair point,” Draco conceded, putting his hand on my shoulder. Just then, the engine blasted its horn, announcing their time for goodbyes was coming to an end. “Alright, boys, time to be off.” Bending, he wrapped Teddy in a firm embrace, then ruffled his blue hair and turned to me. “It's going to be okay. You can owl us anytime, and we'll come and collect you,” he said as his long arms came around me.
"I still can't believe Dennis would do this. He was such a good kid." Sighing, Harry passed the paper back and quirked a grin at the disbelieving look on Draco's face. "No, I do believe it, it's just… It hurts, you know? The war is still hurting people, even now."
“That definitely seems plausible. Many of us lost something in the wars. Perhaps he's trying to reclaim what was taken.”
"Yes," the boy said, a hint of pride in his voice. He looked Vince and Greg up and down, reminding Draco of his manners.
“We have to assume so, yes.”
“A mobile, Potter,” Draco sneered, withdrawing a couple of inches. “The device you hang above a baby's cot?”
The door opened and closed with a whisper of wood over carpet, and Draco sighed. "Pansy, I know it hasn't been half an hour yet," he drawled, leaning back in his chair and tossing his apple high in the air. He started when a hand shot out and caught it on its way back down.
“Not for lack of trying.”
Harry lay in a bed of white satin, his arms folded over his waist, his hair as wild as ever. He seemed to be sleeping, the rosy blush still in his cheeks, the soft bow of his lips slightly parted, as if about to sigh.
“I wasn't planning on it, no. Now, if you'll excuse me.”
“I do,” Ron sighed, throwing himself into the chair beside the desk. “I don’t know anyone, personally, who can fry up a good fish and chips, so I always have to pay for it.”
It really didn't take all that much to come to the realisation Draco had come to. Because these break-ins were impossible.
As they walked out amid a roar of murmurs from the gathered guests, Pansy released him with a whispered promise to join him at St. Mungo’s as soon as possible. The last thing he heard as he passed through the door was her soothing voice informing the room at large of what had transpired. Somewhere within the walls of his summer home, a heart wrenching wail sounded and Draco chanced a glance back to see one of Harry’s friends, the Creevey boy, racing for the door, horror twisting his features.
Antique necklace, gold chain, ruby pendant set in gold, circa 2000, valued at 500 pounds.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So, you think you have what it takes to be a man, do you?" Rising, he walked lazily, like a man who knew the power he wielded. Circled Draco and his parents like a rabid wolf closing in to strike.
“Mmmm” was all Draco could manage as he squirmed in pleasure.
"Hello, Malfoy." Scowled the savior of the wizarding world. His hair stood at every direction and his eyes glinted with an emerald disdain that made Draco's chest clench unpleasantly. No peace was to be had, not even in his own room.
Draco lay on his bed, listless. He had finished every homework assignment sent his way quickly and then would take to staring at the ceiling for however long it took until he had something to do again.
Draco didn’t think much of the date, he remembered the most eventful Halloween he had was his first year when he was terrified of coming face to face with a troll.
When they finally made it into the castle Draco sighed in relief.
Draco gasped as he felt the panic in his chest grip ever tighter. He was hyperventilating, choking on his words, and part of him hoped this was death.
Draco quickly set the plate aside and indulged his mother hen instincts by heading over to Harry’s bed.  He approached slowly, but Harry took no notice, not even as Draco set himself gently next to him and started rubbing circles into his back. Draco was worried that someone had hexed Harry but couldn’t for the life of him think of who in the school could be ungrateful enough to do so.
Draco sat up and smoothed his features, hoping that the burning tears behind his eyes stayed put.
“Yes, but dinner is long over, as I’m sure you're aware,”  Draco didn’t like the onslaught of questions coming his way. “Besides, these wondrous little objects do as a fine meal replacement.” Draco allowed more smoke to seep past his lips.
When he met the edge of the pool and looked at the water it was green and foggy, slime greased the edges and yet, Draco was apathetic. Slowly, he unbuttoned his white shirt and threw it to the ground, then he kicked off his shoes, and slowly but surely Draco found himself naked. Goose pimples graced his skin and his joints creaked as he lowered himself into the muck. Draco swam to the center of the Olympic-sized pool and floated with his eyes closed and stomach facing the sky.
----------
"Fuck.” was all Draco could manage as he pushed open the door to his new abode. Foreboding weighed down on him like bricks tied to his neck and he was certain if one more thing happened he would run for the hills screaming.
“You did so well.” Harry praised as Draco panted.
“It wasn’t even that cold.” Harry chuckled at Draco’s antics.
Draco shuffled the sheets over his head for weeks whenever Harry entered the room. Until one day Draco had managed to rally his courage and exist around Harry. Harry began to bring food from the kitchen, explaining that he was friendly with the elves, and Draco began to eat. They continued their routine then, with brief but friendly conversations and life moved on.
“I- I really don’t have the energy for this feud thing we have. I feel as though this all too much to add hatred to, and to be quite clear I don’t think I ever managed to hate you.”
“It’s stupid.” Harry’s voice was growing in strength but was still too broken for Draco’s nerves.
“Please don’t apologize.” Harry’s warm breath brushed Draco’s cheek as they were both sitting now, inches apart.
Once all that was left was the butt of a delicious vice, Draco vanished the evidence.
“Draco?” His given name drew him from his thoughts with a start, the last person to call him by his name was dead.
Their trek up to the dorms mirrored their journey to the Great Hall in silence and anxiety in Draco’s chest.
“Aren’t we though?” Draco asked, trying to come off more fierce than he felt.
Draco and Harry apparated back to Hogsmeade around lunch and trekked their way up to Hogwarts, the ground now caked in a layer of slush.
--------
-------------
Harry’s tears picked up again and Draco held on for dear life until eventually, Harry fell asleep in Draco’s arms. Draco slipped away when he was sure he wouldn’t wake Harry and headed over to his own bed. That night, though he was not religious, he prayed for the wellbeing of Harry Potter.
“You’d kill me? And here I thought we were friends.”
It had all started innocently enough, Harry had gone to get them both dinner and Draco had gone to the bathroom to freshen up. All-day he had felt more down than he usually did around Harry, and when Harry had asked what was wrong Draco had brushed him off. Draco was now thinking maybe he shouldn’t have done that.
Draco was a sexual person, he learned that quickly. His first wank being the best discovery of his life. He remembered how often he would hook up with Blaise in 6th year as a stress relief. Now, with his only love interest straddling him in a deep kiss with a rock hard erection between them, he felt his confidence growing.
“Got it, here.” Harry placed a finger under Draco’s quivering chin to tilt his head back and with his other hand, he pressed the cold vial to Draco’s lips and poured. Draco drank greedily.
Grabbing his shaving cartridge, that went unused due to his inability to grow the smallest splash of facial hair, he kept his gaze distinctly on the brand his forearm held. He placed the cool metal onto the disgusting blemish and idly wondered if his mother felt this way when she slit her own wrist. He had no aim to end his life as his stinging slices slid opposite to hers. It barely struck him, the whacks of his father's cane being an often occurrence had built his pain tolerance early.
There, about 100 yards in front of Draco, was the pool, surrounded by more yellowing grass.
If this was how he was feeling now, he was certain he would have to sell the manor. It was a shame for a house such as this one not to stay in the family, or at least that’s what his mother would have said. He looked up at the too-large building and felt vertigo began to sweep through him.
The beads of red pursed at the newly puckered skin and he felt satisfied to see his past treated in such a way. Draco was taking control of the thing that controlled him and it brought him endless satisfaction to see that repulsive skull and snake weep blood.
“Lay down.” Draco purred into Harry’s ear, and Harry flipped onto his back.
Draco walked through the house, spotting more cobwebs than ever before, and he met the doors to the backyard portion of the estate. He must have been walking quicker than he thought. Feeling all too eager to be out of the eerie warmth of the house, he pushed the door open and stepped out.
Several days passed by Draco without incident, Harry went to classes and Draco slept the sun away, smoking whenever he felt the pains of hunger. When he woke and felt it time to bathe, he would also take several razor bladed swipes at his dark mark.
When Draco woke, it was from one of the best nights of sleep of his life. He sighed, calm washing over him like yesterday never happened.
“Alright, Potter.”
Draco had arrived earlier than most of his fellow students... all except one, it seemed.
“Stop watching me sleep, I can feel your eyes burning my skin!” Harry’s deep morning voice complained as he took his pillow from below his head and covered his face with it.
“It’s nice how good things always seem to happen around you,” Draco said genuinely to Harry.
When they had stumbled back into their room after the gift of a pitcher of butterbeer from the elves had been split between them, they were very lightly buzzed.
“We can’t erase the past, Potter.” Draco breathed.
After a year of living together, Draco only smoked one cigarette a day and hadn't harmed himself for months.
Once in their room with the door closed Draco dug around for seconds before finding a cigarette and lighting it, throwing his robe down and falling onto his bed in one fluid motion.
“Lots of sugar, splash of milk.” Harry’s breath was on Draco’s neck and Draco shivered involuntarily.
Harry went on and on, listing these things until Draco’s tears stopped.
“Come off it.” Draco huffed as he gingerly lifted the pillow and was met by emerald eyes that never failed to knock him senseless.
Draco shivered desperately as Harry seemed absolutely unbothered by the cold. Draco’s warming spells kept falling away within minutes of casting.
“Well, then I must insist that you call me Draco.” Draco propped himself up on an elbow, feeling his stomach do somersaults.
When they arrived at The Great Hall all heads turned to The Savior and The Death Eater with an array of looks from confusion to disgust. Draco was unsurprised at the reaction while Harry seemed to shuffle uncomfortably for a moment before leading himself and Draco over to a table that claimed no house.
Draco nodded.
“I owe them both my sincerest-” A stinging hex was thrown at Draco’s back. “Fuck!”
-------
“Are you quite alright Potter?”
“Quite fine, thanks.” Draco tried to keep the bite in his voice at bay as he slid past Potter.
He had been asleep for what felt like months, there was really no need to be awake. He had packed appropriately with all his best clothes. He knew it would be rough; he knew he was a traitor, and a coward, so he thought he should at least look good doing it.
------------
Draco snipped the scissors with anger at his appearance. He had been damned with his father’s striking likeness that had just barely been softened by his mother’s features. He gave himself a cut similar to his 6th year and as far from his father’s overlong hanging hair as he could manage. That's when he really looked at himself. Oval-shaped darkness surrounded his eyes, and he looked gaunt. His ribs stuck out under his skin and his collarbones looked sharp. He was naked, making it much too easy to notice the scars scaling his body, his porcelain skin disgusting him. And last, that damned mark. Draco smirked with no humor. He was the property of the tyrant that had threatened the entire wizarding world. He was only a surviving reminder of his family’s ignorance. He put out an order for his school supplies and promptly sought sleep where his eyelids could block out his reality. Any nightmare where he ended up dead was one he took solace in.
Unlocking the barrier between him and his roommate, he was met with emerald eyes looking at him in concern that made him squirm within himself.
He loathed to admit it, but he would miss Harry’s sun shining smile and the comfort it provided. Harry had become a constant in Draco’s life, he brought calm where Draco sincerely doubted he would find it organically.
Draco was certain he would rot out his lungs with his habits, but nonetheless, he lent down and pulled his cigarette pack from his luggage and lit it by the tip of his mother’s wand. The nicotine rushed to his brain and soothed his nerves that had been screaming ever since he set foot on Hogwart’s cobblestone.
"Deceased. Dead. Passed on. After my father received the kiss, she took her life. It was all over The Prophet."
He looked average. Average boy, average life, average everything (the only thing that wasn't average were his clothes... which were way below average in Draco's opinion. Muggle clothing? No thanks!). The blond couldn't care less about the boy walking towards him but decided to speak to him anyways-- the more acquaintances he had, the better. Once the average boy stood next to him on another footstool, Draco turned to look at him. "Hello," Draco greeted, "Hogwarts, too?"
"Yes, Dobby, tell my mother I'll be down in a few minutes," the blond replied. The house-elf apparated away with a loud crack, leaving Draco alone in his bedroom. The boy stretched and proceeded to jump out of his bed and get ready.
"Agreed." Draco smiled
Oh fuck, Draco did not know that. He thought he would just have to say Harry was missing like he did at the ministry. He couldn't talk about it again, he just couldn't. Every time he says it, it becomes more real and all of this became further and further from being a nightmare that Draco could wake up from.
"You too, young man."
"Honestly, me too." Harry chuckled.
"Yes." Malfoy put his hand in his pocket and bought out two black tubes. "Do you want me to put them on?"
"Oh, sorry." Draco mumbled.
At around 11 o'clock, Draco and Harry got changed and started to prepare for their guests. Draco started to steam the pudding for its final hour whilst Harry put everything else that could fit into the oven. It wasn't long until their fried s started to arrive. They all exchanged gifts with each other. Harry received a grey Weasley jumper with a blue H in the middle. He put it on to match Ron, who was wearing his.
"No. You're too ill."
Draco was met with silence. No one knew what to say but, then again, what were you supposed to say in this situation?
"What? Why?" Hermione's voice broke Draco away from his mind. She sounded more awake now.
Draco felt like there was someone pounding at his heart. He pushed his hair back, trying to think clearly but struggling as thoughts were overcrowding the space inside his head.
"I don't know..."
"Are you okay?" Draco asked, concerned.
Draco pulled the material out of the box and placed it delicately against themselves as they walked over to the mirror. Draco could almost see the twinkle in their own eyes as they took in what they were holding. The Strawberry Dress designed by Lirika Matoshi.
Draco got out his phone and called Hermione.
"I mean... probably." Harry said seriously. Draco was halfway to lowering the cookie when a playful smile broke out on Harry's face. "Kidding."
And Harry Potter had protected them from a creep. And he had accepted them. And it happened all in a gay bar, which meant that Harry was in the LGBTQ+ community. And that fact filled Draco with hope, they had always had a crush on Harry during Hogwarts, not that they'd ever admit that allowed. Well, not to anyone but Pansy.
As soon as Draco was out of sight from the others, he ran, not being able to contain his excitement anymore. When Draco reached his dorm, he immediately went to the mirror and placed his new makeup on a shelf. He couldn't wait to see what he'd look like with all of it on.
"Never to early for a mice pie." Harry took a big bite from his mice pie.
"No you don't." Harry whispered.
"Do you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, take Harry James Potter to be your lawfully wedded husband, promising to love and cherish, through joy and sorrow, sickness and health, and whatever challenges you may face, until death do you part?" The vicar asked.
"I'll get it. What does everyone want?" Dean asked.
"Okay." Draco perked up at this and got out of bed.
Draco lightly slapped Belle's arm. "Don't make me cry, my make up is so good today."
Draco stopped and flicked their eyes over Harry's outfit, trying hard not to linger their eyes on Harry's thighs because
"He should be okay." A paramedic said. Draco let out a sigh of relief. "He is severely dehydrated and malnourished. There is a large laceration at the back of his head and he may have some broken ribs and we'll have to check for any internal bleeding. There is quite a nasty bruise and a few cuts on the side of his neck. His wrist is very badly infected but amputation shouldn't be necessary. He will have to be in hospital for a couple of weeks but he should be just fine."
"I have no idea."
Draco's head jerked up slightly when he felt Harry begin to stir. He immediately began looking for the signs that Harry was having a nightmare: sweat on his forehead, head turning from side to side, eyes scrunched closed and erratic movements of his arms and legs, but thankfully, there were none.
"Yeah, uh, a few people have asked me, I suppose." Harry rubbed the back of his neck, awkwardly.
Draco grabbed the box that Boo was in and handed it to Harry. "Merry Christmas, baby."
There was no way he could ask his mother, she would never in a million years get lipstick for Draco but what if his mother would get it for someone else? And that's when it hit Draco, he would ask his mother to get lipstick for Pansy. Both of their parents thought they were dating but they weren't. Both Pansy and Draco were about as straight as a circle and it was just easier to pretend that they were going out than going out with someone they had no interest in whatsoever. It kept their parents happy and that's all they cared about.
"I love it." Draco smiled.

"Guys, guys. Step back, let them have their space. All of you go wait by the cars, okay? I'll update you in a minute." Hermione said, pushing people back.
"Yes, Pans. I've watched you put on makeup enough times to know what everything is."
It was the Christmas holidays in Hogwarts and everything was perfect, except for one thing. It hadn't snowed yet. This was a big problem for Harry, he absolutely loved the snow. Playing in it, making snowmen, having snowball fights. It was the 23rd of December and Harry was starting to lose hope.
"Draco? Hey, why are you crying?" Harry asked softly, placing the box he had in his hands down and wrapping Draco in a warm embrace.
Draco pulled Harry close into him.
Draco took a deep breath and nodded his head. Harry took Draco's hand and they made their way towards the doors of the great hall. Harry knew Draco was nervous, no one but Harry had seen him in makeup before and he knew Draco was scared of someone telling his father. Harry vowed to himself that he would always make sure Draco felt safe and he would protect Draco at all costs.
"Hey Harry, it's me. I miss you but we're one step closer to finding you, it's a small step but it's a step. We know about the mislocator so if we found out who stole it from the ministry, we'll be even closer to finding you. Come back to me soon, okay and-," Draco was cut off when he heard the kitchen door open.
"I do." Draco slipped a silver ring onto Harry's finger. The inside was engraved with the words 'Until The Very End'.
"So am I." Harry smiled. "It would've been embarrassing if I passed out."
"Am I not allowed to love my beautiful boyfriend?"
"Beautiful?" Draco prompted, a smirk hidden beneath his smile.
Harry and Draco said their goodbyes to everyone before driving home. The two jammed out to some Christmas songs on the way home as this was technically the last day they could listen to them before it was 'illegal'.
"The fuck do you want Pansy?" Draco grumbled. "I'm trying to sleep on my boyfriends thighs, which were obviously gifted to him by a god or something because there's no way they'd be this big otherwise." Draco knew their brain to mouth filter didn't work very well when they were tired or sleepy but they couldn't bring themselves to care, it was the truth after all.
Harry faintly heard a piano gently playing in the distance. He had heard it before but it had always stopped before he managed to discover who played so well. Harry couldn't describe the feeling he had when he heard the piano, it was like he lost control of everything. The keys were played so delicately and with such passion, it was truly magical. Harry walked the way he thought the magical sound was coming from. As he walked, the piano slowly got louder and the tune became recognisable.
"It's the thought that counts, Parkinson."
Draco headed towards the lift and mentally prayed that he didn't bump into anyone because right now, human interaction was the last thing he wanted to take part in. Draco was just about to stop in front of the lift when he decided to carry on and take the stairs instead, there was less chance of running into someone and having to endure the awkward elevator silence.
It felt free being able to stand there amongst the mass of warm bodies. After years of denial, self-hatred and attempts to make himself 'normal', it finally felt comfortable to stand between the men and women that were all here for the same reasons as he was. It felt right.
It was also so incredibly frustrating because Draco knew what they wanted, they just didn't know how to get it. All they wanted was to be seen as a person, not a boy and not a girl. Draco had briefly wondered if they were transgender but they were happy in the body that they were in, they just really hated being called a boy.
"I didn't mean throw me over your shoulders like I'm a sack of fucking potatoes, you prat!"
"That's fine. Thank you so much!" Harry squeezed Draco.
"Draco." Harry growled before grabbing the bottom of his jaw and smashing his lips against Draco's.
"Okay, thank you."
Harry pretended like he didn't care that they were going ice skating but internally, he was screaming. Harry had never been ice skating before so he had no idea what to do. He was going to make a complete fool of himself. Draco had probably been trained in professional figure skating, actually, he had. Harry remembered Draco telling him about that. Harry held up his 'I don't care' act until they were driving to the ice rink.
Ron looked at him incredulously before picking up a pillow and screaming into it.
"I love you too."
It was only a second before Draco landed in Godric's Hollow. He lifted his head and took in the street before him. It was quaint, a slightly wonky road lined with cottages. The village seemed small and quiet, Draco couldn't see anyone else. He supposed more people would be in the town square and at the church. Draco could see the church's spiel above the cottages roofs. Draco began to make his way towards the church, walking slowly down the narrow street.
"Draco, don't think about that. He could still be alive."
The ball had already started so the corridor was empty. He and Draco had agreed to meet outside the hall so they could go in together. A few minutes passed and Draco still hadn't shown up and Harry was starting to become really nervous. He began pacing the corridor, thoughts swirling through his mind.
Harry ran out of the changing rooms as fast as he could. He wasn't really sure what had just happened but one thing he knew for certain was that he liked it. He wasn't really sure why he was running away either, he enjoyed what just happened but also slightly scared. Harry ran all the way to his dorm where he immediately shut the door and sunk into the floor.
To say Draco looked beautiful was an understatement. Fuck, it was probably the understatement of the century. Draco looked so much more than that, Harry couldn't even find the words to describe him. Draco seemed to be glowing, he almost seemed angelic. No, he was angelic. Harry was convinced that the pallet God used to create Draco literally made Picasso shed a tear. Draco's lips curved up into a small smile and Harry swore colours from every end of the spectrum went running in all directions.
Paranoia was running at full sprint around Draco's body. Panic really started to seep into Draco. Because of Harry's depression, anxiety and PTSD, he only slept at his and Draco's flat and Hermione and Ron's flat. Harry refused to stay the night anywhere else unless he was with Draco, Ron or Hermione but even then, he was still hesitant. The Dursley's, Voldemort and the war had taken a great toll on Harry's mental health and he struggled with flashbacks, nightmares and panic attacks.
"Potter, get off me right fucking now!" Draco said through clenched teeth.
As soon as Hermione moved, it seemed to trigger something in everyone else as they all rushed over. Draco knew it was all in good spirit but he couldn't help but feel annoyed as soon as everyone started bombarding him with questions and crowding Harry.
Harry gave Draco a fond look before turning his head towards the television. Despite what most people think, Draco wasn't a huge fan of extravagant and big dates. They much preferred dates like this, curled up on the sofa with greasy take out food and watching a movie that was simultaneously awful yet brilliant.
It was Christmas morning and Draco was getting ready to go to St.Mungo's. He had put Boo in a box with plenty of air holes, a blanket and some food. Draco also and some water for him but decided that it was not the best idea to put the water in the box. Draco drove to St.Mungo's. It was cheery inside, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Christmas music was being played through the halls and crackers were laying around so you could pull one with someone. Draco wanted to join in, he wanted to be happy but he found it impossible. He couldn't, not when Harry was lying unconscious on life support. Draco felt a tear roll down his face and quickly wiped it away before heading to the fourth floor.
"Huh?" Harry broke out of his daze.
When Harry was sure the door to his dorm was locked, he immediately grabbed a mirror. He admired the perfect kiss on his neck. Harry traced his fingers around it, his heart beat getting faster and faster.
"You wish."
"It's not going to hurt you, see." Harry cooed.
"Well, what if it's someone we know?" Ron suggested.
"Cutting out the pastry." Draco replied, a little confused.
"Thank you." Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's cheek.
"Do we have any tinsel?" Harry asked.
Harry walked over to the fire place and prepared it. Once it was prepared, he stuck his head into the fire.
Harry's breath hitched in his throat as he took in the appearance of the person in front of him. They were wearing a sheer black top with a lacy black bralette underneath, accentuating their slender figure. They had long legs that were covered with a black, high waisted skater skirt that sat perfectly on their torso. Their hair was slightly wavy and fell in front one side of their face, effortlessly messy. The platinum blonde turning different colours under the flashing lights.
"I'm going to make some tea, okay." Hermione said softly.
Belle laughed. "Don't worry, I wouldn't even dare. You'd probably claw my eyes out."
"Shit. Draco, meet me at my flat as soon as possible." Hermione said, worry laced through her voice.
"Pansy, calm down. We'll find him and who took him."
"Our flat?"
He felt someone take his hand. He looked down and saw Hermione who was forcing a very tiny smile. The two walked in silence to the front desk.
"I can't even..." Harry trailed off, still in awe of Draco's sheer beauty. "You're beautiful." Harry was convinced that that was the strongest truth to ever to have escaped his lips.
"Are they bothering you?" Harry asked Draco, his eyes flicking up the person that stood in front of them.
Draco looked over at Harry, who was leaning on his elbow. At some point, Harry had shed his glasses, and Draco was struck by direct emerald eyes staring back at him.
Draco was curled on the floor of the bathroom as blood dripped from where his dark mark used to be. He pulled a cigarette from his pants and lit it as tears streamed down his cheeks and blood hit the floor.
“I’m glad you like it.”
-------------
“Why’d you do that?” Draco startled at Potter’s voice in front of him, having completely forgotten his presence.
Draco felt the color rise in his face, the savior of the wizarding world was sat in his bed, had slept in his bed. His embarrassment at being found naked came crashing into the fiend that he was when he realized how desperately he craved his cigarettes.
Draco gazed dreamily at the tanned skin and black rat's nest next to him. He had woken before Harry. The brunette’s face looked so young when he slept, no longer a war veteran but just a boy.  If he got really close, he could see a speckling of freckles dancing across Harry’s nose.
-------------
Potter had stood then and walked out while Draco tried to look uninterested. Draco was jealous. Jealous of the friendship, jealous of the ability to cast a Patronus, jealous that he hadn't been on the right side, he was so green with envy that his skin crawled and he felt appalled at himself, disdain for those better than him was truly unbecoming.
When they made it to their room, they both went towards their respective beds.
Draco nearly agreed, wanting to agree desperately so that the aching throbs would stop pulsating through his entire body, but just as he was about to open his mouth he was reminded of the blemish on his forearm that he could not hide without his shirt.
“How do you take your tea?” Draco let the words fall out of his mouth before Harry could process his last statement.
“Oh, thank you, it’s beautiful,” Draco whispered his worlds, eyes unmoving from the delicate flower that sat behind the glass.
When Draco woke, it was with dread in his chest. He was up and dressed before Potter had woken. The soft breath coming from the other boy's bed made Draco long to be peaceful like the unconscious savior.
Slowly, painstakingly slowly, Harry stood them both and wrapped Draco in the nearest towel. Harry scooped Draco in his arms and Draco clung to his shoulders like a lifeline. Draco felt more than heard Harry cast a drying and warming spell over the both of them.
“I’m going to kill you if that’s true.” Draco laughed as he threw himself at Harry and began to wrestle him.
“Tilly” Her eyes gazed up at Draco's, he attempted to keep his own eyes kind under the stress of the situation.
Draco grabbed the other’s tanned and sinewy hand after a moment and shook.
“Draco, would you look at me? Please?” Harry’s voice was gentle and caring, yet it took all of Draco’s force to bring his eyes to Harry’s.
Without another word, Potter rose and stuck his hand out.
“No problem, it’s not exactly the most difficult spell.” Harry smiled down at Draco as they continued walking toward the dorms.
Harry snorted.
When Harry sat Draco’s body down on his bed Draco seemed to curl into himself further. Harry looked around the practically barren room until he came across the wardrobe that sat next to a large full body mirror. Harry dug around for anything less practical than a suit. The best he could manage was a knitted green sweater shoved to the back of the wardrobe and matching silky pajama bottoms. Harry rushed over to Draco’s curled form on the bed and began to dress him, shocked that Draco didn’t object. Draco seemed almost catatonic, the way tears flooded Draco’s eyes that held nothing but a blank stare.
“Uh, Draco?” Harry spoke from his bed.
“My name is Draco, and I’d like it if you referred to me as such. What is your name?”
They laughed desperately as they struggled against each other, falling onto Harry’s bed.
“Sorry.” He wheezed as he struggled; embarrassment creeping up his chest.
“It’s rude to stare, you know.” Draco tried to make it come off as biting, but it merely sounded like he was about to cry, and he wasn’t sure that was untrue.
When the holidays were over and they returned to their normal pace Draco became more trusting of his environment, even going as far as attending classes.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” Draco cried into Harry’s shoulder.
Draco hadn’t yet been able to calm the tears running down his face when Harry brushed under his eyes with his thumbs. Draco found himself shivering with the force of his emotions. Silently, Harry crawled onto Draco’s bed after toeing off his shoes and held Draco again.
“What if I don’t want to leave, what then Potter?” Draco heard his heartbeat in his ears.
-----------
It was Halloween, Draco wouldn’t know this except whenever he opened the window for a smoke he would glance around the grounds and he was surprised to see first years carving pumpkins by the lake. He checked the date on the calendar and sure enough; it told him that time had passed at a surprising rate.
At the announcement of Draco’s position, an onslaught of hexes came raining in his direction. Draco bit his lip so as to not cry out and allowed the hexes to fall, knowing full well that he deserved this and so much more. He didn’t cry, his father had told him years ago that it was unbecoming. Draco didn’t even recognize some of the hexes that hit him, creative youngins.
“I’m afraid not, unless you’re looking for some lingerie, then yes I have,” Draco spoke and then felt his body go rigid, why in the world had he said that?
“I love you too,” Draco whispered.
