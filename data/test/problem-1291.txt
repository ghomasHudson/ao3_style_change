Draco’s eyebrows arched,  “Is that so?”
Harry didn’t even remember standing.  Yet here they were inches away from each other. Both shouting now, breathing heavily.
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan showed up with dates and stared daggers at each other.  Their breakup six months ago had been a loud row in the middle of the Leaky Cauldron.  Harry was a little surprised to see them both behaving civilly.  Another round of champagne smoothed over any lingering tension.
“Granger and I were at school together.”
“I can’t believe you’re actually getting married.  You’re only twenty five.”
Harry tried to interrupt when Laghari came to a stop beside Shacklebolt, but she kept ranting.
Draco squared his shoulders, “It’s comfortable.”
Harry smothered a laugh. “Are they muggles?”
“Thanks for seeing to Ron.” She stood up with Harry, letting Ron’s legs fall to the floor. Harry wrapped his arms around Hermione and she kissed him on the cheek. He turned to Ron, who was finally out cold, and smiled Harry’s first genuine smile of the day. Or week, if thought about it. Christ, that was depressing.
Ron sat beside Harry on the edge of the bed and clapped his giant freckled hand on Harry’s shoulder. Ron looked Harry dead in the eye and said slowly, as though speaking to an especially dimwitted child, “No. I don’t.”
Ron arched his eyebrows.  “Your brooms? Mate, I’ve been riding this Cleansweep since I was your age.”
Draco shook his head, “Oh Pansy.”
Ron and Hermione shared another concerned look at this. “You’re not hungry?”
Davies looked at him, imploringly.
Technically speaking they were potions and did not contain much alcohol.  But because of the phrasing, he could ask people how they wanted to feel and give them a potion to accomplish this.  Just this side of legal. He was very proud indeed.
Laghari glanced at Shacklebolt, who watched Harry’s reaction carefully. She slid the parchment across the desk for Harry to see.
“Have I told you how much I love you, Hermione?”
She looked up at him. “Oh! Yes.” She looked at Mrs Weasley. “I’ve just thought that, well, you have so much knowledge. And skill! People like myself and Harry, well, we could really benefit from someone like you.”
Harry snorted a laugh. He wasn’t wrong.
“Mate look at this.” Ron brought over the latest set of gag gifts from Weasley’s Wizarding Weezes.
“You’re the prude, not me.” Harry said.
“No, I’m at the Daily Prophet now, actually.”
Olivia checked her phone again. “She says it’s not her problem. She’s not comin in on her day off.”
“Who even are you?” Potter asked.
“You’ve been together, what a month?”  Harry pressed.
“Alright.”
“Liar.” Ron mumbled.
He sighed and rubbed his eyes under his glasses, waiting for Shacklebolt’s newest undersecretary to catch up with him. He tapped the door with his wand to lock it behind him.
“That won’t be necessary, I assure you.” Draco said.
“I have to say, Harry, I’m disappointed in you.” Shacklebolt said. The Minister for Magic sat beside Harry’s direct supervisor, Head Auror Laghari. “I thought we could count on you.”
There was a long, heavy pause. The bumping base from the club blended into the background noise of inebriated arseholes and city traffic.
“Fine.  Anything to end this conversation.”
He narrowed his eyes at his so-called friend. “I hate you.”
Malfoy eyed the bin where Harry had been spitting his grape seeds.
“Forget it.”
Malfoy leaned on the wall beside him. “It will never work, Potter.”
“I would certainly never spend the remainder of my life in a war torn country with a man who runs a bar.  How foolish do you have to be to entertain such a notion?”
“Draco you’re thirty two.  It’s a bit soon to write yourself off as a confirmed bachelor." Harry chuckled softly. "Besides I was married and a fat lot of good it did me.”
“I haven’t tried one yet, but they smell delicious. Franc was just taking them out of the oven when I clocked in. I’ve had my eye on them all morning.”
“Diggory?!” Malfoy spluttered. “You dated Diggory??”
“Hm.”
You quit your job six months ago.”
Draco felt his cheeks heat. “I appreciate your concern, but I’m perfectly fine,” he said, suddenly finding the sleeve of his coat terribly compelling.
Harry scanned down the list and stopped when he found Memoir. “You think I should write a memoir? Is that wise?”
Harry could see his cousin processing this information and didn’t like where it was headed.
“When was this?” Ron asked.  He had a box of every flavour beans that he was eating entirely too recklessly for Harry’s taste.
“Who?  Oh.  He’s alright.” Ron flipped the jewelry box over.  “It’s not technically a curse, so you could bring it to Hogwarts.  It’s permanent ink, though, innit.”
“Sure.  Course it was.”  Harry smirked.
“You mean
This was met with raucous cheering.
Draco’s stomach flipped.
“Yeah, your..” he gestured vaguely at Harry.
“Ready?”
They stepped through the floo to the very modern flat Pansy and Roger had purchased.  Everything was clean lines and either white, chrome, or concrete.  There were no photos of loved ones, but there was an occasional piece of modern art placed in a corner.  And in the most prominent corner, by the enormous wall sized window was the most bizarre piece of workout equipment Harry had ever seen. At least he thought it was workout equipment.  There were two brown slats that could have been skis.  Some sort of pulley contraption.  Pansy Parkinson and Rodger Davies were standing in front of it clearly in the middle of a row.
“Revolting.” Draco sneered.
Finally, when Harry was about to shut down completely, Malfoy made their excuses. Outside the pub, Malfoy gripped Harry by his shoulder.
Harry appearated to the steps of 823 Dewey Lane. Hermione opened the door, Rosie in her arms. She took one look at him and called out for Ron. Ron came sprinting out from the nursery, with sick on his shoulder.
Blaise smirked at him, eyes sparkling. “Apologies. I must have been
They smiled at each other and Kingsley turned to face forward again.  “Of course. So I left Roberta after the ceremony was finished.  Vera and I went for a drink.” Kingsley’s smile grew to encompass his entire face.   He gestured openly with his hands. “We were married after a month.”
“Ah,” Draco sipped his beautiful 1995 Krug Clos d’Ambonnay. “I see.”
Malfoy tutted beside him and folded his arms across his chest.  Harry continued to watch him in the window reflection, unable to look away.  The light was dimming and the horizon was slashed with deep oranges and reds.  On top of which Malfoy’s reflection hung, spectral and beautiful. Harry sighed again.
Draco reached out and put a hand on his shoulder to stop him from moving about.  “I’m so sorry, Harry.”
“I haven’t been up to anything.”  Draco interrupted, his temper rising.
“I hate you.”
“How does he survive?” Harry, who also did not have a mobile, whispered conspiratorially.
Harry rattled off his order, hoping it was enough for the Weasley clan. Mrs Weasley was providing most of the luncheon. Harry’s only job was to pick up the pastries to serve with tea.
Draco set up immediately. From years of disappointment in the selection of pre-bottled potions at Slug & Jiggers, he knew there was a market for them. He started with Pepper-Up Potion, which he happened to have everything he needed. Plus, it only took a few hours, which meant he’d have the first batch ready by the time Blaise was home. Draco lost himself in careful measurements, precise dicing, and perfectly timed stirring.
“I thought it might be uncomfortable to mention it.”
“No!” Malfoy spat at the same time Harry said, “Fantastic!  Cheers.” She smiled indulgently at him and patted his cheek as she passed.
She brushed the fringe out of his eyes. “Bless you, Harry dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and let him be.
“Gotta gotta be damned because I want it all.”  Harry sang even louder.  He didn’t need the screen.  Instead he watched Draco’s hesitation.  Draco had the microphone in one hand and was glancing between Harry and the screen.
“And you think I don’t?” Davies asked.
Harry brought the tea tray out and sat in the armchair next to the sofa.
He thought he heard Hermione screaming.
“Saint Potter, his picture in every paper.” continued Malfoy.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Hermione asked, her eyes closing.
“And Seamus.. and Dean?”
Harry glanced at the corner where the Nordic Track had been and found it empty.
He shook his head.
“They bought a bloody dining set.”
“Because eet is too ‘ardy.” Fluer said, her voice hushed. “Now ‘urry so you can greet ta tante wiz out getting ‘er dirty.” She wiped Victorie’s mouth with a napkin. Victorie hopped down from her chair and ran out the door after Ron. Fleur followed them with effortless grace.
Right. So. Muggle London. Draco could do this. There was no doubt in his mind. He’d dressed Muggle. Sleek trousers with something called a blazer instead of robes. Draco had to admit a blazer sounded much cooler than robes. And he looked damned good in it, too. The dragonhide shoes he kept, as they were not too dissimilar to muggle shoes. He paused and glanced at his appearance in a cafe window. He did a half turn to see himself at another angle, proud of how muggle he looked. Proud of how muggle he looked.
“He is” Draco insisted quietly.
The smiles vanished from their faces. They helped each other up and stood to face him. Draco glanced around the cafe and found it empty. Franc’s shouting must have cleared out the other patrons.
“Yeah?”
Harry couldn’t breathe.
“I do, obviously.  Besides, pomegranates themselves are not eaten, only the seeds.  But that’s another matter.”
He sat down across from Blaise and Millie and folded his arms.
Hermione arched an eyebrow at Harry, who scowled at the filthy traitor that was his best mate. “It was fine, really.” Harry said.
“Forgot your instrument?” She glanced at his empty hands.
“But that’s because you’re stupid.” Draco sighed into Harry’s shoulder.  Draco could feel the deep reverberations of Harry’s laugh.
“I’m serious!” Potter shouted.   They seemed to wilt under his fiery gaze.  “Honestly” he muttered, once they started dispersing.  “Sorry about that, Malfoy.”
“What manner?”
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Well I don’t see what the problem is.  I have a good time, they have a good time.  Everyone wins.
“I was looking after Theo’s children one day.  They sat at the table in the kitchen drawing pictures.  Terrible artists, I must say.”
Harry hadn’t even realized the match had started.  He could have kicked himself for letting Malfoy distract him.  One of Krum’s cousins fell ill and Viktor had sent Harry the ticket.  He never let on to Ron how much he and Viktor had kept in touch. Especially since Viktor never married and asked after Hermione each time they saw each other.   He’d been delighted for a seat in the Top Box. Harry normally balked at any sort of public special treatment or fawning. But Krum was a friend. And Harry loved quidditch.   Sodding Malfoy distracting him. Malfoy who looked incredibly fit in a t-shirt of all things. Christ, that blue hair.
Granger’s sharp gaze flicked to Draco. “I was named after the daughter of Helen of Troy and King Melenaus. Are you a fan of Greek mythology?” she asked, still no smile.
Granger sighed, smiling.  “Ronald, you’ve said that nearly every day since we’ve been married.”
“Well, not exactly.” Her brilliant smile faltered.
Draco held out his arm, the unmarked one. Potter glanced at him, questioning, and Draco nodded.  Potter gave a firm nod back and held his wand to Draco’s forearm. A rope of blue light slid out from the top of the wand onto his arm. Draco tried not to flinch at the near (but not quite) burning sensation it left.  The light wrapped itself around Draco’s forearm twice and then into the shape of the ministry seal over them. He hissed through his teeth as it sunk into his arm, glowing brighter for a moment before the light dimmed to a barely there glow.
“Right. Well. You didn’t have to step in when you did. You could have let him hex me. No one would have faulted you.”
“Well, that’s a relief, innit.” He looked at Malfoy. “You know Harry saved my life from those dementoid thingies.”
The crowd erupted in cheers, the Top Box being no exception.  Harry glanced at Malfoy again. He was picking at black nail varnish.  He had painted his nails black. He had blue hair. He was wearing muggle clothing.  Who was this? How could it possibly be Malfoy?
Weasley stopped and turned back, his face cautious.
He drew a great shaky breath.  “He’s getting married.”
“No, you weren’t.”
“Do try to calm down, Harry.” Shacklebolt said, resigned and exhausted in the face of Harry’s rage. “We’re on the same side here. We all want what’s best for everyone.”
Harry shook his head.  “I’m not who I was at eleven.  And I’m certainly not who I was at eighteen.  Neither is she. I think she feels obligated to be with me, cause I’m well…”
“I was at a club.” Harry said, “I think it was the lights… and the music, maybe.”
“They’ve only known each other a month and they’re getting married!"
Ron closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Harry. Mate. He was not up to something.”
“What?”
“Oh, hello Harry, Harry Potter!” she said cheerfully. “This is Jacinda.” She indicated the other woman in the circular booth.
“Kreacher is not knowing if Master was having a bed day again. So Kreacher is feeding his Master.”
Draco sat at a table in the corner, near the back. He had a view of the entrance, but the place was dim enough that no one could see him looking out. Knockturn Alley wasn’t the most glamorous place to have coffee in Wizarding London but, Merlin forbid, he tried to appear in Diagon Alley again soon. Today showed just how poorly that worked out. At least none of the hexes landed this time. Draco tried to get into Gringotts last month and nearly had his arse hexed to pieces. Knockturn Alley, it was.
It seemed like an awful lot of work for a simple cup of coffee. Draco boiled water in the electric kettle. While it boiled, he eyed the coffee maker again. By the time the water was ready, Draco had decided he did not just hate coffee. He loathed it. And coffee machines, specifically. Instead of continuing to fight with the useless contraption, he found a cheese cloth. He draped the cheesecloth over the mug and held it in place with his hand. He held it beneath the cutting board and scraped a pile of bean powder onto the cheesecloth gently. Then he poured the boiling water slowly over the bean powder. Satisfied with his work, he shook the cheesecloth over the bin until all the bean-powder was off.
“What?” Harry asked, head whipping towards him. The potion exploded loudly, contained within Draco’s shield.
“Okay, I forgive you. I also need to apologize, obviously I was upset, but I had no idea about the pain you were feeling.”
“Any other reason you’re worried about it?” Harry asked, keenly aware that Hermione’s birthday was coming up. He figured two years of wondering paid a toll.
I hope everyone is doing well, after this chapter posts I'll also be posting the Hermione POV of Hogsmeade because WE HIT 1K KUDOS AND THAT'S INSANE!!!! Thank you to everyone who reads this story, comments, kudos, subscribes, bookmarks. Yall make my days! Also fun personal fact, I got engaged this past weekend! My fiance does read this story, so a little shout out to him as well. He frequently sacrifices tv show watching time so that I can write this fic and reminds me what day of the week is so that I update on time (and makes fun of me when I'm late). Love you babe!
Draco noticed how worried Pansy looked but she forced a smile, “Probably for the best.” She kissed his cheek chastely and Draco tried not to pull away too quickly as he fled the room. He barely made it to the end of the hall before he set off in a dead sprint.
"Potions done," He quietly got to his feet and carefully scooped the potion into a few jars. He corked all but one; Harry had gotten to his feet and shadowed him across the room.
“Wordless Cushioning Charm, honestly?” Draco groaned as Harry pinned his arms to the floor and attacked his mark, rendering Draco speechless as he writhed underneath him.
Vivid child abuse happens in this chapter (Lucius is awful). Feel free to read until asterisk and then pick up afterwards to miss the child abuse scene.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Yes, I’m aware of that now! I was mad at him! He called you that name, and I didn’t want to talk to him.”
“I will not! The boy is 14 – ” Madam Pomfrey cut herself off at the sight of Draco limping towards them. Her eyes quickly slid to the curtains then back to Draco, “What can I help you with, Mr. Malfoy?”
"Ron and Hermione think I went to bed. It’s going to be annoying sneaking back in, but..." He shrugged.
“We better, don’t want to miss the train,” Harry sighed, helping Draco to his feet.
“I don’t know, I just think about what I want to do and it happens. I don’t think a spell or anything.”
Regardless the reason, Lucius Malfoy, would now find himself at the bottom of the social ladder.
“What the – ” Draco muttered.
Who guessed that Pansy would figure it out? I love everyone's guesses about Luna. We have a little bit of time until she enters our story, but rest assured it will be before Harry meets her in canon.
“Nott saved me, Draco. I don’t know what he did but one moment I was being cursed and the next moment he’s leaning over top of me looking scared out of his mind. He didn’t know where to take me, but I was able to get him to take me to Hagrid’s. He left me there, worried that Hagrid would assume he’d done that to me. I asked him why he saved me and all he said was ‘you know why’. I told Dumbledore as much as I could remember about the boys who attacked me, but I didn’t say anything about Nott. I didn’t think I should, is that okay?”

“How can you touch me right now?” Harry whispered and Draco whipped his stare upward.
“Yeah, well, I’m sure you have a bunch more,” Harry shrugged, grinning down at him. It took him a moment for him to fully realize their positions before he quickly scrambled off, standing up and shaking his hair out. Sand flew in every direction and Malfoy made a noise of complaint, getting to his feet as well.
**Trigger Warning - child abuse discussion**
Love,
“I’ll let you two have some alone time, I’ll go run interference with Ron. I’m glad you’re okay, Draco,” She said briefly touching his shoulder before quickly leaving the room. Draco was thankful that Hermione had more tact that most people.
“We’re soul-mates.” Malfoy said again like that explained everything.
“No keep the table, I’ll hopefully only be a few minutes!”
“If our siblings keep finding their soul-mates before us, I’m going to develop a complex,” Fred complained, looking at George.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Not much. She apologized on Lucius’ behalf, saying ‘his frustration got away from him’. He hadn’t meant to hurt me the way he did. She can’t accept that her perfect husband isn’t so perfect. I’m going to ask her if he also hadn’t meant to cast the Cruciatus on me from the time I could ride a broom. I’m debating whether I should attach the memories with my letter so she can watch them in our Pensieve, or if she’ll just explain away those as well.”
Draco was sitting in the library studying with Pansy and Theo, racking his brain. Vince and Greg were sitting at the same table but they were definitely not studying. They were flicking balled up pieces of parchment at each other. Draco just could not remember what would help Harry breathe underwater. There was something tickling at the back of his brain, but it just wouldn’t come to him. He had been fruitlessly trying to figure it out the past few weeks and time was getting low to figure it out. The Task was just a few weeks away. Draco sighed heavily and got to his feet.
Harry chuckled and shrugged, “Better safe than sorry.” He hopped up onto the table again, an infuriating smirk on his face.
“Or potions, that’s an option,” Draco mused.
The three of them finished at the sweets shop and bundled up again before bracing themselves for the cold outside. They hustled down the street and into the Three Broomsticks, hurrying into the warmth of the pub.
Draco realized his earlier hypothesis that Harry would have company was most likely correct. He was cut off from saying a word when Weasley’s head poked out from inside the curtains, all of the skin visible already multiple shades darker than his hair.
Draco straightened his robes and tidied his hair. He knew that Harry preferred when he wore it loose, but had to do something more than his normal every day hair style. He had settled on tousling it in the way that it sometimes looked after he had been flying, somewhat slicked back but also loose. He knew he had done the right thing when he went to retrieve Pansy from the girl’s dormitories.
“Oh don’t cry over me, you sap, I’m fine. Don’t get your knickers in a twist,” Draco groaned, but Hermione could hear the worry in his voice.
“Shh, I just wanted to see his Mark. Obviously if it’s a big deal, you don’t have to show me.”
“Well, they could be! I mean they were both girls,” Ron defended.
“You guys look awesome! Supporting the Irish then?” Ron asked nodding to the shamrocks.
“Fuck,” He sighed. “Are they trying to get you all killed? There’s a wizarding saying ‘never cross a mother dragon’.  Dragons are incredibly protective of their young; the fact that they have mother dragons means they are going to be that much more vicious. I can only imagine how they will be when their nests are involved.”
Another thing Harry felt guilty for.
“There’s a thin line between love and hate,” Sirius pointed out, his thoughts drifting to James and Lily.
Many heads whipped their way at the movement of the door, whispers and words reached them but not for the reason Draco had expected. The name ‘Cedric’ was whispered over and over, far more than his own.
“How did you get rid of everyone?” Harry asked, rifling in his pockets, and plopped down onto the empty chair next to Draco’s bed.
“Bugger off,” Harry complained, staring at the floor.
“Exactly,” Hermione agreed.
Draco froze. He had been sure that he had been blocking Harry from feeling that. He had also hoped Hermione wouldn’t say anything. He would have to investigate his mental shields soon. “Did Hermione say something?”
Harry frowned, “What-“
She just wished she knew exactly what was going on.
“That’s for damn sure.”
“Pans, we both knew that was never going to happen,” Draco sighed. “And I am with him. I know, he knows, that’s all that matters.”
“Potter has been abducted; our worst fears are realized.” He said to Dumbledore, whose eyes only briefly flashed to Draco.
“How far into the forest did you go? Were they as tall as the trees?”
Draco hoped Harry liked his gift, he knew he was treading a very fine line in getting it for him. Draco had left a very detailed note in hopes that it would help Harry feel better about it. He also had enlisted Hermione’s help in assuaging Harry’s anxiety.
“Get Draco inside the Castle, Severus!” Dumbledore commanded and Severus instantly hauled Draco to his feet and pulled him towards the Castle. The pain abated and only residual pain in his arm and leg throbbed besides the now permanent headache.
“Harry decided to wait until the very last possible moment to get his things packed,” Draco complained and then waved his wand. Harry watched as his things started to zoom into his trunk.
"You okay, mate? Want me to come up too?" Ron asked clear concern on his face.
“Did you hear?” Pansy asked, settling down next to Draco at the table.
“Draco!” Harry yelled, falling to his knees next to the couch. Despite the fact that Hermione had seen the two of them together multiple times, it still struck her as odd to see the two of them interact further than insults and thrown curses.
Alexis
“No offense to her, but the surplus of people our age is kind of a huge positive. I don’t really miss the plethora of men the same age as my grandfather staring at my arse.”
Harry rolled his eyes again, but was smiling so Draco figured he wasn’t too cross with him.
Pomfrey slid behind the curtains around Harry’s bed and informed his guests that they had to leave. Within a few moments Weasley and Hermione ducked out into the Ward.
“Get up here,” Draco whispered, moving to the side so Harry could fit next to him. Harry did as he was asked, pulling Draco against him.
Ron looked down at her, his brow furrowing and his ears tinting red slightly. “Er, I guess.”
Harry nodded, “We had a row.”
“I never said our school was intelligent,” Draco shrugged. He wanted to ask about Weasley, but was pretty sure he knew where that conversation would go. “What can I do to help? Want me to throw you up against a few walls or desks? That helped last time.”
Longbottom looked up at him, eyes blown wide, “Er, uh, yeah.”
“Don’t you remember?” Harry asked and Draco squinted at him.
Draco felt his cheeks heating further, “I felt like ripping your bag open.”
Thank you again for the amazing reaction so far! Look for another update most likely on Thursday, which has a scene most of you might be looking forward to! Feel free to post your guesses as to what that is! Have a wonderful rest of the week!
“That’s rubbish,” Draco sighed, like it was the worst news he had ever heard. “Oi, Potter, best hope that this task has nothing to do with Potions.”
The whole group rolled their eyes in solidarity and were silent for a few moments.
Draco stared down at the floor, feeling his cheeks burn.
“It really is very interesting. What are the odds though? I expect there could be loads more bondings, but the odds of the three right people touching at exactly the same time are so insane! I could have grabbed her just a moment later and she wouldn’t have been touching you any longer!”
“I’m happy he has someone capable of keeping up with him. Someone whose got his back. Harry protects enough people. He’s going to need someone to protect him.”
Draco shrugged, a smirk on his lips, “Never gets old.”
Draco bit his lip, feeling tears welling up once again, but forced them back down. He absolutely would not cry right now.
“This is a weird form of punishment,” Pansy complained. “I’m so bloody bored.”
“Draco, what the hell happened here!? I saw your father leave the alley, but you weren’t with him. He left a trail of blood,” Hermione trailed off at the look on Draco’s face. Hermione didn’t curse often, but she just couldn’t fathom what she had stumbled upon. What sort of parent did this to their child? Hermione paused in her thoughts, her mind straying to Harry. The way he had begged her and Ron to send food and the story Ron had told her about how he and his brothers had rescued Harry from his Aunt and Uncle’s house before 2nd year, after pulling bars off of his window like he was a prisoner in his own home.
“What, no, what are you talking about? Draco, what are you keeping from me?” Harry asked, pulling away slightly to lock eyes with him. Draco wanted to lie, but knew it was fruitless. Harry would find out sooner or later.
(See the end of the chapter for
Theo stretched, “Gryffindor of course, fucking Scarhead got himself into the Hospital Wing just now. He wouldn’t stop crying about it. The only thing that saved me was Snape, he was looking for you, Draco.”
Harry had performed the Patronus Charm the other night like it wasn’t this massive magical feat. Draco had never known anyone of school-age able to perform it, let alone at 14. Draco wondered how long Harry had been able to do it, since it was such a ‘small’ feat in Harry’s eyes. Draco had never realized the spell that had hit him and the other Slytherins at the Quidditch match last year had been a Patronus Charm, but it definitely had not been the fully formed stag that Harry had shown him the other night. Draco only knew a handful of people who could summon a Patronus – full stop. He knew Severus could summon one, but he resolutely refused to ever show it to Draco. Draco was almost positive neither of his parents could, he’d never seen it at any rate.
“Ooh, I’ll match that for Diggory. He’s probably halfway to the Cup by now,” Blaise commented.
The next chapter is a longer one and is completely Harry/Draco! I'm super excited for it! Thank you for the continually awesome response to this! It makes my day to see more subscriptions, bookmarks, kudos, and especially comments! I hope you enjoy our introduction to Hogwarts! Some explanations about things to come in the next chapter as well! Let me know what ya think!
With that Fudge practically sprinted from the Ward and Draco rolled his shoulders a bit and ran his fingers through his hair.
Draco grit his teeth and closed the distance between the two of them. He caught Harry’s hands in his, ignoring the slight pain the magic emitting from them was causing him, and clenched them tightly. “I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere. You’re stuck with me, Potter.”
“Despite everything going on, Harry still seems much happier than he was last year. Draco has to be at least slightly the reason for that.”
“Ron, leave him be,” Hermione said grabbing his arm and tugging. Draco shoved Weasley hard out of his way, and took the last few steps to Harry, kneeling down in front of him. His face level with Harry’s waist.
Love, Alexis
“What did Pansy have again? Like a firework?” Harry asked.
“We’ll come with you!” Hermione said setting her fork and knife down, but Harry shook his head.
“All four were different?” Hermione asked and Harry nodded.
Draco grinned, despite himself, “It is, there’s nothing quite like the Manor in the summer. Although, during the winter, when it snows, it’s absolutely breathtaking. What was your home growing up like?”
A week later, Draco was at the end of his rope. His whole body ached and he felt worse than when he had Dragon Pox as a child, a condition that had almost killed him. Harry had ignored every attempt for him to explain himself and apologize. To make matters worse, Draco could feel how utterly miserable his soul-mate was. The whole school seemed to be against him, except for a couple of Gryffindors. Weasley was still not speaking to Harry, and Draco was about to be driven to murder if Weasley didn’t pull his head from his arse. Couldn’t he see that Harry needed him?
Draco barely nodded, “I figured.” His eyes still glued to the pack of sweets.
Harry’s silver stag leapt from his wand and trotted into the clearing before Harry let it dissipate. Malfoy stared at it for a few moments before shaking his head, and pacing a few steps.
“I want to try something,” Harry whispered, sitting up and pushing Draco back onto the ground next to him. They had cleaned up the classroom a bit, and Draco would transfigure blankets and pillows for them often. Draco had a particular skill in Transfiguration and was slowly bringing Harry up to speed. Harry realized that a lot of the reason it always seemed like the Slytherins were ahead of them in classes was due to the sheer amount of magic they practiced outside of school and before Hogwarts even started. Draco had explained how most traditional pureblood households had wards on them that blocked the Ministry from being aware of the underage magic going on. Hermione had been incensed to find out that part of their class didn’t have to go the whole summer without performing magic.
“Only when it comes to Draco, apparently,” Harry clarified.
Father’s brow furrowed and he glared at them harder, which Draco hadn’t thought possible. “Abominations,” Father hissed and Draco couldn’t stop himself from rolling his eyes.
“What did you do?” Harry asked, his brow furrowed. Draco stared at him, confused.
Draco stopped walking, grabbing tightly onto Harry’s hand. “I never
Draco bid Harry goodbye, wincing when he turned away from him. It was hard to look at Harry without being filled with rage. Most of the blood vessels in both of Harry’s eyes had burst, leaving the corneas almost completely red. Draco imagined that Harry’s captors must have silenced him and being unable to make any noise had forced the blood vessels to pop from the exertion. Draco remembered back to a time where he hadn’t been able to force down the screams and Lucius would silence him. Lucius had often had to heal his eyes as well. Couldn’t possibly allow Mother to know, after all.
By the end of the day Draco had cast more curses than he had since September, most of his housemates were avoiding him at all costs due to his foul mood. He stomped up to their classroom and summoned several plates and goblets to break against the chalk board at the front of the room.
“Right in one,” Pansy said buttering a piece of bread.
Harry drew a happy face.
“I’m not going bloody anywhere, you’re hurt!”
Harry shrugged again, breaking eye contact. “Uncle Vernon didn’t like it if I did better than Dudley.”
Harry threw up his hands, “That’s really it! I guess we’re going to have to get past them or something?”
Harry shrugged, “I only do it when I’m around you it seems. I can’t make it happen, or control it, it just does.”
“Call me Ron…” Weasley muttered quietly.
Harry smiled hesitantly and threw his hands up, “Ta-da!” He wiggled his hands a bit.
Harry’s mind flashed through the myriad of events that had plagued him. Lucius still refused to acknowledge what he had done, Draco’s mother seemed as if she believed Draco, but also didn’t want to outright defy her husband. Rita Skeeter had released an almost laughable article about a love triangle between himself, Hermione, and Krum. Draco had been annoyed he hadn’t been able to stop the article before it was published, but was trying to get Skeeter sacked on the grounds of writing about a minor without consent of the subject or a legal guardian. Harry’s scar had been aching more often. Sirius said there were whispers about Voldemort somehow returning and made Harry write him every time it ached.
“I guess a month isn’t too bad to be apart, earlier if you can Apparate,” Harry said quietly and Draco looked at him in surprise.
Did I spend 10 minutes trying to figure out when it's appropriate to use 'whom' over 'who', yes. Did that at all clarify my question about it in this chapter, no. So if I dropped a who where a whom is more appropriate, forgive me. I teach elementary school and there are definitely still moments when I feel completely out of my depth, who vs whom is one of them.
Just an FYI guys, this fic has very little angst. This is my emotional support fic during these trying times. So sometimes I will gloss over things that would otherwise be a huge plot point. There will still be things these boys are up against, but I'm not out to hurt them. Just try to keep that in mind. This chapter is a little longer than normal. I hope it will help you get through the shit show that will be tomorrow (and coming days) in America. I obviously know our American election also affects the world, so I hope everyone else is staying safe and taking care of themselves during this insanity regardless of where you live.
I was made aware by a reader that I use the phrase 'you guys' in my thank yous and that is gender specific. I wanted to apologize and say that I definitely was not trying to insinuate that only guys read my story and I am only thankful to them. I am thankful of every person who reads my story (and also maybe that dog on TikTok who uses buttons to speak and could probably read this for all we know) and will endeavor not to use gender specific language in notes going forward. So thank you times a infinity times infinity to everyone who has taken the time to read, comment, kudos, bookmark or subscribe here. I again am struck dumb by the wonderful reaction yall have given me. Love you tons!
“At the Cup, we were on our way out. The twins shoved into Ron, and I fell into Draco. He caught my arm and the marks appeared. We’ve been meeting in secret this year up until our fight last week. I’ve been ignoring him all week until last night.”
"You can say that again," Weasley muttered, his face and ears red.
“Ah yes, well, in my defence he needed to add them and hadn’t yet. He was going to make your potion get messed up, I was simply trying to save your marks for the day. If a few brains happened to hit his face before making it into the potion, well I’m a seeker and not a chaser for a reason.”
“Draco do you have any Pepper-Up?” Pansy asked as they got inside.
Draco scoffed, pacing away, kicking a chair on his way back to his potion, “Disgusting muggles.”
Harry bit his lip and shrugged, “That’s what I saw and heard. We each get a dragon.”
Suddenly, Draco had had enough, “Answer me this, if you would, Father. Why do you expect me to be a leader of my peers, but then want me to follow and be a part of your little ‘club’,” Draco asked using his fingers to make air quotes.
“Can’t we stay a little longer, Madam Pomfrey? He shouldn’t be alone,” Weasley whinged.
An echo of thanks rang around the room towards Draco. He had gotten each of them a gift. Draco had always been quite skilled at giving gifts, and they were the easiest way to gain someone’s trust and make them feel indebted to you. Draco also just really loved giving out presents.
"We will not hold Draco's family's feud with us against him. He has apparently somehow taken on the Head of his family and apologized to us. From now on the Weasleys are not feuding with Draco. You may hold Draco's actions solely against him, but not his father's. I accepted his apology and made it binding. You felt the magical agreement settle. I have not taught you the Pureblood customs, and I do not regret doing so, but Draco has been trained.
“Malfoy, what the hell? Get out of here!” Weasley shouted and Draco didn’t even spare him a look as he made a beeline for Harry. He was just a few paces away when he felt hands on his shoulders shoving him backward. “I said, leave! Can’t you see he’s had a bad enough night!”
Draco signed off with a small sun drawing and was gratified to see a small moon pop up before he closed his journal.
We're so close to 1k kudos! Once we hit that I'm going to post the trip to Hogsmeade from Hermione's perspective as a little outtake! It will be posted separately though, and not as a part of this story. Thank you all so much, you're honestly the best!!
“People can like more than one gender, Ronald,” Ginny hissed. “Luna, he’s ruining this. Let’s go for a walk by the Forest. We can stop by the kitchens on the way.”
“Say ‘sorely miss’ one more time,” Draco warned, flicking him in the ear, regretting it when he felt the pain mimicked in his own ear.
“Bloody hell, Harry! A warning next time!”
Harry stuck his tongue out at him, and suddenly Draco was gripped with a feeling of pure terror. “Where did you get this?! Who else has this kind of information? We are utterly fucked!”
“You do not cast spells at a man whose back is turned!” Moody growled, Harry noticed Zabini staring at the ferret with his mouth open.
Draco sniffed, settling down on the ground with Harry, laying his head in Harry’s lap. “You should have said something earlier, I missed that awful article she published about you with how sick I was before the First Task. No, there was word in the Common Room that she was about to publish a piece against Hagrid, outing him as a half-giant among other things, so I had to pull a couple strings to get it stopped.”
Ron blushed scarlet, “It was nice, er, a good night. How about you Hermione, did you and Krum have a fun time? I can’t believe you kept that a secret from us!”
“Yes.”
“Ooooh, well then, nevermind! Wouldn’t want to interrupt anything important with something as trivial as conversation,” Draco teased and Hermione blushed further.
Hermione grabbed the back of Draco’s robes, pulling him into the shadows next to the entrance to the Castle.
Draco laughed, “Yes well. Harry seems to really like him, so there must be something there. One out of two isn’t bad, at the very least.”
Draco left the loo and made his way back to the Castle. His friends would not be expecting him any time soon knowing he had a meeting with Lucius. Draco went straight to the classroom. It was empty when he arrived and Draco collapsed down onto the couch after renewing its transfiguration. Last thing he needed was it changing back to a desk while he laid on it. His face and body ached. Draco lay there with his eyes shut, feeling Harry’s emotions get closer and closer. He could only really detect anxiety and worry with an edge of anger. The door flew open with a crack and Harry charged through it, followed closely by Hermione. Draco passively wondered how they got rid of Weasley.
“Lucius was not pleased with me,” Draco shrugged, like it didn’t matter, and finished getting ready for the day.
“At least you have Parkinson, I have no idea who to ask.”
“Well, that’s sorted then, ready to go down?” Ron asked.
Draco sighed, looking briefly down at the snow at their feet, before bringing his head back up - a practiced smile on his face. “I appreciate it, but Father has made up his mind. Nothing I say or do is going to make him happy. I won’t allow him to figure out about my soul-mate. I assure you.”
“Get going, and stop worrying about me. I will be fine.”
“You’re right. I just wasn’t sure if you really wanted to. If we really wanted to keep hiding it, I’m sure we could figure out a way.”
“What can I do to help?” Harry asked, his voice desperate.
Hermione sighed, unlatching Crookshank’s basket. “I imagine you’re over-thinking it, Ron, Charlie seems like someone who likes to get you riled up.”
Draco nodded dumbly, watching as Harry lifted his fingers to run across the outline of the moon plastered onto his chest. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut, feeling overwhelming calm and a pleasant warmth fill his body. Draco felt his shoulders relax, a previously unknown tension draining from him.
Harry laughed again and swatted at him lightly, “I’ll cry if I want to. Hermione says it’s important to release your feelings when you have them.”
Then again Harry also seemed to perform wandless magic without even realizing, so what was really out of the realm for him to accomplish?
“Absolutely, I’m not quite prepared to deal with my House yet.”
Draco chuckled softly, “I highly doubt that. My hair must look like an owl was nesting in it.”
“I found him behind the Three Broomsticks. His face was bleeding, his father was not pleased with him and left him there. I thought it was just the cut on his cheek. He was out of it, but I thought it was just shock. I didn’t realize his father has cursed him too.”
Hermione quickly pulled on her jacket and scarf again, making sure to keep her gloves out of sight in her pockets, and hurried outside. She looked to the left and right and had to leap backwards to avoid Mr. Malfoy stalking past her. Hermione looked down as she did and saw what she distinctly recognized as blood being pressed into the snow from the tip of Mr. Malfoy’s walking stick.
“Harry?” He mumbled before everything went black.
"Draco has apologized to me for the things that happened and were said in 1st through 3rd year, and I accepted. He isn't as bad as you think he is, believe me I was skeptical at first too," Hermione said and Draco stuck his tongue out at her.
Harry set the paper down, “Shh, we’re okay. Just me. There’s no other map. It’s one of a kind.” He pulled Draco against his chest and rubbed his back comfortingly.
Draco focused back onto his potion, trying to fix what his neglect had caused, shoving down the vulnerability he was feeling.
“I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, do reach the age of majority today, the 5th of June, 1995.”
“What? Am I the only one that finds the image of Malfoy giving the Dursleys hell hilarious? They’re fucking awful! Imagine the Ton-Tongue Toffee, but better!”
Draco could not find himself to be all that excited about the other schools coming to Hogwarts. His parents had made him visit both schools before he started at Hogwarts. Durmstrang was full of a bunch of surly, fur-covered Northern Europeans, and Beauxbatons was a bunch of stuck up Frenchmen. At least Beauxbatons had decent weather, but his Mother had thrown a fit about Draco going anywhere but Hogwarts, in the end. Draco did wonder what theatrics both schools would put on for their arrivals, they were sure to show off a bit.
Draco hurried the opposite way, bolting up a back staircase that took him up a couple floors without him having to go near the Great Hall. He finally made it the classroom and was gratified to see that Harry was already there.
“Yeah, so Draco and I are soul-mates. Since the World Cup. Be nice to him,” Harry stated casually as he began loading up his plate.
It bounced off the cushion onto the floor. Harry scooped it up and turned the tv on. He put the volume down low.
The omnioculars were snatched from his hands.
“Are you insinuating that if I do not immediately resume dating that I will be hit by a bludger and die?  You’re awfully optimistic today.”
“I feel fine, honestly.”  Draco straightened his apron and adjusted his posture. “I’m thirty one now and I want more out of a relationship than what he could give.”
“So you’re with Jean?” Harry asked, unable to help himself.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose.
Kreacher said nothing. He began setting up the breakfast on the small table near the fireplace. Harry slouched out of bed and over to the chair. He should make a point to get out of bed every day. If he didn’t, Kreacher would start hovering. Worse still, he didn’t want another lecture from Hermione on the benefits of regular exercise. There was no reason for Harry to stay in bed, really. He should be grateful for his continued existence, not wallowing in self pity. Or self loathing, he thought reproachfully. Toward himself.
“Right. Then you can tell me what you could have possibly done to that poor woman that requires a written apology.”
“Of course.”
“What?”
If Hermione was concerned, Ron was horrified. His eyes grew wider and wider.
Draco couldn’t stop thinking about running into Potter last week. Potter crept back into Draco’s dreams, something that hadn’t happened since adolescence. Draco dreamt of being chased by Potter. And when he finally caught up instead of fisticuffs and flying hexes, Potter shoved him against the wall and stared into Draco’s eyes with fiery intensity. Just before the dream got good, he woke up.
“Technically I can’t leave until you’ve taken the Portkey.”
“Malfoy?” It popped out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop it.  It was definitely Malfoy. Jean had introduced him as Drake and he was dressed in muggle clothing but it was him alright.  “I thought that was you.”
“But didn’t you used to call out his name.. I just thought...”
As soon as he did, Malfoy shoved a glass of water at him.
Thankfully Draco let it drop.  They parted ways at The Leaky Cauldron and Harry stomped down all thoughts of Malfoy on a date in fit muggle clothing.
Shopping. Shopping was easy. He could do it in his sleep. Nothing to it. Or so Draco kept telling himself. Next thing he knew, muggles surrounded him in a horribly bright shopping centre at a complete loss for what to do.
“You’re with Malfoy?” Ginny said, her voice was sharp and pointed.
“FILTHY BLOOD TRAITORS!”
“Well, you needn’t be.”
Draco’s instinct was to take the piss, but somehow Potter just looked too defeated.  Draco didn’t have it in him to kick the man already down. Especially after his own recent disillusionment with love.
Harry snorted. “You’ll get used to it. I thought she’d never get over me and Ginny, but here we are.” At Ginny’s engagement party, Harry wanted to add. “What happened, anyway?”
“You’re not even using them.”  Harry plucked them from Malfoy’s lap and had a go.  He zoomed in on the other team. Their lineup was about even with Bulgaria’s.   Krum had more clout to be sure. It was guaranteed to be a wild match.
“The Dursleys haven’t seen a day of exercise in their lives, I can tell you that.” Harry said.
“I-  I-” Malfoy flushed, “I’m a licensed mixologist, if you must know.”
Harry flinched at the noise. It took him a half a second to realise the shouting was joy and excitement. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and let the terror drain out of him. Voldemort was dead. He was not at Hogwarts. No walls were crumbling around him, nor spells flying overhead. This shouting was joyous, not filled with horror. Harry took another breath and opened his eyes. He glanced around the table, relieved to see that no one appeared to have noticed his small mental breakdown. The focus was still on Mrs Weasley and Hermione, who had stood up and were talking excitedly.
“Andrew is Andrew Lawrence?  How did I miss that?”
The chorus sounded anew.
“But it, er, looks fine in the corner there, I suppose.”  Harry glanced at Draco’s horrified face.  “Or, it’s terrible?”
“Are you having a stroke?”
“Do you want to go back in?”
“Let him go, Dennis.”
“No one in the world could appreciate you enough, Pans.”
Harry gestured emphatically.   “Exactly. I told her we didn’t need to make any rash decisions.”
“Then you’d better call me Draco.”
“Former criminal, you said.”  Jean got a weird look on his face, one that usually precedes an argument.
Harry and Ron laughed.
“Tell me to stop and I’ll stop.”
“Havin a party, are you?” the girl asked him.
“Jean, how are you?”
“Three years.” corrected Vera.
The shower did very little to soothe his pounding head. The dreadful thing about drinking port was waking up the next day. He stayed in until the water turned cold. He trudged back to the spare room where he was staying to get dressed. His old school trunk was opened and its contents strewn about the room. He was grateful Millie and Blaise hadn’t found his room in such a state. He dressed and began putting things back in his trunk, deliberately ignoring a pile of sketches he’d drawn in third year of Potter in quidditch gear. It had been part of his planning for dressing as a dementor that year. He wasn’t sure where the dementor sketch had got to, he must have binned it. There was another similar pile by the bedside table, these of Potter meeting gruesome deaths in a giant hedge maze. Draco heard footsteps coming down the hall and hastily shoved them all back in the trunk.
The man looked Draco up and down. “Who are you?”
“Laars likes you!  You must be falling in love.  He only likes people in love.”  She turned away and went to answer the front door, another two glasses of champagne in her hand.  She was followed by Laars, who left a dusting of shimmering powder on Draco's shoulder.
“Sod off, I am not.”  Harry snapped. “He wants-”
“Is he alright?”
“OI. YOU LOT!” Ginny yelled. The table hushed as she and Neville stood up together.
“THE FAMOUS HARRY POTTER JOINING THE TOP BOX AS WELL.  CHEERS, MATE! CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF MY, HARRY IS. WENT TO HOGWARTS TOGETHER.”
They each gave him a hug before heading back downstairs.
“OR RAPSCALLIONS”
“Oh?” Draco asked innocently.
“Gollum?”  Harry was nonplussed.  And then astonished, “You’ve seen Lord of the Rings?”
He did. Gratefully. Harry panted and looked up at the night sky until his heart rate returned to normal. “Fuck.”
“Oh, no!  Now is exactly the right time."  Harry practically shouted.  He was on his feet again, "Because now is when it’s easy and fun.  You’re having a laugh with your friends and everything is light hearted and wonderful!”
Draco turned around quickly at the distress in Harry’s voice.  He watched Harry take a bracing gulp from his drink.
“Now you’re getting it,” Laghari said with a pleased smile. She woefully misread the timber of Harry’s voice.
“I know." Harry said. "I just do.
“But he-”
Draco just looked at him.
Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry and inclined his head toward the entrance.  Harry nodded and began weaving his way through the patrons to the door.
“Oh.” Draco looked down at the water in his mug that was pretending to be tea. “I think not.”
“They were bloody terrified.  Looking between us. Finally Ginny realized I’m not going to let it go. She’d booked them a week ago.”  Harry took in a shaky breath. “I’ve never been so gutted.”
“Shameful.”
Most of a bottle remained on the drinks trolley behind the sofa. Harry added to his tea. He kept expecting Mad Eye Moody to pop in through the flames. Or hear Sirius singing some muggle tune upstairs. Or Fred and George tossing him an extendable ear. Harry drank his way through his tea whisky combination and wondered what life had been like if he’d got to live with Sirius rather than the Dursleys. Ten-year-old Harry would kill for a chance to get out of his cupboard, let alone experience an entire house to himself. Twenty-seven-year-old Harry wasn’t sure which he hated more.
“No he’s not.”
“Mm fine.” Harry was too ashamed to meet his eye. He finished off the water. “Thanks for that.”
“Thank you, Weasley. You didn’t have to do that.”
Draco debated answering the call.  He could blame it on magic.  Mobiles were unreliable around magic, everyone knew it.    The phone buzzed again.  He could ignore it, couldn't he?  Draco tapped his fingers along the table.  It buzzed again.
“It’s just..” Dudley was visibly sweating now. “My girlfriend’s pregnant.”
Harry wandered through Grimmauld Place absently. It never truly felt like his own. The renovations helped a bit, he supposed. Harry settled at the table in the kitchen with a disappointingly tepid cuppa. He half expected Snape and Sirius to break into an argument at any moment. Or for Remus to bluster in robes a mess. Perhaps he’d hear Mad Eye’s loud clomping gait. Instead, there was only silence. None of them were here any longer. Harry trudged up to the drawing room in search of some Firewhisky.
The next day, Draco was tasked with doing the shopping. Tesco had been mentioned often enough in such a casual way that Draco never found the right moment to find out what the word meant. The one time he’d asked Olivia nearly fell to the floor laughing.
“And you’re not sleeping with him?”
“I’m just having trouble wrapping my head around seeing Draco Malfoy at Tesco. I seem to recall you saying something along the lines of ‘If you’re wondering what that smell is, Mother, a mudblood’s just walked in.” Draco had to hand it to Potter, that was a spot on impression of him. “Or do I have that wrong? Was that a different Draco Malfoy?”
“Ah well, technically I did.” He plucked at his uniform. “Auror, see.”
“It was a pomegranate.” he said primly.
Granger bit back a smile and nodded. "No problem." she said.
Draco selected the best of the sweetgrass leaves and tied four of them into four little bows.  Then he placed them in the pewter cauldron. The potion turned a more brilliant shade of green with each bow.  He was just setting a tempus charm when Pansy came through the curtain as well. She perched herself on the edge of his small work table.
He got a quill out and tapped it against a blank journal. He’d start with first year. That was when everything started. Diagon Alley, Hagrid, The Owlery, Malfoy at Madam Malkins.
“After the tenth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, I saw Vera again.  I was with some woman at the time, I can’t recall her name.”
“I’ve just thought- well.” She ran a hand through her mad hair and bit her lip. She glanced at Mrs Weasley. “I mean, I could help you, of course. I’d love to! I’d need to take notes.”
“Ugh. You’re the worst.” he said, lovingly.
“That is a load of tosh!  How are you not a total wreck?”
Jacinda nodded wisely. “Lovely to see you were such splendid friends, though.”
“Is that meant to be a frog?” Granger asked.  Draco nodded again.
Dudley waited until Malfoy was out of hearing before asking, “Is he your boyfriend, then?”
“Think something is funny, do you?”
“I’m shit at cleaning spells.”
Harry set his fork down as soon as the door closed. What he actually needed was a headache potion. He went back to bed immediately. He was so exhausted. Tired of caring, tired of trying. Tired of giving everything that he had over and over and over again, only to wake up the next day and find he had to start the same cycle over again. He felt like his well had gone dry and there was nothing left inside him but dust. But each day someone lowered a bucket expecting water. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could sustain himself on dust and guilt. Harry pulled the covers up over his head.
Ron gave him a weird look and Harry feared he’d said it wrong.  “Happy I mean?”
“I would believe you more if we hadn’t found you passed out on the floor clutching Gryffindor robes, mate.”
“Are we becoming friends?”
“You were saying?”
“Granger.” he said with some trepidation. He wasn’t sure what to do with his hands. Should he offer to shake hands? Stick them in his pockets? Would she think he was trying to go for his wand like Potter had?
“You should keep your options open, is all.”
“I’ll have what he’s having.” said a woman in her fifties.  The server nodded absently.
“How d’you know?” Ron asked.
Roger and Pansy continued to snap at each other.  Harry was having a terrible sense of dejavoo.  He and Ginny had bickered for three days before Harry finally gave up and tossed his Gryffindor bedding.  She didn’t want to feel like she was living at school any longer.  She wanted a grown up bedroom with grown up fixings.  Harry just wanted to feel at home.  He hadn’t realized his taste was juvenile until she'd said it aloud.
“Does this mean I can set you up with my mates?”
“I haven’t been keeping anything from you.  It just hasn’t come up.”
“Did it?” he said morosely. He supposed it did. His aunt tortured Granger and Draco did nothing to stop it. He’d harassed her all of their childhood. Tried to kill her husband and Potter. He wouldn’t blame her if she hexed him on the spot. Draco didn’t understand these Gryffindors and their willingness to let go of their entirely justified vengeance.
“That’s not a real thing.” Draco decided. “You’re having me on.”
Weasley stood, evaluating the drawing board.  “How were we meant to get Merlin from a chocolate frog?”
Malfoy turned and stared at him.
Ron eyed the children mischievously.  “I dunno. Victorie’s pretty quick in the air.”
“Excuse you.”
“Ced-,” Harry had trouble getting his name out. “Cedric was a student who..”
Harry’s eyes found Malfoy’s and instead of the mocking he rather expected, there was a sad, knowing look that hit Harry right in the gut. Malfoy knew about nightmares. And he reckoned a little something of guilt, too. It was a lot for Harry to take in. Nothing about this day seemed real, least of all Malfoy’s empathy.
Kreacher opened the door and brought in a trolley laden with enough food to feed the entire Weasley clan. “You didn’t have to bring it up, Kreacher.” Harry said, apologetically, “I was just about to head down to the kitchen.”
“You’ve got friends, have you?”
“Are you thick? I’m shopping. You’re following me around, watching me put items into my shopping trolley. How do you not understand what is happening?”
A small smile forced its way onto Granger’s face. “I couldn’t.”
He could have sworn Malfoy’s eyes dropped to his lips for half a second before he disappeared.  Then he was gone and Harry felt as though he missed the last step on a staircase.
“You have an actual MANOR?!” she shouted. “I mean we knew you were posh, love, but honestly.”
Malfoy’s lips thinned and he nodded.
“Have you been drinking and brewing? How very dangerous.”
Harry sat back in his desk chair, horror spreading across his own face.
Draco rolled his eyes. “An orphan who also happens to be the most famous wizard of all time. And a fully grown adult.”
Olivia’s face lit up like a Christmas tree. She gave Harry a full inspection, from the bottoms of his raggedy jeans to the tight fitting, if threadbare, t-shirt that wrapped around Harry’s biceps like clingfilm. She turned to smirk at Malfoy. “It’s interesting because Harry, here, doesn’t seem Posh at all.”
“Er, yeah. And while he was sorting it out, the Magpie seeker caught the real snitch. Ref called the game and Farraux lost it. Started throwing hexes.”
“See, you sound like Malfoy. You act like Malfoy. But you’re dressed as a muggle. Surely you can understand why I find that perplexing?”
“But I changed my mind.”
“No, that’s not it.. I’ll think of it. Just give me a minute. And who’s this little one?”
“Everything I do is wrong.  It always will be." he said petulantly.  "That’s why Jean didn’t want a life with me.  I'm wretched. I’m going to be forty and never been married.”
Draco did not respond.  He had five minutes left before he needed to take over for Lou and he still needed to add the alihotsy he was muddling.  Pansy continued to swipe through potentials on her mobile.
“It will only be a year without magic.” He tried to sound bracing.  Harry clapped him on the shoulder. “You’ll be fine.”
“Is this your doing?” she asked Draco.
Weasley was still a bit standoffish.  Thirty years of family feuding was bound to leave residual… not quite resentment.  Draco was a part of their friend group now, thanks to Harry dragging him along welcome or not.  Though Harry had been absent more often, lately.  It likely had something to do with muggleborn American he’d been seeing.  Muggleborn Americans did seem to be Potter’s type.  Granger, though.  They were getting on well.  She was rather something of a genius.
“Come on Potter. If we’re going to keep running into each other, you should come meet my friends.”
“Have a seat, Draco.”
Harry nodded dejectedly,  “Which is just brilliant. So I asked her."  The crowd around them cheered loudly.  Harry waited for the noise to die down a moment, "she said she doesn’t know that she’s ever really loved me.”  Harry felt weak and tired, like he hadn't eaten in a few days.  He sighed and buried his hands in his hair, resting his elbows on his knees.
“Yeah.” George stubbed the end of his cigarette out and vanished it with a wave of his wand. “It was just..”
“Kreacher’s at Hogwarts?” asked Ron.
Malfoy jabbed Harry in the chest with his finger.  Harry sighed.  “You’re right.”
“Right you are!” Mrs Weasley came out of the kitchen. “I had a few left from breakfast so I threw them in.”
“YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE” he screamed at the phone. Draco hadn’t realised they gave mobiles names, or that they had sentience. He wasn’t sure how he felt about this revelation. How could a small rectangle made of glass and plastic be offensive?
By the time Harry got to Mood freshly showered, there was only a half hour remaining before Draco was free.  He decided not to go for the Potion specialty of the Cheery Cherry Bomb and opted for a pint while he waited for Draco’s shift to be over.   Harry enjoyed being known at this place more than anywhere in Diagon Alley. Here he was the broody friend of the owner instead of The Chosen One.  It was a nice change. Fewer adoring fans and gobs of personal space.
“What?”
“Are you going to marry him?”
“Besides” Teddy said, “You’re meant to be helping Nan, not playing about.”
“Only bloody brilliant!” O’Dogherty and Ron beamed at Harry.
“Oh, it’s over.” he said to Dudley.
“What of it?”  Malfoy’s posture changed.  He sat up straight. The sneer was back in his voice.  Harry didn’t remember it leaving but he was sorry it was back.
“Is Master Harry done glaring at his eggs now, sir?”
“Of course not.” Pity written all over her face.
Harry leaned forward, he saw Draco’s eyes widen for a half second. Harry placed a gentle half kiss on Draco’s cheek. He stayed a moment too long.  Their cheeks dragged against each other and Harry was grateful he’d shaved.   Draco moved slightly and Harry backed up quickly.  He ran a hand up through his hair at the back of his neck.
Malfoy caught his eye for a brief, unreadable moment and quickly darted away. His gaze slid over to Olivia and said ruefully, “I was a twat at school, is what he is politely implying.”
Draco shrugged.  “I wasn’t about to be a side piece.  That’s just not on.”
Harry allowed himself to be dragged by the elbow.  “London is huge, millions of people live here.  It was going to happen.  Inevitable, really.”
Harry supposed he never truly appreciated Mrs Weasley’s cooking, not before the Forest of Dean, anyway. Hermione looked to be of the same mind. Sometimes they caught each other’s eye during family dinners at The Burrow. Particularly when Mrs Weasley served something with mushrooms. A fond smile between them, which was always followed by mouthful after mouthful of delicious food. When he and Hermione had spent months on end accio-ing fish and gathering mushrooms, Harry used to dream longingly of dinners just like this one. Not to mention all the days Harry spent hoarding food at The Dursleys. He tried to ignore that as much as possible.
Draco tuned him out.  He knew what he was about.  He also knew he had Potter to thank for his leniency in the sentence.  Two years on house arrest, the first of which was to be served without a wand.  Potter had to deliver him from London out to Azkaban where the tracing charms would be placed.  From there Draco was on his own. Wandless for an entire year. Not allowed out of his flat for two.  The idea of being so vulnerable for so long made him ill. He didn’t see why they couldn’t just place the charms on him after he’d been sentenced at Wizengamot.  Draco strongly suspected the trip out to Azkaban was strictly for intimidation purposes. A test, of sorts, to see how far he was willing to prove his good will. He couldn’t prove it though, and he was in no position to make a stir.
Harry had no words.
Draco blinked at Harry a few times and turned away.  “Noted.”
Harry heaved a sigh and ran a hand through his hair.  “Not this again, you know you’re fit Malfoy.”
“ONE!”
“No.  I don’t think she loved me.”
Malfoy followed Harry through the carriage doors to the dining car.
“Sounds wonderful, I’ll have one.”
“You sound like a bunch of Hufflepuffs.” he sneered. “I don’t need to be mollycoddled like a simpleton. I will be fine. I didn’t go to Azkaban with my father and I refuse to flee the country like my mother. I. Will. Be. Fine. Now, if you’ll excuse me,” he cast a quick tempus charm, “I must be going.” He straightened his robes and strode out the door.
“You’re the one who wanted to get them a gift, mate.  Not me.”
What Harry remembered from that day was Malfoy’s reflection in the window.  Draco looked on the outside the way Harry felt on the inside. He thought about it every time he accompanied a convict to Azkaban.  The emptiness in his breathtaking eyes. Harry’s mind dwelled on the image periodically through the years. Particularly when Ginny was traveling, gone for days at a time and Harry found himself staring out windows, waxing maudlin.
“Harry?”
Draco glared at his coffee, his expression dour.
“What?  When!” Pansy whirled on him.  She poked his shoulder with her red painted fingernail.  “When was this??”
“You remember Draco?” Harry said.
Harry’s spirits plummeted. “That was Ron’s team, actually.”
Harry and Malfoy eyed each other carefully. “Er..” Harry said thoughtfully.
“Breanne, sorry.” Harry adjusted the bag on his shoulder and attempted to step past her.
“I LOST MY BROTHER BECAUSE OF YOU!” He screamed at Draco, flecks of spittle flew out in every direction.
“I went through his pockets.” Pansy said.
“That is fantastic!  It’s an at home projector.  You can watch a film on a wall.” Harry said, delighted and successfully distracted.
Pansy gave him a look over the top of her mobile.
“It’s despicable, that is.”
Andrew popped his head into the kitchen.  “Sorry, where’s the loo?”
“He was just trying to protect his family.  Not his fault they were complete shit.”
Draco narrowed his eyes as he handed over the coins. He stalked out of the shop amid further whisperings. Just as the door closed, Draco felt something sizzle and fly by his cheek. He wished it was pure luck he’d taken to wearing one of the shield hats from Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes instead of wearing it for necessity. It took too much effort to maintain a shield around his person and still be able to manouevre the shops. The charmed hat would have to do.
Draco looked down where Potter’s finger had just touched him. He slowly brought his eyes to meet Potter’s and raised an eyebrow. “Yes, well, it didn’t take the first time, did it?”
Malfoy continued on, as though Harry hadn’t interrupted. “Saint Potter, who hands out autographs to his adoring fans.”
Not that different, indeed.  Draco glanced around the shop but no one was paying them any attention. He sighed and took the microphone.
All three turned to face Harry.
He stormed out, slamming the door behind him. The crowd of onlookers surrounding the Head Auror Office dispersed immediately, all looking terribly busy suddenly. Breanne had been waiting to take Harry to his next appointment. He stormed past her. Harry didn’t give a shit. He was sick of the ministry and its bollocks agenda. Ten years later, and it was the same fucking problem.
Harry remembered his awkward dates with Cho when she wanted to talk about Cedric Diggory. He couldn’t imagine how much worse it must be for that person to be your twin rather than your rival. There was so much to unpack. Could any relationship sustain that much pressure? Christ, how horrible.
“Don’t see the point.” Harry shrugged.
Fuck it, he was having a bed day.
“Alright?” Potter asked.
“Alright?” Potter said.  Thank Merlin he didn’t try to shake his hand. Draco nodded in greeting, not looking Potter in the eye.  He tugged the beanie down a bit.
“Here.”
Pansy’s eyebrows arched, made all the more impressive by her perfectly rendered makeup.  “How long ago was that?” she asked.
When he got out of bed, he grabbed his silk dressing gown and went to the kitchen. Glared at the coffeemaker. What right did it have to prevent him from caffeinating? It was unacceptable. He knew he was supposed to pour water into it. And he knew he had to transform the coffee beans into a loose sort of powder. He’d start there. Draco opened the bag of beans and poured out half the bag onto the cutting board. Then he got his knife and began chopping, like he would for Potions. Once they were chopped to bits fine enough, he retrieved his mortar and pestle from his Hogwarts trunk to grind the chopped bits into a powder.
Harry did know this.  And it delighted him to no end to hear Malfoy try.  The time he’d gotten Draco to say “Fuck off Jimmy” sounding like Johnny Vegas would live in his memory forever.
Harry had always known Malfoy was an idiot.  He was only proving Harry right. “She absolutely wants to stay.  I mean look at them. Wouldn’t you rather stay with Humphrey Bogart than whoever that other tosser was?”
“Would you like to sit next to each other?" she asked in heavily accented English.
Granger swivelled her heavy gaze fully to Draco. “Bit of an understatement, I’d say.”
“You think I should be more like you, Potter?  Sleep with half the muggles in London.  Meanwhile not getting involved with a single witch or wizard?”
Harry ached for them all and what should have been. The lives they should have had.  He ached for Lupin and Tonks. For Teddy. For Colin Creevey and Dennis. They were only kids. Harry wiped a tear from his face. He flat out refused to think about Fred and George. If he had gone to the forest sooner, would Fred still be alive?
“I just-” Harry sighed.  “I never noticed it before.”  Harry lied. Dreams didn’t count, really.  “You looked a bit.. sad. I was trying to be encouraging.”
Draco appeared to digest this. “How does it work?”
“It’s just..” Ron shrugged. “We’re a bit worried, is all.”
“Auror Potter!”
“Now. Let’s not be too hasty in cutting ties just yet. You’re young.”
Harry tried again, “Do ya faancy seein' a movie with me?
Breathe in two, three, four. Breathe out two, three, four, five.
Harry grumbled again. A pair of muscular arms ungraciously rolled Harry over until he was face up.
Potter kept in step with Draco and they moved to another corner of the shop. “And I’m not following you.”
“No, I’m meeting Ron at the Pub. I’m late actually.”
“Yes, I hear congratulations are in order. I’ll get the next round then, shall I?”
“Er…”
“That’s me.” He sighed. He hated wizarding pubs.
“Yeah well, she didn’t want to ruin my birthday, did she.”
“Absolutely.”
“Oh, that must be it. Another school mate, eh? Sounds like Draco was quite a little berk at school.”
Olivia waved her hand, “Oh pish posh. She’ll just be glad we solved the problem. She’s been looking for a reason to get rid of Franc, besides. Can you really bake?”
“Hmm.”
“Ron’s not here,” Granger said. “If that’s who you’re looking for.” Her shrewd gaze let him know she knew Draco was looking for Potter.
“Hiya.” He said.
“It’s a
“Malfoy?” Her face was white as a sheet. Her eyes flicked to his bare forearm, taking in the new floral addition to his tattoo.
“Go on, you’ve a bestselling cookbook to write.” he told her as he filled one side of the sink with hot soapy water.
Kreacher’s sombre eyes bored through Harry. He cleared his throat. “Well, alright then. See you later.”
Malfoy’s eyes went to where Harry’s hand touched his shoulder and narrowed his eyes.  Harry sighed and let his hand drop.
Dinner went by quickly.  Minimal awkwardness there, thank Christ.  Luc was weird.  Something about him threw Harry off kilter.  But he had to admit Draco looked happy, really happy.  It was nice to see him content, Harry thought.  He looked good in his casual muggle t-shirt beneath a lovely cardigan and tight fitting jeans. Harry could never tire of seeing Draco Malfoy in muggle clothing.  Every iteration of muggle clothing looked fit on him.
“To remind you of the impropriety of asking a detainee to disclose his sexual history.”
Granger didn’t smile. She looked from him to his muggle friend and back to him. Some of the colour had returned to her cheeks. She stuck out her hand to Olivia.
Harry went in.
“I’ve had relations, Potter.” Malfoy looked around to ensure they were still alone.  “If you must know.”
Harry nodded and examined the scuff marks on his trainers.
“YOU FUCKING CUNT.” Franc had a knife and Draco’s stomach plummeted. Was he going to throw the knife?
“Better get him outside, fresh air.”
“SEVEN!”
Potter paused. His brilliant green eyes widened behind his glasses and he looked askance. “Did you just say something nice about Hermione?”
Draco’s eyes followed every passerby. No black messy hair to be seen.
“You look it.”
“I hear they took Rookwood in? Congratulations are in order, eh?”
Potter shook his head slowly and looked out the window.
“It’ll give you a chance to get back on your feet.”
Ron’s eyes narrowed.
“How’s your head this morning, love?”
Malfoy’s face darkened. “I think he’s asking about the war.”
“Fuck.”
Olivia coughed beside him. He gestured to her. “This is Olivia. Olivia, this is Granger.”
The sand in the timer emptied out.  It began glowing green and emitted a small chirping sound.
“Er, yeah. I suppose.”
“I don’t!”
“Alright.” Harry said and Andrew trotted away.
Draco hated this. What happened to cunning and cut throat Slytherins? Sure it was a stereotype, but he could really do with some callus backstabbing instead of this concerned friend nonsense.
Harry wanted to sleep for a decade.
A few hours later, with the party in full swing, Harry found his usual escape spot behind The Burrow occupied by George, who was packing his cigarettes.
“I know, I know.” Weasley looked him up and down. “Stay out of trouble Malfoy.”
“Fuck.” Draco said loudly into the microphone.  He hastily shut the machine off.  They were coming over to say hello.  Draco glanced at Harry.  He put a hand on his shoulder and gave a little shake.  Harry blinked rapidly a few times and got to his feet.
Draco nodded again and tapped the board to add more detail.
“Not once.  I mean really, we use it for the Floo.  That's just foolish.”
“That means it’s early in the relationship.  That’s why I never took anyone on expensive dates.”
Pansy bit her lip and shook her head slightly.  Draco narrowed his eyes.  "As in you spotted a slip of paper on the floor and read it before you binned it?”
“What are you going to do, then?” Hermione asked over tea that evening.
Draco started and looked at Weasley.
“Oh, Oh!” Mrs Weasley looked up, “Oh, I’m sorry dear, I didn’t mean-”
“Oh, hm.” Olivia patted his arm. “I’m sure he’s mentioned you to her. Don’t worry about it, love.”
Draco looped an arm through Harry's, and began guiding him out.  “I’m so sorry.  We’ve just run into Ginny Weasley.”
Olivia snorted with laughter. “Course not. This one didn’t even know what a mobile was! Can you imagine?”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “Not just this moment, you idiot.”
“Doesn’t mean I should have done without parents, Malfoy.”
He poured himself another glass and wandered about Blaise’s extremely posh flat. He had a breathtaking view of London. The living room looked out over the city, without anyone being able to look in. It was surreal to be surrounded by muggle skyscrapers instead of the gardens of Wiltshire. The pleasant grounds in Draco’s mind’s eye shifted. The swish of cloaks, The Dark Lord’s cruel laugh surrounded by Death Eaters, Draco among them. Draco sighed. He wasn’t drunk enough for those thoughts, either. A third glass of port should do the trick. Or maybe a fourth.
Draco pointed his finger at Harry, “That.”
Harry bit back a smile and was glad Mrs Weasley had joined the others to greet Ginny at the door, lest she hear her cooking was too hearty. He stayed at the table with Bill.
“Nah, mate. Harry’s right, innit. That was my reaction too.” Dudley said, shaking his head. He looked back and forth between them intently for a moment. “How are things?”
was implied.
Ron bemusedly joined in Hermione and Draco’s laughter.
“Lockhart forced me to do that and you know it!”
“Draco? You alright?” came a second, a little higher pitched voice. One that made him a little uncomfortable.
Malfoy stared at him.  He took a deep breath that looked like it cost him.  “Hello Potter.”
“How have you got your wand out with this great lump?”
“You’ve got to learn to control your emotions.”
“Er, not Malfoy Manor.” Harry said quietly, not meeting his eyes. “She means your old flat, apparently.”
No, Draco spent most of his post-trial years thus far tending to his mother. Looking after the Malfoy estate. Ignoring his lack of amorous opportunities. After a few years of back and forth between the Ministry and his solicitor, they’d come to an agreement about what the Malfoys would be permitted to keep. Draco still had that odious task to look forward to this week.
“Right.” Harry pointed a finger at him and laughed.  “That.”
They paused.  Draco licked his lips and Harry tried not to notice.
“GINNY’S HOME!” George yelled. The Weasleys turned to the clock and saw that Ginny’s name was indeed at Home. George and Mr Weasley dashed out the front door to greet her.
“Ow! Er.. Oh… Er..  How’re you, then?”
“You went a bit daft there for a moment. Just wanted to make sure you weren’t about to collapse or nothin.”
“That’s awful Harry.  I’d be devastated if Hermione said that to me.  Genuinely gutted.”
“Look, I wanted to speak to you about a potential business venture.”
“Oi, you lot!  Bugger off!” he yelled at the onlookers.
“Breathe” someone whispered.
His second week of leave he thought about Hermione’s lists again. He dug the Ameliorative and Productive Outlets for Harry list out of his desk drawer. Go for a walk. Harry glanced outside at the rain falling pitifully down. Pass. Do a puzzle. Get a book of sudoku. He skimmed down until his eyes caught on the Memoir line. Obviously, he wouldn’t publish it. Too much dark magic. Too much personal business. But she had a point. The mind healer he’d gone to after the war recommended journaling as a coping mechanism.
Draco flushed and looked away.  His voice wasn’t as steady as he’d like, “He is.”
“I’m coming out of my cage and I’ve been doing just fine.” Harry began singing.
Malfoy’s face was blank of emotion. “Yes, I heard about that.”
“Shit.” Ron stood up and scratched his nose.  “Yeah, we went to a football match.  Me, Davies, Neville, Malfoy and Luc.  We’d have invited you but..”
“Jean and I never wanted to get married.  We’d talked about it a few times, mostly how abhorrent it seemed.  Married couples always seemed to be in a spat of some sort, most often about children.  Theo got married, you know. As soon as he produced offspring he and his wife stopped having sex altogether.  He told me they were too exhausted. Nappies everywhere. Waking up at all hours of the night.”
Harry watched Draco’s face grow apoplectic out of the corner of his eye. His two childhood tormentors in one place. How could Harry have ever thought this would be in any way beneficial for him? Of course it wasn’t. It was a horror from start to finish.
“Potter.” Draco hissed.  “Now is not the time.”
Malfoy chewed his lip. His lips looked soft. He probably used some fancy balm on them, made of unicorn tears or some shit. Harry ran a thumb across his own bottom lip.
Harry didn’t feel young, he felt ancient.
“You might not remember, Potter, but I was a bit of a shit growing up.”
"Have you seen them?” Harry asked.
“Just down the hall on your left.” Hermione replied.
Harry shook his head rapidly, like a puppy just in from the rain.  He took a deep breath and finished the drink in his hand. Harry stepped away toward the door frame and Draco let his hand drop.
He sat down at his desk. He swept some of the crumpled up pages into the bin. He spun in his chair and handed the journal to Hermione. “Your memory’s probably better than mine.”
“Very funny.”
“Hand me those, would you.”
Potter kept his eyes on his trainers.  He gave another shrug, “What can you do, eh?”  he looked up at Draco, his green eyes intense.
“Brooding again, eh Draco?”
“I-” Draco started. “I beg your pardon?”
“You have no sense of decency, do you?”
“You’ve already made that remark.”  Malfoy drawled. “I see your conversation skills haven’t improved over the years.”
“I beg your pardon.” Draco drawled, icily.
Harry didn’t know which of those answers would have been accurate. Cedric was a student who should have lived a long, full, and happy life. But instead he died and Harry couldn’t stop it from happening. He wondered again why on earth he was having this conversation.
“I know you are. And I appreciate that, but don’t be. It’s fine. I’m fine. The situation is fine. Everything is fine.”
“Harry, this is Drake” he indicated to Draco and he silently cursed both Jean and Potter.
'No!'
He locked the car, closed the garage door and entered the house. He sat on the floor leaning agaist the door. It's quiet. Very quiet. The quiet was ear-splitting and his head started to ache. He pulled his knees towards him, rested his elbows on his knees ran his fingers in his now short hair. His head ached. The terrible pain was blinding him that he curled on the floor and slept. He slept good long many hours and he did not know how many.
Malfoy smiled. Harry thought it was the most beautiful thing he saw for the night.
Until he came back.
'You gave me all the love and care and family he once gave me!' Potter said after a long kiss.
Now he had to let go. Draco had to let go.  They say he had to let go.
Harry laughed loudly and repeated. 'I don't have any reason! I don't have reason! So that kiss in my office, taking you home, number of orgasms, sleeping with you; all these because I don't have a fucking reason?'
Even his team members got used to it and forgot to stare. Draco was happy that they stopped treating him like a fragile porcelain doll. They were back to normal. Now he's used to his headache and the horrible chill that he simply smoked more and drank more coffee.
On the other hand the world needed a hero. Draco's hero. Draco didn't want to share his Potter. Then again...
Both Ron and Harry heard him say it but gaped at each other for he had said it with much admiration and Hermione chortled to which Ron made a sick face. Harry chuckled.
Perhaps if he had let Draco die in the fire, this would have been easier for Draco.
Day 3 was the beginning of frustration. Having scanned the whole house for a way out Harry realised that he was actually trapped in the very house full of grim memories with a man who is obnoxiously full of himself.
'You don't know muggle cooking!'
But....
He could see Draco Malfoy's grey eyes smiling at him, gazing at him in pure admiration, his hand slipping from his grip dangling over the depthless hollow of unknown world down there.
He caught him halfway down the staircase and pulled him desperately. They kissed without a word, touching,  groping and pulling each other closer. Then Malfoy pushed him agaist the wall slipped his hand in Harry's pants stubbornly and held his cock making a satisfied noice. His smooth long fingers wrapped his cock firmly and started caressing slowly. Harry felt he was growing more in his hand and Malfoy moaned happily.
Malfoy took a moment to look around before entering. He looked at the small yard, the greens, the cherry tree and the black and white house but he didn't say anything. Harry opened the door and let him enter first. He walked in without a word and took a few seconds to drink in the details of the living room then faced Harry with his usual frown.
Then for the first time in his life Harry saw Malfoy yelling crippled with rage.
No! Are you?'
He nods gasping wrapping his cold shivering fingers around his iron wrists his eyes still closed breathing him in.
He actually admired the motorcycles one Sunday morning sitting on the front porch when Draco was cleaning them with an enchanted polishing-cloth.
Later he went to Mrs Weasley with flowers and thanked her for sending food. Sent a box of chocolate to Ginny. Went to Arthur Weasley's office and gave him Potter's ridiculous laptop and taught him how it worked.
It's been three weeks, and Pansy visited twice, his cousins dragged him for dinner or lunch or get-togethers but he always came home before it was late. He would wash himself and sit on the doorstep watching the night sky, smoking, embracing fresh air.
'I don't know!' Malfoy yelled. 'You tell me Potter, you tell me!'
'Told you not to stay up at night you crazy arse, come here!' he pulled him into his arms to check on that, one lovely day when he was sulking infront of the mirror about the lack of beauty sleep.
But Draco was smart enough to know that this was a temporary flame and will be blown off in no time and life will be normal again. Nothing lasts forever. Potter had had more than one affair to his knowledge and Draco knew he had the male attraction in the ministry too. Draco had to keep his distance. He had to stop this.
'The cookbook doesn't say how to eat it.'
'Why should I do that?' Draco shot angrily.
'When did you come here without me?'
It was around 10 o'clock in the night.
'Father!'
Harry let go of Hermione, put his shirt on and walked towards Ron and Malfoy. He hugged Ron and told him to go for Hermione and walked towards Malfoy.
'It's an ancient curse Harry Potter. Even Muggle fairy tails talk about this. Muggles ridicule it to a kiss of a true love but the reality is not a mere kiss.' she said coldly.
'Drey..?'
Late in that night he walks in to the room without knocking. Now Harry, undisturbed by his every ill-manner remains sitting on the edge of the bed having agreed to open up his mind in depth, every memory, every sorrow, torture, hunger, worn out clothes and the cupboard under the stairs.
Every day after work, or after a few of his social events, he would shut himself in his bedroom, sit on the floor, at the foot of the bed dissolving reality in thin air getting lost in the memory of him. Just him. And then he could burn. Burn in the thought of him. To savour every detail of his angry grey eyes, pale skin, blond hair and his annoying voice calling his name. Over and over again. But Harry tried his utmost to forget him. To move on. To get married. To live the life he was supposed to live.
'Scared Malfoy?'
Draco wanted to see what was in it then but couldn't.
Draco greets the elf. Gives three envelopes. 'One to Kingsley, one to Hermione Granger and one to my mother.'
'Why don't you visit your parents?' he suggested avoiding Draco's eyes.
Not just a curse breaker, he was the best curse breaker the Gringotts had. Harry had heard some aurors say that he was even better than Bill Weasley. Everybody knew he was paid well by the goblins and he accepted ancient, complicated curses and curses with a potential high risk wordlessly. He had started his job probably the same time Harry had started his work as an auror in the ministry. Time to time Kingsley invited him to help him with the curses of dark objects ministry had to deal with and Harry knew Draco Malfoy did not charge a Knut for working for Kingsley.
'I said stop calling them that.' Harry stepped towards him slowly with his wand pointing at his heart but Malfoy didn't move.
'You pulled him away did you Harry Potter?' she asked.
One Saturday morning while having breakfat as usual Malfoy read the newspapre aloud while Harry made waffles.
Harry had always wanted to tell this man who is sharing his bed about his disturbing dream but they never talked much. Even after wild, hungry love making time to time happened, specially if they could not make out for a day or two, still they would not speak much. It was as though both of them needed no words.
Harry hid his grimace but for his utmost astonishmet seconds later Narcissa Malfoy's owl flew through the kitchen window and dropped a red envelop.
Malfoy was standing with his usual frown on the face with one hand in his pocket and the other hand clutching his tailored cloak. He had not bothered to button the top most buttons of his pure white slim fit designer shirt after Harry had unbuttoned it. He looked clearly very attractive and a little messy. But George ignored. Harry knew George too well not to be fooled by his mock ignorance. But George didn't mind and seemed very happy to see Draco.
'Goerge should have a cream or something for that or...' he stopped pushing his hair back to kiss his forhead.
Funeral was held just as a British military funeral and Potter received full military honor in spite of the auror funeral honor because the mission was a combined mission. A muggle squadron leader and a pilot also had died in the mission. Mission was in Alaska to rescue passengers from a muggle civil aircraft which had got lost and landed insecurely in the snow. It was suspected that magic was involved in it for the very experienced pilot went a long way off the air route ignoring the ATC. Though the aurors and the muggle military sorted out everything, unexpectedly the aircraft blasted due to a technical malfunction. Though all the victims were rescued Potter and the two muggle officers got caught in the blast.
Draco held his demanding cock again. Potter arched and gave him more space to fuck him gasping for sheer ecstacy. Draco slowly lost his rhythm and started moving  uncontrollably. How much he enjoyed the Gryffindor's sex icon, the chosen one, angry, arrogant, brave brave Harry Potter.
He went to see Pansy Parkinson in her apartment in Chicago and spent a few hours sleeping in her lap letting her stroke his hair.
Finally he came.
Harry took him home without asking. He didn't protest. Harry took him to bed. He didn't protest. They sat on the bed stark naked kissing, his fingers through Harry's hair, tangled, playing with his hair, pulling softly and massaging the scalp with his long soft fingers while kissing his mouth. Harry moaned softly very happily touching and feeling his lush skin. How Harry adored his warm skin agaist his, his hard erection against his, his tongue in his mouth, his fingers in his hair!
Draco tackled him, held him to the bed. 'Oh so many things.'
'Yes I took the chance to drink in your every detail you ugly freak but you broke my nose.'
Now there's no way out of this. It's just one look and two souls in one flesh, not knowing where this was taking them. Waiting to take that one step they had feared to take for ages, his green eyes were blazing, burning like a thousand suns gazing into his silver grey. Harry reached out for his pale hand and placed it on his chest, on his bare skin, and pressed it to his heart with his both hands.
'You performed dark magic out of a Malfoy Grimoir. I have to talk to Kingsley and Mrs Weasley. Ms Granger I consider you as Mrs Weasley's responsibility too, so please remain here all of you till I come.'
There were millions of things to tell him. But he couldn't. Draco didn't know if he could love him enough. He didn't know if he had given him enough. He had always wanted to love him more and more. In every possible way he could. He wanted Potter to know that. He wanted him to know how unbearably he loved him.
Malfoy laughed. His sarcastic voice was carried away very far through the thick air towards the rocks and mountains standing tall like demons and dragons trying to eat them.
Harry stroked his hand gently and woke him up. He woke up with a soft jerk and blinked and squinted at Harry.
He wrapped his hands around him and fell asleep very happily.
'Draco!'
That was all.
Silvia's face darkened and she shushed the girl.
Draco raised his eyes, 'Yesterday?'
'Was that what you were watching in the Slytherins' compartment that day? Malfoy nestled more comfortably on his lap.
'Draco!'
Then he wakes up, walks past him picking his shirt from the bed before he reaches it.
But he doesn't leave, looks all around including the ceiling and tapestries and gaudy curtains Kreacher would not let Harry change.
But tonight he would drift into the memory of every touch and every kiss and every breathing moment passed between them. He would just sit back and live in it. Just for tonight.
Draco felt his hand going through his skin, flesh and touching his heart and trying to make it beat again. 'Draco come on! This is not your time.'
He remembered, like in a dream Kingsley, Mr Weasley and the Head of Auror Office bringing the official message. Draco had accepted it very politely and even offered them coffee. Arthur Weasley Grimaced. Once they had left, The other Weasleys, Ron and Hermione, Pansy and Draco's cousins poured in one after the other without letting him breathe. Then his team members came. He cursed Potter under his breath for dying. Later the neighbours got to know and came one after the other bringing him food. Finally mother and father came with George and helped him clean the place.
The truth was, it was not only Harry. It was there in those angry grey eyes too. And it was there Harry had always seen it in his eyes. He would simply stare at Harry whenever they met, full of hatred. Yet behind that hatered, anger and frustration it was there. It was all over him. It was in his blood. It was glowing on his pale skin. He was burning too... He was burning for Harry more and more. That hunger in his eyes, Harry would feel, going through his ministry robes, through his skin, through his flesh, through his bones to bone marrows and eating him. And Harry knew it was just a matter of one move to claim him. Claim his heart, his soul, his all and own him. Because they both knew where their hearts belonged.
The first day was spent just as anticipated. He was aghast. In spite of detecting the curse said to have disturbed Dudley, he patrolled all over No4, Privet Drive, Surrey criticizing muggle living not alarmed the slightest by the fact that they also are trapped in.
For seven years they woke up in the same bed. They would spend nights in hotels or at Malfoy Manor but they never slept alone.
'OK genius then why didn't we go in the first place?'
'Would you like a cup of coffee at my place or glass of wine or something? Perhaps?' Harry asked carefully.
'You've got to stop this sick habbit. You know every once in a while I get a trying job but that doesn't mean you have to kill yourself like this.'
Malfoy always reported for duty sharp at 10 o'clock at night and Harry would wait with the register open on his table, reading a newspaper or a book. When he walked in Harry would stop reading and listen to his footsteps and inhale his pleasant cologne smell. Malfoy would drop his curse breaking tool kit with a thud and bend to sign the book. Harry didn't know why but he loved that smooth moment when he heard the sound of his breathing in the thick, quiet around them and the sweet smell of his hair.
'What was it about?'
Harry was glad that it ended that way without further ado.
He avoided Harry's gaze and sat on his bed. His eyes were red and swollen. He was dressed carelessly and barefoot.
Kingsley wanted to give him a project in Egypt but he flatly refused saying he had to spend a few days at home.
One by one Draco examined his treasures in the box. A photograph of his parents, a photograph of elated flying baby Harry, a part of a letter written to Sirius, a broken mirror and a knife probably belonged to Sirius. And then in a corner of the box there was it. Draco took it in his hand and rubbed its surface with his thumb.
