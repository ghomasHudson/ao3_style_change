You look down at the ring on your finger, remembering this brilliant year, and those three that had come before. Since that night of his birthday, when you'd gathered your courage, inviting him to dinner...
The elf brings me food three times a day. Our former elf. He gives me nasty looks but doesn't talk. I don't talk either. I'd never been as cruel to house-elves as my Father was, though as far as I recall, neither was I very nice. So I'd better keep my mouth shut. I began to add
"He survived another Avada Kedavra, Draco.” Mother shifts in the armchair. “The Dark Lord killed him, but he didn't die - again - I don't know how could that have happened, but I witnessed it with my own eyes. Mr. Potter came to the Forbidden Forest after the Dark Lord summoned him. He didn't fight, he just stood there and let the Dark Lord kill him. Don't ask me, I don't know how, but the Dark Lord failed. When Mr. Potter fell, he ordered me to check whether he was truly dead."
After dinner, I walk out through the kitchen door to sit on the porch in the backyard. I need fresh air, and now I'd better avoid the living room balcony. Let them fuck on the sofa to their hearts’ content.
“So, here’s the spray.” He turns the tap on and hot water rushes down my shoulders. “Here’s soap and shampoo.” He splutters, pressing my hand into a bar of soap in the metallic crate. “I’ll be right next to you.”
My foot slips, sending me reeling and groping at emptiness for one heart-dropping moment, needles of shock shooting to my fingertips, before his steadying grip is firm around my shoulders.
"Thanks," he said distractedly, focused on pouring and stirring and not paying any attention to me: how I held my breath for a second, how I looked at his eyebrows, drawn in concentration, how I watched the iridescent flicker of the potion, reflecting in his transparent eyes.
"No problem," he said after a brief hesitation and moved close. "Here." He took my hand, guiding it into the crook of his elbow.
"House like," Kreacher confirms. He is dressed in a new starched white linen napkin, and even his ears look starched. "Masters is welcome to dining room."
I shove Goyle off me, pick up my wand and dash along the aisle, but fire and smoke block my way in the middle. I turn back. The fire roars to the left and right. I dash back, only to find Crabbe and Goyle enclosed in a fiery circle. When the fire catches my hair from behind, I realise we are doomed. I scream and beat it out of my hair, dash to the pile of old furniture and begin climbing it.
"I think I'm in love," I finish, as close as I can to what I've been actually intending to say, because one thing and the other for me at this moment don't differ much.
"Master is had his vial today," he croaks, and I can imagine how his droopy face droops even more in disapproval.
Weasley drops the sword on the ground where it clatters with a steel heavy sound and launches, the three of them now intertwined in the embrace.
After the war, during those two years of your house arrest, you’d got interested in art. You’d begun reading books for nothing better to do, and soon discovered that architecture and sculpture drew you the most. So, once you were free to leave the Manor, the first thing you did was visit the National Gallery. There you bumped into Theo, who was no less fascinated than you.
It seems no one knows what actually happened, or Potter's role in it. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. If it were the other way around, no doubt by now the entire school would know that I'd nearly killed their wretched
He stares... but then takes it, giving it a firm squeeze. It's only a brief moment before he lets go, but it's enough to feel that his hand is warm and strong, it's enough for the thought that it feels good to flicker.
He was probably right, for all you knew. But even you weren't that daft not to know that he would never wear this particular shade of jade with a dark green.
"You Father has gone bonkers. He knew instantly when you’d left the place. But he can't track you down here. My home is under Fidelius."
I kick, but Ron drags me up the hill. I've never been a match for him when it came to the physical side of things. I have no choice but to follow.
As soon as we put the protective spells up, he took the locket off and hung it on a rock protruding from the wall, and for an instant it looked as though he had lifted a weight off his shoulders. We didn't talk.
His offer, his words make my heart squeeze, make me ache with a thrill of anticipation and bitterness for something I’ll never have, something that is forever lost for me, something that… I would give anything to have it back.
He wraps his arms around me and strokes my hair and presses gentle lips to my temple. "Draco, my Draco," he repeats, "my..."
Something coils in my stomach. I don't like it. I don't think I want to know what he's about to say next.
The password? Weasley never used a password, at least as far as I was aware of. I adjust the switch carefully back and forth.
When for the first time I realised he was standing by my bed, for one wild moment I thought he came to finish me off. The mere thought was ridiculous. I'd never feared Potter before, and yet... I'd never imagined he was capable of gutting anyone, leaving them to die in a pool of their own blood.
"What do you call it?" I say through my T-shirt over my head. "Dating? Relationship? A boyfriend-girlfriend thing?" I stick my head through the collar and put my arms through the sleeves.
"You are a hell of a kisser, Harry!" The moment is broken, she giggles, and I grin to the sound of my frantic heart.
I'm so fucking angry, I don't know how haven't I killed him yet, or at least haven't broken his nose.
Dumbledore spreads out the Invisibility Cloak and drapes it over me, covering my stiff form from head to toe.
I laugh, and he laughs with me, and we're laughing, only able to stop when the teacher suddenly says over us:
Retrieving the Map from my bag, I spread it over the desk, my eyes searching, searching frantically for the dot
Potter's got to side with me in that regard. I don't mind. He talks to me sometimes and overall doesn't act like I don't exist. When he looks in my direction, he looks
Harry, never taking my eyes off him. McGonagall puts her hand on his shoulder and lets go. Harry runs to the door with Weasley and Granger in tow.  I dash through the crowd after the three of them, when McGonagall suddenly blocks my way.
"Fuck…" He is gathering the vials from the work table, putting them into the wooden box for St. Mungo's. "Then I need you to be able to cast it. For the project."
The procedure repeats, again and again. Now Paul is being punished by his father. His shoulders are hunched, and he tries not to make a sound, but the sight of his crying face makes tears well up in your eyes.
Lathering myself up, my thoughts stray to the kisses: the one that happened...and the one that didn't. I think of kissing him and think of the dream, where I'd taken Parkinson's place. Did we look like that when we were kissing?
"Yeah?" Looking up at me, he raises his eyebrows. He has very intense, expressive eyes. He is adorable.
is filled with our letters with Noir, laid out scrupulously, according to the dates. My letter-his reply-my letter-his reply. For the whole of Wizarding Britain to digest with their morning tea.
"Oi, Malfoy! Nice to see you!" Ron says when we head down the corridor. "Here he is!" He releases my hand, suddenly shoving me in the back so that I stumble forward and catch myself against the door.
A rustle behind me makes me jump; startled, I turn. Potter. He stuffs something in his pocket. I spring on my feet with my wand drawn. He steps forward and draws his. Slowly, we circle each other, the bench between us.
"No, listen..." I try to shake him to his senses. "If you stay here, you are doomed. Leave Hogwarts and hide and-"
The door opened, letting Draco in. He'd changed into black jeans and a high neck woollen sweater. Frowning, he looked between us, as though expecting us to get at each other's throat. We still might.
"If he intended to kill you..." I rummage frantically through the heap of things, my fingers brush the locket, I snatch my hand away. "You would already be dead." I say it as confidently as I can. I want to believe it. Though it only takes remembering the monstrous snake to realise how feeble a hope it is. "You said you had a bezoar,
I don't know why, but I enjoy the thought of him seeing me kissing the girls. I want to talk about it, I want to rub it in his face. I want to let him know that his stupid peck did absolutely nothing to me. That I didn’t notice it, really.
"But what does the sign mean?" Granger asks. "The Deathly Hallows are not mentioned anywhere in the book."
"Goyle!" I shout, and he turns, right at the moment when Harry opens the door to the Room of Requirement.
“It was in the room.” His voice approaches. “Do you like it?” He says above me, and I feel as the tip of his shoe touches the sole of my socked foot.
Nott whistles; Zabini stands up, walking around the desk and towards Ginny in a slow, deliberate gait. As soon as he approaches with his hands on his hips, Ginny punches him in the face, hard.
As though having heard my prayers, Potter appears on the porch. I cry out in relief, ready to dash there and throw the door open and drag him inside.
I finish my sandwich and sit alone, staring into the fire, until my mind begins to drift and I struggle to keep my eyes open. I sit, half-drowsing, half-thinking, the flames of the fire mingling with images before my eyes.
"Remember you said in the letter, there was something that could have pointed at me?" I asked, my fingertips drawing circles in his hair. My neck was craned, and there was no room enough for two, but I'd never felt better in my life. "Some detail, what was it?"
A sound from the alcove makes me turn. I see the lid of the piano opens slowly to rest against the side of the instrument.
I closed my eyes, remembering our first time so vividly in that very room: I apparated us from the middle of the dance floor, right onto my bed. You called me a show-off, already ripping my shirt away. I didn't argue. I wrenched at your belt, making you topple over, vanishing our clothes.
"Unlike you, not because I was a better person." I shrug. "I never needed to. My family was disgustingly rich, and I had literally anything I wanted. There was no need to steal; all I had to do was ask my parents. So I really have no idea
Malfoy doesn't stop me when I walk out of the library door, neither do I hear his footsteps behind as I descend the staircase, nor does he follow me out of the castle. At least, as far as I'm aware of. Oddly enough, I find my way onto the grounds easier than I expected. Slowly, with my hand outstretched, I walk down the hill, in the direction of the Lake, as far as I remember it. I'm not afraid to get lost, not really. I can summon Kreacher any moment. And it's Hogwarts grounds, for fuck's sake. What can possibly happen to me here, worse than already had?
That night after the club, lying alone in my bed, I knew this time you wouldn't. I knew I would never see you again.
to those black shiny brogues, one of which is tapping the floor to the beat of the music...  My eyes go back up, stumbling over that belt buckle (seriously, fuck that thing - the silvery-dull metallic sheen against the black...)
that paralyses me with fear. He probably wanted to comfort me, to hug me, or something. I feel sick all the same. I cannot help it.
Laughter crinkled in the corners, ready to be unleashed. You never smiled like that. Only then did I realise that his clear eyes were nothing like yours. Bright blue, where yours were quicksilver, his open steady gaze so unlike your liquid, evasive one.
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" I suddenly realise I'm hard, and he no doubt sees my morning wood obscenely tenting my pants forward.
"Watch it!" He snaps, his breath sudden on my cheek. "You could've broken your neck." His arms around me are suddenly gone, and his hand grips me firmly above the elbow. He briefly bends down and straightens up again. "I've got your bag. Come on."
"This is crazy, mate," Ron had said after the whole business on the pitch. "I still can't believe it."
And I am crying, and Hermione's crying and even Ron sniffs. His eyes guarded, Draco looks between the three of us. I pull him close, wrapping my arm around his waist.
"Draco," Mother says to my left. I turn my head. The movement doesn't hurt at all. "How do you feel?"
I sit, listening to the buzz of voices, to shuffling of feet, to people brushing past my desk on their way to their seats. I’m not afraid of getting in the way at Ron and Hermione’s desk. I just hope that
She clings to him, whispering something in his ear, leaning in so close that her moving lips almost brush his neck. A small smile plays at the corner of his mouth, of his
I wasn’t surprised and didn’t question it. I just grabbed for him and held on for dear life. He made me warm again; he made the cold ebb away and turned the darkness safe and intimate.
My poor heart pounding, I lay still in my bunk, staring at Harry's back by the tent's open flap. I see as Granger across from him shakes her head and leans into Weasley. Weasley shrugs and says no more. The three of them sit by the fire well into the night.
There's something… I squint and step forward - my reflection moves towards me. Tongues of fire are sprouting from my bare chest, fraying the white edges of my open shirt into smouldering brown.
"And there were no particular reason, no business to seek you out," he continues, looking at the river, "but then I thought... maybe it's okay - to call without any reason? To come and see you, just because I wanted to - maybe it would be just fine?"
I've fallen in love with someone, whom I've never even seen; someone who, having found out who I am, doesn't want anything to do with me.
I will touch a key on the piano, pressing it gently with a lonely sound. And another one. It will feel as though the air shifts, the house around me giving a sigh - of tenderness and longing. I will press another key, listening to the lonely note ringing high in my empty heart - a reminder that
Not asking this time, he wraps his hand around my nape, kissing me. Insistent and forward, his tongue doing
The mob parts and a figure steps forward. Clad in black, it looks like any other, it could be anyone, any of them. But no, it's not anyone, not just
He joined the group only a few days ago. A small mousy man, late thirties. Itchy and nervous, brown hair, dull features. You wouldn't recognise him on the street.
Potter snorts and draws a deep breath and exhales, long and slow. "Would you sit down? We really need to talk."
The link between the two connects the one to the other." Malfoy stares down at his hands, spreading out the duvet on his lap.
She throws her head back, her laughing face framed with vivid fiery hair. I bend and kiss her, pressing my lips to her neck, her chin, her nose - wherever I can reach. I love her so much in this moment. The moment of the warmest familiarity, acknowledgment and belonging, erasing everything except our joy from the back of my mind. I wish time would stop; I wish this moment would last for an eternity, suspended in our bright bubble, forever happy.
fHis quick footsteps crunch around me. Tugging my gloves off, I quickly make a snowball and hurl it where I think he stands.
Afternoon light will make my eyes water after the dark hallway. Dust will swirl in the air over the piano as I open the lid. Silently sliding my fingertips over the keys, I won't be able to hold the memories back.
You are probably doing that on purpose. Trust you to do just that - shine right in my eyes to conceal yourself from me. To hide in plain sight and never let me
I don't care, they are just words. I don't care. Those who shout mean nothing to me. Nothing. They thought I was on their side, they were mistaken. I never cared for their side. For any side. I was on
I didn't want to make a scene. Fuck, I was already making it. Stepping forward, I grabbed your sleeve. "Come on."
"I'm not talking about today, Ron... though that, too. He healed me after Nagini bit me in Bathilda Bagshot's house."
"You know what I mean," he whispered, "not that I care, but keep doing that and you risk turning into a vegetable, mind that you're already halfway to that state."
[12] – Voldemort’s speech – his voice – whispering in everyone’s head, from the film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Part 2.
"Harry Potter is dead." The Dark Lord smiles. "From this day forth, you put your faith in me. Harry Potter is dead!"
His folded jeans on the shelf, the neat stack of pale jumpers, the black cashmere turtleneck—out, out, out! Reaching with your foot into the depth of the wardrobe, you sent the pair of black shiny brogues to the floor. Like dead fish, they landed with a thump, their soles ungracefully showing their perfectly clean underbellies. His Chelsea boots—out. You bent down to pick one up, your impotent rage reaching its crescendo as you hurled it into the opposite wall and finally stopped, your breath coming out in hard, shaky gasps. Clenching your jaw, you looked around, all the while aware of the tear that finally escaped the corner of your eye to roll down your cheek. Your hand jerked up to wipe it away.
"No, I mean..." He winces and glances at the ugly blackened crown in his hand. "I can't leave all those people; the whole of Hogwarts is fighting Death Eaters. I won't leave, and neither will Ron and Hermione."
I look like shit in the bathroom mirror. In a need of a shower and a change of clothes, which I don't have here with me.
sort of thing. There are things I've never told them, things I cannot imagine us discussing. Things I tell Noir.
I kiss his nape and between his shoulder blades; I slide lower, pressing my lips down his spine, down to his lower back and all the way up again. He turns his head and reaches out to pull me into a kiss. My cock drags along the cleft of his arse; a gasp escapes me.
"I don't know," he says, "I don't have one." When I ask him about his Patronus. "I never succeed. Not that I tried too hard."
I fall on my knees... It finally dawns on me that I can't help him, because I am dying, too. Because Draco is dying, because I failed to protect him. I failed.
Weasley protested when Potter gave me the Cloak. Potter said, in that case, he could go on his own. Granger said that no way Potter was going. Potter offered her to take the Cloak and go by herself. She said she was uncomfortable with stealing food. Weasley wouldn't go because of his wound. So it came to me again.
"About a boy who was a jerk, the one you hated as a kid," he said, the low rumble of his voice vibrating against my chest, "you repeatedly said there were someone whom you disliked before, but then started to get along with." He tilted his head up to look at me. "It sounded all too familiar, I should’ve guessed. But you
It requires all I have, everything I can give, all my energy, strength and power - this is what it takes, and yet… It is giving more than it's taking, lifting me up,
"It was most stupid of you indeed, Malfoy," Pomfrey snaps, "it has dislodged your broken ribs in the process. Lie still, don’t move."
He is not stronger than I. All I have to do is push him harder, throw him off and grab my wand from the coffee table to cast
It should be awkward, but it's not. Not at all, I've long since ceased caring. After everything that has happened, I couldn't care less.
"Skipping classes, Potter?" He smirks, and I am already reconsidering. I'm in a foul mood, having just fucked up with Gin like an idiot.
I don't know how long it takes, probably just a few seconds, but for me the moment is dragging, making me uncomfortable. I don't know how to behave around Malfoy. He still annoys me to no end, but what had once been is no longer there. Our ire burned out, our vitriol faded. We've both been through too much to still commit to the childish rivalry.
"It can't wait." He lifts his head. "It will be ready tomorrow. If we don't try it out in 72 hours, it will be wasted."
When later in the Common Room, I come up to Hermione and tell her I'm able to see her, I hear tears in her voice. From then on, she and Ron cease to be hostile towards Malfoy.
"Yes! Here's your head." I reach out and touch the side of his face. "Your shoulders." I place my palm on his shoulder and confidently move around him. I don't have to guess now. "Your back!" I clasp him on the back.
Mr. Vice - your main coach and therapist - has a fascinating name indeed, considering what he is preaching. He’s in charge here.
Cupping his face, I kiss him again, and again, drinking in his every breath. His eyes are closed, he is barely breathing, his lips don't move, I want him to kiss me back.
Putting the book on its shelf, my hands are shaking. I feel my life - my entire self - being someone's disgusting joke.
I push him on his back and lean down. He stares up at me, his chest rising and falling under my palm. My hair falls in his face, and he reaches up to weave his fingers through it, pulling me down and finding my lips again. I slip my hands under his sweater and up his sides until I reach his armpits and pull the sweater over his head.
He clears his throat in silence and slowly gets off me. Trust him to read my thoughts and do the opposite.
He tells them everything from the night in the hospital he came to apologise. I watch Granger's and Weasel's faces rather than listen... until he comes to the part of his conversation with Dumbledore after I left.
Slender shoulders folding in defeat, her rigid form curled in on itself as your palm splayed over the plane of her back, pressing her firmly into your body.
at the wand-point; my bed is a barrier between us. He's in the white bathrobe, but it's secured at the waist with a belt. He is blinking at me, bewildered. His hair, wet from the shower, is combed back. It's only Potter. I lower my wand.
"No, Drake, I don't think you are telling the whole truth." He shook his head. "Have you searched through your heart thoroughly?"
forget it, Harry!" I feel the sofa dipping beside me as she springs to her feet. "You don't let me! How many times have you said you don't want to be treated any differently? But you won't let us!"
I see the Unbreakable Vow, him hand-bound to Narcissa with the red string, Bella performing the ritual.
"So… after the trials, mother and I returned home. We were put under house arrest. Mother, until all the reparations were paid from our fortune to the victims of war; and I - until the start of the term at Hogwarts. Eighth Year at Hogwarts was a part of the probation. I wasn't allowed to leave the Manor grounds for the entire summer. Not like I particularly wanted to.
When I finally come to my senses, Weasley is sitting beside Granger, leaning his head against the wall; he watches me and says nothing. His eyes are dead. He looks like the one who has shed all his tears. But I am not nearly done.
“Not in the same way… I don’t think… I didn’t think - until very recently.” He moves to stand before me.
but... Better she'd left her palm on my chest, safer. But safety is not her goal; she is all fire and danger.
"Isn't that what you want Weasley, me to fuck off?" I added. "Anyway, where the hell would I go?" That was the end of it.
"I know this house," you said, as soon as we emerged into the hall through the kitchen staircase from the basement.
It's some wicked mistake, this can't be true. Dumbledore can't die, he couldn't. He wasn't supposed to die after I told him everything. My plan should have worked out, except he wasn't supposed to die. So he told me.
The stand below cracks and falls. The diadem melts before our eyes, turning liquid, getting consumed by flames. A terrible scream, a wail of pain and agony fills the room until the thing dissolves without a trace and disappears.
I eyed students over the top of the cauldron. No one looked suspicious. Malfoy at the far end of the classroom was having a fit or something. He was cutting, stirring, pouring, making notes, reading instructions from the textbook hovering in the air in front of him, and talking to Parkinson - all at the same time. He looked like he was having an epiphany about the potion-making, transmitting it to life.
"Draco!" Father says. "Draco." [18] He beckons to me, and I want to step back and blend into the crowd, but people part before me, recoil as if burnt, and here I stand - alone - before my Father and the Dark Lord.
I follow his movements around the field. The Bludger is deflected by Goyle, and Nott, now out of danger, dives directly onto Seamus below, snatching the Quaffle out of his hand.
"No problem." I feel strangely hollow. "We'll try again. There's plenty of time before June. Don't worry, surely we'll figure something out, you'll pass your NEWTs."
"I told you everything Dumbledore told me!" Potter raised his voice. "And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a horc-"
Hermione," Weasley pokes her in the ribs, and she tries to shove him in the chest, but he catches her hand and pulls her to him and hugs her, planting a kiss at the top of her head. Granger presses her cheek to his chest and says no more.
me where Harry is. "Surely he hasn't gone to give himself up... It would be madness!" I explain to her, it's essential that she understands. I must convince her that it's utter madness, and wouldn't happen, and Harry would never...
for it. I open my mouth, letting her greedy tongue in, her hand squeezes my arse when she catches my lower lip between her teeth and
He takes my glasses off, placing them carefully on the coffee table. His face blurs. Good. I help him tug my trousers down and roll over. I don't want to see his face. There's a
"Mr. Potter testified that my help played the most crucial part in the defeat of the Dark Lord, and even talked to all those politicians. They left me alone. There'll be a trial, of course, but at least they will allow me to wait for it as I please, and not in Azkaban."
"What are you doing?" Potter runs to kneel by Weasley's side and uncorks the vial. His hands are shaking.
I'm not fine, I'm shaking, and the dream's paralysing images are still vivid before my eyes. It was I - instead of Chris and Paul - in the circle, and my Father was beating the gay out of me with his cane in front of the cheering crowd.
I don’t want Astoria’s orange, but open my hand to him all the same - out of spite. Half of the fruit nestles into my palm. He has divided it into slices.
I don't mention Astoria, he doesn't talk about her either. I have no idea what's there between them, is there anything at all? He spends most of his time in my company, and that should be enough for me, I decide.
"Meet you in a half an hour?" I said on the landing, throwing my rumpled jacket over my shoulder. "I'll come to fetch you. For breakfast."
- derives from the Latin words "harmonia" - "harmony", "nectere" - "to tie, bind," and "passus" - "step, pace.” The spell that Draco Malfoy used to mend the broken Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement and make it work again in “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” by J.K. Rowling.
I carry the box with me everywhere, shrunk in my pocket. Checking when no one's watching every now and then. It is so much easier without owls, it is so much more discreet. I can't imagine how one is able to create such a brilliant thing. He must be very smart, another
Pressing the photographs to my burning chest, I wrap my shirt around me and hold tight. Maybe it will burn your smile away.
"Of course we can," I reply, "otherwise we'll starve and die; and Potter’s got the world to save, remember?"
Gin leans in to kiss me, trailing her palm up and down my stomach until she brushes against my dick, making me jerk.
"After New Year. I'm joining them after New Year," she says, and I nod and smile back, aware of Malfoy at the edge of my vision.
"Tomorrow morning we’re planning to go somewhere, do things," I say, and I know what his reaction will be. Though he tries not to show it, I know he's afraid to be left behind. "If everything goes as planned, we'll be back by lunchtime."
"Thank you, Dobby." I press the handle when a sudden thought strikes me. Dobby is a free elf, after all, and can do as he pleases, so nothing really prevents him from...
"What happened... before the Great Hall?” I ask. I must know. “Before Hagrid brought him in? I mean... the Dar-... the Dark Lord thought Harry was dead."
"Sit down, Master." He dragged me along until my knees touched something soft and firm, and I realised it must have been the sofa. He had Apparated me to the living room.
"Penelope Clearwater," Granger replies so naturally that if I hadn't known otherwise, I'd believe her.
I do the same. The fiery liquid burns its path down my throat and spreads in my chest. I hear Granger coughing and press my palm to my mouth to wait the burn out. When I look up at Potter, he is staring down into his empty glass. As though feeling my gaze, he looks up and our eyes meet.
Aunt Bella shouts. But it's too late. Avery touches the Mark on his forearm. Everyone draws their breath.
- when Noir is about to be here any second; when, seeing me talking to someone here, he certainly won't approach.
"Well… I don't know, maybe trying to get your attention?" I grinned. "To compete with some stupid piece of paper?" I kicked the book pettily with my foot, sending it under the coffee table.
“And I can understand why some people are absent, why some students decided not to come this year… or couldn’t bring themselves to return to Hogwarts after everything they have been through.”
He is careful and mostly silent around me in classes. He still walks me to meals and back. We still work together on a Patronus.
I hear Potter moving around his room, the floorboards creaking under his footsteps, until the noise dies down, and the room goes silent. I come close to his door, leaning my forehead against it. I don't know for how long I stand like this, but when I finally bring myself to press the handle and enter, the room is dark.
The three of them exchange glances, and I know there's more to it than I'm aware of. Whatever it is, they are not about to tell me.
No. I must erase anything, any trace or reminder of that traitorous flutter in my chest that used to come in disguise of a friend and stay to torture me.
Harry died and everything died with him. I died. The world ended, how dare you say it doesn't matter?!
"Good morning, Master Malfoy," Kreacher says, turning to me from the stove. He is standing on a high wooden stool, clad in a black apron over his faded pillowcase. "Breakfast is been ready."
and..." He shakes his head, his voice barely a whisper. "Led them here. He told me, he'd be waiting at the top of the Astronomy Tower, so we... went right there. And there he was - alone. I thought he'd call the Aurors. Nothing went as planned." Malfoy covers his eyes. "He talked wrong, and never tried to fight, and there was Aunt Bella... I didn't know what to do. Then he knocked me out with a spell, and..." He shrugs.
"Do you like it?" I ask, gingerly touching the tiny unruly ponytail he's tied in my hair with a hairband he transfigured from the grass stem.
“Keep your voice down,” Seamus whispers. “Nothing that’s stronger than Butterbeer is allowed. Firewhisky?”
Granger puts her book down and stands up. When she approaches him, he hands her the snitch and she looks at it closely, turning it in her fingers this way and that. They sit with their heads close, murmuring in low voices for a long time. Weasley eventually joins them and looms over with his arms crossed, concealing the two of them from my sight.
"The necklace… the one that guy was buying." You tugged at your collar, your face hot. "It's beautiful. I'm sure they've got a double in the shop."
Mother told me before my departure that the Dark Lord summoned Snape and punished him for the lie about breaking the Unbreakable Vow. Snape begged him to forgive his mistake and arrogance, he said he thought he did break it when I seemingly died and he didn't. The Dark Lord believed him... but Crucioed him anyway.
"Leave me alone, let me fucking breathe!" You would shout, your face livid in the street lights behind the club. That would be the last I saw of you.
"Masters may proceed to the living room," Kreacher says after a while, "Master Black play music if he want, and Master is listen. Kreacher is not disturb Masters."
I gather myself. "Unfortunately, they kept me ignorant, My Lord. They held me in the cellar all the time. Having been forced into hiding in the woods, they dragged me along, but they kept me restrained and never discussed anything in my presence."
He pours and I stir, and then he's telling me he's going to add the mix into the cauldron, close the lid and let it simmer, and the potion will be done.
"No, it's fine." You threw my hand off. "Sorry, guys, we need to sort something out. Be back in a minute."
The world around me snaps into focus, making my perception vivid and sharp. Bewildered, I feel every brush of air against my skin, colours around me suddenly brighten. Something is clearing in my head, as though a veil that has been dulling all my senses is being pulled off, making me alive again.
I don't understand what's happening. Who is that?! How did they find us?! The flap of the tent opens.
In vain he frets; he can't wake me. I'm not asleep to begin with. I'm not going to open my eyes either. I want him to leave, and now he's going to, as he always does. I know it's not his first visit here. It's not even the second. It's the fourth.
My breath catching in my throat, at first I will think it's the house, playing tricks with me. But then you will step inside, quietly closing the door behind you.
the actual name of the gay-conversion therapy institution, which operated in the USA, and where Jared (the protagonist of the film ‘Boy Erased’), and Garrard Conley (the author of the novel ‘Boy Erased: A Memoir’, based on the real life events) had been sent to by their religious parents.
You were close enough to see the gold specks in her deep green irises. Black silky eyebrows distorted their perfect shape on her crumpling face. In the attempt to bring her breath under control, she covered her eyes, refusing to break down. But the quivering line of her lips betrayed her. “I’m sorry.”
When did he last visit his mother? You couldn't name the day, but it surely couldn’t have been longer than a week. Feeling like a thief, you carefully folded the letter and slipped it back into its envelope, sealing it neatly with your wand and placing it back on the table where Narcissa's owl dropped it this morning, barely a minute after he left.
I don't see the woman, but no doubt she is here. I can see nothing but Dumbledore against the railings right in front of me. All I can do is stare ahead.
"Merlin, that's great!" Used only to blackness before my eyes, I was shaken, thrilled, exhilarated to be able to finally
A kick in the gut from inside sends me on my all fours as I vomit my breakfast onto the grass. Shaking, I spit on the ground, wipe my mouth with the back of my hand and rise on unsteady feet. I realise I'm still clutching my wand in my hand and the coin in the other.
"You are too much, Potter," you would tell me. "Giving too much, demanding too much." You would brush my hair off my forehead. "I don't think I'm enough for you, or will ever be."
Feeling nothing, I glance down, see nothing and look up into the mirror again, bringing my hand to my flaming chest. Fire springs from my fingertips, sending sparks into my glasses. I flinch and stagger backwards, my feet setting the rug aflame.
“Your Patronus is a Dragon,” he whispers later - much, much later - when we are both breathless, trembling, wild, when we can no longer stand it.
If that won’t help, then I don’t know what might. Entering the Great Hall this morning, I overheard a Gryffindor girl whispering to another: “Today’s password is Fawkes.” That could mean anything, really.
After that I don't remember much. Seems like we'd been outside, ‘getting some air’ for me, but I'm not sure.
I head over to pick up the locket where I hang it last night and stop dead: the locket is not there. My heart gives a jolt, and I dash outside to find Malfoy. With his back to me, he is sitting cross-legged on the ground. His hair has grown long; soft curls fall on his neck but do not yet reach his shoulders. Sunlight gleams golden in the wavy strands, I've never noticed it before.
She's very nice, and you like her a lot; as a friend. Why is it necessary to fake this attraction of a different kind between woman and man? The one that will never be there. But you know that she's trying hard, too, and you want to help her.
I'm so fed up with everyone dancing on eggshells around me, and with my friends most of all. It's as though they’re not them anymore. As though I’m not
"Let me." I propped myself on my elbow. I took his cock and began to stroke it, and in no time it was stiff again. Astonished, I felt myself harden inside him. Carefully, I moved my hips. Slowly, as slow as I could. "May I?"
I only manage to reply: "Yes, thank you, yes, thank you, yes, thank you," under Potter's heavy stare.
I turn around and start walking. By now, I manage without my hands in front of me. I'm able to sense when there's anything in my way and stop before bumping into it. There's nothing and no one there as I walk through the open double door of the Great Hall.
I lie back down on the sofa and close my eyes, beginning to drift, when the door bangs. Mrs. Black's portrait shrieks and I hear the
I am standing by the wall with a glass in my hand, observing the couples whirling on the dance floor. Music is loud, gowns are dizzying. I am dressed up and on tenterhooks.
I have to do something, but I don't know what or how. Did he even read my apology, or did he destroy it not bothering to take a look?
I wasn't sure if I was supposed to kiss him. I mean, I wanted to, but maybe it would've been over the top?
As though nothing had happened, as though we didn't fight, as though you didn't bang the door, as though I wasn't mad at you. Laughing at the arm of a tall stranger. I was halfway across the club before I knew it.
"Then friends probably told you, that we were stuck under the enchanted Mistletoe." He approaches. "There was no other way of getting out."
“Watch where you’re going.” His voice is sharp, but his hands are careful as he steadies me by the shoulders.
Because those are just words and I think he already knows. This is not the time and place. They are just words, they don’t change anything, and they can wait until we're alone.
do magic, mate," Ron says quietly by my side. "You don't have to be able to see to do it… you just don't want to, you don't give yourself a chance. You've been through a lot, Harry, and it's okay--" He squeezes my thigh reassuringly.
"Well, considering it's Gryffindor's birthplace... maybe there's something there. Maybe you are right. It would be symbolic."
"I don't care, Mum. He may kill me, but now I don't care. Now that..." I shake my head. "He may as well do it sooner."
He pulls back and takes his glasses off, putting them carefully down on the floor, then cups my face and kisses me.
"So." I tear a piece of paper out of Granger's notepad and take the pencil. The three of them stare at me. "Here it is."
The worst thing, the thing that kills me, that makes me feel as though something has been ripped out and stolen when Noir had turned out to be a joke - is that I was mistaken about Malfoy. All this time, while I was growing fond of him, he'd been carrying out his disgusting plan, scheming another blow. All this time, while I was falling in love with Noir.
I pounce forward and shove Harry aside with all my might, away from the line of Weasley's sword. Harry stumbles and falls, while the sword hits the frozen rocky ground with a loud metallic
"Okay." Malfoy clears his throat and moves closer. "Hold this." To my astonishment, he takes my hand, turning it up, and a small round bowl nestles into my palm.
So Kreacher apparated me out of Hogwarts and brought me here. Potter hasn’t visited ever since. My only company in this creepy old place is the creepy old elf. The house drives me mad. Huge, ugly and dingy - scary. I chose the living room's sofa as my sleeping place. I don't care for the upper floors, for the grand staircase with the house-elves' heads on pikes along its walls.
The game is to begin in about ten minutes, but the teams already take their positions, listening to the last instructions from Madame Hooch.
Oddly enough, I'm used to it by now - to him touching my hand. I don't really mind. It's been almost a month. We are paired up for Potions, but in most of the other classes he sits with me in the back anyway. At first, it felt weird; now, it's a routine; and even Ron and Hermione ceased fretting, ceased asking if I'm alright.
"I wanted to… express my gratitude for your testimony at my trials. And to thank you for saving my mother."
Malfoy's getting his own version of events, too. We ignore each other completely, behaving as though the other doesn't exist, but it doesn't matter.
He spends time with Astoria now, not every day, but still often. Too often for my liking. When he offers to let me join them on their walk to Hogsmead, I refuse, shutting myself in my room. We planned this weekend together a while ago - to go shopping for Christmas presents. Maybe shopping is too strong a word, he said, he only needed one present for his mother. Now, it's Astoria who is helping him choose it, at this very moment, when I sit in my room, torn between the urge to break down in tears and kick something. Or
"I want to. To thank you. For everything you are doing. I've never said that, and I think I should." Not looking at me, you gather water in your palm, making it flow through your fingers.
"Just ask her the fuck out, admit you wanna date her! Why are you playing hard to get?!" I realise I'm shouting.
“Fuck, sorry.” I tug at his arm. “I’m an idiot, I didn’t mean to.” We start walking. “Though you know,” I add. “I’d really like to see it.”
He beats me to the Snitch twice, and for the third time I am determined. We dive towards the ground in the double arc, our shoulders almost touching, arms outstretched in pursuit of the deceptive flash of light. The earth is approaching, but neither of us is losing his nerve.
My hand will clench into a fist, crumbling the dust of those glimpses into nothing. I will take a breath... let it out and open my palm, allowing everything to dissolve without a trace in the music-lit air.
Ginny strides into the Common Room. She crosses the room to the group of desks where Slytherins are sitting, and her manner - the vicious way she walks - tells me that something's about to happen.
I have no idea where Harry is now, McGonagall saw that I'd lose track of where he was going. The three of them ran up the main staircase, they may be anywhere in the castle by now.
His hands clasped behind his back, Severus looks straight ahead, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. Everyone is cheering, beaming at him. Everyone but Bellatrix. Her head bowed, she is standing motionless with her hands at her sides.
The information board in our Common Room never catches my attention. Why would it? Especially when I'm dashing down the stairs, almost being late for breakfast.
Suddenly hot all over, I nod and tug my undershirt off. There’s not much to say, really. We’re going to wash. Together. With Malfoy. That’s all. No big deal. I’m not cold anymore, not nearly, and it seems like I’m shaking because of the entirely new reason. I’m not going to tell him. There’s nothing to tell, I haven’t even told it to myself. My boots are off, my joggers, I proceed undressing, until only my boxers are left on.
Then there's this Keeper guy William Vyse. Who is handsome in his own way, but he’s not my type. Though I don't know what my type might be, I don't think I have a type - but I can tell, Vyse is
I see Zabini, pulling Malfoy away with his arm over his shoulder. Malfoy throws his arm off, speeding up until he breaks into the run, disappearing around the stands.
I shrug. "It wasn't working." Which is true. It wasn't. Though the entire bewildering thing in detail no one will ever hear from me.
Dancing is strongly encouraged here for your 'healing process.’ Waltz and Foxtrot. Nothing indecent. No Tango,
He may think that his hint had helped me to figure him out. He may think that now, once I know who he is, I don't want anything to do with him. He surely thinks that he was right, that once I knew, I'd end everything between us, just what he told me he was afraid of. And I've done exactly that.
"Who the hell does Robards think he is?" Your arm would snake around my lower back, pulling me close.
He must be there, among the people, he must be warning them about the Death Eaters’ attack. There - in the middle of the crowd - I'll find him. He is telling students not to be afraid, he is giving orders - to McGonnagal and Flitwick and Snape.
He is staring at me, his pupils blown wide. He'll probably kill me. There's no other way to do it; no other way to make him
She resumes scribbling in her essay, and I look for a while at the neat rows of equations appearing from beneath the quill.
Tucking a cushion under his neck, he smiles. The light is dim in the room, and I can't see his face clearly.
In my Muggle suit, I stand out here. Pretty much everyone is in robes, except for Potter in his Auror uniform jacket and trousers.
"Anything," he whispers, "whatever you want." He clasps his hands behind his back. "You may tie my hands."
I realise there's no plan, Potter acted on impulse, all this was only his stupid idea, and Dumbledore is none the wiser.
"You don't need it here, Mr. Malfoy, you shouldn't waste your energy until you are healed. Whatever magic you need, you may ask me."
You refused to remember his amused drawl, the quiet fondness in his eyes across the kitchen table when he was saying that.
I watch him sitting by the fire with his back to the cave. I wish I could see his face, I wish I could know what he is thinking. He didn't wear the locket today. If it was only the locket last night... then that's what it was.
No one would judge me now if I broke down and wept in front of them all. They would think my tears were for Dumbledore. But no. Since that dreadful night, I don't have any tears left for him. I shed them all.
I throw glances at people's essays, at the notes they scribble, at the marks on the margins in their Potions textbooks.
My eyes are travelling down Malfoy's lean frame, lingering on the black leather belt circling his waist…
You shrugged and looked down at me… the brooding longing in my veins turned into joy. If you wanted to leave, you would have already done so.
"But, the ungrateful sinner I am," he continues, and his head snaps up to look directly at you, "I find myself constantly thinking about men."
"Come in," he repeats, sitting up in the bed. It's not as dark as it has seemed to me at first. The soft glow of the streetlamps is streaming from the window.
He grips his cock and strokes it, and… "AHHH!" And finally comes over my stomach; I stare as the swollen head moves in and out of his fist.
He stands up. "Good. See you." He nods and stuffs his hands in his pockets. "Eight o'clock." He begins walking away along the pavement.
You didn't know what made you pause, but your hand was already reaching for his jacket. The dark green one. The one he was wearing yesterday for the meeting with his mother.
The alarm goes off in the air, making me swear and jump. It's seven in the morning. Fuck, it's morning.
The next three days you left your bed only to brush your teeth until you were spitting blood into the sink and to stand unmoving under the scalding shower.
At a loss, I dropped into my desk, my mind racing... When Zabini approached and flopped the folder in front of me.
“Thanks.” I smooth my hair back under the spray and find the soap. “That’s much better. It was freezing up there.” I run the soap over my chest.
how fucked up it was, until I’d visited your facility... So I thought... that probably it would be better to remove your bracelet first..."
Malfoy shrugs. I look at his forearm, now mended, at the Mark that snakes down, not quite reaching his wrist. He probably catches me staring, because he grabs his sweater from the bedside table and covers his upper body, tucking his arms underneath.
I look down to where we are both hard. I don't know where this is going, or how it may end up, but my body's impatient to find out. I step closer, erasing all the remaining space between us.
Harry is asleep next to me, his quiet breathing steady. I watch his face. It's smooth and calm. Asleep. I want to plant a kiss on his brow,
Tightening your arms, you rocked her on the spot, all the while aware how fragile yet unyielding she felt. Narcissa's face surfaced in your memory. The arrogant turn of the head, a slight incline just so; her steady gaze, the proud chin, elegance ingrained in every move. They were very alike, you thought. Strength under the glamour of serenity. She hated this weakness, you could tell, and all the more so in front of you. Your shirt under her face had become wet. Somehow her tears were calming, keeping your own storm at bay.
Although I see what I see, at first I don't comprehend, staring dumbly at the white note. It's only when all the blood rushes to my face, I realise my hands are trembling.
I feel lazy and warm, and not hungry for the first time in ages. I watch Weasley's grinning face, and Granger leaning against him by the fire. I think that they are not that bad, and maybe we can sort things out a bit and not return to our usual hostility. Potter next to me smiles to himself, and when he looks up from the fire and our eyes meet - his gaze welcomes me, makes me feel as though I belong, as though now I am one of them. I smile back.
"I told you, I won't talk about it, Mother." You tried to turn to your other side, but she gripped your shoulder.
I rip the picture in two and stare into the fire between my hands, where the photo-you and the photo-me are nestled so far from each other.
[4] – dialogue between Harry and Hermione in the tent, from the film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Part 1.
We are in the Ministry Atrium. Mother is gripping my hand, and the flashes of the cameras, as though in a slow motion, are making everything look black and white and surreal.
It was as good as it could be, with Molly fussing around me and all, with Gin home from her training. She said she cut her hair. When I reached with my hands to touch it, I found it was no longer than mine now, short silky strands between my fingers feeling as though I was stroking a furry cat. I laughed at that and told her so.
You shrugged your Mother's hand off and turned your back to her. Your throat was squeezing, you blinked the tears away.
I can't discern the details at all or tell the colour of his clothes, but his darker silhouette is very definite against the usual milk-white fog before my eyes. He turns to face me.
"Ron's brother's wedding. Scrimgeour is dead; the Death Eaters have taken the Ministry." Potter's voice is hollow. "We left immediately, and now we can't go back without drawing attention. It's too dangerous for anyone to associate with me."
"We are going to behave as though it doesn't matter, because it doesn't, and forget the whole thing. Then they'll leave us alone. Agreed?"
Tonight after dinner, there was a loud burst in the alcove where I was sitting. I knew immediately what it was, I used it myself more than once. Though the knowledge didn't help me against
"Patients of the same sex are not allowed to approach each other closer than within a distance of five feet."
“See… you fancy her! That’s why you don’t notice she’s dumb.” Fuck, fuck, fuck, I want to disappear on the spot.
When on Saturday morning we wade through the snow to our spot by the Lake to cast a Patronus - my hand in the crook of his elbow, a caress of his perfume, my joy bubbling, threatening to burst into sparks of bright
So what, if sometimes my heart would squeeze at the sight of his face from a certain angle? So what, if after seeing you in the papers I still couldn't gather myself back? So what if I still avoided Quidditch matches because you would be there? So what, if lied to him that nothing was wrong after seeing a glimpse of you in the Ministry? So what, if asleep in the wake of the night, with his quiet breathing and ruffled hair, he looked just like you?
- he meant... I don't know... Now, when I think of it, it sounded as though he knew he was going to die," Potter whispers miserably. "So it was his wish - his last wish - that I’d get you out of there. I... told them that you were killed on the Astronomy Tower, and the Death Eaters took your body when they fled. So I-"
It's just the thought that all these people - everyone within these walls - have no doubt read the words that I was pouring out of my heart only for Noir to see, every single one. I feel stripped off my skin, laid bare, exposed for everyone to laugh at. My every notion, doubt, sadness and joy; my every day, night and morning; my smiles, my laugh, a flicker of attraction, an innocent teasing and a plain truth.
I cast the spell, and box takes the size of my palm. What is that supposed to mean? I turn it this way and that, looking at the bottom for signs or markings. Nothing. I close the lid, open it again - and find a piece of parchment that surely wasn’t there a moment ago.
His face is covered with glitter, almost nothing remaining of the stars. Even his hair is sparkling, like snow in the sun - comes the thought.
The sky is fake, there's no 'outside' behind the window. The window is fake, it's not a window. It's the Room playing tricks with me, so that I’ll find my prison pleasant. And pleasant it is.
"It's done with a wand," he said, "but nothing prevents you from doing it wandlessly. Look." Without a warning, he took my hand, pressing it to the parchment. "Now, the spell is
"Ron!" Harry shouts, and Weasley, with his face twisted, jerks Granger out of the line of the falling chandelier.
the sign drawn above it. He drew it himself, he gave us a clue! The Cloak - I already have it, so..." He looks at me. "The only thing is left to find is-"
There's a giant among them: long shaggy beard and hair and a moleskin coat. No, not a giant, it's Hagrid. Hagrid is holding a bundle in his arms.
Last night brought us something that hasn't been there before. We tried to have everything, to go all the way, but failed. Maybe our bodies weren't ready yet, or maybe I wasn't insistent enough when he refused to hurt me further. It takes a new kind of trust, and now I know - we have it.
Puddlemere United fans are not that easily recognised at Hogwarts, especially when they deliberately try not to give themselves away. But there's another thing I look closely at: handwriting.
I can't tell the moment when it came to that. I was never aware when it came to that. And still I am not.
We are not touching, except for our locked hands, and it feels so good. He places his other hand over mine in his grip.
"Turn off the lights." My voice cracks. I wipe the wetness in the corner of my eye. I don't want him to see my face.
"They... the Order, I think," I continue, "they brought him into the house of Black and he stayed with us - with
She puts a wand on the table. I recognise it, it’s her old wand that I’d been using after the war before purchasing a new one after my house arrest.
I fainted halfway before the Dark Lord was done with me, and bore the rest without complaint. Though I doubt it pleased my Father much. The sheer agony of it... They say even Snape shrieked like crazy receiving the Mark.
"I brew it myself and… add it to my shampoo and shower gel, hand soap, that stuff. Even to my shaving foam, a body lotion..." He sounds embarrassed.
Last night after my breakdown, Potter made me go to bed, saying that we'd most definitely talk about it in the morning.
"Now is the time to declare yourself." The Dark Lord raises his voice, and the cheers die down. "Come forward, and join us... Or die."
I count. There are forty-four in this one, and when I finally reach it, taking a turn to the right into the corridor to my room… there's
A stinging pain slashes at my chest, and my blood gushes hot. There's so much blood and there'll be more, I know. I've been here before. There'll be blood enough to drown the bloody Great Hall... there'll be blood and blood and blood on the floor until nothing will remain in me.
He kisses me, long and slow and clings, and then turns to drop flat on his stomach, breathing heavily.
"Yes," you said, feeling a tear rolling out of the corner of your eye. You didn't think there was a way to fix you, to fix it all.
It's as though a huge weight is being lifted off my chest, letting me finally breathe. No matter what happens next, she is by my side, and everything will be okay.
Reaching for my juice, I knock the glass over, feeling the cool liquid spreading over the front of my trousers. "Fuck… Sorry." I stand up.
He says nothing, and I assume he did turn away. Or he didn’t. I don’t know. Not that I care. I’m not sure why I asked him to turn away in the first place. I tug my boxers down and hastily meddle with the new ones. Done. Okay, my shirt. I put it on, buttoning it down. Trousers. On. Tucking the shirt in, I fumble with the belt buckle.
We were the last today finishing at Potions, and when Ron and Hermione showed up to pick me, I told them I'd be fine with Malfoy. And now we are late.
You couldn't see your Mother's face in the dark room. Having been lying in bed all day long, you hadn't bothered to turn on the lights.
"I know." Potter looks me in the eyes. "You went to Dumbledore, you switched sides; you saved me when I was corrupted by the Horcrux. All this time, you could have summoned You-Know-Who any moment, couldn't you? Hand me over and be rewarded... but you never did."
Potter is sitting motionless at the mouth of the cave, watching the rain, his silhouette barely visible against the night.
My friends didn't know I was on the potion half the time. I never told them and forbade Kreacher to mention it to anyone.
I barely have a moment to brace myself, barely have a second to see a flash of blond hair falling across his bewildered eyes, as I whirl him around to face me, to wrench him close and meet his lips.
Father glances briefly at Potter, who sits with his arms crossed, staring out of the window. His presence is steadying, and at the same time a bit unsettling. I am trying so hard not to appear a sissy in front of him.
"I was so shocked," I say, "that was insane. And then I wrote you that I fantasised about you, imagining it were you, but I didn't know that, we both had no idea... it's crazy."
It was pretty much the same as the day before: he approached, he stood, he sighed, he said nothing and eventually left.
He says nothing for a while, but then I feel his hand on my shoulder... and another hand strokes my hair, and then a weight presses on top. I open my eyes and realise he is leaning his head against mine, kneeling in front of me.
"Look..." Potter is pacing the kitchen. "Okay, I think... a meeting with your father may be arranged. But you'll have to speak to him in my presence. So that he won't be able to do anything. He wouldn't want to have an Auror for a witness." He turns to me. "Would that be okay?"
"This is some wild shit, Potter, but it had never happened." Zabini stands up. "I may have exposed your letters, which I told you I regret, but I swear, I have nothing to do with writing them." He looks at Malfoy, whose face is something between horrified and resigned.
“A shower?” Feeling strangely light-headed, I reach for the hem of my quidditch jumper, pulling it over my head.
Ron and I had made up. Next day, after our fight, when he dragged me to the Common Room, I'd apologised. To him and Hermione, and everything was the same again.
"Wait." His shoulder briefly brushes mine as he steps around me. "Wait," he repeats from behind, and his hands cover my eyes. "Is there any difference?"
When I slip into the living room, it's completely dark. I take a step forward and stop dead because there's rustling on the sofa. A sigh and... hot breathing, and... kissing sounds...
"Fuck, we need it right now," Potter says, taking the second glass and filling it for Weasley. I see his hands are shaking. He spills a bit and licks it off his fingers. He fills the next one and sends it in my direction. "There, Malfoy."
I met Theo in court. He stared at me across the courtroom, sitting next to his barrister. I felt the urge to bolt out and run, or to grab my wand and kill him on the spot. No, to slash his face open, to draw blood with some vile curse, torturing him, until his features would cease to be recognisable. I looked away.
"I have to go." I stand up. "I'll be back in a few days, I think. You must not leave the room. I told them that the Death Eaters took your body when they fled. So everyone here thinks you are dead, too."
His leather wristwatch box, the pair of cufflinks, the hard leather belt—everything bounced off the floorboards and joined the pile of clothes as you viciously threw the items down, one by one.
Gathering the supplies, I head upstairs. I want to have at least something finished before he returns.
He approached the table. There was something malicious in his deliberate gait. "I'm still here. But you two carry on."
"Why would someone write that?" I ask, just to have something to say, something to cover the sound of my heart going mad. I am weak with relief. Weak and stupid.
"All right," Weasley hissed, "I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful just because now there's another damn thing we've gotta find."
You squint, not able to make out the features of the person behind it. Their hand hovers above the bedside table, reaching for the lamp. And finally, when the light switches on, you stare dumbly in the mousy face of Henry fucking Ponder. You understand nothing anymore.
There is a noise from the Entrance Hall, a flood of voices and a shuffling of footsteps, and they are finally here.
I push Harry down on the ground and draw my wand. I hardly know what I'm doing, but I hope it's not too late. With a cutting spell, I slice the skin open over the bite. He screams, trying to wriggle his arm out of my grip.
I may have proved myself to be a coward and a weakling and earned nothing but his contempt, but I'll have him know, that night by the lake I wasn't false.
We sit in silence only disturbed by my sobs and a stray hiccup. When I finally calm down, her face turns solemn.
That means I have to keep an eye on Malfoy from now on, lest he gets harmed in my absence. I feel ill, and my face probably betrays me, because Dumbledore sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose with his good hand.
into my skin. It's coldness stings, and I try to shake it off, but the chain weaves around my wrist, clinging,
If someone told me a half a year ago that I might eventually like Malfoy, I would have laughed in their face. To like him, to really like him as a person? When the hell freezes, I would have told them.
I don't know how to put it, but most certainly, if it were Gin and I in their place, our kiss would've been neither that long, nor that heated. Kissing her I never managed to get
"No it's fine, I'm fine," he said. He apparently didn't want to discuss whatever it was on his mind.
"Now you go to bed and we'll see in the morning." His footsteps retreat, he switches the lights off. "Good night."
"Harry, I can get you out of here," I whisper urgently, looking around, lest someone may overhear. "Come with me, we only need to find the Vanishing Cabinet." I step towards him. "It opens to the
I wrench the Common Room door open, heading straight to the sofa to grab the front of Zabini's shirt. I press my knee into his stomach and his eyes go wide.
Harry comes forward. From this spot, I only see his back: unruly black hair gathered in a loose bun, his grey hoodie - the very one he was wearing when I saw him for the last time. The broad square set of his shoulders... the frame of his glasses glints against his temple as he turns his head... My throat aches. I can't breathe.
He drops my arm and there's a pop of the vial being uncorked before cool glass presses to my lips. I cover his hand with mine over the vial and tip the contents into my mouth. Done.
I mean, there are Ron and Hermione, of course, and we talk, but it's not the same. Ginny and I never talked that much... especially, not about
I don't think I remember him wearing anything short-sleeved, even on the hottest of days in early September, when Quidditch practice first began for the season. Unlike the rest of us, he was always clothed to the brim, buttoned up, and was never seen taking his jersey off. In the locker room and showers, he always entered the stall with his shirt on and emerged nearly fully dressed. Of course it made sense.
Next time, I open my eyes to my Mother. Her head rests against the back of the armchair, she breathes quietly in her sleep. I realise that the pain has subsided and it's now a steady, dull throb rather than the sharp stinging I felt waking up for the first time.
Approaching Grimmauld Place slowly, I cannot see Number 12 from the street. It's concealed from prying eyes with a Fidelius Charm and other heavy warding spells for good measure. He'd cast them himself, and they are holding better than the Ministry wards, Potter had told me this morning, handing me a piece of paper.
They shut themselves in the kitchen, often summon Kreacher, and talk, talk, talk. Whisper when I'm around, giving each other signs. Fall silent whenever I so much as glance in their direction. Cryptic conversations:
He puts his arm over my shoulders, steering me to the side, through the mob of people, until we stop. He takes my hand, putting it on the bannisters.
The students are returning from the Easter break. I see Neville in the doorway, I see Susan and Dean… I see Hermione, talking to Ron, removing her scarf on the way. She finally notices me. I raise my hand in greeting. She stops dead. And stares in shock. And tugs at Ron's hand. And runs towards me through the crowd.
"Yeah." I know what he means. I don't only lack the energy to retort; Potter doesn't get to me like he used to in the first place. Definitely this thing on my wrist is fucking with my senses. "It's been like this since Father put it on me."
had sent it to me as a birthday present this summer, but I hadn’t even unwrapped it. It’s at Grimmauld. I plan to give it to Teddy, once he’s a bit older.
"I imagine he must feel really lonely, if his only option to talk about it is through the Common Room information board."
My eyes snap open, and the sun’s reflection off the water hits me right in the face. I squint at you across the pool.
I find his hand over the blanket. The murmur of voices resumes around us as though nothing has happened. And nothing has, really, it's just the two of us in one bed, with our heads close.
Weasley is gripping Potter's shoulder, holding Granger's hand, but... I see Yaxley appearing behind, clutching at the hem of Granger's jacket. Granger kicks him sideways, and the three of them suddenly disappear, leaving Yaxley alone on the porch. Everything happens in the blink of an eye.
I step in front of him. Taking his face in my palms, I kiss him, slow and hot, and our tongues finally meet, our breaths urgent. I am so hard.
Unfolding a piece of paper, he begins to read: "I am a married man, and cannot wish for a better wife than merciful God bestowed me with."
She points at Harry. Students back away from him as if burnt. Slowly, he turns to look at her. They stare at each other, and then someone steps in front of Harry, pointing a wand at Pansy.
"You are to depart tomorrow morning. Have the elves pack your things for you. You are to stay there as long as it takes to get you back to normal. It is a Muggle facility, so your Muggle clothes and knowledge," he spat the words in distaste, "will serve a good purpose for once."
Weasley thought it was natural that I was the best thief of us all. I'd never had any practice at it until that first chicken and eggs on the farm." I look up at him. For some reason, this talk makes me feel bad about myself. And even more so, it makes me look bad in front of him, and I hate it.
It seems like Potter's right. It's been a week, and the house has taken to me. Ever since I began to play the piano in the mornings, the living room has been transforming. It looks brighter, it feels cosier, it's becoming a place where one wants to spend their evenings in front of the fire.
Staring at him in horror, you shook your head. If you had words, you would have told him everything, but you had none.
"All right, mate." Nodding, he grabbed my hand, pulling me up close, until I bumped into him, gripping him around the shoulders, and he squeezed my back, and we were all right again.
" I grab him by the collar. "Don't you fucking dare to drag Ginny into this, I'll fucking kill you! Stay away from her!"
And I came, came so hard I forgot myself. That was the night I felt him inside me for the first time.
When he comes back from the loo, I'm pretending to be asleep. With a sigh, he runs his hand through my hair.
Desperate, I reach for the coin in my pocket, but it's cold and useless and slips through my fingers onto the stone floor. Fear grips me.
Eventually, I had to get out of bed and visit the bathroom. That's where I saw the bath. A huge white marble basin with shining taps. It looked so inviting. I began to unbutton my shirt but then my hands stilled. What if Potter came and saw me in the bath, naked?
I look at his back and hunched shoulders, at his blond hair, golden in the lamplight. Uneasiness lodges in my chest, ties my stomach in knots. He's right, it's madness, and chances are high that we won't return.
I haven't seen Malfoy almost for a week. He skips classes, doesn't attend meals. Parkinson throws me murderous glances every time she sees me.
"I'm talking about this bastard." I point at Malfoy. "Making the two-way post-box to help you play a very funny joke on me; just like he'd made the Vanishing Cabinet work to help his Death Eater friends out." My voice is cruel, and a helpless look on Malfoy's face makes me even angrier. "Old habits die hard,
"I told him that Theo had made it all up, but he wouldn't listen... He said you admitted it to be true. Draco, why?.."
Scream caught in my throat, I bolt upright. I didn't know it would feel like that. So many things, so many colours, so much
I reached around you again to touch the handles with my fingertips, and the motorbike rumbled alive.
deserves that, and neither do you. Having been there myself... what am I supposed to do? Throw you out of my house, knowing full well what would happen?"
His words cause our side to gasp and waver. His words don't have power over me. All this time I knew, and I was
I dash down the stairs to the basement, praying that her shrieks cover the noise I make. When I wrench the kitchen door open, by the sounds from the hall I realise Yaxley is dealing with Dumbledore's shadow. I sprint across the kitchen to the backyard and shut the door, leaning with my back against it, and try to catch my breath. Insane with terror, I realise that Yaxley is going to search the house. Even if he doesn't intend to do it right now, he'll let Death Eaters do it later, now that Fidelius has failed.
"Master don't see, " he repeated. "It is morning but Master think it is night, his eyes don't see. Master hurt his feet."
Undressing, I drop my clothes on the floor where Kreacher will pick them up tomorrow and bring me clean ones. I climb into bed and lie for a while, thinking, remembering dully how I hated my glasses, how they always got in the way, how I wished to get rid of them. I don't need glasses now, I got rid of them for good. If I hadn't taken the potion, I would be weeping, crying myself to sleep. But I had. I am calm as a brick, but sleep won't come. And when it does, I will see
“You won’t be getting in the way, Harry,” Hermione says in exasperation. “Besides, I don’t think Ronald will be brewing either.”
You loved when he was like this, easy warmth softening his sharp smile. Once, you thought it would never come to this. Once, having him let you this close was all you wanted. And now he was letting you. Why, then, did you feel sick? Why was his innocent lie rotting your heart, turning the joy of his presence ugly?
strikes me. Clear as the day. It's been staring me in the face all along, only I was too stupid to realise it.
I look down at Malfoy. I did, I promised. Did I have a choice? There's no time for that right now. I bend over Malfoy and grab his ankles. Though skinny, the bastard is heavy as fuck, and I barely manage to move him at first. My hands are shaking.
Idiots, why would someone even do such a thing in a place like this? No doubt their parents will shut them here for good. The memory of the Bible falling down across Paul's head makes you wince and squeeze your eyes shut.
He turns to meet my eyes. And when I think there is possibly no joy greater than I already feel - he
understand that we should take responsibility for our actions, even unintentional ones. Forgive me, I am not able to release you from this bond. It dissolves as soon as you fulfill your debt.
The softness of the black cashmere nestled under your jaw, making you itch with the memories of him outlined against the bright window. He turned his head, sunlight dancing in the disarray of his hair, even more pale and golden against the severity of the black covering him up to the chin. He looked breathtaking in black. You never told him. You didn’t need to. He knew.
"It was the least I could do to right the wrongs I caused you, going along with your Father's will - again..." She looks away.
A hand appears out of thin air in front of me. Potter's hand. My heart jumps, and I grab it, letting myself be pulled into the spelled area.
Welcoming. He was holding a wine glass, absently tracing the stem with his fingertips as he listened to Ron. I struggled to bring my breath under control.
"Jealous?" Hearing him admitting it felt so satisfying, exhilarating, I wanted to know more, to know everything, to put the pieces together and figure out what my own thoughts were at the time, what my fears were, to find out he felt the same. "Go on…"
More. Dashing down the stairs, you headed to the kitchen, throwing the heap of defeated things a murderous look. The fine porcelain cup on the counter exploded along with its saucer as soon as you set your eyes on it from the doorway. He liked it a lot.
every single person there will know me, will see me, will pity Harry bloody Potter, the fucking Chosen One, The Boy Who Lived Twice only to become no more than a helpless baby, a burden to his friends.
I trace his eyebrow, sliding my fingertips down over his temple… along the side of his face and jaw… his chin is pointy - of course, it is - I grin, I
"So now you must kill me along with the Horcrux so that your secret dies with me." I wiggle my eyebrows at Weasley.
"I'm going to speak to it in Parseltongue." Harry turns to me. "Draco, come here. Stand behind me. You too, Hermione."
She doesn't listen. "We are trying, Harry, all the time… You want us to behave like everything's the same! And when we do - you immediately remind us that it's not!"
Man-and-woman, boy-and-girl, M-and-F, couples swirl around. Those, at least, who know how to swirl. Those who don’t sway modestly in place, shuffling their feet to the music.
I thought, and was about to call Kreacher - to get me the fuck out of here and back to Grimmauld, when the bell announced the end of the class and there was a noise of chairs, shuffling of feet, people flooding the corridor.
"Yes, Master." The elf snaps his fingers, and a bottle swims in the air through the doorway surrounded with four glasses.
I turn on the spot, dumbly surveying chaos around me. Death Eaters fight, Death Eaters flee, Death Eaters giving way. And there, in the middle, the body lies motionless. The body of the man who called himself the Dark Lord. I step closer. In his death, he looks like any other. Just a man.
Throwing me a glance, Malfoy takes the handle but doesn't open the door right away. Instead, he's just standing there, looking at me.
I try to eavesdrop by the door, but can't make out any sound. They have been at it for about an hour now.
If I knew what to do or how, I would certainly make it right. I would grab his face between my palms; I would crush his lips to draw blood. I would be bold and reckless and sure. I don't know how.
"You don't have to..." With a flick of my hand, I send ripples across the water, watching as they shine and flow to finally touch you, caressing the tender skin on the inside of your wrist.
I didn't let you read. I don't know why, but your tone, a book in your hands, had suddenly pissed me off. You were
"I think," I begin, making Aunt Bella look away from Harry and turn to me, "Potter may be even dead by now, but the Order conceals it."
, towards him is surprising. The last time I saw him was during his trials. Gaunt, grey in the face, he avoided my eyes altogether after the one shocked glance he shot me when I rose from my seat to speak in his defence. I hardly hated him anymore, but he still was one of the few who could spark a reaction - something, anything, a knee-jerk response. I disliked, despised him and pitied him, but at the same time, I couldn’t let him be thrown into Azkaban - he didn’t deserve it. The odd mix of things he made me feel annoyed me, morbidly kept my attention, made me scan the newspapers for any scraps of information about him. Back then, he still was
"I am gay," I say, and Father winces, "and I am your son. And neither of those things is going to change."¹
serving as someone's joke, or the reason to shake their heads in bewilderment and pity, turning me into a sultry gossip.
Theo had turned the story around, telling your Father that you had tried to rape him and then Crucioed him when you hadn’t got what you wanted.
We burst into the seventh-floor corridor and hit the wall. Harry grunts as I land on top of him. Granger is already running back to the entrance. As soon as Weasley and Goyle fly out of the Room, she points her wand and seals the entrance where hellish flames fight each other, and finally sags on the floor.
Following the odd urge, your hand landed on her shoulder, gently turning her around. You didn't know what you were doing.
So when Friday night finds me in front of the information board in the Common Room, I snap. Swearing, I tear down the moving photo-collage of me and Malfoy. It's arranged like something out of a fucking scrapbook, with hearts and shit, making us seem like we're in love.  My face looks at me, cut out from the old newspapers, enclosed in a huge red heart, next to Malfoy's.
