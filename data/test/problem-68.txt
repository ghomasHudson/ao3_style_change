Draco doesn’t know why Harry feels any boredom, what with being the Chosen One. And if he knew everything in store for him...well, Draco guesses Harry would wish for his boredom back. But maybe not. Draco doesn’t know him that well, clearly.
“You’re back?”
A few seconds later the door swings open, and Harry’s on the other side, grinning. He’s wearing sweatpants and a loose fitting black shirt, and his dark hair is mussed like he’d just been napping.
“Well, I do not know exactly, but I suppose he will have abilities and insight that wizards and witches do not.”
Harry sits up, dropping Ginny’s hand. She straightens her head, and Harry can just make out her blue eyes, so bright and startling in a sea of brown freckles. She looks at Harry with a terrible pity.
“Is that how you greet an old friend?” the figure says, then throws his hood back, revealing Harry’s familiar face like a shock to his system, and he drops his wand, sighing.
“I need to go,” Harry cuts them off with a smile which they can’t help but return with a little confusion as to why, “another time we’ll talk.” Then he just catches up to Draco’s deliberate steps that turn down a quieter street. What is he up to?
“I don’t care,” he says.
“Ginny doesn’t want to date me,” Harry says, carefully closing his book, as if sensing the interruption is leading to a longer conversation. “Trust me.”
“What is it?”
Draco turns, eyes downcast. He walks towards a nearby pile of junk, covered in a thick layer of dust, and something large and looming covered in a dirty white sheet. He pulls the sheet off in one fluid motion, revealing the Vanishing Cabinet that he’s been working so tirelessly on for these past months.
Yes, the war stole some moments from her, but it also gave her new ones.
“You didn’t stop me,” Draco says in a weak, drained voice when she’s gone. He lowers his wand, and slumps back against the wall, his eyes shut.
“Oh, Harry!” she exclaims brightly. Harry smiles back at her, then turns to Draco, who immediately begins to blush.
Mrs Malfoy looks away. Harry thinks he might have gone too far, and she would not answer, but she looks at him again with pleading eyes. “Mr Potter, though I know it is not my place, I must ask you a favor. Mr Malfoy, you must know, will be attending Hogwarts for his Eighth Year. He will not have many friends there. I fear for his safety.”
The Wizarding world, much to Harry’s surprise and most other Muggleborns, is quite formal. As Miss Granger likes to joke, the magical population had no need for technology, so it halted progress in the eighteen hundreds and has hardly budged since.
“So when will this be done? Maybe by tomorrow night?” Harry asks.
The words hit Harry and he nearly collapses. Every moment he’s ever thought that perhaps if they just loved each other enough, that this torrential force of nature that has ripped everything he’s known for certain to shreds, that this heart wrenching pain could conquer anything—it all pierces through whatever strength is holding him together, and a deep shame flames his cheeks.
from his wand weakly lit his pale features, catching on the slender lines of his collarbone.
Harry tightens his grip, silencing Draco. “I don’t care,” he says firmly.
The Lumos from his wand cannot shine on the Map and his surroundings at the same time, so Harry makes the slow trek stopping to look down at his map and noting where Malfoy is, and then holding his wand out to make sure he’s in the right place.
“And I know you have a little...obsession with Malfoy,” she continues hesitantly. He tenses. His mouth works, as if he’s considering what it would be like to confess his love for Draco, but then his mouth settles into a frown, and she sighs.
Harry and Draco look at each other silently after he’s gone, before Harry sidles up beside Draco at the bar, his pulse thrumming in his veins like it used to before a Quidditch game. He notices a light smudge of kohl under Draco’s eyes, and the tight black shirt that pronounces his paleness in the same way a white marble statue gleams in a dark room.
Hermione snaps her attention back to the present, shaking off her half formed thoughts. She’s very close to piecing it all together, but there’s still a few missing links.
A heavy hush had fallen among them, and it felt almost magical, as if Harry’s words had settled a mist around them and the ghosts of people they will always remember had laid a hand on their shoulders, a blessing from an angel.
“He’s out there. I can feel it. And he’s angry. I can feel it in my bones. Sometimes I swear...he’s inside me, like a snake, right under my skin, so close I can see the scales.”
“No,” Harry says flatly, “I suppose not.”
She’s clearly in the Potions classroom, but Professor Slughorn hasn’t arrived yet. Hermione stands up and walks around, looking at all the familiar faces, trying to forget those that died in the war. Younger Ron sits between younger Harry and Hermione.
“What does that mean?” Harry asks angrily.
She should want someone that will want her for his own, like Harry said.
They stay like that until Harry’s skin is cool. He rolls off Draco, looking up at the ceiling. Draco scoots closer and rests his cheek against Harry’s chest, placing a hand on Harry’s stomach.
Elegant script covered his left abdomen. Colored flowers and symbols he didn’t recognize decorated his stomach and continued around the curve to his back. His arms were bare, save for the Dark Mark, which didn’t look quite as odd next to the other ink.
“We realized it was Draco,” Ron interjects, “but it was hard to imagine at first. I always thought you two hated each other. I mean, you were constantly trying to rat him out, so it made no sense.”
So why was he searching for him throughout the night? Glancing around for a wave of brown hair, or that charming smile of someone everyone knew and liked?
He thinks about his wand and attempting any magic with it. The very thought makes his throat tighten uncomfortably, and the back of his neck prickles. What will everyone say when they discover his utter inept after defeating the greatest sorcerer in the world? He will surely fall into disgrace; not being able to do magic is nearly as great an evil as using magic for true evil. Harry’s face burns under Miss Granger’s knowing scrutiny.
“No,” Harry says firmly.
She doesn’t like to look at Harry’s face. He’s often pale for one moment, then flushed hot as if he’s caught a fever the next. His eyes are empty, void of emotion, like looking down a dark, dark tunnel.
Hermione Apparates, and straightens herself on the porch, self-consciously tugging at her suit. She wonders in a second of doubt whether Pansy had tricked her into buying an unflattering suit to humiliate her, but then reprimands herself for assuming ill of her just because she’s a Slytherin. Just look at Draco, he turned out to be very gracious.
Harry felt oddly calm, the same feeling he had the moment before he died all those years ago, standing before Voldemort’s red eyes. Right before the flash and everything went white, like the center of a star.
Could Harry have been harboring a secret this big from both Ron and Hermione without them noticing in the slightest? Perhaps with their current feud and Lavender always stealing him away, neither of them had the means to see it.
Draco goes still, that familiar chill creeping up his skin. He ignores it, pulling Harry closer and kissing him. When he pulls away, Draco says with surprising honesty, “When I’m not with you, it’s like I’m already dead.”
“Ginny, why don’t you sit down?” Hermione asks nervously. “Harry was just telling us about the memories Dumbledore has been showing him. About Tom Riddle’s past.”
Harry nods once, then settles back on the couch, reopening his Map. With the dangling mystery right in front of her, Hermione knows she will not be able to focus on her reading assignment—at least, not beside Harry.
“But we can’t ignore it anymore,” Harry says harshly. Then with more urgency, “War is coming, Draco, I can feel it. I can feel him waiting for it. I know you can feel it too. Seeing Katie Bell...it brought me back to reality. We can’t live in our fantasy anymore. At some point we will have to pick a side. Both of us.”
“I need my best friend,” Ginny says softly, looking into Harry’s green eyes, bright and flickering despite the darkness. She reaches up and tussles his dark curls, then kisses his cheek. “You’re somewhere else, aren’t you?”
“You asked why I’m here,” Harry says slowly, still watching the ash float away in the air, falling like snow on the ground. He looks up at Draco, and Draco is startled at the heat in his eyes, the deep green of an emerald stone lost for centuries under the sea, the color that haunts his dreams at night. “But I think you already know. It’s the same reason you’re here, after all.”
Harry’s voice echoes in the night and Draco sends a desperate prayer up to the constellation of his namesake to make this moment last forever.
The door downstairs swings open, then closes shut, loud enough that Draco knows he was meant to hear it.
Draco left without saying goodbye, and then Harry doesn’t remember much after that.
want to work with the Ministry,” Ron finishes.
“I’d better find them. Can you tell Pansy?” She doesn’t wait for his response, heading straight for the boys’ dormitories first. She walks carefully up the stairs and down the hallway, checking every room, but to no avail. She even checks the bathrooms, but they are empty, the music from below echoing through the floor.
Hermione leaves them be to bask in the attention of a new engagement. She remembers how it felt, and looks toward the kitchen, where she glimpses Ron bent over the oven, his cheeks flushed, and she cannot escape a smile.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Exactly.”
Boys, boys, boys. Girls, girls, girls....
And yet, she pities him, despite it all. He does not understand her. How could he? His eyes flash with a similar resentment that Draco had shown, as if she were hurting them, when it is really the other way around. But it’s not their fault, it’s not anyone’s fault, and she forgives them both.
But it won’t work this time. No one saves a Slytherin that does not want to be saved.
“Tell me.”
She understands now, though her brain has ceased to function. Ron and Pansy find her seated on a couch a few minutes later, silent and staring off into space.
Silence descends on the family. Then after a moment, Harry speaks, his voice sharp.
Slughorn looks between Draco and Harry anxiously. “Yes, the side effects. Well, you see memories are very tricky things. Imagine memory as a thread, and each memory connected in an elaborate knot. By taking away the pain and suffering, you snip away threads and loosen the knot, sometimes leaving the person unable to comprehend who they are. Many go mad because of this, despite being left with only pleasant memories.”
It was still strange to consider Draco their ally instead of their sworn enemy. He had been the one to let in Death Eaters into Hogwarts last year, after all. But Harry was there, that night. In the end, Draco had accepted Dumbledore’s offer to help and had fled with them almost immediately after, as his family had disinherited him and had sent Death Eaters to kill him.
Hermione wonders silently if she ever truly trusted Harry.
“Manors are typically held within a family for centuries,” Malfoy says quietly, and Harry, startled at the familiar voice in such a setting, looks up at him. Their eyes lock, before Malfoy glances away with a slight frown. “Many of them will have traps, usually dark spells, to stop intruders.”
Hermione almost lets him go when a memory, a moment, really, flashes through her mind. A harmless, mundane conversation that she can scarcely remember now passes through her mind, but it wasn’t that which she finds peculiar now. It was Draco, when they were back in school, must have been in Sixth Year, huddled against the wall with Pansy Parkinson. They walked past and she caught Harry looking at him, smirking, and she remembers her surprise that Draco was looking right back, with a small, private smile on his face.
“Oh Harry, good,” she says. “I’d love to hear what you think.”
Despite herself, she focuses on Ron again, his childish frown at Hermione’s admonishment softening to a fond shake of his head when younger Hermione looks away. Hermione smiles, startled, at the clear look of love on Ron’s face. How did she ever miss it?
“You need to get dressed.”
“And?”
One light and the other dark. Both alone. Ginny had known so painfully then.
Harry had been gambling with Draco, taking a shot in the dark and hoping it would land. He had gone crazy, since the moment he saw Draco at the charity ball, his pale face and grey eyes scanning the room and finding his like two magnets. Couldn’t keep away, like a moth drawn to the flame.
“Oh!” a voice exclaims from behind them.
“Quite the reader, are you?” Harry comments, and Draco curses to himself before turning around. To his dismay, Harry is leaning against the book shelf, looking at Draco with eyes like burning coals, as if his gaze could burn a path through Draco’s mind.
Hermione looks hurt. “Harry’s still human, even when he doesn’t believe it.”
“Your family,” Pansy says desperately. “Your family will die. He will kill them, and you know it. Think of your mother, Draco. She would die if you did this. Please, come here. We’ll get through this together. Just come here. Please.”
The apartment suddenly sounds empty, hollow, even though she knows Draco is upstairs. She feels terribly alone, and wishes that she could be asleep, but knows that is futile. Still, she returns to her bed, wanting the comfort of her soft sheets, of her bedroom, which she has called home for these past few months. Tears well in her eyes, and she shudders, closing in on herself, willing the tears away. Where can she go from here?
“Draco,” Harry says desperately, moving forward with arms stretched out, supplicating, but Draco scrambles away. “Draco, please, you have to choose. It’s him or me. It’s that simple.”
Harry looks down at his letter again, ignoring their stares. He was accepted into Herbology, Charms, and Care of Magical Creatures. He was not accepted by Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Government, all of which are needed to become an auror. At the bottom of his letter is a statement from the Headmistress. It reads:
Draco glances at Harry then, his face very serious, but his gaze subdued, almost thoughtful. Hermione doesn’t understand. She looks at Harry, but unsurprisingly he’s not much help, staring at the table in front of him, seemingly lost in thought. Ron and her younger self start playing footsie under the desk, bickering about something.
“So,” Hermione says loudly, and Harry looks at her, startled. “I heard you and Ginny made up.” She smiles at him encouragingly.
the broken one, not him.
He enters into a lift that’s just closing, smiling at an elderly lady with a hat that nests a family of bluebirds. She smiles at Harry, but her eyes are sad. Harry’s used to seeing it after the war. Everyone has lost something, after all.
“Is this okay?” Pansy asks. Harry nods, then she lowers herself further, until her cunt is lined with his mouth, and his lips kiss her sensitive skin. He searches with his tongue for the right spot, his jaw straining against the weight.
and lastly, Care of Magical Creatures with Professor Hagrid
“Nothing you can do now will make me forgive you,” Harry says in a low, even voice. He looks at Draco, and it’s like they’re in Sixth Year again, his grey eyes wavering and his mouth twisted and his hands clenched at his sides. Harry wonders how he could ever think all those memories were buried with the past. “So please, don’t try.”
"Me too."
“Come, mama, open the letters!” Miss Weasley cries.
Draco gasps, like his words were a sword that speared his chest, straight through the heart. He feels like crying. “How dare you—”
Harry hates him, suddenly, with such intensity that only when he realizes he's kissing Draco with as much strength as he can muster does he realize that he only hates how much he loves him anyway. Beneath his lips Draco moans in delighted surprise, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. Harry pushes away all the doubts, all the worries, that he is walking a line too thin to hold his weight, to keep afloat the heavy darkness in his soul, and plies Draco’s mouth open with his tongue.
the one who asked him in the first place.”
“Yes, thank you.”
“Sometimes the dark overpowers the light,” Harry says.
He sighs and opens his briefcase, casting a quick
Harry looks down at his hands in his lap and says quietly, “It was never hate.”
He walks towards the edge, looking down at the black abyss, knowing always a second too late that he’s falling, falling backwards like his father, Albus Dumbledore, the person he looked up to and the person he loved and the person he resented, all at the same time.
“I just worry about us, Harry. I worry about you.”
“Is that so?” Harry asks.
It’s time for the surprise.
“You’re having nightmares again,” Lucy says. It’s not a question.
“The Map must be lying,” Hermione suggests, though even to herself she sounds like she doubts it. Despite herself, the mystery of it intrigues her. Harry shakes his head vigorously.
“Just because it was not the easy choice doesn’t mean you didn’t have one.”
And yet, there was something, something unnamed, that held them apart. A certain tension when they were together, a glance at the wrong moment, a brush of their hands as they stood side by side that sent Harry's heart beating. He did not know what it was and yet he knew. Of course he
Ginny stares at the floor, clenching her fist and then letting it release slowly. She turns around and looks at him; Harry’s hair is a splash of dark ink against the sea of white kitchen cabinets and counters, and he stares at Ginny with a mixture of longing and bitterness.
“Hey,” she says, sitting down on the ground beside him. Harry looks up at her, surprised. He smiles, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “What are you doing?”
Then Harry climbs over him, lowering his hips carefully, his hands grasping Draco’s hips, sliding around his shoulders, his head falling into Draco’s neck, kissing him there over and over, each time his hips rock forward, carrying him over Draco’s body.
“Good evening, Hogwarts,” she begins in a solemn tone. “I believe tradition would demand us to feast before I make any speech, but under the present circumstances, I believe that a few words to begin with will allow us to truly enjoy our meal, as everyone will thus be on the same page.
Draco moved. Harry’s heart pounded. A hand touched his and Harry breathed in sharply.
Muggle Studies with Mr Creevey, highly selective
His task to kill Harry’s father, Albus Dumbledore.
The hand slid up and down with the mouth, and Harry’s legs shook, his eyes shutting tightly. A tremor began at the base of his spine, then his stomach quivered, and Harry grasped the sheets, his hips lifting up, deeper into Draco’s mouth which hollowed around his dick, until his nerves could not take it anymore and his release came in white-hot pulses from deep within.
He smooths out his clothes that always get a little cramped after Apparating. Then he takes a deep breath and knocks.
Hermione reluctantly watches Malfoy’s footsteps trail down the hall, take a turn, pause, then disappear entirely, as if the ink melted away into the paper. She looks up at Harry, and he returns the look with a grim smile of satisfaction.
Draco looks at him, then glances down the hall. Snape’s heeled shoes click louder and louder on the smooth floor and Harry holds his breath.
“We both had a choice,” Harry says darkly. “And we both chose the wrong ones.”
“You’re driving me mad, Draco,” Harry whispers, and he bites his bottom lip.
“Yes, Ron,” Harry says, trying not to sound annoyed. After all, it is about time that they both realize what is inevitable. Ginny had always joked about them being as blind as bats. Maybe a little innocent push in the right direction won’t hurt? “You should make sure she doesn’t trip and fall in the snow, though.”
“No,” Draco says curtly. “I was just leaving.”
Weasley holds back a laugh. “Alchemy? How horrid!”
Madame Pomfrey said the scars will be there forever. She could try to remove them...but Draco refused. He didn’t want them to just disappear, for the only mark Harry visibly left on him to fade away so easily. Besides, they weren’t large, gnarly gashes across his chest and stomach. Just faint silvery lines, so faint on his pale skin you had to squint to see them.
* * *
“I wouldn’t bother,” Harry says loudly, and the man turns around, puzzled and annoyed. When Draco sees Harry his eyes go wide, and then he blushes. “He only likes the taste of wine that’s too expensive for you to buy him.”
“Oi, eighth years, come over here!” Seamus yelled, enthusiastically waving his arm. Dean collapsed onto his side giggling.
Draco worries. He worries but he must hide it, for Harry’s sake. He cannot let Harry worry about their relationship, in case he decides it is too complicated and leaves. He also worries about Pansy, but less so, because he knows she can protect herself. But he worries about their friendship, or whatever this is, and if it will last.
Ginny pauses and listens.
“Hermione tells me—”
“Nonsense,” she says. “We shall see each other at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, not to mention the several classes we share together.”
Draco brought his hands up to their waist. Oh.
“Of course.” Harry follows with one last glance back at Weasley and Miss Granger, who board the train together and disappear inside. Mrs Weasley looks at him with a troubled expression. “Is something the matter?”
She doesn’t bother with ringing the doorbell. He won’t answer. Instead, she comes straight in without a key, the apartment recognizing her magic. The living room is empty and clean. No dirty dishes in the kitchen except a single glass. She thinks for a moment she catches a glimmer of a Concealment charm, but the thought that Harry would be hiding something in his kitchen just sounds too ridiculous for her to investigate.
“No,” Hermione says distractedly, remembering the memory of them fighting in Professor Slughorn’s class, “they didn’t…”
“Oh I don’t know, to ask her how she’s doing with something as emotionally draining as a break up,” Hermione replies tersely.
Hermione smiles, but it looks as wrong on her now as that champagne pink pant suit did. “Nothing, of course. It was just a question. Anyway, you’re probably right. I’m sure they did hate each other, in their own way.”
* * *
On the other side a quiet street unfurls in front of Ginny, with quaint houses lining both sides. It’s easy enough to tell which one belongs to Ron and Hermione. Or at least, Luna has taught her to notice the traces of magic people leave behind like fingerprints.
Not this time.
“I know.”
Ginny squares her shoulders, facing him. “If there’s a war, then there’s no one I’d rather be fighting beside than you.”
“No,” Slughorn says reluctantly, “not all of them. A few have been able to live without such...side effects, but they are never quite the same afterwards.”
“Please, open it. I need the Room of Requirement. I need Draco. I know he’s in there,” Harry whispers, his forehead pressed against the wall as if in prayer, his eyes shut tight. But the wall remains stone, and Harry slams his fists against it in a burst of frustration.
“I only meant—”
“You can sleep here,” Draco said.
Draco must choose, not Harry.
Harry.
“Why do you let the Ministry use you like that?”
“Then what are you interested in?” he asks.
“Stop,” Harry says, cutting her off. “You’re tired. You know all of this. You brewed the draught in second year, for Merlin’s sake. Go to bed.” He rubs at his eyes, though it’s more for show. “I think I might call it a night, too.”
“Hold on—” Ron begins, puzzled, but Harry cuts him off.
“Yes! Don’t be so loud, you’ll wake up Rose,” Ron says.
Harry avoids Malfoy’s carefully blank expression, instead exchanging greetings with Shacklebolt and hugging Hermione as he makes his way to her side of the desk.
Draco groans when the light beaming through his curtains wakes him up and stings his eyes as he tries to open them. He shifts around in bed, reaching for the covers, and his arm slams into something heavy and solid in his bed.
“Yes, Harry, I’m sorry, but I know and I couldn’t tell you.”
“Since when did you give a damn about what you should do?”
Suddenly Harry gets up, and quietly says goodnight, going off to the boy’s dormitory with the same closed off expression he had since the moment Ginny suggested going to Dumbledore.
* * *
“I didn’t mean to offend you,” Harry says, hesitantly.
Draco opens the door, ignoring the gentle swoosh of air from behind as a certain invisible someone sneaks through the quickly closing gap. Discreetly, Draco grabs hold of his wand, just the end beneath his robes. He walks several paces into the room so as not to appear suspicious, then suddenly he turns, casting a wordless
Harry had been sitting next to his friends at Hogsmeade, in a dingy bar that served them firewhiskey on the weekends. He was already tipsy by the time Draco, Pansy, and Blaise sauntered in.
“I suppose you mentioned me to her?”
“You are quite right, Miss Granger,” Mr Weasley says, inclining his head.
,” Hermione whispers to Ron furiously, glancing at the back door nervously. Draco can’t tell if she’s worried Professor Slughorn will come in before Harry, or that Harry will miss potions.
“I am afraid, dear, that Harry should be satisfied with his results. The Headmistress, after all, did not choose those accepted. Rather, a combination of previous marks and the limited capacity made it so that I am sure Harry is not the only one who must take other classes.”
He feels so alone.
“Promise me,” Harry says, “that we will never change.”
He’s just a few paces in front of the corner where Malfoy will turn at any moment. “
Harry bows to Mr and Mrs Weasley, then boards the train.
“That I would hate you,” Harry finishes, his voice cold and empty. Draco’s eyes flash with pain. Harry feels numb, battered, hollow. “That I would tell Dumbledore.”
“I heard that you also make undergarments for...the bedroom.”
“I guess it’s not exactly about Draco…” Hermione pauses, then looks Pansy directly in the eyes, and her dark gaze intimidates Pansy more than she’ll ever admit. “Do you know if Draco and Harry were ever...friends at Hogwarts?”
Harry flinches, and Draco wonders if he’s heard that before. “I will give you protection from the Ministry. Malfoy, please, I need this.”
A brief look of hurt flashes across Hermione’s face, which makes Ron regret his last comment said purely to anger her, when Hermione shakes her head, laughing without mirth. “You are so unbelievably full of yourself, Ron. It’s no wonder you have no more room in that pea-sized brain of yours for anything else.”
“I just want you to be careful,” she says sadly, knowing then that he will not confide in her with this.
Draco’s eyes narrow, but he remains impassive, barely looking at the book. “No.” He looks away, before turning back to Harry with a very calm gaze, almost steely. “You stole a kiss.” The moment the words fall from his lips, Draco blushes again, frowning intensely.
“Harry?” she calls out. No answer. She climbs the stairs next, trying his bedroom first. The room is dark as death, and she can just make out a curled up figure beneath the blankets. She sits down gently on the edge of the bed. “Harry,” she says, full of pity.
Harry raises his eyebrows. “You weren’t?”
“Well, good morning!” Hermione exclaims loudly.
They had been staying at Grimmauld Place for almost a month. But tonight was their last night before infiltrating the Ministry, and Hermione and Ron had fallen asleep together downstairs. Harry did not have the heart to wake them up; this could be their last night together.
Harry cannot respond. He slides a hand up Draco’s arm, whose smirk fades into that delicious frown. Harry leans forward and kisses him again, except it’s different this time, more purposeful, more open, and Draco tilts his head, causing Harry to taste more of him, his mouth inviting and foreign at the same time. He desperately wants to stop and never do anything but this for the rest of his life.
in the back of the library. His fingers brush over the spines, scanning the titles.
Ginny can quickly point out the windows and the structure and the lawn as examples of Hermione’s more clear cut, direct style of magic, while the artful colors of the wood panels, the slightly crooked attic window, and the homely pots with flowers on the porch that definitely creaks as you walk across it all subtly speak of Ron’s more casual, messy and yet personal magic touch. However, Ginny could not explain why she knows this; it’s a certain type of knowledge that comes only from careful, loving attention.
“You came back early.”
Ron looks at Hermione and shrugs. She makes a face to stay quiet.
Suddenly the door opens again, and this time it is Professor Slughorn, bustling in with an anxious smile, sweating slightly, and muttering apologies as he walks up the aisle to the front of the classroom. He pats his forehead with his handkerchief.
him, Harry.” Ginny takes Harry’s hand in hers. It’s weight is comfortable and yet heavy, like the shape of prison bars that are so familiar that gripping them is as grounding as it is burdensome. “The war has changed everyone. You know that more than anyone.”
“If Ron and Lavender are out at this hour, I wouldn’t be surprised others do too.” She blushes hotly, and hurriedly continues. “Malfoy is still a teenage boy. Honestly, I don’t understand why you are so determined to find evil where there is not.”
“It’s true enough. I just forgot to mention you have a penchant for vodka,” Harry says, and Draco laughs. The sound is not delicate or musically enchanting by an means, but it makes Harry dizzy as if intoxicated nevertheless, a little like the invincible feeling you get after drinking Liquid Luck.
“Tomorrow night,” Harry says roughly. “Meet me outside the Dining Hall after dark.”
“Girls?” Pansy echoes. “You don’t want to know which boys I’m attracted to?”
“Draco,” Harry said, pained and broken. He wanted to kiss Draco so badly. Draco’s eyelids fluttered, eyelashes brushing against his cheeks. Harry inched even closer.
Draco sighs, adjusting his tie in the mirror, a dusky silver the same color as his eyes at night. “What about this do you not understand, Pansy?”
Harry's eyes flash. “Don’t forget I was the one who got betrayed.” Draco feels a surge of anger he’s long kept at bay choke his throat, the injustice of it all like an iron fist.
Harry stayed silent, watching Draco and Pansy share a look before cautiously maneuvering between tables and chairs, Blaise trailing behind.
He sees him turning the corner up ahead, and Harry all but sprints after him. Draco turns his head, sees Harry, and scowls, increasing his pace before slipping into a boy’s bathroom. Harry holds back right at the entrance, remembering the last time he followed Draco into a bathroom.
Harry turns around, his shoulders tense, blinking away tears. The worst part is that he doesn’t feel conflicted. He doesn’t have a doubt what he is going to do. He just feels ashamed that he already knows.
“Ginny.”
She always hated it, and suspects Harry does too. Or maybe he doesn’t care enough to hate it, though Ginny prefers not to think of him like that. Like he’s a monster.
Hermione laughs, unexpectedly. She covers her mouth quickly, then nods, trying to compose herself. “Right, naturally.”
“I wanted to see you,” Harry says, as if it’s that simple. Oh how Draco wished everything could be just that simple. But he’s learned that lesson the hard way.
Draco stifles a gasp. “The furnace. It’s gone.”
“He’s depressed,” Ron says bluntly.
“Draco,” Harry says as a greeting, “right this way.” He steps back to let Draco through into the foyer, which really is the living room, with a nondescript white couch in front of a sleek TV against the wall.
“I find forgiveness in this instance as quite worse than forgetting,” Miss Weasley says carelessly, though it is only to hide her true sorrow. “If the Headmistress asked me, I would rather pretend nothing happened than acknowledge it.”
Pansy Parkinson approaches them from a circle of Slytherins standing in the middle of the room. She hugs Hermione, and they share a mischievous look which goes unnoticed by the two boys.
“Ginny—”
* * *
Pansy pretends to examine her nails, a freshly painted and sharpened black. “Oh, she just wondered if I knew if you and Harry were ever
She kicks up her feet onto the table as she leans back in her chair, and it all hits her in one fell swoop, this realization, Luna’s smile, her pulse a distant soundtrack to the scene unfolding at hand. Girls…
The first to host was Gryffindor, and it followed the old routine of Harry’s later years at Hogwarts, much to the fascination and disappointment of the other Houses. They could not believe Gryffindor, bold, courageous Gryffindor, would not risk more than a shaky confession of a crush.
“Things are different now.”
“Hello boys.”
“And...I think it might have something to do with Draco.”
* * *
Harry had left the room as quickly as possible and didn’t stop walking until he reached the outside. The green grass and sparkling lake were the only parts of the grounds that truly calmed him anymore.
“―dull is the word I’d have chosen―”
“Well when you put it like that it sounds like we do,” Draco says, but carelessly, as he sits on a bar stool. Harry has always envied how dismissive Draco is about other people’s opinions.
Draco recalls Pansy’s warning with those same words.
“First, let us finish our schooling,” Harry says dryly, the overwhelmingly lovesickness of his friends bringing him out of his reverie, and they walk together through the platform wall, with Miss Weasley and Mr and Mrs Arthur Weasley behind them.
Mr Weasley nods his head, eyes sad, lingering on Harry's scar. “I’m afraid it does.”
“About what?” Harry asks innocently, taking the cup, but he already knows the answer before Hermione gives it with a roll of her eyes.
He knows Harry will talk to Pansy, will try to reach out to her and reel her back in, save her, like he has always done with everyone he meets.
Suddenly a crash resounds throughout the party, and Filch comes in carrying none other than Draco Malfoy by the collar of his cloak, who cuts his captor a filthy look that makes Harry almost laugh despite the worry blossoming his stomach.
Harry finds Draco’s cock with one hand, between Draco’s body and the mattress, sliding against his palm. Draco’s body shudders, easing open even more, so that Harry falls in deeper, groaning, and then Draco tightens, spasming around Harry, and Harry calls out his name, riding his pleasure out, feeling Draco pulse in his hand the next moment, so that they grow still together, breathing heavily.
Harry recalls Hogwarts like a dream of another life, hazy and slow like an old Wizard photograph, the picture clouded with wear and exposure, the movement sluggish as if underwater. He remembers even before Hogwarts was his school, when it was his home first. Dumbledore had decided he was old enough to leave that cottage deep in the woods, the safehouse that always felt like a prison, that Hogwarts would be safe enough from then on. Harry has only vague memories of that time wandering the castle alone at night, sneaking into the kitchens where Lucy would give him a cup of steaming hot chocolate, climbing his way up to the Astronomy Tower to look out over the vast lake glimmering under the moonlight, cupped in the palm of the greenest valley he had ever seen.
“It’s not like that.”
“I was wondering though…” Hermione begins. “Is Pansy seeing anyone?”
“Obviously,” Draco replies, his voice dripping with disdain, and Harry almost smiles. “But why? Come to turn me in?”
Ron rolls his eyes. “Well, I know you have an idea what’s going on, but if you can’t tell me yet, that’s alright. Now, what’s in the memory and why is it important?”
“And Astronomy listed as a core class?” Harry asks. “That is very strange indeed.”
Words have become impossible. Harry cannot think, only feel. He feels Draco’s chest rise and fall beneath his own, radiating warmth. A slight jerk of his shoulders, his eyelashes fluttering, the swallow in his throat, they all jump out at him at once, overwhelming his senses.
“You would make a mighty Chaser,” Ginny says.
“That’s not fair,” Draco says in a choked voice. “My family—they’ll die—I have to!”
“I am sure she will let you,” Harry says impatiently. “That is not the question. The question is what Mr Weasley and I must choose.”
“Why not?” Draco asks angrily. “I know you want to.”
“And if someone recognizes it as yours?” Draco asked sharply. Harry was reminded of that night in the Slytherin dorms, all those years ago, the
Then she returns to her room, and waits for Harry and Draco to sleep. She packs as quietly as she can, knowing that if Draco—or God forbid Harry—hears her too soon, he will try and stop her, and he will win, and she will never leave, trapped by her guilt and their love and their lack of that deeper love, ultimately, which is the most paralyzing thing of all.
"And Ginny...?" Hermione begins.
Hermione smiles, but it’s awkward. “I’m sure.”
“That’s very kind.” Then she hesitates, her smile dropping into a frown. “I do have one more thing…”
Harry’s face stays stoic as he kisses him. Gently, so gently, a hooked finger under Draco’s chin, his lips soft and his tongue slow, and Draco’s heart beats heavily in his chest, like a stampede of centaurs tearing across the forest floor.
The button came undone. Then the zipper. Things got faster after that. They found themselves tangled on the floor of the dark room in an urgency Draco willingly lost himself in.
“Don’t,” Draco warns. “Don’t say things like that.”
He knew Harry was attracted to women, but for some reason, this new development did not scare him, did not even excite a drop of jealousy. He even liked to watch Harry watching Pansy, and felt a thrill when Pansy saw that Harry was watching, smiled at Draco who she knew had seen this, and accidentally let her robe fall open just enough while Harry was in the middle of speaking, so that he stammered, and looked down, and mentioned that her robe had come undone, and Pansy would act surprised, and Draco would smirk, and then she would refasten her robe.
Harry smiles, and it’s disarming in its subtle arrogance, that glint to the edge of a sword that tells you this person will unravel you and that they know it too.
Harry makes an irritated movement with his body, as if physically repelled by his presence, but Draco persists, shoving Harry with more force, until Harry is compelled to retaliate, grabbing Draco’s arm and pushing him, breathing heavily. He tries to shove him away for good but Draco keeps a hold of his arms, then drags Harry on top as if to bait him into fighting, which was a good instinct, because Harry is well pissed off by now and wrestles Draco against the couch until he has his wrists pinned on either side.
“You didn’t answer my question,” Harry says. He points to the velvet box that looks like some type of gift. Something about it feels off though, when Harry looks at it, like a sick feeling pooling in his stomach. “And what’s in that box?”
The entire compartment goes silent, even Weasley and Miss Granger stop their bickering and everyone besides Longbottom looks at Miss Lovegood and Harry apprehensively. Harry wonders if Miss Lovegood knows about his uncontrollable magic. Would he fall to disgrace so soon? The thought makes him tremble.
“I’ll see you soon, Draco.”
Again, boooring.
“Not exactly.” Harry sighs, scratching at his chin. “I kept trying to figure it out. He never wanted to tell me, which I didn't understand until later. But one day I caught him going into the Room of Requirement. He showed me the Vanishing Cabinet and told me he was trying to fix it.”
Harry doesn’t answer, because they both already know the answer. Ginny lets Harry rest his head against hers, and they stand like that in the kitchen for a long time.
“Promise me,” Harry says, later, “that we will never change.”
“You’re absolutely love sick, Draco,” Pansy says, watching Draco smiling to himself, blushing at what must be not so innocent thoughts about a certain Chosen One. “It’s disgusting.”
Harry sits up and hovers over Ginny, pressing his lips on hers ever so gently, before kissing a path down her neck, between her breasts, right above her hips bones, and with his hands he spreads her legs apart.
“But who are we to say what should be easy or not, right?” Harry says, his voice straining in a foreign attempt at lightness. He hastily kisses Draco’s cheek, and Draco turns his head and kisses him on the lips, fully, solidly, without hesitation.
He doesn’t think at all. A hex slices across his cheek but the sting fades as the incantation rises to the tip of his tongue.
“As if anyone wants me here anyway,” Malfoy said, but dropped the cigarette and crushed it with the heel of his boot.
As she is poised over Harry’s face, she feels his breath against her cunt before his tongue slips inside her, and she shivers. She does not understand, cannot comprehend, how he takes her in his mouth so innocently, so quietly, as if it were the only thing he had wanted to do right now.
“Well,” Weasley says, hesitantly, “she died before she had the chance to recover it. Though I am sure if she had lived, her magic would have been restored eventually.”
While Harry takes her love, Luna strengthens it.
Harry doesn’t drink it until he’s under the covers, and from one blink to the next, he falls into a deep sleep.
His words hurt Harry enough to stop walking, leaning against a nearby wall, but he finds the pain welcome, almost necessary, like taking a cold shower in the morning is both excruciating and yet the only way to wake up.
Looking at Harry in so much pain and knowing he’s part of it, that his memories of Draco will always be tinged by darkness and death, make Draco wish he could comfort him, make it right, kiss him until Harry can’t remember why he’d ever hated the sight of him.
Perhaps this is the final hurrah, the grand finale, of a long, twisted, painful, but necessary tie that must be cut off for both of them to fully heal and move on, whether they wish to or not.
It is actually a very crucial and vulnerable time in the making of this particular potion, though, and only after this waiting period will Draco know if the potion is correct and he can continue on or if he needs to start over. Usually, he would be a nervous wreck, lingering around the cauldron, waking up from petty, repeated nightmares of seeing the potion destroyed, splattered all on the floor, or simply gone.
“Oh yeah? It sure doesn’t look like it! You look as if your head’s about to explode, and that’s putting it lightly! Could it be that time of month?”
“Don’t push me away, Harry,” Ginny says in a low voice. “I have given
“Oh yes, Pansy, all this time they were dueling...with their wands,” Ron says between hiccups of laughter. He rolls onto the floor, nearly in tears.
Harry didn’t ask when he would see Draco next. Somehow, this hurt more than everything else.
“No.” Harry stares at the seat where Draco was sitting moments before, the unfinished plate of blueberry pie the only reminder that he was even there. He hears the swoosh of the Floo, and then Hermione storms inside.
“Well said, Draco,” Hermione says, smiling and looking at Harry earnestly as if to say,
“And you’re just as clueless.” Pansy kisses him on the cheek, then returns to her catlike pose on the couch, looking as effortless as ever. “Boys like Potter don’t usually take no as an answer, Draco. And that’s what you told him.”
He thinks of Draco, the only person on earth to see every dark and blackened piece of his soul and take his hand and kiss it. To look in his eyes and brave the monster lurking within, the monster he feels slithering under his skin, rippling its shiny scales.
“Why ever did you not?” Weasley asks, lightly mocking.
Maybe all along Draco has been worried that other people would find out and they would hate him for loving Harry, and for Harry loving him. But maybe all along Draco should have been worried about
But he had stayed, he had listened, and he had loved her anyway—on one condition.
Ginny stares at her, at the long blonde hair, the milky white skin, the trinkets dangling in her hair and hanging heavily from her necklace, the round eyes that are blue blue blue right on through, like a pool of water you can see straight to the bottom.
He raises an eyebrow. “And?”
“I’m not joking,” Harry says seriously.
“You’re right. It would be impossible for
He hears Ron sink into bed, the springs creaking. A few minutes later and snores erupt in the silence. Harry smiles briefly to himself, before swinging his legs over the side of the bed and leaving the dormitory, his bare feet padding softly on the warm wood.
“Can I?” Harry asks, hooking a finger under the waistband of Draco’s briefs. Draco nods wordlessly, his mouth going dry.
“But you never even thought about it?”
“Milk?” Ron asks, just to break the silence. Harry shakes his head.
“I would hope so.” Harry smirks. “We’d still hate each other, I’m sure.”
It was rougher than the first, and deeper. Harry crowded him against the wall, so deliciously unapologetic. Strong hands held his hips in place, before they slid around the waistband of his jeans.
Hermione shoots Harry an angry look. Ron has finally caught on, and glances at Harry curiously, and perhaps more shrewdly than Harry gives him credit. He does not reproach Harry, instead looking at Draco, carefully gauging his reaction.
“But at Borgin and Burkes—”
When Draco looked into Harry’s eyes in the darkness of the alcove that night, Snape’s footsteps like a ticking clock counting down in the background, they seemed like a pair of glittering emerald stones, no, like a slithering snake with shiny scales ready to pounce, and Draco realized then that he was always going to agree with Harry.
Of course, she still aces all her exams.
She nods with a look of motherly affection, then steps aside. Harry hesitates for one moment. He looks across the platform, but it is empty. Malfoy must already be on the train.
“Oh,” Harry says, recognition dawning on his face. “Yes. Right. Ginny and Dean are dating. That’s brilliant.”
Harry pounces immediately when Draco slips off his briefs, sitting back for just a brief moment completely naked, his skin cold and prickling, and Harry staring, just staring, like he had never seen anyone else, then jump-starting into motion.
The comment surprises Hermione, and she stops ruffling through the papers to look at Draco. She doesn’t quite know what to say. Has the thought passed her mind? Well, yes. But to actually
“Harry—” Hermione begins, but cuts off when Harry goes after Malfoy, slamming the door behind him.
It wouldn’t be the first time, now would it?”
“Please, sir,” Harry interjects with a charming smile that Hermione knows first hand is hard to resist. Slughorn hesitates, but Hermione knows he will cave. “It will only take a minute.”
Hermione taps his arm anxiously, looking behind at a trailing, somewhat confused Cormac McLaggen. “God, he’s awful.”
“Yes.”
Then he says in a quiet voice void of feeling, “Like I’m dying inside.”
That’s just it, though. He can live without him, and yet, he still went back, still took the risk, still hoped beyond hope. And the shame of that hope curdles in his stomach as the days drag on without him. How stupid could he be? How pathetic? How lonely? How truly insecure?
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco asks, sounding tired and pinched. He looks well, though, his pale skin smooth and his hair combed, falling just below his angular cheekbones. The white dress shirt only pronounces the angry blush blooming across his face.
He tries to slow down, to make love to him, but his pulse stutters, his legs tense, and he can’t control himself anymore, like running downhill, the pace quickening without meaning to, gasping for breath as they fuck, Harry’s hand grasping Draco’s hair and pulling so that he hears Draco moan.
Harry nearly sighs in relief. Miss Granger looks at him sharply, as if to say this will be the consequence of not getting a new wand. He ignores her look, and instead bows his head to Miss Lovegood.
Draco pulls away, searching Harry’s eyes, but they are dark in the night, and Harry averts his gaze. “But that’s ridiculous. You’re
* * *
“Well you don’t have a choice!” Draco shouts back. “We don’t always have a choice!”
“I always thought I would teach here, you know,” Harry says, almost wistfully, skillfully avoiding Draco’s question, as if he never asked it at all. “Some day.”
Mrs Malfoy smiles, but it is pained. They both know if it was not for Harry, she and Malfoy would serve time in Azkaban along with her husband. “The truth is a very valuable thing.”
* * *
Harry stares at her with his usual intensity, his green eyes bright, reflecting tendrils of fire. With gentle fingers he reaches out and tucks a loose strand of red hair behind her ear.
“Coming?” Draco would ask as he fixed his tie at the door. Harry says yes every time, and every time Draco sighs, dramatically waiting for Harry to reach the door of the room, before he fiddles with the front of Harry’s jumper, redoing his tie.
wanted Malfoy there, but if it sounded bad in his head, it would sound worse out loud.
“You won’t need to.” Draco takes Harry’s arms and pulls him up, and they scoot back until Draco falls onto his back, dragging Harry down on top of him until they are kissing again, building a rhythm like a repeated name, like casting a spell over and over and over again.
“But I don’t understand, darling,” Pansy says in her posh accent, lounging by the fireplace in black knee high stockings and an oversize green sweater that spells SLYTHERIN in silver thread. If she pinned her short, glossy black hair with green snake clips, she’d look just as she did in school.
“Because of Draco,” Harry repeats reluctantly, his head hung as if in shame. “I’m a horrible person.” It takes a few moments for Hermione to realize the slight shaking of his shoulders is because he’s trying to hold back sobs.
Down, down, down...He has never felt so weightless.
That’s when he smelled it. Sharp and intense and unmistakable, reminding him of busy London streets. He followed the scent, perplexed and curious, around past the greenhouse and behind a stone archway.
At first Harry couldn’t bear potions sitting next to the insufferable wanker, but though slow Harry may be, eventually even he realized that Draco’s sharp taunts and barbs were actually advice in disguise. When Harry started following the little pieces of instruction Draco spat at him, his marks vastly improved.
Harry watches Draco silently, their hands linked loosely between them on the floor. The only sound that can be heard is the crackling of flames from the kitchen furnace, which Harry lit when the room got impossibly cold.
Pansy’s very good at seeing the bottom, and for good reason; the only thing worse than a broken heart is broken trust. Her solution? Never trust anyone.
“Really? And pray, tell me who this someone might be?” Pansy asks.
“Honestly, I’m not very interested in politics,” Harry finally says, which at least isn’t a lie. The man looks startled, but not upset.
“You’ve got to be more careful, Draco,” Pansy says in a low voice. Draco wrenches his eyes away from Harry when he finally turns a corner and out of view, brows furrowing as Pansy’s warning registers.
Draco, on the other hand, bites his lip frequently while casting glances to the kitchen, only stopping when Pansy pinches his arm. He looks generally put out, and when Hermione wanders over to the pair of them, she notices that Pansy stands ramrod straight, anxiously trying to keep Draco engaged. But it’s no use; he can barely string a coherent sentence without losing his train of thought when someone enters or leaves the kitchen, which renders him essentially unable to carry a conversation.
Draco shakes his head. “You don’t know me, Harry.”
“No.”
“Well, children, here we are,” Mrs Weasley says with a nervous smile, her arm tightly linked with her daughter’s as if she might not let go. She has worried herself sick these past few days making sure each of them was all packed and ready to return to Hogwarts. Although she did not voice her concerns specifically, Harry suspects that she worries the castle will only bring back horrible memories.
“May I?”
Draco ran a hand down his torso, looking down with a frown. “Because I can.”
Draco’s face turns very serious. He turns around, kneeling on the couch, which Harry mimics so they are eye-level. Then Draco takes Harry’s hand and guides it to his chest.
No, no it’s not.
After Harry left in the morning, Draco can hear Pansy crying in the room across the hall. He tiptoes towards the door, then opens it. She is curled on her bed, her shoulders shaking.
“Draco, Draco, Draco…” Harry’s voice is more of a groan against his lips, his arms tight around Draco’s body, almost holding his entire weight up.
Harry starts. “You are?”
He glanced up, surprised, and found Draco staring at him with wide eyes. Before he knew what he was doing, Harry jerked his head towards the door, and Draco hesitated, before nodding. They both got up, pushing their chairs back.
He doesn’t like to think of what he would have done if Ginny wasn’t there to hold him at night, to kiss him with her sweet lips and melt away the nightmares.
Hermione's cheeks flush at his investment in her thoughts. Merlin, it never gets old. “A Christmas party, last year. Ginny and I, we were talking about my pregnancy. I think we broke the news to family at the party.” Hermione pours the memory into the Pensive, watching the blue tendrils curl in the silvery white liquid. “What he told you, Harry, that is, about finding another world...it reminded me of this conversation.”
Glad to have a solid conversation topic, Ron rambles a rough summary of Harry’s thoughts on dating Ginny, concluding with, “In other words, he said no.”
“The damage this potion will do is permanent, Harry. And you won’t be the same. You won’t be
“Help me,” Hermione squeals, before running off, leaving Harry with Cormac for what feels like the hundredth time, who shakes his head with a grin.
“You said you would have been a teacher, once,” Draco says quietly.
“But you’re not dead, Harry,” Ron says quietly. “You’re alive.”
,” Ginny quotes. “That’s what Luna always says.”
He grins. “Sleeping.”
Harry stands nervously before the door. His scarf tickles his neck uncomfortably. He feels flushed, hot, despite the winter chill creeping past his coat.
Draco stares at Harry speechless, looking out into the night, a gleam in his eyes which he hides with an easygoing smile, containing none of the darkness from just moments ago.
Draco hides his surprise. “Which potion would that be,
The hand pushes Harry’s shirt up slowly, inch by inch. Harry doesn’t stop him. Draco looks at him all the while with an intensity that Harry can hardly bear. His body has frozen under Draco’s touch. He no longer moves of his own accord.
They chose each other. And that meant everything.
“Anything on your mind?”
She remembers that secret love he’s harboring, but doesn’t dare bring it up. Instead, she asks if he’s sleeping well. He narrows his eyes at her.
“Don’t.” He glares at her. “And it’s not that, not really...I keep having this dream. Over and over again. It’s not really a nightmare, exactly. But I die, each time, falling off the top of the Astronomy Tower.”
But Ginny has something to do first before she can join her. She takes a cab to the familiar apartment complex, not wishing to Apparate after such a long trip.
“A dream? That can’t be good.”
The dormitory is dark at this hour, a pale shine of moonlight filtering through a small window, the only illumination that saves Ginny from having to carefully cast a Lumos and risk getting caught.
“That is interesting,” Miss Granger continues as if she had not heard Weasley. “The other eight classes which are not highly selective are considered true electives. They are taught by visiting Professors or are classes with normally low numbers, like Alchemy. I have always wanted to take Alchemy.” She looks wistful.
Harry hears crying, and his decision is made.
“Yes.”
“That’s a dangerous game, Draco,” Harry grits out through clenched teeth. “I wouldn’t play, if I were you.”
“Hello Harry,” she says, looking at him carefully. She frowns as if reading his thoughts. “You’ve been with Granger, haven’t you?”
The words hit Draco’s gut like a punch, and he has to bite his lip to keep from crying.
But he doesn’t have a choice. Or at least, as he looks down at his Dark Mark that is almost visible beneath his thin cotton pajamas, he made the choice a long time ago.
Luna looks at him with a far too knowing look. “But you don’t laugh, do you?”
“Sleeping.” She eyes him, smirking, her right hand falling on the opening of her robe and revealing just enough to confirm that she has nothing underneath.
“What did Voldemort—” but Harry doesn’t get to finish his question.
She gives him a sidelong glance. “Where’s Draco?”
But of course, Draco doesn’t want this potion to turn out well. He always secretly wishes for something to go terribly wrong, for his cauldron to topple in the night, or better yet, for Harry himself to mess it up somehow, giving Draco an excuse to bring an end to this whole ordeal.
“—I only want to help, but you keep pushing me away! How else was I going to help you if I didn’t find out what you needed help with?”
But Draco still loves every moment of it, the burning pleasure, the way Harry says his name, eyes shut tight, burying his face in Draco’s neck, lying still, so still, after they finish, as if afraid any slight movement will make it all a dream.
Draco just wishes he knew how it ends.
“So you don’t want to see me,” Draco says slowly, his mind feeling twisted and turned like it always does around Harry and his twisted and turned words, “because you actually do want to see me.”
“She’s mental,” Harry says.
“Harry, we need to talk to you,” she says firmly, not bothering to sound caring as she has in the past. “It’s important.”
Draco looks at him sideways, his shoulders tense at the proximity of his boyhood rival. “I suppose. Never really thought about it.”
Harry tosses in bed. He can’t really sleep, though this isn’t a rare occurrence. Sleep has never come easily to Harry. Probably a product of his parent’s death before he could say their names, and perhaps an evil sorcerer dead set on killing him doesn’t help either.
“I don’t need help,” Harry mumbles.
The official heartbreaker of Slytherin and possibly the entire history of Hogwarts. And Pansy was obviously in love with him.
Harry goes very still. “What do you mean?”
Hermione looks surprised but nods, returning to the dressing room. Pansy can barely stand the wait, and she reprimands herself for getting invested. She impatiently examines her nails—a dark green for obvious reasons—though her heart’s not in it.
Draco heard him say, "Nothing happened. Obviously."
“She’s great,” Ginny says warmly. “But how are you? Can’t remember the last time you came here to smoke. Thought you quit.”
“And what does the Minister mean by
“I promise,” he murmurs.
Blaise laughs. “And speaking of Weasleys, the youngest one, Ginevra. She’s quite something, isn’t she? Fit and sassy, the perfect combination. Gets around too, from what I’ve heard.” Pansy shoves his arm.
At the end of the feast, the Prefects lead each house to their dormitories. Many of the Gryffindors exchange grim looks as their Prefect leads them in the direction of the castle grounds instead of with the Ravenclaws to the towers.
“You better be joking,” Draco says, narrowing his eyes.
* * *
“Potter,” Draco says. “You’re late.”
“Yes,” Harry says, “I remember.” He remembers the cold wind on the Astronomy Tower that night, the same cold wind he feels on his face in the dreams where he falls over the edge.
“This is not the only way,” Pansy pleads. “Just come here.”
Their lives are in limbo, like this moment. A fruit hanging, swollen, on a branch, which must drop at any moment. Harry wants to stay in this space forever, without changing. He wants Draco’s face to remain still, on his pillow, like a statue, not even a twitch of his lips, or slight turn of his head. Any movement would ruin the moment forever.
“I should go,” Harry says. Hermione starts to protest, getting up, and then Draco stands up solemnly.
“I can’t,” Harry says dumbly.
Draco brightens at this. “That’s brilliant, Pansy. Good publicity, and you’ve always fancied her. You must have been over the moon yourself.”
“You could have anyone,” Draco says, almost an exhale, lowering his face against the crook of Harry’s neck as if to hide his face, right alongside the hem of his robes. Harry can feel his breath soft and hot against his skin. He can’t remember why he ever thought the room was cold. “So why me?”
Hermione relents, putting away the Pensive and following Ron back to the bedroom. She thinks she understands, now, but she’s still not certain, and in something like this she would have to be absolutely certain.
If Harry were Weasley, he would have proposed several months ago. Weasley had tried to court Miss Granger last year, but what with the war and the hunt for Horcruxes, love-making was not the top priority. At the final battle, afraid that he or she may die before the day ended, Weasely had professed his undying love and Miss Granger returned his feelings with the same enthusiasm. However, with the aftermath of the war, with Mr Fred Weasley’s death and the death of many others, nothing came about from such a grand profession, and they returned much to the same place they had always been, bickering and staring at each other longingly when they believe the other unawares.
“Draco?” A familiar drawling voice calls out from behind his curtains. Harry silently pulls the Cloak over himself. Draco can almost taste his heartbeat in his throat.
Hermione laughs. “Well, we all have those days! Or had them, at least, in some way.” She suddenly recalls the passionate nights with Ron before they got married, when they took on the Ministry together by force, a few years after the war, wounds still fresh, but love still bright and shiny, tumbling from bars drunk and giggling into beds and kissing, kissing, kissing without breathing until their lips were sore...
Despite the certainty that no one can see her, standing up in the front of the classroom twists her stomach. Hermione pushes the discomfort away and refocuses on the memory at hand.
Draco looks torn between wanting to confide in Hermione and also wanting to keep it to himself. Something tingles Hermione’s memories, like a feather brushing against her neck, and she decides to press just a little more.
“Because I’m not the enemy anymore? I’m not forbidden?” Draco suggests harshly, hugging himself tightly. Harry turns away, unable to look at him.
Hermione shushes him sternly, and he clamps a hand over his mouth. With some luck Rose can’t hear him all the way up in the attic. “Yes, he told me he was in love with someone he couldn’t have, but refused to tell me who. But I’m so close to figuring it out. I just need to know for sure.”
Harry smirks. “That’s exactly why I came in.”
Harry cannot find the words to answer, and so he does not speak. He searches Draco’s face, trying to understand where such a question would come from, what he expected from Harry. Hadn’t they agreed this could be the only way?
Hermione sighs. They have had this conversation many times in many different ways.
“I should go to bed,” Harry says, bland in its evasiveness, before getting up and leaving Ron and Hermione alone.
Sweet and sharp, like the wine. Harry slides an arm around Draco’s waist, a strong hand reaching behind and squeezing. A gasp from Draco only encourages Harry more, and dazedly, his pulse spiking, thudding in his brain right behind the temple, his hips aching to move, to arch against his solid, lean-muscled body, Draco melts into Harry’s arms.
* * *
Harry looks up from his letter, distracted. “Oh me? Yes, I have been accepted.”
” He walks forward, captivating Draco with his stare alone, that primal intensity that slithers underneath his skin. Draco can’t look away.
Harry’s face had been turned away from Ginny from where she was hidden, but Draco’s expression said enough. She knew that look, like staring at a brilliant star dying before your eyes, knowing nothing you could do would save it, but wanting to anyway.
“Yes, Harry,” he says in his familiar gravelly voice. He peers at Harry over his spectacles. “Are you quite alright?”
Harry stares at her, and says nothing. He doesn’t have to; she knows exactly what he was doing. She prays that he will come clean.
* * *
“Friends?” Harry’s mouth quirks.
* * *
* * *
“Oh, he’s reading that bloody book again,” Hermione mutters. Harry looks up from his book to see Hermione narrowing her eyes at him.
He glances at her distractedly, then looks out the window above the sink, into the dark of the night as if he can see something there that she can’t. Maybe he can.
“You know what I mean. I want to go back to what we were, without the…”
Harry shrugs.
“She has a lovely name, don’t you think?” Luna asks.
At this Harry turns around, walking slowly but deliberately down the shop to a nearby shelf, stopping in front of the section of temporary mind altering potions. His hand reaches out, but does not touch, only hovering over one vial containing a smooth, violet liquid Draco knows only too well.
* * *
“And what does that make you?”
“Wonder what?”
Hermione glances at his black shirt which clings to his skin, and the dark jeans and slightly heeled boots. She raises an eyebrow. “A fun night?”
“Ah.” Harry pours himself some more. “Leaving tonight, then.”
A clamor of wood screeching on stone whips Hermione’s attention over to Draco, who’s standing up, his body rigid and tense. She looks over quickly at Harry, but while he has gone very still, his expression remains closed off.
“I used a simple concealment charm,” Draco says bitterly. “I knew if you ever found out that…”
“Lucy, I can’t.”
“You just need time, Draco, to move on and find someone—”
“I see.”
For the last month or so they had stolen as many moments, day or night, together, as they could, making up for lost time. Ten whole years of it. They never reached the same comfort as in school, where their innocence and eagerness colored their passion, but Draco was there in his arms, warm and pliant and real, his smell on the pillows a mark he could not fabricate even in his wildest, drunkest dreams.
“I know you didn’t want to raise me. You never wanted children.” Harry tears his eyes away from the coiling tendrils of the past and looks at Dumbledore. “I was a hindrance.”
“Right.” Pansy rolls her eyes, laughing. “If it makes you feel better.”
“Do you ever wonder what we would be if I chose Slytherin?” Harry asks quietly, looking into Draco’s eyes. His eyes scan Draco’s face intently.
“I guess that’s true enough,” Ginny says, looking away from Harry’s probing gaze. “I think it would be the biggest mistake.”
“Surprise,” Hermione whispers.
“If Harry’s there, what?” Ginny demands. “It’s his apartment, did you think I was just going to waltz back in there? He knows I’m coming.”
“Ah.” Harry holds Draco tightly under one arm, and walks them away from the bar.
Was he really going to do this? His brain must not have been working properly, because he continued walking until he reached the door.
“I must wonder,” Miss Granger says in an attempt at changing subjects, “how this school year will turn out, given the circumstances.”
The door swings wide open.
He doesn’t look nervous, which only makes Harry more nervous. Harry hangs his coat and scarf by the door while Draco puts the flowers in a white vase and fills it with water. He places the vase on the dining table. Harry stands awkwardly in the middle of the apartment, hands by his sides.
But this funeral is nothing like that.
“Yes, but also abandoned, and therefore private,” Harry says, opening the heavy door and slipping through. Ginny follows with one last glance behind her.
In the dark, Harry could only feel and hear. Warm lips on his. Their legs tangling under the covers. Draco’s hands circling his wrists, keeping them still against the mattress.
“No.”
Harry doesn’t respond.
Draco wants to scream, to throw a potion vial at Harry’s face, to grab Harry’s cloak by the front and kiss him hard. The mixture of emotions results in a simmering silence that lasts for what feels like an eternity.
Harry grabs her hips and she knows she’s done for. Her head rolls back in abandon. She can barely keep herself upright, her legs shaking, then spasming, as she rocks uncontrollably against Harry’s mouth.
“But don’t you want to date someone? Call someone your own?” Harry asks, and the heat in his voice scares Ginny.
“Take off the shirt. This piece stands alone.”
When Draco saw the flash of recognition in Harry’s eyes, he knew the rejection would come. And when that Weasley boy told Draco off, he also saw the flicker of surprise and respect that briefly made itself known on Harry’s face—too fast for anyone less shrewd than Draco—and he looked at Ron as if he were someone totally different, before schooling his features into a slight disdain towards Draco.
“Harry—” Dumbledore begins, but Harry cuts him off.
“Yes,” Harry says, his voice hoarse.
“Please, Mr Weasely, at least look inside. The password is ‘unity.’”
Draco holds his breath, then releases it when the door closes behind him. He reaches out his hand but it falls through empty air.
“I can’t lose him again,” Draco says, his voice breaking, but she can see in his eyes the fissures of doubt, the pain of love and shame intertwining like a web, an intricate trap, each strand alone a paper cut, but all at once a deep, deep scar. “I would rather have Harry in some way than not at all.”
“Look!” he exclaims urgently, continuing to point. “Just look.”
A silence ensues in which the only thing Draco can hear is the pounding of his heart.
Up and up and up. Harry can’t see anything well, going off sound and instinct alone. Malfoy pauses occasionally, most likely to look around, and Harry freezes, hoping the rustle of his Cloak isn’t as loud as it seems.
“Now who’s arrogant,” Draco mutters, but he has to hide a smile in another sip of wine.
“Harry won’t be happy about that,” Ginny says, trying to calm her racing pulse. She feels like she just executed a dangerous dive to shake off a pair of Chasers. Her mind keeps pushing away memories of dark hallways, soft voices, and the utter shock of secrecy when there was already such delicate trust.
* * *
“Oh I know,” Hermione says, to which Ron smirks. “Now pay attention.”
Probably not. Maybe. It doesn’t really matter. She woke up the same way regardless, from a light, restless sleep, walking downstairs earlier than the boys to make coffee and smoke a cig on the balcony and watch the morning sun wake the rest of this damned city.
Harry half smiles, and Draco has to hide his own, as it was a sort of silly thing to say; the kitchen could be seen from the door, with pristine white cupboards and shiny marble counter tops. They walk over together, Harry sweeping his arm wide in a mocking gesture of reveal when they reach the tiled floor.
Miss Weasley notices as well, and looks down, annoyed, her lips pursed. Although Harry once thought of courting Miss Weasley, the sentiment passed as quickly as it came when they both realized there was no real feeling attached to their mutual affection. It was brotherly and sisterly love, and that is all. Unfortunately, her brother still wishes for his sister and closest friend to unite their families and make Harry a true brother to himself.
“It’s not something I wish to tell people,” Draco mutters.
Suddenly the memory rushes away in a loud blur like a wave crashing over their heads, and they rise together with a gasp as if they had been holding their breaths. Ron stares at Hermione, stunned.
“What kind of a duel?” Ron asks with a smirk.
. Please send a reply signed by all eligible Eighth Year students under your care to indicate their understanding and acceptance of said terms. Sincerely, Minister Shacklebolt.’”
“Pansy, would you get more wine from the kitchen?” Draco asked in a drawl which he used when he wanted someone to pamper him.
No, he could not go back and teach at Hogwarts, his first and last home, the place of his beginning and his end.
” Harry says with a chilly smile, and Draco’s head snaps up and he looks at Harry, startled and resentful. “What do you think?”
“Oh, of course, yes.” Slughorn nods vigorously. “The Sad Nightingale works on memory. You need only drink it once, and all the pain and suffering from your life disappears.”
Interesting. Illegal Potions was only a chapter in their textbook, hardly relevant at all, considering they were illegal. Hermione scans their faces for reactions.
“I mean,” Harry says, slowly, forcing himself to push the words out. “I thought I was only a friend.”
“No need to get defensive,” Harry says with a smirk, caressing the binding of the book and looking at Draco through his lashes. “I was only wondering what you were interested in.”
"Blaise," Pansy called out, running to hug him. Blaise smiled into the hug, but Draco thought he looked tense with Pansy's arms around him.
Ron sighs, and leans forward, glancing around the common room to make sure neither Hermione nor Ginny herself were anywhere they could hear him. “But you’re seeing each other, right? Why can’t you just date her?”
Hermione raises an amused brow. “Must be a Slytherin trait.”
“No,” Hermione says curtly. “It’s about Draco Malfoy.”
“I-I don’t mean to presume…” Hermione trails off, unsure how to approach this mechanical, cold profession of love that feels more business-like than romantic.
Harry doesn’t look back.
Then his presence was gone. The door opened and Harry walked out.
Harry desperately tries to stop the spell, shouting
“Come on, Harry, let’s just go,” Hermione says, casting one last resentful look at Ron before grabbing Harry’s sleeve and dragging him away.
“...the glory...don’t you?”
She knew then that Draco and Harry had crashed and burned, finally, a collision of light and dark, day and night, pale cheeks and ink black curls, just like she knew they would.
Parkinson grins. “Champagne shackles.”
Ron just doesn’t understand him sometimes. Though Ron is Harry’s best friend, some days it feels like they are absolute strangers. Harry mutters an excuse about getting sleep and slips away quietly, up to the dorms. Ron looks after him until the door of the stairwell closes behind Harry’s unruly brown hair.
“I would quite like that, Mr Weasley,” Harry says, now unable to contain a grin.
“What are you suggesting, Hermione?” Pansy asks sharply.
Another pause. “Good night, Potter.”
Together they rush back up the tunnel and out into the hallways, breathing harshly and never slowing down until they come back to the doors of the Great Hall, hiding in a dark alcove narrow enough that it could have been the archway of a door, Draco’s back against the wall and their chests pressed up against each other. Harry can feel Draco’s breath in the scarce space between them.
Why does he feel angry? Harry turns around, breathing hard, trying to calm down the rage bubbling in his chest, the build up to an explosion. This is not a choice. He should not have to choose between the two people he loves most in this world.
Draco knew the door opened when the voices and laughter outside briefly raised, before the door clicked shut and the world outside became muffled again. The presence of another living, breathing person in the room made Draco's skin prickle. He heard their breath, the slight movement of their limbs, the natural heat off their skin.
He had thought once, that perhaps, but no.
Then Draco came back into his life, a willing miracle that lasted as brief as it did ten years before. A scar on his heart that never truly heals because he keeps ripping it back open again.
* * *
“I thought you said we were going to visit Hagrid today?” Hermione asks coldly. Lavender makes a noise beside him, but he hardly notices.
“Why did you come back, then?” Hermione asks.
“It was stupid.”
But the only choice he’s ever made was to love Draco, and it burned all he loved to the ground. Why should he trust himself to make that choice again?
“But Ronny…” Lavender whispers, though Hermione still hears it and huffs, turning away. While Ron can confidently say he’s upset with Hermione for constantly finding fault in him when he’s done nothing wrong, he still doesn’t understand the cause for her harsh criticism.
Since that conversation, Draco noticed that Harry observed them more carefully, saw all the little things others failed to see: the way Draco touched Pansy, reverently, meaningfully, the way Pansy looked into his eyes, a faint smirk on her blood red lips, the way they spoke to each other, almost flirting, almost insulting, their minds connected on a level deeper than the water below the earth, a twin flame lit in their eyes, a pull towards each other that was almost outside of their bodies, like planets orbiting each other but never touching.
Draco turns down the corridor when he hears a noise, ever so slight, a scuffle of robes brushing the floor, that anyone less alert and suspicious would have missed. He pauses and then keeps walking.
“Well, it’s just...I heard you, one night. When I was sleeping in Dean’s bed. You got up and I heard the door open and you left. I thought maybe you went to the bathroom, but no one was there.”
“You were right,” Harry says with deadly calm. “I would have been better off.”
But if he ends it now—
“Quite gracious.”
Pansy goes still. Hermione Granger wanting to see Pansy Parkinson? It’s like all of her fantasies coming true, and also all of her worst nightmares. She jumps into motion, straightening her hair and shimmying up her slim back pencil skirt.
Regardless, Harry asks, “What if I don’t want to choose?”
Clearly Hermione’s true feelings of disdain and disgust have shown themselves when he started dating Lavender. Ron never stood a chance, and the realization of this hurt his pride more than he likes to admit.
Hermione sits down next to a Hermione ten years younger. It’s disconcerting to see how much she has aged. How much has changed, since her days at Hogwarts.
“You can look,” Draco said softly.
After making his way past the closed double doors to the Dining Hall, he finds narrow stone steps going down into darkness. He follows them swiftly, and light sconces flicker to a glow as he passes by them along the basement corridor. Only when he reaches a bright painting of a variety of fruits and breads does he stop. He reaches out and tickles the pear.
“Ron says I should date you,” Harry says, his eyes sparkling.
Everything about Luna is so different than Harry, his darkness and smolderning intensity, his agitation, his cool collectedness, his nightmares, his endless stream of sweet lies and poisonous truths. While Harry tears her world apart, Luna simply has to look at her and she steadies it.
“Miss Granger, you cannot pretend after such a long friendship as ours to presume us as prepared as yourself,” Weasley says, blushing when Miss Granger looks at him, surprised at the direct reference to their intimacy. He rarely does like to be sentimental.
“I don’t understand how you can trust him.” Harry leans back, some of that intensity dimming and hardening into a fury before he shakes his head. Ron watches him, almost fascinated, realizing once again how little he knows his best friend. “I don’t understand how you can forgive him for what he’s done.”
Pansy smiles, her body warming like she’s glowing from within. Blaise is the second person she’s told about her attraction to boys
“There, you’re getting it,” Harry says. “It’s that simple.”
“Clever way to make me wait,” Draco says sharply. His eyes, though, glitter with amusement. Harry’s lips curve into a smile.
“Thank heavens not!” Harry exclaims. “I appreciate your zeal, but please refrain from demanding it from the rest of us.”
“Well, I don’t know.” Hermione blushes. “Thank you, I suppose.”
“Your friends won’t even notice you’re gone,” Lavender whispers, kissing him with more fervor, and how could Ron say no to a girl as pretty and sweet as Lavender when she’s pleading like this?
With a deep sigh, Hermione begins to gather her things, but just then Harry jolts upright, staring at the Map in astonishment.
“I’d prefer cold hearted b—”
With her heart beating in her throat like it’s a first date and not a domestic night with her family, Hermione tiptoes down the hall, the cool air prickling her almost entirely bare skin, and quietly opens the door to their bedroom.
“Try not to be too loud,” Harry says, before he lowers his mouth down.
When she steps out, Hermione Granger is on the other side, ready to walk into the elevator. She halts when she notices Pansy, who raises an eyebrow, and steps outside. Hermione crosses her arms, almost a foot and a half shorter than her and with that same curvy figure as in school.
“If you are so curious, why don’t I show you,” Dumbledore replies, flourishing his hand towards the Pensieve.
No. He could not do it. There is too much at stake, too much to lose.
Draco shouts just as Harry breaks free of the spell, and he flies back, hitting the wall where the door used to be. He jumps back onto his feet easily, his eyes dark. He charges towards Draco again.
But now Hermione sees that there was something between them that she had overlooked. Something she had always missed, something she cannot name without the rest of the sentence, without the rest of the story.
He sighs and picks it up, then drops it into the laundry basket. Hermione raises a brow at him, before taking her own shirt off and throwing it into the basket as well.
But she remembers the weight of him in her arms, the utter dependency, and how she held him up, kissed his cheek, asked him what happened, but he just shook his head, over and over and over again, like a child, tears running freely down his face, and all he could say is
if it only exists behind closed doors, in lost rooms tucked deep in an enchanted castle. When it comes down to it, and they face the world instead of each other, will Harry still take his hand?
“That’s a lie.”
“Think about it, Hermione,” Harry says flatly. “That’s exactly why he would want to work with the Ministry—for sympathy. Then he’ll worm his way into weakening reforms and giving other Death Eaters the chance to rebel. Nothing will change, you’ll see. Not to mention his suspicious potions business.”
Tonight, however, Draco is here for a very different reason, and just thinking about it makes his heart pound and his head go light. He feels queasy, a little numb, and generally terrible.
Hermione hardly notices. “You know, I went to Pansy’s store the other day. It was just wonderful! She picked out this beautiful blue pantsuit, and these—”
The Headmistress steps up to the podium. “You may be seated.”
Harry skates his fingers down Draco’s spine, following the ridges of bone, then curving around his ass, cupping Draco from behind. He eases a finger inside him, and Draco makes a low noise in his throat. Harry dips his head and kisses him, teasing him open with his tongue and his finger, and Draco sinks into him, relaxes against him, his legs widening, trembling.
“She’s good. Our trips have been amazing because of her. I always hated traveling, you know, for the longest time. As the youngest in a big family it was awful, never any peace, always chaos. But Luna slows me down.” Ginny smiles to herself. “Makes me stop and look up at the stars.”
Harry laughs, but it chills her to the core. “I don’t think it happens soon." He looks at her with a fake curiosity. "But don’t you think it’s a strange dream?”
He thought with a damning certainty like a noose around his neck that he would rather have Harry any way he possibly could than not have him at all.
Then Slughorn turns with a large book in one hand, and addresses the class. “Today we are learning about illegal potions. Why do potions become illegal? How do they become illegal? And if we have time at the end of class I will touch upon some illegal ingredients as well and their usage.”
The elastic of his briefs was pulled down, and Harry shivered. Draco traced a finger up his inner thigh, followed by his tongue.
“Well, we had better be off to bed,” Miss Granger says. “All of us have Transfigurations at nine o’clock tomorrow, and if my inclination is correct, we will be put to work right away.”
“Sir,” Harry says, before he can stop himself.
“But don’t stand there, Hermione. Introduce me,” Harry says, and with a grimace Hermione walks back into the kitchen and Harry follows behind her.
Dumbledore calls him to his office, though he can’t imagine what for anymore. More memories? Harry knows more than he’d ever like about Tom Riddle. More detentions? Snape already gave him enough to last the rest of the year. He’s banned from Quidditch, too. But none of that matters as much as Draco, and the certainty that he will never see him the same way again. That it’s over.
“At the time,” Hermione says in a low voice, “I had thought it was about Dumbledore. But it wasn’t. That’s clear enough to me now.”
Draco will be too.
“Nothing,” Ron says, feeling suddenly exhausted. “Come on. Hagrid’s waiting.”
“Oh, well, yes, I suppose,” Hermione stutters, blushing. “You see—”
Then Draco is kissing him with that insistence and attention which Harry fell in love with. Harry loves Draco intensely, and loves to be Draco’s darling, his love, and to be adored by him, to be suffocated in his embrace, to find a home underneath all that sharpness.
“We were talking about him settling down and having kids. He said something weird, though. Got me worried.”
Harry had cleared his throat. “No, not at all.”
Pansy thinks he’s lying to himself, but Draco doesn’t care. He doesn’t care about much anymore. Except his potions, he supposes.
Still, she knows he does love them, in his own way.
“You don’t look nervous, that’s all.”
Then Harry liked Draco. Maybe he liked him from the moment Draco walked in the pub that first night he called out to him on the street, those grey eyes wary, the delicate blonde hair tousled in curly waves. It was a curious feeling, a warmth and a sharpness, like an ache in his chest.
Draco opens one eye, smirking when he sees Harry staring.
Pansy turns on Hermione. “What is your boyfriend saying?”
Harry’s dark green eyes lock with Draco’s, and it’s like Sixth Year all over again. He’s as handsome as ever, dark hair curling over his ears, his skin tan from a long summer in the sun, a shade of stubble roughing up the ever polished Chosen One.
“Oh no, no, that’s not…” Harry flushed. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
“You look dreadful,” she says.
“Is this okay?” Draco asks against his lips. He moves his other hand underneath Harry’s sweater, finding his warm skin with his cold hands, feeling like a brand of fire so hot it’s like ice. Harry involuntarily shivers, and Draco moves the hand across his stomach, which jolts with pleasure.
“What questions?”
Harry smiles fondly. This has always struck Ginny as odd; he’s always had a soft spot for Luna, even before Ginny noticed her. “How is Luna, by the way?”
Draco opens the door wider. “Of course she did. Come in.”
“Did you know,” Ginny had said the other day, smirking, “that the entire Fourth Year thinks I’m a top and you’re a bottom?”
Hermione smirks. “
But he cannot sleep.
It’s empty. He walks across, the metal platform creaking under his weight. He can see the constellations. He can see Draco, faint on the horizon.
“Well, I did want to, but then I would have to drop Care of Magical Creatures. I couldn’t bear to disappoint Professor Hagrid as we did that one time. I figured Charms was the only subject I felt comfortable missing, as I have already read the assigned textbook.”
“It’s not gone, just without a fire.”
But it was time to let go.
“There always is one with you.” She shakes her head, then kisses Harry softly on the cheek.
He reaches the door to Hermione’s office, knocks, and then comes inside.
Draco tugs on the waistband of his shorts, which causes Harry to stop breathing. He cannot manage to look, but he nods stiffly, hands trembling, while Draco unzips his shorts, pulling them down with uneven breaths.
The first thought that crosses Hermione’s mind is that he is lying, playing a prank on her, or something equally as insensitive. But her second thought is more of a question...what if?
It takes a few seconds to orientate herself afterwards, but when she does, she knows with more certainty than ever that she must leave. She finds her robe in a haze, walking to the kitchen for a glass of water, then she goes to her room right as the tears begin to fall.
to take it,” Weasley says.
“Well, yes.” Draco’s brows furrow, noticing Pansy’s anger. “But only because she asked how you were doing.”
Lucy just sighs and continues brewing. She knows Harry’s stubbornness well, and won’t push it anymore. After a few minutes in silence, she stops stirring, and procures a small glass vial from her pocket. She uses a ladle to pour the dark violet liquid into the vial, then stoppering it before handing it to Harry, who takes it with a grateful smile.
are the unspoken words, but they sound very loud to Draco, who bites his lip to stop from screaming out.
“You’re not in Slytherin.”
No. He stumbles away from the edge, and Pansy rushes to him, taking him in her arms. Draco let’s the sobs heave his chest, tears sliding down his cheeks, soaking her cloak. Pansy strokes his back comfortingly.
“Merlin, Harry! You know what I mean. You must know how I feel about Ron,” Hermione says, then continues casually, “I know I am no master of deception like you.”
Suddenly the furnace roars to life, and Harry springs back, jumping off the counter and swiping his glasses on. Draco looks at Harry wildly, his mouth red and his hair sticking up in the back.
“Not Ginny,” is all he says.
“Moon.” Luna smirks, and it looks very dangerous on her pale, wispy features. “I know.”
Harry cuts Draco an angry glance, the first emotion Hermione has seen from him the entire class, but he looks at Slughorn expectantly.
“To end his life?” Hermione finishes gravely. She meets his eyes, and they are sad and heavy. “I don’t know, Ron.” They sit in silence for a moment longer before Hermione’s head jerks up. “Wait, did you say he talked about finding another world?”
“Shh.” He kisses Draco, pressing himself close against the heat of his body, that warmth like a memory, like a piece of the sun and everything good in his life, breathing right in his arms.
It was good. Too good. They knew what they were doing, each movement sure and steady and deliberate. A tilt of the head. Dip of the chin. Fingertips pressing into the sensitive skin of his neck.
They slowed down when the sun dipped its bottom edge below the horizon, and they hovered up in the clouds, where white mist engulfs everything except the tips of the castle towers.
“Harry,” Ginny says, as if that explains everything.
A silvery light circles their wrists, brightening briefly, before fading into a strip of white satin binding their wrists together. “It will disappear when you finish this bottle of champagne.” She opens the champagne bottle and hands it to Malfoy. He takes a long sip, then shrugs.
Hermione pauses, a word snagging at her memory. “Lost…”
“Anyway,” Hermione says, shrugging, “enough with the past. It’s the future we get paid to worry about. Speaking of, the raid went beautifully. We recovered some rare and extremely dangerous artifacts, which you can freely examine if you wish. There is an item we need your help with. A vial, actually. We suspect it’s illegal, though you never know for sure.”
“What did she say about Harry?” Draco asks, his voice tightening automatically. When Pansy doesn’t answer, he adds, “It’s okay. I just want to know.”
He feels Draco’s cock sliding against his leg, a gentle reminder. Harry bites Draco’s skin. He slips a thigh between Draco’s legs, nudging him open, and with his hand he grabs Draco’s erection, firm and smooth in his palm.
“You make a good point, Miss Lovegood,” Harry says when he notices Miss Weasley’s cheerful disposition waver at the question, “but it does not make it any easier.”
“Oh Harry, why can’t I remember the preparation of the Dreamless Sleep potion?” Hermione complains out loud. She looks off into the distance, biting her lip, her knee bouncing rapidly.
Ginny’s face softens, and she smiles, brushing a hand over Harry’s arm. “I know.”
Angrily, feeling betrayed but at this point just more exhausted, Draco continues walking down the corridor swiftly, stopping in front of the wall and closing his eyes. He takes a deep breath in. If Harry wants to play this game, then so be it, Draco will play—though he won’t play fair, that’s for sure. A Malfoy never stops being a Malfoy, even while fraternizing with the enemy.
“So,” Hermione says, smirking, “you’re into those one night stands? I admit they are much less messy than relationships, trust me.” She thinks of Rose spitting up on her bib, and sighs fondly at her double entendre, however silly.
“He’s the only one I have,” Harry whispers, his voice choked. “And I’m not even sure I have him at all.”
“Do you suppose Miss Granger right? That we may not be accepted into the classes of our choice?” Weasley asks.
“I will.”
“It’s something to do,” Harry says, turning the cigarette over in his palm.
“You think I’m clever?” Harry asks, mostly teasing, but Draco blushes.
“Can you still see me?” Draco teases, smirking, but his eyes remain serious. They must not immediately recognize the betrayal of their friendship which they have just committed.
To make sure he’s real and solid and not falling apart.
A large, dark oak door materializes in front of him. He can almost hear another heart beat just a little faster, so close he thinks Harry might be right behind him.
Ginny briefly closes his eyes. “I don’t know what you want me to do. Luna and I are traveling to Nepal tonight.”
“This is truly magical, Headmistress,” Harry says.
In a heartbeat Pansy is there beside them, her robe cast away. Harry watches her breasts rising and falling gently with her breaths. She gazes at Harry with an intensity matched only by Draco, and Harry feels like a small animal cornered by two prowling predators.
“That’s it!” Hermione exclaims despite Ron’s shushing, and she runs out of the bedroom in nothing but her underwear.
“And what do you suggest I do?” Draco exclaims, exasperated. “If you were in my place, what would you do? If you’re so clever, what do I tell Harry?”
“Draco!” Pansy interrupts. “I could see it in her eyes. She knows something more is going on. Merlin, Draco, I
Draco cuts a sharp glance at Harry. “What does it matter to you?”
Leaning casually against the wall, head tilted back, cigarette visibly dangling between his lips, was none other than Draco Malfoy.
“Was it ever...sexual?”
“Hermione, quick, look.” She scrambles over to him without thinking, and Harry shows her the map of the Third Floor, and points to a pair of footsteps.
Earlier this morning, after a night no less passionate than others, Harry had woken up beside Draco who was sitting up, back flush against the headboard.
Ginny glances worriedly at Harry standing along in the kitchen, leaning against the sink. This entire Christmas break he’s been suspiciously quiet and pensive, often sneaking away from Hermione and Ron to look into space, or to lay down and flip through his Map, though for the life of her Ginny doesn't know what he hopes to find there.
Harry is the first at the tent flap. He hesitates, then says the password. The flaps rolls up by magic, and Harry ducks inside. To his amazement, he has entered the Gryffindor common room, or at least what looks almost identical to it. Weasley and Miss Granger follow behind him joined by gasps and surprised laughs.
then. I know it was Malfoy who cursed Katie.”
Draco swiftly pulled his shirt off instead of replying, and Harry’s mind went blank, and all he could do was make a weak sound at the back of his throat in question, eyes trained on somewhere right next to Draco’s face.
“Feet
“Oh yeah?” Harry challenges. “And what did the Ministry bribe him with, exactly?”
“No, you look hot,” Pansy says bluntly.
“Draco? Draco Malfoy?” Ron repeats incredulously. “Like, a love triangle?”
“You need to leave, Harry.” The hand holding his wand trembles. He frantically tries to think of spells that would injure but not kill, praying he won’t have to use them.
Draco hands over his mug. Then Harry bows his head, and leaves, but not before Hermione catches the edge of a smirk on his lips. She watches them share one last look that puzzles her even more, her mind slow and hazy like she’s swimming underwater.
“I know,” Hermione in the memory replies. “But enough about me. How about you? And Harry? Do you think you’ll get married soon?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s stomach, wrapping his arms tightly around him. “I love you.”
Their eyes met briefly. Harry had to drop his gaze down from the intensity of it.
“Another Muggle club?” Draco asks lightly.
“I quite agree,” Longbottom says, and it takes all of Harry and Miss Weasley’s self restraint not to laugh. They share a smile, but Harry drops his when he notices Weasley looking at them hopefully.
“If you’d just let me use my Cloak to sneak into the dungeons we wouldn’t have to frolick in the woods like centaurs,” Harry points out.
“Certainly not,” Harry agrees.
“Henry—”
Time slows down, each second like a frame in a stop motion film, that peculiar effect when the universe wishes to tell you something, to warn you, that much hangs in the balance in this moment, that one wrong move will send the scales tipping.
“We can’t, Draco.”
* * *
And, well, there’s a big difference between the two.”
Ron shakes his head. “No, not really. I always had the sense your heart was elsewhere.” When Harry tries to interrupt, Ron continues, “I know you love her. But you weren’t
His enemy.
“I do not pretend the end of the war has erased such differences, and nor should you. Instead, use these differences as a reason,
“Because now I don’t have any excuses,” Harry says quietly, then he turns back, his face steeled into indifference. Draco stares at him, speechless, his mouth open. “You should go to sleep.”
“I know, Harry, I was there too! But we don’t know what we saw exactly. Malfoy and his family have always been slightly suspicious. It’s not a shock they get furniture at suspicious shops.”
The night started hazy and mellow, but things took a turn when someone suggested spin the bottle, and by the end of the game a cluster of students were engaged in some kind of spiritual orgy which Harry had found half intriguing and half very, very disturbing. Regardless, he returned to Gryffindor Tower with a very different perspective on his fellow Hufflepuffs. As Ron put it the next morning:
“You don’t think…” Ron begins hesitantly, “...that he’d try…”
need you
The spell hits the stalls and shatters the first one, but Draco has slid away.
“Look, Harry,” Ginny says gently, looking into Harry’s eyes. He stares at Ginny like he’s torn between apprehensiveness and indifference. “You don’t need to approve of all of Dumbledore’s choices. It would be dangerous to believe him a perfect being. But you need to trust him.”
“My dreams. I...I have the same one, all the time. I know it’s not from Voldemort, somehow, or any dark magic, but still. I can’t tell if it’s normal or not.”
* * *
Harry gave up cramming for it about three hours ago.
Harry turns around.
The rest of the memory unfolds around them, the living room of Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s new home after the war and Fred’s death, the fire roaring to life across the room, and then the partygoers, memory Ron and Harry chatting against the far wall in the corner, Molly and Arthur sitting on the couch playing with Bill and Fleur’s children, the rest of the Weasley brothers scattered around the house, chatting with other notable guests like Shacklebolt, Aberforth, Padma Patil, Cho Chang, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan. And many others, laughing until their cheeks go red and drinking red wine until they start dancing to Celestina Warbeck, bring warmth and vibrance and noise to the memory all at once.
“I hardly know him.” Draco lowers his eyes. “Perhaps Ron would know better.”
“What?” she asks defensively.
Harry couldn’t have possibly noticed, the transition from Malfoy to Draco too slow, an imperceptible change in the larger picture. He blamed it on sharing a dormitory, sitting next to Draco in potions, and always flying a few laps over the quidditch pitch at the same time.
Suddenly Ron remembers his conversation with Harry. “That reminds me. I wanted to tell you what Harry told me the other day.”
friends. She had told him nearly everything, and now that he was gone, she’s found herself feeling adrift.
That is the truth of it. She is lost. Abandoned. Even Harry and Draco have lost her. She has been cast away by life, by her family, by her friends. She has nowhere to go.
“I won’t try to change your mind,” Hermione says, “but it’s clear that both of you want to be together again, to try and heal from the past. So what happened?”
“But clearly not everything,” Harry counters coldly. “What do you and your little Death Eater friends plan to do once inside the castle? I’m not stupid. I know they don’t plan to have a slumber party in the Dungeons.”
“I saw Malfoy at the Ministry today.”
“We shouldn’t.”
“Yes,” Draco says defensively. “It’s easier this way, though Merlin knows I hate the taste.”
Her breath leaves her lungs. “Harry.”
“Done,” Pansy says. “Follow me.” She leads Hermione across the store to the dressing rooms. She opens one and hangs up the various pant suits. “Start with the black one. And use this white button down for now.”
Pansy returns to an anxious looking Hermione. She holds them out.
And someday Harry will find another world where it doesn’t matter.
about
“Yes, of course,” Harry says. Then he leaves.
A hand touched his arm. Nothing more than a brush.
As they rarely agree on anything, Ron smiles, pleased that he can say, “Me too, Hermione, me too.”
“I thought you didn’t care about that secret anymore?” Harry asks carefully.
“See?”
Harry shifts in his seat, leaning forward and looking intently at the screen. He can see the barest smirk edging into Draco’s ever present frown.
"I'll come with you," Draco said without thinking, and followed her to them, ignoring the slightly amused look Pansy shot at him.
“Why do you do that?” Draco asks distractedly, leaning against the headboard.
Hermione gingerly takes the white lacy lingerie with a smile. “Thank you. I’ll try it on.”
Draco pulls away. She knows before he even says anything.
“It must have slipped your mind,” Malfoy says, narrowing his eyes at her. Finally, he looks at Harry, a glance of his usual indifference. He holds out his wrist. “Ready, Potter?”
Ginny sits up at this, but only Hermione notices, with Harry and Ron too busy staring each other off. Should Hermione intervene? For some reason, a small voice inside her head tells her to stay silent and watch it play out.
“Living up to your expectations?” Draco asks with an edge of sarcasm.
“Why?” Harry asks suspiciously.
“Ginny and Dean broke up.”
“This information is imperative, Harry.”
“No one is asking you to,” Ginny says gently.
Draco lights up, smiling. “She’s brilliant. The CEO of a fashion line for witches in business that like to dress fashionably and comfortably, but don’t want to spend too much.”
Ginny says goodbye to Dean and walks past them without saying a word, hurrying up the flight of stairs to the girls dormitory, her red hair swishing behind her before it’s swallowed by the door slamming shut.
She puts a hand on his arm, gently. “Draco, darling, listen to me. I will say this just once, and then we can never speak of it again.” His eyes darken to a slate gray as if he’s guessed what she’s about to say. She drops her voice to a whisper. “Be careful with Harry. Even if he loves you and trusts you, not everyone else will. I know the Dark Lord—”
Ginny looks away to mask the anger in her face, but Harry sees it; it’s one of the things he loves about her, that fierce knowledge of what is right and wrong, no matter how difficult.
Without warning, Harry spins Draco around and pushes him against the wall, caging him in with his arms. “I should turn you in right now,” he growls, and Draco gasps in fear. “After all, you are a Death Eater.”
“Don’t!” Draco shouts, reaching after him, but Harry twists away from him. “Don’t open it, Harry.”
Luna looks genuinely puzzled. “No. Her name is Irma. It means universe in Old High German. A very beautiful language.” She looks dreamy, but then again, Luna always looks dreamy.
“Okay,” Draco says finally, and Harry’s entire face lights up, not in a loving way, but more of a bright hunger with a ravenous appetite.
“Very exciting, definitely,” Harry says.
“No, Ginny,” he says forcefully. “You don’t know. You may think you know, but you really don’t know.”
They both stood still for a moment, holding their breaths, before
Ginny walks over to Harry, leaning down to kiss his cheek. “And don’t be ashamed to love him, Harry,” she says softly, only for him to hear. She straightens up and leaves to the girl’s dormitory before Harry can respond.
“What happened?” Ginny asks wearily. Hermione and Ron’s faces in her camping tent’s fireplace share a look.
“I didn’t know you had a tattoo,” Harry blurted out.
“Oh, Ginny?” Hermione shakes her head. “She tried, but Harry just…”
“Ron, I wouldn’t be saying this if I didn’t know for sure.”
Pansy says nothing, taking a sip of her coffee. Harry knows her well enough not to ask any more questions. He nods stiffly.
“Where would you live in the summer?”
“You mean that he really was a Death Eater in the end?” Ron asks, brows furrowed.
That this time she wouldn’t need to save him. And then a voice asks quietly and dangerously and clearly in the back of her mind, almost a whisper and yet as loud as the truth, and it sounds like Luna right before she points to the stars.
Then he is kissing her, and she gives herself one moment, one stolen, forbidden moment, before pulling away, extracting herself from his arms.
Pansy tilts her head.
“You haunt me,” Harry says in the same way Draco always imagines someone saying
“Wait,” Ron says slowly, “you knew about the task to kill Dumbledore?”
“It’s not right,” Draco says, and it comes out choked. Merlin, he has to pull himself together. “And for you of all people to do it.”
“Ron,” Harry says gently, though his smile has a sharp edge to it. “Do you really think I’d be good for Ginny? Or do you just not trust anyone else with her?”
And to Ron in that moment, she is the most beautiful woman in the world.
Hermione remembers feeling shocked, as they had been dating nearly ten years, and she looked it too, her mouth falling open before recovering with her brows furrowed. “No? You don’t want to settle down? Have a family? I mean, if you’ve changed your mind I understand, but I just thought...you always talked in school about…”
He elbows her, whistling. “Love that jumper.”
Harry pauses, closing his eyes. The Adam’s apple in his throat shifts when he swallows. “I feel very light, like I’m falling but I
“Quite.” Draco suddenly feels awkward, unsure of where they go from here. Harry scratches the back of his neck, as if feeling the same way.
“Well, yes. But that’s a very dangerous potion, Harry. Wherever did you here about it?” Slughorn asks, flabbergasted. Even Hermione and Ron are looking at Harry with similar perplexed expressions. Hermione remembers her shock that Harry had heard of a potion that she hadn’t.
Draco curls his legs around Harry. They can’t sleep without each other. Too many ghosts in the dark, too many secrets better left unsaid.
Hermione stands up, her cheeks red and pointing an accusatory finger at Harry, who looks at her with a new alertness. Even Ron sits up a little straighter. “You don’t know that! Okay, she might not be heartbroken, but she could still be conflicted about the situation especially with all the rumors, guilty for breaking it off with someone who was clearly into her, even more guilty if she doesn’t feel heartbroken, and overall exhausted from the entire ordeal on top of studies and Quidditch, but you could give a damn, and you know what? It doesn’t make you cool or above it all or excuse you from caring. It just makes you pathetic and most of all, a bad friend.”
“I’m sorry,” she says quietly. “It’s really nothing.”
If she knew then what she knows now, ten years later and in love with someone so very different, wondering if she will always be the one putting back together the broken pieces of a boy that only ever wanted his father to love him, only ever wanted to be normal and fall in love and live his life like a brilliant, bright star streaking across the sky, would she be so quick to hold out her arms, to love him so willingly and openly?
“How do you expect to heal, if you never acknowledge the wound?” Miss Lovegood asks.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Come on, mate. Hagrid’s waiting.”
She must find a place to shelter herself from the storm.
“Level four, please,” she says in a gravely voice. Harry nods, pressing the level four button as well as level two. The lift shoots sideways, and the bluebirds fly into the sky crying out, before settling down again, clinging fearfully to their nest. After a moment, the lift drops swiftly, and Harry’s stomach drops with it, never quite used to the terrifying speed of the Ministry lifts.
Draco only smiles.
“What are you doing here?” Draco whispers angrily. Harry shrugs off the rest of his Invisibility Cloak and slips inside the curtains, crawling onto Draco’s bed. He can’t believe Harry Potter is in his bed.
* * *
“No,” Hermione assures quickly. “Well, yes, but not with you. It’s Harry.” Draco grimaces at Harry’s name, and stands stiffly by the door like he’d rather be anywhere else. Not for the first time Hermione wishes things were different.
“That’s all?”
* * *
“You never mentioned this before,” Draco says. “In the Room. Why?”
“Sorry, I have a charity event in an hour,” Harry says quietly. Draco sits up, yawning. Even such a domestic, simple gesture pains Harry profoundly, like a single small blade to the right spot can sever the spine.
Would his father accept him? Would he warn him against it? Would he cast him out further than he already has?
, Mr Potter?”
“Why do you say that?” Ron asks, troubled.
“Maybe Ron is right,” Harry says, and when Ginny starts to speak, he continues quickly. “Not about that, exactly.” He pauses, deep in thought. “You deserve to love someone who will want to be there for you in ways I can’t. Maybe we shouldn’t...maybe we should stop.” He looks at her with a face clear of tension, perfectly relaxed, maybe even too relaxed, Ginny thinks.
“Ah.” Harry can hear Ginny frown. “Do you know why?”
Then he hears the coffee machine come to life with a loud hum, and he almost smiles.
“You’re really not joking.” Draco shakes his head in disbelief. “I can’t be your date, Harry.”
Dean is patient, but he won’t wait forever. Ginny knows this better than anyone.
“I’m sorry, but why are you here, exactly?” Harry asks with a forced smile. Malfoy flushes. Even Shacklebolt looks at Harry reproachingly. Harry stands his ground, staring at Malfoy as if he might will him to speak or leave. Malfoy says nothing, looking resolutely at the floor plans.
Draco pulls the shirt over his head with both hands. His gaze wanders over Harry’s chest, down his abdomen, the slight indents of his hips. Then Draco kisses him again, his hands wrapping around his waist, sliding up and down his back, over the ridges of his spine. His back ripples in anticipation, and the edges of his vision heighten their color, so that Draco’s mouth is red like a cherry, and his skin is pale and shiny beside his glowing bronze hands.
“That’s so nice to hear. Does she make pantsuits by any chance?”
“Harry.”
She raises an eyebrow. “That’s nothing new.”
And the most shameful thing of all is that those words will always be true.
“I know, Harry,” Ginny says, finally. “Since Sixth Year, I knew about Draco.”
“But I can’t remember why,” Draco lies. He watches Harry take a measured sip of his coffee and carefully place his mug on the counter. Then he turns towards Draco, smiling vaguely.
When it’s only them, and even Hermione and Ron say their goodbyes while casting worried glances towards Harry, Ginny decides to break the silence. “I think it’s time to say goodbye.”
“It doesn’t matter why you came back, Harry,” Ron says firmly, and Hermione loves him more for it. “It just matters that you did. You chose to come back.”
No one is in the common room, thankfully. Harry hates answering uncomfortable questions. He easily exits through the Fat Lady, throwing her a flirty wink to keep silent. She fans her face and blushes, but doesn’t say a word.
“Well I really can’t stay long,” Ginny say before Ron can speak. They both turn with identical confused and demanding faces.
Just then Madam Pince walks resolutely past, a woman on a mission. They both look up distractedly at her soft heels clicking on the wood.
“But what is the difference between ten and eleven? It’s only one more!”
Harry goes still all over. “Like me?”
Harry nods, a stiff jerk of the head. “I think I knew. I think I knew from the moment I saw the Vanishing Cabinet. But I didn’t want to believe it, that he could do something like that. He told me the day I used the
Ginny understands, then, what has happened and her stomach drops with a sickening swiftness. Harry’s chest heaves with dry sobs and together they slowly sink down to the floor, arms around each other, blood and tears smearing across skin.
to brew the potion,” Harry says, his smirk widening. Draco’s stomach drops. “But not for me.”
“We shouldn’t,” she says quietly.
Hermione and Ron share a brief look, before both flush recalling their argument, and look away.
“Friends?” Ron echoes. He scratches his red hair. “I find that hard to believe, but then again, Harry had a lot of secrets.”
“Lastly, while much about this year will contrast to previous years at Hogwarts, perhaps the most notable addition are the Eighth Years, who comprise of students that either missed their final year at Hogwarts due to special circumstances, or did not receive a suitable education last year as to prepare them fully for particular careers after Hogwarts. I will be speaking with the Eighth Years after the feast separately for further details about my expectations of them.
He hasn't talked about it yet, though that’s hardly unusual. Harry has always kept his true feelings close to his chest. But Ginny wishes that he would confide in her more, at least about something.
Ron smiles sadly. “I thought you and Ginny might make it. Can’t say I was surprised to see it end, though.”
“Do not trouble yourself,” Weasley says flippantly, though he does not meet Harry's eyes. “It is very common for a witch or wizard’s magic to cease working properly for a period of time. A second cousin of mine a few years ago experienced trouble with her magic. She could hardly cast even the simplest spells without either injuring herself or others.”
Harry laughs halfheartedly. “I suppose I’m a bit of a bummer this holiday.”
Harry rolls his eyes, pressing his lips together in a line, a flash of rebellion in his eyes. He does this occasionally, a movement of discomfort or annoyance, before smiling and shrugging it off. Ron never really understood this small moment of unguarded emotion. Is it how Harry really feels about the whole conversation? Or just a passing feeling?
Pansy shakes her head. “You didn’t offend me. If anything, I feel that I’ve offended you.”
“Were you?” Harry asks tersely.
“Harry?” Hermione asks.
She had always known deep down that some day people would start asking questions; she just hadn’t known that day would come so soon.
* * *
And then Pansy returned from her travels abroad. She was his best friend, but the aftermath of the war had wrenched them apart for the time being. Her family did not want anything to do with the Malfoys, packed up and moved to Paris, and forced Pansy to leave her friends behind.
“Honestly, Ronald, you needn’t come,” Hermione says harshly when he catches up to them, falling in line next to Harry who silently follows after a Hermione who continues to speed down the hallways, books in her arms, frizzy hair whipping viciously behind her.
“Draco,” Hermione calls out, and Draco pauses, tense. Though they have gotten on better terms, there is still a gulf of awkwardness between them, as if neither wants to offend the other.
She hugs Ginny, then Luna. They both look beautiful, long flowing hair, a glowing to the skin from being in hotter places during England’s muggy winter.
“Your favorite pastime,” Harry says wryly.
He kissed a boy. He kissed
“You’re mental,” Draco says, dazed.
“Because of Draco?”
Harry opens the door to the shop hesitantly, wondering if he was right in what he saw. The inside is empty upon first glance, but then Harry sees Mrs Malfoy sitting in the corner of the room. She rises when he notices her.
“I do not have a single class on Monday!” Harry exclaims, dropping his smile when Miss Granger looks at him sharply. “Naturally, I will use this time to study.”
“Really, Harry, he could have just lost something.”
She gets up, moving his feet from her lap not so gently. Draco doesn’t bother. Surely it’s a Muggle that’s wandered up the wrong floor, or else a teenage wizard set on pranking former followers of the Dark Lord. Either way, it concerns him not.
The Hermione in the memory is slightly thinner, though no less curvier, in a wine red jumper that she knew Ron loved, especially from behind, which is where they are watching the memory from now.
Somehow Draco doubts it.
Ginny has always loved London. Even on a smoggy, chilly night like tonight, she delights in walking down crooked streets, beer drunken laughter wafting from bars down the road, a bright red omnibus careening past, headlights flashing on a group of rowdy teenagers, their skateboards scraping the asphalt.
Oh Hogwarts, ever the gossip mill, Pansy thinks with fond sarcasm.
Harry moaned aloud, grabbing her waist, but she took his wrists and kept them pinned by his sides, choosing the rhythm and rolling her hips slowly, until Harry choked out a plea, his fringe beaded with sweat, his head falling back. She released his hands and he wrapped his arms around her and entangled his hands in her hair, and Draco watched as Harry pounded into her, grasping her breasts, his face falling on her neck.
Harry stares at Hermione, slipping back into thought. He says finally, in a low voice, “I do love her, but it would never be enough. It is not the love she needs or deserves. We parted ways on a mutual understanding.”
“Be sure to send your response by tonight, and expect a few rejections. I hardly think Professor McGonagall shall play favorites in this,” she says carefully looking at neither of them. “Now, I must rest, for I expect we will know which classes we are accepted into by the morning after next, and from then on there will be no more peace.”
The door opens, and he hears a familiar voice. He sits up, listening.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “Hardly as nice as your manor.”
“Harry?” Luna asks, finding him a moment later in the alcove, leaning against his back and looking at the floor, troubled. “Why are you here all alone? The party is so sparkly right now.”
“Are you sure he’s not…” Pansy doesn’t even know the end of that question herself. Insincere? Two-faced? Lying? Experimenting? Joking? But she can’t say any of these; they will only hurt her relationship with Draco, and it’s the only thing Pansy has besides herself.
Hermione hesitates. “Is it…”
Draco looked at him, then shook his head. “Really, Potter, I don’t mind.”
Every inch of the room spelled out Sirius. Harry hated it.
The lock rattles and the door swings open. Harry glances at his parents entering inside, then returns his focus to the television, where Draco is just ahead of his car in the race.
Harry can’t decide if he hates Draco or if he just hates the world he’s living in.
Harry is up first. He greets her gently. “Good morning.”
After the war, Harry ceased to speak with his aunt and uncle, and only occasionally communicated with Dudley, so he rarely needed to remember his Muggle habits. It was quite disappointing, and worrisome, then, to discover that his magic did not work properly anymore. Suddenly the simplest spells became impossible to execute without some disaster. One day he nearly drowned the entire Weasley family after he casted an Aguamenti spell in the kitchen to make himself oatmeal. He blamed the war, and the grief, at first. But as the months went by and the summer came to an end, Harry quickly realized that something was very wrong.
After a few rounds, Harry knew he was pissed. The edges of his vision blurred and if he turned too fast the world spun. Draco didn’t seem to be faring much better. His cheeks were flushed pink and every once in a while he would adjust the scarf around his neck.
“That was unnecessary,” Harry says mechanically. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
Then he leaves for the last time.
“Am I that predictable?”
Ginny grins, and for a brief moment she sees a glimmer of the old Harry in his eyes, sharp and witty and prowling like a lion hidden in tall grass. “I wanted to talk with you.”
As she walks back down the stairs, she hears a murmur of a familiar voice coming from behind the staircase, hidden from view unless she were to peek over the railing. She pauses and strains her ears.
“This is not easy, is all I’m saying.”
“Very well,” Dumbledore says, straightening up. He strides swiftly across the room, reminding Harry that for such an old man his guardian—as Albus likes to call himself in regards to Harry—is still quite sharp on his feet, and no less in the mind. Something Harry learned very early on, and never forgot. “It’s about Tom Riddle.”
about this spells disaster. Literally!”
“Let’s just say he wasn’t the first fellow to try and chat me up,” Draco says with a smirk, and now Harry can definitely detect a slight slur in his voice. Just then the bartender places two shots of vodka in front of them. Harry waves Draco’s reaching hand away, downing both of them himself.
Hermione watches younger Harry curiously. “Do you know of a potion,” Harry says lightly, “called the Sad Nightingale?”
“Harry, is there something you would like to tell me?” Dumbledore asks carefully.
Hermione is wrong. As long as they have each other, no one will get hurt.
Ginny sees Harry curled by the fire, studying his Potions textbook, his Map lying protectively across his lap. He looks exhausted, his face gaunt and tense. She misses his charming smile, the one that always made her shiver, and she couldn’t tell if she was terrified or turned on.
An occasional Auror will pass by, tipping their hat or waving in his direction. Harry acknowledges them all with a small smile.
Ginny shakes her head. “We always have a choice.”
And then Ginny appears, right in front of memory Hermione, a glass of wine in one hand. She’s wearing a slim fitting pink dress, and she had recently cut all her hair off so it was cropped close to her head, making her blue eyes large and bright in her freckled face.
“No,” Harry says coldly. “Just show me the memory.”
“Well, you know my name,” Ginny jokes. “Always a good start.”
“Good evening, Draco.”
Without taking his eyes off Harry, Draco whispers, “
“Whoa,” Ron says, breathless. His eyes are wide as he takes all of Hermione in, and out of the corner of her eyes she glimpses what he sees in the mirror, the way the white lace leaves nothing to be guessed, the way the delicate straps outline her soft curves and trace a path across her most sensitive skin, the way her breasts—which she has most recently been self conscious of ever since Rose’s birth—spill from the thin bralette in full, lush crescent moons.
“Now you’re somewhat presentable,” Draco mutters, to which Harry rolls his eyes, but follows after him nonetheless.
Harry smiles darkly, and even Ron blanches. “What if I have proof?”
“I want the best for you,” Harry says quietly, almost a whisper, though it seems like it took everything in him to say it.
“No,” Draco says. “No nightmares.”
“‘The Ministry, along with Headmistress McGonagall, have decided to open Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this school year. After many weeks of deliberation, we have come to the conclusion that students who had occasion to miss a year at Hogwarts, those who were taught under less than satisfactory conditions for their last year, and those who must complete another year to fulfill special requirements, must attend another year at Hogwarts in order to receive a diploma. Unfortunately, many of the core classes will have limited space, as their professors teach other class years. Therefore, more electives will be offered than usual for the attendance of Eighth Years only. While I am sure you may have concerns, I assure you that under the guidance of myself and the new Headmistress Minerva McGonagall, the castle and its students will heal and learn more speedily after the horrors of the war
“Who is—Hermione? But you’re…” Ron’s voice trails away when he turns around, sees her suit, and the way it hugs her hips and shows just enough in the neckline to suggest a little more. “Early,” Ron finishes, clearing his throat, a bright red blush decorating his cheekbones.
“Yes, Pansy, is that so bad?”
Harry cannot think—his body spasms—Pansy stiffens around him—Draco cries out—Harry moans as his hips jerk forward with his release, his fingertips pressing into Pansy’s soft skin.
“I figured it out.” She sighs. “All these years. It’s so clear now, I can’t believe I missed it.”
Miss Granger soon caught on to all the rules, being a quick study, while Harry stumbled awkwardly through conversation and made many blush at his words and actions. Professor Snape tortured him endlessly about etiquette, but to no avail. Harry would always blunder through propriety.
Why is the castle mentioned as if it must heal?” Harry asks.
“Harry,” Ginny says with a sigh, “is my best friend. I will always love him. And I know he loves me. But…”
“Come here.” Harry opens his blanket with his arms, and like with all things Harry-related, Draco can’t resist his welcoming embrace. Draco scoots over, fitting himself against Harry’s body, the heat already spreading through Draco’s limbs as Harry wraps his blanket around them. “There. Not so bad now, eh?”
* * *
He props up the Marauders Map in his hands, though he doesn’t know what he expects to find, or what he’s looking for. Except, that’s not exactly true.
Hermione just doesn’t understand. If Harry wanted so badly to catch Malfoy, why shy away from the chance simply because he’d have to speak with his father? She’s definitely missing something glaringly obvious.
Draco stares at him with a wild look in his eyes that Harry can only call despair. “I can’t.”
“What Ron is trying to say, Ginny,” Hermione say carefully, “is that we’re worried about Harry. He doesn’t listen to us, so we thought maybe you could talk to him? We know he trusts you.”
“I forgive your presumption, Miss Lovegood. I might have wished to become an auror once, but with my poor marks I have not been accepted into the classes which will allow me to apply for the program.”
“Well, actually…” Hermione stands awkwardly, her weight shifting from one foot to another. She bites her lip.
* * *
“I’m just worried about you,” Pansy says, eyeing him seriously. “You know how much he hurt you last time. I just don’t want you to go through that again.”
to retrieve his cauldron and a few preliminary ingredients, all of which fit thanks to an Extendable charm.
Harry stares at Draco, his lips parted. He takes in all of Draco, drinking up the sight of him, knowing that this
Once in bed, Harry cannot sleep. He fears tomorrow more than anything, as it will be the first true test of his magic. The other boys are asleep, with Weasley snoring the loudest, so Harry considers it safe to take his wand out and practice.
Hermione sighs, and folds up her books. “I am exhausted. A good night’s rest should clear up my mind.” She slings her book bag over her shoulder and walks over to Harry, kissing him on the forehead. “Are you not coming up?”
They couldn’t hear the noises of the castle from up there, and only the sounds of owls cawing and wind whistling broke their silence.
* * *
“A few hours ago,” Hermione retorts, lifting her bare wrist. She kisses him, and he almost staggers off balance. “I see you’ve had fun.”
“It was pretty obvious to anyone who knows you two well,” Ron explains, scratching at the back of his head.
How many moments have been stolen from her?
“Well, if you had cared to read the rest of the letter, you would have seen that the classes offered for Eighth Years are quite...unusual. For instance, there are only three core classes, Transfigurations with Professor McGonagall, Astronomy with Firenze, and History of Magic with Professor Binns.”
“Of course!” Hermione smiles. “The Room of Requirement!” Then she frowns as Harry sits back, all the energy leaving him in one fell swoop. “But that’s hardly suspicious, Harry. He might be trying to find something he misplaced. It’s not uncommon.”
“I felt betrayed,” Harry says, and his voice has a fresh honesty like it’s the first time he’s confessing these feelings to anyone. “I trusted him. I chose him. But when it came down to me or him, he chose himself.”
He shrugged. “Our friendship has always been...intense.”
“Really if Tony Blair keeps quiet on Israel occupying Lebanon he won’t be reelected, that’s for sure.” The man next to Harry whose name he’s already forgotten keeps talking about current Muggle affairs which mean nothing to him.
“I need to go,” Draco says, getting up and leaving Harry laying on the blanket alone.
“As a matter of fact, my sweet sister,” Weasley says, narrowing his eyes, “I have been accepted into all of my classes.”
For a moment his eyes linger on the Headmaster’s Office, where Dumbledore’s footsteps pace back and forth tirelessly. Harry wonders what would happen if he went there now, told him everything about Draco, about the two of them together.
“Made you suffer? You’re the one who betrayed me! I lost the only good thing in my life, the only thing I loved—”
But she can’t save him, not now and not ever.
“Now you might disagree,” Pansy says shyly, “but I’ve always fancied Granger. She’s so smart and pretty and you can tell beneath those robes she has a nice curvy figure. No wonder that Weasley boy follows after her like a lost puppy, drool and all.”
“What’s gotten into you?”
“This year is a stepping stone, a time of healing and also a time of growth. It is my mission that upon receiving your diplomas, you are most prepared for the life you have chosen. Now, are there any questions?”
“Okay,” Harry repeats, then smirks. “Tomorrow night, my place. I’ll be waiting.”
She has always loved to watch two men kiss, but watching Harry and Draco kiss is something else. Is it wrong to say that of everything she will miss, she will miss watching them kiss the most?
Draco frowns, and Harry looks away, blushing.
“There is no other world, Harry,” Ron says slowly. “This is the only one we’ve got.”
wand.”
The words stung Draco like a slap, and he flinched. He started for the door in a mechanical movement of limbs, as if on autopilot, his face blank. He had lost not only the battle but the war as well, and like a good soldier, Harry knew it too. And like a good Malfoy, Draco knew when to surrender.
“Why would I do that?”
“Brilliant?” Hermione asks, hardly hiding her disbelief.
“I heard Malfoy is working with the Ministry now,” Ginny says as casually as possible.
Draco kisses him. “Don’t worry, Potter, I will.”
Hermione sighs. “Have you talked with her yet?”
Hermione’s voice raises urgently. “In his dream. Did he say he wanted to find another world?”
“Alright. See you tomorrow.”
“Not alone. It’s not right.”
“It’s not a competition,” Draco grumbles, then adds, “but I’d always side with Harry.”
Relieved, as if he had wanted to die, and it was finally happening.
Suddenly it’s as if all the oxygen has returned to the room. Draco can breathe, though he does blush intensely at her observation. “I’m afraid I am rather not inclined towards…”
“Why?” Hermione asks, struggling to comprehend. "Why would you use that horrid spell on him?"
“I know, but—”
“But it’s still early,” Harry protest, struggling to sit up. “You don’t have to leave yet. You could sleep here for a bit more, I won’t mind.”
Light fragments in the air. Draco moves quicker and Harry’s head falls back, silently, like a gasp, the axis of his body pulled like a magnet towards Draco and the rhythm of heat on heat on heat. His breath stutters in his chest, rattling like gusts against windowpanes. His legs shake and his mouth falls open, helpless, as his hands grasp at nothing, the white ceiling swinging wildly overhead, the light flashing in his eyes, flashing like a lightning bolt right through him, sends spasms of pleasure throughout his body.
“For what?” he asks.
the answer, this is the knowing, which he had always wondered at. He places his hands on Draco and knows that he touches the truth, that he touches life, pure and unaltered life.
“I understand,” is all Draco says.
suffer?”
“Nothing,” Harry says uneasily. “It’s just, Ginny asked me the same thing.”
Ron nods, his eyes wide. “I trust you.” Her heart warms at the words, and she holds out her hand. He takes it with a small smile, and they fall headfirst into the memory.
“To all of your classes?” Mrs Weasley asks, looking at him expectantly.
He looks sharply at Draco. “I though I heard a voice. Is someone here?”
Harry didn’t quite know when it started. Whether it formed before or after the war. If it hit suddenly or developed gradually.
heal, for I cannot pretend to have missed you struggling with your magic, though I did not mention anything for fear of offending you. Now it has become unavoidable, so I will let you go with one last piece of advice: Be patient, Harry, and all will be well.”
“Yes,” Harry says, “and no.”
With a loud crack and tumble, Harry and Draco stagger in the middle of his apartment living room. Harry leads Draco over to the couch, where he immediately lies down.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you reading anything like that.”
“Yes?”
“Yes,” Draco says, his voice barely above a whisper.
His green eyes look at Draco steadily, waiting. Draco can barely breathe, he has so much to say and so very little time. “I always thought I’d be the one to say it first.”
“Perhaps,” Draco says, tightly.
“I thought that you said the exact opposite, if I recall correctly,” Draco says, trying to hide the utter bitterness he feels. Even drunk, the rejection had a nasty sting with it.
“It’s cold in here.” Ginny hugs her arms, where the sweat is starting to cool off with the damp walls of the old boy’s locker rooms, now an abandoned room with a few benches and broken broomsticks, radiating a chill like that in a graveyard.
Draco stares at the space where he just was for a beat longer, before swiveling on his heel and disappearing into the curtains behind him.
“Nightmares.”
Draco nods wordlessly, and then the pressure on his arm is gone and Harry disappears around the corner of the bookshelf. When he’s gone, Draco takes a deep breath in, one hand on the nearby shelf for support. His mind whirls with a thousand thoughts he does not understand.
* * *
Pansy smiled. “Of course my love.” Then she leaned over and kissed Draco on the lips. Harry stared at Draco, shocked, but not upset, as she sauntered to the kitchen. Draco looked at Harry, waiting.
Harry shares a silent look with Weasley and Miss Granger. Then the Eighth Years are dismissed, and the Headmistress leads those of Gryffindor beyond the gates and across the lawn, where a small white tent with a Gryffindor flag flying at the top looks over the lake, glittering under the moonlight.
The Chosen One. The Savior. His rival and nemesis and a
“You can kiss me if you like,” Draco says in a low voice, still looking at Harry.
Then Draco takes his own shirt off, button by button, until Harry can hardly sit still. It is off. Draco’s pale chest rises and falls rapidly. Harry stares, mesmerized, at the skin that glows like marble, but which flushes with blood, brimming with life.
“Come home for dinner, though?”
Draco sighs, irritated. “No, I mean, yes, I do. But…”
“Who is it?”
Then he wakes up, and for a brief moment, he’s in another world.
“Do you love him?”
The Eighth Years remain at their tables, and with the rest of the student body gone, even the other professors, they look a pitiful group, scattered amongst the different house tables, hardly forty in number. Harry’s chest pangs when he notices the gaps, and the friends of those who died in battle, left alone among the living. Miss Parvati Patil, for instance, sits alone and quiet, where only a year ago she would have been giggling and gossiping with the late Miss Brown, who was one among the Fifty Fallen.
Harry has never kissed anyone before. The sensation is startling.
Then they exchange quick goodbyes, and the door closes. Pansy turns, and sighs long and hard.
“Then don’t smoke.”
“You can trust me,” Hermione says, and Draco hesitates.
about these letters and have not deigned to mention it to me? After all, am I not in charge of these children’s happiness?”
“Hey!” Pansy cries as the bottle refills itself as fast as she drank it.
“Oh yes, that’s one of two things she’s famous for, actually.”
“It’s not a joke.”
“We can’t always be happy.” She pauses. “Dean and I are fighting.”
“No.”
Draco never considered himself fond of physical affection; it wasn’t the traditional way to show love in his family. But he’s found that Harry’s warm touches, brief presses of the palm against his thigh or his back, simple touches, really, that do not suggest anything else, have almost a grounding effect on Draco, as if all this time he never knew he needed it so badly, someone to touch him like Harry does, to make sure he’s there.
Draco says harshly.
Draco frowns, as if reading his thoughts. “Why don’t you try now?”
Something inside Harry protests violently against this, a wild beating of the fists against the prison of his heart, and his arms tighten their hold around Draco subconsciously. He hates that the thought crossed Draco’s mind, that he spoke those words out loud, that he’s now heard them and can never unhear them.
“Rose has just fallen asleep for her nap,” Ron says in an awkwardly offhanded way, that Hermione has learned to realize is his way of signalling that he’s in the mood. She had always assumed his reluctance to explicitly say anything meant he didn’t care, but if anything, it has always meant that he’s cared too much.
Harry stares at the bed sheets for a long time, before he speaks quietly. “Draco wanted me to tell everyone. To love him and to not be ashamed of loving him. He doesn’t understand. How could I ever be ashamed of loving him? I could never—you must understand—he is—I can’t—”
Hermione backs away from the side of the staircase, flushed and hot.
Harry shrugs. “You won’t.”
“You know, Draco, darling, come to think of it, Hermione asked me a few questions too.” Her tone is full of sarcasm, and Draco narrows his eyes.
“We never dated, exactly,” Draco had said, awkwardly.
Snape replies with something too soft for Harry to hear, though he’s sure Draco won’t like whatever he says.
Home.
I have never been more in the dark.”
Harry does not fall asleep for a very long time.
“I suppose that’s the only thing to call it.”
Ginny’s mouth twists. “No.”
“Draco,” he says, so softly he doesn’t think the other boy hears it, but suddenly Draco whips around. “Draco, please.”
“It’s the war hero. Hermione Granger.”
“But what about Draco? How’s he involved?”
“―boring, more like―”
Harry raises an eyebrow. “What are you going to do, Draco? Kill me?”
“...meant for you?” Pansy finishes. “Probably gave you two away if anyone cared to watch closely enough. Both of you, staring at each other like star-crossed lovers. The nerve that boy has, honestly, Draco, if I could get my hands on him he’d wish he finished himself off before.”
“Deciding whether I should smoke or not,” Harry says with that peculiar honesty that provides absolutely no useful information, and in fact does not really answer the question. “You see, I quit when Rose was born.”
“I know,” Harry says quickly. “We don’t need to talk about it.”
“What...what happened last night?” Draco asks hesitantly, gripping his mug tightly. Harry winces.
After all, Pansy had loved them, because they proved that no obstacle is too great, no hatred too much, for love to conquer. They are the symbol of love conquering all. She held onto that like she used to clutch her mother’s hand as a child, knowing that as long as she held onto her, she would be okay.
Harry and Weasley blush as they hastily retrieve their schedules that were quickly placed in their pockets at dinner only to forget they were there. With a quill, they mark their classes, then lean closer together to compare.
Draco looks troubled. “Hermione’s a fighter.”
He knows what is going to happen next, and yet he cannot prepare for it. Draco’s legs brush against Harry’s sides, then Draco’s hand guides Harry’s cock into him, carefully, Draco exhaling loud, Harry grasping the couch with his hands, his vision going black.
How could he have survived the last decade without them? Without this?
She doesn’t even spare Ginny a glance. “Feet off the table, Ms. Weasley.”
But what is this knowledge matter in the face of this date? Do they mean anything, if Harry were to lean in for a kiss? How do they help him then, at the pivotal moment? Those facts seem to crumble under the weight of such significance.
“One can hardly expect me to know, can they?” Weasley cries. “Fourteen classes to choose from! Why, have
“But we’re not sixteen anymore. You are too old to sneak around scared of gossip while all your friends start to settle down. If Harry keeps you a secret this time around, Draco, that’s not love. I am not trying to hurt you, darling, but I have an objectivity that you do not. He’s ashamed of you, to
“Well, Harry was saying…” Hermione begins, then chews on her bottom lip, glancing at Harry who resolutely looks into the fire. “Harry?”
“What, and let you get away freely?” Draco asks angrily.
“People just won’t stand for it.”
“Please,” Draco warns.
“No,” Hermione says, averting her eyes. “It’s about Draco.”
“Sometimes,” Draco says quietly, “I wonder what our lives would be like if I had been born into a long line of Ravenclaws with no affiliations to the Dark Lord, or simply in another family entirely. Would we still find each other?”
“That is very noble of you,” Miss Weasley says, nearly mocking. She is perhaps the only person Harry is comfortable with teasing him about this.
“Well, the color…”
Hermione does not understand. The game? Is this about Champagne Shackles? She creeps silently to the railing and leans over the side. She nearly gasps at what she sees.
“Luna,” Ginny says, her voice wavering and coming to a halt.
Draco raises a brow. “I was thinking more along the lines of depressed teenage rebel.”
Perhaps it didn’t start so much as blind side Harry, a hit that came when he least expected, and had received no warning.
Draco says, turning around, and he curses himself for how earnest he sounds.
“You didn’t think Dumbledore was going to leave me so unprepared? No, I’m his greatest prize, his most valuable treasure. He made sure I knew how to protect myself before I even had a wand.”
Harry continues to stare into the flames. Hermione looks worriedly between Harry and Ginny. Ron just looks confused.
“Oh she doesn’t mind, do you, Pansy?” Draco asked, looking up. Harry snapped his head around to see Pansy with a bottle of wine in one hand, and wearing nothing except for a black lace thong.
“Why not?”
“This is quite enough,” Draco says, almost choked, standing up and gathering his things. He ignores Pansy’s hand on his arm and storms out of the classroom. Hermione watches Harry close his eyes briefly, before straightening in his seat.
* * *
Some nights, Draco wonders what life at Hogwarts would have been like for him, if Harry Potter had died as a baby, or if he had grown up somewhere else. He once overheard his parents angrily discussing the adoption of Harry Potter by Dumbledore. His mother had observed that if only the Dark Lord had not killed Harry’s remaining muggle relatives, maybe he would be an easier target now.
“Can you work on them tonight?” Hermione asks, getting up again. With a wave of her wand, the floor plans roll up and magically packages them, the Ministry ensigma flaring brightly at the center with glowing strings wrapping around it. She takes it, and the spell fades.
Ron rocks Rose to sleep, her face puckered with exhaustion, and her little mouth opening wide in an adorable yawn. Hermione walks in, hands in the pockets of her sweatpants which they both immediately changed into after coming back from the party.
“Honestly, both of you had better study when you can. This year will be much more challenging,” Miss Granger says sternly.
“Want a drink?” Seamus asked to no one in particular. “Some drinks over here, please!” He shouted to the bartender without waiting for replies.
“Harry,” Hermione admonishes. “You don’t have to be rude.”
“Ginny—”
Hermione holds up a vial with a silvery glimmer pooled at the bottom. She smirks. “A memory.”
“It’s the most important difference of all.”
"Hey again, Draco," Harry said looking into his eyes, smiling easily. Why does everyone smile so much? It just confused him.
Hermione laughs unexpectedly, a smile spreading across her face partly because of his compliment, but mostly because this is the first time Draco has called her by her first name.
She doesn’t bother to tell anyone. In fact, she would prefer secrecy for the time being, though she might have to pay for it later. Luna waits at Mr.Lovegood's home, probably setting up Christmas decorations.
“But don’t you get it, Harry?” Draco turns, letting his cigarette fall to the ground and crunching it under the heel of his boot. “I’ve already won.”
“Yes, Blaise?” Draco asks tensely, looking at where Harry must be, even though the space where he just was is now completely empty. “I just woke up.”
Draco’s eyes have filled with tears by the time she stops speaking. He does not want to let her go, but he knows he will have to. He nods. Pansy moves towards him, and he catches her face in his hand, and kisses her softly. She deepens the kiss hungrily, wanting more from him than he can give her. Draco allows her to kiss him like this, even though it won’t go anywhere, it can’t go anywhere. Then he feels her take off her robe.
A clamor from the door to the lockers makes her look up sharply, and suddenly Harry stumbles towards her, blood on his hands, a sharp bleeding gash across his cheek, tears flowing freely down his cheeks.
is not the hottest boy, ask anyone—”
She pushes the words out as neutrally as possible. “Not alone. It’s not right.”
But Draco only nodded, looking at him curiously under half-lidded eyes.
Harry nods, his throat constricting, unable to form a coherent thought, before placing his wrist beside Malfoy’s. He does not know why he is so nervous. Pansy raises a brow, then points her wand at their wrists.
“I only have Defense Against the Dark Arts on Monday,” Weasely says, smiling at Harry. “How would you like to study
“Want to tell me what that’s about?” Ron asks, already sounding resigned.
“It’s Harry,” Harry interrupts, then slides off the stool. “And I have to go.” He ignores the man’s protests and makes his way around the bar until he’s standing in front of Draco and the buff man, who is about to buy Draco a drink.
“He’s heartbroken...well, yes...you see?” Pansy replies, her voice dropping to an urgent whisper that he can’t quite catch.
Though the letter from the Minister alluded to it, and Mrs Weasley herself warned Harry, there could be no preparation for the state of the castle upon arrival.
“I mean, yes,” Ginny says reluctantly. “But it can’t be you.” She hesitates, then adds, “At least, you can’t be that for me. If you asked me, though, I could be that for you.”
Soon, she has a feeling, this will all be clear as day. Soon, but not tonight. And for once, as she settles into bed beside the man she loves in the house she has made a home with a family, that’s perfectly okay.
. Draco's whole body pulsed to one beat.
They pull apart slowly. His glasses have fogged up.
Harry relented. Too easily. He closed the door behind him with a gentle click and walked over to the side of the bed that Draco was not sitting on. Then he slipped under the covers. They were already warm.
“Quite right,” Weasley says, nodding his head.
“Draco…” Hermione hesitates, eyes averted to the ground, then sighs. “Well, she’s not exactly your type, is she?”
Pansy smiles sadly. “Are you sure that’s still true?”
Hermione’s jaw sets stubbornly. “In fact, Parkinson, I was. When I asked someone for you they sent a witch named Daisy, apparently your secretary. She was quite anxious to call for you. I must say, I hadn’t expected to wait.”
“I don’t trust him, Hermione,” Harry says in a low voice, with the smooth persuasiveness that has always struck Ron as somewhat unsettling. “He’s a Death Eater.”
And if she’s learned anything, when it comes to Harry, it’s best not to investigate too much if you won’t like what you find.
Ginny stands beside Harry right in front of the white marble grave fashioned inside the earth. He has her hand in a death grip. She can hear people crying, sniffling, murmuring. No one really says a word, but it’s definitely not quiet. The music of mourning sounds a lot more pathetic than she had expected.
Hufflepuff hosted next, and everyone that came was shocked at what they learned. As the story goes, a very quiet, shy Seventh Year had managed to smuggle cannabis seeds past security two years back to grow her own garden and has launched a small business from her dorm ever since. Harry had only smoked weed at the Burrow when Charlie or Bill came to visit in the summer, but otherwise it was hard to come by under the watchful eyes of castle security or the Dursleys.
“It’s Draco, I know it,” Harry says, that dangerous gleam in his eyes as he sits forward, almost conspiratorially.
“I heard,” is all he says.
“Potter?” Weasley asks hesitantly. “Are you alright?”
Draco stays silent.
Harry has an almost dreamy look on his face. “After I fall, right before I wake up, I’m in another world, and for a moment in this other world, I’m truly happy.” Then he sighs. “But it’s just a dream, right?”
Hermione thinks with a mental sigh,
Pansy looks at him sadly. “He doesn’t deserve you.”
He looked up, and his eyes were rimmed red. Draco hastily wiped away the tears and stood up. “Don’t, Harry. Please.”
“I wanted to.” Harry grabs the bottle of wine, a nice Burgundy that Draco has been fond of lately. He wonders how Harry knew. He pours two glasses, hands one to Draco, who takes it with averted eyes and a murmured thank you.
“Why don’t you go to the bedroom?” Hermione suggests, trying to remain casual. Ron looks a little put off by her flippancy, but nods anway. “I’ll be right there. Just need to use the loo.”
“You look awful,” Hermione replies bluntly.
She always imagined funerals to have music, the somber violin wailing on the wind as the camera pans across the attendants, faces streaked with slow-falling tears, one woman silently sobbing in the front pew, before focusing on the open casket, a pale face with eyelids closed, dressed and groomed for an eternal sleep.
They pull apart reluctantly, messily, breaths mingling. Harry kisses below Draco’s jaw, then his neck, the shifting muscles of his throat, throwing the covers back with one hand and finding the waistband of Draco’s pajamas with deft fingers.
Ginny glances across the room at Harry, who is still talking with Ron. They seem to be laughing over something. Harry sees them looking and raises his glass, a small smile on his face that Hermione notices now doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
“Morning,” he says curtly, too nervous to say much more.
“Yes,” Harry says flatly. “I knew about it. I knew but I couldn’t tell anyone because it meant Draco would get in trouble. I protected him. Though, he didn’t tell me he was going to kill Dumbledore at first.”
“Hermione?”
“Pansy!” Draco exclaims in a harsh whisper, looking around furtively. She squeezes his arm tighter, and he returns his attention to her.
“Hogwarts has stood, and still stands, as one people, not divided by their Houses, but united in their differences. It is by coming together despite differences, in fact,
He got out of bed and hurriedly left the room. When he was out in the hall, he could breathe again. The room had been stifling. He resolved to wake up Ron and Hermione, force one of them to sleep here.
He looks up at Harry with a smile.
Of course, Draco doesn’t work. He never planned to do anything with his life except live in luxury, and his family hardly lost any money after the war despite certain fines and fees during the trial. So he spends his days sleeping, eating, and shopping for his apartment. What more could a Malfoy need?
Then Ginny arrives, hand in hand with Luna, matching silver rings on their hands. Molly and Arthur are delightfully shocked and the news brings an added merriment to the festivities. Hermione walks over to them to offer her congratulations.
Harry raises his hand immediately, then blushes when he is the only one.
“Where are you off to next?”
With no better options, Harry awkwardly waved and walked back to the castle, trying to forget pointless things like how Malfoy’s jeans were ripped and the ropey muscles in his arms shifted under Malfoy’s black jumper.
The doors open wide, and she frowns, having expected Professor Slughorn. Instead, Draco Malfoy trudges in with his usual pride and contempt, sitting next to Pansy in the middle table on the left side of the classroom.
Harry waits and waits and then suddenly Draco cries out, pulsing and shaking above him, and Harry holds him steadily until Draco collapses in his arms, defeated, a victor. They find each other’s arms, find the warmth and solidity of each other’s chests, each other’s legs like vines mapping the forest floor, tangled on the couch.
Draco finishes, standing a little taller, flushing brighter. Hermione raises an eyebrow. “Regardless, we are ill suited for that. She prefers brunettes to blondes.”
When the room goes quiet, Pansy sighs, and speaks out loud though she knows he cannot hear it, in a voice so sorrowful and wary that no one would mistake her for a schoolgirl if they heard it. No, the war has aged her more than she likes to admit.
Herbology with Professor Sprout, highly selective
Harry laughs. “So not the rich and arrogant bully that falls for the devilishly handsome Chosen One?”
Draco swears he sees a flicker of hurt pass over Harry’s face, but then he decides it was probably just annoyance. The emotion fades, leaving a smirk and green eyes fixed on Draco’s face. He doesn’t understand why Harry has just now decided to find Draco so worth his time.
“Harry’s secret lover?”
“Of course we trust you,” Ron says, though he sounds about as sure as Hermione's thoughts, “but this is taking it too far. What happened to Katie was a serious criminal offense, not just some silly prank. You can’t go accusing people without proof.”
“Honestly, Cho and Cedric made a stunning couple, I must say. It was a shame he died, really. He was so handsome even I questioned myself,” Blaise says, almost sadly. Blaise rarely expresses emotions readily; in that way he and Pansy are alike.
as Pansy likes to call them. He’s touchy and affectionate with Draco in an unexpected, reverent way, as if having his hand on Draco’s skin somehow means something more, something almost akin to a language.
“Dating!” Ron exclaims, now doubly horrified.
Hermione nods, pensive. “Yes, I’m almost positive. And something must’ve happened recently. Again. It’s hard to tell, though. They are both very reserved.”
“Not of you,” Draco corrects quickly. “Of me.”
Harry’s hand moves quickly and blocks the hex silently, his palm deflecting it to the side, where it crashes into a large heap of lost items haphazardly thrown together. Draco can barely believe it, and he stares at Harry, speechless. Harry smirks.
Whatever. It’s not his business. Not anymore.
“What did you tell him?” Ginny asks, lightly shoving his chest, which doesn’t move an inch, a slab of steel under her hand. He’s quite handsome, Ginny is reminded, with a slim physique of lean muscle that varies between slightly tan and pale depending on the season. Even his outrageous hair, a messy mop of brown hair that’s never brushed, sweeps over his forehead, curling at the temples, unassuming in its subtle beauty.
It doesn’t seem to be working. Harry looks miserable, and he stiffens every time Malfoy even brushes against him. Then she sees from across the room Malfoy lower his mouth to Harry’s ear and whisper something, and Harry, almost alarmed, his cheeks coloring, stuttering a reply.
“Hermione,” he starts, then stops when he sees Shacklebolt and Malfoy in an intense discussion with Hermione, surrounding her desk which is covered in what look like detailed floor plans. All of them look up at Harry, and only Hermione looks unsurprised.
“Yes,” he whispered.
“I am perfectly fine,” Harry says harshly. “Thank you, Weasley,” Harry adds, hoping he did not offend. The last thing he needs is a breach in friendship with one of the only people who understands his pain.
All her clothes save her underwear and robe are bundled up in her arms. She feels satisfied and yet restless, almost anxious. Dean has always made everything so easy for her, even when she made everything so difficult for him.
“...acting like a child…” An insult Snape should take to his own heart, in Harry’s opinion. “...your
Miss Granger sighs beside him. “We should go or we might miss the train.” But she does not move.
Harry quickly finds Weasley and Miss Granger in a compartment with Miss Weasley, Mr Longbottom, and Miss Lovegood. He squeezes in beside Miss Weasley, who casts a withering glare at her brother and Miss Granger, who have begun bickering again.
Harry watches her disappear upstairs.
A fireplace roars on the opposite wall, framed by couches and armchairs, and the ceiling is vaulted with dark wood and strung with banners and lights. Other students mill about, already studying at large tables or spread out playing card games on the rug. Two staircases lead to the boys and girls dormitories, exactly as they would in the tower. Harry cannot believe it.
Boys and girls, girls and boys. Sharp jaws, soft curves, rough cheeks, firm hands, pink lips, stern hips. Ginny sees the lines blurring, the world opening up like the dawn of a new age. She remembers seeing Ron seeing Lavender, truly
“Bits and pieces,” Draco says, then pauses. “I can remember...the bar, and coming here. It gets a little hazy then, but I remember...we kissed.”
Draco looked away. He had never named the thing between him and Pansy, for fear that it would reveal something about himself that he could not understand with the language at hand.
each other anymore.
* * *
It’s positively depraved. Pansy can feel herself getting wet just watching them.
“Can you not play nice for a second, Harry, I mean honestly!” Hermione shouts. “You humiliated him, and he was a guest in my home! Do you have no shame?”
He gets up and goes downstairs, his head heavy from crying. Grabbing a cigarette from the kitchen table, he goes out onto his balcony, a small rectangular space a few stories off the ground, facing the alley behind his apartment complex.
Hermione stares at the fire, mesmerized by it the way only flickering orange flames can hypnotize the human mind. She should be studying, but recently she’s lost some motivation. Part of her just can’t stop wondering what Ron is up to.
Slughorn flinches beside her, then chuckles nervously. “No doubt, no doubt. Very illegal, that potion. Banned centuries ago.”
you. Can you live with that? Can you live with yourself?”
—but then Ron starts to snore softly, and Hermione smiles to herself, sighing.
“Ginny? What do you mean?” His eyes are steady, but his mouth is tense, and Ginny realizes he’s terrified.
Ron nods his head vigorously. “Yeah, you’re probably right. I’ll just…” He gestures awkwardly over to a now singing Hermione, blushing when Harry raises an eyebrow, then hurries over to her. Harry rolls his eyes, and decides to leave them be. Perhaps he can buy something sweet in the meantime.
"Whatever you say, Draco." Pansy rolled her eyes. "You are just not subtle."
The fire burns out to glowing coals as they kiss, and the room darkens a shade. Draco moves again, this time swinging a leg over Harry’s waist, straddling him. He pulls his shirt off, and helps Harry do the same. Before they kiss again, Harry glances at Pansy, whose robe has become half undone, revealing a narrow strip of stomach, quivering in the dim light.
Ron stares at Hermione, slightly terrified. She doesn’t blame him. Here she is, nearly ten o’clock when they both have early starts tomorrow morning, barely dressed, holding up a vial of a memory she tucked away in her cabinets long ago.
“Nice place,” Draco comments cordially, though it’s not really his taste.
“You don’t understand,” Draco says bitterly. “You don’t understand what it’s like to love someone like this and have them ask you to keep it secret. Would you give it all up? Just to be able to hold hands in public?”
He was
“We’re worried about him, Ginny.”
“Sexy?” Hermione suggests, and Pansy would laugh if she could stop staring.
“Yes, it’s time a woman takes charge of things,” Hermione agrees sternly, still carefully watching Harry. “Merlin knows men have done enough damage for a century.”
“What does that mean?” Draco asks pointedly. His heart thumps loudly in his chest, and he hears a strange ringing sound in his ears. Is this it? Is this the end of everything he ever loved?
Harry sighs. “I suppose I could have, but I thought perhaps Herbology would be useful for aurors. At least for me, as I am already familiar with the Muggle world.”
“Already finished yours?” Ron asks, finding her alone, wrapping his arms around her waist and blocking Harry and Malfoy from view.
“You’re leaving?” Harry asks, his voice small like a child’s. She pauses at the door.
“That’s a very convincing argument,” Hermione says with a smirk. “But there’s only one small problem.”
Harry smiles, and shakes his head. “No need.” He guides Draco’s hand and touches his cock, now limp, but still warm from the blood coursing through it, and wet.
“But you did.”
“Pansy, I can’t—”
Mrs Weasley hurriedly opens the letters, muttering, “And what do they suppose, sending four letters with only one of my children still in attendance?”
Draco shuts his eyes briefly. “You don’t need it. But I know how much you think you do.”
But here he is, curled up on the couch, Pansy on the other end worrying herself, his feet on her lap. He hasn’t cried yet.
“Did you invite someone over?” she asks.
“Oh.”
He’s been this way since the break up with Ginny.
“Still having nightmares?” Draco asks. Harry looks at him sharply.
“Don’t we all hate in our own way?” Pansy counters, and Hermione studies her face with those keen brown eyes that seem to catch the loose threads in every story. She wonders who they are really talking about now, and how truly passionate, almost borderline obsessional, that Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry can become if the fires are stoked in just the right way.
“How long did I sleep?”
Immediately he only has eyes for one person.
“I’ve only ever wanted to do it with you,” Draco says, looking at him carefully. “Haven’t you thought about it before?”
Teeth scraped his skin. A firm hand gripped his dick, Draco’s mouth touching the head, and Harry arched his back. He wished he could see. He could just imagine it, Draco’s head between his thighs, his mouth wide, lashes delicate against his cheeks.
Harry’s mouth flattens in that line Draco found so mysterious that one day, eternities ago, before this whole thing got so out of hand. Now he wants to slap that controlled emotionless frown right off his face.
make a move, that Harry would be unable to comprehend it.
“Well if you say it like that.” Malfoy brings his mouth on Harry’s neck, trailing down to his collarbone, as his free hand quickly unbuckles Harry’s belt. Harry throws his head back, breathing hard, closing his eyes as Malfoy lowers to his knees.
Harry kisses him. He can sense Pansy watching, with lidded eyes, from the other end of the couch, shifting in her seat as the energy in the room tilts in another direction. His skin burns at the very thought of her eyes on them, and he snakes a hand down Draco’s side, slipping it under his shirt, caressing his soft skin. He wants to move quicker, but Draco slows him down, finding a rhythm with their tongues, a dizzying, teasing pace.
“Thank you, Mr Longbottom, but I assure you, the rules are quite clear. Besides, I would not want special treatment on account of who I was or what I did. I wish to be accepted upon pure merit, on account of who I am now.”
Of course, he still made sure people did not get in his way, as all good Malfoys do.
Slughorn bustles around the party goers, his nervous smile and laugh filtering between the crowds. Harry looks into his cup, the wine swirling dark and purple. Luna abandoned him to chat with Ginny, but he would rather be alone anyway. He really hates parties.
Harry can’t get him out his mind, the name circling in his mind like a dizzying merry-go-round. He hasn’t seen him since they’ve got back from Christmas Break, and Harry thinks he might just go insane.
She looks briefly at Harry’s bed, where she’s spent more time than she’d like to admit. It’s somewhat strange now to sneak up here and sleep in a different bed. His curtains are drawn tight. Ginny glances around, then tiptoes over to his bed. Just one look, one last look of Harry without him looking back.
“Why are you crying?”
When he sees that she is close, Draco grabs Harry’s cock, which jerks in his hand. He feels Harry tremble beneath him, and Draco delights in the effect he has on Harry, even more so now, how a single touch can make him lose focus. Pansy does not let up, starting to move her hips, so Harry must pay attention, even though his body yearns towards Draco.
As Hermione readies herself to Apparate home from the Ministry exactly two hours earlier than she had told Ron, she reflects on her interaction with Pansy earlier that day.
Weasley asks.
She begins to read her textbook again, unable to stop the smile on her face.
She shakes her head, biting her lip, the tears spilling over her cheeks.
Draco would take either, for some drama to the boring routine of Hogwarts. He hasn’t always thought Hogwarts boring. But this year, everything feels pale in the face of the dangers lurking all around in darkness. No one knows about them except Draco, of course, and it’s his burden to bear. Alone. But sometimes he wishes...
“You think they still hate each other?” Ron looks around the room doubtfully. Hermione sighs, wondering how they could have gotten it all wrong.
“It’s impossible.” They both know it’s true. The Ministry’s tight regulations would sniff out the potion before he even begins brewing, and they would burn his shop to the ground. He would lose everything for a second time, and Harry would watch it happen again.
“I think,” Draco says slowly, looking Harry in the eyes, “that McGonagall will preserve Dumbledore’s legacy, while making her own.”
“I have, though not on purpose,” Blaise says, frowning. “I really only thought about it when Draco would bring it up or ask me questions. Before he knew he was gay, of course.”
“I don’t want them to look up to me!” Harry shouts.

“Harry?” Draco says tentatively.
After she closes the front door behind her, loud enough for Draco to hear, she stands on the doorstep, just as she did two months ago, no less lost and alone, but determined, to find her way, knowing she must now. Her heart bleeds with the wounds left from two beautiful boys who have pierced through her in different ways. Where can she go from here?
Harry looks at Draco’s very pale face, his cheeks still wet with tears, and for the first time he feels truly terrified of what he has become. “No, I didn’t.”
who kissed him because of a stupid game organized by drunk teenagers. Absolutely not.
“Sexy?”
In the dead of night, Harry wakes up. He mostly sleeps during the day, as if his body physically cannot stand the light, preferring the cover of darkness instead.
And sometimes they never truly heal.
“Please, tell me what he wants of you.”
But perhaps it’s more.
“What about a Sleeping Draught?”
They make a lovely contrast, alluring in its startling opposites. Harry’s brown hair looks black besides Draco’s pale face, marble-white. His locks curl like ink around his face, and Pansy cannot tear her eyes away from his sooty lashes, his strong brow, his full lips, like a girl’s. She wants to touch herself, but Draco calls her over before she can.
Harry approaches the front desk slowly, his boots hitting the wood floors with a soft thud. “I did say that, and I was telling the truth. I don’t want to see you. Except,” Harry adds with a quirk to his lips, “truths often like to lie, because lies often tell the truth. You see, I just can’t keep away from you no matter how hard I try. And I really do try.”
“Anywhere else you can sleep?” Harry asks, trying not to pay too much attention to how Draco’s body pressed against his sends an icy shot of flames through his veins.
Harry looks up at him, then kisses his stomach again, sliding his shirt up, and sucking on his skin.
“Is that a cigarette?” Harry asked, bewildered. Malfoy didn’t startle, the only sign he even heard Harry a delicate arch of one pale blonde eyebrow and his fingers removing the cigarette. “I didn’t know that was allowed.”
