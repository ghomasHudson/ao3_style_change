"How are the others?" he snapped as he swept his hand along the counter – toothbrushes clattering down to the ground. "Where the fuck are my glasses!"
"It's about Draco. Something happened between us, and I can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I can trust him. I mean, do I ever?"
The boy took back his hand - his black cloak draping down his shoulders – and turned his back on him, leaving with a slow but steady pace. Harry shivered once his scent gnawed through him, familiar and rich. Dark but warm, like the scent of a forest during a snowy winters day. "Don't you walk away from me," Harry demanded – grabbing his cloak to keep him still.
"I see you," Draco muttered, his voice low. Scary, how his voice managed to haunt him through the halls, no matter how fast he walked.
"Sounds like a clever plan to me." He bit his lower lip, looking at the boy in silence before he decided to clear him out a bit. "It's evidence."
" I want to hear it," Harry continued as he cried, "from you, from professor Dumbledore. For hell I care Lucius Malfoy tells me so." He sniffed and dropped his shoulders. "Anyone... Just tell me the truth?"
Harry pursed his lips, narrowing his eyes as if the light was burning him. "Through the chimney. Obvious, isn't it? According to my poor appearance, as you would call it."
Draco seemed bland. For all it seemed he couldn't care a single bit about the past. His life was a mess nonetheless. Nearly dying was apparently a part of that. "Come," he muttered as he stuffed his sweaty palms in his pockets. "Follow me, I've got an idea."
Harry slept elsewhere that night – no consequences attached. Professor Dumbledore knew. Not of his fight with Draco, but him sleeping elsewhere. He needed to be alone – an unused office being his best pick, giving him the loneliness he desired. And it worked. Once he assured himself of a good night sleep, he woke up at ten. It wasn't planned. Nor could he believe Dumbledore allowed him to – since he was meant to practice for the Quidditch game coming up, and that was about two hours ago.
"Potions, was it?" Ronald asked as he raised his brows – trying to remember their schedule. "For you two, yes," Hermione stated proudly. "I'll be heading to Herbology. In fact, I'll be heading there right now. Professor Sprout wants to see me."
'Selling,' Lucius finished in a mutter as he scanned the room. 'There's something outside I'd like to you to see.'
"You fucking pervert." Harry threw back the sock, landing right on Seamus' forehead. Ron cocked his head, not speaking just yet.
Draco's movements stopped. The clacking sound of his shoes echoing stopped. Harry's heartbeat became almost audible through the entire space, and his breathing stopped. "Please, just tell me what you want."
"They broke up," Luna muttered under her breath, holding Neville's hand; hiding it under the table. Longbottom didn't say much. His cheeks were bright red, and all he could was looking at his golden girl.
"Ron!" he shouted, tears running down his face unknowingly. "I honestly don't give a shit. Please, you know I'm lying right here."
Harry grabbed his sleeves, taking a hold of the blonde - not allowing him to leave. "Don't go, please."
Ginny called. She stood on her toes, softly knocking on the solid wood of the door – afraid to interrupt Harry's business. "Harry, we are leaving. Are you ready to go?"
"Everyone knows already," Harry cut through. "You don't have to do this. It's not going to solve anything."
Harry pressed the back of his hand against his lower lip, preventing the blood from spilling – even though it wasn't much.
"So easily offended," Harry muttered as he brushed the tip of his tongue along his lips. "I came here by accident. If it makes you feel any better about yourself. I definitely didn't mean to meet you here."
Today was way more difficult to keep a straight face. Though Harry finally shared some words with Draco after a while, he still couldn't believe how it could've taken so long for them to meet again. Eagerly he waited for the day to end, and dinner to be served at the Great Hall. After stuffing his mouth with mashed potatoes and chicken, he rushed over to the castle grounds once more - hoping to see the blonde before he would arrive at the boathouse were they were meant to meet. The air was nice that evening. Warm, especially for the time of year. No jacket was needed. Though the sun was low, and almost already vanished, the last beams of light felt great on his skin. It felt like being kissed. As if he could taste the bittersweet of future; the postponed love he was meant to find. Harry didn't find a trace of Draco, walking past the tree and the river - keeping an eye out for any Perfects. Would he bail out again? Harry shook off his fears, starting by shaking his head all the way down from his arms to his legs as he exhaled – as if he was about to put up a fight. He would be right on time. Eight was the time they'd agreed on. Draco insisted so himself. However, now the time was there, Harry didn't feel so eager anymore. Why wait for two months to show yourself again? In fact, how was he able to disappear like that – even though they went to the exact same school. They lived there.
That night it became almost impossible for him to fall asleep. After two showers; trying to scrub all of Malfoy's blood off his body, he dropped to bed – paying no attention to Ronald rattling about his new girlfriend. No one seemed to know about Draco's health, nor did anyone ask about his leaving. Harry's eyes were red of crying, and his cheeks hurt – the salt of his tears having turned into some sort of acid, irritating his cheeks more at the minute. Ron was in the seventh heaven. His lips were swollen, his cheeks bursting red, and he smelled funny. Seamus and Neville seemed most interested in Ron's experience, and so he spoke with great detail – giving the impression to Harry as if he was close to feeling Ronald's tongue in his own throat, suffocating him with disgust. He wanted to say something, brawl at them – forcing them to stop. It appalled him, leaving him with agony knowing no one seemed to care about him. Wasn't his suffering visible? He turned to his side, mocking – trying to keep his lips from twitching as he held back more tears, his body bathing in sweat.
Harry got up on his feet as soon as his body allowed him to. Shaking and sobbing, he tried to make his leaving as unnoticeable as possible. Having his hands cleaned by using the inside of his shirt, he closed his vest – covering the half of his face with the hood hanging from it. He was lucky to wear his normal clothes, now it was Friday night. After going down several stairs, ignoring any person he met (though there weren't many) he locked himself up in the girl's lavatory on the first-floor. Moaning Myrtle sang a song, doing her business on the very toilet she died, and barely noticed Harry's presence until he turned on the sink. Crying under his breath, he pulled off his shirt – cleaning his hands to get the copper stains of dried blood off his skin.
"I can make you forget, Malfoy," he whispered. "I can make you forget everything that's still bothering you, and burns away your last bit of faith."
Harry shrugged, his body unable to find either rest or patience. He wanted to leave, look for Draco, and leave the eating for later. His mouth was dry. Even though he knew he was incapable of holding any stomach content, he couldn't withstand a glass of juice. Taking a large sip, he looked at Neville – still ignoring the question for all it was worth. What could he possible say? Yes, in fact I've been with him the entire night. Oh and we made out like two bitching puppies. No, not so much.
Draco didn't reply. He simply looked at him, his eyes blank and empty. He didn't speak. He simply looked at him. The piano stopped, and shoulders found ease. Was he giving up? Only because Harry refused to understand his pointless plans and riddles?
They discovered each other's bodies slowly; sharing slow and passionate kisses – resulting for pieces of clothing to vanish in rhyme. The bed turned messy. Their neatly flattened sheets were now crumbled together – their pillows pushed down on the floor. No matter his headache growing stronger, Harry clamped onto Draco – wanting more. His scar was burning; his head dizzy – and damn how he loved it. Draco hissed, pushing his teeth down into Harry's neck – biting his skin steady but slow, teasing the shit out of him.
His roommates laughed, seemed to start throwing things at each other, and a sock landed right next to Harry's face. That's enough, he thought.
"I knew it," Hermione replied – shaking her head. "You've been so aggressive and absent lately. I understand how invigorating this can be... Or well I don't, it's probably a boyish thing, but you..." She clenched her teeth together. "Stop the fighting. Or whatever you are up to. Malfoy is a foul person, we all know that, but that doesn't mean you have to lower yourself to his level. If we are lucky, he'll get suspended one day giving us a reason to have a great party." She chuckled to herself – placing a hand on Harry's knee. "Don't worry about it. If Draco is planning on fighting you again, I know for a fact you will win. Besides, what a surprise. I never knew Draco had it in him."
"Stay with me," Draco called as Harry slumbered his way towards the door exit. "If just for tonight?"
A warm wave of excitement rushed through Harry's belly now, and goosebumbs popped up his skin in seconds. 'How do you know that?' Harry replied with gritted teeth - trying his best to hold back a groan.
"Harry," Ron started, folding his hands together as he leaned in. "I know you have feelings for her. I've known it from the very beginning. It's always been a battle between us."
For weeks they didn't speak at all, and it seemed as if everything had turned back to normal. Harry was following his classes. Hermione and Ron were able to sit in the same room again - and actually share a word or two - and Ginny found herself a new boy to keep her eyes to. Quidditch practice would be starting again soon. A great distraction to keep Harry's mind of the heartache - for he felt let down once more. Luckily, as time passed, he'd managed to keep a straight face. No more questions about his feelings, or the blonde he'd been chasing for months. It was like everything had been forgotten. And how? Two weeks break was all it took, and the rays of spring sunlight sneaking up from the top of the hills - brightening up the faces of each and every defeated student looking for more than the time of year had to offer. It wasn't till the end of February for the two to interfere once more - stumbling upon each other during a walk on the castle grounds. Harry had been gathering supplies for the upcoming quidditch practice, and on his way back stumbled upon the blonde sitting in a tree.
The blonde didn't reply on his comment, and just narrowed his eyes, kneeling down in front of the drawer from the desk.
Harry came to a pause. His wand lingered in his right hand, and he took a breath – reconsidering the situation, it seemed. "To do what?" he asked not persuaded just yet.
"I know you're not, Harry." Dumbledore took a deep breathe and gestured Snape to come closer. "Severus, please. Could you?"
Harry gathered the strength to get up and go for a walk. Classes no longer bothered him. Attending any of them wouldn't advance his grades, knowing he wouldn't be able to keep a hold of his thoughts. It was time to have the crucial talk. Walking down the halls he realized it was almost impossible to bear the daylight. His eyes were dry and irritated by all the crying – even though everything that happened last night seemed like a dream to him. His bloodshot eyes were the only evidence for the pain in his heart. The explanation of what seemed to have happened last night could be actually very real. Harry had no idea where to search for the blonde. Draco would disappear from time to time with various vivid reason that never seemed to make sense. The only way to track him down was to go down into the dungeons and find a way to contact him or any of his friends.
"How particular," Harry spoke as he watched her leave. "She used to hate you, and now you two are hooked up. What a world, huh?"
"We had a fight," Harry replied. "For some reason it has been haunting me for months, knowing I'm not like that. But it felt good." He looked at the sloping landscape, trying to keep his mind from trailing off.
"Shut it," Draco scoffed, rushing his hand through his thick blonde hair. Burying his face in his neck, he trailed down his chest – his hand stroking down his inner thighs; resulting for Harry to keep his eyes tight shut. His cock was throbbing. He was nervous. Draco kissed his abdomen, resting his chin on his stomach for a small moment to look up at him. He sensed his tension.
Harry stretched out his arm, catching Draco's wand as his enemy clattered against the walls and floor. "Not so sharp, are you?"
"Harry!" Hermione called as she rushed to embrace him. Harry gasped for breath, having great troubles to stand on his feet by her sudden attack. He mumbled something close to 'morning, and escaped from her arms after a brief pat against her back. "Where have you been? You are so in trouble!"
Draco looked up at him – his attitude confident, steady but calm. Like he had it all planned out. Harry, on the other hand, balanced on his feet – his heartbeat rising at the sight of his enemy. He took slow steps, his eyes scanning around to see if they were really alone like he told him. He would never be able to trust him. Not while he could think of their past. Draco was a foul, sneaky guy whom only thought about himself.
Draco gritted his teeth now, seeming to struggle with his fears and frustrations, what caused Harry to back off slowly - but not in a way of fearing. He didn't fear for Malfoy. He just wanted to challenge him. In all the years he'd know him, he only realized he became more insecure in time. He wouldn't have the guts to kill him, nor severely injure him.
"He has been a better dad than yours. Dying at your bed while you lay drooling! Didn't do shit to protect either you or your mother. He just wanted to die! Just to be released from your bullshit future."
Harry flinched, but couldn't keep himself from feeling highly excited at the familiar angry voice. Speedily he took a jump into one of the closest classrooms, what caused that he didn't have any time to think of the luck he had - being some off them still open - and after nuzzling himself between two bookshelves, he took a breath to listen to the sounds around after. It took quite a moment before someone finally pushed the door open - what Harry had been aiming for - and he found it rather confusing how he seemed to hope for that particular person. It appeared to be Malfoy.
He gasped from surprise and backed off immediately – colliding with his back against the Professors chair, not being able to keep away a chuckle. Harry had no idea whether to feel offended or not. As he tried to study his breath, he moved his back against the edge of the desk and grabbed the edges of the wood to press him up a bit. He gasped, swallowing away some saliva that piled up in time under his tongue.
Snape looked outside the windows in silence. This lasted for about ten seconds before he finally replied without turning.
"I presume." Snape raised his brows once more, shrugging as he prepared to continue his walk. "What could have possibly happened?"
"Perhaps," Harry answered pensively. It seemed as if he had something to prove. Though lovers wasn't the way he would describe them, there was a certain kind of lust – befouling the air, causing their lungs to cramp as they met.
Draco tore his eyes off him. A massive amount of anger resulted for his muscles to tense, and for a split second he was about to grant Harry a massive punch – if just to punish him for his blindness. "Oh come on, you love the attention."
Harry was done for that day. No longer could he comprehend the events of today. He seemed to be floating – as if he were in a dream – and he didn't like it one bit. Nothing made sense. Nothing seemed to have a logic explanation. Nothing seemed to work in his advance. He felt silly for looking for Draco. He felt bad for being fooled again. For being made fun of in front of everyone. Maybe he just had to let go. Let go of everything he'd been struggling with.
"Wait until my father hears about this," Draco spit, his expression turning more sour at the minute. Harry could only sigh, knowing Draco's words were like the same old song.
"Borgin and Burkes," he replied as he searched for their eyes. "Lucius is selling something, and I'm keen to find out what it is."
"I asked you twice," Ron muttered as he stuffed his face with the last bits of crust, "-if you wanted a slice. You didn't respond."
Draco poked his side, chuckling – this being the actual first time Harry heard an honest chuckle from his ever so lasting enemy.
"It took you long enough," Dumbledore spoke pensively as he turned around. Snape flicked his wand, preventing anyone else from coming in.
"Quiet!" Snape closed the door, pushing Harry onto a stool before he turned to grab some tools. "We had an appointment."
"Don't worry," the voice said. Harry turned his head, looking for the one to hold him to the bed. The blonde sat down on the other side of the mattress; his shirt partially unbuttoned. "It's just me, alright?"
He gritted his teeth, dropping his shoulders – giving in to his own lies. Who was he fooling? He'd been slumbering from time to time. Not even lecture could reach his brains now.
Harry gulped and tried to climb out of bed - resulting for his arms to swing half-cross the air, his body unable to grand him what he wanted. "I need to go," he stammered as he managed to kick one foot out of bed. "I need to go..."
"I have way too many feelings," Draco replied. Harry shuddered at the cold of the oakwooden desk pressed against his back, and placed one of his arms underneath his head – his feet tapping against the side. "You don't regret it, do you?" Harry wondered as his eyes were locked to the ceiling. Draco smiled, shaking his head – rather uncharacteristic for him.
Harry smiled as he led out a cry, nodding his head as he held the blonde's face. "I love you too, so, so much. I just don't know what to do anymore. You are driving me crazy." He looked up, his eyes red and irritated - as if he hadn't slept in days. "I can't go on without you."
The night had started. The opening ceremony was done, and as usual everyone was forced to do a waltz – as Professor McGonagall was ever so pleased with the Christmas results from years ago. Hermione looked beautiful as ever. Her dress faint yellow, extraordinary and tremendous with a silver laced mask attached to her face without a string – and than Ronald looking rather silly, as if he tried to mock the elderly. Harry, on the other hand, was natural; a black suit, bordeaux tie, and his mask – a weak excuse for a Dracula-like costume.
Draco couldn't finish his sentence. Harry already placed his lips upon the skin just above his bellybutton, and a stream of warm shivers ran down his spine. His lower lip began to tremble immediately, and he gazed down – almost squeezing his eyes entirely shut by nervousness.
"Now tell me. What about Draco?" Hermione looked at him, her massive frown caused her forehead to wrinkle, and her nose came close to Harry's cheek.
"You don't have to," Draco comforted him as he held his face. "You don't have to. You don't have to do anything. Right now I just want you to lay down and sleep. Alright?"
"Do I what?" Harry questioned in a light panic. It was hard to keep his sanity now both arousal and intoxication were on.
Shut it – Draco mouthed as he tried to keep his lips from curling. Harry nodded deeply, closing his eyes as he waited for the noise to ease down. After a minute or two, everything seemed to be clear again. Carried away in some kind of trance, Harry got pulled away from it once Draco removed his finger; pulling him up to join. "Where have you been?" Harry whispered; eager to kiss him. Draco partially dodged, colleting a kiss on the corner of his mouth with a smile.
'What did you do to my suit!?' Draco sneered as he scowled. Harry took this perfect opportunity to scan him from head to toe, and titled his head after cocking it.
"Fuck off," Harry scoffed – expecting this to be a joke. "It's been fun, everyone. Now give me my glasses and get out. Who took my wand?"
His lips groped down to Malfoy's neck – and at last, he gave in. Draco took his turn now. He twisted his fingers around Harry's blouse – eagerly pulling it off his body as if he disarmed him from a bomb, buttons clattering to the ground like shattered glass. Growling at each other's touch, they moved through the room – one of Draco's hands scanning as they kissed, hoping to find something to lean on. He wanted more, for now he was King, and there was no turning back. "What are we doing?" Malfoy muttered once pushing Harry down onto an old desk. Harry grabbed Draco's collar – looking at him, confused, possessed, careless. "I have no idea." Draco shook his head in return, knowing just as much as he did, and looked at him before kissing him again. It made his heart die, thinking how he would displease his father by these actions; and yet, even though Draco had severe daddy issues, he bit down the boy's lower lip in vain – for all didn't matter anymore. Harry's heart skipped a beat, amazed by the discovery of pleasance, and pulled Draco closer by the very edge of his trousers. Though sexual arousing barely crossed his mind, this seemed to come close. His belly filling with a pleasant kind of sickness resulted him to take over the situation. Pulling the blonde close, his glasses fogging, he buried his face in his neck.
Draco moved through the room like a predator. Slowly, melancholic, yet stiffly. Like he always did. His nostrils were lifted by mischief. He knew he would soon find something. Something that could gain him pride from his father. A shoulder pat. A good call in their brotherhood. Draco strongly craved for such amazing publicity. He was known as a coward. No one really told him, ever. Not in the order at least. But he knew. It was obvious. Harry bit his lower lip, feeling uncomfortable and creeped by the dirty closet he was in. Draco's steps echoed. Harry swore he could hear him breathing. He was close. Harry blinked. His body ached by the terrible way of traveling, and he was short of breath since there was a lot of dust around. Find me, he thought. He gritted his teeth and dropped his head against the wooden wall behind him. He exhaled deeply. Almost as if he wanted to be caught. And so Draco brushed his fingertips along the outside of the wooden closet - his touch gnawing its way through Harry's brain. A beam of light entered, and the pale face of a dirty boy lighted up. Draco lifted his chin, breathing deeply through his nose - trying his best not to be surprised, or extremely happy and relieved.
A clinging sound got audible. A scraping sound came from behind Mr. Borgin's back, and someone coughed. Mr. Borgin turned, rubbing his hands delighted, and an oily smile appeared onto his tired and sly appearance.
"Harry," she began as she leaned over. "Tell me what's wrong. Normally you are not as quiet. I'm worrying about you, alright?"
And as quick as that Harry thought he would be safea gain – to his surprise and luck. Unfortunately, in the end it appeared he wasn't going to be left alone like he hoped so. There was one particular person in the shop that remained wandering there, and it was nobody less than Draco Malfoy. He gave the explanation to his father that he wanted to check something. Harry didn't know what to think of that, and it honestly got him quite excited. Spying on Draco was something rather interesting. The whole Slytherin scum was always full of secret. Unfortunately Draco headed straight towards the corner Harry was hiding in, and so he forced his hand to his mouth as the blonde came closer. His breath was pushing against the wooden cabinet door, and he wished he could close the crack in between. If Draco noticed someone was near, and he would investigate the cabinet, Harry would be doomed.
"Are you taking a piss?" Harry snarled. "Again?" He threw his head in his neck, scoffing, and turned his back on him. It felt like Draco was playing a game. What did he want from him? What were they doing anyway? He thought they were finally done with this bullshit, putting blame on each other for whatever the fuck they were doing. It became tempting to use the Obliviate spell, if not on himself.
Ever since his fight with Draco, Hermione and Ron were acting highly unusual. Not only because Hermione seemed to be clutched against his arm, but also because of their bad excuses – probably to get rid of him. Harry tried to find himself company between the shelves of the library, but couldn't find joy in reading any of his picked out books. Hermione was known for making the library a better place – knowing he could count on her whenever they had a test. He would mostly sit at a desk, Ronald at his side, drawing offensive creatures representing awful teachers while Hermione sighed and puffed at the books she'd been reading a hundred times.
Harry scoffed softly, finally meeting her eyes again, and granted her a modest, grateful smile. "Me neither," he replied. "It was just a couple of punches. After that I scared him off." Liar.
He was paralyzed. His body aching – hands investigated his body. Could he care for their talk? Now their lips were connected, and they were all alone. Naked. It was going too fast for his mind to register their doings. Something he couldn't control. Not now the white-haired boy trailed his long, bony fingers down his body like searching through an old archive in the restricted area. "We shouldn't," Harry muttered nevertheless, as soon as he managed to pull back and look him in his blue, zircon eyes.
The blonde lowered his cap - revealing his icy hair - and looked up at him, guilty. "I'm sorry. I didn't want to do this." Though he kept a fine distance, he reached out for his hand from under his long robe sleeves - grabbing Harry's index finger with his pinky. Harry's expression immediately softened, and he batted his eyes - blushing as a smile appeared.
"Cheers," Harry muttered, his face full of disgust. Terrible, how he graved great care for the most hideous looking creatures – thus only plants. Neville seemed to find some kind of interest in Harry's disgusted expression, and so he couldn't keep himself from forgetting the original subject, and beginning to rant over his weird ass cactus.
It took nothing to take Harry to walk with him. Especially since it was his only opportunity to hear more from him. Now he heard his voice once more he realized how much he had missed it. Once they headed outside the castle, speculations were ever so caused. "Where are we going?"
Ron thumbed the tip of his tongue along his lips, suddenly triggered to get his books from his bags – if just to create a little distraction. "So?" Ron shrugged. His pensive attitude caused Harry's teeth on edge, and once Professor Snape came through the door, he bend forward to hiss something offensive.
Though everything warmed his heart, a piece remained cold - for no sign of Draco was given these days. Not an owl, not a present, not a smile before he left. Two days before the school was off was the last time he'd seen the blonde, and that was it. They did not speak ever since. Harry found it difficult to cope with, especially now none of his friends were around. Though drinking liquor with Hagrid was a great way to get his mind off things, having his blonde around would merry the place in an indescribable way. He celebrated Christmas, modest - his books up close, yet untouched - and he got quite a little intoxicated after he sang and danced among the edge of the forbidden forest. He felt sorry for Hagrid. How he lived buried away in his shack, disgraced by many. Harry cried out his love for his taller friend, blessing his retarded features and easy brain - leaving Hagrid astonished on his porch step. Tears were shed, and hugs were given until Hagrid ended up falling asleep - leaning against the door post - and Harry had to manage to keep his feet on the ground. Ignoring the few staff members and students wandering the empty halls of Hogwarts, he stumbled towards the common room - hoping he could snuggle right into bed once he'd arrive.
Draco crushed his lips onto his - his fingers sliding through Harry's hair, eagerly searching for handhold. Harry stumbled, his elbows knocking over several piles of books and vases – clattering all over the floor, echoing through the enlarged room. Though pulling back would be the most reasonable thing to do, Harry didn't. Full surrender he leaned into the blonde's kiss – his chapped lips embracing his, wanting to taste Draco's breath on his tongue. For far too long they had been circling around each other. Their minds and bodies connected from afar. Though nothing seemed to be permitted, Harry couldn't care. Now being alone, buried between a dozen of lost things, he simply couldn't. It seemed like a dream. Their bodies full of ecstasy wrestling as they pulled each other's hair – their tongues entwining as they gasped for breath in between. It seemed like they were running a marathon. As if they were meant to finish within fifteen seconds before anyone would write them out.
"Come on, you weak bastard. You're making a fool of yourself." Harry still pointed his wand at him, knowing they were alone for now. Harry rarely felt the urge to punish someone, or even take a mock. But now, seeing Goyle wobbling against the pavers, it brought him great pleasure. A weird kind of satisfaction that made him feel evil in the most pleasurable way. He'd always hated him. If just by his stupid manners and weak attitude.
"Harry," Ron cried as he choked in one of his homemade sandwiches – he was on a budget. "You are bleeding!"
"Let me give you head." His eyes stood serious, but optimistic, and for a second he looked down. Before Harry could even ask what it was, giving some one head, Draco took a breathe to clear him out. "It's a blowjob, to comfort you," he continued.
"I never had a choice." Harry looked up at his white haired friend, and remarkably enough; smiled. "You do. You don't have to do this."
Their hearts were burning with desire. Draco spoke in solid gold, and his hands felt like the hot summer air. Harry looked up into his eyes, a prey volunteering for his death. Everything seemed to have changed. But who could tell him this would last long? The blonde broke his thoughts by kissing him again, taking off their boxers without a sound. The silence was appreciated, no matter their huffing.
"Harry, you know you're always save with me, as in... I respect your every choice and action. Don't forget that alright?" She placed her hand on his shoulder trying to get him to look at her. Harry met her eyes, nodding gratefully – though a smile was barely shown. "If you're ready on telling me what's bothering you, do it? Alright? I've got to go now. I have an appointment with Professor Sprout. It's about-" She shook her head, her hair shivering to all sides in a hurry. "Never mind, I'll tell you later." She gave him a hug in a rush. "Goodbye Harry!"
It may have sounded a bit angry and forcing, but Draco smiled at it. He stopped, searching for Harry his eyes as if he was actually surprised by his insult and command. Nevertheless, he kissed his lips again, immediately kneeling down in front of him afterward to pay him in return. Gently. Harry his back writhed as well now. The desk behind him shoved over the wooden floor, and a high pitched sound got audible at it.
"Goyle." Harry crouched to grab his book, but Goyle snorted – hissing for him to back off. "Calm down you chicken," Harry hissed. "I'm sure you barely know how to use that thing." He was referring to Goyle his wand.
"Yeah, what about that?" Harry called as Hermione rose from their table. She didn't listen. After a quick peck on Ronald's cheek she left.
"Potter-" Draco squeezed out. "I don't-" He couldn't finish, again. The first groan got audible as soon as Harry opened the button of Draco's pants, and pressed his lips against the cloth of his boxers – the place where his lower parts were located. Draco immediately squeezed his eyes shut, pressing his nails against the solid wood, and tried to ignore the pleasure.
Hermione nearly rolled her eyes, and pulled him along at his robe, apparently not accepting the nonsense.
Uncontrolled looks stained to Harry's back. People were talking about him. About his insidious outbreaks, and his deserted looks. It was about a week ago that he swore he'd seen Draco sitting in the Great Hall, and to this day – even though everyone told him otherwise – he refused to call it a tangled perception. He wasn't going mad. Draco was still around. No matter how silly it would sound, he could feel him.
Draco smirked and crossed his arms. Not because he believed it would work, but because he thought the upcoming minutes to be rather entertaining.
He grabbed her arm once reaching a silent corridor, pulling her aside to get her to look at him. "Ginny, what do you mean?" A frown dug into his forehead. His palms were sweaty, and his stomach turned as she gasped for breath.
'Do it,' Harry hissed through his clenched teeth now - he actually caught himself at smirking. He wasn't sure why, but he craved for Draco to hurt him. Though Draco always tried to come through as dangerous, powerful and sly, Harry had always felt more demanding over him, than vice versa. Draco approached him rapidly, but still didn't seem to be sure whether to hit him with his flattened hand again, or cast a harming spell. He knew them. He knew many of them. But did he ever dare to use even a single one?
Nevertheless, he continued sucking shortly after. Harry clenched his teeth, realizing how his climax came closer and closer, and in time he almost reached it he managed to squeeze out the last warning.
"It's your burden," Draco replied surprisingly clam – though his teeth were on edge. "I simply hope they'll see what kind of fraud you are."
"What's with the kidnapping?" Harry snapped back as he got up from his feet. He brushed the dirt off his knees and tugged his robes back into place. "You nearly got me killed."
Hermione actually wanted to ask what Harry was up to, especially since h announced his doings with "it", but a soon as she threw another glance at her book, she decided just not to. So with a brief nod and a forced smile she turned, heading towards the common room after to leave Harry on his own.
"Potter," Draco spoke – his voice surprisingly soft. He remained seated, his hands folded together as he sat bend-over. "You came."
A harsh and low voice made him startle – causing him almost to topple over as he dropped his book. It was Goyle, pointing his wand at him by anger.
Draco looked up at him loosening his tie. "Never," he simply replied – wrinkling his nose as he did. "I'm simply trying to understand the flair about you."
"I will kill you," he cursed under his breathe. Harry, still drunk as a dog, didn't seem to care much.
"Malfoy," Harry hissed, rushing after him as he swore he could see him vanishing behind a corner. "Malfoy, wait!" His shoes echoed through the halls. Nearly headless Nick wandered around, his shadow creating a cold vibe around the area, and he wished to talk to Harry – if just to thank him once more for all of his help during their second year (he could never shut up about it).
Draco didn't reply. Instead he simply closed his eyes firmly, running his fingers through Harry's hair before he opened his mouth to loudly take a breath.
Draco didn't reply. He simply ran up to him, throwing his arms around his neck to pull him into a close hug – his face buried under the hems of Harry's collar, finally willing to cry out and simply not give a shit. Harry stood petrified, his arms extended to the side – gesturing a simple "what the actual fuck" until he gave in to his own cravings and hugged him all the same.
"-No," Harry cut through, his voice suddenly a lot louder. "Please, no. I've got to go. I think I'm going to vomit." Harry rushed on his feet – taking his leave with his mug still half-full.
Hangover by Draco's touch, he hobbled around – wondering what time it was; whether he missed breakfast, whether his friend were looking for him... whether anyone even cared. His expression changed by the thought of that. He could've known. The secrecy between Ron and Hermione grew stronger every year – their behaviour changing. The look in their eyes changing as they met. Harry wasn't sure whether he was able to call it jealousy, but he was clearly unhappy by the way they decided not to tell him – for he was still their dearest friend.
"Harry, are you okay? It's past bedtime, and I'd like to freshen up a bit before hopping off to bed." Clearly Hermione's voice. "Are you surely alright?"
"He's a lunatic," Ron whispered in Hermione's ear before she got up. She scowled at him underneath her breath as he whimpered.
"So what now?" he asked eventually, throwing a glance over his shoulder. The blonde stared at his wand, as if he was ready to use it.
Harry woke up the other morning. Although his head felt heavy, he seemed to be well rested. The bed beside him was empty. No trace of the blonde was left on the disorientated patterned sheets. Harry shook his head, lifting his arms to stretch his sore muscles. He wondered if Draco was still around, planning on fixing his broken heart. There was a lot that didn't bear thinking about. Thinking could hurt his chances, and he wanted to last. Unfortunately the will of the mind always remained stronger – even though many believed the heart was the one to fool, but so would the head. However you wished to approach it, concerns would never leave as easy. They would burn its mark onto your soul, and you would be the one to fight it – if you could. He had Draco under his skin – wiggling and cutting through his flesh like razorblades. It would be easier not to love. But it was too late for that now. He could drown in the presence of the blonde. It resonated to the core of his being, his vocals washing over him like raw honey - thick and sweet. He was sick with the pure delight and obsession over him. As if he'd never loved before.
Harry shrugged – his eyes rolling right before he turned his torso back to his to make his way back to the blonde.
Draco pulled back his head so he could stare down at Harry's face, and titled his head as this twinkle appeared in his eyes.
Harry's heart skipped a beat, and he swallowed away his uncomfortable business. His wand burned in his pocket – having the strange urge to paralyze the bastard and get the fuck out of there. "Did he leave?"
Pomfrey raised her wand and drew a line above Harry's panicking face. A green fog landed down on his forehead and he fell fast asleep.
Harry shook his head, forcing himself to keep his eyes open and take a deep breath again. "Not that I know of," he replied. "Who told you that?"
"I just wish we could talk it out," Harry whispered as he dropped down on one of the beds they pushed together ages ago. He pulled over the sheets, covering his shoulders as he inhaled the smells - dreaming of picking up the scent of his blonde.
Harry shivered at her words, and looked around in a hurry – losing track of the one he was looking for.
"A what?" Harry scoffed, shaking his head - ready to throw a comment if Draco did not pull down his guard once more. For a second the blonde went through his knees, as if he was really attempting to give him head any moment, and his fingers fold around the buttons of his pants. As his knees met the solid floor, a soft sigh escaped his throat, and he chortled - barely audible.
"We should go. This isn't working. We can't get into the drawer, and I bet anyone will be here in some minutes. We can't risk that."
"Yeh," the blonde replied - cleaning the glasses with his shirt. "Now shut it. I am not supposed to be here." The two giggled. Harry took his glasses once they were ready to look through again, and he embraced his friend while his heart bloomed. "I thought you'd forgotten about me."
Hermione raised her brows, surprised but confused – barely knowing what on earth he was talking about. "Eh, wait. What?"
"Draco Malfoy did not survive the damage inflicted on his body. Once Severus found him it was too late. I am so sorry, Harry."
Harry rolled with his eyes and shooed him away to push the wire into the lock afterwards. The lock didn't budge. "Took it from the Dragon Barrel Brandy cork. I was feeling nervous."
"I was curious," Harry replied. He didn't dare to approach him. Though he rarely felt out of space, right now he really couldn't find his comfort zone. What was he doing?
"You look so good," he moaned – peaking between their bodies, staring down at his solid cock – still hiding in its boxers. Draco flinched, grabbing one of Harry's wrists to squeeze it – holding his own pants up with the other.
He clenched his teeth, annoyed by the way he allowed him to escape again. Doubt caused his stomach to turn, and now there was nothing left to run to, he wondered whether his friends were right. Maybe he was just going plain mad.
The day bled further into nightfall. Harry laid down on the grass for hours. Crying, until the wind turned from warm to cold and the stars decided to come out and play. His eyes hurt. His glasses no longer had a purpose and his clothes had become damp by the evening dew. He had to go back. Once he managed to drag his body back to the castle he considered walking past the Slytherin dorms. Harry couldn't comprehend the loss of his love. He closed his eyes as he walked, his fingertips drawing along the walls while he fought his tears. Every time he closed his eyes more memories seemed to come back. How it all started, how they fought, how they met. Yet once he opened his eyes he wasn't there. Though he'd planned to head back to his dorms, he stumbled upon the room of requirements like he always did. Even though he didn't look up once the door appeared, it opened by himself - letting Harry in as he staggered forward.
'Finally,' Harry muttered in an exhale. He leaned back with his head against the wall, and thumbed the tip of his tongue along his upper lip - tasting the coppery frequent of blood in his entire mouth in seconds. 'Was it really that hard?'
"It's okay,' Harry simply whispered. "I want this," he continued – stroking the blonde's thighs after pushing down his pants. "And you've done me before."
"-But," Ronald slowly spoke - trying to keep his distance from Hermione's beating hand, "-you are most famous for being 'the boy that fell', now." He chuckled a little. "But don't worry. Fred 'n George have something planned against Malfoy and his rats. If I'm correct they tried some of their puking pastilles on them. At least Crabbe seemed keen to eat them." Someone retched behind them causing Ron to pop up from his chair in joy. "That might be him!"
Hermione appeared from behind the gate wielding a concerned frown. "Harry, please talk to me." She sat down next to him, grabbing his hand as she leaned in. Her hands were as soft as her words. She was calm and loving for once. "You know Ron and I will always love you, no matter what. Right?"
Harry respond swiftly, having his wand drawn before Goyle could finish his spell, and cast it backwards by chance. It wasn't occasional to rebound a spell, but to Harry's surprise it did.
"Again," Ronald muttered under his breath. "-a substitute teacher." He dropped his head – rubbing his forehead, fearing the worst.
Draco pushed him away. He gasped for breath before he got back on his feet, biting his lip before he turned away from him. Like a layer, ready to be shed, his teeth tore his skin.
'I fucking love you too,' he replied him – once against pressing their lower parts against each other.
'Fuck,' Draco cursed – but not because he didn't liked it. That was after all what it was all about. He liked it way too much than he actually should.
'What are you doing?' Harry panted then - nearly groaning as Draco suddenly reached a remarkably sensitive spot in his neck.
'Well, the only conclusion that I can draw is that you've wet yourself,' referring to the large wet spot at the crotch of his pants. The spot had been a result of Harry's prank, though. As boyish as he rarely could be, he decided to put that specific spot under the shower after playing a game of quidditch.
"It was me who send him there," Harry confessed in vain. "I had no idea of what I was doing. Never before did I use that spell."
Harry took a shower later that evening. His nose was a mess, having his third nosebleed today, but he couldn't bother – knowing the weather was awfully unpleasant. His head hurt all afternoon, and the burning sensation caused his lips to tingle, and Malfoy his words crept through his mind like a snake he was. You ruined me, it echoed through the bathroom – as if the walls could speak, and the water transported the sound waves. His voice low, and vibrating through every limp. Brushing his flattened hand through his sleeky, wetted hair, he pursed his lips as his back touched the cold tiles behind him. His eyes were closed. Thinking about his upcoming year, he frowned his brows – his body shuddering by the cold. Hermione told him to take a break after looking rather pale all day. Hardly ever freely to find her ideas most useful, he finally felt righteous to say so. Taking a shower allowed his muscles to find some ease, and to clear his mind from unwanted fantasies about his white-haired fellow student. His vision blurry, and his ears overwhelmed, he brushed his fingers down his lips – finding a pleasant taste on his tongue. Though he hardly allowed dirty fantasies to trail through his head, he sighed at a recognizable scent – matching Draco's skin.
Madam Pomfrey sighed as the other nurses let go of the boy. She took the empty vial of wideye potion and gave it to one of the nurses. "We will try it again later. But not tonight."
"I'm not hungry, really. Besides, Ron brought a box of cornflakes. Now he's messing with 'Mione, I'm sure he won't miss it."
Harry gave him a nod – his arm locking around Malfoy's neck – pulling him closer into a kiss. The night was still young, and hell they weren't ready to leave yet.
Snape let go of him at instance, giving Harry his lung capacity back for any strange reason. He looked at him, his eyes almost draining Harry's soul as he told him: "Do not tell anyone." He vanished into the room, the secret entrance fading at his entrance, leaving Harry cold and alone on the floor.
After Harry took a couple of hours of self-therapy (which meant crying on his own in his dorms while skipping class) he gathered the guts to have a talk with the headmaster. He had a couple of questions containing one crucial. What happened to Draco Malfoy? After half an hour roaming he decided to have a belated tea party with his pity self. When professor Dumbledore wasn't in his office he could be absolutely everywhere. That man could walk through walls - and not just because he was a powerful wizard. Harry fumbled the corners of the Quibbler he'd been trying to read for the last fifteen minutes. Luna had been encouraging him to read the article about Wrackspurts and even offered him a free copy. He couldn't decline. Luna was a generous and good person. Totally suited her name.
"Seriously?" he replied suspiciously. "Just tell me what you are up to. I've got things to do, alright?"
Draco pressed his lips into a sour line, as if he was in true pain, and ripped his eyes off him. "It was an experiment," he spilled, his voice shaky – barely fed with confidence, yet a cry of laughter escaped his throat. "And as I thought..."
"I know a spell that causes one's skin to look as though it is coated in cornflakes. You'd like to see it?" Neville's eyes began to glitter – he loved to impress his friends with his silly skills. "It's..."
Draco was lost, because before he could even finish his sentence, a large groan got audible, and his back writhed without his permission. Harry had covered up the tip of his penis with his lips, and started to press several kisses on it after smirking for just a second – realizing how priceless Draco's expression had been. He loved his naked body. It looked just like pale, precious porcelain.
Ginny dropped her chin, barely able to speak, and scraped her leftovers onto a fork. She didn't seem too happy to see him, for whatever reason possible.
'What is it, Potter?' Draco smirked as soon as he pressed his lips onto those of Harry again. His tune was mocking, and it appeared that Draco desperately wanted to stroke his tongue along the edges of Harry's teeth again.
'Plans changed,' Lucius replied as he moved to the center of the shop and glanced around. Draco followed him shortly after.
Walking up to him he took off his cardigan – his eyes locked onto his, as if ready to attack. Draco was trapped - his back now touching the surface of a large object he couldn't identify. Though fear seemed to spill from the blonde's eyes, he seemed to realize what was about to happen. And Draco walked back up to him – his wand held within the sleeve of his blouse. "Don't talk," Harry muttered right before he took his jaws between his hands. Draco gave a brief nod, their eyes slumbering during their approach, and Harry kissed him once more.
Draco didn't answer. He simply flicked his tongue across his front teeth, and stared at his feet. It was obvious he was ashamed for his bruises. His father beat him to shit, and Harry wondered if this was the actual first time. "That's sick," Harry continued, scratching the back of his head. He expected Lucius to be a difficult father, but not like this. He always presumed him as a coward, and his mother as overly protective. Basically, he thought they were just a couple of spoiled brats. Draco in particular. And there he stood; the blonde, skinny Slytherin student – comparable to a smashed potato.
Harry was unable to move. The questioning expression remained on his face, though now panic glistened his eyes. "What?"
Harry clenched his teeth now, again swallowing away some saliva, and crouched down to pick the ripped-off buttons from the ground. "I'm confused," he muttered. "But yes, I suppose,' he continued– nodding as he hid his face by pointing it towards the ground. "We'll come back later some time. Whatever it is that you need."
"We're bloody fucked," Harry gasped as he pushed himself back on his feet – his back bumping against the walls.
"Professor," Harry muttered - fumbling his hands together. The hall turned quiet, and every eye was set to him. Dumbledore raised his chin, looking down on him – almost judging – but his smile told him otherwise. He pinched Harry's shoulder, walking him to the side of the hall – if just to speak in small privacy, and give others the impression he would get punished.
Harry held his breath, taking a few steps back - fixing his robes as he watched his lover create a distance.
'I'm going to the common room.' She pointed out to her book now and slowly headed away already - though with her body face still facing Harry's. 'I would like to read some of this before the papers will tear out of its binding.'
"I went into a coma. Severe bloodloss got my pressure low. But Professor Snape came. He saved me. If it wasn't for him, I would've died." Malfoy narrowed his eyes, looking down at his scarred enemy – relentless. "Don't you ever dare to say that we were lovers. You're dead to me."
Harry looked at her. He couldn't answer Neville's question. Neither did he know what appeared to be going on. Shrugging, he followed her movements – being taken into Hermione's arms as she sat down next to her. "Leave her be," Harry muttered, even though neither of them made a move to go and get her.
Draco granted him a brief smile, and shook his head as he repositioned himself on his seat. He was well dressed, as usual. Wearing a black suit and shiny shoes – his dark tie neatly tied around his neck. His blouse all buttoned up. "Well spotted," Draco replied as he rubbed his fine hands together. "Tell me how you have been doing."
Once their kiss made it to an end, they both stumbled back – the backs of their hands brushing along their lips, wiping off each other's saliva. Draco looked at him, his eyes spitting fire – as if Harry was to blame, and he didn't like it. Harry avoided any eye contact. Though their kiss was short but firm, he felt rather ashamed – no matter the sweetness of Draco's lips, and the secret desire for more.
Draco clenched his teeth now and pushed Harry away softly, interrupting the brunette's actions before he would actually climax his mouth full, and pulled him up to press him against the desk after – pressing his swollen erection against the boy's bare abdomen, as he passionately started to kiss him on the lips. Draco his whole body shocked and trembled. In almost a rush he started to search for Harry his zipper from his pants, and as soon as he didn't manage it to open it entirely, he just ripped it apart with quite come hostility in his voice. Nevertheless, he smirked shortly after staring at Harry his pink lips, still being able to remember how wonderful they felt. Again he kissed them, biting his lower lip as he shoved his hand into his friend's underpants – all without warning. His warm, sweaty hand clenched itself softly around his companion his erection, and before they both knew it, he started to give him a fast handjob. Harry started to pant as well now, pressing himself closer against Draco as he sank his teeth into his neck. He groaned.
"Ron seemed to have a surprise for you," Hermione continued. Only a few seconds after, Harry opened the bathroom door – a damp steam wriggling amongst him. "You clearly need some sleep," she stated, seeing Harry's hollowed eyes. "Now move. I want to get up early tomorrow. We need to do more packing, and there's a possibility..." She sighed. "Just go to bed. Ron is going crazy on his own." Holding Harry's head, she gave him a brief kiss on his forehead – right next to his scar, surprisingly enough giving his pounding head a rest. "Goodnight."
"We can't," Harry puffed, chewing the insides of his cheek. "And hell, I'm not going to bring you back to that room."
"I still remember this," Harry commented breathlessly as he whipped the tears of his cheeks. "I will never stop remembering this." Harry could hear a weak cry. A cry from a boy he hurt so terribly with a spell he should have never used. He scoffed once more as he took his distance. "You are trying to punish me." He looked at the both of them. "Why are you doing this? The both of you..."
"Harry," Dumbledore smiled at him, his voice soft and blessed by his wisdom. "We both know I'm not here to punish you, but I do wish to know where you've spend the night. We were most worried."
"Motherfu..." Harry groaned as he managed to open his eyes. The room he was in was dark. His glasses were nowhere to be found, and the surface he'd been sleeping on was rock solid. Rubbing his eyes, he hoped to get a better view – perhaps he could find his glasses by touch. Something alive laid to his side, a dash of white jumped up as his eyes managed to adjust – but nothing was clear enough to identify. Once finding his glasses – located a couple of feet afar – he got up from the ground to scan the area. Funny, how he seemed to have forgotten about the way he fell asleep here, last night. His eyes got caught by the white blur laying afar from him, and after crouching down, he recognized the person immediately. Thinking for it to have been a dream, his heart skipped a beat – reality dropping in like a bomb. After creating a certain distance between his enemy, his memory rushed back like a train. It was like he'd been drunk of lust the other night. Blinded by hate by the deceit of his dearest friends, he sought for salvation. And Malfoy was there to give it to him. Malfoy remained sleeping – both of their cardigans spread over his body to keep him warm. Nothing happened that night, beside their make out sessions. The night continued with arguments, ignorance, and mocking comments – though none of them left. Remarkable. It made no sense.
Snape flashed his hand, flattened, veins popping on his forehead – ready to have it crossed Draco's cheek so he'd smack off his stool.
Harry sat down on one of the desks, flicking his tongue as he investigated the callus on the palms of his hands. It had gotten less now he wouldn't practice quidditch as much anymore. "You could stay here with me?" he asked, continuing to look at his hands. A scoff came from the blonde, who stood on the other side of the room watching his reflection in one of the stored mirrors.
Draco scoffed, hardly believing the crap spilling from his tongue. "Now be real," he basically demanded – wishing for the truth.
Harry wanted to throw back another comment, but lost all of his words as soon as he felt the warm adrenaline rushing through his stomach. His voice trembled as he lightly shook his head, and said "I don't."
"I've seen him," he answered at last. "Just for a split second or so." He stuffed his mouth with a grape, probably just to look careless, but got even sicker to his stomach as he experienced the sweet taste. Another sip. If just to flush it down his throat.
Harry quickly nodded - wiping his nose with his sleeve as he walked to the side - another tear drawing down his cheek. "I wish you were a girl."
"Potter! Where have you been?" Snape hissed with a toxic tongue. Harry stumbled on his feet, clamping himself to the corners of the counter to keep himself from falling.
Draco's expression softened, only now realizing they were holding hands the entire time – squeezing out their anger, their palms sweaty at their touch.
"Your shoulder was a little dislocated since your collarbone broke. But it's all fixed up now, dear boy." Madam Pomfrey tapped the bottle of Skele-grow.
"Well, I'm very pleased to know you've given me five minutes of your time to remind me of how terrible I look." Harry got up, gathering his stuff together – flicking his wand so the textbooks would rise and float towards their given spot. "I'm sorry, I've got to go."
Goyle gasped for breath, probably trying to gather as much as audacity as he could. "Locomotor Mortis!"
Harry rushed through the hallways like a ghost – unseen and swiftly, almost like his feet barely touched the ground. He took a moment to rest when he was near the main hall – his cheeks fluttered red by adrenaline and ecstasy. He had to find Malfoy. He had to know what he was up to. Hearing a familiar giggle, he clamped himself against the nearest wall – hiding in a corner to stay hidden. Hermione and Ron came around, both giggling – innocence drooling off their faces.
'Cover me,' Draco replied with a soothing voice – having his eyes shut already as he kept going on even faster by now – though he wasn't using his mouth anymore, but his hand. 'Please.'
The chances of finding Draco wandering through the Dungeons appeared to be small, and since his faithful companion wasn't at his side, it caused even more suspense about his presence in Hogwarts. Could there be a possibility of him being gone already? Did he make his leave without telling anyone? It was hard to say so: his father being a true ass, and way to vulnerable for anyone's opinion. Lucius Malfoy was a man of honour, it would be most awkward if anyone knew about his son's bad business – especially since Harry knew more of it. Though Harry would hardly claim himself as a gay person, he couldn't call himself bisexual either. Never did love occur in his life: unless his failing love for Cho, ending into heartbreak and misunderstandings. They were just friends now: if just because he couldn't afford love. Not during his circumstances. Cho was a wonderful girl, most truly, but too vulnerable. Harry would experience more death, grieve and pain during the trails of his life, and Cho couldn't be a part of it. Not even if he really wanted to. Besides, as said, it was all over now. And for all Harry knew, he was a desperate fellow in need of sexual business – no feelings applied. However, what it was with Draco, he had no clue. Draco had been the one to kiss him, multiple times, and showed his frustrations in a strange way. It caused Harry off guard, and served him sleepless nights with endless rows of questions: unanswered still.
Harry followed as he parted his lips. Once he arrived at the pensive he looked down at the turbulent blue water from afar. Fear glistened his eyes as he tore his glance away - unwilling to grand his memories another piece of his heart.
"I want you to touch me," Draco hissed between his teeth – feeling Harry's hands rushing along the edges of his back. "I want to finally feel you."
Harry pushed the obstacles aside blocking his way – the path towards his sly fellow student seeming a lot longer than it should be, and once he was about to reach his destination, he slipped face flat on the hall pavement. Harry was left with a chipped tooth and a bleeding, swollen lip. Trying his best to crawl back up, friends gathered to give him a hand.
The blonde smirked, and simply shrugged as he pulled back a bit. "Since I finally realize what my real desires are." He smiled. "And I like the drunk you."
Draco rolled his eyes, glancing up the ceiling while squeezing Harry's sweaty hand. The boy seemed drenched by liquor. "Well," the blonde continued. "That means no one will miss you when I take you tonight."
The days came and went. Before Harry took any time to prepare for the holidays, it was soon to be Christmas - and the halls were joyfully dressed with decorations. The choir was singing, each and every day right before lunch, practicing in the Great Hall, and the frogs were out to join them; merry, happy, and full of air. Draco came and went, just like time. Though he did not participate in each and every class, he came around more often - if just to show up between the switch to blow Harry a kiss, or to tug him into the mensroom. Harry decided to let it go, his Christmas plans including Draco. There was no way he would manage to keep the blonde at school, and no matter how much he wished he could, he wouldn't be able to ditch on the Weasleys either - for they were always there for him, and way too keen on having him around at Christmas. And the holiday arrived.
"I don't know. I don't even know where my father is right now. I'm sure he's trying to put some blame on Dumbledore... Seeing his circumstances..."
Another hitch fucked with Harry's voice, and he batted his eyes – not daring to look at Draco now the roles were switched. "I want you too," he replied - his voice raw. "I mean, we need to go Draco." He gasped for air and shook his head. "I don't want to lose you. Not again. And I will once they'll find out we are here."
Goyle toppled over, his face white but his cheeks fluttered by shame and anger. His blood was boiling up to his long-boiled face, ashamed by his missing. Ashamed by his own weak attempt.
Harry sunk back into bed and stared at the ceiling as thousands moments flashed right before his eyes, consuming his soul.
"Hi Harry," a flirting, female voice spoke from behind. Harry looked over his shoulder, watching Romilda Vane passing by – holding the Spella Weekly magazine close to her chest. Harry forced a smile as he awkwardly lifted his hand for a wave. No matted his fierce responds to whatever her silly questions were, she couldn't stop being obsessive about him, as it seemed. Drawing her fingers through her darkened curls, she chuckled as she planned on circling around. Thank Merlin's beard for the distraction coming from her left side – Draco's fellow mates Crabbe and Goyle, looking grumpy as always. "Fatso," Harry smiled as he got up, jumping in front of Crabbe's feet. Looking at Goyle he frowned his brows, disturbed by his sloppy appearance. "Bigfoot... Any of you seen Malfoy?"
"Ew," Ron chuckled as he tossed a comic to the side. "You look like a granny. How long have you been lingering under the shower?"
"Snape has his custody while he's at school. I bet he told him." Her eyes widened. "Don't tell me you have anything to do with that!"
Rogue, it said on the front. Harry wrinkled his nose, trailing backwards as he closed off the window, trying to find his bed with the back of his legs. Ron was downstairs already, and so he was alone. Flipping it, he saw it was sealed with a Malfoy's wax stamp, dark and leaked – as if it was stamped with a rush with just a simple various D scrabbled on the inner corner of the envelope as soon as he snapped it open.
"Blimey Harry," Ron sighed as he crouched aside him. He couldn't suppress his laughter. "What were you thinking?"
Their seconds were valuable. Even though Lovegood asked Longbottom to keep his nose out of other peoples business, he couldn't keep his nose from doing so anyways now he was empowered by love.
Harry gulped and dropped his head as he sighed. "Professor Snape," he replied - not to greet but to state.
Snape allowed him to finish speaking, yet disarmed him with a spell once the last vowel left his mouth. "How dare you to raise your wand at me." Strange, how even now the tune of his voice barely changed. Ever so slow, ever so waspish.
Harry smirked and fixed his collar. "Fine by me. I still have to pass through that front door, though. I'm sure you can help me out?"
"You started it," Harry continued - unimpressed. "I'd say it was some guilty fantasy of yours, and during the heat of the moment you just..." A cheeky grin crossed his lips. "...revealed your inner self."
"What do you know about it?" Draco loosened up his tie, rushing his fingers through his hair. "Don't tell me you have any idea of what you're talking about."
After seeing his two best friends together, enjoying exploring each other's bodies; finding joy by each others touch – something simply snapped. Harry could barely afford any joy. His life had been a rollercoaster the very moment his mother gave birth to him – and he needed more than that. He wanted to feel alive. No matter the times he cheated death, no one could compare their lives to his. No one could ever call his youth a childhood. Death lingered inside the palms of his sweaty hands, and all his loved ones were a necessary meant to end.
No matter the riddles of which the blonde spoke, Harry felt rather good at last. No matter his lingering headache. After he got dressed himself, he took is time to find the showers to freshen up. Cum stained against his body-hair, and no matter the effort it took to get it off, he couldn't help but smirking along the way. The experience was strange and nerve wracking, but all the same he wanted more. He was in love, if not just with his body.
"I am so sorry, Harry. I wish we could tell you different. I am saddened to inform you that I've had you obliviated in the past. Professor Snape and I decided this was the only way to keep you on the right tracks. We have decided to tell you this today because..."
Harry drew his chin, clenching his jaw once he met Snape's eyes. "It is mainly you, it seems. And his father. Don't you tell me what to do!"
A shiver ran down Harry's spine. Though the words they shared were few, it was enough to keep him both excited and curious. Walking down the steps, they headed for the boathouse: the underground harbour where they stored the boats for the first year arrives. Once arriving there, they headed up the stairs; entering the Bell Tower – the both of them lifting their wands to create bulbs of light.
"I've seen you two." Harry looked at him, curious to whatever his response would be, and he raised a brow. "The other night. Don't pretend it didn't happen."
"Shouldn't you eat, Harry?" Luna smiled at him – rubbing his back in all of the sudden. Though Harry appreciated her effort, he gestured her to stop as he straightened his back.
"This is my place," she yelped as he approached him – studying his body like she was a kid feeding her eyes in a sweetshop. "That's blood," she marked, pursing her lips to hide a smile.
Harry clenched his fists, yet granted him a thankful nod. Exactly knowing where to find him at last. If he just thought about it sooner...
"I do. I do understand." Harry used his elbows to get up, adjusting his glasses behind his ears. "You're afraid. You're afraid he'll make you leave if you fuck it up once more."
Harry showed his teeth, happy for those who'd been granted with love – as for he. His body still fed on Malfoy's lips, and he wanted more.
"Well fuck you," Ron growled as he bowed his head. Harry clenched his jaws, grabbing his bag – yet not to grab his books.
The blonde shrugged. The both of them seemed to be rather defeated. Confused by their gathering. He wanted to understand him, Harry repeated in his head. Whatever that meant.
A sweet voice entered his ears from up close. Luna Lovegood dressed up like a poison ivy held his hand what caused him to turn. "You seem worried?"
Harry's eyes became awfully small. No matter what he meant to say with that, it got his stomach turning. The taste of his lips remained on his tongue, and though it was venom, he wanted more.
Draco shoved over, his hand touching the cold wooden floor beneath their beds, fetching his glasses in a flick.
Harry placed his wand on the floor, lifting his arms once more before he kicked it away as well – leaving himself defenceless. "Feel any better now?"
"I haven't seen you in a while," he muttered as he scratched the back of his head - messing up his white, neatly cut hair. "You've been avoiding me."
"We are at the room of hidden things," Draco continued, as a reply on his former question. He was trying to be a smart ass. "I mean were are we at. What do you want?"
Professor Snape seemed to pretend as if he didn't hear it. He stiffly continued his walk, yet a single hesitation seen as Harry cleared his throat and visibly stumbled on his feet. Snape's back raised black and tall from the whitened pavers, his feet invisible as his gigantic cloak followed his movements. It was almost scary. It frightened him, seeing Snape here, and not with Draco – being his favourite caretaker of all time, and in great debt of the Malfoy's community. Harry knew he'd been a death eater, if not still. Harry ran after him, trying to hold on to his swift pass as he tried not to look too eager or desperate. Nevertheless, Snape didn't stop. No matter the sound of Harry's sneakers hitting the stone floor.
"This is the hide out," Harry remarked once he walked further. "I've been here before, once. Don't bother to ask me, I don't remember."
"You don't," Draco continued. "I just want you to know that no matter what I say or what I do. I love you, and I always will. It's just a lot more complicated than we wish to believe."
Draco threw a glance down at him now, his eyes spitting fire as his entire head got red like a tomato by now – mostly all because of feeling incredibly shy and embarrassed.
"Because we've got to go to bed?" Harry raised his brows, surprised by his remarkable question, and he pushed him off. Draco turned his back on him, scratching his chest, fumbling his neck – unaware of the amount of hickeys. "We can sleep here?" Draco suggested. Harry scoffed.
Grabbing his blouse and cardigan, he rushed himself towards the exit. Leaving Malfoy for "dead". He wished to see the looks on his fellow student's faces. If anyone had been celebrating his absence – Draco Malfoy clearly not being one of them – he was ready to cut it off now. Making his way towards his dorms – trying his best to stay unseen for as many as he could – he quickly changed to a new shirt, leaving his cardigan to rest on his bed. Malfoy's smell still lingered around him – and the cardigan wearing him would enlarge it. Dizzy by his scent, he wobbled towards the great hall – ready to meet his mates.
Harry batted his eyes, smiling as they walked over towards the Hogwarts express on a slow pass. "Much," he replied as he threw her a look. "I've missed it. Though I really appreciate the Weasley's hospitality, I think – for now – Hogwarts is the only place I can really call home."
"About what?" the others asked at the exact same time. "Excuse me Harry," Hermione cut through as she stepped to the side. "You've been acting strange. What has been going on your mind? Where on earth have you been?"
"All my life I've been trying to make my father proud. All my life I've been doing endless shit to make everyone proud. Becoming a great Slytherin Perfect. And you know? I would've gotten there already. I would've become the best fucking student, if it weren't for you fucking everything up each and every time."
Harry stared at him, his lips pressed into a sour line – unable to speak now hatred and self-blame caused his lungs to cringe. "I know," he replied at last – shaking his head, wiping away the tears off his chin. "I know... And I'm sorry for that."
"You are ready to do anything if just for a little bit of attention, or appreciation. Even from me. No matter how fucking queer the requirements." Draco brushed his thumb along his lower lip, almost as if he relived their first encounter – tasting Harry's blood on his tongue. Harry decided to make his way to wherever his safe haven could be, and snorted – trying his best to run away from his own fears.
Harry didn't reply. He simply looked at him, his lips sealed and his hands slightly sweaty. They exchanged looks. Their eyes met each other's, going down to their lips, and looking up again. Harry couldn't breathe. For far too long he'd been looking at his enemy; finding no joy but hate, and now... He felt in love. That thought hit his stomach, and without realizing how close their lips were from touching; he pulled back to wipe his mouth. "I'm sorry." Harry shook his head. "Forgive me. You've been making it hard for me. I cannot withhold myself from asking the same question over and over again, knowing your answer could differ per day."
"Will we do this again?" Harry muttered without any realization. The blonde looked at him at instance – mesmerized. With great hesitation, he cocked his head – blinking, as if he seemed unsure of whatever to answer. "Yes, I think we will..."
"Bloody hell, Harry!" Ron jerked his arm - shuffling back to Hermione, as if she was any safer to sit next to. "Mild concussion my ass."
Funny, how Professor Snape trusted Harry to stay well seated without peaking into any of his personal stuff. Obviously he was bound to keep his hands to himself, knowing Draco Malfoy was the greatest snitch of all time.
'Blaming the school huh,' Draco grinned as he cocked his head – gazing up from under his blonde long eyelashes.
"Fuck off," Draco scowled – his fist hitting the wooden wall behind him. "I'm so fucking done with your bullshit. Why you? You aren't special. Yes, you survived, but in return you allowed your friends to die. That's not legendary. It's fucking selfish, and I'm done with the praising."
"I thought you left?" Harry snorted, trying to keep his sweaty fists from shaking. "What a horrible night to be refused for a dance." He seemed pissed. The slender boy didn't reply or move. Standing in front of a wall torch, the only movements were the shadows on the walls – making him rather sad now shadows fell down on his mask. Harry pursed his lips, lifting his chin as he waited for a voice.
. Granted being a speaker in the Department of Education is not the same as being Minister for Magic but come on!’ Hermione explodes, her hair finally deflating a little. Harry wonders if her magic makes it do that. There is a moment of quiet simply filled with Hermione’s frustrated breathing. 'Did you know he's 80 years old? Why someone hasn't made him retire yet is beyond me.' She sighed, rubbing her face in exasperation.
‘I’m going to be sick.’ Ron gags dramatically, finger splayed against his chest in shock. ‘You and Ginny- just wrong, it’s-it’s like incest it is. You’re my honorary brother, she’s my sister, just-‘ He gags again. Harry laughs, no matter how many times Ron had called him that it still warmed his heart. Not long after the war, the Weasleys had announced over dinner that no matter what had happened Ginny and Harry or what may happen between Ron and Hermione, they would always be honorary Weasleys. There may have been a few teary eyes as they revealed their new clock with two additional hands. The Harry and Hermione hands rested by home along with the other Weasleys, excepting Charlie who was seemingly in a forest and Percy who was of course at work. Fred’s picture stayed in its place above George’s as everyone agreed that wherever George was Fred’s spirit was nearby.
'Oh you don’t turn down this kind of an offer, like this is a big deal.’ Ron insisted, looking at her as though she were mad for even suggesting turning the offer down.
‘Harry, you will not believe the nonsense I dealt with today from wizards who should know better.’ Hermione huffed as she came into the room. She let her bag drop from her shoulder onto the floor. The sound of heavy books and wads of parchment falling echoed in the large room. She winced. ‘I’m so sorry!’ She sighed, looking at her bag mournfully.
‘Oh, Harry.’ She sighed. There was a comfortable silence between the pair for a moment. ‘So, you want to do it then?’
He looked up at the clock on the mantel. Hermione should be home soon, followed by Ron within an hour. He tried to swell the pang of guilt he felt at not having a particulalry difficult 9 to 5 job like the other two. He’d been unemployed for a fair time before his current job but he was financially stable enough that he didn’t need to work for a while. This house was his own, there was little he needed to pay for and much of that was either free or heavily discounted. Hermione had said that this feeling was simply a product of doing a job you enjoy and that her mum had often felt like that. She had rattled on that if you love your job you never work a day in your life, but it hadn't made Harry feel that much better. He and Ron had both applied for Auror training, about 6 months after the war, when they had allowed themselves to sleep and eat and emotionally recharge at least a little. Or at least, that’s what Ron had done and Harry had lied to himself about doing. When the physical test had come a few weeks into the application process Harry had failed. He’d seen the awkward look on the trainer's face as he failed to meet the minimum weight restriction and had failed some of the physical strength tests. He sympathised with the poor guy, no doubt it was difficult to tell the saviour of the Wizarding World that he wasn't strong enough. At the time he had been disheartened, hoping that perhaps they would make an exception for him, but they hadn’t. Looking back he was glad.
‘One they want to do of us.’ Harry clarified. ‘Some place, uhhh Horse something museum.’ He added, trying to remember the name. Ron freezes. Harry blinks, the subject is serious if it moves Ron to stop eating.
‘Oh leave him alone Ron, he likes formal dinners.’ Hermione sighed but there was no annoyance behind it. They start the trek to the fourth floor, all the while Ron complains that there ‘ain’t nothing formal about us eating’.
‘Percy lost another file?’ Harry asks with a frown. That wasn’t like the pencil-pushing perfectionist he knew. Ever since Percy has taken over the Department of Personnel Records, the department had been praised to no end for its organisation and efficiency.
‘Hey, fame and glory?’ Harry frowned before pointing at himself. ‘Already got that.’ Hermione rolled her eyes in fond disapproval.
‘What’s happened now?’ Harry sighed feeling himself sink so far back into the settee he was mildly concerned it may actually be eating him alive and he just been slow to notice. No doubt if he relaxed any further, he’d find himself being digested.
‘Yeah but like what if one of them gets damaged or something.’ He insisted, wringing his fingers nervously. Hermione patted his hand. He knew it was probably silly, to project his fear of losing his friends onto a painting, but it had just been so hard after the war. During the war, he had had to attempt to mentally prepare himself for loss, and while he deeply feared it, he knew in his heart the probability of losing Ron or Hermione was high. After Voldemort died, he found that while the chances of them dying was so much slimmer now, he was still just ad afraid if not more.
Ginny had later admitted that whilst she deeply cared about Harry her feelings did seem to be more of crush that she grew too attached to. But things like that happen during war. People need something to hold onto, and if that thing the thought of a relationship with someone they care for, then who could begrudge them that? It was a romance they need at the time, but when the world settled around them and they quickly realised it was both not the right time and perhaps never will be. They had a fairly amicable breakup all things considered. Of course, a few Weasley dinners had been awkward in the beginning, Molly attempting to disguise her disappointment and Harry and Ginny trying to show that they were fine with each other in a way that felt overacted and a little forced. Sometimes people just didn’t fit when they once might have. That’s life.
Though breakfast was about to come to an end, Harry knew he would be able to gobble at least some scrambled eggs – right before his class would start.
"Sorry," Harry continued as he investigated the shades of blood on the flowery patterned handkerchief. "I was thinking."
A shiver ran down from both their heads to their spine. Hermione turned, her cheeks fluttering red – her eyes set to kill. Miming something, Ron turned his head – biting his lower lip as he dropped his quill, not willing to continue his leftover homework. Hermione hid her head behind her curls, her head glowing by hatred and shame – flipping through her homework with her famous stubborn attitude.
"You piece of shit!" Goyle staggered, lifting his fists ready to throw a punch. Crabbe clamped on to his arms, pulling him down before he managed to strike. Harry stumbled backwards, confused by their pointless reactions – knowing they were never bright enough to see the names as an insult.
"Again," Ron barked as he looked at him. "As if it's been only you suffering year after year after year. I was there too, Harry. Hermione was there. Neville was there, Seamus got almost kicked off school because his mother saw you as a threat. Because you are the chosen one doesn't mean shit. We all experience the same shit."
Harry cocked his head, frowning deeply. Was he asked to come for a silly chitchat? Like he could care. His wand hidden in the sleeve of his jumper, he wrinkled its hem between his fingers – nervous, no matter the circumstances.
Draco brushed his fingers down his chin, and took his black briefcase – ready to leave the train, knowing this had been a bad idea. He quickly loosened the tie, shame taking over him, and took his first step to leave. "Get your balls out off your ass, Potter."
"Just chill out," Harry whispered – making a trail of kisses down to the edge of the blonde's pants, and boxers since they stuck out above the edge of his pants just a bit. Draco clenched his fingers around the edge of the wooden desk, squeezing his lips together to leave a groan behind – thinking his moans would be worse than the one Harry squeezed out before.
"It's just through here," Draco smiled once he gave him a glimpse from over his shoulder. They ended up in an empty classroom. The same one where it all started about a year ago. Harry leaned onto one of the bookshelves, out of breath, as he tried to steady his messed-up glasses on the bridge of his nose. "Fuck," he breathed, wiping the sweat of his brow. He drew his eyes towards the blonde boy who seemed to be perfectly fine. "How on earth are you not out of breath. Damn..."
"There you are," a familiar voice cut through. Harry turned, seeing Draco's reflection in a few of the mirrors. Their eye contact wasn't secured. In fact, he wasn't even sure whether he was looking at a reflection, an illusion, or a real person. "I thought you fled," Harry commented – lifting his chin almost victoriously. "I knew you were here. You've been trying to get inside my head." Harry flinched at a hand on his shoulder, and threw a glance – meeting Draco's face rather near. "I am proud," Draco replied – his voice light yet somewhat damaged. "It took you long, Potter." His normal attitude showed itself. "I want to know where I'm at," Harry muttered as he followed Draco's movements impatiently. Draco circled around him, a piano started to play in distance, and Harry raised his brow in return. "I am not really in a dating mood, if you don't mind."
"This isn't helping," Harry eventually continued as he walked away. His eyes scanned the room as if he'd never seen it before, and he clenched his teeth. "I want to know what's been going on lately." He turned once more to look professor Dumbledore in the eye. "Someone should know. I'm starting to question my sanity."
A sweeping noise got audible, and before Harry knew what was happening, a row of textbooks dropped down from the shelves - right in front of his feet. It was more of a small explosion that had been caused by Draco's spell nearly hitting Harry's head what had probably been the intention.
"-Or you," Harry added rather serious. The blonde batted his eyes, squeezing his hand while a pensive expression drew along his face.
The day came slowly to an end. After ignoring both of his best friends, not even granting them a single look, he scattered through the castle with his head held low. Hurt by the way his dearest friends kept him a secret, he decided to visit Hagrid around tea-time, thinking he could help him off his jealousy. Hargid was most famous for his loneliness, it seemed, and appeared to handle well during most circumstances. Maybe he could ease his pain, if just by serving him a small mug of gin. Hagrid made those mistakes before. Why not again? Though Harry barely liked the taste of alcohol, it took ease of the weight he carried on his shoulders – and it would numb his tastebuds in time anyway. Though his visit was short, and no alcohol came to it, it definitely gave him the capability to vent out his heart, and just talk.
"Come for me," Draco groaned – their foreheads touching. Harry looked up at him, his eyes merely opened; his body trembling under his touch, his nails digging down into Draco's back. "I will," Harry managed to stuttered as he blew his load – his cum covering the both of them. Draco kissed him, biting down his lower lip until he bled, and he came; their shimmering, porcelain bodies sticking together.
Harry shrugged – unsure to open his mouth, surprised how Hermione seemed to have forgotten the way he busted them the other night.
Draco leaned against the desk, having put on his shirt already though he couldn't close it since it had no buttons left.
Harry held his breath – his eyes wide open as Draco too again his lead; opening the buttons of Harry's trousers like an eagle going for its prey. His breathing got faster, his palms went sweaty, and at the slightest touch near his private parts he flinched – his back quickly covered in sweat.
Draco wrinkled his nose by annoyance. "Of course you didn't," he mocked. "The famous Potter. A legend. And for what?"
"Harry?" Hermione spoke as he hovered above his desk. She searched for eye contact. "You look terrible, are you okay?"
Draco scoffed, serving him a grin before he moved down – placing his attention elsewhere. Grabbing the hems of Harry's trousers, he pulled them down – no longer willing to talk. He wanted action, just as much as he did. Harry flinched once more, his head heavy and warm – as if he'd been standing upside-down for too long. He wanted to stop him, hold his hands, take action himself – if just because he felt too strange to let the blonde to anything to him first. Draco held him, grabbing his cock as he bit down his lip – pulling his roots to keep Harry down – resulting for him to groan in vain.
Draco looked at him for a second, wanting to reply, but tore away his eyes and left - leaving Harry standing near the gate.
Hermione cocked her head, surprised but worried. She knew how easily he could get into troubles, but doing terrible things, what was that supposed to mean? "Tell me," Hermione gasped as he crossed her arms. Harry bowed his head further down, shaking no. "Tell me Harry."
"Could you open?" he replied as he dragged his stuff along. Ginny pushed open the door, stepping aside to let him through.
"Professor Dumbledore?" Harry called as he turned up his speed. "Professor?" He called once more, wiggling between the students that ruined his sight - as if a force didn't want them to catch up. "Professor! Professor Dumbledore!?" Harry was no longer walking. Right now he was running - pushing people to the sides as he watched Dumbledore vanish around the corner. "Professor, Wait!"
Harry got sucked away, in the end thrown out of a dusty fireplace, and he coughed as he rolled over to his eyes – not daring to open his eyes just yet. Had it gone wrong again? After all these years of no-trouble-traveling? He gritted his teeth, took off his glasses, and rubbed his eyes as he tried to breathe through his with dust stuffed nose. He was quite lucky though. At least his glasses weren't broken this time.
"Fuck," Harry groaned as he threw his head back, his nails digging into Draco's back. "You're driving me shit crazy."
"Ginny," Neville gasped once he made his way. Ginny fled from Harry's escape, dropping her body into Neville's arms now. Longbottom took her in, throwing Harry a pensive look before he spoke. "I think it might be better for you to leave, Harry."
"Please not now, Nick." Harry gritted his teeth together, almost stumbling over his own feet, and took the corner sharp. "I'm looking for..."
"I love you too..." came from the other side of the bed after a few minutes of silence. But Harry was already fast asleep...
Once the realization came there was no solid light source around, Harry grabbed his wand and flicked it – using Lumos, if just to find the flaws on the edges of Draco's skin. They both narrowed their eyes. Their lips burned after kissing for approximately half an hour, and the both of them noticed the happenings inside their own pants. The tension caused their teeth on edge. The eager to curse at each other became stronger every minute – if just by the way they seemed so used to. Never they could have thought for this to happen. The both of them, laying down onto a desk – shirtless, investigating each other's body, though their lower parts were still forbidden area. Harry suppressed the sensation boiling in his abdomen. The tip of his tongue rushed along the edges of Malfoy's teeth as he twisted his head, hands full of hair forcing the blonde to come closer. Their legs were interlocked. Malfoy on top, the tip of his nose brushing against Harry's cheekbone as he begged for more – his lips doing the talking without a sound.
P.s A personal declaration of thanks to you. My niece was enrolled in Hogwarts during the war and my family owes you a debt of gratitude for her safe return.
Ron finally came home half an hour later looking tired. He slouched in, kissed Hermione’s cheek and slid into the chair. ‘I am exhausted.’ He sighs. ‘They had me do the bloody fitness test
‘Don’t ask Harry.’ Ron shrugged. ‘He’s gay.’ Harry was pulled away from his thoughts. He wondered if Ron had noticed a hint of darkness in his expression. He wondered if he’d said it because he knew it would pull Harry back into the room.
‘It does.’ Hermione nods. ‘I must admit the idea is alluring. You remember just how much the portrait at Hogwarts helped us when we needed it.’
Harry sank back into the sickeningly plush green settee in Grimmauld Place and looked down at the letter in his hand. He had to admit he almost hadn’t opened it. The enchanted chest in the study held far too many letters that he had never gotten around to opening. Of course, any howlers had found themselves incinerated without a second thought but within the first week, he’d received two sacks full of letters. Of course, the house still had some level of secrecy surrounding the address but the lucky letters that actually made it to him were dropped on the pavement outside. Harry had quickly opened an official postage address at Twit To-Who Owlery in Diagonal Alley to stop the muggles next door from becoming suspicious. Sadly this meant he got even more post than he had before as this address became public knowledge. Ron and Hermione, who had moved in with him after the war, also had all their correspondence sent there, it was just easier that way.
'Were you spying on us again?' Harry asked, unsure why he was even bothering to ask. They'd offered him a position in the Hogwarts kitchens but somehow Harry couldn't help but feel like taking the elf from his beloved home was a bit cruel. Of course, then Hermione had tried to start paying him, an idea that he had refused on multiple occasions. In the end, Hermione just started handing him envelopes of money each month. Kreacher had simply sorted away into a drawer he called the Mistress's Savings. Harry and Ron never told her about the drawer, agreeing it was the path of least resistance to let her think she was paying him.
‘Madame who now?’ Ron asked, returning to his plate of food, seemingly over some of his initial shock.
‘Oh...of who?’ Ron replies, tone suggesting he thought that whatever this conversation was it didn't sound more interesting than Quidditch.
‘I’m bisexual, Ron. Telling yourself I’m gay doesn’t mean I didn’t have sex with Ginny.’ He retorts, smirking at the sickened face Ron pulls. Hermione giggled. Ah, Ginny, that had been a short-lived romance. After the war, Harry had barely been in any kind of state to speak to his closest friends let alone kindling a relationship with someone. She had understood, of course, but their relationship couldn’t survive the weird stasis it fell into the months after the war. It was not that they grew apart per se, they had barely seen each other for the entirety of the war after all. It was more like they just never managed to grow romantically close enough in the first place.
‘Our portraits would be able to visit each other in separate frames.’ She says softly, her eyes warm.
Of course, sadly the damage wasn’t solely to the social fabric of Wizarding society. The damage was physical. There had been days you could hardly walk through Diagon Alley, the streets filled with business owners and volunteers casting desperate spells at fire-damaged shop fronts. People who had been too scared to leave their homes for the past year or so weaving between workers carrying crates of stock deliveries back into the shops. Not to mention the state Hogwarts had been in. Harry had only been back to the castle once since the battle, and he often debates if that had been a mistake. He and Ron had gone to speak to McGonagall, partly looking for advice on potentially applying to an Auror program but mostly to check she was ok. She had smiled at him before giving him a once over and tutting softly before promptly opening a small wooden box of biscuits and sliding it closer towards him.
‘You have an obsessive personality type you know you do mate and you know how Perth always bangs on about rest.’ Ron insisted. Harry pretended not to notice the small smile that touched Hermione’s lips as Ron parroted her words from the other week.
‘Oh, hold onto your Pygmy puffs Harry Potter, it gets worse.’ She adds almost hysterically. ‘Then awful Brenda Patterson says, “I don’t think that would be quite appropriate” and I think, thank god she’s finally said something I can agree with, but then she adds “the last thing we want to do is distract young wizards. They are the future of this government after all.”’ Hermione screws up her face and feints a haughty inflexion as she recites the conversation. Her hair seemed to increase in volume slightly.
‘Yeah, a golden trio poster as the paper would say.’ Harry snorted. Hermione quirked her lip and rolled her eyes. Harry almost couldn’t decide if it had been worse when the press adored him or hated him. In the few months following the war there had been so many ‘heart-warming’ stories and adoring articles it had been almost ridiculous. Articles detailing the stories of their triumphs to multiple pages on Harry’s favourite kind of sweets. Even stories that hadn’t involved Harry directly, a fan club showing off their ‘our golden trio’ tattoos and an entire ward in the St Mungo’s Maternity Hospital naming their sons Harry. The idolisation was frankly sickening at times. Then, of course, things mellowed out after a while. However, Harry’s relief had been short-lived as the Prophet kindly outed him in an expose two months ago.
‘In the same painting?’ He nods. ‘Hmm I don’t really know.’ She answered thoughtfully. ‘There were plenty of group portraits in Hogwarts as well as those with a single subject.’
The corner of Harry’s mouth twitched, she had done this for as long as he could remember. Apologising to books, thanking them, bargaining with those she didn’t understand. It would seem mad if it was anyone but Hermione. Harry couldn’t help but remember the time Hermione accidentally ripped a page almost clean out of a book and the meltdown that followed. She had been inconsolable, despite the fact that it was perhaps one of the cheapest mass-produced muggle textbooks Harry had ever seen. There was no doubt literally thousands of identical copies of that book and yet she sulked and didn’t rest until she found the right charm to protect it against any further damage. No doubt it was the most indestructible book on Earth, and it had been about native birds of the Caribbean of all things. Hardly crucial information in her line of work. Why she had been reading it God only knows, but as Ron often says if there are words on paper Hermione has read them.
‘Ok, Harry?’ She asked. Harry nodded slowly. ‘Right ok, let’s figure out when we’re next free and Harry can owl them tomorrow with a meeting time and date.’ She concluded. ‘I think they’d like to hear it from you best.’ She added apologetically as Harry sighed. He really didn’t like sending letters, not since Hedwig. Their new owl, Albert, a screech owl they'd bought from Mr Thorwick, was a lovely bird but it just wasn't the same without her. The act he'd once valued had lost some of its charm. Now it was just a chore, something he had once enjoyed but couldn't, like his brain had forgotten how to.
He’d also spoken to portraits of Snape and Dumbledore during his visit. The pair seemed to natter on with each other like a pair of old biddies, Harry found it frankly bizarre to see the pair so chummy but heartwarming none the less. He knows the portraits aren’t really alive, they’re not the people Harry actually knew. He knew those people were gone but the portraits seemed to have feelings and he for one was glad they were happy. The warmth he felt from the interaction with the three headmasters quickly vanished though as they walked past several house elves and a volunteer wizard attempting to fix a gaping hole in one of the castle walls. That had been where he’d seen first Lavender Brown’s body, her throat torn and bloody. He doesn’t remember much after that. The was a swell of panic and sweat and the next thing he knew he and Ron were outside Grimmauld place. They had looked at each other, both wanting to say something that would bring the other peace. But neither knew what to say, so they said nothing. He hadn’t been back since. Too many ghosts.
‘Yeah, George reckons it’s a girl.’ He grumbled. ‘Says the only other time he’s ever seen him lose track of stuff like that was when he fancied that Herbology substitute professor, you remember her Harry?’ He nodded to the other man with a quirk of his lip.
‘Heathers only had a 84% rate and he played in 3 World Cup finals in ‘86, ‘88 and ‘90.’ Ron said pointedly, spearing a carrot with his fork. ‘Mate, just think fame and glory of a quidditch champion.’ He added dreamily.
‘Do you think we’ll all be together?’ He asked thoughtfully. His mind drifted back to the headmaster’s office all those months ago and Dumbledore and Snape chatting together happily.
‘Is it well known?! It's only like the most famous attraction in London. Every kid has been there.’ He cried in disbelief. Well someone had better tell Buckingham Palace that, Harry thought as he tried to bite back a sigh. Ron always seemed to forget he and Hermione grew up in Muggle homes. He had one time confessed that he often forgot that he hadn’t known them since they were toddlers. Like they had always been there, as though falsely inserted into his pre-Hogwarts childhood memories. ‘It's full of famous witches and wizards from bloody centuries back. You can see ‘em and they tell you stories and you have photos with 'em.’
‘Would you like some pumpkin juice? Ron got you some yesterday.’ He asked, heaving himself from the settee’s clutches with considerable effort.
He was almost surprised but how quickly his mind had made itself up. He adored flying, that was never in doubt, he was good at it and it was just enough of a risk to his life to be interesting. One fire call later he was in training to become a professional seeker. He had spent months training his legs, core and forearms, shocked at the difference the strength he developed made to his gameplay. His PT had him doing a tonne of stretching and yoga to increase his flexibility and range of motion. Harry has been fairly mortified to find that he hadn’t been able to even touch his toes before he’d begun training. The team became friendly with him in a quick but genuine way and for the first time in years, Harry made new friends. Now, in the run-up to the qualifiers for the World Cup, he spent half of his time training on the pitch or at home going over strategy notes. He was under strict instructions to look after himself and not exhaust himself through overtraining. So here he was. Sat on a cushy sofa, feeling like he’d done nothing all day.
Harry had been hounded with sycophantic letters, talking about their goals in office, their admiration for him, and everything they had in common. They were the equivalent of a guidance counsellor sitting on a chair backwards and trying to relate to you and the whole thing made Harry feel super awkward. All too many of them came to Harry asking for support, for him to publicly state his preference for Kinsey Harrow to be Minister, for Tilda Buggle to be head of the Wizengamot. Even at one point a plea to announce his support for Barry Hampstead to be head of the Wizarding Public Food Health and Safety committee. Harry hadn't been quite sure why anyone would think he'd have any particular influence in the culinary industry, it wasn't like he'd killed Voldemort with an allergen labelled baguette after all. He'd hid very quickly from Mr Hampstead and hoped never to run into him again.
‘I think we’d be better off in the same portrait.’ He said, more thinking out loud than speaking to his friend. ‘Then- well we’d always be together wouldn’t we.’ He shrugged. She smiled at him warmly.
‘Well.’ Hermione huffs, dropping beside Harry. ‘You know that awful Medford guy I told you about, big beard and talks about “girls muggle tennis” with so much enthusiasm it feels improper.’ She waves her fingers in quotation. Harry nodded, feeling slightly alarmed. Hermione’s hair was far fluffier than it had been when she left the house, that only meant one thing: rage. ‘Well, he had the absolute nerve to motion, while we're not even talking about school attire, in front of the entire committee that he thinks that tennis miniskirts should be added to uniforms across all Wizarding schools.’ Harry grimaced.
despite the fact I’ve been out of Auror Training a month now. Must have lost the record he said. If the prick wasn’t my brother, I’d say it was personal.’
‘So you’re voting yes Ron?’ Hermione asked, pointing at him with her signature ‘I’m Hermione Granger and I’m taking action’ body language.
‘A portrait?’ She frowned. Harry didn’t even react to the frightening speed in which she had absorbed the page of information.
Thank you for your service. I am writing to inform you that the Horskin Museum of Wizarding Portraiture desires the honour of displaying a portrait of you in our new wing. As I am sure you are aware a position in this historical museum is very prestigious and preserves your achievement through the many peaceful years to come. We request a meeting with Miss Granger, Mr Weasley and yourself in order to discuss the details of your depiction and scheduling for sessions.
He’d been doing this for almost three months and was finally sleeping a little more peacefully when Ginny mentioned that The Gillyweed Guards, an up and coming Quidditch team coached by Chuddly Cannons ex-beater Arty Perth, was looking for a seeker. Evidently his interest in the team did not go unnoticed by Ginny as she invited him to watch their next game and made introductions. Arty was a tall attractive blond with a blinding smile beneath his very crooked nose. He’d informed the pair that night in a nearby pub that their current seeker was going to be leaving the team within the next 6 months to a year, depending on the speed at which her father's health declined, and they were looking to train her replacement with a few months to spare before World Cup qualifier matches. Harry had told Arty about his experience quickly followed by his current health and how long it had been since he’d flown. The man had nodded, giving Harry a once over and telling him he looked pretty good already. Harry had tried not to blush, as the coach continued to inform him that not only could the club provide personal training specific for quidditch players but they could give him the opportunity to fly on a pretty big pitch whenever he liked. He had agreed to think about it, and sat in the kitchen staring at the wall for a long time before realising he’d made the decision sat in the pub.
‘Hmm?’ He almost jumped, pulled from his thoughts suddenly. ‘Oh, I hadn’t really thought about it loads, I guess. If it was just me, I would probably just throw the letter away but, the three of us.’ He mused. ‘I kinda like the idea of immortalising our friendship, if that makes sense.’
‘Kind of like Madame Tussaud’s?’ Hermione mused, sharing a knowing look with Harry. Ah, they’ve played this game before, Wizarding childhood vs muggle childhood culture clash. It wasn’t strictly what Harry would call an issue but their culture clash came up pretty often in the years they’d known each other. It was usually minor things, childhood references, cultural norms things like that. No matter how long Harry and Hermione had lived as wizards it was hard not to feel left out sometimes around purebloods. It felt like being out of the loop like they had missed something in a conversation that made a punchline funny. Of course, there were also times that Ron must have felt out of his depth when the pair spoke about muggle things or they all visited muggle London. The pair had made the mistake one time of informing Ron that one of his beloved childhood books was a rip off a muggle book released almost 5 years earlier once. The names ‘Conrad the Charming ChooChoo’ and ‘Thomas the Tank Engine’ were no longer allowed to be spoken in the house.
‘Horskin Museum of Portraiture?’ He asks through a mouth full of potato. No doubt a normal person would find him hard to understand, but the pair had been suffering through hearing, and sadly seeing, Ron talk with his mouthful since they were 11. Harry nodded, subconsciously leaning back with a wary look in his eye. He’d had his fair share of food spat at him by a surprised Ron in his time. ‘Oh my god.’ He swallowed, blinking in shock.
'No Master Harry, Kreacher was simply dusting at the other end of the hallway.' Kreacher replied waving his dusting rag before turning back down the hall. 'Perhaps Kreacher wouldn't have heard if the Mistress and Master spoke with indoor voices.' He added under his breath as he walked away. Harry sighed.
It had been almost two years since the war, although at times it felt like yesterday he had stood in the crumbling corridors of his only real childhood home. Of course, the Wizarding world was still trying to heal itself from the damage Voldemort and his followers had inflicted, but things were getting better, and that had to count for something. There was so much corruption in so many different areas of the Ministry, it reminded Harry of a really big box of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans. Sure there were some lovely strawberry, popcorn and lemon drizzle cake beans in the Ministry but there were still a fair few rusty nail, rotten banana and baby shampoo beans as well. This lead to a lot of firing, promoting and hiring in the Ministry in the months following, as every corrupt job needed a replacement. Worst of all were the officials that required public or Wizengamot election.
"I would've told you if I couldn't handle it. But I can, because I have no feelings for Hermione whatsoever. She's like my fucking sister. We've been friends for so long!"
Everyone was ready to get to their necessary exams. People were studying, groaning and pouting all over the place, and Harry tried his best to keep his attention stuck on his books – having people pointing at him. He was now famous for being a loner and looking like an anorexic hobo. Funny, how roughly two weeks could make your appearance change so drastically. Hermione hopped by. She was carrying a pile of books, hooked under one arm, and looked down on him worriedly. Harry pretended not to notice her. He wrapped his fingers along the edges of his parchment, and yawned as he read.
"How do I know you're not lying?" Harry mumbled as he took some distance. He could no longer trust the boy who played with his feelings.
The door was opened with a flick from behind – two gigantic yet slim hands pushing him in before he could struggle.
Draco frowned as he moved back a bit, trying to ignore the taste of Harry's blood on his tongue, and apparently pretended to hate him again because of the way he tried to change his expression so rapidly at seeing him. As if he just realized it was actually Harry Potter he'd been kissing, and not some girl from the same house as he was in. 'What?'
A squeaking, curious sound left Draco's throat. Blood seemed to fill his lungs, possibly in a rapid rush, and his body trembled – his muscles twitching in pain. Harry looked up at last. In furious rage he performed a spell so dark, he didn't know what kind of influence it could possibly have. Seeing Draco, blood spilling through his clothes, caused him to flinch. Cold sweat ran down his spine, and in utter furry, he fell to his knees in front of him – holding his face to look him in the eye. Draco was becoming cold and losing consciousness. "No!," Harry growled as salty fluid dripped down his chin. "God, no!" As swiftly as he could, he unbuttoned Draco's blouse. Tearing his clothes in a rush, no matter the pain he was causing. Draco cried still, unable to answer any of Harry's actions, no matter the hurt. "Fuck!" Harry cried as he looked at the cuts spilling blood from his weakening body. "Help!" Harry cried, his voice raw and full of despair. "Somebody please help!" Gritting his teeth, he tore his clothes apart, binding Draco's wounds – hoping it would stop the bleeding. "Don't you die on me! Help!" Knowing he was unable to stop the wounds from bleeding, he got up on his feet. Draco's blood stuck to his hands and clothes; making his stomach weak, and he made his leave – running through the bunches of junk spreading his way. Once finding the exit, he slammed the door open – his breath stuck in his throat, his face dripping by cold sweat. "Somebody help!"
"Shut the fuck up," Harry muttered as he walked in as well – the doors closing behind them. Harry's breathing sped up, and though Draco's nervous attitude, he remained in a resolute and determined manner.
Harry's heart skipped a beat with ever further approach he made. How could he have been so dull? It was a sign. Draco Malfoy was trying his upper best to enter his mind, to manipulate his dreams, and give him hints about their future meeting. There had to be something he wanted to say. Though Malfoy tried to keep his distance, he could feel his presence. He could feel him – touching him, watching him. Harry's obsession grew stronger to the day, and he wanted to know where he was. Where they were. Either Draco became one of the Dark Lord's spies, or something else was going on - something much stronger and more powerful. A bound. A connection. In whatever way possible.
Without sharing another word, or waiting for response, he held Harry's head placing his lips on his to seal his words; his tongue slipping in through the gape between his lips. Harry got drowsy. His mind was controlled by a psychotic teenager; feared of being unloved. And yet he kissed back. Hungrily, ignorant, his hands tangling the edges of his collar to pull him closer His glasses knocked against his brow ridge, their faces so close their noses pushed against the creases of their skin. They kissed. Harry; desperate, unwilling to let it die.
"He's fine," Harry muttered as he took a seat, filling his plate with eggs, bread and whatnot. Ron gave him a nod, smiling with his mouth closed, and waved his hand.
'Harry,' Draco gasped after Harry had speed up the head within seconds. 'I'm coming.' Harry didn't seem to listen and just kept rubbing the tip of his tongue along its thin skin. 'Potter,' he squeezed out now, not being able to keep himself from rushing his hand through his companion his hair. 'You're so fucking good- I can't-'
Draco drew his fingers past Harry's arm, kissing the spots of skin in Harry's neck as he sighed. "Don't worry too much."
Draco threw a book at his face; resulting for them both to laugh until they realized it wasn't as funny, and he replied.
Brushing his fingers along the hems of Draco's jacket, he pushed it off his shoulders. Draco hesitated, expecting their kisses to go as far as a pair of lips could go, but Harry wanted more. He wanted to investigate the blonde's body, and hark his teeth along his skin. He wanted to feel him; to take him whole, and breathe him. His fingers grasped the blonde his locks, and his lips trailed down to his jawline. Though many words could've been used for the rush that caused his head to spin, bliss came closest. A whirlwind of emotions made his body shiver. And by Merlin's beard, he felt alive at last.
The people were leaking out rapidly after they arrived at Hogwarts. Trunks and cages clattered against the obstacles around, and heavy chitchatting allowed the day to bloom with life and joy – now everyone was once again united with their friends. Hogwarts would always be there to welcome people home. Though Hermione's suspiciousness almost cost Harry his head, he managed to shake them off – telling them he'd lost something on his way in. Swiftly moving through the counters, afraid he wouldn't be on time, he wriggled himself through the last passing students making their way out – Harry his eyes strongly fixated on every end of his way. As soon as he arrived at the well-known Slytherin area, he took a deep breath before he entered. His heart pounded against his chest – his head spinning and his palms sweaty, afraid for whatever could come.
Harry lost track of time. He couldn't remember what time he left Hagrids, and his head didn't seem to stop buzzing soon. Draco pulled him around, like he did before, yet seemed a lot more cautious but aggressive. Not in a way he couldn't handle.
Harry nearly dropped his wand as he curled up his legs – pulling the sheets tightly around his shoulders. A voice came from the corner, yet no one seemed to be there.
Snape presented himself as furious, until Harry spoke of Malfoy's name – easing his anger, exchanging it for suspicion.
Draco scoffed, turning his face to have a few outside – watching the owls drift by. "You're not the victim here, Harry. You were killing me. Who's the enemy now?"
"Don't go melodramatic on me, Potter. I hate to see you like this. I can't believe you considered yourself as the potential chosen one..." Draco paused. A twitch in his brow betrayed him; along with the way he crossed his fingers to loosen his up his joints. His voice became awfully small, and as he took a breath he leaned in – watching his enemy from up close. "You are," Draco continued, his face troubled, "but to die."
What happened after was something Harry had never foreseen. He'd planed to use many spells, fighting moves and take ways of escaping if really necessary, but none of them had been necessary for what suddenly followed. Not really at least. Draco suddenly grabbed Harry's jaw, as if he was planning to break his neck or whatsoever, but instead of doing such cruel thing, he crushed his lips onto those of Harry - immediately allowing the coppery taste of blood to touch his tongue since he took advantage of Harry's parted lips. A hitch got audible in Harry's breathing. With widened eyes he searched for something to support himself with, since it felt as if he was toppling back, but as soon as he realized he did not, and it was actually just the feeling of getting extremely excited, he took the opportunity of kissing back slowly. He didn't know where to leave his hands, though. He was basically just getting squeezed between Draco and the wall now, and he had no specific idea of what Draco was about to do any moment. In fact, he had no single clue of what was happening even. Yet, somehow he'd been aiming for this also. He strongly craved for physical contact the last few months, now he'd reached such age, but... with Malfoy? Really? He did want to wrap his arms around him, though. But didn't do so just yet.
Draco pulled his tie, trying to loosen it, and swiftly opened the top two buttons of his blouse in fear of suffocation. His steps were quick and measured – as if he didn't want to be seen by any of his classmates. Or worse. As if he didn't want to see himself – afraid for his own shadow that followed.
"It's good to have you back. We will see you this afternoon?" She squeezed his hand before she hopped back onto her feet and grabbed Ronald by the him of his shirt to tug him along.
"Don't, I get it. You took a taste of me, that was all." Ginny grabbed her stuff, rushing on her feet to leave the hall – and Harry had to follow.
Harry decided to follow him. Walking up the stairs all the way to the seventh floor, he had a feeling where they were heading for.
"It was a mistake," Draco spoke, "You've been a mistake. It's been a fucking mistake you were even born."
The truth became inaudible the longer Dumbledore went on. Harry closed his eyes, rubbing his face as tears drew down his cheeks, a strike of breath leaving his throat as the final words dropped and left the room bare and cold. How it happened no longer mattered to him. What happened would never leave his memory. It was only the confirmation coming from Dumbledore's mouth that broke him to pieces.
"Why not?" Draco seemed rather disappointed. His always porcelain pale face burst with a colour possible to be called "ravish me red", and his lips were swollen.
He got interrupted by Ron nodding heavily as he smirked, and he frowned briefly as he eventually finished with '-nally.'
"Lay down and scoot over," Draco muttered in between their kisses. Harry frowned, yet followed his orders, and lay down by the length of the desk – forced to interrupt their kiss. Draco looked at him, hopped on too, lying down next to Harry – their shoulders touching. The ecstasy seemed
Harry looked him in the eye, startled, and did not reply. Snape, in the meantime, turned away as if he wished to mind his own business, and let them be.
Once they managed to shove two simple beds together, they reshaped the pillows and went off on a search for the finest blankets. During this search they didn't speak. In fact, they barely looked at each other. They simply shared a secret smile every one in a while – their cheeks turning red every time one of them caught the other. The silence was well appreciated, and even though they both had the feeling they had to speak to one another, they didn't. Their presence was enough for now, and they'd have plenty of time to talk with each other along the night anyway.
"So it seems," Harry muttered, trying to stretch his back for it hurt even more now. "Why weren't you at class today? Or ever?"
"So what are we going to do?" Harry muttered, his back stiff and his body still moist by the cold sweat running down his spine. "We are possibly going to be expelled."
Dumbledore walked closer and put his hand onto Harry's shoulder as he tried to look him in the eye. He seemed worried.
Harry quickly gathered his stuff, gritting his teeth together as he allowed his single book to fly back to its original spot. "I need to find Ron and Hermione. Have you seen 'em?"
Harry turned, baffled and weak once he saw who asked him to dance. Slender and tall was he who gave his hand, his skin porcelain pale – his face hidden behind a mask of what seemed to be precious metal. Silver – faded through time.
