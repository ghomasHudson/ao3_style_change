He pilfers another scone on his way out—chocolate chip, this time—and doesn’t realize until he’s standing in Kingsley’s office hearing about a laced Amortentia shipment from a potions ring operating out of Guatemala, three wizards dead this morning of an overdose of foxglove, that he’s had enough pastries this morning to feed a class of kindergarteners. He’s never really been one to watch what he ate, not with his history, but it’s weird and sort of nice to realize that two separate people have offered him breakfast this morning.
“It always made me feel very safe, when she called me that,” Draco says beside him, voice thick with tears, “and very loved.”
Harry staggers into the bathroom and vomits up the cheesy pasta Kreacher made him, then vomits up the curry he had for lunch and the frozen waffle he zapped with a heating charm this morning.
though, he wonders? Why does he feel so secretive? Why does Draco feel like something that’s
“So you’ll help?” Harry asks.
Harry shakes his head, laughing, and leans down to kiss him.
” Hermione hisses, “he just lost his flat, we agreed not to
“Yeah,” Harry says. “That’s what I thought.”
“I let her keep one, to get these two back.”
He was right, as it turned out. Having Malfoy teach him was good incentive, but unfortunately Harry hadn’t gotten much better at Occlumency since Snape had tried to teach him at Hogwarts, so mostly he spent his sessions shouting at Malfoy and casting wandless, wordless hexes when he lost control of himself.
He’s never put back one of the memories from his safe—if he needs to remember something he just pours them in the Pensieve and watches like they aren’t his, but he can’t imagine it’s much different than a temporary removal, like Malfoy does during every session and like Dumbledore did back when Harry was a kid.
“What, then?” Rita asks brightly. “Filed a cease and desist? Come to serve me with papers?”
“You’re
sitting on top of his backlog.
bigger, of how huge it would feel spearing him open. He has to breathe open-mouthed through the intrusion, like he’s running a marathon, and by the time Draco makes it fully into him, his hip bones flush with Harry’s ass, Harry can hardly get enough air. It feels like all the blood in his body is either in his cock or in his face, and he turns to hide his blush in his upper arm, in Draco’s sweater.
“Alright,” Harry says, alarmed. He lets Draco manhandle him, like he’s checking to make sure he’s still all there, then smothers him in a crushing hug. “Alright, Draco, I’m alright.”
What’s so humiliating and so devastating that he can’t even think of voicing it, is this: he wants to be fucked to sleep.
He trails off, because Draco is looking at him like he’s the biggest idiot in history, and also the best thing he’s ever seen.
he’d told her.
But frustratingly, maddeningly, Malfoy still refused to give him a rubber stamp.
“I can’t,” he says, with great difficulty. “Not right now. I’ll be back in a month.”
Harry figures it’s fair for him to sound so hostile, considering that the last time Harry saw him he was leaving him in bed
Draco must be in a similar state, because the moment they’re back in the Manor, the
What did he see fit to remove, Harry wondered. Was it different for each session? Did he not bother taking things out of his head with other Aurors—was it just Harry he didn’t trust? Malfoy’d signed a nondisclosure agreement with the DMLE, he knew, but that didn’t go both ways. Did he think Harry would use something he saw, if he ever managed to see anything? Didn’t he know Harry had grown up, too—that he didn’t think Malfoy was necessarily up to something just because they were currently occupying the same room?
He lifts almost all the way off him, thighs shaking, and lowers back down. Draco makes a noise in the base of his throat, gutted, and says, “
“You know,” Malfoy says, “we wouldn’t be in this mess if you’d just dealt with your trauma like a normal person.”
Harry doesn’t, actually. He’s got the ones he made at Hogwarts, and that's about it. He’s
Draco holds his gaze, answering without words Harry’s unfinished question:
Harry stops halfway to the door. He wonders if Draco’s been using their Occlumency sessions to plant commands in his head like a Soviet sleeper agent in old Muggle movies, or if he’s just gone mad, that one word can affect him like that. Can arrest him so thoroughly, like a palm pressed to his throat.
, you dollop,” he says. “You’re always allowed.”
tirade again, but he catches himself before he can. “These are important, then,” he says. “What are they?”
Harry says. “We’re…mates.”
You must have loads of those.”
(“The Wizengamot’s punted on the Heritage Land Use Act again, if you can believe it, stodgy old Hawkworth—you could probably get a seat if you wanted, wasn’t your great-great-grandfather or something a member?”) and leads him up a winding staircase through the interior of the house to the master bedroom.
“Ah, here we are, Potter,” Malfoy says, from the closet. “This should do nicely.”

under a stack of case files and picks up the note that’s attached.
They’ve been talking for a while, in between rounds of vigorous fucking, and now Harry hums in answer. “Yeah. I used to wonder if he could see my dreams, as well. I thought that would be pretty funny—Voldemort having nightmares about showing up naked to his OWLs.”
So there he was, living through another moment he suspected he’d probably have to relegate to his wall safe, except Malfoy had lowered himself carefully to sit on the floor next to him, sweeping his coat out of the way, and he was lifting Harry’s head to rest on his thigh, and actually Harry might not want to forget this at all.
Harry shakes his head, but Hermione says, “
But the next one is called
Draco stands with him as he passes through the Forbidden Forest, going to meet his death. His grip on Harry’s hand tightens to the point of pain as Voldemort turns in that clearing, as he says,
he tells him, over and over again, though he’s so pale he almost looks like a corpse himself,
, even if it’s only in his mind. Also she’ll probably never set foot in this place again, after the last time she was here, so he should stop thinking how peaceful it feels here now, and how it’s far too big for one person, and how he’d like to stay.
” he says.
“Couldn’t sleep?” Harry asks. He helps himself to the other chair.
Only someone as poncy as Malfoy would call a pimp a
“My agent thinks we should let it blow over,” Ginny says. “Let it be news for a week or so, before people find something else to gape at.”
When he’s done he lies down with his face on the tile, just breathing.
Rita lives in a walk-up flat in a wizarding building near Picadilly Circus. When Harry approaches the closed door, he can hear the clack of magically-operated typewriters working furiously inside, no doubt inventing more fictional descriptions of his haunted eyes and terrifyingly short temper. Well, he thinks darkly, as he knocks hard on the door and shouts,
, and the eyes of every witch and every wizard in the room seem to follow him, magnetized, like he’s a prize they all want to win.
Harry falls down the last few steps straight into Draco’s arms.
His hands slide up Malfoy’s back, over his shoulders to bury in his hair and pull him down into a hard, affirmative kiss. Draco shudders some more, striping Harry’s stomach with another thick rope of come, then bites Harry’s lip, rolls off him, and falls promptly asleep.
“I used to go to Hogwarts just to talk to the ghosts,” Harry confesses, while they wait in that strange in-between Platform Nine and Three Quarters. “About dying, you know. But none of them had ever been here.”
His sudden appearance in the newsroom causes a bit of a stir, but it’s early enough that only a few of the desks are occupied. The night editor is still on, and happily he's intimidated enough by Harry’s presence that he gives up Rita Skeeter’s home address without complaint.
like a normal person?”
Harry eases out of bed as Malfoy snores beside him. Even his snore sounds well-bred, and Harry gathers his clothes up fast to avoid inviting any more affectionate feelings.
“We do—actually—have work—to do—today,” Draco says, in between kisses.
Draco shakes his head. “Not exactly. Blaise was close, but he wasn’t quite there—he got lucky with his case, because she’d only been missing the memories a week. You’ve been missing yours months. Years.”
Much later, after they’ve made their way down to eat in the dining room (“The Coralina dinner service gets grumpy if I don’t use it every once in a while,” Draco says), after they’ve ascended lazy and full back up to bed, after Draco’s manhandled Harry down to lie on his chest and spent hours kissing every bit of him he could reach, chatting idly about the rest of the contents of
“You,” Harry interrupts, face hot, bewildered and frustrated that Draco could think he would want anything else when Draco is
“Yes, I’d have guessed as much,” Zabini says, with a significant look at Harry. “I mean, the only other possibility was that you’d finally managed to bugger Potter—”
Harry was busy raging internally at the fact that Malfoy had refused, yet again, to rubber-stamp him to go back in the field, so at first he wasn’t paying enough attention to feel a lurch of alarm at the words—but then he heard them, a moment late, and he did. “Nothing,” he said quickly. “I don’t know what you’re on about. Maybe I’ve managed to block you out of those parts.”
Harry follows cautiously, the bouncer’s eyes locked on his scar. As the door swings closed behind him, muffling the sex and grape-eating noises from outside, he turns and sees—“
“Harry.” Draco nudges him so all four chair legs are back on the ground and crouches next to him. “Look at me.”
“Am I supposed to know what those are?” Malfoy asks.
Draco pauses with the sweater in his hands, staring down at Harry’s bare torso. The worst of the wounds have healed, of course—they wouldn’t have let him walk out of St. Mungo’s if they hadn’t—but the fresh pink skin he spent the better part of the day regrowing has left a clear map of where they were.
Harry banishes Draco’s clothes wandlessly and wordlessly while his mouth is still occupied, then gathers Draco to him in an armful of naked limbs. Something inside him goes quiet, sated by the heat of his skin. He opens his mouth to bite Draco’s lips, messy and wet, and gets an emphatic noise of agreement in return.
Harry turns. Draco is watching their past selves like they hurt to look at, and Harry realizes all at once, with a sick jolt—he doesn’t know. He doesn’t know what Harry was thinking in this moment, what made him excise this from his mind—How could he?
. It just—they were only—” he stops, flushing, and looks away. This is ridiculous. He’s a grown man. He’s an

, something—or at least would’ve tried their luck while he was actually home, not during work hours. But he doesn’t want to send the DMLE after Rita Skeeter, not if she’s actually got his memories, because then they’d be logged as official evidence. Having his dirty laundry—whatever dirty laundry it turns out to be, and he
pace around the Room of Requirement—later, asleep, the Marauder’s Map folded beneath his pillow, imagining he can still hear the deliberate tap-tap-tap of snakeskin wingtips—peering through the sea of bent heads in the Great Hall in the morning, looking for platinum blond hair at the Slytherin table, Hermione following his gaze and slumping with a sigh,
Then they’re in the master bedroom. The transition is jarring, to go from the sort of grief that felt like a hand twisting in his chest to this: shivering wonderfully on Draco’s fingers, both of them smeared with sweat and spunk, rapturous.
And then he makes it to the last three chapters.
It’s a long, arduous process, the re-installation of Harry’s memories. Harry loses track of time almost immediately—that’s something he remembers from his lessons with Dumbledore, how easy it is to get lost in a memory—and the only way for him to keep a grip on things is through Draco: a hand firm on the small of his back as Dumbledore guides the boat across the lake of the Inferi, the clean bergamot scent of him as he holds Harry’s face against his stomach, letting him sob and scream his way through Voldemort’s return, that night in fourth year, Cedric’s body in the grass.
The sun is low in the sky, a rare orange sunset in the city of London. Harry takes a detour through Diagon Alley to stop at Gringotts on the way back to the Manor, and leaves his vault with a small velvet bag added to the day’s haul.
Draco sighs like a shrug. “Too much tea after dinner, I imagine.” His eyes drop to the bag in Harry’s hand, then lift back to his face, amused. “Been out jewelry shopping, have we? I didn’t know anywhere was open this late.”
Harry shrugs. “What else am I supposed to do?” he asks. “It’s what I’m good at.”
Someone else comes into the bullpen, Justin Finch-Fletchley chatting animatedly with Hannah Abbot over cups of coffee from POTATO, and before they can come in sight of his desk Harry shoves
It’s not an unfamiliar feeling, but right now it’s spilled over every other thought in his brain, and it’s—heavy. He wants to crawl into bed and sleep it off, but he doesn’t want to do it in the wrong bed, and all the beds in this house are nothing but wrong. Above all he wants to go home, but his flat is a pile of charcoal and for some bloody reason the only other place he wants, the only place he feels a pull towards, is Malfoy Manor.
“Holy fuck,” he confesses, in lieu of anything more damning.
All at once, Harry is back in the training room, Malfoy leaning hard against the desk in front of him, wand hand falling to his side. “You didn’t know,” Malfoy says, shocked. “You really didn’t know what it was.
“No!” Harry agrees. “I went to see Rita Skeeter!”
on himself with the sort of intensity that means he’s probably stripping a layer of skin.
“Oh, God,” Harry says, sort of panicked all of a sudden—how can this be happening, how can he be actually getting this, how can anyone, especially this man, be willing to give it to him—but Draco presses a kiss to his forehead again and says, “Shh, turtle, I’ve got you. It’s alright. I’m not going anywhere, I promise.”
About three seconds into the process, he realizes he was very, very wrong. It’s a lot different.
. He takes huge, greedy handfuls of his poncy velvet robes, tugging him close. “I just want you, Draco, please.”
, not juvenile bloody hexes.”
Ginny stares at him like he’s an idiot. Hermione stares at him patronizingly. Harry would blame the lack of sleep, the incident with the milk, and the fact that he can still hear Malfoy saying
Happily, Malfoy dispensed with the pretense the moment they were behind the Manor’s wards. “I trust we can both be adults about this,” he said, waving his coat into a closet in the front hall, shooting his cuffs with their pearl cufflinks and turning to face Harry with a sharp step. “No strings attached, obviously—”
Eventually Draco notices him and stops, holding the empty sack as the gnomes go screeching back to their holes. “You weren’t at work!” he calls up to Harry.
“So, what?” Harry says, struggling to follow. “You go in with me, and I’ll be able to remember?”
They’ve turned the guest room into a nursery (“Sorry, mate,” Ron says, with a tired smile, “we should’ve known you’d get yourself nearly-killed again before the baby came”) but Hermione transfigures the couch into a bed (“I wanted to get one of those pull-outs, you know, the Muggle kind, but Ron wouldn’t stop giggling”) and they leave Harry, so exhausted at this point he feels like he’s been hit by a lorry, to lie down and stare at the ceiling.
certainly got a suspect. Rita Skeeter’s delayed her book launch a month.”
“Any luck?” Harry asks. He did end up sending Ron a note eventually, once he'd gathered up all the vials. He hasn't got high hopes that the Aurors' office can turn anything up, but he figures it's worth a try.
in that appalled voice, like Harry was a kitten that had brought him a dead rat.
Harry sits down, shuffling case files around so Hermione has room to pour three cups of tea. “I still don’t get it. So Rita Skeeter’s printing a lies about me, what else is new?”
The building’s
“It’s a sex thing,” Ginny says at last, caving. “I—told—Rebecca—some stuff about our relationship, that she could blab.”
look at me,” Draco says. “This is important.”
“Here,” Harry says decisively. When he makes up his mind to do something he finds it’s better to do it straight away, so he doesn’t have time to psych himself out about it. “Here’s fine.”
Draco murmurs a charm against Harry’s left ass cheek—a cleaning charm, Harry can feel it tingling inside him—and then it’s all he can do to hold onto the bookshelf and not to fall over entirely, because Draco’s
He gets dressed on his way through the Manor’s cold, echoing halls, nearly trips down the marble stairs trying to get his right leg in his jeans—he’s still missing a toe from his last deep cover assignment, he’s been putting off going to St. Mungo’s to get it grown back and it’s fucked his balance—and emerges into the cold October night. The robes he put on this morning aren’t warm enough for the weather, and for a long moment he stands shivering on the front step, the only lights lit in the Manor too far away to reach him here, thinking that maybe he’s overreacted in the wrong direction, that if he goes back now and crawls into bed with Malfoy he can pass his absence off as needing the loo, that Malfoy will hiss and give him shit for his cold feet but will let him burrow his way back in, wrap himself around him, bury his face in the warmth of his neck. It’s a golden thing to imagine, and Harry wants it very badly.

"Fine," Harry says, and Draco sees suddenly that his eyes are alive and no longer angry, but practically vibrant with something almost like... excitement. His stomach twists again. "One person who doesn't fawn over me? Who isn't obsessed with me? You."
“Oh God,” Harry mutters, and he hears Ron curse in the same manner.
He sweeps out of the room and the Wizengamot follows him.
“Oh wonderful, Harry, quite wonderful. What a Christmas! I’d never have dreamed I’d be having a holiday like this even a year ago.” She shakes her head, growing a bit more solemn. “Truly since Ted died and Nymphadora came of age I’ve spent most of my Christmases alone, quiet in the solitude of the house. But now…” she looks back at Teddy who is producing a stream of noises as Narcissa sits and monitors him. “Well, I don’t expect I’ll be having much quiet for the next 17 years or so. Or that I’ll be alone.”

"She said 'Well fuck you Theodore.' with proper grammar and shit." Draco read from his phone sitting on his bed "Wait proper grammar like capitals and punctuation?" Theo asked, Draco just nodded his head "Well shit." Theo sighed plopping onto his bed before here was a knock at the door

Draco rolled his eyes. "Don't be a bitch." Pansy said hitting him lightly. "Pansy that's his entire brand." Blaise 'whispered'. "Fuck you." Draco flipped him off. "Are we good?" Pansy asked again. Draco sighed. "Yeah we're good."

Hermione thought she was more prepared but seeing someone in person and texting them were so very different. Ron and Harry weren't prepared at all and they knew it, they were not prepared to see them in person at all.

"Um, I guess you guys may be sad because you liked them?" he inquired "But why? We never liked them, never even thought about being friends with them." Draco said finally talking "Maybe deep, deep down u want to be friends with them, Draco when you first met Potter you wanted to be his friend." He said before adding "Maybe you still do, but think they would never be friends with you especially after what happened a few weeks ago."

His mouthful of scone suddenly tastes like ash. He swallows thickly, and says, “I’m staying with someone already, actually.”
“Of course I do,” Draco says, miffed. “What, did you think I was joking?”
make him feel sick, why does he want nothing more than for Draco to bite him and pull his hair and call him
isn’t quite the whole of it, or
, or any of the other adjectives he can think of. Just
“What have you been doing to yourself?” Malfoy asked him after one session, a month or so into the training. “You’ve got big empty spots in your mind, like something’s missing, but it doesn’t follow a trauma pattern.”
A fleeting smile crosses Draco’s lips. “No,” he says. He meets Harry’s gaze and holds it. “I meant more in the marital sense.”
. She’s included so many embellishments—he wanted to drink their blood, he told them he was a vampire, he begged to suck their toes—that Harry hopes the true stuff will ring as false. Still, he feels nauseous at the idea of people reading this. People knowing this about him. The only person who’s supposed to know that Harry Potter is a needy bottom is upstairs, faceplanted in silk pillows, sleeping off several glorious orgasms.
as having been there when she lost her virginity—but anyway, Blaise was present for the deflowerings of half of London, so that hardly matters.”
Malfoy circles the sphere, inspecting it. “This is a mind map,” he says. “Think of your missing memories like dark spots on a Muggle road map. In order to fill them in properly, I’ve got to figure out what roads connect through where, so to say, and what route they prefer to take—it’s very delicate magic.”
, really, like a house scheduled for demolition, tilting and about to fall over, except that doesn’t make any sense to say.
Caught in the crossfire, Harry had said, and Draco looks down. Aunt Bella hadn’t been aiming for Dobby with that knife either.
“We know.” Draco answers when it becomes clear that Harry won’t.
“Um.” Harry swallows. “Sorry to interrupt but Blaise would you mind turning around so I can get dressed?”
“You are so arrogant!” Draco shouts right back at him as soon as he recovers. “Not everything is about you, Potter, why can you never get that through your thick head!”
“Hardly!” Draco splutters indignantly but Harry just looks so happy he can’t even pretend to be annoyed anymore. “You’re lucky you know. It’s not just anyone who could get away with insulting my looks.”
“Since our first year here at Hogwarts. I knew Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle before school started, and I’d met Millie and Nott in passing, but Pansy’s parents didn’t socialize with mine before school. The three of them spent most of her younger years travelling. She’s got some amazing stories.”
“I think you can move now.” He says thinly, and Harry lunges down to kiss him and, at the same time, he moves.
“Draco, Draco, what spells have you used on Harry Potter to gain his friendship?”
And just like that the dam seems to break. Everything hits him, the smiles, laughter and touching from the Ministry party and the way he and Harry had gone around the room together, just like they would do if they were a couple.
The most surprising thing to happen is when Luna steps out from a side room to testify on Draco's behalf.
Draco glances at Pansy who is staring at the two helplessly. She looks pale.
Draco can picture it all perfectly. It’s a constant feature in his nightmares after all.
Harry just looks at her. “How?”
“Cup o’ tea?”
We're almost done you guys, I can't believe it. I have the sequel finished and it will be ready to post in its entirety the week after I finish posting this story. Thanks for sticking with me so far, I hope you enjoy!
“Why do you think he said that?”
“Look, I’m sorry but I’m the best man and there’s something I have to take care of. Have a great night.”
"Anymore." Ginny repeats, face tightening. "Because you fell in love with him in Eighth Year?"
“Go, go!” Neville waves them off, and Harry laughs as the couple, dressed as the two ends of a centaur, stumble away hand in hand, leaving the room.
And now here they are. Ron and Hermione by his side, like always, and Harry appreciates that about them. Because even though there is a new distance between the three of them from this summer, one that Harry doesn’t know how to breach, they’re still them. No matter how many times they disagree, or what over, they’re there for each other.
He can remember his mother’s face, the way her hair had been tumbling in an unbrushed mess over her shoulders as she’d thrown her hands over her mouth in a gasp. Her eyes had shined wide and she’d thrown herself at Draco’s father.
There's a few minutes where Slughorn drones on and on about the properties of pheonix ash- really, Draco thinks, Third Years should know this- as they sit in silence.
“We really just want to help.” She answers, nothing but honesty in her expression, and he finds he can’t stay annoyed. Their nosing busybodies, but he supposes he can’t blame them. The others are just as bad, and he can be worse than any of them sometimes.
Freak whimpered internally, he was going to get punished. The Strange nice man turned to look at him.
smile on his face. "Please come in Mr.Whitman, My son is such a brilliant child." He started to brag. Severus wanted to hex this man for his rudeness. "My wife isn't home at the time so it's just me and my son" A child the age of 6 or 7 stomped down the stairs. The child looks just like his father, and no sign of

Freak stared at the wall, it was very dusty and moldy. Uncle Vernon had a new type of punishment and Freak didn't like it at all. It made his back hurt a lot. Freak didn't want to be punished anymore.
Harry sat at the table, Draco across from him and Mr.Snape at the head of the table. "Uncle Sev," Draco broke the lingering silence, "Who is this? Why is he here?" Harry tried to sink in to the chair. "Draco," Mr.Snape gave his infamous glare. "This is Harry Potter, his is a similar situation as you." Draco's ice blue eyes, stared at Harrys form. "Hello. I am Draco Malfoy" Harry nodded, not sure what to say. The silence settle in again. Utensils clattering against the plate.
𝒮𝒾𝓃𝒸𝑒𝓇𝑒𝓁𝓎,
Narcissa kissed her husbands cheek, smiling softly at him. "Draco was playing with that filthy house elf again" She told her husband, Lucius. He had pale, pointed face, with pale blond hair and cold grey eyes. With a walking stick carried in his hand, with a snake head. "He will learn that the lowly house elf is his inferior." Lucius sneered. Narcissa smirked at her husband, knowing the thought he had. "Dobby!" With a pop, Dobby was already bowing lowly to Lucius and Narcissa. "I've been told you have been hanging out with my son, Draco?" Lucius raised and questioning yet angry eye brow. "Yes, Master. Young Master demand i's to play-" Dobby whimpered as Lucius swiped his walking stick. Dobby didn't dare to move, fearing he would be hit again. "You abominable filthy house elf! We are your superiors, you are beneath us." Lucius kicked Dobby on his back. Dobby let out a small whimpered as his master kept kicking him on his back. "Now, You are not to obey any of Draco's wishes, if you do...Punishment will be worse than this" Lucius sneered, his grey eyes blazing with hate. Dobby's whole body shook with pain and fear. "Whatever the Master and Mistress wishes," Dobby bowed lowly to the floor, his big round eyes filled with unshed tears. The two laughed at his pain, pain that Dobby had hoped wouldn't move from him to the young master, Draco.

!" Freak that was all he was ever called, his name was Freak Boy. Freak was a horrible horrible person, Freak was a useless burden to the Dursleys'. All Freak wanted was someone to love him, cherish him like Aunt and Uncle did to the Dudley. But Freak didn't deserve love or anything. Freak was lucky that Freak was aloud to live with them. "You broke my boys toys! You ungrateful brat!" Uncle Vernon started to turn red and purple in the face. His hand clenched in anger. Uncle Vernon was a very overweight man with blue eyes and blonde hair. Freak stared at the ground, knowing that Uncle Vernon didn't like it when Freak made eye contact with any of them. Uncle Vernon raised and slammed his hand down so quickly, Freak didn't have time to process it. Pain flared up on Freak's cheek, his Uncle had hit him. "Vernon!" aunt Petunia squeaked, hiding her Ickle Dudleykins behind her.
That was his name right? Mr.Snape said his name was Harry. Why did it feel so weird. He was used to being called Freak or Boy. Apparently, that was wrong to call him that. Harry realized that he didn't answer. "Ah...Y-Yes?" Draco flick the lights on. Harry blinked innocently at Draco, Harry was just sitting on the bed, waiting. "Why were you sitting in the dark?" Harry could feel his lips twitch, but he not he shouldn't smile. He cant. "I like the dark..."

Someone is actually talking to freak, like....like a person. "I-I don't know what Hogworts is, Mr.Snape." Freak said, shuffling his feet around. "A-And you mustn't say that word...It's a bad word." Freak whispered, his hand covering part of his mouth. Mr.Snape stared at Freak, beady black obsidian eyes staring down at Freak. "Witchcraft" Freak could feel sweat slide down his neck, green eyes looking at Sir's unconscious body. "Bad word, Freak cant say bad word." Mr.Snape had sneered at him. "Freaks Sorry. Didn't mean to say bad word. Please don't hit me" Freak begged, he was already in so much pain. "I'm sorry little one. I'm not angry at you." he spoke softly, Brushing some of his black hair out his face. Freak stared in awe, no one has ever touched him without it hurting.  "I'm angry at your guardians. This is not how they should treat you. Any child in fact." Mr.Snape said. Mr.Snape waved his stick and all his things, Which only happened to be a emerald green blanket and a old worn, dirty stuffed bunny. Mr.Snape stood up, grabbing a hold of Freaks hand. "Come child, We are going to my home." He looked down at Freak, with caring in Mr.Snapes eyes. "Away from this." Freak looked at his out stretched hand. Hope filled Freaks green eyes, "You wont hurt me?" Mr.Snape didn't even hesitate, "No child, I will never ever hurt you." Freak grabbed his hand, with a loud pop they were both gone.
“You are.” Harry confirms. “I’m just… more ridiculous.”
In the center of the circular layout is the greenhouse which still blooms with flowers.
“Harry.”
“I know. But I was worried about your reaction and,” she pauses before admitting, “and he’s a Slytherin, Harry. One who, even though he didn’t join Voldemort, sure as hell never helped us against him either. How in Merlin’s name will that ever work?”
"Yeah, Malfoy." Ron has turned around to glare at the blonde. "Shove off."
“The problem?” Molly demands. “What about what their families have done to your
“That shut you up.” Harry notes and Draco tries not to let it show how full of anticipation he is.
He hums, finally, turning back to his notes. "Makes a change for you, does it?" He asks, but he's quieter now, and the bite is gone.
“We are.” Harry shakes his head in exasperation. “And after all that I still didn’t even notice when you came in.”
“Yes.”
More silence until Ginny speaks up. “McGonagall made you leave. And besides, even if you had stayed we couldn’t really expect you to fight your own families, no wonder what you thought of the whole thing yourselves. I could never try to seriously hex my Mum or Dad, or any of my siblings.”
“And I would get to see you every day for most of the day.” He murmurs finally. “Which is another bonus.”
Then he’d been able to cast a fully corporeal
“That was me being nice. And polite. I believe they call it making conversation.”
And then somehow Ron isn’t needed to keep things civil between the two of them anymore.
“None of this is anyone’s business, that’s the point of the game.” Blaise shoots back, head cocked at her. “You must’ve. With Dean?”
The blonde’s expression breaks out into a smile. “But yes. I was hoping we were done with coordinating our schedules as well.”
“I won’t.”
"Draco, hey." Blaise moves forward and wraps his arms around him. "Listen to me, just breathe, okay, calm down-"
“Oh, erm…”
over himself. All he has on are the robes from last night’s party, but he doesn’t care about the odd looks the Muggles are shooting him.
Her eyes look sad. “I want you to be more than fine, Harry.”
Draco had said he would finally tell his parents the truth and he would suffer the consequences but, Harry realized now feeling stupid, he hadn’t told him what had happened. Maybe he hadn’t said anything to them yet? Maybe this is a test from Narcissa, trying to figure out what Harry and Draco are to one another now?
“Hello Lily-Bella,” Draco’s voice carries through to the kitchen and Harry puts away the last fork and knife before turning around to wait.
“When you two stayed in the Room, after the rest of us left. Did you snog again?”
Draco doesn’t look like he believes him. “Look, if it’s Luna just get something you think is weird, that will probably mean she’ll love it. I think she’s happy to just receive presents to be honest.” Draco frowns. “She hasn’t had a lot of that apart from her father.”
But if anyone can give him the stability he so obviously wants then Draco supposes it could be Ginny. She’s had a good example in her own parents after all.
“Are you three having fun?” Luna asks. “We were just about to start some games!”
Interesting, because Draco had thought this fight had finished long ago. Months ago, in fact.
But she gives no hint of thinking any of that when Draco hisses, “Merlin, Mother, don’t sneak up on us like that.”
They make it to the others and Draco’s chest tightens at seeing them all gathered together, Harry standing in front of the fire and facing them all. He meets Draco’s eyes, not looking nervous at all, only happy, and he feels himself relax.
And then he’s pulling Harry back down swiftly, their lips and tongues meeting in a perfect dance as they twist with one another, faces pushing and pulling away in synchronization. The tentative softness from before is gone. They no longer care about savoring the slow build, or at least Draco doesn’t. Now all he wants is more.
“I’m not.” Harry says, even though he knows he kind of is. “I’ve had less than an hour to process this.”
Pansy cackles. “Oh, I
“Not really.” Draco looks over. “Do you?”
He starts to think after that, and he begins to organize himself. He's become somebody he never wanted to be and he turns his mind to other things. He starts accepting the subtle prompts for leadership and responsibility from his coworkers. Eventually he's barking orders in and off the field, filling out paperwork and even helping train newcomers.
Draco stared.
“I wouldn’t go that far.” Draco mutters but he’s still smiling.
Harry’s eyes widen and his look of shock is all Draco sees before he scans the crowd again, catching the surprise on each of his friends faces as well.
Ron’s grin looked relieved. “Good.”
Maybe it had been an apology or a promise of sorts, but Draco doesn’t think so. And even if it was, it hadn’t been necessary. His parents had the most solid relationship Draco knew of; Narcissa may have gotten mad at Lucius over certain things, but she’d never need something like this to make her forgive him.
“Now, now, everybody. It’s proper spin the bottle,” she says. “No matter who the bottle lands on you have to kiss, boy or girl, friend or enemy. The only exception are the siblings,” she gestures from Padma to Parvati, and then from Ron to Ginny, “because believe me, nobody wants to see that.”
“Draco.”
In his downtime he's been cleaning out 12 Grimmauld Place, trying to fix it up so that by the end of the summer it might actually resemble a home again. He'd done Sirius's room first, to get that out of the way, and now he’s working on Regulus's.
The others all move around them, obviously happy to leave him to his fate, but McGonagall stops them. “And you too, Malfoy, if you have the time.”
Harry looks at him in surprise. “Yeah it was. There were seven in all.”
because she would have one if their roles were reversed.
Finally the flaps open fully and Ginny stands arm in arm with her father at the entrance.
Hermione shoots him a small smile. “Hello Draco. Busy taking care of them tonight?”
“He’s been visiting Hagrid.” Harry tells her and Draco shoots him a betrayed look. “Though nobody seems to know why.”
Draco curses softly and stands hurriedly too, pulling the bed covers tight, straightening the wrinkles and creases right before a quiet knock sounds.
Then it’s time for the vows.
“Yes?”
“Yeah, okay, Hedwig was fine,” Ron allows, “but still. Cats are better company.”
But it had also been years ago.
“Hmm.” Narcissa’s smile is tight but it
He’s nervous but not unwilling. It’s definitely something he wants.
“No need for that, you can always come back again.” Hagrid says, standing up and looking down at them both as Harry and Draco follow suit. “Starting to get a bit peckish myself now that ye mention it.”
A letter comes for Harry as they’re finishing up and Draco grudgingly takes over the conversation as the other boy sits back to read it. He realizes that Lydia is actually quite brilliant and she reminds him of a young Hermione. She’s grinning happily at him and something in Draco eases, any worry of her being afraid of him or angry disappearing as she does.
He closes his eyes and slumps backwards. "Why do you think?" He bites out. "Why doesn't anybody
"You already did, who's forgetting things now?" Harry shoots back at him. "As I remember it wasn't very satisfying. Thank Merlin you had the sense to stop us when you did, otherwise I'd have been dragged down to your level right along with you."
And even though this might have been a perfect time to actually tell Narcissa the truth- the full truth, about himself and his sexuality and Harry- he lets it slide. He doesn’t want to ruin what’s just passed between them.
“Ah, yer all busy with studyin’ I expect.” He looks around and when his gaze lands on Pansy, Theo, Millie and Blaise they straighten up noticeably, which makes Draco have to hold back a smile. Hagrid doesn’t bother and his grin stays firmly in place when his perusal stops at Draco. “Alright, Draco?”
Without another word the three of them move forward to hold each other tightly.
“It was very noble, Weasely.”
He breathes out slowly, head falling to rest in his hands. Today is just not his day. He wishes he could be out on patrols and reconnaissance with Ron and Dean but instead he’s stuck here going through the same old file and supervising the others. They’re all adults, for Merlin’s sake, they don’t need supervising!
“Right.” Harry repeats dully.
A few moments of silence go by and Draco tries not to feel embarrassed.
And even as irritated as he is by the entire conversation, by everything really, Draco won’t pretend that it’s necessary in the first place by dragging it out.
out of it? We're supposed to be graduated already anyway!"
He looks at the other wizard again, watching as he stares at the obliterated house with a vulnerable expression, and Draco vows to himself then and there to shower him with all the love he can. If anybody deserves it Harry does.
His own nakedness apparently doesn’t bother Draco and he moves quickly to snatch the present and bring it back with him as he resettles to sit beside Harry at the headboard. Slowly Harry pulls himself up to sit beside him.
“Yeah, okay.” Ron replies slowly.
Draco blinks and for a few seconds he looks caught as Harry meets his eyes for the first time in almost two years. “
“Draco wait!”
Harry looks towards the fire. “That one wasn’t your fault. You were barely older than I was.”
Harry cocks his head at her. “I don’t really know him, Gin. Why? The costume doesn’t really bother me if that’s what you’re asking. Kinda weird when I look at him, but it’s not offensive or anything.”
"Mr. Potter." The woman beside Kingsley, someone who's name Harry has never managed to learn, now speaks. "Please tell us your full name and try to lie."
Both of them stop breathing for a moment.
that make Harry feel the worst.
Blaise sounds tired and a bit nervous when he speaks and Draco stops to crouch down by the bed. “Yeah?”
“No! Only if I give them,” Teddy pouts and Harry laughs, hoisting him up further.
The blonde head shakes. “No more hiding.”
Harry’s look becomes understanding and he looks back over at the statue. “Yeah,” he agrees. “They sound pretty incredible.” A small frown steals over his face.
Draco sets about making a life for himself and tries to forget the name Harry Potter, at least for a little while. At least until his heart stops hurting and a face with crooked glasses and messy hair leaves his mind.
“Yeah. I mean if anybody knows about conquering death it’s you, right? The Boy Who Lived?”
“Ron dear,” Ron’s mother calls out, interrupting Hermione. “It’s getting near time, we should start getting you lot on the train.”
“I don’t…” Harry runs his fingers through his hair, frustrated. “I do love him. But we’ve been awful to each other since school ended. Really horrible. Both of us have said things, done things…”
“I think about you,” Harry’s head falls back to the wall behind him, thoughts almost incoherent. “Your hand and- God, your mouth. Hot and wet, around me and sucking like you’d rather be doing that than anything else-”
“And this year the news has been so interesting.” Her eyes positively gleam and Draco wonders not for the first time what it must be like dying so young. Do you mature over the years, or are you stuck with the mindset you had at your death? “I’ve heard all about you and Harry, you know.”
Harry gestures vaguely over to the table noticing Ron coming over towards them. “Blaise did mine but I’m starting to think he’s slipped something in it.”
Snape and Dumbledore are sharing Dumbledore’s portrait, and though Snape looks as glum as ever, Harry suspects Dumbledore had been one of the paintings who’d laughed. The old man winks at him and Harry takes that as confirmation that nothing is
“Pans-”
“Actually I’m quite comfortable,” Harry says conversationally as his hand slowly rubs back and forth. Draco continues to harden embarrassingly quickly, or at least it would be if he hadn’t felt the beginning of Harry’s erection all the way back in the bathroom.
“And both of you never answered.” Millie says. “So we stopped asking. And there’s no reason to now, not when you’re both happy.”
Draco raises an eyebrow.
“What are you yelling about now, Ron?” Ginny drops in to sit beside her brother, smiling at them all in hello. “We can hear you all the way at the other end of the table.”
Draco reaches his hands out to hold Harry’s face, wiping his glasses before letting his hands rest there gently. Harry’s breath catches and he can hear the dripping water falling off his robes to the floor, can feel the dampness beginning to spread from his socks to inside his shoes.
“I wondered, after you told me about her.” Draco says awkwardly. “And I thought, well there’s no harm in asking. If she says no or if there aren’t any I was no worse off than before and you never had to know.” He pauses for a moment. “Knocked the socks off me when she sent an envelope of pictures back.”
“Hardly.”
Several of the others look at him in surprise at the intensity of the outburst and Draco does too, seeing the real anger there. He frowns and when Harry meets his eyes the dark-haired boy blinks and lets out a long breath.
Feeling Draco Malfoy pressed close behind him on a broom.
“Oh.” Now Harry feels a bit bad for snapping at her. “Thank you.”
Draco groans and hides his face in his pillow. “That was embarrassing. I’m embarrassed for you.”
“No, I’m glad you did.” A look crosses Harry’s face, making him seem somewhere between constipated and embarrassed.
“Or maybe I’m making a complete fool of myself and putting words in your mouth when you should just tell me what it is yourself?” Harry keeps babbling, his face beginning to darken from a blush, and Draco can’t help but grin and step forward, cupping one of Harry’s cheeks.
"Hey, what the fuck?" The brunette snaps at Draco as he is pushed away and Draco's eyes cut away to him so suddenly Harry takes a breath to get his bearings back.
He grits his teeth and resists the urge to smash something because the worst thing is, Draco does want to leave. He wants to run again, leaving behind Harry and the tangled mess he’s helped recreate with him.
And damn Potter, but Draco can’t say no to that now, can he?
“Circe’s tits, Millie, you get that one.” Blaise says. “I would too if we were playing honestly. Just because you lot are sore losers…”
Harry turns around and walks away, thoughts swirling dangerously around his head. Just because he never asks their friends about Draco doesn't mean the opposite is true, he supposes. Because it's too painful for Harry to talk about doesn't mean the same is the case with Malfoy. Perhaps their friends have been telling Draco all about how Harry's doing, the state of his love life and house and everything in between.
He shrugs. “Godfather privileges. And duty. I suppose.”
Blaise nods, face set. “I know what you’re saying. And you’re right. The last thing I want is a repeat of Fifth. But Draco,” Blaise shakes his head with a helpless smile. “I’ve been thinking this for so long now and it hasn’t gone away. If anything it’s only gotten worse. I know how I feel. I’m sure.”
“You didn’t steal it, I offered.”
“Mother.” Draco says and Harry hears the warning note in his voice and the plea it’s laden with.
When he pulls away and wipes his mouth he shudders at the thought.
“Draco,” he begins, “what the actual
“I thought you didn’t go to those parties?”
A giant, consuming, Potter shaped-
“You know what I just thought of?” He keeps his voice to a whisper.
"And try- if you can- to make friends in other Houses." Narcissa continues, unaware of the fact he isn't really listening. "I know your Father disapproves, but it isn't a matter of pride anymore. It's about survival. If you could get close to Potter for example…"
Watch as Draco throws his head back that much more, as the stranger- the manager of the Holyhead Harpies maybe?- moves forward and starts thrusting his hips-
“It is, yeah.”
Finally his eyes fall on a picture of Cedric Diggory and something in Draco twists a bit. He feels Harry come up to stand beside him and he obviously follows Draco’s gaze.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Thank goodness, because my entire costume
“Ginny?”
His hands grip the sides of his bowl-shaped sink and he’s slightly hunched forward as he stares at himself in the mirror, focusing on making his breathing seem normal and not panicked.
Potter's back is to him and Draco can't see his face. Not that he’s looking.
Harry doesn’t feel like something is wrong, necessarily, but he does know things are changing. He thinks Draco knows it too, what with the way he’s been acting recently.
He doesn’t get to sleep for a long, long time.
With one last glance at everybody else who all appear to be busy, the two of them slip away quietly. For a moment Harry wonders what they’ll all say when they notice the two of them have disappeared but then he hears the wrapping paper crinkling under Draco’s fingertips as they clench and relax sporadically around the gift and decides he doesn’t really care. Draco’s shoulders are stiff as they walk and he doesn’t even unwind when they make it to the Fat Lady, who gives them both a look that Harry ignores.
Draco nods.
Harry nods. “Let’s see, what else… When I was leaving this girl, couldn’t have been older than 18, was standing outside all alone asking everyone who passed whether we’d seen her friend. When I told her I hadn’t she started crying.”
“He should be able to think of something. It doesn’t take that long to turn someone down.”
“He’ll be seeing everyone off at the train.” Harry reminds her. “You can have a proper chat when we’re back. It will give you something to catch up on anyway.”
It’s just that he’d been so nervous last night and it had all ended in a disaster. Seeing Draco had thrown him off for the entire evening, and then the git had alternated between staring at him and ignoring him, making Harry feel tense and nervous. Then he’d disappeared to dance by himself and Harry had sat and taken almost 40 minutes to work up the courage to go and join him, just to try and be friendly and see if they could socialize for their friends’ sake.
Harry doesn’t know where to look. He suspects he’s looking at a point on Draco’s chest but he takes a guess and grins at it anyway. “Can’t see you at all.”
“Thank you, Harry.” She says warmly, taking his arm and squeezing it gently. “You look nice too. I hope Ginny said something.”
“What?”
“I was going to say normal, actually. At least compared to mine. No crying. No memories of dead boyfriends or that sort of thing.”
“How- how is that possible?”
“Planning on doing anything down there, Potter? Or were you just admiring the view?”
Luna smiles a small smile. "He would tell me what the weather was like outside and how he was just as scared as I was. He became the best friend I had down there, outside of Mr. Ollivander. I don't think I could be best friends with someone who held me captive if they were evil, do you?"
Harry nudges him, taking a sip of the punch and wrinkling his nose at the strength of it. “Good God, what is this stuff?”
It isn’t that she’s close to them now, or anything of the sort. Narcissa detests most people, that will never change, even with everything that has brought her and their family so low. She just no longer detests them based on her old prejudiced beliefs because those, Draco notes, seem to have been changing as well.
Theo nods. “Now there’s a good thought, Potter.”
“Because I don’t want to!” Draco’s voice rises again. “Things are fine, alright, aren’t we happy now the way we are? Isn’t the sneaking around fun?”
“He’s Kingsley.” Harry says baffled.
“She is,” Draco admits. “I just- I know you two kissed at the party but I thought that was just the same as the rest of us.” He looks back at him. “Does she like you back?”
“Oh well.” Narcissa takes a quick bite of her toast, chewing and swallowing fast before washing it down with some tea. “That’s alright then.”
He doesn't sound angry, exactly. Just... confused. Wary.
“Well for one,” Draco says, “even though pregnancies don’t necessarily come into it with two blokes there’s always the scandal. We’re supposed to be pure, you know, and that means until marriage. Reality is another matter, most of the time, but our parents are stricter than most generations before us, and it’s a bit of a commonality between our little group of Slytherins in Eighth Year. Wouldn’t want to disappoint dear old Mum and Dad.”
Merlin, but Harry loves having the Gryffindor Dormitories practically to themselves. They slip into the men’s shower room and Harry heads to his familiar stall, leaving his clothing on a nearby bench with a towel draped over them. Draco carefully sets his towel beside Harry’s before turning to face him.
Besides he wants to go, mostly. He misses Draco, even though it has only been a few days, and it will be nice to see him. He’s curious too, to actually go there as an invited guest and just see how the Malfoy’s normally live.
He skips his father’s abandoned study- a room more recently used by Voldemort than Lucius anyway- and they’ve already seen the living room, the greeting parlour and the hallway that runs straight through the main level. He points out the few bathrooms on the floor, waiting while Harry uses one, before finally pulling him outside to show him the gardens.
Shite. Shite fuck shite.
People still wondered how Harry had survived again. Once as a baby was miraculous, but twice… there was power involved there.
Harry watches as Draco glances over at her. “What’s your last name Lynne?”
Neither of them had been very satisfied with that answer.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione’s tone was so happy Harry had blinked in surprise. “Of course they’re not. Or- I mean they are. Important I mean.” She’d smiled and Ron leant forward to clap his back. “And we’ll try, Harry, we decided we’ll try to get along with him. If you want. If you want him to- to spend time with us, with all of us, I mean, well… we’ll try.”
up all night.”
“Yeah.” Harry says quietly and takes another drink.
“Now, Blinky should be along shortly with the tea.”
Draco had shaken his head. “You don’t have to pretend and hide behind my mother, Potter. I know you would probably rather face Voldemort again than come to the Manor. Besides you visit Teddy all the time at Andromeda’s already. I get it, it was a dumb thought. I spoke without thinking.”
She actually looks anxious about it too, Draco notes as he chews. Her face is creased slightly with concern and she’s paying attention to Harry’s every word, watching him closely from behind her glasses.
“They’re everywhere,” Hermione says in annoyance. “Security has been in and out to get them all. They’ve been bothering all of us, but especially you Slytherins.”
“Shut up.” Ron says with no heat as they reach the Room’s entrance.
The head of Draco’s cock nudges him and slowly Harry pushes back, eager for that long-missed feeling. It slides in, coated in lube and both of them groan as Draco sinks in to the hilt.
"No," Harry watches him back, eyelids feeling heavy. "You weren't."
In the end there’s only so long Draco can look at a chair and he’s forced to turn back to Harry just as Harry begins to say, “look, Draco-”
“Right. See you, Potter.” Draco draws himself up and nods, but Harry steps after him as he moves away, one hand reaching out to stop him.
“No, you’re not.” He puts as much authority as he can in the announcement and with effort bats Harry’s hands away. Then he reaches around to tug and in a record amount of time Harry is as bare as Draco, more so if you count his lack of socks.
It opens when he is still feet away and Draco’s tired and drawn face greets him. He looks exhausted but his eyes are bright with something too tremulous and fragile to put a name to as he comes forward looking concerned.
“Oh.” Harry finally says. “That’s… good. To know, I mean.”
Harry spends too long picking out his outfit for Blaise’s stag night. He knows he takes too long. Ron’s waiting downstairs, eager to go out and have a fun night and Harry is raking through his closet trying to find a shirt that won’t seem too loud for a night out.
Draco hesitates.
“Is that what you want?”
“What does it mean?” He asks now, turning his head to look at Draco only to find himself being watched already. Their eyes meet. “Your name.”
His friend smiles at him from the bedroom door. There is so much Slytherin green in here it almost makes Blaise nostalgic. "I read Thelonius's praise of you in
“You do not.”
No, Draco would laugh at him, asking why he was doing it if he doesn’t want to.
He takes a biscuit and McGonagall nods at him in satisfaction.
be true. I know my Dad could be an arse and that- that sometimes my Mum hung around the wrong people.”
“But they were wrong.” Harry says frowning, obviously not understanding. “You were wrong.”
Ginny shakes her head. "No, that's not- ugh."
And finally Draco catches the flash of heat on Harry’s face. He licks his lips helplessly, staring up at him, suddenly keenly aware of the fact that Harry’s arse is resting comfortably over his groin.
Harry sees the arm Neville has around Luna’s shoulders tighten a fraction, and he looks out the side of the carriage and smiles to himself. That is one thing the war didn't make him regret.
. For him to use his formal signature now tells Draco just how incensed Lucius Malfoy really is, and how prepared he is to impose the promised distance between them.
“Then what?”
“Maybe a bit, I suppose. But it’s just the way it is. There’s too many for them all to keep track of each other.”
“I was disappointed when he first suggested it.” Harry admits. “And hurt. Angry too. I feel like,” he hesitates, not entirely sure if he wants to reveal this to Blaise of all people. But then he realizes there’s no one else. “I feel like I’m not enough.” He sighs tiredly. “But if he needs time I’ll give it to him. If it comes to having Draco in private or losing him altogether… I know what I choose.”
Draco sat a the table with grace, His Father and Mother across from him. "Now Draco, When sitting at the table you MUST have grace and patience." Lucius slapped Draco's arm, "You don't set your elbows on the table. It is rude." Draco's arm started turning red and swell up.  Lucius took his cane, swinging it down on Draco's back. "Sit up! Act like a proper Pure-Blood!"
Severus smiled, "Ah all children go through that phase. Is he jealous of your son?" Severus ask.
Only the hope didn't last long as Draco still found a way to play with Dobby.

Draco was up and ready before Uncle Sev, which wasn't shocking to him. Draco stood in front of the door. Which happens to lead to the room Uncle Sev told him to stay out of. The knock came quietly first and then there was silence. Ever so quietly, Draco twisted the doorknob. The door creaked open, it was pitch black in the room. His grey eyes looked around in the room, trying to see anything. He stop. There, a pair of the emerald eyes stared back at him. "Harry?"
Most day's Draco would sit in his room playing with his toys, not once did he talk to others. Well except the house elf, Dobby. "Master Draco sir yous called?" Dobby bowed low to the floor. He stood at 3 feet tall with long floppy ears and bright wide green eyes. His skin was a pale pink and the only thing covering him was what looked like an old pillow case. "Dobby!" Draco smiled cheerfully at the house elf. "I was wondering if you would play with me?" Draco ask Dobby. Dobby smiled sadly at his young master. "What ever the young master wishes," Dobby said. An hour later the door opened. Walking in was a tall, slim and very pale, with blue eyes, long blonde hair. She stared at the child, Draco. "What are you doing playing with that house elf? You are a pureblood start acting like one." She said in a clear, cold voice. Her blue eyes staring down at her son. Draco looked at his mom confused, "But mum-" She raised her hand, silencing him in a swipe. "Don't call me mum, You're a Pureblood act like one." She raised an eyebrow, daring him to defy her. "Or do Your Father and I need to get you lessons again?" She threatened. Draco held a sigh in, "I'm sorry Mother," Draco lowered his eyes to the floor, knowing his Mother and Father hated his eye contact. "Dobby! Go somewhere else, your presence it bothering me" Draco's mother, Narcissa, sneered at the house elf. Dobby bowed lowly to the ground, his long nose bending as it touched the ground. "Yes Mistress, as the Lady wishes" Dobby snapped his fingers, disappearing with a loud 'pop'. Draco stood up, "Mother? Why can't I have friends over?" Draco ask, his hands behind his back. Draco herd a low stifled laugh. "oh you have so much to learn, Draco, A pureblood doesn't have friends." She smirked at her son, seeing the hope fade from his grey eyes. "We have sources." She turned around and walked out of the room gracefully. "Remember Draco that in live, some people want friends but don't need them" She slammed his door shut, followed by a small 'click'
6 years old
Draco hissed, eyeing his back through the mirror. It was raw pink flesh and was spotted with blood. Draco was sure it was going to be very painful to clean. His eyes moved over to his arms. On each arm there are great purple welts that will only deepen over the coming week.
Severus dabbed the corner of his lips, before speaking. "As you know, we are going to Diagon Ally tomorrow for stuff I need, as well as stopping by Gringotts." Both of the boys bobbed their head. "We will be leaving at 8:30 am. I will come and wake you up to get breakfast," Severus eyed Draco.
~~~~~~~~~~~
A barn own held out a letter to Draco.
Freak Boy was done with his chores, so Freak went in the house. There was a tall man who wore a very dark
) "You can't hit the Freak! They'll know!" Aunt Petunia said. Vernon smirked at the small boy. "Take Dudley to the store, get him a new toy. Take your time" Uncle Vernon pulled the boy up but his forearms, Gripping Freak's arm tightly.
Snape pointed his wand at the whale. "Stupefy" He fell to the ground unconscious. Snape turned he wand to Dudley. "Silencio" Dudley's waling stopped, his mouth continued to move but no sound came out. Severus bent down to Ha-Potter's height. "Hello, little one." Severus started, trying to not scare him. "I'm Severus Snape. Potions master and Teacher at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Surely you must know of that?"
Severus stood out side of the plain door. All the houses looked the same, the only difference being the number on the door and mail box.  A small boy, about the age of 3 or 4, was in the front lawn picking out weeds from the ground. The big baggy hand me downs practically swallowed the poor child. Severus ignored the child, knocking on the door. A very large man swung open the door, grunting at Severus. "What ya want?" Severus curled his lips, hiding his disgust of the man. "I am John Whitman, I'm with a special school for children that excel in school." Severus lied flawlessly. The man immediately, stood up straighter placing
“Say Potter, nothing’s happened between you and Draco has it? Only he’s been in a right mope lately.”
Draco still grumbles. “It’s not like you’re the best at Potions you know.”
They land with a loud splat and Harry meets Draco’s flushed face with a grin that’s entirely too smug.
“-fell asleep.” Harry finishes lamely as he watches Draco’s mother turn crimson. He has to bite his tongue to stop himself from doing something extremely stupid, like talking more. Or laughing.
“Memories?”
“Wankers,” Ron says under his breath and the three of them all meet one another’s eyes with proud smiles.
They share a smile. And though things still aren’t perfect, Draco feels like they’re back on track. At least for now.
“But I-” he glances at Harry nervously before continuing, “I have plans to become a Potions Master. I don’t think I could do that and teach at the same time.”
He groans, rubbing a hand over his face.
Draco stops, follows his gaze. “Mmm, and have her take away points because of me interrupting her? Is my position as most hated person here not fresh enough in people’s minds, you want me to remind them?”
Her mouth tightens and her lips thin. “I will have to disagree with you. I should talk to the students responsible. We have very strict punishments for this sort of thing.”
The boy’s eyes darken incrementally. He swallows. “Alright.”
“If you thought it would be awful then why did you come?”
Even if there wasn’t the rest of this to deal with, he and Harry have very different career paths and opportunities ahead of them. Harry has a job with the Aurors sitting waiting for him in the Ministry. Draco has almost no opportunities here in the U.K. and thus has had to get more creative.
“He hated your father.” Draco blurts without meaning to and then tries to fix it. “Erm, he got upset about it once to me. I was complaining about you and Lupin, I think? Something stupid in Third Year, I don’t know. He said you were no better than your father and that Lupin had always been… um. Anyway.”
Draco seems to freeze before waving it away and looking serious. “Don’t worry about it. If anybody should apologize it’s me. Seeing you-” Draco snaps his mouth closed as if the words had slipped out before sighing and swirling whatever remains in his cup. “Seeing you was difficult.”
It doesn’t happen right away of course. To start it all off is Ron who had gotten fed up of mediating the two of them and serving as their messenger boy faster than even Harry could have guessed. He’d demanded Harry just come with him to see Draco for updates, something that had made the blonde wizard pause only for a moment before acting as usual without doing anything more than nod at Harry to acknowledge his presence. Then it turns into Draco hesitantly coming straight to Harry, at first only to talk about recent developments and slowly, as everyone grew more frustrated, to continue their talks. As Draco explained the case down to the minutest detail in as simple of terms as he could, Harry listened and asked questions, hoping for a breakthrough. Eventually Harry just ends up going down to see him whenever he has any leads- which are few- or news from St. Mungo’s- also scarce.
He knows it had been him that Pansy had come to after telling Blaise she didn’t want to be with him. That she hadn’t stopped speaking to Draco or sitting with him. But he also knows that he was the one who’d found Blaise hiding in their dorms those few times and stayed with him, even if he’d pretended to study all the while, just so the boy hadn’t felt alone. He knows it was him that Blaise had eventually told the whole story to, making Draco realize that the other boy’s feelings for Pansy hadn’t just been fleeting but instead had been building for years.
“Where’s your owl?”
There is only about a foot of space between them. Twelve careful inches that Harry could reach through and break with barely a thought.
“We already do that.” Harry says in confusion. “I- you’re already who I come to about most of my problems.”
“Shut up,” Draco snaps. “It was personal.”
Truthfully when Draco had told him Harry had been more interested in the look and tone the other boy had. It had been clear Draco was trying to gauge his reaction and Harry had quickly been distracted with teasing him.
