“Come on, luv. You know mum won't be happy with us if we're late," Charlie said when we finally broke apart. Our breathing was slightly ragged. He reached out his hand towards the nightstand and grabbed my glasses. He handed them to me, before placing another kiss to my lips. “Come on, up" he said. I pouted, but pulled myself away from him and pushed my glasses onto my face. I slid off the bed and stepped over to the bureau to grab some clothes.
“I-I don't know wh-what you're talking about, Malfoy," Charlie stammered out again. He wouldn't look at me.
I looked out the window at the darkening sky. I tried not to let my thoughts form a reason why he was late, but against my judgment, the thought forced it's way into my mind. It was a thought that I had come up with two weeks ago the first couple times that Charlie had come home late. I had only given voice to that thought once. I could still hear my conversation with Ron...
Draco took a sip of his tea before he answered. “Occasionally, but the staff there doesn't completely trust me. I am the son of a well known Death Eater. Hell, I was a Death Eater myself." He lowered his head to his chest.
“Oh, fuck, Draco. Stop or this will end too soon for me." I groaned. He pulled away, rising over me without a word. He pressed his lips to mine again, his hand still between our bodies, softly stroking my length. I snapped my fingers and summoned the bottle of lubricant. It flew up from my trunk and into my outstretched hand.
“I don't want to hear his lies. I think by kissing another guy, it's obvious that he wanted our relationship to end."
I sighed, closing my eyes as I thought about how my life has changed in the past two months. Mine and Harry's relationship had grown during the course of the last two months. Most days, we were inseparable and could be found lounging around on the sofa in the bedroom; reading, playing chess or just cuddling together. That is, when we weren't in the Manor library.
“Well, what I saw in his head as I was healing him, his magic played it out that you cut him. The way he saw it, you were showing him how much he had hurt you by doing the same to him."
He pulled away from my lips gently. I opened my eyes, which I hadn't even been aware of closing, and looked up at him. My arms were around his neck. “Let me show you exactly how I feel about you Draco," he whispered. He wrapped his arms around my waist and took a step backwards towards the bed. He took another step, and because our arms were still around each other, I had to step forward as he stepped farther towards the bed.
Kyle nodded and walked away. I turned my attention back to my menu. “So, what would you recommend for me, Harry?" I asked.
I stiffened at the mention of my mother's study. I had known she wanted to show Harry some of her memories of me growing up, but I hadn't thought she would do it today when he was still weak from the magic he had suffered yesterday. I let my ´mask' slip into place as I turned around to face Hermione again. “Well, I haven't seen him, but when I do, I'll be sure to give him your message."
“Here Harry," I said, placing the glasses in his hand. He shoved them onto his face. He seemed startled when I came into focus.
I bit back the sharp words on the tip of my tongue. Of course I was feeling guilty about the whole situation, but I wasn't going to admit it. My feelings of betrayal were a lot stronger than my feelings of guilt. I forced myself to look into Seamus' eyes. “Personally, I don't care if he wants to kill himself. I'm done with him and I could care less if he decided to get married to Blaise right now. If you'll excuse me, I have other things to be doing than having this conversation." The words were like poison on my tongue. I didn't mean them at all. I pushed myself to my feet, and made my way towards Dean.
“I can explain that. You see, just about anyone can do wandless magic when they lose their control over their power. I think everyone loses control in the middle of sexual activities. When your mind is focused on your pleasure instead of your magic, your magic will flow freely and then you can do anything."
He smiled and grabbed the bottle. He placed a glass in front of him and poured a generous amount of Firewhisky into it. He then picked up a pitcher full of a gold colored liquid and added that to the glass. “Butterbeer and Firewhisky, just like every week," he said.
I was right on his heels as he pulled open the door. Linda looked terrified as we stopped next to her desk. “What happened in there? What caused Harry's anger?" She asked.
It had been four days since my birthday party, and I hadn't seen Harry since. I had awoken in St. Mungo's, both wrists heavily bandaged. The Healers had given me several blood replenishing potions from the time I had woken up. And though it had been four days, my wrists were still bandaged; I refused to let the healers heal them with magic. Even my Healer's magic wasn't healing them. After casting several diagnostic spells over me, the healers had discovered that I had made myself immune to my own Healer's magic, meaning I could no longer heal my own injuries; although they've said that it would come back over time.
Draco ran his hands up my legs, sliding them over my skin until he reached my hips. He leaned forward and licked my shaft from root to tip. I moaned tossing my head back against the pillows. He wrapped his lips around the head of my dick and sucked me into his mouth. I moaned again, thrusting my hips up. One of his hands wrapped around the base of my shaft as he bobbed his head up and down. Almost at once, I felt my groin begin to tighten.
I retreated from him, backing myself towards the wall. “Blaise, stop. I'm not going to do this. I won't hurt Harry like that," I said as he advanced closer to me.
I reached out and touched the teapot on the crack in the porcelain. Harry's finger hooked over the rim of the teapot, just above mine. Everyone else placed their fingers on the teapot. We stood there waiting for a moment. Suddenly, the teapot began to glow with a blue light. I felt like a hook had caught me behind my navel and pulled. My feet left the floor, my finger glued to the teapot.
"Yeah, I have one," I said reluctantly. I strolled over to my trunk and knelt on the floor next to it. I opened the lid reached in and caught the edge of my invisibility cloak. I shoved the cloak aside and pulled out the shallow basin covered in ancient runes. I slowly rose to my feet with the Pensieve in both hands. I moved over to my bureau and placed the Pensieve on top.
I turned to face Marcus. He was leaning against the bathroom door as if he didn't have a care in the world. “Then speak, Flint. You answer my questions. Just remember, I'm the one with a wand in my hand."
“You're going to have to explain that to me. If you were having an affair with him for three months while we were together, and you were still sleeping with me during that time, how can you be sure you didn't give me an STD?"
“That's what we agreed to. You and Draco are taking turns riding with me and it's your turn," Harry replied.
“I want you, Harry. You inside me." With a snap of my fingers, I summoned the bottle of lubricant Blaise had given me at Christmas time. It had remained unopened and on a shelf until now. I caught the dark blue bottle and opened it up. I squirted a large dollop on my fingers and reached between our bodies. I made contact with his penis and began to rub the lube up and down it. He was growing hard in my hand.
“Well, yes I want to go, but I'm a little afraid. You see, the last time I went to visit him, he got violent. If he hadn't been restrained by the Aurors, I could have been badly hurt," he said. He turned his head away from me.
He picked up his jacket and walked around the bed to get his wand from my nightstand. He slid his wand into his pocket and pulled the jacket on. He zipped it up.
“I'm a Healer, Charlie. I can feel the pain of those around me. When Harry and I got here, I felt a dull burning sensation in my crotch area. It intensified when you came out of the bedroom."
I looked down at my wrists, rubbing them softly. My chest ached with the forgotten scars across it. “Yes. About ten years ago. We were fighting at Hogwarts and throwing curses at each other. He used a spell that he didn't what would happen. I forgave him a while ago," I said, keeping my head down.
My blood boiled under my skin and I felt my magic trying to break out of the cage Hermione had sealed it in with her spell. Biting my cheek, I squared my shoulders and made my way to the table. “Hey everyone, I have our drinks and our pizzas will be ready soon," I said. I ignored the other man and passed the drinks around the table: Draco, Pansy and Hermione had gotten peach margaritas, Ron and Theo had gotten Miller Lite bottles, and I had gotten a Long Island.
“Well, to be honest Harry, he couldn't tell you because of Lucius. Lucius probably would have murdered Draco in his sleep if he knew he was gay and that he fancied The Boy Who Lived."
“I would never..." Before I could finish my sentence, a silvery stag glided through the door. He pawed the ground nervously before trotting over to me. He opened his mouth and Harry's voice floated out.
Silence fell around us. I glanced down to find that I was still rubbing my hand over his knee. I blushed again and slowly pulled my hand away. He let out a soft sigh. “Draco, can I see your wrists?" Harry asked suddenly.
I took a breath to steady my nerves. No matter how many times I've used floo, I still don't like it. The dizziness from spinning through the different fireplaces was one thing, but if you didn't speak clearly, you could come out of the wrong fireplace. I took another deep breath and stepped forward. I took a small pinch of floo powder and tossed it into the fireplace. Green flames erupted once again. I stepped into them. “St. Mungo's," I called. The room vanished in a sickening swirl of color as I spun around in the fireplace.
“No, I'll talk to Draco. You still have a hard time controlling your temper around him," I said. I pushed away from the table and stood up. I took a breath before I made my way towards Chase and Draco.
“Mistress Narcissa requested breakfasts in her room today. She says we is nots to disturb you and Mister Harry," the little elf said.
“Yes. I don't think you understand how much I've missed this; not just the sex, even though that's usually pretty awesome, but just waking up with you in my arms."
I turned around to find her and Ron standing just inside the door of the sunroom. It was strange to know that they still wanted to be friends with me, even though Harry and I were having problems. Ron still occasionally called me ´Ferret', reminding me of when I had been turned into a ferret. But no matter how many times he said it, the words didn't have the same sting as they did before.
“How can you say that? Nobody but my mother will ever truly love me! I don't deserve love from anyone!" I yelled. I sprang up from the bed and began to pace back and forth.
We walked in silence for a moment, before I brought up the topic of wandless magic. “Harry, you didn't answer me this morning about your wandless magic."
“When you told me that Lucius would punish you when you displeased him, I didn't believe you. But after today..." he shook his head, unable to finish his sentence.
“Look, Potter isn't such a bad guy. In fact, he invited me to sit here when there was no other spots open," I said. I could feel him staring at me, but I refused to look at him.
“How lovely, Harry. Now, come along boys. Breakfast is waiting." She looped her arm through mine and held the flowers out to me. When I took them from her, she looped her other arm through Harry's. As one, the three of us headed into the dining area.
Tom turned back to me. “I'll just leave you here to wait for him. I need to get back down to the bar," he said. He turned around and walked away. As I watched him walk down the stairs, the door behind me opened. I spun around and found myself sort of staring at Harry's chest. I raised my eyes to meet his.
I glanced at my watch as I approached the Leaky Cauldron. It was 1:45, which ment that I had fifteen minutes before Harry would meet up with me. I had butterflies in my stomach as I thought about how this would be our first date. Harry had sent me an owl last night, suggesting that I wear Muggle clothes, but nothing too fancy. I had dug in the back of my closet until I had pulled out an old pair of blue jeans and a long sleeved black t-shirt. I had even found my tennis shoes. My coat was the same one I had worn three weeks ago.
I leaned forward and took his lips as he erupted in my hand and across his stomach. Feeling his muscles clench around my dick brought me to my own release. I groaned deep in my throat as I released my cum inside his body. I thrust a few more times before I collapsed against him.
“Ron, I don't think this is a good idea," I said, tightening my grip on my seatbelt. I glanced at him, but he continued to stare out the windshield.
“Actually Draco, there is someone else there that's a part of our world," she said as she pulled into the parking lot behind the bar. She even parked in the exact same spot Harry parked in all the time. She killed the engine and we both got out of the car.
He stepped aside so I could pass him. He grabbed my arm just as I put my foot on the stairs. “Listen to me very carefully, Harry. Seamus and I aren't going to stand for the way your acting much longer. We know that you still have feelings for Draco. If you don't want to make up with him, fine! I won't sit by and watch you push away your best friends. If you don't contact them soon, I will!" He growled. He released my arm and walked over to where Seamus was still sitting. He helped him to his feet, and together, made their way out into the bookstore. I stormed up the stairs and made my way to my room.
Without a word, Kyle turned away and walked in the direction of the kitchen. He disappeared around a corner. Alan watched him for a moment, then turned back to Harry and I. “Harry, I apologize for Kyle's behavior. Allow me to take care of your bill. Please, feel free to order a dessert."
Once we were seated, I gestured at Dean to speak. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Okay, what I'm going to say is probably going to sound crazy. First, I need to know if any of you know if Harry has any sort of creature blood in his body," he said, looking around at us.
“Harry James Potter, of course he'll tell you that he wasn't trying to kill himself. He probably didn't realize that that's what was going on because his magic was healing the wounds. But if his magic hadn't been involved, that first cut could have been fatal," she said, crossing her arms.
Tom pulled out his wand and did some quick calculations. “8 Galleons, 5 Sickles, and 2 Knuts," he said, reading the edge of his wand.
“I brought Draco, my boyfriend, here for lunch. He's never been here before so I thought he would enjoy it. Kyle here has been flirting with me ever since we sat down. When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, Kyle started to put his hands all over me."
He grabbed my shoulders and shoved me sideways. I fell against the end table next to the recliner. My right hip landed hard against the sharp corner of the table. I landed on the ground. I looked up at him, my hip throbbing.
“I can't say that. I would be lying if I said I didn't have feelings for you." He turned to face me. “I want you to give us a second chance, Dragon. You know I can make you happy," he said. He began to move towards me.
Harry has a small spat with Draco about his Dark Mark. Later, Harry reveals to Draco that he is a bartender in a Muggle bar.
Harry chuckled softly. He fastened his belt and sat down to pull on black boots. “Well, I don't think you want to stay up that late. Sometimes the bar doesn't close until after four a.m."
“Merlin, Harry! I'm not cheating on you! I know how it feels to be betrayed by someone you love! I've been down that road too many times! I could never DO that to ANYONE!!! Especially, not to You!" He yelled. He turned his back on me again. Again, I noticed the hickey looking bruise on the back of his neck.
I sat there in silence for a moment, thinking about everything Seamus had just said to me. I felt a pang of guilt that Draco had hurt himself over me. As I processed all of the information, something was bugging me in the back of my mind. “Hang on, if Draco caused himself harm, why didn't his Healer's magic take care of it?" I asked.
I forced myself away from him. I brought my hand up and slapped him hard across his cheek. The force of my blow knocked him away from me. He sprawled across the floor, glaring up at me. Draco came running at the sound of flesh striking flesh, clearly worried about me. I watched him pause in the doorway.
Draco climbed out of the car. I followed. I caught his arm and pulled him against me, wrapping my arms around his waist. My lips locked against his and I pressed him back against the hood of my car. His hands reached down and grabbed my arse. He squeezed and pulled my hips closer until our erections rubbed through our jeans. I broke the kiss as we both moaned.
“Well, I guess I have to be. But I want to know how you two got together in the first place. I mean you hated each other back in school."
I glanced around, but didn't see Harry anywhere. I stood there for a moment, before I heard the sound of a guitar being strummed softly and I followed it. I came across a small pond with a small willow tree at one end. Harry was sitting under the willow tree, his back towards me. I began to make my way towards him, but I paused when I heard him singing; the beautiful tenor of his voice reaching my ears.
I pulled the sheet and blanket up to his chin. I pressed a gentle kiss to Harry's forehead. After straightening my spine, I made my way out of his bedroom door, closing it gently behind me. I made my way to my own bedroom and once I was inside, I quickly stripped myself down to my boxers. I summoned my pajama pants and pulled them on. I crawled into bed, willing myself to go to sleep. The pillows next to me were loaded with Harry's sent; he smelled like coconut, honey and fresh citrus fruits. I grabbed one of the pillows and breathed in deeply. I sighed and closed my eyes.
“While I may not understand your desire to drive, I do like this car," Draco said. He was still rubbing his hand against the leather.
“Well if Blaise is staying with you, then I'll join you as well. But I'm not sitting next to Potter either."
Kingsley moved towards the door. “Minister, can I try to calm him down on my own?" I asked him. He turned to look at me, then he nodded and turned away from the door. I made my way out of the door, past the table with the portkey on it, and down the short corridor to the door that led outside.
“Are you cheating on me?" I asked again. I looked up. The look on his face was a cross between horrified and angry.
“Harry, it isn't what you think. Marcus got drunk last night and I brought him here to sleep it off," he said. He held up his hands defensively.
We crossed the parking lot and made our way to the front gates of the amusement park. Once there, Harry paid for six wristbands, assuring us that the bands would allow us to go on any ride in the park. Stepping through the gates, I was amazed at the sheer size of the park; rides made of wood that stretched to the sky, things that looked like plastic animals, and several other things that I couldn't hope to name. Harry and Hermione led the rest of us through the park, Harry holding what looked like a map of the park.
For one brief moment, I actually considered pushing him away and stopping what I really wanted to do. Then I curled my fingers into his t-shirt and pulled him closer to me. He groaned again as I pressed our lips back together. I slid my tongue against his lips, and he opened his mouth, quickly sliding his tongue against mine. Harry slid his hands lower, sliding them down over my arse cheeks and squeezing. He tightened his grip and actually lifted me off the floor. I instinctively wrapped my legs around his waist and slid my arms around his neck, burying my fingers in his hair.
The young man we had been watching earlier came over to the table. He looked like he was ready to start screaming at her for coming over to us. “Look, Kyle..." she began, but he cut her off.
Draco stared at me as we entered the room. “Well, in that case, I'd love to go to lunch with you. Does tomorrow work for you?"
“I was thinking about how they don't know about us. To be honest, I'm tired of hiding it from them, especially Ron."
“Harry, you probably won't believe this, but I heard him complaining to Ginny that you won't get back together with him," Hermione said.
I wasn't aware of how long we were there. I occasionally joined in the conversation around me, but I was mostly silent and just listened to them. Before long, the was a knock on the door. The door opened, and a young medi-wizard came in, carrying a tray of potions. “Alright Mrs. Malfoy, it's time for your potions."
Harry chuckled, but before he could answer, there was a loud squawk and Pansy turned into a large yellow bird. The room burst into laughter and all eyes sought out George Weasley. He jumped on a chair and took a bow. After a moment, Pansy lost her feathers, and returned to normal, laughing with the rest of us.
Charlie looked stunned by what just happened. He knelt down next to me. He reached out to me, stuttering out apologies.
“Not true. Yes, I had a one night stand with Malfoy, but Charlie didn't break up with me, I broke up with him. He had been sleeping with Marcus Flint for three months," I said. Without another word, I spun around and walked out the door.
I reached over and pulled the glass away from him. “I think you've had enough Firewhisky, Blaise. You're pretty drunk."
“They don't believe it. Percy seems to think that everything in the Prophet is a lie," Jolene answered.
“They weren't real, Harry. It was all just a nightmare," I said. I walked further into the room and sat down on the edge of his bed.
I nodded and allowed her to help me to my feet. She gave me a kiss on my cheek then gently pushed me in the direction of my bathroom. I made my way over to my bathroom, dragging my feet the whole way. I entered the bathroom, closing the door behind me and pulling out my wand. “
She turned to look at me, her eyebrow raised. “Just tell Mr. Hannigan that you need two of Mr. Malfoy's usual. He'll know what it means," I said.
“Great idea, mate. Come on, Theo," Ron said. The pair of them ran off towards the end of the line of people waiting to get on the ride.
“Oh, never mind. Let's just get these drinks made, then we can chat when we get caught up," Harry said.
He took a few deep breaths, apparently trying to calm down. “Are you that insecure about our relationship? Do you have that little faith in me? I know you told me that Ernie cheated on you; is that really what you think I would do?" He asked. He sounded close to tears. I looked at him and there were in fact tears in his eyes.
The memory swirled away quite suddenly. I glanced at Narcissa, confusion forming through my head. She shrugged. “There was more to that memory, but it wasn't relevant to what I'm trying to get you to understand. So, we'll skip ahead to the next year. You won't see much of this memory, because I was locked in the wardrobe of Draco's room. You will still hear quite a bit though." I nodded slowly as a new memory swirled into place.
I didn't answer, just continued eating. My mind flashed back to the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. The task was to collect a golden egg from a nesting mother dragon. My dragon for the task had been a Hungarian Horntail.
I broke away from his lips and began to kiss my way down his chest. He growled low in his throat as I moved lower. Before I had reached my destination; his glorious and fully formed erection, he caught my arms and pulled me back up. A small whimper escaped my throat and I tried to slide back down his body.
I glanced down at the menu where he was pointing. Suddenly, a platter of tortilla chips and a cup of queso cheese with chili was placed on the table in between us. “So, have you decided on what you want?" Kyle asked. He pulled something from his apron. He seemed to have eyes only for Harry.
“Okay, now I have two questions. One, why didn't you just apparate us straight inside, and two, what's going to happen when your mother sees us?"
Draco takes Harry to Malfoy Manor. They spend the rest of the night in each other's arms, not caring about the consequences of their actions.
“It didn't used to bother you if I was already in bed when you got home. You would still come to bed and pull me into your arms. Now, I don't even get that. It hurts to say this, but I really miss you."
I thanked him, then turned around and walked towards Draco. He had nodded off again, his chin dropped to his chest. I placed my hand on his shoulder and cast a silent
“Harry, I'm sorry. I think I was surprised by the fact that you've been hiding this from me. It felt like I couldn't trust you anymore."
He thrust a finger into me at the same time as he thrust his tongue into my mouth. With a muffled gasp, I arched my back, thrusting my shaft through his fingers. He steadily moved his finger in and out several times before he added a second finger. I moaned, braking away from the kiss, my fingers searching for the lubricant bottle. Not finding it, I whispered a spell to lube my fingers and I wrapped them around Draco's dick.
I stood staring out our kitchen window, pretty much the same spot I had stood in since my arrival back at our apartment two hours ago. My cloak laid abandoned on the couch where I had thrown it. The cup of tea on the counter in front of me had long since gone cold.
“Fine, I'll sit next to Harry," I said. I slid out of the booth. They both stepped back to give me room. “Scoot over, Harry," I said. He immediately slid closer to the window. He sucked in a sharp breath and I felt another shot of pain. I quickly sat down next to him and reached across the table for my drink. I noticed that my knee was pressed against his, but neither of us seemed willing to move apart from the contact.
I chuckled as I straightened up. Percy and Penelope were now watching me. Percy moved forward and held out his hand. “Good to see you again Harry," he said as I shook his hand.
“I know he's cheating. He can deny it all he wants, but somehow I know he's cheating," Harry said. He took another swallow of his drink.
“Alright, first we need to stop at Gringotts so I can exchange Wizard money and get the Muggle money we need, then we'll apparate to King's Cross station; that's where my car will be. Hermione did you manage to get ahold of that rental car place?" Harry asked.
With a snap of my fingers, I summoned the lubricant. Draco caught it in his hand. He squirted a large dollop on his fingers. He sat up on his knees and reached his lubed up fingers behind himself. I was fascinated as I watched him prepare himself for me. I took some lube and began to rub it over my shaft.
We sat in silence for a few moments until Josie brought their drinks. She set them on the table and walked away.
“Harry, don't worry about last night. I think we both can agree that our argument got a little out of control. By the way, how's your hip?"
I pulled my mouth away from him and slowly kissed my way back up his body. I laid across him and pressed my lips to his gently. He wrapped his arms around me and rolled us over. He kissed me deeply once I was pressed into my bedding. “My turn," he said. There was a wicked gleam in his eyes. He began to kiss his way down my body, biting gently in several spots. He ran his tongue around one of my nipples, then he bit down on it. I gasped, and brought my hands to his hair, holding him to me. Like a snake, he slithered out of my embrace, chuckling to himself.
I walked over to the table, taking the chair next to Ron. Charlie sat across from me so he wouldn't be tempted to put his hands on me under the table, as he had done before. Ginny sat next to him. Everyone began settling into their seats. I began to ask Ginny about the Holyhead Harpies, when the chair next to me was pulled out. I looked around and saw Jolene settle in the chair . I fought back a growl of frustration as Penelope said, “See Jolene? That's the perfect spot at the table. You can see everyone." Percy nodded his agreement.
“When you and I were still together, whenever Marcus and I would sleep together, he made sure that we were using protection. And I'm talking about condoms and protection spells. It wasn't until after you moved out, that he decided not to use the protection anymore."
. I couldn't share his enthusiasm; now that we were off the ride, I was feeling queasy in my stomach.
She led us down a hallway and through a large door. The first thing I noticed was Hermione laying on a large bed, a small bundle of pink blankets in her arms. Then, I noticed the Weasley family surrounding her. My eyes passed over Bill, George, and Ginny, before I stopped in my tracks. Charlie was standing next to the bed, looking down at Hermione, a small smile on his face. My heart started to pound as I looked at him.
I looked at his back, and I couldn't look away. His skin was a rich tan and there were scars crossing his back in several ways. I watched his muscles ripple under his skin as he worked. My heart started to race. I just starred at him, willing myself not to go over to him and run my hands over his skin. I took an involuntary step closer to him and fought back a little moan.
. I thought. I wrapped my arms around a pillow and let my tears fall. I cried until my tears dried up and I drifted off to sleep.
Kyle returned, setting a lemonade in front of me and an ice tea, plus a sugar bowl in front of Harry. “Have you decided what you want?"
“Come on. Let's get you sitting over on that bench," he said. He gently put his arm around my shoulders and led me over to a bench, a good distance from the ride. Harry sat me down so that my back was towards the ride, then he sat down beside me. I leaned forward and put my head between my knees, breathing slowly in and out, trying to ease the nausea. Harry's hand began making small circles across my shoulders, and I was suddenly grateful for the small bit of comfort he was offering.
I obeyed instantly, bending my knees and spreading my legs a little more to give him better access to my hole. He aligned his lubed up fingers to my entrance. Before I could even blink, he slid one finger deep inside me. I moaned loudly, thrusting my head back against the pillows. He began thrusting his finger in and out of me slowly. I groaned deep in my throat and ground my hips down, trying to bring his finger deeper inside me.
“Sorry Harry. That's not going to happen. No one is going to leave this room until you at least look at what happened at Draco's party," Hermione said, and with a flick of her wand, bars appeared on the windows and in front of the door.
We began to eat, making small talk. I listened more than I talked, letting Ron and Draco get to know each other. After about twenty minutes, Ron turned his attention to me. “Harry, did you ever get the rest of your stuff from Charlie's place?" He asked in a voice that sounded like he already knew.
“You okay, luv?" Charlie asked. I turned towards the bathroom, and he was standing there with nothing but a blue towel around his waist. I nodded, a blush spreading across my cheeks, letting my eyes travel down his body. I licked my lips. “Not now, Harry." he said with a chuckle. He walked up to the end of the bed and picked up his jeans from the night before. As I moved to the bed to pull on my socks and shoes, Charlie stepped over to the bureau, opened a drawer, and pulled out a pair of black boxers. I looked away as he started to unwind the towel from his waist. I concentrated on my feet because if I watched him get dressed, we would really be late to the party.
“Shut up you insolent little brat! You're ruining everything that your grandfather worked for! Everything that we have become!" Father growled at me.
We sat there in silence, just enjoying our queso dip. A sudden thought came to my mind. “Can I make you an offer then?"
“Draco, I always want you. Since today is your birthday, you have a choice...You can Top me and set the pace of our love making for however fast or slow you want, or you can Bottom and this will be done at my pace."
“I'd like that. Like it even more if you walk me to my room when we get there." He grinned and laced his fingers through mine.
“Yeah. I specialize in farm animals. You know horses, cows, pigs. Things like that," Chase said. He held out his hand to me. I shook it briefly.
While celebrating Draco's twenty seventh birthday, Ron catches Draco kissing another guy. Ron tells Harry, who leaves.
“Don't worry. I'm out of here. I'll make sure that Dean and Seamus know not to come up either." With that she waved her wand. The bars disappeared and she ran from the room. As soon as the door closed, Draco's mouth was on mine again. His lips were harsh and demanding.
“Exactly. And right now, I'm happy with Draco. We haven't been together for long, but I'm incredibly happy right now."
“Promise?" I asked, letting my voice get husky. I shifted slightly as his fingers edged closer to the zipper on my jeans.
Draco looked in the kitchen one last time, then turned to me. “Charlie, here, has a line of potions sitting on the table. These particular potions come from St. Mungo's, and they were created to treat sexually transmitted diseases."
We fell silent, just glaring at each other. My phone rang and I broke my glare at Seamus and looked down as I pulled my phone from my pocket. Seeing Draco's number on the screen, I growled, and placed the phone face down on the floor next to my leg, as it continued to ring. I turned my attention back to Seamus to see the softened expression on his face.
“Why do you automatically get to ride with him? Just 'cause he is your ex?" Pansy asked, glaring at me.
Harry raised his head and looked at his best friend. “No one said you had to look, Ron. Besides, my kissing his neck isn't as bad as what your brother is up to," he said, pointing.
“I'll check on Patrick later. Robards, Briggs, go bring Mr. Malfoy to the interrogation room. After all, that's why we're here in the first place; so Draco can visit his father," Kingsley said. The two Aurors turned and disappeared through the door on the left.
“Us? Blaise, there hasn't been an ´us' since fifth year. Yes, we had something between us, but you threw that away when I caught you in bed with Millicent. I forgave you for that, but then you turned around and had an affair with Adrian Pucey. I mean, he even bragged that he slept with you," I said. Pain washed over me as I remembered hearing Adrian bragging to the entire Slytherin house about how he had gotten Blaise in bed.
“Give me your hand," Draco said. He reached out and grabbed the young man's wrist. The blood was running down his hand. Draco pulled away the fabric that was tied around his hand in an effort to stop the bleeding. Draco pressed his thumb against the bleeding wound. In an instant, the wound was gone.
Harry grinned like a fool and stepped towards the guys. He quickly embraced each of them, before I noticed the red head staring at me. His brown eyes looked up and down my body several times. “Hey, Harry. Who's this gorgeous blonde next to you?" He asked, taking a small step closer to me. I took an involuntary step closer to Harry.
Charlie glanced at me. I nodded. “I know about his relationship status, because I'm the one he's been dating for the last six months."
“I was honest with my testimony, Narcissa. You and Draco had done nothing wrong. You both tried to protect my life, so I returned the favor. I was glad to do my part."
“No, no you don't Harry. I don't know how you could. We may be in a relationship with each other, but that doesn't have anything to do with love." With that, I turned away from him. I walked over to the window and looked down at the garden. I could see several of Father's white peacocks strutting across the grass near the fountain in the center of the garden.
Listening to Seamus flat out lying to Hermione about me, I let out a shaky breath, and sank to the floor against the far wall. When I had seen Hermione's car pull up in front of the building, I had been happy, anxious to see my best friend. When Draco had climbed out of the passenger seat, I felt my heart plummet to my feet. The pain of betrayal had flashed through me and I had raced into the back room of the bookstore, begging Seamus not to say a word.
“Oh how sickeningly sweet of you; you actually care about him. News flash Potter; Draco's a Death Eater as well. If the wizarding world wants to lock up the Death Eaters, why is he still free?" Father asked, sounding very pleased with himself.
I sighed deeply. I was now incredibly grateful that my head was in the fireplace. I knew Draco wouldn't be able to hear my conversation with Kingsley. “Draco and I are involved with each other. He wants me to go with him so that he'll feel safer."
Charlie had apparated in to make sure that I was okay, then he had gone back to the Burrow. I was still picturing the look on Ron's face when Charlie had said we were together. It was like I had betrayed him by not telling him about my relationship with his brother. A tear rolled down my cheek as the thought that Ron would no longer want to be my friend crossed my mind.
“Actually, yes, that counts as creature blood, simply because James Potter could become an animal. Now, from what I could determine, Harry is suffering from a very rare form of magic. It's called Guilt Magic."
“Since he's in prison, all the power goes to my mother. If I say that I want to marry you, for example, she could allow it and Father wouldn't be able to stop us," I said.
“No offense taken sir. Even I enjoyed watching Harry deal with him. No one has ever stood up against him like that," I said.
He groaned before his hands caught my hips and he thrust into me in one smooth motion. When he was fully sheathed inside me, he paused and leaned over me, kissing me deeply. Our tongues slid against each other. Harry withdrew slightly, only to thrust back in. I gasped, pulling away from his mouth as he began his rhythm; slowly pulling out before thrusting back in hard.
Harry took a cigarette from the pack. I watched as he raised it to his lips and lit it with a small, silver lighter. He took a long drag from it. I watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed, before he released a cloud of smoke from his throat. He immediately seemed more relaxed.
“Sure, Harry. Take your time. Just let me know what you decide. I'll personally get a room ready for you."
“You didn't really think that you could repair your relationship just by saying ´Sorry' did you?" Hermione asked.
I looked up to see Steve Evans standing by the door. He flicked his cigarette out and walked over to us. I smiled and shook his hand. He grinned before pulling Hermione into a quick hug.
I opened my eyes and looked over at her. “Well, my friends and Harry's friends. I think it's about time we put the animosity between us to rest."
“Draco, it's not going to kill you. Remember, all day you have been touching things that were all touched by Muggles. Wearing these bowling shoes is the same thing. Besides, you'll still have your socks on," Hermione whispered to him. She had also sat down and was removing her tennis shoes.
A sick feeling began to form in my stomach. “Blaise, please tell me that you don't still have feelings for me," I said.
“I wanted to hurt him so bad for everything he said about you. I still want to rip him to pieces because of everything he's ever done to you," Harry growled.
I felt a pang of guilt knife it's way through my heart. I had never really thought about it like that. Hermione was right; whether Draco realized it or not, he had tried to take his own life. And it was because of me; he had tried to tell me the truth about Blaise and I hadn't believed him. I had believed that he had kissed Blaise willingly because of what I had seen in Ron's head and I had left. Draco had told me that he had cut himself because the physical pain had made him forget that I left.
“That's what his father always did to him. Abraxas Malfoy was never much of a father; always putting Lucius down, beating him when Lucius displeased him. When Lucius first found out that I was pregnant with Draco, he vowed that he would be a better father than Abraxas. But as you clearly have seen, he wasn't any better."
“It's not that hard, Draco. I was raised by Muggles, remember? Anyway, the longer you're in a relationship with me, I'll get you to use them. I'll even get you to understand Muggle money," I whispered back.
I made my way to the bar where Tom, the innkeeper, was busy pouring drinks for the customers. “Well, Mr. Malfoy. It's been a while since I've seen any of your family here," he greeted when he noticed me.
“Exactly what I said. You said that you wanted this, so come over here and get it. Where's your Gryffindor bravery?
Charlie stepped away from me. He took a breath, but didn't say anything. He just stared at me. In my mind, I began to panic that he wouldn't be able to forgive me. He sighed heavily. “It's alright Harry. We can get through this. It's just a bump in the road. I love you." He pulled me into his arms.
At that moment, the waitress reappeared with our drinks. She set them on the table without a word, and picked up the empty glasses. “Will you be needing anything else?"
(Personal note: thank you all for your support. You all seem to be enjoying reading it as much as I'm enjoying writing it.)
“Oh, shut up," I said, raising my wand and canceling the spell. The mirror became cloudy for a moment, then it became the way it was supposed to be; it was my reflection once again, now bare chested and with the dragon necklace hanging against my bare skin. I carefully removed the chain from around my neck and carefully opened the hidden compartment in the wall. As I placed the dragon necklace in the compartment, my fingers brushed against a small box.
“Actually, I think she'll be disappointed if you don't come back. She's been looking for you since I was admitted to St. Mungo's," he said rubbing his hand up my back.
“Okay, I don't know exactly where he is. He quit working here. Last I heard from him, he was going to try and get a job at Seamus' bookstore."
“Harry, you hurt him. He ended up in St. Mungo's for a week after, in an apparent suicide attempt, he cut both wrists because of the pain from you breaking his heart. I'm actually surprised he even wanted you to move back in," she said, sitting down on the edge of the fountain next to Ron.
“But why not tell me? You and I have always told each other everything," he said. It sounded like he was ready to cry.
“Gods, I'm so stupid. I have to talk to him," I said, standing up from the marble bench I was sitting on. I turned around and walked up the stone path to the Manor. I pushed open the door and paused in my tracks, not knowing where Draco would be.
“If you really want a buzz, you should do what I do. I get Butterbeer mixed with Firewhisky. After a few of them, you won't be able to walk straight."
With that, I made my way to the men's room. The throbbing in my hip was getting stronger as I made my way to the bathroom. I pushed open the door, and I paused. Harry was standing at the sink, his shirt was off and he was tracing his wand over where the Firewhisky had spilled.
“He's telling the truth Harry. We have been sleeping together for almost three months. You were right when you accused me of cheating last night," Charlie said.
“What? You think that just because we broke up that I can't be a decent server to Harry? Even if he's on a date with someone, that doesn't mean I can't be civil!" He snapped at her.
I felt a blush spread across my cheeks as Draco turned back to look at me. I refused to meet his gaze. “Is that true Harry? You would sneak out of your common room while I was in the hospital wing?" He asked me.
“Poppy, I need you to bring breakfast up here to my room. I don't care what you bring, just make it enough for two and bring some tea with two mugs."
Hermione released him and shoved her wand back in her pocket. Carlos rubbed his stomach for a second, before pushing away from the wall. He glared at Hermione briefly before pulling open the door and marching inside.
“Yes, Malfoy, I'm gay. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost seven months now, but tonight, things got out of hand."
He glared at me for a moment, then reached out and grabbed the navy blue trousers from the bed. As he slid them over his legs, he paused and raised his head and stared at me. “Those aren't the same clothes you had on yesterday."
My heart started to pound with an unnatural rhythm. Draco was rejecting me, mainly because of what happened when I left. “Draco, please don't be like that," I said.
I nodded slowly. Harry took a deep breath before he began his tale. My eyes widened in shock as Harry spoke of his life; living in a cupboard under the staircase until he was eleven, locked in said cupboard whenever he did accidental magic, forced to cook and clean for the Muggles before maybe getting something to eat for himself, forced to wear his cousin's old hand-me-down clothes, being locked in his room the summer between first and second year for magic that Dobby had actually preformed in the house. I listened carefully, my mind having trouble believing him. My jaw was hanging open when he finished. “Merlin, Harry. You were treated no better than a house elf. Is that why you're so upset over this?"
My brain began to race as I thought about his offer. On the one hand, I loved it when I got to be in control in the bedroom. Harry was the only guy that had ever let me be on Top. On the other hand, Harry's dominance in the bedroom made me feel alive; sometimes our love making was rough and bordered on pain; other times, he was so gentle with me, he made me feel as though I was the most precious thing in his world. “While I love it when I get the chance to be on Top, I love you Topping me a whole lot more. Do what you will with me, Harry," I said.
“Why should I believe that? I saw the kiss in both Ron's and Blaise's heads. You looked pretty cozy in his arms," I said.
I heard him, but I really wasn't listening to him. My gaze had fallen to his lips. Before I realized quite what I was doing, I leaned up, slid my arm around his neck and pressed my lips to his. My left hand was still on his hip, and I used it to pull him closer. I pulled my mouth away, looked him right in the eye, and pressed my lips against his for the second time.
Ginny took a bite from her eggs before she answered. “Their letter said that there were eight of us trying out for the open Chaser position."
I turned around again and found myself staring right at Hermione. She moved further into my room, closing the door behind her. She crossed the floor and gently took my left hand in hers. She gently ran her fingers over the bandages.
“I've wanted to come back since the moment I left. My stubborn Gryffindor pride wouldn't let me. I believed that you had betrayed me and I couldn't force myself to face you. Will your mother be okay with me coming back?" I asked, a small sliver of fear crawling along my spine.
When I opened my eyes, I was standing in the bedroom, looking down at the Pensieve. Rage blossomed in my stomach as I thought about what I had just seen. I wanted to find Blaise and hit him with every curse and hex that I could. I took several deep breaths, trying to get control of my temper before my magic could get out of hand.
I told him what had been going on; how I'd throw up a few times first thing in the morning and I would be nauseous and queasy until about three in the afternoon. I told him how the smell of greasy foods made me throw up, and how I would feel perfectly fine around dinner time. Neville piped up and told Dean how I would eat a lot of food at dinner, then have a snack later in the evening. Dean listened carefully as he continued to cast diagnostic spells over me. He occasionally flicked his wand at the parchment on the counter.
“Are you sure? Not about him, but about going through with..." I trailed off, not really wanting to voice what I wanted from him.
Hermione glanced at Harry, then stuck her tongue out like a little kid. Harry laughed. “So, now can you tell us what we're doing today?" Pansy asked.
“Harry it's not like that, I promise. If you don't believe me, look in my mind." My own eyes filled with tears.
I turned around and walked back into the bowling alley, leaving Draco staring after me with a look of bewilderment on his face.
I let out another sigh, before apperating outside. I landed outside the Quidditch pitch. The door was slightly open, so I pushed it further open and walked inside. I glanced around the large stadium, but Harry wasn't anywhere that I could see. I started to turn away when I became aware of his wayward magic brushing against me, much like it had when we had visited my father in Azkaban.
Once in the kitchen, the three of us pulled out our wands and set to work. George waved his wand and the cutlery began to wash itself. I waved my wand and the plates and bowls were scoured clean and began to fly into the cupboards. Mrs. Weasley waved her wand. The pans were cleaned, the frying pans disappearing under the sink and the oatmeal pot flying onto the fridge.
“Why don't you two get back in line? We'll wait for you here," Harry said. He didn't really seem to be nauseous, just like the other two weren't.
When I pulled away from his lips, I heard Mother laughing quietly. I raised my head and turned to look at her. “You two just look so cute together," she said. I glanced down at Harry and discovered that his cheeks were flushed. “Alright, Draco. Leave your boyfriend alone and come over here and help me plan your party."
“So, where does that leave us? What happens next?" I asked. I was curious to hear what he would say.
“Me? What about you? I mean we were all at your wedding," I said as we stepped into the warm kitchen. I was greeted by several voices calling out a hello as I pulled my cloak from my shoulders and hung it on the hook by the door.
With a sigh, Ron lowered the menu. “Hermione told me that as long as you're happy, we should be happy for you, no matter your choice."
We sat there silently, feeding each other bites from both cakes. I glanced around the room, watching as Ginny began chasing George for getting cake in her hair. I smiled and turned back to Harry. He raised his hand and cupped the side of my face. He pulled me closer until our lips met. I sighed and relaxed against him, bringing my arms up around his neck.
I glanced over at them as Draco's laugh sounded again. I smiled as I leaned closer to Hermione. “I honestly can't believe you two are okay with my relationship with him," I whispered to her. My eyes passed over the two of them.
I opened my mouth, but a blush spread across my cheeks at where my thoughts had gone moments before, and I couldn't find the words to say what I wanted from him. I closed my mouth and looked away.
As we approached the doors, they swung open without a sound, and with no one there to open them. I led him up the steps and pulled him across the threshold. Harry paused and looked around the entryway.
“Not since yesterday. He didn't come to breakfast, and I've been down here all day. Have you asked my mother?" I asked, turning back to my potion.
Hermione released a sharp breath through her teeth. “Yeah. Let's go see what Seamus can tell us about Harry," she said. She made her way over to the same Chevy Impala that Ron had drove the first day he found out Harry and I were together. I hadn't recognized it when she had picked me up at St. Mungo's.
Mother and I talked for a few more moments, then we turned back to our breakfast. At the sound of footsteps approaching, Mother and I turned towards the door. Dempsey emerged from the hall, with Harry right behind him. Dempsey disappeared, and Harry came back over to his chair and sat down.
“Well, Flint, if you must know; my ex-boyfriend had been cheating on me. I found out, threatened to leave him. He begged me to forgive him and I did. Not long after that, he was cheating on me again. I won't go through that pain again," I said. I looked over at Charlie. “It's over Charlie. I'm leaving."
“Harry, do you regret last night?" I couldn't help but ask. He paused in the middle of pulling on his socks and shoes. He looked up at me. He was silent for a moment, and a little sliver of panic formed around my heart. I looked away from him, and stared at the floor.
“Does that mean I get to ride in your car this time?" Pansy asked, coming up to where the rest of us were.
“In fact, Harry's been in a relationship for the last six months," Charlie said, claiming Percy's attention once again.
“We'd better move this conversation to a different room. Otherwise, his magic will react to what I have to say and he'll be right back to where he was a moment ago," Dean said. He slowly stood from the bed, stumbling slightly.
He had rolled over at some point. He was now lying on his side, facing the far wall. I draped my robe over the foot of his bed. I walked around the bed and slid under the covers next to him, so that I was facing him. I let one arm slide around his waist and pulled him closer to me.
“It's a Muggle sports bar. They make a lot of chicken products, but they also have burgers, salads and many other items. Plus, they don't really care if you come in on a date with someone of the same gender," he answered. As we passed by the windows, Harry paused, staring into the building. “Oh, I forgot that he worked here," he said.
He tumbled us onto his bed with me landing on top of him. He slid his arms up my back and pulled me down to his lips. I moaned against his lips, before I slid my tongue into his mouth. He suddenly lifted his hips and thrust against me. I gasped when I felt his hard erection rub against my own.
I starred at him for a moment, then let my eyes travel down his body. My eyes landed on the waistband of his jeans. The jeans were riding low on his hips, and I noticed the top of a bruise peaking out. From what I could see, the bruise was an ugly purplish color and it seemed to be massive. No wonder he was in pain.
I stood and followed him. I found him in the living room, hands braced against the bookcase. “How come you never want to cuddle with me anymore?"
The waitress wrote it down on her pad of paper, then flicked her eyes to Draco. He glanced at his own menu. “I would like the ham and cheese on wheat, with the creamy potato soup."
“You're going to have to explain that to me Hermione. What do you mean that you've been anticipating this?" I asked.
“Well, Charlie said that he'll be available around noon for us to get my things," he said, picking up his tea.
“Why did you bring me here?" He asked. I knew he was probably remembering the last time he had been here; when Voldemort's supporters had brought him and his friends here. I had tried to protect them all by lying to my family that it wasn't Harry Potter that they had captured. His friend Granger still had gotten tortured by my aunt.
Her pen scribbled across her pad of paper. Her eyes drifted over me once again. This time, Draco caught the look. An evil smile appeared on his lips. “Oh, Harry dear, remind me when we get home that I have to prepare the guest room," he said, squeezing my hand. He brought our hands to his mouth and pressed a kiss to my knuckles.
“I-I don't know wh-what you're talking about," Charlie stammered. His cheeks turned red. He dropped his gaze away from me, and with a plop, he dropped to the couch.
In answer, I caught his hips in my hands and ground our bodies together. A moan escaped from both of us. Draco pulled himself off the bed and stood next to it. He kicked off his shoes, unfastened his trousers and shoved them and his boxers down his legs. He stood before me in all his naked glory. My heart raced as I stared at him. Draco climbed back on the bed, settling his weight over my legs as he caught the edge of my pajama pants and boxers in his hands. He began to tug them down, so I raised my hips and let him pull them off of me.
Harry hissed slightly as my magic took affect. I forced the magic through his skin, healing the nerve endings throughout his hand. I gently ran my fingers over his palm once more before I pulled away. Harry flexed his hand a few times before he smiled at me. “Thanks Draco," he said.
“He said he didn't need to see it a third time. He used Legilimency and saw the kiss in Ron's head and must have looked into Blaise's head as well. He just didn't see that I wasn't a willing participant in that kiss," I said, looking down at my lap.
“Yeah, turns out I was more attracted to her cousin Franciois. He was just as beautiful as she was," Bill answered. Everyone snickered.
“Oh, God, Harry! Don't stop, please don't stop," I begged him. His mouth felt so good. I felt my body begin to tighten. “Harry, I'm gonna cum," I warned him. In answer to that, he tightened his mouth and sucked harder. I moaned, thrusting my hips up as I released into his mouth. I felt him swallow several times. He pulled himself away from my dick and kissed his way up my body like I had done to him. When he reached my lips, he kissed me more gently than he had all night. I could taste myself on his tongue. We broke away, both of us breathing heavy.
“Save it Potter. I was a fool to think that you ever really cared for me. You're just like everyone else; you don't care about me at all. And why should you care? I'm just a lowly Death Eater," he said, before he turned and walked back to the window.
Narcissa gave me a look that seemed to be full of regret. “If you insist. Just remember Harry; years of verbal abuse, as well as physical abuse, leaves behind deep emotional scars that can be just as bad as a physical scar," she answered quietly.
He smiled down at me, then leaned down and kissed me again. I parted my lips and he slid his tongue inside. The kiss was slow; our tongues sliding against each other, with neither one of us willing to part too quickly. Harry finally broke away and we were both breathing heavily. He moved his lips to my neck and then he bit down gently. I gasped at the sensation it created.
“You can't deny it Draco. I saw it in Ron's head and I saw it in Blaise's head. I can't understand why you would do this," he said. His voice was low and I saw the tears begin to fall from his eyes.
A little reluctantly, I pulled my fingers out of him. I squirted a little more lube on my shaft, then positioned myself at his entrance. Like he had done last night, I caught one of his legs and pulled it around my waist. I slowly thrust forward, pushing through the ring of muscle. I continued pushing in until I was completely sheathed inside him. I paused, letting his body adjust to me.
“So could you Harry. And with as powerful as you are, I bet you would only need a fertility potion to get the pregnancy started; your magic is strong enough to do the rest of the baby's development. Heck, you might not even need a fertility potion."
“Nightmare? But it was real. I felt the spell cut through my skin. I even felt the blood spilling out of me."
A few hours later, I awoke wrapped in Harry's arms, with my head pillowed on his chest. When I lifted my head, I found Harry's eyes were open. I grinned. “Watching me sleep, Harry?" I asked.
“Yeah. You were too far away and I couldn't kiss you while you were on the other side of the table," he said. Before I could respond, he caught my chin and tilted my head back. He pressed a quick kiss to my lips, his tongue tracing the edge of my bottom lip. He pulled back and picked up his burger.
“You would be okay with a bunch of Gryffindors and a few Ravenclaws coming here?" Harry asked, lowering his book against his chest.
“Why would he want you to go with him? It's not like his father will be happy to see you," Kingsley said, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck.
I took the parchment but I didn't look at the words. Silence fell around us, and Harry turned his gaze to the pond. “Tell me the truth Harry. What do you want?" I asked, breaking the silence at last.
I didn't have an answer for his question. I turned to walk away. “Malfoy, wait. I'm sorry to snap at you. I just don't know why you would care if I was okay or not."
, I thought, dropping my wand and picking up my glasses. As I slipped them on my face, I saw her standing at the foot of my bed, Draco standing slightly behind her, looking down at his feet. Dean was next to the door.
Kingsley sighed and raised his head to look at us. “I'm gonna have to bring him back here and send another Auror in his place. The concussion was worse than he realized. It's days like this that I wish you had become an Auror, Harry. You could've handled something like that," he said.
“She's been crying for the last ten minutes. I can't seem to get her to stop," Hermione said. I noticed tears in her eyes.
He handed the photo album to Mrs. Weasley and stood up. I stood as well when he stepped towards me. He pulled me into a tight hug. “There's more of him in there. This was my way of keeping him alive," I said.
“How about this; Draco can ride with me first, then Pansy can ride with me later. We'll be in the cars at different times anyway. You two can take turns," Harry said.
I arched an eyebrow at him, but didn't speak. I knew there was more he wanted to say. After about a minute, he continued. “What I overheard was Percy said ´oh she'll be good for him.' to which Penelope responded ´yeah, Harry and Jolene could make beautiful babies together.' I know you probably didn't want to hear that, but I had to tell you," Charlie finished. He swallowed down the rest of his tea and set his mug on the table.
“Sure," he said. He turned around and walked towards the door. He pulled it open and disappeared through it.
“The Healers tell me I'll be out of here as soon as they know that I'm not going to hurt myself again and that my wounds are healed. Should be a few days."
“It's making me sick to know that Lucius treated Draco like that and that you couldn't take Draco away from it. However, I wish to continue. I still don't really understand why you don't want me to feel guilty over the physical damage that I'm responsible for."
Harry came around the corner of the kitchen, with a green apple between his teeth, a glass of milk in one hand and a sandwich in the other. When he saw me, he bit down on the apple freeing his mouth. The apple remained floating in the air near him as he chewed on the bite.
I approached the lift just as a dark-skinned medi-wizard stepped up to it. He spotted me as I approached him and held the door to the lift open. I stepped into the lift and the door shut behind me.
“And I didn't tell you because I didn't know if you were gay, and I didn't want to be rejected by you again. I mean, after all, you rejected my friendship in first year," Draco said. I turned my head back to look at him and found him looking down at his hands.
“I'm going to talk to Harry and I'm going to apologize for your behavior. You two better not be at this table when I come back!" I growled.
I felt like I was going to be sick. I now had to tell my best mate what a jerk his older brother was. Fortunately for me, Draco spoke up first. “Your brother was an arse who got what he deserved."
“I figured I'd let you choose which of those you wanted to keep. I know we both bought them, so l wanted you to have your pick," Charlie said from the couch.
“Actually, I haven't seen him in over a half hour. He was in here talking to me and I told him to get out and leave me alone," I reached for my cigarettes on the table and paused looking up at them. “Do you mind?" I asked, gesturing to the table.
“Hey, come over here," Charlie said, patting his chest. I scooted closer to him and rested my head on his chest. He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me into his lap.
He looked at me, confused for a moment before I straddled his lap. I kissed him again, tangling my fingers into his black hair. I slipped my tongue into his mouth. Once again, our tongues danced against each other. I felt his hands at my waist. He slid his hands underneath the bottom of my shirt and ran them up my back. The higher up his hands went, the higher up my shirt went, until we had to part from our kiss so he could pull the shirt over my head. He threw it somewhere, but I didn't see where it landed.
“That's what friends do; they help each other out. At first they didn't want you there, just because of your name. When I told them how you healed my hip, and then how you helped Rose, they're willing to give you a chance."
When Dean finished casting his spells, he summoned the parchment and read over it. “Well, Harry, all these tests came back normal. There is one more test I can run, and I'll need you to remove your robes and your shirt and lay back on the exam bed," he said.
I swallowed, trying to keep my mind off of how good his skin felt underneath my fingers. I concentrated harder when my fingers brushed against the puncture wound. I closed my eyes again and pulled the magic from deep inside.

He suddenly withdrew his fingers for a moment, then he thrust three back in, hooking them so that he hit my prostate. I cried out in sheer pleasure as he thrust his fingers in again. Suddenly, his fingers were gone, and he removed himself from the bed.
