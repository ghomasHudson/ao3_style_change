“But then why warn us away from it in the start of year feast?” Hermione asked.
It wasn’t until that night that Harry managed to corner the Malfoy heir in their shared dormitory, giving a glare to Vince and Greg, lurking on Vince’s bed with a new collection of sweets, to make them leave. Harry flicked his wand at the door, locking it behind the two boys with an advanced charm Hermione had taught him.
“Well, Harry certainly won’t be picking the other side, will he?” Blaise replied dryly. “Besides, that’s not the point. The point is I think everyone in this room has at least some idea of the decisions we’re going to have to make in the future, and Tracey’s right. We have to decide how far we’re willing to go.”
Hermione’s bloodcurdling scream turned his head and Harry’s heart stopped when he saw the troll slam its weapon into the sinks, a bare inch from her leg.
“Okay,” Hermione said, beaming at him. “See you tomorrow.”
on her bedside table.
“Yeah,” Harry finally managed to regain his voice and pointed at the weapon. “Um, what’s that for?”
Blaise Zabini rolled his eyes. “Yeah, as cannon fodder.”
be careful.”
This, of course, was precisely the moment that Headmaster Dumbledore chose to make his entrance.
“You’re Hadrian Potter?”
“What hex?” Millicent asked, amused.
Harry jumped out of his skin when a hand landed on his shoulder, but he felt nothing but relief when he looked up to see two sets of warm blue eyes staring down at him.
“I’ll have to talk to Mother,” he said, sounding, suddenly, very young. “But that could do it – if Father was found to have deliberately given Weasley a dark artefact. With Father’s lawyers he wouldn’t be gone long – but it might be enough to have him in- in Azkaban, for a few years. And Mother would be on her side, he doesn’t- they don’t- they’re not close, anymore.”
The Lady Malfoy smiled at him fondly and pressed the palm of one gloved hand against his cheek. She lowered her voice so it wouldn’t carry to Draco – though Draco seemed more focussed on his breathing and his mask. “Thank you for being here for my son, Harry. If it gets too much, let me know.”
Harry’s head snapped up in surprise. “What?”
Harry looked away in frustration- and locked eyes through the window with one very familiar boy.
“What’s
But the strike never came. Instead, two identical voices cried out in unison:
Harry turned around to see the bushy haired girl from the train standing behind him, looking curious.
“Don’t you think he might deserve a breather?”
Hermione looked slightly nervous again as they came to a stop. Harry opened his mouth to say good night, but was cut off.
Harry felt himself blush and hoped the flush from the cold would hide it. “You think so?”
“I see you’re already building your fan club,” Lockhart laughed. Harry watched himself enact the hex in his mind. “Nowhere near as big as mine of course, but not to worry, little protégé – you’ll learn.”
“It could put your dad in Azkaban, Malfoy,” said Fred, cutting to the chase.
Harry shrugged. He would not show his fear. “I just wasn’t expecting it to be you, is all. Though I guess that’s what you were going for, right?”
“Sherbet lemon.”
Blaise graciously ignored his stumble, and continued. “And what is this mystery item?”
Hermione glared at him. “I’m just checking, Zabini.”
“There’s the door,” Blaise nodded towards it.
“Can’t be shown up an ickle second year.”
Harry cocked his head, already bored with Longbottom’s incompetence. If there was one thing he had in common with Severus Snape, it was a deep set hatred of people who allowed themselves to appear weak – people like Neville Longbottom.
Harry supposed that was true. It didn’t make facing the other aspiring Seeker on the pitch any less terrifying.
“We looked all over for you! Honestly, you need to tell me next time you’re going wandering off, I mean-”
“Well, the first Potter we could find was Linfred of Stinchcombe – his nickname was ‘the Potterer’, that’s where your surname comes from – and it seems that his son married a Peverell.”
“What have I told you about how I feel about that stuff, Pansy?” Harry sighed. “Blood might matter to you guys, but it doesn’t matter to me.”
We’ve been worried since we got the note, idiot.”
Draco flushed, and looked set to argue, but Harry shook his head.
“Why? Going soft, Millie?” teased Pansy.
“See, it’s our brother Percy-”
Petunia stared at Narcissa for a moment, eyes flickering from her aristocratic features to her wand, held just slightly forward so as to be hidden from view of the street – but in plain view of Petunia. Then, her gaze landed on him.
The group grew closer, and sure enough as they approached the hulking shape became clearly hollow – though no less ginormous.
He didn’t know he was saying anything until the words were already past his tongue.
“Your life is worth more than some information, Harry,” Blaise said, finally. “Draco knows that. I know that. All of us know that. Draco’s upset, Harry, because

The parchment began to shimmer, getting brighter and brighter until it enveloped the whole book, window-like.
And oh, but flying was
Harry flushed. “I mean, I just thought-”
“Draco, you need to get Snape,” he said urgently.
Draco’s eyes widened. “What do you mean ‘escaped’? You can’t just escape from Azkaban!”
They were heading towards the bored looking cashier (who had little to do while everyone else was fawning over the celebrity) when it all had to go wrong. Because this was Harry’s life, and since when had it been an easy ride?
There was another hand on his arm and he was being tugged, away from Lockhart, away from the crowd, until he looked up and the sun was shining and he realised he was no longer inside.
Harry gave him a small smile. “Yeah, that’s awesome Draco.”
They waited for Theo and Tracey in the alleyway they’d ducked into after Harry’s panic attack. Daphne had continued scolding Millicent once they realised he was okay, but that hadn’t lasted long.
Harry shook his head, frustrated. “I can’t speak it on demand, though.”
“Purebloods are the most powerful witches and wizards because there are no Muggles tainting their line,” Daphne said, flicking her hair. “Everyone knows that. That’s why it matters.”
Something cold and wet washed over the steadily bleeding wound on his arm, and Harry sucked in a breath as something cooled the burning in his veins. The strange sensation flowed through him, soothing over where the burning venom had rocketed through his body. It was a welcome relief. When the cold reached his head, Harry had to beat back a wave of exhaustion as the pain subsided, and he forced his vision to focus. There were more faces over him then there should have been, he realised, and the red and orange perched on his chest arranged itself, slowly, into the shape of a phoenix.
“Are you serious?” Blaise raised an eyebrow.
. Draco was unprepared for Harry’s quick retaliation and the jinx hit him right in the stomach. He bent over with a gasp but fired back just as quickly:
“You heard Pansy, Professor,” said Blaise, expressionless as ever – though Harry thought he could see a pleased glint in his eye. “Off you go.”
his ‘monster’ is a giant snake. And only you can hear it speak, Harry, because you’re the only Parseltongue.”
Draco continued to argue, but Harry was suddenly swept up in a fierce hug.
Harry eyed them. “…No. It’s blank.”
The parcel turned out to be three letters and a miniature trunk. The trunk Harry recognised as his own, much to his relief – a brand new model, recently gifted by Narcissa for his 13
Hermione didn’t look away from the creature, her sleeve covering her nose. “How can you tell?”
, what have you done to my sister?” He jammed the end of his wand into Tom’s chest – or tried to, because the wood moved right through, Tom’s being dissipating like mist.
He was so caught up in his furious thoughts as he stormed down the corridor that he didn’t even notice Hagrid until the groundskeeper was right in front of him.
“Are reborn from the ashes,” Harry finished in a breath, as a tiny wrinkled head emerged from the ash below the perch, blinking dust from its eyes.
Tom didn’t blur at all when he moved, now. Harry chanced a look at Ginny. Her skin was corpse-white, as white as Hermione’s and Theo’s had been. The memory of his friends waiting, petrified above, rekindled a slow burning anger in Harry’s gut. He turned back to Tom and pushed his fear down.
Gemma lowered her head respectfully once more. “Hadrian’s a good kid, Lady Malfoy. Call it fraternity between housemates.”
Blaise let out a deep sigh, far wearier than a twelve year old should be capable of, and ran one hand over his shaved head. “Oh, Potter,” he said. “What are we going to do with you?”
The twins winked.
Lockhart paused, a glint coming into his eye. “Yes, as a matter of fact, now that you mention it.” His smile was sickeningly smug and dripping with false charm. “I’m rather gifted with memory charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing and I’d never have sold another book – quite the same idea as you’ve had, Miss Parkinson. So I’m afraid, I’ll have to do the same to you four, lest you think it smart to follow through with your threats…”
“It’s fine, Draco-”
And two, Harry and his friends were not the only students eavesdropping on the teachers that evening. Across the hall, sitting in an alcove and looking alarmingly pale, was Ronald Weasley.
upon his tired bones.
“Professor Dumbledore, sir – Mister Fudge. What are you doing here?”
As the group dispersed, two things were revealed about the corridor.
There was less tact used when it came to Hermione, of course, but Harry and Gemma shut it down where they could. He had never been so grateful to have a senior in his corner.
Harry blinked. Where was the wraith? What happened? Had this centaur saved them somehow? How much time had he missed?
A teeny widdle baby chapter :)
“We got lost,” Harry said shortly. “Where did you get him?”
thing was a letter, which would not usually be out of place amongst the Dursleys’ mail except for the fact that to Harry’s shock, it was addressed to
“We-“ Harry had to stop, take a breath, start again, “We’re friends of Hagrid’s. And you… You’re Aragog, aren’t you?” The spider in Tom Riddle’s diary-memory had been considerably smaller than the one before them, but Harry found himself with no doubt that this was the same creature. Hagrid’s old ‘pet’ that had caused his expulsion, fully grown and absolutely terrifying.
That sounded like a good life to him.
Another short chapter, unfortunately, but I wanted to fit a lot into the next one, so. Hopefully you still enjoy this filler!
“Oh be quiet, Potter,” Blaise rolled his eyes. “You could outfly her any day.”
“How are your holidays going?” Harry asked, and Draco launched into a lengthy explanation of everything his mother and father had given him, where they had gone, and the details of everything he had done. Harry listened, and his smile remained genuine on his face the whole time.
Harry turned back. “What?”
“Odd choice of professor, Harry,” said Probably-George.
“Hi, Longbottom,” Harry gave a slight smile, and took in a deep breath. “I just wanted to say thank you, for helping with Hermione and the troll, and- I think I was wrong about you. I haven’t been exactly kind, and honestly I didn’t think very much of you, but you weren’t just brave last night, you were loyal. And that’s something impressive, to me.”
Down, down, down, into the Chamber we go.
Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible, and eventually the three made their way back to the ground. Harry got off of his broom with slightly shaky legs and a wide grin.
“Hagrid!” Dumbledore finally managed to interrupt the groundskeeper’s frantic yelling, and gave a calming smile. “I do not think that Harry attacked anyone.”
“That would be… a snake!” Lockhart squeaked, covering his eyes.
Blank ink spurted from the pages like blood. Distantly, Harry thought Tom might’ve been shrieking, but the burning had progressed from his arm into the rest of his body now, and below his elbow, the skin around the basilisk bite had gone grey and numb.
Daphne sighed. “Oh for Merlin’s sake.” She turned to a startled Hermione with a determined look. “I’m sorry, Granger. There. Are you happy now, Hadrian?”
“So long as you agree-”
Harry finally looked up. “I know what the monster is.”
, Harry thought, inspecting the boy next to him.
Moaning Myrtle rose a little higher until her ghostly shoes landed several inches above the floor, and drifted around Lockhart towards Harry with fluttering eyelashes and a lopsided smile. “Hello, Harry. What are you doing here?”
The medi-witch hummed to herself, waving her wand in the air above Harry’s head. Harry fought to stay still beneath the stranger’s movements, but he couldn’t stand to be helpless under someone else’s wand. No one had ever called him a
“Not you,” Harry got out between gritted teeth.
Pansy brightened next to Millicent on the Common Room couch. “Ooh – blackmail material?”
Aragog clicked in response, fangs the size of tree trunks catching the lantern light. “Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.”
They dived together into the trench surrounding the pitch, Harry following the Snitch, and Teakel and the Bludger following Harry. The sound of the rogue ball smashing wooden beams behind them startled Teakel into a scream, but she kept her spot. Harry didn’t dare look back as he spun between two beams, and he heard Teakel finally lift up out of the danger zone. She kept close above him, but Harry could already feel the excitement building in his chest as the Snitch buzzed out of the trench towards the centre of the pitch, extending one arm towards it-
She was alive. She and Theo would be fine, they were just Petrified.
“Hadrian,” she said, eyes concerned, “They won’t announce this until tomorrow, but I thought you deserved to know first. From what I hear, it affects you pretty directly.”
“The other night, in the Common Room- um, Ron was saying some, uh, kind of mean things, and the twins looked like they were gonna- I mean, gonna jinx him or something, but Ginny hexed him first.”
he thought to himself as he walked away, Draco still stuck to his side.
“Hermione,” he said joyfully, though it came out more as, “Eh-my-meh.”
“They have their uses,” Draco said diplomatically.
The sight kicked Harry’s brain back into gear. “Drop it, Longbottom!” he yelled, and the Gryffindor locked panicked eyes with Harry’s own.
“Still Petrified,” Harry said, jaw clenched. “Listen, Hagrid, we came to ask you something. We need to ask you about the Chamber of Secrets.”
Harry shrugged. “Maybe. I mean, Hogwarts is considered to be one of the safest places in Britain, right? Right up there with Gringotts itself. So if you thought something was going to be stolen from one safe place…”
It did not take him very long to make the connection, and once Harry had run inside and back out again with his letter clutched between his fingers, he was fairly certain of what he needed to do. Thus, he was very pleased with himself when a tawny brown owl snatched the letter from his fingers and flew off in as purposeful a manner as an owl could manage. Harry watched it fly away with a beam on his face, and then went happily back inside.
“Yes,” he whispered, before raising his head. “It’s not much, though, I can handle it.”
Uhhhhhhhhhh hi
“Beautiful decorating.”
Daphne gasped. Pansy’s jaw dropped in shock.
Harry gave her an incredulous look. “Did you not hear what I just said?”
“You weren’t even watching him,” Millicent pointed out scornfully. “You were watching Damien Derrick the whole time, it was painfully obvious.”
said the Hat.
the Chamber was.
Hermione was running towards them, Neville only a step behind while Hagrid and Fang approached more slowly.
(I'm absolutely not projecting. That would be ridiculous.)
Harry shook his head with a smile. “Just the usual.”
Blaise gave Weasley a disgusted look. “How dumb do you think we are? We’re not telling you.”
“Professor Dumbledore,” the stranger said, respectfully.
“I still think you should tell Professor McGonagall,” she muttered.
Harry nodded, keeping his eyes down in a show of deference and his face impassive. No doubt Snape had something particularly unpleasant in mind, but Harry wasn’t all that concerned. Snape would have to do a lot worse than a humiliating detention to match Uncle Vernon. Then again – this was a whole new world. Perhaps the laws surrounding treatment of children were more lax in Wizarding Britain. A tight knot settled in the pit of Harry’s stomach at that thought, and he shifted marginally closer to his friends – and away from his Head of House.
“So sorry,” Lockhart sauntered in, cheery as ever, “Dozed off. What have I missed?”
“What are you doing here, Potter?”
Draco huffed and drew the cloak off, quickly stepping away from Harry. “It’s us. Can you stop pointing that?”
“So the only question left,” Harry frowned, “Is who.”
“He’s right,” Blaise added. “You should try out for the Quidditch team next year.”
Draco was staring at Harry.
Harry made a noise of frustration and dropped his head into his hands. “I just- I feel so useless.”
“Something dangerous, apparently,” Blaise commented, narrowing his eyes.
. He found the family line easily – the Black family, apparently, were a prominent pureblood house. No Sirius was listed, though some spots were darkened, almost burned off the page. What Harry did find was a small, familiar portrait atop a familiar name – the still picture of Narcissa Malfoy nee Black stared up at him from the page. Undeniably, it was her.
“BOY!”
read the book, and then:
He sped away, executing a series of the most advanced rolls, zig-zags, and loops to shake off the Bludger as he knew, but nothing worked. The manoeuvres brought him towards Teakel, who was watching in vague concern. She didn’t seem to know whether to be glad Harry was occupied and therefore couldn’t be looking for the Snitch, or worried about his safety from the Bludger. Harry didn’t spend much time staring at her expression however, because hovering right behind her ear was the Golden Snitch.
They all met up in the Leaky Cauldron, for convenience. Daphne was the last to arrive, and when she finally did they all found out why – Daphne had not come alone.
“Let me introduce my assistant,” Lockhart was saying, gesturing enthusiastically at a blank-faced Snape. “Professor Snape has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry. You’ll still have your Potions Master when I’m through with him, never fear!”
“Okay. Then we get Fang,” Draco snapped, grabbing Harry’s hand fiercely and tugging him towards Hagrid’s dog.
Hagrid gave him a dirty look that made Harry narrow his eyes. “Fine,” he said. “But just so ye know – ‘e’s a bloody coward.”
“Farley, ma’am, Gemma Farley. I was a prefect for your son and Hadrian at Hogwarts, and,” she lowered her voice, “I believe this will be relevant to your concerns, if you’ll excuse my boldness - particularly Hadrian’s.”
She was. Neither of the two spoke for several hours after that, and in fact the next time either of them looked up from their books it was to be ushered out of the library by Madam Pince, only thirty minutes before curfew.
Daphne rolled her eyes. “Really, Pans?”
Harry’s second week at Hogwarts also brought his first flying lesson. Harry, Draco, and Millicent were the most keen, being the only three flying enthusiasts in the group (though unlike Harry, his friends had grown up with Quidditch and broomsticks and the like, and therefore, in Harry’s eyes, had less of a reason to be so excited).
. He went through everything he had read about that charm in his head, trying to keep his attention away from the nightmare surrounding him while also focussing on keeping his fingers tight in Blaise’s jacket in front of him. The only thing worse than being in a crowd was being lost and alone in a crowd.
“You couldn’t have done that earlier?” whined Lockhart.
“And he dislikes me,” Harry replied. This was not a question, either. “So?”
Harry laughed. “Thanks, Hermione. They’re probably just talking about the Nimbus 2001s.”
“On the subject - say, Harry, did we ever thank you?”
“Guys, I think we should be quiet,” Neville interrupted nervously. The two Slytherins ignored him.
“It’s disrupting me.”
“Who’s Nicholas Flamel?” Neville asked.
Harry turned to her, noticing with a frown the rather disgusted look Draco was shooting Hermione Granger, and filing it away for later.
“I do have money! I swear, if I could just have one night-”
Tom pushed the door lightly with the tip of his wand, and it swung wide. A large man – no, a boy – knelt within in front of a curious box. The boy looked up at the sound. Harry wanted to be sick.
“You have my apologies, Professor,” Harry said instead. “I had no intention of causing a scene. May I ask when my detention will be?”
“Of course I remember, Draco, but I couldn’t just let it go-”
else?” Gemma rolled her eyes.
“Oh I think not, Professor,” said Pansy, a rather cruel smirk forming on her face. “You’ll be going first – you know, as the
“S’pose so,” Hagrid said, uncomfortably. “Say, mus’ be time for you lo’ to be off to bed, hm?”
Uncle Vernon was furious. The Masons had told him very coldly that they would “get back to him” on his big deal after seeing a letter-burdened owl leave his house, and very quickly driven away. Harry, of course, got the brunt of his rage, but it seemed Vernon didn’t want to just leave it at violence this time. That very day, Harry’s bedroom gained three new adornments: large iron bars on the outside of his window; a small metal flap on the base of his door; and a thick grey lock to the door itself. The door snapped shut like a cell door when Vernon was done. Harry sat on the floor and tried not to panic. He would be fine, rationally, he knew that. His friends would find him, would help him. But the shadowed bedroom suddenly seemed very small, like the walls were closing in, like the world was going dark and he was back in his cupboard again, hunched over and scared-
“You tell us what you were doing,” finished George.
“A broomstick?”
Harry didn’t answer; rather, he lifted a hand and knocked as loudly as he could, with all the assertiveness he could muster.
Harry swallowed loudly, mouth suddenly dry as his friend finally regained his feet, still muttering complaints.
“Yeah, but just one, and it was opened by a simple
“What the Hell are you doing here?” hissed Pansy, as soon as the hall was clear of teachers and the Slytherins could sneak across to where Ron Weasley appeared close to passing out.
He told only Draco, Blaise, Neville, and Hermione about the Mirror of Erised – and he didn’t tell them what he saw within it. It felt private, somehow. It was the first time he’d seen his parents since their deaths when he was one, and Harry thought this was something far too special to even say out loud. He
“I think we should head back to the dungeons,” Draco said, looking quite nervous now that he realised where they were. “Didn’t Dumbledore say coming in here was dangerous?”
Harry had not known that. “What did you find there?”
“Right now, in fact,” Gemma said, nodding in respect to their Head of House as he entered the Hospital Wing.
“Well, it is. So there, Millie.”
“Moaning Myrtle,” Hermione said, like that was some sort of explanation.
“Good,” Blaise said calmly. “Just focus on your breathing.”
to see.”
“Sounds like the perfect guy to take care of a huge and vicious three-headed dog,” Blaise grinned. “Big enough to handle it, dim enough to want to go near it, and irrelevant enough that it’s no big loss to the faculty if he gets injured or killed in the line of duty.”
Harry nodded. This was something he would have to research himself, he decided. But later – right then there was still a Cerberus to think of.
Harry just shrugged, ignored the slight tightness in his chest, and went back to his lunch.
Indeed, the first year Ravenclaw simply sat down next to him, cracked open a large copy of
Flitwick sighed, his already small form getting smaller. “It’s best you see for yourself, Mr Longbottom.”
I'm sorry this chapter isn't up when promised! I fell asleep last night while writing it - hopefully it's not too obvious... But if it makes you feel any better, we're only a couple chapters from the end of the Philosopher's Stone! Hype! Who else is excited for Harry v. Lockhart next year, hm?
Draco considered their words for a long moment. Harry watched the emotion play across his face – Draco’s mask was good, but not quite as good as he thought it was – and bit his lip. Draco’s relationship with his father was complicated, Harry knew that, and he wouldn’t make his friend do anything, but it Harry had gathered anything from the few peeks into Draco’s homelife and the various implications he’d picked up on (like notices like, after all), it was that Lucius Malfoy was a bit of a dick.
“Troll!” the professor screamed, sprinting into the Hall faster than Harry thought he could move. “Troll! In the dungeons!”
, Mr Potter, Gilderoy Lockhart does not count in any way as
Harry remembered his father, too, but James Potter had died out of Harry’s sight. Somehow, the connection didn’t feel the same when he hadn’t witnessed his death.
Harry gave Weasley one last look. “First floor bathroom, ten minutes,” he managed to get out, before the four turned the corner, and the other boy passed out of sight.
“Our own-”
Daphne nodded primly. “It was very rude of you.”
“I’ll see you soon, Harry dear,” was all she said, but it comforted Harry more than words could say. Gently, Narcissa petted his cheek, and then stood.
Harry blinked once, then twice. Then he began to grin, and before he knew it he had to hide his face in his thin pillow so his laughter would not wake the house.
Harry shrugged it off. “What time is it?”
The final chapter of Alternate Beginnings! I'll be starting the Chamber of Secrets rewrite soon, so stay tuned. Thank you all for sticking with me!
With that, the two boys drifted off to sleep, minds blissfully free from worry of what the future could bring.
“I’m not sure how long that will last,” Blaise interrupted. “Considering we haven’t reached the Stone just yet.”
“And how do you expect to find that out?” Hermione arched one brow at him.
“Heya, Harry!” the first year says quickly, before a white flash blinds Harry’s vision. He takes a step back automatically, but the little stranger just follows him.
The two eventually made their way back to Number 4, much to Harry’s displeasure, but Minerva reassured him with a few simple words.
“Guys, shut up,” Harry snapped as quietly as he could. “So, we go in, we play some music like Hagrid said to lull Fluffy to sleep, we go down the trapdoor ready for anything. Are we good?”
“Hello,” Harry replied, shifting rather uncomfortably in his baggy, tattered clothing, not entirely knowing why the stranger was displeased but perhaps guessing instinctively that it had something to do with his ragged looking appearance. “Can I help you?”
Because that would be ridiculous.
“I’ll be fine, really,” he gave her a reassuring smile before turning to his Blaise, Draco, and Theo. “I’ll see you guys back in the Common Room.”
“Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. They’re the thickest people you’ll ever meet, of course, but they’re Draco’s hired muscle.”
Filch chuckled cruelly when he heard them. “There’s worse than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.”
Blaise gave him a distinctly pitying look. “Oh, Hadrian. Never lose that optimism.”
“But Hermione is incredibly intelligent,” Harry argued. “She fixed my glasses with a second year spell. You can’t say she’s less intelligent than
“Malfoy sent up red sparks,” Hermione explained. “It was rather clever of him, actually.”
Adrian ignored her. “Do you?”
Pansy laughed excitedly. “Oh come on, Daph, that’s awesome!”
“Parseltongue again, I’d imagine,” said Fred.
Draco shrugged. “Mum convinced him.”
Harry didn’t comment on Draco’s stutter. He just tightened his grip on Draco’s hand – for through all of this, through everything, through his lecture and this awful, tense discussion – not once had Draco’s hand left Harry’s own.
Blaise jumped off of his desk gracefully and moved towards the door. “I’m not sure yet,” he said. “But I get the feeling you need it.”
A murmur of dissent rose up amongst the herd, until the one who had first spoke raised a hand to quiet them. “Centaurs and wizards are not friends, pale thing.”
“Pleasure doing business with you,” Fred replied.
“Okay, we’re coming down, Neville!” Hermione called, before turning to Harry. “You ready?”
The second floor was flooded with water, and on the wall above lay a message, written as if in blood.
, Hermione had recalled with tears in her voice rather than her eyes – and Harry was quite ready to tell him that right to his damned face before Blaise calmed him down. Blaise, of course, didn’t actually care for what had happened, but he
“There could be other rooms before it.”
“Oh!” Longbottom’s eyes widened even further. Harry wondered if it was possible for them to pop right out of his skull. “Thank you!”
Harry meets the Slytherins.
At least he would have the memories of his time at the Manor to hold with him. Memories of Narcissa’s tender hugs, and Draco, sleepy and softer than Harry had ever seen him at Hogwarts, greeting him in the mornings.
Blaise narrowed his eyes. “Or someone let it out.”
“Upstairs with you, boy!”
“What do you think, Hadrian?” a sweet voice said, cutting into Harry’s train of thought. Daphne met his eyes and gave a honeyed smile. “You are the local celebrity, after all.”
“But why?”
“That we had better-”
The blond boy didn’t say anything, but a few seconds later his fingers brushed against Harry’s with purpose. It was the closest Harry figured a Malfoy ever got to apologising. He turned his face into the folds of the cloak, and smiled.
It was Millicent. Harry stared at her in shock as she clapped loudly into the silence, followed slowly by a confused looking Tracey, then Pansy, then Blaise, and even Daphne.
“Hermione!” Longbottom rushed towards her, stopping just short of squeezing her into a hug. “I’m so sorry.”
Colin didn’t appear to notice. “They’re for my dad – the pictures. He’s a milkman, you know, a Muggle, like all our family’s been until me. No one knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till we got my letter from Hogwarts. Everyone just thought I was mental.”
The dog trotted closer to Draco with a pathetic whimper.
He wasn’t used to people caring about him. Draco pushed him into believing it frequently with his outward displays of affection, and the memory of waking up in the hospital wing at the end of his first year of Hogwarts, surrounded by his friends still conjured soft warmth in his chest. Despite this, however, people caring for him just didn’t feel
“But who would choose that life?” Draco asked, clenching his fingers tighter around Harry’s arm.
“Ew!” Daphne cringed. “Gross, Hadrian.”
“But that’s horrible!” Hermione exclaimed. “He had no right to do that!”
into Slytherin, you have no self-preservation, honestly. Ugh, okay, let me see.”
“I’m sorry.”
, and decided to ignore it. He moved his Potions work onto the side table and stood up to face his fellow Slytherins.
Lockhart shook his head. “Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved! I had to track these people down and ask them
Number 4, Privet Drive did not look like the Hell Harry remembered it as. There were no bars on the window; no signs of unhappiness save for the slight drooping of the tulips in Petunia’s garden. Harry had always been the one to take care of them – he felt just a little better, seeing them beginning to wither. It was a sign that Harry had been there. That he had been of use – of value.
Harry breathed.
“And that,” said Blaise, “Is why we are here. To let him know. To make sure that when everything goes to shit, he has connections that will keep him alive and not completely at the Dark Lord’s mercy. I’m sure we can all agree we want that?”
“Hello, Lady Malfoy,” Harry bowed his head politely, trying to hide his nervousness. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Which means it is time for you three to go,” Madam Pomfrey said, uncorking the vial. “Mr Potter will be ready to join you at breakfast.”
“Speaking of, we should probably head to bed,” Tracey advised. “We don’t want to be overtired tomorrow.”
The silence after Snape’s speech was apprehensive. The entire Slytherin House was on edge, waiting for something unknown – but Snape simply turned with a swish of his black robes, and stalked out of the Common Room.
Harry meets Colin Creevey, experiences his first lesson with Gilderoy Lockhart, and is bullied by Draco and Adrian (not really).
Harry dropped to his knees, scrambling through the books and scraps of paper, but it was too late. Tom Riddle’s diary was gone.
“Hey, hey, Draco, are you okay?”
Quirrell took two steps back. “Master, you are not strong enough.”
“I suppose-”
Harry shrugged helplessly. There was a bone deep tiredness settling in his chest.
Narcissa didn’t seem convinced, but she nodded nonetheless. “Very well. If that is all, Miss Farley, Hadrian, Draco, and I will be returning to the Manor.”
The snake lifted its head, and replied, “Hello.”
Tracey and Millicent were collecting themselves by the door, and watched them pass in confusion, but Harry didn’t bother responding to their questioning stares, because Hermione had gone red. Her eyes were suspiciously wet.
.” Draco put his hand over Harry’s mouth, flushed red, and took it away again. “Just, shut up and listen to me Hadrian James Potter. From now on, because I know it’s too difficult for you to simply avoid danger like the everybody bloody else, before you go off to get yourself killed you are going to come to me, and to Blaise, and to – to bloody Granger if you must, and if we say it’s too dangerous then for Merlin’s sake, you are going to
Harry hears voices - well, ONE voice - and he and Draco have their first Quidditch match.
Harry screeched silently.
The rattling of a windowpane in the wind startled Harry out of his thoughts, and he glanced up with a jump. Up ahead, a lone torch was flickering. Where was he? He must have wandered pretty far to not recognise the area. Harry approached the window, feeling abruptly nervous.
“Ooh- ah- one second!”
Thinking quickly, Harry grabbed Draco’s shoulder as he was leaving.
“Um-” His voice was higher than usual.
. Harry cried out but flung his good arm forward, snatching the Golden Snitch out of the air and crashing his broom into the ground.
The trial of Lucius Malfoy.
– Halloween.
And with a short nod, she was gone.
Draco extended a hand, and Blaise clasped it in his own. They shook solemnly, and separated for sleep.
“A regular group of-”
he thought to himself, but for a moment let his excitement overwhelm him. He was invisible, for Merlin’s sake! He could let himself enjoy that.
“You don’t know Gilderoy Lockhart?”
(For Petunia Dursley, it was a combination of several things: her sister’s eyes in an unfamiliar face; memories of strangeness and wickedness in the form of flowers blossoming in winter under her sister’s touch; and of course, that unnatural silence that was so
Draco sat down, stubbornly, on Harry’s bed.
“Well- I-“ he stuttered a moment before falling into sullen silence, arms crossed petulantly across his chest.
Obviously, part of Draco's speech and the Hat's came directly from the film. Please don't sue me. I have no money.
“Ah, Harry, Harry, Harry,” Lockhart smiled at him, signing his name onto a glossy photo of himself with a flourish. “Can you possibly imagine a better way to spend your night than by helping me answer my fanmail?”
“What is that,” she said.
No less than two days into the school year, Harry was ambushed. He was walking with Hermione to their shared Defence class when a flurry of blond hair attached to an eager grin catapulted itself in front of him. Upon further inspection, it became apparent that there was a small child hidden behind these features – a small,
“Ha!” Lockhart shouted, triumphant. “The adventure ends here, boys!”
“Oi!”
Harry just shrugged again. They were probably going to prank Lockhart anyway, just for being Lockhart. He doubted it had anything to do with him.
Hermione wasn’t paying attention. “What’s that about?” She asked curiously, watching Draco talking animatedly with Flint.
“Saved by a second year, George, isn’t it disgraceful?”
“If you’ve got a headache we should get you back to the Common Room,” Draco said hurriedly.
“Yes,” Voldemort rasped as invitingly as a horrific face on the back of a skull could be. “Join me, Hadrian.”
“Thanks,” he told her with a wince.
Harry makes another friend, and gets into an argument.
“What? What are you supposed to say after that performance?”
He eyed up the Gryffindor Seeker warily. She was a third year Harry had been told was called Trinity Teakel. She didn’t look like much, but then again – neither did Harry.
“Now come on,” Draco said eventually, pulling back and subtly wiping his face with one sleeve. “There’s still an hour before curfew. You must have been dying to talk about that stupid diary all day. Let’s go find the others.”
The shadows of Hogwarts Castle seemed darker than usual on their return trip, but no one said anything, and they made it back to the Common Room without incident.
Harry opened his eyes tentatively, breath coming in quick pants. There was a breeze on his face and a lamp above his head – he was outside. When did he get onto the street?
“As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realised – a student has been taken by the monster, into the Chamber itself.” McGonagall dipped her head as the staff murmured in distress. “I’m afraid we shall have to send the students home. I’m afraid… this is the end of Hogwarts.”
“Or she used an invisibility spell,” Tracey chimed in.
She looked up in shock. “Oh! Hello, Hadrian.”
Draco pulled back to hit him on the shoulder, and wiped his face with his sleeve. It came back suspiciously wet.
Another flick, and the letters danced into new positions rearranging to spell what was surely the worst-case scenario:
“Not yet, popkin,” she told him with a forced smile. “That’s for when the Masons arrive.”
He tapped his quill impatiently, but the reply was simple.
. Besides, everyone knows that Snape favours the Slytherins, because the rest of the school hates us.”
“We are,” Harry said firmly.
Narcissa bought them ice cream. Harry ate his in silence. He hadn’t said anything since they left Little Whinging – in all honestly, he didn’t know what to say. Theodore wasn’t ever inclined to chatter, so the conversation around him was mostly Narcissa and Draco, but Harry wasn’t really paying attention. He needed to process.
Harry didn’t like crowds. He didn’t like the loudness, or the heat, or the claustrophobic atmosphere. Flourish and Blotts was all of that, and Harry hated it.
Neville immediately perked up a little, though his face was still ghostly pale. Hermione took a small step closer to him.
“What are
“Who is Tom Riddle?” He asked the girls, but it appeared they weren’t listening – they had stopped in the corridor, unknowingly mirroring each other’s pose (hands on hips), still arguing.
of you. I will
Eventually they could postpone no longer. Harry and Draco made their way down to the Manor’s floo room, hands clasped together tightly. Draco would let go once they entered the Ministry, Harry knew, and he held no judgement for it – the carefully cultivated image of the Malfoy heir left no room for public weakness, especially not at his father’s trial. Still, Harry found himself dreading letting go; he found the thought of withdrawing any level of comfort from his best friend to be entirely upsetting.
The three students stared at it.
“Well then!” He clapped his hands together as if to congratulate himself on a job well done. “Excellent work, Harry, everyone. I’ll uh- I’ll just be going then, no need for me-”
“Right,” said Harry. “Well then. You’re welcome, I guess.”
Harry knew this. Of course he did. But he couldn’t bear the thought of Narcissa and Draco at the Dursleys’. Who knew what Uncle Vernon would say to them? Or Dudley? He didn’t think Aunt Petunia would say anything, but that was the thing with Aunt Petunia – she always turned a blind eye.
The dog began to growl, and it was then that Harry looked up and saw what must have been the most beautiful thing in the world.
“What is?”
“No!” Neville and Hermione replied in unison.
Hermione glared, and waited impatiently for one of them to answer her question.
Harry heard Tom curse, and spells being thrown as the teenage Lord Voldemort faced off against the Weasley twins, but the basilisk was already moving again and so was he.
Harry released Hermione as gently as he could, though he didn’t bother trying to remove Draco. “How did you know where to find us?”
Sometimes, lying in the dark at night, Harry thought he had imagined the whole thing. Hogwarts, his friends, Voldemort – all of it, just a dream.
Because of this collection of perfectly normal happenings on one perfectly normal morning, Harry felt that it was going to be a good day. After all, he had long ago learned that his aunt and uncle loathed anything
Millicent made a noise of disgust.
Gilderoy Lockhart, predictably, was the one to break the solemn silence.
Both the Slytherin Head of House and Ravenclaw’s Professor Flitwick found Harry and his friends gossiping on their way back to the common rooms – or more specifically, they found Harry and Neville.
“Alrigh’,” Hagrid said eventually, wiping the back of his hand across his eyes. “Alrigh’. Sorry abou’ tha’. Ahem. So. You lo’ will be helpin’ me in the Forest, today. Just some trackin’, nothin’ too hard. See, here.”
“See?” Hermione said triumphantly, tucking her wand away again.
“How good’s your
Draco, unlike Harry, preened under the attention.
Harry flashed him a polite smile, slung his bag over one shoulder, and hurried away. He was
Harry picked his words carefully. “Your mum said this was more of a formality, remember? With Ginny’s memory in evidence and the testimonies Lady Zabini found, plus your dad’s… history, he’s going away for certain. And they still might use veritaserum.”
“Just give us a place to meet and I’ll bring them. Ten minutes,” he looked at Harry, a tentative truce forming in a single quiet look. “Okay?”
“Thanks,” the snake said.
He pranced off while the students lingered behind, all looking a touch confused.
“Ginny!” The twins broke out into a sprint, collapsing next to their sister.
“Hagrid’s invited me to his house after dinner tonight,” Harry told his friends with a frown that lunchtime, peering at the note in his hand. The handwriting was nearly incomprehensible, but Harry’s wasn’t exactly a breeze to read either, so he didn’t think he could judge. “Neville and Hermione, too.”
“Harry,” Blaise warned.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Shut up, Blaise. We all know you’re soft on Hadrian, anyway.”
Hermione huffed. “So all the time, really.”
“Perhaps,” Snape drawled, “It would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.”
Though grateful for Hagrid’s defense – if a little confused – Harry couldn’t help but be a little suspicious at the Headmaster’s easy acceptance.
“You should really be more careful, Hadrian,” was Tracey’s response, though she too gave him a brief hug.
Blaise bared his teeth in a smile. “Harry has the charisma – evidenced enough by the fact that we’re all here - we just need to bring the introductions.”
“You just called me Drake.”
“So, Hagrid,” Hermione began casually. “With you being the groundskeeper, do you take care of many animals, at all?”
” – Madam Pomfrey finally magicked open Harry’s bedside curtain, and relinquished her iron grip on the apparent queue waiting outside the Hospital Wing door.
Best to get it over with. Then he could return to his room and spend the day devouring whatever books Narcissa had sent him, to see what information he could find on one ‘Sirius Black’. Harry figured there was something smart in learning everything you could about the latest psychopath trying to kill you. Briefly he considered what it said about him, that so many people wanted him dead – but that was probably a rather dark path to go down, so he decided to ignore it instead.
Harry shook his head. “Hermione’s in trouble. Listen, just get Snape and send him to the girls’ bathroom in the dungeons, okay?”
“Why don’t you back off before you get hurt, Weasley?” Daphne suggested with a sickly sweet smile. “I’m sure Madam Pomfrey doesn’t want to see two little Gryffindors in one day.”
He must have seen Harry’s confusion, because he asked: “Do you know what a panic attack is?”
, like
Tracey was already shaking her head. “It’ll be like this all day. We just need to get it over with.”
“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.” Dumbledore set a disapproving gaze on the Minister. Fudge began to wilt under the stare, but managed to draw himself up to his full – if unimpressive – height.
“Shouldn’t Harry be here for this?” Hermione asked. “It seems unfair to be making plans like this behind his back.”
“I didn’t think,” Harry took a step forward. “I never do, really. I don’t care about me getting hurt, not if it can help us in the long run, but you do. I didn’t think about what it might have done to you if something had happened in the diary, and I’m sorry.”
going. The question is where you
“It was actually rather frightening,” Draco confided.
Weasley swallowed under the pressure of Harry’s wand on his throat, and gave a shaky nod.
Harry shook his head, realising too late that the action was pointless considering they couldn’t see him. “We can’t waste time. You guys find a way through this rubble, Fred and George and I will go ahead.”
Draco flushed. Harry got the feeling he had rarely been scolded before.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Of course YOU would believe that nonsense.”
“No,” Harry said. “But I’m certain it has something to do with whatever Fluffy – er, the Cerberus – is guarding.”
Harry blinked. “Oh,” he said, eloquently.
And then Harry was spat out onto the black tile floors of the Ministry of Magic’s Atrium, and the world span back into normal view. Harry stumbled, but maintained his footing. He took a moment in his head to thank every deity and great historical wizard he could name.
“Idiot,” Millicent muttered, but squeezed his arm.
“They’re just fine, Hadrian, just fine indeed,” Dumbledore reassured him. The twinkle had returned full force. “And of course, what happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret – so naturally, the whole school knows.”
It was going alright at the beginning – Tracey would lead their little train of people to each section of the store to collect their books, while Pansy and Daphne (with Astoria tucked tightly into her side) would try and peek above the crowd to catch a glimpse of Lockhart at every opportunity. Harry didn’t really have to do anything except not get lost.
He channelled all of the tight, red-hot anger in his chest into the spell, but even he was surprised when the jet of light hit Lockhart right in the solar plexus and threw him, at speed, across the room. His wand clattered to the floor, harmless.
“He is not!” Pansy protested with horror on her face. “He’s amazing! And brave, and clever, and…” She trailed off dreamily.
“Come on, you lo’,” Hagrid interrupted.                His eyes were suspiciously red. “Best get in t’ the Forest.”
Wynona Ecklehurt was faster than Higgs had been, and meaner too. Harry counted several fouls to his person during the game – none of which were noted by Flint, of course – but it wasn’t enough. Harry spotted the Snitch, and the other Seeker was too far away to do anything about it. He swooped into a dive, and snatched the golden ball out of the air. The manoeuvre signalled the end of the match – and the last try-out.
“It belongs to Tom Riddle,” Harry told them, before they could start squabbling. “Only, I don’t know anyone by that name who goes here.”
“So,” Draco moved on, possibly seeing the wetness come to Harry’s eyes and knowing he would not want to dwell on it, “We know where you’re
“What?” Harry asked.
Harry leaned forward. “What is that?”
“Silence, Mr Malfoy, or you will be joining Mr Potter in detention,” Snape looked to Harry. There was something like triumph and loathing mixed together in his beady black eyes. “Anything to say, Mr Potter?”
“So Tom Riddle will know something about the Chamber from last time,” Blaise concluded. “That would be useful if he’d actually written anything about it.”
Astoria nodded solemnly in response.
“We’ll let you in on it in advance.”
“Are you alright now, Harry?” asked Draco.
A trail of spiders was climbing up the wall, out a crack in the glass of a window and into the night. The vision was eerily familiar, and Harry had to shake the déjà vu, remembering the night they’d found Mrs Norris.
“Who’s there?” He called, suspicion colouring his voice.
“I brought you this, ‘Mione,” Neville began, voice barely audible. “Thought you might like to read it when you wake up… It’s one of my favourites. I hope you like it.”
to heal his nose after he broke it on the marble floors – Harry had felt terrible, but at least it had made Draco laugh.
Quirrell smirked. “Of course. Next to someone like, say, Severus Snape, who would suspect ‘p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell’?”
Harry’s fingers clenched on his leg, but he kept his eyes fixed on Snape’s shoulder, head bowed slightly in submission and his face blank. “There is no difference, sir. They are the same plant.”
“Oh definitely not, could be any of the Founders that lived here-”
be guarded by a Cerberus. There have to be other defences – tricks and enchantments. Which means there is a small group of people, most likely teachers here at Hogwarts, who know exactly how to get to the Stone. The Dark Lord wouldn’t leave anything to chance, either – he’d want to know what he’s up against in getting the Stone. Which means he has a teacher on his side.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Why do I need to go see it if you’ve just told me?”
“Huh?” Harry asked.
Draco’s eyes widened in fear.
“Didn’t you see them talking at the Duelling Club?” Macmillan asked her in a conspiratorial whisper. “Justin let it slip to Potter that he was Muggleborn.”
“Alright, so how do we open it?” asked Draco, tugging Harry (and consequently, Lockhart) a little further from where Moaning Myrtle was floating, watching the group curiously.
him open a random book without checks?”
“It doesn’t matter who the Heir is going after,” Draco told them. “If he keeps at this, they’re going to have to close the school. My mother was writing me about it.”
This was why, after only a few days at Hogwarts, Harry found himself hiding behind a stack of books in the library, and sighing in relief as Madam Pince, the librarian, turned Draco, Vince, and Greg away. Apparently shouting “Harry” wasn’t allowed in a library – who knew?
Harry closed his eyes again, and thought:
“Certainly not a predictable design choice by old Sally Slithers-”
old people,” Daphne said, flicking her hair over her shoulder. “The important thing is: what was in it?”
“Scared, Potter?” Draco teased.
“Hermione who?” Daphne asked, something ugly building in her pretty green eyes.
Quirrell stumbled backwards, screaming in pain, but Harry wasn’t done. He had found his weapon, he would damn well use it. Stumbling forward, Harry lifted his hands to Quirrell’s head, putting one on Voldemort’s face and one on Quirrell’s, watching with a vengeful grin as the professor and Dark Lord screeched and disintegrated, until with one last press of Harry’s palms the thing that was Quirinus Quirrell fell into ash.
like Fiendfyre in his veins. The beast released him with a meaty thud, leaving Harry’s arm to drop back to his side, useless and shaking with pain, one fang left imbedded into the bone.
Harry ate little at the Welcoming Feast. This was partially because it was quite uncomfortable, eating under the stares of every person in the Great Hall, and partially because he had never had opportunity to eat so freely before – but Harry tried not to think about the latter reason.
Harry shook his head. “No, I mean the article.”
“What?”
Harry jerked his head up at Hermione’s cry, squinting through the dark just to see Blaise drop through the ceiling and land with a ‘thud’ next to him.
she’s a mudblood!” said Pansy with a grimace.
Harry was stuck on the news that the Weasley twins had been secretly pranking Lockhart all year – sure, they’d said they would, but what reason would they have to follow through, unless the blond git had bothered them in some way – but his mind abruptly switched gears at Blaise’s announcement.
Harry conceded this point eventually, but threw himself back into the Cerberus investigation to let off the excess steam – and of course, dragged Hermione, Neville, Draco, and Blaise right along with him.
“Absolutely. No one knows how he did it, but he’s loose, and word in the department is he’s going to come for you, Hadrian.” Gemma squeezed his arm worriedly. “They’ll be sending a force of dementors to Hogwarts if they don’t catch him before the break is up.”
, a series which covered the family trees and connections of every family in the Sacred Twenty Eight.
“Well, could an Acromantula do this?” Neville asked, fidgeting with the sleeves of his robes. “Petrify people, I mean.”
It was Astoria who pulled him out of his daze. Her tiny fingers brushed his wrist as she passed him to reach Hermione’s hand on her bed where it was clenched tight into a fist. Astoria moved her fingers to touch her skin gently, and turned Hermione's wrist with a curious tilt to her head.
breathing, though, but the air tasted acrid and stung at his throat.
Weasley’s silence spoke volumes.
Millicent snorted. “Not just
Gemma Farley, Harry thought, was
Harry held back a grimace. He felt like he hadn’t slept in years.
Harry threw him a dirty look, before pointing his wand at the door’s heavy lock.
Pansy hadn’t yet managed to school her shock either. “But what about the Chamber?”
This was how he met Rubeus Hagrid.
“What?” Harry blinked.
He blinked. The murderous voice was gone, and Harry realised too late that he was staring at a wall, fingers pressed against the stone.
“Didn’t seem t’ be. Just Fluffy.”
“No.”
“Who threw a book at you?” questioned Tracey, moving further into the room and grimacing at the water soaking her shoes.
So Hermione and Harry’s study group spread to Hermione and Harry and Tracey (much to Daphne’s thinly veiled disgust), and sometimes even Neville Longbottom, when his Potions tutoring with Hermione aligned with the study group’s meetings. The added exposure to Longbottom wasn’t really increasing Harry’s opinion of him, but it wasn’t decreasing it either. The Gryffindor still came across as irritatingly weak and cowardly, but he wasn’t as incompetent as Harry had initially thought. On the occasions when the group was studying Herbology, for example, Longbottom seemed to suddenly come alive. He would chatter excitedly about different plants and their uses until somebody took it upon themselves to stop him, and then he would blush and look down and not say anything for the next hour. Harry didn’t really understand how Longbottom could be so good at Herbology and so terrible at Potions, but at least he was putting his attention to something useful. Herbology was an important subject, after all – just not as important as, say, Defence against the Dark Arts (at least in Harry’s eyes). Still, as Hermione frequently reminded him, not everyone had his memory, and Harry would just have to live with that. It’s not like he minded being at the top of his classes anyway (though he shared the spot with Hermione in most subjects, and Tracey was only a few steps behind them).
“Draco and I will discuss the situation with him over the holidays,” said Blaise.
“We could go see Lockhart?” suggested Pansy. “Get him to come with us. He’s a teacher, but he’s also stupid enough to come. McGonagall said he knows where it is and he’s going down there anyway, right?”
It was an optimistic thought, but Harry clung to it. Just maybe, it would all be fine.
“Harry-”
Harry looked up from his Potions homework that evening to see Draco and Blaise standing in front of him. Blaise was impassive, though Harry thought he saw a slight smile twitch at his lips, and Draco was beaming.
Harry nodded.
are false.”
Pansy scrunched up her nose. “Just like that? How?”
Hermione lifted her chin stubbornly. “Of course I can,” she said, and proceeded to do just that.
“It’s not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom.”
“Ahem,” said a voice from behind the left side curtain.
company, if she was as pleased as Harry to read in silence.
This is a bit of a filler to be honest, sorry! I know it's been a while. But less than a year which - hey, isn't bad for me. See the end notes for some rambling background info that has no relevance to the story, but which I think about a weird amount.
She was cut off by the sound of someone clearing their throat, loudly. The group jumped, before turning around to see a stern, wrinkled face staring down at them.
Snape's monologue and questions from Potions class were taken from the film. I have no real reason for using the movie stuff over the book stuff - I just felt like it, and that scene is fairly similar in the two anyway.
It was everything Harry had wanted it to be, and more. He swooped and dived and did loop-de-loops around his friends for what felt like hours, and decided then and there that there was nothing he’d rather do than fly
“What happened?” Harry croaked, before he began to cough uncontrollably.
. At first Harry thought it wasn’t enough, but then the troll swayed forward dangerously, and slammed face first into the ground, cracking the tiles beneath its force.
“Go?” If Aragog had had lips, Harry thought he might have been smiling. “I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so… willingly, into our midst.” The massive creature clicked at them once more, retreating back, into the shadows. “Goodbye, friends of Hagrid.”
“You think that’s connected somehow?” Hermione chewed on her lip thoughtfully.
“Hadrian Potter,” the Dark Lord hissed, stretching out from Quirrell’s skull. Harry tried not to retch. “We meet again.”
“Okay. Then let’s go.
The Hospital Wing was oddly quiet on the Saturday morning after Neville Longbottom broke his wrist. Harry couldn’t help but compare the sight of the Gryffindor’s empty bedside and end table to the memory of his own crowded alternates, after he had passed out in the Slytherin Common Room. He had been gifted large amounts of sweets from half the school, scattered across all years and houses – though the majority had been from Hermione and his friends in Slytherin. There had been so much that Harry hadn’t been able to eat it all, even with the help of his friends (though Hermione opted out with the concise explanation that her parents were dentists), and much of it was still sitting on top of his trunk in the dorm room, having become a sort of communal snacking area. Unsurprisingly, Vince and Greg had been extremely pleased with this arrangement.
With that, she led the way into the store.
get caught), the other students had gotten over their silence and swamped Harry all at once.
“Oh come on, let’s bring it in,” Pansy said abruptly, and leaned forward for a hug.
And then all of his friends were gone, and Harry was alone.
Harry looked at Hermione. She shook of her shock, and gave him a small smile. He turned back to Daphne. Pansy was wide-eyed next to her, gaze flicking quickly between him and her best friend.
“Take me where?” Hagrid was looking more and more desperate. “Not Azkaban!”
Lockhart looked shocked. “Well, I-”
The zoo in Little Whinging was everything Harry had hoped it would be. There were tigers, and zebras, and other creatures Harry had only seen in the few books he had found and read around the Dursleys’ house. The last place they visited was the reptile area, because Piers had been bragging about having seen a snake once and Dudley had whined that he wanted to see one, too.
“You could have been killed!” Draco shrieked. Madam Pince stood up from her desk. “Do you not realise that?”
“It’s just the skin!” concluded Probably-George.
Disappointingly, it was not Harry’s friends allowed in first, but the Headmaster. Harry rather gloomily wondered if he would ever be allowed to see them, or if he should have to suffer a death-by-lecture after going to all the trouble of surviving a damned basilisk bite.
“Oh my God,” Harry breathed, before rushing to one mirror. The cloak swished around him, as he moved, and Harry’s heartbeat jumped as he checked his reflection.
“Okay,” Harry smiled at her slightly. “See you tomorrow, then.”
He walked casually back to the Slytherin table, ignoring the stares he got as he sat down. Draco very obviously wanted to say something, but apparently decided against it considering Harry had only just gotten out of the Hospital Wing. Pansy had no such qualms, but Draco silenced her with a glare.
She gave him a solemn stare, her large green eyes unafraid. “I don’t like them either,” she said, and gave him a hug.
“Parkinson, if you don’t-”
Petunia went quite pale. She looked from him, to the letter, then him, then the letter. She swallowed.
“You’re kidding,” Adrian’s smile dropped. “You need to try out next year, kid.”
“Ow,” Harry groaned, lifting a hand to his skull to assess the damage. No blood came back on his fingers, though the painful lump beneath his hair was bad enough on its own.
“Oh.” Harry blinked, flushed, shrugged. “Um, sorry.”
“Goodbye, Mr Potter,” Dobby said, with a bow, and disappeared with a
He hadn’t spoken the Snake-Tongue since the zoo incident with Dudley and the python, but the words sprung forth from his lips without hesitation.
Blaise smirked, though Harry thought it looked slightly forced. “Neutral. My mother doesn’t care for wars.”
“What are you doing?” Tracey asked, following him. “You can’t go in – it’s a
Harry’s face shut down. He didn’t say anything.
“It’s for you,” Harry prompted. He wiggled the letter a little; Petunia twitched.
“Tell the truth!” Quirrell stepped forward threateningly. “What do you see?”
Regardless of the why, time passed quickly for Harry those few weeks, and before he knew it he was waking up on October 31
“She’s all over the rumour mill, everyone knows about her. Though perhaps,” she paused, her sharp green eyes turning to ice and the corners of her lips upturning, “I should meet her myself. Come on, Pansy, I want to know everything about her by morning.”
Harry quirked half a smile. “Because I manage to survive despite my reckless decisions?” he suggested, and breathed a sigh of relief when Blaise’s lips twitched in response.
goodbye.” He jumped forward, uncrossing his arms to latch them around Harry’s neck. “If you die, I swear to Merlin himself I will bring you back just to kill you again!”
“How do you know that, Theo?” Daphne asked.
Harry raced forward, ignoring the whoosh of air as the Bludger just barely missed his broom yet again. Teakel spun after him, but her Cleansweep was no match for his Nimbus 2001. She stayed on his tail however, as Harry chased after the Snitch, leaning down close to his broom to increase his speed.
Harry raised his eyebrows, impressed, but Daphne waved him off.
Harry huffed, and promptly put the Hat back on its shelf. A choking, gagging sort of sound caused him to spin, and he had approximately two seconds to take in the sight of a sickly looking bird on a golden perch before the creature burst into flame.
