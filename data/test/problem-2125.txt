"But that's ridiculous!" Harry exclaimed, his anger slowly returning but this time it's towards the people that Draco is referring to. "Voldemort killed my parents. He deprived me of a the life that I could've had, a family that I could've had! I'm not about to be like him!"
"The flowers." Harry said before reaching into his pocket and fishing out a small vial of Headache Relieving Potion. "Sorry, my head is starting to hurt again."
Not only that but Malfoy donated one million galleons to Hogwarts "in order to support the education of young witches and wizards of diverse backgrounds and status". Another million was divided into different charities that support war victims, the biggest chunk of which went into the support of those who have been bitten by and turned into werewolves. The wizarding world is much kinder to them now but that doesn't mean the discrimination has stopped especially when it comes to finding and keeping an occupation.
"You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. I'm not going to force you to go back to Britain. I'm going to declare it as a cold case, if you want. I'm not going to ruin the peace that you've already built for yourself here but I just need to know...I need to know if I'm right. Please."
"What?" Harry asked in confusion. He looked at Parkinson, whose hand is now wrapped in a white handkerchief. He could see the blood still seeping through but she doesn't seem to be fazed.
"It's really you…" Harry breathed out and his breath was so close to Draco's face that he just had to open his eyes.
"You better be decent, Potter!" Yelled the ever-so-familiar and ever-so-annoying voice that Harry has been accustomed to hearing for the past five years. The door was then slammed open and Harry swears that he felt the entire house rattle. "Oh, thank Merlin."
Harry's head immediately snapped down to look at his chest. He had to squint to see the faint baby blue glow that it's emitting. He immediately reached into his shirt and took out the pendant to examine it closely.
"It could be less of a creation and more of a modification to an existing spell. Maybe, the vanishing spell…" She trailed off, looking at the amethyst pendant on her necklace before turning to her wife who was currently reading the note Draco left. "Put it on me?"
"I just bought new robes! I wore them to the last book signing, didn't I? I could just wear that." Harry sat up and tried to argue but he knows it's futile. It seems like Malfoy is in one of his moods where he's not going to take "NO" as an answer. A challenging stare quipped by a raised brow was all it took for Harry to oblige. "Fine! I'll go get new robes! But…but…but I'll hate it!"
"But I wouldn't be able to find you without it! And we got the inspiration from you so, I guess you helped us find…you?"
The blond looked at the Auror with a blank expression and a tensed jaw. Despite the Muffiliato charm, he knows that they're creating a little bit of a ruckus in the middle of this Muggle establishment. Draco doesn't know what to do. Deep down, he knows that he's dying to finally be who he is. Severus' words was resonating inside his head. While Adhil was the name that gave him glory, his own name – Draco – was given to him by his mother. His name and the locket that he's wearing are the only things from his mother that he can hold on to and damn it all if he's going to let go of either. The Malfoy name may be no more, their fortune distributed to those who deserve them, and their properties having the same fate but that doesn't mean he can't redeem himself as Draco, son of Narcissa…and Lucius.
Harry read and re-read the letter thrice. It was indeed addressed to Draco Malfoy and he is being offered a teaching position at Hogwarts. It was dated exactly two days ago which means Malfoy only had today to send in his response.
Harry just hummed in both understanding and admiration, not really knowing what to say. Luckily, before the silence stretched out to into awkwardness, the chimes by the door tinkled again signalling the arrival of a new person.
The café itself was quite modern, similar to those commercial coffee shops that Muggles seem to love so much. It had floor-to-ceiling windows that let in the morning sunlight to energize the patrons. However, one part of the wall was lined up with numerous bookshelves that customers can either buy or borrow.
It seemed to be an important place. If Harry was to guess, he'd say that Malfoy was in France. He remembers someone, maybe Ron, saying that the Malfoys were originally from France.
The Auror shook his head and tried to will his brain to think about what exactly he's here for: getting information.
It was crazy, he knows that. He also knows that he might be wrong but he would take being wrong over being kept in the dark. This is why Harry rummaged through his bag until he found the items that he was looking for.
"After the war, he became quiet and reclusive…" She continued. "I didn't see him much for the first year. I was busy with my community service and Draco with whatever it was that he was doing while on probation. After a year, I decided that it was time for us to reclaim our position in society. I wrote to Draco, inviting him for afternoon tea. Start small, you know. Alas, my owl returned with no response. All of my letters returned unopened but I'm nothing if not persistent. We were the last Slytherins of our year left in the country and we have known each other since we were children. I'm not about to let that friendship go just because he was being stubborn. So, I kept sending him letters every week. Until, he finally replied after a month of pestering.
"Hey, that was years ago--" Harry objected, suddenly tensing up. "He really was up to something at that time. Besides, this is different!"
Harry can't exactly tell how or why but he can feel the magic pulsing from these two necklaces. They are obviously entwined with intricate spellwork.
"It was fun!" Harry replied, sitting beside Draco and forcing the blond to hook one of his arms over Harry, allowing the latter to cuddle up against him. "Luna enjoyed the birthing part. She's a natural at it. She's basically a Mediwitch for creatures."
"Well, Hermione and I have been talking and…we thought that maybe you can hand over this case to the others. We know Robards put you in charge of it but…we also know how you are when it comes to Malfoy."
While Adhil spoke in that smooth voice – calm but filled with wonder and passion for his craft, Harry found himself walking closer to where the blond was standing until they were side by side. His chest felt just a tiny bit warm.
"I was just going to ask about your cancer treatment program?" Harry replied, unsure of how he was going to phrase it but decided that being straightforward is the better route. "My…aunt got diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago and we've been trying our best to send her to radiation sessions but...it's too expensive and we heard that your hospital has a cancer treatment program that we can apply for."
The next day, Harry decided to not go back to Place Sathonay. Instead, he went to explore Wizarding Paris, specifically the shopping district named "Rue de l'Horizon". He has already been here once, when he was first investigating Draco's disappearance. That was a few years ago. Nothing much has changed since then except for a few new shops here and there as well as the new fashion trend that the clothing shop has on display.
"Has the fire been estinguished yet? What about the occupants of the house?" Harry asked, moving towards the open gates. He half-expected to be thrown out or maimed the moment he stepped through but alas, he only felt a weak ripple hit his body. The wards must have been destroyed as well. It makes sense since the aurors wouldn't be able to investigate otherwise. Harry quickly read through the case file before apparating here. Roughly an hour and a half ago, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was alerted to a massive explosion in Wiltshire, specifically in Malfoy Manor. Alarms monitoring the property went off prompting the aurors to rush here.
Harry entered the house and was immediately hit with its warm and homey feeling. He could smell something delectable cooking in the kitchen, a combination of Ron's cottage pie and Hermione's Yorkshire pudding. It was only when a grumble was heard that Harry realized he had skipped both breakfast and lunch that day.
It seems like the woman has lost her finesse as she began to fire more curses in quick succession, not caring at all about her aim. Harry and Ron were too busy casting shield charms to retaliate. Luckily, the Muggles were safely behind the bar at this point along with Julia and the host. Unfortunately, it was at this point that the male cook emerged from the kitchen, confused at what's happening. Seeing as none of them expected him to come out, Harry, Ron, and Joseph failed to cast a shield to protect him. The woman took this opportunity to fire an dark purple curse in his direction. Before anyone knew it, the cook's arm was ripped off out of its socket, blood sprouting everywhere, mixing with the liquor that was already on the floor. The man let out a painful scream, making their ears ring as he writhed on the ground in pain.
"Come now, love. I'm sure you're excited to test out Blaise's wonderful present." And with that, Luna grabbed her wife along with the box Blaise's gift has came in before dragging her upstairs. Probably to their bedroom.
"Here you go, lads." Joseph said, setting down their drinks in front of them. His accent was very convincing. One would have to listen quite closely and know what they're listening for to detect that slight American accent.
"I sure hope you have a pensieve lying about." Parkinson said. "If you have any more questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them the next time you visit. For now, I have more urgent matters to attend to. These papers are very time sensitive and should be taken care of immediately."
"Potter, you were there that night. You saved him yourself. It would take another war and an extreme necessity for him to attempt to cast that deadly spell again."
The Wizarding World is also a bit kinder now. Thanks to Draco's donation and the presence of both Pansy Parkinson and Andromeda Tonks neé Black in the Wizengamot, legislations that care for creatures' rights are being passed. As of this moment, the "Anti-Discrimination Against Creatures" act is on its final reading before it's to be voted by the council. The said act serves to promote the rights of creatures such as werewolves and centaurs. Anyone who refuses employment for these creatures shall be punishable by law. Harry knows that Andy will fight tooth-and-nail for its passage in honour of her son-in-law. They know that Teddy will benefit from it too because there will always be people who will look at his genealogy instead of his abilities.
"Who would've thought, right?" Ginny commented, nudging Harry's side. He only let out a chuckle in response, too entranced by the beautiful scene in front of him. The two brides faced each other with joined hands.
Now, I would very much appreciate it if you stop whatever enchantment you've got going on because, I swear to God, my head is about to explode from all of these conflicting thoughts."
"It led me to you, didn't it?" He then picked up the cup of tea from table and took a careful sip. The Auror's brows perked at how perfect the tea is made. It tasted like how he would make it at home. Early grey with two sugars and a splash of milk. Harry looked at Draco. "How did you know?"
Harry nodded and fished a tiny folder from his robe pockets before tapping his wand on it, resizing the item into its original state. With another wave of his wand, the folder and its contents duplicated itself and flew in front of all the other Aurors present in the room.
Harry stopped listening to them midway. He was stuck at a particular word that Kevin said. Lyon. Lyon, France. It was awfully familiar
"I'll help you out with that, Nev." Luna offered with a soft smile. However, before Neville can reply he was cut off by Ron.
The two Aurors made their way to the backroom that George has dubbed as "The Lab". It's where he usually works on new products for the shop. It's door was protected by a special ward that only lets certain people see it to keep curious customers from snooping around and ruining everything.
That was what he was. He was flustered. He wants to know why exactly he was flustered but Malfoy rising from his chair snapped him out of his thoughts.
Harry laid down on his bed and stared at ceiling for hours. His body might be calm and stationary but his brain was busy connecting things and clues that are there.
"Funny story, actually--" Ron said around a mouthful of sausages. He swallowed and downed his food with some pumpkin juice. "I got the idea from Malfoy's gift."
"Hmm? What is it? Are you okay?" Harry started to ask a bit frantically, looking over Draco and scanning his body for any sign of injury.
"The fire is strange, sir. We have been trying to put it out in every way that we know but it's persisting." Mulligan answered. "We suspect Dark Magic. As for the occupants of the house, Draco Malfoy seems to be missing. Although it is likely that he has become a casualty. We still can't know for sure. However, his magical signature is all over the place."
Harry's breath became a little less laboured. His arms fell back to his sides as he started to calm down. Adhil made him sit on the chair that Sonya was sitting on earlier while the latter went to fetch him a glass of water.
"Quite exhilarating," Luna said with a smile. "We had such a great time exploring the forests. Did you know that there's a song bird called a Sqatoo that creates sexual tension between the most compatible people that hear its song?"
"I'm going to place advance orders to Madam Malkin's so they'll be prepared once we arrive." Malfoy said at Harry's questioning look. "You better be ready by the time I finish sending the owl."
Harry will forever remember the day on which Hermione Granger outright admitted that Draco Malfoy is a genius. Not to mention have Ronald Weasley agree with it and even take inspiration from something that Draco made.
He had hoped that by going away, he can cut himself off from Potter's roots but fate wasn't so easily dictated. In Draco's absence, his and Potter's friends have became friends as well. Potter is godfather to Draco's cousin. They will always be connected no matter what happens.
The similarities between the main building of Hôpital Edouard Herriot and Building B is quite eerie. Everything is the same from the floors and walls down to the way the waiting chairs were lined up. If it wasn't for the hustle and bustle of wizards and witches as well as the gentle thrum of magic all around, Harry would've thought that he's still in the main building. It was quite obvious that the people around him are of magical descent. Most of them are wearing robes, both casual and work ones. Some of them also sported weird looking illnesses like growing another head or having their skin become translucent to a point where Harry could see the veins and vessels running throughout the wizard's arm. He knows that those aren't something that Muggles could have and can only be tragic results of a spell gone wrong.
"As you've all been taught, Dark Magic leaves traces that cannot be washed away by any normal spell," The Head Auror started to explain. "Which is why it would be extremely helpful if we can come up with something that can tell us if a certain magic like this belongs to a specific person."
While eating and drinking, the two of them looked around as discreetly as possible, taking in the general scene of the pub. It was just before noon so business is still quite slow, just a few workers dropping by for an early lunch. There are currently only four members of the staff on the floor including the bartender, two waitresses, and the host. Nothing seem to be out of place. One of the waitresses set down their food on their table with a slight frown but that's to be expected from anyone that's part of the food service industry.
Adhil and Sonya stared at each other over Harry's head, a silent conversation happening between the two of them. This exchange went unnoticed by the Auror who was now rubbing his temples with closed eyes.
The chimes tinkled again. It seems like the late morning lull is over as customers were starting to file into the shop. Soon enough, Adhil and Sonya's attention were divided between patrons. Harry saw the diversity of the shop's customers. From those in simple work robes to those wearing highly fashionable ones. It looks like "
Meanwhile, the Muggles in the pub, including the staff, had their memories modified. Their minds were filled with false memories of just deciding to go back home and sleep. The injured cook was patched up and sent home with modified memories as well. The Aurors helped with cleaning the place while Harry and Ron invited Joseph and Julia to the Ministry to get their testimonies as well as explain to them what exactly happened. In the end, they the two pub owners accepted their explanation as well as the compensation for the damage done to their place. They even invited the two Aurors back to The Crystal just to chat. Joseph and Julia often stayed away from the wizarding part of England but they think that it's still nice to have some wizard friends.
Harry found himself longing to see Draco's eyes. Steel grey eyes that stared at him in recognition back to what seemed like a lifetime ago. Eyes that recognized who he is but refused to sell him out, refused to let him be murdered.
The receptionist took a few moments to look through her computer, her eyebrows furrowed as she leaned in to read what's on the screen. She then clucked her tongue as she leaned back and addressed Harry.
"Je ne parle pas français..?" Harry replied in an awkward accent, already using up most of his French vocabulary.
"I'm here on official Auror business," Harry explained at Parkinson's questioning look. She was sitting on her desk chair with numerous pieces of parchement laid out in front of her. Judging from the color of the parchment and the familiar scent that Harry can faintly smell, they were the letters found in the Manor's rubble that were addressed to her. "I'm the Auror in charge of the Malfoy Manor Case."
The young Auror kindly smiled at the receptionist, finding her both easier and harder to talk to than Celeste. The familiar face was nice – he was accustomed to the concept of twins after all – but it was also strange because they looked exactly the same, from their faces to their uniforms up to their hairstyles. They also spoke the same way, adopting the professional and friendly tone that Harry could recognize despite the language barrier. It was strange indeed but Harry just shook it off. He wasn't here to analyze people. He was here to find one.
A lot has happened in Harry's life as those years passed. Although, he can't say the same for the Malfoy Manor Case. While, the mystery of who actually burned the house has been solved, Draco Malfoy remains missing as of this day.
"Hey, Georgie." Ron greeted, grabbing two of the spare goggles from the shelf and handing one to Harry, saying that it would protect his eyes from any flying parts or erratic magic. "How's it going?"
His wards were calm. Whoever was behind the door has no ill-intent towards him or anything in the property. They felt familiar too. Is it Vartan? What do they want? Or maybe it's Auclair? But either of them would definitely send an owl first before visiting.
"Ah, that's where you're wrong! It's actually a well-known, well-respected hospital," Kevin then clears his threat before proceeding to say the hospital's name in an passable French accent. "Hôpital Edouard Herriot!"
"Oh! You're--" The receptionist made a random gesture of waving her pointer finger in the air like it was a wand. Harry merely nodded. "Why didn't you say so?! No worries, no worries! Okay, down the east hall, there's a door labelled 'STAFF ONLY'. It's warded against Muggles so you don't have to worry about being followed whatsoever. There are several Floos inside that room. Just take your pick and say 'Building B'. It'll take you to the other part of our hospital."
The blond didn't sit back down on his chair though. Instead, he walked a little bit to the side and leaned his body against the kitchen counter.
Adhil didn't even take his wand out this time but Harry heard several clicking sounds from the front door. It was unlocking itself, preparing for the departure of its visitor. Harry admired the wandless and non-verbal magic that the blond seemed to have an affinity with. Of course, it can also just be the house listening to its owner but it didn't have the same sentient feeling as Hogwarts or Grimmauld Place so it can only just be the other man's magical capabilities.
Harry chuckled and ruffled Teddy's hair. "I don't think the brides would appreciate it if I was late to their wedding. Especially not your Aunt Pansy." He said the last part in a faux scared tone for some dramatic effect. He then looked up to see Andy watching them from afar. She looked magnificent in her blue dress robes. It had long sleeves but the material looked thin enough for the outdoor summer heat. The two boys went over to where she stood. Harry smiled and gave his adopted mother a hug.
"Erm… Thanks, Luna." Harry said, still confused but thankful as well. He would need to examine the items closer and using more complex spells to see if any trace of magical signature was left.
"You have established a respectable and admirable career, yes." Severus argued. "But at what cost? Instead of upholding the name of Malfoy and restoring its former glory, you abandon it in favour of being a wizard with no past, no family, and no friends.
The place was right in the middle of the countryside, amongst the vast fields of wheat and corn in North Yorkshire. On it stood a small farm with an adequately sized barn alongside a quaint house. The Muggles who owned the place were a family that descended from generations and generations of farmers. Every single day, the mother would milk the cows while the father tended to the fields. The children would feed the chicken and the grandparents could be found either sitting on the front porch or helping with their crops. Their life was fairly quiet and they get by quite well with what they earn from the farm. All in all, it was a place where a severed human body part is least expected to be found.
Potter was looking at him with pleading eyes. It made Draco's resolve crumble until it was no more. Potter said it himself. He just wants to know the truth. If he tells Potter to leave him alone he probably would.
"No." Was the blond's clipped response. "My apologies but I have to get back to my lab. My potions will not brew themselves. I trust that you can see yourself out."
Harry laid the three items next to each other with the letter from Sonya right in the middle. He aligned the illustrations together and inspected then closely.
Who knows? Maybe Adhil will open up to him and let him know what he needs to know. For now, Harry is stuck, having reached another dead end with the young Potions Master.
Harry breathed in deeply before stepping into Gringotts. The goblins may have already forgiven him for that break-in five years ago but that doesn't mean they stopped being wary of his presence. Upon entering the building, Harry was immediately escorted by two guards who flanked his sides. He rolled his eyes and went straight to the Head Goblin at the end of the hall.
The two of them finally settled on a bench in the middle of the deserted Place Sathonay, just a few metres away from the statue.
"Harry!" Hermione said the moment she saw him. Ron and the other auror both turned their heads to him. The three of them filled him in on what they've got so far.
"Doing my job." Malfoy simply said. "Get up. You have a Ministry function to attend to tomorrow and you need new robes."
"I'm sorry but Dr. Laurent doesn't accept meetings without prior notice. I can set up an appointment for you through his assistant if you'd like." Celeste offered with a kind smile.
"Draco has always been good with charms." Millicent commented. "He once turned my cat blue back in second year and no one could reverse spell. Not even the seventh years."
If Adhil was Draco, wouldn't he recognize him at first glance? He could never forget the face of someone that has been such a significant part of his life.
"Potter, do you know what time it is?" Malfoy drawled, his voice laced with so much sarcasm that Harry had to wince. He should be used to this given the number of times that he has missed his deadlines. Sometimes, the other man's remarks doesn't affect him but Malfoy seems to be having a particularly bad day, judging by the tone of his voice.
For the first year, Harry tried to look everywhere but to no avail. He couldn't procure a solid enough evidence for Robards to give him permission to investigate in France. He still went there just for the heck of it, in the guise of a 'vacation'. He visited all the cities encircled in the map from the memories. No sign of Draco Malfoy anywhere. He couldn't actually stay in the country just to wait for him to pop up. He was basically just walking around blind without any actual lead to nudge him to the right direction.
"To normal people, no." The woman said. "But to me, your stature screams 'law enforcement' but there's…"
"Whoa…" He breathed out as the lens zoomed into the walls. Harry could see every single minute detail of the wooden walls: the crevices that ran down its surface, the texture of the paint, and the small things on the wood that resembled tiny hairs.
"Malfoy?" He called out to what seemed like an empty living room. He glanced at the clock on the mantle and saw that it was only 7:57AM. He's actually three minutes early. Brilliant. Malfoy should be up and having tea in the kitchen by now. A quick glance told Harry that the kitchen is empty and lacks a certain blonde prat who should be sitting on his bar stool with a cup of tea in his hand while reading the morning edition of The Daily Prophet. Harry immediately whipped his wand out to cast the Human Sweeping charm. Malfoy will have his head once he feels the spell scan his entire flat but Harry would rather be safe than sorry. A few seconds later, it was revealed that the flat is indeed empty. It seemed like Malfoy didn't make it home last night. Maybe he decided to sleep at the Manor. Harry shrugged and made his way to his editor's study room.
The young Auror sat on his chair with a heavy sigh. He removed his glasses and pressed the heels of his palms over his eyes in frustration. He then took out Malfoy's letter from his robe pocket and set it down on his desk. Harry felt ridiculous carrying it wherever he goes but he feels uneasy with just the thought of leaving it for anyone to find.
"Indeed." Agkras confirmed before standing and going over to one of the numerous file cabinets that lined the walls. After just a few seconds of searching, he procured a thick looking Manila folder that he set on the desk. "These files hold nothing but simple bank statements. If you want to view the actual legal documents, I suggest you confer with Lady Parkinson."
"True, but you followed him around like mad! I'm still surprised that the Marauder's Map didn't rename itself to 'Draco Malfoy Surveillance Map'."
"It's the least I could do for the man who saved us all from the Dark Lord." The Healer said simply. "I'll have Auclair give you the name and address of our Potions Master. If you have any questions, feel free to ask him."
"I'd like to stay and chat but a time-sensitive potion is currently brewing in my lab and I should get back to it soon."
"Normal people wouldn't try and find magical traces in a gift, Potter." Draco tried to argue. "That's borderline obsessive behaviour."
Harry arrived at the International Portkey Terminal in France with his backpack swung on one shoulder. After getting his luggage and wand checked, he made his way out of the terminal and into the busy streets of Wizarding Paris. He knew little of the French language outside bonjour, bonsoir, au revoir, and all the other basic expressions so he doesn't really know how he'll communicate his way through France. Harry just hopes that the people understand English well-enough to give him the information that he needs.
"Am I? At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if I am. I've been looking for Draco Malfoy – for you – for five years!" The Auror exclaimed that last part, throwing his hands up in the air. "I've had absolutely NO leads for the better part of those years! Did I take a smidgen of a hint and thought that it'll lead me to him...to you? Probably. But I'm here aren't I? At first, I was disappointed that Draco Malfoy wasn't the one to greet me at the door of your house but once Sonya noticed the Masidec glow in your shop, that's when I started to suspect the truth.
Luckily, Draco chose not to take a sip from his drink at that time or else, he would've immediately spat it out. Instead,  he looked at Potter with a shocked expression once again.
It was now Malfoy's turn to roll his eyes. "I'm not that predictable," He said. "And stop trying to distract me. That draft better me on my desk tomorrow at 8AM, Potter. I'd like to stay and chat more but I'm expected at the Manor."
Hôpital Edouard Herriot was originally purely a Muggle facility, only catering to non-magic folks. However, with the changing of tides, witches and wizards have also started working in Muggle hospitals, using magic to accelerate the healing of their patients and also educating themselves on the advancement of Muggle medicine and technology.
Draco's heart skipped a beat as it always did whenever Harry would utter those three words. He smiled and said those same words, knowing that they also had the same effect on Harry as they did on him.
He was then led to an office that beared a single desk with a chair along with two lounge chairs in front of it. Harry sat down on one of the chairs and waited. He need not wait long. Around five minutes later, a goblin entered and sat in front of the desk.
Roughly fifteen minutes later, he's sat by the dining table with Ron, who he called as soon as he was done with the firecall, in front of Aurors Felicity Thimble and Daisy Grunhild. They handed him a folder filled with information about The Crystal.
"Did Ron ever tell you how he came up with the idea for the amulet?" George asked, scooping up half of the peas in his plate and putting them on Angelina's plate making the latter roll her eyes. Harry shook his head, mouth too full with beef and mashed potatoes to answer properly.
There were no traces left. No body was found, be it human or house elf. They couldn't even track where the Malfoy family's house elves were.
Adhil continued to watch him in silence. The slight falter in his breathing was the only indication that he had heard what has been said.
"Is that a talisman?" He heard Sonya ask but Harry ignored her. He was was too busy staring at the Masidec. He blinked one, twice, thrice. It was indeed glowing. It was faint but it was glowing. He looked at Sonya, eyes frantic and heart starting to beat wild inside his chest.
He was just about to relax, thinking that the Masidec might be malfunctioning and that the culprit isn't really here when something – rather, someone – caught his eye. Harry didn't stare or looked at the person longer than necessary. Instead, he continued to look around, trying his best not to let this person know that he has noticed her.
"Actually, no." Harry answered sheepishly. "It was first used to solve a particularly nasty case a few weeks ago. The Missing Wizards case? A witch kidnapped a handful of wizards and muggles, chopped them up, and transfigured them into various muggle objects. The Masidec was crucial in capturing the criminal and tracking down all the transfigured body parts."
"Yes, sir." Harry and Ron both agreed. They were already planning on doing that but things will be much easier with official permission from the Auror office.
Apparently, this case is bigger than they initially thought. There are now a total of 13 missing men. Four of which are wizards, the rest are Muggles. While the wizards went missing within a week of each other, the Muggles disappeared at the most random of times, sometimes a mere day or two apart. Just like the wizards, however, they all disappeared without a trace. Further investigation done by the Aurors revealed that, out of the nine missing Muggles, only two of them have been in The Crystal. The rest have never even set a foot near the place.
"He would've stayed for good too but his wife will have his head if he did." Harry joked then pretended to glance at the bartender's name tag. "So, Joseph, what brings you to England?"
"Fine," He gave in. "Are you okay though?  You usually barge in at the two minute mark." Harry made that last remark in an attempt to lighten up the mood.
"It's that woman behind me, isn't it?" Ron asked in a low voice, his head gesturing towards the woman's direction. Harry nodded. "She looks nervous as all hell and her wand is peeking out from her sleeve. I have a feeling she's going to start firing curses any time."
They sat in silence once again until Harry grew uncomfortable and remembered what he was here for. He cleared his throat and finally asked the question:
"It was a miracle! Like magic!" A male's voice exclaimed. Harry turned around to see two elderly men talking to each other. Actually they didn't look that old. He estimated that they were in their fifties. The two of them wore business suits giving Harry the impression that, just like him, they just got off work too. However, while Harry was only on his first pint of the night, these men looked like they've already had a lot to drink judging by the empty glasses on their table. "Can you believe it? After years and years of undergoing chemotherapy, all it took was a trip to France to cure her!"
"Y-Yeah, we do!" Julia was the one who answered this time, she rushed over to where the bleeding man was to help him.
The rest of the night went by quite calmly despite Hubert's boisterous laugh that seemed to constantly fill the pub's atmosphere. Harry and Ron took turns going to the loo to drink more of the polyjuice potion. At half past 10, they decided to go back to Grimmauld Place to reconvene about their observations and discoveries.
"If you're talking about the weekly dinner that my mother has arranged ever since Father has been let out of Azkaban in order to mend the tattered father-and-son relationship that we have, why yes. That is indeed today and I'm already running late. Draft. Tomorrow. 8AM. Or I'll send your chopped up pieces to Hagrid so that he can feed them to the Thestrals."
"I haven't hated you for a long time." He assured. His eyes flickering over Draco's features until they finally settled on the blond's lips.
Severus said nothing but he was surprised enough that he closed his book in favour of listening attentively to what Adhil was about to say.
"Open ours next!" Daphne squealed, pointing to a box wrapped in glittery silver wrapping paper. After dinner, they all gather in the living room to watch Pansy and Luna open their wedding presents. One by one, they all claimed a spot in the small area, each of them with a glass of sherry in one hand. Harry sat on one of the armrests of the chair that Hermione is sitting on while Ron sat on the floor in front of it, letting Hermione run her hands through her husband's hair.
Harry and Ron ordered a basket of fish and chips with vinegar and two pints of beer. Harry figured that they really shouldn't be drinking on duty but having anything but beer will definitely arouse suspicion.
"He comes here a few nights a week. He's rowdy and rude and I would honestly kick him out but rumor has it that he's part of some gang and I don't fancy bringing trouble into my pub." Joseph explained before letting out a sigh. At that moment, one of the waitresses – Julia, Joseph's sister – walked over to the bar with an empty serving tray on her side.
"My apologies for taking you by surprise," Vartan started to say. "But I did spend a few years in England during the war. It's difficult not to memorize your face when it's splattered on The Prophet as Undesirable No.1."
"Vodka?" Harry asked. "As in, the liquor? The 'two shots and you're hammered" liquor? That's your secret?"
The bartender glared at him for a little while longer but said nothing. Instead, he went back to his station behind the bar. He occasionally glanced to where the man is seated, perhaps to keep an eye on him. The two waitresses also steered clear of his area, only going near him to place the bill on his table. They seemed tense for the entire duration that the man remained in the pub. They only relaxed when he finally left five minutes later.
The explosion's epicenter seemed to have been the basement, judging from rhe large hollow space that could be seen. It wasn't a huge explosion per se but it was loud and powerful enough to take the whole house down. Surprisingly, there are no casualties. The Manor was bar of any living being. The only breathing specimen left on the property were the albino peacocks in the front lawn. They were screeching like mad but two aurors were assigned to take care of them until such a time that their fates would be decided. As Mulligan said, a small fire seemed to burn forever in what once was the West Wing. Hermione still has to inspect it. If anyone can put it out, it would be an Unspeakable like Hermione or just Hermione in general. However, that everlasting fire is not the only strange thing in this situation.
For some reason or another, Harry has decided that he's going to find Draco Malfoy and bring him home. Help him start again. He's going to figure out the particulars as to how exactly he's going to do that but for now he needs to know where Malfoy is.
"Of course not. I don't even know if he's alive. If he's dead, we'll find his body. If he's alive, it's unlikely that he will show up anytime soon. Now then," Parkinson said, patting off the non-existent dust from her shoulder. "I trust that you know where to find me."
"I know that," Harry said throwing a small piece of bread at Malfoy who easily dodged it. Prat. "But why?"
"I'm gonna miss that git." Those were Harry's thoughts, a hundred percent sure that Malfoy will accept the offer. Why wouldn't he? Being a Hogwarts professor will bring him closer to what he really wants compared to being Harry's editor and "glorified assistant". He thinks about how much he's going to miss the way Malfoy strides into his house like he owns it, how Malfoy knows exactly what Harry needs whenever he's having a particularly difficult time with a certain chapter (black coffee laced with firewhiskey), how Malfoy will sometimes crash on Harry's couch because he's taking too long to finish his drafts…
"I think you need to rest. It's probably fatigue. Here," Adhil said, handing Harry the bottle of Dreamless Sleep. "That will knock you out for around 12 hours. Go to the Healers if your head still hurts by then."
"But," the Healer said, raising a hand to cut off whatever Harry was about to say. "I can refer you to the Potions Master that's been helping us brew the Cell Cleansing Potion. He is an absolute genius, one of the best people that I've ever met. If Mr. Malfoy truly is seeking an apprenticeship – in Potions, atleast – he would be one of the people that he would go to. If not… then I guess you know how to go on from there."
"For people of magic and magical creatures, please proceed to Building B where you will be assisted accordingly."
"I disillusioned myself and watched everyone from the window." Ron shrugged, popping another chip into his mouth. "The thing is, we can't arrest her until there's probable cause."
On one hand, he's already built a life here in France. A reputable one. People are finally looking at him for his skills and expertise alone. On the other hand, however, he would be lying if he says that he doesn't miss anything about where he came from. The letters currently sitting on his study desk attested to that.
In all honesty, he was surprised that it worked. Each letter that he sends Pansy insistently tells her that he's happy, he's okay, he's eating three meals a day (a bit of a lie), and that he's never going back to Britain. That rules her out as someone who will try and find him even if he gives her a million clues. That's just how they respect each other. For his actions to lead Potter here, that would mean that he never did stop looking. He never did stop searching. Never let go of the hope that maybe one day he'll find Draco.
Their conversation went to different directions after that, swerving into various topics that took them farther and farther away from the discussion of whether or not Draco will ever take off his enchanted locket. Harry didn't mind too much though. He's determined to keep his promise to not force the blond into doing something he's not keen on doing. Besides, he likes talking about his family and friends and sort of updating Draco as to what has been going on in his absence.
"Thank you, Harry…" Pansy said softly, looking at Harry with glassy eyes. She blinked the incoming tears away and went over to the fireplace to hang the portrait above the mantlepiece.
Adhil sighed and moved to open the door wider, allowing Harry to step inside. The door was immediately closed behind him and the locks were set back into place. They made their way from the foyer to the living room where Adhil invited Harry to sit down. With an elegant wave of his wand, the blond summoned tea from the direction of what seemed to be the kitchen. Harry took the opportunity to have a quick look at the interior of the Potions Master's home. It kind of reminded him of Grimmauld Place but a bit bigger and definitely brighter. White seemed to be a common theme for this house. While the floor was made of dark brown wood arranged in a double herringbone parquet, the walls, on the other hand, were white. The furniture was also in varying degrees of ivory to light gray and even the chandelier that hung above them seemed to be made of white crystals.
Harry simply nodded and set out to leave.   But before taking a step towards the door, he reached inside his pocket and procured a small item that he set in front of Malfoy, right on top of the letter from Hogwarts. Malfoy stopped and glanced at the candy bar in front of him. He said nothing, instead he opted to look at Harry with a single raised brow. Harry gave him a small smile in return.
"Ah, Adhil, you did not tell me that you've got a boyfriend!" The barista, Emilia, said in French. Draco thanked his lucky stars that Emilia can't speak English because the situation is bizarre enough as it is. He did not need Harry to know that people assume that they're lovers.
Harry remembered feeling nervous during his first match but Teddy didn't show a hint of that nervousness. His bright blue bubblegum hair clashed badly with the Hufflepuff yellow but it also showed how excited and happy he was to be part of the team.
"Yeah! Sorry, mate!" Ron replied, quickly dodging a stunner. It went straight to the wall of the bar where shelves upon shelves of alcohol were stocked. The bottles of liquor exploded and sprayed their contents everywhere. "We'll handle this, protect the Muggles! Do you have anti-apparition wards on? We can't let her get away!"
Harry let out a sigh of frustration as he wipes his face with both hands. He normally had a better temper than this but travelling internationally via Portkey made him a bit cranky, to say the least.
"You have Hermione to thank for that," Ron said with a chuckle as he leaned over the work table to further inspect the amulet. "She's the one who proposed the entire thing to the Head of the Department of Mysteries and she also convinced them to let us borrow their research notes on magical signatures."
"I'll have an iced Americano, please. I'll pay for his order as well. Thank you!" Potter said, stepping to stand by his side. Draco looked at Potter with furrowed brows and face scrunched in an expression of both shock and confusion.  The barista, on the other hand, looked at them with amusement.
It has been years since Sirius' death and while Harry did manage to accept that, the pain is still there, the pain of a vanished a hope of what they could've been as a family. Despite Sirius leaving everything to him – Grimmauld Place and all of the Black vaults – in the back of his mind, he knows that he will always feel disconnected to it being a Potter and having the portrait of Walburga Black screeching about "Half breeds! Half Bloods! Blood traitors! Filth! Unworthy of magic!" every chance it gets.
"It was nice meeting you, Mr. Blanchet." Harry said as he got up from the couch. He knows that he's not likely to get anymore information from the other man. Best to leave now and return another day.
"What's she doing here?" Perkins whispered to Ron, who only shrugged in response. Parkinson is breaking a shit ton of protocols by just sauntering into the property but, in all honesty, the trio were far too disturbed with her revelations to care about protocols. Plus, she's Draco's closest friend. If anyone can give them information about his whereabouts, it's her.
"Ah, Auror Potter." He heard a muffled voice approach him. He looked up to see a junior Auror he rarely saw in the office. But then again, they had a lot of Aurors, both trainees and regulars alike. They shouldn't expect Harry to know all of their names. "I'm Junior Auror Hector Mulligan. If you would follow me please." The lower half of his face was covered with some sort of decorated cloth, probably transfigured from whatever item was available. Harry decided to do the same and pull out a handkerchief to enlarge it a bit before wrapping it around the lower part of his face the same way his colleague did.
The look that met him wasn't that of hatred. No. It was far from that. Quite far from that. Draco didn't want to assume but Potter looked at him with such relief and admiration. It made his heart skip a beat. It caught him so off guard that he almost forgot to breathe.
The only information that he got out of the wizard was the name and address of the Potions Master as well as his role in the hospital's program.
"Anyways, she's planning on permanently moving to France," Kevin continued. "Something about how it'll help her fully recover. I asked her if she plans to buy a house in Paris but no, the old spritely hag wants to live in a countryhouse in Lyon. Makes sense, if you ask me. She can just pop in at the hospital anytime she wants if she's feeling sick again…or if the medicine has any side effects."
The young Potions Master doesn't know what to feel. He's torn between being relieved and being troubled.
"I have brunch with Luna and Pansy every week but even they couldn't get my tea right. They usually just let me make it myself. You would have to have been watching me closely, Draco." Harry teased, the corner of his mouth twitching into a small smirk as he watched the blond's ears redden as it always does when he's a bit flustered. How did Harry know that fact? He doesn't know. Or he knows but he's not about to acknowledge his obsession right now. "So, the necklace?"
The Gryffindors and Ravenclaw in question just laughed at her antics before they all pulled away and made their way over to the dining room.
It turns out that, no… Auclair wasn't as willing to answer any of Harry's questions as Vartan made him out to be.
"I'm happy here. " Adhil – Draco – said, his voice even but not entirely convincing. "I'm safe here. No one knows who I am. I help people. They don't see me as a Malfoy anymore."
"Let me ride you." Grey turned around remarkably quickly, red and somewhat flustered. Somehow, sex euphemisms were not lost on him, but the notion of washing was. Draco threw the sponge at him. "I'm not asking to fuck you, you absolute idiot, I'm asking to ride you as in horse riding!"
"And I always will. I don't like the feeling, mother. I don't like the people." He didn't look at her, kept his eyes steady and trained on the lake. She made a small sound that he didn't dare pretend he heard. She sat down beside him delicately.
Lupin, safe to say, really had no idea what to say to it all. He just stared at Draco in sad, perplexed silence, looking like he very much wanted to say 'Draco, I'm so sorry', but had the clarity to keep his mouth shut, because he knew full well what would happen if he did say it.
I'm so sorry that this took so long to come out, I've been really busy (hating my life) and have also just posted a new fic called 'wine bottles and smashed glasses' based on the musical 36 questions, so please do go check that out if you're interested!
"This here, is the entrance to my quarters." He said, gesturing to an ornate door near the end of the corridor at the top of the stairs. Grey nodded. Kelpies were normally well kept up to a point, so Draco could only assume that it was the market making him this filthy. He opened the door which led into a large living room combined with a study, two doors on opposing sides of the rooms. "Wait. I'll go fetch you a towel and something to wear." Grey gave him a look that was not quite appreciative or a glare. It was quite a bland expectant look, and Draco took it to say 'yes of course kind sir, I will wait here patiently, you have been so good to me'. Of course, that's not what it meant, and Draco knew it, but there was always the glimmer of imagination that daunted the corners of his vision.
"If you're all quite done staring, it's lunch and your food is bound to be getting cold." She shouted at them, voice high and posh. It took a moment for all of the students to turn around and begin muttering amongst themselves, but Draco could still feel half the hall's eyes on his back. He sipped his wine again laconically, smiling in a similar fashion at Blaise who seemed to take it as a joke and smirked back.
"Oh, fuck." He swore quietly. Harry noted that his voice was shaking almost as much as his hands. He finished rounding the corner and came into Aidan's view. His face snapped to Harry's, slightly manic, panicked, though it was clear he was trying to keep up a façade. "Oh Harry, darling, sorry about this, just dropped one of the glasses," His speech was rushed, and his smile was pulling to tightly at the corners of his lips. Harry was aware that his own expression was pulled into a sad frown, eyes narrowed in anger. "I'll clean it up, no need to be upset, see-"
Thanks again for reading! Please do leave a comment if there's anything you want to see more of, anything you liked, or any constructive criticism, it's always really appreciated and I love reading your comments!
"Good morning, professor."  he responded glacially, not letting his eyes leave Lupin's. "Yes, this is a new cat." Because, really, he ought to respond. You ought to when posed with a harmless direct question. Lupin nodded, crouching down and sicking an arm out to Grey. Draco was bewildered.
The banging noise increased. Increased? Draco hadn't realised they had been continuously knocking. Fucking rude. He strode over to the door leaving bloody footprints in his wake and threw open the door.
"You don't have to be so loud about wanting to fuck him." Pansy said haughtily, looking at them with a not quite glare that got across the message of displeasure whilst also telling them how much she loved them to let her behave like that.
"I'd prefer both, if you didn't mind." Draco lowered his eyebrow till it was more of a vaguely amused frown. Lupin didn't know how he did it.
"I don't want to hurt you Draco, but I need to get you to calm down." Lupin said evenly, hands still raised, standing slowly from the chair. Draco's back hit the wall and he pressed himself against it defensively, ready to strike at any moment. One of Lupin's hands went down slowly to where his wand was, and Draco hissed loudly, a clear message. His hand left and went back up, almost defending his chest. "Ok, ok, no wands. I just need you to calm down." How many times had he said that? Draco wasn't sure. It must have been a lot. The ends of his fingers elongated and blackened, turning to wicked claws that blood always seemed to stand out starkly on. He bared his teeth at Lupin, wishing he could snarl without loosing anymore of his dignity. Grey, who seemed to have been watching the entire altercation jumped onto the desk and meowed loudly, an almost wailing noise. Lupin span round to look at him. Draco got the message: stand down, it's fine. He blinked menacingly.
A loud shout rang out behind him. It was another kelpie, huge and black with a straggled mane rearing and shrieking within a group of aurors who appeared to be berating a new recruit for letting it out. Grey pressed against the far end of the bars and seethed. It fell, great a huge with a resounding slap against the cold stone.
"You can't sleep in the lake." He finally uttered. He was completely for Grey having a normal habitat for a kelpie, but if they were to spend any time together, Grey could not be in the lake. It was one of the reasons he had dragged Grey along. He, in turn, received a glare.
"Fine. Fine. I'm fine." Draco had meant it to sound final, but it sounded more airy than anything. Everyone stared at him, a single 'did you not just experience what I saw' unanimously on the tip of their lips. "Just an Azkaban thing." He didn't realise what he was saying until he said it, and so he said it again. "Just an Azkaban thing.
"Very helpful." A voice said from behind him, and before Draco could snap, he turned around and saw that it was Sam.
He was never dry. Just wet and cold and miserable. He didn’t want to go home; he didn’t really have one anymore. What he had was the shell of his childhood, cracked in too many places for the hope of fixing it, and now it sat like a heavy, broken ornament. Like something on display only for the reason of showing what would happen if you weren’t careful. He hugged his knees tighter, wishing that the breaking of the waves would cease so he could finally have his serenity.
Grey strode over the surface to where the body lay, thrust up by the current. Draco, he realised, was beautiful. Even in this state, his skin glowed akin to the moon, lighting the fragile water that lapped around him and illuminating his features in eerily alluring ways. The sharp jut of his cheek bones seemed sharper, his cheeks gaunter than they ought to be, but even this underweight seemed to suit him well in a morbid beauty.
"You'll have to stop doing that Blaise, you look unbelievably sexy. Yes Pansy darling, the gifts were wonderful. I love them." He didn't say it, but they all knew what it meant. Draco wasn't quite the kind of person to say 'I love you' so this was about as close as it got. The pair of them genuinely smiled, wide and bright, and Pansy wound both of her arms around Draco's right one, leaning into his shoulder.
The sound of metal vibrations rang through the market, and as he came back to it, Draco realised that it was the sound of the beings and creatures thrashing against their cages, clanging on the brittle bars to be let out. Some, he noted with interest, weren't magical or special at all. One of the faces was a boy he had briefly seen at some gala a few years ago, who appeared to be being held for ransom. His face was dirt streaked and terrified as he called for the aurors to come and let him out. None of them paid attention, much to wrapped up in the capture of the vendors and customers.
"Draco, darling!" Narcissa cried desperately. "Are you alright?!" He looked up at her with wonderous grey eyes, sharp and narrow. Then he laughed. He couldn't help it, it was just so bizarre. His mother was kneeling in a freezing lake he had just fallen into by means of his own stupidity, and she had the gall to be worried about him. He laughed harder and harder, but no shortness of breath stopped him. Narcissa looked wonderfully concerned.
"This is a Magical Signature Detecting device. The Masidec for short," Potter started to explain. Draco let out a snort upon hearing the name that they've given to the necklace or, should he say, device. "Couldn't we have picked a better name? Sure. But functionality won over creativity. And this little thing is why I'm here, right in front of you, Adhil or perhaps I should call you Draco."
Vartan was in the middle of chewing their food when Harry spoke. They seemed to be surprised judging by how they choked on their food followed by a coughing fit.
"Isn't it true?" Draco rhetorically asked with a sneer on his face that was awfully familiar to Harry. "Aren't you just in the Auror force because it's what's expected of you? The Golden Boy, Defeater of Dark Lords, the boy who was chased down by dark wizards all his life decided that chasing more dark wizards is the perfect life for him! I may be wrong but that is fucking ridiculous. You deserve a quiet life where you have nothing to worry about except taking care of the next generation of Weasleys."
However, she never did work well under pressure. The moment that she sensed Aurors patrolling the area, she stopped herself from getting another victim, scared that she'll get caught. However, the frustration of not being able to carry out her self-sworn duty while being forced to deal with men that she hated got to her. She became paranoid and fidgety. She felt like eyes were watching her everywhere she goes. In the first weeks of the patrol, Geneva stayed in her house. She only went outside for work. This routine worsened her paranoia. And so, she decided to bring some normality back in her life by visiting The Crystal.
Those were the first things that Harry Potter got a whiff of once he opened the front door. His lips immediately quirked into a soft smile as he imagined the scene that's already waiting for him.
Harry knocked and opened the door to see George leaning over his working table, holding tools that Harry is unfamiliar with while wearing a pair of strange looking goggles.
It was then that Harry saw the lone package sitting on the mantelpiece, just below the portrait that he gave.
He stood still until he felt the chain go over his head, leaving his neck bare and his chest surprisingly light.
"Because," Malfoy began. "I'm the only one who has the expertise on the field of language due to my childhood tutoring and higher education. Plus, I'm the only one who has the guts to bite your arse whenever you're being an insufferable prat."
"Wounds inflicted as sacrifice for blood magic should heal on their own. No healing spell or salve will accelarate the process." Parkinson replied as she turned toward the direction of the gates. "Now, seeing as I have quite a lot of legal matters to take care of, I shall take my leave. Although, I would appreciate it if you inform me of…anything about Draco."
Harry sighed and looked at Parkinson. He opened his mouth to say something but she spoke again, cutting whatever he was about to say.
Harry immediately jolted upright from his bed, his wand out and aimed at the door. It took him three whole seconds to recognize the voice that bellowed throughout the hallways of his house. Unfortunately, it took less than that for his guest to make the flight of stairs and slam his bedroom door open.
Harry walked past the waiting area wand headed over to the receptionist. He almost jumped in surprise when the witch behind the desk looked up because he spoke to that same face mere minutes ago.
Harry wandlessly turned on the lights in the room and looked down at the Masidec that was still hanging on his neck. It still contained Draco's magical signature.
"It's a kind of song bird that sings to make people horny." Pansy supplied with a chuckle at their friends' questioning looks. The others let out varying sounds of understanding before they shared a good laugh, not because they find anything particularly funny but because of how they could feel the strong bond of friendship that they shared.
"Dragons can be as harmful as Dark Lords though…" Harry mumbled, earning him a slap on the arm from Draco.
"Fine. We'll get him the Firebolt." Draco said making Harry smile so bright and wide that it made the blond's heart flutter like it just grew wings.
"Huh? Told him what?" Harry asked, looking between Ron and George in confusion. The two exchanged amused looks as he waited for anyone to answer.
His eyes scanned every single detail on Draco's face: from the strands of platinum locks that fell over his forehead to the slightly upturned nose down to his lips that looked so soft, Harry almost wanted to touch them.
Adhil went to look through the peephole. His knees almost gave out when he saw who was behind the door.
Harry fell back on the bed so he grabbed a pillow and threw it hard in Malfoy's general direction. He was sporting a mild headache and it was probably from drinking a third of the firewhiskey last night. For some reason, he had trouble sleeping. Hermione banished all of the Dreamless Sleep in the house for fear that Harry become dependent on it. Atleast drinking helps.
As Head of the Investigation Department, a lot of things are demanded from him, expected of him. He couldn't just ignore all of that to go traipsing in France in search for a blond git just because his "gut" tells him to. Besides, he also has his family to take care of. He has a family now. Andromeda and Teddy. Nothing much changed at first but, soon enough, Andy started to treat Harry like her own son, making sure that he's not overworking himself and that he's eating properly and on time. Despite not saying anything about it, Harry knows that Andy truly appreciated what Draco did.
"How's it going, Angie?" Harry greeted once they caught sight of Angelina on the till, ringing up a kid's purchase.
"Oh, that's fine!" The woman said with a welcoming smile as she switched to an accented English with ease. "Hi, what can I do for you today?"
"Ah, that's why you look a little uneasy." Andy commented before tapping her wand on Harry's chest. He let out a sigh of relief at the feeling of the cloth loosening a bit.
Pansy highly doubts that Draco is actually dead but she also knows that it is highly unlikely for her to see him again in this lifetime. Draco definitey doesn't want to be found but Potter seemed determined. He is the Golden Boy and the Savior of the Wizarding World after all. Not to mention the head of the Investigative Department, the office responsible for solving some of the most difficult cases that the Ministry has ever seen. Pansy is hoping that maybe instead of finding Draco and bringing him back to London, Potter will end up finding so much more than that.
Harry was immediately reminded of the crystal balls that Professor Trelawney made them stare into for hours to attempt to read their futures. In the end, he and Ron would just say some made-up bullshit like seeing winged serpents falling from the sky and the water in the Black Lake turning a bright bubblegum pink and being filled with suds.
"Well, I have to say that this is the most intensive and intricate thing that I've ever worked on," The elder Weasley commented. "I'm surprised that the prototype is doing well despite the short amount of time that we have."
Harry looked at his best friends with pleading eyes, hoping that they would either understand or just leave him be. Hermione was just about to say something when Ron laid a gentle hand on her shoulder to stop her. He then took a deep breath.
The use of the old nickname almost made Harry frown if only he didn't detect a slight fondness embedded into the way Malfoy said it. That made Harry feel warm, similar to how he felt upstairs after bickering with the blonde git.
However, her mind was so fragile and she was insane enough as it is so she snapped at the first sign of a man being disrespectful towards a woman.
"If I learned anything from Draco in the past years, it's that it will never be too early to drink. Besides, it's helping me cope with the fact that I've been a shite bestfriend… never realizing that Draco needed help until it's too late." Parkinson said, tilting the glass slightly as if to clink it with another non-existent glass. She then downed the alcohol in one go.
Harry half expected the room to feel like an asylum or a hospital ward what with all the whiteness but it was anything but that. Elegance and sophistication dripped from every item. It felt like each piece was carefully chosen to compliment each other. It was refreshing and sort of uplifting. Two tall windows helped with the refreshing ambience. Harry figured that they would normally allow natural sunlight to shine into the living room but the impending storm prevented that from happening.
"I know this symbol. I know this flower. It's on the wax seal of his letter." Harry informed them, struggling to keep his voice even. "It's a daffodil."
"Potter," Parkinson spoke formally as Harry entered her office. "How nice of you to drop by. Have a seat."
Harry entered his office that very same afternoon, eager to view the memories that Parkinson provided. If everything goes according to plan, he would still have time to go to Ron and Hermione's for their scheduled dinner.
The shop was empty save for him, Adhil, and Sonya. The elderly woman that Adhil was assisting earlier was now done with her purchase and had just stepped out of the door. Harry knows that it wouldn't be empty for long. Adhil mentioned that "La Jonquille" had a slow but steady stream of customers. Most of their regular clients order their potions via owl post anyways.
"We would have to perform the necessary spells to determine who this arm belongs to. If it's a wizard's, it will probably still have atleast an ounce of its magical signature." Robards explained. "If it's a Muggle's, we have to send if over for DNA testing. Nonetheless, considering the interference in the spellwork, it would definitely still have traces of dark magic that will help us identify the culprit.
"I…headache…" His utterance was followed by a loud groan as a sharp bolt of excruciating pain hit him. It was getting more intense by the minute. He clutched his head in both of his hands in an attempt to subdue the agony but it was obviously not working.
In the days that passed, no additional disappearances were reported. This was mostly due to the rotational patrol shifts that the Auror office has implemented. However, additional severed body parts were found, adding truth to the speculation that perhaps none of their victims are alive or in one piece. Most of these parts were found in Muggle areas which gave the DMAC quite a headache.
With every year that passed, Pansy could see the light and fire slowly vanish from Potter's eyes, extinguished by the repetitive routine and the act of doing whatever the hell would please everyone. The war is over indeed but Potter has never and will never stop being the Chosen One. He could do whatever he pleases, yes but she highly doubts that Potter could take the backlash. And so, the man's spirit diminished. However, Pansy's life wasn't the only thing that changed in the past 24 hours. For the first time in years, she could see the flicker of determination in Potter's eyes grow stronger. The fire was starting to burn again.
"Ladies and gentlemen," The Ministry official began, successfully shushing the crowd who, before then, were murmuring  in awe at the sight in front of them. Harry can't blame them though. Pansy and Luna were positively glowing with love for each other. "We are all gathered here today to witness the union of two faithful souls…"
"Why am I 'Potter' everytime I do something?" Harry mumbled as he dusted off what little crumbs he could find. "What do you think we should buy for Teddy? The Firebolt Thunder 2000 or the Tornado 1000? I heard that they're both very good."
"Ah, that's Pansy Parkinson-Lovegood to you, love." She corrected before letting out a gasp at the gifts that Harry was holding. Pansy gently took the bottle of sherry from his hand and examined it closely. "Morgana's saggy tits… Is this actual Goblin-made sherry? Goblin-made sherry from the 1940s? A decade after sherries were invented? Harry James Potter, you are a man after my own heart. Too bad I don't like men, though."
Harry felt a bit relieved at that. Being known as a faux criminal was preferable over having a stalker all the way from France.
They were currently looking at thim with shock and confusion but, beneath that, Harry can detect something that he failed to see years ago: life.
"Not very often. Once every two months maybe. And I've only started writing to her a year ago." Draco explained, standing up to return the bottle of brandy to its proper place himself. "She's still quite cross with me."
Harry glanced at the window and saw that a familiar shock of blond hair was already standing by the shelves. It makes sense. It's already nearing noon and the shop probably opens at a god awful time of the day.
There was a long bout of silence as the blond contemplated this while Harry just lay there watching him nervously. He was just about to say something to break the tense silence when Draco sat up. He took a deep breath and looked at Harry with a serious expression.
"I'd like to think that that's not the case. Besides, only Malfoy's magical signature was detected across the property. It couldn't have possibly been anyone but him."
The two Aurors immediately got to their feet but the woman was quicker. She has already managed to cast an Entrail-Expelling Curse at the man, causing a mixture of blood and intestines to spill out from his abdomen to the floor. The group erupted into screams as the Muggles scrambled to help their friend and back away from the woman at the same time.
"Wouldn't it be better if you get Hermione's help with that?" Angelina asked. "Things will progress at a faster rate."
A few days later, Harry has come up with a plan. He has extended his leave for another week. He didn't ask around nor did he threaten anyone for information. Instead, he wrote two letters to two people. One is to confirm what he already knows – or atleast, what he thinks he already knows – while the other one is to ask simple questions. Simple questions that would greatly help him. His brain is still a bit muddled and confused but throughout the days, he realized that thinking about Adhil and Draco being the same person has become easier.
All Harry did was watch him. Stare at him. Try to make the connection between Adhil's face and Draco's name. But he can't and it's starting to frustrate him. He wants nothing more than to rip off that damned locket from the blond's neck, along with it the effect of the enchantment. He can't do that though. He'll sooner get his ass hexed off than even get close to the locket. Besides, the necklace was pass on to Draco by his mother. It's a family heirloom. Probably the only family heirloom that he has after burning the Manor to the ground.
Harry snorted. Of course they wouldn't tell Muggles about where the "medicine" came from. Not only was it a very common potion to brew – only slightly more complicated than the polyjuice – but its ingredients aren't what one would consider rare. Get that information out into the Muggle world and corporations are sure to capitalize on it.
There's no denying that the three items all hold the same flower. He didn't recognize it at first because of how small the illustration was but
"Yeah, from those enchanted necklaces you gave Luna and Pansy as wedding gifts." Harry elaborated, taking the Masidec off and placing it on Draco's outstretched hand. The blond examined it closely, even picking up his wand and tapping it in random places. "They think that your spellwork is a work of art. Hermione even said that you were a genius! Or was it Ron? I think it was the both of them which was surprising. Well, not the part that you're a genius because I know you're smart and talented. It was obvious back in school. You were a git, yeah, but still a…smart and…uh…talented git. Yes.
The moment he heard the door close and the locks be put back into place, Adhil let out a breath that he hadn't realized he was holding. He then fell back onto the couch, mind running a million miles a minute.
Harry was just about to say something when he saw Draco wandlessly summon a bottle of brandy from one of the kitchen cupboards – one that's just above and behind Harry's head – and poured quite a lot of it into his tea cup.
I will always be grateful to everyone who has given this fic a chance. Thank you so much for reading!
"Like what? Stealing a dragon from Gringotts?" He joked, making Ron laugh. It's been years so they really don't mind joking about the wild things that they did during the war. Besides, anyone who thinks that stealing a dragon from a heavily guarded facility isn't cool and bucketlist worthy is probably a fool who enjoys watching paint dry.
Draco's first reaction was to recoil from the pair of hands that reach out to him. Was he going to get strangled to death? That was his initial thought. However, he calmed down a bit when Potter grabbed the chain of his necklace. He calmed down a bit but it was immediately replaced with a spike of fear and panic.
"What?" Ron asked, turning back to look at the portrait hanging above the mantlepiece. His mouth fell open at the sight before him. "Holy shit… That's awesome! They're glowing…"
"D-Draco Malfoy?!" They said, pounding their fist on their chest. "He's been missing? For the last five years?"
Harry was the one who deduced that these disappearances might be connected despite the difference in the victims' profiles. He saw the pattern by which these wizards disappeared; no signs of struggle, no evidence left, not even a magical signature implying that the unsub either didn't use magic or went through the means of covering up their tracks, and all gone roughly a week apart. Harry's belief was further strengthened by the disappearance of the latest victim. His ability to come up with these conclusions is the reason why he rejected the Head Auror position when it was offered to him. Solving these puzzles, connecting evidence that doesn't seem to be connected at first glance, and thinking outside the box, thinking like the criminal. That's what brings most of the excitement in Harry's life. Being Head Auror will reduce his job to just signing stacks of paperwork and dealing with the bureaucracy and politics of the workplace. He figured that he would go insane on the first day.
I won't lie to you on this, but this fic is more of my side project. My main one is Prince Omega, a 31 chapter, 150K word behemoth that is still ongoing. But, I am planning to work on both, but this one will not be the priority and will likely update less often. I don't plan on abandoning it though, I truly love this story and want to get it written down. Updates may be spotty for a while, but once I have a routine down, I will let you know when you can expect regular updates.
“Then that concludes our meeting, gentlemen. Unless you have any questions?” Draco shook his head, and Harry just stood up to leave. “Have a good night.” He watched as Harry left, silent and stoic. He noticed that Draco was also watching Harry, but with a very concerned look on his face. “Let him go, Draco.” Severus said, quietly.
curses. If this bothers you, I understand, but I ask that you remove yourself from the class by next week.”
He found himself wandering the dungeons, of all places. He never liked exploring down here before, it had been too cold. But now, it didn’t matter how cold something was – it couldn’t be colder than how he already felt. He took a certain solace in the dark, damp corridors. Much like his room in the eighth-year tower, the dungeons were lined with windowless, grey walls.
, all of its ingredients and why they work together to make this particular potion at this particular strength next Friday. Understood?” Snape asked in his harsh, mocking tone.
The owls flew in that evening, dropping the latest issue of the Prophet. Draco watched as, surprisingly, and owl dropped one of to Harry where he sat isolated at his own table in the corner of the Great Hall. Draco turned to his own paper as the noise level rose, figuring it was probably because of whatever was in the paper.
“I apologize for my tardiness, Professor Snape, Mister Malfoy. I also couldn’t help but overhear - and I am glad to see that the ending of the war has done good things to both of you. Of everyone, you two deserve the peace and freedom you’ve earned.”
“Sectumsempra.” Blaise said, since Draco was struggling with words. “Professor Weasley use Lord Potter-Black as a mannequin.” The house elf’s face turned dark and enraged.
But terrified because of the look in his eyes. He knew that look. Draco had the same eyes back in his sixth-year. Dull eyes, empty. Lost. Void of anything but despair because there was no hope.
“Oh, nothing. Neville Longbottom stopped me before I got to the greenhouses, said I am ‘too cold’ to go in, that I’d kill the plants. Which, is true. But – “
“I’m sorry to disappoint you Headmistress, but I managed to become and Animagus without your aide. Without even Sirius to guide me.” Draco winced at that last bit, somehow feeling that Harry had once wanted to become and Animagus to get closer to his godfather.
It turns out the rumor is true, but there is much, much more to this story than what meets the eye. First of all, it seems our ex-savior was ousted from Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat, who decreed the boy to be Houseless – worthless and unworthy to any of the houses.
. No more lives lost because of him. No more unhappiness left in his wake. He would be neither hero nor villain in death. Maybe, just maybe, for once… He would just be Harry.
He sighed and closed his eyes, burying and snuffing out the sadness like he had done many times before.
, as his master did not tell anyone. Did not correct anyone when they assumed he deflected the curse – just as he had done as a baby.
Draco and Harry were the last students that Snape had to meet with. Snape had assigned his meeting pairs – not wanting to deal with any potential tomfoolery between the students choosing their own partners and any antics it would result in during the actual meetings. Plus, there was the issue that was called Lord Harry Potter-Black. Not just anyone could be paired with him. Luckily, there was Draco. Who was oddly eager to be sitting with Potter-Black for their meeting… well maybe not so odd, now that Severus thought about it. Draco had always been obsessed with the black-haired boy, and his godson had confessed to him that he was gay this past summer. Severus would not dwell on Draco’s true motivations; his godson would come and explain himself eventually – he always did.
Snape had only managed to send Harry his Hogwarts Letter for this year because he saw Kreacher in Knockturn Alley buying potions (specifically Dreamless Sleep) and had asked the elf to deliver the letter. Even then, there had been no response as to whether or not he would attend, and no one knew he had return to Hogwarts until the Sorting Ceremony two days ago.
important thing, as was the acceptance or denial of it. Harry closed his eyes briefly, before opening them again and speaking parseltongue.
“What do you want from me, Professors?” Harry asked and opened his eyes. “It was not me screaming in the Great Hall. Nor did I fight back against Mr. Weasley. I am
?” She sneered. He looked at her, sadness attempting to strangle him as he realized that this was Hermione Granger. Brightest Witch of their Age. Hunter of Horcruxes. Part of the Golden Trio. Girlfriend to Ronald Weasley. His ex-best friend. He had confided in her, loved her like a sister. And here she was, berating him, accusing him, demeaning him. Where once he had found understanding, patience, and unconditional love, now stood loathing and disgust.
Just then, the door opened and Harry strode in – pale but tall, his hair pulled up into a messy bun and his robes billowing behind him. He turned to look at Professor Snape.
that Kreacher’s presence would upset Hermione – which combined with last night’s Prophet article – would most likely enrage Ron. I think you knew that and did it on purpose.” Harry remembered Lupin’s words from class.
It was Blaise who spoke first. “Of course, you great, insufferable prick! Of course, we will wear them.”
heir of Slytherin. But magic that belonged to Slytherin himself will not simply die, will not simply vanish from the world. No. It must go
“He kept reading and re-reading the instructions and ingredients list. And I saw a couple pages of notes about the potion and the steps to brew it. He took so long because he can’t read properly, Severus. Not because he doesn’t know how to brew. He follows the letters with his finger and has to sound out the words on his breath.” Draco explained. Severus sucked in a breath.
. Harry was searching, constantly, for a way to end it. For a way to wipe himself off the face of the earth and take all that dangerous, magical power with him.
“I think it has less to do with being dark, and more with the fact that the Patronus Charm requires happy thoughts and memories, and in order to feel those kinds of thoughts and memories, you need to be able to feel happiness.” Harry retorted as he met Lupin’s brown eyes with his own green voids, but the professor did not yield.
“Yessir,” Harry said before falling back into his seat. He quickly chugged the three potions and then picked at his food. He was well-aware of the eyes that were on him, from every direction. But he paid them no mind.
He saw Ron coming, face flushed red and angry, a snarl on his face. “You fucking bastard!” The red-head yelled before he swung the first punch. Harry didn’t defend himself, didn’t stand up from the table. He just… let it happen. If this is what they needed, they could take it.
“Of course, I sacrificed things. I sacrificed my seventh year at Hogwarts. I lived in a tent for nearly a year, scrounging the country for dangerous, dark artifacts. I risked my life. But when I compare my sacrifices to other people’s, they pale in the comparison. Such as you, sir – who literally spent your life being a double spy. You sacrificed your youth and prime for the war – think of all the missed opportunities. You lost the only person you loved. Mister Malfoy here had to
“Now, Miss Granger. How about you demonstrate for us instead?” Like the stuck-up, brown-nosing, teacher’s pet she was, Granger jumped at the change to show off in front of her peers.
Draco was… interesting. To say the least. He had decided to grow his hair out like Lucius, but then turned around and was extremely adamant that he was not – in any way, shape, or form – his father. Draco was simply Draco. The rest of the world would just have to accept it. Yet Draco, so fierce and so unapologetically

He thinks better of it, knows that the pounding in his chest is just nerves, that there's nothing to worry about here. But just because he knows these things logically doesn't mean that Harry can stop the way it's harder to breathe all of a sudden. He's not prepared but he knows what he wants to say, knows that it's nothing at all like Mark from
The night was cool, the cold air blowing in from Draco's open window and doing little to ease the heat spreading across his chest. He thought about Harry earlier that day, about how his messy hair had fallen over his face, how he'd smiled at Draco, the way he'd grinned at McLaggen, slow, self-satisfied. He thought of Harry's bare arms and the cords of muscles on his forearms, the way Harry had flexed when he offered his arm.
Draco did stop then, drawing himself to full height. "Are you going to deny the rumours about you and the Muggles in the countryside?" he asked.
"You always are," she said, reaching out to smooth the collar of his dress robes. "We always will be."
He knew that the longer he stayed with Draco in that bubble, the harder it would be to remember that they'd snuck away for a reason. He had to keep the conversation on track, to get it over and done with so that he could go out into the fresh air. He needed to feel the wind and have it wash away the heat he could feel emanating from Draco's body. It reminded him of how much he missed the feeling of someone beneath him, of the satisfaction of an intimate embrace. But it was neither the time nor the place, and Draco Malfoy wasn't a Muggle in some pub in the countryside.
The problem with owning Muggle technology and refusing to completely shut himself off from Muggle current events is that Draco spends a lot of his time at Harry's asking how everything works. Harry, in turn, spends a lot of the same time annoyed at the nonstop barrage of questions that make less sense the more Harry explains. The Internet is the biggest source of mystery and, therefore, what Draco asks about most often.
Harry stood there uneasy as the silence was drawn out longer than before. All he could hear was the sound of his own heart beating as well as the soft blowing of the breeze. He thought about knocking again but the Auror only took a deep breath. For some reason, his body felt tense as if he's waiting for something… or someone. His hands were tingling with nerves to a point where it was almost painful. He took another deep breath while clenching and unclenching his fists in an attempt to calm himself down.
"Fine," He said in a clipped tone. "Draco blew up his family home and disappeared. That's it. That's all we know for now."
Joseph and Julia both had shocked looks on their faces but they were sensible enough to take out their own wands and protect their patrons.
Draco heaved a sigh and ran a hand through his hair. The two of them sat in silence for a quite some time before the blond finally spoke.
"No," He replied, feeling the pendant of his necklace through his shirt. The small trinket usually brought him comfort but now it's just increasing the anxiety that he's feeling. "But he might discover the truth soon."
At this point, the fake sweet look disappeared from the waitress' face and she looked like she was about to use force on this man but before anyone can make a move, the bartender left his station and positioned himself beside his co-workers. He laid a hand on the drunk man's arm.
The warmth. It spread throughout his body like taking a warm bath after a cold winter's night. His body felt warm, his heart fluttered inside his chest. His mouth suddenly felt dry. There were so many emotions swirling inside him and he could only identify two, for now.
"That's good then! I'm fluent in French but I still find it quite taxing to speak." The woman said in a heavy Russian accent before going over to Adhil and handing him the paper bag that she was holding. "As I was about to say, I got you your favorite kosants! You're welcome!"
They're both blond and excellent at potions, as far as Harry could tell. They both have a regal and elegant air to them, an air that tells people that their every action is done with grace. That's basically where the similarities begin and end. He cannot contrast their personalities since Harry's idea of Draco is based on years of schoolboy rivalry and the antagonistic interaction that they seem to have every time they cross paths. Indeed, the former Slytherin had already redeemed himself in Harry's eyes – mostly due to the blond saving his life along with everything that he has done before disappearing – but he  still don't know Draco enough. He doesn't know him as well as, say, Pansy, Blaise or the rest of the Slytherins that have been on his side the longest.
"I think you'll need this, Harry. Tell Draco we said 'thanks' and that we're looking forward to having him over for brunch in the future." was all she said before she smiled at him cryptically.
Immediately, Parkinson rushed to where the voice was coming from with Harry, Ron, and Hermione trailing behind her. They arrived at the burned down West Wing of the Manor where the everlasting fire was. However, the said fire was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a small wooden box was left in its wake. Seeing as it hasn't been reduced to ashes like the rest of the house, the box is probably enchanted.
"Teddy's starting Hogwarts next year," Harry mentioned. "Everyone thinks that he's going to be Slytherin or even a Gryffindor but I think he's going to be a Hufflepuff."
"But, there would have to be another Vanishing Cabinet here for him to do that." Hermione countered.
As for the rest of you, patrolling shifts will continue to as to minimize the chances of anyone being taken while we try our best to locate the unsub. However, I must impose to each and everyone of you the dangers that this case proposes. Be on the lookout for anything, advise your fellow Aurors to be alert at all times and to protect each other's backs.
"What does she mean ancient? She's as radiant as the sun!" Draco argued, already opening the envelope. Aside from the folded parchment, it also held a photograph that the blond gave to Harry.
Did Harry get flustered at his little rant there? Perhaps. He [feels] flustered, his neck and cheeks a bit too warm for his liking. He quickly picked up his teacup and drank from it in an attempt to hide his fluster behind the porcelain cup.
"As you all know, we have been having difficulties with The Missing Wizards case due to lack of leads and evidence," The Head Auror immediately started after Harry took a seat. "However, just this morning, the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes was alerted to a mishap in a store in the outskirts of London. I'll let Obliviator Charles fill you in on the details."
"I don't fancy being around children for days upon end," Malfoy spoke matter-of-factly. "And I take personal insult that you compared my level of work to that of Lovegood's!"
"Why did you write me a letter?" The Auror asked, getting back into more serious topics. "Out of everyone you knew why me?"
"Why are you here?" Ron inquired, his tone only slightly accusing. Harry could see Parkinson roll her eyes as she gestured for the Aurors to leave the albino peacocks alone.
"I'll take them," She said before letting out a deep sigh. "Draco may be gone but he wouldn't want me to just leave them."
"It's kinda your thing, isn't it?" The Auror asked after Adhil explained the sixth group of potions that Harry pointed at.
"Weren't the contents of the letter enough, Potter?" He retorted. "I was feeling sentimental, grateful even. Extremely melancholic."
"Ron said," Angelina spoke as she finally took pity on Harry, letting him in on whatever secret that the Weasley brothers have. "That you have developed an itty-bitty crush on Malfoy. That's why you get all weird and flustered whenever he's mentioned."
"Uh, Healer Vartan is the head for the magical division of the program." Claudette started to say, her voice seeming far away and just confused. Harry thought that, if used the right way, the Confundus charm can definitely have the same effects as the Imperius curse. He filed that information away for future use. "They're usually in the Oncology Department. Fifth floor, west wing. Elevators are on the right."
"Harry's scared that Aunt Pansy will burn him into ashes if he's late, Gran!" Teddy joined in. Harry shrugged but his lips were curved into an amused smile.
"Huh," She said, putting down her quill and sitting back on her chair with her arms folded over her chest. She stared at Harry with a calculating gaze. A few moments passed and Harry was just about to ask her what the hell she was staring at when Parkinson shrugged and went back to looking over the pieces of parchment on her desk.
"Sir, there are nine missing Muggle cases in South Kensington alone, including Hubert Walters." Grunhild started, placing the case files on Harry's desk. The three of them were in Harry's office in the Investigation Department. Ron, on the other hand, went to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes to work on the magical signature device with George. He would just have to be briefed on the case later. "All of them males and of various ages, jobs, and social status."
Harry, Ron, George, and Angelina were now all in the Leaky Cauldron, having lunch together. It was just before noon so it wasn't as crowded as it usually was. Nevertheless, the group sat in a fairly isolated corner and cast a Muffliato charm when their orders were delivered. One would never know if there are any eavesdroppers hanging about, looking to sell any smidgen of information to the Prophet.
"Here." A familiar voice replied from the living room. He walked over to where the blond was and found him lounging on the sofa, going through their mail. A cup of tea and a plate of chocolate biscuits sat on the coffee table in front of him. Harry set his bags on the floor beside the sofar before walking over to his boyfriend and pressing a soft kiss on his temple. "How was the trip?"
But this right here, being in Draco's arms in their house in France despire being a thousand miles away from their family and friends, this actually feels like home.
If Draco noticed Harry's weird behavior, he didn't say anything about it. Instead, his focus was on the Masidec that's currently floating in front of him. Every so often, he would let out a soft hum either as if he's contemplating something or he's satisfied by that something.
A few days after the Missing Wizards case was closed, Harry could be found in a random Muggle pub in the middle of London. He just got off work and wanted to have a moment for himself. He was too exhausted from a day of signing paperworks to hang out with his friends. Besides, Ron was given a special assignment of refining the Masidec for official Ministry use. Not to mention that he's also spending every minute of his free time with Hermione which they both truly deserved after the excitement and business that these past months have brought.
"You got that right. Born and raised in New York." He said proudly, making his American accent more prominent.
symbol definitely has daffodils on it. The way that it was drawn was also similar to those on the wax seal and tag.
"Yes," He said so quietly, not willing to risk anyone hearing his words despite the square being relatively empty. "I am Draco… Malfoy. Draco Malfoy."
A few days after this discovery, another body part was found. This time it was at a Muggle café. William Proudfoot's right leg was transfigured into a microphone stand. The café's manager said that she got surprised when suddenly all of her guests started screaming in the middle of Poetry Night. One moment, the person on stage was holding onto the microphone stand and the next, the poor lad was confused as the mic detached from its place and his audience fell eerily silent. They looked down to see a man's severed leg on the ground where the mic stand should've been. Upon investigation, it seems like the spellwork on this one was abruptly disturbed seeing as it didn't have the time to rot and it just immediately went back to being flesh. The Forensics division of the Investigation Department was called in immediately. They concluded that the victims were still alive while their limbs were being ripped off from their sockets. This is because the flesh was still soft and warm with blood freely gushing out from the severed end.
He thought that Grimmauld Place was his home. Not really. It was just a place for him to stay that connected him to Sirius and thus, the rest of the Black family but it was now going to be a home for children who deserve to be loved. Not his.
"That's a very sweet gift," Hermione said. "But the fact remains that we didn't know how it got here. Did any of you feel the wards shift? Did it come via owl post? Did he come by via Floo?"
"I found you." He whispered, still entranced as his other hand came up to cup Draco's other cheek. "You're you…"
"Hello, Pansy Parkinson." Harry greeted back in an equally teasing tone. The two of them have become rather close friends through the years. At first, it was just because of Harry wanting to find Draco and thus turning to the latter's closest friend for information. However, with Pansy growing closer and closer to Luna, she has somehow integrated herself into their friendship circle. Harry has no complaints though. The former Slytherin is a fierce and loyal friend. She's a force to be reckoned with and will fight tooth-and-nail to get something she wants. Of course, being raised as a pureblood Slytherin, said fighting often involves negotations and a little bit of bribing and manipulation instead of actual brute force. Despite being their friend, Pansy never lets a day or social gathering pass without teasing each and everyone of what she dubbed as "The Gryffindor Bunch". For Harry, that means dramatically being called by his full name in the first twenty minutes of any of their gathering before Pansy goes on to call him "Henry".
Harry has his hands over the back of the couch and Draco's tucked into his side. They'd started on separate ends of the couch, with Draco declaring that he needed to stretch out. But after the first fifteen minutes of the movie, Draco had moved to the middle of the couch. Harry had pretended he hadn't noticed, and by the time they'd hit the thirty-minute mark, Draco had stopped pretending he wasn't looking for a cuddle.
He'd lay awake at night and think of Draco dressed in the latest fashions, how blue made him seem much paler than he was, how green suited him, how Harry had yet to see him look better than he did in black and gold. Even as they walked now, he couldn't help but focus on the heat of Draco at his side, how even though their skin didn't touch, Harry could feel the phantom press of Draco's arm against his.
Harry watches as Draco reaches up and tugs out a pair of earbuds. The sharp stab of disappointment is almost enough to mask Harry's surprise. He can hear the pop music blasting from the headphones and he winces in sympathy for Draco's ears.
He wasn't the same eighteen-year-old child who'd wandered the countryside because a dead man asked him to, because people said it was his destiny, his purpose. He was a grown man with needs and desires, a man who looked at Draco Malfoy and wanted him wholeheartedly and unashamedly. A grown man who didn't confuse things as he might have done when he was younger.
The article turned out to be exactly what Draco expected, speculations about whether or not he was good enough for Harry Potter, what he'd possibly done to lose a match like that. The article did everything but outright call him an idiot for arriving on his own to the Greengrass event. Gregory was mentioned as Draco's consolation prize in a single line at the end.
"Cormac McLaggen knows about what happened last night," Draco said. "Which means that soon enough all of Britain will know. And that means that before long, any chance I might have had at finding a good match will be gone. So you know what we have to do."
Draco hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting back to the group of women under the tree. Harry watched him make eye contact with Pansy and then he rolled his eyes and planted his back firmly to the group of women.
Without thinking, he tugged off the ring on his middle finger. He considered tossing it into the water and watching it sink beneath the bubbling fountain. He felt a sense of satisfaction just imagining it gone because, at least then, he'd have made a clear decision. Instead, he placed it on the marble, the moonlight reflecting off the stones. It was a beautiful piece of work, clearly expensive, so very proper for a promise ring because it meant the actual engagement ring would be far grander. It was a masterful expression of wealth, exactly the kind of thing Draco might have done if he'd had a choice in pursuing someone.
The face on the door dissolved, the shimmering see-through-black veil parting to let Harry through. The young Wizard who'd spoken to Harry earlier was the first to move, pushing his way past Cormac and Harry as he made his way to the Manor door. That seemed to jolt the others awake and before long the only two people left at the gate were Harry and Cormac. They eyed each other a moment, Cormac's eyes drifting up and down as he sized Harry up.
"Reputation?" Draco asked, the word jogging him out of his momentary haze. "What reputation might that be, Potter?"
Draco narrowed his eyes as Pansy fanned herself, the perfect picture of posed indifference. She knew Draco had read the pamphlet because everyone in their circle read Lady Red's rubbish. Even the help read it, which meant that everybody knew that Draco's name had been dragged through the mud that morning. His unfortunate past had been brought under scrutiny without a single mention of how his name had been cleared not long after the end of the War. There hadn't even been a mention of his family's new foundation, and perhaps it was true that his family's generosity was originally meant to drag their name out of the mud, but being cleared of all charges had come at a great financial cost. Their donations meant that although they could still afford the fees for Draco's coming out this season, they were no longer as comfortable as they had been pre-war.
The truth was that he'd have been wasting his time at any of the Zabini events before he and Harry had started their fake courtship. He'd known that the chances of him making a decent match had been low, and Blaise wasn't the type of friend to give anyone false hope. Which meant that if he was inviting Draco to events now, it meant that he thought Draco had a chance at making a good match.
Draco nodded, returning the bow. He expected Harry to go, so he wasn't prepared for the slight pressure on his wrist, the warmth of Harry's hand as he ran his fingers down Draco's palm, turning the movement into a handshake. When Harry finally walked out of the room with Narcissa, Draco realised that neither of them had been wearing gloves.
"Blaise Zabini," Draco said, dragging out the name as though he liked the sound of Zabini on his tongue.
He kept his eyes on the room, even though he could feel Harry's breath on the side of his face. "And what if everyone thinks I like Gregory?" he asked. "It's not like you've been here at all tonight. And it certainly wouldn't be my fault if someone else came and took me away from right under your nose."
He started pacing in the hall just past the entrance to Grimmauld Place. The house had been his godfather's and Harry used it on the rare occasions he'd snuck back to London. It was the last possession belonging to the Black family, aside from the stack of gold in Gringotts, and as Harry paced along the hallway, he started thinking of repairs, of the things he might need to do to make the place livable. It might be nice to be able to breathe life back into his godfather's last home because, despite the house's history, it was all Harry had left of Sirius.
It has to be worth a shot, Harry thinks as he heads back to the kitchen. Draco's still standing by the stove, stirring something Harry can't see. He takes a moment to enjoy the way Draco knows where to find what he's looking for, how he fits in Harry's kitchen, in his flat.
They still hadn't come up with a satisfying solution to the lack of staff in Azkaban. On top of that, the Department for the Control and Regulation of Magical Creatures had released a series of educational memos. The memos had been charmed to start yelling their contents if they weren't opened after three minutes. There had been a small quiz at the end that required three correct answers in order to get the blasted things to disappear. That had come after Harry had jokingly suggested they fill the water around Azkaban with Giant Squids.
They had him cornered but Harry had fought a war and survived. Surely, he could handle a couple of eager mother's wanting to marry off their sons and daughters.
They'd moved closer without noticing, enough that when Draco exhaled, Harry could have sworn he felt it.
The waitress wraps up the mousse cake and hands it to Harry so gently, he knows she's put Draco's piece in there.
He spared a glance for Cormac, but the man had never been kind towards Ron, so Harry didn't feel particularly charitable towards him.
Harry's starting to worry as he moves closer. "I can always rewrite it," he says. "I'm not married to 'chickpea.' There's really very little that's both light and rhymes with 'tea.' But it's only the first draft. Ginny laughed at me when I read it to her but what does she know? Draco?"
He didn't move away, even though they were almost touching. He stood his ground, his eyes cold and unimpressed.
He hadn't expected the way everything had fallen into place, how fast it had become second nature to have Draco in his home, in his life. To see him laughing with Hermione or discussing Ministry bureaucracy with Ron, both of them just a tad too gleeful as they discussed how best to hack away at the incompetency at the Ministry. To have Draco drinking tea from Harry's chipped teacups, putting on the kettle, waving his wand so the dishes washed themselves.
Harry handed her the bouquet and in a voice that carried throughout the sitting room, he said, "I saw them in the store and couldn't help but think they might be to your taste, after yesterday's ball."
Draco laughs, the sound carrying in the empty room. It's happy and carefree and it makes Harry want to kiss him.
"Yeah, well, it's not my fault you never taught me what fork to use for what course," Harry says. "I did wear the suit like you asked. I feel like that alone should've been enough."
The words felt heavy in his throat as he spoke them, the air catching in his chest painfully. He needed to get outside, to feel the cool night wind on his face. He didn't wait for Gregory's answer, choosing instead to focus on keeping his steps leisurely. He heard Elise Abbott's congratulations and he stopped only long enough to acknowledge them before continuing. At some point on his way out, he caught sight of Cormac, baring his teeth in a parody of a smile, barely suppressed fury underneath the expression.
Harry thanks her and heads out to the front where Draco's already picked up their cloaks. Outside, they get ambushed by a group of reporters who've been waiting for them to come out of the restaurant, and Draco takes Harry's arm a little too hard as they Apparate. As they're turning, Harry feels the little box slipping so he grabs it tighter, feels the cardboard give under his fingers. He spares a thought for the little mousse cake with its white powdered sugar spelling out, "I ♥ you."
Draco followed his line of sight to the crowd of curious spectators caging the two of them. Elise Abbott was watching them with her mouth hanging open as she stared between Harry and Draco. Towards the back, Draco could just make out Mrs Parkinson's cold calculating look as she eyed Draco. It wasn't just her though. As Draco looked from one mother's shrewd and jealous expression to another, an idea began to form. It cemented itself into the forefront of his mind, growing as he saw the curious looks from the men, some of them now openly admiring the long line of his neck. He stretched a tad and watched pleased as the eldest Parkinson cousin turned to get a better look at the golden chains around his throat.
They'd already done a lap of the lake in the centre of the park, in full view of all the other mothers and pairs enjoying the morning sun. It was a quiet, lovely day, with bright blue skies and the occasional cloud or two. If Draco were less annoyed, he might have enjoyed the way Elise Abbott couldn't stop staring at him. She practically had her mouth open as she watched Harry leading Draco around the park.
Draco stepped forward again, his hands finding the sides of Harry's face as he pulled him in close. "Marry me," he said in between kisses. "Marry me and I promise to work every day of my life to make you happy."
Harry eyed the small gathering in front of him and debated whether waiting was a better idea than trying to reason with Cormac McLaggen. In the end, he decided that it was more important that he maintain appearances. He pushed his way to the front, overly aware of how the looks directed his way turned from curious to assessing. He couldn't help the way he straightened his shoulders and lifted his head, unconsciously trying to make himself seem taller and more imposing. He had more right to be calling on Draco than all the men present and despite knowing that he wasn't truly courting Draco, he couldn't help the slight possessiveness that washed over him as he made his way past the men.
It was for the best, he told himself. It had never been Harry's intention to marry him, and Draco had made it clear from the beginning that he was looking for someone rich and pureblood. Someone who wouldn't have to learn how to navigate high society, someone who his mother might respect even if she never fully liked them. Draco hadn't even cared about heirs. His family history wasn't something he was proud of, and his family name carried with it centuries of faults and unnamable atrocities. It was never about children.
Percy, Charlie, Fred, and George were doing an equally good job of avoiding Mrs Weasley, gathering to talk and scattering when Mrs Weasley got near. Harry watched them too, wondering how it was that Mrs Weasley didn't lose hope as she failed again and again to round up her children. He'd asked Ron whether they shouldn't do something but, for once, Ron wasn't the target of Mrs Weasley's ire and he intended to keep it that way. Hence, the reason why Harry had spent the better part of an hour leaning next to the closest exit.
The light from their one lamp casts shadows on half of Draco's face and lends a heaviness to his words, something tangible, almost as though Harry can feel them down his back.
He wanted Harry, that much had been clear from the beginning. But more importantly, Draco wanted him more than he wanted this match with Gregory, more than he wanted the ring on his finger. He stood there and thought of Harry, of the way he'd looked in the Bulstrode ballroom, the hard set of his mouth, his jaw, the way he couldn't seem to stop looking at Draco. He imagined himself walking back into the ballroom, heedless of what anyone saw, imagined marching up to Harry and pulling their faces together. He imagined the scandal, the delicious heat of rules broken and wants fulfilled.
He's quiet for a moment, the silence in the flat a little more pointed. He doesn't mean for the moment to get awkward but there's nothing Harry can do about it. He's not going to confess to Draco that he doesn't know how to tell him he loves him. That would involve explaining why and Harry's done with looking back at things that he can't change.
Harry stopped to take a breath, the air rushing into his lungs and settling in the centre of his chest. He swallowed and found that it was difficult to do even that. But Draco's hand was still on his arm and his grey eyes watched Harry with no hint of judgement.
"We can't leave you waiting, now can we?" Harry had said, shaking his head when Draco had laid out the plan for how events would go.
"But why?" Draco said, his voice oddly calm. "I've heard you say you won't marry but you've never said why."
Parkinson Manor's high ceiling was alight with floating bulbs filled with bright white flames that looped together to form three large chandeliers. Between the intricate wall carvings framing the windows and entrances, sconces covered more bulbs, turning the whole room into one large overly bright spotlight. Everywhere Draco turned, the light bounced off long trailing necklaces and glittering diamond earrings, off exquisite tie pins and cufflinks. He blinked and the sparkle remained, so much openly displayed wealth on every witch and wizard in the room that he was starting to feel sick to his stomach.
The first thing Draco felt was relief, as though a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He could see Elise Abbott glaring at him from across the room and that was enough satisfaction. But Draco could also see his mother's obvious relaxation as she turned to the women around her with new fervour. It was that that made him angry. He remembered the looks he'd been getting all night, the snide comments he'd pretended to ignore about how he mustn't be as special as everybody seemed to think. It hadn't occurred to him before that moment that his mother might be going through the same things. But now it was obvious and so, when he spoke next, he couldn't quite keep his voice neutral.
He'd been in a much better mood after Blaise's visit, so much so that he decided to dress in his family colours for the Greengrass ball. He'd worn the chain that Gregory had given him without a thought to how that might appear, only remembering to take it off right before he walked into the Greengrass Manor. He wasn't meant to show favour to anyone aside from Harry yet. There was a delicate balance to these things, dances other suitors had to beg for, gifts they should impart. They had to fight for him to make it believable that Draco would give up a match with Harry Potter. Otherwise, Draco would come out looking like the idiot who let Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor get away, and Draco wasn't an idiot.
It had come to him later, when they were sitting on the living room sofa. It had occurred to Harry that there was a word for what he'd been feeling. For the way any news from Draco was enough to make Harry smile, how Draco's presence immediately brightened any room. How tedious meetings were worth it if Harry got to see Draco afterwards, how much fun it had been to drink tea and learn all the little intimate details of Draco's likes and dislikes. How fortunate Harry felt whenever Draco shared something new.
"Draco," Gregory said, coming to a stop in front of him. "I'm ever so sorry that I wasn't able to get away earlier. There was a minor incident in the kitchens."
Leaving the institute of Azkaban was both like a breath of fresh air, and like being crippled. His eyes tried to adjust to the light too quickly, and he squinted in the midday September sun. It was warmer out here, but he was still wet. Damp and miserable.
"Draco, I'll need to borrow you for a bit, just for a chat, so I'm afraid you'll have to wait till lunch to see your friends." Lupin said, moving round to the back of his desk and seating himself, gesturing for Draco to do the same. He let his bags drop to the floor and walked to one of the chairs in front of the desk. It was clean and comfortable, somewhat reminisce of a Victorian style of fashion.
"What like it's hard? He was in there for, like, two minutes." The other voice argued. Ah, that's who he was. The hands seemed to reach into his mind, to pull him into the present, pull him away from the void of ocean that swamped his thoughts. Draco Malfoy, that's who
"Well Draco, lunch is almost over, I have free periods all day and a bottle of expensive French whiskey, do you have any idea where I'm going with this?" She asked, flicking her hair in Blaise's direction just as he opened his mouth to speak.
And from that point, they had become practically inseparable. Their coffee date that they had planned had turned into a full on date, and in the darkness of Harry's London apartment at two in the morning, fuelled on bottles of wine, they had performed the thirty six questions.
"None of you were being so kind as to help him." The drawling accent was back, and it sounded fine. No tremor, no giveaway. Sam just smiled.
"Well, sort of. The dorms have had to be split up, so there are four people in each dorm." At Draco's sceptical, almost hostile look, he hastened to add to his statement. "Of course, you and Blaise are sharing, though."
"I'm in the bedroom, the doors are open." He called back, though it carried more in the tone of a murmur. She emerged seconds later wearing a new dress and still damp hair, albeit immaculate.
The entrance hall was a whole other beast, and in the end, he got Grey to clear it up whilst he configured a new sleeping arrangement that wasn't the other side of his own bed, as Grey had first suggested. Beds, he had told Grey in turn, are to be shared with those you value and trust. He had then promptly had a little bit of a panic because, well, what if Blaise and Pansy didn't like him any more? What if
"Yes. Just tap your wand a few times and away you go." He muttered sarcastically, loud enough so that they all could hear.
Sorry that I've been really busy this week, I honestly wasn't expecting it, which led to the late release of this!
"You remind me of Sirius." He said simply, a sad sort of smile on his face. "He'd always get like this when talking about his parents, too."
I'm really torn between quite a few fashion choices for Draco, and it shows in my indecision, and shall probably change throughout the fic. Right now in this chapter, it has elected to be dark academia, though I'm quite confident it's not wholly his style. He will be wearing everything from ‘hooker outfits’ to cable knit jumpers in these chapters, please forgive me.
The deal had been that Draco would get a month in Azkaban and that his mother would a week, but they would be at intervals. Draco would go first and as soon as he was out, his mother would go in. Something about keeping them apart for as long as possible, and making sure that the manor always had a keeper. Draco suspected his mother had bribed them off.
"Oh." He said. "Harry." She nodded, smiling in that slightly sad way. She took a small notebook from her pocket and ripped out a page and wrote down an address.
"Grey." He said imperiously, loud enough so that it might wake the kelpie. It worked. Grey blinked slowly  at Draco with his amber eyes, sleep blurring their angles.
"They never have anything else to gossip about." Blaise said, picking his left hand up from Pansy's head where it was playing lightly with her hair. "Fucking nightmare." Pansy nodded in quick agreement.
"Yes. I don't suppose you would remember Lucius Malfoy visiting Russia with Narcissa Malfoy around eleven years ago?" Lupin nodded. He did remember, it was quite a  big news story.
He laughed at the note before folding it and placing it on the bedside table. The first he unwrapped was in a small black box, an ornate silver ring with three emeralds studded down the long centre of it, swirling patterns coming to meet the sides. The second was a book, a French first edition of Crime and Punishment with old yellowing pages and green binding highlighted with gold lettering. The third was a large cased bottle of Louis XIII which he knew would be a lot of fun to drink on cold December evenings out by the lake whilst lying on top of Blaise with Pansy's head in his lap. The fourth was a bottle of what he knew to be very expensive French perfume. Clive Christian, Blaise had done his homework. The last was a long, silk, deep emerald robe that felt more like a liquid under his hands than anything else.
"I'm sorry, I don't quite follow." He ground out, willing himself not to snap at the next person to walk in.
"If you're sure, darling." She said gently. "I'll be around. How about the Ritz for afternoon tea?" She asked. His shoulders drooped.
"Grey." he tried to sound curt and imperious, but instead he choked n the word and had to grab the side of the bath to support himself while he hacked. He wasn't even sure when he had sat up. A searing arm touched his shoulder, pulled him gently upright. Grey was studying him. It wasn't quite affection, Draco realised, but idealised longing. Kelpies were lone wolves, for wont of a better phrase, but some had just been alone for too long. Grey didn't want him to die not out of affection or a grip on censored morals, but because he could use Draco as a sort of support system, use him as a pack bond. Draco couldn't even find himself disliking the notion. He leant into the touch, bowing his head. Droplets landed thickly on the marble base.
Draco floated in the lake for a while, a formless shadow amidst the ripples of the tide. His eyes were open but glassy and unseeing, and rain continued to soak his attire and skin. That was how Grey found him, floating and cold, bleeding and broken.
Grey's muzzle was warm and matted under his long fingers, and Draco could feel the warm puffs of breath down his arms. There was muttering behind him, scandalised yelling, but all he could allow himself to focus on was Grey. He would prove his worth yet. Sam started laughing behind him.
When Narcissa did arrive, it was a solemn affair for Grey who had mostly enjoyed his interactions with another living being, especially one whom had risked a lot to save him, and grumbled a lot that he was being shunned by Draco. This was of course met with Draco's hostile indifference and a scathing glare. Grey did not speak out again.
"Would you mind fetching me my wand? Only, I think I've broken my arm and I would really rather not have to deal with it in the muggle way." His speech patterns were long and drawling, as they had always been, and it reminded him painfully of Sunday mornings spent in the secret astronomy room tower with Harry, talking about both everything and nothing.
"I hope you realise these are my favourite French products." Draco said whilst moving onto his face. Grey made a non-committal sound of gentle pleasure and enjoyment as the grime was removed by warm water and soft hands that feathered over his face.
"Is this about my proper use of magic and attitude towards other students and teachers?" He asked, lacing his fingers together above his knees. Lupin gave him a half grin.
"About your personal life, Draco. I'm a bit worried about you." Draco finally turned to glare at Lupin unhappily. "We could use a pensive, if it's easier that way." It sounded as though it was supposed to be reassuring, but it did anything but to Draco. Lupin clearly saw his mistake and hastened to correct himself. "Of course we won't use one, that's only if you really wanted too!" He said, reaching across the table to take one of Draco's skeletal hands in his own. "We can go at whatever pace you feel is right, we'll be doing this for a while, after all." Draco didn't like that wording.
"You have beautiful eyes" He remembered Harry telling him, so many times, over and over, but this time they were lying on the floor amongst wine bottles and glasses. His pupils were so dilated now that he could barely see the colour, just a ring of grey against a sea of black.
Half of the entrance hall now seemed to be wet, the storm outside blowing in and swirling through the manor in an sharp whistle. There was blood on the stairs and at the bottom of them. Grey didn't know what to do.
Nikolai's mother, his real mother, had unfortunately passed away during childbirth, essentially orphaning and his half brother, Damien. For six years he had prospered in Russia, living with those other souls in the brothel.
He packed quickly, quietly and thoroughly. It made his insides bitter as he thought of Draco teaching him how to pack correctly, chastising him and laughing. He packed only what he needed, what he would miss, and took whatever personal touches he could.
"Narcissa?" Lupin asked, delicately avoiding the question of 'how much are you worth on the black market?'. Draco snorted.
There were more people screaming now. They were screaming because they were being tortured, and he was doing nothing about it. They were dying, and he allowed it. They even died at his own hands, knives through their throats, untraceable. Untraceable because it stained him.
"Can I kiss you?" Harry asked. Polite society and the revels that came with it, the joyous red and silver.
"His fucking eyes are open but he doesn't see us!" The voice he didn't like said, panicked and freaking out.
The Slytherins were all waiting in the common room when Snape and the eighth-years entered. They all gaped when Harry stepped in after them. Snape quelled all questions with a
They started with the youngest first years in the morning, working their way up to the eighth-years in the evening. Snape was, as usual, methodical and precise with his students. But he also made sure they all knew he was there to guide and protect them, and that they could always turn to him for advice or assistance.
Kreacher knew that Harry had a rough night – now that the Dreamless Sleep potions were no longer working. It seems that over a year of abuse of the potion had finally caught up with his master. Regardless, Kreacher dutifully checked in on Harry through out the night, making sure that the wards on his room were perfect.
“Well done, Draco. Fifteen points to Slytherin for brewing the correct potion. Another fifteen for being the first one done.” Draco grinned.
“Thank you.” Draco said softly. “Do you mind if I nap here until my next class? DADA was harder than I expected, and I would like to be able to concentrate for Arithmancy.” Snape nodded, and Draco smiled before stretching out on the couch – quickly falling into a light slumber.
Harry felt like puking, or falling asleep for eternity. Perhaps both. It was pure will-power that kept him upright on his feet and kept his breakfast in his belly. He had one hand on the wall as he stumbled towards the hospital wing, steadying himself against the castle walls. He noted that each stone thrummed with ancient magic, but it all tried to run away from his touch – leaving him with an acute sense of abandonment and isolation he had never felt during his previous stays within Hogwarts. He stopped to close his eyes and sigh.
“Thank you for your benevolence.” She recited the formal words required to prevent any magical backlash against her for the insult to Harry. “I must ask, though. Why did you reply in parseltongue first?” Harry’s eyes flashed with something akin to wickedness, and the corner of his mouth tilted ever so slightly into a smirk.
“Temperature difference. You run too cold and it affects the area around you. You’ll kill the plants.” Neville explained, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes.
could kill him now, I reckon.” Draco mumbled. “And with his magic… I wonder if it will let him do it himself. I wonder if he has already tried.” Severus grimaced. He hadn’t wanted to think about Lily’s son trying to kill himself, but now the images wouldn’t stop.
“No, I won’t make you say it out loud.” He confirmed. “But I though Professor Sprout was above rumors, above judging students based on what others said of them. It appears that I was wrong.” Neville grimaced, and took a step back. As if he
Harry had left the Great Hall as soon as he saw the title on the front page of the paper. Of course, it was Rita Skeeter. And as he skimmed the article, he sighed. Closing his eyes once more as his heart threatened to pull him under with pain. He shoved the feeling down, until he felt the safe, welcoming emptiness that ate at his soul. Kreacher popped into the room, carrying a small tray of food.
He watched as Harry sighed his way through the castle, stopping to close his eyes and recollect himself when
Draco though, and knew he wasn’t wrong when he saw the greedy glint in the Headmistress’ eyes – especially when looking at Hermione. Unlike Lupin, Minerva did not glare at Harry. She simply passed over him as if he did not exist. Draco wished the world would stop doing that, yoyo-ing between insane idolization, complete loathing, and indifference when it came to Harry.
“No, Kreacher. Thank you. I will call for you if I think of anything.” The elf bowed and then popped out of existence again. Harry picked at his food as he read the article more thoroughly this time.
From third year and above, the professors met their students in pairs. It would have taken too long to meet them all individually, but more than two would have meant that each student would not receive the individual consideration they deserved. Additionally, the pairs helped those students who may be shyer speak up about themselves due to the comfort a classmate, and friend, could provide.
And now they didn’t work at all, and Harry hadn’t been in Hogwarts for even a week. So Kreacher did what he could. He made sure his master ate and bathed. Made sure he had potions for his nausea and pain. He couldn’t prevent the coldness that seeped into Harry’s bones, nor could he prevent the magical outbursts. He could not shield his master’s heart from the emotions that would cause him to lose control.
“Potter-Black – “ Snape stood, trying to stop the young wizard, but Harry had already left – disappearing into the dungeons. “He moved
“Paleness of the skin, shakiness, a feeling of unending cold, weakness of the limbs, nausea, dizziness, and loss of appetite.”
“I apologize for the lack of coffee, but the tea is my own blend. Quite strong, if I do say so myself.” Severus set the tray down, pouring them both a cup before sitting in the chair across from Harry. “So, what
Suddenly, silence overtook the noise as a man slowly walked down the aisle. Students shivered as he walked by, the air around him was noticeably colder. Draco eyed him, suddenly realizing that the man walking down the aisle was the same mysterious man who he had shared a compartment and carriage with. He looked at Blaise, the other boy was also flabbergasted. The man wore stiff, black robes – rivaling Severus Snape’s severe wardrobe. His hair was let down, allowing the long, black, shaggy locks to fall as they pleased down his back and around his face. A look at McGonagall told Draco all he needed to know about the face of the mysterious man. She was in shock, rendered speechless. As was the rest of the head table. Even Severus was in a state of surprise. The man turned to sit on the stool, under the hat, and the hall made a collective gasp.
, even in the name of education and teaching how to counter it.” Draco argued, not seeing Harry – who was learning back in his chair, his face resigned and eyes closed as if forcing away a horrible memory.
“I do not have to explain myself to you, or to anyone else. Not anymore.” He stated loudly enough for the whole hall to hear him. He heard Ron shouting something from Gryffindor table, heard as a bench screeched with someone pushing on it roughly, heard as Ginny cried, as heavy footsteps came running at him.
.” Hermione called, her voice venom. “You are down at the bottom. Enjoy.” Harry didn’t acknowledge her, but he climbed down three flights of stairs, noting a set of bathrooms on the floor below the common room. But at the bottom, there was only one door. A menacing black door with his last name
“Lets just get on with it.” And they did. The Gryffindors took turns cursing him, while the Slytherins healed him. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs who had initially stayed had slipped out of the classroom – unable to continue in such a blood-soaked and vicious environment. Harry never once fell completely to the floor – only to his knees. But his eyes were glassed over, as if he wasn’t really there anymore.
Malfoy stared at Harry, not quite sure what to say. Since when did Harry become... This?  He tried to analyze the dark-haired man. Trying (and failing) to not get distracted by how his long, wet hair fell down his back, or how Harry's robe barely hid away the Adonis body beneath – Harry certainly wasn’t small and scrawny anymore, even if he was still the shorter one of them both. But he did manage to look into Harry's eyes, and he found those emeralds held nothing but empty voids. No light, but no darkness. Just... Nothing. And this scared Draco, because Draco knew those eyes.
reason.” She said tartly. “But please refrain from fighting in the future.” Her words were scalding as she turned away from him, probably going to follow wherever they took Ron.
“You always were invested in your house – despite outward appearances.” Draco teased. “But I am happy to see you being more open with your intentions and feelings.”
“Ron,” he called. “You first.” Ron rolled his shoulders back and cracked his neck as he stood, wand already drawn. He swiftly came to stands a few paces away from his ex-best-friend.
Kreacher was at his bedside, adeptly dodging wayward magic and flying limbs. “I’m sorry Master Harry, I’m sorry. But the dreamless sleep isn’t working very well anymore.” Harry clenched his teeth and turned to the house-elf, finally quieting his own screams even though his body still spasmed with magic and pain. The room was growing icy, frost seeping in through the wall.
“What do you mean it doesn’t matter?!” Draco yelled. “This isn’t a cock-measuring contest, this is life. It was
Harry cast the Lumos spell, and his phoenix-feathered wand (repaired by the Elder Wand before Harry destroyed it), disintegrated into ash. His master didn’t cry that night. He laughed. A cold, bitter laugh.
Draco saw Minerva whispering with Mrs. Teak, probably encouraging her to leave if she wanted to, but the woman stayed. The Headmistress cleared her throat. “Now, if any of you are Animagi already, or think you might be close, please speak up now.” Draco turned to look at Harry, waiting with baited breath. He was not disappointed. Harry stood and cleared his throat.
“Thank you, Kreacher. But you best get out of here before she gets her claws into you.” Kreacher bowed.
to drag his name through the mud?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “He has family in this room, a cousin and a godson, and I would advise you not to forget that.”
