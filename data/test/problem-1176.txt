“Harry.”  She’d aged a little, since the last time he’d seen her, but her eyes were as bright and shrewd as ever. He put his arms around her and squeezed gently.  She was a little frailer, but her hug was as tight as ever.  “You’re a sight for sore eyes, lad.  You’re keeping well?”
the homework she assigned, and often found himself, sweaty and trembling, standing on his front step, trying desperately to muster the courage to apparate somewhere.  He’d found it strange at first that she’d sent him off to strictly Muggle destinations, but soon realized that the anonymity of the Muggle world allowed him to become more comfortable with exposure to the danger therein  After all, none of the Muggles were watching him fall apart, trying to enter a Library.
“No!  No, it wasn’t like that.  Your Dad was hope, and joy, and my heart.  In fact, on the day that Harry and I separated, I went to Azkaban, resolved to tell my Father that I was making different choices.  I knew that he would likely disinherit me, but I was resolved to choose Harry.”
Mrs. Sanders led Harry up a staircase. As they neared the top of it, she bolted ahead, and as he followed, Harry heard the scrape of furniture moving, followed by a door opening.  He gave her a pointed look before glancing at the heavy chair that she’d clearly been using to block the door closed.  Her face flushed.
Suddenly aware of a presence at his side, he looked down to see Cass, standing quietly.  “Hello, little duck,” he said.  “Do you need something?”
As he went downstairs, he found the sitting room empty, and no sign of Harry.  So that was it, Draco realized.  It was over.  Harry had obtained whatever sort of closure that he needed, and it was time for Draco to focus on the real reason he was here.
Harry’s laughter quickly subsided as he realized that he’d unintentionally insulted Draco.  “Baby, I’m sorry,” he said quickly, still a little breathless.  “Draco?”
“Oh.”  I don’t know how to feel about all of this, but my mind does note a salient point.  That Draco doesn’t have a wife, that he is gay, and that he hadn’t lied, so much as chosen not to share personal information with me. “I’m sorry, then.  I overreacted.”
“He thought that he might be.  We never discussed it again, and then when he and Ginny reconciled after V-Voldemort died, I figured he was just confused, and that he’d decided that he was straight after all.  But he changed so much, Draco.  When we were camping, he told me that the idea of being intimate with Ginny was repulsive to him.  He couldn’t imagine sex with any woman, but Ginny specifically…he thought of her like a younger sister.”
An absolutely adorable blonde boy was peering up at Harry with unmistakable interest.  “Are you Harry Potter?”
I decide that simply honesty is what’s called for here.  “Draco,” I say, and he looks up again, reacting to something in my tone.  Good.  “Draco, I’ve been cursed.”  He visibly brightens at this, and I can’t help the grin that leaps to my face.  Pointy little git.
Malfoy doing here, Draco wondered frantically, now fully terrified that he wouldn’t be going home alive tonight.  He’d made a desperate fuck up of his life, true, but Draco really
“Harry is a lovely boy.  He is exceedingly loyal, and is incapable of hurting someone’s feelings.  It’s obvious that he wouldn’t feel comfortable telling you that your…friendship isn’t anything serious.”
“What if one of us had a child with someone else?” Astoria’s voice was impassive.  “It takes each of us to provide the faulty genetic factors, correct?”
Opening the box, Draco unwrapped a small vial.  Inside was a liquid of the most beautiful iridescent green.  Fleetingly, Draco thought of Harry’s eyes, then unfolded the note.
Draco, on the other hand, looks dreadful, as though the cost of getting his son back requires him to sacrifice an arm, or the ability to speak.  There’s a fire in his eyes, though, and I know in my bones that there’s no price too great.
I’m not sure how long I sit, my mind blank.  True, I don’t remember any of the shared history that Hermione and I have, but she and Ron are the link to my past.  The only link, it seems.  I don’t regret my harsh words, but I wish she hadn’t been hurt.  It’s frustrating, though, being treated as though I’m witless because I don’t remember what’s happened before.  Well, it seems that I’ve experience with going it alone.  None of the day’s activities are making my imaginary cabin in the woods sound less appealing.
“I know, this must be scary,” Draco soothed.  A rocking chair that he hadn’t previously noticed, creaked a little, and Draco sank into it, Harry tight against his chest.  Rocking slowly, Draco sang the song his mother had comforted him with as a child.  “Sleep, my dear one, dry your tears, unicorns and fairies take away your fears.  Fly with the dragons, through the peaceful night, I will be here with you, 'til the morning light.”  The singing seemed to calm Harry, his tears eventually tapering off.
Draco’s legendary poise has returned, and a grimace that nearly passes for a smile crosses his face.  “You’re unlikely to be any help at all with planning a Pureblood funeral,” he says wryly.
“Yes.  I told him that I thought we must be.  Because I’m here staying with him.  I’m going to try really hard though.  I’ll be an even better friend this time, Draco’s mum.”
He looks surprised, and then grins.  It transforms his face completely, and my insides give an interested little lurch.  “No, Potter, not a complete idiot.  Just…less inclined to think things through, although I suppose if I were chased by a madman for my formative years, I’d probably see the benefits of quick reactions.”
“Well, how do you expect me to figure this out?  I can’t very well do research and babysit at the same time.”
“I knew that our only hope for salvation was to rid our society of those who were Dark-aligned.  I knew that the Department of Mysteries had a solid research strategy.  I knew that those who were members of Slytherin House during the War, and those affiliated with them, were being addressed.”
“Merry Christmas.  I assume you’re here to see one of my lot.  Please, come in!”  Given the noise level from within, Draco was a little overwhelmed by the idea of entering, but he didn't fancy dragging this armload all the way back to London, so he stepped through the doorway, and followed Mrs. Weasley to a large parlour that seemed to be teeming with people.
Draco felt as though an enormous weight had been lifted from his shoulders.  Tears swam in his eyes for a moment before he blinked them away, and said, “Hermione, thank you.  Truly.  I owe you a great debt.”
She gives me a bit of a superior look, but underneath it, I can see the fire of a warrior who protects those who can’t protect themselves.  “No, Harry.  It doesn’t work that way.”
As he examined her carefully, Harry seemed entranced by the woman.  His hands came up to touch her face, but he hesitated at the last second, and ultimately allowed only a single finger to touch the side of her lips.  “Wow,” Harry breathed, allowing his finger to gently explore Narcissa’s cheek, but returned to her full red lips.  Narcissa laughed, and pretended to bite the chubby digit, prompting a chuckle from Harry.  He looked at Draco, his forehead crinkling, and then back at Narcissa.  “Mama?” His voice was uncertain, and his eyes swept back to Draco’s for confirmation.
“The house is sleeping?”  Kreacher had told me about this, how Wizarding houses were almost sentient, and they sometimes intercede when the residents misbehave.  “Isn’t it going to like me?”
I shrug.  “Hardly seems worth the trouble, really.  I was closeted, in a job I hated, and spent most of my time trying to please other people.”
“Pretty fucking spectacular,” Draco supplied.  Harry was laying boneless and sated, but mustered up the energy to life his head and kiss Draco deeply.
“I don’t think so,” Draco said.  “The half-life of the Imperius vaccination is about two weeks, and we’re past that now.”
There was no razor, and he didn’t have his wand, so he left his facial hair as it was.  As he left the bathroom, he saw that Miriam was sitting at a table in the corner, and she smiled widely and gestured him to sit down.  She was a tiny woman, Harry guessed that she was in her fifties, and her eyes were very kind.  She made Harry feel protected right away, kind of the way that Minerva made him feel.
“No,” Harry said patiently.  “I mean, I have magical friends for Scorpius.  I have a six-year old, and a nine year old, and a four-year-old and a three-year-old, just off the top of my head.  And, actually, I have another one, a little girl, who is about Scorpius’ age.”
“Up, Gryffindor,” Pansy ordered.  “Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  You’re a nightmare, and you react with your heart far more often than your head.”
Draco leaned under the table.  He found Harry huddled in a tight ball, hands clapped over his head, rocking back and forth.  “Bad Harry, Freak Harry,” he muttered.
Ron laughs.  “Yes, numbnuts, they want you to be Godfather, so I assume your absence would be noted.”
“No, they don’t.  I guess I’m tired of apologizing for how I am.  I had the most evil man I’ve ever met living in my head for my childhood, using every emotion I had against me.  It isn’t so simple for me to change how I am, just for them to accept me.  I love my friends, and I miss everyone when I’m away, but I’ve been alone before.”
“Well obviously he doesn’t want to hurt you Draconus.  But you can’t give him the family he’s always longed for.  Surely you see that you don’t belong?”
The Ministry is deserted at this time of night.  The night watchman stands as though he’s going to question us, but catches sight of Hermione, and nods acknowledgement.  The lift takes us to level nine, and Hermione exits through the doors the moment they open.  By the time we’ve all filed out, she’s sprinting down the halls.  Draco hauls arse after her, and the three of us pursue.  Ron looks decidedly uncomfortable as we approach a black door at the end of the hall, but at my questioning shrug, he just grimaces, and follows Draco and Hermione.  It’s even creepier as we reach a circular room with twelve doors.  Hermione narrows her eyes and confidently hauls one of them open.  We follow her inside, and Ron finally pipes up.  “What room is this one, ‘Mione?”
“I know that you’re busy, Hermione, and I won’t keep you long.  I was just hoping that I could draw your attention to Scorpius’ application to participate in a Muggle clinical trial.  His Healer tells us that all such things need to be approved by this Department.”  He passed a file folder across the desk, and Hermione flipped it open.  She scanned the contents quickly, and bit her lip as she read.
“When I stumbled from the visitor’s lounge, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I wanted to curl up and cry.  I couldn’t return to Harry, not after I’d given up on him to obey my Father.  I returned to the Manor, wrote him a note.  I told myself that Harry had been too good for me anyway, that he deserved better than someone like me.  I reminded myself that family was everything for a Malfoy.  It took me nearly two full days to return to Harry.  I stepped out of the floo, and he was there, looking so beautiful, and so hopeful.”
“Yeah,” I agree, taking a sip from my glass.  “Oh, that wine is nice.  I seem to have misplaced a large portion of my memory.”
Eight days later, the silence was interrupted by the arrival of a tiny owl, who twittered and chirped at Draco as he struggled to stay aloft.  He had a scroll tied to his leg, and the tiny owl could barely stay still as Draco untied it.  “There now, you daft thing,” he said, and the owl gave a joyful hoot in response.
“Anything else?  Something experimental?” Draco said.  He knew he was begging, but he didn’t care.  He would crawl on his hands and knees across broken glass if it gave Scorpius a chance.
The next morning, the sun assaults them through the big window and Harry feels like he’s been trampled by Hippogriffs.  “My mouth tastes like owl shit,” he whispers to Hermione.
“Can I see?” Harry asked quietly. His heart had started to pound, and he felt a bead of sweat trickle down his spine.  When Cass nodded, he gently probed the joint, and watched her face.  It was impassive, not a single muscle twitched, but Cass’ eyes had always been her tell.  As he maneuvered the ankle, a tiny dilation of the pupil told him where the problem was.  “Just a sprain, little duck.”  A wave of his wand had the problem repaired, and Cass bounced to her feet, all business.
For a moment, they stood there, each examining the other.  Harry sighed softly in Draco’s arms and nestled closer.  Narcissa seemed to see something in Draco’s expression, and she stood.  “I’m sorry,” she said again.  “I’ll go.  Please forgive me.”  As she walked towards the floo, her always-elegant posture seemed to droop.
“I just mean, I don’t know you right now, and maybe it will help me to remember if you tell me about our relationship.”
“Draco, I don’t think that’s true.  He might initially react badly, but I’m sure that he’ll come around.  Although,” she said ruefully, “maybe not until after he’s sixteen.  He was pretty angsty that year.”
He nods.  “I need…I don’t know what I need, but I don’t think it’s here.”  He looks so terribly sad, and so heartbreakingly young.
He doesn’t believe me, but something Ron said earlier makes me suspect I have rather a lot of gold around here somewhere, so he opts not to investigate whether I even have an appointment, and supplies, grudgingly, that Malfoy is a cursebreaker.  Excellent, I can absolutely work with this.
“Three days,” Draco says, and his voice is a broken thing, as rough as shards of crystal.  “They left a note, telling me not to tell anyone, and said they’d be in touch, but there’s been nothing.”
“I do.  And so do you.  But we’re going to name things, together, you and I.  We’re going to face them directly.  What’s Cass’ last memory of you?”
“Now that we’re both getting our breaths properly, I want to make sure of a couple of things.  First of all, does any part of you hurt?  Your chest, your head?”
Draco started, and looked closely at her.  Her face was impassive.  “I don’t know what you mean,” he said, his voice stiff and stilted.
“Huh?”  Draco knew that he was being inarticulate, but his confusion outweighed any of the long-ingrained Malfoy manners at the moment.
“That’s nice,” Hermione said evenly.  “I certainly hope that he’s being treated fairly, in his dealings with magical bureaucracy.”  She cast him a warning look.
Harry was…different now.  He was much quieter, except when he wasn’t, and those infrequent occasions were marked by Harry’s frantic attempts to impart as much information as possible.  His easy, effortless relationship with Cass was different as well, and Draco mourned that as much as he mourned the Harry who used to look at the world with bright, trusting eyes.  Cass, bless her, didn’t know how to relate to her Dad anymore.  Where he was once the sun in her sky, he was relegated to a lesser celestial body now, and she was wary of him.
, Draco thought to himself, and the thought was so jarring that he hastily found himself a corner to retreat into, and breathed slowly until he’d gotten himself under control.
“At some point, Draco, you need to trust yourself.  I don’t for a moment believe that you harbour inappropriate sexual feelings for the five-year-old child in your care.  All of my reservations about you caring for him have been the impact that it would have on your recovery.  His safety has never, in my opinion, been at risk.  Let me put it to you this way…Have you ever wanted to hex Harry?  Either in school or since then?”
“Desire’s a funny thing,” Draco mused.  “Of course I’d love to see him again, but it isn’t likely to happen, and I seem to have stopped pining for things I can’t have.”
“It’s also possible that she’ll end up the youngest Minister for Magic in history, truly it could go either way, with that one.”
Hermione and Ron weren’t able to come for the next dose of potion, and so it was Draco and Harry, alone in Draco’s lab.  “I can’t wait to see how big I get,” Harry said shyly.  He’d been getting a little braver each day, had stopped cringing as though Draco would hit him.  Yesterday, he’d looked as though he was about to take Draco’s hand, but he pulled away at the last minute, leaving Draco simultaneously relieved and a bit disappointed.  He’d had to clean the kitchen for a few hours after that.
Instead, he gave Harry a searching look, and said “We can go get a beer, or we can go to my place.  You choose.”  He knew he was giving Harry nothing, but the rules had all changed, and Draco didn’t know how to do this.  He’d been so good.  He’d been so adult, and he’d let Harry do what he needed to do, and he’d sucked up the fact that he’d made a terrible mistake, and things had been so hard.  He wasn’t a saint, and he couldn’t give Harry another inch.
And here's the epilogue.  Thanks bunches to everyone who's read and commented, and enjoyed.  I've got a bunch of works in progress that I hope to finish soon, so it shouldn't be too long before I'm posting another story.  Stay safe everyone!
this is hard on you.  But it’s hard for me too.” His voice cracks then, and Draco knows he’s crying.  He continues in a whisper.  “I think about you every second of every day.  I dream about you all night.  I feel like a part of me has been ripped away and I fucking ache from it all the fucking
Harry shrunk Scorpius’ robes for him, and placed them in his pocket, prompting a “Thanks, Dad,” before he raced off to say one last goodbye to his mates.  Harry and Cass chattered a mile a minute, trying to catch one another up on everything that had happened in the three days since they’d last exchanged owls.  Draco looked on, not feeling the need to engage in the conversation.  Sometimes, he just liked to watch.
“Ginny,” I say, and I can’t imagine how she must be feeling.  She’s, objectively speaking, beautiful, and this must be a nightmare for her self-esteem.  “That doesn’t seem fair to anyone.”
“Oh.  No, no.  Draco, you’re her father.  I’m not going to tell you how to parent her.  I know that the two of you will figure it out.”
“It’s going to take me a few more years, but eventually, they’ll all be dead or in Azkaban.  I just need to make sure that I stop the cycle of new children being born.  They’re like rats, you know, these Death Eaters, they procreate quickly.  To continue their filthy bloodlines.”
“Mister Potter.”  I turn to see Narcissa, who stands, a bit unsure, in the doorway.  “Would you object to some company?”
His Mother’s banker and lawyer were there as well.  Draco thanked them for coming, made an appointment to sort out her estate the following morning, and then moved on to Harry and his friends.  “Thank you all for coming,” he said quietly.  “It means a great deal.”
“Mister Potter, we cannot allow any outbursts from witnesses or the public-” Madam Marchbank begins, but I pay her no mind.
As they listened, something further unclenched within Harry, and he had found, for the first time in years, tears pricking at his eyes.  “It’s okay, Harry,” Luna had whispered.  “You can let go.”
Draco was coaxing Scorpius to eat just one more bite when he heard the floo, followed by Cass’ excited voice say, “Maybe we can go and see the Weasley shop?”
“Good,” I say.  “It’s strange, but I’m healthy.  Just confused, but I remember how to get to the ice cream place, so all the important stuff is still there.”
“I know I’m bossy, Harry.  I’ve always been that way.  But I care so much about you, and I’d feel so guilty if I didn’t make sure you understood things before you made a decision.”
Narcissa suddenly looked incredibly sad, and Harry’s forehead wrinkled in concern.  “Don’t you think I understand a little bit about doing a very wrong thing because you feel you have no other options?”
“What?  That someone would choose my Dad?” Her voice was challenging, and Draco realized he needed to tread carefully.
“Thanks,” Harry said, placing a kiss on the top of her head.  “Do you think we should go and reassure Severus and Minerva that neither of us is going to expire in misery?”
“Well, no,” Harry allowed.  He thought for a moment, examining his hands.  “I have magical friends,” he said suddenly.
“Is the butter in Butterbeer made from magical cows?” Harry suddenly asked, his voice unnaturally loud, and jolting Draco from his doze.
“Yeah,” he grunts, not letting up his pace.  “Come for me.”  I’m helpless to disobey, and thick jets of my spend coat his hand, and the covers below me.  I can feel my arsehole tightening around him, and he groans before I feel wet warmth, and it’s fucking blissful, and I may have found what I want to do with my life after all.  Fuck being an Auror, I’m just going to fuck Draco, and sleep, and wake up and fuck him again.  He is
“Well, my cousin Dudley usually beats people up when they’re nice to me.  I don’t think he can hurt you, but I don’t want to take the chance.”
“No!” Draco doesn’t mean to shout, but he’s desperate, frantic.  “You can’t do this.  You can’t let me worry like this.  If you’ve ever cared about me at all, Harry, please.  Please don’t leave me to wonder for the rest of my life.”
Draco’s face was unreadable, but he said, “Potter,” before Scorpius came tearing into the room, and ended the conversation.
“Thank you.  You didn’t have to agree to help me, especially when you found out that I betrayed your best friend.  I appreciate it.”
After Ron leaves, Harry walks through the forest.  He walks for a long time, Ron’s words and Draco’s kiss filling his mind.  He isn’t surprised to find himself in the gods-damned clearing.  His dreams have been taking him to this spot for ages now.
“So, I know that you likely have a lot that you want to say to me,” Harry began nervously, “and we’ll get to that, I promise.  I just want to start out by saying that the reason we’re back in Scotland is because Cass has agreed to get tested to see if she’s a bone marrow match for Scorpius.  I probably could have found a better way to say that too, but I’m terrible at this sort of thing, and I know it’s got to be on your mind constantly.”
“Everyone for herself on the pitch,” she said, raising her eyebrow in a characteristic Malfoy gesture.
Neither spoke for some time.  Draco sat, his shame and dismay weighing him down, willing to do anything, to give up his magic for a chance at changing the outcome.  He couldn’t look at Harry, and sat inspecting the crooked finger on his left hand.  He’d broken it during a particularly spirited disagreement with a member of an opposing team.  It still ached when it rained.  Draco wished it was raining now.  Any pain would be welcome to distract him from the dull torment in his chest.  He’d fucked things up so spectacularly.
“You can’t help it if you don’t feel the same way.”  Harry was barely clinging to his composure.  “I have to go,” he repeated, and, before Draco could answer, he had apparated away.
“Harry,” Hermione said gently, “our school years were a bit tough.  You had a hard time, and so did Draco, and it was hard for you to see eye to eye.  After we left Hogwarts, the two of you made your peace, but you didn’t see each other very much.  But you and Draco have been so close, all this time you’ve been here.  Just because you weren’t friends before, doesn’t mean you can’t be friends now.”
“This is how you thank someone for willingly walking to his death to save you all?  Have you no shame?  You’re so short-sighted, Minister.  Don’t you realize that, without any sort of balance, you’ll find yourself in the same situation in the future?  You can’t have Light without Dark, and you can’t oppress and eradicate a faction of people without consequences.  You, and the rest of Magical Britain, deserve the fate that’s coming to you.”
Harry shrugged.  “I’ve been having trouble with my coffee maker lately,” he admitted.  “I seem to be relying on the kindness of friends for my caffeine fix.”
“Dais.  It’s called a dais, and I know.  I’m overreacting.  But it’s weird being back here, and I had too many weird things happen in my life not to be on the lookout for more.”
I sit for a moment, thinking over everything she’s said.  I believe that her motives were pure enough, but something niggles in the back of my mind.  “Did you tell me what Kingsley had planned, stripping my magic and using me as a puppet?  Did you give me a choice about the memory experiment?”
“Master isn’t concerned, Kreacher, just curious.  Master certainly wouldn’t want to have to order you to explain what’s going on.”
He wrapped Cass into a tight hug, and whispered something into her ear.  She looked at him, bit her lip, and nodded, and then he kissed her forehead.  Again, Draco felt completely excluded, and a bit ashamed that he’d handled this situation all wrong.  Again. “Have a nice couple of days,” Harry said.  “I’ll see you on Friday.”
Harry considers this.  After a moment, he says, “I’ll send you a letter on the full moon of each month.  To let you know I’m still around.  If the letters ever stop, you won’t have to wonder anymore.”
“Harry,” Mister Fortesque starts, but I raise my hand, asking to continue.  He closes his mouth and waits.
“How do you think that she’d explain it, Hermione?  Don’t mind me, Mum, I’m just brewing Harry’s illegal love potion.”
He went to his rooms, showered, and donned a pair of dark grey track pants and a long sleeved t-shirt.  Muggles really did know what they were doing when it came to comfortable clothing.  Summoning a house-elf, Draco requested a Pepper-up potion and some coffee.  He would have asked for a protein shake, as was his normal breakfast on a training day, but he suspected that house-elf magic didn’t extend to blenders and electrolyte powder.
“Oh,” Draco said sadly, thinking about the time he’d invested in the inflammation reducer, and the amount of cleaning that would be required to set his lab to rights.  He spared a moment to consider berating Potter for his clumsiness, but, immediately rejecting the notion as not worth it, took a step towards the mess, and summoned his wand from its wrist holster.
“She turned into a lizard!” Violet cried.  Harry could tell that she was halfway between pleased at her bully’s comeuppance, and frightened by the strangeness of it all.
“I know, I know,” Draco soothed, once again struck by the discordance of comforting Ron Weasley about their mutual worry for Harry Potter.  Ron seemed to be thinking the same thing, because he gave Draco a slightly mad grin that made them both laugh.
“Why should I?  We aren’t friends, and this will take a lot of time.  Besides, if something goes wrong and I turn your brain to mush, I can’t begin to imagine how much trouble I’d be in.”
“How dare you!” Cass could feel her magic rising up around her.  For a tiny moment, she considered doing what Dad had shown her.  Take a breath, feel it dissipate.  Count your breaths.  Stay in the moment.  Then, she thought about her Dad, all alone and feeling like he wasn’t a good enough Dad, and she welcomed the way the magic completely overwhelmed her.  As the squeezy, awful feeling of disapparation rippled through her body, she unleashed every part of herself to embrace it.
Harry grins easily, the three fire-whiskies he’s consumed making the blood pump warmly through his heart, his living, beating heart.  “Not in the slightest,” he assures her.  “Sometimes I can’t believe it’s real, though.  That this world is ours now, and we’re safe.”
She purses her lips at Ron, but continues, “The super-ego also uses guilt to punish us when our behaviour falls short, and pride when we try to hit the ideals that it sets for us.”
“Yes,” Draco said weakly.  “And, thank you?”  He didn’t mean for it to come out like a question, but he wasn’t sure how to take back the way his inflection rose, and so, with some additional awkwardness, Pritchard bundled herself off through the floo, and Draco busied himself with cleaning all the surfaces she’d touched.  The next several Aurors came and went without any declarations of shame at their earlier treatment, and Draco had nearly begun to hope that his day would pass without any further awkwardness.
Ron and Hermione left reluctantly about a half hour before the Malfoys were set to arrive.  Hermione promised to owl Harry with the name of a good PR rep, and Harry said he’d floo them later.
Scorpius changed the subject to discuss the nearby park, with its brilliant climbing structure, and Harry made his excuses, arranging a time to meet in the next few days.  He logged his paperwork, and, since it was still early enough in the day, sent a Patronus to Andromeda, arranging to pick Teddy up from school.
The sky, which had been sunny, had become a bit grey and gloomy, and Harry wondered idly if it would rain.  Time passed, and he watched the clouds roll in, and caught a distant rumble of thunder.
At the same time he said that, Cass was saying, “Just as long as I don’t sort Hufflepuff.”  They laughed, and Draco tentatively put a hand on her shoulder.  She looked up at him with one of Harry’s guileless, happy smiles, and Draco’s heart clenched.
Draco escaped Lara’s office gratefully, and flooed home.  His Mother was sitting regally on a blanket by the fire, her wand waving as she conjured a set of stars that turned into a fiery dragon.  Harry clapped his hands in utter delight, his chortles filling the room with warmth.  Draco watched them for a moment, recalling a similar set of stars and an equally playful dragon that she conjured for him every night as he lay in his bed as a child. When Harry spied him, he let out an excited squeak, and crawled as quickly as he could towards Draco, who patted his head a little.  “Did you miss Uncle Malfoy?”
“Harry, you’re welcome to stay here until you get your feet under you,” Hermione replies, her big brown eyes searching my face.
“Yeah, but everyone was doing their best.  War’s funny that way.  Sometimes, people convince themselves that the crappy decisions they make along the way are worth it in the end.  So, the war ended, school ended, and Draco and I went our separate ways.  And maybe we never would have seen one another again, if not for wands.”
“That’s fine.  Kreacher will be thrilled.  Speaking of, how come you didn’t tell me I had a house elf?”
“We just need to get creative.  Maybe we could use a potion ingredient that is magical in nature?  Plants, maybe?  I don’t think that a conjured animal is giving us the right data."
I smile into his lips.  “I’d like that.  I have some things to do about the baby Death Eaters, but I should be able to fit it in.”
The next morning, I figure I’d better return the file to the Ministry.  Kingsley had made me promise that I wouldn’t allow evidence to remain outside the department for long, and, honestly?  There’s nothing there that gives me any lead on why this happened, or how to fix it.  Maybe my old self was better at drawing conclusions, but new me doesn't seem to be any good at it.
She laughs.  “As long as you aren’t one today, it doesn’t matter.”  Her face softens.  “And for what it’s worth, I don’t think you’re an arsehole.  In this job, I see a lot of people, and I’ve gotten really good at reading them.  You’ve always struck me as the sort of person who doesn’t want to be noticed, and when you’re the centre of attention, it’s uncomfortable for you.  Maybe you’re the sort of person who feels like he doesn’t deserve nice things.”  She shrugs.  “But what do I know, eh?  Maybe you’re just a prat.”
“Well, because Scorpius has performed accidental magic around people without magic before today, his file will be prioritized.  I’ll be his caseworker, I’ll work with him, and his support systems to ensure that he’s happy, and that he’s getting everything he needs to thrive.  Different kids need different things.  If we determine that Scorpius’ magic is lashing out because he has some difficulties dealing with anger, for example, we’ll arrange for someone to work with him on coping strategies.  If, on the other hand, he’s got more magic than we usually see at his age, we’ll need to find a conduit to productively release or dampen it.  The solution will depend on what his needs are.”
.  There were no potions smugglers, no unnamed suspect who eluded capture.  And Hermione knew about it, maybe planned the whole thing.
“Of course,” I say, stepping back and allowing him entrance.  I catch a closer look at his expression.  “What’s wrong?”
“I did,” Harry said cautiously, “but maybe I’ve had a bit of a change of heart.  I feel like your Papa and I are getting along better now.  Speaking of, I should go and make sure Papa is okay with you being here for a bit.”
“Nothing matters, or everything matters, or, as I came to realize, our choices and actions in the moment matter most of all.”  He smiles, and rests a hand on my head.  “Your past is a gift, Harry, but it shouldn’t overshadow the present, and it shouldn’t fully define the future.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry cried, and the tears that had been threatening spilled down his cheeks.  He looked horrified, and spun, running from the room before Draco or Kreacher could respond.
Later that night, when the kids were sleeping, Harry was surprised to hear a knock at his door.  He opened it to find a surprisingly ill-at-ease Draco, holding a bottle of fire whiskey.  “It’s been a hell of a couple of days,” he said. “I thought you might like a drink.”
“Hello,” she says.  “Don’t worry.  Mummy told me that you’ve forgotten everything useful.  I’m here to help.”
“No, definitely not that,” Harry laughed, and opened Cass’ door.  “Weasleys, I’d like you meet my daughter, Cassiopeia.”  Molly gasped, and Ron and Arthur made nearly identical noises of shock.
“I was just picking out clothes anyhow,” Harry’s voice says over the shower, and Draco squawks in annoyance.
“I understand the point that you’ve been making with your friends.  Nobody has the right to tell you what makes a full life.  However, having the last word isn’t a victory if you punish yourself by locking yourself away from what makes you happy.”
“I’ll kill you!”  Draco seems to have abandoned his wand in favour of putting his hands around the man’s throat.  Hermione steps forward and pushes him off.
Steam rose as the Hogwarts Express pulled into the station.  Draco looked fondly on as Cass’ face lit up.  She clutched an owl cage in her hand tightly, and stood on the balls of her toes, rocking back and forth slightly.  Draco wondered if she was aware that she shared this habit with her Dad.   Her face tipped up to look at him.  “He’s coming, right?”
Harry is instantly alert, hopping out of bed and pulling a pair of jeans on.  “I’ll go.  Is he at the Ministry or St. Mungo’s?” Seamus hasn’t been coping, in the aftermath of the war.  Harry has been woken a few times to help:  First, to try to convince him to leave the Leaky, when, drunk and belligerent, he’d taken a swing at Tom when he’d given last call.  Then, to use his influence as the Saviour, to bail Seamus out of the holding cells at the Ministry when he’d been caught using magic in the middle of a Muggle Supermarket.  Seamus had cried on Harry’s shoulder all the way home, his gin-soaked breath hot in Harry’s ear as he thanked him, and promised to give up the drink.  A third time, he’d overdosed on potions, and had been rushed to St. Mungo’s, where Harry had sat by his side, green eyes never leaving Seamus’ face as he’d waited for him to wake up.  All of their friends have tried to help him stop.  Dean has moved in with him, and Pansy has gotten him a job with her uncle.  But Seamus is too shattered from the stress of the year, and he keeps falling off the wagon.
“Yeah.  Through a bunch of circumstances, I ended up with Draco’s wand during the war.  Afterwards, I gave it back, but wands are funny, you know?  They have strange loyalties, and Draco’s wand never worked properly for him afterwards.  It would do basic spells, but as your Papa started doing more complicated magic, it was letting him down.  I dunno.  Garrick said that it was because Draco was a different person after the war.  At any rate, that’s how he ended up in Ollivander’s one day. I was still early on in my apprenticeship, but Garrick had me help Draco find his new wand.”
her.  Most of the time, her bossiness is endearing.  And sometimes, she goes too far, and I get annoyed.  You haven’t fought back, not before this, not ever.  I think you surprised her.”
Sighing, Draco calculated that he’d be able to complete the Imperius vaccination as well as a blood-thickening potion both before the Auror parade began.  Just to be safe, though, (
Draco felt his eyebrows shoot up in surprise.  “I…Certainly.  Ron, do you need us to make statements or anything?”
The voices came closer, and Harry tensed.  Why hadn’t they gone away?  A few things happened all at once.  The voices got louder, and suddenly Darkness was gone, replaced by fierce light that made him squint.  He scrabbled backward, trying to get as small as he could in the corner of Safe.  He saw something, something that was familiar, but before he could try to figure out what was there, Blanket was torn away from him.  He heard a strange wailing noise, and wondered what these things were about to do to him.
“Missed you,” Harry breathed softly, pressing a soft kiss against Draco’s pulse point.  Draco’s arms tightened around Harry, his face buried into Harry’s sleep-rumpled hair.  Harry’s hands ghosted down Draco’s sides, his rising erection warm and persistent against Draco’s hip.  Before Draco could do anything, Harry had slithered down the bed and took Draco’s cock into his mouth.  Draco felt a gasp escape his parted lips, Harry’s tongue and lips and the warmth of his mouth around his cock.
Violet’s face fell, and Harry quickly reminded her he’d be back to visit soon, and that there was a support and social group that the Powers family could join to meet other families who were new to magic.  Reluctantly, Violet disappeared up the stairs to get ready for her lesson.  “Mr. Powers,” Harry said quietly.
promised not to look at his mind anymore, so I couldn’t even peek.  It was like he was afraid, or something, like he just needed to get away before he…I dunno, freaked out or something.”  Cass let out a big breath, which made her curls whoosh away from her forehead.  “I dunno, maybe he’s fine.  He sent me a laptop, and promised to email me every day.  I just have a funny feeling.”
Then, a tall, beautiful blonde woman was standing in front of him, and he recovered, and said, “Mrs. Malfoy, it’s very nice to meet you.”
Her lip quirked.  “I seem to recall another unnaturally beautiful baby, once upon a time, but the colouring was all different.”
“Alright then.  Was it only your staggering lack of filter at the dinner table that has you so upset?”
Draco was struck, suddenly, by how they’d all moved on.  His absence hadn’t really left a gap at all.  Such a strange feeling, he marvelled, to be glad that these people who mattered so much to him were healing, and simultaneously completely furious that nobody missed him.  “I’m glad,” he said tightly.  “Glad that you have each other.”
“It wasn’t just that.  My Father…wasn’t coping well with prison.  I visited him each week, and he seemed less and less stable, each time I saw him.  He was dying in front of my eyes, week by week.  And he was fixated upon restoring our name.  He was so filled with regret for how he’d let the family down, all he wanted was something to hope for.”
“No, Malfoy, I can’t.  I have to go back to the Ministry before anyone notices that Harry and I are both gone.”
It wasn’t, not really, but Harry’s easy acceptance that sometimes your brain makes you do pointless things warmed Draco’s heart a little.  “It is, sort of.  I know that we’re safe here, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t check the wards three times every night before I go to bed.  Sometimes I try not to give in, but it’s hard.”
“Yeah, I know, mate,” he says, scrubbing his hand through his hair.  “And don’t think that we won’t talk about how your antsy feelings resulted in you grinding on fucking
“I will speak to you later.  Now, either cease your impolite behaviour or leave this table,” Harry said, in a tone that left no question.
“Long time.  Is Scorpius okay?”  Draco’s grey eyes, (and how could Harry have not remembered those eyes?), were filled with fear.  He looked good, Harry realized.  He was still lean, but he was nearly a head taller than Harry was.  He’d stopped doing unnatural things to make his hair all sticky and slicked back, and a little shock of it fell over one eyebrow.  He was wearing Muggle clothes, Harry realized, and he found himself bemusedly approving of the way Malfoy’s legs looked in the slim trousers.
To his relief, Mrs. Nott chuckled.  “Your name is quite a bit bigger than you are, lad.  We’ll see you at 11:00.  Do you think that you could do something for me in the meantime?”
Ron and Hermione are home before he knows it.  Ron’s drunk too much at the party, and he’s verbose.  “Malfoy looks like shit, mate.  It was like being at a funeral.”
“Do you ever-” he began, and then stopped abruptly.  He didn’t want to know.  She looked at him expectantly, but he just smiled, and took another sip of his water.  The waiter arrived, and they placed their orders, leaving them to stare at one another awkwardly.
“I get that.  I believe you.  But I don’t remember it.  He hasn’t said a single thing to me to make me think he’s still like that.”
Severus was watching Harry very closely, his dark eyes keen, but his face wholly impassive.  He seemed to recognize something in Harry’s expression.  “Harry,” he said softly.  “Go for a walk.  Get some air and clear your head.  You do not need to make any decisions now.  Minerva and I will be here for Cass.”
“I think,” Harry said, “that we should take you home, and I can have a chat with your Papa.  I bet he loves you a whole bunch, and I’m sure he’ll want to know that you’re okay.”
“Shut it, you.  So I nearly worked my poor owl's feathers off.  I sent him letter after letter.  Sometimes, I’d tell him about my day, or what I ate for breakfast.  Sometimes I told him little secrets about school, things that I knew would get a rise out of him.  Eventually, I wore him down.  He showed up at the shop again, and asked me what it would take for me to stop pestering him.”
“I’m not,” she insisted.  “You’ve worked so hard to overcome the circumstances that life has dealt you.  You amaze me, every day.  But,” she sighed, “perhaps you’re right about not pushing.  What will you do instead?”
“Harry, there's nothing to thank me for.  I should be thanking you, for saving my son's life.  It’s hard, when your child is in the hospital.  And it’s especially hard the first time your child is experiencing treatment.  You did fine.”
When Draco entered Harry’s bedroom, he was surprised to find it empty.  He peered under the bed, and checked the loo, but there was no sign of him.  Suddenly grateful for his excess of caution, Draco praised his earlier self for casting a tracking charm on Harry.  “Point me, Harry Potter,” he said, and his wand spun like a compass to the closet, where, sure enough, he found a huddled little figure hiding inside.  “Hello,” Draco said mildly.  A little snuffling breath was Harry’s only response.  “Can you tell me why you’re upset?”
Malfoy coughed discreetly, and Harry was certain that he was stifling a snort.  “Scorpius, why don’t you go and help yourself to a snack from the fridge.  Mr. Harry and I will have a talk, and then, later, we can go to the park.”  Scorpius gave him a somewhat dubious look, but obediently disappeared.  “Sit, Potter,” Draco said, his voice not welcoming, exactly, but also not full of scorn.
He had known that he didn’t deserve someone like Harry, could never live up to being worthy of him.  And now, life had reminded him of the fact.  He suddenly remembered something that Snape had asked him, often, during the year he’d been trying to fix the Vanishing Cabinet.  “Draco, you’re acting with your emotions.   Ask yourself, ‘What would the Slytherin do?’”
“A promise is a promise,” Draco said, and Harry smiled.  “I wondered if you wanted to talk about what happened?”
“I know, okay?  He’s alive, and he’s going to live, and be fine.  I know that.  But just give me one fucking second,” he says, sounding furious, “to mourn that he’ll never be able to have a child of his own.”
“In name only.  It was expedient to give him a position of authority, but dangerous to give him real power.”
“We fight all the time, and not in the way we used to.  At Hogwarts, we’d bicker, and it made me feel alive, it challenged me.  Now, it just makes me sad.”
, Draco thought absently.  Scorpius clutched his new book tightly in one hand.  They’d made it to Flourish and Blotts to obtain his reward for his good behaviour at the Healer’s, but Scorpius had been too tired to visit any of the other shops.  As Scorpius snuffled, and rolled over, the blanket slipped from his shoulders.  Draco tucked him in more firmly, and smoothed the hair away from his brow, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead.
“Malfoy?”  Harry stared at his former childhood nemesis, and his breath caught in this throat.  He looked again at Scorpius, and yes, of course he could see a resemblance, now that he was looking for it.
“I think I’ll take Ron and Rose home.  Something tells me that Harry will do better one on one, and he seems to feel comfortable with you.”
As you might know, I’ve sorted everything out with my Mother’s estate, and it seems like it’s time to go back to Toronto.  I won’t trouble you with any further apologies.  I hope you believe that I will regret what I’ve done until I take my last breath.  I’m glad to have come home though, to have seen you, to see that you have surrounded yourself with people who care about you.  Be well, Harry.  Find someone who sees in you what I do, make a life with them.  Grab your happiness and never look back.  I wish you the very best.  If ever you need anything, please let me know.
“It was hard for all of us, Mother.  I didn’t see how burdening you with my indiscretions would help anyone.”
Grace doesn’t answer, and Draco looks up to find her staring hard at him.  Her brown eyes are wide, and she’s biting her lip.  He finally snaps at her.  “What?”
After Ron left, Draco sent a few messages with his owl to some of his father’s dodgy potions contacts.  He’d never really worked with them, wanting to keep his fledgling reputation clean, but, ironically, the Malfoy name still held some sway in certain circles.  He heard the knock of an owl at the window that evening, and expected it to be a response from one of them, but was surprised when it was the tiny, hyperactive owl again.
“No,” he said, marvelling that his voice remained even.  “No, I don’t think so, not right now.  I’ll see you.”
Cass watched, and listened, and learned, and finally decided that enough was enough.  She counted back in her head, and realized that it had been five days since she’d heard from Dad.  And Papa was never going to help her unless she forced him to.  She waited until she knew that Papa was tucking Scorpius in, and with a few minutes to spare before he came to check on her, she set the scene.  At first, she considered the pathos of hiding in her closet, but it was too much of a slap at her dignity.  Very well.  Thrown across the bed, then.  She artfully arranged her limbs, and concentrated.  At first, it was difficult to muster any tears at all.  Cass simply wasn’t much of a crier.  She thought of the saddest things she could, and found, to her surprise, the moment she thought about how much she missed her Dad, the tears came of their own accord.  She’d been holding herself together, because she hadn’t seen another choice, but the moment she gave in to her loneliness and worry, it was like unstoppering a vial.  Cass wept, and the tears felt good.
.  I imagine that, with a title like ‘Unspeakable’,  first names aren’t to be revealed, and it spikes a bolt of vindictive joy in me, even as I’m grappling with the disappointment that I was wrong about Smith. (That fucker.)  Hermione goes to the cupboard, spells it open with a wand, and removes a tiny vial filled with clear liquid, and a crystalline orb.  She taps the orb with her wand, and says, “Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley, issuing a challenge to Unspeakable Wendell Bright.”  She rattles of the date and time, and gestures Wendell into a nearby chair.  He moves as though he’s compelled, each action jerky and automatic.  The Department of Mysteries is truly weird, I decide.  The moment he sits down, Draco and Pansy rush to Scorpius’ side and start casting spells on him.
Draco smiled.  “Mostly, yeah.  I worry that if I go out, I’ll get exposed to some sort of disease, and then infect the house, and the moment my Mother or someone comes here, they’ll get sick, and it will be my fault.  It’s mad, really.”
“I was fully in charge.  I don’t think that anyone even read my reports, not that they would have cared if they had.  Uncle Wendell told me that I could do as I saw fit.”
“Oh?”  Strictly speaking, Harry was under a restrictive secrecy agreement, but, since Andromeda was a Healer, she was a bit of a loophole, and Harry appreciated her advice. He supposed that it was
Harry laughed.  “I promise you that you’ll see all of those things, but first we need to go to our quarters and get settled.  There are a lot of details we need to sort out.”
“Yeah, alright, I need to do up the intake papers for Violet, any road,” Harry said agreeably.  He gathered the parchments and apparated to the Ministry.  The DMAC office was near-deserted, but he could see a light in the office beside his.  As he dropped the reports off, and gathered an intake form and a quill, he popped into the lighted office.
“Why wouldn’t I?” Cass tilted her head, surprised.  “Of course I want to know more about you, learn your stories.”
“Well, yes,” said Hermione, “but we were more interested in another theory he had, about the id, the ego and the superego.”
Harry doesn’t answer.  He stands, hands stuffed into the pockets of his too-large jeans.  Draco registers that he’s back to wearing the worn-out, enormous clothes that he used to wear, before Pansy took hold of him, and convinced him that he was too rich, and too pretty to wear rags anymore.  His thick sweater looks hand-knit, and a little shabby, as though he’s worn it many times.  A Weasley sweater.  Harry once told him that the sweaters were the first thing he’d ever worn that made him feel good about himself.  Loved.  Draco had made a snide comment, but he’d remembered it, just, he can finally admit, like he’s listened to and remembered every other thing Harry’s told him.
name is Diane, and shame on you for being sexist.”  I fix him with a stern look, and he feigns chastisement, his eyes showing how absolutely delighted he is with me.  I guess his family doesn’t do this with him.  “So we’re sneaking through the warehouse, in search of the baddies.  They’re just…wicked bad arseholes, plotting to take over the world, and I’m in their lair.  There are crates and crates of fireworks everywhere, and I’m just about to uncover the one piece of evidence I need to put them away for life.  I hear a noise behind me, and I whirl around to see…him.  The chief baddie of them all.  He’s ugly, disfigured, missing a leg, and,” I say, taking a chance, “even more horrifyingly, also missing…an ear.  It’s disgusting.  Put me off my dinner for a week.”
“I’m your family, yes.  But that’s what they are as well.  I think it’s nice that you have so many people to love you.  I was quite selfish, keeping you to myself like that.”
He’d similarly extended an invitation to Draco to join Sunday night dinner at the Burrow, but Draco had firmly refused.  “But Draco,” Harry had protested, “you know they won’t say anything.  They’re my family.  They’ll love you.”
“You’re right.  I don’t agree that you’re making the right decision, but it is your decision.  I care about you, Harry.  I want to keep being your friend.”  It isn’t the unconditional validation that he’d secretly desired, but, he reminds himself, this is why he never asks for anything.  People can’t disappoint you if you don’t expect anything.  He doesn’t know what to say, so he doesn’t say anything, and eventually, Luna goes back inside.  They’ve addressed it, anyhow, and while a part of him knows that their relationship will never be the same, he won’t feel like he has to avoid her completely anymore.
“But you don’t feel the same way,” Harry said, his voice heavy with resignation.  “I understand, Draco, don’t worry.”
“Enough!”  Cass didn’t mean to shout, but she was frightened, and upset, and she wasn’t used to people who didn’t
“Well, if we aren’t waiting for any additional family members, perhaps I will wake Scorpius now?” John asked.  Draco nodded, and John cast the spell.
For the umpteenth time in a week, Draco felt like the world was tilting on its axis.  “Are you telling me,” he said slowly, “that Professor Snape voluntarily inhabits a portrait in Canada, in the home of Harry Potter?”
“I think,” Draco said slowly, thinking, “that I have been about as happy as your Dad has been.  So there is the sad story of Draco and Harry.  Did I upset you?”
“Hi Peter, nice to meet you.  Thanks for letting Amy join us, she’s really been an asset to the group.”
Better enough, I think, to address the elephant in the room.  “So, if it’s going to take a while to get my memories back, I think I need to figure out a few things,” I say.  Hermione takes a breath, and I can tell she’s been waiting for this.  “But,” I continue, “I gather I’m not the smartest bloke around, and even I can see that my life has been…well…”
“Yes, of course.  Use the one in my office, it’s quieter,” Draco said.  He looked away, then looked back and gave Harry a little smile, and his eyes flared with something that looked suspiciously like lust, just for a moment.  Harry, a little overwhelmed, ducked his head and made his way to Draco’s office, where he slumped into Draco’s desk chair and tried to catch his breath.
.  “This is strictly a political appointment.  You’re promoting me into a position I’ll be terrible at, to operate as a figurehead.”
“Draconus, you know that this is your duty to the family.  You must marry, produce an Heir, continue the line.  This has never been up for discussion.”
The laugh huffs out of me without my permission.  Draco continues, “It doesn’t matter, though.  That’s the past, and there’s no point in revisiting it.  I’m interested in you now, Harry.”
“Robards?  Don’t make me laugh.  He’s already retired, as far as I’m concerned.  He was thrilled to have one less thing to think about.  I got him to appoint my nephew as team lead, and then it became easy.”
“My name is Scorpius Amicus Greengrass-Malfoy.  It’s nice to meet you, Mrs. Nott.” he replied.  Draco tensed.  The Malfoy name had recovered some since their disgrace, but Draco still feared that someone would shun his child for the misdeeds of his ancestors.  The Notts hadn’t been convicted as Death Eaters, but they were Slytherins, he remembered, his mental calculus suggesting that this could go in any direction.
Draco had heard the term ‘his blood ran cold’ before, but had never experienced it before.  At Hermione’s words, though, it was as if the blood running through his veins had turned to ice.  His belly flopped menacingly.  “This is Harry’s house?” he asked quietly.  At Hermione’s nod he felt hot and cold and as though he might sick up on Hermione’s shoes.  “Oh Merlin, I’ll kill Pansy.  I have to get out of here.”
We arrive at Malfoy Manor, and the wards accept us immediately, prompting me to wonder exactly what Pansy’s relationship with Draco consists of, and why he wasn’t helping her when she was arrested.  There are more important things to think about though, and she leads me to a sitting room, where a hunched, defeated figure slumps in an armchair by the fire.   All of my earlier irritation dissolves when, hearing our entry, Draco looks up.
“I’m fine, Harry, thanks,” she grumps, and I manage not to roll my eyes.  “Yes, I have a law degree, but I’m still finishing my articling.”
He flushes, and looks away.  “No,” he admits miserably.  “The Goblins made it clear that if I wanted to keep my job, I’d need to avoid association with anyone inappropriate.”
Hermione laughed.  “It’s a Muggle drug.  They call it the date rape drug.  It lowers inhibitions, and makes it easy to take advantage of unsuspecting victims.  That’s why you need to keep an eye on your drink in clubs.”
“Oh, my poor boy,” she said softly.  Draco knew that he was intruding, and so he slipped from the room, and went to update his Mother and the Weasleys.   They wanted to come immediately, but Draco refused, saying that they could come and see Cass when she’d awoken.  Unwilling to interrupt Harry and Minerva, Draco went to the canteen, and got himself a tepid cup of tea, and, after a moment’s hesitation, another one for Harry.
“My mum never sits down.  We all nag her about it, but she never stops, morning to night.” Louise confides.
“Did you know that you were abusing your position, and creating a situation where these individuals couldn’t possibly be rehabilitated?”
The silence stretched, and Minerva looked uncomfortable, and finally, Harry sighed, and said, “Who is it?”  Minerva took a breath, but didn’t say anything, and he continued, “Ron or Hermione?  Are they dead?”
“And sometimes,” he says, “we’d sit out here, and hex the peacocks when they came too close.”  Harry laughs, a little horrified, but wholly amused at the idea of two snotty Pure-bloods doing something as undignified as casting spells on birds.  “You don’t understand,” Draco protests, when he sees the look on Harry’s face.  “They were absolutely vicious, and they’d chase me and bite me when I was small.  I was terrified of them, but my father loved them, doted on them as though they were kittens.  We had to keep our efforts secret of course, Father would have been furious if he’d caught us, but Mother knew how much they scared me, and she wanted me to feel safe, so she taught me how to scare them away.  She always wanted to keep me safe…” Draco’s voice trails off then, and Harry hears the intake of breath.  He puts his arms around Draco, and allows him to cry.  He’s nearly silent in his weeping, but his lean body trembles.  Harry recasts the warming charm three more times, while Draco cries, and sometimes talks.
Harry nodded.  “Primarily, I have post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a reaction to living through a traumatic circumstance.  As you know, there are a few traumatic events that I’ve experienced, and so in my situation, it’s a bit difficult to narrow down when it originated for me.  Because of that, I’ve overdeveloped a few coping methods-”  Miriam made a little sound, and Harry’s mouth quirked.  “I’ve overdeveloped a number of avoidance behaviours,” he corrected, “which allowed me to continue to function for quite a while without experiencing many overt symptoms.”  He looked at Miriam, who beamed like a proud parent.  He took a breath, and continued, “The breakdown I experienced after I left England occurred, likely because I didn’t have access to the outlet for my avoidance behaviours, and I had to confront the trauma directly.”
“You were dissociative.  You’d lost connection to reality.  Your daughter and Mister Goyle found you in a closet, in the dark, wrapped in a blanket.  It was clear that you hadn’t eaten or bathed in a number of days.  They contacted emergency services, and they took you to St. Vincent’s Magical Hospital in Toronto.  Your immediate condition was stabilized there, and then your next of kin arranged for you to be transferred here.”
“You know,” she says, her kind face hardening a little, “one of the things I always found interesting about you, was how you insisted on doing things without help.  It’s always been this way.  But you’ve never needed to go it alone.  And you’ve always been more successful when you let your friends help you.”
He turns around, and Draco sees his face and immediately wishes he’d turn away again.  Pain this naked shouldn’t have to be witnessed.  “Draco, this has broken my fucking heart.  I have been
“Stay where you are,” Draco commanded, his voice wavering a little, which caused Potter to still momentarily and examine Draco’s face again.  Whatever he saw there didn’t deter him, and the baby continued steadfastly crawling towards Draco, who squawked in surprise and took a step backward.  This seemed hilarious to Potter, who chuckled in glee before redoubling his pursuit.  “Stop, now, Potter!” Draco could hear the thin edge of panic in his voice.
She’s right.  But… “Pansy, I’m not sure I’m the best choice to help.  I don’t remember anything, and my magical skills are on par with a third-year.”
“You didn’t have to, though.  You’ve already done enough for everyone.  Thank you for that too, I suppose.  Really though, why did you do this for me?”
Harry was waiting for them in the visitor’s lounge, standing in the corner, bouncing a little on the balls of his feet.  Draco scanned his face, looking for progress, checking to see if the tense, drawn look had receded any.  Harry smiled nervously at the sight of them, but waited for them to cross the room to him.
Harry smiled.  “And then there’s Malcolm.  He’s littler than Scorpius, and he’s had a really tough time lately.  He likely won’t say a word to anyone the whole time we’re here, but I’d really appreciate it if he could be included.  So you see?  Helping each other.  That’s all.”
“Hello, little cousin,” Draco said to the baby.  Teddy regarded him thoughtfully for a moment, then his face screwed up into an enormous toothless grin, and he held his arms out to Draco. Draco shuffled him awkwardly, having never held a baby before, but Harry looked delighted.  Andromeda’s face revealed nothing.
His eyes flick to look into mine, and I try to tell him everything with my gaze.  “I like the rest of you just as much,” I continue.
“I thought so.  Draco and I have been catching up.”  Draco looks up at me, and his eyes are suspiciously bright, as though he’s been crying, or near to it.  I place a kiss on the top of his head and sink into a chair beside him.
“Yeah.  I tried the first time that Scorpius had to have a procedure to repair the damage from all of his nosebleeds.  The doors lit up and an alarm sounded, and four mediwitches came running and yelled at me.  Seems a bit over the top, considering, but I suppose they get their fair share of nervous parents.”
Draco is looking at him as though he’s speaking Parseltongue, but he’s pretty sure he isn’t.  He waits a moment, but Draco doesn’t say anything, and Harry literally wants to die.  He thinks he might just get up and leave, and then go cast the Killing Curse on himself.  But he wants to be sure, so he tells himself to be brave, and says, “Did you?  Have interest?”
Hermione continues, “The ego develops as a sort of mediator between the id and the real world. It is the decision-making component of personality. It’s the factor that helps us postpone gratification when it isn’t appropriate.”
Peter looked disappointed, but Harry’s tone, while friendly, left no room for negotiation.  “If you change your mind, Harry, please do get in touch.  I’d really like to get to know you better.”
With the help of Scorpius’ favourite house elf, Kattie, it wasn’t long before both Draco and Scorpius were bathed, dressed and sitting at the breakfast table.  Scorpius was happily describing to Draco the eating habits of the Hungarian Horntail, his current favourite breed of Dragon.
The elder Fortesques are clearly concerned as they sit me down at the generous back table with a pot of tea.  “Is something wrong?”
“I understand you have something of mine?” Why did Harry look so sodding delicious?  Draco felt his hands extending, unbidden towards the flames.
Two days pass before his bedroom door opens again in the darkness, and a slim, pale body steals into the covers beside him.  Harry unfolds like a flower, surrounding the beloved form of his love.  “I got a rather pointedly-worded owl from Granger,” Draco says.
Harry was tired, and a bit off centre from his earlier fight with Hermione.  He didn’t fancy trying to convince this man to let him in.  He cast a mild confundus charm, and, a little dazedly, the man stepped back.  A woman came out of the kitchen at speed.  “Who is this?”
And just like that, Harry felt the bottom disappear from his stomach.  All along, he’d been telling himself that it hadn’t mattered, what he and Draco had, because he and Astoria were so obviously happy.  But a sham marriage, designed to produce an Heir?  It felt cheap, and Harry was so bitterly disappointed that he couldn’t speak right away.
“I’d rather find a dark corner and suck you off, but I suppose a drink is alright too,” I reply, and his eyes look like fucking
“If I want…Draco, it’s a dog,”  Harry’s eyes had filled, and enormous tears were dripping onto the puppy’s head.  The puppy looked up at him, and tried to lick his face.  Harry laughed, which turned into a tiny sob, and tears continued to roll down his cheek unchecked.  He buried his face into the puppy’s head, and it wriggled and tried to lick the tears away.  “It’s a dog, for me.  My very own dog.”  Draco looked helplessly at Hermione, who was wiping away tears of her own.  In fact, as he looked around the room, hoping that someone would help him navigate these unexpectedly emotional waters, he noticed that many of the Weasleys were crying.
Later, after they had coaxed Scorpius away from the menagerie, where he was so charmed by the Kneazle kittens that Draco may have agreed to buy him one when he was better, they were back at Draco’s house.  Over tea, Draco asked, “So, what else would you like to do, while we’re together?”
“Harry, we were grooming you for his position.  We’ve had this succession plan in place for almost a year.”
I don’t expect her to laugh at me, but she does, peal after peal of delighted, musical laughter.  It goes on for such a long time that I start to regret saying anything.  I can feel my cheeks heat, and I look down, embarrassed.  “I’m sorry,” Luna finally gasps, just as I’m considering how I can kick her out of the flat when she knows more magic than I do.  “Honestly, Harry, I don’t mean to make fun.” Her face darkens for a moment. “I know what it’s like when people make fun of what you believe.”  She reaches out and touches my face, her hand gentle, and I risk looking up at her.  She’s solemn now, and her eyes blaze with sincerity.  “You poor, sweet thing.  I didn’t realize just how confused you were.  Hermione isn’t involved in a conspiracy to target anyone.”
“Fucking Wendell,” Ron spits.  I heartily agree.  “About that, though,” he continues.  “We couldn’t very well leave him there to destroy evidence, or run away or something.”
Weasley looked frustrated.  “I don’t know!  He’s so good at covering his tracks!  I’ve suspected him for a while, but I think the last time he was in St Mungo’s with an injury, something they gave him reacted with whatever he’s been taking.  He’s gotten really weird.”
“That’s ridiculous!” Ron says.   “You can’t just preemptively punish people, if they haven’t done anything wrong.  And you can’t take children away from their parents for no good reason!”
“You’ve never been all that rational when it comes to Draco.  Even in school he sent you around the bend on a weekly basis.”
Draco considers.  “Bring him, I think.  He’ll give the house elves someone to fuss over.  Right now they’re all crying in the kitchen.”
He remembered the first few days after Cass was born.  Poppy Pomphrey had been his healer, the only medical professional Harry trusted, and she and Minerva had stayed with Harry until his incisions had healed and he’d caught up a little on sleep.  They’d wanted to stay longer, but Harry knew they had responsibilities at Hogwarts, and he felt he needed to prove he could do it on his own.
“Strong enough to do this,” he says.  At my concerned look, he smiles.  “It’s fine, Harry.  I would have given it all if it meant bringing Scorpius home.”
Harry had responded defensively, and protested that a simple mistake wasn’t worth getting upset over.  That the reason he’d gotten muddy shoes in the first place was because he’d gone to Hogsmeade to get Draco the sugar quills he liked so much, and it wasn’t Harry’s fault that the streets of Hogsmeade were muddy.  That if Draco thought he was so useless and worthless, he’d leave and protect Draco’s precious floors from being infected by Harry’s slovenliness.
Harry laughed.  “I’ll need to bring at least a few adults.  Can you imagine me trying to get them all attached to a portkey at once?  But yeah, that’s all.  If you want to have guests to Scorpius’ party, and you can’t have anyone who’s non-magical, we’ll be there.”
“You’re welcome,” Draco replied.  As the door shut firmly behind Harry, Hank edged closer to Draco, who was looking at Miriam with wide eyes.  “That…was excruciating.”
“That’s the part that I can’t seem to cope with.  I’m losing my lover and my best friend all at the same time.  I’m so lonely.”
He nodded his thanks, and set the kettle boiling.  When they’d settled with their tea, and Rose had been given a rusk that Hermione produced from her handbag, she looked at him expectantly.
“Just means I get you to myself.”  Hermione is making them enormous Gin and Tonics.  Harry slices limes, fires some crisps in a bowl.
I feel a twinge of disappointment.  Draco has responsibilities.  He has a son.  He has to go.  “Shower with me first?”
that he doesn’t know what the expression means, that he wants to know everything.  He wants to hear about everything that Harry has seen and learned, and he would have happily sold his soul for Harry to have shown up like this a day ago.  He wants Harry.  It’s as simple as that.
“It wasn’t worth it.  It would never have worked out.  I knew that you and Father would have been furious.”
“You can’t know this, not having been a part of his sessions so far, but Harry had made a great deal of progress.  When he came to us, he wouldn’t have been able to articulate any of the things he did today, and he stayed remarkably calm while doing so.”
“Am, I suppose.  But probably less so, since I don’t remember anything.  I mean it though, how did I even
“If I thought it an odd coincidence that this happened at the same time that Harry Potter had suddenly disappeared without trace, I didn’t say.  And before I knew what was happening, Draco had me speaking to the Greengrasses, and he and Astoria were betrothed.  I have no idea what Lucius said to him that day, but the spark that had danced in his eyes was extinguished.”
“That’s my wand,” Draco remarks.  “And my elf, actually.”  I barely hear him, trying desperately to understand what lies behind the mask on my younger face.  I know instinctively that I won’t be able to comprehend it.  If my feelings were a faucet, the tap has been wrenched so violently that only the tiniest trickle now emerges.
Finally, checks completed, he put on a pair of sleep pants, and fell into bed.  He soon regretted his wistful benevolence, allowing Harry to remain sleeping in his crib.  He’d only just drifted off to sleep when an earsplitting shriek tore through the air.  On his feet in an instant, wand at the ready, Draco looked wildly around his room, but saw nothing out of place.  The monitoring charms that Ron had cast on Harry started pinging urgently then, and he remembered, in a flash, who was sharing his house.  He ran into the nursery, and found nothing awry, save a small child, on his knees in his crib, screaming at the top of his lungs.  “Mama,” Harry wailed.  “Mama, Mama.”
“Draco,” I know my smile is flirtatious, but I’m going to push until he makes me stop.  “You look good.  Did you dress up for me?”
“And even though it’s stupid, don’t say so, okay?”  Harry was begging now.  Draco felt as though Harry was about to pluck out his heart and present it to them both.  He supposed he was.
“Not with each other,” she said immediately.  “I can’t bring another baby into this world knowing that they’d have a chance to being just as sick as Scorp.  It’s not fair, to either of them.”
Ignoring the painful burning sensation that centres in his chest, Draco swallows hard, and mentally wishes the couple good luck.  Harry deserves someone like Dennis.  Someone good, and who was smart enough to be on the right side of the war, and who could be sweetly devoted to him.  Someone that Harry wouldn’t be embarrassed to be seen with.
“It isn’t really an investigation of you, at least not formally.  I’ll be looking into all aspects of Scorpius’ life, to make sure that he’s safe, and happy, and getting all of the support he needs.  It’s not a fishing expedition, Malfoy.”  And it wasn’t, Harry reminded himself.  He
There’s a diary sitting on my desk, amongst a pile of parchment that all seem to be case files (surprise, surprise!).  I flip the diary open, and page backward.  Court dates, mostly.  The only people I seem to see with any regularity are Ron and Hermione.  There’s a healer appointment a month back, with the annotation ‘wild magic’, but knowing me, it’s research for a fucking case.
Ron looks a bit chastened at that, and again, I’m pleased that my instincts are, again, serving me well.  “I got the impression that we’ve stayed together because it was expected of us.  Ginny couldn’t really produce any compelling reasons other than a mutual affection for Quidditch and a first-year crush. Then I asked her if she’d ever suspected I might not be into women, and she seemed relieved that I’d figured it out.”
“Kreacher thinks he hears an owl,” the elf said quickly, and with a snap of his fingers, disappeared from the room.
“Draco, are you listening to yourself?  If this were someone else, what would you tell them?  If it were Pansy, or Blaise, and they were basing their self-worth on the conditional approval of another?”
His eyes widen a little, but he looks me up and down appreciatively, and pulls me closer, his thigh slipping between mine.  I can work with this.  I keep my touches light, move just close enough so that I get a blissful moment of friction against my crotch, and then back away again.  His eyes linger below my belt buckle for a moment too long, and then he’s meeting my gaze again, a tongue caught between his teeth as he give me a saucy little grin.  The song finishes, the next one starts, and he moves in closer again.  “Didn’t think I’d see you here,” he says into my ear, his breath warm.  I shiver at the sensation.
funny, until he murders me in my sleep,” Harry grumbled, yelling his goodbye to Teddy and apparating directly from Andromeda’s kitchen directly to his own.
“Nice girls don’t go down on their roommates,” Harry said with a grimace.  “It shattered her.  Blaise was all she had left.  She was homeless and broke, and it was rather difficult for a disinherited Slytherin to find employment, especially one with the dubious honour of having suggested they throw the Chosen One to the Dark Lord during the final battle.  Pans had a tough time, and, what can I say?  I’m a sucker for someone who needs saving.”
Miriam returned, followed by an enormous brown Labrador Retriever.  He woofed happily at Harry and sat at his feet.  “Hello, baby,” Harry said, and wrapped his arms around the dog’s neck.  “Draco, this is Hank.  He sometimes comes to sessions if I think I need help staying present.  Do you mind?”
“I know that.  Listen, before I saw you in that club, I wouldn’t have even considered you as a potential partner.  For all I knew, you were straight, and committed to Ginny Weasley, and hated me.  I don’t want you to think I’m…I don’t know…settling for something by dating you now.”
“Hello Mother,” Draco said, and crossed the room to greet her.  His lips stopped just shy of her upturned cheek, but, since that was normal for them, she gave him a breathtaking smile and then held her arms out to Harry.  His eyes widened, and quickly met Draco’s, as though he were asking permission.  Draco smiled encouragingly at him, and he slowly walked up to her, as though approaching a nesting dragon.
“Sort of.  They’ve given me an overview of my life story, and she talked about helping me learn spells, and cope with the big gaping hole where my brain was, but she doesn’t seem as interested in helping me just…get it back.”
Cass read the letter twice, and then set the laptop aside, resting her chin on her knees.  She’d suspected that something was wrong, but this was a big something.  She realized that for all of his stories, and his open communication, she didn’t really know much about her Dad’s life when he was her age, and during school.  She wanted to help him, but for the first time ever, she thought that maybe she couldn’t.  Maybe this was too big.  She needed to trust her Dad, just like he’d asked her to.
“Yeah.  I’ve never loved someone before, not like this, and it’s just such an amazing thing, that sometimes I can’t contain how happy you make me.”  Harry felt a bit stupid.  His terrible relatives had done such a thorough job of emotionally stunting him, that sometimes his reactions were incomprehensible to people who hadn’t spent their childhood in a cupboard.
Narcissa eyed his scar.  “That scar is freshly healed,” she observed.  “He must have de-aged to a point not long after…” The rest remained unsaid.  “You have no idea,” she said to the baby, “of the life that lies ahead of you.  Poor little darling.”
She sees something in his expression, and her face softens.  Draco suddenly sees the resemblance between this woman and his Mother.  “You’d better come inside.”
“But how?” Mrs. Fortesque looks sad.  “Even if we could manage the fees, we couldn’t cover another salary.”
Over time though, the secrecy had begun to bother Harry.  “I just wanted to have a pint in the Leaky.  Hell, even the Hog's Head.  I know you value your privacy, Draco, but I’m starting to think that you’re ashamed of me.”
Draco was interrupted from his musing by an ethereal girl with hair nearly as blonde as his.  She’d grown it out, and there were strands of glitter woven into it.  “Hello Draco,” she said pleasantly.  “You looked a little lonely here.  Am I interrupting some important thoughts?”
“Wow, that is a surprise,” Harry said.  “Believe it or not, it isn’t the strangest thing I’ve seen.  I’m going to call some of my colleagues to sort things out, but if you didn’t mind, I’d like to come inside with you, have a cup of tea, and explain some things.”
Draco looked around the platform, noting that it had largely emptied.  There was one family who remained at the opposite end, the mother leaning against the wall.  Her hands were over her face, and her husband was ineffectually trying to comfort her.  “I suppose we should go,” he said.
“I’ve listened, Hermione.  Thank you for your concern, but I think you should be going now.”  I stand and she looks at me imploringly.
By the time he returns with Teddy and Andromeda, the house is much fuller.  Their friends are congregated in a large breakfast room, and the elves, who seem to be happy to have something to do, bustle in and out with food.  The conversation falters when Harry enters the room.  He sees a few of them exchange gazes.  Hermione half rises from her chair, but a hard look from Ron causes her to sink back down.
And that had been it.  There was to be no discussion.  There was nothing Harry could fix.  It had just been a lovely time with someone Draco had been fond of.
Harry conjured lube onto his fingers.  He probed gently into the tempting ring of muscle and Draco sighed.  “Feels good,” he breathed.  Harry added a second, pausing to kiss Draco’s forehead, the tip of his nose, the crook of his neck.  His fingers probed a little before finding the delicious little nub of Draco’s prostate, and, as he stroked it, Draco keened.  A third finger joined the other two, and Harry gently stretched and prepared Draco.  “Baby, I’m ready,” Draco whispered. “Need your cock.”
“Yeah, there’s that,” Ron agreed.  “Anyhow, I’m here on unofficial official business.  I know that you and Hermione talked about my sister, and what she did to Harry?”
“Not necessarily,” Draco said, “but I can’t think of a single potion that could contain Ashwinder Eggs and provide a hallucinatory effect.  If the testing supports my theory, I think we can safely say that someone dosed Harry with a love potion.”
Draco’s face softened a little.  “You were thinking about how much you loved me?” His voice still contained a hint of fragility.  Harry hadn’t told Draco that he loved him before.  He wasn’t sure what he’d been waiting for, actually, he knew he did, but Draco sometimes got so uncomfortable around
Too much talking, I decide.  “You’re so beautiful,” I whisper, and his eyes widen.  I can’t look away, and it’s awkward, because I can’t see what I’m doing, but the friction of our cocks against one another is exactly what I need.  We kiss, and kiss, and I suck his lower lip, his tongue
“I can’t think of a better use for the dungeons,” Draco says, and nobody can argue with that, although I do find it a bit surprising that Draco has dungeons.  Once Wendell’s settled, Draco calls for tea, after a brief sojourn to put his son to bed (guarded by a house elf), and let his Mother know that he’s home safe.
And I am, right?  A smart man?  I want to be.  Still, I can’t help but poke the bear one last time.  “Hermione, do you know a bloke named Zach Smith?”
He looks thrilled at that, and I may not ever understand house elves.  It seems strange that these little indentured servants would be so desperate to serve, and guilty when they indulge themselves.  In their position, I can’t imagine being so self-sacrificing.  And yet…he cooks amazing dinners, so if I escape to my cabin in the woods, he can come along.
The longer he tried to ignore it, the more his sixth sense clamoured for attention.  This was different from his normal compulsive impulses.  Finally, unable to ignore it, Draco grabbed some floo powder, and readied himself to throw it into the flames.  He stood there for a minute, uncertain how to make his body obey his mind.  The two factions warred for a while, and, desperate to do something, Draco stomped away from the floo and to the shelf where he kept clean phials.  His breaths tearing his throat, he stood there, utterly furious with himself for his inaction.  The anger rose and peaked in him until, with a crash, the phials shattered, spraying the lab with glass.
She looks up, and Draco can see that the cheesy line has indeed turned her head a little.  She beams at him.  “You’re just as nice as I always thought you were,” she gushes.
“Snape came and woke me,” Draco says, his tone amused.  “I’m not sure if you’ve ever been woken by Severus, but even in portrait form, he’s a lot to deal with.”
So he does.  “After the war,  the moral backlash on Death Eaters was enormous, as you know.”  He looks at me and amends, “As most of you know.  They imprisoned anyone who was a Death Eater, and it was only your testimony, Harry, that managed to free Mother and I.  Our reputation was in tatters, and they seized a great deal of our assets in reparation, but we were free, and, after our probation, the Goblins were the only ones who would hire me.  Goblins don’t really care much about human matters; they only cared that I could do my job.”
“Here you are,” Draco repeated, and Harry remembered that this wasn’t a chance to catch up with an old schoolmate, but an open investigation, and something was wrong with Scorpius.
“You’re an idiot,” Cass said flatly.  “You tell yourself that because it’s easier.  Don’t you understand?  He has nobody now!”
And that’s how it transpired that Harry and Draco were left alone in the kitchen.  Draco had long ago gotten past the feeling of utter wrongness that he was in Harry’s home, and had resigned himself to drinking until his heart stopped aching so much.  It hadn’t happened yet; his heart was still clunking painfully in his chest every time Harry pushed his messy hair out of his eyes, but Draco felt that a few more drinks and it would happen.
It’s Draco.  The sappy grin is back, and I stumble to the floo, hoping for a quick shag before Draco goes to work.  Draco’s face is pinched.  “Can I come through for a moment?”
Draco considers creully blowing him off.  His old self would have, would have gone out of his way to hurt and ridicule the man.  But Dennis is harmless, if clueless.  He seems to have a crush on Draco, and it’s sweet, if unwelcome.  Draco resolves to set him straight, kindly, in private.  “I’ll remember that, Dennis, thanks.”
“I’m glad,” he says, but that’s not strictly true either.  He’s incredibly protective of Harry, and he refuses to stand by while people manipulate him.  Harry too, has gotten much better at setting boundaries, but he seems to appreciate that he doesn’t have to do it all on his own, and his gratitude, on the few occasions when Draco has stepped in to help, has been expressed in creative ways that Draco will never complain about.
When his Mother, having mercifully refused tea, left via the floo, Draco returned to his lab, and conjured another rat.  Several hours later, he had three dead rats, and was no closer to a solution.  His head bowed in frustration, he threw the stirring rod he’d been using to test the viscosity of his latest failure, and stomped upstairs.  He was surprised to find Hermione sitting with Harry on his sofa, reading to him.  “What are you reading?”
“This is quite unorthodox, you know.  The Department of Mysteries is hardly the place for a field trip.”
Resolve spent, Harry bucked his hips wildly, knowing exactly what angle to hit to land on Draco’s prostate.  Draco completely came apart under him, his breath in frantic pants, groaning.  With a sharp cry, Draco came, spurting his seed across his belly.  Watching his lover fall apart, and feeling the pulse of his greedy arse, Harry followed him, filling Draco with his seed.  When they both were spent, Harry lazily cast a cleansing charm on them, and snuggled close to Draco.   “You’re my very favourite,” he whispered to Draco, before falling, adorably, to sleep.
He was looking down at Hank again, and a single tear slid down his cheek and landed on the fuzzy head before Harry pressed his lips together and scrubbed a hand over his face.  “Keep going, Harry,” Miriam said gently.
“Oh no.  There are owl spells?  Have I been hurting them this whole time?” I look at Mill, asking with my eyes for her to fix this.
Draco is surprised to see him, then, immediately, the surprise is masked by Draco’s normal haughty stare.  “Potter,” he says, his tone revealing nothing.
“Draco Malfoy, Prince of Slytherin house had a crush on Harry Potter, half-blooded child of the light?” My tone is mocking, and his flush deepens.
Ginny screeched with rage, and raised her wand.  Four voices yelled, “Expelliarmus!”  Ginny’s wand flew from her hand, and in their general direction.  The force of the disarmament was so violent that it chucked Ginny backward and against a wall, where she crumpled in an unattractive heap.  Draco felt a tiny thrill of schadenfreude, which he tried, unsuccessfully, to tamp down.  (He was still human, after all.)  He quickly dispelled the disillusionment, and they stepped around the corner.  Ron ran to Harry’s side and started untying the ropes that were binding Harry.
I say,  “It sounds like it’s basically anyone who was considered Dark, though, not just Voldemort followers.  Their names are mud, so they can’t find employment, then, when they’re desperate, and turn to misdemeanour to make ends meet, they get punished.  There’s one girl right now, and her solicitor can’t get into the country to help.  Based on what you told me about your advocacy work for Werewolves after the war, I thought you’d be interested in helping out.”
He looked into Harry’s eyes, and, although Harry's eyes communicated his disappointment, his voice was steady.  “Please, Draco, don’t try to let me down gently.  It’s fine.”
He was surprised when he heard a familiar, abeit weakened, voice saying, “Well, Mister Potter, I did not expect to see you here again.”
I laugh.  “Draco, you just fucked me into my mattress.  I’m not going to forget that I’m bloody gay.”
Finally, unable to bear the lingering silence, and the vitality slipping away from Harry, Draco said, “Harry, what can I do for you?”
“Excellent.  Draco, to begin with, I want to thank you for joining us today.  It can be very helpful for those who are close to us to join in our sessions from time to time.  I’m sure that Harry appreciates your support.”
“I recommended to the Wizengamot that we remove all children from Dark-aligned homes, and that we work to restrict the actions of the adults who aren’t already in Azkaban.”
“Not my job to dole shite, you’ll learn that again.  I talked to Hermione, because she was upset, and I figured that my other best friend might be upset too, so I thought I’d drop by and see if you wanted to talk or anything.”
“I guess.  Is Cass going to wake up soon, though?”  Harry looked at Cass, his worry evident in his features.
I scrub a hand over my face, considering this.  It made sense.  I was essentially a walking powder keg.
“Hello Dungeon bat.  Have a nice day?”  Harry opened his (non-owl) mail methodically, but spared a glance to the portrait that took up much of the wall above the fireplace.
She considers him for a long moment, looking directly at him.  “Your motives are pure,” she says finally, and Draco and Hermione both seem to sag with relief.  “The surrender of your magic is a great sacrifice.  Have you searched your heart to ensure that you wish this?”
Side-along apparation is terrible.  My stomach registers its dismay by emptying its contents onto the grass, the moment we land.  Draco holds me up, and waves his wand to get rid of the sick.  He casts something that fills my mouth with mint flavour.  “Didn’t enjoy that, Draco,” I whisper.
Ron gives Harry a little smile, delighted with his ability to manage his mother, but seems to suddenly remember everything, and his face falls.  Harry says, “Hey.  It’s okay to smile. It feels strange, I imagine, but Freddie taught you everything you know about managing Molly.  He’d rather like us to have a bit of a laugh, I expect.”
And that had been it.  They hadn’t said another word.  Cass had finished her exam, and been pronounced fully fit to proceed with the bone marrow transplant.  They agreed upon a day in a week’s time, and Harry and Draco promised that both children would be there at the appointed time.  They, very politely, spoke through Cass until they could part ways at the floo, and there had been no further contact until Draco had shown up this morning.  When they had entered the room where Harry and Cass were waiting, Draco had ignored Harry, but hugged Cass.  Astoria and Scorpius had hugged both of them, and then they had withdrawn to their respective corners until now.
before their sodding wedding?” She gives up on the missing shoe and kicks its mate across the room.  “Harry!”  She encloses him in one of her breathtaking hugs, and Harry takes the comfort, lingering in the embrace for a moment longer than usual.
“Well?” Miriam asked, after she’d explained the plans to him. “Are you willing to take this journey with me?”
Harry’s brow wrinkled.  Malicious charm was an odd classification, one that he didn’t recall seeing before.  He grabbed an invigoration potion from the cabinet in the bathroom, cast a quick charm to freshen his jeans and t-shirt, and made his way to the back garden.  (Kreacher disliked it when Harry apparated directly from the house, telling Harry that it was ‘very bad manners’.)  He arrived in a quiet suburb, bathed in darkness.  It was ominously quiet, and when Harry checked his watch, he realized that it was nearly midnight.  What was a four-year-old doing up so late?
“He’s not nearly as angry as I expected him to be.  Said something about, ‘what would you expect’ and left as soon as the press had cleared out.”
“And both of us love him more than we love ourselves,” she said softly.  Harry shrugged.  It was true, but the words were too difficult to say.  “Harry, dear,  I’ve admired your strength of character since you were a little boy, and I’ve been very fond of you since you started coming over for tea after the war.  I love Draco dearly, but he has never been unguarded, and so he doesn’t understand how to treat those who are.  It makes him more careless than I’d like.  You’ve already sacrificed yourself once for the good of others.  Please don’t be in such a hurry to do so again.”
The restaurant that Hermione chose was Wizard, but Draco was grateful to see her sitting in a secluded booth near the back.  He slid into the bench seat across from her and returned her smile a bit tentatively.  So much rode on this, and Draco had never been good at playing nice.  There was so much history between this Draco and woman and her two friends, and it set Draco on edge.
“Draco, you didn’t confide in me then, and I understand why, even if I wish it had been different.  Will you take the advice of an old woman who has more regrets than I can count?”
“Pans.”  Draco breathed her name into her hair as he held her tightly.  “It’s wonderful to see you.”
Hermione, thank Merlin, jumped in to help here, and gave Harry a painstakingly thorough revisiting of the conversation that, no doubt, she’d had at eleven, when the Hogwarts Board Member visited her parents.  It was standard practice, Draco knew, to introduce Muggleborn wizards to their world.  Draco’s father had complained often enough about having to take his turn.
it.  I saw him send it.  Hallowe’en, right?” At Draco’s nod, she continued, “Hallowe’en is always a fairly difficult time for Harry, he misses his mum and dad.  But I saw him with that postcard, and when he sent it off with the owl, I asked him who he was sending it to.”
Cass waited for him to elaborate, but he didn’t.  She sighed.  This was frustrating.  It was like learning a new language.  “I’m not sure if he even asked you if it was alright.  If I could stay here for a while.”
“Yeah,” I whisper, and stand, pulling him to his feet, and leading him by the hand to my room.  The minute we cross the threshold, he pulls my white t-shirt over my head, and his hands move  to my belt.  I let him remove it, unbutton my denims and pull them off, along with my pants.  He seems to like the way I look naked and I want to say something cool and suave like I did before, but words fail me.  I gesture to his shirt.  He nods, and I say, “Lie down for me, beautiful.”
“He’d have more than his fair share if he returned to his portrait at Hogwarts once in a while,” Minerva groused, as she obediently followed them in.  Harry floated the tea things along, and the group resettled.
“Harry, you haven’t had an easy time, and Merlin knows, my family and I have our fair share of responsibility for it.  But you’re
“I am,” Draco said clearly.  His face was impassive, confident. Something changed in Cass’ face when Draco publicly claimed her, and Harry realized that he didn’t know what she was thinking.  Greg was standing directly behind her chair, one hand on her shoulder.  Cass was watching Draco, and Harry thought he saw a little of her tension leave her.
“In a sense.  The best treatment available is a bone marrow transplant, but finding a donor is quite difficult.  The odds are increased significantly when a sibling donor exists, but Scorpius is an only child, and we’re grappling with the ethics of having another child, since that wasn’t part of our plans before all of this.”
“A bit, I mean, she’d managed to make me believe I loved her for all those years.  What was to stop her from doing it again?’
He does, and I suck him off under the stream of hot water, and he lingers at the doorway of the bathroom to kiss me.  “Lunch tomorrow?”
Draco was nervous, but also secretly delighted that Harry wanted to acknowledge their relationship.  Besides, if Andromeda loved Harry, she was obviously nice, right?  Draco didn’t really know anything about babies, but he would learn, for Harry.  A tiny bubble of excitement formed in Draco’s chest.
Harry sighed again, and summoned parchment and a self-inking quill.  Minerva excused herself, and even Severus left the portrait, leaving behind some wary-looking sheep.
“I’m free.  And yeah, I’d like to,” Harry said.  His face had flushed further, and Draco was so charmed by the sight that he stumbled a little as they headed to the floo.
Cass seemed to feel that Harry was safe again, and so she and Scorpius took the snake to slither around the carpet.
Draco looked at Harry, who had dropped all pretence of normalcy and looked as though he were about to walk to his death.  Again.  His face was white and he was bouncing on his toes once more.  His hands were tightly clenched, and he didn’t appear to be breathing at all.
“If you want.  It’s mostly repetitive hard work, so I can’t promise anything sexy.”  Draco cursed himself as the words slipped out unbidden.  Stupid!
Draco still didn’t know what to make of this small, wise, child that seemed more like an adult than anything.  “I don’t understand.”
When he turned, the look on his face made Hermione’s welcome small fall away.  “Oh no,” she said.  “Was Cass not a match for Scorpius?”
I don’t fancy any more ice cream, but there’s no other shop I remember.  My eyes light on the big bank again, and I remember.  Draco Malfoy.  Smiling to myself, I enter the bank.  The Goblin guarding the doors glares at me, but I smile back at him, and that puts him off his stride for a moment.  I slip past, and scan the bank.  There’s no sign of that distinctive white blond hair.  I head to the Welcome Goblin’s counter, and if ever there was a misnomer, it’s that.  The Goblin is the opposite of welcoming.  I tell him that I have an urgent matter to discuss with Mister Malfoy.  For some reason, this prompts a sharp toothed grin that’s not a little savage.
“Yeah, sure.  Oh, and I suppose it needs to be said, I’m sorry for trying to grass you up to the Dark Lord.”
“Mr. Powers, I assume that Violet’s mum is a bit overwhelmed by the big changes that your family is facing?”
It didn’t take long for Draco to shower, dress, and brew a strong espresso, which he carried with him to the sunny room where his yoga mat had pride of place.  He sat crosslegged on the mat, and was about to set his wand to count down the ten minutes, when he stopped.  Feeling a little shaky, he set his wand down, and started to breathe.  He was midway through his twentieth exhalation, when the anxiety became too much.  Opening his eyes, he set his wand for nine minutes, twenty seconds, and resumed his practice.  When the wand buzzed again, he summoned his journal, and noted the occurrence.  It wasn’t success, but it was an attempt, and it would give him something to discuss with Lara on Wednesday, anyway.
It was all arranged very quickly.  Papa made a few floo calls, and then, before she knew it, he was holding her hand tightly and stepping through the floo as he called, “The Burrow.”
“We got an anonymous tip about a potions buy from a group of smugglers we’ve been tracking.  We were doing surveillance outside the warehouse where the buy was supposed to go down.  It was all just a routine day, when you pulled something out of your pocket and looked at it, got a look on your face like your baby was on fire or something, and you just took off running inside.  I followed you, but the minute I crossed the threshold, the wards popped me back out onto the pavement, and I couldn’t get in.  I called for backup, and threw every spell I know at the wards, but they wouldn’t fall.  Then, a half hour later, just as backup finally arrived, the wards came down, and we found you inside, unconscious, all alone.”
“Stop!” Draco’s near-hysterical with grief, and shame.  “Stop getting involved in things!  I don’t know why you keep coming here, and taunting me with your stupid invitations to coffee and your cupcakes!  I want you to go!”
Caring for a baby, it turned out, was much more difficult than it appeared to be.  Potter seemed happy enough to sit and contemplate his fingers while Weasley and Draco had been talking, but the moment Weasley flooed away, he set his enormous green eyes on Draco’s face expectantly.
“Well, your arse looks like two bludgers in a sack, and you’re not eight months pregnant,” Harry said, a little bite to his voice.  Ron feigned offence, but then laughed, and hugged his best mate.  Harry normally took the ribbing with good humour, but he’d outgrown his last set of magically expanded jeans the week prior, and was a little sensitive.
“No, Grand-Père.  Don’t worry.  I was hoping I could sit with you for a while?”  Cass curtsied with impeccable manners, and Draco smiled.
“Right, well, she’s still just as much of an airhead as she was in school.  She was trying to rent some Merpeople for a party she’s throwing.”
Just then, the sound of pounding feet caused everyone to turn.  “Harry!”  Scorpius was thrilled to see him, and threw himself into waiting arms.
The front door closes and Harry listens for the distant sound of Draco apparating away.  When it becomes obvious that Draco isn’t going to come back, he drags the blanket from his bed, still smelling of them, and climbs the stairs.  As he climbs out onto the rooftop patio, he wraps the blanket around him, inhaling deeply.  He stares at the stars until the sun rises.
Harry pulled out his wand, prompting a gasp from Violet’s mother and a look of confusion from her father.  He waved it gently, and the tea cup in front of him turned into a tiny baby chick, who blinked at him in confusion.
“Yeah, probably.  Just seems weird that the potions smugglers have disappeared without a trace now.”
I wonder if my old self knew how to do stuff like banking, but I decide to just lay my problem on the table.  “I don’t know if I have money.”
Mrs. Powers was still watching him carefully.  “I think,” she said softly, “that you do understand.  You’ve had a painful life, haven’t you, Mr. Potter?”
I wink at him.  “I seem to have a lot of free time on my hands, and Gringotts is one of about four places I know how to find.”
“No, no, I realize now that it was terribly stupid of me.  Don’t worry.  Even though it gave me a reason to get out of bed, put on clean clothes, leave the house, it wasn’t healthy for me, and it wasn’t really fair to put that kind of pressure on you.  When you finally disabused me of my delusions last week, it was…difficult.”
Until it doesn’t.  On the eleventh moon, Draco sits in his flat, waiting, until the sun comes up, but the owl doesn’t arrive.  He sits until noon comes and goes, and until night falls the next day.  Only then, does he allow the brokenhearted sob to escape.  He collapses to the ground, head on the cool tile, and the sounds that emerge sound barely human.  He cries until his voice is gone, and his face stings, and then he just lies there, silent, and hopeless, with no intention of ever getting up again.
“Merlin, I hope not.  If that’s how he indicates his interest, we’ll never get anywhere.  I imagine he found that weird postcard somewhere, and sent it without thinking about what it might mean.”
Draco nodded.  “Thank you for telling me that, Harry.”  Harry’s expression clouded a little, but he buried his hands into Hank’s fur, and kissed the top of his head.
Her red cheeks grow crimson, and she looks at her feet.  “No,” she says softly.  “I haven’t enough magic.”
“Do you suppose he speaks French?” Draco’s mother asked.  “I could swear he is saying ‘Foi’, which, of course you know, darling, is the original pronunciation of our name.  Malfoi.  I think he’s trying to say your name.”
.  I understand now.  I steal back under the covers, and wrap my arms around Draco.  He sighs, and lays his head on my chest.  “Draco,” I whisper.
The house is quiet as Draco enters, and for a moment, Draco’s terrified that he’s too late.  There’s a muffled thud from upstairs though, followed by a muttered curse, and Draco pounds up the stairs.  One of the doors opens, and Harry stands there.  Despite the fact that Draco has barged into his house, unannounced, Harry doesn’t carry his wand, or even look surprised.  “Oh, it’s you,” he says dully.
“Ron,” Hermione says, laying a hand on his arm, and that’s good, because, best friends or no, I’m not sure I want to sit here and get screamed at.  Surely I have a house somewhere, and if it’s lectures and screaming on the docket, I may as well go there, even if I don’t get told stories in the morning.  “We aren’t going to get anywhere if you get upset.  Harry is obviously confused, and we’re meant to be helping him.”
When lunch had finished, Draco had one more surprise for Harry, and, when he presented him with his old child’s broomstick, Harry looked at him in confusion.  “Do I need to do some cleaning up?”
“Am I?” Draco asked, in spite of himself.  “Well, that’s good.”  He didn’t really know what he was just in time for, so he looked around for Harry instead.  He finally found the dark hair in a sea of red, sitting by the fire, a red-haired baby Draco didn't recognize in his arms.  He had his back to the room, and seemed to be telling the baby a story.
“Sure,” Draco said.  He heard the whoosh of the floo a few moments later, and stood for a moment longer, watching his schoolboy nemesis sleeping peacefully in his crib.
He left them with a stack of pamphlets, his mobile number, and an agreement to return in a week’s time.  As they walked him to the door, Violet suddenly threw herself at Harry and hugged him tightly.  “Thank you, Harry,” she said, her blue eyes looking up at him in awe.
“Okay,” he soothed.  “And you’re right, he’s going to beat this, he’s strong.”  He looked closely at her.  “Do you think we should have another baby?”
“Oh yeah?  Um…me too.  I imagine you’re too busy to leave work, but if you ever want me to bring you in lunch or anything,” he says, his voice trailing off.
But, when your child was being stalked by a monster, you became a monster-hunter, and you armed yourself with knowledge, and data from clinical trials, and you learned all about the Muggle world, because they’ve done so much more research on genetics and stem cells.  And you learned about the internet, and you learned to rely on strangers, Muggles, that you’ve never met.  And you saw your son’s healer far more often than you saw your friends or family, and you learned to mop up a nosebleed without batting an eyelash.  And you learned the true meaning of mortality, when a new bruise showed up on Scorpius’ delicate little back, but you also learned to smile, and discuss dragons and to convince a stubborn four-year-old to ‘eat one bite, just one more bite, darling’.  It had been eleven months since he, Scorpius and Astoria first heard the words ‘Fanconi Anemia’.  Eleven short months to have the rug pulled from their feet so brutally that they still hadn’t been able to regain their footing.
“Harry,” Miriam said, and Draco looked at her, aghast.  He had honestly forgotten she was in the room, and was a little alarmed at having cried on a dog and experienced a life crisis in front of a stranger.  “I’d like you to try something.”
“You’ve never lied to her before.  It’s still your decision, but I think she has a right to provide her opinion.”
“No, I…I’m sorry, I didn’t…”. The words escape him, and Draco takes another step backwards.  He looks as though he’s terrified that Harry wants to hit him.  Then, before Harry can decide whether he does, or whether he wants to pull him closer and kiss him again, Draco turns and runs from the Tower, leaving Harry standing stunned and alone.
Hermione’s face softened a bit.  “Draco, I’m sorry, that was uncalled for.  It’s just a surprise to see you here.  After the way you left, I just didn’t expect to see you in Harry’s kitchen.”
Draco smiled.  “I understand that feeling.  Did she tell you that we found her a math and science tutor?”
“I think he’s right,” Hermione says, and Ron looks at her with a mix of horror and fury.  She laughs into his outraged face and says, “Honestly, Ron, if you’d stop to think about it for a second, you’d see what I mean.  Don’t get me wrong,” she continues hastily as his complexion goes a bit redder, “I think Harry’s being hasty, making all sorts of far-reaching decisions at a vulnerable time in his life, but you know that Ginny talks to me about things, and she’s been unhappy for a while, even if she couldn’t admit it to herself.”
“You did, though,” Mill says.  “Last year, when Pansy first came to me, and asked for help, I talked to you about it.  You went straight to Shacklebolt, and he assured you that the probation officers were monitored, supervised by the Auror Department.”
“I couldn’t imagine touching her, and if I hadn’t produced an heir, it would ruin Pansy’s life, ruin my family's reputation.”
Eventually, I’m pointed towards an office door.  As I lope over towards it, I realize that I have no reason for seeking Malfoy out.  I pop back to the Welcome Counter.  “Can you remind me what Mister Malfoy’s area of specialty is?”
I’ve got a bad feeling, I realize, as I cross the atrium of the Ministry the next morning.  The letter from the anonymous stranger has me rattled, and I don’t know who to trust enough to tell.
“You were,” I assure her.  She’s little, but lanky, all arms and legs, and she clambers up into the bed.  I am, belatedly, exceedingly grateful to my last night’s self, who managed to throw on a pair of jogging pants before I fell asleep.
Severus huffed from the portrait he'd entered.  “Your father has likely understated his notoriety in the UK, Cass.  You do know that he was a fairly public figure when he lived here?”
As they walked home, the grey skies clearly trying to decide whether to spit rain or snow, Cass gave him an arch look, and raised a single eyebrow.  “Was Amy’s dad asking you out?”
“Cass, thank you for coming to meet me,” she said warmly.  “My name is Cecile Clarke, but you can call me Cici, just as Scorpius does.”
“You’re no better,” Nettle said to Tamsin.  “Washed up, aren’t you?  One mistake away from getting the sack.”
“I…” Draco doesn’t know, actually, but Harry looks beautiful standing there, so he crosses the room quickly, and wraps his arms around him.
“Let me take you to dinner,” I say, “and I’ll answer any question you have.  If, after that, you still don’t want to help me, I’ll leave you alone, no foul.”
Dennis’ face goes pink, and his grin encompasses his entire face.  His eyes are filled with hope.  Draco smiles back at him, and quickly engages Hermione in a discussion about her job.  He listens with half an ear, until his gaze lands on Harry.  Harry, who is examining Dennis Creevey with an inscrutable look on his face.  His eyes flick to Draco’s, and for just a moment, Harry is completely unguarded.  There’s something in Harry’s eyes, something vulnerable, and young, and hurt.  Draco wonders if Dennis Creevey has managed something that nobody else has.  Perhaps Dennis has a real chance at Harry Potter’s heart.
Dashing upstairs to the shower, Draco completed the speediest, and most thorough cleansing of his life.  Hoping against hope, he donned his lucky boxers, hoping that the presumption didn’t jinx him.  He added the only pair of jeans that fit him properly, and a touchably soft dove-grey kangaroo hoody.  Standing in front of the mirror, patting his hair in place, Draco was aware of a thrumming plea resounding through his chest.  Oh please, oh please don’t let this be awful.  Please don’t break my heart any more than it’s already been broken, Harry.  Please want me again. Recognizing that any further delay would result in his chickening out, he made his way to the floo and fire-called Harry.
Mill sighs.  “It’s not that.  It just isn’t easy.  Your lot doesn’t really like anyone who was in Slytherin House, and so we don’t really socialize outside work. It’s just too awkward.”
“I’ll just keep asking, then,” Harry replies, and he reaches into his pocket, removing a second boxed cupcake.  It’s not as pretty as Draco’s, but it’s still an acceptable specimen.  “For you, Grace,” he says setting it on her counter.
“Oh, Cass,”  Draco said, and Cass felt herself being gathered into strong arms.  Different from Dad’s, but not uncomfortable.  “Darling, I didn’t know.  You’re very self-possessed.  I should have known, though.  Of course you wouldn’t let anyone see.  You come by it honestly, I suppose.”
Harry considered this for a moment and his smile, impossibly, widened.  “Let's go then,” he said, a little shyly.
“I’m not sure.” Harry was staring at his mouth.  His eyes flitted up to meet Draco’s before returning to their original target.  Curious, Draco let his tongue flit out and wet his lower lip.  Harry’s eyes widened, his pupils dilating. He stifled a groan.  Emboldened, Draco captured his lower lip in his teeth and widened his own eyes.
“And isn’t that wonderful?” Cici asked.  “Astoria mentioned that you’d be willing to undergo some testing to see if you can help manage Scorpius’ condition.”
“She’ll be fine,” he says.  “She’s disappointed, hell, we’re all disappointed.  You’re the least objectionable brother-in-law we could have picked, but if it’s not going to work out, better you know now, right?”
“We don’t have enough time for me to list the reasons," he said, rolling his eyes.  "Speaking of things we’re avoiding, what’s the latest with Ginevra?”
Madame Lefebvre didn’t seem to notice Cass’ reluctance as Draco paid for the wand, and it was packed into the distinctive Ollivander’s box.  Madame placed it into a carrier bag, and handed it across the counter.  Cass gave it a mournful look, before taking the handles and following Draco from the store.
“Well, maybe we’ll try a little something,” Draco said.  This wasn’t the time to begin a battle over eating.  Maybe after he wrestled Scorpius into his clothes.
“Well, it’s not completely altruistic.  I’ve recently found myself with a bit more spare time, seeing as how I’ve parted company with the Ministry.”
“What’s a…Harry,” Draco said, a sudden sinking feeling joining the usual roiling anxiety in his belly, “how much do you know about magic?”
is trying except for you.  Your wife, your mum, all of Dad’s friends, even Scorpius is trying to make me feel welcome.  You need to choose between me and your temper tantrum, ‘cause you can’t have both.  Now, where’s my brother?”
“I think that when I died, the part of me that was really human died too.  I think I might be just a shell of a half person, whose body hasn’t caught up with his soul,” Harry says.
“Am not,” Scorpius wept.  Enormous tears were rolling down his plump little cheeks, and Draco knelt beside him.
Narcissa laughed, “Oh darling, I don’t think that Draco could ever forget about you.  He certainly didn’t when you were children together.”
“Can we be done?” Harry begged.  “I want to see if Cass is still here, and I want a cup of tea and to be alone.”
“I told him that I met a new kid today, and that he was really cool, and he said he wanted to be your friend.”
His tiny, innocent self had hoped that, the moment he described his home life, he’d be whisked away to family that would treat him nicely, but he nodded, and waited.  Two evenings later, a social worker had arrived at the house.  Harry had been sent up to Dudley’s second bedroom while Petunia and Vernon had spoken to the man.  An hour later, he left, and Vernon had fetched him, his eyes promising retribution.  He still didn’t know what the Dursleys had told the social worker, but whatever it had been, it had convinced him, and Harry’s teacher, that Harry was a liar.  The teacher had sent him a filthy look when he returned to school, and nothing more had ever been said about it.  Harry’s punishment had left bruises on his arms and torso for days.
The bundle in his arms was growing heavy, and he was relieved to see the odd shape of the Burrow looming in front of him.  He hitched his armload into a more comfortable position, and opened the front gate.  As he approached the door, it became clear that there was a houseful inside, and they were having a terribly good time.  At first, he thought that the noise level was too great inside for them to hear his knock, but it wasn’t long before the door flung open, and the slightly inebriated face of Arthur Weasley appeared in front of him.  “Hello there,” he said genially.  “You’re not one of mine, are you?”
“I bet.  I’ll answer as many as I can, but there are parts of the story that I haven’t yet been able to tell Cass, and some things that Draco doesn’t know either.  I will be as honest as I can be, and while there are things I won’t explain to you, I won’t lie, either.”  Harry turned to Cass.  “Little duck, would you mind going to your room to read?  I promise you I won’t tell Pansy anything you don’t already know, and since she’s Draco’s friend, it’s a bit delicate.”
Scorpius was eying Hermione curiously, and she gave him a warm smile.  “Hello, I’m Hermione.  Would you like to sit down?”  He nodded, and clambered up into one of the desk chairs.  Draco noticed with a little pang that he was still too small to comfortably sit in a chair.  His feet barely reached the edge of the seat.  Draco sat in the chair beside him and ruffled his hair.
“Well, they mostly locked me in my cupboard and threatened to beat me half to death, so…I wouldn’t recommend their methods,” Harry replied, surprising himself.  He would have thought that Draco Malfoy was the last person he’d make a flip comment in front of, but it had escaped without thought.
Sending a half-apologetic shrug to Ron, who would likely receive the worst of Hermione’s rant about Crystals and divination, Harry threw on his jacket and made a hasty escape.  The apparation coordinates that he’d been provided landed him in an alleyway full of garbage cans.  He wrinkled his nose at the smell of rotting food, and took out his notebook.  It was a brilliant little thing, spelled to automatically update when his Department got a new case.
And then, like a dam breaking open, Harry had wept.  He cried and cried, for his young, hopeful mother, promising her baby that there’d be brighter days ahead.  For his broken godfather, who had never truly been freed from Azkaban.  For Remus and Tonks, who would miss out on watching their son grow up.  For Fred, for sweet little Colin Creevey, for Lavender Brown and finally, for himself.
Harry doesn’t say anything, because there’s no suitable response to a situation like this.  He clings tighter, gently running his hands along the plane of a thigh, the shell of an ear.  Memorizing body parts that he already knows better than his own.
“She’s fine,” Hermione says, and when Draco looks skeptical, she continues, “It isn’t easy to find someone who knows the brain and the Magical world.”
When they finally finished, and Harry was sitting, dumbly trying to understand all that he’d been told, Draco said, a little tentatively, “Harry?”
He waited six terrible hours before he broke down and sent one line, scrawled on a parchment, to Hermione:
“Really, Potter?  I wouldn’t think you needed protective jewelry, being the Saviour and all,” Draco says, wishing he were a better man, that he could simply treat Harry like he treats all of their other friends.
“What is it?” His voice was sharp, but in his defence, his heart was pounding, and he’d whacked his elbow, hard, against the doorframe as he’d flown around the corner.
The little owl seemed to have known that Draco would have a return missive, because he hopped excitedly from one surface to another as Draco wrote, and twittered noisily as Draco fastened the parchment to his leg.  As he disappeared through the window, Draco thought about what it would be like to experience his own adolescence again, and he hoped that Harry would be alright.
“Maybe not.  It kept me sane, though, for a long time.  A lot of stuff had…I dunno, hurt me, I guess, and I didn’t ever really work through things.  I was pretty messed up, when I got to Canada.  But then I had this baby, and she
“It’s true,” Astoria added.  “You start to learn not to think about anything beyond the immediate moment.  You start to assess things based on what you know right now.  And we remind each other.  We ask ’You good?’  And that’s really the question.  Right now, are you good?”
Another interesting facet to this new Harry’s personality was the unmitigated curiosity about the world around him.  Harry wanted to know
“As Minister?”  I can’t help but laugh.  “Are you serious, Luna?  No, of course not.  I couldn’t possibly be less qualified.  The position should go to someone who has shown themselves to be impartial in the past.”
“I know,” I say.  And I do.  These two have, I’m told, been my mates through all sorts of stuff, and from the way that everyone clams up every time someone mentions school, or the war, or that guy Voldermord, it must have been bad.  But there’s something that isn’t adding up.  “I do trust you, honestly.  And I’m grateful to have you taking care of me, and I expect I’m being a royal pain in your arse while you’re doing it.  But, it doesn’t sound like anyone knows how long it’s going to be until I’m fixed, and I can’t very well sit around here with you as my nanny until then, right?  I’m going to have to figure some things out on my own, aren’t I?”
“Of course, darling.  Mister Potter has been a loyal customer since he was a lad.  I’ll just take over here, then, will I?”
“Astoria, Draco, I know that we didn’t get the results that we were hoping for today, but please don’t lose hope.  I promise you that I will pursue every opportunity to help Scorpius get better.  I’m not giving up on him.”
It was the wrong thing to say.  Harry’s eyes widened, and he reeled as though he’d been struck.  “I, um.  I just have to take care of some…Cass?  You’re alright?  I’ll come pick you up after dinner?”
I follow him into the pensieve.  The setting is Scorpius’ nursery, and Draco is holding what appears to be a newborn.  He gazes down at the baby with heartbreaking tenderness, and whispers, “My son, I promise that there is nothing that I won’t do for you.  I will protect you with all that I am, and all that I have.  You are my future, and I will guard you with my very life.”
For a single, insane moment, I consider yelling, “Wait!”, and offering up my magic instead, but of course I don't.  It would be stupid.  Besides, the last thing I need is Mother freaking Magic pissed off at me.  Instead, with another blinding flash of light, Mother Magic disappears, leaving Draco panting and prostate on the floor, and a golden parchment where the chalice was.  Magic is freaky, and impressive.  I also note absently that Mother Magic didn't tell him that she'd be taking Draco's
“In a fashion.  Cass will owl her assignments to me, and I’ll send them via Muggle post to her tutor.”
Harry presents himself at Ron and Hermione’s door, ready for babysitting duty.  Hermione is walking around on one heel, muttering under her breath and trying to find the mate to her shoe.
“If you keep interrupting me, you’ll never get to the good part,” I say, stalling for time, because I haven’t the faintest idea what to name the fictitious dog I’ve just invented.
Draco’s smile felt bitter.  “Thank you Mother. I don’t think that there will be any way for us to come back from such a betrayal, but it does mean a lot that you’re willing to provide your blessing.”
, he thought.  He was home most of the day, and Cass would eagerly help care for one.  He resolved to look up animal shelters after Minerva had returned to Scotland.
“Mmm, yeah, you’re probably right.  He had that bedroom voice and all.  Plus, I bet he was into right kinky stuff,” Harry mused.  “Right then.  Fuck Snape, marry Flitwick and kill Sprout.  Poor Professor Sprout.”
This makes my breath catch, because maybe I was, and if that’s not a thought to give me pause, there hasn’t been one.  Old Harry and new Harry both would be opposed to evil dictatorship, although possibly for different reasons.
“No,” Draco sighs, when it becomes obvious that Potter isn’t going to leave until he answers him.  “I was out.”
“I think he has, ‘Dromeda.  Scorpius is perfectly lovely, and Draco doesn’t seem even remotely Death-Eatery.  It’s early though, and there’s
I give a little wave of my hands, as though to say, ‘well, there you have it’, and she huffs.  “Harry,” she says, “until things are fixed, I really think that you need to trust us.  We’re honestly just looking out for you.”
Mrs. Powers looked unconvinced, and Harry’s instincts were twitching.  She would need a lot of information, a lot of support.  “Listen,” he said quietly, “I’ve just dropped an enormous bombshell on your family, and I’m certain that you’ll want to take a bit of time to process it all.  What I’d like to do today is to leave some information with you, and come back to have another chat in a few days.  We’ll help you all get through the adjustment.”
“I know.  I know.  He’s absolutely furious with me, as he has every right to be.  I left the UK without telling anyone for what seemed very good reasons.  I honestly thought that I was doing the right thing.  None of that matters now, because I’ve cocked it all up, but I swear to you, Pansy, I didn’t do this to hurt Draco.”
He took Cass’ hand again, and as he led her out of the room, she turned to Draco, and said, “That's how my Dad parents me.”
They apparated to a spot just outside the gates of the Burrow.  Molly came to the door.  “Kids,” she said with a big smile, “and Draco Malfoy?  My goodness.”
It could be his only excuse for his thoughtless performance at dinner.  Narcissa had been telling Harry about Cass’ visit to the Manor.  Draco listened with half an ear, caught up in thoughts of Harry and Cass, and how he’d stupidly made the decision to abandon what could have been his.  Harry seemed calm about the fact that Cass had spent time with Lucius, and roared with laughter when told about the peacocks.
Later, Draco would ask himself why he didn’t just storm away then.  But then again, when had he ever been able to walk away from Harry Potter and his fucking cheekiness?  He downed the contents of his cup and grabbed a beer from the case on the island.
It’s a few hours later when I gradually come back to a semblance of awareness.  Awareness, specifically, of the distinctive hardness against my thigh, and the gentle rocking of his hips.  He isn’t quite rutting against me, but the nudge of his erection against me stirs my own groin, and I slide my hand down his stomach and beneath his pants.  His cock is hot, a little damp, and I feel it grow and lengthen against my palm.  I lean my face towards him, and his lips find mine.  As his tongue enters my mouth, I suck it, and swallow his groan.  His hand is on my chest, and he pinches my nipple, just hard enough to make me gasp a little.  I turn to face him, and he pulls my underwear down, as I’m doing the same to him.  He’s stroking both of our erections, and I sigh at the sensation of our cocks together, the way my foreskin is pulled down to reveal the tip of my cock.  It’s delicious, and I chase the pleasure, the way my belly tightens, and the crest of elation rises.
Besides, I’m nowhere near ready to talk to Hermione.  Despite the fact that I’ve tried not to consider it at all, my thoughts have returned to her periodically.  I recognize that her intentions were good, and her actions were stupid, and isn’t that basically the story of my own life?  But.  She made a decision, one that affected my life, without telling me.  It’s possible that someday, I might forgive her, and maybe someday after that, I might be friendly with her.  But someday is a long way away, and I have no intention of rushing it.
“Don’t be silly, of course she does.  I actually did let a little more slip with Andromeda, because she’s a Healer, so she’s bound by the same confidentiality agreements I am, and I wanted her medical advice on Scorpius’ magic.  She understands, better than anyone, Draco, about not letting little kids suffer because of prejudice.”
“Harry,” Mill smiles at me, and it’s a sad one, one that doesn’t transform her face like it usually does.  “I don’t think that you get just how cruel Slytherin House was.  To Gryffindors, and to any Muggleborn student.  To you, especially.  We were part of an organization intended to spy on the other houses during fifth year, and in our seventh year, Death Eaters were in control of the school.  They used students to administer discipline.”
Scorpius sat on one side of Narcissa, and Cass settled on the other.    Harry looked around the room for a moment, at all of these beautiful blonde people, and started to back away in the direction of the floo.  Narcissa caught the movement and said, “Harry, dear, you aren’t leaving, are you?  Scorpius has just told me that Cass is going to be his bone marrow donor.”
“There is a clinical trial using gene therapy available in the Muggle medical system.  We can submit Scorpius’ case for consideration, but these cross-discipline experimental therapies require some additional approvals from the Ministry, because of the Statute of Secrecy.  If he is a good candidate for the trial, we’d need the Magical-Muggle Relations Department to sign off and become involved.”
“He’s much more pleasant like this,” Harry said, and Draco admired his dimples as he grinned.  “That’s probably the nicest conversation I’ve ever had with your dad.  Probably the nicest one
Healer Mancini continued.  “With Scorpius, we need to remove some of his existing bone marrow first, in order to make room for the new.  In Muggle procedures, this is done a little differently, but in your case, we’ll be able to simply remove it with a spell.  Next, we’ll remove the bone marrow from Cass’ hip, using a special device.  We’ll use a similar one to insert the bone marrow into Scorpius.  Then, each of you will receive some healing spells, to ensure that there is no infection, and, for Scorpius, to encourage his body to recognize the foreign bone marrow.  When you each wake up, we’ll monitor you for a little while, to make sure you’re healing well, and then your parents can come back in and spend the rest of the day with you.  Tomorrow morning, assuming all goes well, you’ll each be able to go home.  Any questions?”
“Well, she shouldn’t be so interested in my blood,” Scorpius replied, a little imperiously.  “Can I be done?”
Harry listened patiently to Hermione’s lecture, and explanation of the incident that had led to his de-aging.  When, mercifully, she ran out of steam, Harry gave them both a look.  “You’re nutters,” he proclaimed.  It took several demonstrations of magic, a tour of the potions lab, and an examination of Draco’s wand before Harry was convinced.  Alarmingly, when handed Draco’s wand, Harry gave it a masterful flourish, and the ensuring sparks it emitted sent an entire rack of vials flying, causing Harry to let out a whimper, drop the wand and disappear under the table.
He pondered it a while longer, but it suddenly occurred to him that Hermione and Ron would have a much better understanding of Ginevra’s potential potion-making spots.  He knelt by the floo and called out, “Hermione and Ron Weasley’s house”.  The floo chimed, and Draco waited.  And waited.  Puzzled, Draco ended the call.  He knew that Ron and Hermione were home; It was the day of Harry’s last dose, and Hermione had told him to come see Harry, if he liked.  He made himself a cup of tea, and settled by the fire with a potions journal.  When he’d finished reading, and had drained the last of the tea, he tried again, and there was still no answer.   Something nagged, deep in his consciousness.  Draco prided himself on having very, very good instincts, when, that is, his mind wasn’t inventing terrible obsessions about how he was endangering people.  His canniness had allowed him to survive having Voldemort and his Death Eaters living in the Manor, and had kept him on the correct side of his Aunt Bella’s wand on more than a few occasions.  So, despite the fact that the logical part of his brain dismissed it as paranoia, Draco fretted.
“Not at all,” he replied evenly.  “Tams, I’m your friend.  I can’t imagine how hard this is for you, but I worry.”
“But how could I…” Harry looked at Hermione sharply.  “Wait.  What do you mean I had a hard time at school.  Do you mean bullying?  Do I get bullied?”
“Yeah, well, sometimes you meet people like that.  Anyway, Harry and I crossed paths again after my trial.”
“But marrying against my will, to someone I don’t love, who I’m not attracted to, it just seems wrong, Mother.  Doesn’t my happiness mean anything to you?”
The shop, after being closed for a week, does brisk business for all of the first day, and the morning of the second before it tapers off to usual traffic levels.  Draco is proud of the fact that he’s managed to keep his business alive, that he’s doing good work.  His Mother despairs of him, working in a shop like a commoner, but Draco likes it, and he’s more than grateful that he has something to distract him from his lingering upset at the scene in the shop the week before.  He resolutely doesn’t think of Ha-…Potter, except to reassure himself that it’s for the best.  He managed to stop things before they got out of hand.
They were quiet for a while, each of them thinking about their own lies and the way that they would inevitably change things.  “Honestly, we’re the worst,” Draco said miserably, after a while.
.  Harry had always been fine.  When he was walking around Hogwarts, chased by a madman, Draco remembered him telling his friends he was fine.  When, shortly after they had started dating, Andromeda had moved to France, taking Teddy with her, Harry had been fine.  When Draco had refused to go to the Burrow, Harry had been fine.  Harry was always fine, especially when he wasn’t fine at all.
When they reached the cozy little house, perched on the corner of a quiet street, surrounded by enormous Maple trees, Harry felt tension dissipate from his spine, like releasing a fist he hadn’t realized he was clenching.  Home.  He patted the front door lovingly as it unlocked at his touch.    Entering the spacious kitchen, as the lights flared to life, he noticed an owl sitting on the windowsill.  Cass clattered into the kitchen behind him, throwing her school bag into a corner, and immediately grabbing an apple from the bowl on the table. “Can you call for the pizza while I deal with this owl?” Harry asked.
“Yes, I’d noticed.  He was entertaining Potter by levitating Great Grandmother Malfoy’s china when I came upstairs.”
“Not Harry,” Hermione says.  “His egoistic wants are very simple, and he has little need for more of the depraved desires.  He just wants to live a simple life.”
“I don’t think I have to tell you that Cass is captivating, and I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t want to see her more.”
From that moment on, Harry had been protective of the information about how he was treated at home.  He had never told another person, until Tamsin, and he’d gotten very good at deflecting any probing questions, convincing everyone who asked that the Dursleys were suitable guardians, if possibly a bit distant.  He wondered what had been said to Scorpius previously.  He vowed to look up which member of his team had visited Scorpius on previous occasions, and made another promise to himself that Scorpius wouldn’t fall through any cracks.
“I’m very, very good at worrying about myself, Cass.  We’ve discussed this.  Plus, I have a meddling portrait and a very overprotective old lady who, apparently, is coming to visit.”  Harry’s eyes softened as he took her hand.  “You’re nine years old, my heart.  I want you to enjoy being a kid.  Adult worries will come along soon enough.”  He suddenly grinned, “Plus, you give terrible advice.”
Unexpected tears prickled the back of Draco’s throat.  He wanted to reassure Harry, to thank him for his kindness, but he could only blink hard, wordless.  Harry watched him closely, then reached out his hand.  “Draco?  Could we have some cocoa?”  Draco nodded, and Harry gave him an encouraging look, then took a few steps toward the stairs.  He turned back, to make sure that Draco was following him, and when he confirmed that he was, Harry’s smile was like a sunrise.
“I expect another half hour at most,” Cici said.  “They did very well, we’ll know that Scorpius is accepting the donor marrow by tonight.”
“What makes you say that?”  Papa looked away as he asked this, Cass noticed.  Like he was afraid what she’d see if she looked in his eyes.
Harry leapt to his feet to do as Draco said, but stopped in the doorway.  “Draco?  Will your mum be there?”
“Git,” I say fondly.  “It’s like everything I felt for you in school finally makes sense now.  And now that we’re not hexing one another, I can see my feelings for what they are.  I think it’s always been you, Draco.”
Draco stood, shocked by the bout of accidental magic. His temper and panic had gotten the best of him on countless occasions before, but he hadn’t performed accidental magic in years.  He raised his wand, about to spell the glass back into its expected shape, but then, with a growl of fury, his thoughts again turned to Harry, and turned back to the floo. He checked his watch.  It was nearly midnight.  Despite the late hour, he made his decision.  There was another momentary delay as he fought his fears, but ultimately, his concern for Harry’s safety won out, and in a flash of green flames, he stepped into the floo and spun away.  It was when he emerged into Ron and Hermione’s sitting room that he saw an enormous flash, felt a pain in his chest, and then Draco knew only darkness.
I’m glad that he doesn’t suggest going to his house.  I’ll make it up with Hermione, likely, if for no other reason than to avoid putting Ron in the centre of all of this, but not today.
Besides, to me, he's asking all the wrong questions.  Why are they so focused on whether someone is Dark or not?  People aren't entirely bad or good, and people do all sorts of different things, for all sort of reasons.  Do these lunatic wizards really put someone in one box or the other and decide that it makes them good or bad?  I don’t remember meeting the man, but surely Dumbledore, Light wizard that he was, has a fair bit to answer for.
“‘M fine,” Draco had whispered.  He sat on the couch, carefully, as though he might break, and Harry had felt another stab of concern that Draco was truly ill.  “Need to talk to you.”
“Do you want to sleep here?”  As he said the words, Harry seemed to freeze, as though he regretted them.
“Mommy?”  The voice inside the room was tiny, and Harry could hear that the child was scared.  “Is my punishment over?”
Harry smiled.  “Yes, it’s true.  Do you want to see something even cooler, though?”  He looked at Cass, and when she smiled and nodded, conjured a tiny green snake and placed it into her hand.  She smiled at the little creature, and began to hiss at it.  The snake became very alert, and nodded, and then hissed something back.
“Sometimes I feel all out of sorts,” Cass continued blithely, seemingly unconcerned that Scorpius was still crying.  “Sometimes I don’t even know what I need.  It’s okay though.  The feelings always go away, and then I can work to solve the problem.  One time, when I was little, I had a big fit about putting on my sweatshirt, and it made my Dad so confused.  He couldn’t understand why I wasn’t listening to him.  But when I calmed down and finally felt like I could talk to him, I was able to tell him that the sweatshirt had a scratchy tag, and we cut it out, and fixed the problem.”
“I-” Harry started, but they were interrupted by footfalls in the hallway, and the door being flung open.
Draco still wasn’t sure if he was being chastised or thanked.  “Yes.  He’s a Labrador.  He’ll get big enough to protect you, but he’ll be friendly as well.  If…if you want him, that is.”
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.  “Then, what is it?”  His voice was small.
The happenings of the night got a little more interesting after that point.  Draco drank, quite a bit, actually.  And Harry got absolutely pissed.  In surreal flashes, Draco witnessed Harry doing body shots off of Longbottom, to Hannah’s intoxicated delight.  He observed a procedure that required a funnel and a handstand.  And through it all, those accusing green eyes met his over the rim of stupid red plastic cups.  Draco prided himself on having developed an impressive alcohol tolerance over his four years playing hockey.  Canadian guys were excellent drinkers, it seemed, and Draco had learned the hard way that a scrawny British boy needed to keep up, or he’d find himself with one less eyebrow the following morning.
Harry decides to leave then, not willing to press his luck on what has, on balance, been better success than he could hope for.  He gives Draco a last hug, and makes his way to the floo, carefully avoiding Hermione’s tragically hopeful eyes as he does.
When we land, in Draco's library, I blink in surprise.  “How did that happen?”  Of all the things I feared might have been coming next, a slightly uncomfortable transportation to a safe place was not one of them.
“Hello, ma’am.  I’m afraid I’ve had some spell damage that’s affecting my memory, so I apologize if we’ve met before.”
“Auntie Min!  It’s so much bigger than I thought.  It’s beautiful!”  Harry remembered a boat, and a lake, and an enormous castle, lit up in the night sky.  He’d been so agog at every aspect of this new world he’d joined, but the Castle had immediately felt like coming home.  He looked at it now, and his heart swelled with nostalgia.  His first home.  The first place he’d felt, even slightly, like he belonged somewhere.
“Merlin,” A new, thin Weasley has appeared in the assembled collection.  He pushes his horn-rimmed glasses up his nose.  “Is that true, Harry?”
Some time later, I awaken in a completely different room.  I sit up, but as my brain tries to catalogue the memories that have been poured into my system, I flop backwards.
The Resident nodded, saying they’d need to fetch a Healer anyway, and Harry went into the Hallway.  His mobile wouldn’t work in the hospital, so he descended the stairs and exited to the street below.  He quickly dialled the number and waited.  “Draco Malfoy.” The voice was crisp, businesslike.
“Go fetch me the supplies he’ll need, and then be quick about your errands.  I’ll need your help with him if I’m to figure out how to cure him.”
A knock at my door interrupts my unproductive thoughts, and I say, “Yeah?”  I don’t think that Draco would allow Hermione to intrude on my space here.  My faith is confirmed when Draco enters.  He looks exhausted.  “Draco.”
“Of course you will,” she replied, her voice utterly sure, as though Harry had told her that water was wet, or that the stars came out at night.  Comforted, she bounced back into the living room, and Harry could hear her enlisting Minerva and Severus’ help with convincing Harry to let them have a dog.
In the dim light, Draco could see movement as Harry shook his head.  Finally, though, he said, “Draco?”
, his mind echoed), he cast a set of extra wards on his lab, his floo, the chair that the Aurors would use.  Straightening his shoulders, he got to work.  When his floo chimed with the first Auror, Draco was just finishing the cleaning process from the blood-thickening potion.  He waved his wand, opening the floo, and said, “Good afternoon, Auror Pritchard, please use some of the hand-sanitizing potion and have a seat in the chair.  I’ll be with you in a moment.”  He hadn’t completed the cleaning spell exactly correctly, so he did it again.  And once more, to be sure.
“Listen, if this is about your sister, I told you, I’m really sorry, but I just can’t be with her.  I’m sure that Jenny is a-”
“He’s a superhero,” Scorpius said solemnly, and Draco exchanged an embarrassed look with Harry, who grinned.
Cass shrugged.  “After Dad moved to Canada, but before I was born, the portrait was delivered one day.  Uncle Professor insisted on having himself shipped to be with us.  He told Auntie Min that he wasn’t about to see another Potter child left to the mercies of the world.”
member of the press in Great Britain?  What could have been a page 3 public interest story is now going to be talked about for months.  Months, Potter.”
“Tell that to Lavender,” Hermione bites out.  “Or Fred, or Remus…or Vincent, who didn’t get a chance to cope at all.”
Scorpius regarded him a little balefully.  “Yes, Papa, we’re going to see the Vampire, and then you’ll get me a new book, but only if I’m good, and only if I don’t cry.”
Draco’s stomach churns, and he feels a drop of cold sweat trickle down his temple.  He allows himself, just for a second, to imagine his life, as it is now, with no Potter.  No tousle-haired menace, dropping by with a sweet, or a book he thought Draco might like.  No invitations to go flying.  No more green eyes watching him closely.  No more pub nights, where Harry would oh-so-casually manipulate the people sitting next to Draco so that he could take their place.  No more owls in the middle of the night reminding Draco to ‘drink a glass of water, proper hydration is very important’.  No more
Draco had a bad night.  The stress of the next day’s potion administration kept him from falling asleep, and each of his intrusive thoughts fed upon the previous one.  Draco was left shuddering from visions of terrible things happening to Harry at his hand.  Lara had been right, he realized.  He was in no shape to be taking care of Harry.  He’d been so foolish to lie to Harry about their relationship, and when Harry remembered, he’d be
“We’ll see,” Draco soothed.   The potions that Scorpius had taken at St. Mungo’s took effect quickly, and he started to droop over his hot chocolate.  “I’ll just take him to his bedroom, if you don’t mind waiting a moment?”
Hermione laughed.  “Oh those sardines.  I don’t think I’ve eaten fish of any sort since then.  But that’s a good observation, about your Dad’s stories.  He tells the stories, and leaves out the context, the impact.  It’s always been that way.  Your dad didn’t have an easy time while he lived in England, quite the opposite, really.  Even still, I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve seen him cry, in all the years I’ve known him.  I think that Harry has a lot of loss and pain that he has been suppressing.  I don’t think it’s a bad thing that he’s working through them.”
“Oh my god, Harry, this isn’t funny.  He was a Death Eater!  He let other Death Eaters into the school.  His Dad was Voldemort’s favourite crony!”
Defeated, Draco climbed the stairs, and found Kreacher and Harry in the kitchen.  Kreacher was happily preparing food and chattering away in his gravelly voice.  Harry was babbling back to Kreacher, his voice resembling a dolphin.  None of these things were unexpected, but Draco was truly surprised to hear a third voice.  “Good evening, my Dragon.  Perhaps you might like to tell me why you have a baby who looks remarkably like Harry Potter in your kitchen?”
“But what about the postcard?” Lara asked.  “Now that you have a little distance from the event, I wondered if you’d considered what it meant.”
Draco found a spare pair of skates, and knelt at Harry’s feet.  He removed Harry’s trainers and shoved his socked foot into the first skate.  His eyes flicked up to Harry’s to check his comfort, and for a moment, he was remembering.  Green eyes, pupils dilated with lust as Draco nestled between Harry’s legs, taking Harry’s cock into his mouth.  For a moment, Draco’s eyes lingered on Harry’s crotch, then he stopped himself, and remembered.  Harry wasn’t his anymore.  Draco breathed.  Waited until his thumping heart had reached a reasonable pace again, and then said, “The fit okay?”
