‘Study,’
Draco held out his hand;
Draco sighed and wrapped his arm around the smaller boy’s shoulders pulling him tightly to his side. ‘All my life I have heard tales about the Grim, the symbol of death, personally I feel like it was just a story made up to make young children behave. As far as I know there has never actually been a confirmed sighting of a real life Grim.
‘Wanna see what Mrs Weasley sent me?’ Harry said with a devious twinkle in his eye.
......
Harry looked at Draco, the boy’s face was beautiful especially as it was, lit up by the moonlight streaming through the high windows. How on earth did the Slytherin think that he could even begin to prefer Ginny’s company to his own, the boy was obviously mental.  The only flaw that Harry could see in their friendship  was that he liked boys and Draco did not, but they could still be the best of friends, Harry could do that, especially for moments like this.
‘Weasley watch out, invisible spider.’
‘Come on Draco, what has gotten in to you?’
Ron leaned forward so his head was between Harry and Draco’s, he examined the sink carefully, he raised his eyebrows as a sudden thought struck him; ‘Try parseltounge Harry.’ Harry looked at him incredulously, ‘It’s a snake, give it a go mate,’ Harry turned and looked from his best friend to his boyfriend, Draco shrugged, ‘It’s worth a go.’
‘Can I see?’ asked Draco wiggling his legs to regain some of the feeling they had lost from being Harry’s seat for so long.
‘I know,’ said Harry quietly, ‘ It’s just difficult, but I am looking forward to Christmas though , just the six of us, it will be kind of nice although I’m sure it may be a little strained .’
‘Hey’
Harry caught Neville’s eye a second before they both looked over to where Ron’s bed stood empty. The glaring orange blanket untouched as Ron’s heroics had landed him an overnight stay in the hospital wing. Thinking back over the past few months, certain moments stood out, clear as day, looks exchanged, sudden and unexplained blushing. Then there was yesterday, the look in Ron’s eyes as the Hippogriff had reared towards Pansy, the fear and protection he saw there was something he understood all too well, he had seen the look in Draco’s eyes, directed at himself,  on more than one occasion.
Neville sniffled and nodded, burying himself furthur in to Blaise.
‘Listen mate are you sure about this, I mean are you sure you have not been cursed or something, I mean I’m sure Hermione will check one last time.’
Draco was saved from doing something ridiculously embarrassing like hugging Longbottom when Harry ran at his house mate and pulled him in to a tight embrace. Draco had mocked Blaise on first hearing about his friendship with the bumbling Gryffindor but tonight had proven that Blaise’s instincts were not misplaced. The boy was a Gryffindor for a reason and he could see that Harry and Blaise had a true and loyal friend in him. Draco looked up at his own house mate and caught a glint of something in his eye as he watched Longbottom whispering with Harry, well that was interesting and unexpected, especially after all the Pansy kissing, he obviously had much more in common with his Italian friend then he had originally thought, he chuckled as he imagined Pansy’s reaction, she was going to love this new development. Blaise raised an eyebrow at his chuckle and they both turned back to look at their respective Gryffindors who were now deep in conversation about the pieces of parchment whilst occasionally casting glances towards their Slytherin counterparts. It was one of these glances that reminded Draco why they were all here in the first place as he caught sight of Harry’s bruise once more and grimaced, the Weasel was going to pay, there would be no doubt about that, he caught Blaise’s eye, some serious plotting needed to take place, this would not be forgotten.
‘Yes Father?’
Harry wanted to retort but noticed that Malfoy’s comment had none of its usual bite, ‘he likes it,’ he replied with a shrug.
Draco had failed to find Harry so trudged to the library looking for Granger. He knew that this was his best chance to find her and he was not disappointed. The bushy haired Gryffindor was at a table, almost hidden, at the very back of the library, he almost had not seen her, the pile in books in front of her was so tall that he could just about see the top of her head.
Draco had said nothing. He was stood watching the exchange  with interest, he stood slightly back from the group, arms folded across his chest, eyebrow raised. He had helped for Harry, there was no other reason, although, he admitted begrudgingly, he didn’t mind helping Hermione as much as he had imagined he would. As he watched the half-giant crumble in front of him and the two Gryffindor’s failing to comfort him he felt a tug deep down in the depths of his body. It made him feel uncomfortable that Hagrid’s pain bothered him, but he stayed quiet, preferring to keep that to himself lest he be seen as being weak. However he happened to look over at Harry who was struggling to comfort Hagrid, Draco could see the pain in Harry’s eyes  as he tried to make his larger than life friend see sense. That did it:
‘No joke I’m afraid.’ Harry smiled sheepishly. ‘So?’
Harry looked at the red-head and saw confusion etched all over his face.
‘Shut the fuck up Malfoy!’ Came a voice grumbling  out of the darkness.
Draco saw the pain in Harry’s eyes, he hated that so much, he fought against his upbringing, he needed to let Harry see some weakness, he had the power to take away the pain; ‘Harry just so you know was probably my best Christmas too, I’m going to stay, Dobby can wait.’
At this Harry’s blood began to boil, ‘He’s my friend Hermione, ‘ he snapped ‘ he’s not like that really, it’s ... well it’s complicated.’
‘Yep, even a toilet at one point.’ Neville said with a blush rising in his cheeks.
The two boys sat in silence for what seemed like an eternity. The silence was comfortable and neither felt the need to break it. The room grew warm around them as they each contemplated what their next move might be.
‘Please Harry,’ she replied, watching him walk away with a sigh.
Pansy immediately perked up at this, ‘ooooh sounds fun,’ she said gleefully as she followed the boys out of the hall.
Pansy had the grace to look at least slightly abashed and nodded her head sharply in their direction. ‘Sorry Longbottom it’s just shocking you know, I had no idea it was here.’
A vague flutter of hope attempted to claw its way up inside Draco’s chest but he vengefully battered it back down, ‘Careful Potter whatever will your girlfriend think?’ Draco had to admit to himself that the startled look on Potter’s face was not what he was expecting.
‘Thank you,’ he said
Draco never realised his pale skin could turn such a violent shade of red until that moment. Of course, the compliment was nothing new to him and he had heard it many times before and quite frankly he agreed whole heartedly with the sentiment but, it was something else completely hearing from Harry. Everything that Harry was saying was catching him completely off guard today, he desperately needed to regain some composure. With a little cough he straightened his spine and, in his haughtiest tone, replied, “well, obviously.”
‘How’s Harry?’ Draco asked as soon as the door was closed behind them.
‘Harry you absolute idiot.’
‘What...’ started Draco
‘Sure,’ said Draco as he moved out of the way.
‘Detention Mr Weasley for distracting the class, I would not even expect this sort of exhibitionism from those brothers of yours, please kindly replace your clothing and refrain from distracting my class anymore.’
It had been three days, Ron had reappeared on the second day and had been received as a hero. Draco still had not eaten and was currently sat at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall being berated by Pansy Parkinson for this.  She was loudly saying that she was going to simply have to write to his Mother if he continued on his mission to starve himself to death. This caused Draco to do something most un-Slytherin like, he stabbed his fork in to the food in front of him and staring at Pansy, shoved the food in to his mouth and began to chew, she smirked satisfactorily at him and turned back to her own dinner. As happened every meal time Draco’s eyes began to rake the Great Hall and gravitated over to the Gryffindor table, today he net the brown eyes of Hermione who was staring right at him, when their eyes met she turned to Ron and said loudly, ‘ I am off to the library, come and find me when you have finished here and we can go back to the Hospital wing.’ Ron grunted in reply and Hermione slowly stood and turned back to Draco, as she met Draco’s eyes once more she inclined her head slightly towards the door.
Ron pulled on his trousers after giving them another vigorous shake and dared to glance around at his class mates, it was obvious that they were all wanting to laugh and only their stern teacher was preventing them. Ron felt the heat flare in his cheeks as their colour rivalled that of his hair, he was never going to live this down, at least he had decided against his Willy the Whizz boxers at the last minute.
Hermione rolled her eyes, ‘Malfoy is not the heir of Slytherin Ronald.’ Ron’s jaw dropped: ‘ You too, has he cursed you both?’
The dwarf finished his song and climbed off Harry whose stuff was still spread all over the floor. Without thinking Draco bent to help him pick something up. Draco looked at what he was holding in his hand it was a diary of some sort, he didn’t know Harry kept a diary, he was a little offended he didn’t know about it and wondered if he featured in it anywhere.
‘I guess.’
No there was not one Gryffindor that would speak to him, he had hurt Lavender and Hermione just a few weeks after hurting Harry and clearly had made a complete show of himself, thoroughly embarrassing his family members, Percy could not even look at him after hearing that he was pant less in front of Professor McGonagol. As Ron sat down to dinner people physically moved away from him, Ron ate quickly and stormed from the Great Hall not noticing the group of Slytherin’s that got up to follow him.
Harry froze at Draco’s words, he pulled himself up out of Draco’s embrace to turn and stare at the blond, ‘You never said.’ There was a hint of sadness in his tone that Draco couldn’t quite work out. He shrugged at Harry, ‘I thought you knew, it doesn’t matter does it?’
‘What on earth is wrong with you?’
Draco looked in to Harry’s eyes, ‘Harry, I love it, the eyes? How?’
Harry  had had a brilliant day, the sun was shining and he felt ridiculously happy with the way his life was at the moment. He had managed to put the issued that the school was facing and the diary to the back of his mind as he wandered back from Quidditch in the warm autumn sun. He was just walking back towards the castle when he felt his parchment vibrate, the pattern to mark a four way conversation repeated again and again, each time seemingly with more urgency as he hurriedly tried to remove the parchment from where it was hidden in the fold of his robe.   As he had not yet seen any of the conversation the parchment was filled from top to bottom in the hurried conversation of his friends and boyfriend, the first handwriting at the top of the page was Neville’s untidy scrawl;
When the voices had retreated in to the distance, Harry turned to Draco and tilted his head up kissing him on the lips again for the briefest moment.
Later that evening Harry retreated to his room to begin pretending that he was not there and only just managed not to shout out in surprise at what was waiting for him there.
‘Well I believe you then,’ Draco said matter of factly, ‘Do you think Lockheart was lying about not hearing it?’
Just a thankyou for all my Kudos and comments :D very much appreciated
Firenze dipped his front legs so that the two boys could climb on, Draco helped Harry on before climbing on behind him and wrapping his hands around the boys waist.  As Firenze walked back through the forest he slowly began answering the questions that the two boys were asking him about the hooded figure and why it had been drinking unicorn blood. Harry could not help but gasp when he heard the properties of unicorn blood and the link that it had with the Philosopher’s stone that lay within the protection of the castle. He wondered aloud who would do such a monstrous thing and risk being cursed forever.
......
‘Well I will just have to go alone.’ Harry stated with a determined look on his face folding his arms stubbornly across his chest.
The walk to the Room of Requirement had never felt so long. It had probably only been about half an hour since Draco had left his dorm, but it felt like hours to Harry and he was in a desperate rush to get to Draco and explain what had happened to him.
Harry leaned forward slightly, ‘Have you and Ron, you know?’
Harry looked up in to his first friend’s blue eyes and smiled, ‘I know Ron but you don’t understand why he did it, his issue is with himself not me.’
Harry wiggled their hands a bit in case Draco had not seen them, ‘You know, this, holding hands with a known puff, do you not worry I’ll take it the wrong way and throw myself at you.’
‘HARRY POTTER!! ‘
The tiny teacher handed the slips of parchment out in silence, each student quietly thanked him as they took the timetables and began to study them intensely. Harry removed his hand from Draco’s leg to collect is timetable and immediately began pouring over it, without a word timetables were swapped and compared, there were a few raised eyebrows and the odd mutter but they remained relatively silent whilst they  looked at each other’s timetables. Draco looked up from the one he held, Ron’s, and noted with interest Finnegan handing his silently to Blaise and Blaise placing it side by side with his own quietly examining and comparing while Seamus watched with a small smile. Draco felt a pang of jealously as he watched, what he was seeing was obviously the start of something between his best friend and the small Gryffindor in front of him, Draco envied them, they had something to look forward to, something fun and perhaps something even more after everything they had been through, he was happy for the two, as he was for all the couples around him but he couldn’t help the sad pang of realisation that he could never have that. He handed Ron’s timetable to Hermione so she could compare, as he did he noticed Harry next to him studiously comparing two timetables, the pang deepened in strength, Draco tore his eyes away and stole a glance around the table, he wondered which of his fellow 8
Draco’s fists clenched involuntarily crumpling the parchment he was holding, he was still working on his revenge plot for Weasley but now it was clear that he would need to step it up a notch.
This chapter is dedicated to High functioning Fangirl in the hopes it breaks her curse :)
‘Love you, present tense,’
The comment, coupled with the tremor in Harry’s voice made Neville raise an inquisitive brow. He placed the shears down on the window ledge and turned to face his friend whilst he walked his hands on the seat of his trousers. ‘ Sure’ he said, looking at Harry with concern as he closed the gap between them, ‘what’s wrong?’ As Neville watched a pink tinge crept slowly up Harry’s neck, Neville was shocked to realise that Harry was blushing.
‘Ha you will never guess.’
‘Tarantellegra.’
This might be easier than I thought, thought Draco as a smile spread across his face.
‘Okay,’ he conceded ‘I’ll tell him.’
‘I’ll do it, if you study.’ Draco said.
Before Harry could even think of a suitable response a loud guffaw sounded from the direction of Neville’s bed. Harry looked on in askance as Neville started to cry from laughing. Neville caught him looking and tried to control his laughter enough to explain himself, ‘Blaise…. Draco….. hair…. Bubble-gum pink.’ The sentence, although completely incoherent, made enough sense to Harry to figure out what had happened. He had to laugh at the thought of his boyfriend with bright pink hair and he could certainly picture the boy’s face right now a cross between rage and complete disbelief, alook that Harry thought looked rather good on him. The parchment vibrated once more as Blaise’s neat scrawl filled the page;
‘Because you are?’
Draco smiled as he pushed the parchment back under his pillow, it had been a good day all round and he had some funny memories of Weasle to keep him going for a while.
As Hagrid led the Hippogriff over by his chain, Draco literally had to bite his tongue in order to stop himself shouting out. Seeing the creature so close to Harry was giving him palpitations. What in Merlin’s  name made his volunteer? Draco was sure it was out of some misguided affection for the half-giant.
‘Mornin’
Draco was in his bed in the dungeon, but yet again sleep evaded him. He was lay on his back with his fingers laced behind his head thinking back over what had happened that night. That bloody dog had terrified him but his instinct had been to protect Harry, without thinking he had put himself between the small boy and harm’s way, ‘What the fuck was that about?’ He’d never put anyone else first in his whole life, what is it about Harry bloody Potter?
Just then Professor Flitwick appeared, Harry tried not to laugh at the look of horror on Draco’s  face when Professor Flitwick’s eye fell on Harry’s broom. ‘Yes,yes that’s right,’ said the Professor, ‘What model is it?’
‘Well, the thing about Charlie is, well...’
Blaise looked down at the blushing boy in front of him, he had no idea what came over him, but at the sight of the clumsy boy on his knees in front of him blushing, looking all sweet and innocent and before he had had time to think about what he was doing, he had offered the small boy a hand to get up.
Professor Flitwick burst into tears.
The eyebrow was raised once more
‘I’d love to give up Potions.’ Harry said with a sigh, ‘I know I can’t though Ron told me we have to keep all our old subjects.’ Harry sighed and slumped further in to Draco’s side. He felt Draco’s arm tighten around him, ‘You’ll survive Harry, Snape doesn’t hate you as much as you seem to think he does.’
......
Draco glanced up at Blaise who shrugged.
Harry had almost forgotten, in light of everything else, why had brought him here originally. He smiled to himself remembering. He had heeded Hermione’s warnings about being careful what he said to people about it. But he knew he didn’t have to worry with these two. He knew that, whatever their own experiences with the soul-song, they would be nothing but happy and excited for him. He sat back in the chair and took a breath, ‘Apparently I’ve found my soul-song.’
‘So what’s truth and dare?’ Draco asked his boyfriend.
Draco was furious, who was this now? This new influx of first years were obviously going to be nothing but trouble for him, Harry was his, he couldn’t bare it, people should know,  people needed to know, he gritted his teeth and ground them in an undignified way, he hated his father, if it wasn’t for him then he could let people know exactly what would happen to them if they looked at his Harry that way, he glared at the tiny Gryffindor and tuned out the bickering around him as he thought of lots of very painful ways to torture the small boy. Harry looked at Draco and saw the anger in his eyes , but he was not even listening to Ron spluttering about the unfairness of it all, he was glaring at an oblivious Colin, what was all that about? He would have to ask later? Harry looked around him again, Fred and George were dragging Oliver back to the locker rooms and Hermione was man-handling Ron towards the castle. Harry turned to offer Draco a small smile and the Slytherin winked at him causing a warm feeling to flood the pit of Harry’s stomach.
‘Have you finally lost your mind?’ she hissed once more, grabbing Draco by the shoulder, she opened her mouth as if to speak again but words failed her as a door seemed to grow from the floor in front of her.
birthday, he had known the Dursley’s would forget he would have put money on it, but his friends, Draco? He just didn’t understand, had he done something wrong?
Ron thought hard about what he was about to do. After the incident in Care of Magical Creatures people had made all sorts of guesses and assumptions as to why he did what he did, these ranged from him thinking it was Harry ( this had not been Harry's favourite) and the scarily close to the truth one that he was cheating on Hermione with Pansy.
‘I really did die that night, that night you all thought me dead but one of the things that brought me back, that made the decision easy was the thought of seeing you again, ‘
‘Yeah,’ Harry agreed , ‘It’s our own bloody fault, don’t worry, and at least we got detention with you.’
Harry considered for a moment, ‘Sure I mean it does sound safer that way, it might work but it is still risky. Would you be willing to risk that to flirt with me?”
Warning: Very OOC Snape. I'd like to think love and family mellowed him quite a bit, well behind closed doors anyway.
Harry turned to faced his red-haired best friend, ‘Ron it’s been six years coming, a war couldn’t change my mind, in fact it just made me see things clearly.’
‘What in Morganna’s name are you playing at?’
Draco entered the hall just behind Harry and smiled when he saw the look on his friends face, as he walked past Draco shoved Harry with his shoulder, hoping it wasn’t too hard and strode over to his table while two idiotic Slytherin girls giggled behind him.
‘Blimey,’ muttered Ron.
Draco sat with his fellow 8
Draco was just about to hand the diary back over dismissing it as rubbish when he noticed something that made his heart drop in to his stomach. Ginny Weasley was staring at the diary he held in his hand, her gaze occasionally flicking back to Harry and she looked absolutely terrified. Draco felt sick, he didn’t know what to think, in his hand he held a diary that he knew nothing about, a secret Harry had kept from him, something that possibly contained Harry’s inner most thoughts and feelings and the She Weasel was looking at it with absolute fear in her eyes. She looked as though she was terrified that a massive secret was about to be revealed, a secret to do with the diary, Harry’s diary. Draco looked at the diary in his hand, it felt heavy all of a sudden like it had suddenly turned to lead. He glanced at Ginny who, in turn was looking at Harry, he bristled internally and turned to look at his boyfriend who was now standing staring expectantly at him, hand out waiting for the diary. Draco caught Harry’s eye and noticed the slight fear in those too. Draco felt sick, it was obvious Harry was hiding something, something that the She Weasel knew all about, he had trusted Harry, more than anyone ever and it looked as though the She Weasel had managed to steal him. He desperately wanted to read the diary, to read what these two so obviously wanted to hide from him. He needed to see it with his own eyes, see the betrayal in black and white.
......
Neville gave a small smile, ‘So I was trying to find a place to hide and I ran into this deserted corridor and began to panic.’ At this Blaise gave the smaller boy a gentle squeeze and was rewarded with a smile from Neville. ‘ Anyway I was panicking at this point running backwards and forwards thinking that I just needed to find somewhere to hide and all of a sudden a door appeared before me, before I could think about it I heard voices so ran through the door, it locked behind me and there was a chair for me to sit, I stayed there a while and began to wonder where the room came from and why, and could I do it again, so I tried a few more things and the room appeared and became whatever I required , hence the name.’
‘I’ve done this all day with Hermione,’
‘I know mate but what if it doesn’t work out?’
Draco stood with is mouth hanging open as the large black snake dropped to the floor in front of Finch-Fletchly mouth open, fangs bared, ready to attack.  Then he saw Harry move, what was he doing? Idiot, get back he wanted to shout, do you want to be attacked? What happened next stopped Draco doing anything stupid like throwing himself between Harry and the snake.  Harry opened his mouth and the strangest sounds emerged, the air around them became thick with hisses, the words curling from Harry’s tongue and around his lips, slithering out in to the room before him, wrapping like long tendrils around each and every occupant. Draco was mesmerised, the sounds coming from his friends mouth rendered him unable to move as though hit with a curse,  he couldn’t stop staring, mouth hanging slightly open as the world seemed to slow down around him. There was something about Harry in that moment that wanted to pull Draco towards him like a magnet, the sounds that escaped Harry’s lips wrapped around him like soft caresses. Draco felt safe, secure and oddly warm, he felt a flush creeping up his body as he watched his friend take control of the snake before him, he oozed power and confidence like Draco had never seen in him before, it suited him and Draco knew he would give anything to see again. Draco closed his eyes and let the soft sibilant hisses wash over him, but, before he knew it, it was over as quickly as it had began.
‘What’s up mate?’
Draco watched Hermione’s eyes grow wide.
Draco turned his head and glared at her, he pushed himself up in to a sitting position and swung his legs off the bed, ‘I am a Malfoy, I am not adorable,’ he pouted.
‘Does it hurt?’
Draco stood, elbows resting on the rail in front of him, trying to affect an air of indifference as his eyes roamed over the crowd below him, he knew he was searching for a messy, raven haired Gryffindor. His father had run in to an acquaintance and once again Draco had been left to his own devices, he was sulking slightly but would never admit it. He hid a smile as he spotted the familiar boy in the crowds waiting to meet the bloody fame hungry Lockheart. A frown crossed Draco’s face as a familiar red tinge appeared on Harry’s face, he quickly followed his gaze. Draco’s eyes narrowed dangerously  as he realised who it was that had caught Harry’s undivided attention in this way, that bloody idiot Lockheart, Harry was blushing at Lockheart. Draco felt a knot in the pit of his stomach as a feeling unlike anything he had ever felt before appeared from deep inside him. He was so inexplicably angry, his eyes flashed as he balled his fists. His eyes rested, once again, on the Gryffindor as he saw Harry pass his tongue over his lips, eyes never leaving Lockheart’s face. Draco felt a rage build up inside him and he wanted to scream. What the hell was Harry playing at , and why was it bothering him so much, before another thought could cross his mind a strong hand clamped down on his shoulder, ‘Draco , are we ready?’
‘I hate to say it Dray but apparently he has Potter.’
years in the Great Hall. They had a special table of their own due to the house tables being full from the new intake and the already existing student body, it seemed to work, the 8
‘Draco, I love it,’ Harry said as he jumped up, wrapping his arms around the Slytherin’s neck and knocking him down onto the bed, ‘umpf’ was the noise Draco made as he had the wind knocked out of him. Harry laughed and braced himself on his arms to allow Draco to breathe. Draco looked up in to smiling eyes, ‘Well I’m glad you like it.’
‘Happy 34
......
.....
......
Hermione looked a little flustered at Blaise’s confession but decided to move on with the game and cleared her throat, ‘so Blaise, your turn.’
Suddenly Harry stood up straight from where he had been organising his trunk, ‘guys, it’s missing, Riddle’s diary is missing.’
‘Ok, I get it, so how do you know if they really are being honest?’ Draco asked genuinely curious, he looked around at the three other pureblood wizards in the room and could see the look reflected back at him. Hermione spoke up, ‘That is where I come in, I am going to cast a charm I looked at over the summer, a lie detector, if you lie your hair turns bright pink with green spots.’
......
‘Draco I could hug you,’
Draco found the parcel with ease this time, barely hidden amongst the grass at the bottom of the tree, he removed the parchment that wished him happy birthday and opened the box eagerly. Draco’s eyes grew wide as they fell upon the contents of the box, unbelieving of what he was seeing. The box contained a very expensive drawing set filled with pencils and charcoals and wax crayons of all different colours and shades, Draco tenderly drew his finger across them looking at them in awe. The set was beautiful, he had never owned anything like this before he was already picturing the things that he could draw, the shading and lines he could achieve. How did the gift giver know? He located and unfolded the parchment:
‘I’m sorry.’
Draco looked surprised for a second  before he blinked and said, ‘Yes, yes you got it.’
Harry nodded, ‘yes please, I mean if it’s ok.’ Draco pulled his legs down and stood, he stepped over one of Harry’s feet placing himself between them and standing with his back to the wall that housed the camera, Harry swallowed hard at the sight before him, even actually whimpering as Draco began to unbutton his shirt. He felt his mouth run dry as he watched wondering whether or not he had somehow pushed Draco in t this; ‘Draco, you don’t have to.’ The Gryffindor was mortified at the dry husk masquerading as his voice as firmly pursed his lips together as though to prevent it escaping and embarrassing him anymore. Draco, who had been looking down at his buttons raised his eyes and smirked as he looked at Harry through his fringe, he felt brave thanks to the Firewhiskey still humming in his veins, he finished unbuttoning his shirt and pulled it from his waistband, taking care to do this slowly and deliberately never taking his eyes from Harry’s as he did so, relishing the sight of those green eyes darkening and nearly groaning as the tip of Harry’s tongue poked out to moisten his plump bottom lip.
Draco vowed he was going to get Harry for this as he doubled over as the full force of the tickles hit him. Harry knew full well how ticklish he was, how Slytherin of him to use it to his advantage. Draco wouldn’t admit it out loud be he was a little proud of Harry for exploiting his knowledge and using Draco’s weakness to his advantage, although he now wanted him to suffer, well not suffer but he needed to get him back. Draco searched his mind for something he could use against Harry without hurting him, he found the information he needed and a slow smirk appeared across his face;
It was all Pansy could do to not barge in and hex them both to oblivion. Her Draco was heartbroken and not with the boy he loved because of a stupid bet,   she stopped herself at the last minute, she needed to find Draco.
‘Nah, don’t worry, you’ll still get to see me around,’ Harry replied with a twinkle in his eye.
‘Good morning Harry, how did you sleep?’ asked Draco, unable to keep a huge grin from his face.
‘Erm... she knows,’
Ron nodded solemly still holding the other boys hand, 'How did you know what to do?' asked Draco, unable to hold back the question any longer. He had been dying to know but had held back from asking when Ron was concentrating on Blaise, Ron turned to the blond with a small smile, 'Being one of seven, six boys and one Ginny, you get in to some scrapes, there are only so many times that you can come home injured before you start learning to fix them.' Draco smiled and sent a small nod in Ron's direction, wondering what on earth it was that large families got up to that led children to teach themselves healing spells.
Draco huffed and hurled a pillow at him before wrapping his arms across his chest in a petulant manner. Harry couldn’t help it, he launched himself at Draco, pinning him to the bed tickling him all over, vaguely he registered Blaise saying, ‘Well looks like that’s decided, what should we do now?’
‘What time is it?’
‘What’s going on?’ asked Professor McGonagall.
‘I’ll kill him,’ he sneered, ‘Harry’s devastated.’
Soft murmurs could be heard all around as Draco settled back in one of his favourite leather wing-backed chairs stretching his long legs before him. Draco leaned back, slowly tilting his head from side to side and smiling at each satisfying pop of his neck. He bought his long fingers up to his throat to open his collar button and loosen his tie when the common room door slid open illuminating the foreboding figure of his godfather as he stepped in to the room, the billowing of his cloak around his ankles the only sign that he had been in a rush to arrive. Sharp eyes surveyed the room as Draco took in the man's appearance, to an untrained eye he looked perfectly at ease, however Draco spotted the tell-tale pinking of his cheeks that showed the older man was rattled.
‘I’m going out,’ announced Draco, ‘Do not bother me.’ He commanded, with an air that dared anyone to try, and with that, he strode out of the common room taking care to hold the door open that extra bit longer.
Just then Draco spotted something glittering in the grass just in front of him. He scooped to pick it up hoping no one saw him, he now had a reason to speak to Harry so he could hand the ball over later ... ‘Look’ said Pansy, ‘It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.
‘What... when?’
Draco was sat up in his bed in the Slytherin dungeons, he was exhausted but try as he might he could not sleep, his mind was in turmoil. For a twelve year old boy he was so confused, he did not know what was going on and why he was feeling the way he was, all he knew was that it was Harry bloody Potter’s fault. Draco tried to be angry he really did but he just couldn’t. He didn’t for the life of him know why. Was he losing his edge?
‘Why?’
‘Harry,’ Ron spluttered, ‘You did that for Harry, why?’
No more excuses.
A hooded figure came crawling along the ground towards the unicorn like a hunter stalking its prey. The boys stood in a trance as the figure bent over the unicorn and began to drink its blood. Instinctively Draco dragged Harry behind him just as the boy was knocked to the ground by the searing pain that was slicing through his head.  The hooded figure raised his head and looked straight at Harry.
‘But what if it doesn’t come, what if he ignores it or throws it away?’ Harry whined from across the table where he was sat in his usual spot staring at the platinum haired Slytherin, across the hall. As he looked the post arrived, Harry began to worry his bottom lip, there was so many ways that this could go wrong, he watched and waited.
‘Well, you have to walk past the space where the door is three times thinking clearly about what you require from it and then it appears.’
‘Yeah look at the fire in its eyes, you know it looks like it could defeat a dark lord once or twice you know.’
The House Elves had delivered breakfast at some point before they woke and now they sat in relative silence, even Ron only picking at the food in front of him. A decision to speak to McGonagall had been made but they knew they couldn’t be seen together so the Slytherin’s were going to take the cloak and head down to speak to Myrtle and the Gryffindor’s would go to the staff room to find their head of house and tell her what they knew.
Harry climbed in to his bed that night and folded his arms behind his head, crossing his legs at the ankles. He assumed that all the other boys were asleep and could hear soft snores coming from Neville’s bed, he had about an hour before he had to leave to meet Draco and he knew it was going to be a long wait. Harry closed his eyes and thought back over the summer that he had just suffered through, he had spent a lot of time alone which had given him plenty of time to think. He had changed physically over summer, not so much that it was too obvious but he had noticed. Harry had also noticed he was thinking about things differently and certainly dreaming about certain things that he had never dreamt of before, these thoughts, and the dreams that accompanied them were forever on his mind. At first Harry had tried to bury them, knowing, even at his young age that they were not quite what they should be but, eventually he had realised there was no burying them. He had been confused, wondering what they could mean, but then, Lockheart, Harry had felt the heat rising just watching the man, Harry had understood right then and there, there was something different about him.
Draco couldn’t help himself. “I bet he fell down the stairs and landed on a vase.”
“I saw you in the hallway, last week.”
“He as verbose as you?”
The two boys walked into the room with bored looking eyes and dragging feet.
Everington was quiet as Harry counted the day’s until he could dance again. Amos had forbidden any ‘stomping around’ inside their house and life had become pretty quiet.
Malfoy grumbled. “Again.
Mcgonagall stood next to Snape with a rolled in white board beside them. Three circles were drawn on the board with words inside. The first circle had four words.
One of the men leaned him forward to check his spine. Harry shivered as the man put pressure on each bump.
She rubs her temple. “You don’t
Potter seemed to look over Draco before speaking up. “What are you singing?”
of no use.”
There was in fact a reason Harry had made his way into the isolated section of the school, even though the feeling of doing so was a large bonus. Harry knew there were a select few landlines scattered around and he’d been itching to call—well just about
Harry didn’t recognise nor care about the girls who were called out. He just sat there wondering where he would go. He knew logically he would most likely be in the larger class as there would only be around five boys out of the nineteen in the small one.
think it’s ‘cause he drinks too much and they sleep in separate beds.”
Amos looked around before hissing. “Oh yes you can.” and shutting the door in his face.
Penelope rolled her eyes. “Harry’s helping me, seeing as
is when people connect, when people talk and laugh. I think we can only truly live when we're around other people.”
Harry didn’t think he’d look good in a dress. Somehow Ron suited it though, the yellow with red ribbons almost matched Ron’s hair and warm skin tone.
“It’s fucking freezing in here.” Ron complains.
He was entering a world of competition, stamina and skill. If he could get these next seven years down his future could be set in stone.
Harry hadn’t any other place to be so he nodded. He picked up two boxes and walked along with her, only then releasing how tall she was. She towered over him and he thought that if her smile weren't so kind he might have been threatening.
There were a series of leaps before a couple twirls back with his arms structured high above his head. He kept his toes pointed for this part to transition into the structured step sequence. He ignored his Dad’s wide eyes as he frustratingly continued to show off what he’d learned. It wasn't elegant like it had been planned to be. Harry was exhausted and huffed with emotions but he knew either way the dance meant something.
“As you should well know, you are performers. It's time to start preparing like one. Everyone to the barre to warm up.”
“—Don’t quit ballet!”
The piano is playing sweetly and the hall is tinted yellow from the sun. He was dancing in the sunset. A wobbly portrayal of elegance he couldn't quite contain.
“What does someone from Durham look like?”
Hermione hadn’t taken his advice but Draco could almost see the internal struggle within her eyes every time she approached a barre or put on Pointe shoes.
Harry could feel his hands ache from catching himself from falling for the past hour. He could feel the anger bubbling up inside him. One more push and he’d snap.
“Father I’m telling you I can carry my own bags! There’s no need to stand out like this.”
Harry watched in slowed time as the boxes hit the ground with a
strides.
“She’s also just old you know.”
Daniel flinched. Penelope puffed her cheeks and nodded before smiling sweetly. “
She smiled sadly before speaking and looking towards the hall that led to the stage. She pointed towards it. “Promise me that one day Harry, we're going to dance together on
“You didn’t give up. Even if you were shite.”

Ginny laughs. “No
Going through some more editing. Didn't even realise my seventh chapter was still in the drafts. Rereading this makes me realise how fast paced the first two chapters are. I wont change this because I like the ballet school aspect of this story more and the relationship that developed later on but just beware. Go watch the movie (Billy Elliot) if you want a better telling of this aspect of the story. Thanks if you enjoy though!
that fact.
The next day his mum's piano is gone. The next is her clothes and jewellery. He knows why. There are more coins in the savings jar. More money for the fare.
They had two teachers in mixed gendered practice. Snape would stare at them expectantly while Mcgonagall instructed them. Harry found he liked her even though she was as equally strict as her male coworker. She reminded Harry of an older, more experienced Mrs Weasley.
“Move over then— Wait, then we can go together.”
mistakes when there’s music but I will not. Follow Draco’s lead Potter.”
He looked on as entranced by the boy who seemed to glow in his own radiance. Soft light shone through the small light feathers upon Potters cheeks and hairline. His expression was proud and delicate and his face was highlighted with gold and white bronzer. As he looked upon the artwork of the boy in those moments Draco was taken aback at the heavy thumping within his chest though he didn’t try to place the reason it thumped so hard.
Dean had advised Harry to stay away from him. He said grief made people mean and that he needed space.
“Right.”
There were a few times Harry could swear he heard humming. A small imitation of a piano or sombre melody. Harry might have hummed back if he could solemnly swear he’d actually heard the gentle noise. But he wasn’t sure, and he couldn’t risk it not being. He didn't know what to make of it, so he didn’t. Every afternoon was a surprise, and every memory was never recalled. Harry pushed those moments into boxes inside his head, there was no use trying to find meaning in placed there weren't.
Seamus sighed. “Math.”
with a female partner?”
— “No time Toots!”
He made his way back into the pool of dancers. The difficulty annoyed him. He stared at the mirror and looked at the weirdest reflection he’d ever seen.
He growls. “You don’t know anything other than to tell me what to do! With your failure daughter and redundant husband! You're just like everybody else!”
He smiled despite himself. "I promise."
Malfoy raised a hand. “
This was how Harry found himself wandering again, though even in his wander the slow rhythmic steps still came to him, and though he could hear no music he could almost feel the ghost of song.
He looked behind himself as a car drove up. A large black car that seemed very expensive. He stood there in silence as vehicle smoothed itself to a stop. The driver got out with a suit on and black sunglasses and opened the door for his passengers to get out. Another man who looked suited in the same clothes got out from the front and pulled two large bags from the boot. Harry pondered who would every need so much stuff.
The judges look amongst themselves. "That will be all Harry."
Ron looks to the sky. It's blue and the clouds are bright white. “You've got this—this
Potter was silent before smiling towards his friends. “At least
“What the fuck are you looking at!.”
. That's a flower isn't it?”
“What?”
“Okay girls, left hand on the barre.”
“Harry!” Ron calls out from up the hill.
He doesn't cry. There's no tears when you can't move. No tears when there's no melody, no harmonic sounds to soothe your thundering bloodstream. There's no beat to calm his mind no drums or violins. It's just silence. Pure mind numbing silence that would cause shivers if he could manage a twitch.
Daniel seemed to look on at Penelope with pride. Harry concluded he must have been her friend since first year, a friendship like that must have lasted a long time.
“I don’t look like a girl at all.”
Malfoy seemed to debate this in his head. His cold grey eyes flickered before turning cool. He nodded and started to snap his fingers in time.
“Uhh—
He doesn’t even have the time to be angry. He hasn’t the time to comprehend that his dad abandoned the union, crossed the picket line to go back to the mines, abandoned the cause.
He was horribly confused. It as like he was thrown into a pool not knowing how to swim. The girls twirled around with their arms above their heads. Every other second Harry was bumped into or bumped into someone else. He tried to follow but huffed in annoyance.
Harry nodded.
"Fire? why would ballet feel like fire?"
“What? It is. No offence Harry.”
He looked around before growing. “Dobby? Where's father?”
Harry’s gloomy mood doesn’t seem to transfer. “Dunno.”
One of the women raised an eyebrow at his long name. The rest stayed stoic.
A staff member he didn’t recognise called out for him. “Draco Malfoy?”
Originally written August 2020:
Harry reckons it’d be a weird sight. Two boys inside a boxing ring. One with the sense to take his jacket off during an exercise and one in full out winter clothes with a tutu on top.
Lavender shrugged. “It’s true but you shouldn’t say it.”
Harry started to tap dance along the walls of the room. His winter boots stomped to a beat he practised so well. He spun lazily a few times before stopping as something caught his eye. Or more like
”What makes you think that? All I did the other day was mess up and stomp around.”
She nodded. “Yeah I don’t think my solution will work well for you...I do have an idea about the performance though.”
Draco couldn’t help but chuckling more as Potter gasped. “Nothing! He’s being a twat!”
Before the boy could finish, Harry leaned himself forward to wrap Draco in a tight hug. It was positioned oddly at an awkward angle and Draco’s shoulder knocked his chin but that didn’t matter as he tried his best to comfort the lonesome friend. They shook with heavy breaths like a house of cards about to fall and each grip from the other became tighter and tighter by the second, as if each boy was afraid the other would crumble.
Harry helps a little girl named Rose. She’s only seven but he’s pretty sure ballet isn’t here calling. She always drifts to face the boxers and can barely lift her feet up when she walks let alone dance. Rose tells him he's an idiot for liking ballet. Tells him boxing would be much more fun than her torture. He tells her to repeat that when shes had her face smashed in with a glove. She laughs. He finds her funny like that.
“Okay… I have a mate up the road with a car who might be willing to help. Where's the guy?”
"Hold. Hold It! come on wheres your confidence?" Their teachers disappointment stuck at the other girls, some as little as four.
“Whose Daniel?”
“That boy. That delinquent was accepted into your so-called “high calibre” school. I called shortly after to ease my suspicions only to become
He turned back. “How’d you get him to stop.”
“I know you wanna ask. Just do it.” Draco spoke firmly and quietly.
than know what he was actually doing.
The slap doesn’t come out of nowhere. He sees it coming. He braces for it.
Somehow Draco’s year seemed to be filled with events he had no part in. Potter pretended to avoid him and all Draco could do was hum and sway.
Harry’s glad he hears this now. If he’d heard it any sooner he might have punched the lass. But then maybe he hopes he might have heard it sooner. Then he wouldn't have maybe punched the blonde boy. And then maybe he would have a chance to get in.
General classes were an entirely different matter though. Harry would count on both hands and feet how many times she shot her hand up in one class if he
There were pictures. Examples in the books. What stunned him was that some of the pictures included men.
These first two chapters are the movie and some extra stuff. The rest is ballet school, romance and growing up.
And just like that he was gone.
Harry looked around. "He’ll kill me if he knows I’m here.”
Harry waited, he knew they came in around the end of the song. He almost blushed at the words of the song but didn’t. Instead he turned to Malfoy.
Blaise was quiet. Harry had first thought him and Malfoy were friends but Harry wasn't able to pinpoint a moment he had actually seen them speak. He had no opinions about Blaise, the boy was boring and self absorbed as most students were.
“You can forget about ballet. You can forget about boxing. I’m busting my arse for those fifty pence I won't be having you wasting it. You know what they’d think of you? What they’d think of me?”
"Get over yourself I'm sure it was f—"
He cursed out Moody. If he’d never said anything Amos would’ve never found out.
“It’s settled then.”
begrudgingly
Dean caught the ball and held it for a moment.
Holding his leg up high was hard. It shook and trembled and was almost painful. It stung and Harry was second guessing his initial disposition towards the class. He didn’t really realise how difficult this act was though until he was the only one with their leg still up left in the air.
"But you don't even—"
“It has come to my attention that you have lied to me Draco.”
He took a moment to huff before speaking. “Your movements are very… what's the word? Classical. Half the dances and practises you know are specifically for female dancers. It’s less prideful and more…
“What do you mean?” Potter asked stupidly.
Cedric doesn’t help carry his bags to the bus. Tells him he’s going to have to carry them alone in London so he might as well do it alone now. He still follows though. Close behind and checking to make sure Harry brought everything he needed.
Draco Malfoy was
“Why are you still practising now? It’s getting late.” he asked quietly.
“Oh!” a young feminine voice called out in surprise as she dropped the four pink boxes she was holding.
“Draco, Language.”
Harry was baffled by this explanation to the point at which he thought it may be a joke. Draco was
He can’t remember the song. It was about love or war or something, neither of which he would have understood.
“Potter. I have three last names, why that one?”
Ron pats down the snowman. "They talk about going to university together, start a business."
“Seems I can when it's directed towards Potter.”
a before. An image of an old house. A cat. A rose bush he's sure must have plucked his fingers once. There were was one year before two before three. But the before never happened. Not in any ways that mattered.
He looked back towards Potter. The boy didn’t seem to notice his stare as he laughed and tried to lift up Hermione, whose snarl pronounced her buck teeth and whose book repeatedly hit his shoulder. Potter didn’t seem to notice as he paid attention to his wobbly arms and calculated his next try.
Malfoy seemed to deliberate the results before nodding. “It seems you're not completely incompetent after all.”
Snape seemed to finally take notice of the ruckus and seemed to face palm before addressing the group. “Potter, what have you done to Draco?”
“I don’t k—”
He hadn’t even thought about making friends. Didn’t know if he would. Still, friendship was on his mind.
It was during these afternoons when Harry could understand what Draco had meant about the sky tinted endless orange. Golden hour seemed to last eternity in those halls within those rooms and the sight of their dancing shadows would appear to be the only things that demanded attention. The light was always soft and warm despite the evening chill and it was highly beautiful.
Ron enters the room. He seems to look around the scene before his eyelids droop unimpressed. He had somehow managed, Harry doesn’t know how, to firmly wrap a towel around his wet hair like in the movies. Ron folds his arms.
Potter. His father spoke of Potter and Draco almost laughed at the absurdity. Of all the lies Draco spilled towards his father of course his first one about a shaggy haired boy would fall.
“Yeah because that’s funny! This is just awkward.”
“Take a torch at least!” Dean held his fire stick out.
“Won’t you get in trouble?” Harry knows the kind of havoc his dad would make seeing this.
Harry crunches up his face in humour. “Your family is right crazy.”
in tutus and he's sure a couple of them were capable of prancing. He watched them all move their legs back and forth trying to keep up with the piano and Mrs Weasley's instructions. A few girls looked like they were in pain. Harry found this odd. He didn't understand. Some of the girls weren't very good and some of the girls moves a bit like swans. It was a weird sight. He made his way to the barre where Molly had perched herself to light a cigarette.
Harry helps position his friend. He shows him how to bend his knees and position his arms.
“Nice to meet you?”
She rolled her eyes like her daughter did. “Did you enjoy yourself?”
Amos stilled but nodded.
He started a second late. For the first few seconds he'd been rendered still and his body had refused to move. He was sure they could tell. His feet were off the rhythm. He’d practised this so many times but for some reasons his breath continued to catch. His dad had looked with wide eyes when he’d done this. But when he finished there was no more than a blink.
...and at that moment it was really annoying. Harry was figuring out he didn’t like posh people very much.
Potter turned away and stood up hastily before dredging over to a sour looking Dean.
Harry had assumed she’d be good. The school after all had bought her eight very expensive shoes and the Daniel boy seemed to joke about her high praise. None of that prepared Harry for her dance.
Mrs Weasley met him on weekends and Wednesdays afternoons. She told him he would have to practise on his own most days but he mostly kept it to the days he saw her.
Ron had his reasons practised. They'd had this same conversation on numerous occasions since Harry started. There was a slight difference this time. Ron usually stayed acres away fro the hall. Harry thought he was afraid to be pulled in.
Harry ran throughout the theatre scouting for the shoe boxes. He hadn’t time to worry about his own performance as the only thought on his mind was his friend.
he scraped a knee but
“I’m sorry Harry.”
“No offence but that has nothing to do with me.” Malfoy went to turn away and Harry was stricken with the desire to make him
Harry noticed the boy next to him seemed to sniffle slightly. His cheeks were shiny and his nose was red. Tears fell like sad notes on a piano and Harry looked away knowing they weren't for him to see.
Penelope seemed to sway in silence before bouncing up. “Oh Harry! Would you like to see me practise my performance?”
—he couldn’t see the blonde boy around him which meant he was most likely behind him somewhere. Then again most people were behind him as the first years were seated towards the front of the hall.
boy was the subject of his fascinations. He knew though. Draco knew from their first alteration that Harry was something he could care about. He knew this because Harry hurt.
Harry was a little shocked at the boy’s curiosity but didn’t punish it. “It’s quiet… and loud. Most of the adults are nob-heads. There was only one ballet class, not to mention I was the only boy there. I’d never trained with boys before now.”
Snape snapped. “That's where you're wrong! You don’t try like the others you just do as the others do! For your own sake leave while you can and live to be employable.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who’s a scab now ehh.”
“Yeah.” Harry replied.
Snape could have sworn he saw a smile on Harry, could have sworn he saw one on Draco. He wanted to quit right there.
“Merry Christmas to you too." She took a puff. "I know , I taught him.”
Maybe the most eye catching thing about the whole situation was Potter's hair… or lack of it.
Luna smiled. "Don't worry Harry. Death isn't nearly as scary as they make it out to be."
He smiled and turned to go.
They both laugh. Harry looks towards the grave. “Do you think she’d be proud of me?”
Draco cleared his throat. “It’s our purpose as dancers. The girls work on pointe and we work on jumps. Our stronger bodies are built for those movements.”
Seamus spoke, mouth half filled with bread. “I ‘ope they let us dance with the girls this ‘ear.” He swallowed. “We’ve been practising with them so much, it must be for something.”
Dean laughed. “Shite Harry, well aren’t you such a bad boy!”
“I'm not sure Dean—”
The black hand clicks.
A lady pointed them up the stairs and he had to call for his dad, who was looking around at the architecture in awe.
“Shut up.”
weird. “Nah you're good.”
“Sorry.” He vocalised and lent down to pick them up.
to do it because you're a failure!”
“When will you be leaving?”
He wondered when he'd see the grave next... he'd never gone more than a week without it.
Due to this free time Harry would find himself in that small empty corridor with the landline every afternoon. Sometimes he didn’t even make a call. Sometimes he would stare at the faded red paint and gaze over the number wheel. He could flick the wheel around in boredom sometimes. He could pick the phone up to his ears, tap it. Listen to the monotonous hum it played.
Harry growled "Stop acting like you know everything! Can’t we just practise it bit by bit? Or with music at least!”
Cedric tries to latch himself onto the bus but a cop pulls him towards the concrete. Two of his lads pull the bloke off Cedric and he takes the opportunity to run back into the crowd.
She examined him for a second before letting his leg fall. “Class dismissed.”
He shivered as he heard the boy's father speak.
at her. He fumed and felt his ears turn red. She’d spoken those same words for the past two weeks and they echoed in his ear.
The fire seemed to reflect in Potters glasses and Draco decided he’d had enough of the monster and turned around.
Harry runs over and hands his friend a tutu. There's a box of them near the door. All pink and obnoxious.
Harry huffs and leans on his own knees before facing Ron. He smiles brilliantly and turns his head to the side.
Sometimes Harry doesn't know why he tricks himself into thinking he liked

“Was there any particular part?”
"She had a piano Harry."

Her raising voice startles him. “Alright Alright don’t lose your
Harry shook his arms around. “To get better you divy.”
Potter’s head swilled around. “What are you laughing at?” He accused.
“We’ve learned loads.”

He finally snapped when she started trying to get him to do three pirouettes in a row. He was getting sick of falling on the boxing ring matts over and over again. He thought he’d moved past that.
Harry was escorted out of the room. Amos glared daggers knowingly at him. He wanted to disappear.
Editors Note: I actually appreciate this chapter now more than the first one. It's nice to revisits this story nearly a year later. Not much has changed but still. I fear the spelling mistakes to come. I tried to fix the ones here and I reread all my chapters before posting but somehow some slip through. Anyway enjoy!
Harry pouted. “What lads do wrestling?”
“Penelope! I found them!”
turned into a shouting match, because it happened every time.
“Where are you going?”
The drive seemed to last an eternity as Cedric toed the line between the speed limit and and cursed every other minute.. Harry couldn't stop himself from worriedly tapping his feet as stars started to appear into the darkened sky.
They look at him, sadness and dread in their eyes.
The boy didn’t seem to huff at his physical exertion and continued. “You going to the Ballet school?”
“I’ll miss you if you go away.”
Harry's Parent and home life is written like this with these characters because I felt like it. (also because I felt like it fit better than any other alternatives and I have stuff planned for the other characters.)
"Fuck off!"
Ron’s head tilted. “Dunno.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened as Harry turned and grabbed his shoulders. “You're brilliant at it! I mean you're a twat but you're good and passionate and I've been meaning to ask you to help me with my
. Cedric left almost every night and came back with more bruises than he started with. Amos didn’t speak other than to yell or tell Harry what to do.
“You don’t care.”
Harry doesn’t know what went down. All he really knows is one minute he’s forbidden from even thinking about ballet and the next Cedric and Amos are doing all they can to save up for the bus fare to London.
Malfoy seemed to think about this. “That makes no sense, you talk about your dad…”
Harry nodded and looked up. The boy was no older than him but seemed to have much longer legs. Taller. Harry couldn't speak in the moment as he examined the boy next to him.
She flinched but didn’t lift her gaze or move the umbrella. Her grip was firm though.
Harry stilled and gazed around the room. He noticed how it was much easier to ignore someone when hidden in a class of many.
do the dancing. She gets fulfilment from her students learning or whatever.”
That afternoon he watches Cedric get chased. He watched as batons and angry police kick and hit him until his white shirt turns red. Harry can't even scream. Just sigh and watch his older brother get thrown into the police car. A slow dread seeps into  his bones. He can hardly feel as the numbness grows.
Harry stood there confused for a second. “But...
Harry looked towards the clock, they had around seventy minutes until Penelope’s final performance. “Have you told a teacher?”
Harry. This fire within you. It draws people in. Negatively or not you attract people like a heater during winter. It's like the earth spins just for
“What are we doing down here Potter?”
Instead, Draco Malfoy was afraid of
“Do you think they'll make us wear lipstick?” Seamus asked.
“Language Mr Potter!”
He looked back blankly at the mirror. Then Miss walked past him. She showed him a small grin and winked.
, I’m stuck with bloody Malfoy.”
Potter shrugged. “There's been weirder things, He was quite good at makeup.”
"My mother was a dancer before she died."
He didn’t bother to correct her. He didn’t know if he needed to. He liked the music and he knew that. Can't he just learn the piano or something? Was this the only way?. He sat in his exhaust for a moment. He kind of liked the burn in his chest. He liked that when he did do something right he stood out from the rest of the class. He started at his shoes and pointed his feet.
Mcgonagall pointed at the words.
We also get to meet Draco~
“Boxing's Hard.”
He leaned against a tree and looked down at her, who seemed to have her head in a hole by tree roots.
Harry knew of expectations. He’d iced in them and then fought his way out of them. He knew how hard they could be. Even so he’d never seen such arbitrary expectations in his life. And even with all his worry of losing a friend, a teaspoon of pettiness arose.
… Harry nods.
“You get back here!”
"Cause any problems? Mentally?"
Lavender in all her fake sweetness let a tear fall. “You’ll write us? And call?”
practise is so important?”
“What is it then?”
“Of course. Come to the barre please Harry.”
“What’s Plie.”
at the phone he’d been looking for. The boy hadn’t seemed to notice him and paced back and forth looking conflicted at the red landline built into a box in the wall. Everything from the phone to the boy looked out of place.
Draco couldn’t help but turn his head towards them as Potter spoke.
They both laugh. He finds Ginny quite amusing when she isn’t laughing at
Draco’s looks hadn’t changed much though recently his hair had gotten a little unkempt and his height was slowly but surely growing. His sparkling grey eyes still demanded to be admired though that much Harry was sure could never change.
. That's what Draco had called him. His cheeks reddened as he gulped and the word thrummed within his veins.
Ron held up some makeup and peered at Harry's face. “Don’t think so. Charlie does it.”
The bed creaked under his weight and Harry sat up to look at him. His confusion looked a lot like annoyance but Amos knew the difference. “You can go…”
Dean kicked his friend's foot.
Harry felt bad knowing those words were not true.
“Why would I do that?”
She paused for a second before writing something down.
She seemed to jump in surprise and bumped her head on a branch. “Jesus! Where’d you come from? Lurking around in the dark!”
Rose quits ballet the day he goes for the audition. Ginny says she joined boxing, looked Moody in the eye and said she'd scream until he let her.
“Music. Dancing.” He mumbled. The words didn't want to elaborate.
Ron says he needs to have a shower and Harry is ushered into their shared bedroom by Ginny.
Penelope nodded quickly. “Thank you!”
Harry’s never heard anyone say that before. His dad

fall. His feet stayed where they were meant to and his arms splayed out in exhaustion. He ways always exhausted.
Ron turns around and chucks a lipstick at him. “
“Really?”
“Hermione?”
“Your dad didn’t know you were doing ballet?”
He did his best not to still. He racked his brain as he spoke. “What might this be?”
He doesn’t remember waking up. There was no room in his mind left for the memory of having breakfast and walking down those empty blue halls. One moment he was in a car, the next day he was practising in his studio.
school.”
Amos turned and walked away.
The bond boy looked up. “...Do you remember when we first spoke? I asked about the cathedral.”
“Father?”
He needn’t remind himself though. The mirrors showed two boys, dancing in motion with eyebrows furrowed with arms snappy and slow. It looked almost like a show of superiority, a fight between two boys set to song. The lyrics may have talked about love but all Harry saw was a rivalry, a slow cool rivalry with music and dance.
“He’s helping our class get ready, I didn’t want to bother him—His parents are here with the company he’s aiming for.”
He didn't think anyone deserved their fate. This fate. With the striking, the cancer, Harry not showing up to boxing. He was starting to think someone up
“Plie first.”
“Yeah why not.”
"You loved her? Even when she was with James?"
. It was so overwhelmingly depressing when she was sick but now there's just nothing there anymore, all her stuffs been moved. Staying there is like staying in a house on
“I don’t know Son. I never made it past Durham.”
Malfoy squeezed his eyes shut. “Yes…”
The blond boy, Draco huffed. “I need independence Fathe—”
Potter finally spoke during Draco’s internal monologue “I—I think we revolve around people.”
“God no they all look fine. Don’t blame yourself anyway, blame Daniel. He was supposed to help me bring these to the room.”
Harry was shocked for a moment. The boy hadn’t seemed to acknowledge their first meeting that entire day and had even denied it outright. A million questions flickered through his mind before speaking.
"Why didn't
noise coming from himself. He pushed away his confusion and shrugged before speaking. “Lovely song, my mother has the record.”
Harry grins and there's almost a little guilt as he leans forward. He returns the cheek peck Ron had given him on Christmas not too many months ago. It's light and innocent and doesn't promise anything more and they both know it.
"You can usually tell these things Harry. I guess in another life it could have worked out...
“This is my second.”
He figured his memory just trimmed out the unimportant parts and stitched them back together later,
Harry smiles and pulls back. There's been weirder things to happen and he can't find any disgust or repulsion within himself. “Course not. C’mon. I've got an idea.”

“What’s London like?” He asks Amos.
Harry found himself tapping his foot anxiously, the performance was to be in nearly an hour and he shivered in a quiet empty room.  The rest of his year had gone to greet the parents waiting outside and all that was left was him, a few girls and Malfoy.
"What people do Ballet?"
? But it’s the capital city.”
Draco was nowhere in sight as she spoke and Harry felt his old bitterness towards the boy rise up. “Is he the reason?” He asked with a light frown.
“You're not even trying. Again!”
Harry looked back when he realised his companion hadn’t followed. "What’s wrong.”
He wasn’t quite sure when he’d started referring to the boy as Draco but he was sure it had to have been recently. It seemed that they were in such proximity all the time that the thought of spending years calling someone by their last name would have been a little redundant. Of course Draco refused to give up using Harry's middle last name so he wasn’t entirely going to let go of Draco’s…at least out loud.
Harry nodded before preparing a demi plié to jump. Draco presumably bored with his sustained sautés looked towards Harry analysing his next moves before catching on and following. They never communicated before changing practices, there was never any need too.
“I hate you!” he fumed. “You're a

Hope you enjoyed~ I had fun writing this one, I'm trying to have them both slowly mature while still being oblivious children. Time is wacky.
“You are too!”
I re-read this chapter like four times to get it right and I think I finally got it the way I wanted. Anyway here is the start of this self indulgent AU with more Harry than ever (seeing as my last fic had Harry out of the game for like 90% of it)
His face fell as he looked down. His arms by his side.
“He’s just a kid. A fucking little kid please .”
Draco stilled before shaking his head.
Hermione spoke this time. “Fifteen minutes.”
Harry scrunches his face up. He feels like he doesn’t need to know but still continues to speak. “She does dancing instead of sex?”
"Maybe you shouldn't have put my freezing hands in your jumper then."
"Shove it."
“Do you think he’ll agree?”
Draco didn’t look back. “I’d rather die.”
“Thanks.”
“—Can’t you do that here? Not in the dark in the middle of a park?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where are your parents? Will they be out there?”
He never realised how short boxing was until he heard all the boys leave. It wasn't even sixty minutes and all Harry would do during it was get punched and yelled at. Who in their right minds paid money for that? His fathers face came to mind.
They wrestle before falling into a tight hug. Cedric squeezes his eyes shut. “He’s only a boy. He’s only eleven for fucks sake!”
He frowned. “Bored I guess, not a huge fan of fire.”

fire.” Draco spit out the words hoping to insult the monster.
They sat like that. In sombre silence. Harry fiddled with his tie and sleeveless button up as he waited for the other boy to stop crying. Harry began to find he hated when other people cried. He especially hated when Malfoy cried. He wasn’t sure whether to feel pity or empathetic. Wasn’t sure if he was allowed to not care or if he did actually care.
emotion was displayed on the other boy's face. He found the unspoken apology rushing back but all he could do was still and stare.

“Don’t act foolish. You're smarter than that. It’s why you don’t belong here. A medical school sure, Law maybe? Even a musical arts school would better suit your incessant need for learning.

Daniel smiled with guilt in his face. “I was holding onto them for you.”
“—Yes I do.”
He nods. “I reckon so Harry.”
......
Draco stared at his Gryffindor friend as though he had grown another head. Harry nodded slowly, ‘Yep it was your elf Drake, your elf is trying to kill me,’ Harry deadpanned.
‘You fainted Potter?’ Is Longbottom telling the truth?  You actually fainted?’
Harry reached the trophy room first that night. He walked over to the nearest window and looked out at the night sky. The stars seemed brighter than usual as though there was a frost in the air. He wondered about Sirius, was he out there in the cold? Harry was worried about him, he felt a connection to the man that had been a friend to both his parents even though they had never met. Would he ever get to meet him? Harry was that lost in his own thoughts that he didn’t notice the sound of footsteps until a pair of strong arms snaked around his waist.
‘Potter I belive that you are the hero of the hour....’
years sat in front of the fire, sometimes speaking, sometimes just staring. The two Slytherin’s said nothing both happy enough to be accepted to sit with the hero’s of the war. Each Slytherin was in silent awe of the student’s around them, the sacrifices’ they had made, the fights they had fought and the war they had won. It was humbling to be in their presence.
Harry’s eyes snapped back to her, ‘His what? Tattoo? What? Where?’ Ginny chuckled at his reaction and pointed, thankful that Draco’s eyes were still closed, ‘There look, his rib cage.’ Without looking she knew the exact moment Harry had spotted it as there was a distinct groan from behind her, ‘Merlin, and just when I thought he couldn’t get any hotter,’ Harry’s tone was hushed and  almost reverent as she turned and faced him. ‘Harry this is your last chance, you have to say something.’ Harry swallowed, ‘I know, I will, just, one more drink.’ Ginny sighed, she remembered the first time she caught Harry looking at Draco with something other than malice in his eyes, it had taken her by surprise at first, but then, as she had thought about it she had realised it actually wasn’t that surprising. There had always been something about those two, they gravitated towards each other, and they could find each other without question even on the busiest of streets. It was like destiny that Harry would fall for him, one the war was over and all preconceived notions of good and evil were out of the way, it was the only rational thing left. There is a fine line as they say and then she had caught Malfoy looking at Harry in that same way and knew it was only a matter of time, yet here they were, the last night at Hogwarts and neither of the stubborn fools had said a word. It was tonight or never.
Harry sat up, crossing his legs in front of him as he did, staring in the general direction of Ron’s bed.
Harry shifted nervously and glanced over to where Neville  and Zabini were huddled whispering just to the side of them, he was sure that Neville would tell Zabini everything so there was no point trying to hide anything;
‘I see,’ he replied, ‘ I assume that you are aware of the implications of this ... relationship.’ Snape spat out the last word.
‘I am fully aware of the consequences of my actions should they be discovered, however, they will not, and you should know that I am fully aware of your quite obvious dislike of Harry and your attempts to harm him’ Draco said as he looked directly in to the eyes of his Godfather.
Draco turned his head, almost shaking his head in disbelief at the concern he saw before him, Harry had just been betrayed in the worst possible way and here he was full of concern for him. He was in awe of the man before him, he never ceased to amaze him;
‘So you didn’t get kicked out then?’
Severus steepled his fingers, resting his elbows on the arm of the chair, his fingertips meeting at his chin, but still he did not speak knowing that Draco would in his own time. He was concerned when he realised his godson was crying but knew not to push the young man before him. Draco swallowed and sat up a little straighter in an effort to compose himself, ‘Can I ask a personal question?’
For God’s sake what the hell, is there no escape, stupid git, what’s so special about Harry Potter, ‘argh’ Draco hadn’t realised that he had said that last part out loud, Goyle looked carefully at his friend.
As Harry was carted off to the Hospital Wing, yet again, Draco began to plot the downfall of a certain blonde haired idiotic professor.
Draco looked down in to those green eyes and calmed almost instantly;
‘well, well, well,’ he whispered, ‘we are in trouble.’
Draco groaned and ran a hand through his hair that was currently hanging loose around his face.
......
‘Never mind,’
‘Yep’ Harry replied as Draco began to leaf through it, ‘Erm, some diary, It’s empty, not one mark... wait .... it should have marks... it should be covered in your ridiculous red ink.’ Harry swatted him on the arm for that comment but nodded eagerly, ‘I know right.’
‘Come here,’ he said, opening his arms to Draco. Draco thought for a second, then lay down in Harry’s arms, his head on the small boys chest.  Harry never wanted to let go and Draco never wanted to leave the safety he felt with the Gryffindor’s arms around him. Eventually they drifted off in to a companionable sleep.
‘I was not aware that you cared about the fate of Mr Potter, however, I assure you that although he currently remains unconscious he will, undoubtedly, be back to what I  will begrudgingly call normal in a few days.’
After an eventful Divination lesson where their new teacher had predicted his death, with a little help from Ron, followed by an equally eventful Transfiguration lesson where he had been assured he wasn’t going to die Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Ron and Hermione had argued about The Grim all morning and now weren’t  speaking . The three of them walked side by side in silence towards Hagrid’s hut.
‘Charming,’ said Draco with a smile, ‘come on,’
Harry sighed, ‘Well it’s really rocky, a guy singing it, it’s really good I can’t stop tapping my foot to it, It’s a good beat.’ Ron nodded with a smile on his face, ‘right ok, but what’s it called ? If you don’t know tell me some of the words.’ Harry opened his mouth as if to reply but no words came out, he frowned; ‘they were right there. On the tip of my tongue, but now they’ve gone.’ At this, Ron gave a smug smile, ‘Told you, it’s your soul song.’ With that he sat back and folded his arms across his chest, satisfied he had won this one, ‘But..’  Harry began but was interrupted by Hermione clearing her throat, he watched her sit a little straighter and grimaced and when he realised  Hermione was settling in for lecture mode.
‘Nev?’
‘So what is it Harry?’ Draco asked sulkily.
Harry had never felt a pain like it. He felt like someone had driven a red hot poker in to his forehead and was slowly and deliberately twisting in around. He screamed as the pain shot through him. He let go of Draco’s hand and gripped at his head with both of his hands, he stumbled around , trying in vain to clear his head. Draco flew to Harry and wrapped his arms tightly around the small boy. He was terrified, that scream from Harry had almost stopped his heart. He had seen the raw pain in those emerald eyes, he had no idea what had happened to cause his friend such pain he just knew that he needed it to stop.
Draco could not hide his smug smile as he realised what Harry had just said, this was something that only he could help Harry with.
Ron shot a pleading look at Hermione in hope that his almost-girlfriend would make Harry see sense. Hermione took a seat on the couch Harry was leaning against and placed a hand on his shoulder; ‘What Ron is getting at Harry, is that Draco hurt you, I know him, he is my friend.’ She ignored a snort from Ron,’ but he acted like a complete idiot and he has not even apologised for accusing you, for not trusting you. Don’t you understand why Ron is angry it’s like Draco has got away with hurting you, he gets you back, just like that.’
Harry set nervously on the edge of his bed wondering how what he wanted to say would be received. Neville was at the window, humming some Weird Sisters song and pruning the strangest looking plant Harry has ever seen. Neville had definitely changed over the past few months, there was an air of confidence about him that Harry knew had to do with a certain brown eyed Slytherin. Blaise was slowly helping Neville believe in himself and it was a wonderful thing to see. Harry felt honoured to be allowed a window seat in their relationship.
‘You wish’ thought Draco, ‘You have got to get through me to get to him.’ Draco’s heart was breaking at the sound of screaming on the ground behind him, but he stood his ground, drawing his wand he planted his feet firmly apart as the figure began to close the distance between them.
......
‘Well there simply aren’t enough of us to warrant whole classes to ourselves, I think we will be put in with the 7
Pansy stopped looking around, closing her mouth with a snap and stared at her friend, ‘The what? What does that mean? How did you know it was here?’
The boys moved nearer to the mirror, stepping in front of it. Harry gasped. Not only was Draco there next to him but reflected behind him were at least ten others. Harry looked behind him , there was no one there, it was just the two of them. He looked in to the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him. She was very pretty , with dark red hair and her eyes – she had Harry’s eyes. ‘Mum?’ He whispered and looking at the untidy haired men standing next to her, ‘Dad?’
Harry gaped openly at his friend, he felt betrayed ‘He is not my boss!’ he huffed indignantly  and poked his bottom lip out slightly.
They didn’t know how long they had sat talking but they began to get a bit uncomfortable. Draco started fidgeting, Harry chuckled, ‘Numb bum?’ he asked. ‘Yup,’ he said and stood up.
‘Everything, Malfoy, hitting you, just everything.’ Ron said as he cautiously perched on the end of Harry’s bed.
Hermione suppressed a giggle and turned to Hagrid, ‘So what are we doing tonight?’
It was a little while later when Blaise returned to his compartment. Draco’s head snapped up when Blaise entered, he cast a glance at Crabbe and Goyle, then looked back up to Blaise, he had to be careful what he said.
‘Say what?’
Draco could not concentrate on the sorting that was taking place, he clapped absent mindedly whenever he heard the word Slytherin shouted by the sorting hat but his eyes never left the Gryffindor table in front of him. There was still no sign of Harry.
Harry felt as though he had to almost creep into the room so as not to disturb the peace. He could not take his eyes from Draco's face. Draco seemed lost in his own world, so Harry took this rare opportunity to look his fill. His eyes roved over every inch in the boy in front of him lingering at the pale lips that were settled in to a natural pout, Harry fought the sudden urge to just grab Draco and kiss him senseless. He knew that before he could do that, he needed to fill him in about the day’s events.
The tension was thick as Theo  continually made jibes about the dementors and Harry tried valiantly to ignore them. Theo wasn’t taking kindly to being ignored and was becoming increasingly aggressive towards the Gryffindor, seemingly wanting to provoke the boy in to a fight. The class backed away to give them room their eyes never leaving the two, but not all eyes were on them, those in the know were  warily watching Draco, whose cold, stoic mask of indifference gave nothing away.
Draco looked up and met those eyes he loved so much and saw nothing but honesty staring back.
‘Screw you,’ muttered Draco in despair. ‘What the hell is going on?’ he thought.
‘Oh, so you think I can’t handle Potter and the little Weasel, is that it?’ Draco glared at Goyle.
There was a huff and then Dean spoke quietly; ‘Leave him Shay, please.’
I am so so so sorry for the delay. This story has not been abandoned I'm just crazy busy !! Enjoy :D
Harry thought for a moment then explained about the cover story Draco had come up with, ‘then’ he said ‘ I can tell him everything else without the need to mention Draco.’
‘Well?’
‘Draco I believe that you have some explaining to do.’
‘So what’s stopping you?’
Draco brought both his hands to rest in Harry's shoulders, 'I wish you would have let me forge a signature on the permission slip for you, I can't bear to think of you stuck here on your own,' Harry sat up and twisted around so that he could get a better look at Draco, 'you know as well as I do that a forgery would be detected a mile off and I would be in so much trouble, plus I doubt they'd let me go even if I had a permission slip due to the fact that everyone think there is a mass murderer out to get me.' Draco rested his forehead against Harry's temple, 'I hate to say this but you're probably right about that and I suppose even you have to be right sometimes,' With that comment Draco was dealt another blow to the ribs, this time with a little more force but there was still no malice behind it. Draco huffed and dug his fingers into Harry's sides knowing how ticklish his boyfriend was, Harry threw his hands out to stop Draco, laughing as the onslaught continued. He writhed in Draco's lap laughing and trying desperately to fight back, suddenly she stopped dead, jaw dropping as he felt Draco grow hard beneath him.
‘Sssh Ron, let me tell you the rest.’
Draco didn’t even bother lifting his head to look at Pansy, he opted to just shrug his shoulders.
Transfiguration started off as normal, McGonagoll was discussing the theory of turning a living thing in to an inanimate object and Ron was doodling on his parchment. He was sitting at the front next to Seamus, the Gryffindors on one side of the room and the Slytherin’s on the other. Pansy, Draco and Blaise had decided to sit on the second row for the front for two reasons, Draco had placed himself directly across the aisle from Harry who was sitting behind Ron and he also had a perfect view of Ron. Unbeknown to many people Draco had a secret love of origami, he had been doing it since he was a young boy as a way to amuse himself during long, lonely hours at the manor and he had become quite adept at making any animal, he had decided to put this talent to use during this lesson, he knew he was risking the wrath of McGonagol but he decided that it was so worth it. Before the lesson Draco had made several tiny spiders out of paper and which were currently sitting in the pocket of his school bag waiting for a whispered charm from Pansy.
‘Well why not?’ Shrugged Draco, ‘I’m sure we could require beds, and it allows us to stay together without having to stay in one another’s rooms.’
‘’It’s amazing!’ said Draco in awe.
Draco tilted his head and closed his eyes. He swallowed hard and let the music wash over him. The steady thump of the bass was pulsing in his throat as he leaned back on the large speaker behind him. This party had been a bad idea; he had known that as soon as he had arrived but he was here now he may as well make the most of it.
‘Call me Harry, please’
The Slytherin's were still none the wiser as they arrived at the Great Hall, in fact it wasn't until the Ravenclaws began descending the staircase behind them that some light was shed on the subject.
‘What do you want Parkinson?’ interrupted Hermione.
‘Hagrid, stop blubbering this instant, each one of us fully knew the risks of doing what we did last night. You didn’t want to give Norbet up, WE made that decision, WE crept around the castle after hours and WE forgot the cloak. It was down to OUR stupidity that we are here. This is not your fault so get a bloody grip.’
Harry offered a small smile and gave Draco’s hand a small squeeze. ‘It’s just hard when the whole school has decided I’m evil and I’m not even sure that I am not.’
‘Ok, so you said we were locked up, who were we? And what do you mean by locked up?’
‘Hey,’ shouted Ron, ‘How is that fair on me, I’m not doing that’ he crossed his arms across his chest and huffed loudly, Hermione patted him on the arm gently, ‘come on Ron it’s not for long and it’s only Harry, you need to do it for the game.’ Ron looked up and caught Harry’s eye, he smiled apologetically at his outburst worried he might have offended his friend with is reaction but then he noticed the peculiar shade of red Draco was turning and the way he was glaring at Blaise with murder in his eyes and wondered if it was because of the dare, did Draco have a crush on Harry? Oh that was priceless. Ron beamed across the circle at Harry and patted his lap, ‘Come and get yourself comfy Harry,’ he said as Harry crawled towards him, Ron chanced a glance at Draco and was rewarded with the iciest glare he had ever received from the blonde. Ron decided he was going to make the most of this opportunity, reaching out he grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him in to his lap, Harry was a lot shorter than him but in his lap he was blocking is view of the circle, watching Draco carefully out of the corner of his eye he wrapped his arms around Harry’s middle and pulled him closer resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder, ‘There’ he said,’ That’s better, I can see now.’ Ron grinned around the circle and caught wide silver eyes staring at him with ill concealed shock, oh this was brilliant, Ron turned his head slightly and whispered to Harry, ‘Sorry mate hope this isn’t too weird and don’t forget I like girls,’ he said teasingly causing Harry to turn his head slightly and smile at the red head and shake his head slightly in exasperation. Ron was acutely aware of what this must look like to Draco and he couldn’t but shoot a smirk at the glowering Slytherin. He had found a way to get to the blonde and he was loving every minute.
......
Draco smirked and there was an evil glint in his eye as he pushed Harry off him he pounced on the smaller boy pushing him to the floor, he swung a long leg over Harry and straddled him, pinning his arms above his head, ‘Sure am,’ he said quietly as he leaned in to kiss his boyfriend for the first time that day.
‘Ah the elusive Trevor.’
Then Harry remembered why he was there in the first place. He looked in to the silver eyes in front of him;
‘Ron’ Harry yelled, ‘stop now just stop it.’
Blaise shrugged, ‘I don’t know but anything is worth a try.’
‘Mmmmm.’ Was the only reply he received. Draco watched as his father strode over to the counter to begin his business transactions that had brought them here this morning.  He knew from experience  that his father would not be the slightest bit interested in what he was doing so he carefully made his way over to where Harry was trying to climb in to a large chest.  Draco sighed, his Godfather had been right Harry just seemed to fall in to trouble wherever he looked. At that moment Harry looked up and caught the silver eyes staring at him in shock, ‘wonderful,’ thought Harry, ‘I’ve not seen him for weeks  and now, when I do see him, I’m lost, covered in soot and wearing broken glasses.’ Harry watched as Draco approached him with a finger pressed over his lips willing him to stay quiet. Harry felt his eyes wander over the boy in front of him with an appraising look. Draco had changed since Harry had last seen him, Harry studied the blonde boy carefully as he approached him, the most obvious change was his height, Draco had grown a good couple of inches so now Harry had to tilt his neck all the more to look into those silver eyes. On closer inspection Harry noticed other differences, he could see that the shoulders of the blonde had broadened slightly, his face was also less rounded making his long jaw line  and strong features more pronounced, Harry thought with appreciation that these changes suited Draco very much. Harry shivered as he felt hot breath on his ear and noticed another change as a considerably deeper voice whispered to him, ‘What the hell are you doing in here?’
‘I know you can beat him. D x’
‘Wait, what?’ Draco interrupted.
Breakfast at the Gryffindor table was a strained and quiet affair. Word of the altercation between Ron and Harry had spread that morning like wildfire, most of the first year were not speaking to Ron, in shock over what he had done to his best friend, there were whispers and stares and speculation was rife over what Harry had done to cause Ron to hit him. Ron remained resolutely silent, stubbornly refusing to say what had happened silently grumbling his way through his bacon and eggs. Hermione sat stoically at his side but was not attempting to speak to him as she was disgusted with his behaviour but too much of a good friend to leave him to eat alone.  A hush fell over the table and Hermione looked up to see Harry entering the hall followed closely by Neville, Hermione flashed him a small smile which he gratefully returned.
Harry reached up to grab the parchment from Ron, the two scuffled for a minute with Ron claiming victory, Harry ran across to his bedside table and dragged his own version of the parchment out so he could join in the conversation and defend himself;
‘Ok,’ Blaise nodded and looked at each of the students around him, ‘now who to choose as my victim,’ he caught Draco’s eye and smirked , ‘Harry’ he said, ‘truth or dare?’
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
Draco had successfully managed to sneak Harry in to the Slytherin dungeon and now that sat crossed legged facing each other on Draco’s bed with Harry’s chess set in between them, the concentration on Harry’s face was evident as the tip of his tounge stuck out of the side of his mouth.
year had spent the summer at the castle they were already there when the other students arrived at the castle. Once the sorting and the feast were over the 8
Ron sighed and dropped his hand back to his lap, they had tried on more than one occasion to visit Hermione but they had not been allowed and it was hitting them both hard, ‘I know mate, I really do, I hate this as much as you do,but I’m sure the slimey git will think of something, something that doesn’t involve you trying to get yourself killed.’
‘I’ll have to go, I’ll speak to you tomorrow? ‘ this last part came out sounding more like a question than Ron anticipated but he couldn’t help but smile when Pansy  nodded in response.
......
It was just past midnight and Harry was sat curled beneath Draco’s arm leaning  in to his side. They were leaning against, what they had come to see as ‘their’ wall in the Trophy Room.
‘It’s fine honestly, you need somewhere private and I think it’s about time I did this, don’t be such a Gryffindor ,’ he said with a smirk, trying to portray an ease that he certainly didn’t feel. He didn’t think he had Harry fooled for a second. With a pang of regret Draco let Harry’s hand go and began to pace back and too, thinking that he needed somewhere for Harry to feel safe, where no one would disturb them until he felt ready to leave and face the world again.
‘Oliver,’ Harry croaked, ‘It’s the crack of dawn.’
He turned his broomstick to face Draco mid – air. He was surprised to find a smile on the boy’s face. Harry shyly smiled back.
.......
At eleven o’clock that night Harry and Hermione said goodbye to Ron and went down to the entrance hall together.
Draco looked up, silver eyes full of shock, he wasn’t sure what to do, he swallowed, ‘Truth?’ he said sticking his nose slightly in the air, attempting to affect an air of indifference.
Blaise looked up at his silver eyed friend with barely disguised concern, he was met with a trademark smirk.
Neville stared at Ron unblinkingly for what felt like an eternity, then slowly turned his head to look at Harry to find an expression mimicking his own, he turned back to Ron, ‘What?’ he asked attempting to feign ignorance, it did not work;
................
‘Really?’ Harry asked ‘ How come?’ Slowly the boys started sharing stories of Christmas’s past, each telling horror story after horror story about their lives and how and why they had never enjoyed a Christmas until today. Draco’s hands balled in to fists as Harry had told him about last Christmas, a rage boiled inside him as he heard how, on that Christmas morning Harry’s uncle had beaten him to within an inch of his life and then locked him in his cupboard for the entire day. Draco propped himself up on his arm and watched Harry telling him the story as his eyes never left the ceiling. As Draco watched, tears began to form a clear film over Harry’s eyes. Draco had never felt rage like it, he felt like his head would explode, he hoped he would get the chance to meet Harry’s uncle one day, he would make sure that the man would never forget the day he met Draco Malfoy. Harry had stopped talking and was staring at Draco, he saw something in the silver eyes that concerned him, he touched the blonde’s hand;
Draco pushed his way to the front of the crowd and his eyes opened wide as he took in the sight before him, ‘Enemies of the heir beware,’ he read out loud as his eyes fell on the hanging, immobile cat before him. Suddenly shrieking filled the hallways as Filch turned on Harry; ‘You!’ he screeched, ‘You! You’ve murdered my cat! You killed her! I’ll kill you! I’ll ...’
......
‘Drake, it was Hagrid. Hagrid opened The Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
Harry sighed and curled his feet beneath him in the overstuffed armchair he had commandeered in the middle of the Gryffindor common room, ‘What about us?’
‘Harry, where have you been?’
‘ I can talk to him at Christmas,’ as Draco spoke he noticed a look of sorrow crossing Harry’s face, ‘You ok?’
Draco nodded once as a smile spread across his face, he got up on to his knees, closing the distance between them, Harry’s eyes shuttered closed as their lips met. Lips parted and tongues danced, each hungry to taste the other. Harry rose on to his own knees and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco’s hands found themselves wrapped in Harry’s hair as he pressed further in to the kiss. Searching for want, years of want and need building up between them, but there was something Draco needed to do.
‘Okay,’ she smiled ‘just don’t get caught we can’t afford to lose any more house points.’
Draco watched Harry walk over to the bedside table and place the wooden statue of a grown dragon, fierce and proud, standing, wings spread proudly surveying its surroundings, a wooden statue that Harry would never know Draco had painstakingly carved himself by hand.
If Draco had been looking at his best friend at that moment he would have seen her mouth drop open in to a very undignified gape, ‘I can’t believe that this is actually you saying this?’
Harry was shocked again, not only was Neville’s secret friend a Slytherin but a dorm mate and more than possibly a friend of Draco’s, he wondered who it could be.
‘Well, not only did it appear in my tea leaves in Divination,’ he swallowed, ‘ I have seen it in real life, more than once,’ Harry studied Draco’s face for any reaction or signs of disbelief, when he saw none he continued, ‘ each time, as soon as I saw it, something really bad happened to me, like I saw it the other day just before I fell from the broom.’ Harry sighed and leaned his head back against the wall behind him, ‘Do you think I am doomed? Do you think it will follow me around until the day I die?’
‘That is good news.’ He said.
Draco composed himself and looked up in to the steely grey eyes of his father, he glanced back at Harry who was now having his photograph taken with the wizard and hid a small sigh, ‘Ready father.’
Severus raised his head as the pounding at his door began. As he stood it became louder and more frantic. He placed his book on the ornate side table and made his way over to the door, even in that instance the pounding stopped and there was one final, resounding thud against the solid oak.
......
‘What for?’
‘Harry?’
......
Draco sat back more comfortably on the sofa, still leaving his hand joined with Harry’s. Harry looked down at their joined hands; ‘Don’t you mind?’
......
Draco looked a little taken aback at Harry’s response so he quickly added, ‘I would be honoured.’
‘Morning,’ Blaise mouthed back, still staring back at Draco as though challenging him to comment on his unusual sleeping position.Draco winked and inclined his head slightly towards Harry, ‘should we wake them?’ he mouthed.
‘Sorry Drake,’ he mumbled.
Watching Harry fly away  had been a horrific experience but nothing compared to not being able to see him at all. Once again he felt the steady weight of Blaise at his elbow, no doubt preventing him doing something ridiculous. Draco felt like doing something ridiculous, he felt like running in the direction  Harry had gone shouting his name and hoping that the boy somehow fell into his arms.  He could see worry etched on to the faces of all the Gryffindor’s, even some of the Slytherin’s appeared concerned, but a big smile was plastered on the face of their teacher. Oh he was so dead.
At this the grey eyes filled with fear and Severus just made out the whispered words ‘what have I done?’
......
‘Now wouldn’t that be telling.’ Pansy replied with a small smile, ‘sooooo do I need to speak to Potter?’ she asked.
.......
‘There is nothing to tell you,’ he shrugged, ‘honestly it’s been another boring, normal day, in fact it would have been hard to distinguish it from any other if it wasn’t for this bloody song…’ Harry was cut off by a sharp gasp from Hermione, her hand had flown up to cover her mouth and there was a mysterious gleam in her eye. ‘ ‘Mione?’ he questioned, she shook her  head, a small smile escaping from behind her hand. Harry looked at Ron in askance and was shocked to discover a matching gleam in Ron’s eyes and a big, stupid grin on his face. Harry’s brow furrowed, he opened his mouth to question his friends when Ron finally found his voice, ‘What’s the song mate?’ Harry groaned and leaned back against his headboard as the loud rock beat bounced around his head once more. He brought his hands up to cover his face and dragged them down in exasperation. ‘It’s been in my head from the moment I woke up this morning  and it’s never left. It’s so frustrating. I just want to sing it but I can’t, it’s like the words just don’t want to come out, it gets to a certain point in my head  then starts again. It just cuts off, it’s so bloody frustrating, ugh, it’s a great tune as well, but it’s like I’m only getting half a song. Do you know what I mean?’ Harry looked up at the question and was not prepared for what he saw.  Hermione was grinning, tears pouring down her face, her eyes shone with happiness and her hands were clasped to her chest. One look at Ron showed he was not far behind, before Harry could say another word for himself he suddenly found himself with his arms full of Hermione, ‘Oh Harry, I’m so happy for you.’
‘It was me and Hedwig, the Dursley’s  locked us up, Hedwig was confined to her cage and I was locked in my room, , food was pushed through a hole in the door when they remembered and my school stuff was locked away in my old cupboard, and then , well something happened so they decided to put bars on my windows.’ Harry shrugged, unable to read the expression on Draco’s face, the hand that was not joined with Harry’s was balled in to a fist. Draco decided that if there was one thing he was going to achieve in his life he was going to make those muggles pay, one way or another. He took a deep breath and looked in to Harry’s eyes, Harry was looking worriedly at him.
Draco threw his arms out again and spun on one foot, he heard the tinkle of a bottle rolling away from him and a smash as it hit the wall. He felt as though he could feel every shard of glass, a metaphor for his life, breaking in to a million tiny pieces whilst people around him carried on without a care in the world. He opened his eyes and looked around him, the party was winding down and he was one of the only few people still dancing, he never wanted to stop; he enjoyed feeling his life blood pounding through his veins this way. He spread his arms out and spun around, kicking a stray stiletto from his path as he went; if this was as good as it got he would have to take it.
Draco ran his long fingers through his blonde hair and chuckled, ‘Yes Harry friends,’ after a few minutes of companionable chatter Draco stood up and brushed the dust from his immaculate tailor made, black and green silk dressing gown. He held out his hand to Harry, a worried look crossed his eyes as he remembered the last time he had made this gesture to Harry, he needn’t have worried Harry took his hand without hesitation and Draco helped the smaller boy up.
‘But you’re Harry Potter, you could have anyone that you chose, why would you settle for me.’
Ron thought for a second, ‘You’re right but he’ll bring back up’ moaned Ron.
‘was goin  on ere then?’
Draco shook his head in shock, ‘I don’t believe it, imagine, imagine if it hadn’t let you decide, just imagine where we’d be now.’
.......
Draco groaned at the new, more intense contact and let his head drop forward on to Harry’s chest causing Harry to let out a small giggle. Draco looked up at Harry through his fringe, ‘I always knew you would be the death of me,’ he whispered before pulling Harry forward into a heated kiss.
In the Slytherin dormitory Draco, noting the use of his nickname, sat a little straighter, took a deep breath and counted to ten before responding; ‘Go on.’
‘What’s going on here?’ came the cold, drawling voice that Harry knew so well, Harry felt his cheeks heat up, ‘Wonderful,’ he thought as the blonde head of his boyfriend appeared from around the corner. It had never crossed Harry’s mind that Draco had sent a violent dwarf after him to sing at him thus humiliating Harry in front of the whole school, he knew it wasn’t him it wasn’t his style and he was sure Draco wouldn’t do that to him, but that knowledge just made the whole situation ten times worse, knowing his boyfriend was watching as another person’s valentine was forced upon him was not the nicest feeling. Harry scrambled madly at his belongings, trying to throw them in to his bag and proceeding to scatter them further in the process he wanted to get the dwarf away, far away he especially did not need or want Draco to hear whatever it was going to sing.
Harry watched as Draco’s eyes grew wide and he visibly paled.
Then as if Ron could hear his thoughts he suddenly barged in to the hospital room, closely followed by the other Gryffindor’s, Blaise and Luna.
The war had changed him, those emerald green eyes were haunted, if the eyes were indeed the window to the soul, this was a tortured one. There was a darkness that Draco had never noticed before and an edge to everything he did and said. Draco was intrigued and, in between surreptitious glances and half-formed smiles Draco found himself falling in love, and hadn’t that been a shock to the system; ‘My only love sprung from my only hate.’ Draco guessed that Shakespeare fella (of course he was a wizard) had really known what he was talking about.
Harry placed the parchment down and went to retrieve the map from its hiding place at the bottom of his school trunk. Once he had it, he sat back on his bed, once again pulling the curtains tightly closed around him.
After the conversation with Ginny, the realisation that he fancied Draco had hit him like a charging Hippogriff. He’d acknowledged the constant need to be around him without really understanding why. Not even thinking twice when he cancelled a date with Ginny to take Teddy to the park with the blond.
‘No, Harry like he wants to…’ Ginny stopped speaking, her eyes going wide as the travelled upwards, fixing on something above Harry’s head. He turned to see what she was looking at and stopped breathing, there, in front of him, looking down at him through glistening silver eyes was Draco Malfoy. Harry felt drunk just looking at the sight before him, he could see the sweat glistening on the Slytherin’s bare chest, Draco’s shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows showing off his muscled forearms ,  the blond hair that Harry longed to run his fingers through was hanging loose, just brushing Draco’s strong jawline, Harry swallowed as he drank in the sight, mouth going dry just as Draco began to speak.
......
‘Drake,’ he said softly.
As he and Neville pulled his blankets back on to the bed Ron, Dean and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.
‘Pans why are we here?’
Harry sniffed and smiled, ‘Thanks ‘Mione.’
Harry caught Seamus’s eye and Seamuswinked.
Harry looked at Neville in shock, so he wasn’t the only one with a secret friendship, who knew Neville had it in him? Harry looked down at the one word reply that had just appeared on the parchment;
Ron stared, wide eyed at Draco, ‘You, you’d help get my sister back?’
‘But why, I’m broken?’
Harry decided he needed to say something in an attempt to placate his assuredly enraged other half.
Draco heard the chair next to him scrape across the stone floor and Pansy lowered herself in to it crossing one long leg across the other as she did so.
‘Excuse me young man but I am extremely famous for my work you know. I once fought off a ....’
Just then Draco looked up. ‘Harry look!’  he said stepping away from the Gryffindor.
‘Wow, that’s gorgeous,’ said Draco, ‘I must say I prefer mine though ,’ with that Draco pulled his own pendant from his shirt, in Draco’s palm sat a glittering silver snake with an emerald eye, ‘I love this you know,’ he smiled at Harry. Harry started as though he had just remembered something.
‘But Mione.’
Draco was a little annoyed that he didn’t know but didn’t let on. He knew Harry well and he knew Harry probably needed to hide away from unwanted attention.
‘Well shut it then ok.’
It was quarter to midnight on a Friday night and just as he done every Friday for the past two months Harry crept down the corridors after hours to meet a certain blonde Slytherin in the Trophy Room.
......
Draco was careful what he wrote as he wasn’t sure if anyone knew about the invisibility cloak.
......
Harry noticed that Draco had picked up Riddle’s diary and his heart sank. He had not had chance to tell his boyfriend about this particular find, and, if he was completely honest he wanted to keep it to himself just a little longer, he had been planning to show him that night and now Draco knew he had hidden something from him. Harry realised suddenly that he was still being watched and thought what he must look like kneeling on the floor silently watching Draco Malfoy examining one of his possessions;
Harry easily returned the smile with a warm one of his own, ‘The best ever thanks .’ he mumbled as he wrapped his free arm around Draco and pulled him closer pressing a small kiss on to Draco’s lips. A warm, content feeling spread through Draco, starting from deep in his stomach as he pulled Harry close, bringing their noses in contact with each other and Draco never wanted to move.He could quite happily stay where he was forever.
‘Well, the thing is, I might have, accidently, gone to Hogsmeade.’
Draco’s heart felt as though it had stopped, he had thought they were ok, more than ok if the kiss had been anything to go by. ‘Harry what is it?’ he asked in a quiet tone.
Harry opened the book and began to write.
As Draco stalked past the grand staircase he began to feel uneasy, and once again his pace slowed . He was still on the third floor but in an entirely different corridor, his surroundings were vaguely familiar to him, he had been here before, the pendant in his hand began to heat up and he was only just able to keep hold of it. Draco crept silently further down the corridor, the feeling of unease growing inside him. Suddenly the pendant turned sharply and Draco was face to face with a door that was more than a little bit familiar to him, ‘no’ he thought , ‘he wouldn’t,’ Draco shook his head, surely Harry would not be so stupid.
‘Well, yes’ smiled Draco, ‘ But it’s not worth risking us being friends getting back to my father, he really wouldn’t like it.’ (or would use it ) Draco thought sadly.
Harry did not want this to end in a fight and turned to look at Oliver who was slowly turning red, ‘Let them have the pitch , I want breakfast and obviously they need the practice more than us,’ he said with a small smile.
It was unfortunate for Seamus that at that moment he had chosen to take a large gulp of his drink to ease his suddenly very dry throat, at Blaise’s comment Seamus had spat his drink across the table in front of him and proceeded to have a choking fit, Neville slapped him on the back with gusto as Blaise smirked and continued with his meal.
Appeared one by one on Harry’s parchment causing him to chuckle,
‘That was amazing.’ He said.
The two men left the pensive memory and wrapped themselves in each other’s arms. This was their all time favourite memory and it had been viewed many times over fast becoming tradition to watch it on the anniversary of it happening. With a smile Harry turned to the beautiful blonde at his side he now called husband and whispered;
‘Harry you shouldn’t have , ‘Neville said as he held up a large, old looking book. ‘What is it?’ asked Blaise peering curiously at the book.
‘Dray, thank God I was so worried,’ Harry threw himself  in to his boyfriend’s arms, he wrapped his arms around the thin shoulders and hugged Draco close to him as though he was finding comfort from feeling the blond’s heart beating against his chest. Draco returned the hug for a moment relishing in the heat resonating from Harry’s body before lightly pushing Harry away. ‘Me too,’ he whispered placing a light kiss to the other boys lips,’ but I’m glad we are all here safe, and we have so much to talk about, so much to figure out, we need to help Hermione.’ Harry nodded and opened his mouth as if to say something but was interrupted by a sound from behind them;
‘Okay promise me you will talk to him, tell him how you feel, tell him how much he hurt you.’
‘Enough!’ Harry shouted, ‘It’s not Dra... Malfoy will you just leave it be.’
‘Hey!’ Harry yelled and was about to punch Draco in the shoulder playfully when he remembered. He looked at Draco, ‘I’ll owe you one,’ and with that the two boys left the room laughing.
‘Your turn Draco,’ Hermione said with a nod, ‘ who do you want to ask?’
Just then Harry noticed something move behind Harry’s head and jumped to his feet . He was looking straight in to the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog which filled the whole space between floor and ceiling. It had three heads and three snarling mouths. Instinctively Draco pulled Harry behind him, he could wonder why later, right now they needed to move. He groped for the doorknob – between Filch and death he’d take Filch.
They had just reached the seventh floor landing when Draco felt his collar gripped from behind and he was dragged in to an alcove shrouded partially by a suit of armour. Before he could even blink Pansy clamped a hand across his mouth and he looked into her wide panicked eyes. He looked over her shoulder at Blaise who seemed to be shaking slightly. He knew someone must have heard something, he strained his ears to hear past the heavy, fast paced breathing that seemed to echo loudly around the alcove. For a moment he couldn’t hear a thing and then, there it was, it was a sound like nothing Draco had never heard before, it almost sounded like something heavy was being dragged slowly across the floor outside the alcove but there were no footsteps, no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t place the sound, he just knew that the noise had made his whole body go cold, he felt as though he could feel the chills right down to his bone.
Harry jumped at the sudden sound and turned wide eyes on the blond, ‘What?’
‘Potter’
Draco was trying to watch Harry as best he could in the circumstances, he could barely see him so had absolutely no idea how Harry was going to be able to see the Snitch let alone catch it.
‘Hi’ Draco said without looking up.
Draco returned to the dungeon after dinner on the Friday night before Harry’s first game. They had agreed not to meet tonight so Harry could get an early night before his big day. Draco, meanwhile was confused, a state he seemed to find himself in a lot lately.  Slytherin and Gryffindor were going head to head tomorrow and, by rights he should be rooting for Slytherin, but all he wanted was for Harry, his friend, to catch the Snitch in his first ever game. He was lost, since he had met Harry he had constantly put his needs in front of his own. He had no idea why, he had spent many sleepless trying to figure himself out. There was something about Harry, he’d realised that the moment he had spoken to him, but he didn’t know what . Without a second thought Draco had protected Harry, and that had scared him, he was twelve years old and willing to put his life on the line for someone other than his mother. Draco had long since realised that the only time he felt truly happy was when Harry was happy, his emotions were inexplicably linked to those of the small Gryffindor.  If Draco had known what a kindred spirit was he would have known he had met one, he had never had someone that understood him the way Harry did and he didn’t even have to say anything, it was almost as though the boy could read his mind.
Draco looked at her as the memory of the morning came back to him. He could not tell her what had made him panic, he just couldn’t;
The game continued in that way for a while until they all knew each other’s favourite subjects and colours until it was Draco’s turn once more.
As Harry talked Draco stood stiffly by his side, the two boys were still holding hand, each finding comfort in the other.  Draco had watched as Hermione’s gaze had fallen on their hands and waited for her comment. Hermione had wisely chosen to say nothing, however, Draco had already decided on a few Hex’s he could use in case she dared to insinuate he was weak. She had said nothing about their hands, but the concern etched in to her face had grown as the green-eyed boy had told her what had happened to them.
‘Draco? ‘
‘Harry will you stop fidgeting’ Hermione admonished him with a stern look.
Nestled just under Draco’s right pectoral muscle was a large snake’s head, it was looking directly at Harry as though watching him with its piercing black eyes.  Its long body curled downward and around covering all the side of Draco’s ribs, the tail leading behind and then disappearing from sight as it dipped below the waist band of his school trousers; Harry longed to find out where it ended.
‘It’s an invisibility cloak,’ Draco said, trying and failing to stop his mouth hanging open.  ‘but, where? How?’
‘Potter, why are you calling him Potter?’ this was Blaise, stepping in front of Neville protectively and staring at his friend with wide brown eyes.
Draco was in a foul temper, not helped by the fact that he had not slept again with worrying about Harry. His usual bowl of cornflakes was growing soggy under his scornful gaze as he stabbed at it murderously with his spoon. Every few seconds his eyes gravitated towards the doors, never seeing what he needed to, or, more to the point, who he needed to. He was just about to look away again when the door swung open and in strode Ron Weasley with a stupid grin plastered across his face, Draco’s eyes immediately fell on the smaller boy who was following closely behind. Harry had a huge grin on his face, and Draco felt himself relax, it was obvious that Harry, although evidently tired, was in one piece. Draco watched as Harry’s eyes roved across the Slytherin table quite obviously searching for him. Draco managed to suppress a groan at Harry’s not so subtle search , whilst also noting a growing heat in the pit of his stomach at the small boys obvious need to see him. They locked eyes for a brief second, Harry’s eyes sparkled as his smile, if possible, grew even wider, Draco flashed him a quick smile back and then stared down at his cornflakes. Before Draco could look up again the sound of flapping wings signalled the arrival of the morning post, Draco had barely glanced at his own letters all his questions about Harry’s whereabouts the previous day and how he had got to school were answered as Mrs Weasley’s screeching toned filled The Great Hall. Draco’s eyes widened as he learned of their escapades, he really would have to talk to Harry about personal safety issues. Then the end of Mrs Weasley’s Howler caught his attention, ‘Ginny,’ what sort of name was that, bloody ridiculous if you asked him, Draco snorted causing him to receive a horrified look from Pansy who sitting by his side.
Draco just stared after him, he’d just literally and metaphorically bared himself to Harry, had he been so wrong about him. He trusted Harry, and Harry and taken one look and ran away from him at the first opportunity.  Draco’s face crumpled, he couldn’t believe how stupid he had been, he obviously thought a lot more of Harry than Harry did of him. Draco collapsed on the floor in a heap vowing never to let anyone near him again. Draco held his head in his hands and began to weep uncontrollably. Some Christmas, he thought.
Blaise raised an eyebrow across the dorm at Draco as if seeking permission to reply, Draco inclined his head slightly and Blaise spelled out the word
‘Hi yourself,’ smiled Draco.
Hermione raised her head from where it was buried in Harry’s chest, with a cheeky smile she looked him right in the eyes and said, ‘Hi yourself,’ it took a moment but she watched as a look of recognition passed across Harry’s face and the tips of her ears began to turn pink, he raised his eyebrows in an unspoken question and Hermione gave one, almost imperceptible nod of the head. A huge grin spread across Harry’s face causing Ron to look from one to the other like they had both grown an extra set of limbs, he would never understand them he thought with a shake of his head.
Before he could answer Harry spotted the snitch behind Draco’s head, he waited a split second too long while he decided on the best course of action, WHAM, before he knew what had happened the bludger had smacked in to his elbow. Draco looked at Harry in concern and Harry knew he was close to trying to stop the match so before Draco could utter a word he raced after the snitch and exhaled in relief as Draco gave chase, although Harry was not sure whether Draco was chasing the snitch or him.
‘Mine?’
Harry bowed as instructed but the bird did not bow in return. Draco had stepped forward before he realised what he was doing, he felt a hand on his arm and looked to see Blaise offering a cautious shake of his head. He conceded and stayed put , but he was ready to throw caution to the wind when a look of panic crossed fleetingly  across the face of their teacher. Luckily, if you want to see it like that, the bird returned Harry’s  bow before Draco had taken another step.
‘You don’t think?’
She sighed and brought a hand up to his face cupping his cheek in her palm. ‘I know, can I do anything?’
Draco wasn’t even listening, ‘He talks about me non-stop?’ he asked.
The blond head shot up in response; ‘what, no of course not, you deserve every happiness, the life and family you have now could not go to a more deserving person.’
The four students who thought of this room as their own walked over to the usual plush sofas they frequented, Pansy followed, chosing a place next to Neville and Blaise, which left Ron, through no choice of his own, sitting with Harry and Draco on the opposite sofa.
Hermione giggled at how composed Draco was attempting to be.
Harry’s new red-headed friend Ron was taking him through the finer points of a game called Quidditch when the compartment door slid open. Three boys entered  and Harry recognised the middle one at once: It was the blonde boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. Harry’s smile spread across his face as Draco fought hard with himself, he so wanted to return the smile but knew he would never live it down if he did. Harry watched Draco’s face with interest. He could not explain why but he badly wanted the silver-eyed boy to smile back, but, for the moment he was happy with the quick glint of happiness that had momentarily passed across Draco’s eyes, obviously this boy had a bit of a reputation as a hard ass. Harry inwardly chuckled and said, ‘Hey Draco.’
Draco was not happy at all. The dark was not his friend, the dark was a place of nightmares, every sound made him twitch nervously , at least in the light you could see danger coming and prepare for it. If he was honest he was terrified. He watched Harry from the corner of his eye, he seemed almost peaceful. Suddenly Harry’s fingers touched his own, he breathed in sharply at the contact but did not move his hand. He did not want to, he welcomed the contact and wanted it back. Just as suddenly he felt the smaller hand creep in to his, fingers lacing in between his own. Draco suddenly felt warm, very warm, but in a good day, like basking in the sun on a warm summers day. He liked the feeling although could not explain it. The hand fit in his, it did not feel strange or alien, it belonged, it was where it was supposed to be. Draco felt his hand being squeezed , Harry was letting him know he was there for him, Draco squeezed back, letting Harry know he was there for him to.
Draco felt the music change, a song he knew, one he loved in fact. The fire of the whiskey, pumped in his veins, he had nothing left to lose. He had nothing left, no reputation, and no home.
‘C’mon Gryffindor we better get you back before Granger reports you,’ remembering what Harry had said about the girl.
Draco entered the potions classroom and finding his seat, dropped his bag to the floor kicking it under the desk. He perched on the edge of his stool and glanced around the classroom, immediately wishing he hadn’t bothered getting up that morning. This lesson was going to torture him, as he looked up he noticed Dean Thomas walk past his usual spot and take the stool next to Weasley, this could only mean one thing, and as Draco watched his fears were confirmed and Harry walked in to the classroom. Finnegan caught his eye and patted the stool next to him and sent Harry a small smile which Harry returned as he sat carefully next to the Irish boy. Draco felt his heart plummet through the ground as Finnegan hooked his foot around the leg of Harry’s stool and pulled it closer so Harry’s arm pressed fully along his own. Draco swallowed but could not take his eyes away from what was happening in front of him, he could feel the bile rising at what he was witnessing. Draco’s eyes widened as Finnegan leaned in to Harry whispering something in his ear causing the tips of Harry’s ears to turn a vivid shade of red, he placed his hand on Harry’s lap and gave a little squeeze causing Draco to clench his own hand in to a fist digging his nails deep in to his palm to avoid making a scene. Finnegan still hadn’t moved his hand and Draco was taking deep breaths to prevent himself from getting up and forcibly removing the hand from Harry’s leg. Draco had to leave, this was too much, he stood up and grabbed his bag just as Slughorn entered the room, the portly man raised a questioning eye-brow at Draco’s behaviour but Draco continued his journey muttering something about being ill and the hospital wing.
The centaur did not answer, he stared at the scar on Harry’s forehead.
‘Harry what is it?’ he asked, his voice laced with fear and urgency.
‘Oh that’s behaving is it Malfoy..’
‘This is so hard, I want to talk to you, but you might not want to talk to me about what I want you to talk about.’
‘Erm thanks...’ Harry started.
Suddenly the door slammed shut behind them, Draco spun round and noted that the Hufflepuff's had arrived now, hopefully, they could find out what had happened now and he could seek out someone who knew where Harry was.
‘Drinks elf, Master Draco is not feeling himself.’
‘Mr Weasley is there a problem?’
‘Well,’ she said, completely disregarding the menacing glares she was receiving, ‘Imagine this if you will. I woke up early this morning to an absolute travesty, it was bordering on disaster, I went to do my hair when I remembered that I had ran out of my very expensive Italian hair styling product and I had totally forgotten to replace it , so I thought, who do I know? Who do I know  who has more hair products than the entir8e second-year girls dorm combined?’ at this she raised hey eyebrow and first glanced at Blaise then Draco staring purposely at them both in turn. ‘So, in my hour of dire need I ran, gracefully I might add, to my knights in shining armour and to my absolute horror I find both of them missing and beds not slept in , whatever is a girl supposed to do? So I woke Greg, ‘ she stole a glance at a very grumpy Goyle,’I don’t think he appreciated it very much and he informed me that you two left together in the middle of the night and. Never. Came. Back.’  Pansy began twirling her hair around her finger in an attempt to look innocent that fooled no-one, ‘so’ she continued, ‘obviously I was traumatised, so I took some  hair product anyway, you know, to just clam my nerves.’
Draco had found himself in the unenviable position of being completely surrounded by Gryffindor’s, okay so Blaise was there too but that really wasn’t the point. It was how he promised Harry that he would spend Christmas afternoon and he was sorely regretting it. After a luxurious Christmas dinner in The Great Hall he and Blaise had been escorted, by their respective Gryffindor’s,  to an abandoned classroom where Hermione was waiting with the Weasel. Hermione had greeted him with a huge hug, thanking him profusely for the rare charms text he had given her for Christmas, although he was slightly uncomfortable with Hermione’s attentions he had relented once he had seen the green pallor of Weasley’s skin at their showing of affection and gave the witch a squeeze back.
Pansy wrapped her arms across her chest and pouted  in a way only she could.
Harry shook his head.
A few more minutes went by and Draco still hadn’t responded, Harry was just starting to really worry when the parchment suddenly vibrated and Blaise’s neat script appeared before him.
‘You want to hear another secret?’
‘Follow me’....
Harry pinked a little, ‘I think I choked a little.’
'…. One casual wave if his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the Hall and good themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds if squashy purple sleeping bags.' Whatever had happened to the Gryffindors was bad enough that they were being kept out of their rooms for the night.
Harry’s had snapped around, ‘Mione, I can’t believe that you’d ask that we have only been together a week it’s still early days.’
Harry watched in confusion as Draco started undressing, but it didn’t take long for him to realise why. Every inch of his pale skin was covered in angry red welts, there was not an inch of untouched skin, the welts were raised and stood out from Draco’s back. Harry also noticed there were layers of bruising, some of  which looked like they had been there a long time. Without another word Harry turned and ran from the room.
Draco smirked at the shocked professor, ‘I knew you would be more trouble than you’re worth Incarcerous.’ The students stared as thick ropes flew from the end of Draco’s wand and wrapped themselves tightly around their Professor, Harry looked in askance at his boyfriend, Draco just shook his head, ‘I can promise you Harry you really do not want to know,’ Harry’s eyes narrowed in comprehension, the fire of hatred for a certain long haired wizard burned brighter than ever. He vowed he would get to that man, no matter how long it took.
......
Hermione’s gaze fell to the floor,
Once again Severus’s eyes grew wide as Harry rambled on, he lifted his hand to the boys elbow to silence him; ‘So what you are so eloquently trying to say is that you do see me as a father figure and would happily name me as such if you could find something that fits?’
Pansy and Harry were stumbling down the tunnel carrying an unconscious, but alive Ginny between them. Ron surged forward and swept his sister up in to his arms, supporting her behind her head and beneath her knees. Draco ran and gathered Harry in his arms, squeezing tightly and muttering something about idiots and hero complexes. Blaise gathered Pansy in to a big hug before checking her over with the critical eye of someone who cares deeply; 'Pansy your head,are you ok?' Ron's head snapped round at the question and he eyed the brunette with concern, she gave him a small reassuring smile and ran her hand down the back of her head, wincing slightly as she brushed against a tender part. 'i'm ok, let's get out of here, Ginny needs looking at'. Ron looked once more at his sister and pulled her closer to his chest, 'I know but we are trapped, we can't climb a slide, how are we getting out?' as if in answer Fawkes cried out loudly and flicked her tail towards Ron, 'I think she wants you to take it,' whispered Harry.  Cautiously Ron reached out and held the tail offered to him, after a second, when nothing happened, Harry had an idea, 'Pansy, Lockheart, grab the tail too.' He somehow knew without asking that the three other boys would want to stay with him. Pansy looked to Ron who nodded for her to put her hand on the tail, she swallowed deeply and placed her hand as close to Ron's as she could without touching, Neville gently led Lockheart to the tail. Wide blue eyes shone with glee when he saw the phoenix, 'What a pretty birdie,' garbled the man, Harry arched a curious eyebrow to Ron who shook his head lightly, signalling that this was not something that could be explained right now. As soon as Lockheart's hand touched
‘I still think you’re mad mate.’
‘I’ll get your robes,’ Harry said before running out of the room. Draco watched him go and for the first time in a very long time felt very lucky.
‘Dobby,’ Pansy called. The Malfoy’s house elf appeared, he seemed genuinely upset at Draco’s distressed state and was wringing his hands together,
......
‘Harry, it was not your fault, you don’t even know for definite that he was, and it could not have been helped anyway you could not have stopped him the boy is a little stalkerish..’ Harry cut him off, ‘Drake he’s in hospital, he might not recover don’t be mean.’ Harry pulled away as he said this staring at Draco with wide eyes as though not quite believing what was being said.
Draco caught himself twiddling his thumbs and growled in frustration. He was sitting in the Slytherin common room in an oversized black leather chair. His elbows were placed either side of him on the arm rests and his long legs were out in front of him, up on the dark mahogany coffee table, elegantly crossed at the ankles. Classes had finished for the day and Draco had removed his robe the moment he had entered the common room and flopped in to the chair he was currently sitting in. He had long ago removed his Italian leather shoes, placing them delicately on the floor at his side. His black cotton socks encased his feet in warmth as he flexed his toes to ease the day’s cramps away. With careful precision he removed his sterling silver cufflinks and placed them in the shirt pocket at his breast. Carefully he rolled his shirt sleeves to just below his elbows, smiling slightly as his bare forearms came in to view. With his left hand he reached up to loosen the knot of his tie and undo his top button. Today had been a hard day.
‘So...’ continued Draco.
Without knowing why Harry reached out and placed a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, Malfoy finally looked up at the contact and Harry’s world stopped turning. A haze fell over everything but Malfoy and his features came in to sharp contrast, Harry could hear his heart beat in his ears as he watched the man opposite open his mouth:
"So can you show me how to make flower crowns for my friends?" She again changes the subject.
When Harry came through the front door Draco's little brother Austin came running up to him hugging onto his legs. Harry picked him up
Most people gave up at this point, The Gryffindor girl was oddly determined
Pansy laid down on the bed, but for some reason she just couldn’t sleep even with now tired she was. Hermione noticed this laying down next to the other girl cuddling her. Pansy blushed hard, she thought she would definitely not sleep now.
Pansy’s love for flowers
"Hey you guys are starring again" Ron smirked
"I k-know but... he hates me.."
they spent the rest one the evening playing with Auggie, talking about how Severus and Lucius met, and joking about Sev being a father. All we can say is that they are the perfect happy family :3
Sirius rolled over giving him a weak fuck off. Remus was got off guard by how weak his puppy sounded, he felt his forehead it was burning up
Harry smiled softly and walked over to them
But today they looked.. different, were they tired... no that wasn't it they looked pale, sickly. Maybe something is spreading through the Slytherin's dorms?
After Pansy got changed she stepped out of the bathroom. Hermione blushes at how big her clothes were on the much shorter girl.
Severus was the potions teacher for hogwarts, but him and Harry Potter never got along. so what happens when the Slytherin and Gryffindor fall in love?
He wrapped his arms around his husband whispering in his ear "You’re sick"
Draco slowly nods "W-well it’s just that um-... well my father"
She quickly stops when she sees the raven haired girl pressed herself up against the wall shaking "Pl-Please don't hurt me.. whatever I did I didn't mean it!"
"There you go siri" Sirius smiled
Let’s just say, Hermione loves ‘flowers’
to make matters worse it was Lucius's day off,and they and their adopted son were supposed to go to dinner that evening. Severus got out of bed, going into his five year old son's bedroom.
Hermione blushed realizing what she had just said. “o-oh I... sorry"
"whatev-"
Suddenly Severus coughs harshly into his arm. Lucius looked up at him with concern, He loves his partner no matter how he looks... but Sev looked horrible his hair was a mess and he was very pale well except for his cheeks and nose that were flushed red.
"Pottah! What gives you the right to seek up on me while I'm sleeping! Don't touch me!"
"You laze around too much dear, boys don’t like a lady who can’t take care of the house.”
"I-I sorry for falling for you- I mean falling on you!"
Sirius yelled frustrated before he started feeling dizzy and fell into remus's arms, Who quickly catches him
So Draco forced himself and Pansy awake, They changed, did their hair, put on glimmers and set out to braved the great hall.
"O-oh hi! what's up dray?"
He started getting ready for work while his loving husband watched over him worried. He was about to walk out when his little son ran to him, Auggie knowing his father didn't often like showing weakness took the guilt tripping route.
Out of breath, and a bit put out by this point she angrily yells “Now will you tell me what's wrong!-"
"Who would do that?"
Hermione giggled at the little girl in her arms. Pansy was so embarrassed that she fell onto her crush.
She watched froze until Pansy struggled to get her wand out. The brunette finally moves lowering the other girls raised hand. .
"No I just wanted to know if you were okay... what happened..?"
"Pansy.. it's ok I'm not gonna hurt you"
Pansy is exhausted, Hermione does something about it
Harry wraps his arms around him as Draco sobbed into Harry's shoulder, He gently rubs circles onto the sobbing boys back.
Everything went dead quiet which made Severus very uncomfortable to say the least. Until Auggie said
"Oh Pansy dear you've gained weight"
"You looked sad.. so I came to find you" He said kneeling down next to his step father "harry isn't gonna hurt me sev"
Both were so hungry, however the comments made by their parents sucked away any desire for food they had left. Harry and Hermione were more than a bit worried.
"Yeah they're really great.. they've done so much for me... and they don't make fun of me for liking flowers"
"Sirius I'm serious you're sick" Sirius rolled his eyes
"Sirius you're burning up!"
"..he didn't-"
Sev stares at his husband sadness in his eyes "H-He hates me Lucy!"
The little boy used the puppy eyes he knew his dad could never say no too. He of course said yes and got into some pjs. A little later Austin and Lucy laid asleep cuddled together. Despite Lucius being at full health and well rested, apparently his husband can sleep whenever. (Lucky bastard-) Severus never being the type of person to relax growing up in a strict and abusive household wandered into the kitchen to get some water to hopefully soothe his throat.
"Hello Harry, we have a surprise, the person I’m dating is someone that you already know" The older Malfoy said as he revealed his husband for behind him.
Harry looked to Draco confused "who?"
"It's not! I think they're pretty, can you show me how you made them?" ‘Mione said kneeling down next to her
“Are you sick? You're very red"
Pansy jumped quickly turning around ".. granger? What are you doing here?"
His son agreed and Sev walks to his and his husband's room
"y-yes"
he was cut off when he sneezed again. Remus cuddled him in his arms “ok puppy now get some rest ok?" Sirius nods and sniffles, a couple minutes later soft snores came from the dog.
Pansy and Draco had a tough weekend. Harry and Hermoine notice
"Draco.. calm down you're safe I just wanna know what happened so I can help alright?"
"I'm s-sorry Lucy... you were supposed to relax.. and instead you have to take care of me..."
“....o-ok"
"I'm not your puppy!"
"Well I do" She states matter-of-factly
"Mommy! Can you help me make-" a hand rose before a hot flash of pain hit her cheek.
From where Hermione was she couldn’t quite make out what the person was doing. But it seemed like flower crowns sat next to the person.
“Ah.. thank you” Moine blushed looking away “um.. w-who are these for?" She said pointing at the other crowns, quickly changing the subject.
"dad?"
Then they got into Hermione's dorm, she set Pansy on the bed and gave her some clothes to wear
After Pansy finally stopped shaking and her tears slowly stopped. Hermione took her hand and walked her back to the Gyriffindors dorms.
Lucy held him tighter "I will always rather take care of my Two sick babies” ❤️
Severus was sitting in his classroom grading papers. he had just found out that his step son Draco although he feels like his actual son, was dating Harry James Potter. He wasn't mad at Draco of course, but he was worried that Harry would break up with Draco because of him. He knew it was a silly thought, but he couldn't help think it. Just then Draco came through the door
The night when on like that for the rest of the time. The parents going on and on about every little thing about the pair. They both tried desperately to fight back, Coming out with more bruises, then they started with.
“...M-my parents and Draco's parents had a party and.. they made comments about us and hit us and-"
after some fussing Lucy helps his sick husband to the bed and climbed into it as well. He held his son in his arm and put his husband in his chest.
Pansy's black hair fell to the edges of her face, framing it perfectly. Hermione couldn’t help herself, she kissed her on the forehead.
Ron looked over the girl's shoulder "They- look like they had a rough morning.."
Harry was even more confused than before, until Austin ran out of his arms and hugging on to Sev's legs yelling
"yup and I'm your uncle and.." he looked up at Sev and speaking softly "your son-in-law"
The magic being a glimmer fell. Revealing bruises and cuts across Pansy's face and body. Hermione’s eyes widen, she was speak-less. All she was able to do was stand there
"Sev! It's going to be alright he's a hero not a murderer!"
"Uh well.. making.. um... flower crowns.. I know it's weird and kinda lame but-"
He already knew the answer but he wanted his son to say it.
"Or... you could help me..?"
Hermione slowly moves towards her, as to not to scare the shaking girl in front of her. As she got closer, she sensed a strong magic coming from Pansy. But her magic seemed to be.. struggling? It must be happening because of how worn out the other is.
"You didn't think I would let you go to class exhausted did you?" Pansy blushed
The Gryffindors sit at their table, having breakfast. Ron was stuffing his face like usual. and Hermione who had eaten earlier, was reading a book.
“Yeah about that... my father isn't with my mother anymore he's.. with someone else"
"Your face is all red baby"
"Why did you do that-" Pansy was cut off by hermoine picking her up
"Y-yes mother" Pansy walked back  inside crying
Harry turned to ‘Mione "we should talk to them after breakfast" she nodded
After drinking the water, he put his head up against the fridge, it feeling nice on his feverish skin. He didn't hear it but Lucius had rounded the corner awaken by Sev leaving the bed.
One day Pansy was exhausted, she had cramped for a test the night before and she was really feeling it now.
"See this is why you rest when you're sick".
"I'm sorry papa n-now we can’t go to dinner"
‘Ok ok I get it.’ Blaise said quickly cutting Harry off full flow, ‘Draco show them what I got you.’
Ginny laughed at Harry’s distracted response, ‘Harry, where are you, you look a thousand miles away?’
‘It’s in my trunk,’ he hissed again at Blaise, ‘Give me yours,’ Draco thrust his hand out expectantly.
Ron met his stare with steely determination and a slight incline of his head, ‘Right, what do we do?’
‘Truth or dare?’
been prevented.'
‘Now watch,’ Harry slowly walked around the room. Draco was open mouthed, as he watched, the pendant slowly turned to point in Harry’s direction and then proceeded to follow him around the room.
‘Well this is....’
As Neville had spoken Draco had become more and more interested in what he was saying and had leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees, ‘Anything?’
‘He’s  what?’
‘’Just a Pumpkin Juice please.’
Harry smiled as the words appeared, it felt nice to have someone listen to him, believe him and take his word for things but there was a question nagging at him so he carefully formed the words on the parchment,
Harry had kept eye-contact with the swirling pools of silver and grey, he could see the earnestness with which Draco spoke, he knew, for no reason but that, that he could trust the other man. Without a word he nodded, knowing he wasn’t going to like what came next.
‘No Harry, no buts, no what ifs, this time you need to just do it, it’s now or never, what have you got left to lose? You may never see him again after tomorrow. Would you ever forgive yourself?’
Harry glanced at Neville who looked just as confused as he felt.
Draco cast his mind back to the Friday before, Halloween, he remembered he had just arrived back in the dungeons after being escorted back because apparently there was a bloody great troll making itself at home somewhere in the castle. He had just slumped into and armchair and thrown both his legs over the arm when he overheard a conversation between two second year girls;
The last thing he saw as the train pulled away from the platform was a very panicked looking Mrs Weasley crumpling in to her husband’s arms.
powerful magic took hold of him. Draco placed a supportive hand on his shoulder as he stared in awe at the red-headed Gryffindor.
Harry stifled a chuckle,’ Draco you frightened Ron to death, he thought you were dying, he was screaming for me to wake up and help you.’
‘Hermione it was standing on a trap door.’
Harry looked in wonder at the blonde boy sat on his left,
‘Harry, I want to, plus I need to top the present that you got me last year,’ Draco replied with a smirk.
‘Well that’s just childish.’ Said Draco with a ahuff.
As Harry was lost in these thoughts, Draco came to a sudden halt. He had seen a puddle of silvery liquid glinting in the sparse moonlight that had managed to filter through the knotted together tree branches. He had known what it was immediately, Hagrid had told them what to look for, it was unicorn blood.
In his hour of need he had turned to the twins, after listening and accepting as only they could, (lots of alcohol and well-meant gay  jokes) they had offered him an interesting piece of advice, ‘The only way to get over one man was to get under another.’ Harry had laughed with them, deciding not to break the news of his virginity. There is only so much time in the world and fighting a raging psychopath had taken up most of Harry’s. Also the realisation that he wasn’t actually physically attracted to his girlfriend didn’t help matters one bit. But then came Seamus, this bubbly, bouncy personality who was decidedly easy on the eye. The Irish man had practically thrown himself at Harry and Harry had taken the metaphoric bull by the horns and dove right in.
‘Hey Seamus you ok?’
‘He’s what?’ snapped the voice of a very familiar blonde.
Draco became serious as he took Harry’s hand once more, ‘No you don’t , the boy who lived gets plenty of praise, but what I said, well that praise was for plain old Harry, my danger loving best friend.’
Appeared from Blaise
‘Is it true?’ Draco looked in to Harry’s eyes. Harry looked confused so Draco continued , ‘They’re all saying that Harry Potter is in this compartment. So iit’s you, is it?’
‘Don’t call me babe, you call him babe.’
Just then he heard something that made his mind up for him.
Ron had filled his parchment with tiny doodles of snitches and Chudley Canon logos when he felt the tickling begin on his shin, absent-mindedly he began to rub his shin with the toes of the other foot but the tickling increased and soon it had spread to the other shin, glancing down Ron’s heart stopped. Due to the warmer weather Ron had forgone his robes so had a clear view of his shoes and climbing over his shoes were eight tiny spiders that were crawling up his socks and up the legs of his trousers, Ron was terrified. He shoved his chair back so hard he slammed in to Harry’s table behind him winding the raven-haired boy, Ron jumped to his feet and began jumping up and down, whimpers were escaping from his lips as McGonagol turned to see what the commotion was about;
Harry got himself up and stormed past Ron up the stairs to his dorm room, he flung himself on his bed fighting back the tears burning in his eyes, he thought Ron was his friend, he thought he was safe away from the Dursley’s. Harry didn’t know what to think, he needed to see Draco, he needed his friend.
Harry thought, ‘Does it show us what we want?’
‘Why what?’
‘It was my father’s ‘ shrugged Harry not knowing what else to say. ‘ I got it for Christmas but i don’t know who sent it.’
‘You’re hilarious, but to be fair it wasn’t exactly a quidditch injury was it?’
That broke the mask of ice that the Slytherin wore so well as he looked at Harry with a look of joy splashed across his face. ‘You really are something special,’ Draco mused.
‘Hi yourself’ said Draco in a way that reminded Harry of the first time that they had met at Madam Malkin’s. Harry chuckled and walked over to Draco;
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging in to their classes.. and eventually one caught up with Harry..
Harry turned and looked at Ginny, then back at Draco with a confused look on his face, ‘Malfoy what on earth are you going on about?’
As soon as the door closed the hall was buzzing with the Gryffindors who had moved to see their friends from other houses and were beginning to fill them in on what had happened.
‘Mmmmm?’ Draco replied looking back at his books.
‘Yeah I’d like to do Draco’s last.’
‘Drake,’ he said, louder this time. Draco mumbled and opened his eyes, ‘Shit!’ he said as he sat up abruptly .
‘Will you have me? Will you let me be yours?’
‘Everything ok? you look completely lost in thought there.  I’m not even sure you knew I was in the room.’ Harry shrugged and leaned the side of his head gently against his boyfriend’s  strong jaw,  shocked to feel the first beginnings of stubble against his skin. ‘Mmm just thinking about Sirius, you know wondering how he is, if he’s ok, is he safe, wondering if he’s freezing. ‘
Draco was stretched out luxuriously on the sofa in the Slytherin common room, he loathed to admit it but his feet were sore from all the trudging around Hogsmeade in the deep snow all day. However, it had been worth it as he had managed to finish the rest of his Christmas shopping and had secured a big bag of Harry’s favourite sweets to cheer the boy up. He hadn’t actually managed to speak to Harry yet and found himself wondering how the other boy was feeling after spending all day cooped up in the castle alone. He had felt bad leaving Harry, but the other boy had insisted.
Harry chuckled, ‘I think I can manage that, I don’t think it will be too much of a chore.’ As he raised an eyebrow at Draco. Draco glared at him, but he was enjoying this light hearted moment between friends, he felt like he fit in, even just for a moment, plus, he thought, he really needed to have a chat with Blaise about Finnegan, that would be an interest chat. Just then Madam Pomfrey appeared and shooed them all out of the room.
Neville continued, ‘They used them to communicate when they were on Auror missions and even more so when my mum stayed home pregnant with me so she knew dad was ok.’
A new term was beginning at Hogwarts and Hogwarts now had an 8
‘Ok, Malfoy, I want another chance to do a better one, truth or dare.’
‘Do not play dumb with me Draco you know exactly what I am talking about, I just don’t understand you, I know exactly how you feel about him...’
Harry took his time in answering,
The following Tuesday saw Draco staring incredulously at Harry as he explained the voice that he had heard  in detention with Lockheart.
.....
Draco paled visibly, ‘Yes,’ he said shortly, sitting up stiffly. Harry felt Draco’s body language change, ‘What?’ he asked, ‘come on, tell me.’ Harry implored, shifting round on to his knees to get a better look at his boyfriend. Draco turned to face Harry, ‘What do you know Harry?’
‘I made the Quidditch team , I’m on the house team.’
‘It better be,’ laughed Draco, not sure whether or not he wanted Harry to fully understand the implication of his words, Draco just knew that he didn’t want Harry to ever wake up in anyone else’s arms he simply would not allow it.
Draco sat bolt upright and scrabbled to pull his quill from his school bag.
Harry’s face lit up, ‘You sure?  That’s great.’ Harry said with a smile as he walked over and slid down the wall to sit next to Draco.
Draco dropped his head in to his hands once more, ‘I couldn’t let it go on, I knew it was him that day, he had to go he had to end it.’
......
...............................................................................................................................................................
Draco felt something was wrong, he just couldn’t out his finger on it, his stomach felt unsettled and a chill ran over his body, the pitch was eerily silent despite the wind and rain that was whipping around his head. He felt the cold all at once, a new kind of bone deep cold that no cloak could protect him from. Draco desperately searched the skies for Harry knowing instinctively that something was not right with him.
Draco’s eyes widened at this confession.
Neville suddenly found the back of his hand very interesting, ‘Crabbe and Goyle.’ He said quietly.
Harry chuckled to himself as Hermione marched in to the room completely unaware of Harry’s bet with himself. She sat gracefully at the end of his bed, leaning against the footboard crossing her legs in front of her. Ron came around to the other side and mirrored her position. Harry raised an eyebrow at them (he was getting quite good at that). Hermione took the lead as Harry had expected her to, ‘So we’ve noticed you’ve been a bit, shall we say, absent and distracted today and were wondering if you wanted to talk about it,’ she exchanged a quick glance with Ron  and they looked at Harry in anticipation. Harry looked back at them feeling nothing but confusion, ‘guys I have no idea what you are talking about.’ Hermione’s eyes filled with pity, ‘come on Harry you can tell us.’
‘Mr Potter, once again, will you kindly desist with the drumming.’ Harry slowly looked up from where he had been using his wand to drum a rhythm against his leg, ‘Sorry Professor.’
‘Well obviously it’s a jumper Zabini,’ replied Harry coolly as he smoothed his hands over the golden ‘H’ on his jumper.
‘Oh by the way Weasley, the answer to your last question is, of course, yes.’
‘Draco,’ he said quietly, ‘you don’t need to do this.’
Harry spotted a small blonde boy at the back of the shop. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length,
.....
Draco lay on his bed listening to the horrific sounds of snoring coming from the bed next to him. For Christ’s sake he thought ‘I’ll be seeing Father about this, I’m Draco Fucking Malfoy I shouldn’t have to share with these bloody buffoons. Ugh he’d have to remember to send an owl to his father in the morning, but for now, he had something else to think about, he was getting to spend some time with Harry, some time where he could just be himself and he couldn’t wait.
‘It’s no problem, he wanted you and I had a way of making it happen.’
‘ I know I do,’ said Neville shyly , ‘As do I.’ Agreed Blaise.
‘I have not really thought about it if I’m honest,’ he said quietly, ‘However now you mention it I do believe that your idea of us joining the 7
‘Weasley has had a bit of a spider issue today Professor,’ came the cool drawl of Blaise Zabini, ‘So I think the prospect of spider’s legs has terrified him.’
‘Tonight, if you want. Midnight all right? I’ll meet you in the Trophy Room it’s always unlocked.’ Draco continued looking at Harry. Harry nodded in reply he’d be there. Draco walked out of The Great Hall with a small satisfied smile on his face. ‘Clever bugger’ he muttered.
‘Who?’ Harry interrupted, ‘Who’s the certain someone?’
‘Try not to think about it mate,’ Ron whispered. ‘I agree Harry, I’m sure he is fine, I can’t help wondering why he risked breaking in to the castle though. Something must be worth the risk of detection – and destroying the Fat Lady’s portrait – there's clearly something we’re missing.’
‘You getting up?’
Neville regarded the offered hand as though it was a lion about to maim him, but, realising that there was no one else about to witness any humiliation that would doubtless come his way, he summoned every ounce of his Gryffindor courage and placed his hand in Blaise’s, to his immense surprise and relief the warm hand closed around his own and he was pulled to his feet.
Draco rolled over on to his front moving Lyra in to the crook of his elbow once again catching the alluring scent of his boyfriend. He talked long in to the night has Harry filed him in on his side of events. He eventually fell asleep with visions of beautiful green eyes in his dreams knowing he would get to see Harry soon.
some introductions may be in order. As your headmaster Albus Dumbledore, I welcome all students new and old to another year at this fine school of ours.”
Clumsy Potter blind as a bat even with his glasses had held onto his arm harshly while stumbling in the dark and Draco had been too amused to leave.
Like most of the studio rooms this one was painted in white and gold when not surrounded by mirrors. Harry could see three other older students stretching at a barre but they paid him no mind. He turned from them and placed the boxes in a cabinet Penelope had gone over to before standing in silence.
Cedric was right about one thing. The world was changing. Harry could feel that within himself. He's never been much of an ambitions person but here he was
With the relief of finding his brother's friend safe Cedric didn’t try to speed down the roads again and instead cruised along allowing the quiet radio to fill in the silence.
Potter scowled. “You were eavesdropping!”
“How’d you feel about some hot chocolate?”
"Harry!" His fathers voice boomed throughout the hall.
Harry found himself starting most of his days doing things he was not supposed to. He was aware of the arse kicking he’d get if his older brother found out he was using his records without permission. He wasn’t scared though. It was hard to be when music surrounded him and he just
Cedric joked. “He’s probably gone off to join the circus buy the love of some pathetic girl. just follow him next time.”
Miss was trying to push him, teach him more than he could possibly learn. She was starting to worry and it showed. The audition was coming up and she was
regal. Cedric had once told him it looked as if he'd been made of porcelain that has been cracked and put back together. Harry figured that analogy made more sense as the actual cause of the scar had been an empty bottle being smashed on his forehead when he was merely a babe.
Harry paused before he touched the record player. “Why do you call me that?”
“How’d you know my name?” He asked, confused.
“—Nah it’s alright.”
The rest of the day was spent getting students accommodated and sorted out. Harry who hadn't the need to ask for any help found himself wandering. The school was covered in red as the sun set above coloured hills and Harry walked around the grounds curiously. He found he quite liked the place. The school was so obnoxiously large he could walk for minutes and not stumble into a single person. It was like the whole world had gone quiet and all he could hear was music he vaguely recognised.
Originally written September 2020
It ended with simple and strong steps and carefully placed arm movements before spinning back around to face him. His face red with anger with one arm to the sky and one arm folded to his heart.
He was then surprised to find one other than
Before he could however Draco turned his head away and lifted his chin up. “Of course not Father, don't be ridiculous. I told you. A school of this calibre would never tolerate a student with such violent tendencies.”
“You think he can get in?”
Harry’s head whipped back. “Hey!”
“Why are you afraid of fire?”
light.
Seamus looked on. “You're a bird!”
Harry put his head up.
Harry stilled. The boy turned to him. “Hello, Nerve racking isn’t it?”
He can almost see these mind paintings. They're factual in that sense. He knows that
“No, from back home.”
Once the car had been safely delivered back to its owner the three made their way to the house. Popping open the old gate Cedric showed them in. Draco seemed to avoid eye contact and promptly looked towards the photo mantle.
“I think it is. You're alright with it?”
“They don’t know.”
“Now wait a minute—”
Draco didn’t bother to stop his practise as he addressed them, though his grip on the barre tightened.
After that they seemed to stare at his scar and pushed back Harry's fringe. "Does that cause you any pain?"
“Where are you from?”
“Not now not after everything we’ve been through!”
“Harry will be there.”
He was going to be stuck here he's sure of it. His world seemed to crumble around him and his aching glossy eyes begged to whomsoever could hear.
Harry would have argued he technically wasn't a '
Seamus shakes his shoulders. “Less people to mess up in front of.”
