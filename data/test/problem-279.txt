“Here… you are…. Mr… Potter,” he wheezed.
“It was.” Draco answered truthfully.
“Wait, you’re leaving right this second?” Potter shot to his feet as well, mouth dropping open with something akin to dismay. He held out a hand imploringly. “You really don’t have to.”
almost killed Wea- Ronald that sixth year. And I’m so sorry about what Greyback did to your brother. I’m sorry your friends were imprisoned in our dungeons and I’m sorry the rest of you had to go through all of the Carrows’ sick games.” He paused for a breath but before he could continue, Ginny gave him a hard punch to the arm.
More voices came from the hallway and Draco sighed. It was like a Weasley reunion was happening right here in the playroom. Sure enough two more Weasley brothers strolled in, the pompous one who he remembered as being headboy, and the one that worked at Gringotts. Draco winced as he took in the man’s scarred face, though the scars did nothing to take away the fact that the man was gorgeous. Draco blinked.
supposed to mean?”
“Draco, you don’t look well.” Harry reached out towards him and Draco instinctively flinched back.
For a thrilling moment it looked like the smile was going to leave Bob’s face and Draco waited with bated breath. To his disappointment though, Bob seemed to compose himself quickly and managed to maintain his grin. “No problem, Mr Potter.” He scooped a few handfuls out of the bag into a much smaller one and sealed it. “Here you are.”
Before any more could be said, Potter returned, breathing heavily as if he’d run back. He regarded them both suspiciously but Weasley was busily blowing up a balloon and looking convincingly as if he’d been doing that the whole time. Draco had to admit, he was craftier than he’d given him credit for.
“Lily!”
“I promise to make it up to you
Potter didn’t respond for a while, and then Draco saw his shoulders lift in a shrug. “I was just about to head home.”
Draco paused for a moment, swallowing around the lump that had formed in his throat. “I didn’t want to do anything to mess up, and then I find out that there was nothing to mess up in the first place. And I should have been happy, right? Instead, the realisation that there was nothing to stop us being together terrified the shite out of me.”

“Well, he does have a fantastic arse.” Pansy shrugged. “Can’t say that I blame him.”
doing here?”
Draco swallowed. “I’m sorry… about Fred.” he blurted out and then he could have kicked himself for it. He had no idea why he’d just said that.
Making his way down to the kitchen, Draco finally felt some of the tension leaving his shoulders. It had been more discomforting than he’d thought, seeing Potter with Ginny, and to his great shame, he’d been rather cold to her as he tried to mask his jealous feelings. He’d noticed her giving him worried glances all night and it made him feel like the worst of bastards.
Harry rolls his eyes. “I’m pretty sure what you’re doing could be considered harassment, and I don’t want her calling the cops on us.”
Potter flushed a pretty pink. “You’ll find Al is to blame.” he replied with a weary shake of the head. He’s hidden somewhere in
“I’m going down for a glass of water,” he called out to Potter, making for the stairs. Potter offered a distracted grunt in response.
“Welcome back, darling! Did you have a nice time with Ginevra?”
“Stop calling me ‘Draco’, you bastard!” Draco yelled, sorely tempted to throw something else at him. “And what
Draco smiled fondly at the two of them, feeling a sense of déjà vu about the whole thing. To think, the last time they’d assaulted him like this, he’d wanted to shake them off and beat a quick getaway. He opened his mouth to ask them where their dad was when another voice spoke up.
He sounded completely sincere and it confused Draco so much. He couldn’t understand why Potter was pursuing him when it was so obvious that he still loved Ginny.
Potter gave a bark of laughter.
Draco smirked. “I think I look smashing.”
“It’s quite invigorating,” his mother continued. “Takes up more energy than I initially thought. Of course we could always use magic, but Dromeda says that it tastes better when they’re made the Muggle way. She said she’d teach me to bake a cake next time!”
“Goodnight Draco.” Potter said softly with a smile, letting go off his hands and taking a step back.
“The doggy was pretty scary.” James admitted. “But Dad, you looked funny when you were up that tree.”
Draco held Luna close, snuggling his head into the crook of her neck as he let the familiar scent of rose water wash over him. He sighed, and then hid a smile in her hair as her phoenix feather earring tickled his cheek. It felt good to hold her like this again. When he finally let go he was sure he had a sappy grin on his face, but as always Draco knew that with Luna he could let down his mask with no hesitation. The petite witch got on her toes in an attempt to kiss his forehead but even so he still had to bend down for her to reach. She gave him a loud smack and patted his hair gently, a wistful smile on her face.
“Oh tosh, it isn’t exclusive like that. Anyone is free to come. There’ll be free food anyways.” she said with a laugh.
Draco hardly registered Ginny’s indignant cry of “
“Yes, sweetheart?”
“No,” Draco gasped, and shook his head vigorously. “Just here to play Quidditch and then leave. Eat some of Molly’s cooking too. She’ll never forgive me otherwise,” he said in a rush. The older man let out a deep chuckle.
He looked up to find his friends regarding him with worried expressions. He bit back a laugh. For all their scandalous behaviour and quirks, Blaise and Pansy resembled nothing more than a pair of doting parents when they looked at him like that. He shook his head.
“Sorry,” he murmured with chagrin.
James called Teddy over to tell him something just then and Potter sidled over to walk next to Draco. “So,” he began. “Bonding with Teddy?”
know that everyone at Hogwarts knew about your little crush on her,” Draco replied with an incredulous frown. “You were
“Alright, I’m… sorry.”  She didn’t look convinced though so he tried again. “Luna I really am sorry, but I’m back now aren’t I?”
“What are you doing here?” Draco snapped, wanting to get away from Harry as fast as he could, but finding himself unable to move.
“That’s because I wasn’t,” he replied dryly. “I didn’t really have much of a choice in the matter at the time, but I might return it in the evening if I can.” Hopefully Bob’s shift would be over by then.
,” he grumbled. “One last look before I hole myself away again.”
Ginny shot him a flat look. “Isn’t it bad form to think about the worth of other people’s vaults?”
The twin Weasley gave a low whistle as he took the room in. Roxanne rushed over to him and began to show off her hair which Draco had done in small braids before tying it all back in a low ponytail.
It had been a week since Teddy’s birthday and as he’d asked of him, Potter hadn’t tried to contact him in any way; no owls, no Floo-calls, no unexpected visits. Draco knew he had no right to feel hurt by Potter’s desertion,
“If it bothers you so much, Weasley, I can go change,” Draco said as he got up from bed. “Would dress robes suit his majesty?”
“Huh? Well they look good on you.” Potter smiled.
“No.” Lily was adamant as she clung to Draco as if her life depended on it.
do it this time, instead of you, I should be fine. Merlin Harry, couldn’t you have transfigured them into something even remotely attractive?”
“I’d have thought it impossible,” she began slowly. “But I think you may have gotten paler.”
from the Manor itself, but Luna always enjoyed the walk down to the gates. She said it always left her invigorated for some reason.
.” Bob smiled even wider when he said this and Potter backed away slightly in alarm. Draco had to agree. The man was really starting to creep him out too.
Draco cut into Potter’s rambling. “I really don’t care about what will or will not happen to your bollocks.”
“Your face! Your face when he grabbed you! And– and–
Weasley snorted. “Don’t be an arse, Malfoy.”
“You genuinely liked potions.” Potter said, looking as if he could hardly comprehend the notion.
“Malfoy?”
“Potter, please…”
“I’m glad you’ve made a friend, Mother,” Draco said honestly.
.” He gestured to the robes. “I’m surprised your presence didn’t lure him out.”
“It’s at least preferable to James’ thankfully short-term use of ‘pops’.” Draco said with a shudder at the memory.
Draco arched an eyebrow. “In Eeylop’s?”
“Draco?”
, I hope you’re happy about this.”
The best thing to do now, he concluded logically, was to completely wash his hands of the matter, and he was sure that in a few more days he’d be right as rain again. He’d invite Ginny to go out shopping with him and would forget all about be-speckled prats with stupid hair and abysmal fashion sense.
to your room? He’ll want to settle in.”
Draco also got up, confused. “What?”
Draco threw his hands in the air and made an explosive noise that was pure frustration. “You can all thank your precious boy-hero for these,” he groused in a loud voice, gesturing viciously to his whole neck, which was apparently quite a sight if everyone couldn’t seem to stop
Draco gave a strained smile. His mother had been doing this more and more often these days; making barbed remarks about Lucius. She still hadn’t forgiven him for the hell he’d landed their family in, but most of all, Draco thought she was angered by the Mark that still marred his left arm. It had stopped moving the moment Voldemort had been defeated, but even after almost a year, it was still plainly visible against his pale skin. Faded, but still there – an ever-present reminder.
“You’re telling me.”
“Your mum’s pretty different from how I expected,” Ginny spoke up, and Draco opened his eyes to see her nodding towards the inside of the cottage. “I used to think she didn’t know how to smile, let alone laugh.”
“Blaise spares no expense when he has a scheme in mind,” Draco answered with a fond smile. “One day he took me to the beach and then disappeared to Salazar knows where, leaving me awkwardly sitting under my umbrella, valiantly trying not to get too sunburnt. With nothing better to do, I people-watched. There were some
“I’ll take it off once I leave,” Potter added, somewhat defensively.
Potter seemed amused by his topic, smile widening into a proper grin. “Yeah, I’m a morning person if that’s what you’re going for. I had to wake up really early when I was a kid, and I got so used to it that I can’t really enjoy a long lie-in even now. That is, unless I’ve tired myself out the night before,” he added with a wicked grin.
“That was a delightful turn of events,” Narcissa said as soon as Draco landed them in the foyer. "Molly is a lovely witch and I confess I’m glad Lucius isn’t here to spoil this friendship for me.”
“Well, he was more a man, really,” Draco offered up hesitantly, deliberating over just how much he was willing to divulge. Potter’s eyes were wide and he watched Draco with rapt attention, the carousel momentarily forgotten. “It was the summer after Fifth year. I was in a snit with Lucius off in prison so Blaise decided to kidnap me and take me for an impromptu trip to the Mediterranean.”
“No, this doesn’t give out smoke seeing as how it isn’t a coal burning train. It runs on electricity.”
“I couldn’t resist.”
Potter rubbed his head with a grimace. “I can now see why the two of you get on so well.”
Potter frowned. “Wait, that’s all you did?
“And Gregory, have you heard from him lately?”
“Ferret face.”
“Oh? And how would you have reacted if you were in the shower and, let’s say…
taste, and Draco would have to rinse his mouth out thoroughly when he was done. He didn’t know how Potter could stand the unusual flavour without so much as a grimace.
They ate in silence except for the occasional remark about how good the food was. Merlin, he wondered at the Weasleys not being fat as stuffed pigs if they ate this kind of food every day. When they were done, Draco leant back on his hands with a contented sigh.
Charlie guffawed. “You can’t be serious. The kid’s name is actually ‘Draco’?”
obvious about it all. Shame you got no action in the end though.”
“Who is it?” a voice called from somewhere inside and the Weasley matriarch was soon before him, wiping her hands on her apron.
“I was just thinking…” Potter trailed off, biting his lip for a moment before continuing. “Since I’m at home all day now, you’ve been coming here first thing in the morning and leaving late.”
“Again, I am aware of that.”
“Do you have him tomorrow?”
“Last time I ever try the SPEW way.” Weasley clenched his jaw stubbornly and shot Granger a look.
.” Fleur replied. “Per’aps you would like to meet ‘er again?”
“Just so you know,” Harry had a face of utter seriousness, though his eyes glittered mischievously. “Ginny’s getting married to Neville, not me.”
. Draco tried to swallow with difficulty, mouth bone-dry.
Potter suddenly snorted into his spoon and stew splashed back into his bowl with a wet
Draco nodded and followed her down to the ground. He dismounted his broom and winced as his sore muscles made themselves known. He’d need a long hot bath when he got home.
“I’m not sad.”
“I like to consider myself
“I see.”
His eyes had saddened now. “I don’t know why it happened, but one day I woke up and when I looked at Ginny, her back turned towards me like she always did, I realized that I couldn’t remember the last time she’d slept in my arms. After that, it was just one thing after another. I noticed that we never shared those fond looks like Ron and Hermione. We hardly even talked anymore, and when we did it was always about something involving the kids. We’d not even properly made love since the night Albus had been conceived.”
Harry grinned. “The Italian place by the bakery?”
“Why, were you afraid my brothers would eat you?” she asked with a laugh, leading him to sit out on the veranda overlooking the fields behind the house. “I’m pretty sure none of them have a taste for ferret so you needn’t worry.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Potter, you’re mere presence makes my skin crawl.”
They’d reached the shop now and even inside, Harry stuck to Ginevra’s side. Lily had wanted to be with her father too so she was now seated on his shoulders. The boys after realizing that Draco wasn’t in a conversational mood, had also drifted to their parents and as Draco watched the family interact, he felt an ache inside him. Harry and Ginevra were laughing over something while Lily played with her mother’s long hair, tickling Harry’s face with it. James and Al were trying to be helpful by bringing over perfumes to smell and they’d tug on both their parents’ sleeves to get their attention. Draco watched from the other side of the shop as one would watch a film.
despite his height. Draco has both hands clasped over his mouth and his eyes are so wide that there is a perfect ring of white around his grey irises. He’s trembling violently and fat tears keep spilling over his lids and streaming down his cheeks in a seemingly never-ending stream.
“Difficult to let go of old habits.”
“Of course I’m still having trouble with it. This wand never chose me and I have no connection to its previous owner either since Grandmother Druella died before I was even born.”
Potter looked completely lost and held out his hands helplessly. “Why don’t you lead the way?”
“Yes, I suppose they do.” Luna said serenely. “Anyways, do get dressed or we’ll be late.”
Draco gave an anguished exclamation and pulled his head out of the flames again, flopping onto his back with a loud groan. He wondered if he’d be able to self-obliviate himself without ending up in the Janus Thickey ward.
Potter immediately averted his eyes cagily and Draco’s mouth dropped open.
“I already sort of like them, and anyways, you’ll have to get used to mine too so we’re even.”
,” he murmurs, giving Draco a light smack to the arse, pleased by the delicious little squeak it elicits.
Draco nudged Harry. “Like father, like son.” he said and Harry laughed.
He glanced at the shop windows idly as he passed, contemplating whether his mother would like some pastries for tea. He’d just made up his mind to visit the new patisserie that had opened beside Flourish and Blotts when two small forms bludgeoned into him with the force of a couple of bludgers.
–” he jabbed a finger in Al’s direction and the boy gave a sleepy smile. “– he was all ‘But if you get stuck too, what am I s’posed to do?’ and I was all ‘Don’t worry Al, I’ll save the day just like dad!’ Hey Draco, have you met my dad?”
“Fucking move!” Draco growled and contemplated the merits of breaking his ‘no spitting on people’ policy.
Draco made a sound of distress and broke the kiss, stumbling back in shock. He brought a hand up to cover his mouth but Potter was having none of that, crowding him back against the counter and swiftly pulling his hand away. He gently took Draco’s face into his hands and gazed at him like he was something precious, and when he brought his mouth to Draco’s again in a dizzying slide of lips, Draco’s eyes slid closed in surrender.
Ginny crossed her arms belligerently. “I’m only going to say this once so listen well. Draco is
Draco knew that he had to stop before he fell in too deep, but he was afraid that it was already too late. The times he wasn’t with him, Draco’s thoughts were full of Potter and the children. He wondered what they were doing at the moment. He recalled the times he’d spent with them. He found himself craving their company more and more. He sometimes wondered if he was addicted. Addicted to something that no potion could cure him of. Even in school, Potter had always caught his attention but now rather than trying to invoke an angry response, Draco would do just about anything to make him smile. Whenever Potter looked over at him with that smile that made his eyes practically sparkle, all he could do was try to smile back as normally as he could, willing himself not to do anything stupid like blush or look at Potter like he was Draco’s whole world, or – Salazar forbid – haul him over for a fevered snog.
Unfortunately, the carousel was proving to be uncooperative at the moment and Potter looked just about ready to snap and blast the thing to smithereens.
“Kreacher could have brought some up for us too,” Weasley grumbled, flopping down on his back. “He saw us come in. S’not fair.”
“Ginny already told me you were gay actually. It was her idea that I try my luck with you, but I was nervous and I didn’t know how to go about it. You seemed interested though.” He looked so forlorn now and Draco desperately wanted to give him something to smile about.
“I refuse to believe that you fell for that walking disaster with zero encouragement,” Pansy scoffed, dark eyes narrowing dangerously on Draco. “Are you honestly telling us that Potter never showed even the slightest interest?”
gone as planned. Still, Draco couldn’t help the bouts of anxiety that hit him every now and then.
“Darling, I make it a habit to speak as honestly as I can at all times.”
“Malfoy, I think my arm will break if you hold on any tighter.” Potter remarked in an amused voice.
As Draco stepped into the house, he made a vow that best friend or not, Luna was in for it.
“Well, that’s that,” Draco said to the room at large, pushing the last book into its place and stepping away from the bookcase. He regarded the organised library with a fond but bittersweet smile. It was done.
Draco shut him up the only way he could, pouncing on Harry and crashing their mouths together so hard that their teeth clashed painfully. At first Harry was frozen in shock but he soon melted into it and kissed back with just as much abandon. They were both panting and uncomfortably hard when they broke away and Draco knew he was grinning like a complete loon.
“Darling,” his mother said slowly, reaching out to hold his hand, “that doesn’t really make it any better, now does it?”
“Well Jamie, didn’t you already introduce yourself to him, seeing as you already know his name too?”
“That’s it,” he said to himself. “I’m done. I can’t do this anymore.” Was this the punishment he was finally receiving for all the fucked up things he’d done in his youth? Well, consider himself punished.
Harry startles and his gaze levels in on the ground where a bright green garden snake lies mere inches away from where his foot has landed. Harry lets out a surprised yelp and jumps away from the snake. He’s never been afraid of snakes before, but he
“The boys are asleep too.” he said as he led Draco downstairs again. “James was already snoring before I’d even shut the door. So,” he paused for a moment. “I guess you’ll be wanting to head home now? You could always spend the night you know. We have plenty of spare rooms and I can lend you some pyjamas.”
“Draco! Didn’t you hear what I said? Send a Patronus!”
Draco sent a smug look over to Potter and the other man made a sound almost like a growl. “I think it’s time we headed down anyways.” he said tersely, levelling his broom towards the ground whilst staying in the perfect position to catch Teddy should he fall.
Ginevra joined in then. “He was accompanying us to that perfume shop you told us about. Mum’s been wanting a new scent for ages.”
at the start, as if she could give me everything I’d always dreamed of.” He gave a shaky laugh. “You probably think I’m an idiot.”
shriek like a girl. He didn’t. He simply gave a… manly squeak. It was hardly a squeak even – more of a gasp really. A

The snake somehow manages to lace his hisses with concern.
when his mind was suddenly in turmoil.
“How exactly do you suggest we conduct this test run? Unless you’re planning on calling someone over, you’re the only non-Black here at the moment.”
!” James shrieked, and started making gagging sounds. “Gross Dad!”
Draco wished he had Potter’s confidence. Yet another thing currently stressing him out would have to be Teddy’s first birthday party, a mere day from now. He, Potter, and Weasley had taken over the operation, assuring his mother and aunt that they could handle it, and up until now everything
The deep voice made Draco jump and he suddenly didn’t want to turn around, a bad feeling settling in his gut.
“Ugh, get off me, you twat!”
Ginny laughed. “Yeah, it
I was expecting one with the War going on and all. My gift to him that year wasn’t something to crow about either, more’s the pity.”
“Well he
Draco’s jaw dropped.
“Is that so?” Draco sat up in one swift movement. “Well, I don’t appreciate being made a fool of.
“No, tomorrow morning would be better,” she replied firmly. “I don’t like sending Athena on long-distance flights after dark, and I know you won’t use a hired owl. You really should consider getting a new owl.”
Draco shook his head. “Oh, I’m not–”
“Hey, are you getting anything for Arthur too? I found this terrific Muggle shop that sells antiques. I bet we could find something for him there.”
Draco sent her a grateful look, not missing the compassion in her eyes. She probably didn’t know what had gone down between him and Harry, but she was a smart witch and anyone who’d been in the room must have felt the weird energy crackling between them. This was her way of allowing him some time to regain his composure and he was humbled by her help. First Harry, then Ginevra, Molly and now Granger – they treated him with kindness even after all he’d done.
Potter told Draco to go on ahead with the children while he paid the driver, so he led them into the large park.
“And I’ll be the best goddamn help you could have ever asked for!”
“Fine then,
“Charlie’s the second eldest in the family,” Ginny told him. “He works with dragons in Romania and he’s bloody brilliant with them.” There was evident pride in her voice and Draco nodded, vaguely remembering the redheaded dragon trainer who had come to Hogwarts during the Triwizard tournament.
When Harry let go his eyes had gone blank.
“Dad’s here!” James whooped and ran to his father at once. “We thought you were busy with Aunt ‘Mione.”
It was an immense relief when they finally finished up with the attic by the end of the week, and this also marked Potter going back for training. They were back to working only a few hours a night, and this suited Draco perfectly fine. If his treacherous body insisted on trying to throw itself at Potter every chance it got, he’d just limit the number of chances. He was sure the madness would fade eventually.
fitter than the other two, his muscular physique clearly outlined through the tight t-shirt he wore.
“Rescued by Mama Weasley, huh? Is she as fierce as the stories say?”
you,” Draco snarled, and the next thing he knew, he was dumping the plate of pies on Potter’s head.
let alone a
“I should have taken you up on your offer to come to Italy.” Draco rubbed his eyes tiredly. “If Ginny kills me…”
“Oh darling, it isn’t anything I haven’t seen before.”
“If you’d told me, I could’ve spoken up on your behalf,” Potter protested mulishly.
“I…don’t understand.” Potter looked rather like a lost crup now.
“I was just trying to help, for fuck’s sake! How was I supposed to know the little bugger would take it the wrong way? I only took the bloody roast out of the oven for him.”
“The clock?”
money. How do you think the Malfoys stayed so rich?”
The men must have heard it too, as they burst out laughing. “Oh, sweetheart, you can drop the prim and proper act already,” the taller of the two said, his extraordinarily thin lips spreading into an oily smile as he took a step closer. “We all know you’re long past that now.”
Granger beamed. “Brilliant! We’ll wait outside until you get ready.” She stood up and Weasley came to her side.
Draco eagerly grabbed at the change of subject. “Not really. I couldn’t play outside unsupervised until I was old enough to handle the peacocks.”
“Potter! That was my best one!”
“You’d do well to know that I never make threats I’m not willing to go through with.”
“Mother.” Draco growled. “Even if what you suggest is true, which it most certainly is not, you’re forgetting the rather crucial fact that the man is
“Hey! The seeker is the game winner more times than not!” Potter cried in indignation.
Draco nodded mutely and was then whisked away to the house by Ginny before he could get his bearing straight. Harry Potter had just pulled a wand on him, and it hadn’t resulted in duelling or injury. Draco really had no clue what to think of it all.
“Just about Christmas plans. My aunt is coming to visit.” Draco took one last bite of his scone and stood up. “I have some things to do.” He was walking away before Pansy could even respond.
“Bonkers,” Ron finished. “That’s the word you’re looking for. It’s a bit much if you ask me, going around giving people love potions. And how the hell do you keep it up, someone’s bound to notice if you keep slipping potion in someone’s drink.”
“No. I have more important things to do, and there’s Quidditch practice later,” Draco replied. Pansy finished talking to her friends and turned to face the three boys. Upon looking at Draco, she furrowed her brows. “What?”
Draco’s jaw dropped slightly.
Had it really been necessary to attack Potter?
Draco glanced in the mirror. Already, there was the slight appearance of grayish skin below his eyes. He silently cast a spell to make them less apparent. Surely people would notice them if he didn’t.
Oddly enough, Harry hadn’t found himself very distracted with emotions lately. His focus had been more on lessons with Dumbledore, with how to take down Voldemort, with the rise of death eaters and the possibility of Draco having become one of them.
This was written by 2 high schoolers, we've been working on this for a while and we're fairly proud of how it's turned out. Disclaimer: None of the characters or world-building are our creative property, they belong to our Lord and Savior Daniel Radcliffe because fuck jk rowling :)
Harry held up his wand. “I don’t know what you mean.”
“I’m sure he’d appreciate it,” Harry responded, “wouldn’t let him miss out on the party.” Hermione tilted her head to the side.
There was one face Harry found himself looking for among the customers that afternoon. One particular face with a smug smirk  and an unmistakable head of pale, platinum blonde hair.
Draco opened the letter. It was not very long, but he found comfort in reading his mother’s handwriting. It was written in a dark, purply ink.
hehe look at that they finally kissed
McGonagall would no doubt be questioning them to find out who’d placed the curse and why. It could just have been a practical joke or a first year magical mistake, but the chances of it being far more dangerous than that were high.
His skin was even grayer and oilier than before, and a few pimples had popped up on his forehead. Frowning, Draco pulled out his wand and tried casting a spell to get rid of them and, thankfully, they got a bit smaller. Unfortunately, the spell did not work on the huge bags that had formed under his eyes. He sighed, knowing there was nothing he could do about them, and instead focused on scrubbing more soap onto his face in an attempt to make his skin less oily. Satisfied with his weak skincare, he slicked his hair back and went into the common room.
Sighing, Draco continued to walk, but he heard someone else’s footsteps. It could only be one person. There was only one person who could follow him without being seen.
“Well, alright. Do you mind going up to the owlery? I need to stop by to send a letter to my mother.”
He couldn’t explain why he thought it, it was more of a feeling than anything credible. But when McGonagall asked him to recount the incident, he couldn’t find it in his heart to accuse Draco of the curse.
Surely he'd done bad things before, and there was no doubt his parents would be up for something like that. But did Draco, whiney and stuck up Draco, sensitive and over emotional Draco Malfoy, really have it in him to be a loyal follower of Voldemort? And why? The only thing he was absolutely certain of was that Malfoy was a death eater.
“She would be a good match for you.”
He continued to pace as he berated himself.
He had the vanishing cabinets, yes, but there was no guarantee… He would think about it later, after the feast.
Walking to the Great Hall, Draco thought about when these dreams had started. Before, Potter hadn’t been in them; they had just been various versions of Draco’s family being tortured or killed by the Dark Lord. When had Potter joined the picture?
He’d been thinking about Draco a lot lately. Huh.
No sound.
Harry stopped in his dorm room before leaving for the day. He’d planned to visit Hagrid later with Ron and Hermione, just to make sure he wasn’t still sore about them dropping care of magical creatures. And Hermione had mentioned stopping in Hogsmeade for some fresh air before going back to study. It was the weekend, and other than Quidditch practice he didn’t have much to do, unlike Hermione, who’s workload seemed to be boiling over even more than when she used the time turner in year three.
“Draco, there you are,” Pansy said. She planted a light kiss on Draco’s cheek, much to his dismay. He was grateful for her help with getting rid of the huge bags under his eyes, but he was still trying to avoid the inevitable. He wished he could just love her. That would make things so much easier. “Where were you? Crabbe and Goyle said you never came back to your room.”
“I mean have you thought about who to invite?” Harry frowned a little. He hadn’t given much honest thought to it, Christmas still felt far into the future. But it was worth deciding earlier. Afterall, getting his date out of the way would avoid unnecessary drama, which everyone seemed to be wrapped up in at the moment.
"No, it's no trouble. They'll heal soon enough."
“Draco,” she said with more force than before, “let’s talk.”
Maybe these nightmares mean something, Draco thought as he buttoned his shirt. He pulled his jumper on and went into the small bathroom adjacent to his, Crabbe, and Goyle’s room. Normally, first years didn’t get to choose a room, but all those years ago Draco had bribed another boy into giving him the room. Having the sink and mirror right there had been very helpful since he had arrived at school this year. Now, as he brushed his teeth, he avoided looking in the mirror, not wanting to see what he had seen in his dreams. When washing his face, however, he dared to look at his reflection.
He only had a vague image of what Tom Riddle Senior had looked like, but he couldn’t help but think about what it must have been like to have him as a father. And Merope’s side of the family was a far cry from rational or respectable. The idea of such a strangely cobbled together family didn’t make up for who Voldemort became, but it set a base for some of his ideologies.
The team this year had taken far too long to select, he couldn’t fathom how Wood did this multiple years in a row. But finally he’d selected a team that actually gave him hope for the season. Katie and Ginny would be chasers, along with Demelza Robins, who was new to the team. Jimmy Peakes and Ritchie Coote, two surprisingly skilled younger players, took the role of beaters since Fred and George had left. And Ron, of course, would be keeper.
Draco smiled in response. Grinning and blushing slightly, Pansy grabbed his hand and interlocked their fingers. Immediately upon stepping into the dark dungeon halls, Draco spotted a mistletoe that he did not remember being there before. Sure enough, the farther they walked, the more Christmas decorations there were. They seemed to be appearing randomly throughout the castle. Pansy’s demeanor became happier and happier the more decorations they saw.
Sleep did the exact opposite of what Draco had hoped. His dreams had been filled with visions of his failure at his task, the Dark Lord punishing his family further than ever, and Potter’s face tauntingly watching it all happen.
Draco nearly cursed himself out loud for thinking like that. Potter had been spying, and the boy was his arch-nemesis. Everyone in his family wanted Potter dead. Draco had wanted him deadㅡ he still wanted him dead.
Someone knocked at the door a couple times, and the door opened before he could respond. “Have you seen my scarf?” Ron said, stepping haphazardly through the mess of belongings strewn around the floor. “It’s getting chilly out, and Hermione’s whining about dressing for the weather or something.” Harry shook his head, only half listening.
Everyone seemed to have had the same idea when making plans, and he knew half the people walking in and out of the pub. Some members of the Slug Club came to chat, some of Hermione’s friends from other classes stopped by, and even Luna came in for a quick drink. Madam Rosmerta was as welcoming as ever, and it made for  a refreshing twist to the end of the day.
“Oh, yes. I went to do some studying in the library and I fell asleep.” He wasn’t planning on adding Pansy to the short list of people who knew where he was spending all of his time. Only Crabbe and Goyle knew, and they didn’t even know what he was doing in the Room of Requirement, only that it was related to his mission from The Dark Lord.
And then there was the whole problem with Malfoy.
“You need to stop staying up so late. Have you been using that cream I gave you?”
Dumbledore had been even more evasive with his words than usual, almost showing weakness. Especially in bringing Harry along to contact Slughorn. Sometimes it was hard to remember that there was a method to Dumbledore's madness; that's all it felt like sometimes. Madness. And madness wouldn't do anyone any good for the inevitable fight against Voldemort. He rubbed absentmindedly at the bruises on his face, drawing queries from Hermione.
(See the end of the chapter for
But tonight, when the Christmas party carried on, Slughorn would most likely be tipsy, and that was just what Draco needed.
“Whoever brews the best Draught of Living Death will win a vial of Felix Felicis. One vial will last you twelve hours. You may begin.”
Gryffindor-Hufflepuff table: “Amortentia.”
The Great Hall was filled with laughter and excitement. Although the train didn’t leave until the next day, the students didn’t have any classes that day. Draco spotted Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy, and a few other Slytherins sitting in a tight group. They seemed unnerved, worried even. Pansy especially. Draco hurried to sit with them.
Draco sat down beside his fellow Slytherins. Beside their table were four Ravenclaws, and across from them was a Hufflepuff and Potter, Weasley, and Granger. Various potions were setting fumes into the air. One scent in particular caught Draco’s attention, as it was the most pleasant of the bunch, although he couldn’t tell what it was. On the Slytherin’s table was a vial of a clear liquid that seemed to be boiling.
“I guess that makes sense. Maybe you won’t be so stressed after, then. Once you get those things done.” She hesitated before continuing with, “And then we can spend more time together.”
Draco resisted the sudden urge to laugh. “You’re lucky that I’m not in the mood to kill you.” He put his wand back in his pocket.
“You don’t have to be so formal around me, you know,” she said, a giggle behind her voice.
As he walked out of the Great Hall, a few Slytherin seventh-years passed him and nodded in his direction. Draco repeated the gesture. He continued to walk, trying his best to hide his frustration at his mother and his whole situation. Around him, the people in the paintings relaxed in the morning sun. The halls were quiet. So quiet, in fact, that Draco could hear the sudden voices of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley coming his way. And wherever those too were, Potter would most likely be with them.
Ravenclaw table: “Polyjuice potion.”
Finally, he stirred the mixture counter-clockwise seven times. It should have been slowly becoming a lilac shade, and then completely clear, but it only became a slightly lighter shade of blue. Draco ran a hand through his hair, which had begun to lose it’s usual perfection in the humid air, knowing he hadn’t produced a proper Draught of Living Death.
“Actually, I think it is. We’re friends, and I’m worried about you.”
Draco hurried down the corridors. The school was dark, but outside, the moon shone brightly. As he strode towards Slughorn’s office, he couldn’t ignore his increasing lack of success in his effort to fix the vanishing cabinet.
“You’re not going to breakfast?” Her worried expression reminded him of his mother.
A blinding light burst through the dark figures and the cold receded. Draco rolled onto his side, exhausted, seeing a faint, blurry figure with it's wand out, the light streaming from it. Before he could look any closer, he was forced to stand. Before him was one last dementor, but it wasn’t a dementor, was it? No, it was something even worse. The tattoo on Draco’s arm began to burn as Voldemort, wielding two X-shaped pieces of wood with strings attached, began to play with his limbs. The strings were tied around his wrist and ankles, neck and torso.
Draco blamed his thoughts on the impending weight of his task. Kill Dumbledore, and his father would be let out of Azkaban, and he’d be honored amongst the other Death Eaters. Kill Dumbledore, and his family would be protected from the Dark Lord’s wrath. That was all he wanted; his father back at home, and his family safe. He just wasn’t quite sure how to get that done.
Suddenly, hundreds of owls flew into the Hall, their hoots filling the crowded room with even more noise. One particularly majestic creature landed in front of Draco, a letter in its beak. It was his owl, Ulysses. Draco had never been very fond of the owl, and left him to stay at home mostly. “Thanks, Ulysses,” Draco said after the bird dropped the letter in front of him. “Go to the owlery. I’ll need you to bring my letter back to Mother.”
Oftentimes it was easy to understand why people were the way they were by looking at their families. It was plain and clear to Harry where Ron got his personality from the more he got to know his family. And Draco…
“I figure that I can focus more time on some things that I haven’t been able to do with classes and Quidditch going on.”
“Oh nothing, just teasing me. I was telling them about how you and your mother are probably coming for tea one afternoon over break.” Draco looked at the floor. “Anyway, would you like to go for a walk? I know you’re busy and everything, but I think it might help you destress a bit. All you ever seem to do is study these days.”
Gasping, Draco felt a bone-chilling cold run down his spine. The shadowy figures― dementors, he now realized― were upon him. Only, they weren’t after him. Beside him, his father whimpered as the dementors’ cold aura surrounded, their spindly fingers reaching out for his tattered robes. Draco brandished his wand, trying to ward them off, but no matter how many times he tried, he could not produce a patronus. In a last attempt, as the dementors descended, he lept in front of his father, shielding him, if only slightly. The dementors were not bothered. They continued to move closer, but never seemed to reach them. Wailing, Draco tried once again to produce a patronus…
“What’s wrong, Draco?” said Pansy, sitting down beside him. Greenish light filtered in from the window, causing Pansy’s face to look sickly. She looked down at his potions book. “Potions homework?”
“Are you alright, Draco?” Pansy asked suddenly, as the Slytherin’s took their seats in the Great Hall.
And now that Draco probably had the added pressure of the safety of his parents, what with his father in Azkaban, Harry couldn't help but― if only just a little bit― sympathize with him in some way. His gaze wandered slightly from Ron and Hermione across from him, his vision shifting focus, and looked instead to the boy in question.
“S’pose you’re right.” Grabbing a last couple of sweets, Harry started towards the counter, turning to face Hermione while he walked.
Right?
"Yeah, obviously." Harry said. Now slightly disgruntled, he tried to brush aside the thoughts from before. Draco wasn't even someone to identify with, much less to protect. And since when has he thought of him by his first name? No matter now, there were plenty of other things on his mind, plenty of other things to take his mind off of Malfoy.
“Clearly you aren’t since you’re being so defensive about it. Plus you look as gray as a ghost.” Draco opened his mouth to speak but Pansy continued. “We’ve known each other since we were little, Draco. I know how you get when something’s wrong.”
“Really now? We’ll see.” Filch grabbed Draco’s arm and opened the door to the party. The light spilled out into the hall, as did the noise. Filch pulled Draco through the crowd until they reached Slughorn, Snape, and Harry Potter. Just behind them were Luna Lovegood― Harry’s date― and Professor Trelawney; the latter two were having an intense discussion about some conspiracy.
“Not much, it’s still a little ways away. How come?” Hermione dropped her voice a little.
Smiling faintly, Pansy stood up, letting her fingers brush against Draco’s shoulder. Draco jerked his shoulder away as soon as she left, rubbing it as if that would do something.
Thinking quickly, Draco ducked into a doorway and snuck into the empty classroom it led to. He was suddenly very hot. He waited until the trio passed before exiting, casting a brief glance in their direction before continuing on to the dungeons. He ambled down the halls and stairs, coming up with a draft of the letter he would write to his mother.
“Exactly.” With that, her joyful mood returned, and she squeezed Draco’s hand. He tried his best not to grimace.
“It’s kinda strange but I’m not about to lose sleep over it. It got me that potion, bet it’ll do more good later.” He stood up and stretched, noticing a Gryffindor scarf on the floor a couple paces away. “What’s with you always taking Hermione’s side anyway, I thought you two hated each other?” he commented, making a face as he tossed the scarf over.
Clearly he had some motive or goal, whether it was assigned to him or it was of his own devices, and he'd have to deal with that this year as well. But it didn't make him angry to think about this, more just… curious. As a matter of fact, it had been growing harder and harder for Harry to hate the pure blood boy at all.
Draco didn’t pay attention to what Filch and Slughorn were saying, too focused on the fact that he wouldn’t be able to corner Slughorn anymore. He was glancing around when he sensed someone watching him. Quickly, he looked over at Potter, who had a curious, suspicious look on his face. Draco felt himself heat up as he turned away.
“Yeah, sorry, I’m a bit preoccupied.” Ron scoffed and sat on the edge of his bed.
Though it didn’t strike him as out of the ordinary at first (besides of course having been the cause of a horrific magical incident), but something about it stoked Harry’s memory as they were walking back. He’d seen it before, many months back. Just before school started, through the window of Borgin and Burkes. Right next to Draco.
Disbelief came over Potter’s face. “You aren’t going to curse me?”
Draco zoned out until he heard Granger say, “It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” So that was the pleasant scent he had smelled before. He tried to catch a whiff of it once more, and found that it smelled slightly of the treacle tart in the Great Hall, and the earthy scent of a broomstick handle. There was another scent among the mix that smelled like the aftermath of a fire.
This insight into Voldemort’s family history made his drive and intentions clearer, but as of late it hadn’t served to bring Harry any closer to taking him down. All it had done was confuse him further.
Draco scowled. “It’s none of your business.”
After a few minutes, the Heads of Houses walked around, passing out the timetables. Draco had Potions third. Comparing with everyone else, he learned that he was one of only four sixth-year Slytherins in Potions.
Hermione was the first to move after Hagrid started back towards Hogwarts; she crouched next to the object in the snow and picked it up by the wrapping paper surrounding it. “It’s a necklace.”
Draco figured that Potter knew about his Dark Mark, and that he had a mission from the Dark Lord, but he had assumed he knew nothing else. He’d have to be extra careful around Potter now. Not that he wasn’t already, and he was still having those dreams…
Quick tw for drinking just cause it's the holidays, a few characters get drunk but it's not too bad. This chapter is one of our favorites other than chapter 6 (can't wait to post that) So I hope you like it!
Seething, Draco passed the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables to reach the doors. He scanned the Gryffindor table quickly, looking for Potter but also wary about seeing him. He wanted to avoid the Boy-Who-Lived as much as possible after the night before. He was still wholly upset with himself about that. Thankfully, he did not see Potter’s tousled black hair or big green eyes sitting at the Gryffindor table.
“I’ll be fine.” He continued to walk towards the door. Crabbe and Goyle followed.
There were a couple interesting spells written in the margins of the pages and he wanted to mess around with them to see what they could do. As he took down notes on a separate page about pronunciation and wand motions, his thoughts wandered.
As had become the norm, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle were waiting for him. The two boy's scowled, bored, while Pansy chatted with some of her friends. Draco walked up to them.
That morning, he woke up from a nightmare. He seemed to do that every day. His nightmare from the night before had been particularly strange. It was filled with a strange language he had never heard before, and then he had looked in the mirror and seen someone else’s face. He couldn’t recall whose, however. All he could remember about the face was that it had black hair and was bleeding heavily.
This gave him plenty of time to think over his pensieve lesson with Dumbledore. He sat on the edge of his bed and opened his Potions book to look over more of the Half-Blood Prince’s writing.
Draco nearly spit out his food. He was quiet for a moment, continuing to chew. He didn’t think that their “relationship” had progressed that far. In fact, he had tried his best to make it move as slowly as possible. Apparently Pansy was much more oblivious than he thought. Or much more in love with him than he thought. “I’m not sure. I’d have to ask my mother.”
As the minutes ticked by and people came and went, Harry found his nerves cooling, and he felt much more carefree than usual.
"Harry?" A voice said, snapping his focus back to the table. Ron pointed to his still full dish he'd been poking his fork at for the past ten minutes. "You gonna eat that?"
His face was paler than usual, his hair and clothes just slightly off from his general prim and proper facade. Contrary to that usual air of arrogant bravado, he just seemed stressed. Though in his current state he could probably still charm his way into or out of anything with one of his devilish smiles.
He sat through the feast in silence, only speaking when his friends spoke to him, and clapping when it was revealed that Professor Snape would be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Since coming to school Draco continued to have nightmares, but as the months went on, Potter had become more and more a part of them. It was unsettling. Sometimes Potter would be there, taunting Draco over his failure, but other times, he was just sitting there, innocently watching as Draco’s parents were tortured. And other times… Draco didn’t care to recall the other times. When his unconscious mind had shown Potter as someone he should care for.
Draco sat down beside his friends. Next to him, Pansy smiled, casting him an appreciative glance. Confused, Draco looked around. He noticed Potter, not too far away, his bruises even more purple.
He started towards the door to meet Hermione in the common area, then stopped to mention one more thing. “Hey, Ron? There’s some spells written in the margins of that book, I managed to figure out how to perform one of them. Levicorpus. I’m gonna give it a try before we go.”
It had begun to snow by the time they started the long, scenic walk back to Hogwarts. It was warm enough that it didn’t stick much, but heavy enough to cloud their vision of anyone walking ahead of them.
There was no way he was going home. Not if he was going to be forced to spend more time with Pansy with both of their mothers watching. He was sick of being manipulated. He loved his mother, truly, but it was too much. He didn’t understand why she wasn’t trying to get her husband back. She was putting all of that weight on Draco. All of the Death Eaters were. How did she expect him to kill Dumbledore, save his father, and get a girlfriend all at once?!
Draco was sad to see them go, if only because he was now effectively alone with Aggravated Pansy. It wasn’t as though they would have been helpful if they were there. She motioned for him to sit next to her, and he reluctantly did so.
It wasn’t long before he regretted it.
Draco looked back down at his work, realizing he hadn’t stirred it yet. He stirred clockwise two times, then added the slimy sloth brain. He stuck his tongue out as he did so and quickly wiped his hand on a damp towel. According to “Advanced Potion-Making”, the mixture should have been a deep purple color at this stage. Draco peered down, noting that it was more of a dark blue than purple. Next, he chopped up the Sopophorous beans into small pieces and squeezed their juice into the cauldron.
Granger frowned. “I’m sure it couldn’t have been recently. I mean–”
letting go. “I’ll just get you some supplies for him then; it’s a male by the way. Oh, and I’m not charging you. Even though Little Owls are usually quite rare and therefore expensive, you were wonderful enough to want him in the first place and for that, I will give him to you free.” He hurried into the back room again.
. The house elf stared at Potter dispassionately and he blushed, tucking his wand back into its holster and pulling out of the crouched position he’d taken.
As the conversation threatened to veer towards a topic he could not discuss with a calm face, he politely excused himself to get a drink and hurried off again. This time he really did bump into George though, causing the man to spill his drink all over the floor. Mortified, Draco tried to back away but ended up slipping on the spilt drink. He would have had to face the indignity of landing on his arse if George hadn’t stepped forward and wrapped an arm around his waist, the result being that it gave the impression of him dipping Draco.
Draco must have jumped a metre in the air, and he whirled around with a glare.
“Well…”
“The mood swings are the worst of it,” Bill sighed, taking a long sip from his drink. “One moment she’s all smiles and the next she’s in tears because I forgot to put my dirty socks in the clothes hamper. Thank Merlin it’ll all end next month.”
Fire, so hot and so close. Screams and shrieks coming from all directions. Vince’s face as he lost his grip on the ledge. Fear, panic, a sense of despair. And then a hand reaching out to him. A back against his front, solid and comforting…
Potter slumped in relief and began to lower his hands. “Now, will you–”
“I’m just going to say it.” Potter mopped up his spilt stew with a dry little smile. “This is bloody awkward.”
“How does the smoke go out if we’re underground? Are there passageways to the surface for it to go through?”
“…and sent him flying into the robes…”
Draco looked down again, but she continued relentlessly.
“See, this is why I told you to wear a mask,” Potter teased.
Malfoy.”
Draco gave him a vicious smile, teeth bared. “I am, actually. My mother is by far the bravest witch I know, and anyone who was present at her hearing would know that too. Lying to You-Know-Who isn’t something that many have lived to speak about.”
“Well, fuck me,” Draco cursed as he ducked into the closest shop and startled a witch who had just opened the door to exit.
, even though he was quite pleased with what he’d decided to do. The other two were watching him curiously, waiting for him to continue.
wants biscuits,” Granger quipped as she sat beside Draco on the ground.
“Mother,
Narcissa picked the owl up and it sat quite contentedly in her cupped palms. “Why ever would you want to do that? He’s simply precious.”
Draco accepted his glass with the slightest trepidation. He wasn’t sure if drinking around Potter was a good idea but thankfully, he was fairly good at holding his liquor. Lucius had had his heir attending societal soirees from an extremely young age and Draco had practically been weaned on champagne as a child.
“Yeah, I did.” Draco tucked the wand back into his pocket. “I er…didn’t expect you to send it back.” he said haltingly.
Kreacher seemed properly torn between the prospects of shooing Draco out of his kitchens and arranging the plate himself, or getting praised by one of the esteemed Black sisters. After a moment of careful contemplation, the elf nodded and disappeared with an eager
“Well, if he was as horrid as you make out, I guess it was only natural to want to stay away from someone who seemed just as bad,” he rationalised aloud, for both his own and Potter’s benefit. “I’ll admit I may have overreacted as well, and it’s not like I don’t know what people think of Slytherin House, especially after they hear of its history.”
“I came to call you in, Draco,” his mother continued. “It’s about time we left.”
Pansy stared at him for a long while, a pained expression on her face. “Remind me why we put up with you?”
“Uh…”
“Whatever.”
“We’ve moved in with him until he recovers,” Granger explained. “So we’re pretty much subjected to the full extent of his whining. Ginny visits a lot, of course, but obviously it’s not as bad for her as for us.”
“Don’t think too much of it.” Weasley said gently, a painfully understanding look on his face. “When he gets this drunk, he’s not likely to remember any of this in the morning.”
“Yes, sandwiches!”
“But you never came.” James continued.
“Oh, same old, same old.” Ginny waved her hand flippantly. “Mostly worked the register and the front because George says I
“The makeup sex will be amazing.”
“Well, I’m ready to collect.”
“Need some help?”
of all people–” she shot him a scornful look, “–to take me out.”
Draco frowned. “In my defence, at least it was a fairly small shelf. And I was hoping you’d think that was an accident.” he admitted.
“We both know, you don’t mean that.” Draco’s tone is much too smug for Harry’s liking, and what little hold he has on his temper snaps.
These were

“I knew you’d catch the Snitch.”
Harry springs across the lawn and the invisible owner of the footprints gives a choked out
“Draco, don’t be like this.” Blaise ran a distracted hand over his face. “We were going to tell you, really. We just needed some time to sort it all out.”
“Draco, you are the stupidest smart person I’ve ever met.” She sounded completely fed up. “Honestly, just
“He’s dating Ginny.”
Draco nodded mutely and with a squeeze and a pop, they were standing in front of a tall house of the likes that Draco had never seen before. It looked more like parts of many houses mashed together actually and he wondered if magic kept it standing since it looked like it would topple over at any moment. He was tempted to back off now, seeming to finally realize that he’d be entering
It was like being doused with cold water. Draco jerked back sharply, and one of his arms knocked onto the carousel. It fell onto its side with a loud crash and suddenly began to turn, sweet, old-fashioned music emanating from it. Potter gave a delighted exclamation.
Ignoring the warning looks his mother was shooting him, he pushed his way towards them. He dearly wanted to pull out his wand and hex the living daylights out of the swine, but he couldn’t risk violating his probation. Landing himself in Azkaban with Lucius was the last thing he needed.
“Are you… Remus Lupin’s child?”
Another book came flying over from a faraway pile and Potter caught it neatly. He held it up triumphantly.
“Splendid!” Narcissa smiled brightly. “How nice of you to offer, darling.”
“Can we just go and check on Potter,
“Yeah well anyone would have run like that if they had a demon dog after them.” Potter said dryly. “By the way, thanks for doing absolutely nothing at the time. It was greatly appreciated.”
Kreacher was busily cooking something up on the stove, and whatever it was, it smelt absolutely divine. Draco could feel his mouth watering and he wondered what his mother had requested for dinner. He hoped Potter let him leave soon.
Ginny hummed in understanding. “I completely forgot that you’re a Black on your mum’s side. Have you gotten far?”
Mercury opened his beak in yawn.
Draco was stunned. “I –”
Once in the sitting room, he and Potter turned to each other helplessly. Without Teddy or the other children there to act as a buffer, what were they expected to do? They were Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy who until quite recently had hated each other’s guts. Well, Potter probably had anyways. Draco hadn’t really ‘hated’ Potter since maybe around sixth year when other things had taken priority over school boy rivalries.
Harry knows it’s childish but he still grabs a handful of grass and rubs it deliberately into a squawking Draco’s hair, making sure to get as much dirt in there as he can before he’s shoved off. Draco looks furious now but he must be really pleased with his trick because he doesn’t say anything as he casts a Cleaning Charm on himself. Harry walks over to where the garden snake is and this time when he picks it up he sees that it is actually a very realistic toy that Draco had probably spelled into animation.
Mercury hooted seriously.
Draco scowled, using his irritation over Potter’s flip attitude to mask his genuine relief. “I don’t really fancy joining Lucius over at Azkaban so…”
“You did call me here to help you pick out robes didn’t you?”
Draco placed a couple of cushions in front of his fireplace before settling down on his stomach. He reached for a pinch of Floo powder and threw it in, calling out “Zabini estate, Pansy’s room” before thrusting his head into the flames.
The boy seemed comforted by his words, and even loosened his grip on his robes. He sniffed one more time before lifting his chin bravely, obviously wanting to act like a ‘big boy’. He was rather cute actually and Draco found himself patting his head again.
“I think it’s best if I leave.” Draco said instead. He needed time to sort out what had just happened between them. This changed everything.
his mother and aunt – and it had quickly become their place in Muggle London. They always stopped by to get a bag of their chocolate brownies on the way to pick up the children.
“He’s so mean to me,” Ginny grumbled. She pulled Harry’s hand towards her and took a sip of his drink, casual as can be. Draco deliberately looked away.
like I have anything better to do,” he grit out, wondering why she’d chosen this moment to become unbearably difficult. “When do I start?”
Having ‘settled’ his owl, Draco found himself at a loss for things to do. Ginny was away somewhere with Granger so he couldn’t pop over for a visit, and as he spent the rest of the day wandering aimlessly about the Manor, he realised that her presence in his life really was a breath of fresh air. How he could have gone about his days before, he could hardly comprehend. If it wasn’t for the unexpected company of his owl, stubbornly following him around like a fluffy shadow, he’d have likely gone mad with boredom. His mother had found it ‘endearing’ while Draco had thought it a right pain in the arse at first, but he’d quickly grown to admire the surprising level of intelligence the creature possessed.
“And do tell me,” Draco continued with a grimace, “Why do both your boy toys look the same? Some weird kinky game of yours involving Polyjuice?”
Potter didn’t need any further prompting and he suddenly made a dash into the room, much to Draco’s horror. He’d expected the daft git to
“I know,” Draco huffed in frustration. “I just –”
,” Draco gasps out when he pulls away. “I thought you were dead, Harry, and I didn’t know what to do. I don’t– I can’t–” Draco takes a shaky breath. “If you died, I don’t think I could–” Harry cuts him off with another kiss, feeling like the worst possible berk ever.
“I was planning on having a short read before meeting up with Potter.” Draco answered, pushing the book back into its shelf. “We’re taking the children to see Luna. She wants our help catching ‘tufflepoks by the brook.”
Draco considered this. “Well, I suppose I

“Trust me, Bill,” Charlie said sagely. “The kid plays Chaser for my team. I’m never wrong about these things.”
Weasley scrunched his brow. “You’ll probably finish tomorrow, right? But tomorrow’s the party so we can’t celebrate like this. Think of it as a compromise.”
“She’s a good mum.” Potter nodded with a small smile.
Draco wondered if the man knew the definition of miserable in the first place. Face-splitting grins surely weren’t the default expression of unhappy people as far as he knew.
“Now we can put one in both sections.”
“Salazar, if that wasn’t just the hottest thing I’ve ever witnessed,” Blaise breathed, staring at his girlfriend adoringly. Pansy tucked her wand into her belt and dusted her hands off, looking like the kneazle that had gotten the cream.
“You’ve quite charmed all the Weasley women.” George continued, casually leaning against the wall. “I think my daughter’s already planning to marry you.”
“I am seriously going to Pensieve this.”
Draco frowned in response and stared mutinously at the ground.
When he emerged from the Floo, he dusted himself off thoroughly and patted down his hair. He could hear laughter from outside and stiffened, trepidation hitting him hard. Ginny placed a comforting hand on his arm.
So Harry finds Draco upstairs, and he does just that.
,” he finally answered, settling on the truth. “I wanted people to look at me and see
Draco’s breath stuttered in his chest and his face felt like it was on fire. Potter really did have beautiful eyes; vibrant green and framed by long, thick lashes. He could only imagine how devastating they’d be without the glasses in the way, and for once he was grateful for the hideous frames. Potter’s expression suddenly shifted and before Draco knew what was happening, he was pouncing forward for a kiss.
. He’d have purchased a new one
Once he’d finally reached the bottom of the stairs, he was met by his mother and aunt emerging from the sitting room, Cousin Teddy gushing away in Narcissa’s arms.
“It was alright.” he said aloud as nonchalantly as he could.
“Percy!” he called out loudly, startling the slim wizard who had just emerged from the house. “Come over and meet Draco.”
you.” Her gaze saddened.
Draco raised a brow. “Pray tell, what are we celebrating exactly?”
is all it takes for Harry to drop the snake, and stumble back until he falls on his arse. His jaw drops open and he watches in abject horror as the snake slithers slowly towards him. He wonders hysterically if the snake is planning on taking him to meet the ‘others’ and if they mean for him to take over in Voldemort’s stead.
“Salazar Mother! You cannot be trying to set me up with Potter of all people!” he said incredulously.
Draco was almost tempted to rebuff it, but he was tired from their scuffle and simply fed up in general, so he grudgingly clasped the proffered hand and Potter easily pulled him to stand. He placed Draco’s wand gently back in his hand and then, cautiously eyeing Mercury the whole time, he moved to pick up the blanket and novel too.
Narcissa hummed, taking a sip of rose tea before she continued, “I received a letter from Molly when I was out in the garden. She’s invited us both for brunch tomorrow morning and I accepted the invitation.”
“So tell us, Draco,” Charlie spoke up conversationally. “What are you up to these days?”
“I think that’s about it. Walk in.”
“Good thing I came along when I did then,” Ginny laughed. “You must have been in agony.”
“Okay, now you’re just being ridiculous. The Knight bus is a death trap on wheels.”
Potter gave a loud cough and Draco gave Lily one last nuzzle just to spite him before looking up. He didn’t look angry though, and even bent down to pick up Draco’s bags.
“Tell us, Draco,” Pansy murmured, moving up to pull him into a loose hug, her fingers carding gently through his hair. He closed his eyes for a moment, savouring the comfort of having her with him again. He’d never admit it, but when she and Blaise had left, it’d been like losing a piece of himself.
“What can I say? I’m irresistible.”
“Well then, I better get to that. I’ve already lost three days as it is.”
“Well she obviously inherits your stubbornness.” Draco joked and Potter shot him a
“The point is,” Granger continued sternly. “You really should visit him, and if you don’t want to help him with the library anymore, at least tell him that.”
Draco found himself flushing as he looked down at his own jeans and the light blue button down he’d worn over them. “You said to wear casually didn’t you?” he said defensively. “And of course I didn’t have to go shopping. I do wear Muggle clothes Potter, have for years now.”
“That was pretty nice,” Ginny said as they exited his room. “I’ve never really seen how you behave in front of your friends. For some reason, I used to think you all just sat around morosely when you were alone together.”
“I was the one who gave you the book. I wasn’t paying attention and you ended up hurt, and even then all I did was gape like an idiot and I couldn’t even cast a Patronus and–”
“Will you help us?” he asked stoutly, and again there was something so familiar about that unwavering stare. Draco gave a curt nod, even though he wasn’t so sure he was willing to climb down into a filthy hole, just to retrieve a sodding flower. He’d simply levitate it out if they were so adamant about it. So he approached the hole and peered down, and then almost fell in himself. A little girl stared up at him with wide, terrified brown eyes, her red hair hanging messily around her tear-streaked face.
“Malfoy?” The hand on his shoulder made him jump and open his eyes in a rush, but it was only Weasley. “You alright, mate?”
“And how are you going to do all those fancy Healing spells with a faulty wand?”
“Of all the cliché things, I actually gave him a bloody
“Ya know,” Potter slurred, arm firmly around Draco’s shoulder. “I always thought you’d be really
As they passed a darkened alleyway, the Weaslette pulled out her wand and shot a quick spell into the darkness, hardly even glancing at it beforehand. She laughed at the crash and sharp exclamation that followed, and tucked her wand away.
“Why would she do that?”
“Potter, surely you should know not to question the inner workings of Ginevra Weasley by now,” Draco admonished lightly. “Her mind is a terrifying place, I warrant.”
Potter’s face was a picture. He smiled broadly at Draco and for a terrifying moment seemed about ready to engulf him in a hug, but thankfully refrained from doing so.
Ginny gave him a friendly shove. “Seriously though, were you actually worried about my brothers? Mum’s already told them about what happened. If not friendly, they’d at least treat you all politely.”
“Yes?” He made the mistake of looking down and was immediately captivated by Potter’s intense stare.
Harry is almost finished now, and begins to plan out what to do about dinner. He’s been meaning to try his hand at making stew, which he knows Draco simply adores. It’s one of the only ‘plebeian foods’ Draco will admit to liking and Harry is sure he’ll be able to produce something edible, even if it’ll be his first time trying.
“Of course, why didn’t you say so in the first place?”
” He looked pained now and his voice had lost all traces of anger. “You called me Harry, and you looked at me like you actually cared. Like you wanted me as much as I want you and I was stupid enough to hope. And now? Now I think I’m falling in love with you, you’re all I ever think of and it hurts so fucking much when I’m not with you. But you made your feelings all too clear and I get it. After all, how could someone as beautiful as you love me? Yeah, I get it and I –”
is a death trap on wheels!”
“Really?” Al asked with wide eyes. “Were you friends?” Now it was Draco’s turn to not know how to respond. He looked up from Al and when his eyes met Potter’s, he finally understood why he’d found Al’s eyes, and James’ stare, so familiar. They were all Potter.
“A missed opportunity I know.” Draco sighed. “It’s hard being so talented but I bear the burden bravely.”
“Oh I’m… alright.” he tried to reassure her, though she didn’t look very convinced.
you! You’re all they talk about. For the past few weeks it’s always been ‘Draco this’ and ‘Draco that’ and ‘When will we see Draco again’. I don’t know what you did, but they’re utterly charmed.”
“Well,
“It might not,” Potter granted.
Harry gets up and takes Draco into his arms again. “How about I clean up and you go draw a bath for the both of us? I’ll join you as soon as I can.”
“Were you alright?” Little Molly asked fearfully.
tell me what is going on?” Ginny interjected heatedly. “And what in the world happened to Draco’s neck? He looks like he got attacked by the Giant Squid.”
“Cheeky bint,” Draco muttered, deftly snatching up her drink and ignoring her indignant cry as he tossed it back in one go.
“I’m just happy you had a good time.” His mother placed her hand on his cheek in a tender gesture before stepping away. “Well then, I’ll be reading in the garden if you need me, darling. If not, I’ll see you at supper.”
He was well and truly fucked.
bad. You’re being melodramatic as usual, aren’t you?”
Ginny returned Pansy’s shrill enquiry with a cool look. “Just that I figured since Draco’s a certified recluse now, it meant all his so-called friends had abandoned him.”
Draco lay on his back and covered his eyes with his arm. How like his mother to provide relief but keep it far enough away that he’d suffer whilst getting it. He dragged himself off to his ensuite bathroom and cast a quick breath-freshening and teeth-cleaning charm on his mouth before stripping off the pants he was wearing and sliding into the shower. A cold shower helped to wake himself up a bit and feeling more human, he exited the bathroom with a towel slung low on his hips, another one he used to wipe his head.
She pursed her lips and eyed him with concern. “I won’t disturb you long then. The post came while you were out and I brought it up for you.” She placed a small stack of letters on his bedside table. “Goodnight, my darling.”
known that this wasn’t going to last forever. He’d also known that he couldn’t go back to spending his days wandering about the Manor – not after Ginny and Potter had taught him to live again.
Ginny sent Potter an amused look. “I’m pretty sure he was glaring at me, not you, Draco.”
He shifted uncertainly, looking both nervous and hopeful at the same time, and Draco didn’t know what to make of it. He supposed he should be delighted that Potter was trying to patch things up with her. If all went well, Draco wouldn’t have to speak to anyone after all. He would simply tuck his feelings away to never be touched upon again. There was a reason he’d always excelled at Occlumency; he’d always been good at compartmentalising his emotions. Aunt Bella had called him cold, and maybe she’d been right all along.
“She speaks highly of you,” he went on, studying Draco as if he was some sort of tricky curse that he just had to
Potter promptly tripped even though he wasn’t moving, and Ginny choked on air. Weasley grabbed his girlfriend’s arm and propelled her out of the room, closing the door firmly behind them even as she began to complain. “Not our business, love,” Draco heard him say before their footsteps died away. An awkward silence settled in the room.
Ginny clapped her hands. “Alright, now that the greetings are out of the way… let’s pick teams.”
Potter let out a frustrated huff of breath. “Fine.” he groused, and Draco laughed.
Rose frowned. “That isn’t a very nice thing to say Draco. Mommy says to never say things that could hurt people’s feelings.”
Draco swung around and gave Potter a venomous glare, rudely dragged out of his reverie. Potter glared back, crossing his arms in a gesture that
Luna shook her head with sigh. “You are shameless.”
As soon as he’d rushed home from Grimmauld place, Ginny had appeared in his fireplace, demanding that he talk to her. He’d told her, in as little words as he could, that he hadn’t agreed to help Potter just to be insulted and reminded of his past, and that he had no intention whatsoever of returning. She’d been understanding, if not a bit too bent on getting him to allow Potter to ‘apologise’. He still scoffed at the thought, not needing to hear another one of Potter’s Ginny-induced apologies.
“Shite, Harry, I didn’t mean to–” The sound of Draco’s voice is like a balm to Harry’s frazzled nerves and he opens his eyes just in time to see the greasy visage of Snape melt away to reveal a concerned looking Draco, biting his lip in that way he does when he’s feeling particularly guilty about something.
“We don’t subscribe to the Prophet anymore. We stopped when the Trials began,” Draco mumbled, looking at the ground. The Prophet had done a whole piece on the Malfoys and the things they’d said hadn’t been kind.
“Can’t you just be happy that I actually accomplished something on my own for once?”
“You’re insane.”
“Likewise, Mr Potter.” his mother inclined her head and then turned to Teddy. “And is this my little nephew? My, isn’t he a big, handsome boy?” Teddy, who had seemed rather shy from the moment they’d walked in, now seemed to melt at the praise and soon he was chattering to her nineteen to a dozen.
“So you hit
Potter blanched. “That was… vivid. For god’s sake,
wanted it, and that was what made it so wrong. Potter sighed audibly and his voice was almost gentle when he spoke again.
“Not now, Ginny, I’m busy calling Potter out on the terrible lies he’s telling.”
Draco doesn’t make him wait long, the Floo flaring up about ten minutes later. Harry forces himself to lie limp even though all he wants to do is tense in anticipation as he listens to Draco stepping out of the fireplace and dusting at his clothes.
“Mmm.” Potter nodded. “I actually
“Oh, shut up, Granger,” Draco laughed. “As if I would wish that on the poor child. I made sure to only invite the people dear to my cousin’s little heart.”
“Oh yeah!” Teddy started to excitedly tell James about his flying lessons at Hogwarts and the little boy listened agog.
thought of you as a disappointment. I am never happier than those moments when I am able to say that you are my son. You’ve always been my pride and joy.”
“If you’re looking for Cissa, she said she’ll meet us there later.”
you? You look like Weasley but certainly don’t sound like him.”
“Probably.”
“Of course, Ginny,” they murmured in unison and she nodded with satisfaction.
“No need. He was just moaning on about how he was going to die and if you hadn’t come along, I’d just have to suffer through more of it.”
“Hey Papa?” she whispered so that only he could hear.
And yet…
They descended into silence and Draco began to feel awkward as the meal went on and no words were exchanged. It reminded him uncomfortably of meals at the Manor back when he was growing up, but there was nothing he could do about it. During their impromptu tea party the day before, Narcissa had skilfully led the conversation and he’d hardly had to say anything at all. Today too, their cleaning had been done in silence. Draco had never been very good at small talk when he was ill at ease.
“You know, it might be faster if you helped me with the cleaning first,” Harry remarks as he reaches for a knife. “Just a suggestion.”
Draco rubbed his aching arse tenderly. “What in the ever-loving fuck are you two doing here?”
“Ginny and I had broken up at the end of sixth year and even after the War, I’d needed time.” he’d continued. “Getting back together had been surprisingly easy though and obviously the family had been thrilled, though let me tell you, it is
“Well who am I to turn away free hors d’oerves?” Draco found himself saying back.
“Enough Malfoy.” Potter begged and covered his face with his hands. “Anymore and you’ll kill me.”
take them?”
valid?”
Potter’s mouth hardened. “Yeah, we heard about that. Clifton’s a right bastard to everyone though, so don’t take it too personally. He oversees most of our hand-to-hand combat classes and if he ever actually took to the mat, he’d probably get a good beating from all the trainees – myself included.”
Draco settled back in his own armchair, realizing that Potter was serious. “I suppose I should start at the beginning.”
“Whatever you say Malfoy.” Potter shrugged.
“Mother!”
“Thanks.” Draco said as he took them from Potter. “So are we leaving now?”
remain strong. Draco was his own man now, and Mother would-
“Come on Potter, surely you can control yourself for one night. I’m not easy you know.”
“In Diagon Alley. She said you were buying a gift for your mum?”
True to her word, Ginny made sure Draco visited as soon as he could – which happened to be the very next day. They spent nearly the whole visit in the sky and Draco could practically feel himself shaking off the rust of too many months with little exercise. Afterwards, they’d lounged out in the garden, eating the warm cream buns Molly brought out to them. Draco had never felt so contented as then, lazing about in the sun-warmed grass without a care in the world.
Harry’s already decided the space in front of the fireplace is best, so that Draco finds him as soon as he exits the floo. “Here is good I think,” Harry says, pointing at where he wants the mess to be and Dean pours a liberal amount onto the rug. He’s already assured Harry the paint is easily washed out so there isn’t any fear of ruining the rug. He murmurs the spell from before and the paint turns into a pool of blood. Harry slowly lowers himself to lie on his stomach in the middle of it and looks up at Dean.
In all truth, Ginny didn’t look surprised at all, and she was grinning from ear to ear as if she knew something that Draco didn’t. Swallowing his mouthful, he rose to give her a hug and customary kiss on the cheek, and only belatedly remembered that kissing her with Potter a few feet away might not have been the best of ideas. When he chanced a glance at him, Potter was staring back with a strained expression. He didn’t voice any complaints though, and sat placidly as Ginny made her way over to him to plant a kiss on his cheek.
“Why did we even start arguing in the first place?”
“Are you feeling better now?” she asked when he’d set the empty glass down.
Potter gave him an incredulous look. “Well, for starters, you went from standing completely still to spilling your tea down your front. Then you started screaming at
“Give it up, Malfoy,” Weasley interrupted. “You should know by now that once Hermione’s set on doing something, it’ll happen. Save yourself some energy and just go with it.”
Draco who is currently hosting a jack-o-lantern on his head.
Draco clenched his fists and stared mutinously at the ground. He
The party was to be held in a spacious parlour and they’d already put up most of the decorations and arranged the furniture. All that was left was to blow up the balloons and hang up some more streamers. Potter directed Draco to sit down on one of the couches and picked up one of the many small packets that he’d left there, ripping it open and subsequently scattering balloons all over their laps. Draco picked a blue one and regarded it with a tilt of his head, rubbing it between his fingers. Potter had wanted to use Muggle balloons and it was the first time Draco was dealing with them. The material felt rubbery and quite solid as opposed to the Wizarding ones which were pretty soft.
Suddenly there was a loud crash from the house and they sprang apart as if shot. Draco slumped against the wall, not trusting his trembling legs to hold himself up anymore. He looked up to find Potter in a similar state, leaning heavily against the porch railing.
Draco smiled and came forward to scoop the child up as Harry took Lily. “You’re mommy is a very intelligent witch.” he said and Al threw his arms around his neck to give him a tight hug.
. Needless to say, I had this bet won from the beginning.” Draco said modestly. “Now if I can only find the bastard, I can get my money.” He tapped his chin. “He’d usually be in Spain at this time of the year but unless they’ve elected a new Minister of Magic, he’s not allowed back there. Potter, are you alright?” Draco asked curiously. Potter looked like he’d just been hit by a
Weasley blustered some more. “What the fuck are you wearing?”
Draco carelessly got to his feet, only to lurch forward almost immediately as sharp pain shot through his ankle. To his immense surprise,
Draco let out a frustrated breath; if only he could catch the Snitch, the game would be theirs. George was already starting to look a fair bit winded. Chasing required a good deal more stamina than Beating and he was steadfastly growing more and more tired as the game dragged on. If Draco didn’t finish this off soon, Ginny would be on her own.
Potter?”
“Well, until recently you were the Weaslette.”
than the actual time just in case,” Ginny groaned in exasperation. “Whatever, we can still pick teams until he gets here. If he has a problem with that, it’ll be his own fault. Hermione, are you playing?”
Potter looked over at Draco with a grin. “Well, you heard him. Fancy some ice cream?”
“You must introduce me to this mysterious Rolf.” Draco said with a delighted smile. If there was a man who could make his sweet Luna blush like that, he must be very special indeed.
Draco swallowed hard. “Well… I just mulled about the Manor. Nothing special.” He wished fervently that Charlie would drop the questions.
Draco decided to stay above as his cousin slowly coaxed his broom down, keeping his wand ready to cast a levitation spell should the situation ask for it. Only when Teddy was standing safely on the ground did Draco follow, landing lightly beside the boy.
Out loud Draco said, “Well this was fun, but I should be getting home now.” Potter bit his lip and looked as if he wanted to say something and Draco waited patiently.
to be at your service.” Draco rolled his eyes as he leant his head on his hand. “Perhaps Ginny could join us too?” he suggested hopefully, and was genuinely startled when both Ginny and Potter responded with a loud and vehement, “
Ginny shrugged. “I had a feeling you were going to find more things to apologize about and frankly I couldn’t be arsed to listen to it all. I forgive you, Drakes. Water under the bridge.”
“At the start, our friendship was just so new and I didn’t want to make things uncomfortable by asking personal things,” Draco admitted. “You were both always together and Potter never seemed to like it whenever you got too close to me.”
Ron and Hermione talked about the new joke shop, and he tried to nod along and comment every once in a while. Occasionally, he would even turn to say something to Neville, who was attempting to make conversation with Luna from across the house tables. But still, it was frustrating how easy it was to slip into the dull roar of the banquet hall.
“What was that about?” Pansy inquired.
“I don’t know, I hope no one’s thought that far ahead.” Harry still hadn’t really processed the idea of someone giving him a love potion, he wasn’t sure he knew the antidote, or even how to recognize it if it happened.
Right when he was about to turn to leave the Quidditch field, he felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Ginny.
“I’ll send her a letter later today.”
Three Broomsticks didn’t fail to brighten their mood, to no one’s surprise of course. At first Hermione had sworn off the Firewhisky, but decided on a sip or two after Ron had some. They had talked about classes and friends and drama of all sorts, complaining about everything from problematic Slytherins to excess homework to professional Quidditch. The pub was bustling with customers due to the cold weather and the warm atmosphere of the shop.
“N― Yeah. Yeah.” He wished she would just leave him alone. He was tired of her constant need to be the center of attention.
To think, the heaviest burdens he'd had to bear in year one had been making friends, sheer curiosity, and the thought of having to go home to the Dursleys at the end of the year. Now the Dursleys were truly the least of his problems. Even Snape becoming the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor didn’t affect him.
For nearly two hours, Draco sat in the common room, pouring over his potions books. Perhaps there was something else that could be even more useful than Felix Felicis. It wasn’t until the soft chatter of people around him faded that he realized just how long he had been sitting there. Everyone had left for dinner.
To a casual observer, it would seem that Narcissa was the personification of calm, but Draco wasn’t just anyone and he could read his mother well. Anger swelled up inside him as he took in the tense way in which she held her shoulders; how she was surreptitiously trying to reach into her robe sleeve for her wand.
“The room,” Potter clarified, green eyes unwaveringly locked on Draco. “It’s just like you.”
“Fat lot of help you were,” Draco sneered back. “I should be heading back anyways. Goodnight you two and thanks for the drink.”
“There was a reporter,” the Weaslette told her mother. “But I took care of him.”
“Why, what did you get him?” Draco asked curiously, intrigued by the mild blush that had come across the bridge of her freckled nose. Ginny gave an embarrassed laugh.
Draco laughed and then vanished the hippogriff. The children came back to their places in front of him.
Draco tutted. “Now Potter, patience is a virtue, you know. Besides, I wasn’t finished. After an invigorating conversation, I suddenly found his arm around me and the next thing I knew, he was kissing me. I’d been kissed before, mind you, once by Daphne Greengrass – I still shudder at the thought – and a couple of times by Blaise when I first identified as gay.”
Potter began to scramble, hands waving about wildly.
Potter’s lips quirked with amusement and he lifted his eyebrows. “I still need help walking about but I have my trusty cane for that.” He gestured to the beautiful, ornate cane propped up against his armchair. “I’m pretty sure it’s an antique but it gets the job done and is miles better than having Ron lug my sorry arse around.”
“Might I remind you that not too long ago I caught you having a heated argument with your reflection?”
Before Draco could dredge up a response, the door to the Leaky opened and a boy of around ten came out. He had a head of bushy hair that reminded Draco of Granger for a moment, but when the boy caught sight of Potter he gave an excited cry and his hair suddenly turned into an exact replica of Potter’s while his eyes turned green.
Draco suddenly froze in his tracks. Where
Potter sighed, and Draco could hear him fidgeting in his seat by the window.
.” He made his smoke hippogriff stalk over to the children who shrieked and tried to hide behind each other. “And then –” he paused for dramatic effect. “It pounced!” His smoke hippogriff sprang forward and the children scrambled away, half-screaming and half-laughing.
Draco bristled at the mention of his weakness. “What does it matter to you?  I need to go to the library. I’ll see you later.” He stood and started to leave.
“Any reason we couldn’t have come here after a bit of Butterbeer?” Harry asked her, glancing around to look for the sugar quills.
There was a thud behind him. He turned around to see Weasley sink down to the floor and come back up holding his heavy wooden spoon. Draco rolled his eyes, wondering how anyone so incompetent could ever have gotten into a sixth year potions class. As for the other two in the trio; Granger was certainly good enough, as much as he hated to admit it; Potter, on the other hand, was a mystery. Draco and his goons had always sabotaged him, and his potion-making skills were more or less unknown.
“I haven’t decided yet.” For a moment he worried maybe the reason she was asking was to go with him, but his fears were reassured instantly.
“Don’t move any closer.” It was Hagrid. And thankfully so, he’d be able to take Katie to the infirmary. “And don’t touch what she’s dropped, it’s probably what’s gone and cursed her.” He pushed them aside and marched forward, looking Katie over before gently picking her up.
He’d asked himself time and time again, how Ginny, who was brilliant and bright, could possibly remain with someone who couldn’t compliment her in any way. It was only through his own acquaintance with Potter that he found himself sometimes wondering at how lucky
Draco’s mouth dropped open in dismay. “I was certainly

“So, are you really planning on leaving Clifton like that?” Potter asked after a moment of contemplation.
to the film hall, but I always try to immerse the children in Muggle culture whenever I can.”
Draco felt like he’d just burst into flames and he made a grab at his bedpost as his legs went wobbly. “Potter, you have to know that I didn’t mean to–”
“Draco, you listen to me,” she said, her voice stern. “I have
“Oh most definitely.”
“Dada!”
a bit of an acquired taste.”
like it would cost my entire wardrobe put together.”
“From what you’ve told us about him, it seems like you get along well now,” Blaise offered up hesitantly. “Is it really so horrible that you like him?”
“True story,” Ginny added, matter-of-factly.
“I will have you plucked and roasted!” Draco threatened, hoping that he looked menacing enough.
, you know, and…”
“She let me off early.” Harry replied with a smile. When his gaze landed on Draco though, the smile changed into one that spoke of many things that weren’t exactly appropriate for company. Draco felt his body heat up instantly.
“Just forget it, you don’t need to answer that. Fuck, I don’t know what I was thi–”
“Potter, you don’t need to continue if you –”
Bob’s smile didn’t falter in the slightest, even as he asked, “Excuse me?”
“Fine, I suppose I should have rung before putting my head through,” Draco conceded before turning to give Blaise a flat look. “What’s your excuse then? The sitting room, Blaise. Your
“His work keeps him away a lot though,” she went on with a sigh. “We’ve gotten used to it but I do miss him. He was always fun to be around; kind of like the twins but more of a friend-to-the-world rather than a full-blown prankster.” She brightened up suddenly. “Though he
“Potter, it is not proper conduct for you to climb onto a person’s lap like that.”
Draco wisely didn’t tell him that running errands was nothing more than a ruse. He tentatively sat down on the cushioned stool by Potter’s side and took a quick survey of the room. It seemed to have been left untouched since the accident and there were still piles of books messily stacked about the floor like little islands.
“I’m gonna call you Draco,” Potter announced. “Draaa-coo. It makes my tongue tickle.” He then proceeded to clumsily climb onto Draco’s lap. Draco was too stunned to do anything but gape as Potter settled down with a contented sigh.
It’s a few days before Halloween and Draco has been on his best behaviour since the spider incident. Not to say that Harry has let his guard down, because he hasn’t. Draco started this weird trick spree with Halloween in mind, Harry’s positive of this, and if there’s one thing he knows about his boyfriend, it’s that he’s as stubborn as a crup with a bone when he’s executing one of his plans. So really, Harry shouldn’t be all that surprised when Draco finally strikes again.
?” Harry points at the spider, placidly squatting a mere few feet away, and still as big as a bloody Quaffle.
“Will you come fly with me again?” he asked imploringly. “Both of you?”
“Will do.” With that he sauntered out of the room, his sister snoring away in his arms.
“Hmm? I’m blowing it obviously.”
“Charlie?” Bill’s voice was full of warning.
“Oh yes. It would be best if you didn’t go commando today.” Luna said seriously. “The jeans may be a tad bit tight and I’m not sure if you’d want the shape of your nether region to be visible.”
heritage,” Potter cut in harshly, shooting him an annoyed look that had Draco drawing back in consternation. He’d grown unaccustomed to such expressions directed his way. He probably should have left off then but the thought of something happening to the tapestry was excruciating.
“Well then, I suppose you’ll be pleased when he doesn’t make an appearance.” Draco observed casually, although the effect was probably belied by the cold smile on his face.
.” Draco corrected instinctively.
and soon appeared with the biscuits and a tea set which he left on the table for them.
“Actually, he’s not busy,” Draco interjected, making a quick decision and rising from his seat. “I’m leaving anyways.”
When Draco once more stuck his head through, he found Blaise groaning and nursing his head while Pansy smiled smugly.
Potter smiled. “It seems he is. Isn’t that right
Draco Malfoy’s wand!”
Draco sniffed. “Just because you won the last two games doesn’t mean you’re on some sort of a streak. Must I remind you that I won the first two games?”
Draco felt his heart practically lodge itself in his throat. Before he could gather his thoughts, he was already pelting through the crowd in the direction of the shout. He faintly registered footsteps following behind him, but any attempts to process this flew out the window when he came upon the small crowd gathered around his mother, who was defiantly staring back at a pair of leering wizards.
Potter made a strange choking sound.
“I came out to her the same year I realized that I was gay. I blurted it out during a family dinner. Lucius didn’t take it too well.”
“That’s what we should be saying!” Pansy screeched, pointing a finger at him accusingly. “Why do
“Oh you know,” Potter waved his hand rather absently and Al’s shirt was instantly cleaned. Draco tried not to look too impressed by the wandless act. Potter continued. “The fact that the I’m here eating ice cream with the infamous Draco Malfoy, old school rival and missing for years?”
“You have a very comf’table lap, ya know.”
“Percival.” Draco nodded politely.
Draco contemplated his next topic for a second and when it came to him, he almost gave a maniacal laugh. “Cho Chang.”
smiled even wider at this and gave him one last lingering glance before going back inside, the door shutting behind him.
“She’s just concerned.” Luna returned in a soothing voice. “You know she hates it when you’re sad.”
“Only because I’m tired,” he reminded Potter as they sat side by side at the long stone table in the kitchens, munching on the best chocolate chip cookies Draco had ever had in his life. He’d make sure to send one of the Manor elves to get the recipe from Kreacher as soon as possible. “Don’t think it’ll happen again.”
Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to meet any of her brothers but he nodded nonetheless. The back door opened and Molly came out, levitating an enormous tray that she placed between the two of them. It was piled high with all kind of buns, slices of crisp toast, eggs, bacon, slices of cured meat, a platoon of small pies, a bowl of salad and a large plate of fruit tarts.
fun.” Potter finally said and Draco wondered why he suddenly felt disappointed.
“Remember, I’m not likely to go after some kid – no matter how cute he may be–” He winked at Draco “–when I know Liam is waiting for me back home. But you know how much I love setting people up, and I know a couple of blokes who would
“What can I say Potter, he had it coming.” Draco replied with a shrug.
whatever this was.
“Yes, Potter.”
“Might I point out that I’m deeply offended by your poor regard for me,” George interjected in an injured voice.
They came to the front door and Draco gave a firm knock. Almost immediately it was opened and for a moment Draco wondered if his Aunt Bellatrix was standing before him. On closer inspection he saw that this witch was taller, and held herself with a grace that reminded him of his mother. While Bellatrix’ hair was always a mess and her eyes glittered with cruelty and madness, Aunt Andromeda’s dark hair was pulled back into an elegant bun and her eyes were gentle and kind.
,” Potter replied with a frustrated sigh. “The Familial spells seem to bring the curses back no matter how much I break them.”
“Well is he busy now?” James demanded.
Bob clasped his hand tighter before
“Er…”
Potter blinked. “What?”
Draco chuckled. He had enough scary stories to write a book, but most of them were certainly not appropriate for the children. The things he’d seen could give them nightmares for years.
“It was good to get out of the house,” Draco returned simply, trying his hardest to maintain an unaffected air at the invasion of his personal space. As Weasley had predicted, Potter didn’t seem to remember the aborted kiss at all and was acting the same as usual, which meant Draco needed to do the same.
“Potter. The children, remember?” Draco interrupted with an amused smile.
Draco stepped neatly to the side as the matron shot past him, grabbing onto the Weaslette and wrenching her off the ground with so much force that he was surprised she hadn’t dislocated her arm.
“I was–
Draco cursed his luck and wondered if it would be acceptable to hide in the loo for the rest of the afternoon.
“’Cause of the way Mummy was looking at you.” she answered seriously. “And, you’re eyes are sad.” She reached up and placed a hand on his cheek below one eye. Draco leant into the touch.
From what Draco could remember Potter telling him, it was Muggle but quaint and intimate. Ginny would love it.
Potter made a bizarre yowling sound and Draco vowed to make him feel pain the first chance he got.
“Well?” Draco smirked.
“Blimpy is sorry to disturb Master Draco, but Mistress is wanting you to accompany her in the sitting room.”
“He wasn’t trying to prank me,” Draco answered truthfully. “We were all just… talking.” He couldn’t help blushing again as he remembered
“I’m surprised you even know his birthday,” Ginny replied, giving him a quizzical look.
Draco flushed. “Low blow, Granger,” he muttered.
Lily gave him a disgusted frown. “Could you be any more uncouth James?”
to come back sooner?” he tried weakly. Luna crossed her arms, her frown deepening and Draco winced.
Draco laughed. “I’ll take that as a ‘yes’ then.” He placed Lily in the one next to Al and then surreptitiously cast a sticking charm on them both to alleviate any risk of them falling out. Lily was already squealing in delight and jiggling up and down.
After that Draco was able to keep the children entertained with innocent stories of his childhood and lower years at Hogwarts. They always listened in respectful silence, save for the occasional question and seemed to drink everything in. His storytelling was punctuated by his smoke figures and after the initial hippogriff story he kept his characters remaining in the room so that it was filled with all sorts of creatures ambling about.
“Doesn’t your usual wand work for you? You must have one of your own.”
Draco snorted. “Please, I’ve known since third year at least, maybe even second year. It was plain as day that Granger had a thing for Weasley. Honestly she’d sometimes regard him with the same look she’d give books and that’s saying something! All that had to happen was for Weasley to get a clue, and mind you I was a tad bit worried about that part. Blaise was practically ecstatic when he was dating Brown but really, who in their right mind would choose
“And I wanted to watch,” Blaise put in.
Harry grits his teeth. “Stop calling me that. I’m nobody’s master, and what did you mean by
“Booooring!” Louis called out and Fred snickered beside him.
“I, er, forgot you had a sixth brother,” he finally said, lamely, in his opinion, as he gestured at ‘Charlie’. Ginny, however, looked grateful for the change of subject. She hastily wiped at her eyes with a shaky laugh and Draco stiffened when she casually leant against him. Such nonchalant familiarity wasn’t something he expected coming from someone who wasn’t Pansy or Blaise, but then again, the Gryffindors had been a somewhat in-your-space lot.
In the living room, Draco placed the milkshakes on the coffee table in front of the couch and then set out a plate of brownies. He got himself comfortable on the couch and waited for the others to join them.
“You think you can take such liberties as touching me whenever you please, Potter?” Draco continued relentlessly.
Granger nodded. “With Draco here, we can have two Chasers for once if I play too. And I’m sure you all don’t want Percy to play again.”
His new companion sniffed again and rubbed a small hand across his eyes. “Lily fell in a hole.” he announced gravely.
anymore?!” he shrieked, pulling a sheet over himself as he realized that he was wearing his ‘clothes-for-my-eye-alone’. “What has the world come to?!”
“You know,” and her voice was gentle now. “It’s okay to fall for Harry. I for one, can easily understand why you would.”
“Mommy says that people only kiss when they love each other.” the little boy said in a delighted voice.
“Malfoy, that’s great!” Potter exclaimed. “I know you’ll do brilliantly.”
“Draco, I am still here!”
“Malfoy?”
“Not to mention, the press will have a field day when they find out.”
Draco gave a weak smile. “So I let them go, and haven’t heard from them since. Mother probably hears from Mrs Zabini but she knows not to mention any of it to me.” He blinked. “I’ve said rather a lot, haven’t I?”
Draco shook his head, hysteria bubbling up inside him. What the fuck had he been thinking? He couldn’t tell Potter, he simply could not.
“I see you all ran into Draco.” Harry said to the crowd in general.
Draco spun around so fast his towel came loose and he was just able to grab it before his bits were revealed. Luna smiled complacently from her place by the door, holding up what looked like a pair of jeans and shirt.
“I seriously did not want to see you, you know,” Potter continued casually, easily speaking over Draco. “I was really mad after you left, but Hermione reasoned that you were probably just scared.”
“Ah, you’re little hero complex.”
“Draco?”
Draco took the armchair opposite. “I never did thank you for the wand.” he began hesitatingly. “And for everything else you did too.”
Draco considered this. It was hard to imagine simple, wholesome Molly Weasley getting along with sophisticated Narcissa Malfoy, but he supposed stranger things had happened. And if it meant his mother had a new friend who would stick by her – for he knew Molly Weasley to be as loyal as they came – well all the better then.
Draco wasted no more time, quickly casting a levitation spell on the girl, and gently easing her up out of the hole and onto the ground near the others. The next thing he knew, there were squeals all around him and he was being tackled by three excited children.
“You bastard! You promised to never bring that up again.”
Draco did
“…and you can give my marble chessboard to Theo. He’s sure to treat it with respect. As for my clothes–”
“It wasn’t a problem.”
“…awhile.”
Draco was nodding before he even registered it. Apart from wanting to spend time with the children, he found that Ginevra wasn’t as bad as he’d once thought her to be. She was being
Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose in anguish, coming to the conclusion that children were evil beings indeed. How he could have once found them cute, he had no idea.
Potter smiled and leant back in his armchair. “I love a good story, and we can both admit that I’m going to lose this game anyways. Might as well stop now.”
As soon as Bob was gone, Potter turned to Draco. “Listen, Malfoy, I just wanted to say I’m sorry for how I treated you last night.”
Potter sighed. “The Leaky or The Three Broomsticks, which are both perfectly fine establishments. Christ, you’re overprotective.”
Something seriously needed to be done about his skin; he couldn’t keep a thing to himself.
The little girl didn’t say anything but stared at the swings as if she’d never seen anything so beautiful in all her life, her eyes filled with awe.
Which brought him to the only downside to his newfound liking of Potter – the growing attraction he felt for him.
“Malfoy.” She gave a curt nod which Draco found himself returning out of shock, and then turned to Potter and the boy.
“Actually,” Potter called down to Bob. “I was hoping I could get a bag of the deluxe mixed flavour pellets.”
“Don’t you think we’re moving too fast?” he spluttered after he’d coughed his lungs raw and had Ginny pounding on his back with a rather terrifying amount of strength. “I mean, we’ve only known each other for
Suddenly there was the now familiar sound of rustling in the bushes, though this time, whatever it was sounded much
Lily finally allowed herself to be transferred to her father’s arms, but not before placing a big wet kiss on Draco’s cheek. Surprisingly Potter didn’t seem to mind. In fact, he didn’t even tense up when Draco gave both boys pats on the head, or when Al ended up latching onto one leg while James took the other.
Potter gave a low whistle.
really did have some truth to it.

Harry stared. “You think – you think it was a

Draco choked. “
“Of course Luna.” he said with as much gravity as he could muster.
“Draco, do keep your voice down.”
He wanted to lean into the man sitting so vulnerably before him, wide-eyed and unsuspecting. He wanted to bridge the scant gap between them and really take this ‘second chance’ to a whole new level, and he was about to do just that when he suddenly remembered why they’d been talking about second chances in the first place.
His ears suddenly picked up the sound of approaching footsteps and he hurriedly shoved the book under the blanket on his lap, and lifting his gaze skywards, pretending to be observing the stars. He’d once claimed that he would rather pluck his own eyes out with a toothpick before he actually sat down to read a Joyce Gretchin novel, and his mother would be
“I thought it was friendly alright.”
“It’s just me, Malfoy.”
know, Malfoy,” Potter shot back with a sly smile and then took another sip of cocoa.
the sound is or if there
The kiss that followed had Draco arching his back just to withstand the force of it. He scrambled for purchase before finally clutching onto Potter’s broad shoulders, his head hitting the cabinet above them with a dull thud, although he hardly felt the pain. Potter’s mouth was suddenly everywhere; travelling the expanse of Draco’s face and neck, a trail of saliva and stinging flesh marking his path. Even in his dazed state, Draco had enough presence of mind to know that his neck would be sporting some spectacular love bites afterwards.
“How did it even start?”
“Malfoy, what is it?”
Potter looked so vulnerable at the moment and Draco suddenly realized with a jolt that even though he was the Saviour of the Wizarding world, Potter was also just a man. A man who like him had had his life already planned out for him, before he was old enough to even walk, and who wanted to just be himself for once – no expectations. It somehow made him more
“Of course he can, but I still think–”
“Well,” Potter continued, taking a step forward. “You obviously can’t use that when you sit for your N.E.W.T.s.”
“Carry on then.”
“Narcissa.”
“Harry!”
“Ron!” Granger smacked the back of his head and subsequently went up in Draco’s regard.
This time, Draco made sure not to show any outward sign that he’d seen the Snitch hovering near Charlie. Potter didn’t seem to have seen it the second time around and Draco decided to take a chance and do a quick circuit around the playing field to throw Potter off. Unfortunately for him, the moment he darted upwards, Potter suddenly went hurtling down. The sneaky bastard had been playing him the whole time!
“More like I did the picking out in the first place.” Draco laughed. “The man’s sense of fashion is very similar to Hagrid’s wariness towards beasts. They both don’t exist.”
“I still think you should take it easy though.” Draco turned back to his sorting. “We don’t want a setback in your recovery.”
His mother didn’t try to bring up their conversation in the library again, but whenever Draco told her he was going out with Potter, she’d get this look in her eyes. The look was a strange mixture of pity and hope and it grated on Draco’s nerves. He didn’t need her to look at him that way. He didn’t want her pity or the looks that she and his aunt exchanged more and more these days. Most of all though, he didn’t want these feeling that Potter had invoked in him. Draco was no innocent lamb when it came to the physical aspects of attraction. He’d shagged his fair share of men in his lifetime, some he’d even considered worthy of a long term relationship. Yet it had never worked out. No matter how much he’d enjoyed a man’s company both outside and inside the bedroom, it had never lasted more than a few months. But now, Potter made him crave something that was as far out of his reach as the moon.
He was pleased to note that the wards he’d set up were still in place and seemed to have even been strengthened. He wondered who had done it. Most probably one of those Gryffindors that Luna seemed so fond of. Eventually he reached the edge of the wards but on a whim he decided to take a walk. After all, it had been ages since he’d last been here and he’d always enjoyed his strolls with Luna before. He set off, lifting his face to bask in the sunlight that streamed down on him. He didn’t really have a destination in mind, and decided to just walk until he grew tired and then
Narcissa’s face lit up. “What a coincidence, I was on my way to buy Ms Gretchin’s new novel as well!”
“What are you planning on doing after this?” Weasley enquired, completely unaware that he was adding more nails to Draco’s casket. “With Ginny back at school and Harry going back to Auror training next week, you’re going to be at a bit of a loose end. You could always join me and George at the shop. We’re always on the lookout for extra help and you’re alright company.”
Where exactly did
Draco left the suggestion unanswered and headed down towards the kitchen, not caring if his mother followed or not. He hadn’t been close to Tiberius, not in the way some people had been with their owls, but he’d still felt a certain amount of affection towards him. It wasn’t fair that Greyback had shot Tiberius out of the sky for no reason other than to satisfy his sadistic needs. It wasn’t fair that he’d engaged some of the other Death Eaters in his sick little game to see how many Cruciatus Curses the owl could handle before he died. It wasn’t fair that Rodolphus had caught sight of Draco watching from his window and forced him to count aloud as they proceeded to take turns casting.
Ginny took a seat at the foot of Draco’s bed beside Blaise. “So I take it you two gave Draco a good talking to?”
Potter laughed and brought his arms up to hug Draco back. “It’s fine, Malfoy, I’ve got you.”
The last thing he saw before he whisked himself away was Potter emerging through the open door, a flushed Ginny close behind.
who suggested a break in the first place! So excuse me for wanting to know what’s gotten you into such a snit.”
“I know I was pairing you up with him before,” his mother admitted with an unashamed shrug. “But it was more of a half-hearted attempt then. I didn’t
“Wha...?” Potter visibly shook himself out of his stupor.
Their mouths separated for a moment to gasp in much needed air before crashing together again even more fiercely than before. Draco nibbled on Potter’s lower lip before taking his tongue back into his mouth once more and sucking on it hard. Potter moaned in earnest now and pressed his hips hard against Draco’s. This brought the evidence of his arousal in contact with Draco’s, and the feel of that hard length pressing against his own had Draco breaking away from the kiss to give a ragged moan, his head falling back against the wall with a dull thud.
“A cover?”
“Ginny…
Potter looked up for a moment with a smile. “It was nothing. Now, shall we begin?”
A shimmering silver swan flew past him, gracefully circling the room once before disappearing through the wall. He closed his eyes, the sight of the familiar Patronus calming him almost instantly. When he’d been a child, the swan had sometimes sung him to sleep, those times when Narcissa was busy elsewhere but somehow knew exactly when she was needed.
Pansy’s lips curled back at the mention of Daphne. “Bitch,” she spat. “I heard she’s having a wonderful time in the dungeons. The only eighth year Slytherin female to return.”
“Oi Draco, you better not be hiding because I’ll still find you.”
“I still think this is a bad idea,” Dean sighs, reaching for Harry’s shirt. He uses a swift
Draco was just on the verge of dozing off when a loud
“Come on Malfoy,” Potter began with a smirk. “It probably looked like that to that girl and I wasn’t going to pass up a perfectly good discount. Where’s that cunning that you Slytherins are so proud off?”
“You’ll end up as a crazy old kneazle man,” Blaise prophesised gravely. “Minus the kneazles.”
Lily tightened her grip around Draco’s neck. “Want Dwaco!” she announced loudly.
an absolute coward!” she spat, looking utterly appalled. “What happened to the little blonde brat who used to whine and fuss and scheme until he got what he wanted? So what if people throw a fuss? When have you
“Mmm, that’s nice,” Harry sighs, closing his eyes and letting his boyfriend release all his tension using only the magic of his hands. If he wasn’t already a successful solicitor, Draco could make a fine career as a masseuse.
?” Draco could hardly believe his ears. “And you still kept kissing her? Isn’t that like rape of the lips?”
Looking around at the boisterous scene before him; the children running amuck all over the lawns like little savages, Weasleys everywhere he turned, Draco couldn’t think of anywhere he’d rather be.
Potter gaped. “Did you…did you just praise Hermione?”
He took a seat on one of the tall wooden chairs and a few minutes later his mother joined him, looking subdued. The meal proceeded in silence save for the occasional clink of cutlery on the plates. Soon the house elves were clearing the dishes away to bring in dessert. Only then did Narcissa finally speak up.
“I think Ron just wants an excuse to drink. Get away from his heartache, and all.” Potter smirked, but still rose to get the drinks.
Draco felt himself deflate.
Draco sighed. He supposed Potter deserved that much at least. “Fine, I’ll come see him.”
Harry smiles indulgently at the haughty tone and makes his way to the fuse box. As he’d suspected, he finds that the trip has gone off, and reaches out to remedy the problem. Just as he is about to push it back up though, he hears a sound. Tensing, Harry swings around with his wand extended, but there doesn’t seem to be anything there.
Thin Lips stepped smoothly in front of them. “Leaving so soon? But we were having such a pleasant conversation.” Nasal Voice laughed again. It seemed to be the only thing he was good for.
Draco pulled away enough to regard him with a dry expression. “And here I thought you were actually being romantic for once.”
Draco couldn’t help smiling at that. “Yes, my name is Draco.” he said as he bounced her lightly, resulting in more giggles. She really was a sweet little thing and seemed to have some sort of fascination with his hair, now lightly petting it as if it were a kneazle. He’d never held such a tiny person in his arms before, but he’d quickly found out that the minute he put her down, she’d try to clamber onto his head.
. I just missed having you here, is all. Well now,” she clapped her hands together, “That’s out of our systems, how freeing. I’m terribly sorry you have to go now though. I’d ask you to stay for tea or even dinner, but as I told you, you caught me just as I was heading out.”
“Master Draco!” Kreacher trilled happily, wizened face twisting into his version of a smile. “Is Master Draco wanting something to eat? Kreacher is so happy to serve the child of Mistress Cissy.”
“Yes, I see that it would be for the best.” Draco replied with an indulgent smile. “Follow me boys, we have robes to pick out.”
“Well I’ll just be going then…”
They eventually came to the apparition point and Draco transferred Lily back to Potter. The little one had fallen asleep towards the end of the movie and he’d managed not to wake her. Draco looked at Potter and suddenly felt awkward. What was one supposed to say in a situation like this?
“Merlin no, of course not! It’s just, have you been with another boy before?” There was genuine curiosity in his voice.
Potter gave him a look that clearly said ‘you are an imbecile’, while James and Al gave twin whoops and pounced on him again.
,” Draco whimpers pathetically and Harry gropes around frantically for his wand. He eventually finds it wedged between the cushions and gratefully casts a
Ginevra gave him a friendly push. “Harry got frustrated with you avoiding him so he went to get some apples from the orchard.” She pointed to a small path leading into a copse of trees. “Go get him.”
for you.” Al said in a tone that made Draco feel like the lowest of the low.
“Luna, I don’t know what my mother thinks she knows about my personal life, but I’d rather she kept her nose out of it.” Draco said stiffly.
“Draco,” Ginny declared without a second thought. When everyone stared in shock, she smirked. “He’s been flying with me all week. Trust me, he’ll get the Snitch alright.”
changed.” she said cryptically and Draco wondered what she meant.
“How kind of you, Weasley,” Draco replied dryly. “But actually, I do have something to do afterwards.”
“Well, all you did was thoroughly confuse me,” Draco told him dryly, even as he felt a reluctant smile tugging at his mouth. “Delicacy doesn’t suit you, Potter. Stick to being foolhardily direct.”
“I am still here, you know,” Draco interjected.
“Honestly, Ronald, do you want me to go down and get you some biscuits?”
Harry promptly jerks back off the porch and the motion sends him sprawling on the gravelly drive, the stones cool against his back. He lies there for a moment, trying to get over his shock and then gingerly sits up with a groan, rubbing at the elbow that took the brunt of his fall. His gaze draws back to Draco.
“With Slytherin close behind I might add.” Lily interjected. “We were second in House points too. Probably would have won if Patrick Finnegan hadn’t lost all those House points when he accidentally set the dinner table on fire.”
“You look fine.” his reflection told him helpfully.
“You look
A smothered laugh, however, quickly pulls him out of his horrific fantasy, and Harry’s eyes narrow as he looks around him, finally noticing two indentations in the cut grass a few feet away from him that look suspiciously like feet.
Pansy and Blaise were watching him earnestly and the weight of their gaze felt heavy and uncomfortable. He knew they were only looking out for him but to his already frazzled mind, it felt more like they were pushing expectations on him that he just couldn’t meet. He hadn’t been lying when he’d said he was still a coward. He couldn’t just recklessly leap into the unknown the way they thought he could. He was afraid. He’d always been afraid.
“Move aside!” Molly bellowed, hurrying over to kneel at his other side. “Draco, dear, can you sit up?”
!” Albus wailed as he shot out of the robes like a Seeker after the snitch. He practically flew to Potter, who fell back onto his back with Al clinging to him as if his life depended on it.
When Draco finally pulls back with an audible smack, his pupils are blown and he is panting slightly. “My hero,” he breathes huskily, leaning in to nose at Harry’s neck. As he proceeds to move lower, unbuttoning along the way, Harry decides that this is one trick he’s willing to forgive.
Potter promptly flopped his head onto Draco’s lap.
“Ah, the life of a washed out hero.”
Draco shrugged, even as he felt a smile tugging at his lips. “Ginny’s alright.”
back to the Manor.
“Yeah, I am. Wasn’t it obvious?”
“Sorry, am I interrupting something?” he asked mildly.
‘calm the fuck down’! What are you even doing here? How the bloody hell did you get in?” It was disorientating seeing him like this so suddenly and Draco hated that Potter could make him feel ill at ease in his own home.
Potter looked embarrassed. “I’m happy he got to meet you today. The Weasleys have practically adopted him but until now, Dromeda was the only one he could truly say was his family.”
“Again with all that rubbish,” Thin Lips scoffed, his almost non-existent mouth threatening to disappear completely as he scrunched it up. Draco shivered as the lout regarded him contemplatively from head to toe, and the leer that came onto his face afterwards certainly didn’t help matters.
“What do you mean?” The question came out sharper than he’d intended and Mrs Spencer looked at him strangely.
“A terrifying skill.”
“Hey!”
“Sorry.” he mumbled.
The place was under a Fidelius Charm and he didn’t know if he ought to be touched that Potter trusted him enough to give him his address, or insulted that Potter thought him not a threat at all anymore.
Potter had the decency to look guilty. “I just assumed…I mean the brooms –”
“They’ll be here in a bit. Hermione is bringing them.”
“Boys, I told you to stay right beside me the whole trip.”
Draco could understand the feeling. Potter’s gladness over his two weeks finally being up could hardly hold a candle to when his house arrest had finally ended.
“It’s one of my many gifts actually.”
Draco made a loud explosive noise – a strange mix of a growl and a scream – which made the children stare at him with wide frightened eyes. Draco felt like a complete arse. He sighed, running a hand through his hair that probably looked a real mess.
“Goodness Nigel, haven’t I told you not to pull?” She gave them Draco one last concerned look before allowing herself to be dragged away, calling back, “It was lovely to meet you Draco. Harry, make sure he’s alright. Good day to you both.”
Draco snorted, turning his attention back to the table. “You shouldn’t sneak up on a man.”
Ginny smiled sweetly at Potter and patted him on the cheek. “Long story short, Draco’s my new best mate. He’s here to play Quidditch with us. You’re Seeker on Bill’s team. Oh, and I look forward to watching Draco wipe the pitch with you.”
“Has anyone told you that you are a very smart little girl, Rosie?’
“Well, thank the gods for that,” Draco managed to croak back. “I would be greatly displeased if that completely Gryffindor move had resulted in anything short of victory. As it is, I think I sacrificed a couple of ribs in the process and shall exact reimbursement on a later date.”
He was laughing as he set Draco to rights and then cleaned up the mess with a swish of his wand. “Really Malfoy, if you wanted to dance, all you had to do was ask.” he said, his eyes twinkling.
are you doing?”
Potter looked extremely alarmed now. “That’s comforting.”
He emerged in his mother’s sitting room and was pleased to find her already seated in her favourite armchair, busily browsing through a stack of letters. She looked up with a smile and he made sure to dust himself off in the grate before approaching her.
to meet this one.”
“How unfortunate.”
“Of course it’s a bad thing!” Pansy shot back harshly. “You think he’d almost go into a panic attack over nothing?”
come over anyways. Honestly, Draco shouldn’t have been surprised. Gryffindors and Weasleys never could read the mood.
“Thank you.” Potter squeezed his shoulder once and stepped closer, a solid length of heat against Draco’s side. “You didn’t have to but you still said you’d help and you have.”
“Malfoy, stop.” Potter placed a surprisingly gentle hand over Draco’s and stilled his motion, voice softening. “Can we not fight? I’m sorry I got angry.”
“It’s going to be pretty lonely without you around,” Potter continued softly. Draco’s hand faltered, almost dropping a pie onto the floor. He kept his face carefully averted from Potter even as he spoke up, voice hesitant.
“It must have been really scary.” Al said, coming forward and laying a small hand on Draco’s knee.
and Draco suddenly felt uneasy. Had he presumed too much?
Potter gasped, completely covered in meat filling and bits of crust. “Fucking hell, Draco, what did I do?”
Draco flushed. Just what he needed, his own bloody reflection giving him a pep talk as if he was a schoolgirl out on her first Hogsmeade date. He couldn’t even call this meeting with Potter a
Weasley shouted something in the background and Draco quickly twisted his head to the side. Potter’s kiss landed sloppy and wet on his cheek and he gave a pitiful whine as Draco stumbled away from him, looking anywhere but at Potter. He screwed his eyes shut, trying to get his breathing and heart rate back to normal. Potter was drunk and it didn’t mean anything. Hell, he was so tipsy he’d probably have kissed Kreacher at this point.
“Why must you torture your hair like that?” she moaned pitifully. “And those clothes…”
your outings!”
“It’s not
instead?”
“How ‘bout the eldest and youngest?” George suggested. “That means Bill and Ginny.”
In a few minutes, the stew was done, and Kreacher served them both generous helpings, accompanied by freshly baked buns. The meal was hardly of gourmet standard, but Draco still found himself gulping it down with the occasional happy sigh.
“Oh yes, we’re quite alright, thank you.” She inclined her head graciously and offered a polite smile. “Your assistance was greatly appreciated. I’d hoped to deal with the situation without bringing Draco into it, and I found myself at a loss when that despicable cretin turned his attention onto him.”
They waved a quick farewell at Narcissa as she read by the window, and stepped into the sitting room Floo, Ginny first with Draco following soon after. He figured there was no use prolonging it any longer.
“Oh, so Harry has seen it too?” Aunt Dromeda asked.
“Honestly, haven’t you both heard of shrinking charms?
The rest of the players were quickly split up. Ginny was playing Chaser for her team alongside George, and she’d put Charlie as Keeper. On the other side, Bill and Granger were Chasers and Weasley (Draco really could not call him Ron) was Keeper.
He looked so indignant that it was all Draco could do not to burst out laughing.
“Your concern is touching – though unwarranted,” Draco eventually managed. “I think word has got out that Molly Weasley’s adopted me and now everyone’s practically walking on eggshells around me. An Auror I’ve never met before even came up to me and
Albus smirked. “Even if we had cheated, you brawny Gryffindors would never figure out how we did it.”
Draco closed his eyes momentarily. “It’s tempting, but the answer is still no. I can’t leave my mother alone over here. Apart from Aunt Dromeda and Teddy, I’m all she has.”
“What do you mean?”
“Really though,” Potter continued more seriously. “All I can offer you is the satisfaction of doing a good deed by helping a bloke out.”
Potter laughed. “I suppose you could call me that, but I prefer to think of myself as
Potter scratched the back of his head sheepishly. “I know, I know. It’s just so nice to be able to do magic again, alright? And I’m still too weak to stop using this bloody cane so allow me this much at least.”
offer Andromeda the house, but she refused it. She says she was never very fond of it in the first place and much prefers her present residence.”
“What are you doing out of your dormitory, boy?” Filch snarled.
Potter. They were all Potter. Watching with that same suspicion as always, only more sinister.
Pansy seemed a bit confused. “I suppose so.”
The dimly lit streets of Hogsmeade brought a sense of comfort and familiarity, especially as the first patches of nighttime frost started to line the roofs and sidewalks. Ron had suggested they go directly to the Three Broomsticks for a pint but Hermione wanted to stop in Honeydukes first, and so he eventually gave in given he had lost two to one. Once inside he’d made an instant beeline for the cauldron cakes, while Hermione hung back a bit.
“Yeah, okay.”
“No, I don’t need your help. This is my task, and mine alone,” Draco said, a forcefulness to his voice that he hadn’t used in a while.  He stormed away before Snape could say anything else about the Unbreakable Vow.
No more than 5 meters ahead of them two figures had frozen in their tracks, their faces hard to see through the array of snowflakes. The longer haired one, most likely the one who had screamed, shook and dropped something from their hands. Reflexively, Harry reached to his pocket for his wand, Ron and Hermione most likely doing the same.
And then someone was calling for him, so Draco whispered one last thing and kissed Potter’s head before standing and floating away.
Draco poured the potioning water into his cauldron and added the Infusion of Wormwood, followed by the asphodel. The cauldron began to release a steady flow of blue steam right into Draco’s face. He looked away, trying to avoid the cerulean haze rising up from the darkness of his cauldron. All around him, the steam was filling the room, so thick that it was hard to see the two others at his table. He closed his eyes to enjoy the serenity of the humid classroom, silent due to everyone’s concentration. He hadn’t had a moment like this all summer.
She looked around before whispering, “You look terrible. What’s going on?”
“Oh. That. I wouldn’t call it spying, you're quite loud. Besides, I was already going to use the cloak to get back to Gryffindor Tower.”
Multiple times that night, Harry found himself staring into the endless pool of butterbeer in his goblet. Sure it was the start of the year banquet, but it was hard to enjoy himself with so many things he had to deal with.
“Not particularly, I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t empty handed in case we were supposed to bring something to the Christmas Party.”  There was probably no need of course, Slughorn wouldn’t expect everyone to bring something. But a couple more party favors wouldn’t do any harm. Harry grabbed a couple of extra candies and was about to meet Ron at the counter when Hermione stopped him. “Have you thought about the party much recently?”
“Of course. Anyway, I was thinking last night about Christmas break.” She paused, looking at Draco. He swallowed his bite of egg and looked back at her.
Harry set the book down, checking to make sure the Felix Felicis bottle was still tucked out of sight. For better or for worse, a lot of things were changing right now. There were, of course, more important things to waste their thoughts on, but no one could help growing up a little.
Everyone’s interest peaked. They shared in Draco’s hatred for Potter, as most of their parents were Death Eaters or they themselves disliked the famous prat. Draco told everyone about his body-bind curse and kicking Potter to the ground of the train car, and soon the story was echoed down the entire Slytherin table: Draco Malfoy had beaten Potter! The excitement was crushed, however, when the boy, slightly bruised and battered, followed a very annoyed looking Hermione Granger into the Great Hall.
They were sort of similar when it came down to it, at least more than they had been before. Before Draco had been spoiled and bratty and able to get away with anything he wanted to. Now for the first time he was dealing with more human problems closer to what Harry felt. They both had responsibilities imposed on them in order to keep the people around them safe. They were different sides of the same coin.
“I really can’t. I have a lot of homework to do before Quidditch practice.” She was starting to get on his nerves.
Draco found himself in a dark gray hall with stone walls. He walked forward, and the walls began to morph into thick metal bars. Shadowy figures loomed around him.  At the end of the hall was a man, dressed in dirty, torn clothing, his usually shiny, silky blond hair knotted and matted to his head. He was crouching on the ground, his face hidden.
“You should tie it to his leg, you know. It’s much more comfortable for them, I’d assume,” Pansy uttered, looking shyly at Draco and his bird.
He returned the kiss, gently, and felt Pansy smiling against him. Draco felt like he had aged years before she finally pulled away.
Upon arrival at his dormitory, Draco immediately changed into his silk pajamas and closed the curtains on his four poster bed. He didn’t want to stay up talking to his roommates. Despite this, he listened to their quiet mutterings until he felt the lull of sleep come upon him. He let himself drift off. Sleep would clear his mind.
Quidditch this year was going to be much more time consuming than before, Harry thought to himself as he looked out at the team he’d chosen. Tryouts had been a pain, especially since some of the students trying out weren’t serious.
He folded the letter back up and shoved it into his pocket. Even his mother was bent against him.
He was walking past an alcove, staring at his well-shined shoes, when he heard a faint, “Draco?”. He thought he must have been hearing things and continued. Suddenly, his arm was pulled back by someone’s hand. It was Pansy. Of course.
Instantly, Pansy brightened, slipping her arm through his. Draco tried to imagine that he was back in the common room.
“Like I said, not in the mood. Goodnight, Potter.” He walked away.
Minor angst warning for a nightmare scene. It's been a while since we've posted but there's plenty more on the way. Hope you enjoy! <3
“Oh, sorry. It’s just that you look very lifeless this morning.”
He and Draco hadn’t spoken in a while, it seemed, and that was rather out of the ordinary given how much rivalry they’d had in past years. When Ron had suggested they finally leave The Three Broomsticks for the night, he couldn’t quite remember if Draco had said much to either of them recently, and ended up asking about it out of curiosity.
“Oh. That’s alright. If you need help making the schedule…” Ginny  trailed off nervously, tilting her head to the side. Harry watched her bright red hair spill over her shoulders a little. He’d never paid the color of her hair much mind because it was so similar to Ron’s, but hers was much brighter. And more well kept, though the bar wasn’t that high. Just briefly, he pictured running his hands through her hair, through the tangles all the way down to the end. But something was off.
It’s fine, he thought. I’ll just learn how to brew it. It shouldn’t be that hard, right? He took out his potions book as he sat down in the common room. He groaned when he read that the potion would take six months and was highly difficult to make correctly. Of course, the one potion he needed was one of the most difficult to brew.
Of course, as he walked back through the common room, Pansy and a few of her friends returned from breakfast. She was looking over at Draco, slightly worried but mostly embarrassed while her friends poked her and laughed. Finally, Pansy said something to them and they scurried off like mice. She watched them go before turning back to look at Draco once more. She motioned for him to come over. Not wanting to upset her more than necessary, Draco took a few long strides and was at her side.
He stood, ready to go to the Great Hall as well, but only felt a rumble in his stomach. Still, he put his books back in his room and went into the hall, deciding to take a short stroll around the school.
Draco opened his textbook (a freshly printed, limited edition copy of “Advanced Potion-Making” by Libatius Borage) to the table of contents. He found the recipe for the Draught of Living Death on page ten. Making a mental list, Draco grabbed all of the ingredients from the shelves around the room; Standard potioning water, Powdered Root of Asphodel, Infusion of Wormwood, Valerian root, a sopophorous bean, and a sloth brain. Unfortunately, the directions were vague.
“I’m just on my way to Professor Slughorn’s Christmas party, sir. I was a little late coming.”
Harry stared in awe and confusion as she wavered in the air. What could be causing this, what had happened to her? He thought back to the other day, when he had tested the levicorpus charm from the potions book, accidentally hanging Ron in the air near the ceiling. This didn't look like that, she had no control over her body, and was in pain, like a curse.
Katie dropped to the ground with a thud after only a few seconds went by. She landed in the snow, seemingly passed out. After coming to his senses, Harry thought to rush forward and see if she was okay when he heard a voice behind him.
